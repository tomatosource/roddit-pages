</a>

      <p><a href="https://time.com/6991825/noah-lyles-olympics-2024-interview/?utm_content=buffera9ba0&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer" target="_blank">From this TIME interview</a></p>

<p>​</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When Lyles was negotiating an Adidas contract extension last year, the company, he says, threw him what it thought was a bone. Adidas invited him to the shoe-release event for Anthony Edwards, the rising Minnesota Timberwolves star who’s got plenty of talent but, unlike Lyles, isn’t a six-time world champ. “You want to do what?” says Lyles. “You want to invite me to [an event for] a man who has not even been to an NBA Finals? In a sport that you don’t even care about? And you’re giving him a shoe? No disrespect: the man is an amazing athlete. He is having a heck of a year. I love that they saw the insight to give him a shoe, because they saw that he was going to be big. All I’m asking is, ‘How could you not see that for me?’” (Adidas declined to comment; in February, Lyles signed a new deal with the company, reportedly the most lucrative track-and-field contract in the post-Bolt era.)</p>

<p>This slight represents the problem with track and field in the U.S.: the sport’s low visibility outside the Olympics. Lyles can go to an Applebee’s or Texas Roadhouse in Clermont unrecognized. And the Texas Roadhouse even has a picture from the 4 × 100-m relay at the London Olympics, the Games that first drew Lyles’ attention, on the wall. </p>

<p>Lyles has designs on fixing this issue. He swears he can be bigger than Bolt. “Yeah, why not,” he says. “That’s my plan.” While Bolt is an icon, by dint of hailing from Jamaica, he couldn’t—or at least wasn’t willing to—grow track and field in the U.S. “I have the personality, I have the speed, I have the showmanship,” says Lyles. “I have the marketing mindset. I’m willing to be uncomfortable.” In March, he did a pair of shoots with Adidas, filmed a spot for Visa, and did another shoot for Omega, between training sessions and running in a meet. He wants to host <em>Saturday Night Live.</em></p>

<p>The more likely origin of the term was the owner of the Pirates challenging the owner of the Red Sox to a &ldquo;World Championship Series&rdquo; in 1903.  This was before the merging of the separate leagues and the Pirates and Red Sox were in the NL and AL respectively.</p>

      <label for="lhn4b8q" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, it’s essentially exposure, which for a track athlete is probably needed. It’s a tactic so that people who root for Ant will start to associate him and Lyles together, boosting Lyles’ brand.</p>

<p>Now, Lyles might be offended by that (clearly seems to be the case), but it’s obviously legitimate. Aside from one week every 4 years, Ant’s SIGNIFICANTLY more famous than Lyles.</p>

      <label for="lhncg93" class="commentText"><p>Meh, we said that about Phelps too and people who are much less of a swimming mutant have broken and/or are chasing his records all the time. Even after the suit rule changes. Someone will break the record eventually and they won&rsquo;t necessarily have to be a carbon copy or superior version of Bolt to do it. Sports progress. Things we once thought were physically impossible quickly become the norm once someone finally crosses the threshold and does it. I&rsquo;ve seen it way too many times to ever write a record off as unbreakable.</p>

<p>What made Bolt so unique is that he was so tall, coupled with his size. It meant that his strides gave him a huge advantage when he reached his top speed. Scientists have predicted it’s going to take at least 40 years for his record’s to be broken.</p>

      <label for="lhnbb99" class="commentText"><p>True. When you’re the clear GOAT you’re larger than life and being cocky seems authentic, so most people like it or at least don’t mind. Same with Jordan. Same thing is currently happening with Magnus Carlsen in chess, though there are a few retired players that compete for the GOAT title there. Problem is Noah is not even a clear favorite currently, so the extreme cockiness doesn’t feel authentic</p>

I know people who know Colby Covington personally and say he is nothing like how he is on tv, but he knows that Dana White only props up the guys who sell PPVs, and the a large portion of UFC fans nowadays come from WWE fandom where they want soap opera drama, so he plays up a character that stands out, even if for the wrong reasons. Play the heel, and people are going to hate you, even more so if you’re great, if you can’t handle it or the money doesn’t shield you enough, don’t play the heel</p>

Some people can have a lot of talent, but the charm and charisma of a wet mop. He’s also seemingly going viral for the wrong reasons (the “who” when asked about Canada).  Hopefully he can bring running to popularity again, but personally, dude needs to approach things with a better attitude.</p>

<p>Lyles is a bit cringe at times but not talking shit is not a requirement for being a great. We all appreciate class acts, but sports would be boring if nobody ever talked shit. Lyles is fine being the villain, and that makes it more entertaining.</p>

You can be confident and arrogant without extending to the level of being insufferable</p>

And before you know it, 4 years go by, and we do it all again. I can&rsquo;t imagine there isn&rsquo;t a way to get more exposure for these athletes/sports that are so popular in the Olympics. There are obviously events outside of the Olympics, but nobody really cares. Winning medals in the World Championships is essentially meaningless to most folks outside of those particular sports&rsquo; bubbles.</p>

<p>Maybe he sees Edwards getting all this attention by saying what&rsquo;s on his mind at any given time and is trying to follow suit. But, yeah, this isn&rsquo;t the greatest look.</p>

<p>For the most part he <em>is</em> correct.</p>

<p>No, NBA <em>franchises</em> (not the NBA itself, who has no bearing on what teams put on their banners) shouldn&rsquo;t label their championship banners with &ldquo;World Champions&rdquo; when it&rsquo;s only a league championship.</p>

<p>&hellip;and yes, he does deserve more attention, support and recognition for his accomplishments from his shoe sponsor.</p>

<p>HOWEVER, all that goodwill goes out the window the moment you start tearing down others in order to bolster yourself. Especially when the people you&rsquo;re attacking have never slighted you in public (cause I don&rsquo;t know what goes on behind closed doors).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure it works for him, but man&hellip;I have little desire to rally behind him when this is his approach.</p>

<p>So he’s the only guy I know from track and field and what I know about him is that he’s unlikeable.</p>

<p>That is not the result of good marketing.</p>

<p>The issue is that he brought up another athlete and disparaged him by comparing himself to him.</p>

<p>The truth is that Antman will make Adidas a lot more money than Lyles will. Adidas cares about the money they make, not the gold medals won by the athlete.</p>

I like his belief in himself but he continually shits on huge moneymakers for shoe companies.  Basketball players sell more products than runners, and him alienating himself and the sports with these comments isn&rsquo;t helping him get more money.  Yeah he gets some press but he&rsquo;s also pissing a lot of folks off to and showing that he may not be the guy they want a brand associated with.</p>
