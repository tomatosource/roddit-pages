      <label for="lidgw3a" class="commentText"><p>It feels like they might be a little bit high. I think they&rsquo;re going to be a good team next year, and I&rsquo;d probably be excited if I was a fan, but I also think they might be getting overrated because they were considered one of the best teams in the West as recent as 2023. I think they might even be better than back then if things go well, but it feels like last season the competition in the West skyrocketed to the point where they probably won&rsquo;t be as good as people expect.</p>

      <label for="lidawot" class="commentText"><p>I tried ranking the West but gotdamn, what an impossible clusterfuck to predict. I’d expect the Nugs and Thunder to be at or near the top. Mavs too (I suppose—I’m not bullish on em), given their run, but I’m lower on them but I digress. Everyone else just seems like a hodgepodge.</p>

<p>The East isn’t clear either but you have a general idea of how things go, assuming health for all teams. Celtics and then some combination of Knicks, Philly, Bucks at the top, and and some teams on the precipice if they get big jumps from younguns. </p>

      <label for="lidp8ho" class="commentText"><p>With Morant back, I think that Memphis being a little higher makes sense. He hasn&rsquo;t played much in the past season, so a regression is probably expected, but it&rsquo;s fair to rank them sixish. I think people are sleeping on the Lakers and Warriors. I won&rsquo;t believe LBJ or Steph will slow down until I see the signs, and right now, they haven&rsquo;t shown any. I also am kinda shocked that the Nuggets rank as low as they do, as if Jokic isn&rsquo;t the best in the world. I also don&rsquo;t know how much Demar changes things for the Kings, or makes them real contenders for the playoffs. Could be wrong though.</p>

<p>In the East, I really do think the Celtics will be the 1 seed again, they&rsquo;re just so deep and Tatum is really that good. I think they&rsquo;re in the most favorable position to win their conference (again), but the Sixers and a retooled Bucks both could be really scary. Part of me still really needs to see Joel look healthy, and I don&rsquo;t know how PG will fit in with Maxey and The Process. I still expect them to be very good, though. Bucks is the biggest question mark for me, considering how their season totally went into a tailspin after hiring Doc. I&rsquo;m kinda rooting for them in the East, and I think they could put it together, it&rsquo;s just a big &ldquo;if.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lidcusg" class="commentText"><p>Mavs are going to surprise people this regular season! I have them 2nd behind OKC because I feel the young Thunder will be healthier. Roster for roster I feel like they’re even but I trust Mavs offense more!</p>

<p>I don’t get Wolves hype besides Ant growth I guess. Conley’s older and Kat is Kat. Are they expecting rookie Rob Dillingham to be really effective really fast?</p>

<p>Nuggets are very overrated because of Joker and the champions run. You would think they’re a dynasty the way the media respects them. They were exposed in the playoffs for their lack of depth and they respond by losing KCP,and Reggie Jackson but add Westbrook? Also what kind of Jamal Murray are they going to get? Losing Deron Holmes for the season isn’t helping either!</p>

<p>Kings,Suns,and Grizzlies im high on for the regular season. Any of them can be the 4 seed imo.</p>

<p>The Sixers and Knicks maybe even Milwaukee I feel are legit threats to Boston! I still have Boston as the 1 seed but I have Philly right behind them.</p>

      <label for="lidf0e4" class="commentText"><p>The west is a toss up between two halves. 1-4 can be anyone from DAL, DEN, OKC, MIN. The interesting part is the 5-8 slots. I put MEM and 5, PHX in 6, LAL at 7, and LAC at 8. Im a Laker die hard so i tried to be as objective as possible. They finished 8th with 47 wins last season with poor coaching, and missing 2.5 rotation guys for most of the year. They relied on Cam reddish and T Prince way too much. With the current roster and everyone being healthy giving them a +4 in the wins isnt too farfetched. Clippers losing PG, should net them a few less wins. I put SAC at 9 and GSW at 10.</p>

No Vando and gabe who are arguably their best perimeter defenders for 90% of the season. Roster stayed the same minus Dinwiddie and Tprince, but the coaching staff improved. Thinking logically here, adding back in your 2 key role players, and possibly 3 with C.Wood. +5 wins isnt too farfetched.<br>
52 wins was good enough for 5 last season, adjusted for the teams that also improved. i feel like 7th is a fair assesment</p>

      <label for="lie5qzd" class="commentText"><p>Luka and his fat terrible conditioning with no defense + Klay and Kyrie at 35 yo, isn’t taking 1st playing 82 games lad. Lol.</p>

<p>They can bank on being clutch in playoffs, just not the reg seasn. Thats why Luka never got bigger than 4th with all the stats he put up.</p>

      <label for="lie6nxp" class="commentText"><p>Luka alone would go to the Finals, now he have Kyrie and Klay. Lively and PJ &ldquo;Standing on the bussiness&rdquo;, Private Marshall, and the LobGoblin Gafford! If Mavs are not in the Finals this year it will be the biggest surprise of the season. But Luka has to be in shape, that I agree.</p>
