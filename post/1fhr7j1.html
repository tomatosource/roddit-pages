      <p>How do you guys feel about KD? Do you see him as a Warriors legend, in the same regard as Curry, Klaw and Green, or its more bittersweet?</p>

      <label for="lnc2omb" class="commentText"><p>For me at least, he won&rsquo;t quite have the same nostalgia as Curry/Klay/Green when looking back since those 3 were drafted and were a part of the Warriors when the franchise was going through growing pains and what not. (A good example is Klay leaving felt more like the &ldquo;end to an era&rdquo; than KD leaving)</p>

<p>But I absolutely view him as a warriors legend like those 3 and think his jersey should be retired without question. He won us 2 championships, possibly even a 3rd if he stays healthy</p>

      <label for="lnc34j5" class="commentText"><p>he&rsquo;s absolutely a Warriors legend, no doubt.</p>

<p>i have no conflicted feelings. he came here to create the best team of all-time, he did so and meshed beautifully with the existing team, and then left when he needed something different. no one who&rsquo;s on the team for that short is going to fill the same place in the fan&rsquo;s hearts as Curry, but i think the fans feelings about Klay and Draymond are also a little conflicted (not in any bad way, they just have more ups and downs). in the long run, i don&rsquo;t think the difference is going to be all that great.</p>

<p>honestly, my only feeling is that if KD really wanted to find a spot in the NBA where the fans would truly accept him and he could have played out his career, he should have just stayed here. whatever outside bullshit noise would have faded and the fans would have claimed him as their own as much as nearly any Warriors ever if he had done so.</p>

      <label for="lnc59y6" class="commentText"><p>It’s not KDs fault but I didn’t like the narratives around the team when he was there. It was like the warriors and kd were viewed as separate things.</p>

<p>People used the Warriors to discredit KD and people used KD to discredit the Warriors. Outside of 2017, just basketball wise it felt a lot more fun to watch the Warriors in 2015 and 2016.</p>

      <label for="lncbwca" class="commentText"><p>KD is absolutely great and will always have a warm welcome at Chase Center. He can’t be at the same level as Steph Klay and Draymond though because they were there the whole way through.</p>

<p>If he had stayed and they won a few more championships, it would have been different and he could have been a defining part of what could have been the greatest dynasty ever. But no hard feelings that he didn’t want to give that a shot.</p>

      <label for="lnc7dm7" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s a legend and one of the best players to ever wear a Warriors uniform, but for me personally, KD joining made watching the Warriors and the NBA much less fun.</p>

<p>However without KD the Warriors might not have won in 2017 or 2018 or reached the finals in 2019 and his joining the team allowed us to witness one of the greatest teams ever assembled in the NBA.</p>
