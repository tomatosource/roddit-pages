      <label for="lj3uzuk" class="commentText"><p>One of my favorite things about him is that  &ldquo;Love of the Game Clause&rdquo; written into his contract which allowed him to play basketball against anyone at any time. You can just see how much he genuinely loved playing basketball and how he inspired so many around the world love basketball as well. Kenny Smith talked about <a href="https://youtu.be/bHWH-oRJ9IM?si=VJxRU_lwJz2xOpBq&amp;t=13" target="_blank">how he would just show up to North Carolina practices/scrimmages to play for fun; it just encapsulates who MJ is.</a>.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I refuse to criticize him for &ldquo;ruining the fairy tale ending with the Bulls&rdquo; and coming back to play a couple of years for the Wizards&ndash;he came back for fun and that&rsquo;s pure as it gets to me. And once he shook off that rust, he had like a near 20 game stretch where he averaged 26-6-6 with 46% from the field (scoring and effiency was clearly lower in that 2002 compared to 2024)  and had <a href="https://youtu.be/xvQfjsCuvX0?si=DsCMZe8I-xMSPR5Y&amp;t=363" target="_blank">an epic defensive performance where he shut down 26 year old Vince Carter during a second half once he was asked to guard him.</a></p>

He left the first time bc His father was murdered and it affected him profoundly after he won his third ring and his dad wasn&rsquo;t there to celebrate with him. That, combined with exhaustion and a lost love for the game made him step away. And he always wanted to play baseball, his first true passion.</p>

      <label for="lj66ks3" class="commentText"><p>To understand the Wizards run is to understand Michael Jordan&rsquo;s quest for a challenge. Once you realize that he approached sports as a challenge then his retirements make sense. The sport gets too easy in 93 so he quits to pursue another challenge that he thinks will be more stimulating and fulfilling. He leaves in 98 as he wins 3 rings in a row and there&rsquo;s no more challenges to fulfill for himself anymore.</p>

<p>But to beat Father Time? To win as the quote-unquote owner of the team? To win with a group of guys that he probably had a hand in acquiring, for the first time in his career? To win when everyone else says you&rsquo;re too old, your team sucks, when you&rsquo;ve already done everything, won everything, made all of the money, etc? I can see why he took on that challenge.</p>

<p>Dumb fans look at those two years as though he tarnished his legacy. In reality, he tried to come back so quickly in that first season that he developed unbearable knee tendinitis but was still able to play at a high level, and then his second season he had a legitimately very good season and PLAYED ALL 82 GAMES. Efficiency wasn&rsquo;t that great, but the whole league suffered there in this particular era.</p>

<p>Yeah, the athleticism was not the same. He was really fucking strong, though, and was more of a forward by this time. His footwork was impeccable, he had those great instincts, he could feel how others were playing him and had the perfect counters. He played a ton of iso ball, but so did everyone else. And he could still wind up those legs and get up in the air, when needed. That one block (was it against Ron Artest?) where he pins/catches it on the backboard is some amazing oracle-like shit</p>

<p>As I grow older as an NBA fan in my 40s now, I gain more respect for Jordan as the years ago on. I&rsquo;ve played a lot of basketball, and I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of incredible players, both on tv and in person, but no one matched the confidence and eagerness for a challenge like Jordan. A lot of people since Jordan have tried to mimic this but no one has matched it, at least to me. Younger fans think of Kobe this way but I think it&rsquo;s different when you&rsquo;re chasing someone like Kobe was with Jordan, or emulating. Jordan was out there doing that shit by himself, on a Bulls team that was a poverty franchise, with bad management, bad ownership, all of these statements stand the test of time before and after Jordan. That organization sucks. The fans come out to support them no matter what, but management finds a way to fuck it up. Despite all of these factors against him, Jordan won 6 god damn rings. Kobe, by contrast, went to a team that already had the best center in the league, by his third or so season he had the best coach in the league, the best GM maybe in history, and the classiest organization in the league&hellip; maybe in all of sports. Jordan painted the Mona Lisa and everyone else has been trying to paint copies of that Mona Lisa since</p>

<p>Nike wouldn&rsquo;t be the behemoth it is now if it weren&rsquo;t for him, even his iconic logo is cool.</p>

<p><a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt16419074/" target="_blank">The movie</a> about the creation of Nike’s Air Jordans is so much better than you’d expect.</p>

<p>I gave it a shot because Affleck is a consistently good director, and Matt Damon and Jason Bateman are eminently watchable.</p>

<p>I wasn’t expecting much, based on a premise which didn’t much interest me, but I was very pleasantly surprised.</p>

      <label for="lj5buou" class="commentText"><p>I find it unfathomable that people cannot see that he is still the greatest player to ever step foot on a basketball court. There are so many reasons why he is better than anyone else but I think the best way to encapsulate his insane career is the fact that almost all the great players the game has seen, who played 20 or so seasons, won roughly 60ish official NBA accolades. It took them <em>20 seasons</em> to collect that many. Jordan collected 68 in just 11 eligible seasons as a Bull. He was basically collecting them at twice the rate as all of the other all time greats. LeBron has 65 in 21 seasons as a comparison. Jordan would win another couple in his Wizards years to bring his career total to 70. That is the most accolades any player has on their resume. He also has more of the big four accolades (rings, MVP, FMVP, DPOY) than any other player and is second all time in combined 1st Team All NBA and All Defense nominations (to Duncan).<br>
I have LeBron second all time chiefly due to his insane longevity but that doesn&rsquo;t take away from the fact he still has yet to catch Jordan after playing nearly twice as long. That is a massive, massive point in Jordan&rsquo;s favour&hellip;the sheer avalanche of winning in such a relatively short time. And let&rsquo;s face it, not a single pro sports league would exist without the  sole purpose of handing out trophies to their players. So it&rsquo;s literally the most important aspect when comparing players&hellip;their ability to win, not just rings but everything else their sport awards its players. Nothing else comes close.</p>

He was actually featured in a Sports Illustrated article and Charles Barkley flew him out to a Bulls-Suns Finals game to try and get under the Bulls skin.  His name is Robin Ficker.  It was a hilarious article.</p>

If I remember the article correctly there was at least one anecdote of him getting hired and successfully triggering an opposing player into getting ejected.  This is a 25-30 year old article so I can’t remember fully.  I miss getting SI and Sporting News on a biweekly basis back then.</p>

I am not kidding. It was sitting on an IMDB rating of 7.0 for years, because, you know, it&rsquo;s a damn old movie and ratings pretty much always plateau after time. But after LeBron&rsquo;s movie bombed the OG Space Jam fell to 6.5. That is an unprecedented fall for such an old movie to suddenly experience. The only logical explanation is that LeBron stans review/rate bombed it out of spite. Which honestly is one of the most pathetic and embarrassing things I have ever seen a fan base do&hellip;</p>

Of the top 40 players in the bill simmons basketball pyramid (not saying the pyramid is perfect, just gives a approximate list of the best players ever in a reasonable order) only 2 non-bigs have a worse FT%. Those are Scottie Pippen and Barkley (who is 0.1% below Lebron).</p>

He wasn&rsquo;t much of a shooter early, but since his second Miami season he is 36% on 5 attempts per game. For comparison, someone like Jamal Crawford is 34.8% on 4.8 attempts per game for his career. J.R. Smith, a guy who really was just a shooter, averaged 37.3% on 5.3 attempts. Luka is at 34.7% and Harden is at 36.4%. So yeah, he can shoot well in general. Hell, Lillard is a top 3 shooter of this generation and is at 37.1%. Anyone who can shoot 36% on 5 3pa per game for a decade is a good shooter.</p>

<p>Also I didn&rsquo;t say Bron was a bad 3pt shooter per se, but he&rsquo;s a below average shooter in general when you factor in mid range as well.</p>

<p>So basically if you shoot eyes closed, it shouldn&rsquo;t be off center, but just short or long and that&rsquo;s where your legs come in. He&rsquo;s so fundamental</p>

      <label for="lj38844" class="commentText"><p>I was there and waited all game for MJ to do something spectacular. The Nuggets defended him hard for most of the game and he didn’t really have a chance to make any highlight plays. But the Bulls were winning late in the fourth and MJ had just stolen the ball on Denver’s final possession. You could feel the excitement in the Denver crowd despite knowing that their team was going to lose. MJ was on the breakaway and there was only one Nugget to beat.
But then that Nugget intentionally fouled him, wrapped him up, and robbed the crowd of the satisfaction of a highlight dunk. Despite being a die-hard Nuggets fan, I boo’d along with a good portion of the crowd. While making a free throw with his eyes closed was cool, I would have much preferred one of His Airness’ soaring dunks as the time expired.</p>

      <label for="lj4ab8o" class="commentText"><p>True MJ anecdote:</p>

<p>My brother went to one of his bball camps back in the mid/late 90s. Every day MJ would pick a random camper to try go around-the-world (several shots around the key, and 5 3s at different spots). If the camper managed to go through the whole thing without a single miss he’d get a pair of Jordan shoes that weren’t even officially released yet.</p>

<p>On the last day of camp he picked a camper, who of course missed on his 5th shot or something like that. Campers were frustrated and started complaining that it was an unfairly difficult challenge. MJ, wearing literally street clothes, having not shot a single shot all day, picks up a bball and proceeds to start going around-the-world.</p>

<p>He hits every single shot around the key, gets to the 3s and starts swishing those. MJ gets to the final 3, the anticipation is palpable, he looks at the camp and says “this is for you guys” and then drains it. Whole camp goes absolutely bananas.</p>

<p>Idk if anyone believes this or not, but my brother has never, ever been the kind of person to make stuff up or overly exaggerate. There’s a reason why MJ set the world on fire back in the day, the dude’s aurora was absolutely off the charts.</p>

      <label for="lj4iujx" class="commentText"><p>I can believe it, even shitty NBA shooters can generally nail outside shots the majority of the time against no / weaker opposition.</p>

<p>I recall a story of Birdman Anderson playing against some pretty talented guys who dominated big city rec leagues and playgrounds and basically just goofing around shooting elbow turnarounds and corner fadeways and hitting the vast majority of them. And this is a dude who is nearly forbidden to shoot outside of 10 feet even if not closely guarded in the pros.</p>

<p>Another time I saw the best HS players in the Austin area plus some dudes who were subs at Texas, Baylor, and a few other colleges in the area, all be unable to stop a dude in his 30s who&rsquo;d been out of the league for years after playing for 5 teams in 5 seasons and averaging like 3 ppg in the NBA. He just curled off screens and hit 3s at about a 67% rate and nobody could do anything to stop it.</p>

You have to remember that he played in an era with many of the best basketball players in the history of the league, yet there was never even a question of who was the best.  As good as some of the other players were (and many of them had reputations that got better post retirement), he was just like 5 levels above everyone else.</p>
