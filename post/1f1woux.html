      <p>Simple question. You never saw it coming.</p>

<p>To me it’s Brunson. Spent a million years in college as an undersized guard and then was a backup in Dallas. Now he’s an all-nba player. It’s truly amazing</p>

<p>But yah by nba athleticism standards this is a great pick still.</p>

      <label for="lk2zryt" class="commentText"><p>Thats how I feel about Trae Young (minus the strength). May not have the highest top speed or vertical but crazy start/stop and acceleration. I feel like the quickness of guards sometimes can be hard to appreciate from the broadcast angle. I got the chance to watch Trae play from 10 rows back and it was unbelievable to watch him casually move like 10 feet side to side damn near instantly during his crossover sizeup.</p>

On two separate occasions I had the chance to see manu ginobili back when he was peak spurs and jeremy Lin on the hornets team play live and the live broadcast doesn’t do them any justice. They are freaking fast and quick and sooooo shifty in person that it’s crazy! They aren’t even considered top tier guards and if they are this fast and shifty it’s hard to believe what top guards move like in real life</p>

He looked like an undersized non-shooter with tunnel vision going to the basket. I was getting vocally frustrating with his decision making. He rubbed me as exactly the type of player who shines against weak competition but would fall flat against NBA players. It seems my analysis was not only wrong, but practically the opposite end of spectrum on the type of NBA player he became. Props to him.</p>

      <label for="lk27mns" class="commentText"><p>Stephen fucking Curry</p>

<p>I remember when he had ankles made of glass and I never thought he&rsquo;d even be healthy enough to reach his peak. I&rsquo;m pretty sure he rolled his ankle just walking up the court one time.</p>

<p>I remember when Monta Ellis was traded away instead of Stephen Curry, a lot of NBA fans were surprised by that move.</p>

<p>Then he becomes an international star, changed the way an entire sport is played, dominated the league as the face of a dynasty. 4 time champion. Never would&rsquo;ve thought.</p>

      <label for="lk2v6d0" class="commentText"><p>If that&rsquo;s the same game I&rsquo;m thinking about, that was the game that solidified Steph as probably the greatest teammate we&rsquo;ll ever hear about. At that point he&rsquo;s just trying to get drafted, but he volunteered to stand in the corner so his teammates could play 4 on 3 and they could win the game. That&rsquo;s a lot of stats to sacrifice when the margins of draft position, especially a guy his size at the time, are so small.</p>

<p>We really have to wait and see. People didn’t put Curry top 10 until 2 seasons ago. Jokic has a lot of time to get there even if it’ll be tough.</p>

<p>Anybody who was really watching Monta saw the issue. He’s extremely talented but the play was inconsistent and came at the leagues arguable highest turnover rate at that time.</p>

<p>Very glass cannon type of situation that you can’t build championship basketball around imo.</p>

<p>But I agree that I never thought curry would be who is he is today. Truly remarkable player.</p>

<p>Most fans don’t really know what they’re watching, they don’t understand how teams are trying to attack and effect the game, they rarely know how offenses and defenses really function.</p>

<p>Some skills obviously really pop and winning / stats prove some things to average fans, but the NBA is filled with so many great players you can mentally make the case for just about anyone.</p>

      <label for="lk2mzja" class="commentText"><p>Yeah 100% this. I consider myself a hardcore fan, i have a great knowledge of old school players, if someone named me a random role player from the 90s or 2000s i’d be able to tell you every team he played for, where he went to college, for how many years, and where he got picked in the draft. Michael Doleac, Eddie Johnson, Jack Sikma, whoever, I know them.</p>

<p>Now as far as the plays that these teams are running? Offensive and defensive schemes? The intricate names of plays? I have no clue. All I know is Horns. When I watch a podcast like JJ Reddick and Lebron had, and they get into the details of the X’s and O’s, they may as well be speaking chinese to me</p>

      <label for="lk2eofr" class="commentText"><p>My buddy is one of the biggest basketball fans I know, and a huge Warriors fan. I vividly remember him telling me in 2011 that Monta Ellis was the future, and going to be the best PG in the league, surpassing Chris Paul, Derrick Rose, Deron Williams, every star. He was explaining that he thought the Warriors should trade Steph for assets, because Monta was a can&rsquo;t-miss future star.</p>

<p>I also remember arguing that the few Warriors games I&rsquo;d watched, Monta just kinda shot the ball a lot and missed a lot - and I was really into Grantland at the time (that was the first year, I bought the boxed set!!) and Bill Simmons and Zach Lowe weren&rsquo;t very high on Monta. Plus I&rsquo;d just seen Steph win the Skills Challenge at the All-Star weekend that year, and he seemed like he was pretty good. Really agile, great shooter, great handles. I&rsquo;d heard about the ankles, but he really looked pretty solid. I barely thought about Curry again until the next year when suddenly Steph was the starter and that team was near the top of the west.</p>

<p>Anyways, you&rsquo;re not alone. That buddy is still one of the most informed and avid basketball fans I know, and he was arguing pretty hard for Monta Ellis that day, and watched an awful lot more Warriors basketball than me.</p>

One of the best defenders to ever play the game and over 18 rebounds per game at his peak. As much notoriety as he gets for his antics and being on great teams, I actually think he’s still underrated, and those Pistons don’t win those rings without him</p>

<p>Nah, the year of the championship and after he showed enough that Bucks fans knew we probably couldn&rsquo;t afford to give him a decent FA contract which is why he was traded.</p>

<p>the dude reached best player on a finals team 2x heights</p>

<p>and he was fucking phenomenal in the 2020 finals, only player ever in the finals to outscore, rebound, and assist LeBron in a game</p>

<p>that bucks series is one of the most insane demolitions i had ever seen, he dominated Jrue</p>

<p>and he had that huge game in boston on one knee</p>

<p>i always been doubting him i guess lmao cause i remember when the bulls offered him like <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>48</sub> and he turned it down and i was like oof what a bad decision and then of course he breaks out and gets a <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>90</sub> or <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>90</sub> i can&rsquo;t remember rn</p>

      <label for="lk2fnlt" class="commentText"><p>Even him becoming an all-star caliber player was a great surprise to me as a Bulls fan. He was a reliable starter that was a great defender but he exploded out of no where. I remember during the 2015 preseason games his scoring output and efficiency suddenly went way up. Specifically he made a game winner against a team I don’t remember to cap off a 30 point night (back then 30 was a lot) and the look on his face-combined with the way the team embraced him afterwards. I was like damn-something has shifted. He’s a different guy now- it’s not a hot streak. That he would lead finals teams and be the primary defender on the Lebrons, Paul George’s and Kawhi’s of the world is still crazy to me</p>

<p>He was not a decent defender for us lol. He was a great defender for the spurs. I honestly don&rsquo;t think his defense is much different now than it was his last few years with the spurs.</p>

<p>Of course players usually still improve after those years which is why peak prime is like 27-30ish but I’m just saying it’s very rare for guys to have meteoric level ups in their late 20s. The Lowry’s and Whites are moreso the exception</p>

Pop had a famous quote of not knowing who the hell Manu even was when he showed up to training camp his rookie season, just trusted in his front office/RC Buford/scouts.</p>

<p>That said, my answer is Derrick White. I wish we never traded him. He always clearly had handles and talent with the Spurs, but he&rsquo;s just skyrocketed since we traded him to the Celtics compared to what most thought of his potential.</p>

      <label for="lk2oi4x" class="commentText"><p>Actually insane how refined his offensive game became. At his peak/when he’a healthy that jumpshot is as automatic as it gets and his handle is so tight and effective, literally never see him get stripped and always gets to his spots. I always like to point to that sixers series in 2019 when Philly was lowkey absolutely stacked defensively with all-defence Ben Simmons, Jimmys defensive prime, Tobias Harris who was a very good wing defender and Embiid sitting in the paint. Kawhi was still scoring whenever the heck he wanted.</p>

<p>Honestly even though he’s a hall of famer he’s still one of the biggest what ifs in nba history. If he had good or even just decent durability in his knees he’s in the tier right under bron and mj all time. That’s how fkn good peak Kawhi is on both ends.</p>

      <label for="lk2vstl" class="commentText"><p>I think Middleton is super interesting for this kind of conversation. Like, somebody like Giannis came in even rawer, or somebody like Jokic came in even less heralded, and both of those examples have reached peaks way above Middleton. But with those guys in retrospect, it&rsquo;s like yeah the size/skill was always there. They are 1 of 1s and while you maybe didn&rsquo;t expect them to get as good as they did, you also aren&rsquo;t expecting anybody else to suddenly become them.</p>

<p>Khris Middleton though&hellip; you look at his career trajectory, and it&rsquo;s so easy to pick some random 3&amp;D role player and be like &ldquo;why couldn&rsquo;t he become Khris Middleton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>If you went back over the past many seasons and asked me how many times I was wrong about somebody being the next Giannis/Jokic (once we had an idea of who they are), well&hellip; I was never wrong because I was never predicting that. But all the times I thought somebody like Royce O&rsquo;Neale (should have realized his age as a rookie) could turn into Khris Middleton? Those have started to add up.</p>

      <label for="lk2axha" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, obviously somebody like Jokic is the real answer based on where he was drafted, but there was a lot of pressure and criticism on Jaylen from the night he was drafted. The 2016 draft was a 2 man draft and from 3-8 could have been anyone from Brown to Chriss to Bender to Hield. Not only did the Celtics select the correct guy at that #3 spot, but he actually did grow to be everything they could have hoped for based on his athletic profile.</p>

<p>So from a how good you expected them to be based on where they were drafted, no, not even close. But from a scrutiny and expectation point of view, Jaylen actually did do it. He became an All-NBA level player and Finals MVP.</p>

<p>Dudes ankles were made out of jelly when he was coming into the league. He was a huge red flag, and Warriors gambled and double down on him. It’s a win-win of course with him signing a cheaper contract and them being able to build around that contract.</p>

<p>The fact that he was able to develop into a legitimate #1 option despite being on some pretty fucking awful teams with no organizational consistency around him in his first few years as an 18-22 year old is nothing short of a miracle</p>

<ol>
<li>Steph after Monta was traded.</li>
<li>James Harden once he became a Rocket.</li>
<li>SGA after he came to OKC.</li>
<li>Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker in general.</li>
<li>Joel Embiid when he finally played in 2016 after 2 years of injury recovery.</li>
<li>Ben Wallace and Dennis Rodman impacting the game without having much of an offensive presence.</li>
<li>Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown, Swipa Fox, Anthony Davis and Bam Adebayo once they improved their shooting/offensive arsenal.</li>
<li>Tyrese Haliburton after he was traded to Indiana.</li>
<li>Dame coming from Weber State, but lighting up the league with (deep) 3 pointers since his Rookie Year.</li>
<li>Donovan Mitchell was good in college, but really impressed me since his Rookie year.</li>
<li>Brunson - as mentioned before.</li>
<li>Devin Booker becoming the scorer he is after averaging 10PPG in Kentucky and only a bit more in his Rookie year.</li>
<li>Trae Young as I personally thought he&rsquo;d be another Salim Stoudamire.</li>

<p>I was in the media room (for Roundball Mining Company - Truehoop) that draft, and after nobody had any questions left after asking a lot about Gary Harris and Jusuf Nurkic and a little about the salary cap, Tim Connelly was like &ldquo;someone should ask a question about our second round pick!&rdquo;  One of the reporters on the other side of the room from me goes &ldquo;tell us about the kid you picked in the second round&rdquo; and TC gushed about how he thought he got a steal out of Jokic, and that in a couple years he could be a meaningful rotation player.  Nobody had any idea he could be more than a useful bench player.  3-time MVP + finals MVP?  41st picks aren&rsquo;t supposed to be that, ever.</p>

<p>Watched him as a rookie on the process Sixers teams and loved his game. Wasn’t sure he’d get a shot anywhere else on a team that wasn’t tanking. Hard to assess talent on those horrid teams.
He’s made himself into one of the best 6th men in the league and awesome playmaker. Scrappy defender. His effort level has always and will always be at 110%.</p>

      <label for="lk2kziu" class="commentText"><p>Joel Embiid. I don&rsquo;t think many thought he was going to actually stay in the NBA with his injuries let alone win an MVP.</p>

<p>Most had him written off as Greg Oden 2.0 not dropping 70 in a game.</p>

      <label for="lk2w268" class="commentText"><p>Malik Monk. He is REALLY good on Sac, like if they didn&rsquo;t have Fox he&rsquo;d have all-star numbers (not sure about all-star impact). He averaged 15.4 and 5.1 assists in 26 minutes a game off the bench. That&rsquo;s nuts.</p>

<p>The reason he&rsquo;s so unexpected is you&rsquo;d never think he could do that at the end of his rookie deal. He said himself he was on drugs most of his career, and he&rsquo;s only gotten this good because in the last two (three?) years he got off drugs. Once athletes are on drugs to the extent that their performance is that impacted four years into their careers, you&rsquo;d never think they could get clean and improve to that degree. Monk must be like one in a thousand, at best, among professional athletes. Combined with the odds of making the NBA/NFL/MLB, he&rsquo;s literally like one in a million.</p>
