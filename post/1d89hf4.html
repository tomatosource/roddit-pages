NBA Player Warned Co-Conspirators in Group Chat That They &lsquo;might just get hit with a rico&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <blockquote>
<p>A criminal complaint was filed today in federal court in Brooklyn charging Long Phi Pham, also known as “Bruce,” with conspiring with others to defraud a sports betting company (Betting Company 1) by placing “under prop” bets on a National Basketball Association (NBA) player (Player 1) in NBA games on January 26, 2024 and on March 20, 2024. Pham was arrested on Monday and made his initial appearance this afternoon before United States Magistrate Judge Cheryl L. Pollak. Pham was ordered detained pending trial. Three co-conspirators charged in the scheme remain at large.</p>

<p><strong>The Betting Scheme</strong></p>

<p>As alleged in the complaint, Pham and his co-conspirators placed “under prop” bets on Player 1’s performance in two NBA games, knowing in advance that Player 1 planned to withdraw from those games for purported health reasons. A “prop,” or proposition bet is a wager placed on a player’s performance, rather than the outcome of the game. For example, a betting platform could offer users a wager that a player would score more (referred to as betting the “over”) or fewer (betting the “under”) points than a certain number of points designated by the betting platform for a given game.</p>

A “prop,” or proposition bet is a wager placed on a player’s performance, rather than the outcome of the game. For example, a betting platform could offer users a wager that a player would score more (referred to as betting the “over”) or fewer (betting the “under”) points than a certain number of points designated by the betting platform for a given game.</p>

<p><strong>The January 26, 2024 Game</strong></p>

<p>In early 2024, Player 1 had amassed large gambling debts to certain of the co-conspirators. Player 1 was encouraged to clear those debts by withdrawing from certain games prematurely to ensure that under prop bets on Player 1’s performance were successful. On January 22, 2024, Player 1 sustained a purported eye injury during a game. He was evaluated and diagnosed with a corneal abrasion, but was not placed on the NBA injury list. Shortly before the game on January 26, 2024 (the January 26 Game) Player 1 told the defendant that he would be removing himself early from the game, claiming that he was injured. Player 1 entered the January 26 Game midway through the first quarter. After playing just four minutes and recording zero points, three rebounds and one assist, Player 1 removed himself from the game after he complained to team officials that he had reaggravated the eye injury.</p>

<p>Player 1’s performance in several statistical categories during the January 26 Game was under the designated amounts set by Betting Company 1 in its prop bets related to Player 1. Thus, several bettors, including co-conspirators, who wagered the “under” on prop bets related to Player 1’s performance for the January 26 Game won those bets.
For example, a relative of a co-conspirator placed a <span class="math inline">\(10,000 parlay bet through Betting Company 1 on the “under” for Player 1’s three pointers, assists and steals. As a result of Player 1 removing himself from the January 26 game, the bet was successful and the relative won \)</span>85,000 (netting a profit of <span class="math inline">\(75,000). Additionally, a co-conspirator placed a \)</span>7,000 parlay bet through Betting Company 1 on the “under” for Player 1’s three pointers, points, assists and rebounds. As a result of Player 1 removing himself from the January 26 Game, the bet was successful and the co-conspirator won <span class="math inline">\(40,250 (netting a profit of \)</span>33,250).</p>

<p><strong>The March 20, 2024 Game</strong></p>

<p>Prior to a game on March 20, 2024 (the March 20 Game), Pham and his co-conspirators discussed in a Telegram group chat that Player 1 would be removing himself early from the game, claiming that he felt ill. They agreed to share the profits for money won on successful under bets placed on Player 1, and that Pham would receive approximately 24% of the profits. On March 20, 2024, Pham and his co-conspirators met at a casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and placed several bets on Player 1. After playing just three minutes and recording zero points, three rebounds and zero assists, Player 1 removed himself from the March 20 Game, complaining he felt ill. Several bettors, including the co-conspirators, who wagered the under on prop bets related to Player 1’s performance won those bets. In total, the defendant and his co-conspirators netted over $1 million in profits.</p>

<p>On April 4, 2024, in a group chat between Player 1 and the conspirators, Player 1 wrote to the group that they “might just get hit w a rico,” referring to a racketeering charge, and asked if the group chat participants had “delete[d] all the stuff” from their personal cell phones.</p>

<p>This is some shite you&rsquo;d expect to read about in the 60s about how hand in hand the mob was with sports.</p>

<p>How much of an absolute <em>degenerate</em> gambler do you have to be to where you&rsquo;re an NBA bench player that&rsquo;ll presumably get another contract, that you have to resort to throwing games to repay your gambling debts?</p>

<p>I mean I doubt the Nuggets would have hesitated to at least sign him to their G-League team as a favor to MPJ if absolutely no one else was interested in him, perhaps even sign him as the 15th bench player.</p>
