      <p>Zach Lowe on his podcast today:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Spurs had a positive scoring margin when Wembanyama and Devin Vassell played together, the 22 win San Antonio Spurs..were +4 per 100 possessions when Wembanyama and Tre Jones played together, that added up to +139 total points in like 1300 minutes. The 22 Win SAS were +9 per 100 possessions when Wembanyama, Tre Jones and Devin Vassell all played together. Wembanyama is going to be even better next year, perhaps by a lot than he was as a rookie. If you put competent NBA players around this dude next year this team is going to win 40 game. They might win 42, they might win 45, they might win 38, they’re going to be in the playoff race if they want to be.</p>

      <label for="lcaugln" class="commentText"><p>Statistically he is. Any spurs fan that actually believes Malaki And Blake will be on our team after the 2025 off-season are in denial. Two players that cant shoot (no, 34% from 3 doesn&rsquo;t justify being one of the worst defenders in the league), can&rsquo;t defend, cant playmake. They do nothing but slow the game down for our entire team once they check in. Wemby, Vassell, Sochan, and it&rsquo;s looking like Castle too are all actual NBA players. I&rsquo;m not convinced Blake and Malaki shouldnt still be in the G-League.</p>

Branham i think is just so flamable defensively that he would have to get amazing on offense to stick and i dont see that happening at all.</p>

      <label for="lcbed1c" class="commentText"><p>he’s honestly something like a 24ppg player if he tried drawing fouls more frequently and stopped playing so damn passively all the time. sometimes it feels like he isn’t even on the court and is deferring possessions to considerably worse teammates for some reason. i constantly watched him allow other mfs to take shots that should’ve been his just to throw up some dogshit three or garbage floater, when the only person that should be allowed to do that is Wemby. like come on Devin you are HIM bro, command that damn ball</p>

<p>last season Devin was averaging 15.5 field goal attempts and only 3 free throw attempts. especially considering our current roster construction, he needs at raise his FGA to something like 19.5 and take at least 6 free throws a game next season. he’s a fantastic shot creator and terrific at finishing around the rim, and i’d like to see him push for more of a load on the offensive end.</p>

<p>24/4/6 is possible and i hope he takes another step next year. his passing/assist game showed enormous strides too in the last few weeks of the season so i’m nothing but confident in that dude to improve</p>

<p>When the Spurs actually played their best 5 players together, only 2 5-man groups in the league had a higher net rating in more minutes, and only 2 more if you include all that played over 100 minutes together.</p>

<p>It is not huge numbers, and it is not to suggest that this is a great group, or close to the leagues best - and when I have heard Lowe make similar comments in previous podcasts, he is not making any wild statements about it.</p>

<p>It just saying that for a team that was otherwise horrendously shit all season, and historically bad defensively with Wemby off the floor,  it is a sign that there is a decent framework to be building this team off of.</p>

Sochan shared a lot of the playing time with Champagnie who was abysmal (or at least just doesn&rsquo;t fit with Sochan). Sochan+Wemby+Tre+Vassell is +3.3 with Champagnie and +15.6 without Champagnie (<a href="https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612759&amp;Season=2023-24&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=1641705,1630170,1631110,1630200,1630577" target="_blank">source</a>)</p>

<p>For a &ldquo;tiny&rdquo; sample - only 2 five-man lineups had a higher net-rating in more minutes (Philly, NY), and only 2 more if you include all 5-man groups that played more than 100 minutes (Cleveland, Milwaukee).</p>

<p>It is not about suggesting that this is a great 5-man unit, or one of the best in the league.</p>

<p>It is saying that, for a team that was otherwise shit all year, and had a 22-win season, there is a pretty good framework to build on for a successful Spurs team, around Wemby, in the not too distant future.</p>

<p>And these were not junk time minutes. Nor where they lineups in tanking games.</p>

      <label for="lccmmlv" class="commentText"><p>The Spurs had 41 clutch games last season and lost 28 of them. They had three small but key improvements this offseason, dropping their 3 G-Leaguers off the rotation and 1 was statistically the worst player in the league. Most games were close, and the beginning of the season was sandbagged hard. They will have an actual rotation of mostly NBA caliber players minus Zach Collins, they will have Wembanyama play more minutes, they won’t have Sochan playing point guard. In the end of last season they beat good teams and kept most games tight. Acting like their record last season is indicative of how good they will be next season after the 3 abominations in Cedi, Malaki and Blake are out and Champagnie a 3rd stringer now (73.8 min per game/30% of minutes)(not to mention McDermott is gone) will now never see the floor, improvements from young players especially Wemby, and better team spacing and team playmaking is disingenuous. Sure maybe they’ll miss the playoffs but saying they won’t even sniff a play in spot? You clearly have no clue what the Spurs actual problems were and why they were bad</p>

<p>The Pistons don&rsquo;t even have a positive 3 man lineup until you get to Killian Hayes/Duren/Stewart 1.9 over 288 minutes</p>

<p>All they gotta do these next few years is just continue to acquire good talent as they build around Wemby.</p>

      <label for="lccbyxe" class="commentText"><p>Probably, but I also think they did it because they did genuinely want the on ball reps for Sochan. He did and does need to improve his comfort with the ball/playmaking to fully reach his offensive ceiling, so I understood it, but it went against the idea that the season was going to be a more competitive one. But this year, it&rsquo;s clear they&rsquo;re taking off the training wheels.</p>

      <label for="lccbetn" class="commentText"><p>Spurs played at like a 30-32 win pace the last quarter of the season. Not great, but they were a competent team the last couple of months last season. Now they have upgraded from Jones to CP3, upgraded from Champagnie to Barnes, and Sochan is healthy. Sochan has work to do, but did take a step forward as the season went on.</p>

<p>Their bench will be improved naturally with Tre back to the bench. Castle is around now. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if Harrison Ingram earns minutes. Collins was better off the bench than as a starter by a significant margin in terms of net rating. His defensive deficiencies are less of a concern off the bench.</p>

<p>Spurs bench is still a below average group so if they struggle this year, that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;ll be, but it should be better than last season&rsquo;s group. If Wemby put up the numbers he did under a minutes restriction. If he plays 34 minutes a game this year with the +/- impact he had on the Spurs as a raw rookie? They&rsquo;re gonna be spunky if nothing else.</p>

      <label for="lccoaly" class="commentText"><p>Harrison Ingram might not make the roster. But thank you for noting about how they weren’t a dumpster fire at the end of the season and actually saw improvement like everyone in this thread is pretending didn’t happen. But I would like to add on. Not only will their bench “naturally improve” they god damn gutted it. The 6, 8, 9, and 10th players with the most played minutes won’t be in the rotation/are completely gone now. Cedi is gone, McDermott is gone, Malaki, Blake, and Champagnie won’t see a fraction of their minutes from last season if any. Those are 3 cancerous defenders gone. Instead CP3, Castle, and Barnes take their spots. Hopefully Mamu gets the role he earned at the end of the season. The fact that we aren’t completely out of the game the minute the bench would roll in is going to be huge to the record.</p>

      <label for="lccpdpu" class="commentText"><p>Maybe a two way. He&rsquo;ll be around in some capacity for sure, unquestionably.</p>

<p>Everything else is of course spot on&hellip;Spurs have added talent this offseason and eliminating their most negative players from the rotation or roster entirely, and the combination of the two is gonna make this team a much better squad than the one we saw last season. They played at a 30-32 win pace with abjectively negative players around and few genuinely quality vets. Definitely think Lowe is onto something about what the Spurs could achieve this season.</p>
