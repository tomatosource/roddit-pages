    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>From Dieter Kurtenbach:  <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/07/01/kurtenbach-klay-thompson-is-gone-and-the-warriors-situation-has-gone-from-bad-to-worse/" target="_blank">https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/07/01/kurtenbach-klay-thompson-is-gone-and-the-warriors-situation-has-gone-from-bad-to-worse/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It wasn‚Äôt that long ago when the ‚Äúlightyears ahead‚Äù Warriors wanted to be the next iteration of Spurs ‚Äî good for two-plus decades. To do that, they‚Äôd have ‚Äútwo timelines‚Äù that would allow them to win now and win later.</p>

<p>That plan never panned out.</p>

<p>And now they‚Äôre left with no timelines.</p>

<p>No matter what you thought about Thompson‚Äôs efficacy last season, the Warriors letting him walk out the door for only a traded player exception (worth roughly $16 million) is roster malpractice.</p>

<p>Mike Dunleavy Jr. was hired as the Warriors‚Äô general manager on June 16, 2023. That was nearly a year to the day the Warriors won the 2022 NBA title.</p>

<p>Dunleavy inherited some problems, no doubt, but in the 382 days since he took over, he turned Thompson, Jordan Poole, and a first-round pick into nothing more than a steaming pile of funny money.</p>

<p>In short, he has ensured the Warriors won‚Äôt win another title with Steph Curry leading the way.</p>

<p>Coming into this offseason, the writing was on the wall: someone was going. The NBA‚Äôs new collective bargaining agreement made the Warriors‚Äô previous spending habits far too onerous to maintain.</p>

<p>For Dunleavy, the choice was simple: can lose Thompson or you can waive Paul.</p>

<p>As disappointing as both of them were last season, the Warriors couldn‚Äôt lose both for nothing and maintain whatever competitiveness they had.</p>

<p>And yet that‚Äôs exactly what happened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are there any Warriors fans who are fond of how Dunleavy has managed the former championship team?</p>

      <label for="lb77nc9" class="commentText"><p>I think the main lesson we should take away from this whole Klay fiasco is that sometimes you can offend players and destroy the entire relationship by doing things you think are &ldquo;smart&rdquo; and &ldquo;fair.&rdquo; Half of being a GM is knowing when you can push those limits. Poole probably would not take kindly to getting clocked in the face and then being told to wait on an extension after helping them win another championship.</p>

      <label for="lb78btm" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s basically how our beat reporters interpreted it in a recent podcast (their interpretation, not hard reporting, to be clear). Herro set Poole&rsquo;s number higher than the Warriors wanted and then Draymond forced them to act instead of letting it fester in the locker room. Probably got him an extra few million per year versus waiting. Maybe a lot more than a few million if his fall off was gonna happen anyway</p>

I know they‚Äôre still trying to compete but they let a legend go who prolly deserved to have his entire career with the warriors. I‚Äôd like to point out most ‚Äúwarriors‚Äù fans are actually just Steph fans and who root for the team that Steph plays on</p>

Apparently Poole was busting his ass in practice talking his talk and the next day draymond came in pissed about something, ended up being family issues with his wife and kids, and he pretty much let it out on Poole who didn&rsquo;t actually say anything that day. I can&rsquo;t remember what the article was called or even who published it but I remember it came out some time after they traded Poole</p>

They didn&rsquo;t expect he would take the payout and still hold a grudge, which is funny and what GS deserves for not even punishing Draymond seriously.</p>

<p>Draymond&rsquo;s behaviour turns everyone into a bunch of battered housewives defending their violent thug husband.</p>

      <label for="lb8fe1c" class="commentText"><p>Kurtenbach&rsquo;s take is a steaming pile of horseshit that completely ignores the fucking reality of the Warriors&rsquo; situation. This dipshit is acting like Dunleavy should&rsquo;ve pulled a goddamn miracle out of his ass. The Warriors were so far over the cap it&rsquo;s not even funny, with aging stars on massive contracts and a new CBA designed to fuck teams like them six ways from Sunday. What the hell was Dunleavy supposed to do? Wave a magic wand and make all their problems disappear?</p>

<p>Poole for CP3? Yeah, Poole&rsquo;s younger, but he plays defense like a fucking turnstile. CP3 might be old as dirt, but at least he knows which end of the court to defend. That first-round pick? Used to get some vets who can actually contribute now, because, newsflash asshole, they&rsquo;re trying to win while Curry&rsquo;s still breaking ankles and draining threes from the parking lot. Letting Klay walk? Yeah, it sucks donkey balls, but have you seen his stats lately? Paying him big money would&rsquo;ve fucked the team&rsquo;s future harder than a porn star on payday. And let&rsquo;s not forget, Dunleavy&rsquo;s kept Curry, Green, and Wiggins together. You know, the core of a team that&rsquo;s won more championships than Kurtenbach&rsquo;s had hot meals.  This whole article reads like Kurtenbach&rsquo;s trying to stir up shit for clicks.</p>

<p>A real analysis would look at the clusterfuck Dunleavy walked into and the shit sandwich he&rsquo;s had to eat. But I guess &ldquo;Warriors GM makes tough but necessary decisions in challenging cap environment&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t get as many rage-clicks as &ldquo;Warriors are doomed, everyone panic!&rdquo; Fuck off with that noise, Kurtenbach. Maybe try some actual journalism next time instead of this reactionary bullshit.</p>

<p>He saw the writing on the wall. Aging stars and insufficient young talent to offset it, plus an especially awkward contract negotiation with Klay one year out that would probably fracture the org‚Äôs relationship with one of its most important players ever.</p>

      <label for="lb7fw28" class="commentText"><p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not entirely Bob&rsquo;s fault. Poole was in line to receive that contract regardless to be our future. The Draymond punch ruined that. And the Wiggins contract was a bargain at signing. And he was excellent to start the year. But then his dad&rsquo;s health issues and his own injury derailed him. And then Klay&rsquo;s ego started inflating. It&rsquo;s crazy how much shit went down to bring the Warriors down.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t blame Bob for leaving and I don&rsquo;t blame him that much for this mess. Yeah he was fucking up draft picks but he still got us that 4th ring.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not a coincidence everything is going to shit after he left.  The team can dwindle off into the sunset without going to shit, this team is currently turning into a fresh dog shit on a summer day.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt blame him for leaving either, but to say it‚Äôs not his fault also isn‚Äôt true.  If you‚Äôre the glue that holds it together and you peace out, it‚Äôs on you that it crumbled.</p>

<p>He tried to gey Paul George, but the Clippers said fuck that and just let George walk for nothing. He&rsquo;s trying to gey Markennen, but is limited by the assets he has and ownership desire to cut costs.</p>

<p>Lack of assets and lack of funds make it a hell of a lot harder to retool an aging roster with a bunch of 1 dimensional players. In today&rsquo;s NBA, having guys thay are either black holes on one end of the court mean you&rsquo;re just down a player. There are few guys good enough to make up for it.</p>

<p>Kurtenbach is being disingenuous by pretending otherwise and it&rsquo;s not like Poole was in demand after his 22-23 season and playoffs. It sucks they couldn&rsquo;t trade CP3 for anything but I&rsquo;m not sure why anyone would want him at that salary - the Spurs got him for far less as a FA.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t speak to the Klay situation&hellip;maybe Dunleavy contributed to the bad feelings or something&hellip;.but I&rsquo;m not sure what kind of market he expected for an aging/declining player. It&rsquo;s a lot easier to yell about &ldquo;not getting something/more&rdquo; in such cases than it is to actually do it.</p>

      <label for="lb9wtin" class="commentText"><p>For reference, of players who 1) Played 1000 minutes and 2) have played more than 2 seasons, the 2nd lowest Win Shares last season was Zhaire Williams as 0.2. Poole finished at -0.6. He was arguably the least valuable non rookie in the league, and that is before you start talking about his contract. Even though it ended up being a 1 year rental for Paul, the Warriors easily won that trade, and its not close.</p>

      <label for="lb75yak" class="commentText"><p>He basically turned the poole contract from 4 years to 1 for a 2030 heavily protected pick, thats pretty good. Seems like Klay was leaving no matter what GSW did. Dunleavy literally tried trading for LeBron, PG13, teams just don&rsquo;t want to deal with them. Also drafted 2 top 10 rookies outside the lottery in a year, i think hes done pretty good despite the situation he was put in.</p>

      <label for="lb98f14" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s hard to evaluate a GM in general because you never know quite what they are being asked to do.¬†¬†</p>

<p>The Warriors look a little manic because they were apparently willing to commit 200M to Paul George yet it seems the mission has actually been to cut costs.</p>

<p>Dunleavy has got off the Poole and Thompson contracts.¬† They are likely¬† a worse team right now because of it but honestly they didn&rsquo;t look capable of winning with at any point in the last 2 years.¬†</p>

<p>Hard to imagine a soft reset like this leads anywhere but they can&rsquo;t fully blow it up while Steph is there.¬†</p>

<p>So you sort of come back to putting yourself in a position where you might have got Paul George or maybe the next one.¬†</p>

<p>This is such a horseshit article. ‚ÄúSome problems‚Äù? MDJ inherited a team that had Klay and Poole making over $70M. And this is right before a new CBA kicked in that was specifically designed to screw them over.</p>

<p>In his first year on the job, MDJ got one of the worst contract in the league completely off our books without giving up any meaningful assets, and he also nailed his draft picks.</p>

Like, yeah, the 1st timeline got too old. That&rsquo;s the entire point of two timelines. The problem is that Bob Myers left him with the following &ldquo;2nd timeline&rdquo; players:</p>

<p>Jordan Poole</p>

<p>James Wiseman (was already traded)</p>

<p>Moses Moody</p>

<p>Jonathan Kuminga</p>

<p>Patrick Baldwin Jr.</p>

<p>Ty Jerome</p>

<p>and the 19th overall pick.</p>

<p>The biggest problem is that out of the entire 2nd timeline, there&rsquo;s really only one decent starter and maybe 2 decent bench players. Even the best GM couldn&rsquo;t build a timeline out of 3 rotation players and no stars.</p>

<p>Poole regressed badly the following season. Whether being punched by Draymond had anything to do with it, I don&rsquo;t know. All I know is that all his weaknesses became glaringly obvious. Dunleavy didn&rsquo;t waste a second at that point and got off his huge contract as best he could.</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s like come on, these are the resources the front office has to work with, they&rsquo;re going to try to do the best they can with what they have. clearly they want to get good players and make great trades and develop their decent guys into all stars but you can&rsquo;t just snap your fingers and make things happen. in the real world, you work with what you got and hope for the best</p>

<p>And CP3 was on a terribly overpriced contract.  NO ONE wanted him for 30 million.  He could not be traded.  That&rsquo;s why he signed with the Spurs for 11 million.</p>

      <label for="lb7diww" class="commentText"><p>I mean there isn&rsquo;t much that Dunleavy could have done with this whole Thompson fiasco. Thompson has been in Golden State his whole career and has had a change of heart because he simply just doesn&rsquo;t wanna hear it from the fans. He struggled mightily at times and the fandom didn&rsquo;t appreciate it. I mean how could a fan be cool with a guy making near $40 million and be useless unless he is shooting and making 3&rsquo;s?</p>

<p>Needless to say Klay&rsquo;s contract last year was bad. Albatross level. Poole&rsquo;s rookie extension kicked in at the start of last year and that was done before Dunleavy even got hired. He cannot do anything about that at all.</p>

<p>Waiving Paul was the smart move anyways. No reason to have a backup PG, who doesn&rsquo;t really fit well with Curry due to massive defensive problems on the other end, get paid over 30 million dollars. That&rsquo;s just bad resource allocation.</p>

<p>Now they are under the luxury tax but that team isn&rsquo;t going to be good at all next year. Draymond is still going to be able to bring drama to the team and keep them in the spotlight due to his antics while Curry is likely to go god mode and drop a 35 point per game season next year at age 36 because there simply isn&rsquo;t anyone on that roster that can score the ball. Wiggins is going to have to come back to form after a disaster class season and average at least 20 a night to help Curry out.</p>

Sucks curry is gonna be wasted 1 more year but reset the tax, next summer either kumiga made the leap to being the 2nd option they need or they can trade him + picks to upgrade and go all in for curry&rsquo;s last years. Running it back with klay would be a fun retirement tour i guess, but if they want to win anytime soon, they needed this year for a soft rebuild.</p>

<p>The comparison to the Spurs is fine, but the talent level now compared to the early aughts isn‚Äôt possible. The league is so talented that even the G league is loaded. No matter how well they draft, 10 other teams are just as savvy. And too many are hitting their stride.</p>

I believe the warriors offered Klay fair money. He got a max contract after tearing his ACL, and then missed an entire season with Achilles tear.
I just find it ridiculous how he feels slighted by the money offered, and signs for less, knowing that his quality of play has diminished.
Very sour tasting breakup.</p>

<p>He couldn&rsquo;t do anything about Klay either. Maybe you could argue he should&rsquo;ve traded Klay? But there is no way you trade a legend like him unless he demanded a trade. Plus his value probably wasn&rsquo;t much either. Dunleavy offered Klay a more than fair contract, but he can&rsquo;t force Thompson to take that.</p>

<p>Losing Klay rather than paying him too much is a good move too but if you have curry on your team, you need to be all in every season and that‚Äôs not the vibe from them atleast since they won the chip</p>

Especially Poole, which is funny because apparently everyone doesn‚Äôt have a problem with Draymond but as soon as Poole starts yapping off with his swag level at 1000 after helping the franchise win the 4th championship and secure a bigger bag than any of the big 3 all before the age of 25. Now he‚Äôs an issue and no one can stand him‚Ä¶</p>

<p>All while Draymond is giving Joe Lacob the biggest Hawk Tuah crying and bitching about a contract. The warriors shoulda just drafted Ball for future trade ammo and sent Klay and Draymond packing 2 years ago, But I digress.</p>

      <label for="lb797i9" class="commentText"><p>As said in the piece/quotes above, honestly it was the two timelines debacle that has really set the Warriors back. The Wiseman pick was the homerun selection that completely backfired. They missed on so many draft picks as well when they were at their best; that&rsquo;s come back to cost them. So when things got tight with the cap which the Warriors kinda knew would happen and knew ultimately KD wasn&rsquo;t gonna be there indefinitely, they didn&rsquo;t really have the ability to internally replace. Their core got older, their bench aged out, and they haven&rsquo;t been able to replace internally, while not having the cap space or assets to replace externally.</p>

<p>The Wiggins deal however ended up working out for the Warriors and he was a big reason they won a chip. They bet on him and he came through for them. But overall, this isn&rsquo;t solely on Dunleavy. It&rsquo;s been mistakes over the course of a long period of time, 5+ years.</p>

It‚Äôs not that we dumped Poole for Paul to get off that contact, it‚Äôs that we turned that we ultimately turned that max contract slot into nothing. We let our big two contact guys walk for absolutely nothing, which ensures that we stay under the tax while cashing in on the Curry cow.</p>

<p>The reason why we stayed competitive after Durant left was the D‚Äôlo slot that turned into Wiggins ‚Äî in this case though, we let 50 million walk off our books with no option to replace it.</p>

<p>Complete fan sabotage, but if you follow the warriors sub, it‚Äôs almost like they‚Äôre excited about returning to the dark ages lol. A truly desperate, sad place.</p>

<p>Curry is not some random star.  He&rsquo;s a once in a generation talent, literally the greatest player in the franchise&rsquo;s history, and this is a franchise that goes back to the start of the NBA.  And they&rsquo;re fucking up the end of his career for what, to &ldquo;rebuild&rdquo; in the future?  With what, there&rsquo;s no new Currys walking through that door.  With the exception of one fluke We Believe year, this bullshit franchise was in rebuild mode from 1994 until 2013 when Curry led them back to the playoffs.  Damn near 20 years of mediocrity.</p>

      <label for="lb7meau" class="commentText"><p>The warriors are officially cooked now. I‚Äôd like to see Steph finish his career there but honestly he might be too good to do that. Dirk and Kobe finished out but they fell off majorly by the end compared to Steph‚Äôs trajectory. He‚Äôs still a top 10 player.</p>

      <label for="lb7ptfr" class="commentText"><p>He also crushed the draft last year. And the whole point of the Poole trade was to dump salary so I‚Äôm not sure why that is a negative. In fact, Washington would probably have to trade 2 firsts to get off that Poole contract now</p>
