    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>From Dieter Kurtenbach:  <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/07/01/kurtenbach-klay-thompson-is-gone-and-the-warriors-situation-has-gone-from-bad-to-worse/" target="_blank">https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/07/01/kurtenbach-klay-thompson-is-gone-and-the-warriors-situation-has-gone-from-bad-to-worse/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It wasn‚Äôt that long ago when the ‚Äúlightyears ahead‚Äù Warriors wanted to be the next iteration of Spurs ‚Äî good for two-plus decades. To do that, they‚Äôd have ‚Äútwo timelines‚Äù that would allow them to win now and win later.</p>

<p>That plan never panned out.</p>

<p>And now they‚Äôre left with no timelines.</p>

<p>No matter what you thought about Thompson‚Äôs efficacy last season, the Warriors letting him walk out the door for only a traded player exception (worth roughly $16 million) is roster malpractice.</p>

<p>Mike Dunleavy Jr. was hired as the Warriors‚Äô general manager on June 16, 2023. That was nearly a year to the day the Warriors won the 2022 NBA title.</p>

<p>Dunleavy inherited some problems, no doubt, but in the 382 days since he took over, he turned Thompson, Jordan Poole, and a first-round pick into nothing more than a steaming pile of funny money.</p>

<p>In short, he has ensured the Warriors won‚Äôt win another title with Steph Curry leading the way.</p>

<p>Coming into this offseason, the writing was on the wall: someone was going. The NBA‚Äôs new collective bargaining agreement made the Warriors‚Äô previous spending habits far too onerous to maintain.</p>

<p>For Dunleavy, the choice was simple: can lose Thompson or you can waive Paul.</p>

<p>As disappointing as both of them were last season, the Warriors couldn‚Äôt lose both for nothing and maintain whatever competitiveness they had.</p>

<p>And yet that‚Äôs exactly what happened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are there any Warriors fans who are fond of how Dunleavy has managed the former championship team?</p>

      <label for="lb77nc9" class="commentText"><p>I think the main lesson we should take away from this whole Klay fiasco is that sometimes you can offend players and destroy the entire relationship by doing things you think are &ldquo;smart&rdquo; and &ldquo;fair.&rdquo; Half of being a GM is knowing when you can push those limits. Poole probably would not take kindly to getting clocked in the face and then being told to wait on an extension after helping them win another championship.</p>

      <label for="lb78btm" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s basically how our beat reporters interpreted it in a recent podcast (their interpretation, not hard reporting, to be clear). Herro set Poole&rsquo;s number higher than the Warriors wanted and then Draymond forced them to act instead of letting it fester in the locker room. Probably got him an extra few million per year versus waiting. Maybe a lot more than a few million if his fall off was gonna happen anyway</p>

<p>So, to OP&rsquo;s point, you know the issue between Poole and Draymond, why immediately sign Poole, just wait and see how it plays out, if Poole balls out no difference, if Poole and Draymond clash, you saved yourself from a mistake.</p>

      <label for="lb78ah0" class="commentText"><p>How is it selfish? Getting ring #4 alongside the Curry FMVP is the peak of the Warriors dynasty and he achieved all of the goals set forward by ownership. He can do whatever he wants after that, and it&rsquo;s a skill issue by Dunleavy for not realizing that Kuminga and Moody are worth more as trade pieces than they are as players for the Warriors going forward.</p>

      <label for="lb79uw6" class="commentText"><p>Because it seems he left a year ago to avoid facing the franchise‚Äôs current ugly situation.</p>

<p>Do you think he‚Äôd have left if he drafted Haliburton in 2020 and had a contender still?</p>

<p>He saw the writing on the wall. Aging stars and insufficient young talent to offset it, plus an especially awkward contract negotiation with Klay one year out that would probably fracture the org‚Äôs relationship with one of its most important players ever.</p>

      <label for="lb7fw28" class="commentText"><p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not entirely Bob&rsquo;s fault. Poole was in line to receive that contract regardless to be our future. The Draymond punch ruined that. And the Wiggins contract was a bargain at signing. And he was excellent to start the year. But then his dad&rsquo;s health issues and his own injury derailed him. And then Klay&rsquo;s ego started inflating. It&rsquo;s crazy how much shit went down to bring the Warriors down.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t blame Bob for leaving and I don&rsquo;t blame him that much for this mess. Yeah he was fucking up draft picks but he still got us that 4th ring.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not a coincidence everything is going to shit after he left.  The team can dwindle off into the sunset without going to shit, this team is currently turning into a fresh dog shit on a summer day.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt blame him for leaving either, but to say it‚Äôs not his fault also isn‚Äôt true.  If you‚Äôre the glue that holds it together and you peace out, it‚Äôs on you that it crumbled.</p>

<p>Kurtenbach is being disingenuous by pretending otherwise and it&rsquo;s not like Poole was in demand after his 22-23 season and playoffs. It sucks they couldn&rsquo;t trade CP3 for anything but I&rsquo;m not sure why anyone would want him at that salary - the Spurs got him for far less as a FA.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t speak to the Klay situation&hellip;maybe Dunleavy contributed to the bad feelings or something&hellip;.but I&rsquo;m not sure what kind of market he expected for an aging/declining player. It&rsquo;s a lot easier to yell about &ldquo;not getting something/more&rdquo; in such cases than it is to actually do it.</p>

It‚Äôs not that we dumped Poole for Paul to get off that contact, it‚Äôs that we turned that we ultimately turned that max contract slot into nothing. We let our big two contact guys walk for absolutely nothing, which ensures that we stay under the tax while cashing in on the Curry cow.</p>

<p>The reason why we stayed competitive after Durant left was the D‚Äôlo slot that turned into Wiggins ‚Äî in this case though, we let 50 million walk off our books with no option to replace it.</p>

<p>Complete fan sabotage, but if you follow the warriors sub, it‚Äôs almost like they‚Äôre excited about returning to the dark ages lol. A truly desperate, sad place.</p>

Seems like Klay was leaving no matter what GSW did. Dunleavy literally tried trading for LeBron, PG13, teams just don&rsquo;t want to deal with them. Also drafted 2 top 10 rookies outside the lottery in a year, i think hes done pretty good despite the situation he was put in.</p>

He essentially got out of the Poole contract (which Bob Myers gave) for nothing. Based on what we saw last year Klay clearly isn&rsquo;t good enough to start for a championship team and wasn&rsquo;t happy with moving to the bench. Sometimes the best move is by doing nothing even if you still have Curry on the team.</p>

<p>I call Kuminga a mistake cuz he&rsquo;s probably gonna be good this year and ask for a max. So you get like 1.5 years of arguable value out of him before you have to overpay and he&rsquo;s still not a great fit with the team. Compare that to Franz who was a god-tier fit from day one and would have given you 4 years of good value. If they had drafted LaMelo or Haliburton, they might not have even been able to afford paying their #7 pick a max on their next contract. That&rsquo;s always how I viewed it. If things worked out, #7 is gone after the rookie contract, so you want someone who will actually contribute. And that mindset is compatible with maximizing the championship window (which this upcoming year was supposed to be the last year of if they did things right).</p>

      <label for="lb7kul7" class="commentText"><p>A pile of funny money would be an amazing return for Jordan Poole.</p>

<p>Klay was leaving in FA. Getting anything back for him is a plus.</p>

<p>And the &ldquo;first round pick&rdquo; that we gave away is top 20 protected.</p>

<p>What a ridiculous article.</p>

      <label for="lb77yq6" class="commentText"><p>I mean he was in a pretty bad situation. Getting off that Poole contract was pretty good. He was basically a negative asset (kinda like lavine but a far worse player )</p>

<p>He couldn&rsquo;t do anything about Klay either. Maybe you could argue he should&rsquo;ve traded Klay? But there is no way you trade a legend like him unless he demanded a trade. Plus his value probably wasn&rsquo;t much either. Dunleavy offered Klay a more than fair contract, but he can&rsquo;t force Thompson to take that.</p>

      <label for="lb797i9" class="commentText"><p>As said in the piece/quotes above, honestly it was the two timelines debacle that has really set the Warriors back. The Wiseman pick was the homerun selection that completely backfired. They missed on so many draft picks as well when they were at their best; that&rsquo;s come back to cost them. So when things got tight with the cap which the Warriors kinda knew would happen and knew ultimately KD wasn&rsquo;t gonna be there indefinitely, they didn&rsquo;t really have the ability to internally replace. Their core got older, their bench aged out, and they haven&rsquo;t been able to replace internally, while not having the cap space or assets to replace externally.</p>

<p>The Wiggins deal however ended up working out for the Warriors and he was a big reason they won a chip. They bet on him and he came through for them. But overall, this isn&rsquo;t solely on Dunleavy. It&rsquo;s been mistakes over the course of a long period of time, 5+ years.</p>

It‚Äôs not that we dumped Poole for Paul to get off that contact, it‚Äôs that we turned that we ultimately turned that max contract slot into nothing. We let our big two contact guys walk for absolutely nothing, which ensures that we stay under the tax while cashing in on the Curry cow.</p>

<p>The reason why we stayed competitive after Durant left was the D‚Äôlo slot that turned into Wiggins ‚Äî in this case though, we let 50 million walk off our books with no option to replace it.</p>

<p>Complete fan sabotage, but if you follow the warriors sub, it‚Äôs almost like they‚Äôre excited about returning to the dark ages lol. A truly desperate, sad place.</p>

      <label for="lb7diww" class="commentText"><p>I mean there isn&rsquo;t much that Dunleavy could have done with this whole Thompson fiasco. Thompson has been in Golden State his whole career and has had a change of heart because he simply just doesn&rsquo;t wanna hear it from the fans. He struggled mightily at times and the fandom didn&rsquo;t appreciate it. I mean how could a fan be cool with a guy making near $40 million and be useless unless he is shooting and making 3&rsquo;s?</p>

<p>Needless to say Klay&rsquo;s contract last year was bad. Albatross level. Poole&rsquo;s rookie extension kicked in at the start of last year and that was done before Dunleavy even got hired. He cannot do anything about that at all.</p>

<p>Waiving Paul was the smart move anyways. No reason to have a backup PG, who doesn&rsquo;t really fit well with Curry due to massive defensive problems on the other end, get paid over 30 million dollars. That&rsquo;s just bad resource allocation.</p>

<p>Now they are under the luxury tax but that team isn&rsquo;t going to be good at all next year. Draymond is still going to be able to bring drama to the team and keep them in the spotlight due to his antics while Curry is likely to go god mode and drop a 35 point per game season next year at age 36 because there simply isn&rsquo;t anyone on that roster that can score the ball. Wiggins is going to have to come back to form after a disaster class season and average at least 20 a night to help Curry out.</p>

Sucks curry is gonna be wasted 1 more year but reset the tax, next summer either kumiga made the leap to being the 2nd option they need or they can trade him + picks to upgrade and go all in for curry&rsquo;s last years. Running it back with klay would be a fun retirement tour i guess, but if they want to win anytime soon, they needed this year for a soft rebuild.</p>
