      <p>From Dieter Kurtenbach:  <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/07/01/kurtenbach-klay-thompson-is-gone-and-the-warriors-situation-has-gone-from-bad-to-worse/" target="_blank">https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/07/01/kurtenbach-klay-thompson-is-gone-and-the-warriors-situation-has-gone-from-bad-to-worse/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It wasn’t that long ago when the “lightyears ahead” Warriors wanted to be the next iteration of Spurs — good for two-plus decades. To do that, they’d have “two timelines” that would allow them to win now and win later.</p>

<p>That plan never panned out.</p>

<p>And now they’re left with no timelines.</p>

<p>No matter what you thought about Thompson’s efficacy last season, the Warriors letting him walk out the door for only a traded player exception (worth roughly $16 million) is roster malpractice.</p>

<p>Mike Dunleavy Jr. was hired as the Warriors’ general manager on June 16, 2023. That was nearly a year to the day the Warriors won the 2022 NBA title.</p>

<p>Dunleavy inherited some problems, no doubt, but in the 382 days since he took over, he turned Thompson, Jordan Poole, and a first-round pick into nothing more than a steaming pile of funny money.</p>

<p>In short, he has ensured the Warriors won’t win another title with Steph Curry leading the way.</p>

<p>Coming into this offseason, the writing was on the wall: someone was going. The NBA’s new collective bargaining agreement made the Warriors’ previous spending habits far too onerous to maintain.</p>

<p>For Dunleavy, the choice was simple: can lose Thompson or you can waive Paul.</p>

<p>As disappointing as both of them were last season, the Warriors couldn’t lose both for nothing and maintain whatever competitiveness they had.</p>

<p>And yet that’s exactly what happened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are there any Warriors fans who are fond of how Dunleavy has managed the former championship team?</p>

      <label for="lb77nc9" class="commentText"><p>I think the main lesson we should take away from this whole Klay fiasco is that sometimes you can offend players and destroy the entire relationship by doing things you think are &ldquo;smart&rdquo; and &ldquo;fair.&rdquo; Half of being a GM is knowing when you can push those limits. Poole probably would not take kindly to getting clocked in the face and then being told to wait on an extension after helping them win another championship.</p>

      <label for="lb78btm" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s basically how our beat reporters interpreted it in a recent podcast (their interpretation, not hard reporting, to be clear). Herro set Poole&rsquo;s number higher than the Warriors wanted and then Draymond forced them to act instead of letting it fester in the locker room. Probably got him an extra few million per year versus waiting. Maybe a lot more than a few million if his fall off was gonna happen anyway</p>

If Poole was being a shit head, then GSW are morons for giving him the contract. If they believed Draymond would be a leader and squash it, they got burned big time, again, and not for the last time.</p>

<p>Like OP said, they could/should have waited to see how the situation would play out.</p>

<p>So, to OP&rsquo;s point, you know the issue between Poole and Draymond, why immediately sign Poole, just wait and see how it plays out, if Poole balls out no difference, if Poole and Draymond clash, you saved yourself from a mistake.</p>

<p>I know he deserves to ride off into the sunset given what he accomplished as GM but damn. He left his successor a pretty nightmarish situation for a new GM, and Dunleavy doesn’t have the credibility yet to withstand the depressing next few years for the organization.</p>

Getting ring #4 alongside the Curry FMVP is the peak of the Warriors dynasty and he achieved all of the goals set forward by ownership. He can do whatever he wants after that, and it&rsquo;s a skill issue by Dunleavy for not realizing that Kuminga and Moody are worth more as trade pieces than they are as players for the Warriors going forward.</p>

<p>Do you think he’d have left if he drafted Haliburton in 2020 and had a contender still?</p>

<p>He saw the writing on the wall. Aging stars and insufficient young talent to offset it, plus an especially awkward contract negotiation with Klay one year out that would probably fracture the org’s relationship with one of its most important players ever.</p>

<p>resolving the locker room is the coaches job. aren&rsquo;t that good? so we acting like Kuminga didn&rsquo;t immediately pop off once he called out Kerr to the media and was forced to give him minutes? or Moody who catches fire multiple times only to get benched or hit with a DNP the next game?</p>

<p>look at the play-in game. Moody was the Warriors 2nd leading scorer. guess how many Warriors players got more minutes than him</p>

<p>Kurtenbach is being disingenuous by pretending otherwise and it&rsquo;s not like Poole was in demand after his 22-23 season and playoffs. It sucks they couldn&rsquo;t trade CP3 for anything but I&rsquo;m not sure why anyone would want him at that salary - the Spurs got him for far less as a FA.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t speak to the Klay situation&hellip;maybe Dunleavy contributed to the bad feelings or something&hellip;.but I&rsquo;m not sure what kind of market he expected for an aging/declining player. It&rsquo;s a lot easier to yell about &ldquo;not getting something/more&rdquo; in such cases than it is to actually do it.</p>

      <label for="lb7bj8a" class="commentText"><p>That’s not the point of the column. It’s not that we dumped Poole for Paul to get off that contact, it’s that we turned that we ultimately turned that max contract slot into nothing. We let our big two contact guys walk for absolutely nothing, which ensures that we stay under the tax while cashing in on the Curry cow.</p>

<p>The reason why we stayed competitive after Durant left was the D’lo slot that turned into Wiggins — in this case though, we let 50 million walk off our books with no option to replace it.</p>

<p>Complete fan sabotage, but if you follow the warriors sub, it’s almost like they’re excited about returning to the dark ages lol. A truly desperate, sad place.</p>

      <label for="lb75u35" class="commentText"><p>Kurtenbach is a moron with some of the absolute worst takes in Bay Area sports media. You didn’t get nothing for Poole, you got a championship. Warriors don’t get that ring without him. He was the literal worst player in the league for 1.5 seasons, suddenly got very good, then regressed back to the mean. Any team in the league would take that. As for Klay, that’s a different story. We may never know went on behind the scenes last season and this offseason’s negotiations. </p>

If you weren&rsquo;t getting a deal done or trending in that direction, they should have dealt him for something last year. They oddly cared enough about him not to trade him for ANYTHING and yet had no intention of making a serious play to keep him. Just very odd.</p>

We&rsquo;re seeing the same thing with Lavine right now, who have been reported as being unable to trade Lavine even with a 1st round pick. The new CBA makes it so you can&rsquo;t fuck around with 40m players that aren&rsquo;t at an all-star level.</p>

<p>The extension thing is likely a combination of the Warriors making multiple moves to reduce their payroll (hence the apathy) and both parties wanting a fresh start.</p>

Also drafted 2 top 10 rookies outside the lottery in a year, i think hes done pretty good despite the situation he was put in.</p>

He essentially got out of the Poole contract (which Bob Myers gave) for nothing. Based on what we saw last year Klay clearly isn&rsquo;t good enough to start for a championship team and wasn&rsquo;t happy with moving to the bench. Sometimes the best move is by doing nothing even if you still have Curry on the team.</p>

<p>In his first year on the job, MDJ got one of the worst contract in the league completely off our books without giving up any meaningful assets, and he also nailed his draft picks.</p>

      <label for="lb7bjnn" class="commentText"><p>right?</p>

<p>the new cba was what screwed us.</p>

<p>and it’s so stupid how they say “spending habits”</p>

<p>uhh we drafted curry, we drafted draymond, we drafted klay, we drafted looney, we were able to turn kds expiring into wiggins. sorry we have an owner who was willing to pay the luxury tax but now the bill is too much due to the new cba.</p>

<p>maybe we should be a poverty franchise?</p>

      <label for="lb78edc" class="commentText"><p>Poole was a horrible contract that MDJ inherited.  He got that contract off our books quickly, while turning the last year of it into CP3 who helped us to have one of the best benches in the league last season.</p>

<p>And CP3 was on a terribly overpriced contract.  NO ONE wanted him for 30 million.  He could not be traded.  That&rsquo;s why he signed with the Spurs for 11 million.</p>

      <label for="lb77yq6" class="commentText"><p>I mean he was in a pretty bad situation. Getting off that Poole contract was pretty good. He was basically a negative asset (kinda like lavine but a far worse player )</p>

<p>He couldn&rsquo;t do anything about Klay either. Maybe you could argue he should&rsquo;ve traded Klay? But there is no way you trade a legend like him unless he demanded a trade. Plus his value probably wasn&rsquo;t much either. Dunleavy offered Klay a more than fair contract, but he can&rsquo;t force Thompson to take that.</p>

<p>Losing Klay rather than paying him too much is a good move too but if you have curry on your team, you need to be all in every season and that’s not the vibe from them atleast since they won the chip</p>

      <label for="lb797i9" class="commentText"><p>As said in the piece/quotes above, honestly it was the two timelines debacle that has really set the Warriors back. The Wiseman pick was the homerun selection that completely backfired. They missed on so many draft picks as well when they were at their best; that&rsquo;s come back to cost them. So when things got tight with the cap which the Warriors kinda knew would happen and knew ultimately KD wasn&rsquo;t gonna be there indefinitely, they didn&rsquo;t really have the ability to internally replace. Their core got older, their bench aged out, and they haven&rsquo;t been able to replace internally, while not having the cap space or assets to replace externally.</p>

<p>The Wiggins deal however ended up working out for the Warriors and he was a big reason they won a chip. They bet on him and he came through for them. But overall, this isn&rsquo;t solely on Dunleavy. It&rsquo;s been mistakes over the course of a long period of time, 5+ years.</p>

It’s not that we dumped Poole for Paul to get off that contact, it’s that we turned that we ultimately turned that max contract slot into nothing. We let our big two contact guys walk for absolutely nothing, which ensures that we stay under the tax while cashing in on the Curry cow.</p>

<p>The reason why we stayed competitive after Durant left was the D’lo slot that turned into Wiggins — in this case though, we let 50 million walk off our books with no option to replace it.</p>

<p>Complete fan sabotage, but if you follow the warriors sub, it’s almost like they’re excited about returning to the dark ages lol. A truly desperate, sad place.</p>

Now there’s a report saying Klay would sulk or be in a poor mood but it’s not as loud as what Green was doing but it was still an issue. Curry is a FA in a few years and I thought he’d be one of the players who stays on one team their whole career but do people blame him if he leaves if he wants 1 more ring.</p>

      <label for="lb7diww" class="commentText"><p>I mean there isn&rsquo;t much that Dunleavy could have done with this whole Thompson fiasco. Thompson has been in Golden State his whole career and has had a change of heart because he simply just doesn&rsquo;t wanna hear it from the fans. He struggled mightily at times and the fandom didn&rsquo;t appreciate it. I mean how could a fan be cool with a guy making near $40 million and be useless unless he is shooting and making 3&rsquo;s?</p>

<p>Needless to say Klay&rsquo;s contract last year was bad. Albatross level. Poole&rsquo;s rookie extension kicked in at the start of last year and that was done before Dunleavy even got hired. He cannot do anything about that at all.</p>

<p>Waiving Paul was the smart move anyways. No reason to have a backup PG, who doesn&rsquo;t really fit well with Curry due to massive defensive problems on the other end, get paid over 30 million dollars. That&rsquo;s just bad resource allocation.</p>

<p>Now they are under the luxury tax but that team isn&rsquo;t going to be good at all next year. Draymond is still going to be able to bring drama to the team and keep them in the spotlight due to his antics while Curry is likely to go god mode and drop a 35 point per game season next year at age 36 because there simply isn&rsquo;t anyone on that roster that can score the ball. Wiggins is going to have to come back to form after a disaster class season and average at least 20 a night to help Curry out.</p>
