<p>While we wait for the Finals I thought I&rsquo;d share a series that is maybe worth some attention for NBA fans specifically ones curious about the history. This the second episode of a new series where I try to break down players, games and other important parts of NBA history that have become lost, forgotten, or aged so poorly in the minds of fans and former players that whatever spark of greatness was there has been replaced with derisive commentary.</p>

      <label for="l6tlx35" class="commentText"><p>What is rarely considered in these arguments is that the game has evolved. If you dropped the 1950s Dolph Schayes directly into today’s NBA he might find it difficult to keep up and if you dropped JJ into the 50s he’d probably own, but if either of these players grew up in the opposite eras it would probably be different. JJ grew up in an era with an evolved game that included advanced sports medicine, training and conditioning etc. Pros are paid astronomical wages compared to the past and thus are allowed to solely focus on their craft. This argument is far more nuanced than is usually considered.</p>

<p>If you have the time please do try and watch the video. Look at how the game was called back then. It really explains why you can&rsquo;t time travel modern players and expect them to do any better than time traveled past ones. Those players knew that game WAY better than a modern player knows that game. Modern players only know the modern game.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d do shitty though, rather I think he&rsquo;d make about the same relative impact. Right team, right system, he gets minutes. Wrong team wrong system&hellip; his necessity is iffy. He&rsquo;s like a pint sized Bill Bradley and hope New York fans will forgive me for saying that as I do know Bill Bradley handled the ball and did a few things more confidently than Redick in addition to being bigger. But the curling around screens and firing on the run - they almost look like the same player in those type of plays. And Bradley struggled a bit adjusting to the leagues athleticism and size similar to Redicks experience.</p>

<p>It’s such an ignorant argument, completely devoid of any context of the time and place it took place in. JJ gets to walk the paths that players like Dolph Schayes and Bob Cousy paved, but has no appreciation for what they did. He made the millions of dollars he did because of the people who came before, the technique he had came from the foundations of those from before.</p>

      <label for="l6tpuq9" class="commentText"><p>I think JJ doesn&rsquo;t get the fact that players back then had to learn everything from scratch. There was nothing to tell them from right to bad basketball except their experience and understanding of the game.</p>

<p>The early NBA players were the true innovators of the game.</p>

<p>Including sports diet, coaching, playing roles, set plays, shooting technique, post-up techniques - everything that was done was experimental, without any background knowledge (nor one available, way before the internet).</p>

<p>New basketball rules had to be figured out, how to train with your dribbling technique according to the rules, and each travel took way more time, on bus, and nothing luxurious.</p>

<p>To be honest, I think it is way harder to come into a sport and trying to figure it out from scratch.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s while not earning so much compared to these days, only for the love of the game.</p>

<p>I doubt JJ would choose basketball back then if he was in the same position such as Dolph Schayes.</p>

<p>Incredible floater game, his regular jump shot was like a floater. Tall and would shoot over defenders. He was taking and making shots from deep too (around three point range). Just really good considering the lack of development of the game and how everything was for the defender’s benefit</p>

<p>travel rules were incredibly strict too; today you can take three steps off the catch, back then you had to plant your pivot immediately on the catch.</p>

But doesn&rsquo;t that point also goes against him being on top 75? Not to talk about how the game has evolved. Same thing with european football (soccer), the difference between game from 50s, 60s, etc is mindblowing. They look like farmers compared to modern football.</p>

      <label for="l6tm5xh" class="commentText"><p>I see your point but JJ’s original point <em>was</em> about skill level, he wasn’t criticizing the character or work ethic of older players.  It’s just a fact that in the early years players didn’t, and frankly couldn’t, devote all their time/energy into the game.  I think his original comment has been incredibly misrepresented and twisted by people looking to be offended.</p>

<p>Babe Ruth couldn’t play professionally if he was transported to modern baseball.  Simultaneously modern baseball wouldn’t be in its current state without him.  Both can be true and acknowledging the first isn’t hating.</p>

      <label for="l6tpd26" class="commentText"><p>Well the only issue I would take from that is that you&rsquo;re drawing inferences that sound reasonable to you sure, but do you actually know how much Dolph, for example, worked on his game? I know a bit about how much he did from researching for this video. He seemed like Kobe with his work ethic for basketball. Wouldn&rsquo;t be able to learn these kinds of things about players that played in the past if all you do is draw inferences that seem to make sense and not look further than that right?</p>

<p>Examples from Dolph:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Couldn&rsquo;t shoot deep shots when he entered the league but by maybe half way into his career he was shooting from 23+ feet out easily - because he wanted to open up his drive (no 3 point line, the only benefit is driving space).</p></li>

<li><p>Broke his hands multiple times but never sat out, doubled down on working on his off hand to the degree that (like Kobe showed a few times) he could literally shoot jumpers with his left hand. Only Dolph got so good at it the footage implies he was literally mirroring his shots left or right handed of any type, form anywhere. It&rsquo;s wild watching it even on the old black and white tape because he looks so smooth pulling up with his left and firing off jumpers that way.</p></li>

<li><p>He was - by newspaper testimony - always the first one there and the last one to leave for practice, state that he would be in the gym &ldquo;hours&rdquo; after everyone else left.</p></li>

<li><p>He put a smaller ring on the hoops he practiced on so that he had to shoot even more accurately.</p></li>

<li><p>He is on record when he was an active player from some interviews that he wanted to become so good at the game (never stopped working on it) so that people would recognize him as the greatest basketball player ever.</p></li>

<li><p>Lamented when he retired because he thought he did too early even though he played for like 15 years which is crazy for a guy that began when the league first started but ended with Wilt and Russell at their absolute peaks.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>He was that passionate about the game. His work ethic was the same tireless, thankless passionate kind of effort that you&rsquo;d get from guys like MJ or Kobe in more recent eras from all the testimony I have read. So - these inferences may make sense at a glance but all they do is make people comfortable at deciding not to look back and learn about those guys. In my opinion better to actually just try and learn about them case by case if it can be done. I intend to do that and make more videos, and hopefully people can get something from them.</p>

      <label for="l6tqsxl" class="commentText"><p>I think you’re misunderstanding my point.  Of course the all time greats revolutionized the game and were obsessed.  Basketball changed because of them.  However frankly a majority of players had off-season jobs because they had to and basketball training regimens were in their infancy.</p>

<p>Sure the top players were investing loads of time and energy into training but what about the average player then compared to the average player in todays’ league.  I don’t think it’s even a discussion.  And that’s not to dismiss the previous generation either, they couldn’t afford to and they built to system future generations used and built upon themselves</p>

Which is a freaking stupid thing to argue because OF COURSE today&rsquo;s era is more skilled.  They had half of a century of work put in by Cousy, Schayes, and other players to build off of.</p>

<p>All these sports shows argue about “greatness” and that’s what their disagreement boils down to.  Sure Cousy had more impact on the game, JJ agrees with that, but it’s also fair to mention the difference in the game and competition.  He was winning when there were 8 teams and 2 playoff series.</p>

<p>JJ doesn&rsquo;t really argue that point.  He doesn&rsquo;t argue that Chris Paul has had more impact on the game than Bob Cousy.</p>

<p>What he does instead is say that the game today has evolved, and he says it like it&rsquo;s a valid counter argument.  But it&rsquo;s not a valid counter argument.  He still can&rsquo;t refute that Chris Paul had less of an impact on the game than Cousy.</p>

<p>Like I already said.  JJ wasn&rsquo;t make a real point.  He was just trying to win an argument he couldn&rsquo;t win.</p>

      <label for="l6tse1z" class="commentText"><p>A smaller or larger league doesn&rsquo;t make it more or less competitive. One can easily point out the pros and cons of both and equalize it immediately. For example, in Cousy&rsquo;s era everyone knew explicitly all the moves and habits of the players they were guarding. Wilt and Russell for example played each other 140+ times&hellip; Like 10 times a season and that&rsquo;s not even including the 10+ exhibition games per season from that era that never got tracked. Has Jokic even played Embiid 10 times yet in five years? (nope just 8 total). If they ever square off in the Playoffs they only way they can even get familiar with each others game is by trying to study film. It&rsquo;s equally competitive no matter how you scale the league. It does change things. But it never changes things to be more or less competitive.</p>

      <label for="l6ttidc" class="commentText"><p>Firstly I’m bringing up the size of the league to show how small and unknown the sport was compared to now.  The level of athletes and competition of course was lower then than now.</p>

<p>Secondly, only having to win 2 playoff series compared to 4 is of course going to reduce competition level because it is undoubtedly <em>easier</em> to win.</p>

<p>We may just disagree on this, which is fine.  This is all highly hypothetical and subjective.</p>

<p>and why do you think that is?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s because players today have more education, better facilities, better nutrition, better equipment, better training.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d have to be a complete moron to think an all time great from 50 years ago dropped into today wouldn&rsquo;t still be an all time great with all the nutrition, diet, supplements, equipment, medicine that players get today.</p>

<p>Same thing goes backwards, if you drop lebron into 1920&hellip; he <strong>does not look like lebron</strong>.</p>

<p>there was not the nutrition and drugs and training back then.  He&rsquo;d be a stick figure (Russell body type).  He&rsquo;d be playing in converse all stars 82 games a year and traveling on the bus just like everyone else.</p>

<p>Do you think humans have evolved genetically in the last 60 years?  lmao.</p>

      <label for="l6tme89" class="commentText"><p>So I really do implore you to watch the video in particular because you&rsquo;re missing one major point that the video hopefully explains quite well.</p>

<p>The game is played differently then vs now. It&rsquo;s actually to the point that I don&rsquo;t think you can even time travel guys now to play back then and expect them to even be able to compete without constant turnovers, fouls and violations that would ensure they wouldn&rsquo;t even get playing time until they figured it all out which may take weeks, months, or more to reprogram their muscle memory&hellip; The entire strategies of how to win change as well with that. The game hasn&rsquo;t just had a bunch of linear progress. The rules change - it&rsquo;s almost more of a lateral change as time goes by than a progressional one. Players today do more offensively because they can do more it&rsquo;s called so loose today it doesn&rsquo;t even look the same. Players then spammed a few fundamentals because the game was called insanely tight. They practiced that way - they got really good at it. Great at it actually. Really worth learning these things to actually appreciate legendary players of the past.</p>
