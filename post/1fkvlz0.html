      <p>I wasn’t really old enough to watch basketball his rookie year, so I’m curious what people thought he would be in the future.</p>

      <label for="lnyut3n" class="commentText"><p>Except that none of those things are true about MJ.  Did he not go left very often?  No, he didn’t, because he ran the triangle from the right wing and driving to center court ruins the set.  He was also a great passer, even capable of playing pg, which he did for half a season and averaged over 10 ast/g in that stretch.  And he’s the best mid range shooter of all time.  R/nba circlejerk on “we’re done with the 90’s” has gone way too far haha</p>

<p>Then again that was during a time when putting on a Kings jersey would slowly suck the soul out of you, so it may be that too.</p>

      <label for="lnyjzf5" class="commentText"><p>I thought he’d be a better Ginobili when I watched him as a rookie. His handles and footwork going to the rim were very advanced for a young guy. In hindsight he benefitted a lot from being an unscouted rookie. I don’t think there’s a single part of his game that he improved on since his first year.</p>
