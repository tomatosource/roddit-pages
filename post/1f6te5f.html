      <label for="ll2mxbb" class="commentText"><p>All three are legendary Hall of Very Good, top of the top there.  They’re like the benchmark, basically the gatekeepers. If you’re better than them you should get in.</p>

<p>edit: I might squeeze Rondo in, he has the two titles (one as a starter and one off the bench), decent totals, 5 combined All-NBA and All-Defensive teams, led the league in assists 3 times. That seems appropriate enough even if it doesn’t exactly stand out.</p>

<p>I’ll also add I’d personally happily put all three of them in cause they were beasts and all three are iconic, and basketball HoF is <em>relatively</em> lax, but whether they get in is another matter.</p>

<p>I’d put Rondo in for his contributions to rings and leave Blake out for the same reason. Amare was probably the best of the three, but without inking his name in history somewhere I would leave him out too.</p>

      <label for="ll5g5yq" class="commentText"><p>Fair enough. I was just thinking based on their nba careers and I don’t remember his college. I think he’s currently just under the line. Enough college accolades could easily put him over.</p>

<p>Edit: googled it and didn’t change mind. 6x all star and 5x total 2nd and 3rd all nba teams is still under the line for me. Blake was awesome but the nba has had lots of awesome players in 78 seasons. It’s all subjective though based on what each individual concerns Hall of Fame worthy.</p>

Having Nash obv helped but Amare&rsquo;s talent was undeniable anyways.  Too bad, he got hit with his knee problems so early in his career, 4th or 5th season I think</p>

<p>Also, Rondo was a key part of another championship with the Lakers, was a 4-time All-star, 4-time All Defense, an All-NBA, led the league in assists 3 times, led the league in steals once, and is pretty well known as one of the best two-way guards of his generation and one of the highest &ldquo;basketball IQ&rdquo; guys of all time.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he should get in. I don&rsquo;t know if he will get in. But it certainly isn&rsquo;t outrageous and it isn&rsquo;t just because of his win with the Celtics.</p>

      <label for="ll488um" class="commentText"><p>Funny Rondo is the one I&rsquo;d keep out. He was a solid player but he was never &ldquo;the guy&rdquo; nor did he ever really have a claim to best player in the league at his position. Taking the rings away I think he has the worst case. Amare and Blake were both focal points on very dangerous teams their whole career and while not perfect players, I do think they achieved enough overall to make it. My biggest what if has always been if the Knicks hadn&rsquo;t sold out for the melo trade, I really thought they had some interesting pieces there already and were playing pretty well.</p>

Rondo is a yes, amare a maybe and Griffin a No.    I dont really see Griffin with the longevity to make it and let&rsquo;s be real, his dunking ability kinda carried him for a while with allstar selections. I say yes to rondo because he led the league in assists 3 times and in the defensive team.  I personally don&rsquo;t care about championships but he has 2 of those.  There was a long stretch where rondo was probably a top 5-7 PG in the NBA that any team would take.</p>

      <label for="ll5di3l" class="commentText"><p>I agree with the first paragraph for sure.</p>

<p>Blake and Amare have such different cases than Rondo. But in they end they all fall into the category of very good but not ALL-time  great players.</p>

<p>Blake and Amare were top 5ish players in the league for a season or two at their apex and injuries shortened both of their primes drastically.</p>

<p>Rondo has career accomplishments as a very key contributor to two finals teams but was never close to being the best player on either of those teams.   I would say none if them should be in mentally, but emotionally I have a soft spot for all of them as all 3 were part of teams I really enjoyed.  Lob city clips, 7 seconds or less suns, and of course my celtics.</p>

<p>5x All-Star is just about the line for locking up a HoF spot. Rondo seems fringe to me, but Blake and Amar&rsquo;e have better accolades than many HoFers. They have a lot of All-NBA nods between the two of them.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;d either be some of the absolute best guys in the Hall of Very Good ala Shawn Kemp or some of the weakest HoFers ala Richmond and Hardaway.</p>

      <label for="ll45yi0" class="commentText"><p>Its weird to me seeing people ITT say Rondo deserves it the most. He has a couple rings because he played on a team with 3 superstars and another team with a superstar and a GOAT. Prime Rondo was a beast, but he was essentially a super role player. I&rsquo;m not sure he ever even makes an all star team in the West. BG and Amare are much better players and more individually decorated. Ain&rsquo;t no way you can convince me prime Griffin/Amare couldn&rsquo;t win a ring or multiple with the Celtics if they replaced Kendrick Perkins in the starting lineup and find a PG to deliver the ball to the 4 superstars</p>

<p>You compare someone like Marques Johnson to Blake. Blake is slightly better in this comparison, but Marques Johnson isn’t a HOF after over 30 years since retirement so it isn’t some lock Blake just gets in for being slightly better. Maybe Marques Johnson eventually gets in, but those guys on the fence are always iffy. </p>

      <label for="ll3ug3m" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d like to piggyback off you and bring up Maurice Cheeks as someone to compare to Rondo just because of how eerily they are. Both were all-star point guards in supporting roles on teams with 3 other all stars. Both have exactly 4 all-star appearances. Mo Cheeks has an edge with 4 first team all defense and 1 second team all defense compared to Rondo having 2 of each, and Rondo has an with an all-nba 3rd team compared to Cheeks not having any and Rondo has an extra ring. Rondo also appeared in more total season but Cheeks played 15% more total games. Rondo has more total rebounds and assists while Cheeks has more total points on better efficiency.</p>

<p>Mo Cheeks eventually got into the hall of fame, but it wasn&rsquo;t until 25 years after he retired in 2018. This means we can look for Rondo to get into the hall around 2047</p>

      <label for="ll2nhfp" class="commentText"><p>I’m not sure what you mean? Marques Johnson is one of the most respected retired players from the 80s. He’s still on national TV and everyone likes him. He’s even appeared in basketball movies and is still an announcer. He even has his annual dunking challenge which has gained some traction. He wouldn’t be on TV as much as he is if people didn’t like him for off the court issues. </p>

<p>So I don’t think people are not voting for him because of some small personal issue in the 1980s (if that’s what you are even talking about?), especially not so when someone comparable like Walter Davis with far worse of the same issue got in. I think people actually don’t think he’s good enough to get in. </p>

<p>Blake is pretty close for me. Not as good as LMA (who surely will make it), and hasn&rsquo;t had the impactful 2nd half of a career as Horford (who&rsquo;s got a borderline case), but he&rsquo;s not far off this group. I reckon in the end the &ldquo;cultural impact&rdquo; stuff (popularity, dunk comps etc) gets him over the line - for better or worse.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think Rondo should. What&rsquo;s his case? Being the 4th best player on two title winning teams? If those teams weren&rsquo;t the Lakers and Celtics would we even be talking about this?</p>

Playoff Rondo was real, but he also benefited from never having the pressure of being THE guy…or guy number 2…or 3…</p>

<p>Amare and Blake, despite their inability to win it all, were top 5-10 players during their prime and top 2 guys on contenders. I don’t know if Rondo was ever close to top 10</p>

      <label for="ll498eb" class="commentText"><p>Yea we gotta look at rings in context, its a team accomplishment. Rondo averaged <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> on 38% shooting in the 08 finals and <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> on 45% TS during those playoffs. He was firmly a role player and very far from a star in his 2 championship seasons. Ain&rsquo;t no way you can convince me that Amare or Blake replacing Kendrick Perkins in the starting lineup and a replacement level PG instead of Rondo doesn&rsquo;t win a ring in 08 and maybe even go on to win more.</p>

<p>He wasn’t a bad passer for his size and knew how to play within an offensive system.</p>

<p>He wasn’t a great defender but that was due to effort—it was his sudden defensive awakening with Alvin Gentry that took the Suns to the unexpected 2010 WCF.  I remember being mad he didn’t play defense like this the rest of his career.  Not that it matters whether he was bad because he couldn’t do better or because he didn’t try.</p>

      <label for="ll2pch7" class="commentText"><p>I’ve always kinda thought Griffin was first ballot honestly. He was genuinely a borderline top 5 guy in his prime and suffered due to playing at the same time as prime Lebron and KD. I also thought he was slightly better than CP3 in their clippers tenure when they were consistently a top 5 team in basketball (albeit chokers). Plus his reinventing and continued success with Detroit was pretty impressive after the injuries and his college success by being the best player in the NCAA feels like enough.</p>

<p>I do think Blake deserves it just based off cultural impact, as someone else said.  The dude was everywhere.</p>

<p>Amar&rsquo;e just never did it for me.  I know he had a great career, but man was he overshadowed at the time by KG and Duncan.</p>

      <label for="ll52rei" class="commentText"><p>Amare for sure. I’m very bias, but in his Phoenix days when he was the first person to dunk more than shaq. His pick n roll game with Steve Nash was crazy.</p>

<p>I remember them being something like 38-4 at one point and had a realistic chance of beating chicagos 96 record before Nash went down to injury.</p>

<p>For me one of the craziest things is that Amare had the same surgery that penny hardaway and Tracy McGrady had that ruined their careers and he was able to adjust and still be good.</p>

<p>He also played most of his career with undiagnosed vision problems too.</p>

<p>I call it the Antawn Jamison Test. If you start adding in players who were basically compilers, then you have to put Jamison into the HOF too. If you put Jamison in, the HOF no longer has any real meaning.</p>

<p>Rondo doesn&rsquo;t belong in the same category as Griffin and STAT. Rondo was an integral part of a championship team, but he lacks the raw counting stats in volume to qualify. Griffin and STAT were just compilers. Yes, they got All Star nods, but that&rsquo;s still a very political/marketing type of process. Neither was going to lead their team to a championship and neither did much to help their teams win except for empty counting stats. Griffin and STAT did not make the players around them better.</p>

<p>Jamison has over 20 thousand points and over 8100 rebounds. He wasn&rsquo;t elite, but he&rsquo;d give you a consistent 18-20 points a night and was durable. Griffin and STAT were far more marketable and got more accolades, but an overpaid no defense power forward is about the same as every other overpaid no defense power forward. At least Jamison could give you some semblance of floor spacing.</p>

<p>STAT is one of the most overrated &ldquo;big name&rdquo; players in the NBA. Couldn&rsquo;t defend the rim. Horrible handle. No real court awareness. Low BBIQ. Lazy uncommitted defender. Couldn&rsquo;t space the floor with an effective three point shot ( refused to try to learn one even when the entire league was shifting that way)  Mediocre footwork. Basically no real skill as a true low post player.  Once he lost his jump out of the gym athleticism, there was nothing left for him. Cared more about wine bathing, film festivals, virtue signaling as Meadow Sopranos future college boyfriend, and the &ldquo;lifestyle&rdquo; of an NBA player, over just the intense desperate desire to plain win. Let&rsquo;s be real, if STAT was born to be 5&rsquo;6, he&rsquo;d be working at an Arbys right now.</p>

<p>Amare: Great player. He was apart of a revolutionary team in Phoenix. Put the Knicks on the map. Did work in isreal. He is NOT in!</p>

<p>Rajon Rondo: 2 chips with the most historic franchises in the league. People constantly put him in the highest IQ convo. He EVENTUALLY get in!</p>

<p>People forget the Celtics would have no offense after 2010 if it wasn’t for Rondo. He made everything happen when that team got older.</p>

<p>Without Rondo we the Lakers don’t win the bubble chip. When teams played zone against us, having two Lebron’s when it came to passing was unbeatable. He was calling huddles with Bron on the court. One of the best PGs of all-time. Everything isn’t about scoring.</p>

      <label for="ll6ulcy" class="commentText"><p>No for all of them. But I think Rondo is the closest and Amare is the furthest. All these players were great and fun to watch. Were any of them the best player on a playoff team? Feels like Paul was better than Griffin, Nash was better than Amare, and KG/Pierce/Allen were better than Rondo. When these were the lead dogs, none of their teams went very far.</p>

      <label for="ll498lg" class="commentText"><p>Blake was a super famous player who had his career cut short by injuries. He’s probably the first or second most decorated player in his most tenured franchise’s history. He will make the Hall of Fame.</p>

<p>Amare was a stud and was part of some awesome teams but more one dimensional and he had his career cut short by injuries. He’s worthy but borderline but could make it.</p>

<p>Rondo was a cool player who had a very short peak and wasn’t the driving force behind either of his titles. He won’t make it.</p>
