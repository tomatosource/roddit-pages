      <label for="lgntqyn" class="commentText"><p>From everything I&rsquo;ve read and the way its sorta being branded, their intent is to make it a competition moreso for the Average Joe to be able to compete rather than simply all the best 5v5 players that dont make their Olympic 5v5 team. They dont want the competition to be the 13th, 14th, &amp; 15th best basketball players from Spain vs 13-15 from France.</p>

<p>Even the way the gameplay rules are set up, because of how fast paced the game is and the 1&rsquo;s/2&rsquo;s scoring system, Big&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t valuable. You dont want a 7fter because they cant guard in space as well and wont have as much time to set up on the block in between possessions. It incentives smaller players (tho the ideal would still be all star NBA wings, which is why they put the qualifying rules in) with versatile skillsets.</p>

<p>This way, smaller countries with less size and less talented 5v5 players can compete. Average Joes who understand they may have a hard time grinding overseas just to be out of a rotation and having to find a new club every year can see a more fun, competitive avenue in trying to be a great 3x3 player and trying to win prize money. It&rsquo;s also not just an Olympic thing, they essentially decide they&rsquo;d rather commit to this lane year round than be a 5v5 player.</p>

Are the Olympics not intended to find the best competitors for their respective games in the world? And when looking at others sports (track, gymnastics, swimming to name a few), individuals can play on multiple teams and still compete in individual events? It seems like such a bizarre situation to intentionally weaken the field for the good of what?</p>

<p>Most notable mens football is restricted to under 23 to not overshadow every other sport with their tourney while womens football has no age restriction, so there are some rules to prevent the best competitors to enter in some sports.</p>

<p>And historically speaking, the Olympics were not designed to find the best competitors but to have an event for amateurs to compete as pros were not allowed to enter. But this idea is long gone and not really relevant for modern Olympics.</p>

<p>The IOC wouldn&rsquo;t play nice as a favor to UEFA/CONMEBOL if they thought they could successfully poach the 2nd biggest soccer tournament - there&rsquo;s waaaay too much money there.</p>

<p>If they opened it up, players would have to choose between the Euros/Copa (which aren&rsquo;t run by FIFA btw).  And the IOC knows that most players would choose the Euros/Copa.  There&rsquo;s just too much history there to overcome.</p>

You can plainly see the effect of that difference in how the shock jocks Windhorst is telling this to react: &ldquo;they&rsquo;re fucking us&rdquo;. Pretty low-hanging victimizing fruit.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s at the very least reasonablethat FIBA wants to differentiate 3x3 as a separate sport requiring a separate commitment and metagame. A disparity between 5x5 and 3x3 success isn&rsquo;t unique to America. Australia didn&rsquo;t even get a mens team to qualify</p>

The idea is that you specialise in this discipline and then we get the best 3 on 3 players who have dedicated themselves to this version of the game. If a 5s player really wants to play Olympics 3s then they need to make the decision to change the version of the game they play and commit to it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible that you get some more talented guys that just dont operate well in 3x3&rsquo;s style of play where quick-decision making, shooting and endurance are emphasized. It&rsquo;s harder than it looks and some more talented/more productive 5v5 guys just dont naturally fit 3x3 as well or maybe even prefer not to play and pursue other avenues.</p>

<p>Also want to clarify to put some respect on these dudes&rsquo; names:</p>

<p>Dylan Travis (the D2 guy) did average 22/7/5 as a senior and was an All-American. The year before as a 6th man, they went 36-1 on their way to a National Championship. He apparently turned down a D1 offer after that junior year and stuck around to be an All-American instead of chasing D1 status.</p>

<p>Kareem Maddox&rsquo;s senior year he was unanimous 1st team All-Ivy League and won the league&rsquo;s DPOY award. Averaged <sup>14</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> and almost 2 blocks and played a solid game while they lost at the buzzer in the NCAA tournament to Brandon Knight&rsquo;s Kentucky team that went to the Elite 8 (edit: Final 4 actually).</p>

<p>These dudes worked hard and earned the right to be where they are man, you dont gotta disrespect them by lying about their accolades.</p>

<p>Of course there are better options, but are they willing to put in the time, money and effort to rise through the ranks, finding sponsors or putting their own money, and joining the 3x3 competitions, starting at the challenger level (usually pretty local), and winning which allows you a ticket for one of the majors. Those guys you see on the court, regardless of which freaking countries they are from, did exactly that, and that is the spirit of the 3x3 basketball.</p>

<p>Don’t reduce Reddit discourse to that of Twitter and just say dumb stuff without knowing what you are talking about</p>

They played enough 3x3 to qualify for the two Olympic team spots reserved for a country’s top 10 ranked 3x3ers. (The other two spots can go to any player who meets the minimum qualification — one 3x3 tournament per year)</p>

<p>HVL having earned 3x3 experience as a college player allowed the USA women to call up a WNBA player who had minimum eligibility to replace Cameron Brink after Brink’s injury, instead of a less talented 3x3 specialist.</p>

Whos to say we had a random ball player that never played pro but wanted to play for the USA.  Regardless of how bad or good they may be if they didn’t play in FIBA at a point they cant participate.  So not only are you making the pool of players Americans can pick from super small youre not even picking your best like other countries are able to</p>

Like, Neymar won Brazil&rsquo;s first Gold Medal ever in the Olympics in 2016 and literally nobody cares and still call him out as someone that never won anything.</p>

<p>I know it&rsquo;s not simple to remove them, but i swear these weird rules in the Olympics for some sports are so lame, i want to see the best vs the best, not some weird team that met all the pointless criteria. These things is what makes watching some sports in the Olympics lame and why Athletics, Swimming and others are top tier.</p>

<p>There’s U17, U20, and Olympics is basically U23. Although, to be fair, the Men’s Olympic football isn’t in the FIFA calendar so it’s not required for clubs to allow their players to participate but it IS in the women’s calendar so clubs cannot say no if their players are selected</p>

<p>At least in the football world, Olympics are quite highly regarded just like U17 and U20 world cups are, which are similarly ignored by fans as well. Young players can make big moves off the back of Olympic performances!</p>

<p>ETA: football here = soccer. I’m American but work in the sport and apparently type “football” at all times now lol</p>

In addition, club teams are not required to release overage players, so team construction is at the mercy of clubs. For example, the US was denied a few overage strikers by their clubs, so we kinda went with only 1 true 9 and played with a false 9 most of the last 2 games.</p>

It&rsquo;s the same deal for 3x3, if NBA players wanted to play they could&rsquo;ve gone and qualified.</p>

      <label for="lgom4kx" class="commentText"><p>Agreed. The Olympics are very weird in that some events are considered the absolute peak event where the absolute best in the world compete for the sport&rsquo;s most prestigious award, and other events are like &ldquo;whoa whoa whoa, you&rsquo;re too good to be playing in this tournament&rdquo; like it&rsquo;s a juniors league or something.</p>

<p>Personally I think the best in every sport should be able to play. It&rsquo;s supposed to be about &ldquo;Olympic excellence&rdquo; not about trying to find parity among countries. If there was a well established World Cup of 3x3 basketball that was worried the Olympics would detract from, like with soccer, then OK maybe, but there isn&rsquo;t. They should have the best in the world competing there. Maybe a team like Slovenia would say &ldquo;we aren&rsquo;t going to win in 5x5, but we could put Luka in 3x3 and win gold there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the 5 on 5 guys don’t have to make a big commitment. Windy is saying the 3 on 3 guys have to make a much larger one. So it’s reasonable to theorize its to keep our best guys out</p>

<p>NBA players would sweep 3x3. The reason this is an issue is because the event is literally to be a competition for the best in the world, and they’ve intentionally created rules for the sole purpose of excluding the best competitors in the world from playing.</p>

You can say that sure, but it’s not a stretch when you consider they let literally anyone play in FIBA 5x5 (including college players who have never even played pro ball), but require a level of international qualifying points accumulation to play this much lesser known type of basketball in international play.</p>

Requiring 3x3 participation throughout the year ensures nobody that’s any good will play. TWO free throws for personal fouls when you reach 6 fouls in a game that goes to 21 (and shots inside the 3 point line only count for 1). Two free throws AND the ball after 10 fouls. Not taking the ball out after makes.</p>

<p>Like the whole thing looks comically stupid and something you’d see on a middle school playground.</p>

      <label for="lgoa1gj" class="commentText"><p>Well, it&rsquo;s pretty understandable that they want their own player to play 3x3 instead of players going to play on a whim. If you want to grow lesser known sport you should want to grow your own stars.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say that Lebron in 2028 decides to play 3x3 with his sons on US team. In theory, cool, they get so much publicity right ? Yes, for one event. After the event is done, no one cares about it anymore, no publicity, no sponsors because who will want to spend money not knowing if the big draw player will even want to play the event ? That is why they want to push people to commit long term to the sport, they don&rsquo;t want to be an alternative, they want be their own thing. It&rsquo;s actually quite common, similar thing happens in cycling where you have road cycling which is by far the biggest thing but if you want to participate in Mountaing biking or Track Cycling you need to go to some events to get enough points to qualify for Olympics for example</p>

<p>And anyone can compete in 3x3 FIBA by winning a zone cup the year before, qualified the world cup qualifier, or gotten a 3v3 Federation Ranking.  Instead of calling it the &ldquo;zone cup&rdquo; for 5v5 they call it the regional World Cup Qualifiers.</p>

<p>The US played its two rounds of qualifying games back in early 2023.  Then the FIBA tourney, and qualified for the Olympics.</p>

<p>But small team sports (2 or 3 people on a team) tend to require the same athletes who qualify to make up the team that continues.</p>

<p>But all you have to do to make the US track team is run fast enough at the trials. You don’t have to maintain a ranking requiring participation in events over the course of a year.</p>

<p>Why can’t the US have a “3X3 Olympic Qualifying tournament” a few months before the games?</p>

Nearly every other team sport doesn&rsquo;t require any participation.

<p>FIFA fucks the Olympics, limiting the amount of good players because it would hurt their World Cup, Copa America, etc.</p>

<p>MLB went into business with a different governing body, to make the World Baseball Classic, and even before that they didn&rsquo;t let their players play in the Olympics. Didn&rsquo;t want to have an international break in their season.</p>

<p>The NBA, for whatever reason, chose to work with the Olympics, and send B teams to the FIBA world cup instead. Probably a combination of Cold War embarrassment losing to the Soviets, and more money. In terms of 3x3, I doubt Adam Silver and the owners are that interested. The Mavs don&rsquo;t necessarily want Kyrie to be there, the Celtics don&rsquo;t necessarily want Jaylen Brown.</p>

There isn&rsquo;t a distinction here between entities for purposes of Olympic qualifying.

      <label for="lgo25hm" class="commentText"><p>Nah 3x3 is cool. I think its just the structuring and the rules you could change would make it much better. I think a lot of us asians love 3x3. The halfcourt means you can effectively play it in malls and such. Its almost an entirely different game than fullcourt as well because there are barely any breaks or pauses. The games are very fast paced and you can watch a whole game on youtube around 10 minutes so theyre easy to digest. In the philippines, you got to see 6&rdquo;0 terrence romeo playing effectively street ball while competing internationally and it was a lot of fun - you barely got to see that when everybodys tryharding the 5 on 5s and a lot of the pace gets slowed down by whistles. 3x3 has kinda peaked before covid ngl but there definitely is potential.</p>

<p>And the amount of time you need to invest is being underestimated by people. The whole qualifying has a world tour you need to climb up on and actually participate instead of just suiting up for a year.</p>

      <label for="lgn6y8j" class="commentText"><p>The women’s team had top tier talent including WNBA All Stars and lost 4 times in the tournament, including today to a team with no WNBA players.  </p>

<p>4 random NBA players wouldn’t win the tournament even against random players. </p>

<p>Payton Pritchard, PJ Washington, and Zach Collins once played in the U18 version of this 3x3 tournament back when those 3 were three of the best U18 players in the world (all 3 would eventually make the NBA too). They lost in the quarterfinals to a team that no one heard of.</p>

<p>PJ Washington was a McDonalds All American at that time and considered an elite recruit, eventually being an NBA starter on the Finals team. He had trouble dribbling the basketball in 3x3. It’s all on tape, you can still find their loss years later (you can also find the game where Pritchard went off for almost all the points, but they literally went on to lose soon after). </p>

<p>I’m sure if you trained NBA players for a year and had them play 3x3 tournaments globally, they would be the favorite. But no NBA player would ever do this. So changing the qualifying rules doesn’t do much. It just sets up for more embarrassing outcomes. I’m sure the women’s team is very embarrassed right now they would rather have been replaced by 4 random names. </p>

      <label for="lgn5qdc" class="commentText"><p>In order for the US to be the favorites in 3x3, they need to either (1) send 4 All Star level players (so overwhelming talent difference) or (2) 4 NBA level players <em>with chemistry</em> and experience.   Even if the qualification rules were different, I don’t you can find 4 All Star level players who want to play 3x3. You can find 4 NBA players who want to play 3x3, but it’s no guarantee they have any chemistry. </p>

<p>The US Women’s team sent a 3xWNBA All Star in Dearica Hamby, a 2xWNBA All Star in Rhyne Howard, another WNBA level player in Cierra Burdick, and a future WNBA player in Haley Van Lith and <em>lost 4 times</em> in the 3x3 tournament, including the elimination game today. Referring was a bad today, but regardless, they lost 4 times and clearly weren’t the best team. </p>

<p>Keep in mind teams that beat them like Spain have 0 WNBA talent and usually there’s an even bigger gap between women basketball players and the rest of the world. </p>

<p>That shows me you cannot just send 4 random NBA players either and expect to win, so changing qualifying rules doesn’t really change much except it might embarrass 4 NBA players. </p>

<p>People keep thinking 3x3 is just basketball but the rules and strategies is the difference between running the 100m and the 110m hurdles or the 100m and 400m. Track is track, running is running, but for anyone who has run, those are very different events. Noah Lyles would never come close to making it to the Olympics in the 110m hurdles. </p>
