</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>From @spursreporter on X: 𝗧𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗡𝗼𝘁𝗲: TheSacramento #Kings and the Golden State #Warriors who were reported to have the most aggressive trade offers on the table for Utah’s Lauri Markkanen have moved on. Yesterday we heard this news (clip below) late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>On Markkanen&rsquo;s current salary, NBA restrictions limit his extension to a salary worth about <span class="math inline">\(27 million, so the Jazz will need to renegotiate his deal before extending him. The negotiation window opens August 6 for an extension that could reach four years and \)</span>113 million.</p>

<p>It benefits interested teams to have Markkanen sign his $27M per year extension in early August and THEN be traded at the deadline.</p>

<p>Otherwise he will become a free agent next summer and his salary will jump to whatever the market can bear for a player who puts up 23 points and 8 rebounds per game while shooting 3s at a 40% clip. (Hint: it will be millions of dollars higher than $27M.)</p>

<p>NBA teams also know that Markkanen is a risky trade for them and that Utah is basically conducting a blind bidding war. Why would those teams pay a premium to trade for Markkanen right now knowing that he could turn out to be a one year rental.</p>

<p>Why wouldn’t teams wait to see if Ainge (master of the sign and trade deal) can lock him up before losing him for nothing? If he can’t lock him up, then Lauri’s trade value starts to drop. It’s simple. No trade involving Markkanen is likely to happen before early August.</p>

<p>Teams are moving on.</p>

      <label for="lbyfsrr" class="commentText"><p>Markanen is becoming a bit overrated too. He&rsquo;s a good player in his own right but he&rsquo;s a bit like Kevin Love in Minnesota. He&rsquo;s putting up good numbers as a 1 on a bad team but he&rsquo;s not going to be a 1 on a contender. He might actually be more of a 3rd best player on a contender. This sounds like a really steep price for that</p>

<p>Still valuable to have but not for this price and alot of the teams have moved on. Kings going for Demar, I doubt the Spurs were actually interested anyway, and it seems the Warriors are still refusing to give up Kuminga</p>

      <label for="lbyl9rk" class="commentText"><p>To be fair, Kevin Love got traded for the #1 overall pick in a stacked draft (Wiggins), the #1 overall pick in a shitty draft (who had been bad as a rookie — Bennett), and another first round pick from Miami.</p>

<p>That’s a HAUL.</p>

<p>And teams have clearly shown a willingness to trade serious draft capital for supporting players if they’re elite supporting players (Gobert, Bridges).</p>

<p>If you think Markkanen is a 2nd or 3rd best player on a championship team, I feel like selling the farm for him isn’t a terrible idea, especially given how well he seems to fit on most teams.</p>

There haven&rsquo;t been that many! Who would you trade for a package headlined by&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;2018 #1 Deandre Ayton and 2017 #1 Markelle Fultz?</p>

<p>&hellip;1999 #1 Elton Brand and 1998 #1 Michael Olowokandi?</p>

<p>&hellip;1990 #1 Derrick Coleman and 1989 #1 Pervis Ellison?</p>

At the time of the trade it&rsquo;s two firsts, one of them great, the other unknown, and an abandoned project that you hope can recoup value.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not really a haul.</p>

<p>Plus, as others have noted, that was part of an already agreed upon package deal.</p>

Just because you are not a number 1 option doesn&rsquo;t mean you are not worth it. To get a good player you are going to over pay either in free agency or trade . Do I think mikal bridges is worth 5 first round pick no. Minnesota gave up 5 first round picks for Rudy gobert who isn&rsquo;t a number 1 option on a team.

<p>He&rsquo;ll be able to plug in to any offense as he&rsquo;s an elite scorer, but he&rsquo;ll never be the first option on any team. Since he was traded to Cleveland he&rsquo;s become at least an average defender so his value for a competing team is quite high.</p>

They want him to be a 2nd or 3rd piece, and he&rsquo;s perfect for that role. He&rsquo;s an efficient scorer, plus defender, can play multiple positions and doesn&rsquo;t need the ball very much. Not to mention his current salary makes him an easy fit with a team who&rsquo;s spent most of their money on their superstars.

<p>Bridges is entirely different.  He&rsquo;s under contract for two seasons and you know he&rsquo;s going to stick around with the Nova corps.</p>

      <label for="lbyoozt" class="commentText"><p>Think they can offer him the full max extension by re-negotiating this year’s salary up to about $33M. Don’t know if he’s gonna get the true max or not, but they can do that. That’s what the Kings did with Sabonis last year.</p>

<p>Not sure why the article mentioned the 4yr/<span class="math inline">\(113M extension when talking about that August 6th date. Think that’s his max extension if he goes off his current \)</span>18M, but they can use their available cap (over $31M?) to kick him up well past that.</p>

<p><span class="math inline">\(155M is the expected salary cap next year, he’s eligible for a 30% max, which is like \)</span>46.5M in year one. With an extension, you’re only allowed to do a 140% raise off the player’s last salary. So if Lauri is getting a max extension, he’d need to be bumped up to over <span class="math inline">\(33.2M this season. About \)</span>15M tacked on top of his current $18M, Utah has the cap space to do that.</p>

<p>Would give Lauri a hell of a lot more money this year, almost doubles his pay. And yeah, having him locked in longterm would give Utah more of a bargaining chip. Trade off is eating like <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of Lauri’s new <sup>2024</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub> salary, which is still very likely worth it.</p>

<p>Do run the risk of him getting dinged up/injured throughout the season, not like that’s uncommon for him. Plus the Jazz’s own 1st is top 10 protected, if Lauri is healthy and playing it could impact the tank, but I think that more so jeopardizes snagging top 3 odds for the 1st overall than dropping out of the top 10.</p>

<p>The other thing is when he can actually be traded. Think a restructure/extension means he can’t be moved for 6 months. August 6th extension means the earliest he can be traded is February 6th? That’s the day of the deadline this year, so you’d leave yourself like 24hrs of wiggle room to finalize a trade. Definitely still doable, and they’d very likely have everything set and fully worked through beforehand, but it does push it.</p>

<p>Seems like a worthwhile “risk” for the Jazz, and I’m sure Lauri is fully on board with cashing in on a massive payday. Maybe opposing FO’s would prefer to do the contract negotiations themselves, but you kind of just have to live with it if an extension gets signed.</p>

<p>Feel like the only things that could realistically tank Lauri’s value: injury, extension isn’t signed in time for him to be trade eligible by the Feb. 6th deadline (could always just move him next off-season, seeing as he’ll still have 4 more years on contract), or he decides to forgo the extension and massive pay raise to test UFA (leaving $10-15M on the table to be able to outright choose your next team would be bold as hell).</p>

      <label for="lbyks08" class="commentText"><p>I see what you mean. Thanks for explaining.That makes it really interesting for the Jazz then because if they go that route and commit to Lauri and sign him to a max, they essentially take themselves out of the Cooper Flagg sweepstakes and lock themselves into a 10-12 seed for the next couple of years. They also won’t be able to trade Lauri this year if they extend him since he can only be extended in late August and can’t be traded for 6 months after an extension, which would be late Feb and after the trade deadline. And the Pistons/Spurs are the only team with the cap space to renegotiate a deal and extend Lauri</p>

      <label for="lbyl6oz" class="commentText"><p>Yea I understand the situation now. As a fan what do you think they should do? If they extend Lauri, they basically lock themselves into the 10-13 seed range this year and take themselves out of the Flagg sweepstakes. They also wouldn’t be able to trade him at all this season if they extend him. If he could be traded this season, then it obviously would have made the decision much easier as you can just extend him and trade him at the deadline to tank for Flagg.</p>

      <label for="lbym97t" class="commentText"><p>Yeah if it were me I’d rather trade him and be as bad as possible, though I’m not sure how him being up for that extension affects the trade legality. Like a team trading for him would need cap to renegotiate his deal I think, and yeah if we extend he can’t be traded for a while. So it’s a tough spot, I think best case is probably we do the extension, he plays well (but we still suck) until he can be traded and then we can move him at still high enough value to a team that feels more pressure to make a move</p>

<p>Edit: essentially, I think we still suck with him enough to tank reasonably well but I don’t like taking chances</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The CBA is weird, but from what I’ve gathered, he signed his original contract in late August 2021, and he legally can’t renegotiate until 3 years later which is this late August 2024. And after signing an extension, he legally can’t be traded for 6 months. The issue is that the NBA trade deadline will be over by late February.</p>

<p>And I agree with your thoughts as well, I feel like y’all will probably still suck with Lauri and banking on a 14% chance on the #1 pick isn’t really worth it. Lauri will still have value next off season</p>

Woj and other NBA insiders put on a whole circus about how we <em>should</em> trade him immediately, but there’s never been any indication that we were going to deal him for anything less than a massive overpay. The most they could say is that we’ve been openly listening to offers, which is essentially saying nothing. Every team in the NBA listens to offers, and if Ainge had said “we’re not trading Lauri for any price” he’d be gone immediately.</p>

<p>The plan has always been to extend him and go from there. If he does get traded, it’ll either be a huge overpay right now or a massive move at the deadline.</p>

      <label for="lbzj075" class="commentText"><p>Sure, and personally, I would’ve rather that we traded him last year. However, we’re not gonna get nearly the deal we want with him just on the one year deal, and Ainge knows that. But if we extend him, then we suddenly have more options. Let’s not forget that Utah was one of the worst team in the NBA for the first couple months of the season before they caught fire in December and January, despite Markkanen still playing. So I don’t think it’s unrealistic to say that the Jazz can still tank with Markkanen on the roster, and then try and find someone who wants him the last day of the trade deadline for a pretty good deal.</p>

When Keyonte develops into something great Lauri will already start to decline. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense keeping him, i don&rsquo;t understand what are you trying to prove here and why are we even arguing about this. Would you like your Grizzlies to have JA and 11 Luke Kennards on your roster? A situation where you suck but JA himself keeps you from completely bottoming out and your team is stuck not even in mediocrity but at being bad just not bad enough.</p>

      <label for="lbyq9wm" class="commentText"><p>Your point is they need to stack top 5 picks until they get good. My point is that’s not the only option and it may not even be an option to tank for years if you’re good at drafting and development. You’re just min-maxing this like it’s 2k franchise it’s a lot harder to just do that. Especially in an efficient manner.</p>

<p>its not required yes, but as you even admitted top picks have better odds, so you&rsquo;re telling me that its better to have shittier odds? for what benefit exactly? because I don&rsquo;t see it at all.</p>

<p>not only are you gambling and praying for god to land a good pick on a low probability draft, but you&rsquo;re also gambling by having Lauri play these idiotic and senseless game and risk him getting injured</p>

      <label for="lbzh908" class="commentText"><p>It’s not better to have shittier odds but if a team has enough confidence in their front office to draft well with a mid lottery pick and wants their young players to play hard and gain real experience instead of turning every game into garbage time and destroying the culture I don’t think that’s an insane choice. They also have a super young coach that I’m sure they want to know if he’s gonna be a long term guy and throwing him out there with a tanking roster is the worse way to evaluate that.</p>

<p>I think it was Lauri’s camp not wanting to extend. They’ve been vocal about hitting FO next year and I just assume teams like the Kings and Warriors (whose assets are somewhat limited because of their unsure futures) didn’t want to overpay for an expiring contract.</p>

All actual sources have said the Jazz want to keep Lauri, that he’s happy in Utah, and plan A is to renegotiate and extend him in August when he’s eligible. Financially that also makes the most sense for Lauri, he could always demand a trade next year once his deal is signed if he wanted out.</p>

<p>The “his camp wants to hit FA” thing is a completely unsourced claim of 1 kings reporter afaik.</p>

<p>Lauri&rsquo;s best move has always been to stay with the Jazz and renegotiate his contract and get the full max extension on August 6th. If the Jazz still want to trade him, they have do so between midnight and 3PM EST on February 6th (6 months later on trade deadline day).</p>

<p>Yet teams have been in talks about trading for him, so I doubt it&rsquo;s just over all of a sudden, atleast not for this reason.
Probably just Ainge wanting more than what teams are willing to pay when there&rsquo;s a potential Lauri will only stay for a season.</p>

<p>Jazz won&rsquo;t get any noteworthy players from the draft, so they&rsquo;re going to be this middle of the pack shit team until Lauri gets old and decline, and if he, i pray to god won&rsquo;t happen, gets injured as well while playing the nonsense middle of the pack season games? yiiiikes.</p>

If he gets another 7-10 pick next year his rebuilding will have been a massive failure. He hasn’t gotten a single foundational piece to build a future around in 3 years. This is probably the best draft to find one outside of the wemby lottery, which he should’ve tanked even harder. Obviously they aren’t building around Lauri.</p>

      <label for="lbzfaep" class="commentText"><p>They could still be bad enough to land a top 8 pick. But kind of a catch 22 for them. If they still suck enough for a top pick with Lauri and Sexton leading the way that means the rest of their team is garbage and their draft picks the past years are bad. Even if they land a star they would still need more pieces and wont be ready to compete for another couple of years and Lauri&rsquo;s value and effectiveness drop with age. If their young talent improves they screw themselves out of a good pick and just have a bunch of solid players but no star to take em to the next level.</p>

<p>Idk why Jazz fans are comfortable with this going forward. It&rsquo;s risky and could set them back years just because Ainge wants to be greedy. The Jazz need to be able to contend in like 2-3 years for holding Lauri to be worth it. And idk if that&rsquo;s a good bet to make.</p>

<p>I think jazz fans seem fine with just being a treadmill team. And ainge has sold them this dream that Lauri will only be traded for a bridges like haul. I’m assuming most offers are significantly less. And ainge is going to re-sign Lauri and they will be in year 3 and still not have a foundational piece and will look to tank again the following year but then Lauri is older on a worst contract and harder to trade. Really because he wasn’t able to tear down quickly his rebuild will be horrible. The draft picks he’ll get will be end of the 1st type picks as the wolves and Cavs look to be in the top 5 of their conferences. And he’s really not going to get anything of value because his team wasn’t a bottom dweller and he refused to make a trade to ensure that.</p>

      <label for="lbywhtm" class="commentText"><p>I interpret this tweet differently. There are deals still on the table here and no one has necessarily walked away.</p>

<p>Jazz have always been very clear in that they don&rsquo;t want to trade Lauri and that it will take a substantial offer to get him. Lauri may be a #2 on a championship team, but his unique skill set and size markets him a bit differently.</p>

<p>Besides Durant, name a player currently with Lauri&rsquo;s size averaging ~50/40/90? And no, I&rsquo;m not saying Lauri is KD by any means.</p>

      <label for="lbyk6no" class="commentText"><p>I wish the Jazz the best considering the whole TimberJazz thing we have going on, but god would it not be hilarious if they dont commit to a rebuild and get like a mid lottery pick just for Lauri to walk in free agency?</p>

<p>Imo they should have traded Lauri his breakout season or last year to be able to get alot of assets back and being able to tank and get a good pick back. I dont dislike their prospects at all, like Williams, Collier and George are good but I dont think any of them will be a perennial all star, much less a player that can lead your team to the playoffs in a stacked western conference.</p>

      <label for="lbyiqjy" class="commentText"><p>Exactly.  If Lauri wants, he can get an effective no-trade clause by waiting until August 7th to sign the renegotiate-and-extend deal, because that would take his tradeable date past the trade deadline.  If he signs immediately, he could be traded deadline day.</p>
