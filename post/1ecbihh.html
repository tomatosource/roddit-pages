I feel like maybe I could have done a better job of publicly saying, ‘No, we don’t want anybody, we want JB.’ I just was always like, ‘I want to stay out of it.’ ”</p>
</a>

    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/the-celtics-define-greatness-in-any-era" target="_blank">From Jayson Tatum&rsquo;s new Sports Illustrated interview</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Few teammate dynamics have been as scrutinized as those of Tatum and Brown. Drafted a year apart, they had quick success, making the conference finals in two of their first three seasons together. Brown, though, constantly found his name in trade rumors, the result of a run of star players (Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis and Kevin Durant) becoming available and the flexibility the Celtics had to acquire them. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the relationship between the two stars has been nitpicked incessantly. A rough stretch can lead to a media colonoscopy. Hell, even a good stretch. After Brown was named MVP of the conference finals, ESPN used video of Tatum applauding—apparently not emphatically enough—to suggest that the two weren’t really close. “Like I wasn’t happy for him?” Tatum says. “Yeah that was tough. Because then we had 10 days off. I was just like, ‘F&mdash;, can we start playing?’ ”</p>

<p>Tatum will cop to some missteps over the years. But he insists he never wanted Brown to be traded. “Most stars don’t make a conference finals until they are 27, 28,” Tatum says. “We were doing it when we were 19, 20.” He does admit, however, that he could have been more vocal.</p>

<p>“I’ve always told him that maybe I could have done a better job of voicing my feelings in the public eye,” Tatum says. “He always knew that I wanted him here. I would always tell him like, ‘Man, I don’t get involved with any of those talks.’ I never went to [Celtics president of basketball operations] Brad [Stevens] or went to any player like, ‘Yo, I want this guy in, I want this guy out of here.’ I show up and I want to do my job and play basketball. And looking back on in those moments, I didn’t know how that could affect somebody, because I was never in that situation. I feel like maybe I could have done a better job of publicly saying, ‘No, we don’t want anybody, we want JB.’ I just was always like, ‘I want to stay out of it.’ ”</p>

<p>Over the years, Tatum has often been first to collect the accolades: All-Star, All-NBA. As teammates, they are friendly. As high-level wing players, they are, at times, competitors. Tatum recalls a stretch during the 2019–20 season, when both knew they were battling for one All-Star spot. Tatum got it. “And I knew he was happy for me,” Tatum says. “But when you are a competitor, you want what’s in front of you.” Similarly, Tatum wanted Finals MVP this year. But to see Brown get recognized, Tatum says, “made me genuinely happy.”</p>

<p>“I feel like he has gotten a short end of the stick, whether it’s All-Star selections or All-NBA,” Tatum says. “I feel like he, in a sense, made up for some of those shortcomings that people didn’t vote him for. I was happy that he got it.”</p>

<p>“We’ve figured out that we need each other,” Tatum says. “We have learned how to coexist. And we know we need to be the best version of ourselves in order for all of this to work. We weren’t necessarily the best playmakers early in our careers but we developed into guys that really bleed the game. We want to be a great example of guys that play on both ends as a floor and guys who are the best teammates that we can be.”</p>

      <label for="lezjw29" class="commentText"><p>What I find fascinating is whether he was really put in the talks or if his name was brought up by the other side and that’s all they need to say “he was in trade talks”. Specially with the KD rumours after 22 finals it felt the Celtics were mostly used as leverage at least from a Celtics fans perspective.</p>

<p>It felt like Brooklyn went to Brad, said “we want JB, fillers and picks”, Brad said “ok, have a nice day now”, ESPN said “The Celtics wants to trade Jaylen Brown for KD”</p>

      <label for="lezvtjx" class="commentText"><p>I mean, Boston had no reason to say that.  Brooklyn, on the other hand, could both drive up the price, and try to drive a wedge between Brown and Tatum, like Kidd tried in the playoffs.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s psyops, but I suspect years of this led Brown to have a massive chip against certain ESPN personalities.</p>

      <label for="lf25tpx" class="commentText"><p>It’s not like the Celtics were just looking for any chance to trade brown though. Nobody can seriously tell me they always knew Jaylen brown could be the number two on a championship team.</p>

<p>He was always in trade talks because he was the second best player on a team that hadn’t won yet, and every time it was for a superstar that was clearly better than him. The Celtics were just one of the only teams to consistently have the assets to get every superstar that was going into FA.</p>

      <label for="lezy70b" class="commentText"><p>In hindsight, the real missed trade for us was not sending Kyrie out for Kawhi.</p>

<p>We reportedly looked at trading for Kawhi but we couldn&rsquo;t have had both Kyrie and Kawhi&rsquo;s contracts on the books (I think it was a Rose restriction?). Which meant any trade would have to be a 1-for-1.</p>

<p>Kawhi / Hayward / Tatum / Brown / Horford had enough playmaking and shot creation that they wouldn&rsquo;t have needed a PG.</p>

<p>Plus the lineup would have definitely been versatile enough defensively.</p>

<p>We also still would have had Smart and Rozier on the bench if we did end up needing PGs.</p>

Last summer, Jaylen Brown signed a five-year extension worth north of \)</span>50 million a season. “I held out for <span class="math inline">\(10,000,” cracked Cousy, “so Jaylen could hold out for [\)</span>304] million.”</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty insane. I mean, you don&rsquo;t have to be fan of this dude but hating on someone for not saying controversial stuff, or even being &ldquo;boring&rdquo; is pretty low.</p>

<p>There are plenty of players that deserve criticism, Tatum ain&rsquo;t one of them. Just be indifferent and focus on someone more amusing, if that&rsquo;s what you value more. But hate?</p>

Can’t stand duke, but some players, mainly some select one-and-dones, who are clearly extremely talented I can get over it and support them in their pro career. Tatum and Ingram are really the only ones I can think of, I guess Kyrie too sometimes since he didn’t really play for duke but I only like him when he plays well lmao. Idc about Zion cuz he’s always been injured in NBA</p>

Some players say all the right things in interviews, but it seems very much a crafted media persona, while Tatum seems to me like a mature, down to earth guy being himself.  I’m a bit of a Celtics/Bruins hater (Raps/Leafs fan), but can’t hate on Tatum.</p>

<p>Side note, as both an NBA and NHL fan, love the random fact that he and Matthew Tkachuk were HS buds: <a href="https://youtu.be/O3oo1bw247E?si=9rFml72hkki9G08H" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/O3oo1bw247E?si=9rFml72hkki9G08H</a></p>

      <label for="lf219ms" class="commentText"><p>In the modern era of sports and attempted parity in leagues like the NBA, NFL, NHL, this is the closest we’re gonna get to the ability to “buy championships”. In the NBA you basically have to build the team while its cheap, then be willing to spend to maintain it.</p>

<p>But in most of those situations, you’re reliant on older players as the core of the team LeBron, Curry, etc. The celts hitting on back to back draft picks with JB and Tatum meant that this team is built around players we can keep as long as they want and as long as we’re willing to pay. Age issues are only Horford, then KP and Jrue, but with White and PP contracted, we’re good with Holiday and KP is a tough replacement, but if the owners are willing to pay $500-600m a year on players/tax, then there’s no reason that the celts won’t be a perenniel contender for a decade.</p>

      <label for="leyzr84" class="commentText"><p>There were initial trade rumors involving Tatum but that was at the highest of levels whereas with Jaylen, he was mocked for the extension he signed even last season, with names all across the spectrum being forecast next to Tatum instead of him. He&rsquo;s always been little brother, always been someone fans mocked in trades, kinda been an easy target on social media, and more&hellip;and he&rsquo;s also sensitive. He&rsquo;s the kind of guy who reads that stuff so that doesn&rsquo;t help.</p>

<p>Tatum seems like a very well considered guy and he&rsquo;s mild mannered and quiet. He&rsquo;s vocal when he needs to be but that&rsquo;s not his default nature. He&rsquo;s not really responsible for Jaylen&rsquo;s feelings, but it is a sign of leadership for him to really make it clear to his teammate that he has his back. That&rsquo;s leadership and that is what teammates should do for each other in those moments.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard not to feel a measure of insecurity when someone around the same age as you on the same team gets the accolades and shine whereas you&rsquo;re viewed as someone almost holding him back. Jaylen to me can be pretty aloof, but it&rsquo;s hard not to feel insecurity in that situation. Sometimes it takes guys a bit more time to fully put their games together. Imagine if Jaylen&rsquo;s 3 ball goes back to the high-30s again.</p>

<p>After what Jaylen did in this playoff run, his status in this league is stamped and I&rsquo;m happy for him and happy for the Celtics, because their project finally has paid off.</p>

Now they know they can reach the top together and have a GM that will make it happen so why break it up.  Browns grudge is with the media, not his teammates.  I also think Tatum is the kind of personality and player to come back more motivated being recognized as one of the best in the Olympics and Brown is the type of personality and player to come back even more motivated because he was snubbed.  He&rsquo;s not mad at Tatum he&rsquo;s mad at Nike.</p>
