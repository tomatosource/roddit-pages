      <label for="leox173" class="commentText"><p>Even if you disregard Russ&rsquo;s clearly sarcastic tone, I have no idea how people believe in stuff like this. Obviously every single NBA player watches film, it&rsquo;s an integral part of game preparation. NBA, like all other top sports leagues, is an ultra competitive league with top athletes that are naturally ultra competitive, and ultra competitive people tend to do everything possible to get better. There is close to zero chance that even a single player doesn&rsquo;t watch any film because of the mandatory film sessions, but a huge percentage of them probably also watch films with their individual trainers in their free time, because if you don&rsquo;t keep up with the game you run the risk of being replaced.</p>

He didn’t say “I saw Trevor there and I decided that I just wouldn’t pass to him.”  I am simply pointing the difference between the language he used and you used, which should be clear.</p>

<p>If it’s not obvious.<br>
“Kobe wouldn’t pass him the ball” means Kobe purposely did not pass him the ball.
“I was really upset with myself, I don’t see Trevor sitting there on the wing” means Kobe was upset with himself for not seeing Trevor on that pass, which means, not on purpose.</p>

<p>I am not making any excuses for him.  Kobe leans more toward shooting than passing isn’t some big news.  You can think Kobe purposely missed that pass, but what I am saying is that don’t say Kobe himself said that he purposely missed that pass.  I hope you can see the difference.</p>

<p>No it doesn&rsquo;t. He gave no indication that he wanted to make that play and he even acknowledged Trevor&rsquo;s frustration with his refusal to pass the ball while he was waving his arms wide open. Not a missed play. You don&rsquo;t miss someone when they&rsquo;re standing there for multiple seconds waving their arms at you. It&rsquo;s just pure selfishness.</p>

<p>Actually he did admit to it in his ass-covering language when he said he &ldquo;saw an opportunity to demolish the spirit of their team.&rdquo; The only way you wouldn&rsquo;t notice that is if you&rsquo;re being purposefully stupid.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kobe wouldn’t pass him the ball” means Kobe purposely did not pass him the ball.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kobe purposefully did not pass him the ball. Kobe acknowledged this himself also, that, in his own BS spin &ldquo;gets caught up in the challenge&rdquo; of trying to score in bad situations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not making any excuses for him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes you are, and it&rsquo;s embarrassing and not working.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kobe himself said that he purposely missed that pass.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kobe purposefully missed that pass. He tried to give an excuse that &ldquo;he wanted to demolish the spirit of their team,&rdquo; meaning that he wasn&rsquo;t even thinking about running a proper offense.</p>

<p>You trying to make-up some bullshit deliberate misunderstanding is just embarrassing and, again, it will not work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am simply pointing the difference between the language he used and you used, which should be clear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, you&rsquo;re making things up and playing dumb to try to cover for him, which is embarrassing.</p>

<p>Russ is about the best example of All Brawn, No Brain player in NBA history.</p>

<p>And tbh, his offense was so goddamn great, he was fun as hell to watch for a long time.</p>

<p>But he never played winning basketball.</p>

It sure sounded from reports that he was mainly unhappy with the bench role he had there. Maybe he thinks he has a better chance of stealing a starting role from Christian Braun than he did from Harden or Mann in LA.</p>

He has moments of great d but he still doesn’t try a lot, tries too hard sometimes and just isn’t a great defender at his size. And don’t get me started on his offensive game. It’s hard to watch him on the floor on offense, it’s so so bad. He’s a black hole that doesn’t provide anything except bad plays in general.</p>

<p>He used to be great and that mindset has ruined him even more. He’s straight up delusional about his ability’s on the floor and hates making sacrifices to help the team.</p>

<p>If anyone can fix him it’s jokic Ig but I said the same thing about bron and we know how truly awful he was in la. Good luck to the nuggets lol</p>

      <label for="lepafxv" class="commentText"><p>Who? KCP shot 40% from the field and had a 3.2 AST/TOV ratio. Despite averaging half as many minutes, Westbrook averaged twice as many turnovers. And shot 14% worse from the field and 10% worse from three. Jamal Murray shot 40% from the field and had a 2.2 AST/TOV ratio. Even Reggie Jackson was 6% better from the field and committed way less turnovers.</p>

<p>You are acting completely delusional. Westbrook is a negative on the court, you can admit this even though he&rsquo;s now on your team. You&rsquo;re doing the exact same thing that Lakers and Clippers fans did when Russ first joined them, even though he&rsquo;s only got worse with time.</p>

<p>Denver was the undisputed best team in the league all year lol. The way they lost in the playoffs was embarrassing bcz they didn&rsquo;t take those games seriously until it was too late.</p>

<p>Ik we lost a few players to free agency this year so maybe we&rsquo;ll actually be worse next year</p>

<p>Literally tied for first are you dumb? The games we lost to OKC were on a back to back. We would&rsquo;ve had a better record but wemby decided to go prime MJ and carried his team to an upset.</p>

      <label for="lenqulk" class="commentText"><p>The truth of the matter is the NBA was hella boring that year because KD joined the Warriors to make an unstoppable super team and everyone penciled in for another Cavs v. Warriors rematch.</p>

<p>Because KD left OKC in dramatic fashion, the media was overly excited for an OKC storyline. The truth was OKC was a mediocre team that finished 6th in a fledgling West that was top heavy and got destroyed in the first round. The whole season I watched Steven Adams jump in the opposite direction of a loose ball so Russ could get to 10 rebounds per game. Russ had a stupid high usage rate and was the main ball handler.</p>

<p>In general, I am anti-mediocre teams having MVPs. But this was the perfect season for Russell to win the award. Had he averaged a triple double two seasons after KD left with a 6-seed team, I don&rsquo;t think he would&rsquo;ve won. But generally, I think media screwed this one up.</p>

<p>With hindsight, we&rsquo;ve seen how teams with Russ as the 1st option don&rsquo;t scale well even when more talent was added the seasons after, never making it out of the first round. Compared to Harden who, although never made it to the championship, was able to go toe to toe with the Curry-Durant Warriors.</p>

      <label for="leopmkh" class="commentText"><p>The 2017 OKC roster had half the guys out of the league within 2 years. The only bright spots were Adams and occasionally Kanter. Oladipo and Sabonis were still young, people didn&rsquo;t turn on &lsquo;Dipo until he got to Indiana. Alex Abrines was spotting up and backwards James got decent minutes ffs. It was one of the greatest carry jobs in NBA history but Russ has the most dedicated haters.</p>

      <label for="lepay84" class="commentText"><p>I mean the main rotation players were Westbrook, Oladipo, Adams, Roberson, Kanter, Sabonis, Jerami Grant. They also acquired Taj Gibson and Doug McDermott at the trade deadline.</p>

<p>Obviously most of those guys weren&rsquo;t what they are now, but the only guy who went out of the league was Roberson, who suffered a knee injury that caused him to miss a whole season two years after. Alex Abrines and Semaj Christon were the only players who had consistent rotation minutes at points in the season that were actually garbage.</p>

<p>2017 rockets also had Ryan Anderson starting and Sam Dekker, 35 year old Nene, and Corey Brewer all out the league within 2-3 years.</p>

      <label for="lepetuc" class="commentText"><p>thats such a ridiculous statement to discount a whole 6% difference in true shooting percentage for two players about equal in skill first of all. We should not even need to be doing this.</p>

<p>The Rockets started Ryan Anderson and had Sam Dekker, 35 year old Nene, and Corey Brewer giving significant minutes on the bench. They were a little better than OKC, but the Thunder main rotation was Westbrook, Oladipo, Adams, Roberson, Sabonis, Kanter, Jerami Grant. All decent players. They had some shitty players in Abrines and Christon in the end of the rotation at times but they also traded for Taj Gibson and Doug McDermott at the deadline.</p>

<p>And need not name the players. I know who was on the team. I watched most the games. They were terrible lol. The decent guys you named were either too young or 1 way players. Rockets had vet experience and players that could actually play basketball.</p>

<p>I feel like with athletic freaks this only happens in the US college system, the player worship, media attention, money, etc&hellip; impacts ones ego so fucking much man, in Europe they get fundamentals drilled into their head, playing within the team/system, have some old school coach absolutely ripping into them the second they disobey plays or matchups or don&rsquo;t put in 100% effort and it humbles even the best players that are bound for a top 10 draft pick.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t even imagine how insane Westbrook would be if he was a dog on defense in his position in his prime, hounding players and locking them down, worked on a stable jump shot and averaged 28/9/8 instead of 30/10/10 because those round numbers looked so much cooler.</p>
