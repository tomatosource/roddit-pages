<p>like go back and look at Wilt footage. he&rsquo;s one of the biggest, most athletic guys to ever play the sport, but he&rsquo;s beating guys with finesse because most contact initiated by the offensive player was called an offensive foul. any center from in the 90s would foul out in two minutes under 60s rules</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reason he&rsquo;s got all the records.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the 60s NBA played at an insane pace and he was the original volume scorer but black hole playmaker.</p>

<p>In Wilt&rsquo;s 50PPG season, the league average possessions per game was 126.2</p>

<p>This year it was at 98.5.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, even pace adjusted Wilt&rsquo;s numbers are elite. But for example, in that 50ppg season Wilt Chamberlain scored 40.2% of his teams points while on the court. 40+% has only been reached by 62 Wilt, 87 Jordan, 03 TMac, 06 Kobe, 17 Westbrook and 19 Harden. All of them except TMac scored a higher % than Wilt that year.</p>

<p>His per possession numbers are comparable to modern scoring leaders as well.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reason that his teams offenses improved when he started shooting less later in his career.</p>

      <label for="la5nw5l" class="commentText"><p>People always bring up pace without acknowledging that efficiency was also way down league-wide, which mostly offset the pace. The year Wilt averaged 50, numbers 2-10 on the PPG leaderboard averaged between 23 and 32 PPG. This past season, numbers 2-10 on the PPG leaderboard averaged between 26 and 30 PPG.</p>

<p>Also worth mentioning that Wilt was 5th in the league in TS% that year, so it isn&rsquo;t like he was just throwing shots up.</p>

      <label for="la5kgha" class="commentText"><p>I mean assuming he can do what Shaq did in the 90s/00s, averaging 70 is a tall order considering the pace but he could probably go for 50ppg again. </p>

<p>His 50ppg were at a time where the slightest contact created by an offensive player is an offensive foul. Hence, why his points were mainly from fadeaways and finger rolls. You can create contact in 90s and get a defensive foul. I see that only helping him, not hurting him. Also, the 3P line, while not widely used in the 90s, would&rsquo;ve given him even more space to operate than the congestion in the 60s.</p>

<p>Plus, the fact he usually plays the entire 48min, while never fouling out in his career makes it very plausible. </p>

<p>But Steph did revolutionize the sport, I’m saying this as someone who has coached youth travel teams for a decade, you can literally see how Steph has affected the way the kids play.</p>

<p>Not to be a dick but kids used to know their place, they only used to shoot 3s if they were good or decent at it, half of them, and most of the big men, would never attempt 3s at all, now every single kid will pull up from 3 like they thinking they’re some hot shit.</p>

<p>Steph, and the way the Warriors played, changed the game in a more meaningful way than that of any other player or team in my life time.</p>

      <label for="la5sdmd" class="commentText"><p>This. Before Steph, it was very very slow but surely trending to more 3’s. You had the era of stretch 4. It was painfully slow trending. Before Steph there was so much isolation plays, everyone standing around waiting for the ball to kick out, ball hogging, jacking up 25+ for low efficiency, or driving to the rim wanting to be like Mike or going to the foul line. Ball movement was ugly. Then Steph accelerated the 3 point revolution and spacing with gravity. The Warriors style of ball movement and off ball movement was a thing of beauty. Everyone touches the ball, everyone is moving. Very little isolation plays (which KD was annoyed with in his 3rd year lol, wanted more isolation plays). Charles Barkley hated this style of play. He liked just throwing the ball in the post to the big men and just pounding it. Kept saying jump shooting teams can’t win. Experts said dunks and shots close to the rim was the way to go, it’s the highest efficiency. How times of change. Curry showed, you can get that same efficiency at 3 point line and beyond.</p>

      <label for="la5vf88" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I think Steph and the Warriors influenced the kids coming through more than anything else. The Association was already going to a &ldquo;layups and 3s&rdquo; focus due to analytics. That is not Steph. Big men were already trying to become 3 point shooters more and more. But Steph being a relatively normal looking guy made every kid think they could shoot like Curry in a way few could think watching Shaq dunk, cool as it was. </p>
