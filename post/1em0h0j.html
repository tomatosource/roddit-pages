Com) and 4chan were huge and red pill was all over the place on there. Negging girls and red pill shit was also always being spewed there although most of those people were obviously trolling but the minority were serious. Tate just took the same red pill mentality and got a platform to reach even more younger kids. I&rsquo;ll give you one thing though back then I&rsquo;d never seen anyone actually act the way red pillers want you to act irl so it&rsquo;s crazy that young men are publicly doing it. Although this might be the causation of what some call the &ldquo;simping&rdquo; era.</p>

      <label for="lgxyxrj" class="commentText"><p>Walz is actually a great model of masculinity to counter the trends toward dominance-centered attitudes from people like Trump and Tate. Walz is quite plainly masculine and in no way effeminate, but his masculinity is centered on caring for others rather than dominating them. We need more role models like him.</p>

      <label for="lgxzc1i" class="commentText"><p>Bell Hooks did some great work on how a patriarchal society harms men. As she put it, “Learning to wear a mask (that word already embedded in the term “masculinity”) is the first lesson in patriarchal masculinity that a boy learns. He learns that his core feelings cannot be expressed if they do not conform to the acceptable behaviors sexism defines as male. Asked to give up the true self in order to realize the patriarchal ideal, boys learn self-betrayal early and are rewarded for these acts of soul murder.”</p>

<p>Or, in other words, “To indoctrinate boys into the rules of patriarchy, we force them to feel pain and to deny their feelings.”</p>

<p>As an Old, those quotes absolutely resonate with how things were when I grew up, and it is so great seeing those attitudes start to change.
The reactionary response from Tate/Trump and friends shows that real change is happening and they are fighting tooth and claw to stop it.</p>

      <label for="lgvpb2x" class="commentText"><p>Gotta understand Wade’s story to see what’s going on here. His Mom didn’t watch him play a game until he was in college. Could you imagine? That’s where his ferocious play style came from.</p>

<p>Fast forward and you have a child whose dad’s always gone and doesn’t like basketball like her sibling. Who also may or may not be crying out for his attention. Just like who? 😩😢</p>

<p>Makes perfect sense why he’s the All in Father who will go extra extra hard to support his kid. Pretty admirable</p>

      <label for="lgw8x1x" class="commentText"><p>Athletes&rsquo; marriages are so interesting. We always focus on the dawgs, or the really weird conservative ones. The mfs who are just good husbands and parents never get enough praise. They&rsquo;re like O-linemen.</p>

<p>Edit: They don&rsquo;t actually deserve praise. The mfs who get money and think they should just spray like an AR need to be criticized. The money is nice, but it doesn&rsquo;t compare to spending time. I don&rsquo;t have kids, but I despise the Cannon/Hill archetype.</p>

<p>Hope that makes somebody mad.</p>

<p>On the contrary, it’s actually <em>incredible</em> that he was able to shirk off all of that trauma and stop the cycle of terrible parenting in his family all at once. A vast majority of people with mean parents will also be mean parents, so it IS surprising he’s the all in father because he’s gotta be one motherfucking amazing human to do that after what he had growing up.</p>

<p>Showing up for at risk youth groups, many of the kids who have had rough childhoods / been disowned from their families are in this.</p>

<p>Donating money to reputable organizations who use it wisely.</p>

<p>Being an example in the community. You see someone calling something &ldquo;gay&rdquo; as a derogatory thing? Put a stop to that shit. Be an example for others of support and care.</p>

<p>Reach out to friends and family who are marginalized. Spend time with them so they don&rsquo;t feel alone.</p>

<p>Some of the biggest problems that LGBTQ youth face are drugs, condemnation, mental health crisis, and assault from shitheads. Usually they snowball together. A kid who is beaten at home for being gay, eventually disowned by their family, becomes homeless and gets on drugs, has a mental health crisis that isn&rsquo;t cared for, and commits suicide. I&rsquo;ve had multiple friends follow that path from high school. If they had just a few folks who were adults that stepped up and broke a link in that chain they could still be here today, living and thriving.</p>

      <label for="lgx7fc4" class="commentText"><p>Absolutely agree. As a straight white man myself I&rsquo;ve found that it&rsquo;s easy enough to not care, but finding the strength to speak up when someone else says something bad is much harder and it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m still learning. I hate any kind of conflict, but these days I&rsquo;m at least able to day &ldquo;hey that&rsquo;s pretty rude&rdquo; whenever I hear someone say something bigoted</p>

What you may not see is that it&rsquo;s not just the people that you are talking to who are affected, but other people who are scared to speak their mind realizing that they can. Amplifying ally voices not just in the moment, but in a trickle down effect.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a graph how gay marriage has changed over the years. It wasn&rsquo;t just one person shouting it out, it was others who saw that person and carried the message of love and tolerance to others, over and over.</p>

<p>So many “experts” on biology and “what a woman looks like” will look at that picture and …let it pass.</p>

<p>YMMV on exactly why. I don’t think it’s because she can beat them up. Imane Khelif can clearly kick the ass of more than half the basement dwelling fatties certain “she’s a man”.</p>

<p>I’m gonna say it’s the skin tone. Those People are only ever “certain it’s a man” when the woman is ALSO non-white.</p>

<p>Which is also, very sadly, why DWade’s daughter is a target for Those People.</p>
