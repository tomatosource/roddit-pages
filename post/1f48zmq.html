Fent is potent so I believe that’s why it’s used in bootleg drugs.  More bang for your buck.  So yeah, if you’re taking a bootleg opioid it makes sense it’s Fent lol</p>

      <label for="lkjgq21" class="commentText"><p>Excerpt from the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He played in 422 NBA games and started 255 of them, but Cauley-Stein’s last appearance in that league was March 2, 2022. It was an unceremonious ending, one measly minute of action to conclude a 10-day contract with the Philadelphia 76ers. A last gasp after he stepped away from the Dallas Mavericks in late November 2021 — the team cited “personal reasons” — and then it waived him in January. What almost nobody knew at the time, and what he never previously has discussed publicly, is that Cauley-Stein was in the middle of a 65-day stay at an inpatient rehabilitation center for substance abuse.</p>

<p>He thought the substance he had been abusing was bootleg Percocet, a combination of oxycodone and acetaminophen, which is bad enough. He had been eating those by the handful to numb his pain, he told the rehab center upon check-in, so it could expect to see that on his drug test. But it didn’t.</p>

<p>It turns out, he had been buying fake pills, laced with fentanyl. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s website describes fentanyl as 100 times more potent than morphine and 50 times more potent than heroin. “One pill can kill” is the DEA’s slogan, and the agency estimates about 70 percent of the 80 million fentanyl-laced fake pills it seized in 2023 contained a potentially lethal dose.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know until I turned myself in. I looked at my wife and said, ‘Oh, my God’ because I hear stories all the time about kids going to a party, never taking a drug before, deciding to pop a Percocet, and it ends up being fentanyl, and they die. From one pill,” Cauley-Stein said. “Dude, I was taking hundreds of them, for months and years. It could’ve so easily been me.”</p>

<p>One of the friends Cauley-Stein made in rehab was only out for five days, he said, after a 75-day stay, before he overdosed and died.</p>

<p>“You could kind of tell the way he was walking around that he wasn’t ready to leave yet, that he still wanted to do it,” Cauley-Stein said. “Not me. There’s nothing you could ever tell me to get me to do that again. I want no part of it.”</p>

He advocated for rehabilitative drug court, he was clean for years, he fell off the wagon and died because he was no longer in control of himself, and was taken advantage of and abused by unscrupulous monsters.</p>

<p>I’m glad Willie Cauley-Stein seems adamant not to go back to the abyss but that’s always the biggest risk with addicts, and people around him should still keep an eye on him no matter how lucid and genuine he seems. Addicts fool themselves even more easily than they do others.</p>

Plenty of people are (btw people who use coffee, nicotine, Tylenol, energy drinks, soda, alcohol, etc. on a daily basis are also “drug users” perfectly responsible when using illicit drugs. But you won’t hear a story about what didn’t happen because someone had their shit together</p>

<p>Also the actual answer to your sarcastic, rhetorical question is the War on Drugs, income inequality, anti-education/false propaganda, and lack of affordable healthcare access, including mental healthcare</p>

<p>If drugs were legal and regulated, people wouldn’t have to worry about buying something else and getting fentanyl</p>

      <label for="lkjmizq" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s cheap, the make it by the boatload in china and it is so strong you can smuggle a shit ton of doses in a very small area. The reason it&rsquo;s such a problem is due to drugs being illegal and unregulated, the people making pills or selling drugs can put whatever they want in them and there are no repercussions. And the drugs being illegal isn&rsquo;t stopping people from doing drugs at all, drug use continues to climb regardless of the laws in place to curb use.</p>

<p>So we can continue to keep drugs unregulated and illegal, making criminals wealthy and have very little impact on overall drug use but have overdoses skyrocket due to the black market drug supply being pumped full of cheap fent, and feel better about ourselves because it&rsquo;s only evil drug addicts dying, or we could legalize and regulate drugs that would probably lead to a likely a small, perhaps moderate increase in overall drug use but see overdoses and deaths see a massive decrease.</p>

<p>Most people dying of overdoses aren&rsquo;t trying to use fent, it&rsquo;s people like Cauley-Stein. What do you think we are going to do? Double down on what isn&rsquo;t working, obviously.</p>

      <label for="lkjm6ob" class="commentText"><p>This is a reminder to NEVER take grey/black market drugs without a way to test them.  This includes &ldquo;pharmaceuticals&rdquo; as it has become exceedingly popular to make &ldquo;presses&rdquo; using fentanyl to mimic these legitimate painkillers and anti-anxiety meds due to the low cost of fentanyl and its analogues.  People pressing pills at home have no way to homogenize the pills, so half the pill could have all the fentanyl (if you&rsquo;re thinking &ldquo;i&rsquo;ll just take half and see&rdquo;).</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it looks real.  The only thing that can tell you what you actually have are reagents and fentanyl testers.  Be safe out there.</p>
