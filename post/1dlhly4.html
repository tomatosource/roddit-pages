      <label for="l9p7nbr" class="commentText"><p>How do you scale this though?  </p>

<p> He’s huge by even elite of elite nba standards. He’ll dominate any age group on the size front and only fall of in a group when the skills are quite high level and he’s getting bodied by people 2,3,4,5 years older than him cause he was literally 12? It’s like it instantly flips from he dominates to they dominate and hurt him. And even at any level he’ll still be that same super tall kid doing the same thing. There is no balancing this any rational way lol  </p>

<p> Probably best to keep him where he is so he can work on the basic fundamentals he really needed at that size. Putting him 5 years up he wouldn’t be able to learn to do a single dribble. </p>

      <label for="l9p8net" class="commentText"><p>My argument would be that older age group would have more weight and skill for the bigs to at least try to push him further out.  Plus better coordination on double/triple teams. That makes him have to develop more post moves, rather than just go to the block and dunk.</p>

      <label for="l9p9q1j" class="commentText"><p>Exactly. He isn’t learning basic fundamentals playing kids literally half his height and when he’s a full hand length above the rim while not jumping. He would probably be a better basketball player now had they actually played him up at least a couple of years so he had so competition and had to improvise rather than just LOL dunk on people who can’t even touch my armpit.</p>

      <label for="l9pa58q" class="commentText"><p>Yeah but his post moves, dribbling, off ball movement, speed, etc are/were certainly all garbage. Not cause he’s bad but because he was 12 and had to manage 7 feet plus of body. </p>

<p>In those fields he was at or below his age group, no sense in making him practice that in a tougher league. It would have just forced him to rely exclusively on catching the ball high and dunking, he wouldn’t be able to develop any other move. </p>

<p>Like imagine your typical 12 year old (reminder he was probably worse than typical too) and how useless they’d be in a u15 league. So much improvement happens at those ages, they’d literally be useless.  Now imagine that but to dribble you gotta throw the ball down 4 feet lol kid needed to play within his age I think. </p>

      <label for="l9p8dga" class="commentText"><p>I mean probably like 14-15 year olds, most kids are hitting puberty and getting growth spurts. Plenty of very talented kids in sports are playing 3+ years ahead talent. Getting bodied? Maybe for a normal kid but at his height at that time he’s still taller than 99.9% of kids and would still likely be able to just sit paint and dunk. You aren’t learning any fundamentals when there is literally 0 competition to push you to learn new things.</p>

      <label for="l9p9oj0" class="commentText"><p>I meant getting bodied like literally physically getting bodied. That size of personal is immensely susceptible to injury, we all see the crazy stuff wby does to try to protect himself. I can imagine someone taller and in the awkward physical and growing phase of being 12 or 13. </p>

<p>Too much physicality, even from much shorter kids, but ones that have 2-4 years of speed and muscle would undoubtedly increase his odds of serious injury immensely. I’m sure gameplay wise he’d be fine a year or 2 up, as he’s literally a human cheat code. </p>

<p>But again that won’t improve his game much more, if anything it would make him more reliant on catching the ball at 8 feet and finger rolling it in the hoop. His development in all other aspects of play - dribbling, shooting, movement, etc certainly is at his age group or lower. Give him some room to work on that stuff in the right environment.  3 years up he’d be improving nothing but raising his hand. </p>

<p>If it were my kid I’d fight all day to keep him in age group. Just avoid injury, have dad or coach instruct him to practice more of the mid game to get those reps in even in real games. That would be the fairest way to “balance” him while facilitating long term improvement and keeping him relatively safe. </p>

      <label for="l9pa5co" class="commentText"><p>Dude, he was 6’10 at 12 years old and was likely already 200+ pounds. He’s not getting bodied as his strength isn’t relative to a normal 12 year old. He would be able to bully around some 14-15 year old kids. And again, he’s not learning anything from playing with kids his age. He would develop faster playing 14-15 year olds so he had actual competition and would need to improvise rather than sitting in the paint and dunking.</p>

      <label for="l9paibf" class="commentText"><p>His strength? No, his tendons, ligaments, knees?  Kids probably had to learn how to maneuver and roll around competition as he’s grown up to avoid someone hitting his leg funny and snapping it in half. No chance id toss him in with kids 50-70lbs heavier overnight, who have started gym work, when he’s literally brand new to being 7feet tall.   </p>

<p>  Bro go watch a video of a baby giraffe. You’re trying to make that thing play high school ball for real </p>

      <label for="l9payrz" class="commentText"><p>He’s not brand new to being tall lmao he was taller than an average man at 8 years old. It’s not like he was hitting some crazy growth spurts like a lot of other guys who get tall during puberty. His height growth has been pretty linear and he hasn’t been freakishly skinny like other big kids.</p>

      <label for="l9p97y1" class="commentText"><p>No joke my uncle coached him when he was around 12-14. Kid’s super awesome but MAN was it tough for him to be that big. They had to take breaks every hour or so on road trips to get him a chance to stretch. He also had to essentially learn basketball like a toddler, because things that may seem simple for us like running and catching the ball at the same time are exceptionally difficult when your body is growing at such an insane rate and your coordination is all out of whack. Once his growth slowed he started to really come into his own though, and he’s much more fluid now. Would love to see him succeed!</p>

<p>Devs really messed this one up, releasing this character without testing. Completely OP.</p>

Although, if he doesn&rsquo;t develop any quickness, I can see plenty of teams puttin him in a pick &amp; roll situation to pull him away from the paint. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to keep an eye on him for sure over the next few years.</p>
