<p>**Who is the Greatest NBA Player Since 1980? A Data-Driven Analysis**</p>

<p>Hey r/nba,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on a comprehensive analysis to determine the greatest NBA player from 1980 to the present. I used a consistent formula across four decades (1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s) to ensure fairness and objectivity. Here’s how I approached the task:</p>

<h1 id="methodology">Methodology</h1>

<ol>
<li>**Data Collection:** I gathered key performance statistics and accolades for each player, including:

<ul>
<li>Points per game (PPG)</li>
<li>Rebounds per game (RPG)</li>
<li>Assists per game (APG)</li>
<li>Steals per game (SPG)</li>
<li>Blocks per game (BPG)</li>
<li>Three-point percentage (3P%)</li>
<li>MVP awards</li>
<li>Defensive Player of the Year awards (DPOYs)</li>
<li>Championships</li>
<li>Finals MVPs (FMVPs)</li>
<li>All-NBA and All-Defensive team selections</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Normalization and Scaling:</strong> Each statistic and accolade was normalized against peers within the same decade. For example:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><strong>On-Court Stats:</strong> Michael Jordan led the 1980s in scoring with 32.6 PPG. Being the top scorer, his contribution in this category was assigned the maximum score of 50. This was calculated by determining a scaling factor: Scaling Factor = 50 / 32.6 ≈ 1.53. Thus, Jordan&rsquo;s normalized score was 32.6 * 1.53 ≈ 50. Using the same scaling factor, Adrian Dantley, with 26.5 PPG, received 26.5 * 1.53 ≈ 41, and Dominique Wilkins, with 26 PPG, received 26 * 1.53 ≈ 40.</li>
<li><strong>Accolades:</strong> Larry Bird won 3 MVPs in the 1980s, the most in that decade, so he was assigned the maximum score of 50. The scaling factor here was 50 / 3 ≈ 16.666. Therefore, Moses Malone and Magic Johnson, each with 2 MVPs, received 2 * 16.666 ≈ 33.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><strong>All-NBA and All-Defensive Teams:</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><strong>All-NBA Teams:</strong> Points were assigned as follows: 1st Team selections were multiplied by 25, 2nd Team by 15, and 3rd Team by 10. For example, Larry Bird, with 9 First Team and 1 Second Team All-NBA selections in the 1980s, had a total score of: (9 * 25) + (1 * 15) = 240. To normalize this to a maximum of 50, the top score (240 in this case) was divided by 4.8, giving a scaling factor of 4.8. Thus, Bird’s normalized score was 240 / 4.8 = 50.

<ul>
<li>**All-Defensive Teams:** A similar method was used, focusing only on 1st and 2nd Team All-Defensive selections.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>**Weighting of Scores:** Each normalized category was then weighted to reflect its importance in the final composite score:

<ul>
<li>PPG * 9</li>
<li>RPG * 6</li>
<li>APG * 6</li>
<li>SPG * 5</li>
<li>BPG * 5</li>
<li>3P% * 6</li>
<li>MVP * 10</li>
<li>DPOY * 9</li>
<li>Championships * 13</li>
<li>FMVP * 11</li>
<li>All-NBA selections * 10</li>
<li>All-Defensive selections * 10</li>
</ul></li>
<li>**Composite Score Calculation:** I summed the weighted, normalized values across all categories to create a final composite score, labeled as &ldquo;TOTAL.&rdquo; This score represents the player&rsquo;s overall impact and greatness.</li>
<li>**Consistency Across Decades:** The same normalization, scaling, and weighting formula were applied to each decade, allowing for an unbiased and consistent comparison of players across different time periods.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="results">Results</h1>

<p>Based on this methodology, here are the top 15 players from each decade. The player pool chosen are the top 50 in points for each decade.</p>

<h1 id="standout-points-for-each-era">Standout Points for Each Era</h1>

<p>**1980s:**</p>

<ul>
<li>**Larry Bird** and **Magic Johnson** dominated the decade, consistently showing up at the top in multiple categories.</li>
<li>Despite only playing six years in the 80s and not winning a championship, **Michael Jordan** had the highest per-game rating, almost 0.8 points ahead of Bird.</li>
<li>**Moses Malone** is criminally underrated in discussions but had a strong impact throughout the decade.</li>
<li>**Sidney Moncrief** was surprisingly high, partly due to his two DPOYs and four-time All-Defensive First Team selections.</li>
</ul>

<p>**1990s:**</p>

<ul>
<li>**Michael Jordan** was more dominant than initially thought, having the highest per-game composite score of any decade and the second highest composite total despite missing the 94, 99 seasons and most of 95.</li>
<li>**Alonzo Mourning** appears underrated in this decade, scoring 3.16 on a per-game basis, which is higher than Karl Malone and John Stockton, among others.</li>
<li>**Scottie Pippen** demonstrated his excellence, ranking high in multiple categories.</li>
</ul>

<p>**2000s:**</p>

<ul>
<li>**Tim Duncan** was a beast, taking the top spot in both total and composite scores.</li>
<li>**Dwyane Wade** was second in per-game rating, while **Kobe Bryant** was second in total score.</li>
<li>**Ron Artest (Metta Sandiford-Artest)** was a big surprise, ranking ahead of players like Paul Pierce, Chauncey Billups, and Tracy McGrady, bolstered by his DPOY award and multiple All-Defensive Team selections.</li>
</ul>

<p>**2010s:**</p>

<ul>
<li>**LeBron James** owned the 2010s, having the highest composite score and the third-highest per-game score of any decade, behind MJ&rsquo;s 80s and 90s.</li>
<li>**Stephen Curry** ranked fifth in the decade on a per-game basis, behind LeBron, Kobe, and surprisingly, Anthony Davis. Davis&rsquo;s high ranking is due to his All-Defensive Team selections and comparable scoring averages.</li>
<li>**Marc Gasol** was a standout surprise, ranking sixth in total and ninth in per-game composite scores.</li>
<li><em>**Kawhi Leonard** added in later as he didn&rsquo;t qualify in my original rankings as only took the top 50 scorers of the decade by total points. Once i added him in, his 2 championships, FMVP, 2 DPoY, and 3 first team all defense selections took to number 2 total and number 1 on a per game basis. I definitely need to change some things, but Kawhi&rsquo;s impact was crazy absurd</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The player pool for each era consisted of the top 50 players in total points scored during the decade. I did not include free throw shooting or three-pointers made in the analysis due to inherent biases: free throw percentages tend to disadvantage big men, and three-pointer made are less relevant for eras before the 2010s.</p>

<p>Accolade information was primarily sourced from Statmuse. However, I noticed some inaccuracies, such as initially recording Carmelo Anthony with zero All-NBA teams in the 2000s. Upon further investigation, I discovered he actually had three 3rd Team All-NBA selections in that era.</p>

<p>The file: You can view the detailed analysis and data in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OEyyihv7ac2rWaQYuDgJMtUgNREJlNI0qMOh49G18ao/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OEyyihv7ac2rWaQYuDgJMtUgNREJlNI0qMOh49G18ao/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>

<p>EDIT: One thing I forgot to mention is the reason I included certain seemingly arbitrary stats. I focused on comparing the top 50 scorers from each decade to see how they measured up against each other. This is why players like Dennis Rodman, who was more of a defensive or rebound specialist, aren&rsquo;t included. This approach not only cut down on time but also ensured that the pool consisted of the team&rsquo;s top players, who are usually among the top scorers.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t place a heavy weight on blocks and steals because All-Defensive Team selections and DPOY awards already carried significant weight.</p>

<p>I included All-NBA and All-Defensive Team selections because they provide a good measure of how the league viewed players during their careers. For instance, Sidney Moncrief&rsquo;s two DPOY awards as a guard during an era dominated by big men is an impressive achievement that should be reflected.</p>

<p>Championships also weigh heavily in the analysis because winning titles is the ultimate goal. This explains why Scottie Pippen ranks higher than Charles Barkley, or why Tracy McGrady, despite being a phenomenal player, doesn&rsquo;t make the top 10.</p>

I still remember when he made a video on &lsquo;the statistical GOAT season&rsquo;, and simply added together basic box score stats, while also giving +15 points (or something like that), for winning a DPOY &ldquo;to take care of the defensive side of the ball&rdquo;. He ended up with Jordan&rsquo;s 1987-88 as the clear GOAT season, which, if you ask me, isn&rsquo;t a terrible season to choose, however I just hate how he acts like he isn&rsquo;t arbitrarily choosing whatever formula he wants to get the outcome he so pleases. He also conveniently left out all seasons prior to 1975, because lo and behold, someone like Wilt would destroy if you are simply adding together points, rebounds, and assists to make your GOAT case. He makes cool looking charts sometimes though.</p>

      <label for="l71fpze" class="commentText"><p>Plus by just existing a team is basically guaranteed to get 40% of available boards in a season.</p>

<p>The best offensive rebounding team going back to 04 is the 04 jazz at 34.1%, the worst is the <sup>17</sup>&frasl;<sub>18</sub> Mavs at 18%.</p>

<p>The worst defensive rebounding ream was the 04/5 blazers at 67.7%. The highest was the <sup>19</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> Bucks at 81.9%</p>

<p>So literally the worst offensive and defensive rebounding teams combined would still have ab overall rebound rate of 42.3% and the best possible would be 58%</p>

<p>On a game to game by basis you are basically saying teams are competing for at the absolute maximum 20% of the boards at most (that&rsquo;s double what the worst and best rebounding teams averaged). There&rsquo;s 80-90 boards in a game per hundred, I&rsquo;m going to use 85 for simplicity which is equivalent to 21 boards available per game for a team to seize from the other team.</p>

<p>At least half of rebounding is team philosophy. For instance in <sup>21</sup>&frasl;<sub>22</sub> the raptors were second in offensive rebounding behind the Grizzlies. The grizzlies have one of the bets offensive rebounders of all time. The raptors had Chris Boucher at the 5 spot. If you crash the glass hard you&rsquo;ll be in fairly good shape in terms of rebounding%. So let&rsquo;s say players account for about 10 of those boards a game.</p>

<p>Well it stands to reason that as good as someone can be on the glass someone can be that bad. Ergo about half that rebounding is from below average rebounders. That leaves just 5. Well you aren&rsquo;t on the floor all 100 possessions. Let&rsquo;s be generous and say 80 possessions (when for most bigs it will be more like 60 and even most stars it&rsquo;s like 72 ish). That leaves 4 rebounds positive rebounders are influencing. Well there are 10 players on the court. And since we are assuming half are below average rebounders we make that 5. <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> is 0.8 obviously there will be varying degrees of positive and negative. But if you say that the average positive rebounder is adding 0.5 boards a game which is basically the minimum I think to really have a measurable impact ob a players value that just leaves 2 boards for the elite rebounder to decide.</p>

<p>And even that is with some generous assumptions on their behalf. Like the fact that Teams are only guaranteed 30% in aggregate. As I said even with great rebounding teams vs terrible it&rsquo;s probably closer to 35%. Plus the possessions limit. I think less generous and probably more accurate assumptions would result in roughly 75% of the valuations fo each. So that&rsquo;s 9/16th, which takes 2 down to 1.125.</p>

<p>And all of a sudden you are looking at that like well if that&rsquo;s Dennis Rodman or Steven Adams value on the glass how much value is Sabonis really providing from his rebounding? Certainly his ability to progress the ball provides value but the rebounding on isolation? Like maybe less than a point a game.</p>

<p>Then I look at a stat like drapm and I see Jokic is like +3 in the possession component for defence because of his rebounding. Which is literally his entire outlier status from like 21-23. You remove that component and all of a sudden steph, Embiid, Giannis, Kawhi and Pg13 are all basically level with him.</p>

<p>The reason drapm associates rebounds with good defence is because the data it was trained on was kevin garnett, Ben Wallace and Tim Duncan these sorts of overwhelming defensive presences who were also unbelievable defensive rebounders.</p>

<p>The d-rapm thing is just because of the detritus that is Jokic&rsquo;s backup. But it makes absolutely zero sense that a player can simply be that valuable as a defensive rebounder. Like they&rsquo;d literally have to be like providing Dennis Rodman + Steven Adams offensive rebounding value on the defensive glass which simply doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. It&rsquo;s just an indictment of how appalling Jordan and Nnaji has been and maybe an assignment of some of Aaron Gordon&rsquo;s production too.</p>

      <label for="l71d9lh" class="commentText"><p>There isn&rsquo;t even an efficiency component. Why not weight TS+ for all all-nba players that season who scored over a certain threshold. And why are we counting all-defensive selections and all-nba selections? That&rsquo;s double counting, all-nba already includes defence.</p>

<p>Compare steph and Kawhi Leonard, prime to prime steph is better. He was better literally every season of their shared careers except for maybe 2019 (imo steph was still better and it&rsquo;s just ring bias that people say Kawhi). Steph was also an all-nba player 10 times, Kawhi 6 times. But because of including all-defensive selections Kawhi gets an extra 30 points on steph. Why? Fuck you that&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p>Plus the ppg evaluation is whack as fuck too. Like the methodology is logical but he&rsquo;s just taking single season ppg. So like when someone has a crazy volume season it suppresses others in that year&rsquo;s values. A more appropriate way to do it would be to do rolling 5 year points per 75. Or use inflation adjusted points per 100 and then average it over the whole period to get the results.</p>

<p>I will die on the hill that, despite his poor shooting and non-existent spacing, Ben Wallace was a great offensive player because he had whole seasons with more offensive rebounds than field goals missed.</p>

His absolute ineptitude offensively definitely made it harder for his teammates to score at a time where scoring was already hard enough, but he did make up for some of it due to his offensive rebounding.</p>

      <label for="l6zxnjf" class="commentText"><p>I hate when people use steals and blocks to make up these funky advanced stats. If steals and blocks can&rsquo;t accurately depict great defenders, than why should you lump them into an advanced stat themselves? Some great defenders don&rsquo;t have relatively high steals or blocks, but they are amazing at just making players take bad shots or rushed shots.</p>

<p>If they were to be used in this formula, I would say the value of points, assists and rebounds should be far greater than the value of a steal or a block. A steal should be valued higher than a block significantly as well. A block doesn&rsquo;t guarantee you change possessions and even sometimes allow teams to get a better shot off when they can set up an out of bounds play. My 2 cents.</p>

      <label for="l701g4d" class="commentText"><p>Thanks for your input. I get where you&rsquo;re coming from. Steals and blocks can sometimes be misleading when evaluating defensive greatness. There are definitely players who don&rsquo;t rack up high steal or block numbers but are still elite defenders because they excel at making opponents take bad or rushed shots.</p>

<p>In my analysis, I tried to balance this by including DPOY awards and All-Defensive Team selections, which I think better capture overall defensive impact. I did consider giving more weight to points, assists, and rebounds compared to steals and blocks. And you&rsquo;re right—steals can be more valuable than blocks since a block doesn&rsquo;t always change possession and can even lead to a better shot opportunity for the other team.</p>

<p>This list is primarily comparing the best offensive players. Some of them happen to be great defenders too, but defense was more of a luxury and a tie-breaker in this analysis.</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing your thoughts. It&rsquo;s always good to get different perspectives on this!</p>

      <label for="l70b0d9" class="commentText"><p>I would assume the main reason is that they are something that can be easily measured. A much better measure of impact would be something like FG% when a player is defending the shooter or the nearest defender to the shooter in addition to some other measurement that shows shots a player doesn&rsquo;t take when he is guarded by the player. That&rsquo;s harder to measure and might not be measurable when looking at data from older decades.</p>

      <label for="l6zogg2" class="commentText"><p>I mean respect for the work you put in but these numbers used for valuing the stats doesn&rsquo;t really make sense. I think an assist is more valuable than a rebound.</p>

<p>An assist is also more valuable than a point.</p>

<p>Reasoning: An assist is worth at least 2 points</p>

<p>An FMVP should be worth more than a championship.</p>

<p>Reasoning: Winning a championship as the #1 should be worth more than winning a championship as a role player</p>

<p>A MVP should be worth more than a DPOY than a bit</p>

<p>Reasoning: MVP takes into account all sides of the ball and also factors in team record more and stuff like that than DPOY.</p>

<p>Why are All NBA selections and All Defense selections equivalent to a MVP and more valuable than a DPOY?</p>

<p>Also I dont like the measure of the 3p% stat. Completely takes away the idea of volume</p>

<p>That depends on if the assist creates the basket or if the basket credited the assist. </p>

<p>Like guys like Magic actually created the basket for the player scoring. </p>

<p>But I can point out multiple examples of a simple pass to a teammate and the the teammate makes a tough shot but the passer still gets the assist. His assist didn’t have the same impact as the previous assist described. </p>

<p>So with better data, you can separate the two. I would say an assist is worth at most 3 points but can be worth less than 2 points if a lot of the work is done by the guy who scored. </p>

      <label for="l6zvrs2" class="commentText"><p>Thanks for taking a look guys. I was super bored and decided to try something since I had nothing else to do. Took a little bit to put it together. What would be good suggestions for weighted changes? I have scoring higher because I value that more. But i can see why that may skew a few things the wrong way. I didn&rsquo;t want to get into analytics too much like PER, etc, because those stats aren&rsquo;t available as far as I know in the 80s.</p>

<p>I originally did this to find out who the numbers said the GOAT was, so that&rsquo;s why I only used the top 50 in points scored for the decades in question. It quickly morphed into the best of each era so theoretically things like pace and other era defining things shouldn&rsquo;t matter. In turn I probably should add 3 pointers to this for the 2010s.</p>

<p>My only observation is that quantifying subjective awards in the equation may snub certain players out of the list.</p>

<p>ROY, MVP, DPOY, WCF AND ECF MVP, and FINALS MVP, while largely based on stats, are ULTIMATELY voted upon and therefore are skewed by whatever biases were at play that otherwise should’ve gone to the player.</p>

<p>Probably could expound on the rubric for said awards, to include distributing points to votes received vs one ultimate point to only one singular person for winning the singular award.</p>

<p>Beyond that, this list puts too much emphasis on scoring.</p>

<p>Mookie Blaylock and Tim Hardaway were more valuable than Dennis Rodman? Nope. Reality is that defensive value cannot be approximated solely from things like BPG/SPG and accolades. You would need to somehow look at opponent points/possession and how that changes on a 1v1 and 5v5 basis when a certain guy is on the court.</p>

<p>To use a current player as an example, Wemby&rsquo;s defensive impact will show up in the BPG category, but he is also compacting the court and forcing bad looks by his mere presence, which doesn&rsquo;t show up in counting stats.</p>

<p>Nice effort, but this has no real value tbh.</p>

      <label for="l70289a" class="commentText"><p>I totally get where you&rsquo;re coming from. This approach isn&rsquo;t perfect and has its limits, especially with defensive value. The main reason I included awards like MVP and FMVP is that they show how players were seen during their careers—highlighting their peak performance and big moments, which are hard to capture with stats alone.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right, this list does focus a lot on scoring. I started this project to try and figure out once and for all who the GOAT is and to shine a light on players who had a huge impact but might be forgotten over time. Looking at the top 50 scorers of each decade gave me a consistent group to compare across eras. Scoring is a big part of a player&rsquo;s impact, so it ended up being a major factor.</p>

<p>I did try to balance things out by including All-Defensive Team selections and DPOY awards to give props to defensive efforts. Guys like Mookie Blaylock and Tim Hardaway rank higher because of their offensive stats, but I totally get that someone like Dennis Rodman had a massive impact that&rsquo;s not fully shown by traditional stats. Defensive value is tricky to measure, especially with how someone like Wemby can change the game just by being on the court.</p>

<p>This analysis is just one way to look at player impact, with a focus on offense and traditional accolades. It&rsquo;s not the be-all and end-all, but I hope it adds to the discussion and highlights some impactful players. Thanks for the feedback—love hearing different perspectives!</p>

I would love to see this updated after reading some of these recommendations, cause I do believe there are some good ones in this thread. I don’t agree with this user because I think mvp, fmvp, all-nba etc are useful in this approach. However, they are subjective awards and should be worth less than what you have them at since people vote on them, because media/coaches/fans can be bias. More should be weighed on objective data like stats, win shares, FG%, etc.</p>

<p>Additionally, and this may be an unpopular opinion, but I think less should be weight on championships too. There are guys on this list that are too high because they were role players on a team that won multiple chips (like Ron Artest) and other that were great but are prob too high (like Scottie Pippen, Kevin McHale) because they won many championships. Just my thoughts.</p>

<p>Also quick question, why did you add 3pt% but not FG%?</p>

<p>Again, I love this idea of this type of data analysis. I only wonder what it would look like if you did this in a player’s full career. Cause some players (like Jordan and LeBron) were so dominant in multiple decades and there numbers would look even better!</p>

      <label for="l71ak80" class="commentText"><p>i disagree. blocks and hype and narratives have made a skewed perception of whemby&rsquo;s defense as elite. it is not elite. hes a great shot blocker but a poor post defender.</p>

<p>i mean not poor compared to other positions but poor for a center. he constantly got scored on in the post. everyone was putting up career or really good games against him while getting few shots blocked. embid 70pts&hellip; can you really say your an elite defender if someone goes 70 on you&hellip;. sengun  45 career high then said hes just not strong enough yet. zubac would barley miss a shot against him.  and im not even talking points either most these guys had 12+ rebounds as well.</p>

<p>theres many examples im sure but i know what i saw every time i watched him. im not saying he should be able to stand his ground hes so thin and obviously that will change. but this campaigning of wemby defense just to hype him up is just straight fake narrative pushing.</p>

<p>it reminds me of what people did with evan mobley where people liked him as a prospect so much they just started jumping the gun so he could win accolades as he did getting dpoy votes. hes not even the best big man defender on his own team&hellip; people saying wemby should have been in dpoy convo this year as well its pretty telling i mean his team was probably the worst defensive team as well</p>

      <label for="l71e9lg" class="commentText"><p>This is such a stupid comment lmao, players had career highs because they were playing against the <em>Spurs,</em> which are literally the worst defense of all time without Wemby. If you look at matchup head-to-heads Wemby did a great job against Jokic, Embiid, &amp; co. And Şengün had one good game out of 3, the other 2 he struggled massively against Wemby (Şengün shot 51% FG when guarded by Wemby)</p>

      <label for="l702tkj" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I get that Scottie Pippen at 3 and Charles Barkley at 8 might seem surprising, and Isiah being lower too. Here&rsquo;s the deal: Scottie Pippen&rsquo;s all-around game and contributions to the Bulls&rsquo; championships really boosted his score. He racked up a lot of All-Defensive Team selections and had solid stats across the board, not just scoring.</p>

<p>As for Barkley, even though he was an amazing player and a scoring machine, the lack of championships and fewer All-Defensive Team nods put him a bit lower. Championships were weighted heavily in this analysis, so that had a big impact.</p>

<p>Isiah Thomas was a fantastic player and a key part of the Pistons&rsquo; success, but his individual accolades and stats didn&rsquo;t measure up as high compared to some of the others in this specific formula. However, on a per-game basis, Isiah came in at 8th, right behind Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Julius Erving, Moses Malone, James Worthy, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. I think that&rsquo;s pretty fair, to be honest.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s definitely not a perfect system, but it tries to balance out different aspects of a player&rsquo;s career. Hope that makes sense!</p>

      <label for="l70hs5q" class="commentText"><p>Statmuse is absolutely terrible as a source of record.  It flat out lies sometimes.  Also, you can get very different answers for the same query run on different days or from different browsers.  Basketball Reference is what I use for all of my analysis.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve broken this out by decade and ordered by composite total.  That&rsquo;s not really what your title states.  Who is the best player since &lsquo;80?  By composite total across decades it appears to be close between LeBron and Jordan.  Is total the best measuring stick or is composite per game played?  You&rsquo;ve failed to draw an overall conclusion after doing all of the heavy work.</p>

<p>One thing that would change things up a bit.  I think normalizing by decade is decent but ideally you&rsquo;d have to normalize each player by the time window of their career.  Unfortunately that would be a significant amount more work.  I&rsquo;d probably write some software to do it, frankly.</p>

I don&rsquo;t have an extensive background in analysis, but I&rsquo;ve been playing Daily Fantasy Sports for the past 9 years. Through that experience, I taught myself how to differentiate from the field, and hardcore analysis became my go-to method. Gathering the data and establishing the logic for this project was definitely the challenging part. Thanks again for the encouragement!</p>

      <label for="l714581" class="commentText"><p>Analyses like this are impossible to make objective because the creator injects their opinion into the weighting factors. In this case, the largest weights are assigned to championships and finals MVPs, which is fine and totally reasonable, but why 13 and 11? Why not 8 and 15, or whatever? It feels like approaches like this are trying to add the illusion of quantitative rigor to a &ldquo;fact&rdquo;, when in truth the opinion is still hiding in the mathematical details.</p>

      <label for="l70b1v6" class="commentText"><p>i think the model overvalues defensive teams. funnily enough, ibaka/gasol made the 10s list but not their 2x finals mvp in the decade. also, artest over paul pierce/tmac/the majority of the players below him</p>

      <label for="l70duwr" class="commentText"><p>I noticed that too. I think i overvauled defense too much. I just added Kawhi as he wasn&rsquo;t in my original comparison and he on a per game basis did better than LeBron. I&rsquo;ll have to go back and redo the formula. It&rsquo;s just so objective, i really don&rsquo;t know where to start.</p>

<p>Good to see Wade come up in the analysis.  He doesn&rsquo;t get his just dues.  One of the greatest 2 way playmakers ever.</p>

      <label for="l71ce5h" class="commentText"><p>Alex English didn’t even make the top 15 in the 1980s? He’s the leading scorer in the 80s.  </p>

<p>I know scoring isn’t everything, but you have Mo Cheeks in the top 15. English was clearly the better player. </p>

<p>The one flaw I see is that you are weighing All-NBA selections the same as an All-NBA Defensive selection. Both are given a 10 multiplier. That should not be the case. All-NBA should be worth 3x as much as an All-Defensive team. </p>

<p>Also looking at total statistics rather than per game should be incorporated (use both would be my suggestion). </p>

<p>The fact that both were from the same draft class and Dream was taken higher would have made it extra spicy.</p>
