      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fdaaii/how_come_the_hawks_after_2015_hawks_didnt_stay_on/"><p>How come the Hawks after 2015 Hawks didn’t stay on the same level after their 60 win season and their ECF appearance?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>In 2015, The Hawks went 60-22 and were the 1st seed in the East over the Cavs that had 3 All-Stars. They had 4 Players who became All-Stars (Although only because the East was weak and the team was good). They were 6th in both Offensive rtg and defensive rtg.</p>

<p>Unfortunately after that season, They never reached to that level again. They still had the almost same starting lineup but Bazemore was now the starting SF. But they regressed to 48-34 and had a bottom 10 offense although they had the 2nd best defense. They made it to the 2nd round but were swept by the Cavs.</p>

<p>The next season after that, There was some changes. Al was gone, Korver was traded, Teague was gone, but still had Millsap. They had a lineup of Schröder, Bazemore, Hardaway jr., Millsap and Dwight Howard. Their offense was worse and regressed to 43-39 but they still had the 4th best defense.</p>

<p>Unfortunately after that, The team fell apart. Their Top 3 Players from last season were gone and finished the 2018 season last in the East with a 24-58 record.</p>

<p>Did the Hawks had a fluke year in 2015? Did they lacked a superstar?</p>

      <label for="lmebt99" class="commentText"><p>I mean you pretty much described it: both years they weren&rsquo;t as good as the Cavs and then they lost all their players.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re strictly looking at regular season wins, 60 wins is hard to replicate for anybody, much less a team full of solid role players.</p>

<p>Going from DMC to Bazemore in 2016 was a pretty big downgrade to both the starting lineup and the bench.</p>

<p>Sidenote - we inexplicably stopped running high PnPs for reasons that have never been explained. This was such a bread and butter play for us that someone needs to ask Budenholzer WTF happened.</p>

      <label for="lmet8ul" class="commentText"><p>How Bud utilized Korver caught a ton of teams with their pants down. Remember, centers back then were not just slower on average, but they still weren’t used to needing to switch onto perimeter players and hedge.</p>

<p>The way 3 point shooting still worked back then was that the role players helped space the court out for the star player when they’re initiating the offense. Hawks did an inverse version of this that was pretty novel in 2015 where Bud used Korver, his floor spacer, to actually initiate offense sometimes. The moment Teague brought the ball up they ran high offball screens with Korver and Milsap/Horford. Centers looked foolish trying to guard this, and when they did close out hard to prevent Korver from shooting? He’d just pass it to Milsap or Horford who would immediately have a mismatch and no center guarding the paint.</p>

<p>Atlanta had elite spacing for the entire duration of the shotclock due to this dynamic, having a frontcourt of two skilled bigs and one of the deadliest and quickest shooters in history causing chaos offball. They didn’t repeat their success because teams just needed a season to learn and adapt. Wheels actually were starting to come off towards the second half of 2015.</p>

      <label for="lmfekyq" class="commentText"><p>I haven’t seen anyone mention it here yet, so I think it should be included that the Hawks lost Thabo for most of the next season following his injury from the police and Kyle Korver was recovering from surgery after Delly crashed into his ankles in the playoffs (Korver was also in the end stages of his career by then, turned 35 that year). Korver was a major piece of their successful offense and Thabo was one of their best defenders even tho he had a bench role. </p>

<p>end of day, its very rare for teams without a superstar to get very far in playoffs. when Lebron made Finals from 2011-2018, he faced a TOTAL of one 1st team All-NBA player in the East. his Finals appearances makes more sense considering how weak the competition was</p>

      <label for="lmetck9" class="commentText"><p>The Hawks implemented motion offence and stretched their bigs before other teams did. But the league was already trending in that direction because of the Warriors and caught up very quickly. By the next season, their offence had become the standard and they didn’t have the talent to keep up.</p>

<p>Coaching wise, teams prepared harder once they knew the level of the Hawks. We’ve see breakout teams usually fall back to earth the following season often from this if they don’t make significant changes. Budhenholzer teams in particular seem to stagnate in offence after their first season.</p>

<p>Billy King gave the Hawks “Swap Rights” with the Nets that Season via the  Joe Johnson Trade.</p>

<p>Hawks went from 29th to 15th because of that idiot Billy King.</p>

<p>Hawks Drafted then Traded away Kelly Oubre Jr to Wizards while the Nets took Chris McCullough.</p>

<p>Pretty sure every Swap during the various Billy King Trades came back to bite the Nets in the ass.</p>

<p>Worst part is Billy King was just throwing them into Trades for no reason and they wouldn’t be announced until months later to try and slip it under the radar of Nets fans.</p>

They can win a lot of regular season wins, but without someone that can put their head down when the game calls for, they just fall easily.</p>

      <label for="lmejqeu" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s pretty weird that you didn&rsquo;t mention that the best player on the 60 win team, was in Al Horford, who left.</p>

<p>How does a team that loses its best player, get substantially worse. That&rsquo;s literally what you asked.</p>

      <label for="lmei0m7" class="commentText"><p>They weren’t frauds but it isn’t super far off. They were a team made up of quality players but no top end talent to sustain that kind of play. As someone else said, they were kind of like a lightning in a bottle team. The team absolutely was cohesive and they were a quality team that year, but they weren’t on the same level of the true top tier squads that year</p>

<p>Lebron definitely came to town and he met a trash ass fake one seed.</p>
