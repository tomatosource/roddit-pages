      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fdaaii/how_come_the_hawks_after_2015_hawks_didnt_stay_on/"><p>How come the Hawks after 2015 Hawks didn’t stay on the same level after their 60 win season and their ECF appearance?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>In 2015, The Hawks went 60-22 and were the 1st seed in the East over the Cavs that had 3 All-Stars. They had 4 Players who became All-Stars (Although only because the East was weak and the team was good). They were 6th in both Offensive rtg and defensive rtg.</p>

<p>Unfortunately after that season, They never reached to that level again. They still had the almost same starting lineup but Bazemore was now the starting SF. But they regressed to 48-34 and had a bottom 10 offense although they had the 2nd best defense. They made it to the 2nd round but were swept by the Cavs.</p>

<p>The next season after that, There was some changes. Al was gone, Korver was traded, Teague was gone, but still had Millsap. They had a lineup of Schröder, Bazemore, Hardaway jr., Millsap and Dwight Howard. Their offense was worse and regressed to 43-39 but they still had the 4th best defense.</p>

<p>Unfortunately after that, The team fell apart. Their Top 3 Players from last season were gone and finished the 2018 season last in the East with a 24-58 record.</p>

<p>Did the Hawks had a fluke year in 2015? Did they lacked a superstar?</p>

      <label for="lmeagoe" class="commentText"><p>wouldn&rsquo;t say it was a fluke as much as teams didn&rsquo;t expect them to be so cohesive and well-run in <sup>14</sup>&frasl;<sub>15</sub>. they fell back to Earth after that with teams knowing what to expect</p>

<p>end of day, its very rare for teams without a superstar to get very far in playoffs. when Lebron made Finals from 2011-2018, he faced a TOTAL of one 1st team All-NBA player in the East. his Finals appearances makes more sense considering how weak the competition was</p>
