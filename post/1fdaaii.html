      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fdaaii/how_come_the_hawks_after_2015_hawks_didnt_stay_on/"><p>How come the Hawks after 2015 Hawks didn’t stay on the same level after their 60 win season and their ECF appearance?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>In 2015, The Hawks went 60-22 and were the 1st seed in the East over the Cavs that had 3 All-Stars. They had 4 Players who became All-Stars (Although only because the East was weak and the team was good). They were 6th in both Offensive rtg and defensive rtg.</p>

<p>Unfortunately after that season, They never reached to that level again. They still had the almost same starting lineup but Bazemore was now the starting SF. But they regressed to 48-34 and had a bottom 10 offense although they had the 2nd best defense. They made it to the 2nd round but were swept by the Cavs.</p>

<p>The next season after that, There was some changes. Al was gone, Korver was traded, Teague was gone, but still had Millsap. They had a lineup of Schröder, Bazemore, Hardaway jr., Millsap and Dwight Howard. Their offense was worse and regressed to 43-39 but they still had the 4th best defense.</p>

<p>Unfortunately after that, The team fell apart. Their Top 3 Players from last season were gone and finished the 2018 season last in the East with a 24-58 record.</p>

<p>Did the Hawks had a fluke year in 2015? Did they lacked a superstar?</p>

<p>Going from DMC to Bazemore in 2016 was a pretty big downgrade to both the starting lineup and the bench.</p>

<p>Sidenote - we inexplicably stopped running high PnPs for reasons that have never been explained. This was such a bread and butter play for us that someone needs to ask Budenholzer WTF happened.</p>

      <label for="lmhbt7n" class="commentText"><p>Yeah this question comes up a lot with one-year wonder teams and typically you&rsquo;re looking at it the wrong way. It takes a LOT of things going right in one season for a team to make a deep playoff run; i.e. staying healthy, bounces going your way in close games, opponents missing shots that could have won it, etc. When that happens, that season was the EXCEPTION, not the standard. By default, most years they would have just been average or above average.</p>

      <label for="lmet8ul" class="commentText"><p>How Bud utilized Korver caught a ton of teams with their pants down. Remember, centers back then were not just slower on average, but they still weren’t used to needing to switch onto perimeter players and hedge.</p>

<p>The way 3 point shooting still worked back then was that the role players helped space the court out for the star player when they’re initiating the offense. Hawks did an inverse version of this that was pretty novel in 2015 where Bud used Korver, his floor spacer, to actually initiate offense sometimes. The moment Teague brought the ball up they ran high offball screens with Korver and Milsap/Horford. Centers looked foolish trying to guard this, and when they did close out hard to prevent Korver from shooting? He’d just pass it to Milsap or Horford who would immediately have a mismatch and no center guarding the paint.</p>

<p>Atlanta had elite spacing for the entire duration of the shotclock due to this dynamic, having a frontcourt of two skilled bigs and one of the deadliest and quickest shooters in history causing chaos offball. They didn’t repeat their success because teams just needed a season to learn and adapt. Wheels actually were starting to come off towards the second half of 2015.</p>

Korver was a major piece of their successful offense and Thabo was one of their best defenders even tho he had a bench role. </p>

Although I&rsquo;d say it was less of an age related decline and more of a &ldquo;This role player is not shooting 49% from 3 on 6 attempts a game forever&rdquo; decline. He was absolutely on fire 2013-15, made 406 trays on 48.3%. That was never gonna be sustainable long term.</p>

He went from shootings 49% from 3 to 39% the next season (which picked back up to 45% the season after. But yeah, there is also the argument that it wasn’t an injury related drop off, and the league may have adjusted to him or some mix of both</p>

But the league was already trending in that direction because of the Warriors and caught up very quickly. By the next season, their offence had become the standard and they didn’t have the talent to keep up.</p>

<p>Coaching wise, teams prepared harder once they knew the level of the Hawks. We’ve see breakout teams usually fall back to earth the following season often from this if they don’t make significant changes. Budhenholzer teams in particular seem to stagnate in offence after their first season.</p>

<p>end of day, its very rare for teams without a superstar to get very far in playoffs. when Lebron made Finals from 2011-2018, he faced a TOTAL of one 1st team All-NBA player in the East. his Finals appearances makes more sense considering how weak the competition was</p>

<p>Hawks went from 29th to 15th because of that idiot Billy King.</p>

<p>Hawks Drafted then Traded away Kelly Oubre Jr to Wizards while the Nets took Chris McCullough.</p>

<p>Pretty sure every Swap during the various Billy King Trades came back to bite the Nets in the ass.</p>

<p>Worst part is Billy King was just throwing them into Trades for no reason and they wouldn’t be announced until months later to try and slip it under the radar of Nets fans.</p>

Teague was good but he could only do so much on speed alone and wasn&rsquo;t that great of a shooter and Al and Millsap couldn&rsquo;t dribble worth crap. Then we made the mistake of making Bud the GM who instead of trading people like Teague and Al when their value was at their peak, decided to just let them walk and say next man up with Schroeder and Dwight. Plus we bet the farm on mediocre wings like Bazemore becoming breakout stars during the time where &ldquo;3&amp;D&rdquo; wings were all the rage and bums like Allen Crabbe were getting paid 50 mil</p>
