<p>Comparing the 1st team all-nba members:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Jokic: 26/12/9 on 65 TS%, 4th in EPM, +23.7 on/off</p></li>

<li><p>Giannis: 30/11/6 on 65 TS%, 3rd in EPM +12.3 on/off</p></li>

<li><p>Luka: 34/9/10 on 62 TS%, 2nd in EPM, +11.9 on/off</p></li>

<li><p>SGA: <sup>30</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> on 63.6 TS%, 1st in EPM +10.1 on/off</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Tatum: 27/8/5 on 60 TS%, 15th in EPM, -2.0 on/off</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>The Celtics this season in the <strong>non-Tatum minutes had over a +12 net rating, that’s a 70 win pace.</strong> Just looking back at recent title and deep playoff teams you basically never see a team be that good with their best player off the floor. He undoubtedly has the best supporting cast in the league and it isn’t close</p>

      <label for="len5dp9" class="commentText"><p>You can use pbpstats.com and see with Tatum off the floor, the margin between -10 and 10, and a game leverage of medium, high, or very high, the Celtics had a +17 NetRtg in 666 minutes.</p>

<p>When the Celtics had a margin of over 10 and Tatum was off the floor with a low leverage the Celtics had a -3.7 NetRtg in 316 minutes. 216 of those minutes came with the Celtics up 20 points or more and their NetRtg was +1.6.</p>

<p>So it seems like the opposite of what you said. The Celtics destroyed teams in close games with Tatum off the floor but when they were already ahead big they weren’t effective with Tatum off the floor.</p>

<p>I think it’s intellectually obvious Tatum’s team is stacked as fuck. He’s by far the best player on the Celtics, easy to fit any players around, provides value everywhere with and without the ball, but the Celtics were an all time great teams because of his strengths as a player and the historically strong rotation of great players around him. It wasn’t because he was a historically high peaking MVP level player (or even necessarily close).</p>

<p>The Celtics weren’t blowing teams out with Tatum off the floor because the game was already over. Those situations downplay how effective they were with Tatum off the floor in competitive situations annihilating teams in close games. They were that good with Tatum off the floor because they were that good. As a Celtics fan, own it. You a fan of the team more or the player?</p>

<p>Having the best plus/minus in a small sample does not make him their best player during the playoffs.</p>

<p>Recent playoff plus/minus leaders:</p>

<li>2021: Holiday, +160</li>

<p>FWIW, here are Boston&rsquo;s starters by EPM in the playoffs this year:</p>

<ol>
<li>White, 4.4</li>
<li>Porzingis, 3.3</li>
<li>Brown, 2.2</li>

<p>This embiid quote is from the 2022 off-season so no, not really.</p>

<p>And secondly, it’s extremely relevant because it shows how good Tatum is compared to the rest of these guys.</p>

<p>Tatum had a bad on/off this season because they ran him a lot with bench lineups while leaving the starters in with Jaylen (because Jaylen cannot play with bench guys due to his vision). Obviously this would lead to bad +/- numbers as the Celtics starters were stacked.</p>

<p>2022 Tatum shows that given similar team compositions to the rest of these guys (a borderline All star and some role players), he outperforms all of them with the exception of jokic/giannis.</p>

<p>EDIT: i meant that as a compliment, i’m really not sure why there are so many boston fans trying to argue otherwise. your team went 64-18 in the regular season and then 16-3 in the playoffs. your starting center misses most of the playoffs and it just didn’t even matter. sorry your players don’t have more individual accolades but you’re a super team idk</p>

      <label for="lenawbj" class="commentText"><p>Because the rest of the league doesn’t deserve the bail out of saying “Boston is a super team.” When they gave brown a supermax last summer, it was laughed at. When they traded for Dwhite, no one cared. They bought low on KP when ANYONE could have had him. They got Jrue because another contender traded him away, thinking they were better off without him. Then, to top it all off, the mavericks were the trendy pick in the finals, and Boston wouldn’t have even gotten there if everyone in the East was healthy. It’s disingenuous to wait until after they run through everyone in their path to decide that all of a sudden there is no way someone could compete, because that was absolutely NOT the discourse around them all year long. Compared, for example, to the KD warriors or LeBron heat, where the championship felt like a forgone conclusion as soon as they signed their deals.</p>

<p>Side note, I find it tough in general to consider a team built through drafts/trades a super team anyway, because that is so organic anyway. It’s the big name free agent signings that I think make “super teams” because they are the ones more likely to ruin the competitive balance. The spurs, for instance, are one of the great dynasties in nba history, but I don’t consider them to be a “super team” the way the other teams I mentioned were</p>

      <label for="lencj8m" class="commentText"><p>Yea I think your point is the reasoning, it doesn’t feel like a super team in the sense that most of the other superteams of the past 20 years came together by slapping a bunch of allstars onto a roster. Like most superteams picked up one of their two best players in free agency or via trade</p>

<p>Imo it doesn’t really matter how the super team gets put together, if a teams that good they’re that good. You can debate how “pure” the team build was or whatever but imo a super team just describes a team where a bunch of guys would have a bigger workload or bigger responsibility on other rosters but have th luxury of being deeper options</p>

<p>Derrick White was decent on the spurs. It’s only when he played for the celtics that he became a great shooter.</p>

<p>And I dont think they bought low on KP. He&rsquo;s had a great season in wizards but wanted to go to boston. I dont even remember if other teams aside from the wizards wanted him last year lol</p>

      <label for="lenar82" class="commentText"><p>I think because the superteam is composed of role players that everyone else discounted. Derek White was good but wasn&rsquo;t the player he is now until he came to the Celtics. You guys all but ran porzingas out of town, and then he demolished you in Game 2.</p>

<p>Yes it&rsquo;s a superteam, and it&rsquo;s made of people no one ever considered super until they came here and did what they did.  And boy howdy is everyone extra salty about it. Sorry that it takes more than 1 good player and a washed supermax has-been to win a chip.</p>

<p>Mate KP was an all star with the Knicks and was hyped to be an MVP/DPOY level player. People called him the unicorn lol. Calling him someone that no one ever considered super is just absolutely wrong.</p>

<p>Jrue was an all star with the Bucks literally 1 season before the Celtics traded for him too, and was the 3rd best player on a championship team.</p>

And go figure, everyone knew the Celtics got a massive W landing him from the Wiz and he ended up barely playing in the playoffs. And when he did play, as expected, he was damn good.</p>

<p>Not saying the team isn&rsquo;t a super team, because it is, but I think it&rsquo;s a super team because of the chemistry, not the overall talent and that&rsquo;s the major argument Celtics fans are using. This season we had a &ldquo;suns&rdquo; superteam and that did jack squat. Tatum was a huge reason why the chemistry meshed well, and ill say the hot take, has a better play style that is conducive to winning as opposed to winning MVPs, cough cough Kevin Durant. Is Tatum MVP level? Not really, but he&rsquo;s a complete player that plays to the strengths of those around him instead of trying to carry the team himself.</p>

Nobody is saying the 2015 Hawks were a super team because they had 4 guys make All Star, but they would be under this definition. If LeBron can say he’s never played for a super team despite having multiple All NBA level guys, then borderline All Star aren’t a super team.</p>

      <label for="len9qsg" class="commentText"><p>The point is if embiid played that poorly 3/4ths of the game his team wouldn’t be winning. Tatum having a great 4th is impressive, but embiid’s team wouldn’t even have that opportunity if he played so poorly through 3 quarters (most superstars wouldn’t)</p>

<p>It’s arguably the rookie Scottie Barnes raptors</p>

<p>His entire career the sixers have beaten first round east fodder and then immediately lose in the 2nd round</p>

<p><strong>HE HAS NEVER BEAT A GOOD PLAYOFF TEAM IN HIS ENTIRE CAREER</strong></p>

<p>Obviously this ignores the fact that Tatum also usually contributes a TON in other areas in games where his shot is off, just feel like there are better games to pick on Embiid</p>

Which most of the time, in important games is extremely true.  There are outliers but Embiid is both the offense and the defense of the 76ers.</p>

<p>The closest the sixers were to a superteam was 2019.  How many games did he play with Butler?  Less than 60?  Probably played 80 with Harden.  Even Lebron didn&rsquo;t win right away in Miami.</p>

<p>For example are next years thunder team a superteam if J dub/ Chet becomes a 22 ish ppg scorer</p>

<p>Also can you be classed as a superteam if your squad underachieves ? - you’re still a talented group but just didn’t work well</p>

He was pretty instrumental in completely shutting down the Mavs lob threat for example. Was his shooting bad during the finals? Yes. But it’s kinda moot when he’s a major reason why the Mavs couldn’t crack 100 in 4 out of 5 final games.</p>

<p>I will never forget what he said on the Sixers/Celtics rivalry back like 5-6 years ago either.</p>
