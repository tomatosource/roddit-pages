      <label for="lo2nnh3" class="commentText"><p>Yeah look at the number of years he played at least 75 games in the regular season (12). Now compare it to Kareem&rsquo;s (16). It&rsquo;s almost that the bigger guy has more mileage compared to a guy that played all but one year where there was hand checking (where coincidentally he posted atrocious shooting splits and turnovers).</p>

<p>This impressive player has been playing 5 out the recent 6 years below 70 games a season. It must be so impressive this iron man has played only one full season.</p>

<p>All those 4 years his teams missed the season probably was taxing for his body because he plays at a time where teams constantly practice.</p>

<p>Oh wait not only he missed more games per season, he also was not even in the playoffs to sap whatever health he has. And he is also playing a time where the physicality is so down and the defensive meta will concede open shots and even the fast break because of the rules while the shotclock now resets to a mere 14 seconds encouraging the jacking of shots.</p>

<p>No shit, Lebron has better numbers, circumstances allowed him that.</p>

<p>Very convenient of you to put the one season he played 82, it’s like yall really didn’t watch him struggle and abandon Cleveland for rings by teaming up with an organization that already won+brought in another all-star who was a 1A of their respective team.</p>

<p>Lebron did absolutely not load manage on the cavs or heat. Hell, he played all 82 games in his last year with the cavs in 2018 so him doing it &ldquo;long before Kawhi&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t make any sense whatsoever.</p>

<p>LeBron in his 21st season averaged 25.7 - 7.3 - 8.3 - 60% eFG%. He even led the entire NBA in 4th quarter PPG. The next best 21st season was probably Vince Carter with 7.4 - 2.6 - 1.1 - 55% eFG%.</p>

<p>Kareem&rsquo;s 7&rsquo;2&rdquo; frame while playing chuck taylors and dunking on non-break away rims while he rides a bus where his teammates would smoke must have done wonders why he lasted for so long.

<p>If the good player is good in a way other players can’t be with any amount of effort, to an extent their performance improves to legendary levels, then it’s unfair. </p>

<p>LeBron’s build is also generationally unfair, but since it’s a physical attribute it arguably contributes to his longevity debate. Strength is tougher to maintain with age than pliability</p>

<p>Both are winners</p>

<p>That said Kareem had incredible longevity and was way ahead of his time this his training/dedication to his body.</p>

<p>Load management is the logical conclusion to guys playing ball year round from age 12 on. Modern players play so much more basketball than their predecessors. It’s frustrating as a fan at times, but 100% understandable to me</p>

      <label for="lo2kk6t" class="commentText"><p>But that is just unfair to Kareem because of different conditions at the time. Players didn&rsquo;t leave college early.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to make the argument that a freshman Kareem, who redshirted the year (because that&rsquo;s just what was done), was already the best player in college, would&rsquo;ve been an immediate number 1 pick, and was very likely ready to compete as one of the best players in the NBA.</p>

<p>That he basically wasn&rsquo;t allowed to join the league for 4 years isn&rsquo;t his fault. And looking at how well he looked after his body, particularly compared to his peers, gives no suggestion that he wouldn&rsquo;t have still had just as long an NBA career (with 4 more years of stats to show for it).</p>

<p>the modern basketball player is forced to put in more time earlier on than in prior eras. The modern player is forced to be dedicated to the game year round from basically adolescence. I’m sure Kareem could have handled it had he been born 40 years later. But he wasn’t.</p>

<p>An <sup>18</sup>&frasl;<sub>19</sub> year old player playing against nba competition for 82 games is more impressive to me than a 22 year old playing 30 games against college kids.</p>

<p>I’m sure if KAJ had been able to jump into the league at 19 he woulda been fine. But I’m not in the business of comparing what-ifs. That becomes a really slippery slope.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s compare them to their peers. I have posted a few times now the number of 40 yo&rsquo;s pre Kareem (only 2, neither of which even should count if you look at the actual situations), but there have been 27 since 1996, 14 since 2013, and currently 8 guys playing post 38yo.</p>

<p>It is actually absurd to think that players don&rsquo;t have more longevity nowadays. And the type of sports science and player welfare stuff that current players have access to is actually a universe away from what is was like in the past.</p>

<p>But, even if it shortens his career at the back end, its absurd to think that an extra 4 years in his prime doesn&rsquo;t significantly add to his career stats.</p>

<p>And my point is that, compared to his peers, Kareem&rsquo;s longevity was actually unheard of:</p>

<p>Before him there were only 2 players to play past 40. One played 2 games in the leagues 1st season, and one was Cousy who played 7 games as player-coach after years of retirement.</p>

<p>Since 1996 - there have been 27. Since 2013 - 14 guys have done it. And there&rsquo;s currently 4 39yo&rsquo;s and 4 38yo&rsquo;s in the league, so this numbers likely to grow again soon.</p>

      <label for="lo2xwv6" class="commentText"><p>Eh that’s not really how it works, sports science in general slows down the decline of peak which in turn makes athletes prime much longer. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that manny pacqiuao became the oldest welterweight champ at 40, Tom Brady winning a Super Bowl mvp at 43, Djokovic being the oldest player ever to win the French open and us open, ect.. sports are changing. Durant came back from a crazy injury and 20 years at his age that would have been it for him.</p>

<p>Also no player in NBA history, who has retired already, has ever been as entitled as LeBron is in terms of how their teams are built around him based off his suggestions, on top of drawing in young rising super stars to play next to him to keep his teams fresh. Brother, if every aging super star had that luxury, why would they retire at that point? Of course LeBron is going to keep going. MJ most likely retired because he knew there was 0 chance that Bulls team stayed together.</p>

<p>I am sure there is more but there is a scoring inflation in today&rsquo;s league. With good health someone will run up the stats to eventually overtake most existing records.</p>

<p>Hell if the NBA adopts netball&rsquo;s defensive rules, I can see teams go near 200 points a game. Should be hilarious how cumulative stats would go.</p>

<p>What are the records Lebron will be remembered for? Most points ever and the only player in the 40k-10k-10k club would be my guesses. How is Luka getting to 40k points while missing 15 games a year? Lebron was an outlier in terms of health for most of his career as well, and likely wouldn’t be where he’s at currently if he had to load manage throughout his early career</p>

<p>If the defense gets worse where teams are scoring 150 and Luka is averaging 40 or more, he will probably close the gap fast even if he gets injured 15 games a year. LOL..</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t ignore advances in sports medicine though. When Kareem played going until age 40 was basically unheard of, especially at a decently high level.</p>

<p>Nowadays playing at 40 is far from normal but it&rsquo;s become far more frequent. We&rsquo;ve seen revolutionary advances in longevity across all sports.</p>

<p>Would Kareem have had better numbers than LeBron if he had the same advantages of modern science? I don&rsquo;t know. I just know that it makes the comparison a difficult one and not so cut and dry in Lebron&rsquo;s favor</p>

<p>What we can say is:</p>

<p>Kareem was evolutionary in how he looked after his body. He absolutely demolished all previous records to the point that many thought they would be impossible to match again. And he did so after not being able to join to the league until 4 years of college. It is very easy to make the case that a freshman Kareem was already gonna be the number 1 pick, and was ready to dominate the NBA. If he&rsquo;s able to be drafted out of high school- does the extra games mean his body wears down a bit faster at the back end? Probably/possibly. But he also gets 4 extra years in his prime to add to those career stats.</p>

<p>Lebron&rsquo;s achievements are also impressive, and out of this world - and if he wants will continue for a few more years still to create more space in the record books. But compared to his peers, the gulf is just not as big.</p>

<p>Of the 31 guys to play after the age of 40 in NBA history, 14 have done since the 2010&rsquo;s, 20 since the year 2000 (and another 7 since 1996).</p>

<p>Before Kareem there had been 2. One of which played 2 games in the leagues first year. And one of which was Cousy who played 7 games as player-coach after years of retirement.</p>

<p>One guy is wearing converses and riding a bus with people smoking in it while most accomodation was motels and cheaper hotels. But I suppose his 7&rsquo;2 frame must feel great in the weak defensive era of the 80s where people push you and undercut you and it is only a common foul.</p>
