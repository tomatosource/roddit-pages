      <label for="lo2nnh3" class="commentText"><p>Yeah look at the number of years he played at least 75 games in the regular season (12). Now compare it to Kareem&rsquo;s (16). It&rsquo;s almost that the bigger guy has more mileage compared to a guy that played all but one year where there was hand checking (where coincidentally he posted atrocious shooting splits and turnovers).</p>

<p>This impressive player has been playing 5 out the recent 6 years below 70 games a season. It must be so impressive this iron man has played only one full season.</p>

<p>All those 4 years his teams missed the season probably was taxing for his body because he plays at a time where teams constantly practice.</p>

<p>Oh wait not only he missed more games per season, he also was not even in the playoffs to sap whatever health he has. And he is also playing a time where the physicality is so down and the defensive meta will concede open shots and even the fast break because of the rules while the shotclock now resets to a mere 14 seconds encouraging the jacking of shots.</p>

<p>No shit, Lebron has better numbers, circumstances allowed him that.</p>

      <label for="lo3wmwy" class="commentText"><p>I think a lot more was tolerated which allowed the game to flow and caused guys to take on more bumps while not having remotely similar access to recovery tools nor the pampered direct travel we see today. This shouldn’t be a hot take for anyone who’s watched basketball the last 25 years. The game has morphed to be a less physically defensive game overall and become much more tactical. It’s not as if anyone’s suggesting they could be bludgeoning one another back in the day. The bumps and bruises adding up while continuing to play is what forced guys to develop permanent injury. LeBron and Kareem are outliers any way you cut it, but to have people who don’t watch and clearly didn’t play dismissing Kareem and the old guys for reasons unknown is bizarre to me.</p>

      <label for="lo37ssn" class="commentText"><p>He was also a knucklehead that did not develop good passing discipline and would do jump passes while struggling to keep a dribble against active defenders until 2006. It took until 2009 that he actively use his off arm fencing the defender&rsquo;s so that he can clear space. It took until 2010 for him to pack on the pounds and made it a point to bulldoze smaller defenders.</p>

<p>The guy was raw but was super athletic but he has so many glaring flaws in his game that developed year by year but very slowly. He also has the passing competence of a junior high point guard in the half court where he could not do good entry passes to static post bigs (and he still continues to struggle to do so).</p>

<p>Eh, that was actually Kawhi. But the rest of your comment shows why you&rsquo;re writing something as misleading as that.</p>

<p>Edit: Oh wow, first time getting blocked on Reddit, over such an innocuous comment too.</p>

<p>/u/Unusual-Item3 are you a Kawhi fan that much that me saying he invented load management made you block me?</p>

<p>Lebron did absolutely not load manage on the cavs or heat. Hell, he played all 82 games in his last year with the cavs in 2018 so him doing it &ldquo;long before Kawhi&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t make any sense whatsoever.</p>

<p>Wade was the one that would take games off all the time so LeBron could carry it</p>

<p>the heat were 9-9 without LeBron (Heat record without Wade those years cause LeBron still played, 47-17)</p>

<p>the cavs were let me check 14-39 when LeBron didn&rsquo;t play</p>

<p>yup, he def had the luxury to play sit out games</p>

<p>even the Kyrie/Love only years 4-23 when LeBron didn&rsquo;t play</p>

<p>You don’t lose strength by the time you 40. It’s explosive actions , sprinting jumping etc that really suffer with age. Lebrons play style is much more difficult at 40 then Kareem at 7ft2 banging in the post. There’s more injuries in the modern game due to pace n space too</p>

<p>I fully disagree that a league that allows dudes to stand in the corner and take jumpers all game is more taxing than 80s showtime ball. I’m aware LeBron does more than take jumpers, but he’s not driving it to the hole every play. Be serious. Both styles are taxing  </p>

<p>That said Kareem had incredible longevity and was way ahead of his time this his training/dedication to his body.</p>

<p>Load management is the logical conclusion to guys playing ball year round from age 12 on. Modern players play so much more basketball than their predecessors. It’s frustrating as a fan at times, but 100% understandable to me</p>

      <label for="lo2kk6t" class="commentText"><p>But that is just unfair to Kareem because of different conditions at the time. Players didn&rsquo;t leave college early.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to make the argument that a freshman Kareem, who redshirted the year (because that&rsquo;s just what was done), was already the best player in college, would&rsquo;ve been an immediate number 1 pick, and was very likely ready to compete as one of the best players in the NBA.</p>

<p>That he basically wasn&rsquo;t allowed to join the league for 4 years isn&rsquo;t his fault. And looking at how well he looked after his body, particularly compared to his peers, gives no suggestion that he wouldn&rsquo;t have still had just as long an NBA career (with 4 more years of stats to show for it).</p>

      <label for="lo2mk7k" class="commentText"><p>I’m not saying whether it is fair or unfair. I’m just stating an objective fact</p>

<p>the modern basketball player is forced to put in more time earlier on than in prior eras. The modern player is forced to be dedicated to the game year round from basically adolescence. I’m sure Kareem could have handled it had he been born 40 years later. But he wasn’t.</p>

<p>An <sup>18</sup>&frasl;<sub>19</sub> year old player playing against nba competition for 82 games is more impressive to me than a 22 year old playing 30 games against college kids.</p>

<p>I’m sure if KAJ had been able to jump into the league at 19 he woulda been fine. But I’m not in the business of comparing what-ifs. That becomes a really slippery slope.</p>

      <label for="lo2qycq" class="commentText"><p>But then let&rsquo;s not compare &ldquo;what ifs&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s compare them to their peers. I have posted a few times now the number of 40 yo&rsquo;s pre Kareem (only 2, neither of which even should count if you look at the actual situations), but there have been 27 since 1996, 14 since 2013, and currently 8 guys playing post 38yo.</p>

<p>It is actually absurd to think that players don&rsquo;t have more longevity nowadays. And the type of sports science and player welfare stuff that current players have access to is actually a universe away from what is was like in the past.</p>

      <label for="lo2q18u" class="commentText"><p>Of course there are what ifs.</p>

<p>But, even if it shortens his career at the back end, its absurd to think that an extra 4 years in his prime doesn&rsquo;t significantly add to his career stats.</p>

<p>And my point is that, compared to his peers, Kareem&rsquo;s longevity was actually unheard of:</p>

<p>Before him there were only 2 players to play past 40. One played 2 games in the leagues 1st season, and one was Cousy who played 7 games as player-coach after years of retirement.</p>

<p>Since 1996 - there have been 27. Since 2013 - 14 guys have done it. And there&rsquo;s currently 4 39yo&rsquo;s and 4 38yo&rsquo;s in the league, so this numbers likely to grow again soon.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t ignore advances in sports medicine though. When Kareem played going until age 40 was basically unheard of, especially at a decently high level.</p>

<p>Nowadays playing at 40 is far from normal but it&rsquo;s become far more frequent. We&rsquo;ve seen revolutionary advances in longevity across all sports.</p>

<p>Would Kareem have had better numbers than LeBron if he had the same advantages of modern science? I don&rsquo;t know. I just know that it makes the comparison a difficult one and not so cut and dry in Lebron&rsquo;s favor</p>

      <label for="lo32znm" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s impressive but &ldquo;just as impressive&rdquo; might be overselling it. First, disingenuous to say Kareem played 4 extra years because of college when it takes 3 full seasons of college to get to the mileage of an NBA season+playoffs. Lebron will also pass Kareem in RS GP and minutes this season, and is already 50 games up and 4000 minutes ahead in playoff GP and minutes. Career games is only Kareem by 18 games. And then the obvious factor worth mentioning is that Kareem was not a top player in his final 3 seasons by the time he turned 39. If last year and the Olympics is any indication, Lebron is probably still a top 10 guy in the league and has more gas in the tank.  Kareem was a top 10-15 guy for 17 years which is bonkers - Lebron has been that for 21 years and counting.</p>

<p>Also no player in NBA history, who has retired already, has ever been as entitled as LeBron is in terms of how their teams are built around him based off his suggestions, on top of drawing in young rising super stars to play next to him to keep his teams fresh. Brother, if every aging super star had that luxury, why would they retire at that point? Of course LeBron is going to keep going. MJ most likely retired because he knew there was 0 chance that Bulls team stayed together.</p>

<p>I am sure there is more but there is a scoring inflation in today&rsquo;s league. With good health someone will run up the stats to eventually overtake most existing records.</p>

<p>Hell if the NBA adopts netball&rsquo;s defensive rules, I can see teams go near 200 points a game. Should be hilarious how cumulative stats would go.</p>

<p>What are the records Lebron will be remembered for? Most points ever and the only player in the 40k-10k-10k club would be my guesses. How is Luka getting to 40k points while missing 15 games a year? Lebron was an outlier in terms of health for most of his career as well, and likely wouldn’t be where he’s at currently if he had to load manage throughout his early career</p>

<p>If the defense gets worse where teams are scoring 150 and Luka is averaging 40 or more, he will probably close the gap fast even if he gets injured 15 games a year. LOL..</p>

<p>What we can say is:</p>

<p>Kareem was evolutionary in how he looked after his body. He absolutely demolished all previous records to the point that many thought they would be impossible to match again. And he did so after not being able to join to the league until 4 years of college. It is very easy to make the case that a freshman Kareem was already gonna be the number 1 pick, and was ready to dominate the NBA. If he&rsquo;s able to be drafted out of high school- does the extra games mean his body wears down a bit faster at the back end? Probably/possibly. But he also gets 4 extra years in his prime to add to those career stats.</p>

<p>Lebron&rsquo;s achievements are also impressive, and out of this world - and if he wants will continue for a few more years still to create more space in the record books. But compared to his peers, the gulf is just not as big.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_and_youngest_NBA_players" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_and_youngest_NBA_players</a></p>

<p>Of the 31 guys to play after the age of 40 in NBA history, 14 have done since the 2010&rsquo;s, 20 since the year 2000 (and another 7 since 1996).</p>

<p>Before Kareem there had been 2. One of which played 2 games in the leagues first year. And one of which was Cousy who played 7 games as player-coach after years of retirement.</p>

<p>One guy is wearing converses and riding a bus with people smoking in it while most accomodation was motels and cheaper hotels. But I suppose his 7&rsquo;2 frame must feel great in the weak defensive era of the 80s where people push you and undercut you and it is only a common foul.</p>

Kareem&rsquo;s longevity and dominance without today’s advanced sports science, nutrition, and supplements really makes his achievements even more remarkable. Nowadays, supplements like Normotim are a popular addition for mental health, but back then, athletes like Kareem relied more on raw talent and grit</p>

It&rsquo;s neat LeBron passed Kareem but Kareems Is more impressive. Again we are comparing two impressive things here.

Further, this generation wants to be able to say they saw “The GOAT”, or they loss to the GOAT (which betters their place in history). Kareem was probably, still, the greatest player to touch the ball…Being a center also works against you. Wilt, for example, had crazy numbers. Things that have stood for over 40-50 years. Crickets around his accomplishments.</p>
