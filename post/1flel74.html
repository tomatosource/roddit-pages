      <label for="lo2nnh3" class="commentText"><p>Yeah look at the number of years he played at least 75 games in the regular season (12). Now compare it to Kareem&rsquo;s (16). It&rsquo;s almost that the bigger guy has more mileage compared to a guy that played all but one year where there was hand checking (where coincidentally he posted atrocious shooting splits and turnovers).</p>

<p>This impressive player has been playing 5 out the recent 6 years below 70 games a season. It must be so impressive this iron man has played only one full season.</p>

<p>All those 4 years his teams missed the season probably was taxing for his body because he plays at a time where teams constantly practice.</p>

<p>Oh wait not only he missed more games per season, he also was not even in the playoffs to sap whatever health he has. And he is also playing a time where the physicality is so down and the defensive meta will concede open shots and even the fast break because of the rules while the shotclock now resets to a mere 14 seconds encouraging the jacking of shots.</p>

<p>No shit, Lebron has better numbers, circumstances allowed him that.</p>

      <label for="lo2lc29" class="commentText"><p>He definitely stopped playing as much, Lebron pretty much invented load management.</p>

<p>His teams were constructed where they had two guys who could take over at any time, he didn‚Äôt need to force himself through injuries, or be the one to take the last shot every important game, etc.</p>

<p>That luxury definitely played a part in his longevity. Lebron couldn‚Äôt win a 3peat or make his mark on a single game the way past GOATs did, so he went for longevity.</p>

<p>I just don‚Äôt view basketball over a career as much, although durability and longevity is something I admire, I believe your ability to takeover a single game is what‚Äôs more important.</p>

<p>Lebron fanboys will downvote for talking down their ‚Äúself-proclaimed King‚Äù üòÇ</p>

<p>LeBron in his 21st season averaged 25.7 - 7.3 - 8.3 - 60% eFG%. He even led the entire NBA in 4th quarter PPG. The next best 21st season was probably Vince Carter with 7.4 - 2.6 - 1.1 - 55% eFG%.</p>

<p>Kareem&rsquo;s 7&rsquo;2&rdquo; frame while playing chuck taylors and dunking on non-break away rims while he rides a bus where his teammates would smoke must have done wonders why he lasted for so long. Him missing the playoffs 2 of 20 years while playing over 75 games for 16 years must feel like heaven.</p>

      <label for="lo2kk6t" class="commentText"><p>But that is just unfair to Kareem because of different conditions at the time. Players didn&rsquo;t leave college early.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to make the argument that a freshman Kareem, who redshirted the year (because that&rsquo;s just what was done), was already the best player in college, would&rsquo;ve been an immediate number 1 pick, and was very likely ready to compete as one of the best players in the NBA.</p>

<p>That he basically wasn&rsquo;t allowed to join the league for 4 years isn&rsquo;t his fault. And looking at how well he looked after his body, particularly compared to his peers, gives no suggestion that he wouldn&rsquo;t have still had just as long an NBA career (with 4 more years of stats to show for it).</p>

      <label for="lo2mk7k" class="commentText"><p>I‚Äôm not saying whether it is fair or unfair. I‚Äôm just stating an objective fact</p>

<p>the modern basketball player is forced to put in more time earlier on than in prior eras. The modern player is forced to be dedicated to the game year round from basically adolescence. I‚Äôm sure Kareem could have handled it had he been born 40 years later. But he wasn‚Äôt.</p>

<p>An <sup>18</sup>&frasl;<sub>19</sub> year old player playing against nba competition for 82 games is more impressive to me than a 22 year old playing 30 games against college kids.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm sure if KAJ had been able to jump into the league at 19 he woulda been fine. But I‚Äôm not in the business of comparing what-ifs. That becomes a really slippery slope.</p>

      <label for="lo2hiv9" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s only an outlier because others who have retired by now have never won and their career looked as if they would never have won if they continued.</p>

<p>Also no player in NBA history, who has retired already, has ever been as entitled as LeBron is in terms of how their teams are built around him based off his suggestions, on top of drawing in young rising super stars to play next to him to keep his teams fresh. Brother, if every aging super star had that luxury, why would they retire at that point? Of course LeBron is going to keep going. MJ most likely retired because he knew there was 0 chance that Bulls team stayed together.</p>

      <label for="lo2olt6" class="commentText"><p>The same way that people try to criticise Russell and Wilt for &ldquo;playing against milkman&rdquo;, without acknowledging how shit the conditions actually were at the time for them - mostly in terms of player welfare (I mean - catching coaches every where, staying in motels, zero sports science, let alone the actual horrendous racism from all sides) - it&rsquo;s just too hard to compare era&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>What we can say is:</p>

<p>Kareem was evolutionary in how he looked after his body. He absolutely demolished all previous records to the point that many thought they would be impossible to match again. And he did so after not being able to join to the league until 4 years of college. It is very easy to make the case that a freshman Kareem was already gonna be the number 1 pick, and was ready to dominate the NBA. If he&rsquo;s able to be drafted out of high school- does the extra games mean his body wears down a bit faster at the back end? Probably/possibly. But he also gets 4 extra years in his prime to add to those career stats.</p>

<p>Lebron&rsquo;s achievements are also impressive, and out of this world - and if he wants will continue for a few more years still to create more space in the record books. But compared to his peers, the gulf is just not as big.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_and_youngest_NBA_players" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_and_youngest_NBA_players</a></p>

<p>Of the 31 guys to play after the age of 40 in NBA history, 14 have done since the 2010&rsquo;s, 20 since the year 2000 (and another 7 since 1996).</p>

<p>Before Kareem there had been 2. One of which played 2 games in the leagues first year. And one of which was Cousy who played 7 games as player-coach after years of retirement.</p>
