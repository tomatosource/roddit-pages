<p>LeBron in his 21st season averaged 25.7 - 7.3 - 8.3 - 60% eFG%. He even led the entire NBA in 4th quarter PPG. The next best 21st season was probably Vince Carter with 7.4 - 2.6 - 1.1 - 55% eFG%.</p>

He was an extreme outlier that ate clean, practiced yoga and martial arts, and took extremely good care of his body when players around him were doing coke and chugging beer in the locker room. That&rsquo;s not to discredit Lebron&rsquo;s accomplishment, we&rsquo;re splitting hairs here because Lebron is playing better than the majority of the league at his age. They are both 1 of 1 in their own way, but I respect Kareem&rsquo;s journey a little more.</p>

<p>You don’t lose strength by the time you 40. It’s explosive actions , sprinting jumping etc that really suffer with age. Lebrons play style is much more difficult at 40 then Kareem at 7ft2 banging in the post. There’s more injuries in the modern game due to pace n space too</p>

<p>I fully disagree that a league that allows dudes to stand in the corner and take jumpers all game is more taxing than 80s showtime ball. I’m aware LeBron does more than take jumpers, but he’s not driving it to the hole every play. Be serious. Both styles are taxing  </p>

      <label for="lo4n4qn" class="commentText"><p>Pace mb higher but it was slowing down no by the end of Kareem era? Also bear in mind I said pace ABD SPace. Without using as much of the court n sprinting to close out dtc the game was less taxing . Average age is 3 years lower then in the year 2000 even for example. Every. Star but jokic who plays a floorbound game n isn’t expected to close out to perimeter hard gets injured constantly while it was more common to play all 82 back then</p>

<p>I’m not saying this to diminish Kareem , to me he is a player that often doesn’t get enough love but as ahead as he was in explaining why I view lebrons longevity more impressive- tho it is more about ability then what I’m saying here. I think you can make arguments that sports science vs harder more taxing era is balancing out .</p>

<p>Dude please go watch the 80s n 90s ball . It’s way more stagnant n way less movement . Even pure spot up guys don’t exist now they need extra dimension n Lebron isn’t hiding in the corner all game anyway . But it’s also not true hence needing younger players</p>

      <label for="lo54a4w" class="commentText"><p>Stop looking at stats and making broad statements based purely on those, especially just raw stats. We&rsquo;ve seen too many times how players can pad individual stats to the detriment of their team&rsquo;s success. You say LeBron &lsquo;clearly&rsquo; had a better age 38 season when Bron was just 3rd Team All NBA while Kareem made 1st Team All NBA while being the reigning Finals MVP. Almost every damn player would take Kareem&rsquo;s season over LeBron&rsquo;s. And besides, even if you want to stubbornly stick to your stats argument, the advanced stats paint a much more even contest between the two (especially taking into consideration LeBron&rsquo;s much higher useage) with Kareem having clearly better win shares (nearly double that of LeBron), VORP &amp; TS% with LeBron having marginally better BPM &amp; PER. But if you want to break it down further then Kareem also had better DBPM, OWS, DWS &amp; WS/48 while LeBron had better OBPM.<br>
Not such a clear cut argument now, is it?</p>

<p>Lebron did absolutely not load manage on the cavs or heat. Hell, he played all 82 games in his last year with the cavs in 2018 so him doing it &ldquo;long before Kawhi&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t make any sense whatsoever.</p>

Well, the first player is Kareem.<br>
Btw, before you head over to BBREF to check those stats (which you should absolutely do btw) you need to understand that they use an arbitrary birthday cutoff to determine age xx seasons. Many times this is wrong and Kareem is one of those times. His proper age 38 season was <sup>84</sup>&frasl;<sub>85</sub> according to the official NBA website.</p>

<p>That said Kareem had incredible longevity and was way ahead of his time this his training/dedication to his body.</p>

<p>Load management is the logical conclusion to guys playing ball year round from age 12 on. Modern players play so much more basketball than their predecessors. It’s frustrating as a fan at times, but 100% understandable to me</p>

      <label for="lo2kk6t" class="commentText"><p>But that is just unfair to Kareem because of different conditions at the time. Players didn&rsquo;t leave college early.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to make the argument that a freshman Kareem, who redshirted the year (because that&rsquo;s just what was done), was already the best player in college, would&rsquo;ve been an immediate number 1 pick, and was very likely ready to compete as one of the best players in the NBA.</p>

<p>That he basically wasn&rsquo;t allowed to join the league for 4 years isn&rsquo;t his fault. And looking at how well he looked after his body, particularly compared to his peers, gives no suggestion that he wouldn&rsquo;t have still had just as long an NBA career (with 4 more years of stats to show for it).</p>

<p>the modern basketball player is forced to put in more time earlier on than in prior eras. The modern player is forced to be dedicated to the game year round from basically adolescence. I’m sure Kareem could have handled it had he been born 40 years later. But he wasn’t.</p>

<p>An <sup>18</sup>&frasl;<sub>19</sub> year old player playing against nba competition for 82 games is more impressive to me than a 22 year old playing 30 games against college kids.</p>

<p>I’m sure if KAJ had been able to jump into the league at 19 he woulda been fine. But I’m not in the business of comparing what-ifs. That becomes a really slippery slope.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s compare them to their peers. I have posted a few times now the number of 40 yo&rsquo;s pre Kareem (only 2, neither of which even should count if you look at the actual situations), but there have been 27 since 1996, 14 since 2013, and currently 8 guys playing post 38yo.</p>

<p>It is actually absurd to think that players don&rsquo;t have more longevity nowadays. And the type of sports science and player welfare stuff that current players have access to is actually a universe away from what is was like in the past.</p>

<p>But, even if it shortens his career at the back end, its absurd to think that an extra 4 years in his prime doesn&rsquo;t significantly add to his career stats.</p>

<p>And my point is that, compared to his peers, Kareem&rsquo;s longevity was actually unheard of:</p>

<p>Before him there were only 2 players to play past 40. One played 2 games in the leagues 1st season, and one was Cousy who played 7 games as player-coach after years of retirement.</p>

<p>Since 1996 - there have been 27. Since 2013 - 14 guys have done it. And there&rsquo;s currently 4 39yo&rsquo;s and 4 38yo&rsquo;s in the league, so this numbers likely to grow again soon.</p>

      <label for="lo5bdwl" class="commentText"><p>Are you completely ignoring accomplishments? Because not a single professional sporting league on the planet would exist without the concept of winning, whether it be championships, MVPs or whatever. That is by far the single most important aspect of sport. It&rsquo;s certainly not the accumulation of stats.<br>
Age 34 and onwards:<br>
Kareem - 4 x NBA Champion, 1 x Finals MVP, 3 x 1st Team All NBA, 1 x 1st Team All Defense, 1.117 total MVP shares<br>
LeBron - 1 x NBA Champion, 1 x Finals MVP, 1 x 1st Team All NBA, 0.749 total MVP shares<br>
Now, if you ask the entire NBA which they would take&hellip;.LeBron&rsquo;s raw stat line and accomplishments or Kareem&rsquo;s raw stat line and accomplishments and I doubt you would get a single person voting for LeBron. Scratch that, you would get <em>one</em> player voting for LeBron and that would be LeBron.<br>
But also, those raw stats can be misleading. Looking at advanced metrics and it becomes much closer with Lebron leading in BPM, OBPM, DBPM &amp; PER but Kareem leading in VORP, WS, OWS, DWS, WS/48 &amp; TS%.</p>

      <label for="lo5eono" class="commentText"><p>What are you even yapping about. 34 and onwards Kareem is behind on VORP and obviously BPM. This is also a classic case of stop pretending you know advanced stats because WS and PER are both terrible box score aggregates compared to BPM. TS is just all in one efficiency and at that point you should also include slashlines. Lebron had a VORP (which is just cumulative BPM) of 5.4 for his last season. The last time Kareem matched or exceeded that mark was a 6.1 when he was 33 with his highest being 4.9 after 33 so I have no idea where you&rsquo;re pulling these numbers from. Kareem 34 to 38 has a BPM of 4.9 while Lebron 34 to present is at 7.4, that&rsquo;s a huge gap.</p>

      <label for="lo2wf3u" class="commentText"><p>In a vacuum yes. If you compare their careers head to head LeBron has far better old man numbers and played more total NBA minutes plus he&rsquo;s not done</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t ignore advances in sports medicine though. When Kareem played going until age 40 was basically unheard of, especially at a decently high level.</p>

<p>Nowadays playing at 40 is far from normal but it&rsquo;s become far more frequent. We&rsquo;ve seen revolutionary advances in longevity across all sports.</p>

<p>Would Kareem have had better numbers than LeBron if he had the same advantages of modern science? I don&rsquo;t know. I just know that it makes the comparison a difficult one and not so cut and dry in Lebron&rsquo;s favor</p>

      <label for="lo32znm" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s impressive but &ldquo;just as impressive&rdquo; might be overselling it. First, disingenuous to say Kareem played 4 extra years because of college when it takes 3 full seasons of college to get to the mileage of an NBA season+playoffs. Lebron will also pass Kareem in RS GP and minutes this season, and is already 50 games up and 4000 minutes ahead in playoff GP and minutes. Career games is only Kareem by 18 games. And then the obvious factor worth mentioning is that Kareem was not a top player in his final 3 seasons by the time he turned 39. If last year and the Olympics is any indication, Lebron is probably still a top 10 guy in the league and has more gas in the tank.  Kareem was a top 10-15 guy for 17 years which is bonkers - Lebron has been that for 21 years and counting.</p>

The NBA had Kareem, Bob McAdoo and Pistol Pete while the ABA had Dr. J, Artis Gilmore and Iceman Gervin. Most of Kareem&rsquo;s prime was during the weakest era in NBA history by a mile, on top of that, the period in which he won the most, he wasn&rsquo;t even the best player on his own team, that&rsquo;s why he is overlooked.</p>

<p>Kareem is legit the only all-time great that 30 years after his retirement somehow got better in people&rsquo;s eyes than he was when he was active, it&rsquo;s kinda wild.</p>

<p>LeBron’s longevity is clearly more impressive though. LeBron’s been a drastically better player in his late-30s than Kareem was. When Kareem was 39 he was averaging 17.5ppg. Bron just put up a casual 25/7/8, upped it to 28/7/9/1/2.4 on 64%TS in the playoffs, and then proceeded to <em>still</em> look like the best player on the planet in the Olympics whether you believe he actually is or not</p>

<p>LeBron’s also played 7230 more NBA minutes by the same age between the regular season and playoffs. Even if you add in Kareem’s college minutes they wouldn’t come close to closing that gap. If we want to go further, hell we could include the fact that LeBron has spent 6 of his summers playing either the Olympics or FIBA ball for Team USA, and Kareem never did</p>

<p>One guy is wearing converses and riding a bus with people smoking in it while most accomodation was motels and cheaper hotels. But I suppose his 7&rsquo;2 frame must feel great in the weak defensive era of the 80s where people push you and undercut you and it is only a common foul.</p>

      <label for="lo2olt6" class="commentText"><p>The same way that people try to criticise Russell and Wilt for &ldquo;playing against milkman&rdquo;, without acknowledging how shit the conditions actually were at the time for them - mostly in terms of player welfare (I mean - catching coaches every where, staying in motels, zero sports science, let alone the actual horrendous racism from all sides) - it&rsquo;s just too hard to compare era&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>What we can say is:</p>

<p>Kareem was evolutionary in how he looked after his body. He absolutely demolished all previous records to the point that many thought they would be impossible to match again. And he did so after not being able to join to the league until 4 years of college. It is very easy to make the case that a freshman Kareem was already gonna be the number 1 pick, and was ready to dominate the NBA. If he&rsquo;s able to be drafted out of high school- does the extra games mean his body wears down a bit faster at the back end? Probably/possibly. But he also gets 4 extra years in his prime to add to those career stats.</p>

<p>Lebron&rsquo;s achievements are also impressive, and out of this world - and if he wants will continue for a few more years still to create more space in the record books. But compared to his peers, the gulf is just not as big.</p>

<p>Of the 31 guys to play after the age of 40 in NBA history, 14 have done since the 2010&rsquo;s, 20 since the year 2000 (and another 7 since 1996).</p>

<p>Before Kareem there had been 2. One of which played 2 games in the leagues first year. And one of which was Cousy who played 7 games as player-coach after years of retirement.</p>

      <label for="lo522zv" class="commentText"><p>Well, I&rsquo;m not sure what is so special about LeBron&rsquo;s longevity, aside from him wracking up points, assists &amp; rebounds.<br>
He hasn&rsquo;t won an MVP since he was 28yo.<br>
He hasn&rsquo;t made an All Defense team since he was 29yo.<br>
If you compare major accolades LeBron &amp; MJ won in their 30s (note: bbref uses a weird arbitrary date cutoff for player ages, so it has 93 as an age 29 season for MJ. This is wrong. MJ
turned 30 that season and, rightfully, the official league site NBA.com lists it as his age 30 season, so we need to include that) we see that:</p>

<p>MJ won - 4 x rings, 4 x Finals MVPs, 2 x MVPs, 4 x 1st Team All NBA, 4 x 1st Team All Defense, 4 x scoring titles (22 total)<br>
LeBron - 1 x ring, 1 x Finals MVP, 5 x 1st Team All NBA, 1 x Assists title (8 total)</p>

<p>So I ask the question again, what is so special about his longevity? By far, and it&rsquo;s not really close, the main aim of any professional sport is to <em>win</em> stuff, not to pad career stats.</p>

<p>You had the age wrong.  Kareem was born on 4/16/1947.  So in the 1986-1987 season, he would only be 40 at the end of the season.  So he was 39 for vast majority of it.  Basketball Reference listed him as 39 for that season, which I agree with.  He wasn&rsquo;t putting up those stats at age 40.  He put up those stats at age 39.</p>

Durant came back from a crazy injury and 20 years at his age that would have been it for him.</p>

<p>Go back to the early 2000s and see who were considered the GOATs of those sports, they all weren&rsquo;t from the same time period. Joe Montana was from the 80s, Sampras and Jordan were both from the 90s and most would say that the greatest welterweights ever were from the 40s.</p>

<p>The fact that we are having a bunch of GOAT candidates at the same time period across sports should tell everyone that this is not by chance. Tennis is the biggest offender in this, i truly believe Federer, Nadal and Djokovic are the three greatest players ever, but anyone that thinks sports science and technology aren&rsquo;t a GIGANTIC reason for that is crazy, the likelihood of the three greatest players ever in a sport playing at the same time is astronomically low.</p>

<p>Also no player in NBA history, who has retired already, has ever been as entitled as LeBron is in terms of how their teams are built around him based off his suggestions, on top of drawing in young rising super stars to play next to him to keep his teams fresh. Brother, if every aging super star had that luxury, why would they retire at that point? Of course LeBron is going to keep going. MJ most likely retired because he knew there was 0 chance that Bulls team stayed together.</p>

<p>I am sure there is more but there is a scoring inflation in today&rsquo;s league. With good health someone will run up the stats to eventually overtake most existing records.</p>

<p>Hell if the NBA adopts netball&rsquo;s defensive rules, I can see teams go near 200 points a game. Should be hilarious how cumulative stats would go.</p>

<p>What are the records Lebron will be remembered for? Most points ever and the only player in the 40k-10k-10k club would be my guesses. How is Luka getting to 40k points while missing 15 games a year? Lebron was an outlier in terms of health for most of his career as well, and likely wouldn’t be where he’s at currently if he had to load manage throughout his early career</p>

<p>If the defense gets worse where teams are scoring 150 and Luka is averaging 40 or more, he will probably close the gap fast even if he gets injured 15 games a year. LOL..</p>

And then they just added James Worthy when Kareem was 35. He got to ride shotgun while Magic had one of the best primes ever for an NBA player, LeBron has never had a supporting cast anything close to late career Kareem.</p>
