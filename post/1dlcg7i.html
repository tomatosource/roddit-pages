      <label for="l9ntd63" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I&rsquo;ve watched games and the commentators mention some semi-scrub rando with a few assists and&hellip; I&rsquo;m pretty sure all I saw was that guy dribble and pass casually to some guy WAY off the 3 point line and later something occurred like some wild drive / circus shot.  That guy passing wasn&rsquo;t making shit happen / had nothing to do with that score occurring.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a little frustrating because sometimes those guys reputation gets propped up based on those BS assists and no man &hellip; dude did jack shit out there offensively.</p>

<p>Meanwhile guys how really might make good choices / passes often that result in points are kinda lost in the mix.</p>

      <label for="l9ox6pt" class="commentText"><p>This is why assists have gone up and guys like jokic receive bs triple doubles. All of the offense revolves around him, he gets the ball and passes or shoots. They give an assist every pass that turns into a score weather the pass was just then or 20 seconds ago. The old point guards have got to be pissed about this. It makes everything they did look different because they now count them differently.</p>

My take might be old school and extreme but it is what it is.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the definition of an assist is found in this very post</p>

<p>The problem isn’t that we don’t know what constitutes as an assist, the problem is things that shouldn’t be an assist are counted as one, hence the context of this post</p>

<p>No, consistency. The assists linked in the article aren&rsquo;t one-offs, they are consistently counted as assists in the NBA. The NBA has never defined the window for an assist so as long as the lapse of time isn&rsquo;t egregious, they&rsquo;re counted.</p>

<p>I said they never defined the time window for an assist, not an assist itself. <a href="https://videorulebook.nba.com/rule/assist/" target="_blank">Here</a></p>

<p><em>An assist is credited to the player tossing the last pass leading directly to a made field goal, but only if the player scoring the goal demonstrates an immediate reaction toward the basket after receiving the pass.</em></p>

<p>The issue at hand is the time window from pass to bucket, or how much work the scoring player did, but they still fit the definition of as assist.</p>

<p>No&hellip;.</p>

<p>If not, which it sounds like there is not, there is absolutely no way one can just &ldquo;watch games&rdquo; and make a general claim that assist stats are all consistent.</p>

<p>Yes I can lol</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re following at all. Again, the issue is simply the time window. So, looking at the examples in the link, I don&rsquo;t see any assists where the scorer did anything abnormal. They looked like normal enough assists to anyone who watches games. The fact that you&rsquo;re arguing someone can&rsquo;t get a grasp of what&rsquo;s considered an assist suggests you don&rsquo;t watch at all.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think you know what objective means. If not every last pass is an assist there is some threshold. Whether it be time, dribbles, effort or something else. If that is not outlined but clearly exists subjectively&hellip;.there is no objective definition.</p>

<p>Irony.  To make this claim you need to define what is abnormal and then have some evidence for how consistent &ldquo;that&rdquo; same thing is considered abnormal.</p>

<p>Ie, 90% pf the time scoring off 3 dribbles within 3 seconds with less than 1 second of hesitation is considered an assist. Otherwise you simply can&rsquo;t claim consistency if you can&rsquo;t even define what is consistent lol.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t rocket science.</p>

This was pretty conclusive on video back before the NBA got really active about taking down fans&rsquo; ability to watch old games. Someone on RealGM in 2011 charted every possession of the game, coming to 9 assists for Frazier which included &ldquo;some doubtful ones&rdquo;.</p>

Just because you passed it to a guy standing 30 feet from the basket and they did all the work doesn&rsquo;t mean your pass directly led to a basket.</p>

<p>To give you an idea of how dumb of a stat the assist is, the NBA video rulebook has an entire page dedicated to what is and isn&rsquo;t an assist, and if a shooter catches a pass, goes into his shot off the catch, has defenders around him, and makes a contested shot, that&rsquo;s still counted as an assist.  Meanwhile, if the shooter pauses after the catch, defenders aren&rsquo;t near him, and he takes and makes the shot, it&rsquo;s not an assist.  The passer contributed more to the made shot in the second example by passing to an open shooter but, for some reason, that doesn&rsquo;t matter.  How dumb is that?</p>
