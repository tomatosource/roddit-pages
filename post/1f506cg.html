      <label for="lkp8pct" class="commentText"><p>Shaq is interesting in that despite everything he’s accomplished and had in life, he’s still a little insecure. When things don’t go his way, it helps his ego a little bit to say it was something else other than the other guy being a little bit better in that moment. Wilt is a similar way. Charles Barkley doesn’t have the same legacy as a player because he didn’t win rings, but he has none of the same hangups</p>

      <label for="lkpg0pq" class="commentText"><p>Shaq is insecure in odd ways. He just doesn’t like a select group of players, generally bigs, but he also basically worships contemporaries like Hakeem and generally has a lot of love even for Jokic, so it isn’t really generational.</p>

<p>Shaq’s not quite that easy to pin down. I saw a video where he voiced support for Steph Curry as a potential GOAT and when asked if he’d rank Steph above himself, he said easily. And you could tell he meant it.</p>

<p>So I’m not ready to paint him with just one brush.</p>

<p>He did have that moment where out of nowhere he told him that Shai should&rsquo;ve been MVP.</p>

<p>I agree with you though, Shaq as a personality is tough to pin down. He seems like generally a good guy who gives back a lot, but he also retains a chip on his shoulder and can be a bully to young players for seemingly no reason.</p>

<p>He obviously has had kind words for Jokic since it&rsquo;s impossible not to have said nice things about one of the best players of all time when you are in media but dude is not a Jokic &ldquo;supporter&rdquo;.</p>

      <label for="lkqu3hz" class="commentText"><p>What you are describing isn&rsquo;t inconsistent: Shaq views himself as part of a group of elite centers and he views his job as encouraging this legacy by hyping up big men that have made it (see: welcoming Jokic to the so-called &ldquo;Big Man Alliance&rdquo;) and continuously pushing and demanding more of those he feels aren&rsquo;t quite there (see: years of prodding Dwight and others). This reflects what he thought of his own experience entering the league, when (he thought that) legends like Kareem wouldn&rsquo;t give him his props until he really won and made his legacy.</p>

      <label for="lkpkrc3" class="commentText"><p>My theory is he probably feels he left something on the table. Once MJ retired the second time, he should&rsquo;ve won MVP every year until voter fatigued set in, but he loved to party during the off-season so he had to play himself into shape every season. And if he set aside his pride about his free throws and tried to do anything and everything to improve his technique he would&rsquo;ve been more unstoppable. Shaq could&rsquo;ve been in the convo to be one of the all time greats but he didn&rsquo;t have the drive like those guys in that tier.</p>

<p>Saying this is hilarious because he was already one of the most unstoppable players since wilt.</p>

<p>Another example, he has said multiple times Nash “stole his” MVP when he averaged “28-15”. In reality he averaged 23-10.</p>

      <label for="lkt7o2d" class="commentText"><p>Shaq changed team construction for over decade.</p>

<p>7 foot PFs weren&rsquo;t a normal thing before Shaq. All the skilled would be centers moved to PFs cause f guarding  Shaq. Thus came the golden era of PFs and Center became a more &ldquo;talentless&rdquo; brute, dirty work position.
Also now you have two 7 foot ring protector instead of one at any moment, combined with the low three point volume, causing the scoring draught of the early 2000s. Some of these effects persistent a couple years even after Shaq retired. This is how we got DeAndre Jordan all nba first team.</p>

<p>The league has reajusted (a long side with other modern influences of course). Skill bigs have gone back mostly to 5 and the 4 position has become more of a flex position, without a set template and very varied set of skills filling whatever the team lacks.</p>

They only refer to his defense when showing those highlight chase down blocks in those Cavs Runs. No the 76ers weren’t scrubs but AI did a lot of carrying  for an offensively challenged team. Regardless of having quality defenders , having multiple people knowing how to put the ball in the damn basket will always be more important.</p>

<p>Nah, the Lakers had the best 2 players on the floor, but the Pistons had the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th best players. Karl Malone was a solid player, but he was in his 40s and not named LeBron Raymone James so he wasn&rsquo;t playing at a star level anymore and missed half the season. Gary Payton was in his mid-30s. Again, a solid player, but on the decline.</p>

<p>The media horrendously underestimated a Pistons team that</p>

<ol>
<li><p>&ldquo;Has no Hall of Famers&rdquo; despite having 2 Hall of Famers</p></li>

<li><p>Set shot-clock era records for most consecutive opponents held under 100, most consecutive opponents held under 70, most total opponents held under 70&hellip; and for good measure had played a conference finals game that set the record for most blocks in a game</p></li>

<li><p>Set a shot-clock era record for fewest points per game allowed in a non-lockout-shortened season</p></li>

<li><p>Unlike the Lakers&hellip; loved each other</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Everybody got caught up in the glitz and glamour of the Lakers 2 superstars and forgot that maybe if a team can be statistically argued as the greatest defense of all time, they might be worth taking seriously.</p>

<p>Eventually I joked it was &ldquo;88 pickles&rdquo; and a friend arrived, and without context heard me saying I was going to eat 88 pickles.

Put it this way, if you take that team and replace Kobe with a borderline All-Star level SG, they&rsquo;d likely still win at least one title. Take that team and replace Shaq with a borderline All-Star level C, no way they win a single title during that run.</p>

He led the entire NBA in both PPG and RPG in the playoffs, while still being an elite interior defender. He scored way more than Kobe on much higher efficiency.</p>

<p>The rest of the threepeat the load was much more evenly shared between the two, but in 2000 it was clearly Shaq&rsquo;s team still. He was MVP, finals MVP, all star game MVP, second in DPOY voting, led the league in scoring in the regular season and postseason, obviously All-NBA and All-Defense teams, he was clearly the best player in the NBA in 2000.</p>

How the fuck are you going to say he was just riding along when he was the one that <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200006040LAL.html" target="_blank">led</a> the insane comeback in game 7.

      <label for="lks76cm" class="commentText"><p>That series taught me how great Hakeem was. he was all over the place, and was working the ball to the open man routinely. Scoring over 30 every game on both Shaq AND Horace Grant, who was a really solid player.</p>

<p>Game 3 Hakeem had 31/14/7. In a game they won by 3. In the closeout game, Olajuwon followed that with 35/15/6. Just insane.</p>

<p>I remember watching that game and going wow, what can&rsquo;t this guy do? Seemed like that year everyone was talking about Shaq and how dominant he was, Shaq won the scoring title and was second in mvp. He was breaking backboards and had some insane performances. I think that Rockets series took everybody by surprise, not just beating the Magic but sweeping them.</p>

      <label for="lksuj7c" class="commentText"><p>Nephews in here looking for receipts are missing the point. Every single oral history is incorrect,  people lack the ability to remember things perfectly, and the more you tell a story the bigger it gets.  When someone tells you a story it tells you a lot about them, and a little about what actually happened. </p>

<p>We got people who didn&rsquo;t see the game, never saw even a replay or a recap trying to convince you that they got an opinion worth listening to because they read a boxscore and couldn&rsquo;t even remember what&rsquo;s in it 10 minutes later telling you someone who played in the games recollection is wrong. Yea it is, so is yours, so is everyone else&rsquo;s. History is narratives and experiences googling basketball stats is neither.</p>

<p>P.S. Hakeem the most overrated player of all time, never would have won shit if Jordan wasn&rsquo;t forced by jfk to retire. And before you say jfk was assassinated did you see the body? Didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>
