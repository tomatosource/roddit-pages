      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ehtcf4/the_hawks_are_building_around_trae_how_would_you/"><p>The Hawks are building around Trae. How would you grade their offseason and what do you think their outlook is going forward?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Hawks went from 10th in the lottery to 1st in the draft and took Risacher. Risacher didn&rsquo;t play much in Summer League but what we saw is a guy who is a plug-and-play guy who isn&rsquo;t afraid to shoot, can get out in transition, and defend multiple positions.</p>

<p>The Hawks have built a roster around Trae most similar to their 2021 ECF team than we&rsquo;ve seen since. Capela is still on the roster, but the Hawks reportedly have a high price on Capela. Okongwu has had injuries and although Capela has declined, he is still a serviceable C with good chemistry with Trae.</p>

<p>Jalen Johnson is definitely starting to come along but he too has had injuries. He fills the stat sheet, has become a solid wing defender. He doesn&rsquo;t have an elite offensive skill yet but shows flashes and can contribute in all departments. Nice to have connectors and guys who have feel and can pass like Risacher and Johnson next to Trae.</p>

<p>Dyson Daniels has good feel for the game on both ends, and can guard. The shooting hasn&rsquo;t come in for him yet, turnover rate is too high, but he is a smart cutter and talented passer and has some post game. If the shooting ever comes in he&rsquo;d be a nice fit next to Trae. He&rsquo;s still only 21. Bufkin gonna get real time this season and is an intriguing talent.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll see what they do with Nance, but he&rsquo;s the kind of high energy defensive minded forward that also would be a nice fit with the identity and roster it looks like the Hawks are looking to build around Trae if they keep him. If not, they&rsquo;ll get maybe a few seconds for him and the assets don&rsquo;t hurt. They&rsquo;d trade Hunter if they could, but he doesn&rsquo;t have much value. Not the worst player to have around though&hellip;his shot diet was more efficient last season, shot a career high from 3, but is also injury prone. With more team size, maybe he isn&rsquo;t forced to play as much PF.</p>

<p>The Hawks got a first rounder in the 2025 Draft in the DeJounte deal (Lakers) and a decent chance at two first round picks this season&hellip;Kings have to make the playoffs for that to convey. Not unlikely they end up with two top 20-22 picks. They also gained a 2027 first. Wanna know what you all think about their offseason moves and if you think the direction they&rsquo;ve taken is the right one for their franchise now and long term&hellip;or not.</p>

Trump just said police would have blanket immunity in a society where police are killing unarmed innocent black citizens. A vote for trump is basically saying me or people like me are going to be killed with no repercussions. So why would I be ok with that? How the fuck did you get that from a basketball discussion. It’s actually disgusting the way you tried to attach that to my character because I said Trae Young should have talented teammates before what talk about what he can’t lead a team to.</p>

      <label for="lg1x49d" class="commentText"><p>I think the Hawks are the team I look at with the highest potential variance of any team in the NBA. There&rsquo;s so many moving parts, so many players they&rsquo;re banking on developing and so many players on the potential trade block that I can honestly say any result from a 4 seed to missing the play-in entirely is on the table.</p>

<p>I would probably speculate that they&rsquo;re one of the higher play-in seeds if they have average injury luck, but if Jalen Johnson/OO/Hunter misses any extended period of time there&rsquo;s a lot weighing on rookies and players they&rsquo;re assuming have/will have developed.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll say they beat the preseason O/U of 34.5 wins and make the play-in, but again, there&rsquo;s a lot of volatility to factor in to potential outcomes here.</p>

<p>Oh, the grade. It&rsquo;s a B. It was a boring but necessary set of moves this off-season. Some team friendly contracts, but until we see how the new additions perform any other speculation in either direction is pretty baseless.</p>

      <label for="lg2w2vc" class="commentText"><p>I was like, damn, why is the most well informed and reasonable takes in the thread? Then I saw the flair- makes sense. I would say a B given my personal feelings headed into the off-season, but realistically a B- or C+ might be a less biased grade. I mean I’m not sure what else the FO could have really done, given the market for the pieces we’d be looking to trade, but it feels like we didn’t get much better. We just maybe make a little more sense.</p>

They&rsquo;ve gotta trade Trae for either draft capital or another all star if they plan on rebuilding in the next couple years. They have to at least compete this upcoming season and hope they can be a mid tier team, fighting for the playoffs cuz otherwise we&rsquo;re going to get a great pick with Wemby entering his prime and Castle with another year under his belt</p>

      <label for="lg1uc9i" class="commentText"><p>Probably a C- to D+ if they don&rsquo;t use those picks from the Murray-to-Pelicans trade to upgrade their starting center and wing positions because they got worse as a team and failed to address other notable needs <em>while also not having the option to tank</em> because they traded their picks/pick control from 2025-27 as part of the Dejounte Murray trade with the Spurs.</p>

<p>Fit aside, Dyson Daniels is straight up a worse player than Dejounte Murray and Risacher is probably a year or two away from being a good option at the 3 or 4.  Plus it&rsquo;s not like they moved AJ Griffin for anyone/anything of note with them selling on him in a historically weak draft.</p>

<p>I like Jalen Johnson but there&rsquo;s a lot of pressure on him to continue on his improvements from last season for one to have any hope of this team being anything more than a play-in hopeful.</p>

      <label for="lg2mewk" class="commentText"><p>The people downvoting this clearly didn’t watch much Hawks basketball. I love a lot of things about DJ but he was bad off ball, didn’t defend well, and was not efficient when running point.</p>

<p>He’s a better player than any single player the Hawks got back but a bad fit. Constantly forcing midrange jumpers was not going to translate to Hawks wins. I think people are going to be surprised when the Hawks look better this coming season than last year.</p>

      <label for="lg279hl" class="commentText"><p>Trae Young on/ Dejounte off over the course of the season was +3.1 Net for the season. The worst two man lineup on the entire team was Trae/Dejounte. Also Hawks had to deal with injuries to basically the entire rotation other than Bogi and Dejounte:</p>

<p>Games missed: Trae 28, Jalen Johnson 26, Okongwu 27, Hunter 25, Capela 11. This team basically had to piece meal lineups without depth either.</p>

<p>Also there is a lot of room for growth with their young players like Jalen, Okongwu, Dyson, Risacher, Bufkin.</p>

<p>Not to mention the bottom of the East is also bad. There is plenty of room to improve.</p>

      <label for="lg1s9h1" class="commentText"><p>I don’t really think the Hawks are building their team with Trae as their main priority.  He isn’t their most untouchable player, Jalen Johnson is.  Yes Risacher compliments Trae, but Clingan would have arguably more.  Risacher and Jalen, however, are perfect matches next to each other.  </p>

<p>The Hawks are operating as if they are trying to build stars from within.  If their FO spoke candidly, I think they would say that they would  like for JJ or Risacher or another young forward prospect to surpass Trae as their #1 option.  And with good reason, besides Steph(best shooter of all time) the last time a small guard was the best player on a championship team was Isaiah Thompson. </p>

<p>Anyways, I think they have had as good of an off season as they could have.  All of the Hawks worst line ups involved both DJM and Trae.  By removing Dejounte and giving his usage to other players like Jalen (3.5 assists per game last year playing w/ two ball dominant guards) you have addition by subtraction. </p>

<p>The Hawks biggest weakness since drafting Trae has been POA defense on the perimeter.  They brought in Risacher who projects well in that area and Dyson Daniels who is a top 5 POA defender in the league.  They also signed Vit Krejci who vastly improved his POA defense last year. </p>

<p>Mix that in with getting Nance who offers more trade flexibility in Capela and OO talks, getting the lakers high upside 2025 pick, and getting a 2027 pick and things are really looking up for the Hawks imo.  If they stay healthy, which hasn’t happened since 2021, I see them as a 45+ win team.</p>

      <label for="lg28bnx" class="commentText"><p>Jalen was in discussions to be the number 1 pick in his draft class his junior year and then barely played competitive basketball for 2-3 years.  He has blue chip pedigree and a high basketball IQ, there is no reason to believe he can’t add to his bag now that he is getting minutes. </p>

<p>This summer he’s been posting a lot of clips on instagram specifically of him doing drills to improve drawing fouls. Last year was his first real NBA year and he’s had a healthy off season.  This season will tell us a lot about who he really is as a player.</p>

<p> There is plenty of tape out there of Risacher effectively playing POA on smaller guards in Europe.  The Hawks have been consistent in referring to him as a wing even though he is 6’10.  He started at the 2 in summer league.  He will spend plenty of time defending guards at the POA this year.</p>

The Dejounte trade was nice, recouped some picks and got Dyson Daniels, and we desperately need defense. Whether we are better or not depends on the progression of Jalen Johnson into a legit, healthy second best player and the development of Risachar and Bufkin into solid role players. Best case scenario is probably a 6-7 seed, worst case is we give the Spurs a lottery pick.</p>

Murray’s tenure got off on the wrong foot with the McMillan/Young thing going on. Not sure why you hire Snyder on a 5 year deal and dump Murray for essentially roster filler a year later. We’ll see what they get with those picks. I expected Atlanta to be a buyer, not a seller. I expect them to have a rough year, fire Snyder, and trade Trae next offseason. And how do you not trade Capela. And how do you not trade the #1 pick for a meaningful upgrade. I’m going to give them the benefit of the doubt that they tried to trade the pick, and they picked the right guy at least, so they get a D from me.</p>

      <label for="lg3djgh" class="commentText"><p>Agreed. It&rsquo;s definitely possible to build around Trae with the right pieces. He took a team full of hot garbage to a 4th quarter lead in game 6 against the Celtics in the playoffs last year. I think the moves they made this offseason were about as good as they could possibly have done.. there was no &ldquo;star&rdquo; who was available by free agency or trade, so they took the path they should have taken years ago when they didn&rsquo;t pull the trigger on the proposed Hawks-Spurs Derrick White trade and ended up with the much lesser Spurs guard with the DJ trade. They finally got this man a backcourt partner who can actually defend the POA at a very high level the way Dyson Daniels can.</p>
