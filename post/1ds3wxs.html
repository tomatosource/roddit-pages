<p>With the Lakers, he’d start because they need his shooting. They need him to shoot 10 3s a game. How many shots do you think he will get in GS?</p>

      <label for="lazudwj" class="commentText"><p>thats kinda why it&rsquo;s been rough for us as dubs fans.</p>

<p>We love klay, his play has fallen off a bit, I think situations around the team and with his mental hasn&rsquo;t helped.</p>

<p>Physically, I think klay is fine, he isn&rsquo;t a number 1 defender, but he can be on the court and be a neutral or slight - or + defender depending on the matchup and night.</p>

<p>When he takes good shots and doesn&rsquo;t get in his head he can still shoot like no one other than 30.
The problem is he like, feels like he had sometihng to prove, he was taking and rushing shots prime klay never did. If he bought into being a 3 and D type player, he&rsquo;d still be a high 18ppg efficient scorer with the caveat that if he gets hot he can win you a game.</p>

<p>I love klay, it just feels like timing was ALL bad for him. He got two shitty injuries twice right after losing the finals. We just lost KD so everyone in the media took their digs and shots at us for 2 years, and Klay couldn&rsquo;t even play.
He finally comes back and there&rsquo;s obvious rust, his age was bad, everything just ugh. Then they won a chip, but tensions were already rumored between him and JP. Then Draymond punched JP. Then now our chemistry internally is fucked.</p>

<p>Steph and Kerr and whoever else in that building really let everything get out of hand.
This dynasty ended (well playing wise its over, but the final blowup is still in process) really weirdly. It&rsquo;s going out almost historically badly, but they came up historically so.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a wild ride. If you told 13 year old me 15 years ago the dubs would have four championships, i would have been so happy.</p>

<p>It was a great era, sad to see it end like this.</p>

<p>He was only going to miss a few months at the start of the following season… until he tore his achilles.</p>

<p>It’s not like it was given out of charity or to “reward” him, it was because they wanted to keep him. Every single team with cap space that season would have gave him the exact same contract</p>

And before somebody replies that that&rsquo;s how rookie contracts work&hellip; yes, and paying him while he was injured is also how contracts work, they weren&rsquo;t doing some kind of charity, they gave him a contract because they wanted to retain him on their team.</p>

<p>They paid him $266 million in the 13 years since he&rsquo;s been drafted. If they had the opportunity to go back in time and do that again, they&rsquo;d do it in a heartbeat. He provided value that way exceeds that. Yet people are acting like they did him some kind of charity.</p>

<p>he came back from two devastating injuries, and his team won the title. but maybe his lack of a defining performance during that playoff run didnt make it feel as sweet.</p>

Now it&rsquo;s reported he may take less than what gsw offered because he felt disrespected? This is vindictive spouse behavior. If I&rsquo;m not happy no one is happy. That&rsquo;s a 180 in personality trait for klay. So yes downfall for his ego</p>

When people talk about klay in 10 years, they’re going to talk splash bros, that warriors run, his shooting. No ones gunna be saying “well his last 2 years he was a little bitch” no matter how true it is.</p>

<p>I think downfall is a pretty heavy exaggeration. This is coming from someone who’s always been annoyed by his demeanor.</p>

<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if the offer today is a little lower than that, especially when they thought they might have to pay PG13 $49m this coming season, but he&rsquo;s not leaving because they don&rsquo;t have a competitive offer.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s leaving because they&rsquo;re telling him he isn&rsquo;t guaranteed to start next season.</p>

<p>He got benched for not playing well, they offered him 2 years for 48 million which is roughly in line with Draymond and Steph. I feel like I’m insane lol</p>

<p>Shot .503 from 2pt</p>

<p>Shot .387 from 3pt (<sup>268</sup>&frasl;<sub>692</sub>)</p>

<p>Shot .927 (led NBA) from FT</p>

<p>His EFG was .551,  which is better than Book, Brunson, or Donovan Mitchell</p>

<p>Klay is nowhere near the athlete he was pre- injury.  He is also still one of the best shooters in the league. This is not debatable, it’s a fact.</p>
