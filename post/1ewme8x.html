      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ewme8x/why_are_nba_players_playing_in_pro_am_leaguespick/"><p>Why are NBA players playing in Pro Am leagues/pick up games so much more competitive than the All Star game?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Looking at Drew Leage and Rico Hines runs clips on youtube, it looks like the NBA players that participate play a lot harder there than the ASG, which is just a glorified lay up line nowadays. Why is that? I figured the ASG would be an even better place to polish their skills as they’re playing against the best of the best, compared to the semi-amateurs they see in the Pro Am circles. Plus in both cases they risk injury. Not saying they should go 100% in the ASG, but the same level of competitiveness and effort as they put into playing in a pick up game would be nice to see.</p>

For decades these guys grew up watching their heroes play and they wanted to give back. They didn&rsquo;t have to play. Players like Jason Kidd, Brian Shaw, Gary Payton and other NBA players were all from that area and there was a real buzz having them back. This was all before the official NBA summer league got so big.</p>

      <label for="lj0hu28" class="commentText"><p>Lot of cap in these comments.</p>

<p>The main excuse as to why they don&rsquo;t play hard in All-Star is injuries.</p>

<p>They can be injured in these leagues as well.</p>

<p>Like at a certain point you have to stop making excuses for dudes getting paid 50 million a year who will cry about not being selected as an All-Star because of the monetary ramifications but when they do get selected they then proceed to show zero respect or care to the fans who voted for them and sleep walk their way through the game because they&rsquo;re just too cool to care.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s fucking embarrassing.</p>

      <label for="lj0jexk" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s both that they have nothing to prove and also that they are not looking to improve their skills from 20 minutes played in a single mid season game.</p>

<p>Shaming all stars from not going all out is so silly. If your argument is that it&rsquo;s bad culture you don&rsquo;t create good culture from shaming behind keyboards, and the argument is arguably dumb in itself. The league needs to design better incentives to improve the asg or maybe do away with it entirely and try new things.</p>

      <label for="lj1877q" class="commentText"><p>This comment section is a great source of excuses for NBA players as to why they don’t play with any effort in the all star game</p>

<p>The problem is historically NBA players actually DID care about how they played in the all star game.</p>

<p>And nothing has changed since then. Oh wait, some things have: private jets, sports science, and easier schedules.</p>

<p>So yeah, there’s no excuse as to why they couldn’t put in a bit of effort. They just choose not to, right in front of our face. It’s a disgrace.</p>

<p>As Dr J says, “we’re caretakers of the game”.</p>

<p>And unfortunately the guys today have completely fucked it.</p>
