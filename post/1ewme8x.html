      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ewme8x/why_are_nba_players_playing_in_pro_am_leaguespick/"><p>Why are NBA players playing in Pro Am leagues/pick up games so much more competitive than the All Star game?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Looking at Drew Leage and Rico Hines runs clips on youtube, it looks like the NBA players that participate play a lot harder there than the ASG, which is just a glorified lay up line nowadays. Why is that? I figured the ASG would be an even better place to polish their skills as they’re playing against the best of the best, compared to the semi-amateurs they see in the Pro Am circles. Plus in both cases they risk injury. Not saying they should go 100% in the ASG, but the same level of competitiveness and effort as they put into playing in a pick up game would be nice to see.</p>

For decades these guys grew up watching their heroes play and they wanted to give back. They didn&rsquo;t have to play. Players like Jason Kidd, Brian Shaw, Gary Payton and other NBA players were all from that area and there was a real buzz having them back. This was all before the official NBA summer league got so big.</p>

<p>Which is my only gripe. I don&rsquo;t care about them taking it seriously. I want a joke of a game, but one where they&rsquo;re still putting on a show and doing cool shit. Wild alleys and passes, etc. Not just throwing up 300 unguarded threes.</p>

For a lot of these players during the Summer it&rsquo;s been months since they&rsquo;ve played a competitive game.

<p>Drew league and what not, are legit competitions. Where NBA players play against guys at a much lower level of skill than them. So they are playing hard to win, but it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re playing at an NBA level of speed or focus.</p>

<p>The main excuse as to why they don&rsquo;t play hard in All-Star is injuries.</p>

<p>They can be injured in these leagues as well.</p>

<p>Like at a certain point you have to stop making excuses for dudes getting paid 50 million a year who will cry about not being selected as an All-Star because of the monetary ramifications but when they do get selected they then proceed to show zero respect or care to the fans who voted for them and sleep walk their way through the game because they&rsquo;re just too cool to care.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s fucking embarrassing.</p>

<p>Shaming all stars from not going all out is so silly. If your argument is that it&rsquo;s bad culture you don&rsquo;t create good culture from shaming behind keyboards, and the argument is arguably dumb in itself. The league needs to design better incentives to improve the asg or maybe do away with it entirely and try new things.</p>

      <label for="lj2r5wv" class="commentText"><p>The ASG weekend is like a pony show for the league. Since the players are all in one city, there&rsquo;s tons of media responsibilities, lots of sitting around and waiting, lots of chaos, and lots of getting shuttled from one publicity event to the next. It&rsquo;s cameras, microphones, and handlers everywhere. It&rsquo;s exhausting for the players. Heck, when I worked at one of the ASGs on the media side, it was exhausting for me! Lots of competing interests for players time and attention. So playing in the game is more about putting on the show and not getting hurt for the most important time of the season for the players who are actually trying to make a playoff run.</p>

      <label for="lj1877q" class="commentText"><p>This comment section is a great source of excuses for NBA players as to why they don’t play with any effort in the all star game</p>

<p>The problem is historically NBA players actually DID care about how they played in the all star game.</p>

<p>And nothing has changed since then. Oh wait, some things have: private jets, sports science, and easier schedules.</p>

<p>So yeah, there’s no excuse as to why they couldn’t put in a bit of effort. They just choose not to, right in front of our face. It’s a disgrace.</p>

<p>As Dr J says, “we’re caretakers of the game”.</p>

Plus, they&rsquo;re already getting months of the year off of work.  The most I&rsquo;ve ever had was two weeks, and that was a union job.</p>

<p>Just another feather in Jordan&rsquo;s cap. He understood the relationship. Look back when he said that it might be the spectator&rsquo;s first time seeing him play (or even their only chance, to add to his point).  It was his job, his obligation, to put on the best show he could for that person every night.</p>
