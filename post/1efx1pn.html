      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1efx1pn/the_best_and_worst_dunkers_by_the_numbers_plus/"><p>The best and worst dunkers, by the numbers &ndash; plus, why can&rsquo;t the Bulls dunk?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Kevin Durant famously once said, “<a href="https://x.com/KDTrey5/status/1376187247461023746?lang=en" target="_blank">NBA fans don’t like anything about the NBA</a>,” and if you’re online as much as I am, it can definitely feel that way at times.</p>

<p>But there’s one thing that everyone loves: dunks.</p>

<p>Basketball’s most iconic play is simply a player jumping up and pushing the ball through the hoop from above. It’s not complicated, but it is beautiful. Whether it’s someone cocking the ball back to their knees… [<a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/who-are-the-best-nba-dunkers-who" target="_blank">video of that monster Alondes Williams slam from Summer League</a>]</p>

<p>&hellip;or a yam so explosive that both dunker and dunkee become collateral damage in the relentless pursuit of artistic perfection… [<a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/who-are-the-best-nba-dunkers-who" target="_blank">video of Anthony Edwards bodying John Collins &ndash; you know the one</a>]</p>

<p>&hellip;there is no more exciting play to watch.</p>

<p>You know what else is exciting? Numbers and charts! So I’m here to deep-dive the dunk.</p>

<p>Per data I compiled from Basketball-Reference and the league’s play-by-play data, the league made 11,595 dunks last year and only missed 1,425. That’s a conversion rate of 89.1% — far better than the expected value on free throws, three-pointers, or anything else you can name. That means that the dunk is both the coolest and most effective shot in basketball.</p>

<p>Let’s break it down further. One caveat: this data does not fouls resulting in misses, as there aren’t good ways to distinguish between missed layups and dunks that result in fouls. Made dunks drawing an and-one are included. So keep that in mind.</p>

<p><em>[I don&rsquo;t understand how to format things in Reddit, so this could get ugly. I have much</em><a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/who-are-the-best-nba-dunkers-who" target="_blank"> <em>neater and easier to read charts</em></a> <em>here &ndash; scatterplots galore!]</em></p>

<p>First, who tried to dunk the most? The leaders will not surprise you:</p>

<p><strong>PLAYER / DUNK ATTEMPTS / ATTEMPTS PER GAME</strong></p>

<p>Gobert / 271 / 3.6</p>

<p>Antetokounmpo / 264 / 3.6</p>

<p>AD / 208 / 2.7</p>

<p>J Allen / 199 / 2.6</p>

<p>Claxton / 191 / 2.7</p>

<p>Gafford / 188 / 2.5</p>

<p>Wembanyama / 187 / 2.6</p>

<p>Gordon / 183 / 2.5</p>

<p>Duren / 167 / 2.7</p>

<p>Kuminga / 157 / 2.1</p>

<p>Lively II / 156 / 2.8</p>

<p>Capela / 156 /2.1</p>

<p>Adebayo / 151 / 2.1</p>

<p>Holmgren / 149 / 1.8</p>

<p>Richards / 133 / 2.0</p>

<p>Mobley / 132 / 2.6</p>

<p>Zubac / 127 / 1.9</p>

<p>Kessler / 127 / 2.0</p>

<p>Jackson-Davis / 124 / 1.8</p>

<p>Sabonis / 121 / 1.5</p>

<p>Water pistol to your head, you probably would have guessed that Giannis Antetokounmpo and Rudy Gobert were the two most prolific dunkers both on a per-game and an absolute basis. Still, the gap between them and third-place Dereck Lively is astonishing. They’re averaging nearly one more dunk per game than Lively!</p>

<p>Since someone will ask, 39-year-old LeBron James comes in as the 30th-most prolific dunker in absolute terms with 90 attempts (1.3 per game). I once did <a href="https://fansided.com/2023/02/07/lebron-james-dunk-aging-curve/" target="_blank">a whole analysis on the dunking aging curve</a>, and my conclusion was that the majority of players dunk the most (as a percentage of their shots) as rookies, and most of the remaining players dunk the most in their second or third years. James, naturally, was an outlier. His dunk rate (dunks as a % of field goal attempts) of 7.1% last year would have been his highest since the 2018-2019 season and is actually higher than he averaged his first five years in the league. It&rsquo;s remarkable he&rsquo;s still rim-rocking at the same rate as he did when he was 25.</p>

<p>Speaking of dunk rate, who is dunking the most as a percentage of their field goals?</p>

<p><strong>PLAYER / DUNK ATTEMPTS / % OF FGAS THAT ARE DUNKS</strong></p>

<p>Sims / 32 / 58.2%</p>

<p>Lively II / 156 / 52.7%</p>

<p>J Hayes / 82 /46.9%</p>

<p>Gobert / 271 / 44.1%</p>

<p>Jordan / 41 / 44.1%</p>

<p>M Robinson / 52 / 40.9%</p>

<p>Kornet / 82 / 40.4%</p>

<p>Gafford / 188 / 39.2%</p>

<p>Jackson-Davis / 124 / 37.3%</p>

<p>Kessler / 127 / 36.3%</p>

<p>Richards / 133 / 35.4%</p>

<p>I Jackson / 82 / 35.2%</p>

<p>Eubanks / 85 / 33.6%</p>

<p>M Williams / 50 / 33.1%</p>

<p>Claxton / 191 / 32.8%</p>

<p>McGee / 40 / 30.3%</p>

<p>Duren / 167 / 29.6%</p>

<p>Queta / 30 / 28.8%</p>

<p>Wiseman / 86 / 28.2%</p>

<p>Bitadze / 57 / 27.3%</p>

<p><strong>LEAGUEWIDE AVERAGE: 6.0%</strong> (<em>dragged down by the number of guys who never dunk</em>)</p>

<p>Jericho Sims and Dereck Lively are the only players with a 50%+ dunk share, which is pretty wild. Naturally, this graph is composed entirely of centers (many of them backups). Shouts to KJ Martin (re-signed to that trade-tastic contract), Aaron Gordon, and Evan Mobley for being the only non-full-time-centers in the top 30, but none of them crack the top 20 I listed above.</p>

<p>Now that we know who dunks the most, your next question might be who *misses* the most. Well, I have the answer right here:</p>

<p><strong>PLAYER / DUNK ATTEMPTS / DUNK FG% (LOWEST TO HIGHEST)</strong></p>

<p>P George / 40 / 72.5%</p>

<p>P Williams / 39 / 74.4%</p>

<p>Westbrook / 50 / 76.0%</p>

<p>Suggs / 34 / 76.5%</p>

<p>Eubanks / 85 / 77.6%</p>

<p>D Jones Jr. / 78 / 79.5%</p>

<p>Whitmore / 50 / 80.0%</p>

<p>Camara / 30 / 80.0%</p>

<p>J Brown / 94 / 80.9%</p>

<p>Sims / 32 / 81.3%</p>

<p>Vučević / 38 / 81.6%</p>

<p>Jaquez Jr. / 35 / 82.9%</p>

<p>KJ Martin / 41 / 82.9%</p>

<p>Porter Jr. / 59 / 83.1%</p>

<p>Oubre Jr. / 103 / 83.5%</p>

<p>Smith Jr. / 55 / 83.6%</p>

<p>Agbaji / 37 / 83.8%</p>

<p>Sharpe / 31 / 83.9%</p>

<p>Drummond / 77 / 84.4%</p>

<p>Jad McDaniels / 58 / 84.5%</p>

<p><strong>LEAGUEWIDE AVERAGE: 89.1%</strong></p>

<p>You might notice that none of the top dunkers by volume are on the low field goal percentage list (Jarrett Allen is the &ldquo;worst&rdquo; of the bunch, converting 85.4%). Generally speaking, the more prolific dunkers are *good* at dunking because they&rsquo;re A) giant and B) given an easier diet of shots &ndash; lobs, dump-offs at the rim, dunks off offensive rebounds, etc.</p>

<p>With several notable exceptions, this list skews toward younger, shorter players trying to dunk off the dribble. Whereas many centers feast on alley-oops, guys like Jalen Suggs, Shaedon Sharpe, and Cam Whitmore are doing a lot of their work with the ball in their hands. They have to beat their own man (often on sloppy closeouts) and then dunk while Ent-sized help defenders lurking in the paint come to deter them. It’s hard!</p>

<p>Paul George, Patrick Williams, and Russell Westbrook are the three players most likely to clank their dunks. Candidly, Patrick Williams inspired this analysis. Every time I watch a Bulls game, it feels like he biffs one, so I wanted to see his success rate. And it’s not great!</p>

<p>In their prime, former Clippers George and Westbrook were two of the best in-game dunkers in the league, but they aren’t quite the athletes they once were. It’s not as easy to jam from the dotted line on top of three defenders when you’re in your mid-thirties, but their brains haven’t entirely caught up to that reality (and I love them for it): [<a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/who-are-the-best-nba-dunkers-who" target="_blank">video of George trying an epic slam and getting blocked into oblivion instead</a>]</p>

<p>But whereas George’s misses are almost always the result of an overly ambitious attempt in traffic, Westbrook’s are often lightly contested. He gets the separation, and it looks like he’s got the distance… then it slips from his hand like my toddler’s peanut butter and jelly sandwich, making just as big a mess: [<a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/who-are-the-best-nba-dunkers-who" target="_blank">video of a nasty Westbrook drive causing a defender to fall down that ends in an inexplicable miss</a>]</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth reiterating that players like George and Westbrook are generally attempting some of the most difficult dunks in the game, so it only makes sense they&rsquo;d have lower conversion rates. Regardless, even the relative “worst” dunkers are still making over 70% of their attempts. It’s almost always worth trying.</p>

<p>Speaking of teammates, shoutout to the quartet (!!) of Rockets in the top 30. Alperen Sengun, Jalen Green, Cam Whitmore, *and* Jabari Smith Jr. all make an appearance. Ah, to be young again.</p>

<p>However, despite having four of the least accurate dunkers, Houston wasn’t the worst dunking team. Our guys in Chicago slammed as if they had hooves for hands. Look at how bad they are at dunking!</p>

<p><strong>TEAM / DUNK ATTEMPTS / DUNK FG%</strong></p>

<p>IND / 450 / 92.2%</p>

<p>LAL / 578 / 92.2%</p>

<p>UTA / 533 / 91.7%</p>

<p>DEN / 480 / 91.3%</p>

<p>MIL / 408 / 91.2%</p>

<p>CHA / 417 / 91.1%</p>

<p>DET / 519 / 90.6%</p>

<p>ATL / 492 / 90.4%</p>

<p>WAS / 425 / 90.1%</p>

<p>ORL / 504 / 89.9%</p>

<p>NOP / 382 / 89.8%</p>

<p>BOS / 491 / 89.4%</p>

<p>CLE / 497 / 89.3%</p>

<p>GSW / 415 / 89.2%</p>

<p>MIN	/ 522 / 89.1%</p>

<p>BKN / 399 / 88.7%</p>

<p>DAL / 504 / 88.7%</p>

<p>TOR / 353 / 88.7%</p>

<p>SAS / 493 / 88.6%</p>

<p>SAC / 403 / 88.3%</p>

<p>PHI / 350 / 88.3%</p>

<p>MIA / 342 / 88.0%</p>

<p>OKC / 399 / 87.7%</p>

<p>NYK / 371 / 87.6%</p>

<p>MEM / 317 / 87.4%</p>

<p>PHX / 397 / 87.2%</p>

<p>LAC / 499 / 86.8%</p>

<p>HOU / 441 / 85.9%</p>

<p>POR / 349 / 84.0%</p>

<p>CHI / 289 / 81.7%</p>

<p>It’s a bummer that the Bulls not only attempted the fewest dunks (they are the only team with &amp;lt;300 attempts) but also converted at the lowest rate. Fun fact: the first-place Lakers had precisely twice as many dunk attempts as last-place Chicago (578 vs. 289).</p>

<p>We already mentioned Williams, but Nikola Vucevic and Andre Drummond were both relatively bad, too. DeMar DeRozan was even worse (just 18 of 26 on dunks). In aggregate, Chicago’s top *seven* dunkers were all below-average finishers, many significantly so.</p>

<p>We also need to acknowledge Utah being the second-most-prolific and third-most-accurate dunking team. I don&rsquo;t think people realize how fun of a watch the Jazz were last season from an aerial acrobatics perspective. And that&rsquo;s despite not having a true, pedigreed point guard on the roster!</p>

<p>In general, teams that dunk more are likely to be better at dunking. As we established earlier, if you’re big and athletic enough to dunk often, you’re probably big and athletic enough to be *good* at dunking in traffic or making yourself a lob threat.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all I got!</p>

I know that long tables of numbers aren&rsquo;t ideal, so if you want to look at this in more detail, <a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/who-are-the-best-nba-dunkers-who" target="_blank">I&rsquo;ve got better visualizations here</a>.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen too many other leaguewide dunk deep-dives, so I thought it was worth sharing. Thanks!</p>

      <label for="lfo5txr" class="commentText"><p>Probably because the Bulls’ most prolific dunker in Lavine was injured for most of the year. Their other good dunker in DeMar has gotten older, so he’s not yamming it as much.</p>

<p>Vucevic also doesn’t dunk much for a center. Replace him with Gobert on the Bulls and the Bulls probably become the top dunking team.</p>

<p>LaVine, Javonte Green, Derrick Jones Jr, Caruso, DeRozan, Lonzo, Williams and Coby White all had some fantastic highlights, and with Lonzo throwing precision outlet passes they were dunking up a storm.</p>

      <label for="lfpx69q" class="commentText"><p>I thought about that, too, but it&rsquo;s pretty manual to calculate. I&rsquo;ve read that dunks have generally been pretty consistent for the last 10ish years, but that was awhile ago and I don&rsquo;t have the data to back it up.</p>

<p>I probably could calculate the total number of dunks in a season leaguewide over time without too much effort, though, as made dunks are pretty easy to pull (just the way that basketball reference is set up, it&rsquo;s slightly more intensive to calculate dunk <em>misses</em>), so assuming accuracy doesn&rsquo;t wildly swing that would get us 90% of the way there.</p>

<p>If I have time later this week I&rsquo;ll take a look and come back to this, but no promises.</p>

      <label for="lfp6iib" class="commentText"><p>Dunks generally are generated mainly in two ways, transition or if in the half court a P&amp;R resulting in a lob. Bulls purposely slow it down, Demar likes to walk the ball up and the offense relies on Demar &amp; Vucevic who like to power walk up the court. Bulls are 28th in pace, and not surprisingly we are 28th in transition points.</p>

<p>In the half court, Vucevic is the worst P&amp;R finisher in the league by the #s (as a starting 5). He can&rsquo;t move quickly enough to get to the rim and he can&rsquo;t jump to finish it anyway. Off the P&amp;R he typically goes the 3P line (where he can&rsquo;t shoot) or to the long 2 / mid area, which is the one area he shoots well.</p>

<p>While elderly players like DDR &amp; Vuc blowing dunks isn&rsquo;t a shock, Williams is a disappointment since he was drafted for his athleticism. He just doesn&rsquo;t handle the ball well and will lose it going up, or misjudges the distance and jumps out too far, but it&rsquo;s true he blows a lot of dunks for a young athlete. Overall he&rsquo;s one of the worst finishers at the rim this season, 57%. Most of the team is mid 60s up to 73%.</p>

      <label for="lfplu71" class="commentText"><p>The Bulls’ best five dunkers are all named Javonte Green (shout out Stacey King). And he ain’t even on the roster at this point. I watched every Bulls game from December to the play-in (because I hate myself, clearly) and the only dunks I remember were that Drummond/Terry disaster and Javonte Green’s comeback game.</p>

<p>Part of the problem is our frontcourt is super thin and the other part is Vooch don’t dunk. Can’t dunk? Is physically unable to dunk, maybe. He increasingly reminds me of Lurch from the Addams Family out there.</p>
