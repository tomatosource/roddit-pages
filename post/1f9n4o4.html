      <label for="lln1n0w" class="commentText"><p>To be fair it really should be.</p>

<p>All-NBA is a regular season award, and a guy playing 75-82 games at an 2nd/3rd team All-NBA level is typically more valuable for a regular season than a guy playing 55-65 games at a 1st team level.</p>

<p>If you just wanted them for a game, the guy at the 1st team level is better, but when someone has lays 75% of the season vs another that played 95% of the season, it is hard to say the player that missed 20% more games was more impactful unless they were notably better/above the other.</p>

      <label for="llmr3h8" class="commentText"><p>Eh - it&rsquo;s not crazy if you look at his career.  He took a few years to get going and then really only played 4-5 &ldquo;full&rdquo; seasons at his peak.  Like one year he got 3rd team was only 51 games, another 2nd team 56 games - nobody deserves first team for that few games.  Last couple years he&rsquo;s trailed off a bit due to age and other guys at their peak have jumped him.</p>

<p>And in the end, it&rsquo;s not like Steph has totally dominated the guard spot for the last decade - as this list shows there&rsquo;s been a bunch of other MVP caliber players right there with him.</p>

      <label for="llmy7ki" class="commentText"><p>I agree regarding the rationale for him not having a bunch of 1st team All NBAs, season-to-season different players have different peaks and narratives and of course the injuries.</p>

<p>But I disagree with the idea that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not like Steph has totally dominated the guard spot for the last decade&rdquo;</p>

<p>Steph was definitely the best guard in the NBA for 9 straight seasons. From 2014 all the way to 2022. In none of those years was there a guard more impactful to winning than Steph so he dominated the position imo. There&rsquo;s a reason LeBron and Steph are considered the legends of that era.</p>

      <label for="llnghgb" class="commentText"><p>I think looking back in retrospect it&rsquo;s easy to see Curry was the most influential guard from 2014-2022 but it&rsquo;s not like people weren&rsquo;t still arguing there were better players then him during those years.</p>

<p>There was 100% a narrative going that Curry wasn&rsquo;t as good as he was made out to be after the 2016 loss and Kyrie definitely outplayed him in that series.</p>

<p>Harden was putting up even better numbers on offense while being a legit threat to the Warriors in the play-offs despite Warriors obviously being a WAY more stacked team.</p>

<p>The fact that Curry was frequently injured, missed a TON of regular season games and wasn&rsquo;t winning the FMVP awards over Durant during those years.</p>

<p>And then there&rsquo;s definitely always going to be a crowd that fully believe Curry was just a product of playing for an insanely stacked roster during every one of those years and wouldn&rsquo;t have had nearly the same reputation/impact if he spent his career somewhere like Portland or Minnesota.</p>

<p>Personally agree that Him and Lebron were obviously the 2 face&rsquo;s of the League during that time but also would say there is still a pretty huge gap between Lebron and Curry in terms of individual dominance/impact. Don&rsquo;t think Curry would have been capable of carrying a franchise like the Blazers to the finals if him and Dame&rsquo;s spots were reversed as an example, while I fully believe Lebron could have gotten just about any team in the League to the finals during that time period.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Can&rsquo;t agree with that - not only did Westbrook/Harden each win an MVP right in the middle of those 9 seasons, but Harden also finished (much) higher than Curry in MVP voting for 4 straight seasons from 16-17 until 19-20.</p>

<p>Curry was the best guard for the 3 years before Harden, then Harden was the best guard for those 4 years.  Curry took the crown back for a year in 20-21, and then it&rsquo;s been Luka since.</p>

<p>Curry has been right up there for those 9 years, but so were Harden, Westbrook, and to a lesser extent Lillard in that same time frame.</p>

<p>If you look at their output in relation to their usage, Curry is clear from Westbrook and Harden.</p>

      <label for="lln9585" class="commentText"><p>Yeah this… Harden, Russ, AND Dame all had higher winshares and ws/48 in some seasons. Harden has a strong argument for being the best guard for multiple seasons throughout those 9 years.</p>

<p>Also team success is a huge factor. I guarantee if you swapped Steph and Harden’s teams, Harden would’ve had more success and accolades. I guarantee if Steph and Dame swapped, that warriors team would be hands down better than the blazers team. And higher seed= more likely to win mvp.</p>

      <label for="lln6t5y" class="commentText"><p>Steph made it both seasons before KD joined the Dubs. Then Steph’s scoring dropped from 30ppg to 25ppg and 26ppg the next two seasons.</p>

<p>Then he made it once with KD, got injured for a season, then KD left and his scoring bounced back up to 32ppg and he made it again. Then Luka arrives and Steph’s also battling against injuries and team record.</p>

<p>I’ll always contend that Steph could have had a chance at being considered a top 5 player of all time had KD not joined the Warriors right as he was in his prime. Both players played a rung below their peak capacity and basically faced fewer challenges thanks to that move.</p>

He&rsquo;d have better stats sure but honestly the warriors very possibly could&rsquo;ve never made those 2 extra finals had kd not been there and even during those finals there were plenty of times where steph just didn&rsquo;t play up to his standards so kd took over. In the end steph is top 10 and Durant has actually been underappreciated cus of being alongside curry</p>

They were limping into the playoffs meanwhile the suns were cruising . Obviously in hindsight Steph is a better player than Booker but he didn’t do much to show it in the regular season of 2022.</p>

After that, they coast a bit more in the regular season and keep it for the playoffs. Especially when you have KD on the team. It&rsquo;s crazy that the NBA is so post season heavy while having all these awards just being for the regular season.</p>

      <label for="llnao4l" class="commentText"><p>No it shouldn’t because the postseason is an uneven playing field and you’re only saying that because it supports your argument and Curry would get an extra 10-20 games on all of his competition. Every team has 82 game schedules and every team plays against each other. I’m not saying it’s Currys fault for not giving it 100% for all 82 games but you can’t hold it against guys like Dame, Westbrook or Booker who did. There’s plenty of examples of players going just as hard in the regular season no matter the circumstances (look at Curry and the Warriors in 2016).</p>

      <label for="llncwcy" class="commentText"><p>Yes. But that was in 2016 after they won their first title. It&rsquo;s a lot to expect them to do it every year when they were playing 20-25 more games than everyone else. I agree it&rsquo;s an even playing field. Which is why it&rsquo;s a regular season award. That&rsquo;s not in question. The issue is that all these teams make the playoffs and have to play a ton more games to win it all. And they&rsquo;re all being ignored. Meanwhile, no one remembers who the top seed was in 2022. Or 2020. They just remember who won it all. And that&rsquo;s all thrown out the window with these awards. IOW - The regular season isn&rsquo;t important yet 95% of the awards are for the regular season.</p>

      <label for="llnfkzc" class="commentText"><p>Your statement is so dumb I don’t even want to respond to it but I feel obliged to. There’s countless examples of players who make deep playoff runs and are fully capable of being All-NBA first team every season regardless. I’m not holding it against Steph but you can’t act like it’s impossible for him to do when he still gets 2-3 months off every offseason.</p>

<p>As for the regular season you are grossly wrong about peoples impressions on it. People absolutely remember regular season results because that’s how we evaluate their postseason performance. The Suns are still 100% looked at as chokers cause of 2022. The Bucks get cut some slack cause they won in 2021 but a lot of people think they fluked that title thanks in large part due to choking every other year. Your argument is completely countered by the Warriors 2016 season as a whole. People still hold Steph super high cause his REGULAR SEASON was so legendary but his playoff run was undeniably a train wreck and was arguably the biggest reason they lost. And you act like there aren’t playoff awards either. They have a finals and conference finals mvp now as well as plenty of other arbitrary all playoff team awards for example. The players that show out and play the best get rewarded so I don’t know why you have such an issue with it</p>

      <label for="llng770" class="commentText"><p>Umm, Chris Paul was Assists Leader 5x, Steals Leader 6x. Gary Payton was 0x and 1x respectively. Chris Paul has more All-NBA selections, All-Star selections, same All-Defense selections, better stats in every single stat category with less games played, etc.</p>

<p>Chris Paul is literally a better player than Gary Payton.</p>

<p>You act like I’m saying if anybody gets a ring he’s in the conversation. Chris Paul is <em>already</em> a Top 5 PG without the ring, Gary Payton wasn’t whether he got that ring or not. And I’m from Seattle born and raised by the way…</p>

<p>This is Chris Paul we’re talking about, the fuck? Point God.</p>

      <label for="llmy0nx" class="commentText"><p>Not crazy dude wasn’t healthy to start his career and took a while to reach his MVP peak. Then KD joins the Warriors which makes his numbers and impact less important as some others and he played less than 52 games in 2017-18. Recently he hasn’t been healthy and the Warriors have been bad. Plus the last two seasons I definitely wouldn’t take him over SGA or Luka</p>

<p>Westbrook was MVP in 16-17.</p>

<p>Dame had a crazy year in 17-18 and Steph was playing with KD and missed a lot of games.</p>

<p>For 2022, I’m not too sure about Booker but Luka was legit.</p>

<p><sup>23</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub> is fair as well. Shai and Luka are young and elite.</p>

      <label for="llnfqao" class="commentText"><p>He did stat pad this is a fact. Okc admitted they purposely made bigs block out and give Westbrook the rebound. And you can see clearly him hunting last assist or rebound on nights he didn’t have triple double even if it meant few more turnovers or open shots for opponents. Don’t know why people still try to deny he did in fact stat pad. I don’t even like Lebron but him in okc with same stat feeding mindset and system would have averaged gaudy triple double that is efficient</p>
