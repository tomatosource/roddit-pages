<p>All-NBA is a regular season award, and a guy playing 75-82 games at an 2nd/3rd team All-NBA level is typically more valuable for a regular season than a guy playing 55-65 games at a 1st team level.</p>

<p>If you just wanted them for a game, the guy at the 1st team level is better, but when someone has lays 75% of the season vs another that played 95% of the season, it is hard to say the player that missed 20% more games was more impactful unless they were notably better/above the other.</p>

He took a few years to get going and then really only played 4-5 &ldquo;full&rdquo; seasons at his peak.  Like one year he got 3rd team was only 51 games, another 2nd team 56 games - nobody deserves first team for that few games.  Last couple years he&rsquo;s trailed off a bit due to age and other guys at their peak have jumped him.</p>

<p>And in the end, it&rsquo;s not like Steph has totally dominated the guard spot for the last decade - as this list shows there&rsquo;s been a bunch of other MVP caliber players right there with him.</p>

<p>But I disagree with the idea that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not like Steph has totally dominated the guard spot for the last decade&rdquo;</p>

<p>Steph was definitely the best guard in the NBA for 9 straight seasons. From 2014 all the way to 2022. In none of those years was there a guard more impactful to winning than Steph so he dominated the position imo. There&rsquo;s a reason LeBron and Steph are considered the legends of that era.</p>

      <label for="llnghgb" class="commentText"><p>I think looking back in retrospect it&rsquo;s easy to see Curry was the most influential guard from 2014-2022 but it&rsquo;s not like people weren&rsquo;t still arguing there were better players then him during those years.</p>

<p>There was 100% a narrative going that Curry wasn&rsquo;t as good as he was made out to be after the 2016 loss and Kyrie definitely outplayed him in that series. They were also a generational 3 game choke job away from almost being taken out by Westbrook/Durant that year before even making it to the finals.</p>

<p>Harden was putting up even better numbers on offense while being a legit threat to the Warriors in the play-offs despite Warriors obviously being a WAY more stacked team.</p>

<p>The fact that Curry was frequently injured, missed a TON of regular season games and wasn&rsquo;t winning the FMVP awards over Durant during those years.</p>

<p>And then there&rsquo;s definitely always going to be a crowd that fully believe Curry was just a product of playing for an insanely stacked roster during every one of those years and wouldn&rsquo;t have had nearly the same reputation/impact if he spent his career somewhere like Portland or Minnesota.</p>

<p>Personally agree that Him and Lebron were obviously the 2 face&rsquo;s of the League during that time but also would say there is still a pretty huge gap between Lebron and Curry in terms of individual dominance/impact. Don&rsquo;t think Curry would have been capable of carrying a franchise like the Blazers to the finals if him and Dame&rsquo;s spots were reversed as an example, while I fully believe Lebron could have gotten just about any team in the League to the finals during that time period.</p>

<p>Dame got the blazers to the conference finals, you really think Curry wouldn&rsquo;t push them over the edge considering he&rsquo;s a better player than Dame by a sizeable amount?</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re also ignoring how if Curry played with the blazers or Minnesota, they would probably build a similar team and philosophy to what the Warriors did - play with pace, give him strong defenders, etc.</p>

<p>Golden state was pretty bad when Curry went there, but eventually things fell in place. I Don&rsquo;t see why that wouldn&rsquo;t happen in another team. </p>

<p>Do I think Steph could have beaten Dame/KD/Draymond/Klay/Iggy that year if him an Dame&rsquo;s roles were swapped? No</p>

<p>And Curry getting taken out of games by a hard focused defense was nothing out of the ordinary even during his absolute peak seasons, he wasn&rsquo;t as unstoppable of a scorer as I think people seem to make him out to be. He just always had solid teammates that could punish the defense when he wasn&rsquo;t dropping 30pts a game.</p>

<p>His shooting, unselfish attitude, and amazing off-ball movement might genuinely make him the best Co-Star to have in NBA history, but I don&rsquo;t think Curry would be capable of carrying the entire load of a teams offense near single handedly 75+ games a season + anchor it&rsquo;s defense the way some of the truly dominant players in NBA history were capable of doing.</p>

<p>Do you think KD played in that series? He missed all 4 games.</p>

<p>The Blazers led games 2, 3, and 4 by 15 points. All of those games were close. You wanna know what the difference was? Steph averaged 36.5 pts in that series while Dame averaged 23 pts.</p>

<p>And this is the 2019 Warriors we’re talking about. The one with no depth, KD taking a max slot but missing entire playoff series, and close games with Quinn Cook in the starting lineup.</p>

<p>Steph is 10-0 against Dame in the playoffs. Hasn’t ever lost a single game. Outplayed Dame in each and every single one of those. Even the Raptors used to take more games off LeBronto than Dame has managed.</p>

Having CJ as the second best player when your best player is an offensive first guard always meant the team was going to lose to an actual well constructed roster.

<p>The players that have led great playoff offenses and great playoff defenses while carrying their offense and defense, is maybe just bucks Kareem at his peak?</p>

<p>Guys like Lebron and MJ aren&rsquo;t quite defensive anchors like great defensive bigs are, and guys like Duncan, and Hakeem had pretty average playoff offenses when they won. Historically it&rsquo;s very rare for teams to win this way.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You can look at our playoff offensive rating when Curry was off the court from like 2014-2023, it&rsquo;s really bad. Curry&rsquo;s estimated shot creation for his teammates during his peak is at an all time level, a lot of the time his teammates were able punish defenses through advantages created from Curry.</p>

What do you think legacy is lol? It’s about how you’re remembered. People used to argue for individual seasons that TMac was better than Kobe but now that we watched their eras and careers unfold we can take the cumulative sum of things, assess their legacy and influence, and use greater context beyond that individual year to retroactively determine that Kobe was better than TMac even for that individual year where people in the moment were arguing otherwise.</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t agree with that - not only did Westbrook/Harden each win an MVP right in the middle of those 9 seasons, but Harden also finished (much) higher than Curry in MVP voting for 4 straight seasons from 16-17 until 19-20.</p>

<p>Curry was the best guard for the 3 years before Harden, then Harden was the best guard for those 4 years.  Curry took the crown back for a year in 20-21, and then it&rsquo;s been Luka since.</p>

<p>Curry has been right up there for those 9 years, but so were Harden, Westbrook, and to a lesser extent Lillard in that same time frame.</p>

      <label for="llnway2" class="commentText"><p>Even if you want to split hairs because Harden undoubtedly had better regular seasons than Steph.  It’s not exactly clear cut Steph was better in the playoffs.  I don’t think you can judge Harden dragging Eric Gordon and Clint Capela (with cp3 hurt) to a game 7 against the warriors against one of the most stacked teams of all time, fairly against the easy path Steph had.  No one is going to think that if they switched teams, Harden with klay dray and kd aren’t going to be overwhelming favorites against Steph, Gordon and capela.</p>

<p>If you look at their output in relation to their usage, Curry is clear from Westbrook and Harden.</p>

      <label for="lln9585" class="commentText"><p>Yeah this… Harden, Russ, AND Dame all had higher winshares and ws/48 in some seasons. Harden has a strong argument for being the best guard for multiple seasons throughout those 9 years.</p>

<p>Also team success is a huge factor. I guarantee if you swapped Steph and Harden’s teams, Harden would’ve had more success and accolades. I guarantee if Steph and Dame swapped, that warriors team would be hands down better than the blazers team. And higher seed= more likely to win mvp.</p>

<p>Then he made it once with KD, got injured for a season, then KD left and his scoring bounced back up to 32ppg and he made it again. Then Luka arrives and Steph’s also battling against injuries and team record.</p>

<p>I’ll always contend that Steph could have had a chance at being considered a top 5 player of all time had KD not joined the Warriors right as he was in his prime. Both players played a rung below their peak capacity and basically faced fewer challenges thanks to that move.</p>

      <label for="llnigo9" class="commentText"><p>Lmao this is such a Reddit-pilled take it’s not even funny. Those championships are the reason Steph and KD are ranked as high as they are in the first place. Winning in this league has always come with a sacrifice; whether it’s stats or accolades or whatever. That doesn’t mean it’s not worth it. These hypothetical stats and all-NBA accolades will all get forgotten in favor of the actual winning. The reality is that Steph is considered by many to be a top 10 player ever thanks to the two championships that KD helped him win and KD is saved from being considered a glorified Carmelo Anthony thanks to the two championships that Steph helped him win.</p>

<p>At no point in NBA history has winning a championship lowered anyone’s stock just because it stopped them from accumulating higher stats, and the same would happen here no matter how much this sub wants to bitch and cry and moan about it. You already see how much of a coronation these Olympics were for Lebron, Steph, and KD and NO ONE ELSE. Why’s that? Hint: it’s not because of all the All-NBA first teams they made. It’s because of all the rings. It’s always about the rings.</p>

<p>Go ask Dwayne Wade if would trade his 2 championships he won with LeBron for more statistically dominant seasons. Go ask Kobe Bryant if he would trade his 3 championships he won with Shaq. Better yet, let’s go ask Russell Westbrook and James Harden if they would’ve traded their cute little MVP race in 2017 for being the Robin to KD’s Batman in an actual championship win that year(god knows they’ve tried in the past, only Steph actually managed to succeed). Something tells me they’d trade all their MVPs and first team all NBAs and all their scoring titles just to go win a ring as the second fiddle to KD.</p>

<p>Imagine if Chuck had the rings that Shaq had, the conversations u don&rsquo;t have about where they place on the all time list would retain but for the opposite reasons.</p>

<p>League and all timer lists got saved by GSW injuries in the Raptors year. KD and Steph would easily jump a few ranks with KD&rsquo;s 3rd / Steph&rsquo;s 5th.</p>

<p><strong>Player 1:</strong> 36/7/9 per 100 possessions on 60 TS in 2200 minutes. When player 1 was on the floor, their team had a +10 net rating. Off the floor the team had a +0 net rating.</p>

After that, they coast a bit more in the regular season and keep it for the playoffs. Especially when you have KD on the team. It&rsquo;s crazy that the NBA is so post season heavy while having all these awards just being for the regular season.</p>

      <label for="llnao4l" class="commentText"><p>No it shouldn’t because the postseason is an uneven playing field and you’re only saying that because it supports your argument and Curry would get an extra 10-20 games on all of his competition. Every team has 82 game schedules and every team plays against each other. I’m not saying it’s Currys fault for not giving it 100% for all 82 games but you can’t hold it against guys like Dame, Westbrook or Booker who did. There’s plenty of examples of players going just as hard in the regular season no matter the circumstances (look at Curry and the Warriors in 2016).</p>

      <label for="llncwcy" class="commentText"><p>Yes. But that was in 2016 after they won their first title. It&rsquo;s a lot to expect them to do it every year when they were playing 20-25 more games than everyone else. I agree it&rsquo;s an even playing field. Which is why it&rsquo;s a regular season award. That&rsquo;s not in question. The issue is that all these teams make the playoffs and have to play a ton more games to win it all. And they&rsquo;re all being ignored. Meanwhile, no one remembers who the top seed was in 2022. Or 2020. They just remember who won it all. And that&rsquo;s all thrown out the window with these awards. IOW - The regular season isn&rsquo;t important yet 95% of the awards are for the regular season.</p>

      <label for="llnfkzc" class="commentText"><p>Your statement is so dumb I don’t even want to respond to it but I feel obliged to. There’s countless examples of players who make deep playoff runs and are fully capable of being All-NBA first team every season regardless. I’m not holding it against Steph but you can’t act like it’s impossible for him to do when he still gets 2-3 months off every offseason.</p>

<p>As for the regular season you are grossly wrong about peoples impressions on it. People absolutely remember regular season results because that’s how we evaluate their postseason performance. The Suns are still 100% looked at as chokers cause of 2022. The Bucks get cut some slack cause they won in 2021 but a lot of people think they fluked that title thanks in large part due to choking every other year. Your argument is completely countered by the Warriors 2016 season as a whole. People still hold Steph super high cause his REGULAR SEASON was so legendary but his playoff run was undeniably a train wreck and was arguably the biggest reason they lost. And you act like there aren’t playoff awards either. They have a finals and conference finals mvp now as well as plenty of other arbitrary all playoff team awards for example. The players that show out and play the best get rewarded so I don’t know why you have such an issue with it</p>

      <label for="llnyfaf" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t have a huge issue with it. I&rsquo;m just making a point. The NBA regular season is one of the least important ones of any sport. The Atlanta Hawks made the post season last year yet they were 36-46. That doesn&rsquo;t mean the regular season doesn&rsquo;t matter but your best case for it was to hold it against teams that choke. And I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s impossible for Steph to do it but why bother? They were the 3rd seed in the West in 2022 and still won it all. For veteran teams, the only thing that matters is staying healthy and playing your best basketball going into the playoffs. Again. I don&rsquo;t really care. But it&rsquo;s unfortunate when you have MVP and 1st team awards going to players that weren&rsquo;t the best players that full year. Just the regular season. It&rsquo;s the same reason everyone knows Shaq west the best player in the NBA for almost a decade and won 1 MVP award. I understand it but it&rsquo;s a bit weird.</p>

      <label for="llomc55" class="commentText"><p>The NBA regular season is incredibly important what are you talking about. Just because Atlanta snuck in to the 10th seed doesn’t mean that it isn’t. 66.7% of NBA champs have been 1 seeds with the 2 seed making up 20.5% and the 3 seed making up 10.2%. Other than that there’s been 2 champions who have been another seed in the history of the league. Just because teams like the Heat have been able to make miracle runs doesn’t mean the regular season isn’t a phenomenal indicator for future success as the NBA has arguably the strongest home court advantage of the major sports</p>

      <label for="llotkxz" class="commentText"><p>But you&rsquo;re only using champions as a metric. In 2023, the Heat made it to the NBA Finals. They were the 8th seed. The Lakers made it to the West Coast Finals. They were also a play in team. And every season you have at least 2-3 higher seeds losing in the first round. Yes. The best teams usually win it all and they usually have higher seeds but all these teams still have a chance to make a run. Compared to every other major sport not making the post season at all. Why do you think they created the IST. Because they&rsquo;re trying to make the regular season matter.</p>

He’s already a Top 5 PG by most accounts, a ring absolutely throws him in the Top 3 instantly. It’s the one thing he’s missing in his great career (a pretty big thing, mind you).</p>

<p>Chris Paul is literally a better player than Gary Payton.</p>

<p>You act like I’m saying if anybody gets a ring he’s in the conversation. Chris Paul is <em>already</em> a Top 5 PG without the ring, Gary Payton wasn’t whether he got that ring or not. And I’m from Seattle born and raised by the way…</p>

<p>Oh my god, this just explains the entire discussion. You don’t even watch basketball?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nba.com/news/the-chris-paul-effect-franchise-record-wins-follow-wherever-he-plays" target="_blank">https://www.nba.com/news/the-chris-paul-effect-franchise-record-wins-follow-wherever-he-plays</a></p>

<p>The Suns were 34-39 before CP3, and they went 51-21 and 63-17 with him.</p>

<p>The Clippers were 32-50 before CP3, and they went 40-26, 56-26, and 57-25 with him.</p>

<p>The Hornets were 18-64 before CP3, and they went 38-44, 39-43, and 56-26 with him.</p>

<p>CP3 regularly turns lottery teams into playoff contenders. And he has a developing superstar and the greatest coach of all-time with him now. Of all the people you could ever doubt to turn a lottery team into a contender…you doubt CHRIS PAUL? The guy who’s done it more than anyone else in history?</p>

<p>This Reddit is just pathetic. You guys talk about something you don’t even like to watch. WTF?</p>

<p>Also, your take about rings only matter if you’re the #1 best player is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. You clearly have no idea what a floor general is, and not to mention how many iconic duos in NBA history exist. I’m not even gonna begin to address that garbage take. Wow.</p>

Once he wins an MVP and a Finals MVP, Curry will just be relegated to a shooter just a step above Ray Allen. All this top 2 PG and top 10 all time is just recency bias and will fade in 5 years time.</p>

Curry was pretty much unanimously the best PG from 2014-2015 until the 2021-2022 season and he still arguably had the title that year as well after winning the championship + finals mvp. After that the title passes to Luka.</p>

Besides a few younger guards, he&rsquo;s only lost out on first team to other Top 75 players in their career defining seasons. Yet, he&rsquo;s made All-NBA in general more than any of those other guards mentioned. Sorry but I don&rsquo;t think we can point to any one of those years, compare stats, win shares and team records, and say Steph was undoubtedly shafted.</p>

      <label for="lloob4w" class="commentText"><p>Ya still care about this nonsense?</p>

<p>All NBA first team doesn&rsquo;t mean shit - opinion based</p>

<p>MVP doesn&rsquo;t mean shit - opinion based, filled with personal bias by voters, and also money driven</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stats&rdquo; don&rsquo;t mean shit because it can&rsquo;t capture a players entire game (although AI might figure it out one day). Too much gets left out in the game. The best example I always use is if you put MJ and KD on the same court and everyone jumps on MJ to leave KD open time and time again, KD WILL out do MJ in stats&hellip;. but not a single person on the planet will think KD is better than MJ. There&rsquo;s a reason MJ is getting jumped in the first place and it WONT appear on a stat sheet. We saw a literal example of this with Steph Curry and KD.</p>

<p>Ya need to take a step back from a lot of these numbers that will point you in the wrong direction as to who the BEST is and actually watch and ENJOY the games and the best players will be clear.</p>

      <label for="llnwmcb" class="commentText"><p>Just shows that awards and titles need context. There is just so many you can give in a single year and some time narratives play a big role.</p>

<p>Curry is without a doubt the best guard and arguably player in the past 10 years and yet many people will see his All Nba First team awards and will say that some like Luka or Harden had better career or bigger impact.</p>

<p>Personally I think that 2017 was purely Media narrative because of Harden and Westbrook. Curry was without a doubt a better player than them and in 2022 Booker got it on a 50-50 call. All other years Steph missed some time and last season he wasn&rsquo;t as good as Shai or Luka</p>

And you can see clearly him hunting last assist or rebound on nights he didn’t have triple double even if it meant few more turnovers or open shots for opponents. Don’t know why people still try to deny he did in fact stat pad. I don’t even like Lebron but him in okc with same stat feeding mindset and system would have averaged gaudy triple double that is efficient</p>

      <label for="llnwzao" class="commentText"><p>You’re the one that gave klay example lol how dense are you to compare that to Westbrook hunting rebound assists and bigs literally spoonfeed rebounds. If you can’t tell the difference between two I can’t help you. Moron brings spot up shot as comparison then acts surprised. Getting a good jump shooter an open spot up shot is every single teams strategy because that is how you increase your chance of winning. Having your centers spoonfeed rebounds has never been done before until okc because it’s simply better for bigs to rebounds and outlet to an already running guard. You dumb thunder fans really can’t understand that difference. No other team is spoonfeeding their point guard a rebound no matter how athletic and fast they are.</p>

Lmao heard this bogus win rate argument for YEARS. Doesn’t change the fact that he stat padded it’s a fact. Stop getting in your feels and just look at fact. Stat padding with Uber athletic Westbrook led to winning above bad teams in regular season and lost in first round against good teams that just let Westbrook be inefficient while chasing triple double. So tired of same old defense</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m taking prime curry over Westbrook <sup>100</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> times a Cinderella regular season run isn&rsquo;t moving me</p>

      <label for="llny4r2" class="commentText"><p>Oh please. Wiggins, klay, poole, and draymond were all very productive in the postseason. Westbrook delivered in the playoffs, they won his minutes by a large margin. Its not his fault okc was outscored by 50 when he was on the bench.</p>

<p>And prime westbrook was bouncing the 67 win spurs in the playoffs and almost dusting the 73 win warriors. Prime westbrook absolutely clears curry.</p>

<p>Im taking prime westbrook over curry <sup>100</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> times. A few participation trophy rings against injured teams while having the most artificially stacked team of all time doesnt move me.</p>
