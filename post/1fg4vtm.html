</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I&rsquo;ve seen this many times from multiple reputable sources that McHale had a monstrous wingspan of 8ft but even though he was long I&rsquo;ve seen multiple pictures that don&rsquo;t support him having a wingspan of 8ft.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuArvpI6YsCXd1KEv79wJEkj_bfxMbLMuuDDh1OSGdQp-u2Z28s1uSvivk7ieNpjakO5S_YQ5huhGhNseNNGIEnsDeN1EShK8xt92BuRgHPyR7nK8nxHi0pA0HxrLsBOWA2SaVvAXqAjo/s640/McHale.jpg" target="_blank">Next to Parish</a> Here he is next to Parish (who apparently visibly has a similar wingspan, probably not 8 ft though), note how far his finger tips end relative to his knees.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of <a href="https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/3/1-kawhi-leonard-ron-turenne.jpg" target="_blank">Kawhi</a>, who notoriously has a long wingspan and look how much closer his fingertip end up next to his knees.</p>

<p>A better example is <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FAj6zKmVEAAn_me.jpg" target="_blank">Anthony Davis</a> who is a similar height with a 7ft6 wingspan, and even his arms look longer.</p>

<p>Finally another picture of <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/0b/18/65/0b1865df26c3f5935e80cfc85d3264d3.jpg" target="_blank">Kevin McHale</a>.</p>

<p>I understand they have different body proportions from torso/leg length and the tucked in shirt/high shorts make McHale&rsquo;s legs look even longer. But no one is convincing me McHale has a legit 8 ft wingspan, based purely off these pics I remain unconvinced, what do you guys think?</p>

      <label for="lmzk8qg" class="commentText"><p>Players used to embellish and manipulate their physical traits all the time back then, hell even some still do it as recently as just a few years ago.</p>

<p>KD was listed at and told everyone he was 6’9 for years out of fear he’d be used more like a center rather than a scoring wing. Then the viral pic of him standing directly next to Demarcus Cousins at a team USA practice came out and it became a lot harder to deny the fact that he was at the very least 6’11.</p>

<p>Same thing with Kevin Love. Love’s height was listed at 6’10 in his college and early NBA days because he wanted to be a stretch rebounding PF/C and not a SF. When in reality his height is more 6’7ish.</p>

<p>Manipulating these things are much much harder to do nowadays and on top of it just plain useless because there isn’t the positional and height biases in the league anymore like there was a decade or so ago. A guy who is 6’4 can be a PF, a player who is 6’10 can be a PG, it doesn’t matter what your height or physical traits are.</p>

      <label for="lmzou46" class="commentText"><p>googling &ldquo;[player name] wingspan&rdquo; will give you the wrong answer more often than the right one. unfortunately, a bunch of articles in recent years ran with that 8&rsquo;0 number even though it&rsquo;s very visibly not accurate.</p>

<p>The only player I can think of that was 6&rsquo;9-6&rsquo;10 in height with north of a 7&rsquo;6 wingspan would be Bismack Biyombo (6&rsquo;9, 7&rsquo;6 or 7&rsquo;7 wingspan depending on the source) and just by looking at the two you can tell McHale definitely doesn&rsquo;t have 6 extra inches of wingspan on him.</p>

<p>McHale is definitely up there but it&rsquo;s not quite 8&rsquo;0 for sure. Wemby&rsquo;s wingspan is 8&rsquo;0</p>

      <label for="lmznugo" class="commentText"><p>McHale also looks to be a step ahead of where Parish is, not right next to him, so if their arms look the same length that would make McHale&rsquo;s a bit longer.

      <label for="lmzoxny" class="commentText"><p>I doubt it was 8 feet but you cant really do much with this analysis. First off, in the first pic he&rsquo;s ahead of Parish and his arms are bent. But more importantly, people&rsquo;s knees, hips, torsos, etc. arent all the same proportion, so you cant really compare things like distance from the knee.</p>

      <label for="lmzqn8a" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think he had a 8 ft wingspan either.  Best guess is probably north of 7’6, 7’8 possibly? How his shoulders are built and arm joint inserted to them also play a role.  I’m sure it helps his standing reach as well.  Using those pictures is incomplete analysis - for example kawhi is just a smaller person.  Look how big the ball is compared to his body. Parish is also another guy with freakish wingspan.  Doesn’t really help your case to compare them.</p>
