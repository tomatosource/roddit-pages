      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dgedvl/jayson_tatum_is_doing_a_lot_of_things_well_but_he/"><p>Jayson Tatum is doing a lot of things well, but he isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;sacrificing&rdquo; his scoring numbers for the team, he has 15 more FG attempts than any other Celtic, in <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> games has taken the most shots out of any Celtic and once took the most shots out of anyone on the court.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>He really is playmaking, rebounding and playing defense really well in the finals, but the narrative that he&rsquo;s just doing whatever the team needs from him isn&rsquo;t exactly true, he&rsquo;s trying to be the leading offensive force for his team, but the shots just aren&rsquo;t falling for him.</p>

<p>He is currently averaging 20 points on 36.5% shooting. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/4065648/jayson-tatum" target="_blank">Jayson Tatum 2023-24 Stats per Game - NBA - ESPN</a> That&rsquo;s his worst FG % in any playoff series he&rsquo;s ever played, just 0.2 % lower than his second worst, which was against the warriors in the 2022 finals.</p>

      <label for="l8pjbad" class="commentText"><p>i agree he needs to lose a bit weight. But yesterday i was reading comments (all of them upvoted to hell) how lukas style will never win a ring. Like bro you are watching his team play in the finals right now. Are you telling me his style of play is good enough to win three series in a row and then it stops working in the fourth? Mavs just ran into a superior team, they will be back in the next few years for sure.</p>

      <label for="l8pmkak" class="commentText"><p>Mavs are also shooting 30-51 (26-39 on 2s, 67%) with Tatum as the primary defender: I’ll just leave it here for “good defense” part.</p>

<p>Here is how Mavs are shooting against the other Cs:</p>

<p>Brown: 17-32 (14-23 on 2s, 61%)</p>

<p>Jrue: 27-46 (23-35 on 2s, 66%)</p>

<p>White: 26-53 (23-47 on 2s - absolutely freaking elite 49%)</p>

<p>Horford: 20-52 (16-34 on 2s - also absolutely freaking elite, 47%)</p>

<p>KP: 13-32 (8-16 on 2s - elite 50%, but small sample as only 2 games)</p>

<p>PP: 6-23 (5-17 on 2s for absolutely crazy 29%, including even holding Doncic to 2-7)</p>

<p>Hauser: 12-25 (11-18 on 2s for 61%).</p>

<p>So Tatum is actually posting the worst defensive shooting % among the top-8 Celtics rotation players: White, Horford, KP and surprisingly PP have been the back bone of Boston’s heavy 1v1 defense.</p>

<p>Yes, his playmaking has been excellent and he has been absolutely pivotal to holding down the rebounding for Celtics (outside of Game 4) vs Mavs bigs, but his scoring and his defense have been below average.</p>
