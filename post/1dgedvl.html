      <p>He really is playmaking, rebounding and playing defense really well in the finals, but the narrative that he&rsquo;s just doing whatever the team needs from him isn&rsquo;t exactly true, he&rsquo;s trying to be the leading offensive force for his team, but the shots just aren&rsquo;t falling for him.</p>

<p>He is currently averaging 20 points on 36.5% shooting. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/4065648/jayson-tatum" target="_blank">Jayson Tatum 2023-24 Stats per Game - NBA - ESPN</a> That&rsquo;s his worst FG % in any playoff series he&rsquo;s ever played, just 0.2 % lower than his second worst, which was against the warriors in the 2022 finals.</p>

He isn’t playing that well offensively but because people shit on him so much, his fans have to go out of their way to defend his play (which I agree has been pretty good otherwise).</p>

      <label for="l8qdjrc" class="commentText"><p>Hes just not playing to the top 5 MVP expectations people put on him. What makes this interesting to me is that he hasn&rsquo;t had an &ldquo;iconic&rdquo; game this entire run making it very unmemorable to fans and the media. And further than that, he doesn&rsquo;t even have to force himself in the clutch with this team, which is where his biggest flaws show mostly, leaving everybody confused as to why they&rsquo;re disappointed in him despite him playing &ldquo;well&rdquo; all around.</p>

<p>I would say a lot of it is the highlight culture of the NBA that makes people disappointed because Tatum hasn&rsquo;t produced a 15 second clip this run that can be sent and resent for the rest of time, and instead he&rsquo;s doing good enough to win with this great team but the argument that these performances wouldnt fly as the number 1 option with with any other team make it hard to dispute.</p>

<p>If anything im interested to see, if boston end up champions, how this run will be looked back at in the future.</p>

      <label for="l8qfnn8" class="commentText"><p>it’s bc NBA fans have this dumb idea that your best player <em>has</em> to be this overwhelmingly dominant scorer that carries his team offensively by dropping 30-40 points every night. they want Tatum to be something that he’s not instead of understanding and appreciating who he is</p>

<p>Tatum is certainly a far more capable scorer than he’s shown this postseason but I think you could make a reasonable argument that he’s not even a top 10 pure scorer in the league rn. he’s a very good to great scorer, but he’s not elite. the crux of his value is not his scoring, it’s his versatility on both ends of the floor</p>

<p>I genuinely think it’s hard to know what to make of it when a team comes along and doesn’t fit the mood of how the game has been played for so long now.</p>

<p>The true team basketball we’re playing is not typical in this league. “Mazzula-ball” is a new way to think of the game, and ppl don’t like change lol. An easy example is the resistance among many about excessive and deep three point shooting in the golden state rise to dominance.</p>

      <label for="l8qknur" class="commentText"><p>I think the Celtics are also a bit more reliant on Tatum than you think. obviously he doesn’t “hard carry” us but for years our team has fallen off a cliff whenever Tatum goes to the bench, that only really changed this year bc the addition of Porzingis drastically improved the Brown on/Tatum off lineups. but without Porzingis in the playoffs it’s been more of the same, our offense just tanks when he sits. in the playoffs we’ve been very reliant on his ball-handling, gravity and ability to collapse the defense</p>

<p>Regular Season: 121.7 offensive rating ON, 120.0 offensive rating OFF (+1.7)</p>

      <label for="l8qpg2v" class="commentText"><p>Many people genuinely don’t understand this, and I personally think it’s bc our team ball doesn’t look like how nba teams typically function on the court nowadays. Those of us who have been watching this team and the ins and outs understand that the team literally can’t do a god damn thing without that guy lol, but I can also understand how - if you’re looking for the things that you see stars on other teams doing on the court - you’d easily fail to recognize the significance of Tatum’s impact.</p>

      <label for="l8qqz74" class="commentText"><p>Because that is what the best players do. It is very clear with the Mavs- if Luka isn&rsquo;t playing like a beast they have no chance.</p>

<p>Luka hasn&rsquo;t even had a huge game yet and he&rsquo;s shooting 10% better from the field than Tatum and scoring almost 10ppg more but his team is down 3-1.</p>

<p>This Luka-Tatum duel also nicely shows how basketball is a team sport but you can&rsquo;t be hailed as the best player when you&rsquo;re not performing like one.</p>

      <label for="l8qvvay" class="commentText"><p>again, you’re expecting Tatum to be something that he is not. he’s obviously capable of going for 40-50 on any given night but in general he’s a volume scorer with pretty average efficiency</p>

<p>the intrinsic value of Tatum is that we don’t need him to score a ton every night bc he’s a far more versatile player than that and we’ve built our team in a way that spreads out the scoring burden. if Tatum isn’t being amazing as a scorer, that’s not necessarily a disaster for us. he can still dominate the defensive glass, he can still guard 1-5, he can still provide some weakside rim protection, he can still collapse the defense by getting into the paint, he can still be used as a screener or a handler in PnR, he can still be used as a shooter or cutter off-ball</p>

<p>you mention the Mavs always get wrecked if Luka isn’t beasting as a scorer and the Celtics can win even if Tatum isn’t beasting as a scorer. obviously Boston has a better team but maybe that’s also a reflection of the fact that Tatum is simply a more multidimensional player than Luka is. if Luka isn’t scoring, what does he give you aside from on-ball playmaking? he’s not an especially good player offensively when he’s not on the ball, he’s not really a great screener or catch-and-shoot guy, and we’ve seen very clearly in this series that he’s a defensive liability more often than not</p>

      <label for="l8qoq3k" class="commentText"><p>I hear you. It’s literally impossible to ever have a reasonable discussion about him, because so many people are salivating to shit on him (above and beyond deserved criticism/goofing) so it causes ppl to get defensive of him and not admit anything he’s doing wrong.</p>

<p>(Disregarding last night, bc that game was a total clusterfuck all around lol): he isn’t shooting well at all (like, bad bad), but he’s doing pretty much everything else - including all the dirty work that many superstars don’t do on the court on a consistent basis - at an extremely high level rn.</p>

<p>Both things can be true! (This is a good mantra for all y’all who clearly struggle with black and white thinking lol).</p>

There&rsquo;s a reason his efficiency tanks every year in the playoffs. Just like Paul George, his game his entirely predicated on his jumpshot falling. That&rsquo;s why he is inconsistent. He can&rsquo;t generate efficient shots in the midrange or at the rim because he likes to fadeaway from contact instead of going through it.</p>

How often his mid to short range shots would just be nowhere near going in was odd to see for a player of his caliber, if teams could contest his 3s well and sell out to stop his drives he had no answers. Jaylen Brown is a bull driving to the rim, you can sell out to stop his drives as hard as you want but he&rsquo;ll still force his way into some easy shots</p>

<p>Yeah, some might get exposed in the playoffs, but only at the very top level. Still, some manage to win it all (Steph, Jokic). You can&rsquo;t tell me someone like Jrue would have been better than prime Harden on the Rockets or Dame on the blazers.</p>

<p>CP3, Stockton, Embiid are better defenders than their counterparts, but also equally good on offense, if not at least in different areas. Which would mean their defensive abilities outweigh their offensive inadequacies when compared to the other players which is why you&rsquo;d rank them higher (according to what that guy is trying to say anyways).</p>

<p>KP: 13-32 (8-16 on 2s - elite 50%, but small sample as only 2 games)</p>

<p>PP: 6-23 (5-17 on 2s for absolutely crazy 29%, including even holding Doncic to 2-7, would have never expected that to happen, but the little guy goes to war any time the player he guards gets the ball)</p>

<p>Hauser: 12-25 (11-18 on 2s for 61%).</p>

<p>So Tatum is actually posting the worst defensive shooting % among the top-8 Celtics rotation players: White, Horford, KP and surprisingly PP have been the back bone of Boston’s heavy 1v1 defense.</p>

<p>I never thought Tatum was this secret Draymond Green level defender like people have been insinuating since his offensive struggles, but this kind of just showcases why DFG% isn’t a good stat.</p>

<p>His defense has been great and obviously better than Payton Pritchard lol.</p>

      <label for="l8px64g" class="commentText"><p>I naturally would pay less attention to this stat as teams usually send doubles on the best players (your own team doubled both Luka and Kyrie quite often), but Celtics are playing straight up 1v1 defense: if a player gets beaten, there is a much higher chance the guy will just score a basket as help will arrive late. Doncic has been going by Tatum pretty much freely in Games 3 and 4 and Kyrie joined him in Game 4.</p>

      <label for="l8qexka" class="commentText"><p>I mean any Celtic fan would tell you that Tatums not the greatest iso defender, but there’s a lot more to defending than just manning up in iso. Especially when his primary matchup is a center. Celtics are just conceding that either the Mavs can get him on a size mismatch or a Luka mismatch but that’s still a lot better than playing drop against that pnr. Like not saying his defense couldn’t be better this series, especially against Luka it could be. But a lot of those stats are just scheme related.</p>

      <label for="l8q94tq" class="commentText"><p>You can see his frustration level increase every time he drives and pushes off to get separation but doesn&rsquo;t get enough separation. He tries to use his physicality to win, and when equal physicality is returned he legit gets mad during the play and forces something bad. This happened almost every drive attempt last night. He wants to be &ldquo;the guy&rdquo; so bad, but honestly doesn&rsquo;t have quite the iso talent as some others. That said, he is good to great at about everything else.</p>

If they win game 5 and go 4-1 it’ll never reflect the anxiety I’ve been having since game one</p>

      <label for="l8q827j" class="commentText"><p>Game 4 is Tatum’s worst game so far in these finals because his playmaking, defense, and rebounding was much worse than in previous games in the series. It was hilarious to hear Stephen A. Smith say that Tatum was the only one who showed up and was carrying in the half time show but would not hesitate from criticizing Tatum in games 1 and 2.</p>

<p>Casuals care too much about scoring in a vacuum and not about playing winning basketball. It is not just about FGA in a vacuum, it is very clear that Tatum was able to facilitate and involve his teammates better in games 1-3. The fact that he shot the most often is a mere byproduct of being the teams number one option with the highest usage rate on the team.</p>

      <label for="l8pw8t6" class="commentText"><p>Sacrificing for the team can have other connotations besides  &ldquo;shooting less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tatum is a small forward who has been guarding the opposing center for most of his time on the court. He is giving up size and strength and expending tons of energy when battling down low with Gafford and Lively.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reason guys like LeBron and Carmelo complained even when asked to guard power forwards for most of their careers &ndash; it sucks. Tatum taking on that role is sacrificing for the team.</p>

<p>He’s been ass but he’s winning so , if brown doesn’t go hero mode it’s tied <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> with Boston having a much better team. Luka isn’t playing amazing but we know he’s injured. Honestly this is making him look worse cos I partly excused 22 finskd as due to injury but he’s doing the same shit n this Mavs defence isn’t anywhere near as good</p>

      <label for="l8qm59j" class="commentText"><p>Nobody (with a brain) is saying he&rsquo;s sacrificing his scoring, we know he is shooting horribly. We&rsquo;re saying his bad shooting isn&rsquo;t detrimental because he&rsquo;s still arguably the best defender in the court and Boston&rsquo;s best playmaker. If those 2 things weren&rsquo;t there you&rsquo;d rightfully be able to say he is getting carried.</p>
