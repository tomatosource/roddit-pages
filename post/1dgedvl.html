      <p>He really is playmaking, rebounding and playing defense really well in the finals, but the narrative that he&rsquo;s just doing whatever the team needs from him isn&rsquo;t exactly true, he&rsquo;s trying to be the leading offensive force for his team, but the shots just aren&rsquo;t falling for him.</p>

<p>He is currently averaging 20 points on 36.5% shooting. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/4065648/jayson-tatum" target="_blank">Jayson Tatum 2023-24 Stats per Game - NBA - ESPN</a> That&rsquo;s his worst FG % in any playoff series he&rsquo;s ever played, just 0.2 % lower than his second worst, which was against the warriors in the 2022 finals.</p>

      <label for="l8pnyen" class="commentText"><p>The Tatum discussion just isn’t reasonable on this sub because he’s so polarizing. He isn’t playing that well offensively but because people shit on him so much, his fans have to go out of their way to defend his play (which I agree has been pretty good otherwise).</p>

      <label for="l8qdjrc" class="commentText"><p>Hes just not playing to the top 5 MVP expectations people put on him. What makes this interesting to me is that he hasn&rsquo;t had an &ldquo;iconic&rdquo; game this entire run making it very unmemorable to fans and the media. And further than that, he doesn&rsquo;t even have to force himself in the clutch with this team, which is where his biggest flaws show mostly, leaving everybody confused as to why they&rsquo;re disappointed in him despite him playing &ldquo;well&rdquo; all around.</p>

<p>I would say a lot of it is the highlight culture of the NBA that makes people disappointed because Tatum hasn&rsquo;t produced a 15 second clip this run that can be sent and resent for the rest of time, and instead he&rsquo;s doing good enough to win with this great team but the argument that these performances wouldnt fly as the number 1 option with with any other team make it hard to dispute.</p>

<p>If anything im interested to see, if boston end up champions, how this run will be looked back at in the future.</p>

<p>“Luka and Kyrie are the greatest backcourt ever</p>

<p>Can you point to an instance where anyone said that?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard anything but &ldquo;The greatest (or usually even only most talented/gifted) <em>offensive</em> backcourt ever&rdquo;, which is a <em>massive</em> difference, even if it is only one additional word.</p>

<p>They sure have their flaws at the defensive end, but you&rsquo;d be hard pressed to find many guard duos that are better on the other end (being a Mavs fan I&rsquo;d say Steph and Klay in their prime were better due to their ridiculously OP shooting, but probably still less talented all &ldquo;around&rdquo; - e.g. Irving is a much better finisher in the paint than Klay ever was).</p>

<p>Tatum is certainly a far more capable scorer than he’s shown this postseason but I think you could make a reasonable argument that he’s not even a top 10 pure scorer in the league rn. he’s a very good to great scorer, but he’s not elite. the crux of his value is not his scoring, it’s his versatility on both ends of the floor</p>

      <label for="l8qiuek" class="commentText"><p>It’s just very unusual for title teams, and especially what is likely an all time, to just never really rely on their best player to hard carry them. Celtics are the least star reliant all time team I’ve ever seen(I don’t rate the 14 spurs in that tier).</p>

<p>Just really unusual and sort of hard to come to terms with.</p>

      <label for="l8qknur" class="commentText"><p>I think the Celtics are also a bit more reliant on Tatum than you think. obviously he doesn’t “hard carry” us but for years our team has fallen off a cliff whenever Tatum goes to the bench, that only really changed this year bc the addition of Porzingis drastically improved the Brown on/Tatum off lineups. but without Porzingis in the playoffs it’s been more of the same, our offense just tanks when he sits. in the playoffs we’ve been very reliant on his ball-handling, gravity and ability to collapse the defense</p>

<p>but if you have watched Celtics basketball and looked at the on-off stats over the past few seasons, it’s obvious that our offense in fact does rely a lot on Tatum’s presence, even if he’s not putting up 30 points and 10 assists on great efficiency every night</p>

      <label for="l8qqz74" class="commentText"><p>Because that is what the best players do. It is very clear with the Mavs- if Luka isn&rsquo;t playing like a beast they have no chance.</p>

<p>Luka hasn&rsquo;t even had a huge game yet and he&rsquo;s shooting 10% better from the field than Tatum and scoring almost 10ppg more but his team is down 3-1.</p>

<p>This Luka-Tatum duel also nicely shows how basketball is a team sport but you can&rsquo;t be hailed as the best player when you&rsquo;re not performing like one.</p>

It’s literally impossible to ever have a reasonable discussion about him, because so many people are salivating to shit on him (above and beyond deserved criticism/goofing) so it causes ppl to get defensive of him and not admit anything he’s doing wrong.</p>

<p>(Disregarding last night, bc that game was a total clusterfuck all around lol): he isn’t shooting well at all (like, bad bad), but he’s doing pretty much everything else - including all the dirty work that many superstars don’t do on the court on a consistent basis - at an extremely high level rn.</p>

<p>Both things can be true! (This is a good mantra for all y’all who clearly struggle with black and white thinking lol).</p>

      <label for="l8rh389" class="commentText"><p>Fwiw, according to bbref these numbers aren&rsquo;t accurate.  He has 13 more FG attempts than any other Celtic.  So basically 3 more per game, which is a bit low for your offensive star.  It&rsquo;s one attempt less per game than regular season for him and about 5 attempts less per game than last round.  I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s sacrificing a lot, but people just say whatever shit confirms their previously existing bias.   He&rsquo;s done a pretty good job of making plays for others in my opinion.  It shows in his assist numbers.</p>

      <label for="l8rh0gk" class="commentText"><p>I keep coming back to this line of thinking. Truthfully, not as a way to take anything away from Tatum. He plays his role incredibly well and not every player with his talent could/ would be willing to do what he does. He doesn&rsquo;t control the game like a Luka, because during his entire career he hasn&rsquo;t had to, does it need to, and honestly shouldn&rsquo;t because I think he&rsquo;s doing exactly what he should do.</p>

<p>While trying not to take away anything from him, this thought process is why it is conceivable not to give him the same credit as other top offensive engines. If you swap Tatum with any number of 1st option(guards/wings);around the league, how many of those teams get &ldquo;significantly&rdquo; better while the Celtics get &ldquo;significantly&rdquo; worse? Swap him with SGA, Giannis, Donovan, Mitchell, Booker, Luka etc&hellip; I can easily see the Celtics being about the same or better. But I can see the other teams being about the same or potentially worse.</p>

<p>And all of that is ok. It&rsquo;s just giving perspective on what each player can do and what they&rsquo;ve been asked to do throughout their individual careers based on the rosters they&rsquo;ve been surrounded by. I honestly don&rsquo;t care for Devin Booker, but his first 6-7 years are completely different than Tatum/ browns. First 6-7 years in the league in terms of teammates. It&rsquo;s very understandable the habits that they picked up because of that.</p>

<p>Another obvious example is the credit that LeBron gets for the championship in Cleveland versus the credit that KD gets for his championships in Golden State. We see one guy ascend to superhuman levels carrying a huge responsibility for a team, versus someone who was in an absolute perfect situation.</p>

It&rsquo;s hardly just open shots or single coverage for him all the time. It still isn&rsquo;t a great look but he isn&rsquo;t the one benefitting from spacing.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s the clear best player on the team. But the team is so balanced that it&rsquo;s not as if he&rsquo;s doing a Steph in terms of drawing pressure for the 22 warriors.</p>

<p>When you have a guy like Tatum that has no integral weaknesses, it&rsquo;s very easy to put a good team around him.</p>

<p>Luka is stuck with Gaffird and Lively as his bigs because he lacks the off-ball endurance and catch-and-shoot ability to play with a skilled big man (porzingis admitted he and Luka didn&rsquo;t work out)</p>

<p>Giannis needs a superstar guy like Dame that may end up not having good defense because Giannis can&rsquo;t shoot or hit free throws </p>

There&rsquo;s a reason his efficiency tanks every year in the playoffs. Just like Paul George, his game his entirely predicated on his jumpshot falling. That&rsquo;s why he is inconsistent.

      <label for="l8qh2vb" class="commentText"><p>am Celtics fan and I think he’s probably like the 9th or 10th best scorer in the NBA at best. he’s super talented obviously but the dude takes a lot of unnecessarily tough shots, has extremely inconsistent touch, and most annoyingly he tends to shy away from contact at the rim. to be fair he doesn’t get the best whistle when he drives to the rack but it’s so frustrating to watch this 6’10” muscle-bound monster be weak af with the ball and try to finish with finesse instead of power</p>

<p>I think he’s a naturally inconsistent shooter and you just have to accept that’s who he is</p>

How often his mid to short range shots would just be nowhere near going in was odd to see for a player of his caliber, if teams could contest his 3s well and sell out to stop his drives he had no answers. Jaylen Brown is a bull driving to the rim, you can sell out to stop his drives as hard as you want but he&rsquo;ll still force his way into some easy shots</p>

<p>I think a lot of people would say Luka is the best scorer in the NBA. His TS% has gone down by 5.9 in the playoffs. Tatum&rsquo;s TS% has gone down by 5.6 in the playoffs. Feel like you&rsquo;ve got to give Luka the same criticism about his efficiency tanking in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="l8rc80s" class="commentText"><p>Luka is injured, playing with worst teammates and worst spacing against much better competition.</p>

<p>In Tatum&rsquo;s four playoff series he is shooting .416/.29/.8, .441/.273/.946, .463/.306/.786, and .365/.26/.895.</p>

<p>In Luka&rsquo;s playoff series he is shooting .405/.239/.830, .447/.391/.737, .473/.434/.846, and .47/.25/.625.</p>

<p>Luka&rsquo;s playoff efficiency is dragged down by his series against the Clippers. Since then he has been much more efficient overall and much more efficient than Tatum.</p>

<p>Tatum just has had bad shooting overall and his only passable performance was against Indiana, one of the worst defenses in the entire league.</p>

<p>There is no comparison and cherry picking your TS stat  to make the two seem comparable offensive scorers is cringe.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why teams do not measure their success by TS%. There&rsquo;s a reason that never gets broadcasted on live TV.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s because the stat is context reducing.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what you did trying to compare Tatum and Luka by their TS%. You erase context to draw a completely unrealistic comparison between the two.</p>

Luka is the whole Mavs offense and when his team can&rsquo;t get anything going he was still able to keep the game close like in the first two games in Boston. Jayson has had the luxury of playing his own game and if he can&rsquo;t get his shot going other players around him are more than enough to keep them afloat.</p>

      <label for="l8pmkak" class="commentText"><p>Tatum’s playmaking has been excellent and he has been absolutely pivotal to holding down the rebounding for Celtics (outside of Game 4) vs Mavs bigs and that alone is absolutely huge (Mavs outmuscled Wolves), but his scoring and his defense have been below average.</p>

<p>Mavs are shooting 30-51 (26-39 on 2s, 67%) with Tatum as the primary defender: I’ll just leave it here for good defense part.</p>

<p>Here is how Mavs are shooting against the other Cs:</p>

<p>Brown: 17-32 (14-23 on 2s, 61%)</p>

<p>Jrue: 27-46 (23-35 on 2s, 66%)</p>

<p>White: 26-53 (23-47 on 2s - absolutely freaking elite 49%)</p>

<p>Horford: 20-52 (16-34 on 2s - also absolutely freaking elite 47%)</p>

<p>KP: 13-32 (8-16 on 2s - elite 50%, but small sample as only 2 games)</p>

<p>PP: 6-23 (5-17 on 2s for absolutely crazy 29%, including even holding Doncic to 2-7, would have never expected that to happen, but the little guy goes to war any time the player he guards gets the ball)</p>

<p>Hauser: 12-25 (11-18 on 2s for 61%).</p>

<p>So Tatum is actually posting the worst defensive shooting % among the top-8 Celtics rotation players: White, Horford, KP and surprisingly PP have been the back bone of Boston’s heavy 1v1 defense.</p>

<p>I never thought Tatum was this secret Draymond Green level defender like people have been insinuating since his offensive struggles, but this kind of just showcases why DFG% isn’t a good stat.</p>

<p>His defense has been great and obviously better than Payton Pritchard lol.</p>

      <label for="l8px64g" class="commentText"><p>I naturally would pay less attention to this stat as teams usually send doubles on the best players (your own team doubled both Luka and Kyrie quite often), but Celtics are playing straight up 1v1 defense: if a player gets beaten, there is a much higher chance the guy will just score a basket as help will arrive late. Doncic has been going by Tatum pretty much freely in Games 3 and 4 and Kyrie joined him in Game 4.</p>

      <label for="l8qexka" class="commentText"><p>I mean any Celtic fan would tell you that Tatums not the greatest iso defender, but there’s a lot more to defending than just manning up in iso. Especially when his primary matchup is a center. Celtics are just conceding that either the Mavs can get him on a size mismatch or a Luka mismatch but that’s still a lot better than playing drop against that pnr. Like not saying his defense couldn’t be better this series, especially against Luka it could be. But a lot of those stats are just scheme related.</p>

<p>He is unable to finish at the rim, and is taking contested shots, both of which can be argued as his faults this series. But he absolutely does not have spacing lol</p>

<p>He’s been ass but he’s winning so , if brown doesn’t go hero mode it’s tied <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> with Boston having a much better team. Luka isn’t playing amazing but we know he’s injured. Honestly this is making him look worse cos I partly excused 22 finskd as due to injury but he’s doing the same shit n this Mavs defence isn’t anywhere near as good</p>

      <label for="l8q827j" class="commentText"><p>Game 4 is Tatum’s worst game so far in these finals because his playmaking, defense, and rebounding was much worse than in previous games in the series. It was hilarious to hear Stephen A. Smith say that Tatum was the only one who showed up and was carrying in the half time show but would not hesitate from criticizing Tatum in games 1 and 2.</p>

<p>Casuals care too much about scoring in a vacuum and not about playing winning basketball. It is not just about FGA in a vacuum, it is very clear that Tatum was able to facilitate and involve his teammates better in games 1-3. The fact that he shot the most often is a mere byproduct of being the teams number one option with the highest usage rate on the team.</p>

<p>Or compare his amount of shots to other stars.</p>

<p>Your stats don’t show anything about sacrificing it’s just a fact that he’s taken more shots. If you don’t show comparison your not showing sacrifice</p>

<p>Also Luka shoots a softer and flatter shot from midrange which gets him those nice rolls on the rim. Tatum has no touch and tries to force it in.</p>

      <label for="l8rl5ej" class="commentText"><p>Reminder that he&rsquo;s only getting criticism because there&rsquo;s been a question mark about where he ranks with the league&rsquo;s best. Everyone except Celtics fans are holding him to a top 5-10 standard, and he&rsquo;s not meeting that. His shooting efficiency is abysmal, and it&rsquo;s incredible to me how people are trying to spin it as &ldquo;winning&rdquo; basketball. Replace him with any first option on a previous team that won a title, and they don&rsquo;t win that title. Jokic, steph, giannis, kawhi, LeBron, kd. He&rsquo;s not in their league.</p>

      <label for="l8pw8t6" class="commentText"><p>Sacrificing for the team can have other connotations besides  &ldquo;shooting less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tatum is a small forward who has been guarding the opposing center for most of his time on the court. He is giving up size and strength and expending tons of energy when battling down low with Gafford and Lively.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reason guys like LeBron and Carmelo complained even when asked to guard power forwards for most of their careers &ndash; it sucks. Tatum taking on that role is sacrificing for the team.</p>
