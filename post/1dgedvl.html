      <label for="l8pmkak" class="commentText"><p>Tatum’s playmaking has been excellent and he has been absolutely pivotal to holding down the rebounding for Celtics (outside of Game 4) vs Mavs bigs and that alone is absolutely huge (Mavs outmuscled Wolves), but his scoring and his defense have been below average.</p>

<p>Mavs are shooting 30-51 (26-39 on 2s, 67%) with Tatum as the primary defender: I’ll just leave it here for good defense part.</p>

<p>Here is how Mavs are shooting against the other Cs:</p>

<p>Brown: 17-32 (14-23 on 2s, 61%)</p>

<p>Jrue: 27-46 (23-35 on 2s, 66%)</p>

<p>White: 26-53 (23-47 on 2s - absolutely freaking elite 49%)</p>

<p>Horford: 20-52 (16-34 on 2s - also absolutely freaking elite 47%)</p>

<p>KP: 13-32 (8-16 on 2s - elite 50%, but small sample as only 2 games)</p>

<p>PP: 6-23 (5-17 on 2s for absolutely crazy 29%, including even holding Doncic to 2-7, would have never expected that to happen, but the little guy goes to war any time the player he guards gets the ball)</p>

<p>Hauser: 12-25 (11-18 on 2s for 61%).</p>

<p>So Tatum is actually posting the worst defensive shooting % among the top-8 Celtics rotation players: White, Horford, KP and surprisingly PP have been the back bone of Boston’s heavy 1v1 defense.</p>

<p>I never thought Tatum was this secret Draymond Green level defender like people have been insinuating since his offensive struggles, but this kind of just showcases why DFG% isn’t a good stat.</p>

      <label for="l8px64g" class="commentText"><p>I naturally would pay less attention to this stat as teams usually send doubles on the best players (your own team doubled both Luka and Kyrie quite often), but Celtics are playing straight up 1v1 defense: if a player gets beaten, there is a much higher chance the guy will just score a basket as help will arrive late. Doncic has been going by Tatum pretty much freely in Games 3 and 4 and Kyrie joined him in Game 4.</p>

      <label for="l8pq5m5" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear to anyone that isn&rsquo;t a Celtics fan that Jayson Tatum is not a &ldquo;tier 1&rdquo; scorer. There&rsquo;s a reason his efficiency tanks every year in the playoffs. Just like Paul George, his game his entirely predicated on his jumpshot falling. That&rsquo;s why he is inconsistent. He can&rsquo;t generate efficient shots in the midrange or at the rim because he likes to fadeaway from contact instead of going through it.</p>

      <label for="l8pqzzh" class="commentText"><p>Celtics fans will do anything to pretend his shooting numbers don&rsquo;t tell you he is literally the worst shooter to ever live who played in the finals and took a minimum number of shots to actually be eligible for the stat.</p>

<p>Shit is hilarious watching them jump through hoops to make up reasons why you are a moron or don&rsquo;t know ball if you say that Tatum is the literal worst shooter in NBA Finals HISTORY. It&rsquo;s just the truth, facts don&rsquo;t care about your feelings.</p>

If they win game 5 and go 4-1 it’ll never reflect the anxiety I’ve been having since game one</p>

<p>And last game he simply couldn’t get passed Luka or Gaff/Lively a few times.</p>

<p>I’m just confused at the lack of in between game. That’s what the Mavs are giving him and he’s either missing or just not taking them</p>

I know his rebouding and playmaking are very good, but imo every superstar needs to be a reliable scorer. That&rsquo;s why I have SGA over him</p>

      <label for="l8pw8t6" class="commentText"><p>Sacrificing for the team can have other connotations besides  &ldquo;shooting less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tatum is a small forward who has been guarding the opposing center for most of his time on the court. He is giving up tons of size and strength and expending tons of energy when battling down low with Gafford and Lively.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reason guys like LeBron and Carmelo complained even when asked to guard power forwards for most of their careers &ndash; it sucks. Tatum taking on that role is sacrificing for the team.</p>
