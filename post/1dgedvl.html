<p>He is currently averaging 20 points on 36.5% shooting. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/4065648/jayson-tatum" target="_blank">Jayson Tatum 2023-24 Stats per Game - NBA - ESPN</a> That&rsquo;s his worst FG % in any playoff series he&rsquo;s ever played, just 0.2 % lower than his second worst, which was against the warriors in the 2022 finals.</p>

      <label for="l8rh0gk" class="commentText"><p>I keep coming back to this line of thinking. Truthfully, not as a way to take anything away from Tatum. He plays his role incredibly well and not every player with his talent could/ would be willing to do what he does. He doesn&rsquo;t control the game like a Luka, because during his entire career he hasn&rsquo;t had to, does it need to, and honestly shouldn&rsquo;t because I think he&rsquo;s doing exactly what he should do.</p>

<p>While trying not to take away anything from him, this thought process is why it is conceivable not to give him the same credit as other top offensive engines. If you swap Tatum with any number of 1st option(guards/wings);around the league, how many of those teams get &ldquo;significantly&rdquo; better while the Celtics get &ldquo;significantly&rdquo; worse? Swap him with SGA, Giannis, Donovan, Mitchell, Booker, Luka etc&hellip; I can easily see the Celtics being about the same or better. But I can see the other teams being about the same or potentially worse.</p>

<p>And all of that is ok. It&rsquo;s just giving perspective on what each player can do and what they&rsquo;ve been asked to do throughout their individual careers based on the rosters they&rsquo;ve been surrounded by. I honestly don&rsquo;t care for Devin Booker, but his first 6-7 years are completely different than Tatum/ browns. First 6-7 years in the league in terms of teammates. It&rsquo;s very understandable the habits that they picked up because of that.</p>

<p>Another obvious example is the credit that LeBron gets for the championship in Cleveland versus the credit that KD gets for his championships in Golden State. We see one guy ascend to superhuman levels carrying a huge responsibility for a team, versus someone who was in an absolute perfect situation.</p>

      <label for="l8sku8a" class="commentText"><p>To add to this, Tatum has almost always had the luxury of having a solid team around him to where he could put up some abysmal performances, but it wouldn&rsquo;t matter because his team would still wind up winning by double digits.</p>

<p>How many other No. 1&rsquo;s in the league could drop 18pts on 27% shooting from the field? Tatum can, and he did, in Game 2 of these finals. If the guys you mentioned like Luka or Mitchell or Booker did that, their teams would likely lose by 20+.</p>

<p>Not to take away from Tatum cuz he&rsquo;s obviously still is a top 6-10 player in the league, but his bad performances are less apparent due to his team winning games by like 30 on a nightly basis</p>

      </div>
      <label for="l8so0wz" class="commentText"><p>100% agree. He&rsquo;s teammates have been a gift and a curse from his rookie season on. They allowed him to shine early on in his career and give him the opportunities that he takes advantage of. They also hide his flaws exactly how you said.</p>

<p>Again not trying to be a hater, because the discourse around superstars is normally lacking depth and nuance. It&rsquo;s a team game and there&rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong with how he plays the game.</p>

<p>But what you described are what we typically see with No. 1&rsquo;s. Guys who, 9 times out of 10, determine their team&rsquo;s success. The role Tatum plays in conjunction with the teammates he has had might be more like a 5-6 times out of 10 guy.</p>

<p>I personally don&rsquo;t think that matters. It&rsquo;s a team sport. The only reason this kind of thing means anything is so people have suffering to talk about.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also 100% possible Tatum could be a guy that carries the responsibility of his team success 9 out of 10 times. But the fact of the matter is the Celtics have surrounded him with fantastic teammates his entire career so we have no evidence of it and honestly probably never will. So no hate for him not being that type of player but also he can&rsquo;t realistically get the credit that those types of players get at the same time. We can only judge on what actually happens.</p>

      </div>
      <label for="l8y1k7d" class="commentText"><p>Yeah and again, not to sound like a hater or anything, but Tatum&rsquo;s had a lot of amazing teammates ranging from Kyrie, Hayward, Brown, Smart, Horford, White, Holiday &amp; Pingus that he&rsquo;s never really needed to be a true ball dominant No. 1 that guys like Luka, SGA, Brunson, Jokic exc have had to be.</p>

<p>It is a team game and Tatum does all the right things to help his team win. He may not be stuffing the stat-sheet like the aforementioned guys but he&rsquo;ll do all the little things like secure that defensive rebound, or guard X player down the stretch, but he won&rsquo;t necessarily take over a game like other superstars will. And that isn&rsquo;t what we want to see out of a true No. 1 option.</p>

<p>Like the top 5 guys in the league can all turn a switch and just takeover a game at any point. To once again take examples from the guys above, Luka &amp; Jokic can simply just begin to orchestrate the entire offense in the clutch meanwhile Brunson &amp; SGA can score at will whenever their teams desperately need a bucket, and while Tatum has shown flashes of being able to do both, he&rsquo;s never really had to because of his amazing teammates.</p>

<p>I mean hell, just looking at these playoffs, Brown&rsquo;s been the one taking over in crunch time while Tatum is usually exerting himself on defense more and occasionally taking a questionable side stepping 3, but he&rsquo;ll do everything else that it doesn&rsquo;t really matter cause he&rsquo;s got 4 other guys on the floor who can takeover down the stretch in Holiday, White, Brown &amp; KP, and the entire bench is also just lethal at any point to where it&rsquo;s gotten to a point where Tatum doesn&rsquo;t have to be scoring in the clutch because he&rsquo;s got like 7 other guys who can and that really hides a lot of his weaknesses as you mentioned.</p>

<p>All in all, Tatum might not be a superstar in the traditional sense, but he&rsquo;s helping his team win and at the end of the day, that&rsquo;s what any player in the league wants.</p>

Honestly it shouldn‚Äôt matter to Celtics fans if he‚Äôs top 5 or not, he‚Äôs still a great player, and as long as we‚Äôre in a position to win a championship, nothing else really matters.</p>

      <label for="l8qdjrc" class="commentText"><p>Hes just not playing to the top 5 MVP expectations people put on him. What makes this interesting to me is that he hasn&rsquo;t had an &ldquo;iconic&rdquo; game this entire run making it very unmemorable to fans and the media. And further than that, he doesn&rsquo;t even have to force himself in the clutch with this team, which is where his biggest flaws show mostly, leaving everybody confused as to why they&rsquo;re disappointed in him despite him playing &ldquo;well&rdquo; all around.</p>

<p>I would say a lot of it is the highlight culture of the NBA that makes people disappointed because Tatum hasn&rsquo;t produced a 15 second clip this run that can be sent and resent for the rest of time, and instead he&rsquo;s doing good enough to win with this great team but the argument that these performances wouldnt fly as the number 1 option with with any other team make it hard to dispute.</p>

<p>If anything im interested to see, if boston end up champions, how this run will be looked back at in the future.</p>

We criticize Tatum because of the way he&rsquo;s been offensively and praise Jaylen Brown who&rsquo;s inarguably been the best player for them this entire postseason run because of his consistency and they would start raiding people in the comments section for not placing Tatum above him.</p>

<p>I remember reading a back n forth argument in the game thread where Jrue came up big, and one guy commented on potential finals MVP rankings that had Jaylen Brown in 1st, Jrue 2nd, and Tatum in 3rd.
Tatum fans just straight up go on the offensive even though people weren&rsquo;t really clowning the Celtics but praising other players not named Jayson Tatum</p>

<p>-a #2 who can be an ace on other teams, and</p>

<p>-a #3, #4 and #5 who can fit as #2s on other team pitcher rotations.</p>

<p>Tatum is certainly a far more capable scorer than he‚Äôs shown this postseason but I think you could make a reasonable argument that he‚Äôs not even a top 10 pure scorer in the league rn. he‚Äôs a very good to great scorer, but he‚Äôs not elite. the crux of his value is not his scoring, it‚Äôs his versatility on both ends of the floor</p>

      <label for="l8qgd7o" class="commentText"><p>Both can be true simultaneously. He starts taking a lot of shots when they&rsquo;re ahead and he tries to pad his stats. He ends up taking a ton of contested shots.</p>

<p>In the 3rd game when they blew the 20 point lead, most misses were on Tatum. He did play excellent team game up until that point.</p>

      <label for="l8rh389" class="commentText"><p>Fwiw, according to bbref these numbers aren&rsquo;t accurate.  He has 13 more FG attempts than any other Celtic.  So basically 3 more per game, which is a bit low for your offensive star.  It&rsquo;s one attempt less per game than regular season for him and about 5 attempts less per game than last round.  I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s sacrificing a lot, but people just say whatever shit confirms their previously existing bias.   He&rsquo;s done a pretty good job of making plays for others in my opinion.  It shows in his assist numbers.</p>

He tries to use his physicality to win, and when equal physicality is returned he legit gets mad during the play and forces something bad. This happened almost every drive attempt last night. He wants to be &ldquo;the guy&rdquo; so bad, but honestly doesn&rsquo;t have quite the iso talent as some others. That said, he is good to great at about everything else.</p>

He is still objectively and demonstrably better at it. He also has a higher TS%. We are comparing Luka to the Kobe Bryant that actually existed, not an imaginary, time-shifted Kobe from a 10-year old boy&rsquo;s fever dream.¬† I didn&rsquo;t bring up the comparison, I just corrected the person who did bring it up because they were operating under the assumption that Kobe was better at that shot than he actually was.

      <label for="l8wgg5t" class="commentText"><p>TS is a measurement of efficiency not shooting. Hard to compare since each player takes different shots under different contests. Free throw percentage is a much better comparison for determining who is the better shooter since everyone takes the same shot more or less. Luka is at 74%. Kobe is 10% higher.</p>

<p>Further more, you put a blanket statement that Luka and Kyrie are just better shooters than Kobe, never emphasizing the step back 3. Your TS point doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs a a better shooter since relative to their era, Kobe has a higher relative TS.</p>

<p>This comment was talking about replacing Tatum with Kobe, which is ‚Äútime shifting‚Äù itself. Not sure who you are correcting as no one was comparing Luka/Kyrie with Kobe. They were comparing Tatum and Kobe.</p>

      <label for="l8ulh6v" class="commentText"><p>His shot is definetely off but come on, the spacing is good because he&rsquo;s creating a lot of space with his drives. Just watch the games, you will see how Dallas has preemptively clogged the paint to stop Tatum to compensate bad D by players like Kyrie and Luka, which allowed C&rsquo;s to get the advantage. Jrue Holiday is currently 5th best scorer in the series and like 80% of this points come from space created by the attacking player which for Boston is largely Tatum.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear that Dallas gameplan for D is to stop Tatum. It is stupid to compare this performance to other players when other players get different treatment, Luka this series has been largely defended 1vs1 Tatum was defended largely 2vs1 and 3vs1, it&rsquo;s obvious that scoring for one will be easier than the other</p>

      <label for="l8vqyek" class="commentText"><p>Well the entire argument is that there isn&rsquo;t an open lane, Dallas is protecting the paint a lot to prevent Tatum from getting to the rim which moves Dallas defence and leads to more open jumpshots. If Dallas would be playing more 1vs1 defence like Celtics do and take away open 3pointers, Tatum would have much more space to finish at the basket which he is one of the best in the NBA at this season</p>

      <label for="l8pq5m5" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear to anyone that isn&rsquo;t a Celtics fan that Jayson Tatum is not a &ldquo;tier 1&rdquo; scorer. There&rsquo;s a reason his efficiency tanks every year in the playoffs. Just like Paul George, his game his entirely predicated on his jumpshot falling. That&rsquo;s why he is inconsistent. He can&rsquo;t generate efficient shots in the midrange or at the rim because he likes to fadeaway from contact instead of going through it.</p>

How often his mid to short range shots would just be nowhere near going in was odd to see for a player of his caliber, if teams could contest his 3s well and sell out to stop his drives he had no answers. Jaylen Brown is a bull driving to the rim, you can sell out to stop his drives as hard as you want but he&rsquo;ll still force his way into some easy shots</p>

      <label for="l8pmkak" class="commentText"><p>Tatum‚Äôs playmaking has been excellent and he has been absolutely pivotal to holding down the rebounding for Celtics (outside of Game 4) vs Mavs bigs and that alone is absolutely huge (Mavs outmuscled Wolves), but his scoring and his defense have been below average.</p>

<p>Mavs are shooting 30-51 (26-39 on 2s, 67%) with Tatum as the primary defender: I‚Äôll just leave it here for good defense part.</p>

<p>Here is how Mavs are shooting against the other Cs:</p>

<p>Brown: 17-32 (14-23 on 2s, 61%)</p>

<p>Jrue: 27-46 (23-35 on 2s, 66%)</p>

<p>White: 26-53 (23-47 on 2s - absolutely freaking elite 49%)</p>

<p>Horford: 20-52 (16-34 on 2s - also absolutely freaking elite 47%)</p>

<p>KP: 13-32 (8-16 on 2s - elite 50%, but small sample as only 2 games)</p>

<p>PP: 6-23 (5-17 on 2s for absolutely crazy 29%, including even holding Doncic to 2-7, would have never expected that to happen, but the little guy goes to war any time the player he guards gets the ball)</p>

<p>Hauser: 12-25 (11-18 on 2s for 61%).</p>

<p>So Tatum is actually posting the worst defensive shooting % among the top-8 Celtics rotation players: White, Horford, KP and surprisingly PP have been the back bone of Boston‚Äôs heavy 1v1 defense.</p>

      <label for="l8puxy6" class="commentText"><p>Ehhhh.</p>

<p>I never thought Tatum was this secret Draymond Green level defender like people have been insinuating since his offensive struggles, but this kind of just showcases why DFG% isn‚Äôt a good stat.</p>

<p>His defense has been great and obviously better than Payton Pritchard lol.</p>

      <label for="l8px64g" class="commentText"><p>I naturally would pay less attention to this stat as teams usually send doubles on the best players (your own team doubled both Luka and Kyrie quite often), but Celtics are playing straight up 1v1 defense: if a player gets beaten, there is a much higher chance the guy will just score a basket as help will arrive late. Doncic has been going by Tatum pretty much freely in Games 3 and 4 and Kyrie joined him in Game 4.</p>

      <label for="l8q827j" class="commentText"><p>Game 4 is Tatum‚Äôs worst game so far in these finals because his playmaking, defense, and rebounding was much worse than in previous games in the series. It was hilarious to hear Stephen A. Smith say that Tatum was the only one who showed up and was carrying in the half time show but would not hesitate from criticizing Tatum in games 1 and 2.</p>

<p>Casuals care too much about scoring in a vacuum and not about playing winning basketball. It is not just about FGA in a vacuum, it is very clear that Tatum was able to facilitate and involve his teammates better in games 1-3. The fact that he shot the most often is a mere byproduct of being the teams number one option with the highest usage rate on the team.</p>

      </div>
      <label for="l8sdo19" class="commentText"><p>I‚Äôd say overall he‚Äôs been neutral at best in terms of his impact on the finals and Pacers series.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>‚Ä¢	‚Å†He offers flexibility on defense and can generally guard 1-5 at an average level at worst.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†He is slightly above average in passing and rebounding
‚Ä¢	‚Å†If he gets hot shooting, he can be unstoppable.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>‚Ä¢	‚Å†His stats are inflated so people rush to defend him. Who‚Äôs grabbing the defensive rebounds when the Celtics overall play great team or individual defense. 38 year old Al? Of course Tatum will get a lot of rebounds.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†He takes an obscene amount of bad shots. I literally never think any of his jump shots will go in.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Because he‚Äôs in his own head recently, he won‚Äôt even take open 3s, or worse, dribbles until 1 in the shot clock and then passes to someone at the arc who has to rush their own shot.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†if you take away his wide open 2 hand dunks usually in transition, he‚Äôs probably shooting under 35% this series.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†yeah he‚Äôs getting super stuffed when he drives to the rim because he‚Äôs like 5 feet away. Does he know a mid range jumper or floater from 10-15 feet exist? He can learn from Luka, Kyrie, or even JB that superstars have a mid range game.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†his finishing around the rim sucks. His scoop layup sucks. He has no superior athleticism‚Ä¶ all his dunks are basic 2 hand finishes. Remember when he tried to YAM it in game 2 or 3 and failed? Yeah. Tatum has been given awesome size. He doesn‚Äôt use it well.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Another thing about the inflated stats, he gets ALL of the easy free throws off technicals and end of game blowouts with forced fouls. I really don‚Äôt give a damn about his total points scored. It‚Äôs a total facade for how he‚Äôs actually played.</p>

      <label for="l8pw8t6" class="commentText"><p>Sacrificing for the team can have other connotations besides  &ldquo;shooting less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tatum is a small forward who has been guarding the opposing center for most of his time on the court. He is giving up size and strength and expending tons of energy when battling down low with Gafford and Lively.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reason guys like LeBron and Carmelo complained even when asked to guard power forwards for most of their careers &ndash; it sucks. Tatum taking on that role is sacrificing for the team.</p>

Everyone except Celtics fans are holding him to a top 5-10 standard, and he&rsquo;s not meeting that. His shooting efficiency is abysmal, and it&rsquo;s incredible to me how people are trying to spin it as &ldquo;winning&rdquo; basketball. Replace him with any first option on a previous team that won a title, and they don&rsquo;t win that title. Jokic, steph, giannis, kawhi, LeBron, kd. He&rsquo;s not in their league.</p>

<p>Kobe and mj both(in their prime) could defend 40 minutes and still score 50. Mj often switched the main scorer to pippen, so he had more energy on offense.</p>

Now you put similar caliber players and you right some would do better some would do worse. Imagine lebron or a kd drafted to this type of team, expectations would be high just like Tatum. Great player with room to grow, or is this his peak? If so it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s great too. Allstars, allnba, and soon to be champion. Wouldn&rsquo;t consider him a dominating type or finisher just yet. We will know when he&rsquo;s a final run like a wade, dirk, bron, kyrie, kobe, pierce, bird ,magic or jordan.. if not history will jade him like a Durant, or bill Russell great players on dominating teams but mot to be mentioned with the all-time bus drivers.</p>
