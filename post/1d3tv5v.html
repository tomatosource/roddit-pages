      <p>As few of you may remember, the OKC Thunder beat the San Antonio Spurs in 6 games in the 2016 Western Conference Semifinals. Looking back at the series, how did the Thunder even win this, especially in 6 games?</p>

<p>The Spurs were a 67-win team, had the better coach, and had the best player in the series in Kawhi Leonard. What happened?</p>

      <label for="l69tilr" class="commentText"><p>That Thunder team was truly excellent. The West was so good that year at the top. I think people were slightly surprised, but not especially because of how talented that Thunder team was.</p>

<p>Remember, that OKC team went up on the Warriors in the semifinals 3-1 and won games 3 &amp; 4 by a collective total of 52 points. They were monsters on defense and had two of the top 10 players in the league.</p>

      <label for="l6baiga" class="commentText"><p>He really did. KD should’ve just one uped with the Thunder and ran it back. It was by far the weakest move Ive seen a top 3 player in the league pull. The immediate comparison was if Lebron had joined the Celtics instead of the Heat. It tarnished his reputation and at this point will never recover from it.</p>

<p>When KD and Russ go on a drought just dump it to Al. Or Al could set them up in the high post. I think they win in 2017 if all 3 stay</p>

      <label for="l6cgop4" class="commentText"><p>Presti was actually talking to him and had a contract ready to sign the minute KD signed (KD had told everybody in the org he was signing). Also he had just traded for Oladipo and Sabonis, plus he was going to resign Dion Waiters. The Thunder were going all in. Presti even mentioned in his end of the year press conference this year how he felt like the off season moves that year would gave put that team over the top. However, you can&rsquo;t control everything, you just have to put yourself in a position to improve.</p>

No one needs to remember anything when that series came AFTER the one we&rsquo;re talking about the fuck. You can go back to media predictions and threads this is not confidential information.</p>

<p>Huge majority picked the Spurs and most said easily because of how dominant they been in the reg season, lost once at home at year and how secure and reliable their system was whereas their opponent&rsquo;s were looked as as talented but boneheaded and prone to mistakes and bad at closing. After game 1 everyone was laughing and pointing saying I told you so how could you ever think they&rsquo;d contend.</p>

      <label for="l6bua5b" class="commentText"><p>There was also a play towards the end of Game 2 where Dion Waiters basically fouled Manu while he was attempting to inbound the ball but it was called weirdly and nothing came of it. Spurs narrowly lost that game and could have gone into OKC up 2-0 instead of 1-1 which likely changes the complexion of the series as well</p>

      <label for="l6bnfzl" class="commentText"><p>Exactly this. The Thunder looked shaky all regular season and people really thought they had no shot. We were all excited for this Warriors/Spurs matchup we were craving so bad, which would’ve been epic regardless. But the Thunder had another gear that they hit in the playoffs, and it’s what made KD leaving such a weak move. That Thunder squad could’ve 100% won a chip over the next couple of years. They should’ve gotten it in 2016 if they closed game 6.</p>

<p>People forget how big of a rivalry the KD/Westbrook Thunder vs Spurs was in the 2010s. They played in 2012, 2014, and 2016, with all series going at least 6 games and the Thunder winning 2, Spurs winning 1. </p>

      <label for="l69xvjk" class="commentText"><p>Spurs were a great team, no doubt. Kawhi was emerging as an elite two-way player, LMA was, on the tail end but still in, his all star prime, TD was ancient but still a quality defensive contributor, Manu was shot but capable of spurts, TP was a contributor on the level of Conley now, and then Mills/Green/Diaw were all REALLY good for their roles….</p>

<p>KD and WB were just a force of nature. To me, probably the best pairing that played as many seasons as they did together without winning, and that includes Malone/Stockton.</p>

      <label for="l6btzo7" class="commentText"><p>Diaw was cooked by that playoff run, and he, David West and even Old Man Duncan (to no fault of his own, his last good knee gave out that season) were all powerless against the Thunder’s big man rotation of Adams, Kanter and Ibaka. Kawhi got 2nd in MVP voting that year (to Curry’s unanimous) and just didn’t really take over in that series like we kind of expect him to now, and he and Danny Green weren’t as effective on KD/Russ as we’d hoped either.</p>

<p>No, I’m not using hindsight—it was a stylistic nightmare of a matchup for the Spurs. OKC was the only team in the league to split their head to head with the Spurs outside of GS (which won it), and there’s a reason for that. </p>

      <label for="l6bmc19" class="commentText"><p>This is hindsight though. In the moment, the Thunder had a shaky regular season including some losing streaks, bad losses to top teams. We knew they were real contenders, but the Spurs looked way more solid being 67-15 and only losing one home game. So when the Thunder beat the Spurs, it was a pretty shocking performance.</p>

<p>But then, within a few games against the Warriors, it was easy to see why they won that series. The Thunder hit another gear in the playoffs and their defense was stifling. Westbrook was cooking, KD was being the GOAT scorer he is, and it was hard to stop them. That WCF series was one of the greats. </p>

<p>Iggy actually said looking back that the 2016 Thunder were the best team in the league and should’ve won the chip</p>

      <label for="l6cpcvc" class="commentText"><p>I disagree. That OKC team would&rsquo;ve put the clamps on the Cavs. LeBron would get his, but it would&rsquo;ve been so tough, and KD probably averages 30 on the other end. I think Thunder/Cavs would&rsquo;ve been an electric series that could go either way, but I&rsquo;d lean Thunder. Also the Cavs played like trash the first 4 games against the Warriors, so if they played like that against the Thunder they prob still go down 1-3.</p>

Whatever contributions from Dion Waiters was a plus off the bench, but was inconsistent. They definitely weren&rsquo;t skilled. That&rsquo;s actually what they lost that 3-1 lead to the Warriors the moment Roberson stopped shooting well from 3 (which was an anomaly).</p>

      <label for="l6d143k" class="commentText"><p>Spacing has always been important even in 2016. You can&rsquo;t win just relying on KD/Westbrook to bail you out every time on offense. Go back and rewatch their games vs. the Warriors. They were struggling in the half court, and they had zero spacing outside of KD. If you put them in 2016, you run into an even bigger problem because you can space Adams/Kanter on the court more than you could back then, and punish them defensively by packing the paint.</p>

      <label for="l6cn0yf" class="commentText"><p>The game 2 ending was devastating. Spurs up 1-0, destroyed OKC in game 1, needed that W. Refs missed near 10 calls in the last 13.5 seconds (This is not hyperbole). Most chaotic and heartbreaking sequence I&rsquo;ve ever seen in professional sports.</p>

<p>Thunder have the ball on the side up 1. Started with Manu stepping over the line guarding the inbound. Waiters follows that up by extending out and elbowing him in the throat. Patty was holding Adams. Ball is heaved into the air, Green fouls durant and steals it. Spurs get it to Patty in the corner, possible foul on Adams jumping in his space (Although the Zaza play hadn&rsquo;t happened yet so that rule didn&rsquo;t exist). Then the craziest shit happens&hellip;A fan holds Adams down. Absolute mosh pit down low as the shot misses, multiple guys holding jerseys. Aldridge comes away with it, gets fouled on the shot attempted, misses, game over.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m all for letting guys play throughout the game and especially at the end, but anyone with eyes could have called the waiters elbow on Manu and the fan grabbing Adams.</p>

<p>Not saying that&rsquo;s all the reason for the Thunder outplaying the Spurs and winning the series, but the mental impact it had on me as a fan and I&rsquo;m sure some of the players was devastating.</p>

I don&rsquo;t think it is for definite that Kawhi was better and to be honest personally I&rsquo;m choosing KD. (Can&rsquo;t go wrong with either to be fair)</p>

<p>Part of that was hype since someone had to be the best player on the best team.  But a lot of that was because he was seen as a player who could do it all.</p>

      <label for="l6a6kud" class="commentText"><p>not sure what the odds were, but i remember being surprised. felt like the narrative heading to those playoffs was that it was going to be the 67 win spurs vs the 73 win warriors in the WCF. OKC was good and healthy, but I remember they might have set the record for most blown double digit leads that season. Spurs smashed them in game 1, thought it was over. But then the Thunder hit a switch with that adams/kanter lineup. Won 4 out of 5 against SA and rode that momentum to go up 3-1 against GS</p>

<p>Such a Cinderella run we had after shitting the bed all year and blowing so many leads. Only fitting that it happens when we’re 1 win away from getting back to the Finals.</p>

<p>the beautiful game offense wasn’t really a thing at this point, Parker/Duncan were old and they couldn’t withstand a rough night from one of their 2 stars. KD showed up on defense and bothered Kawhi a fair amount.  </p>

<p>2 of the Spurs losses were also close with some officiating snafus that favored OKC. there would’ve been some long reviews on a couple plays if they had challenges back then. </p>

      <label for="l6bvgyf" class="commentText"><p>A big reason why the Spurs lost the series was because the Thunder were able to throw Roberson exclusively at Kawhi to make his life hard and Kawhi had to guard one of KD or Westbrook at all times while also carrying the offense, while neither of them had to exert as much energy on defense. The other big reason is as you said though, Adams, Kanter and Ibaka absolutely torched every non-Aldridge Spurs big man in that series</p>

      <label for="l6a2ass" class="commentText"><p>Kawhi was not better than KD that year. The big issue for the spurs was that Duncan got injured late in the regular season and was a shell of himself afterwards. Our only real bigs were him and LaMarcus and they had to deal with Adams, Kanter, and Ibaka. We had Diaw and West but they were very undersized to be dealing with OKC&rsquo;s bigs.</p>

<p>Also it was a very close series. We were a 1 pt loss away from going up 2-0 against them and had another 4 pt loss.</p>

Russ dominating his matchup vs Danny Green and having relentless rim pressure destroyed sas because they were too slow for him.kawhi on kd because made it a 4v4 offense for okc and they took advantage of that. Contrary to belief but kd was having an underwhelming 2016 playoff run while this was arguably russ best run as a playoff performer</p>

<p>OKC had the clear 2nd best player in the league paired with a guy who was widely considered a top 10, at absolute worst (and closer to top 5) guy.</p>

<p>No, their supporting cast wasn’t great, but they had a defensive anchor with a nice complimentary offensive game and a smorgasbord of quality one-way players. Super flawed, of course, but hardly insurmountable.</p>

<p>It was a damn good team.</p>

<p>You sure about that? Perhaps you can try and make that argument in hindsight. But I guarantee you, not a single soul outside of San Antonio was arguing that Kawhi was the 2nd best player in the NBA in 2016. That #2 spot was a clear toss-up between KD and Steph.</p>

<p>To answer your question, I have never considered that a big upset. No more of an upset than I would consider the Mavericks beating the Timberwolves. KD and Russ were really really freaking good together.</p>

It was still an upset, as the Spurs were the better team through the season, but people didn&rsquo;t put enough weight on the Thunder being truly healthy for the first time in 3 or 4 years of playoff appearances.</p>

      <label for="l6bycki" class="commentText"><p>The two teams split their regular season games.  The 3rd game (March 26th) OKC beat them by 19.  The 4th game (April 12th) Spurs won by 4 but OKC didn&rsquo;t have Durant.  KD played 72 games and the Thunder won a total of 52, aka they only won 3 games without him.  Also while the Spurs had the #1 ranked defense, they were going against the #2 offense.  Overall rankings for the season was Spurs #1 and Thunder #3.  Much closer than their overall records might imply.</p>

<p>Leonard finished 2nd for MVP, Westbrook and Durant finished 4th and 5th.  I can agree with Kawhi being the best player but the gap might not be that great between him and the two MVP candidates the Thunder had.</p>

<p>Pop ia a better coach but he&rsquo;s also been blessed with a lot of great talent on his rosters.</p>

<p>OKC outrebounded the Spurs; 45.3 to 37.8&hellip;. for the series OKC grabbed 70 offensive rebounds vs 47 that the Spurs got.  You might think those offensive rebounds helped offset the 45.3% FG vs 46% but the Spurs also took more shots.  The Spurs also averaged more PPG; most of that was the game 1 blow out.  But winning by 32 is still just one win.</p>

<p>Spurs had Leonard and then their next best player was LaMarcus Aldridge.  I loved Aldridge in Portland but this wasn&rsquo;t the same player.  Duncan looked old.  Parker looked off.  San Antonio needed someone else to step up.  Manu and/or Danny Green were hopeful suspects but that didn&rsquo;t happen.  Patty Mills and Kevin Martin who were important assets vs Memphis vanished in this series.</p>

<p>OKC got Steven Adams to be their 3rd guy.  He was a double double machine.  Game 2 was close, Adams got his team 17 boards; leading all players in rebounding; including 4 in the 4th quarter (Duncan did match but this is Tim the greatest PF in NBA history matching Steven Adams).  Series tied</p>

<p>Game 4 Adams 16 points / 11 rebounds; again 4 rebounds in the 4th.  Series tied 2 games apiece.</p>

<p>Game 5 was close.  Adams only had 2 rebounds in the 4th but Westbrook grabbed 4 to go along with his 10 points it the quarter.  Enes Freedom (formerly known as Kanter) was a huge help with 4 points, 4 rebounds and 2 blocks in the 4th.  OKC is up 3 to 2.</p>

<p>Game 6 Kevin Durant was The Man with 37 points and 9 rebounds.  Adams had a 15 / 11 night.  Westbrook 28pts and 11asts.  Forgotten man Andre Roberson had 14 points, a steal and 2 blocks.  Leonard scored well but shot 39%; UGLY.  Manu went 1 for 6 and fouled out while playing 23 minutes.  Spurs actually roared back in the 4th, scoring 34 points to OKC&rsquo;s 22 but still lost by 14&hellip; that should tell you how bad they were getting beat.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a huge upset.  This isn&rsquo;t Dallas vs Golden State 2007 or Seattle vs Denver 1994.</p>

      <label for="l6ad9yl" class="commentText"><p>I think the national media favorited San Antonio a bit more because they were consistent in the regular season but most fans knew OKC was more talented and dangerous. Also KD was in his absolute prime and was lethal and that was the start of Kawhi’s prime. I personally thought OKC was going to win, as did alot of my friends and coworkers. I’m pretty sure they were up 3-1 against the 72-10 Warriors and then Russell Westbrook shot them out the series. Klay also went crazy in game 6 when they were pretty much down the whole game.</p>

      <label for="l6bh9g6" class="commentText"><p>Going off memory, I didn’t think it was a big upset. I remember thinking the league was incredibly top heavy with the Warriors, Cavs, and Spurs and that the Thunder would have been in that group if they hadn’t been struggling with injuries in the regular season. I remember feeling that this Spurs team, despite all the records they set, was clearly not the best Spurs team of all time but just had an extremely high floor so we cleaned up the regular season games from night to night. Still, this was a very upsetting loss as Father Time was calling, the Duncan era was closing (retired after the season), and it felt like we missed our chance to even take a shot against the Warriors after gearing up all season for it.</p>

<p>yes the Spurs won a ton of games, but OKC was running with so much size. KD is already a mismatch, but OKC had Kanter when he was considered good, Serge Ibaka, Steven Adams, and then Roberson was an elite defender back then. This was also Tim Duncan’s last year and he was a non factor against the size in that series. The offense was LMA and Kawhi and way past his prime TP. This was a case of a team that was slow, old, and poorly matched into OKC who were always viewed as an elite team all year.</p>

<p>The spurs looked truly dominate and were something like 40-1 at home.</p>

<p>Going in most people probably had the spurs in five or six and after that game one beatdown a lot of people were calling the series over and saying it&rsquo;ll be a sweep or quick five. The spurs Golden state conference finals was basically a forgone conclusion.</p>

      <label for="l6cej92" class="commentText"><p>Honestly it wasn’t really an upset, especially if you consider the context of the years leading up to it. We were a different team in 2016 compared to 2012, but in the 2012 WCF we were coming in with a 20 game winning streak (reg season + 8-0 through the first 2 rounds) and then when we saw OKC the athleticism was just overwhelming. We beat them in 2014 in 6, but every Spurs fan being honest will tell you they were scared as shit for that series (ibaka also missed the first 2 games).</p>

<p>It was kinda the same in 2016 with them being so much more athletic than us + having monster rebounders in Kanter and Adams. Tim had also slowed down a considerable amount in 2016 overall they were just an awful matchup for us.</p>

<p>Going into that series I remember thinking we would win, and very quickly into it I realized they were definitely the better team. And they were definitely the team that would have given the Warriors more problems than us too.</p>

<p>The Spurs won the first two games by like 40 points and then just fell apart.</p>

<p>LMA looked unstoppable</p>

<p>That thunder team was insane, but overshadowed by a 67 win spurs team, 73 win warriors team, and the Lebron healthy cavs</p>

      <label for="l6ak52q" class="commentText"><p>Not a huge upset, the thunder and the Spurs had had a rivalry where they had beaten each other in the playoffs over the years, the Spurs did not have the best player in the series though Kevin Durant at that point was looked at as no lower than the third best player in the league, but on a scale of 1 to 10 as far as upsets, this may be ranks as a three at best, on a side note not enough is made about how Kevin Durant ended both Kobe Bryant and Tim Duncan&rsquo;s last playoff runs</p>

      <label for="l6be5e2" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m surprised it&rsquo;s considered an upset at all. If healthy, we were the team to beat every single year from the finals run to when KD left. The only problem is we had injuries every single year except 1, where we blew the 3-1 lead but were pretty clearly the team to beat</p>

      <label for="l69tbe8" class="commentText"><p>Now that I think of it, the Spurs really should’ve won more than 5 rings during their dynasty era. They blew so many opportunities to win more rings from 2000-2017. Just off the top of my head: Fisher 0.4 shot in 04, Ginobili fouling Dirk on a layup up 3 in Game 7 2006, a close loss to the Lakers in Game 3 at home in 08 when they’d be super dominant at home that postseason, Ginobili getting hurt in 2011 and them losing to the 8th seed Grizzlies, blowing a 2-0 series lead in 2012 to the baby Thunder after starting the playoffs 10-0, and of course the Allen shot in 2013. They really should have more than 5 rings</p>
