      <p>As few of you may remember, the OKC Thunder beat the San Antonio Spurs in 6 games in the 2016 Western Conference Semifinals. Looking back at the series, how did the Thunder even win this, especially in 6 games?</p>

<p>The Spurs were a 67-win team, had the better coach, and had the best player in the series in Kawhi Leonard. What happened?</p>

      <label for="l69tilr" class="commentText"><p>That Thunder team was truly excellent. The West was so good that year at the top. I think people were slightly surprised, but not especially because of how talented that Thunder team was.</p>

<p>Remember, that OKC team went up on the Warriors in the semifinals 3-1 and won games 3 &amp; 4 by a collective total of 52 points. They were monsters on defense and had two of the top 10 players in the league.</p>

Robbed us of a really entertaining West with the Warriors, Thunder, Spurs, and Rockets all battling at the top. Could have been epic but instead the title was a fait accompli for a couple years.</p>

      <label for="l69xvjk" class="commentText"><p>Spurs were a great team, no doubt. Kawhi was emerging as an elite two-way player, LMA was, on the tail end but still in, his all star prime, TD was ancient but still a quality defensive contributor, Manu was shot but capable of spurts, TP was a contributor on the level of Conley now, and then Mills/Green/Diaw were all REALLY good for their roles….</p>

<p>KD and WB were just a force of nature. To me, probably the best pairing that played as many seasons as they did together without winning, and that includes Malone/Stockton.</p>

No one needs to remember anything when that series came AFTER the one we&rsquo;re talking about the fuck. You can go back to media predictions and threads this is not confidential information.</p>

<p>Huge majority picked the Spurs and most said easily because of how dominant they been in the reg season, lost once at home at year and how secure and reliable their system was whereas their opponent&rsquo;s were looked as as talented but boneheaded and prone to mistakes and bad at closing. After game 1 everyone was laughing and pointing saying I told you so how could you ever think they&rsquo;d contend.</p>

But overall, KD was definitely seen as the better player. If the Thunder had won the championship that year, there would’ve been real debate over whether he had passed LeBron as the best player in the league.</p>

<p>OKC had the clear 2nd best player in the league paired with a guy who was widely considered a top 10, at absolute worst (and closer to top 5) guy.</p>

<p>No, their supporting cast wasn’t great, but they had a defensive anchor with a nice complimentary offensive game and a smorgasbord of quality one-way players. Super flawed, of course, but hardly insurmountable.</p>

<p>It was a damn good team.</p>

OKC was good and healthy, but I remember they might have set the record for most blown double digit leads that season. Spurs smashed them in game 1, thought it was over. But then the Thunder hit a switch with that adams/kanter lineup. Won 4 out of 5 against SA and rode that momentum to go up 3-1 against GS</p>

The big issue for the spurs was that Duncan got injured late in the regular season and was a shell of himself afterwards. Our only real bigs were him and LaMarcus and they had to deal with Adams, Kanter, and Ibaka. We had Diaw and West but they were very undersized to be dealing with OKC&rsquo;s bigs.</p>

<p>Also it was a very close series. We were a 1 pt loss away from going up 2-0 against them and had another 4 pt loss.</p>

<p>You sure about that? Perhaps you can try and make that argument in hindsight. But I guarantee you, not a single soul outside of San Antonio was arguing that Kawhi was the 2nd best player in the NBA in 2016. That #2 spot was a clear toss-up between KD and Steph.</p>

<p>To answer your question, I have never considered that a big upset. No more of an upset than I would consider the Mavericks beating the Timberwolves. KD and Russ were really really freaking good together.</p>

      <label for="l6ad9yl" class="commentText"><p>I think the national media favorited San Antonio a bit more because they were consistent in the regular season but most fans knew OKC was more talented and dangerous. Also KD was in his absolute prime and was lethal and that was the start of Kawhi’s prime. I personally thought OKC was going to win, as did alot of my friends and coworkers. I’m pretty sure they were up 3-1 against the 72-10 Warriors and then Russell Westbrook shot them out the series. Klay also went crazy in game 6 when they were pretty much down the whole game.</p>

Russ dominating his matchup vs Danny Green and having relentless rim pressure destroyed sas because they were too slow for him.kawhi on kd because made it a 4v4 offense for okc and they took advantage of that. Contrary to belief but kd was having an underwhelming 2016 playoff run while this was arguably russ best run as a playoff performer</p>

      <label for="l69tbe8" class="commentText"><p>Now that I think of it, the Spurs really should’ve won more than 5 rings during their dynasty era. They blew so many opportunities to win more rings from 2000-2017. Just off the top of my head: Fisher 0.4 shot in 04, Ginobili fouling Dirk on a layup up 3 in Game 7 2006, a close loss to the Lakers in Game 3 at home in 08 when they’d be super dominant at home that postseason, Ginobili getting hurt in 2011 and them losing to the 8th seed Grizzlies, blowing a 2-0 series lead in 2012 to the baby Thunder after starting the playoffs 10-0, and of course the Allen shot in 2013. They really should have more than 5 rings</p>

      <label for="l69toww" class="commentText"><p>It goes the other way too. Injuries to Dirk and Weber to help them get through the West in 03, dumb double team leaving Horry open in 05, very questionable officiating against the Suns in 07. Luck is always a part of championship runs</p>

      <label for="l69w9ix" class="commentText"><p>Maybe, maybe not. We caught some lucky breaks during that run as well. I’m not gonna cry about “only” 5 championships in 15 years too much.</p>
