      <label for="lk0bt6z" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s so interesting how putting a smaller player on a big can short circuit an offense because teams and players have gone away from the post-up so much.</p>

<p>If Chet could develop enough of a post game to attack smaller players it would be nearly impossible to guard the Thunder and they wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily have to pair him next to another center, though they&rsquo;d still need a bigger 4.</p>

<p>I think his body-type and shooting lends itself to be more of a high-post threat like Porzingis, but even someone like Evan Mobley saw success in the low-post these playoffs because he was efficient fading away over smaller guys.</p>

      <label for="lk0gwgn" class="commentText"><p>I think the issue with Chet is beyond just his ability. Our team was just so seasoned to him popping and hanging around on the perimeter and the Mavs took advantage of that.</p>

<p>As soon as we started running more rolls and putting him in the dunker, our offense looked a lot better. But it was too late.</p>

<p>I think that’s the bigger issue imo. Chet might be just as good a finisher as he is a shooter but we don’t always take advantage of that. Utilizing that versatility is just as important as him developing that post game.</p>

He&rsquo;s got the mentality, work ethic, and team support. Instead of a post up against a smaller player like KD or KP would do, there might be some action that gets him a lob which would play more to a strength of his. Will be interesting to see.</p>

Not every playoff team has a shot at winning, but there are usually multiple from each conference who could if things break right. I’m not even a Thunder fan, I’m a Mavs fan, but they were so close against Mavs just had that bad foul at end of 6.</p>

<p>Jalen also put up 19/7/5 on really good efficiency in his first ever playoffs! Chet 16/7/2 also on really good efficiency as a rookie. I think they’re more than capable of being 2nd &amp; 3rd options on a winner. </p>

He was 62% TS in the regular season. 51% against the Mavs. Scoring efficiency and on a per possession took a hit. I agree that happens but it’s also why they weren’t good enough.</p>

<p>I’m really not trying to be a hater because they’d be my pick out of the conference this year.</p>

      <label for="lk4s3et" class="commentText"><p>I agree that Chet or JDub need to make a jump to be legit No 2 options in the playoffs, but shooting is definitely not an issue. The only below average shooter on the roster is Hartenstein. Chet does need to improve his conditioning/pacing though to make sure his legs last until the playoffs. He lost a lot of arc on his shot towards the end of the season</p>

      <label for="lk1yn3a" class="commentText"><p>There are a number of teams that I think can contend, but I have questions about the 2nd scoring option on a lot of these teams that make me hesitant to fully trust them to win it all</p>

<p>Will Paul George show up for an entire playoff run? Will Randle? Will Jalen Williams? Will KAT?</p>

<p>Kyrie not showing up was pretty much the difference in why the Nets couldn’t beat Boston in 2022 and why Dallas couldn’t hang with them in the finals</p>

<p>Tatum and Brown have proven they can do it now, and I’d even trust Jokic and Murray still even with Murray taking a bit of a hit where he regressed to his normal self and not some absurd playoff riser</p>

<p>But a lot of other contenders I still am not sure I can count them in as a shoe-in to make a deep run</p>

<p>I have less questions about LeBron/AD, Butler/Bam and Giannis/Dame but it’s those teams overall rosters that present a problem.</p>

<p>The Celtics feel like the only one, on paper, that have the trifecta of top end talent, depth, and experience</p>

<p>Could OKC win? Yeah absolutely. But until they prove they can, it’s sort of like Boston last year where people won’t believe it until they see it, no matter how talented they are. Harden was an incredible player and choked year after year, and it’s happened to other great players as well (Embiid a couple times now). Playoffs is an entirely different thing that we have no patterns to really draw conclusions from with the OKC team.</p>
