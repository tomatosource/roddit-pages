      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fcgnoi/everybody_says_that_great_players_will_be_great/"><p>Everybody says that great players will be great in any era, but is it possible that bad players become great with great coaching or vice versa?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>We all heard the most famous quote that said &lsquo;Great players become great at any era&rsquo;. But it makes me curious, aside from unbelievable talent like Michael Jordan and Lebron James, who survived the worst team environment possible and still became a great player, is there any possibility that great players nowadays become worse with bad coaching at the start of their career, or vice versa, those who we think it as a bust becomes great with good coaching?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Kawhi Leonard. He is a Hall of Famer, but he has Greg Popovich as his coach in his start. Before he was drafted, he was considered <a href="https://www.nbadraft.net/players/kawhi-leonard/" target="_blank">an average ball handler and a wing that doesn&rsquo;t have a good shooting touch</a>. This makes me consider whether Kawhi will still be the Kawhi we know if he is at the Minnesota Timberwolves, which doesn&rsquo;t have good coaching in that era. Or he will be just the Andrew Wiggins before Andrew Wiggins?</p></li>

<li><p>Michael Carter-Williams. The former ROTY, has vanished in the current NBA. has great size and great athleticism. Damn, he almost has a quadruple double in his debut! But we all know that the 76ers are in a bad rebuilding process with a culture that doesn&rsquo;t want to win (Beginning of the Trust the Process era). It makes me curious because the scouting report says<a href="https://www.nbadraft.net/players/michael-carter-williams/" target="_blank"> he has a good size for a guard, great handling and a high basketball IQ</a>. What if he goes to the Dallas Mavericks, which has Rick Carlisle, a coach that loves to use high IQ guards, will MCW become a good NBA player, or even hyperbolic enough, to become a superstar?</p></li>

      <label for="lm8gcvv" class="commentText"><p>Also it&rsquo;s not clear how much of the improvement to assign to the coach or the player. In the case of Kawhi maybe it was Pop but maybe Kawhi would&rsquo;ve become who he did anywhere. There&rsquo;s really no way for a fan to know that unless a player specifically credits a coach with their development.</p>

<p>And even then, even if 100% of Kawhi&rsquo;s development came down to coaching, it probably wouldn&rsquo;t be Pop specifically, it would be an assistant that most people have never heard of.</p>

<p>The Spurs assistant credited for fixing Kawhis shot is Chip Engelland, now with the Thunder since 2022. No coincidence theyre one of the best shooting teams in the league</p>

If he was taking 7-12 threes a game, instead of 3-4 a game, there&rsquo;s potential he&rsquo;s Steph Curry before Curry became a thing.</p>

      <label for="lm8fsy1" class="commentText"><p>Yes coaching matters but MCW isn’t a good example. He was traded after 1.5 years and played on plenty of teams. He was even a starter on a playoff Bucks team with young Giannis and Middleton, both of whom developed a ton. MCW’s lack of development is on him. You also shouldn’t get tricked by his rookie counting stats. Impact metric wise, he wasn’t that good but playing on a bad team greatly boosts raw counting stats. </p>

<p>They were a huge, athletic, physically imposing team.</p>

<p>I cannot say for sure they beat the Cavs. But the Cavs were an incredibly unimpressive team that year until Game 5 of the Finals haha. With that momentum and that ridiculous level of athleticism, they could have won.</p>

<p>Thunder beat the Spurs twice during this period you&rsquo;re thinking of. In 2012 and 2016. So we already know even with okay-decent coaching, they&rsquo;d get them.</p>

<p>Personally I think 2012 goes to Game 7 if Scott Brooks knew how to recognise that the opposing team&rsquo;s coach is exploiting their weaknesses.</p>

      <label for="lm8dfqk" class="commentText"><p>Without any other constraints, this scenario seems far more likely for a high draft pick who proves to be a “bad” player early on, because they’re likely to get lots of reps/minutes anyways which is far more crucial to development than coaching, in my opinion.</p>

<p>For bad players who weren’t selected or acquired to develop as starters or crucial role players, it seems very, very unlikely even with good coaching because there would be little reason for a coach to regularly place them in the rotation. Maybe an imaginative, younger coach in charge of a long-term rebuild would try to draw maximal potential out of such a player. 82 games somehow seems like less time than advertised to find out if a “bad” player would actually be good if they played in schemes X, Y, Z  with players A, B, C on the court.</p>

<p>That said, I mean yea, for sure lol. I thought it was pretty widely acknowledged that kawhi lucked out from being traded to the spurs. If he stayed in Indiana, he probably wouldn’t have become the Kawhi we know today. Not only did the spurs have pop, Duncan, Manu and Parker already there, but they also had the best shooting coach in the league, chip engellend, the guy who fixed Kawhi and many other players broken shooting forms when they entered the league, like Tony Parker, Lu Dort, SGA, Dejounte Murray, Jalen Williams, and even Carmelo (tho his form wasn’t broken). There were a ton of things that helped Kawhi become Kawhi in San Antonio that wouldn’t have been there on the pacers had he stayed there.</p>

      <label for="lm8ez9v" class="commentText"><p>This is somewhat off on a tangent to the OP’s post, but I did want to mention that the Pacers traded the draft rights to their pick for George Hill. In other words, in order for them to acquire Hill, they had to choose whoever San Antonio told them to pick. It wasn’t a situation where they pick Kawhi first and then use him to trade for Hill. The trade was agreed upon prior to the pick but in order for it to go through, the Pacers had to listen to whoever the Spurs wanted.</p>

And the semantics regarding “why” Kawhi got drafted doesn’t change anything I stated. If he played for the pacers his career would’ve gone differently. The existing infrastructure in San Antonio benefited him greatly.</p>

<p>Don’t look now, but you kinda just did precisely what you accused me of doing, lol.</p>

Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Dario Saric as well. I mean, MCWs best season was with the sixers. They traded him at his highest value. His failure is not on the sixers.

      <label for="lm8pbbm" class="commentText"><p>Interesting question. I&rsquo;d say that a truly great player would be great in any situation. But it&rsquo;s less clear if we consider the below, above, and average player. Coaching staff is responsible for actualizing the potential of all 12 players on the roster and it&rsquo;s apparent not all coaching staffs are equal. For example, Javale was known more for his Shaqtin&rsquo; highlights than anything else his first decade in the league. Many considered him washed til he wound up contributing productive minutes on the Dubs and Lakers. Now he&rsquo;s a 3-time champ having played meaningful minutes in all 3 runs. Ty Lawson, on the other hand, went from an elite PG to out of the league only 3 years after being traded from the Nuggets. It&rsquo;s worth noting that he sustained no major injuries in that time. It could be said that his decline was a consequence of his own personal issues but I&rsquo;d argue that part of what makes a coaching staff great is whether or not they&rsquo;re able to inspire and guide their players in such a way that transcends the game—think Indy, Miami, SA, Utah, and OKC. These teams consistently overachieve and are known for having strong cultures built on/around certain core values. Discipline, selflessness, humility, etc. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s coincidence. Anyway I&rsquo;m just yapping now. Really thought-provoking question, thanks for asking.</p>

      <label for="lm8kw0p" class="commentText"><p>MJ and Lebron came into a bum team, but it didn&rsquo;t affect how great they became.</p>

<p>Remember those games where Jordan was playing against the 86 Celtics and putting up 63? That was a 30 win team. They only made the playoffs because the NBA had recently expanded the playoffs to 8 teams per conference.</p>
