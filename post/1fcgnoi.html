      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fcgnoi/everybody_says_that_great_players_will_be_great/"><p>Everybody says that great players will be great in any era, but is it possible that bad players become great with great coaching or vice versa?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>We all heard the most famous quote that said &lsquo;Great players become great at any era&rsquo;. But it makes me curious, aside from unbelievable talent like Michael Jordan and Lebron James, who survived the worst team environment possible and still became a great player, is there any possibility that great players nowadays become worse with bad coaching at the start of their career, or vice versa, those who we think it as a bust becomes great with good coaching?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Kawhi Leonard. He is a Hall of Famer, but he has Greg Popovich as his coach in his start. Before he was drafted, he was considered <a href="https://www.nbadraft.net/players/kawhi-leonard/" target="_blank">an average ball handler and a wing that doesn&rsquo;t have a good shooting touch</a>. This makes me consider whether Kawhi will still be the Kawhi we know if he is at the Minnesota Timberwolves, which doesn&rsquo;t have good coaching in that era. Or he will be just the Andrew Wiggins before Andrew Wiggins?</p></li>

<li><p>Michael Carter-Williams. The former ROTY, has vanished in the current NBA. has great size and great athleticism. Damn, he almost has a quadruple double in his debut! But we all know that the 76ers are in a bad rebuilding process with a culture that doesn&rsquo;t want to win (Beginning of the Trust the Process era). It makes me curious because the scouting report says<a href="https://www.nbadraft.net/players/michael-carter-williams/" target="_blank"> he has a good size for a guard, great handling and a high basketball IQ</a>. What if he goes to the Dallas Mavericks, which has Rick Carlisle, a coach that loves to use high IQ guards, will MCW become a good NBA player, or even hyperbolic enough, to become a superstar?</p></li>

      <label for="lm8bkdb" class="commentText"><p>lol, I could tell you were a Mavs fan just by reading this. Scrolled up and saw you were one, bullseye.</p>

<p>That said, I mean yea, for sure lol. I thought it was pretty widely acknowledged that kawhi lucked out from being traded to the spurs. If he stayed in Indiana, he probably wouldn’t have become the Kawhi we know today. Not only did the spurs have pop, Duncan, Manu and Parker already there, but they also had the best shooting coach in the league, the guy who fixed Kawhi and later Lonzo Ball’s broken shooting forms, among others. There were a ton of things that helped Kawhi become Kawhi in San Antonio that wouldn’t have been there on the pacers had he stayed there.</p>
