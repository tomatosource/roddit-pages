      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fcgnoi/everybody_says_that_great_players_will_be_great/"><p>Everybody says that great players will be great in any era, but is it possible that bad players become great with great coaching or vice versa?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>We all heard the most famous quote that said &lsquo;Great players become great at any era&rsquo;. But it makes me curious, aside from unbelievable talent like Michael Jordan and Lebron James, who survived the worst team environment possible and still became a great player, is there any possibility that great players nowadays become worse with bad coaching at the start of their career, or vice versa, those who we think it as a bust becomes great with good coaching?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Kawhi Leonard. He is a Hall of Famer, but he has Greg Popovich as his coach in his start. Before he was drafted, he was considered <a href="https://www.nbadraft.net/players/kawhi-leonard/" target="_blank">an average ball handler and a wing that doesn&rsquo;t have a good shooting touch</a>. This makes me consider whether Kawhi will still be the Kawhi we know if he is at the Minnesota Timberwolves, which doesn&rsquo;t have good coaching in that era. Or he will be just the Andrew Wiggins before Andrew Wiggins?</p></li>

<li><p>Michael Carter-Williams. The former ROTY, has vanished in the current NBA. has great size and great athleticism. Damn, he almost has a quadruple double in his debut! But we all know that the 76ers are in a bad rebuilding process with a culture that doesn&rsquo;t want to win (Beginning of the Trust the Process era). It makes me curious because the scouting report says<a href="https://www.nbadraft.net/players/michael-carter-williams/" target="_blank"> he has a good size for a guard, great handling and a high basketball IQ</a>. What if he goes to the Dallas Mavericks, which has Rick Carlisle, a coach that loves to use high IQ guards, will MCW become a good NBA player, or even hyperbolic enough, to become a superstar?</p></li>

      <label for="lm8gcvv" class="commentText"><p>Also it&rsquo;s not clear how much of the improvement to assign to the coach or the player. In the case of Kawhi maybe it was Pop but maybe Kawhi would&rsquo;ve become who he did anywhere. There&rsquo;s really no way for a fan to know that unless a player specifically credits a coach with their development.</p>

<p>And even then, even if 100% of Kawhi&rsquo;s development came down to coaching, it probably wouldn&rsquo;t be Pop specifically, it would be an assistant that most people have never heard of.</p>

<p>The Spurs assistant credited for fixing Kawhis shot is Chip Engelland, now with the Thunder since 2022. No coincidence theyre one of the best shooting teams in the league</p>

<p>Brooks however was turrible. They held onto him for far too long and after 2012, I don&rsquo;t know how he wasn&rsquo;t on the shortest leash possible. All time bad coaching job in the Finals, only one I&rsquo;d say was worse, was George Karl in the 96 Finals.</p>

<p>They were a huge, athletic, physically imposing team.</p>

<p>I cannot say for sure they beat the Cavs. But the Cavs were an incredibly unimpressive team that year until Game 5 of the Finals haha. With that momentum and that ridiculous level of athleticism, they could have won.</p>

<p>Thunder beat the Spurs twice during this period you&rsquo;re thinking of. In 2012 and 2016. So we already know even with okay-decent coaching, they&rsquo;d get them.</p>

<p>Personally I think 2012 goes to Game 7 if Scott Brooks knew how to recognise that the opposing team&rsquo;s coach is exploiting their weaknesses.</p>

      <label for="lmcg9y1" class="commentText"><p>I didn&rsquo;t mean it like that, I was just asking which teams do they take championships away from in those years. Is it the Warriors? I don&rsquo;t think it happens with the Heat the first time around, and I don&rsquo;t think they beat the Spurs in 2013 or 2014. 2015 is probably the best shot to start winning but that was the year Durant had the foot injury and played like 30 games. 2016 is obviously up for grabs since they were that close to beating the Warriors anyway.</p>

<p>This is what it&rsquo;s tough to play the what if game, because then it becomes what about the Warriors in 2017 and 2018 because that hinged on Durant entirely.</p>

He was even a starter on a playoff Bucks team with young Giannis and Middleton, both of whom developed a ton. MCW’s lack of development is on him. You also shouldn’t get tricked by his rookie counting stats. Impact metric wise, he wasn’t that good but playing on a bad team greatly boosts raw counting stats. </p>

<p>But those sixers did find a ton of late first/ 2nd round gems.</p>

<p>The best way to develop young talent is to give them the opportunity to play and learn in real games. Its why GSW, despite how great of team/coach struggled with their lottery picks. They needed players who knew what to do, not ones trying to figure it out. the minutes got distributed accordingly.</p>

      <label for="lm8dfqk" class="commentText"><p>Without any other constraints, this scenario seems far more likely for a high draft pick who proves to be a “bad” player early on, because they’re likely to get lots of reps/minutes anyways which is far more crucial to development than coaching, in my opinion.</p>

<p>For bad players who weren’t selected or acquired to develop as starters or crucial role players, it seems very, very unlikely even with good coaching because there would be little reason for a coach to regularly place them in the rotation. Maybe an imaginative, younger coach in charge of a long-term rebuild would try to draw maximal potential out of such a player. 82 games somehow seems like less time than advertised to find out if a “bad” player would actually be good if they played in schemes X, Y, Z  with players A, B, C on the court.</p>

      <label for="lm8pbbm" class="commentText"><p>Interesting question. I&rsquo;d say that a truly great player would be great in any situation. But it&rsquo;s less clear if we consider the below, above, and average player. Coaching staff is responsible for actualizing the potential of all 12 players on the roster and it&rsquo;s apparent not all coaching staffs are equal. For example, Javale was known more for his Shaqtin&rsquo; highlights than anything else his first decade in the league. Many considered him washed til he wound up contributing productive minutes on the Dubs and Lakers. Now he&rsquo;s a 3-time champ having played meaningful minutes in all 3 runs. Ty Lawson, on the other hand, went from an elite PG to out of the league only 3 years after being traded from the Nuggets. It&rsquo;s worth noting that he sustained no major injuries in that time. It could be said that his decline was a consequence of his own personal issues but I&rsquo;d argue that part of what makes a coaching staff great is whether or not they&rsquo;re able to inspire and guide their players in such a way that transcends the game—think Indy, Miami, SA, Utah, and OKC. These teams consistently overachieve and are known for having strong cultures built on/around certain core values. Discipline, selflessness, humility, etc. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s coincidence. Anyway I&rsquo;m just yapping now. Really thought-provoking question, thanks for asking.</p>

<p>That said, I mean yea, for sure lol. I thought it was pretty widely acknowledged that kawhi lucked out from being traded to the spurs. If he stayed in Indiana, he probably wouldn’t have become the Kawhi we know today. Not only did the spurs have pop, Duncan, Manu and Parker already there, but they also had the best shooting coach in the league, chip engellend, the guy who fixed Kawhi and many other players broken shooting forms when they entered the league, like Tony Parker, Lu Dort, SGA, Dejounte Murray, Jalen Williams, and even Carmelo (tho his form wasn’t broken). There were a ton of things that helped Kawhi become Kawhi in San Antonio that wouldn’t have been there on the pacers had he stayed there.</p>

In other words, in order for them to acquire Hill, they had to choose whoever San Antonio told them to pick. It wasn’t a situation where they pick Kawhi first and then use him to trade for Hill. The trade was agreed upon prior to the pick but in order for it to go through, the Pacers had to listen to whoever the Spurs wanted.</p>

<p>Jose Calderon would be used much more effectively in today&rsquo;s game with his shooting and play-making abilities. It always bugged me how Toronto was constantly trying to &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; from Calderon (TJ Ford, Jarrett Jack) instead of just riding with Jose and letting him be the PG.</p>

<p>Andrea Bargnani had pretty bad development. I&rsquo;m sure some of that is on him, but Toronto kept changing what they wanted him to be. He&rsquo;s a SF, now he&rsquo;s a PF, now he&rsquo;s Centre. Is he out their to space the floor? Nah let&rsquo;s try to run action for him from the high post instead. It&rsquo;s so hard to develop when the team keeps changing what they want you to be. He had some bad luck with injury timing when things finally started to click which didn&rsquo;t help either.</p>

      <label for="lmaxz3o" class="commentText"><p>I think in any scenario your environment matters. It’s the universal nature v nurture conversation. Beyond just the HC everything matters. Who are your veterans, how stable is the GM/front office, what is the training staff like? The NO Pelicans for example have one of the best shooting coaches in the league if he gets MCW as a rookie and retools his shot and Carter-Williams is coached by Dantoni that instills a modern style of point guard play immediately then his game changes. Heat Culture is a thing for a reason.</p>

<p>I’m not sure that environment alone can make any player good or great but I do believe environment and ecosystem can 100% play a role in a player going up or down 2 tiers. A fringe role player in the right environment can be a successful starter. The Dallas Mavs just proved this with Gafford, Washington and Jones Jr all on the same team.</p>

      <label for="lmba5kc" class="commentText"><p>Kawhi improved massively but in college had a money mid range shot and was dynamic with it. It wasn’t just standstill shooting. His 3 point percentages were never great but you could easily project him to be a decent enough shooter with that in mind especially considering in 2011 you weren’t exactly expecting star wings to need to shoot. His advancements as a ball handler and playmaker imo are much more impressive.</p>

<p>That’s why when I scout out young players I look at  shot diet and how dynamic the jumper is more than I do percentages.</p>

<p>It’s why I had Maxey top 5 in 2021 on my big board because despite his 29% from 3 on not a whole lot of volume he was just such a ridiculous shot maker from all over the court it was just hard to bet against.</p>
