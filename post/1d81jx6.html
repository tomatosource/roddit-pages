<li><p>Everyone knew LeBron was getting ready to dip in FA and the Cavs had zero assets left to field a competitive team once that happened.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And KD was still with the warriors so it wasnt like they were prohibitive favorites to win. From Kyrie’s point of view would it really have made a difference in his legacy if he had one more losing finals appearance with LeBron?</p>

      </div>
      <label for="l73dt9q" class="commentText"><p>It goes deeper than that. Kyrie injured his knee from a random skateboarding accident awhile back. In 2015 he was telling the Cavs medical staff that he felt that knee was flaring up and wanted to sit out. The medical staff told him there was nothing to worry about and recommended that he played. He ended up fracturing his patella in the same knee from a freak injury colliding with Klay the next game. He had screws and a tension wire surgically inserted to stabilize the injury and the screws got infected if I recall correctly.</p>

<p>Needless to say, his relationship and trust with the Cavs and their medical staff were fractured. I still remember him limping back to the locker room and throwing his jersey in frustration because he knew this was going to happen. His dad was following him and was obviously fuming at the Cavs as well.</p>

<p>He obviously stayed a couple more years but his trust in the Cavs never really recovered and then when they tried to trade him it was the nail in the coffin. He threatened the Cavs with season ending knee surgery to clean up the after effects of the initial knee surgery when he got the screws put in if he wasn&rsquo;t traded. He still ended up having to get the clean up procedure after he was traded.</p>

      <label for="l73j4l2" class="commentText"><p>From a neutral point of view, the injury he suffered in the game was nothing but a freak injury when he collided with Klay in an awkward way. But from Kyrie&rsquo;s side, he was urging the staff to sit him because he was feeling pain in his knee due to the skateboarding accident (which I think he suffered before he was even in the NBA but don&rsquo;t quote me on that). From Kyrie&rsquo;s point of view, freak injury or not, he suffered a massive injury to that same knee he was warning the staff about, and that surgery caused him much more complications further down the line. Which is why he ended up having to get season ending surgery again when he was in Boston.</p>

      <label for="l73xlve" class="commentText"><p>Honestly when are we going to start having uncomfortable convos about team medical staff. I know officially teams have no say in getting players to play but i feel like that there&rsquo;s more and more pressure to get players on the floor faster with how much salaries and expenses have increased in the league. How are we auditing that doctors and therapists are giving neutral judgement on players injuries. Just as recently as the mavs incident with lively it just didn&rsquo;t feel right having him back on the floor so soon.</p>

This wasn&rsquo;t the first dumb question he was asked in his career and it wasn&rsquo;t the last (post-Cavs). It played no major role in him leaving. Kyrie could&rsquo;ve laughed about it with his teammates after the fact for all we know. It was likely more of an annoyance than anything else. Dumb take.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me. I think he was thinking about leaving in 2018 but gave the Cavs one more chance to make it right at the trade deadline. They fucked it up and he had his bags ready to go for the rest of the season.</p>

He felt he individually had an amazing 16-17 season (year after they won), and didn’t get any credit or accolades for it. With all the credit going to lebron for the finals win the year before as well (even though Kyrie was an essential component, they don’t win if he doesn’t average 28ppg), he quickly realized his individual play would not be given its due value, and decided he wanted to leave. He did this respectfully though, and still tried his level best in 16-17 and only brought it up when the off season began.</p>

      <label for="l73rc8w" class="commentText"><p>DWade was the #1 option in 2006 Miami Heat team and had his finals mvp. He also had plenty of time to establish himself as a superstar player in the league before lebron joined him from 2003-2010 and collect his individual accolades. Even though lebron was the best player on the Heat from 2010-2014, Miami was still DWade’s county.</p>

<p>Very different situation from Kyrie</p>

<p>Kevin Love didn&rsquo;t have the kind of trade value to get a Paul George, which is why Cavs tried to shop him.  Kyrie found out and then demanded a trade.</p>

<p>also he was directly involved in allowing KD to join the Warriors cause he was on the player&rsquo;s union that voted for the cap spike cause he needed the Cavs to pay his superteam. which opened the doors for the Warriors to make their move</p>

<p>Alright buddy, let’s play this game then:</p>

<p>No, you don’t need that team to beat LeBron. You just need Jason Terry and JJ Barea to lock him up in the NBA finals as he proceeds to lose his half a dozen finals.</p>

<p>See how easy this is?</p>

<p>Talk some substance. Under the current cap rules, the 2017 Cleveland Cavaliers wouldn’t have existed either.</p>

It&rsquo;s also bad assumption to make.  How many people become absolute headcases for multiple years only to turn it around in their early thirties?  It&rsquo;s a short list.  The list of headcases who continued to be trouble and quickly found themselves out of the league is much longer.</p>

<p>LeBron should&rsquo;ve faded into a secondary scorer/playmaker star by now but that&rsquo;ll require having guards that can actually justify taking the ball out of his hands and that can get to the rim without a screen.</p>
