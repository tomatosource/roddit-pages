<li><p>Everyone knew LeBron was getting ready to dip in FA and the Cavs had zero assets left to field a competitive team once that happened.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And KD was still with the warriors so it wasnt like they were prohibitive favorites to win. From Kyrie’s point of view would it really have made a difference in his legacy if he had one more losing finals appearance with LeBron?</p>

      </div>
      <label for="l73dt9q" class="commentText"><p>It goes deeper than that. Kyrie injured his knee from a random skateboarding accident awhile back. In 2015 he was telling the Cavs medical staff that he felt that knee was flaring up and wanted to sit out. The medical staff told him there was nothing to worry about and recommended that he played. He ended up fracturing his patella in the same knee from a freak injury colliding with Klay the next game. He had screws and a tension wire surgically inserted to stabilize the injury and the screws got infected if I recall correctly.</p>

<p>Needless to say, his relationship and trust with the Cavs and their medical staff were fractured. I still remember him limping back to the locker room and throwing his jersey in frustration because he knew this was going to happen. His dad was following him and was obviously fuming at the Cavs as well.</p>

<p>He obviously stayed a couple more years but his trust in the Cavs never really recovered and then when they tried to trade him it was the nail in the coffin. He threatened the Cavs with season ending knee surgery to clean up the after effects of the initial knee surgery when he got the screws put in if he wasn&rsquo;t traded. He still ended up having to get the clean up procedure after he was traded.</p>

      <label for="l73j4l2" class="commentText"><p>From a neutral point of view, the injury he suffered in the game was nothing but a freak injury when he collided with Klay in an awkward way. But from Kyrie&rsquo;s side, he was urging the staff to sit him because he was feeling pain in his knee due to the skateboarding accident (which I think he suffered before he was even in the NBA but don&rsquo;t quote me on that). From Kyrie&rsquo;s point of view, freak injury or not, he suffered a massive injury to that same knee he was warning the staff about, and that surgery caused him much more complications further down the line. Which is why he ended up having to get season ending surgery again when he was in Boston.</p>

I know officially teams have no say in getting players to play but i feel like that there&rsquo;s more and more pressure to get players on the floor faster with how much salaries and expenses have increased in the league. How are we auditing that doctors and therapists are giving neutral judgement on players injuries. Just as recently as the mavs incident with lively it just didn&rsquo;t feel right having him back on the floor so soon.</p>

Kyrie could&rsquo;ve laughed about it with his teammates after the fact for all we know. It was likely more of an annoyance than anything else. Dumb take.</p>

He felt he individually had an amazing 16-17 season (year after they won), and didn’t get any credit or accolades for it. With all the credit going to lebron for the finals win the year before as well (even though Kyrie was an essential component, they don’t win if he doesn’t average 28ppg), he quickly realized his individual play would not be given its due value, and decided he wanted to leave. He did this respectfully though, and still tried his level best in 16-17 and only brought it up when the off season began.</p>

Jokic beating them twice in a row while that being his matchup makes it easy for the media to slander him. Add to the fact that aside from game 1, he was terrible by superstar standards in the 2020 finals he doesn’t have a defining finals series like a Giannis.</p>

      <label for="l744nt9" class="commentText"><p>AD didn’t get nearly the credit he deserved in 2020. In fact if you switched his name with lebron, he probably gets finals mvp for the numbers he put up in the finals. Lebron’s teammates undoubtedly take a hit when playing with him. Just because of name value, lebron will always be regarded as the best player.</p>

<p>There is pretty much no advanced metric in which AD isn’t better than lebron in as of 2024, but most people will still say lebron’s the lakers best player, with no substantial evidence apart from name value backing it up.</p>

      <label for="l747syw" class="commentText"><p>What? Ad played terrible in the finals except in game 1, he had no argument over Lebron when Lebron averaged better numbers in every single stat. The wfc is where he popped off, the finals will say 26 ppg but that’s skewed cause of the 40 points in the first game, plus he was injured for game 6. While i do agree that AD is currently better, they’re not worlds apart (Maybe next season) and Ad has inconsistent offense which is why people say that</p>

      <label for="l73nbr6" class="commentText"><p>Pretty much everyone was saying that.  There&rsquo;s a reason he didn&rsquo;t cost that much for the Mavs to get, his stock was at an all time low.  It&rsquo;s also bad assumption to make.  How many people become absolute headcases for multiple years only to turn it around in their early thirties?  It&rsquo;s a short list.  The list of headcases who continued to be trouble and quickly found themselves out of the league is much longer.</p>

<p>LeBron should&rsquo;ve faded into a secondary scorer/playmaker star by now but that&rsquo;ll require having guards that can actually justify taking the ball out of his hands and that can get to the rim without a screen.</p>

      <label for="l747xca" class="commentText"><p>It’s way different. Aside from having a very different skillset, AD thrives in very specific conditions. He needs to be in his spots, specific actions need to be run for him, and then he can be dominant. Kyrie needs to sets, can play from any spot, and doesn’t need any fixed plays.</p>

<p>AD is definitely better in a very narrow bandwidth, but Kyrie is still fantastic and he’s able to be effective across the whole frequency range.</p>

But for some reason it never comes through. He is considered a nice guy , but most of the great players don&rsquo;t want to play with him but only against. Could never understand why?</p>

<p>i imagine it&rsquo;d certainly be more than 1. and if it was 2-3 more, maybe LBJ would&rsquo;ve settled the GOAT debate once and for all. But that&rsquo;s part of the challenge of reaching GOAT status, keeping teams together (or adapting swiftly to roster changes) after years &amp; years is a fucking nearly-impossible job in itself.</p>
