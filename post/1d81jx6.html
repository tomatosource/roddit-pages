<ul>

<li><p>Kyrie didn’t like that LeBron got all the credit and wanted a try at being The Man.</p></li>

<li><p>Everyone knew LeBron was getting ready to dip in FA and the Cavs had zero assets left to field a competitive team once that happened.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And KD was still with the warriors so it wasnt like they were prohibitive favorites to win. From Kyrie’s point of view would it really have made a difference in his legacy if he had one more losing finals appearance with LeBron?</p>

      <label for="l73dt9q" class="commentText"><p>It goes deeper than that. Kyrie injured his knee from a random skateboarding accident awhile back. In 2015 he was telling the Cavs medical staff that he felt that his knee was flaring up and wanted to sit out. The medical staff told him there was nothing to worry about and recommended that he played. He ended up fracturing his patella in the same knee from a freak injury colliding with Klay the next game. He had screws and a tension wire surgically inserted to stabilize the injury and the screws got infected if I recall correctly.</p>

<p>Needless to say, his relationship and trust with the Cavs and their medical staff were fractured. I still remember him limping back to the locker room and throwing his jersey in frustration because he knew this was going to happen. His dad was following him and was obviously fuming at the Cavs as well.</p>

<p>He obviously stayed a couple more years but his trust in the Cavs never really recovered and then when they tried to trade him it was the nail in the coffin. He threatened the Cavs with season ending knee surgery to clean up the after effects of the initial knee surgery when he got the screws put in if he wasn&rsquo;t traded. He still ended up having to get the clean up procedure after he was traded.</p>

      <label for="l73j4l2" class="commentText"><p>From a neutral point of view, the injury he suffered in the game was nothing but a freak injury when he collided with Klay in an awkward way. But from Kyrie&rsquo;s side, he was urging the staff to sit him because he was feeling pain in his knee due to the skateboarding accident (which I think he suffered before he was even in the NBA but don&rsquo;t quote me on that). From Kyrie&rsquo;s point of view, freak injury or not, he suffered a massive injury to that same knee he was warning the staff about, and that surgery caused him much more complications further down the line. Which is why he ended up having to get season ending surgery again when he was in Boston.</p>

      <label for="l73mclh" class="commentText"><p>Kyrie would do some shit like get a skateboarding injury during the season, especially back then, so I’d need some definitive proof it was before to believe him. Also, he could’ve just sat out when he had that discomfort the Cavs medical staff said was fine, right? They literally can’t force him to play. The Covid vaccine incident being a big example of Kyrie’s willingness to stand on his beliefs and intuition.</p>

<p>He came in as the first pick on a shitty Cavs team and was the man. LeBron comes back and he’s still the man, just not as much as LeBron (but no one will ever be). I love Kyrie for his time in Cleveland, but I don’t think he gets a pass for forcing his way out like that. It was very immature and unprofessional. I am glad he’s having success in Dallas, though. They probably won’t beat Boston but I really really hope they do!</p>

I heard this story from Kyrie&rsquo;s point of view when he talked about it during one of his streams so it&rsquo;s only one side of the story. I think I remember the details being somewhat confirmed by one of the Cleveland beat reporters but I don&rsquo;t remember who.</p>

<p>But I think two things can be true.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>He wanted to sit but Cavs urged him to play so he did</p></li>

<li><p>When he fractured his knee cap he and his dad blamed the Cavs for not protecting him especially after telling them about his pain.</p></li>

<p>Kyrie was treated just Fine the first year+ in Boston. He didn’t start getting bad coverage until he started talking shit about “the young guys” to the media and dodging questions about re-signing after he said he would during the off season.</p>

<p>And it didn’t get bad bad until he shot the team out of the playoffs against the bucks while playing some of the most selfish basketball I’ve seen since Antoine Walker was searching for a 4 point shot to jack up.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me. I think he was thinking about leaving in 2018 but gave the Cavs one more chance to make it right at the trade deadline. They fucked it up and he had his bags ready to go for the rest of the season.</p>

He felt he individually had an amazing 16-17 season (year after they won), and didn’t get any credit or accolades for it. With all the credit going to lebron for the finals win the year before as well (even though Kyrie was an essential component, they don’t win if he doesn’t average 28ppg), he quickly realized his individual play would not be given its due value, and decided he wanted to leave. He did this respectfully though, and still tried his level best in 16-17 and only brought it up when the off season began.</p>

      <label for="l736n3v" class="commentText"><p>Kyrie didn’t want LeBron to decide his career. From what I remember, lebron didn’t wanna sign long term with the cavs  and also tried trading Kyrie. I think there was a PG13 trade that the cavs were willing to pull the trigger on but lebron not wanting to sign an extension with cavs killed the deal.</p>

<p>I don’t blame Kyrie. Lebron tries to do everyone wrong ie Kevin love with the fit in/fit out tweet and the Westbrook saga. LeBron recruited Westbrook, forced lakers to trade for him and once LeBron realized that Westbrook isn’t of help to him, tried to drag his name under the mud.</p>

<p>Would have happened to Kyrie even he didn’t force out.</p>

      <label for="l73b345" class="commentText"><p>LeBron dragged Russ through the mud? Man y’all say anything on here. The media dragged Russ through the mud after Russ played abysmal basketball for the Lakers while making more salary than Bron and AD. Lebron never once said a negative word about Westbrook during his Lakers tenure even though Russ had so many brain dead games where you’d just want to smash something against the TV watching. Also I don’t buy LeBron wanting to trade Kyrie that’s bs. Why would LeBron think that a duo with himself and PG would be enough to beat Warriors, at best that’s a minimal improvement over the Bron/Kyrie duo. Kyrie requested a trade simply because he wanted to be the man and see how far he could take a team as the best player, nothing more nothing less.</p>

It&rsquo;s also bad assumption to make.  How many people become absolute headcases for multiple years only to turn it around in their early thirties?  It&rsquo;s a short list.  The list of headcases who continued to be trouble and quickly found themselves out of the league is much longer.</p>

      <label for="l735zop" class="commentText"><p>LeBron&rsquo;s been looking for another Kyrie since they split up. Rondo was nowhere near Kyrie but in 2020, he was the only pg since Kyrie that took a lot of the playmaking/floor general burden off of him.</p>

<p>LeBron should&rsquo;ve faded into a secondary scorer/playmaker star by now but that&rsquo;ll require having guards that can actually justify taking the ball out of his hands and that can get to the rim without a screen.</p>

      <label for="l73mri5" class="commentText"><p>Then maybe I misunderstood because I don&rsquo;t get what the point of your comment was.</p>

<p>Just that Kyrie has always considered he&rsquo;s the best shooting option with the game on the line?</p>

<p>Lebron hit at least 2 game winners in the playoffs when he and Kyrie played together. He also hit 2 in 2018 playoffs after Kyrie left.</p>

<p>Kyrie said he always considered himself the best option for taking the last shot. Said he felt bad if anyone else took it even if he &ldquo;trusted&rdquo; his teammates.</p>

<p>He knows what Bron could do, he just thought he was still the better option in those situations until he paired up with Durant.</p>

<p>What were we talking about&hellip; I&rsquo;ve lost track.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Luka can hit a game winning shot&rdquo;</p>

<p>And you&rsquo;re sticking to the opinion that Lebron couldn&rsquo;t?</p>

      <label for="l73o7ki" class="commentText"><p>Was just I guess a bad joke. Luka is clearly clutch and one of the best shooters of all time and Kyrie dissed LeBron before with saying he himself was always the best option down the stretch. LeBron saying he should have never stopped running with Kyrie. Kyrie though is on record saying LeBron cant hit but is also on record glazing Luka shotmaking. Thought his previous comments were more common knowledge then clearly they are to this sub.</p>
