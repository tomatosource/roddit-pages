</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><strong>Player #1</strong><br>
Position: Small Forward/Power Forward<br>
NBA comparison: Kevon Looney</p>

<p><strong>Strengths</strong>: Has an NBA-ready frame … Surprising lateral speed for a player with as much muscle mass as he shows … Possesses the body control to get to and finish at the rim … Length could allow him to develop into a small-ball big in the future … Was an interior presence defensively, especially as the weak side defender … Flashed solid footwork understanding on the offensive end … Sees and makes the extra pass … Monster on the offensive boards … Can keep possessions alive with rebounds and will convert second-chance opportunities into baskets … Ally oop threat, likely to make plenty of highlight plays on lob passes.</p>

<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>:  A little bit stiff in his movements and running the floor … Thick legs … Doesn’t always exhibit an ideal level of intensity … His effort was very up-and-down during his stint in college… While he has the tools to become a quality defender, was slow at times reacting on defense … Post skills are extremely raw and in need of refinement.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: &amp;gt;!-&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;OG Anunoby&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-!&amp;lt;</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>Player #2</strong><br>
Position: Power Forward/Center<br>
NBA comparison: Nikola Vucevic</p>

<p><strong>Strengths</strong>: Tremendous length … Can really shoot the ball … Has shown tremendous improvement in his body … Possesses a big wingspan … Shows a winning attitude, competes hard in games and practices … A self starter, doesn’t need to constantly be pushed to get the most of his abilties.</p>

<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: Needs to improve as a post player, gain strength and develop a repertoire of back to the basket moves … His length is a big plus, but he’ll need to continue to work on becoming stronger and learn to anticipate in order to overcome his lack of quickness.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: &amp;gt;!-&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;Nikola Jokic&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!&amp;lt;</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>Player #3</strong><br>
Position: Point Guard/Shooting Guard<br>
NBA comparison: Flip Murray/Delonte West</p>

<p><strong>Strengths</strong>: Long and wiry combo guard … A crafty ballhandler that knows how to get defenders off balance with the dribble … Advanced offensively with the ability to pull up off the dribble and he also attacks the rim aggressively …  Has a good repertoire of moves and mixes them up well to keep the defense guessing … A scoring point, but has enough pg skills to play the position on the NBA level … Very quick, athletic and explosive, gets by his man and to the rim with ease …  He has a deceptive 1st step and shifty quickness making him difficult to contain on the perimeter … Uses his body as well as his length to finish around the basket … Likes to pull up from the midrange where he shoots with balance and good rhythm.</p>

<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: Played out of position for the majority of the season, and struggled finding his comfort zone … He shoots off the side of his head with the shooting elbow way out, as a result his shot is all over the place … He does not have the superb athleticism or strength like many other combo guards … Tends to waste dribbles on the perimeter, killing the flow of the offense because he can be a ball stopper at times … Settles for contested jumpshots from outside and takes a lot of fading and offbalance attempts inside &hellip; Must get stronger physically, to be able to finish off drives as well as shoot with more consistency.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: &amp;gt;!-&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Jrue Holiday&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;!&amp;lt;</p>

<p>​</p>

<p><strong>Player #4</strong><br>
Position: Small Forward<br>
NBA comparison: Jared Dudley</p>

<p><strong>Strengths</strong>:  He is absolutely relentless going to the rim on straight line drives, having the ability to overpower defenders and create space with sheer physicality that also allows him to finish through contact … He has excellent body control and can absorb contact at the rim without having his shot very affected. In space he can also finish above the rim with authority even when challenged at the basket, and he is good vertical athlete &hellip; has a versatile offensive skillset that teams had an extremely difficult time figuring out … He is excellent isolation player … He can score from all three levels, via at the rim, in the mid range area, and from beyond the arc &hellip; He is also a much improved playmaker, doing an especially solid job in drive and kick situations … When chased off the line, he has an outstanding pull-up game … He has deep range and can bury contested shots off the dribble … He also is great at creating space via jab steps and step back jumpers &hellip; Also shows flashes of terrific vision whether kicking out to open shooter or to big men ducking in the low post … In addition, it is difficult to ignore the advanced mental aspects of his game.</p>

<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: The biggest question at this stage is how much his less than stellar length will hold him back in the NBA …  It is also uncertain whom he will be able to guard at the next level with his lack of elite length or quickness, which causes him to struggle containing quicker guards off the dribble … He probably will not be able to rely on isolation scoring in the NBA, but much of his offense came from these types of plays … He will need to show that he can bring more to the table than shot making if he wants to be a reliable rotational player in the NBA.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: &amp;gt;!-&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;Dillon Brooks&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-!&amp;lt;</p>

      <label for="lcv1ad5" class="commentText"><p>My personal favorite:</p>

<p>NBA Comparison: Michael Jordan</p>

<p>Strengths: Special player. Extremly gifted athlete. Great ball handler. Very advanced shooter and scorer for his age. A showstopper. Can play the 1 or 2. Won the McDonald’s High School dunk contest. Super character. As NBA ready as any HS player in his class.</p>

<p>Weaknesses: Tries to do too much at times. Learning how to be a consumate team player, something his idol Kobe still must learn himself. Gets criticized for being too fancy, still has alot of basketball to learn.</p>
