Nike&rsquo;s decision to make Kobes only accessible to resellers created a need for a &ldquo;kobe like&rdquo; shoe for people who actually want to hoop in them instead of resell.

      <label for="ln7rexs" class="commentText"><p>Super sneaker head here -</p>

<p>Adidas did a big RnD job when they lost Jimmy Buttler to Nike, and someone in the company said &ldquo;fuck this, we are doing it from scratch&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took a couple of years, and then they released Harden Series</p>

<p>Vol 1 were a shy release, but then Vol 2 happened</p>

<p>Vol 2 are still the best basketball shoes of all time - and I am not even exaggerating.</p>

<p>First of all - they made them indestructible. I have 4 pairs, first ones (black camo) were used for basketball, on concrete, later for hiking, I could probably use them for land mine testing at this point</p>

<p>The sole had a wide base to prevent ankle twist, grip &amp; traction pattern was <a href="https://static.ftshp.digital/img/p/1/4/5/8/0/2/145802-full_product.jpg" target="_blank">weird</a> but did 100% good job, comfort was over the charts, like walking over clouds.</p>

<p>At that point in time, they signed Mitchell and Trae, but their shoes were not as good as Hardens. The main issue was that they used that idiotic mash material for upper, that tore on both Mitchell and Trae series.</p>

<p>Lillard ones were like completely different studio designed them. For example, Dame 6 had some <a href="https://img.cdn-cnj.si/img/500/500/nF/nFIgNUfQAn5.webp" target="_blank">weird sticker</a> on top, that does not cover the entire toe area, so you would have guaranteed tear-up on the upper near the toes, around that sticker</p>

<p>For some reason, even Harden Vol 3, Vol 4 and Vol 5 (WTF??) were failures, resembling Trae&rsquo;s line, but they realized what made Vol 2 so good, so they made the Vol 6</p>

<p>As you may know - it was also a low sales shoe. But it was basically Vol 2 redesigned. It was a superb shoe that somehow got skipped by Sneaker people</p>

<p>But Adidas did not abandon the recipe, and made Vol 7 and Vol 8 on the same premise, which were a huge success.</p>

<p>That recipe was done for AE1. The main selling point was to make upper from stronger materials than cloth, as you can see on every following model</p>

<p><a href="https://dunkshop.rs/media/catalog/product/cache/ef1a6d8154c8788391ddf2efd95c1f77/h/a/harden-vol._7-stormtrooper-hq3425.jpg" target="_blank">Vol 7</a></p>

<p><a href="https://dunkshop.rs/media/catalog/product/cache/ef1a6d8154c8788391ddf2efd95c1f77/a/d/adidas-harden-vol-8-after-hours-ig6648.jpg" target="_blank">Vol 8</a></p>

<p><a href="https://assets.adidas.com/images/h_840,f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy,c_fill,g_auto/73a000b08a1d4cbca81b6a1a434f9bee_9366/Anthony_Edwards_1_Best_Of_Adi_Basketball_Shoes_White_IF1857_01_standard.jpg" target="_blank">AE1</a></p>

<p><a href="https://snkrdunk.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/en/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/20094436/4.-adidas-Dame-9.webp" target="_blank">Dame 9</a></p>

<p>ATM I have 4 pairs of Vol 2, 1 pair of Vol 6, 1 pair of Vol 7, 1 pair of AE1 and I can not stress enough how good those product lines are better than literally anything that Nike / Jordan have at the moment.</p>

<p>Luka&rsquo;s are bad, someone from Nike is hung up on nostalgia and makes every single Kobe model look basically the same, Tatum&rsquo;s are somewhat good but no where near as durable as, for example Vol 7 or AE1, and Lebron&rsquo;s stopped being basketball shoes after 19</p>

<p>This recipe that Adidas figured out is here to stay. Nike needs to up their game to compete.</p>

      <label for="ln6gm4r" class="commentText"><p>Adidas just needs to fix their sizing because their shoes are actually amazing. I wear size 11 but bought a Harden Vol 7 in the size 10 since it had over 50% discount and was the last available size. To my surprise, despite the internal booty, it fit my feet better than my size 11 LeBron 20s lol</p>

<p>There were a couple of d roses that were awesome and then adidas basically gave up on them but still produced them.</p>

<p>My biggest issue at the adidas store is no returns if you wear them. That’s utter bullshit. I have weird feet and just can’t risk buying their basketball shoes anymore.  But I wear pretty much ONLY ultraboost for my daily shoes.</p>

<p>Nike, meanwhile offers between 30-90 days no questions asked returns. I’ve stocked up on pg4s that should last me basically rest of my playing days.</p>

I remember their Crazy Lites getting a ton of hype when I was in high school though, and I thought they felt really poor compared to Nike&rsquo;s Hyperdunk.</p>

<p>Mitchell&rsquo;s though ironically never seemed to have taken off.  He hasn&rsquo;t been the marketing darling they had hoped for.  I&rsquo;ve never really seen much buzz for his shoes outside the initial release.</p>

I pay no attention to the shoe game and don&rsquo;t have a player I root for enough to warrant supporting their brand over anyone else, so I just got what I thought looked good. Ended up going with the D.O.N. Issue 4 and played in them for the first time this afternoon. They were nice even with no break in and standard insoles.</p>

      <label for="ln6y8i1" class="commentText"><p>Industrial designer here that has done professional sporting gear:</p>

<p>It depends on the player. Many players assume oh the company has designers that are pros at this. But the reality is sooo many things go into making a product and they vary from product to product. As with all things, if you put care in, you get results. If a player is like “you figure it out, it’s your job” of course the artists and engineers don’t know exactly what to execute, and you end up with an inferior product. When Kobe designed his shoes, he was constantly trying, testing, and communicating. He’d take a prototype pair, and would use sand paper to shave off a little here or and say he needed a bit more material there. He was passionate and pushed for the results he wanted. Even the worlds most skilled designers have nowhere near the industry specific expertise a pro will have. When giving Tiger a set of custom made clubs, he can pick them up and wave them around. He could tell if there was an air bubble deep in the metal with just a wave of the club. He’ll just say something like “something’s off with this one” take the two good ones and then a team will scan the other club and see there was a manufacturing error invisible to everyone other than him.</p>

      <label for="ln78cn5" class="commentText"><p>Stefan Janoski drove Nike designers nuts designing his skate shoe. Granted, not the same tech; the balance of function, comfort, and looks doesn&rsquo;t happen often, and when it does there&rsquo;s an aspect of &lsquo;luck&rsquo;. The Janoski became Nike&rsquo;s best selling skate shoe despite their doubts, and is among Jordans and Lebrons for top selling Signature-Models. Only problem is that R&amp;D budget/time window is probably getting smaller every season. Skating is even starting to get it&rsquo;s own throwbacks and re-issues of skate shoes from the late 90s.</p>

Especially if your boss is Nike higher ups, and &lsquo;the talent&rsquo; is being really stubborn with their design. In the end it&rsquo;s Nike SB&rsquo;s golden goose, Adidas is maybe neck and neck with them, but the Janoski is a standard shoe style now, compared to most of their other models being re-issues.</p>

      <label for="ln6o1bu" class="commentText"><p>Every shoe fits differently for every person still though. I’m a huge fan of the Kyrie 2s. Because of this I tried all the others afterwards, and none are nearly as good for me. So I actually kinda dislike Kyries now. But I’m always looking for 2s that aren’t a disgusting colorway. Tbh I think it’s the strap. If anybody reading this knows some basketball shoes with a similar strap, please let me know!</p>

<p>if the shoes were designed specifically for Trae, maybe it makes sense? look at the photos in the link&hellip;he&rsquo;s always got double ankle braces on.</p>

<p>they&rsquo;re horrendous.  I have the black and white ones and aesthetically it&rsquo;s one of my favorite, but I cannot bring myself to wear them, even casually.  After like two hours in that shoe I feel like I need to amputate my foot</p>

      <label for="ln72hjd" class="commentText"><p>My lukewarm take is Trae is doing it to himself by not demanding a trade. Trae is tight with Hawks ownership, so he’s had less personal incentive to put his foot down and ensure he’s on a competitive roster. If he doesn’t get out soon he’ll just become another Bradley Beal. His claim to fame is beating the Knicks and 76ers and right now neither team would even want him. He’s a great player but he’s too comfortable being cushy with the Hawks owners instead of trying to win championships</p>
