      <label for="l99tmrv" class="commentText"><p>NBC is not putting the women’s team over the popular sports 1) track and field, 2) swimming, and 3) gymnastics, regardless of how popular Clark is in the WNBA. Let&rsquo;s be honest a big part of her appeal to new fans is because she is different outside of being extremely talented. She&rsquo;s a white heterosexual, midwest girl-next-door type of person, that relates with people more than they do with the other white players. She&rsquo;s the great white hope for a lot of people. That does a lot stateside. The rest of the world doesn&rsquo;t give a shit about what she did in college, or what she looks like it&rsquo;s all about is she an amazing player right now. Which she&rsquo;s not but in the future she probably be and can raise interest in the world.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is true, but it&rsquo;s definitely a moot point either way.  NBC is not making decisions about what they put on prime time American television based on what the rest of the world thinks.  The programming that will air in the US will be specifically for the US audience.  Other parts of the world will see other programs. Not to mention that primetime in the US is like 1-5 AM in Europe and 6-10 AM in Asia.  Even if they had one global broadcast, they&rsquo;re not going to be concerned with what the tiny international audience watching TV at that time thinks.</p>

      <label for="l99icue" class="commentText"><p>This makes zero sense. A small group of people on the women&rsquo;s Olympic committee make a decision that you don&rsquo;t agree with, and therefore you think WNBA players who are not on this committee (and when Dave portnoy made a very similar comment after this news he was referencing women writ large), they should not be able to complain about their working conditions?</p>

<p>Why on earth do WNBA players have to own a decision made by an Olympic committee for which they have no agency on? That makes about as much sense as you having to own it because you&rsquo;re from America.</p>

No basketball player WNBA or NBA is going to be considered as having accomplished something based off of stats like these over 15 games their rookie season. I mean should Ben Simmons have gotten a team USA invite bc he went on that undefeated run his rookie season? I bet you he was top 5 in apg that year too lol and that would’ve been for an entire season not 15 games</p>

<p>Like bro she has an illustrious college career why do we need to try to mythologize her brand new wnba career, its okay that she’s not immediately 2016 Curry</p>

When it stops being about competition and merit you have a tv show instead of a sport. The same people arguing for the sport to be more of a product will abandon it and lose interest sooner than those who’ve contributed to its organic growth in recent years.</p>

<p>It would be doing her a huge disservice honestly and make a bit of a mockery of the whole thing. She&rsquo;s be torn to bits if she was recruited to the team because of her drawing power.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s next, putting women on teams because they hot?</p>

<p>They should go off skill and nothing else. She will get her time.</p>

      <label for="l99lnuw" class="commentText"><p>I’m assuming this is sarcasm since Christian Laettner was on the 92 dream team.</p>

<p>I think Clark is much closer to the worst player on this women’s Olympic roster than Laettner was to the best player he replaced on the 92 dream team.</p>

<p>Laettner was selected as a nod to the tradition when only college athletes could play basketball in the Olympics. This wouldn’t be the reason to select Clark.</p>

<p>While I think more people would’ve watched to see Clark in the Olympics than to see people talk non stop about how she isn’t there ultimately the WNBA is getting a boost from her during regular season games.</p>

<p>It’s fine for the WNBA to select other players and she’ll likely be in the next one</p>

The first NBA Olympic team was amazing I’m a NY’er yes I loved seeing Patrick Ewing out there but I really enjoyed the whole team. She’ll get her chance. Yes the men and women are dominate already. I seriously doubt there will be more eyeballs watching the freaking OLYMPICS just because she’s there. <sup>100</sup>&frasl;<sub>200</sub> meter dash. It was great seeing Usain Bolt but he’s no longer there and I’m still
Going to watch. Root for any Americans in the heats don’t know them well but I sure will be cheering them on. I say that to say once Usain wasn’t there it was still the premier event. That’s why it’s on the last day (or couple of days of the Olympics)</p>

      <label for="l99mbk9" class="commentText"><p>Barring injuries yeah. The last notable snub was Ogwumike in Tokyo. MVP winner, one of the best defenders in the league, and they left her off for a questionable injury in favour of Napheesa Collier even though she trained with them and played at all the FIBA events. I know a lot of people are only just starting to follow the WNBA but USA Basketball has a much more checkered history with the women&rsquo;s team compared to the men&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The most headscratching part is that snubbing vets for unproven rookies is actually really common with USA Basketball. You can criticise that all you want (and fair enough) but it&rsquo;s absurd that they&rsquo;d stop that practice now when the rookie in question is the greatest prospect of all time.</p>

<p>And if someone wants to say &ldquo;what about Laettner? He was on the team before he proved himself&rdquo; I think it was dumb for team USA to do that back then too.</p>

<p>As was said Laettner was included for sentimental reasons. It was basically a nod to the fact that the USA couldn&rsquo;t send pros to the Olympics until the Dream Team and including a collegiate star would appease the traditionalists.</p>

      <label for="l99l6v8" class="commentText"><p>Davis was picked due to the lack of depth for American bigs in the NBA at the time. And injuries.</p>

<p>Howard and Bosh would have been the main two options at the 5 but were both injured.</p>

<p>They just went with Tyson Chandler as the starting center. And Blake Griffin and Kevin Love were the back up centers despite being undersized.</p>

<p>Blake got injured so Davis replaced him.</p>

<p>Garnett and Duncan should probably have been picked over Davis but I guess they refused. Outside of them, I can&rsquo;t really think of anyone notable. Maybe Bynum? Not sure if he was injured at the time though.</p>

<p>By the way, USA played small ball and one of LeBron,KD or Melo played the 4 mostly.</p>

<p>Edit: but after googling, turns out I misremembered and that only happened cause of injuries… TIL</p>

Selling out on a player shooting 38% from the field and 32% from three just doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s the right play. I guess the logic is the team is the rest of the team is so bad, you can afford to,  but still.</p>

<p>If people are going to argue Clark&rsquo;s numbers are not good enough to warrant a spot it&rsquo;s fair to ask how Taurasi&rsquo;s are when again they are basically the same.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s obviously more to it than just shooting splits, but we are talking about a women&rsquo;s national team who hasn&rsquo;t lost a game in the Olympics ever and whose average margin of victory is something like 30 points. Having Clark on the team would have guaranteed eye balls on the games. She&rsquo;s the biggest draw, we have easily the best team, to leave her off is silly when she could bring so much more attention to women&rsquo;s basketball.</p>

She&rsquo;s not absolutely dominating like she did in NCAA, but she&rsquo;s in no way disappointing either. I guess they just need something to talk about.

      <label for="l99cfut" class="commentText"><p>The travesty isn&rsquo;t about basketball, but purely for a business perspective. Not having the biggest draw on the Olympic team is a massive mistake financially to not include the biggest name in the sport who&rsquo;s been on everyone&rsquo;s radar the whole year. I&rsquo;d be curious to know what Adam Silver thinks about her being left the team. Not surprising that the negative publicity increased eyeballs.</p>

<p>It’s a disgusting group</p>

<p>You are conflating the small group of people on the women&rsquo;s Olympic committee with all female basketball players in the WNBA and it is ridiculous on its face.</p>

It absolutely is (for all intents and purposes) the entire WNBA acting like this. And no it&rsquo;s not unfair or sexist to call it what it is. Same thing happened when Lebron came into the league and his own team was super jealous of him and many old stars struggled to accept he was already better than them. Not saying she&rsquo;s the WNBA&rsquo;s Lebron, just that jealousy is not exclusive to women.</p>

<p>What the W players (like Diana Taurasi) criticized was the expectations being put on her by the media and fans stating she&rsquo;d come into the W and dominate and be up for MVP in year one. That&rsquo;s just ignorant.</p>

<p>Diana Taurasi said Caitlin was great and &ldquo;greatness would translate&rdquo; but it would take time and there&rsquo;d be a transition period. And everyone lost their shit and acted like she called Caitlin a loser lol</p>

<p> Edit: when those Cavs players were talking down Lebron before he was drafted everyone was saying that they&rsquo;re just jealous of his attention.</p>

<p>When old players talk down the money and attention that new generations get we say that they&rsquo;re jealous. </p>

<p>When Draymond goes after Gobert we say that he&rsquo;s spiteful that Rudy won those DPOYs.</p>

<p>People were saying that Tatum and Brown were jealous of each other. Or Kyrie was jealous when they made ECFs without him. Or that Westbrook and KD were jealous or Shaq/Kobe&hellip; It goes on.</p>

<p>Those steps are whatever we want them to be. Every Men&rsquo;s Olympic Basketball team has had their reasons for bringing who they brought it and there has never been a defined metric by which one becomes an olympian or not.</p>

<p>CC could just as easily been on this team as she was left off. I&rsquo;m not even a proponent of CC making the olympics, but I just think this whole discourse about it is so off putting because stuff like what KD is saying here is making it seem like there is some step she has to go through when in reality, they just didn&rsquo;t want her. Its as simple as that. Just like the dream team didn&rsquo;t want Isiah Thomas either.</p>

      <label for="l98rffw" class="commentText"><p>Bruh Clark was having a decent rookie year, but still averaging like 15/5/6 on 35% FG and 5 turnovers/game. And like 12 pro games under her belt; i.e. very little pro experience.</p>

<p>If Taurasi was out, there are still better, experienced and way more deserving players than Clark to be on the team.</p>

<p>And frankly, as the 12th player, Clark wouldn&rsquo;t even get much playing time. And then all the media and fangirls/fanboys would be whining about Clark not getting playtime and calling it racist, bigoted, etc&hellip;.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s better for Clark to get some experience and headline the next Olympic team and be one of the starters.</p>

      <label for="l98y7b7" class="commentText"><p>One thing to consider with her stats tho is the Fever had the hardest start to a season in WNBA history.</p>

<p>As their schedule eases up (it&rsquo;s now the easiest remaining sos in the league) her play will continue to improve.</p>

<p>So by the time we actually reach Paris, there&rsquo;s a decent chance Clark has a much better statline. Just the last few games her turnovers are way down and PPG up closer to 20.</p>

To say it’s a skill issue then give a spot to a 42 yr old with the same stats but less efficiency is just kinda wild. Kelsey plus is shooting 37.1%/33.3% this year and nobody is pointing to her efficiency as a reason she shouldn’t have made the team.</p>

      <label for="l9accdx" class="commentText"><p>What’s crazy about this is Clark is in her early 20s. Most of Team USA is in their mid-to-late 20s. She’s just too young to compete against older, more mature players. It’s not a knock on her. She’ll rack up Gold medals in the near future</p>
