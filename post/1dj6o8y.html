<p>And if someone wants to say &ldquo;what about Laettner? He was on the team before he proved himself&rdquo; I think it was dumb for team USA to do that back then too.</p>

<p>As was said Laettner was included for sentimental reasons. It was basically a nod to the fact that the USA couldn&rsquo;t send pros to the Olympics until the Dream Team and including a collegiate star would appease the traditionalists.</p>

Selling out on a player shooting 38% from the field and 32% from three just doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s the right play. I guess the logic is the team is the rest of the team is so bad, you can afford to,  but still.</p>

      <label for="l996tn9" class="commentText"><p>And this season she&rsquo;s shooting 39/35/87 for her splits compared to Clark who is shooting 38/33/91.</p>

<p>If people are going to argue Clark&rsquo;s numbers are good enough to warrant a spot it&rsquo;s fair to ask how Taurasi&rsquo;s are when again they are basically the same.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s obviously more to it than just shooting splits, but we are talking about a women&rsquo;s national team who hasn&rsquo;t lost a game in the Olympics ever and whose average margin of victory is something like 30 points. Having Clark on the team would have guaranteed eye balls on the games. She&rsquo;s the biggest draw, we have easily the best team, to leave her off is silly when she could bring so much more attention to women&rsquo;s basketball.</p>

<p>You also want to ignore that Taurasi made the team as a rookie? Or that since 2000 the women have taken at least one rookie every time until now? You want to ignore that Clark is the biggest draw to the sport? You think team USA is at risk of losing if they had Clark on the team?</p>

<p>Do you want the sport to grow or not? Clark helps grow the sport. It&rsquo;s undeniable that people tune it to watch her. Leaving her off the team is going to lead to less people being interested in watching the women play.</p>

      <label for="l997fvg" class="commentText"><p>So Taurasi gets a spot and forgiveness for her shooting splits because she&rsquo;s old, but Clark doesn&rsquo;t cut because she&rsquo;s young? Taurasi made the Olympic team as a rookie. Every Olympics the USA team took a rookie on the team, but now when it&rsquo;s Clarks turn its about bringing the best women who have experience?</p>

<p>The women&rsquo;s team has an average margin of victory of like 30 points and has never lost a game in the Olympics. The question has to be asked do the women really want their game to grow or not. Leaving Clark off automatically means less people are going to be interested. Every game is basically guaranteed to be a route, so leaving your biggest draw at home because she lacks &ldquo;experience&rdquo; honestly just comes off as petty.</p>

      <label for="l993ni5" class="commentText"><p>What you&rsquo;re ignoring is the WNBA has taken a rookie everytime since like 2000. That&rsquo;s including Taurasi.</p>

<p>Her being on the team wouldn&rsquo;t be like Laettner. She has comparable numbers to other people that were selected over her so if she had been included it isn&rsquo;t like you could point and say she doesn&rsquo;t deserve it and she stole a spot. She&rsquo;s the most popular draw and wouldn&rsquo;t hinder Team USA from dominating the Olympics like they have since their induction. It is silly for them to leave her off when she is easily the biggest draw to the sport right now.</p>

<p>The US has taken other college players or first year rookies (since Clark technically did play a few WNBA games) before who had never played professionally otherwise. Players such as Anthony Davis, Diana Taurasi, and Breanna Stewart. They even kicked Candace Parker off the team in favor of Stewart. </p>

<p>Just listing off players without any context doesn&rsquo;t mean anything.

KD has more points in Olympic basketball than Melo in much fewer games. He’s also been the leading scorer on 3 different Olympic teams. Melo was never the leading scorer on even one I’m believe.</p>

Nobody believes theyre watching a genuine product and they have a million reasons why based on things the nba has done in the past. When it stops being about competition and merit you have a tv show instead of a sport. The same people arguing for the sport to be more of a product will abandon it and lose interest sooner than those who’ve contributed to its organic growth in recent years.</p>

<p>I still think there&rsquo;s proper steps you have to take in our world to be considered an Olympian.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those steps are whatever we want them to be. Every Men&rsquo;s Olympic Basketball team has had their reasons for bringing who they brought it and there has never been a defined metric by which one becomes an olympian or not.</p>

<p>CC could just as easily been on this team as she was left off. I&rsquo;m not even a proponent of CC making the olympics, but I just think this whole discourse about it is so off putting because stuff like what KD is saying here is making it seem like there is some step she has to go through when in reality, they just didn&rsquo;t want her. Its as simple as that. Just like the dream team didn&rsquo;t want Isiah Thomas either.</p>

<p>If Taurasi was out, there are still better, experienced and way more deserving players than Clark to be on the team.</p>

<p>And frankly, as the 12th player, Clark wouldn&rsquo;t even get much playing time. And then all the media and fangirls/fanboys would be whining about Clark not getting playtime and calling it racist, bigoted, etc&hellip;.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s better for Clark to get some experience and headline the next Olympic team and be one of the starters.</p>

      <label for="l98y7b7" class="commentText"><p>One thing to consider with her stats tho is the Fever had the hardest start to a season in WNBA history.</p>

<p>As their schedule eases up (it&rsquo;s now the easiest remaining sos in the league) her play will continue to improve.</p>

<p>So by the time we actually reach Paris, there&rsquo;s a decent chance Clark has a much better statline. Just the last few games her turnovers are way down and PPG up closer to 20.</p>

<p>&rdquo; there are still better, experienced and way more deserving players than Clark to be on the team&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Name one player not on the Olympic team that deserves to be placed ahead of Clark.  I&rsquo;ll answer for you: there isn&rsquo;t one.</p>

<p>Clark deserves to be on the team ahead of Taurasi and the one player with the foot injury that hasn&rsquo;t played all season.</p>

<p>She wasn&rsquo;t on the Olympic team as a rookie. Objectively. It is literally impossible for her to have been on the Olympic team in 2002. No the FIBA team doesn&rsquo;t count. You can just say you made a mistake, it&rsquo;s not that hard.</p>
