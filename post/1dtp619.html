      <label for="lbaw7iu" class="commentText"><p>At this point I don&rsquo;t really see how people think Harden cared about the money. With all the contracts he&rsquo;s turned down, all those &ldquo;next bags&rdquo; he said no to, and now even with LAC he didn&rsquo;t even <em>try</em> to negotiate a bigger deal - he opened his negotiations saying he&rsquo;d take less than $30m a year annual over 3 years and then he settled on a 1+1.</p>

<p>There were plenty of reports that came out saying Harden was also willing to work out a good deal with Morey, but Morey going ghost ruined it.</p>

<p>Fact is dude has so much money coming in from his Adidas deal, from his wine sales, and all of his endeavors in China that the difference in his NBA contract really aint that big of a deal to him. Wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if he signed a 1+1 in LAC to help them retool after this year, too.</p>

      <label for="lbc9ta5" class="commentText"><p>Also until that morey is a liar comment harden had basically never said anything even mildly controversial in public. And idk if I had even ever heard him raise his voice or get angry in public. Which makes me think there’s a 99% chance morey straight up stabbed him in the back, he was like legit emotional. There’s no way he would talk like that if morey hadn’t screwed him over, he’s turned down multiple max extensions before, he wouldn’t be that pissed if they had never discussed it and then morey just didn’t want to max him when the time came.</p>

      <label for="lbc81sl" class="commentText"><p>Yeah think about it in regular people terms. If you had this friend that you had been working your ass off to support for like ten years because you thought you guys were like ride or die, you had always done anything he needed because you thought he’d always have your back, then he asked you for a favor and said he would be there for you for something you needed his help with, you do the favor without question, and then you hurt your hamstring so he ghosts you because you’re not quite as fun to hang out with anymore.</p>

<p>Morey legit worked harden like a rented mule for a decade, harden is like 90% of the reason morey is considered a good gm in the first place, like if your best player has to win the scoring title three years in a row, win or come in second/third in mvp 5 years in a six year stretch, with one season having to average 36 ppg, the most in 30 years while the second leading scorer is at 28 ppg, just to carry your team to 50+ wins you did not put together good teams.</p>

<p>Harden has turned down plenty of money for a better situation, even this year he could’ve definitely got more than <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>70</sub>. And if you read about moreys personal life he’s kind of a narcissistic douche.</p>

<p>Like how do you just ghost the guy that was always at or near the top in minutes played every season while playing like an mvp most years just so he could drag your shitty rosters to 50+ wins?</p>

<p>Not to mention it was after you brought him in to be the second option to the scoring leader and mvp and then he ends up having to hard carry your team again, being the only reason you have a chance up 3-2 by dropping two 40+ bombs on the most stacked roster in the league while the actual mvp was shitting the bed, and then he basically gets 95% of the blame for losing that series because he could only have 2 40+ point games instead of 3 on a bum hamstring.</p>

<p>Jokes on morey though, he let harden go and then they lose in the first round by a total point differential of 1, effectively wasting a year of embiids prime, and then he has to sign a worse player in a deal where he’ll be paying him 50 mil when he’s 48.</p>

Wine has guided rails that you can venture beyond, but to really grasp it a knowledge of those restrictions is essential. Like I know Melo’s wine will be at least a pretty damn good big Napa cab, hardens will probably be sweet and taste pretty disgusting and at most drinkable.</p>

The plan for Morey was to always have cap space this year once they saw that the Harden/Embiid pairing had a ceiling. At least George plays a different way than Harden and is an offball threat and a better defender even though Harden is a much better playmaker.</p>

If your best player has to win the scoring title three years in a row just to drag your rosters to 50+ wins you did not construct a good team.

      <label for="lbcbkms" class="commentText"><p>I still feel like harden and embiid had a way higher ceiling. Harden can make any big look amazing and embiid was an mvp. Harden also basically unlocked maxey, even after his Philly exit maxey said he would never be the player he became if it wasn’t for harden. Embiid was just so used to playing more like a wing than a big. He let so many easy looks go to iso or try to get fouled.</p>

<p>but your right about maxey. it was definitely priceless to have a mentor like that</p>

      <label for="lbceg64" class="commentText"><p>There’s a reason PG was so desperate to sign a max this year, even with a gm who is likely to send him to like Detroit or something in two years, while harden didn’t care at all. PG is declining physically and he knows it, he’s already injury prone, and he’s not nearly as impactful as harden. If he loses a step he’s gonna look terrible</p>

<p>Harden has gotten more athletic every year since the hamstring and is at the very least a 6’5 all time great floor general that can make any offense look like a well oiled machine and is an all time great three point shooter. There’s always gonna be a market for that.</p>

<p>I understand both sides. Harden left a LOT of money on the table for Morey by leaving the nets and taking the pay cut that first year.</p>

<p>He declined too much to be worth a full max plus the penalties of the new CBA made Morey decide to back out.</p>

<p>While I agree with that and Philly did the right thing by not giving Harden a max&hellip; they literally just handed an even larger 4 year max to a different declining player who is even older than Harden was at that time.</p>

<p>The situation is a little different as the Sixers are running out of time with Embiid, but still - the optics of Morey handing George that contract must drive Harden batshit insane.</p>

<p>Morey isn&rsquo;t exactly a paragon of mature and open communication, dude is avoidant as fuck based off stuff we&rsquo;ve seen like the CP3 to OKC situation. Seems like he says whatever he needs to say in the short term to avoid having hard conversations.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t act like a scum bag and then expect him to give you a family discount or whatever. The clips are justified in offering less and PG is justified in taking more money and walking to go to a team where he has basically the same odds to win a title with.</p>

<p>PG has proven that he&rsquo;s more than willing to help out teams that are good to him(see: OKC now).</p>

They had a very bizarre roster construction where they were basically counting on their center as the only dedicated rebounder with no other bigs and just relying on wings and guards to pick up the slack. They really could have used a PF last year (and will again need one this year).</p>

<ol>
<li>Getting the four year max</li>
<li>Staying in California (if possible), and</li>
<li>Staying on the Clippers (if possible).</li>
</ol>

<p>I think he would have liked to have stayed on the Clippers and in California if he could have got the contract he wanted. Or if not from the Clippers, then from the Warriors. But he wasn&rsquo;t able to. And so he left to the Sixers.</p>

      <label for="lbbae1x" class="commentText"><p>I think what a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize as well is, yes PG has made a lot of money in his career.  But this new 4-year deal is equivalent to roughly <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of his total current career earnings (<span class="math inline">\(305MM he's made since 2010 compared to \)</span>212MM he&rsquo;ll make between now and 2028).   That&rsquo;s just a testament to how crazy cap inflation is.</p>

<p>People are arguing that pushing for the extra year makes him greedy, considering he&rsquo;s already rich.  But it&rsquo;s a weird argument imo.  Very few max-level players take team-friendly deals / paycuts.  Especially when they&rsquo;re arguably the most noteworthy FA on the market.</p>

Cursory google says about 13% income tax to approx 3% income tax. Pretty sure that only matters for home games but still works out to an additional $10m over the life of the contract if I&rsquo;m doing the math right.</p>

<p>An extra $50m does sound pretty appealing when you package it up like that lol</p>

<p>The Clippers will probably have their season end in the exact same spot this year - they&rsquo;ll make the playoffs, probably lose in the first round, but they won&rsquo;t be committed to an old ass PG making way too much money.</p>

<p>But yes, PG been coasting on reputation in a lot of ways. He’s not some 2 way stud anymore. He’s a great floor spacer, shoots the hell out of the ball, and he can create his own jumpers. But his defense is nowhere near as good, he doesn’t get to the hoop, and he doesn’t do any of the little things anymore.</p>

<p>That being said, the Clippers statement about the 2nd apron was kinda horse shit lol. They were willing to give him 3 years. Which together with Kawhi and Harden puts them over the 2nd apron for <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub> and <sup>25</sup>&frasl;<sub>26</sub>. In the 4th year their cap sheet is very clean, they could be out of the 2nd apron easily. Not saying they should have offered the 4th year, but offering 3 instead of 4 is not because of the apron</p>

<ol>
<li>The Clippers got 1 year of Harden + Kawhi + PG and none of those guys are getting any better. That should be a title window opportunity, but Kawhi wasn&rsquo;t healthy so it&rsquo;s wasted.</li>
<li>The pick and swap the Clippers gave up in 28 and 29 could end up be REALLY REALLY good. Kawhi and Harden will probably be gone by then, and the Clippers don&rsquo;t seem like they&rsquo;ll have any opportunity to bring in young talent between now and then. Unless they find some gold in free agency those picks are soooooooo dangerous. Even if Embiid and PG are washed by then, that can be what you need to bring in a new star to play with Maxey.</li>

      <label for="lbbradf" class="commentText"><p>The Clippers have had 15 winning seasons in a row and their front office has shown they&rsquo;re able to turn limited assets into a lot (see: Chris Paul leaving and no assets or stars making the playoffs, pushing the peak Warriors to 6, and getting Kawhi/PG a year later), so odds are better those picks won&rsquo;t be all that great.</p>

      <label for="lbbtwu0" class="commentText"><p>This like saying that you flipped a coin 15 times and they were all heads, so the next 5 times will definitely be heads as well. Maybe they will figure it out, but just because they have recently doesn&rsquo;t mean they always will. You need to be able to independently evaluate the situation as it is currently, which means looking at the dearth of long term assets alongside the recent success.</p>

      <label for="lbawgc5" class="commentText"><p>The contract is different for the Sixers than it was for the Clippers.</p>

<p>If the Clippers offered it, it would have severe consequences due to the new CBA. For the Sixers, they know that the contract will likely age poorly. But they need to maximize the last of Embiid&rsquo;s prime and believe that PG (unlike Harden) is the player to do it. If he&rsquo;s not, then once the contract is over, Embiid&rsquo;s prime will probably be over. And they can just rebuild around Maxey. And unlike the Clippers, the Sixers aren&rsquo;t affected by the consequences of the new CBA.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reason the Sixers were the only team to offer that contract to PG. It&rsquo;s not because the Clippers are dumbasses. It&rsquo;s because the Sixers are desperate.</p>

<p>Morey probably had a ton of plans; like loading up on depth ($49M can be split up into like 3+ impact pieces… KCP, DJJ, Naji, Miles Bridges, Melton, etc — some of those guys) if star hunting didn’t work out.</p>
