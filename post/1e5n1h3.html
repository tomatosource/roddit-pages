<blockquote>
<p>David Griffin: So I would have told you coming into the offseason that his value was incredibly high.</p>

<p>David Griffin later on: When you don&rsquo;t have to pay them, you want all of them</p>

<p>Griffin later (not precisely talking about Ingram, but potentially implied): There are a lot of guys [under this new CBA] mechanically incapable of being traded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have to feel that this (keeping Ingram) wasn&rsquo;t the plan at all and the Pels expected to get a lot back for him&hellip; I have no idea how Murray-Ingram-Zion is supposed to work on offense, and it&rsquo;s kind of a mess defensively with no center.</p>

<p>Griffin also says that New Orleans is too small of a market to give everyone a max and that the Pelicans and Ingram&rsquo;s agency are not seeing eye to eye on the value of his next extension.</p>

<p>He was on the bench whenever he could post injury and vibes were always good.  Before his surgery he had a few games where he came back and fit pretty well into the offense.  Let coby continue handling it and everything.  The awkwardness came from press releases about him being open to being traded and then when it came out he was having a season ending surgery after the rumored trade to detroit</p>

<p>The worst he’s done was a somewhat public disagreement with Billy Donovan after he was benched in the 4th and that was the year prior.</p>

      <label for="ldnbpyl" class="commentText"><p>Everyone gave the Spurs shit for essentially not taking the same package for Leonard. Mostly because they wanted Kawhi and LeBron together and thought the Spurs were being petty in simply not dealing with the Lakers.</p>

<p>Its only rumored that package was on the table - nothing substantiated, the Spurs probably had little interest dealing with LA for franchise rivalry reasons and because that&rsquo;s where he wanted to go and the whole shit show debacle to get himself there. And just the extended payout as the Spurs <em>still</em> have pending assets in FRPs.</p>

<p>Honestly, it all worked out for <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> the teams &ldquo;involved&rdquo;. Spurs got a boatload of assets (eventually) and then tanked for Wemby. The Lakers pivoted to acquiring AD and won a title with him. The Raps got their &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t matter/had sex&rdquo; title. Only NOLA made out poorly, but they had the assets - they just didn&rsquo;t spend them well.</p>

<p>NOLA will get a positive return on Ingram if they commit to trading him. It may not be what they want, but he&rsquo;s too talented to be the type of &ldquo;attach an asset to dump his contract&rdquo; guy.</p>

<p>But this sounds like they are going to roll with him and pretend they weren&rsquo;t trying to trade him. That&rsquo;s a recipe for a toxic environment. If they win, well winning soothes alot of strife, but even if all goes well, is this a conference finals team? If Zion and BI are both hurt and miss time, it could get explosively ugly. Fortunately they have added the calming influence of always professional and level headed Dejounte Murray to the mix&hellip;.Kinda feel bad for CJ here if shit goes sideways - he&rsquo;s going to have the impossible task of being that guy on the team that tries to keep everyone on the same page. They could win 50 and be a force in the playoffs. They could crater. I think they have enough talent that the &ldquo;other guys&rdquo;  can keep them respectable. It will be interesting, though.</p>

<p>We won 49 games last year while being 0-24 in games we were losing going into the 4th. This team is good, they won&rsquo;t move Ingram in a move that makes them worse. Even if that means letting him walk.</p>

<p>CJ&rsquo;s OK at the 1 but he&rsquo;s really not prototypical and looks for his shot too much sometimes over making the pass. Murray might actually be better at running the point but even then he&rsquo;s still more of a combo guard. And yeah, they need to find a big.</p>

<p>Either way, Griffin knows he has to pay BI at some point - it&rsquo;s the only option.</p>

<p>ETA: well, since NOP apparently doesn&rsquo;t want to spend into the luxury to try and win this group, I spoke to soon on paying BI being the only option - might be better to move some of the major pieces while they still have value and reset</p>

      <label for="ldmzpi0" class="commentText"><p>The problem with the Pels right now is that the only guys that they&rsquo;re looking to trade are BI and CJ, who both are making 30M+. Players like Wendell Carter Jr and Jarrett Allen aren&rsquo;t making any more than 20 so the salary matches aren&rsquo;t going to work.</p>

<p>It hasn&rsquo;t been spoken about a lot, but they need to get off of CJ as well (don&rsquo;t see the fit with DJM in the backcourt). I don&rsquo;t know who would want CJ at his current contract (2 years left on his deal), but if you can break his contract into smaller salaries then that would give you some trade flexibility.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you&rsquo;re looking at something like Jarrett Allen + Caris Levert for BI or Johnathan Issac + Wendell Carter Jr for BI. I don&rsquo;t think either Orlando or Cleveland would want to do that.</p>

Until it looks like we can contend, they aren’t going to pay it just to pay it and I’m sure she’ll never dive head first into it like a golden state did.

And your results had been significantly better ahead of that point in terms of regular season finishes and playoffs. And then from there you paid to keep the team together and try to pull it off again. If we had similar results and she was just unwilling to pay to try to sustain/improve that’d be one thing, but no owner is jumping eagerly into the tax for an eight seed that has been in the play-in three years straight.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t disagree, which leads directly back to this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if NOP aren&rsquo;t going to pay into the tax what&rsquo;s the point of even trying to contend?</p>

<p>When you have an All Star level player like BI who&rsquo;s at the point of getting paid, you have to pick one at some point.</p>

      <label for="ldnapaf" class="commentText"><p>I mean if BI was playing like the guy he was when he was an all star, we probably would have paid him or been able to trade him for quality players. What he’s been in recent history, an okay efficiency (if that) mid range scorer that’s somewhat of a ball stopper, is incredibly tough to fit into any team but especially one that features Zion Williamson. Like if he got back to shooting the number of shots from three and at the rim he took his all star year, no one would doubt he’s worth the max, but for some reason it hasn’t happened and the guy he’s been particularly last year stands a real risk of becoming a significantly negative contract if you pay too much and everyone in the league realizes it and in our position, being stuck on a bad contract who’s a questionable fit at best alongside Zion would severely handicap our team building.</p>

<p>The team and BI has yet to prove they are the kind of talent to justify that kind of commitment. If BI had proven he was the “all-star level” guy and they still wouldn’t do it sure, but that all star level talent has regressed since his singular injury replacement all-star nod and he has never looked like a good fit alongside Zion for significant stretches. That’s just the reality. You paid Middleton and you still weren’t predicted to be a tax team heading into the next year as well as the fact you were coming off 60 wins and a conference finals appearance. That’s the situation you consider the luxury tax and if she didn’t pay it then criticize away. We haven’t even gotten close to that and until we do get something resembling a successful team for the foreseeable future, they won’t pay it and the reality is almost all the small market teams are in the same boat in that regard.</p>

<p>That’s a giant hole on their roster, and an Ingram trade is the most likely avenue to address that need.</p>
