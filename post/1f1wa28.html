      <label for="lk29zj4" class="commentText"><p>Great effort, but this is more on their longevity of chances to win than the peak possibility of winning. For example, Lillard was not going to win anyway in 2020, and whether they ran into the Lakers (the actual champion) does not really matter.</p>

<p>Charles Barkley is often regarded as the greatest player to never win, not because of how many chances he got, but because of how good his peak version was (peak Barkley was arguably the best player among all you listed), and because of how good his best chance was.</p>

<p>And his best chance might very well be the best ever. The 1993 Suns team was so good that they took the Jordan Bulls to 6 games with every game decided within 10 points. One of those games went to triple overtime. They were 1 point away from forcing a game 7 because of John Paxson&rsquo;s game winner. In game 2 Barkley got 42/13/4 and they still lost by just 3 points, because Jordan had 42/12/9. In fact, Jordan had to average a ridiculous 41/8/6 for 6 games to beat Barkley and his Suns in an insanely tight series.</p>

<p>Among all the players you listed and all their good chances, Barkley might have the absolute best chance in 1993. He might be the closest to a ring and he was still ringless. That is why many see him as the greatest player to never win.</p>

      <label for="lk2hc1u" class="commentText"><p>this is a feelings thing and not a numbers thing but wasn&rsquo;t peak Malone good competition for peak Barkley? and those Jazz teams were no joke. but I have a very similar/high praise for Malone as Barkley. they were both incredibly dominant players in their position for their time. you could argue Malone had Stockton help to inflate his numbers but it doesn&rsquo;t take away his accomplishments</p>

      <label for="lk2quh3" class="commentText"><p>Yes especially the 1997 Jazz team I believe was very close.</p>

<p>I was only using Barkley as an example to illustrate why peak performance and peak chances are more important. He is the best example I can think of because he did not have many real chances.</p>

<p>Some believe Karl Malone was the best to never win. Some say Patrick Ewing. I have no problem with it. That was not what I was trying to argue.</p>

      <label for="lk28iy5" class="commentText"><p>I have to thank you for this exercise, OP. One of the reasons ring culture has dumbed down NBA discourse is that it encourages the lazy pointing at rings to discuss the careers of various players as opposed to the actual circumstances that each player faced. The argument that a ring and a ring alone means a single player has a better legacy is utter nonsense. Not all rings are achieved equally. It is better to look at the totality of a career rather than just who did and didn&rsquo;t get a ring.</p>

      <label for="lk2qruz" class="commentText"><p>But they you get into more details like how injured the competition was, how good your teammates were and so on.</p>

<p>Not all rings are equal, but most have about equal value.</p>

<p>The Cavs for instance beat the Warriors in 7 in 2016 and thats considered an impressive ring because of who they beat at the end, but before that they didnt really face any tough competition from the east and the Warriors just finished a tough 7 game series where they were down 3-1. And if not for Draymond being Draymond, its arguable if they even win it.</p>

<p>Same goes for the 2015 Warriors.</p>

<p>Its pointless to argue a rings individual value to a players legacy because it has a ton of variables&hellip;except KDs 2 rings with the Warriors (i will mever respect those).</p>

      <label for="lk2shi6" class="commentText"><p>Those details matter and we should absolutely discuss them. But the reason we don&rsquo;t necessarily ding the entirety of LeBron&rsquo;s career by noting the mitigating circumstances behind the 3-1 comeback is we can still acknowledge and point to his extensive history of dominance and excellent play against all kinds of competition in the postseason.</p>

<p>After he joined the Heat, there was straight up no real competition for hik in the east.</p>

<p>And in the end what you are saying is that you value his rings as rings without any asterisks.</p>

<p>&hellip;I&rsquo;m not saying that at all&hellip;</p>

<p>LeBron beat up on shit teams. He also beat up on objectively good to great teams in both conferences. Just because the Eastern Conference had nothing on the West in terms of competitiveness doesn&rsquo;t mean LeBron wasn&rsquo;t beating up real competition on the way (LeBron actually faced more Top 10 net rating teams on the way to the Finals in 2016 than the Warriors did fwiw).</p>

      <label for="lk27111" class="commentText"><p>Things that get swept under the rug here IMO are things like Bowen staying in against the Suns despite trying to injure their players, or the bench clearing that unreasonably punished the Suns and suspended Amare and Diaw despite San Antonio doing the same previously with Timmy D, IIRC</p>

<p>Nash always has an iffy record by the numbers but looking at how the Suns were treated by opposing teams and officials makes me respect their runs more than many other &ldquo;could’ve been&rdquo; teams</p>

      <label for="lk27upe" class="commentText"><p>Amare literally left the bench ready to swing and had to be held back and pulled off the court until Dantoni put his hands on him and calmed him down. Duncan was already a player on the court and came in after the teams had swarmed around Horry, Manu, Bell, and Diaw. It was harsh to suspend them but what Duncan and Amare did was not the same.</p>

      <label for="lk24m15" class="commentText"><p>Interesting analysis but I wonder if it shows anything as if rn.</p>

<p>Maybe an interesting idea is to compare it to some of the other goats now with championships and see how often they lost to eventual champions or finalists, but ofc it would be skewed because they had the advantage of being the champion some years.</p>
