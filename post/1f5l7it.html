</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><strong>LIST</strong></p>

<p>1.Averaged 48.5 minutes per game in regular season. (With a large sample size)(not only 2 games)</p>

<p>2.Recorded 55 rebounds in a single game.</p>

<p>3.Averaged 50.4 ppg in regular season. (With a large sample size. Not only 1 or 2 games)</p>

<p>4.Scored 100 points in a single game.</p>

<p>5.Recorded five 50+ points games as a Rookie. (He was MVP as a Rookie!!!)</p>

<p><strong>&ndash;</strong></p>

<p>There are more than 10 unbroken records recorded by Wilt if we will search it one by one.</p>

<p>But the 5 above is what I think are most significant and unbreakable at the same time.</p>

<p>Do you think any of the 5 will be broken?</p>

<p>Maybe #4 will be broken. If there are some superstar there who chuck shots and went for it to reach Kobe&rsquo;s 81 first. And then if he breaks it, then tries to reach Wilt&rsquo;s 100.</p>

      <label for="lkti7p7" class="commentText"><p>As most fans know, Chamberlain has numerous statistical achievements that sound like theyâ€™re straight out of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>Scored 100 points in a game. Had 45 games with 50+ points in a single season, and 118 in his career. Recorded ppg-rpg averages during his first six seasons of 38-27, 38-27, 50-26, 45-24, 37-22, and 34-25. Averaged 22.9 rpg for his career, 27.2 rpg in a season, 32.0 rpg in a playoff series, and once grabbed 55 rebounds in a game. 227 consecutive double-doubles. 124 games with 30 points and 30 rebounds. Eight games with 40 points and 40 rebounds. Only center ever to lead the league in total assists. Had the most unrepeatable triple-double ever: 53-32-14 (huge props to Luka for his 60-21-10 in 2022). Attempted 17.0 free throws per game for a season. Averaged 48.3 mpg in a season, 47.2 for his career in the playoffs, 45.8 for his career in the regular season, and led the league in minutes played eight times. Never fouled out of a game.</p>

      <label for="lkti8sv" class="commentText"><p>Out of all of these, I guess 5 would be the most &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; to break. A really good rookie on a really bad team (say an expansion team) could catch fire his first five games.</p>

<p>But the other 4 just ain&rsquo;t happening.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>No coach would ever allow their player to play 48 minutes a game, that&rsquo;s basically player abuse.</p></li>

<li><p>NBA is too good defensively these days to allow 50 points a game for a whole season.</p></li>

<li><p>No team&rsquo;s missing that many shots to even get 55 rebounds lol. Centers also don&rsquo;t camp in the paint like they used to.</p></li>

<li><p>Until the day someone beats Kobe&rsquo;s 81, I&rsquo;m not convinced Wilt&rsquo;s 100 will ever be beatable. Even with how talented the NBA is today.</p></li>

      <label for="lktjv3p" class="commentText"><p>Yeah the pace of the game is too much for anyone to consistently play 48 a game (and honestly play in enough OTs for it to be over 48.5), players are too good for just one to score almost all their points.</p>

<p>Players are also too big nowadays for one player to grab that many rebounds.</p>

<p>50 ppg is just impossible as nobody can even get to 40 nowadays and even 35+ is super rare in the whple history of the game.</p>

<p>Even having the 5th one would require a talent so great that theyd instantly be considered the greatest prospect to have ever played the game.</p>

<p>Most of his buckets werent exactly too hard to get tbh.</p>

<p>And it was a faster paced era, but not one that was particularly intense for players bodies.</p>

<p>But that said its still 48 minutes of playing basketball.</p>

<p>We forget just how intense playing this sport can be.</p>

<p>He did end up breaking Wilts record for most 40+ games in a row by a rookie</p>

<p>Yes per 100 posessions that works. But thats not how thats donne. Wilt played over 48 minutes a game, while Jordan didnt. Wilt managed that per game, not per 100 posessions.</p>

<p>Thats a big difrence, given that results in general are based on a game to game basis. It doesnt matter if Jordan could outscore Wilt in 100 posessions, when he couldnt do it for 48 minutes of a game.</p>

<p>Now having 8 seasons where he had better per 100 stats is impressive as hell, but Wilt just playong 48 minutes a game for a season is a lot more impressive.</p>

I agree on that.</p>

<p>His de facto 50.4 ppg are also pretty safe.</p>
