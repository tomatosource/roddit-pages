</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><strong>LIST</strong></p>

<p>1.Averaged 48.5 minutes per game in regular season. (With a large sample size)(not only 2 games)</p>

<p>2.Recorded 55 rebounds in a single game.</p>

<p>3.Averaged 50.4 ppg in regular season. (With a large sample size. Not only 1 or 2 games)</p>

<p>4.Scored 100 points in a single game.</p>

<p>5.Recorded five 50+ points games as a Rookie. (He was MVP as a Rookie!!!)</p>

<p><strong>&ndash;</strong></p>

<p>There are more than 10 unbroken records recorded by Wilt if we will search it one by one.</p>

<p>But the 5 above is what I think are most significant and unbreakable at the same time.</p>

<p>Do you think any of the 5 will be broken?</p>

<p>Maybe #4 will be broken. If there are some superstar there who chuck shots and went for it to reach Kobe&rsquo;s 81 first. And then if he breaks it, then tries to reach Wilt&rsquo;s 100.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll give Wilt the officially recorded NBA stats, but pretty much every thing about the man outside of basketball were probably just word of mouth legends that got more and more outrageous.</p>

<p>I’d say Wilt’s legend is far more akin to a fisherman talking about his catch more than some urban legend that wasn’t based in reality. It’s impossible to not admit Wilt was an absolute physical specimen at the extreme end of the bell curve. </p>

      <label for="lkw0wee" class="commentText"><p>So he was good enough to win events as a college athlete in multiple track and field sports, in addition to being an all-time great basketball player? Pretty amazing if you ask me.</p>

<p>And most of the links are just &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t have stats for Wilt&rdquo; or &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t know if he competed in this tournament,&rdquo; not really proof that he wasn&rsquo;t a top athlete. </p>

<p>He was playing pro basketball already at the age of 16, so who knows if he even had time to attend a lot of high school track meets.</p>

<p>Also, there are other sources that say he won more than what you&rsquo;re saying, so I&rsquo;m not sure what to believe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wilt arrived at the Big 8 meet in Kansas City the next day and took a few practice high jumps. While still wearing his warm up jacket and a cap, he leaped 6’6.75”, setting a new Kansas record and first place in the event.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In his KU track and field career, Wilt ran a sub 11-second 100-yard dash, competed in the half-mile and threw the shot 56 feet. Despite his success with sprinting and throwing, his best events were the jumping competitions. He triple jumped in excess of 50 feet and won the Big 8 Conference high jumping event three years in a row, while wearing his signature pork pie hat.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.aloerterbacktoolympus.com/single-post/2020/07/21/the-big-men-of-the-plains" target="_blank">https://www.aloerterbacktoolympus.com/single-post/2020/07/21/the-big-men-of-the-plains</a></p>

<p>However, I agree that there&rsquo;s a lot of myth making and that some of the Wilt stories may be tall tales. He&rsquo;s become a kind of Paul Bunyan folk hero who&rsquo;s larger than life.</p>

<p>Scored 100 points in a game. Had 45 games with 50+ points in a single season, and 118 in his career. Recorded ppg-rpg averages during his first six seasons of 38-27, 38-27, 50-26, 45-24, 37-22, and 34-25. Averaged 22.9 rpg for his career, 27.2 rpg in a season, 32.0 rpg in a playoff series, and once grabbed 55 rebounds in a game. 227 consecutive double-doubles. 124 games with 30 points and 30 rebounds. Eight games with 40 points and 40 rebounds. Only center ever to lead the league in total assists. Had the most unrepeatable triple-double ever: 53-32-14 (huge props to Luka for his 60-21-10 in 2022). Attempted 17.0 free throws per game for a season. Averaged 48.5 mpg in a season, 47.2 for his career in the playoffs, 45.8 for his career in the regular season, and led the league in minutes played eight times. Never fouled out of a game.</p>

      <label for="lktybof" class="commentText"><p>And this right here is why I put Wilt into my top 5.</p>

<p>The best statistical basketball player ever has to be in the top 5. Wilts records are so ridiculous we write off the entire era.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reason a lot of old heads use to have Wilt as the 1st or 2nd best basketball player ever. He was fucking ridiculous.</p>

      <label for="lktzjgp" class="commentText"><p>But here&rsquo;s the rub worth thinking about: For all of the ridiculous stats and abilities he had, it’s a bit odd that Wilt’s new teams consistently did not have a better offense after he showed up, and his old teams consistently did not have a worse offense after he left.</p>

<p>During his first season with the Warriors (‘60) the team’s offensive rating (OffRtg) ranked 7th in the league, and it was 8th the year before (but they also got far more games out of star guards Tom Gola and Guy Rodgers in ‘60 than in ‘59). During his last full season with the Warriors (‘64), their OffRtg was 7th, and it was also 7th in their first full season without him (‘66).</p>

<p>In the Sixers’ first full season with him (‘66), their OffRtg was 6th, and it was also 6th in their last full season without him (‘64). Wilt was traded right in the middle of the ‘65 season, so that’s why I’m not including that year’s ratings. In the Sixers’ last season with Wilt (‘68), their OffRtg was 4th, and it was also 4th in their first season without him (‘69).</p>

<p>In the Lakers’ first season with Wilt (‘69) their OffRtg was 2nd, and it was 1st in their last season without him (‘68).</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t really get one until about 5 seasons in, and bad habits aren&rsquo;t changed overnight.  If he drafted to the Celtics with Red as his coach, things would have been completely different.</p>

<p>One note to people saying Curry breaks the game and isn&rsquo;t a physical freak&hellip;true, but he is merely an outlier in showcasing the absurdness of the current rules and how they cater to guys who can shoot 3&rsquo;s.  Those other guys break the game at a fundamental level that exists for all eras of the sport.</p>

Wilt didn&rsquo;t have blocks or steals recorded so when Jokic had the best PER season that excluded 2 entire counting stats for Wilt and he only barely squeaked it out. The numbers don&rsquo;t actually speak for themselves because they&rsquo;re missing but they&rsquo;re also more believable than Ruth somehow having the furthest hit ball by a long shot considering the entire steroid and juiced ball eras since.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s completely impossible.  But it needs the top tier hoggiest of ball hogs - which probably limits it to  less than 5 guys in the league at a time - having an extreme outlier shooting night, in a game that progresses in such a way it&rsquo;s sensible to keep the guy out there for most of it.  That&rsquo;s an awful lot of things that have to fall into place at the same time.</p>

<p>Not sure which of these are considered “top tier hoggiest of ball hogs” so I kind of disagree with that as well as the overall implication that Kobe fits that description for that particular game. But I think any of those guys can probably end up doing it with the scoring and pacing inflation we’re seeing. Teams overall are scoring up to 30 points more per game today and 15-20 years ago.</p>

<p>There was a noticeable shift in offensive refereeing mid-season that prevented it from getting out of hand, but history says ref memories are weak and we’ll see if it persists into next season.</p>

      <label for="lkvwnpa" class="commentText"><p>Not long ago we Klay Thompson pop off with 37 in a quarter. Ended with 52 points on <sup>16</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub> shooting. A player who pops off with more efficient shooting and 40-50 shots could hit that magical number. I&rsquo;d recon if a player has 70 points going into the 4th quarter, a team might even feed him the ball just for the chance at the historic record.</p>

<p>Last season Embiid scored 70 with <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>41</sub> from the field and <sup>21</sup>&frasl;<sub>23</sub> from the line. The possibility is there but it would be a historic  performance.</p>

      <label for="lkxhzie" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think it’s happening</p>

<ol>
<li><p>the closest anyone has come was 81% of the way to the record which isn’t really that close. Wilt also never got that close to breaking it, partly because he got lucky that he hit 28-32 of his acts that game</p></li>

<li><p>the record means a lot to the history of nba, I could see a lot of coaches pulling players before they break the record just to preserve it</p></li>

<li><p>anytime a player gets hot and goes off (Klay’s 37 pt quarter, Luka and Joel’s 70 point games last year) the team is normally are up and player ends up sitting. Especially since the focus now is on playoffs vs individual performance. Breaking the record would be historic for sure but going for it, not breaking it, and then being injured for the playoffs would be embarrassing</p></li>

<li><p>athleticism. All of these wilt records have athleticism in common, an insane level of athleticism. He also played all 48 mins of this game (and for a season) which isn’t happening again</p></li>

      <label for="lkti8sv" class="commentText"><p>Out of all of these, I guess 5 would be the most &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; to break. A really good rookie on a really bad team (say an expansion team) could catch fire his first five games.</p>

<p>But the other 4 just ain&rsquo;t happening.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>No coach would ever allow their player to play 48 minutes a game, that&rsquo;s basically player abuse.</p></li>

<li><p>NBA is too good defensively these days to allow 50 points a game for a whole season.</p></li>

<li><p>No team&rsquo;s missing that many shots to even get 55 rebounds lol. Centers also don&rsquo;t camp in the paint like they used to.</p></li>

<li><p>Until the day someone beats Kobe&rsquo;s 81, I&rsquo;m not convinced Wilt&rsquo;s 100 will ever be beatable. Even with how talented the NBA is today.</p></li>

He lost all games though iand I won&rsquo;t lie, he was padding the last game in garbage time. I remember the vets like Webber on the Bullets actually laughing at him for it as well lol</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>He did end up breaking Wilts record for most 40+ games in a row by a rookie</p>

      <label for="lktjv3p" class="commentText"><p>Yeah the pace of the game is too much for anyone to consistently play 48 a game (and honestly play in enough OTs for it to be over 48.5), players are too good for just one to score almost all their points.</p>

<p>Players are also too big nowadays for one player to grab that many rebounds.</p>

<p>50 ppg is just impossible as nobody can even get to 40 nowadays and even 35+ is super rare in the whple history of the game.</p>

<p>Even having the 5th one would require a talent so great that theyd instantly be considered the greatest prospect to have ever played the game.</p>

<p>Most of his buckets werent exactly too hard to get tbh.</p>

<p>And it was a faster paced era, but not one that was particularly intense for players bodies.</p>

<p>But that said its still 48 minutes of playing basketball.</p>

<p>Yes per 100 posessions that works. But thats not how thats donne. Wilt played over 48 minutes a game, while Jordan didnt. Wilt managed that per game, not per 100 posessions.</p>

<p>Thats a big difrence, given that results in general are based on a game to game basis. It doesnt matter if Jordan could outscore Wilt in 100 posessions, when he couldnt do it for 48 minutes of a game.</p>

<p>Now having 8 seasons where he had better per 100 stats is impressive as hell, but Wilt just playong 48 minutes a game for a season is a lot more impressive.</p>

      <label for="lku8lan" class="commentText"><p>I think you are replying to the wrong comment, but we can know that he would&rsquo;ve kept those averages up. Because he played 41 games in 74 days, before he got called up to serve in the reserves. So it isn&rsquo;t like he had weeks off between those games. And even when he returned the lowest he scored in a regular season game was 36. So he was floating pretty much around 38 ppg.</p>

      <label for="lku974q" class="commentText"><p>and even if he did, he was the only other player in the era to come remotely close to wilts average. my point was that not everyone was averaging 40ppg like people make it out to be, yet this point completely flew over both of your heads, and instead, resorting to terms like ignorant and undeducated, when these are better used on both of you.</p>

      <label for="lku9yzy" class="commentText"><p>He also rated Wilt well above Olajuwon in another post, which really shows his lack of grasp of basketball eras. Hakeem played in arguably the most competitive eras of bigs in the NBA, facing the likes of Ewing, Kareem, Robinson, Shaq, Mutombo, Mourning, etc. He&rsquo;s IMO the greatest defensive big of all time, and was incredible on offense.</p>

<p>Wilt faced little competition in comparison.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why his comments have no real value or substance. His only retort is toxicity.</p>

      <label for="lktjnfa" class="commentText"><p>Wilt was a freak of his era, and dominated most opposition. But when he went up against the likes of Bill Russell, he ultimately struggled. During his prime, Wilt won no championships. It was only towards the end of his career that he won a couple of championships.</p>

      <label for="lktokgz" class="commentText"><p>he averaged 30, 28 and 4, on league leading efficiency against bill, which is more than his career averages. bill russel averaged 14, 28 and 4 on 38% fg, lowest amongst centers. wilt was the only one to beat the stacked celtics of the 60s, when he beat them in his prime in 67. he won 3 mvps during this period of time, and set the record for most wins in a season multiple times. i dont understand how you can be so ignorant and confidently wrong about every point you talked about, you ignoranus bofoonus.</p>

      <label for="lktsxm7" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re quite selective in your stats. Pay close attention, and you&rsquo;ll see that Wilt only scored 30 or more points on a couple of occasions against Russell whilst averaging around 20% more minutes than him. Russell was often his kryptonite towards the late 60s. Mutombo, Rodman and Wallace weren&rsquo;t great offensively, but extremely effective defensively.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re clearly the embodiment of pseudo intelligence, to underestimate Bill Russell&rsquo;s defensive impact.</p>

      <label for="lktzwdt" class="commentText"><p>He actually scored more than 30 on 65 out of their first 89 games against each other, only to failing under 20 once during this period. when he chose to become more of a pass willing big, and play in  a system however, he drastically reduced his scoring, only scoring 30 against bill russel 6 times out of their last 55 meetings. you mistakingly thought he had an inconsistent game log because of the average, but thats because he chose to score less at the later part of his career. I emplore you to do your research on a topic before you call someone pseudo intelligent, because it seems that term most aptly aplies to you here. i&rsquo;ll provide a year by year game log for you here, so you can &ldquo;pay close attention&rdquo; tpo it yourself. i hope you don&rsquo;t contnue speaking bullshit online at people thinking youre right all the time, insulting them in the process.</p>

      <label for="lku1ey4" class="commentText"><p>The “Bill Russell was Wilt’s kryptonite” narrative really only started due to Bill Simmons’ propaganda.</p>

<p>It was Russell along with his team that made it such a difficult mountain to cllimb for Wilt’s teams.</p>

<p>Most players in Wilt’s era have nothing but high praise for him and Russell.</p>

<p>Wilt did average 29 PPG and 29 RBP against Bill Russell also.</p>

      <label for="lku3i2v" class="commentText"><p>Yeah another reason is because people look at Wilt’s amount of championships compared to Bills amount of championships and then they look at Wilt’s incredible stats.</p>

<p>Because most people haven’t seen either play, the easiest thing for them to do is to try to make sense of that is by (erroneously) oversimplify why Wilt teams usually lost to Russell teams in the Finals, by falsely assuming that “Bill was Wilt’s kryptonite”.</p>

      <label for="lkub56a" class="commentText"><p>What on earth are you talking about nephew? He won his first ship in his 8th season. Any goated player would struggle to win with a random coach versus the greatest coach of the era, with the greatest leader, playing WITH NO SALARY CAP.</p>

<p>As the other posters cite Wilt still put up excellent numbers versus Bill, who was the very best defender of that era.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m not excusing Wilts lack of leadership but the Celtics dynasty would have been broken up midway thru had it existed in this era.</p>
