<p>Yep, every fan base there knows they are 3 years, at most, from kickstarting a dinasty and <em>knows</em> their stars wont forcr their way to NY/LA/Miami. Nfl cba is less player friendly but far more fan friendly. And as a <em>fan</em>, well, give me the nfl one.</p>

      <label for="lbmpr4s" class="commentText"><p>But the 2022 Warriors pretty much drafted all those players. Curry, Klay, Dray, Poole, Looney. Basically 5 of their 8 main guys were drafted by them. Only Wiggins, Porter jr and Payton were not drafted by them out of the guys who played significant roles in the Finals for example, and even Payton had just had his breakout season.

The lack of back-to-back winners and matchups in the last 25 years shows that you can’t just buy champions.</p>

<p>Both leagues are really just interested in eliminating the “middle class” of players. The ideal format for owners would be to have one or two max contract players that puts butts in seats and sells merch while paying as little as possible beyond that. Some teams will inevitably do better in scouting beyond their franchise stars, and while big markets get a boost for their location or ownership spending it’s negligible if the front office is cheeks. The Lakers and Yankees are proof of that imo.</p>

      <label for="lbmxdht" class="commentText"><p>This take says more about your political lens than anything about the NBA.  Franchises like LA and BOS are likely operating at multiples of annual revenue compared to franchises like Memphis or Utah or Minny.</p>

<p>If you want any kind of parity at all, you need a cap structure like this.  Otherwise, you just have a few teams that are capable of outspending everyone else without losing tens of million a year.  And if your rebuttal is just &ldquo;they&rsquo;re billionaires!!&rdquo; that does not mean they have liquid assets to repeatedly inject cash every year into a team that is losing tens of millions or $100M+ because they&rsquo;re paying absurd luxury tax bills.</p>

There is no way for small market teams to compete with 750 mil of revenue when they have 250. Heck. Golden States luxury tax bill one year was more than entire teams revenue.</p>

Ballmer&rsquo;s spending didn&rsquo;t lead to any success&hellip;and Warriors success was not due to reckless spending.  This CBA was just a result of owners not wanting to be seen as cheap or embarrassed by other free spending owners.  The league and the players will come to regret it soon.</p>

      <label for="lbmnfc5" class="commentText"><p>Warriors have never been a large market team. They signed precisely one big free agent. Ever. Durant. And the only reason they were able to sign him was a one time spike in the cap. Not a systemic issue. A one time spike.  The Warriors owner did pay huge sums to keep the team together. To his credit.  But it wasn&rsquo;t anti competitive spending. He didn&rsquo;t lure any free agents from small teams bc of spending. He paid the players the team drafted.  What exactly was the issue with that? I understand that many are resentful that Warriors were successful for so many years but that isn&rsquo;t some regular problem that happens that must be corrected. How many dynasties have their been? 3 or 4 with decades in between. This wasn&rsquo;t some structural issue that undermined the competitiveness of the league</p>

      <label for="lbmp267" class="commentText"><p>Most of this is tangential to the problem the CBA addresses. Golden State has been a luxury tax team for the past six seasons.</p>

<p>The NBA saw teams look at a rule to enforce competitive balance and say, &ldquo;lol okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much it. Some teams got comfortable being in the luxury tax and the league said enough.</p>

      <label for="lbmysum" class="commentText"><p>The idea is that a team can exceed the soft cap but it is not sustainable. That&rsquo;s it. The Warriors and a few other teams saw the luxury tax as a manageable cost and not as a deterrent. Which does not fall in line with the spirit of the rule.</p>
