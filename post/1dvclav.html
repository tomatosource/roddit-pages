      <label for="lbnyrz0" class="commentText"><p>You can take forcing parity too far. The current CBA makes it so that you can&rsquo;t retain a good team for too long even if you drafted/traded for and developed all the players. If the goal was to help small market teams retain their stars, they wouldn&rsquo;t charge luxury tax for homegrown players&rsquo; salaries. But the goal is just blanket handicap of all dynasties, even if it&rsquo;s small market team or homegrown roster. Shit owners with trash FOs like the Gores just want talent to be redistributed from better run franchises. This will just devalue an entire era of championships in the history books because everyone will know that the Celtics/Spurs/OKC should&rsquo;ve been a homegrown dynasty but couldn&rsquo;t because even 3 years of paying the repeater tax is too much.</p>

This was a step WAAAAAY too far. </p>

<p> Victor is gonna get a max, right? Whoever his costar is, is also gonna get a Max, right? 2 stars taking up half your cap sheet and you better not even wiff the 2nd apron because we&rsquo;ll handicap your short handed team from getting better. Wtf</p>

The luxury tax was designed to penalize owners for spending too much. The players don&rsquo;t get that extra money, the other owners do.

      <label for="lbmpr4s" class="commentText"><p>But the 2022 Warriors pretty much drafted all those players. Curry, Klay, Dray, Poole, Looney. Basically 5 of their 8 main guys were drafted by them. Only Wiggins, Porter jr and Payton were not drafted by them out of the guys who played significant roles in the Finals for example, and even Payton had just had his breakout season. That’s basically the blueprint for great drafting and team building.</p>

<p>Yep, every fan base there knows they are 3 years, at most, from kickstarting a dinasty and <em>knows</em> their stars wont forcr their way to NY/LA/Miami. Nfl cba is less player friendly but far more fan friendly. And as a <em>fan</em>, well, give me the nfl one.</p>

      <label for="lbmu7hj" class="commentText"><p>The luxury tax in MLB actually works pretty well in creating parity by deterring spending and there are draft penalties for repeat offenders. The lack of back-to-back winners and matchups in the last 25 years shows that you can’t just buy champions.</p>

<p>Both leagues are really just interested in eliminating the “middle class” of players. The ideal format for owners would be to have one or two max contract players that puts butts in seats and sells merch while paying as little as possible beyond that. Some teams will inevitably do better in scouting beyond their franchise stars, and while big markets get a boost for their location or ownership spending it’s negligible if the front office is cheeks. The Lakers and Yankees are proof of that imo.</p>

      <label for="lbmxdht" class="commentText"><p>This take says more about your political lens than anything about the NBA.  Franchises like LA and BOS are likely operating at multiples of annual revenue compared to franchises like Memphis or Utah or Minny.</p>

<p>If you want any kind of parity at all, you need a cap structure like this.  Otherwise, you just have a few teams that are capable of outspending everyone else without losing tens of million a year.  And if your rebuttal is just &ldquo;they&rsquo;re billionaires!!&rdquo; that does not mean they have liquid assets to repeatedly inject cash every year into a team that is losing tens of millions or $100M+ because they&rsquo;re paying absurd luxury tax bills.</p>

<p>Brother 2 things:</p>

<p>Everyone is playing under the same rules, so nobody is getting hurt.</p>

<p>And why would we be hurt? Its san antonio man, this only stops big market teams from hoarding talent. In any case we will be benefitting of good players having to sign somewhere outside the rich teams. Its better for the league as a whole and i personally prefer a competitive league were every fan base can dream regardless of location (like the NFL, hence my fav league/sport). In the NBA i watch only selected spurs games. Nfl i watch it all day even if my team isnt playing. I would 100% watch more NBA if i could turn in any random game and see good players in both teams instead of some glorified g league games the nba has been putting out there because talent is consolidated in a few teams.</p>

The new CBA means that the FO needs to constantly be making good decisions if they want to constantly be good. You can’t just be like Reinsdorf and get lucky, resulting in a dynasty.</p>

<p>Dynasties are still possible, hell we might see one with OKC. But you just have to be good about team building. Like you can’t give max contracts to guys like Michael Porter Jr anymore. If Denver didn’t do that or looked to trade him, they could easily afford keeping guys like KCP.</p>

It looks like this CBA wants to spread out the superstars more across more teams. I think going forward we are going to see more 2 superstars each per team, with obvious exceptions when a team can draft well.</p>

      <label for="lbmnfc5" class="commentText"><p>Warriors have never been a large market team. They signed precisely one big free agent. Ever. Durant. And the only reason they were able to sign him was a one time spike in the cap. Not a systemic issue. A one time spike.  The Warriors owner did pay huge sums to keep the team together. To his credit.  But it wasn&rsquo;t anti competitive spending. He didn&rsquo;t lure any free agents from small teams bc of spending. He paid the players the team drafted.  What exactly was the issue with that? I understand that many are resentful that Warriors were successful for so many years but that isn&rsquo;t some regular problem that happens that must be corrected. How many dynasties have their been? 3 or 4 with decades in between. This wasn&rsquo;t some structural issue that undermined the competitiveness of the league</p>

<p>The NBA saw teams look at a rule to enforce competitive balance and say, &ldquo;lol okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much it. Some teams got comfortable being in the luxury tax and the league said enough.</p>
