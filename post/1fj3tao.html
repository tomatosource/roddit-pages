      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fj3tao/is_the_return_of_julius_randle_flying_under_the/"><p>Is the return of Julius Randle flying under the radar?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Jalen Brunson was a monster in the playoffs, regular season as well, after Julius Randle went down, averaging 31 PPG during the regular season and 32 PPG in the playoffs. Anunoby went down as well and the Knicks had other injuries up and down their roster, including Jalen himself. He was banged up but carried the Knicks to the second seed in the playoffs and in defeating the Sixers in the first round of the playoffs.</p>

<p>That being said, the Knicks&rsquo; limitations without Randle were often exposed throughout the playoffs. DiVincenzo did his best and McBride and Burks had their moments but they didn&rsquo;t have a second creator to consistently release pressure off Brunson and especially so after OG went down. Most people do not seem to realize that the Knicks the last two seasons with Brunson and Randle together have been a top 5 offense. They did that with RJ Barrett as their third scorer for 1.5 seasons and then OG. This season it&rsquo;s going to be Mikal Bridges.</p>

<p>But they aren&rsquo;t a top 5 offense without Julius. He&rsquo;s a horse of a scorer. He struggled to start last season, people forget he was having probably the best stretch of his career when he went down. You get some bad decision making but his playmaking talent is crucial for the Knicks since they don&rsquo;t have a lot of it outside of Brunson. He&rsquo;s someone who will find the kickout from the post and on the drive. Brunson is one of the best spot up shooters in the NBA and we&rsquo;ll see more of that this season with Julius healthy again.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s taking more efficient shots within the flow of the offense and he found his groove last season by putting his head down and attacking more off the catch and looking to score more from closer to the basket and in his midrange comfort zone vs drives from the perimeter and 3&rsquo;s. He&rsquo;s a beast, and the Knicks were an elite team last year with Brunson+Randle+OG.</p>

<p>There are some claiming the Knicks are better without Julius and others floating trades, but I think Julius is a great fit and a necessity for this team to get to the mountain top. What do you all think? Is Julius Randle&rsquo;s return from injury being slept on as a story line for this season?</p>

<p>24-9-5 last year, even factoring in his horrible first 10-game stretch when he was recovering from ankle surgery</p>

<p>The Knicks were better with him on the floor by every metric imaginable, they absolutely missed him in the playoffs. They will be better with him this year as well, assuming he recovers fully from his shoulder surgery</p>

      <label for="lnlt92n" class="commentText"><p>Definitely never watched the Knicks if you think this.  Randle&rsquo;s efficiency is similar to Banchero&rsquo;s but people are quick to either scoff at this or ignore it.  Rarely passes at 5apg a game also doesn&rsquo;t really add up especially since he&rsquo;s not the primary ball handler and the team being reliant on offensive rebounds.</p>

<p>A Hornets flair shouldn&rsquo;t be talking about who they want or don&rsquo;t want on their team.</p>

I think he could be more efficient with a heavier paint approach, especially with y’all’s 3 point shooting (adding Bridges was an awesome move)</p>

      <label for="lnlynor" class="commentText"><p>If you look at his numbers after the OG trade until his injury, he was shooting 48/37/81 putting up 25/8/5 which you&rsquo;d definitely take from your second option.  Randle and shooters have a great reciprocal relationship.  Randle does well himself with shooters around him and shooters get a good boost with him on the floor.</p>

<p>People still have the Hawks series in their minds.  Fair to rip him for that but also the 2022-23 playoffs where he played with an ankle that needed surgery which isn&rsquo;t fair.  Times have changed and Randle has gotten better and so have the Knicks.</p>

Shot selection is a big thing for me, he almost never needs to shoot a 3 unless left wide open with how the teams built. Hart stepped up at PF rebounding like a monster only taking quality shots. That was a huge reason for there success imo.</p>

Probably the only team in the east that can matchup well against the celtics. With OG, Bridges, Randle, Hart, Mitch, and Divo this team is gonna be very tough to score against. Throw in Brunson who was playing like a top 5 player in the league in last years playoffs, this team could make it to the finals easily.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Knicks do not matchup well with the Celtics. The Celtics 1-4 and 4-1 pick and rolls are staple plays. They put the Knicks&rsquo; two weakest defenders (Randle and Brunson) in the action.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t really matter where you put them. The Celtics can run pick and roll with whoever Randle/Brunson are guarding while OG/Bridges have to stick to shooters.</p>

So in the regard I feel much more comfortable with our matchup against the Celtics because we have the depth to match the Celtics depth. The Celtics depth is what won them the chip, not the amazing play of Tatum.</p>

<p>Individually Embiid willed his team to a win against us by dropping 50 with one eye so yeah, I fear that dude way more than anyone on the Celtics lol.</p>

      <label for="lnlnlyd" class="commentText"><p>When Randle&rsquo;s shot is falling, he is completely comparable to Brunson as a player. When his shot isn&rsquo;t falling, but he has spacing around him, he&rsquo;s up there with the best bullyball players in the league. And in either case, he loves to defer to and play two-man games with his point guards. Almost all of his issues come down to what happens when he&rsquo;s cold, surrounded, and our spacing has gone to shit. After all the moves this past year, the current roster is the absolute ideal environment for him to play in.</p>

<p>There is a world where the team and Randle is not as good as we hope and Randle will be traded for some value as tj avoid signing him to smth we don’t want, but Idt that happens cause I’m optimisirix</p>

      <label for="lnlxtbw" class="commentText"><p>i mean tbf the two times he was in the playoffs, he had a dogshit team in 2021 they exploited the hell out of em, and then he was injured 2023. In general the roster has always been very awkward for the majority of his tenure as a Knick, as much as I have love for RJ and can see him thriving in Toronto, him and Julius were a real bad fit. Despite that Julius still managed to get multiple all-nba seasons. I think its pretty fair as an outside observer to go hes gotta prove it but I think all signs point to him and this team playing some great basketball this year (besides the center rotation question mark).</p>

<p>His ability to take pressure off of Brunson so he has easier looks will be hugely important come playoff time as was evident in the Pacers series. without Randle and Anunoby (and rly most of the squad also just bein banged up), the offense was just incredibly stagnant. Fingers crossed we can get there all healthy for once to really see what we have.</p>

      <label for="lnlkjgk" class="commentText"><p>I swear every time there is a Knicks thread in this sub there are the same completely uninformed/ misinformed takes repeated over and over by the same people.</p>

<p>To answer the question: Randle&rsquo;s shot creation and rebounding has become really under-appreciated. While I haven&rsquo;t been his biggest fan over the years, he is still truly a great player, and doesn&rsquo;t deserve the disrespect he gets from both Knicks fans and the broader NBA. I also thought he looked fantastic next to OG for that spell, and I expect the same next to Bridges this season. I&rsquo;m excited to see some small ball with Julius at the 5 - could interesting.</p>

<p>The playoffs are still his biggest question - absolutely - but any dip becomes a LOT less of a problem when you&rsquo;re playing adjacent to so much talent. There&rsquo;s been many players over the years who have underperformed over their first few playoffs, but then bust out one season and the whole narrative changes; this could be that season for Randle, but we&rsquo;ll have to just wait and see. The Knicks are contenders either way, however. Tatum showed us this past offseason that a teams no 1 option can shoot like garbage all playoffs and if he hustles and the rest of the team has talent and stays the course, you can still win.</p>

<p>Most of this sub doesn&rsquo;t watch basketball at all. Most of the ones who do only watch their own team (which is fair IMO).</p>

      <label for="lnlprc4" class="commentText"><p>If the Knicks are 100% they will be a force. Lots of depth, excellent defenders, and good coaching, and a good closer in Brunson. Thibs needs to use his depth during the season so his guys aren’t wasted come playoff time. Josh Hart is great but he doesn’t need to play every minute. Healthy, they might be the best matchup for the Celtics, on paper</p>

<p>There is a world where the team and Randle is not as good as we hope and Randle will be traded for some value as tj avoid signing him to smth we don’t want, but Idt that happens cause I’m optimistic</p>

      <label for="lnls8mc" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s mostly just an unknown I think, yeah he had a really good stretch but he&rsquo;s a fairly ball-dominant guy who mostly just plays as a catch and shoot guy when he&rsquo;s not on the ball and the Knicks have a lotta guys who want touches now, Bridges and OG will want their fair share and DDV has earned a bigger role since Randle went down. A lot of his best work came from the fact he started driving a lot more and being more physical at the time and people don&rsquo;t always maintain that after injuries and if he doesn&rsquo;t have the ball, he isn&rsquo;t a particularly good cutter or anything, so how do you get him into those spots where he thrives while Mitch is on the floor without cramming the paint for Brunson? It&rsquo;s something for Thibs to figure out.</p>

<p>I do think some Randle at the 5 will help the Knicks a lot, they can push the pace a little with him and help alleviate some of the pressure from Brunson when it comes to creating in the half-court, so he doesn&rsquo;t look dead by every 4th quarter in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Again, you&rsquo;re just looking at numbers without adding any sort of context. Nobody cares if D Rose is averaging 19 points a game because D Rose is not leading that team to victory.</p>

Losing your defensive anchor puts more pressure on the offense.  And as others have stated our offense was nearly all revolving around JR.  That hawks team had more 3pt shooting on the bench than the knicks had on the roster</p>

      <label for="lnlsd1z" class="commentText"><p>Listing his stats without context is missing the point entirely.</p>

<p>He was bad in the Hawks series where he was the main guy that they focused the entire defense on stopping. Cool, he proved he can&rsquo;t be the guy. Most can&rsquo;t. And then the following year he sprained his ankle twice and needed surgery in the offseason. So he can&rsquo;t play on one leg.</p>

<p>Randle being bad in two playoff runs (one as the main guy, one injured) does not mean that he can&rsquo;t be a good second All Star next to a superstar. That is the point. The stats are what they are (and that&rsquo;s literally one of the worst playoff performers ever), but stats require context.</p>

<p>The Hawks series says a lot more than you want it to. You’re just brushing off an awful playoff performance by saying not many people can be number one. Ok that’s true but a lot of players who didn’t turn out to be real number ones still played a hell of a lot better when they were forced into that role than Randle did.</p>

<p>Obviously the ankle injury slowed him down a lot so you’re right that we haven’t seen him healthy in the playoffs in years. I expect Randle to be better next year than he has in the past but I still think he has to prove he can be a positive player in the playoffs.</p>

In all his time since joining NY, everyone speaks glowingly about his work ethic and relationships with teammates and coaches, this idea that he&rsquo;s some diva who would cause ripples in the locker room is stupid and pushed by the body language experts on this sub</p>

<p>Oh yeah and the idea of letting him walk after this year is stupid as shit lol</p>

It’s not a completely unfounded concept that he has the potential to be a diva</p>

However he was locked in the January after the OG (not Nova either) and before the injury.  Yall also make it sound like the Nova teammates are completely separate from the team as if most of the roster isn&rsquo;t Nova.  Right now there&rsquo;s just no moves out there.  Can you do better?  Sure but what&rsquo;s out there that can match 25/9/5, 2 all-stars, and 2 all-NBA under 30 years old?</p>

<p>Come playoff time they still have two major problems. Brunson a massive weak link on defense, and no competent backup C for the inevitable Robinson injury.</p>

<p>Unless they fix both of those, they’re not getting by Boston and could easily lose to others too.</p>
