      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fj3tao/is_the_return_of_julius_randle_flying_under_the/"><p>Is the return of Julius Randle flying under the radar?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Jalen Brunson was a monster in the playoffs, regular season as well, after Julius Randle went down, averaging 31 PPG during the regular season and 32 PPG in the playoffs. Anunoby went down as well and the Knicks had other injuries up and down their roster, including Jalen himself. He was banged up but carried the Knicks to the second seed in the playoffs and in defeating the Sixers in the first round of the playoffs.</p>

<p>That being said, the Knicks&rsquo; limitations without Randle were often exposed throughout the playoffs. DiVincenzo did his best and McBride and Burks had their moments but they didn&rsquo;t have a second creator to consistently release pressure off Brunson and especially so after OG went down. Most people do not seem to realize that the Knicks the last two seasons with Brunson and Randle together have been a top 5 offense. They did that with RJ Barrett as their third scorer for 1.5 seasons and then OG. This season it&rsquo;s going to be Mikal Bridges.</p>

<p>But they aren&rsquo;t a top 5 offense without Julius. He&rsquo;s a horse of a scorer. He struggled to start last season, people forget he was having probably the best stretch of his career when he went down. You get some bad decision making but his playmaking talent is crucial for the Knicks since they don&rsquo;t have a lot of it outside of Brunson. He&rsquo;s someone who will find the kickout from the post and on the drive. Brunson is one of the best spot up shooters in the NBA and we&rsquo;ll see more of that this season with Julius healthy again.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s taking more efficient shots within the flow of the offense and he found his groove last season by putting his head down and attacking more off the catch and looking to score more from closer to the basket and in his midrange comfort zone vs drives from the perimeter and 3&rsquo;s. He&rsquo;s a beast, and the Knicks were an elite team last year with Brunson+Randle+OG.</p>

<p>There are some claiming the Knicks are better without Julius and others floating trades, but I think Julius is a great fit and a necessity for this team to get to the mountain top. What do you all think? Is Julius Randle&rsquo;s return from injury being slept on as a story line for this season?</p>

<p>The Knicks were better with him on the floor by every metric imaginable, they absolutely missed him in the playoffs. They will be better with him this year as well, assuming he recovers fully from his shoulder surgery</p>

      <label for="lnlnlyd" class="commentText"><p>When Randle&rsquo;s shot is falling, he is completely comparable to Brunson as a player. When his shot isn&rsquo;t falling, but he has spacing around him, he&rsquo;s up there with the best bullyball players in the league. And in either case, he loves to defer to and play two-man games with his point guards. Almost all of his issues come down to what happens when he&rsquo;s cold, surrounded, and our spacing has gone to shit. After all the moves this past year, the current roster is the absolute ideal environment for him to play in.</p>

Probably the only team in the east that can matchup well against the celtics. With OG, Bridges, Randle, Hart, Mitch, and Divo this team is gonna be very tough to score against. Throw in Brunson who was playing like a top 5 player in the league in last years playoffs, this team could make it to the finals easily.</p>

<p>If BOS wants to run their offense through Al Horford just to target Randle, the Knicks will take that all day.</p>

<p>You said BOS&rsquo; bread and butter is PnR involving Tatum, now you say it doesn&rsquo;t matter which players are involved. Make up your mind.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>PnR in 2024 isn&rsquo;t a 2-on-2 game from the Stockton/Malone era with the other 3 guys holding their defenders on the weak side. Where the other 3 Knicks are absolutely matters.</p>

<p>If Randle is guarding the center to keep him off Tatum, then who is Mitchell Robinson guarding?</p>

<p>If the other Knicks are helping off the perimeter to contain the PnR, then the ball swings and the Celtics get easy catch-and-shoot looks.</p>

      <label for="lnm42v8" class="commentText"><p>I’m not a Knicks fan, but Celtics haven’t played this version of the Knicks. Knicks will be able to play without Randle if needed. Mitch, OG, Hart, Bridges, Brunson. Vs the Celtics they can probably play Randle at Center if Porzingis is out. The Knicks are the closest thing to Celtics in depth. Celtics had great injury luck, can’t hardly puff their chest out too far.</p>

<p>I think C’s are team to beat, but other teams like the Knicks are close enough that if injury luck is flipped the Celtics could go home early in playoffs</p>

<p>Then the Celtics bring Brunson and Robinson into the PnR instead, which forces Robinson to either defend in space or to concede pick-and-pop 3s to Porzingis/Horford.</p>

<p>Porzingis barely played in the playoffs.</p>

Pacers without Haliburton are one of the worst conference finalists ever. Cavs without Mitchell, Heat without Butler. Mavs were the 5 seed, and a good matchup for Boston without a post presence. It will never be that easy again. Porzingisis going to miss significant time, Horford is getting old. Boston will still be favorites, but you’ve got to admit this was a weak title run.</p>

      <label for="lnlqa9r" class="commentText"><p>My initial point was about their current lineups.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Knicks do not matchup well with the Celtics. The Celtics 1-4 and 4-1 pick and rolls are staple plays. They put the Knicks&rsquo; two weakest defenders (Randle and Brunson) in the action.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t really matter where you put them. The Celtics can run pick and roll with whoever Randle/Brunson are guarding while OG/Bridges have to stick to shooters.</p>

So in the regard I feel much more comfortable with our matchup against the Celtics because we have the depth to match the Celtics depth. The Celtics depth is what won them the chip, not the amazing play of Tatum.</p>

<p>Individually Embiid willed his team to a win against us by dropping 50 with one eye so yeah, I fear that dude way more than anyone on the Celtics lol.</p>

They don’t have close to the quality of players in their 3-8th men that the celts do, on top of having 2 bonafide all nba players. Just cuz Tatum wasn’t averaging 30 ppg doesn’t make their team not scary. Turns out versatility is a pretty damn important thing</p>

<p>There is a world where the team and Randle is not as good as we hope and Randle will be traded for some value as tj avoid signing him to smth we don’t want, but Idt that happens cause I’m optimisirix</p>

      <label for="lnlprc4" class="commentText"><p>If the Knicks are 100% they will be a force. Lots of depth, excellent defenders, and good coaching, and a good closer in Brunson. Thibs needs to use his depth during the season so his guys aren’t wasted come playoff time. Josh Hart is great but he doesn’t need to play every minute. Healthy, they might be the best matchup for the Celtics, on paper</p>

      <label for="lnls8mc" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s mostly just an unknown I think, yeah he had a really good stretch but he&rsquo;s a fairly ball-dominant guy who mostly just plays as a catch and shoot guy when he&rsquo;s not on the ball and the Knicks have a lotta guys who want touches now, Bridges and OG will want their fair share and DDV has earned a bigger role since Randle went down. A lot of his best work came from the fact he started driving a lot more and being more physical at the time and people don&rsquo;t always maintain that after injuries and if he doesn&rsquo;t have the ball, he isn&rsquo;t a particularly good cutter or anything, so how do you get him into those spots where he thrives while Mitch is on the floor without cramming the paint for Brunson? It&rsquo;s something for Thibs to figure out.</p>

<p>I do think some Randle at the 5 will help the Knicks a lot, they can push the pace a little with him and help alleviate some of the pressure from Brunson when it comes to creating in the half-court, so he doesn&rsquo;t look dead by every 4th quarter in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="lnlkjgk" class="commentText"><p>I swear every time there is a Knicks thread in this sub there are the same completely uninformed/ misinformed takes repeated over and over by the same people.</p>

<p>To answer the question: Randle&rsquo;s shot creation and rebounding has become really under-appreciated. While I haven&rsquo;t been his biggest fan over the years, he is still truly a great player, and doesn&rsquo;t deserve the disrespect he gets from both Knicks fans and the broader NBA. I also thought he looked fantastic next to OG for that spell, and I expect the same next to Bridges this season. I&rsquo;m excited to see some small ball with Julius at the 5 - could interesting.</p>

<p>The playoffs are still his biggest question - absolutely - but any dip becomes a LOT less of a problem when you&rsquo;re playing adjacent to so much talent. There&rsquo;s been many players over the years who have underperformed over their first few playoffs, but then bust out one season and the whole narrative changes; this could be that season for Randle, but we&rsquo;ll have to just wait and see. The Knicks are contenders either way, however. Tatum showed us this past offseason that a teams no 1 option can shoot like garbage all playoffs and if he hustles and the rest of the team has talent and stays the course, you can still win.</p>

<p>2 years ago he was hurt bad enough that he had surgery the minute the Knicks were eliminated.</p>

<p>I’m not saying his playoff performances aren’t at least slightly disappointing &amp; worrying. But I wanna see a healthy Randle in the playoffs with this version of the Knicks before I write him off as a playoff choker.</p>

<li><p>Knicks lost their defensive anchor in Mitch, which allowed Capela to run wild because Noel was not up to snuff</p></li>

<li><p>Knicks had nobody who could exploit Trae&rsquo;s defense, which allowed them to just stick him in the corner on guys like Bullock.</p></li>

<p>Again, you&rsquo;re just looking at numbers without adding any sort of context. Nobody cares if D Rose is averaging 19 points a game because D Rose is not leading that team to victory.</p>

<p>He was bad in the Hawks series where he was the main guy that they focused the entire defense on stopping. Cool, he proved he can&rsquo;t be the guy. Most can&rsquo;t. And then the following year he sprained his ankle twice and needed surgery in the offseason. So he can&rsquo;t play on one leg.</p>

<p>Randle being bad in two playoff runs (one as the main guy, one injured) does not mean that he can&rsquo;t be a good second All Star next to a superstar. That is the point. The stats are what they are (and that&rsquo;s literally one of the worst playoff performers ever), but stats require context.</p>

<p>The Hawks series says a lot more than you want it to. You’re just brushing off an awful playoff performance by saying not many people can be number one. Ok that’s true but a lot of players who didn’t turn out to be real number ones still played a hell of a lot better when they were forced into that role than Randle did.</p>

I hope he stays healthy this year if only to give him a chance to lose that reputation, but I also can&rsquo;t see him playing that bad with this current lineup.</p>

      <label for="lnlvig8" class="commentText"><p>I mean in 2021 the Knicks were playing the Hawks who also didn’t have a true second option, I don’t know if that’s really a good excuse for him shooting 28% from 2.</p>

<p>Obviously the ankle injury slowed him down a lot so you’re right that we haven’t seen him healthy in the playoffs in years. I expect Randle to be better next year than he has in the past but I still think he has to prove he can be a positive player in the playoffs.</p>

You can&rsquo;t assume someone is bad in the playoffs based on a single series, especially since he was the first option then and is now the 2nd option</p>

At 6’10’’ shoots less than 50% from field, 30% from 3pt. and he takes almost 5 threes a game.  Trade this guy while he still has a little bit of value. All he will do otherwise is take the ball out of Brunson’s hand</p>

      <label for="lnlxtbw" class="commentText"><p>i mean tbf the two times he was in the playoffs, he had a dogshit team in 2021 they exploited the hell out of em, and then he was injured 2023. In general the roster has always been very awkward for the majority of his tenure as a Knick, as much as I have love for RJ and can see him thriving in Toronto, him and Julius were a real bad fit. Despite that Julius still managed to get multiple all-nba seasons. I think its pretty fair as an outside observer to go hes gotta prove it but I think all signs point to him and this team playing some great basketball this year (besides the center rotation question mark).</p>

<p>His ability to take pressure off of Brunson so he has easier looks will be hugely important come playoff time as was evident in the Pacers series. without Randle and Anunoby (and rly most of the squad also just bein banged up), the offense was just incredibly stagnant. Fingers crossed we can get there all healthy for once to really see what we have.</p>

<p>There is a world where the team and Randle is not as good as we hope and Randle will be traded for some value as tj avoid signing him to smth we don’t want, but Idt that happens cause I’m optimistic</p>

In all his time since joining NY, everyone speaks glowingly about his work ethic and relationships with teammates and coaches, this idea that he&rsquo;s some diva who would cause ripples in the locker room is stupid and pushed by the body language experts on this sub</p>

      <label for="lnlnv7d" class="commentText"><p>bro if youre talking about the 2022 lakers game, the assistant coach shoved a laptop in his face and Randle just moved the laptop out of the way as he walked towards the timeout huddle. Twitter then of course blew up saying Randle smacked this guy&rsquo;s computer as a hostile act, now you&rsquo;re on reddit saying he threw it</p>

<p>The way people blatantly say false things is insane.</p>

However he was locked in the January after the OG (not Nova either) and before the injury.  Yall also make it sound like the Nova teammates are completely separate from the team as if most of the roster isn&rsquo;t Nova.  Right now there&rsquo;s just no moves out there.  Can you do better?  Sure but what&rsquo;s out there that can match 25/9/5, 2 all-stars, and 2 all-NBA under 30 years old?</p>

<p>Come playoff time they still have two major problems. Brunson a massive weak link on defense, and no competent backup C for the inevitable Robinson injury.</p>

<p>Unless they fix both of those, they’re not getting by Boston and could easily lose to others too.</p>
