</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>We&rsquo;ve heard all the weird little anecdotes used to describe different ways to score the ball. Hoopers, ethical scoring, run and dunk, etc. From what I&rsquo;ve seen the elite scorers of the NBA across its existence generally fall into two different categories:</p>

<p>The &ldquo;pure&rdquo; scorers: Generally smaller and/or more agile players that rely on skill and finesse to generate buckets. They tend to take shots further away from the basket which can be less efficient, but stresses defenses out a little more, and they use their mobility and footwork to generate offense moreso than others. Examples are Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, James Harden, Allen Iverson, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;dominant&rdquo; scorers: Generally bigger, stronger players that rely on their size and physical abilities to generate buckets. They tend to live in the paint and dominate smaller players, which leads to overall better efficiency since they take more shots at the rim, but perhaps have less range and skill than their smaller contemporaries. Examples are LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal, Wilt Chamberlain, Russell Westbrook, Karl Malone.</p>

<p>Now obviously a lot of these players don&rsquo;t ONLY rely on skill or ONLY rely on their physical gifts to get buckets, but there seems to be 2 distinct approaches to scoring the basketball, and I&rsquo;m curious about what others think if one method is more valuable than another.</p>

<p>but if it&rsquo;s giannis vs kd, give me kd</p>

<p>both get 30 but kd on the floor spreads the floor for everyone else cause you can&rsquo;t leave him, and he&rsquo;s got more spots he can operate from</p>

      <label for="ln75zu1" class="commentText"><p>Shaq could be stopped be sending him to the free throw line to the point you had to bench him in the 4th, with Giannis u can force him to take open long range shots which he can&rsquo;t hit so i&rsquo;m going to give it to pure scorers for the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="ln72td4" class="commentText"><p>In general dominant scorers are more valuable but it’s still a good thing to be a reliable 3 level scorer particularly at the midrange.</p>

<p>Having a reliable go to middy can come in handy in crunch time when defenses become physical and your legs become tired.</p>

      <label for="ln766in" class="commentText"><p>You sure? Cause there are several apes that have no idea what I&rsquo;m saying</p>

<p>Russ is categorized as a &ldquo;dominant&rdquo; scorer because he, more than most other superstar players, used his physical abilities to generate buckets, and he was probably the smallest player to do this and be effective at it. Efficient or not, Russ won multiple scoring titles.</p>

      <label for="ln765ee" class="commentText"><p>more skilled scorers are harder to gameplan for, while physical scorers are harder to execute the gameplan on.</p>

<p>shaq only needed a few moves to dominate, and would’ve feasted if he only ever used the drop step, but teams also knew how the ball was going to get to shaq, what coverages he had the ability to pass out of, etc. the issue wasn’t in knowing how to stop him, it was in finding the personnel to do it. as it turned out, in shaq’s case, there was no one who was able to stop him, just slow him down (rodman most notably).</p>

<p>a skilled scorer, on the other hand, cannot fully be accounted for, and even more so if he can play off ball. while he may score less efficiently due to the quality of shot selection, the defense is more stressed by an unknown variable than a known flaw. furthermore, scorers who rely on tough shot making - elastic scorers - tend to maintain their efficiency into the playoffs due to their ability to counter a variety of defenses. examples of elastic scorers include kobe and hakeem. these players were not particularly efficient for their position but could score at will, and the game’s about a bucket.</p>

<p>i would personally value skilled scoring more because of how much of the game is coaching. in high school ball there are players that can’t go left that you can exploit. in the nba, there are players uncomfortable fading across their left shoulder that you can exploit.</p>

      <label for="ln76fas" class="commentText"><p>If you score at a higher rate and are more efficient while doing so versatility is meaningless</p>

<p>The issue with many “dominant” scorers is being one-dimensional can make you easier to gameplan against. But there is no gameplan to stop a physical specimen like Shaq for example so his lack of versatility didn’t matter.</p>

<p>Many people just think jumpers are prettier than layups/dunks and that’s fine. Doesn’t necessarily make those players better at scoring though.</p>

      <label for="ln77cyv" class="commentText"><p>Ultimately when comparing scorers assuming their production is similar a lot of the argument will boil down to how do they perform against different type of defenses in the postseason which is where versatility provides its benefits the most</p>
