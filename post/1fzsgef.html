      <p>It&rsquo;s getting close to the 2025 season and a lot of spurs players have a chance to take a leap in production, along with a few veteran players being added to the roster. Will the Spurs improve or stay one of the bottom teams in the West?</p>

Barnes, Paul and even Castle are calming presences who control the game far better than anyone else. I think conservatively, 32-50. High end 41-41, so I will go in the middle at 36-46.</p>

<p>Assuming health or course.</p>

      <label for="lr4q238" class="commentText"><p>The win total to make the play-in last year was 46 wins. The Grizzlies are healthy now, and the Rockets should be improving too and both teams missed the cut last year. It’s legitimately possibility that you might need to win 48-50 games just to make the play-ins in the west this season which is crazy to think about.</p>

<p>The Spurs should improve, but i think it’s going to be near impossible for them to jump from 22 to 45+ wins and make the play-in.</p>

<p>I would have been more optimistic about them making the play-in, but the rest of the west is still insanely good. If there&rsquo;s one team that would make the play in (worst case) as opposed to last year, it would be the Grizzlies.</p>

<p>Give it another draft or two, see how the young picks develop, then start going after stars on the market.</p>

2nd Round Atlanta (Protected 31-40) —
 They also obviously own their own 1st and 2nd round picks.</p>

<p>Considering everything but the Clippers is protected, I don’t see how they could get Flagg without trading for him.</p>

<p>End of season data sometimes can get a little fickle because there are a lot of teams that stop trying, but with the added talent, I do think 33 wins is totally feasible for them.</p>

<p>Their over/under is 35.5, which is also reasonable to think. I&rsquo;m just a little higher on their competition in the West though.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to hit the under, but not by much. I&rsquo;ll say 34 wins this year, which is 12 more wins compared to last year. They will still be a bottom 3 team in the West and miss the play-in.</p>

<p>It used to be that just having average/competent players trying their best would allow a team missing their star to float above the bottom feeders who are actively trying to lose. In the West this season that might only be two teams.</p>

      <label for="lr3kgiz" class="commentText"><p>They played at a 33 win pace post ASB, so that&rsquo;s around where I think they&rsquo;ll end up. I think the team will be better than that win total with adding CP3 and Barnes as stabilizing forces + another year of Wemby&rsquo;s development, but there&rsquo;s three things going against them making a big leap.</p>

<ul>
<li>The west is absolutely insane</li>
<li>They&rsquo;ve signaled that they&rsquo;re playing the long game with team building around Wemby</li>
<li>This draft class has some really good pieces at the top</li>
</ul>

<p>Those three things together make me think that we might see the Spurs focus a lot more on development than winning games at points this season</p>

      <label for="lr3jjrt" class="commentText"><p>I think 5 games is too low. We have to remember that there were basically 2 different Spurs teams last year:</p>

<ol>
<li>The one where Pop was trying to fit a square peg in a round hole, (i.e. Wemby at the 4 and Sochan as the PG)</li>
<li>Pop realizes that what looks, quacks, and sounds like a duck is a duck, (Wemby at the 5 with an actual point guard)</li>
</ol>

<p>The first team was horrendous and the 2nd team was bad, but was also winning at a 28-win pace, (6 wins better than their overall record). January to April isn&rsquo;t a small sample either.</p>

<p>I think improving 5 wins from that 28-win pace makes sense, which would mean an overall total of an 11 win improvement.</p>

      <label for="lr4lmmi" class="commentText"><p>I think you’re making the assumption that the Spurs try hard to win every game this year. It’s not obvious that they will.</p>

<p>This year’s draft class is elite, they have their own pick, it’s only year 2 for Wemby, there’s a big chance they’ll be out of the running for the play in by February, and CP3/Barnes are obvious buyout or trade candidates.</p>

<p>There’s definitely a world where they are on a ~33-35 win pace by March but have zero shot at the play in, then they decide to play only young guys, experiment, and semi-tank the rest of the year like they did for a lot of 2023-24. IMO it’s the most likely outcome actually.</p>

<p>Also if Wemby misses time for any reason they will lose every game. Most top heavy team in the league, talent wise.</p>

      <label for="lr3kdw6" class="commentText"><p>I could see a 10 game improvement. Wemby should be better, their lineups will likely make more sense. I think CP is a downgrade from Tre Jones, but Jones is a huge upgrade over Blake Wesley. I expect Sochan to at least be better than last year, which was a huge adjustment period for him. Overall, they’re still not good, but getting to 32 wins doesn’t seem improbable</p>

<p>They added CP3, Barnes, and Castle so their spacing, decision making, and defense got better. I think 36 wins, give or take a few wins should be the expectation.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s usually a few seasons into their career where even the all-timers start making their teams be serious.</p>

<p>And the Spurs roster is just awful. This isn&rsquo;t like when they tanked for Duncan.</p>

<p>They got the #1 pick and Wemby because they just fucking suck.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see how adding CP3 helps anything on the court. He might help Wemby with prep, but can or should he play serious minutes for a serious team at this point in his career? No.</p>

Wemby is incredible obviously but he still has a couple of years to go before he can be a guy who will lead a team into the playoffs. CP3 will be a great tone-setter and veteran presence but he&rsquo;s not good enough to lead to a lot of wins at this point in his career. Vassell seems to be injured pretty often so he needs be on the floor more too. Guys like Castle and Sochan are still question marks.</p>

<p>I see them being something like 30-52.</p>

      <label for="lr69dqa" class="commentText"><p>I could honestly see anywhere from high 20&rsquo;s (with say, top 6 odds) to low 40&rsquo;s and sneaking into the bottom of the play-in (though that will be incredibly hard in thw West).</p>

<p>The addition of Paul and Barnes is not just about what these 2 actually bring as players (though a good PG could make a huge difference to Wemby, as we saw with our on/off numbers last year with Tre Jones), but about overall depth and roster construction. Suddenly Tre Jones is a full-time backup, Keldon is a clear bench player, Champagnie is a 9th/10th guy, and guys like Branham and Wesley are true end of the bench guys. Moving these guys to their more natural roles, and not asking them to do too much could suddenly make a huge difference to performance and wins and losses - especially if Vic makes an improvement (and just plays 5 all year).</p>

<p>But I also see a world where by January the team is clearly off play-in pace, and decide that the best outcome is to just soft-tank for those top <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> odds. See if you can any positive trade value for Barnes or Paul (otherwise probably buyout Paul so he can go to a contender), gives guys extended injury rest, and pump minutes into guys like Branham, Wesley and Cissoko, to see if they have any future in the league. We have done it before, and could easily jump up 5-ish lottery places if we time it right.</p>

      <label for="lr3oubh" class="commentText"><p>CP3 is better than you think he is u/ajteitel  u/FeedbackSmart2162  and better than it seems most fans realize he is today. Last season he graded out as at least average on both ends of the floor based on the various metrics. He&rsquo;s still a definite plus offensively. He should really elevate Wemby offensively. Not just with the playmaking but also with the ability to hit the midrange jumper.</p>

<p>I also think Barnes is a solid addition because of his shooting, intangibles, and ability to make something happen as a creator. Not a high leverage creator but his bully ball can be effective and the Spurs needed more scoring, to me their weaknesses were more offensive than defensive&hellip;.I think CP3 is a significant upgrade defensively on Jones.</p>

<p>How many games the Spurs improve boils down to how impactful Wemby is. The West is a gauntlet though. I&rsquo;ll go with 38 wins. That&rsquo;s an improvement of 16 wins. But CP3 led teams never have losing records&hellip;.that Thunder team he had won 47 I believe, were given 0.2% chance to make it&hellip;.West is tougher than it is then, but I think this Spurs team is at least equally as talented as that Thunder team, and they didn&rsquo;t have Wemby.</p>

<p>44 wins wouldn&rsquo;t shock me in the slightest. I think Wemby is that impactful and this team clearly took a leap the second half of last season. They lost a massive amount of close games and blown leads. They&rsquo;re not as far away as some believe.</p>

      <label for="lr3z5vd" class="commentText"><p>Idc what people say they will be in the play-in tournament at minimum. The CP3 signing will be as good as advertised he won&rsquo;t put up insane stats and might even be inefficient but if there is one thing he is great at is maximizing the skillset of those around him. Fully expect them to be around the 40 win mark. Honestly a great signing for the spurs and wemby to have this kind of veteran presence/mentor. The guards on the team will also develop and the open looks CP3 creates for the team will be great.</p>
