      <p>Have there ever been cases in the history of the NBA (I&rsquo;m guessing there have been) where a team had both the best offensive and defensive rating in the regular season and didn&rsquo;t win the championship? On that, how many times has it happened where a team had both the best offensive and defensive rating in the regular season? I know one key thing about the warriors in 2016 that people pointed to after they lost was that they only had the 5th best defensive rating vs. the prior year where they were number 2 in offense and number 1 in defense but even that wouldn&rsquo;t satisfy the condition I&rsquo;m talking about obviously.</p>

<p>I saw some insane stat that his team was 2-26 in the few games he missed in his career.  The celtics went like 20-60 the year after he retired.</p>

<p>People discount him as the goat because he played with like 5 HOF, but there is a real chance he caried those guys to the hof</p>

<p>Edit: Celitcs went 34-48 not bad but the team went from winning the finals to a losing record.</p>

      <label for="l6pkmq9" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve always had this thought of maybe the reason they reached HoF status was because Russell impacted the game so much that he made some of his teammates be HoF material. I mean, you can&rsquo;t deny a spot in the Hall of Fame to someone who was a starter and won 6, 8, 10&hellip; rings.</p>

<p>Imagine if Draymond Green got drafted into another team like Charlotte or Detroit for example. Would he have evolved into the player he became during his prime years? Maybe, maybe not. For me he&rsquo;s the second most important player of that dynasty but without the Warriors system I have serious doubts about him being HoF material.</p>

<p>Thinking Basketball found that the Celtics played at a 35 win pace in the games Russell missed and a 59 win pace when he played, in the first episode of the greatest peaks series.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCKSvjBnCRQ" target="_blank">This video is a must watch if you are interested in Bill Russell or if you hold the opinion that he was carried by good teammates. It&rsquo;s also a must watch because it helps contextualize Wilt&rsquo;s crazy volume numbers.</a> The entire series is a must watch if you like Basketball to be honest.</p>
