      <label for="lrag1r9" class="commentText"><p>This is true. Jokic &ldquo;unlocked&rdquo; (for lack of a better term) Bruce Brown. And maybe he needs a high level creator to reach the same level of success.  Luka is one of the only other players who could replicate that for Brown. That&rsquo;s why I think he would be great for the Mavs.</p>

<p>Also, him being the guard to come in and play along side Luka/Kyrie when the other is out is also a good fit. He&rsquo;s more defensive minded and can still take on some ball handling responsibilities.</p>

<p>If the Nuggets weren&rsquo;t above the first apron, I think he would be a strong candidate to go back to the nuggets in a buy out scenario.</p>

      <label for="lrah95b" class="commentText"><p>The Nuggets have was Bruce did in Westbrook. People on here seem content to argue til they wear their keyboard keys that BB is a better player than RW which is irrelevant to fit playing within the Nuggets system, knowing his role and benefitting from playing with Jokic.</p>

<p>The Pacers quickly realized that what they thought they paid for wasn&rsquo;t what they got. No discredit to Brown, he can be an amazing role player in the right situation.</p>

<p>I just see the same conversation happening around KCP. Larger narrative is that Denver lost this amazing player when I think the reality is being in Denver made him look that appealing. Also, no discredit to KCP; won with LA, won with Denver. Great in the right situation.</p>

<p>But Jokic has and will continue to get guys paid because he is that good.</p>

It worked out perfectly fine for us, Toronto&rsquo;s the one that&rsquo;s stuck with having to trade a dude that&rsquo;s overpaid.</p>

<p>I disagree with your KCP analysis as well. Sure he might have been gassed up playing next to good playmakers, but 2-way wings will always be in demand.</p>

<p>Westbrook accepting a role is a whole other conversation.</p>

As long as you don&rsquo;t need him to create then he&rsquo;s pretty much plug and play. Way less situational than someone like Brown.</p>

      <label for="lraos13" class="commentText"><p>Brown is a career 33% 3pt shooter and on lower volume than KCP.</p>

<p>KCP is a 37% career shooter and has been about 40% over the last 5 years.</p>

<p>Brown also isn&rsquo;t much of a creator. You can get him into some movement actions but he&rsquo;s not playmaking. KCP is a much easier fit because of his shooting. With Brown to really unlock him you need to capitalize on his willingness to work off-ball and for his relative lack of shooting to not hamper your lineups. That&rsquo;s a big reason the Nuggets could use him so well. They didn&rsquo;t need him to be a knockdown shooter and Jokic is one of the best ever at finding cutters and creating opportunities for cutters. Plus, with Jokic, you don&rsquo;t need Brown to do any playmaking.</p>

<p>Outstanding defender, good rebounder for his size, great cutter, and willing to work his butt off. But he&rsquo;s not as easy to throw into any lineup as a similarly sized guy who also plays within the team concept, is a solid defender, and can also shoot 40% from 3.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not just Jokic, he was a pretty decent role player for the KD-Kyrie-Harden Nets as well, cutting into the space created by the stars and playing hard defense. He&rsquo;s a great Swiss army knife guy, but he&rsquo;s somewhere between a luxury off the bench and not a great starter. He was great with the Nuggets because he was a smart cutter for Jokic passes, a decent enough bench PG when Jokic and Murray sat, a good enough 3pt shooter, and a good defender at the 1, 2, or sometimes 3. He had a great year and showed what he can do, got paid starter money, traded for Siakam, and he doesn&rsquo;t fit the current Raptors. If a team can afford to have him as the first man off the bench, he&rsquo;ll probably show his value again, but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s a great starter for a playoff team. I bet he would do well for the Mavs</p>
