</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Since, nba expansion is a hot topic now. And most likely 2 teams will be added before 2020s end. Or maybe at 2030.</p>

<p>But the question is about expansion draft. For every expansion, there is an expansion draft.</p>

<p>Current Rules:</p>

<p>Each Nba team have 15 players in their roster. And they can only <strong>protect 8 players.</strong> So, the 7 players for each team that is unprotected will be available for expansion draft.</p>

<p>So, the 2 expansion teams will select from those set of players. (7 x  30 (teams))= 210 unprotected players.</p>

<p>But are you satisfied with the &ldquo;Protect 8 players rule&rdquo;?</p>

<p>Do you want to increase it to &ldquo;Protect 9&rdquo; or decrease it to &ldquo;Protect 7&rdquo; or &ldquo;Protect 6&rdquo; to help the expansion teams more?</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

      <label for="lml9zya" class="commentText"><p>8 is fine.</p>

<p>Because you also have to remember that the salary cap exists, so in most cases it won&rsquo;t be the &ldquo;best 8&rdquo; on each team. There will be a lot of examples of guys who are good rotation players, but because of their contracts, the FO&rsquo;s wouldn&rsquo;t mind losing them and rather keep some younger guys on cheap rookie scale deals.</p>

<p>And then it&rsquo;s up to the expansion teams to make smart decisions from those guys that are available.</p>

<p>I think expansion franchises should start off with a roughly average roster. But that isn’t how it’s worked the last few times. They start out in a big hole that they then have to dig themselves out of.</p>

<p>According to Pat Riley, as long as you have 8 you should be fine.</p>

      <label for="lmlibkn" class="commentText"><p>I would decrease to 7, just because some teams have racked up contracts in the top 4 of the team and most of the good NBA teams doesn&rsquo;t have 9 men rotation, but most likely they have 7 or 8&hellip;</p>

<p>I think this rule was good for the 80s and early 90s, but really showed its flaws when Toronto and Vancuver first, then Charlotte, where added.</p>

<p>The most important thing for me is that a new team should be allowed into the draft with just a lock on the 1st pick and entering with same % of taking the 2nd of a 4th worst team in the league (or something like this). And they shouldn&rsquo;t be capped from getting the 1st the next year either, otherwise you will have first disastrous years of Grizzlies again, together with the mediocrity of Charlotte.</p>

<p>I think there could also be &ldquo;grace period&rdquo; rules for expansion teams where they are given a competitive advantage in terms of roster construction for like the first 2 years. For example, maybe they have a higher salary cap for 2 years or trading for larger salaries is easier for them to match or maybe they get an extra MLE</p>

<p>Most teams don’t actually sacrifice core rotation players unless they have incredible depth. Oklahoma City is one of the few teams that might really be on edge about the losing a player.</p>

<p>Many teams will probably be using the slots to try to dump bad contracts.</p>

<p>I actually didn&rsquo;t know this. That means that, in an expansion draft with 2 teams, every team is guaranteed to lose a player. Assuming they draft for 15 roster spots.</p>

The point is not to make them instantly competing for the playoffs, the point is to just give them a bit of actual NBA level talent so they can play games without losing by 60 points every single night.</p>

<p>Going below 8 just really starts to unfairly penalize existing teams that have done a great job building their roster.  Even 8 will hurt the top couple teams, but 7 or even 6 starts to hurt most playoff teams.  And there&rsquo;s no major gain for the expansion team here - they&rsquo;re still going to struggle to be good for a couple years.</p>

<p>Just stick with 8.</p>

If it was 1 team, sure, maybe increase it from 8 players, but allowing <em>every</em> existing team to keep all 5 starters <strong>and</strong> 4+ bench players is absurd.</p>

<p>None of these players will play a role in the future of the franchise. So they select some who have value to trade them for picks or who can sell tickets to fill the arena. They can still eat big bad contracts afterwards by taking some picks for it. No reason to take them now in an expansion draft.</p>

<p>Its the draft of new players that is important for the expansion teams.</p>

<p>And the NBA will make sure, they are not rewarded for coming into the league and then compete in tanking with the other teams for the 1st pick the next year(s).</p>

<p>So they will build their team with whatever picks the NBA decides to give them at best.</p>
