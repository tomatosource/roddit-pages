</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Since, nba expansion is a hot topic now. And most likely 2 teams will be added before 2020s end. Or maybe at 2030.</p>

<p>But the question is about expansion draft. For every expansion, there is an expansion draft.</p>

<p>Current Rules:</p>

<p>Each Nba team have 15 players in their roster. And they can only <strong>protect 8 players.</strong> So, the 7 players for each team that is unprotected will be available for expansion draft.</p>

<p>So, the 2 expansion teams will select from those set of players. (7 x  30 (teams))= 210 unprotected players.</p>

<p>But are you satisfied with the &ldquo;Protect 8 players rule&rdquo;?</p>

<p>Do you want to increase it to &ldquo;Protect 9&rdquo; or decrease it to &ldquo;Protect 7&rdquo; or &ldquo;Protect 6&rdquo; to help the expansion teams more?</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

      <label for="lml9zya" class="commentText"><p>8 is fine.</p>

<p>Because you also have to remember that the salary cap exists, so in most cases it won&rsquo;t be the &ldquo;best 8&rdquo; on each team. There will be a lot of examples of guys who are good rotation players, but because of their contracts, the FO&rsquo;s wouldn&rsquo;t mind losing them and rather keep some younger guys on cheap rookie scale deals.</p>

<p>And then it&rsquo;s up to the expansion teams to make smart decisions from those guys that are available.</p>

      <label for="lmm9pr6" class="commentText"><p>Yea the more interesting convo to me is how contracts go with the player and the ensuing strategies. For example I could see the Suns making Beal available. He’d be the best player out there but how important is cap space to an expansion team in the first few years?</p>

<p>You would think traditionally it may even be hard to reach with the cap with the majority of players made available likely being on the cheaper end. Will they have to add “bad” contracts just to reach the cap floor?</p>

<p>I think expansion franchises should start off with a roughly average roster. But that isn’t how it’s worked the last few times. They start out in a big hole that they then have to dig themselves out of.</p>

      <label for="lmmbwoj" class="commentText"><p>It largely ends up doing the same thing, just distributes the burden differently.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, there is a fixed number of players available so they have to take from someone. If they draft #1 and #2, the costs fall on the worst teams since they now draft 2 slots later. They don&rsquo;t technically lose a player, but the cost to your franchise is the same none the less.</p>

It&rsquo;s a star dominated league and nobody is letting an All Star or young uber prospect go even at 5.  Expansion teams aren&rsquo;t getting any top 100 players no matter how many you protect.</p>

<p>Besides, the goal is just to give the expansion teams something to start off so they can actually compete at an NBA level, not to make them good.</p>

      <label for="lmm90cg" class="commentText"><p>They don&rsquo;t need to get All Stars in the expansion draft itself. They can draft good role players + decent prospects and then use those as trading chips to get the roster that makes sense. It&rsquo;s contradictory to say that roster protections don&rsquo;t matter, but also we need to let teams protect heavily.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Who says that&rsquo;s the goal? That&rsquo;s just your opinion. I think the starting point for an expansion team should be mediocre. Right now we basically say &ldquo;here&rsquo;s one of the worst rosters in the league, good luck fixing that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Especially considering the head-winds expansion teams face (no established fan-base, trying to build an organization from the ground up), I think they deserve a better starting point than they have gotten in the past.</p>

      <label for="lmlfkov" class="commentText"><p>8 seems like a reasonable number especially since once a team loses a player, they can’t lose anymore.</p>

<p>Most teams don’t actually sacrifice core rotation players unless they have incredible depth. Oklahoma City is one of the few teams that might really be on edge about the losing a player.</p>

<p>Many teams will probably be using the slots to try to dump bad contracts.</p>

<p>I actually didn&rsquo;t know this. That means that, in an expansion draft with 2 teams, every team is guaranteed to lose a player. Assuming they draft for 15 roster spots.</p>

As OKC, I would protect SGA, JDub, Chet, Wiggins, Wallace, Joe, Dort, and Hartenstein which would leave Caruso, JWill, Dieng, Kenny Hustle, and our rookies Topic / Jones available.  If I&rsquo;m the expansion team, I snap up Caruso and immediately trade him for a first and a second because there&rsquo;s no way Caruso is voluntarily playing with my team the next season (UFA).</p>

<p>Maybe swing on Topic if you really think he&rsquo;s a top prospect like he was originally projected to be prior to the injury.</p>

<p>Your 8 most valuable and 8 best performing might have big differences</p>

<p>For example on our roster, 8 best would be Haliburton, Nembhard, Siakam, Turner, Nesmith, McConnel, Toppin, and Mathurin.  So one of those is not being protected for Walker.</p>

<p>In my example we likely lose Nesmith.  Only issue?  We now have a hole at SF, still above salary cap and below luxury tax. So free agency gets us nadda. This is really going to mess with some teams rosters.  I imagine there are quite a lot of teams that could be put into worse binds than us.</p>

      <label for="lmlibkn" class="commentText"><p>I would decrease to 7, just because some teams have racked up contracts in the top 4 of the team and most of the good NBA teams doesn&rsquo;t have 9 men rotation, but most likely they have 7 or 8&hellip;</p>

<p>I think this rule was good for the 80s and early 90s, but really showed its flaws when Toronto and Vancuver first, then Charlotte, where added.</p>

<p>The most important thing for me is that a new team should be allowed into the draft with just a lock on the 1st pick and entering with same % of taking the 2nd of a 4th worst team in the league (or something like this). And they shouldn&rsquo;t be capped from getting the 1st the next year either, otherwise you will have first disastrous years of Grizzlies again, together with the mediocrity of Charlotte.</p>

<p>I think there could also be &ldquo;grace period&rdquo; rules for expansion teams where they are given a competitive advantage in terms of roster construction for like the first 2 years. For example, maybe they have a higher salary cap for 2 years or trading for larger salaries is easier for them to match or maybe they get an extra MLE</p>

      <label for="lmlxw5h" class="commentText"><p>Seems pretty counterintuitive to propose expanding by 2 teams and then also increasing the number of protected players each existing team gets to keep. If it was 1 team, sure, maybe increase it from 8 players, but allowing <em>every</em> existing team to keep all 5 starters <strong>and</strong> 4+ bench players is absurd.</p>

      <label for="lmm7jjc" class="commentText"><p>8 seems like too many for most teams. The expansion teams would be garbage.</p>

<p>I’d propose something like 6+2. Meaning you can protect any 6 players you want, plus two additional non-lottery young players (3 seasons or less?) as prospects. You guarantee each team gets to keep a functional squad, and doesn’t lose prospects. You also ensure the expansion teams actually get interesting players to pick from and aren’t just g-league squads.</p>

<p>Also I would expect that given how high the expansion fees are going to be, likely approaching if not exceeding 1 billion dollars, that the new ownership groups are not going accept expansion rules that create a team that is as bad as the previous expansion teams.</p>

      <label for="lmlfwqz" class="commentText"><p>Doesnt matter.</p>

<p>None of these players will play a role in the future of the franchise. So they select some who have value to trade them for picks or who can sell tickets to fill the arena. They can still eat big bad contracts afterwards by taking some picks for it. No reason to take them now in an expansion draft.</p>

<p>Its the draft of new players that is important for the expansion teams.</p>

<p>And the NBA will make sure, they are not rewarded for coming into the league and then compete in tanking with the other teams for the 1st pick the next year(s).</p>

<p>So they will build their team with whatever picks the NBA decides to give them at best.</p>

The point is not to make them instantly competing for the playoffs, the point is to just give them a bit of actual NBA level talent so they can play games without losing by 60 points every single night.</p>

<p>Going below 8 just really starts to unfairly penalize existing teams that have done a great job building their roster.  Even 8 will hurt the top couple teams, but 7 or even 6 starts to hurt most playoff teams.  And there&rsquo;s no major gain for the expansion team here - they&rsquo;re still going to struggle to be good for a couple years.</p>

<p>Just stick with 8.</p>
