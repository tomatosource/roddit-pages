      <p>As a Lakers fan, mine would be the 2022-23 season. The post trade deadline and playoff run was so enjoyable to watch until we met the Nuggets.</p>

<p>Reaves controlling and winning the game in the clutch against the Grizzlies on the road in Memphis in his playoff debut, while having LeBron and AD was crazy and so exciting to watch. The “I’m Him” exclamation was awesome to watch live.</p>

<p>Beating the Grizzlies in that series and watching all of our wins in that series was extremely fun.</p>

<p>The game 6 blow out win made me feel like we were kind of back to the 2019-20 team where we just needed to surround LeBron and AD with shooters and could win the championship.</p>

<p>The Warriors series win was awesome and all of our wins in that series were extremely enjoyable to watch.</p>

<p>The Lonnie Walker 4th quarter in game 4 to power us to the win was amazing to watch.</p>

<p>I had incredible confidence that we were going to win the championship but after game 2 against Denver, I was very worried and then it was squashed after losing game 3 at home.</p>

      <label for="lo211yk" class="commentText"><p>That run was crazy to watch.</p>

<p>Jimmy, Caleb Martin and the rest of the players were playing incredibly. The whole team were hitting 3’s at absurdly efficient rates and were insanely clutch.</p>

<p>It was definitely the most fun I had cheering for a non-Lakers team.</p>
