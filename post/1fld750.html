      <p>As a Lakers fan, mine would be the 2022-23 season. The post trade deadline and playoff run was so enjoyable to watch until we met the Nuggets.</p>

<p>Reaves controlling and winning the game in the clutch against the Grizzlies on the road in Memphis in his playoff debut, while having LeBron and AD was crazy and so exciting to watch. The “I’m Him” exclamation was awesome to watch live.</p>

<p>Beating the Grizzlies in that series and watching all of our wins in that series was extremely fun.</p>

<p>The game 6 blow out win made me feel like we were kind of back to the 2019-20 team where we just needed to surround LeBron and AD with shooters and could win the championship.</p>

<p>The Warriors series win was awesome and all of our wins in that series were extremely enjoyable to watch.</p>

<p>The Lonnie Walker 4th quarter in game 4 to power us to the win was amazing to watch.</p>

<p>I had incredible confidence that we were going to win the championship but after game 2 against Denver, I was very worried and then it was squashed after losing game 3 at home.</p>

      <label for="lo22zai" class="commentText"><p>The 2012 San Antonio Spurs were One of the more dominant teams in recent memory that I think absolutely everyone has forgotten about.</p>

<p>In a lockout shortened season had the winning percentage equivalent to a 63 win team. And they absolutely thumped teams that year. A lot of the time they looked like they were just coasting</p>

<p>As a Spurs fan it was particularly enjoyable because we had kind of been sailing through uneasy Waters with 2008-2010 Where we very much did not look like a team that had much of a shot at winning a championship&hellip; Probably for the first time in the Duncan area.</p>

<p>Then 2011 happened Where we finally looked like we were back on top only for one of the most devastating, and honestly not surprising, first round upsets in basketball history To smack us in the face And make me, and I think a lot of the fan base, wonder if that group really did have much more in them</p>

<p>2012 is really where pop came up with the beautiful game, and watching it develop throughout the year. Seen that motion offense hum and purr and realizing that these guys were legit, and probably not going anywhere for a few years was a jolt of optimism I personally need it as a fan.</p>

<p>Then running off 20 freaking straight winds to end the year and through the playoffs Was crazy</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone really talks about it because of how it ended (ending a 20-game winning streak with four straight playoff losses is rough) But that group deserves more love than they get. They&rsquo;re greatly overshadowed by the devastating failures of the 2011 and 2013 team, and one of the most memorable and enjoyable championship groups in recent NBA history in the 2014 team.</p>

      <label for="lo2bkwn" class="commentText"><p>Those Spurs looked absolutely unstoppable–OKC rallying from 0-2 and peeling off four straight wins was jaw-dropping. I remember Al Jefferson being interviewed after game 3 of the Jazz-Spurs series and saying (even before the series was over!) that he didn&rsquo;t think anybody could stop that Spurs team.</p>

      <label for="lo2cnvp" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I remember that. I remember people trying to criticize Big Al when he straight up was like, there&rsquo;s nothing you can do they&rsquo;re unstoppable. Like in his defense that Spurs team just were so clinical during that run. And those first two games against OKC, they looked super comfortable as well</p>

<p>Definitely one of the more shocking turns of events watching that team get &ldquo; figured out&rdquo; by that super young and talented thunder team. Even then, though, I don&rsquo;t remember being as heartbroken as other times as a Spurs fan because it felt like what I watched was super sustainable (And they did go on to produce three more super dominant beautiful game seasons before transitioning into a more Leonard focused offense)</p>

<p>The 21 finals run season was magical for us until we lost to Milwaukee.  Chris Paul was so close to getting a chip. He respect him so much because he is such a competitor.</p>

<p>7SOL Suns with Nash, STAT, Matrix, Joe Johnson, Diaw, Bell etc were so fun to watch.  Also frustrating that we couldn’t get over the hump.  There were some great playoff series with the clippers, lakers, spurs and mavs.  I felt we got hosed by the NBA against the Spurs with the Horry push and suspensions. That was our championship to win that year.  Still hate the Spurs.</p>

<p>Lastly the era of 1993 - 1996 KJ Kevin Johnson, Thunder Dan Majarle, MVP Charley Barkley, Ceballos, Ainge.  We had great seasons each year but lost to the eventual champions: Bulls, Rockets, Rockets.</p>

      <label for="lo2nljn" class="commentText"><p>2015-2016 Spurs…</p>

<p>67 wins, largest margin of victory in the league, Duncan’s final season, 40-1 home record (73 win GSW team dashing hopes of perfection). Unfortunately couldn’t take down an incredibly tough OKC squad in the second round. The West was murderers’ row.</p>

<p>2013 is my backup choice for obvious reasons.</p>
