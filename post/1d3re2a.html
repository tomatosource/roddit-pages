</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>My wife is a T4 paraplegic and has been for about a year and a half. We haven’t had any sex since she became this way and recently she asked me if I’d be interested in trying to have sex and I said I’d love to. Everything seemed to be fine actually, while we were having sex I asked her if she was enjoying herself and she said she was. I thought she was enjoying it. Afterwards I asked her how she felt and she told me that she couldn’t really feel anything sexually besides me kissing on her, but that she enjoyed seeing me enjoy myself with her. This honestly hurt me a little bit as she couldn’t enjoy herself sexually and now it feels as if I just took advantage of her. I feel like a monster.</p>

      <label for="l69hq20" class="commentText"><p>It’s sweet that you want her to feel pleasure, too. Whatever she can feel, focus on those areas if you two want to do it again. Breathing in her ear, playing with her hair, eye contact. Making sure to include her at all times could help the negative feeling of “using” her go away. Like others have said, the warmth and closeness that comes with intimacy is what she’s looking for, she knows better than anyone she unfortunately can’t feel it but is still longing for that closeness. It would probably be tougher for her to cope with her injury if she had to lose that connection with you forever.</p>

BDEMoves on TikTok (I know, I know - i think she has an IG too) is a late 30’s and excellent resource for this, she focuses on women and is an amazing educator.

I don’t do this every time he asks, but sometimes we have sex and it’s just him. He feels awful about not getting me off but honestly it feels good for me to be able to make him feel good. There’s a closeness to it that’s enjoyable even if I don’t get the big finish. It’s kind of like giving your SO a back rub. You don’t get anything out of it yourself except for the satisfaction of pleasing your SO. I know my situation isn’t the same as yours but I thought this might help.</p>

      <label for="l69qijb" class="commentText"><p>Exactly this OP. Some otherwise able-bodied women don’t get a lot of physical pleasure out of sex, but do it because they love their partner, and want to give the parter pleasure and to feel close.  These are perfectly valid reasons to have sex.</p>

<p>You didn’t do anything wrong!!</p>

<p>I do think it is very important to have a conversation about what you can do to make the experience more rewarding for her, and then TAKE HER ANSWERS at face value! She is a grown-ass adult, and being physically disabled has not changed that.</p>

<p>I am sure the last 18 months have been very difficult for both of you as you have adjusted to the new reality. Men are much more likely to leave a partner who becomes disabled than women, and you are sticking around which is great. Now you have to communicate, and this is probably going to take more than one serious conversation.</p>

<p>But please don’t make the mistake of disregarding her autonomy.  She is still a person who can consent or not consent as she chooses. Best of luck to you both as you navigate this change.</p>

At least this way she knows that you can enjoy yourself through her. psychologically she may like the intimacy and knowing that you are enjoying yourself.
Ultimately talk to her and figure out what’s going to make you both feel comfortable. You’re married, through sickness and health, just gotta work as a team and I’m sure you can keep going.
Wish you all the best</p>

However, (this may come across as rude) it’s your fucking wife my man. You shouldn’t feel bad for anything. She gave you consent and did it for you! She’s a golden woman, ideal wife!

      <label for="l69ltzi" class="commentText"><p>Intimacy comes in all forms and does not have to end in a literal orgasm. There’s no definition for the “end zone” of adult time. It’s supposed to a pleasant trip, not a sports event. If you get the confetti canons, great, but what matters is the closeness you feel during it.</p>

      <label for="l69jhp5" class="commentText"><p>Do you like going down on a girl?</p>

<p>I do. Sure it doesn’t give me any like physical satisfaction but I get a whole lot of mental satisfaction from seeing her enjoy it.</p>

<p>It’s probably even more intense for her. She said she felt the kissing and all, expand and work on that.</p>

<p>Maybe idk like tease kissing at times? That can make the feeling more intense when she does finally get kissed. That’s really a convo to have with her.</p>

It’s not wrong to worry about hurting her, but unless there’s a reason she’d lie to you, and you can’t trust her, I’d consider therapy to see what’s going on with you. I don’t know your past together, if she had always been disabled or if this is a recent thing. But you are allowed to have feelings about being a caregiver for someone you love. You can worry and hope they’re always comfortable. But in this case, she sounds very comfortable with what happened. You need to work through what’s going on with you.</p>

<p>I can’t speak for your wife but if I had an injury that caused me to become paraplegic and I thought I could no longer have sex with my husband my greatest fear would be for him to leave me due to my injuries and if he was to give it to me like nothing ever happened and enjoy himself like he did before I would feel a little bit more like the old me than the new me.</p>

<p>Hope folks can understand my point of view it made sense to me lol</p>

      <label for="l69l5q6" class="commentText"><p>I suggest talking to your partner and seeing what new things you can do to bring her pleasure. It seems to me like you feel like you’re taking advantage of her because you feel like you’re not able to reciprocate the physical intimacy- maybe try kissing her neck and blowing softly by her ears, learn her working erogenous zones and find new ways to include them. It can be fun, too, like using a feather or playing a game of copying the kisses on each other. Penetrative sex isn’t the only way to orgasm, being an enthusiastic partner having fun and paying attention to what feels good for her would probably help you feel better about this. Hang in there, new normals don’t always have to be bad, you may even learn new ways to be closer.</p>

      <label for="l69ltlu" class="commentText"><p>I do think you’re in your head and maybe you should talk to your wife about how she felt and how it made you feel. Communication is always the key to a great marriage. I hope you’re both able to have a healthy conversation and a long happy marriage.</p>

<p>A friend of mine was on vacation with her husband and his family. His sister had just had a baby and his mom was driving. On the way back home his mom started getting sleepy but didn’t bother to tell anyone. She continued to drive and fell asleep behind the wheel. My friend unbuckled her seatbelt to grab the baby when the accident happened. She saved the baby but became paraplegic. When she was released from the hospital she tried to go home and found out her husband moved another woman in and had moved her stuff to her parent’s house. He told her he couldn’t be with her because she “couldn’t walk anymore and refused to take care of her the rest of his life”</p>

<p>We tried to keep her spirits high but she was extremely depressed and suicidal after moving back home. It was tough talking to her and visiting her, she’s doing physical therapy now and is happy with her life. I think what you’re doing is truly heartwarming, I wish my friend’s husband would have shown the type of love and commitment you are with your wife. You really have no clue how much these moments may mean to her.</p>

      <label for="l69d9wi" class="commentText"><p>I once heard a man give a talk about how he’d had prostate problems and surgery resulting in him not being able to have sex, this happened when he was in his 20’s. He talked about having an implant placed that enabled him to pleasure his wife. He had it replaced in his 50’s so that he could continue to do so. He got nothing out of it except the pleasure he took in knowing he was able to satisfy his wife.</p>

<p>Let your wife do this for you. Talk to her frankly and listen to her. She loves you and wants to do this for you.</p>

Which seemed to be what she was looking for if she physically can’t feel anything sexually and still wanted to engage. All this should teach you, is that she might like more intimate affectionate acts. Kissing, stroking candles, music, massage, etc.</p>

My favorite of sex is for our bodies to be near each other and smelling each other and kissing and falling asleep naked. If I don’t have an orgasm he feels like it’s the end of the world. I don’t.

      <label for="l69jg41" class="commentText"><p>Pleasure from sex is WAY more than just an orgasm or physical sensation. I know I get more actual satisfying pleasure from pleasing my partner than I do from any physical pleasure of my own.</p>

<p>Right now, while your feelings are understandable, you really need to get a hold of them. Because you&rsquo;re at risk of starting to do something pretty shitty to your wife that would probably hurt her in ways she would struggle to recover from, ever.</p>

<p><strong>Your wife isn&rsquo;t lying to you.</strong> She initiated sex, she had a great time and got a lot of pleasure out of it. If you actually trust her instead of reacting like she&rsquo;s lying to you, you could actually work with her to find more ways for her to experience physical pleasure while you two have sex. In fact, you two could find a sex therapist who has experience with physically disabled people who could give you some amazing coaching on how to have a fantastic &amp; mutually satisfying sex life that brings you closer together than ever. If you can&rsquo;t find one locally, you can find a good one online. This would be such a valuable investment in your life together going forward.</p>

<p>Your wife desperately needs you to treat her like the vibrant, passionate woman she was before she became a paraplegic. The more you treat her emotionally and mentally like some invalid and infantilize her as if she&rsquo;s no longer a capable adult, the worse her whole situation will get on every level and the more compartmentalized and sterile your relationship will get.</p>

<p>Your feelings are valid, but you cannot indulge them like this. Are you in therapy with someone who has experience in spouses in relationships with physically disabled people? You need a professional who not only you have the space to share these feelings with, but who can coach you through these feelings and give you the mental and emotional resilience to avoid spirals and changes in how you treat your wife?</p>

<p>If you allow these fears and feelings to dwell, you&rsquo;re going to broadcast them to her. The little looks, the hesitance, the tones in your voice, small shifts in your body language&hellip; she&rsquo;s going to pick it up and know you don&rsquo;t see her as your wife, and instead see her as helpless, a project you have to care for. It will truly ruin her slowly.</p>

<p>So get your shit together man. You obviously love her. Do the right things here and learn how to adjust to this new reality so you two can thrive together. Life is transitioning into a new look and feel, but your relationship doesn&rsquo;t have to change into some sexless caretaker situation, she is still the woman you fell for, she&rsquo;s still able to participate in almost everything with you, it&rsquo;s just going to look and feel different.</p>

<p>Shift your perspectives here. Look for the opportunity for joy and experience together and learn how to make those things happen to their fullest.</p>

It’s not only about you, and by being bummed that she didn’t feel YOU… that’s still making it about you. She liked it? It’s a win!</p>

<p>Fun fact. A lot of people with spinal cord injuries can still orgasm but you just have to locate the place on her body that allows her do so. It’s usually just above the loss of sensation.</p>

      <label for="l69qp1w" class="commentText"><p>Quad here. My husband does so much for me. It makes me happy giving him enjoyment. That&rsquo;s what makes me happy. As for what makes me feel good since I can&rsquo;t feel anything down there, I enjoy shoulder massages, when he runs his fingers through my hair. Even though I cannot use my arms and legs, I enjoy a good massage.</p>

But I&rsquo;m sure she enjoyed the intimacy, the passion and most of all, being treated like a woman(not that you haven&rsquo;t been testing her that way).. but I&rsquo;m sure you made her feel whole again, even if she couldn&rsquo;t feel it physically. In my opinion, you reminded her and made her feel like your wife again and that&rsquo;s the best thing you could ever hope to do. You showed her that just because she doesn&rsquo;t move the same way she used to, she still does it for you and you still have the hots for her. When I think of &ldquo;til death do us part&rdquo;, I think of the sort of love you 2 have for each other. I wish both of you a long happy marriage and nothing but the best</p>

<p>She told you twice she enjoyed the sex. Why are you convinced she didn&rsquo;t? Because she didn&rsquo;t have an orgasm? Watching you enjoy yourself seems like the whole point for her since she&rsquo;s the one that initiated to begin with.</p>

      <label for="l6a1732" class="commentText"><p>Hold on hold on. I&rsquo;m not an exact match for this, but in my early 20s I had nerve damage that prevented me from feeling sexual pleasure.</p>

<p>And let me tell you, I still fucking loved having sex with the woman I loved. I loved her moans and her kisses and her orgasms.</p>

<p>Sex is so much more than the genitals. If your wife says she was happy with it, LISTEN TO YOUR WIFE.</p>

<p>and try new stuff. explore new ways to excite her and allow her to enjoy herself. even if her body doesn&rsquo;t feel the same sensations that it used to, her mind probably still wants to feel sexy and wanted.</p>

I’m sure it’s not easy to realize that you can’t enjoy sex in the same way but I know that it made her feel good that you were so on board with trying even though she is still paraplegic now. That’s a really beautiful love that you both share. Don’t feel guilty. She wanted to do that with you and I’m sure she was hesitant about being open simply because she didn’t want you to feel this way because she doesn’t feel that way. You both love each other you’ll just have to find a new normal way of enjoying intimacy.</p>

Try to reframe the entire experience or see it from her side. appreciate how good it made her feel to be that close with you after months without it. You’re not a monster, you’re part of a couple adjusting to circumstances and it sounds like you’re finding your way. Maybe she didn’t physically feel the typical feelings but it sounds like she was fulfilled and it made her happy. That’s a really good thing!</p>

She has also probably been living with fear and guilt that she can no longer satisfy you and more fear that you no longer feel attracted to her. You might tell her everyday she is beautiful and you love her, but being intimate with her will be much more meaningful to her. I would bet she is feeling a sense of peace, happiness, and love she has not only missed but desperately needed for a long time</p>

 you at least.</p>

<p>I think she appreciated that u still find her attractive as a women and for the person she is and not treat her any different becuz of the condition she has. She is still a woman who can give consent and enjoy intimacy (even if it’s different from before).</p>

      <label for="l69l1q4" class="commentText"><p>She initiated and said she enjoyed herself, everything went well until you started second-guessing yourself after.</p>

<p>She didn&rsquo;t experience sensation as she did in the past but she definitely has a sense of adventure! This is a new thing, so keep talking to her about what she finds fun and sexy.</p>

      <label for="l69l78j" class="commentText"><p>God. Imagine being paraplegic, missing sex, asking your partner if you guys can try, you mentally and emotionally enjoying it despite the lack of physical sensation, and then your partner reducing the experience to physical sensations that you are never going to be physically capable of experiencing again. Honestly dude, how selfish can you be? Sounds like sex for you is purely physical and you get no emotional joy from it, and therefore you assume she’s as shallow as you are. I feel so sad for her. Imagine finally getting to enjoy sex again, and then your partner getting upset because you have a permanent disability that affects physical sensation. I’d be devastated to find out my partner doesn’t value emotional intimacy during sex.</p>

      <label for="l69lhlq" class="commentText"><p>I don’t have experience with somebody who is physically disabled but I think I can speak for a lot of ppl when I say that your wife wouldn’t have said something if she didn’t love you. I definitely agree it’ll take time to adjust. But I think that this is just a testament to your relationship with her.</p>
