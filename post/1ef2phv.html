<p>That kinda defeats part of the purpose of the cap though. The cap is there to make sure one team can&rsquo;t just spend a shit ton and be the best team cause of rich owners. Part of that is making it harder to bring new talent in. But the other side of it is making sure teams can&rsquo;t just hoard talent, and forces teams to make choices on their guys.</p>

<p>Like I think this is one of those things that makes sense on paper, and I can see why some people want it. But it kinda is the opposite direction of stuff the league is trying to do with parity</p>

      <label for="lfiahgm" class="commentText"><p>If the point of a salary cap is to limit spending, than anything that allows you to go over the cap, is lessening the degree to which you’re limiting spending.</p>

<p>What is the difference between an exception that lets me sign a guy to the MLE vs let’s me sign a long tenured player to a larger contract?</p>

<p>In a soft cap, you just say you can go over the cap. So the MLE technically counts against the cap, but you can go over it.</p>

<p>In a hard cap with the ability to sign a long tenured player to a larger contract. This is functionally the same as a soft cap with only 1 exception.</p>

      <label for="lficinr" class="commentText"><p>The NBA hasn&rsquo;t had a hard cap though. And it doesn&rsquo;t seem like anyone is interested in that either.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is they want parity. So they put in rules that force parity. Some of those rules are the different luxury taxes. And some of those, with the 2nd apron stuff, are limits to team building options.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to make it even easier to teams to keep their top end talent. As it is, teams already have an advantage with re-signing or extending their best player. What problem is being solved by giving teams a discount on their stars?</p>

<p>Also, you gotta remember that the players have to agree to these deals. Why would the players want an exception that makes it less likely that their teams will trade them when they ask for it? The MLE is something that gives players more chances to make more money than on a minimum.</p>

<p>  I think you’re having a hard time because for some reason you think YOU have to understand what the CBA needs to do lol. It’s a labor agreement that represents player and owner interest. Not fans.</p>

<p>Why is “if teams want to spend, they can” good though? This does not improve the product as far as I can see.</p>

<p>I don’t need to understand every little detail of the cap, but I do think basic fan understanding of team building is good. Free agency and trades are big attention getters.</p>

      <label for="lfiche0" class="commentText"><p>Exactly this. The league thinks that parity is what is going to drive league profitability, and those metrics are measured on the scale of millions of viewers. The amount of money that the league makes from casual armchair-GMing is relatively small. And I&rsquo;m not knocking the armchair-GMing, I do it way too much, but I don&rsquo;t expect the league to factor us into their CBA.</p>

<p>Everything in the CBA has a purpose, sometimes it&rsquo;s not obvious why. Every now and then I get a &lsquo;huh, so that&rsquo;s why they included that,&rsquo; moment. Sometimes one provision is closing a loophole that another provision opens, even when the two don&rsquo;t seem linked.</p>

<p>My hot take theory about us is we traded for Dame in part because of the new CBA - we were going to be screwed no matter what due to the 2nd apron so why not push all the chips in? Especially last summer, when teams could still trade multiple players before all the 2nd apron handicaps were implemented.</p>

<p>My one caveat is each team should have gotten a one-time amnesty waiver for a contract that was signed before the new CBA was ratified.</p>

<p>Deals like the MPJ max were agreed upon in a significantly different cap environment, and teams shouldn’t necessarily be punished for not accounting for a 2nd apron that didn’t even exist yet.</p>

      <label for="lfi82fi" class="commentText"><p>For all the complaints from the James Dolan&rsquo;s of the world, the truth is this is the CBA most teams wanted because they feel it gives them a real chance to retain their own stars long term. It was never about parity. It&rsquo;s about restricting player movement. They don&rsquo;t want superteams and the CBA (as well as previous lux tax increases) have all been done with the goal of preventing superteams from launching. I think it&rsquo;s made less of an impact than people think this offseason though&mdash;the bigger impact is the pure lack of space teams have&mdash;but it will make an impact going forward because teams are gonna have to be more targeted and more intentional with deals.</p>

<p>Teams will still make trades but most teams had already gotten their deals in prior to the offseason. The big thing is, what we&rsquo;ve seen over the last several years, and this is why I don&rsquo;t think the new CBA has necessarily been as earth shattering as some think, because these trends were already occurring&hellip;.stars are gonna lock into deals with their current teams and free agency isn&rsquo;t going to be the way to make acquisitions that dramatically change your team&rsquo;s future. If you want the best of the best talent it&rsquo;s gonna be through trades. That&rsquo;s already been the case though. That, and teams will be reluctant to use their full MLE so to not be hard capped.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have enough good teams for that though. And even the worst team in the league (Pistons going by last year) would destroy all the G-League teams. You&rsquo;d have to probably expand to 36 teams and split it into 2 leagues of 18 to get anywhere close to that level and it&rsquo;s never happening.</p>

<p>Not to mention why is the NFLs cap structure inherently good?</p>

      <label for="lfi50rq" class="commentText"><p>Knicks getting Brunson on a bargain would have given them an A+, even if they traded everyone away for nothing in return lol. I disagree with them having a bad off-season.</p>

<p>Same with 76ers. I don&rsquo;t trust Embiid to have a long timetable. I give those legs 3 years. George being old does not concern me at all given their short timetable and the fact they&rsquo;d be fine with him being their 3rd option.</p>

<p>Derozan going to the Kings doesn&rsquo;t move the needle for me either way. They are better and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to impact Murray in a negative way. I also don&rsquo;t see them as title contenders.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, I actually do think the new CBA is good for players when you consider the other avenues they have to make money and the lifting of rules on marijuana. If I&rsquo;m a player though, I&rsquo;m calling BS on any owner that tries to use the 2nd apron against my ability to make money. Celtics just won a title being over the 2nd apron and are title favorites again being over the 2nd apron.</p>
