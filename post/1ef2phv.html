      <label for="lfi58p1" class="commentText"><p>I mostly agree.</p>

<p>My one caveat is each team should have gotten a one-time amnesty waiver for a contract that was signed before the new CBA was ratified.</p>

<p>Deals like the MPJ max were agreed upon in a significantly different cap environment, and teams shouldn’t necessarily be punished for not accounting for a 2nd apron that didn’t even exist yet.</p>

      <label for="lfij4lo" class="commentText"><p>but i wonder if those players prefer to play for their original team rather than being bought out and having to sign for a minimum. Who knows. I guess amnesty could benefit both sides if the player wants to ring chase, but sucks if the said player wants minutes. I can see it from players side not wanting amnesty option available for the teams.</p>

      <label for="lfiiqnv" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;ll have the same thing that&rsquo;s going on in the NFL now: QBs being paid mind-numbingly large salaries and a few super-star non-QBs getting the bag, but most players being year-to-year.  The uber super-stars will always get paid, but you&rsquo;ll have most of the roster on rookie contracts and minimum-ish type deals.</p>

<p>I absolutely don&rsquo;t favor a max salary, but the NFL&rsquo;s risk profile is changing the game: a QB injury sinks an entire season, because so many resources are allocated to just that one spot.  It&rsquo;s bad for the game, in the long run.  The rules changes have made playing defense nearly impossible, because the league has to protect QBs making $50+ million a year.</p>

<p>The league is then paying pass rushers and not paying offensive lineman.  Lineman are unbelievably expensive, pass rushers are cheaper, so teams pay those, and that&rsquo;s a bad combination for protecting a $50+ million a year investment.</p>

<p>The NFL structure is not perfect either, it creates a ton of perverse incentives.</p>

<p>I also think the soft cap favors proven, older players, who may be overrepresented in union leadership relative to fringe guys with short careers. In general, the players&rsquo; union, representing current players as it does, is probably against churning a bunch of mid-20s guys looking for cheap role players, which we&rsquo;d probably see more of with a harder cap.</p>

<p>Caps do change how money is spread between players, which matters more to the union though. If all the non stars wind up on minimums there will be a push to change the CBA.

<p>That kinda defeats part of the purpose of the cap though. The cap is there to make sure one team can&rsquo;t just spend a shit ton and be the best team cause of rich owners. Part of that is making it harder to bring new talent in. But the other side of it is making sure teams can&rsquo;t just hoard talent, and forces teams to make choices on their guys.</p>

<p>Like I think this is one of those things that makes sense on paper, and I can see why some people want it. But it kinda is the opposite direction of stuff the league is trying to do with parity</p>

<p>What is the difference between an exception that lets me sign a guy to the MLE vs let’s me sign a long tenured player to a larger contract?</p>

<p>In a soft cap, you just say you can go over the cap. So the MLE technically counts against the cap, but you can go over it.</p>

<p>In a hard cap with the ability to sign a long tenured player to a larger contract. This is functionally the same as a soft cap with only 1 exception.</p>

      <label for="lficinr" class="commentText"><p>The NBA hasn&rsquo;t had a hard cap though. And it doesn&rsquo;t seem like anyone is interested in that either.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is they want parity. So they put in rules that force parity. Some of those rules are the different luxury taxes. And some of those, with the 2nd apron stuff, are limits to team building options.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to make it even easier to teams to keep their top end talent. As it is, teams already have an advantage with re-signing or extending their best player. What problem is being solved by giving teams a discount on their stars?</p>

<p>Also, you gotta remember that the players have to agree to these deals. Why would the players want an exception that makes it less likely that their teams will trade them when they ask for it? The MLE is something that gives players more chances to make more money than on a minimum.</p>

I like parity but I also don&rsquo;t love how it&rsquo;s almost impossible to keep a successful team together, it would also prevent the roleplayers from getting hosed by a handful of stars taking up the whole salary cap.</p>

The best prospects will still go to the worst teams because no contender is going to outbid a bad team for a rookie under a hard cap-bad teams will overpay rookies initially in the hopes that they’ll be better than their contracts later on, contenders will focus more on win-now players.</p>

<p>That would eliminate tanking and make rebuilds way quicker by just clearing cap space and signing a bunch of rookies rather than waiting around for 7 years of draft picks to maybe hit.</p>

      <label for="lfj494p" class="commentText"><p>I highly doubt the vast majority of rookies would go anywhere other than wherever guaranteed them the most money. Most NBA careers are very short.</p>

<p>It also would make little sense for contenders to seriously pursue rookies. With a hard cap contenders will very rarely have much meaningful cap space and it wouldn’t be prudent to spend it on rookies that will very rarely be worth it the first year or two of their deals. You have to remember that if you abolish the draft rookie deals won’t be cheap anymore. A guy as hyped as Wemby would probably command 30 million+ right off the bat. Bad teams will be willing to overpay for promising young players in the hopes they break out, to the point where it likely won’t make much sense for contending teams to go after them. For any given rookie, as a contender you would almost always be able to get a vet for the same cap hit that actually fits your window.</p>

      <label for="lfji0dg" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re probably right that a good number of incoming rookies would.  But the best ones absolutely would go to the biggest cities.  Especially when the popular or rich teams can get creative with how players are compensated (ex. Reportedly nets with Kyrie, or even leagues like cfb).  At minimum there will be enough to shift competitive balance within the league.</p>

<p>But even that argument aside, Owners are always trying to keep costs controlled to reduce variability, so they&rsquo;ll prefer to keep draft picks and the rookie scale over letting salaries inflate through bidding.  And those rookies well be taking potential salary from veterans (the leaders of the Union btw), who will surely also be against that.</p>

<p>And what do we do with trades?  Without picks, there will be far less trades because straight player(s) for player(s) are so difficult to agree on valuation between teams.  There would be fewer trades which is less overall excitement for fans too.</p>

<p>It just feels like too many different groups lose more than they gain in the scenario to make that change.</p>

      <label for="lfjpoda" class="commentText"><p>The union is 100% the reason why it would never happen. Players unions in pretty much every major sport negotiate for rookie wage deals to be far below market value because the union represents current players, not future players, and all the current players benefit from the highest % possible of salary going to veterans because even current rookies will be vets when they sign their next deals.</p>

<p>Owners wouldn’t really care though, all they care about is the overall percent of basketball related income going to salaries, they don’t particularly care how that’s divided between vets and rookies. So every CBA negotiation vets and owners agree to screw over future players to benefit current players because the future players aren’t at the negotiating table, they’re still in school.</p>

<p>Trades would also go down a ton, but I’m not sure that’s the worst thing in the world tbh. Knowing stars likely won’t be traded lets fans be less reserved in really caring about their teams’ stars, buying their jerseys etc. It would also mean more players would hit free agency as opposed to getting traded then extended, which would make rebuilding a team way faster/easier. I think that’s much better than the current situation of a rebuild frequently taking the better part of a decade, I think franchises lose a lot of fans during those periods that don’t easily come back.</p>

      <label for="lfiche0" class="commentText"><p>Exactly this. The league thinks that parity is what is going to drive league profitability, and those metrics are measured on the scale of millions of viewers. The amount of money that the league makes from casual armchair-GMing is relatively small. And I&rsquo;m not knocking the armchair-GMing, I do it way too much, but I don&rsquo;t expect the league to factor us into their CBA.</p>

<p>Everything in the CBA has a purpose, sometimes it&rsquo;s not obvious why. Every now and then I get a &lsquo;huh, so that&rsquo;s why they included that,&rsquo; moment. Sometimes one provision is closing a loophole that another provision opens, even when the two don&rsquo;t seem linked.</p>

      <label for="lfi56dh" class="commentText"><p>There’s 2 aprons. Different versions of different exceptions based on these lines. Different rules for trading. And then yeah, ultimately is a sort of but not really hard cap. What’s the benefit of all this?</p>

<p>  I think you’re having a hard time because for some reason you think YOU have to understand what the CBA needs to do lol. It’s a labor agreement that represents player and owner interest. Not fans.</p>

      <label for="lfi5pgc" class="commentText"><p>You asked “what complexity” and I answered.</p>

<p>Why is “if teams want to spend, they can” good though? This does not improve the product as far as I can see.</p>

<p>I don’t need to understand every little detail of the cap, but I do think basic fan understanding of team building is good. Free agency and trades are big attention getters.</p>

      <label for="lfi6nvj" class="commentText"><p>You do t think having parity league wide doesn’t “improve the product”? Super teams are now almost impossible to built and maintain for multiple seasons. Teams are now expected to put more effort into their playing development since it’s easier and cheaper to retain their own talent.</p>

<p>It was a good move by the NBA, regardless if you like it or not.</p>

<p>When teachers unions negotiate a bargaining agreement with school districts, you think they’re trying to “improve the product”? No. That’s a fundamental misunderstanding of a labor agreement lol.</p>

<p>Edit: haha you replied and then blocked me 🤣 what a sensitive sally. The players don’t want a hard cap. They don’t care if your little brain can’t understand why. They want as much money as possible.</p>

      <label for="lfiehl0" class="commentText"><p>They are being bullish about it but ultimately they are right. The CBA is a &ldquo;bargaining agreement&rdquo; between the players and the owners. It&rsquo;s not inherently something that is to &ldquo;improve the product&rdquo;. Both sides <strong>can</strong> push for changes that improve the product but it will have to be bargained with to get there. There&rsquo;s no simple way to make that happen when both sides have separate wants. So of course you&rsquo;re going to end up with exceptions and &ldquo;convoluted&rdquo; mechanics as part of the system.</p>

<p>For example, the double apron mechanic is a way to implement a more stringent cap than ever previously done in the NBA. This is in lieu of a hard cap because the players would never want a hard cap since it means less money to them. Wealthy owners would also less likely want a hard cap because it means they wouldn&rsquo;t have the competitive advantage of just spending more to sign talent that smaller teams couldn&rsquo;t match.</p>

<p>Smaller teams would love a hard cap because it makes it easier for them to compete because now it&rsquo;s a cap savvy/talent retention exercise rather than a spending exercise. Also, owners would not have to shell out as much money to players since they couldn&rsquo;t go over a hard cap regardless of Bird Rights, etc.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s why you end up with all this &ldquo;complexity&rdquo; it&rsquo;s benefit is to appease both the players and the different ownership groups. It&rsquo;s absolutely necessary or you end up with a lockout which is the ultimate detriment to the product.</p>

      <label for="lfk3mi3" class="commentText"><p>I think he has it pretty simply explained though.  The 2nd apron is to create parity by making it very difficult to overspend by a lot and the 1st apron is there to give you some wiggle room if you happen to have put together a really good product.</p>

<p>The nba wants parity, but they also know that fans want to see really good teams.  Theoretically what they want is for teams to build towards contentionship and then once they get there, be able to spend more to make a really good product and “have a good run” with your assets.  The second apron is not really meant to be viable to sit in.</p>

<p>I think their vision is that teams will be below the aprons while rebuilding, then in the 1st apron while contending.  Then they either blow it up to rebuild and drop below the tax or spend big for one last run, understanding it’ll fuck them over for a season or two in exchange</p>

<p>My hot take theory about us is we traded for Dame in part because of the new CBA - we were going to be screwed no matter what due to the 2nd apron so why not push all the chips in? Especially last summer, when teams could still trade multiple players before all the 2nd apron handicaps were implemented.</p>

Ratings tend to dip when the less established(over hyped, older) players like Lebron Steph kd aren’t involved. The nba just needs to shift their marketing and that will fix itself…</p>

<p>If the national games stop being 50 lakers and/or warriors games while they suck instead of highlighting the better teams and the younger more exciting players spread across the west… Shai-Chet-Dub, Wemby, Luka-Kyrie, Jokic-Murray, Ant-Kat then the ratings would go up…if espn isn’t just showing lakers ganes then they will talk about other teams to hype “their product” which won’t just be the lakers and warriors for a change.</p>

      <label for="lfifjnk" class="commentText"><p>I disagree. NBA is not like the NFL. In the NFL draft, all teams are able to get instant impact starters. Barring trades, everyone gets a 1st round talent thanks to the number of positions on the field. There are also a lot more gems in later rounds, if only thanks to the volume of picks. You are not living or dying based on luck. A team like the Chiefs can get a new WR who will likely make an instant impact despite winning the chip. Only the generational talents are locked for the worst teams.</p>

<p>But in the NBA, the odds are significantly lower. Comparing to the Chiefs, do you think Baylor Scheierman, drafted by the Celtics, will have anywhere near the day one impact as Xavier Worthy? Only the top 5 picks are &ldquo;certain&rdquo;, if even that. There are rarely instant impact rookies, especially for contending teams. Lively is one of the rare examples, but he was drafted in the lottery thanks to the Mavs&rsquo; missing the playoffs. And 2nd round picks, most will be out of the league in a couple of years. Even if you get lucky in the late 1st round or 2nd, it will take years for them to get NBA ready. Especially if they don&rsquo;t get playing time, which contending teams will not give them.</p>

<p>Contending teams, even with all their picks, will almost never get a rookie who helps them day 1. They can&rsquo;t replace the talent who leaves for large contracts thanks to the CBA, which is reasonable. Unless a team aces every single draft over multiple years, which is next to impossible, teams will always go for the sure thing. Even veteran minamums are more playable than most rookies.</p>

      <label for="lfi82fi" class="commentText"><p>For all the complaints from the James Dolan&rsquo;s of the world, the truth is this is the CBA most teams wanted because they feel it gives them a real chance to retain their own stars long term. It was never about parity. It&rsquo;s about restricting player movement. They don&rsquo;t want superteams and the CBA (as well as previous lux tax increases) have all been done with the goal of preventing superteams from launching. I think it&rsquo;s made less of an impact than people think this offseason though&mdash;the bigger impact is the pure lack of space teams have&mdash;but it will make an impact going forward because teams are gonna have to be more targeted and more intentional with deals.</p>

<p>Teams will still make trades but most teams had already gotten their deals in prior to the offseason. The big thing is, what we&rsquo;ve seen over the last several years, and this is why I don&rsquo;t think the new CBA has necessarily been as earth shattering as some think, because these trends were already occurring&hellip;.stars are gonna lock into deals with their current teams and free agency isn&rsquo;t going to be the way to make acquisitions that dramatically change your team&rsquo;s future. If you want the best of the best talent it&rsquo;s gonna be through trades. That&rsquo;s already been the case though. That, and teams will be reluctant to use their full MLE so to not be hard capped.</p>

<p>Maybe Franz only deserves 20% instead of 25% if he doesn&rsquo;t keep improving, but that&rsquo;s a world of difference from giving a guy 35% who turns into a 15% player. </p>

<p>Both Barnes and Wagner have earned high level non-max deals already so you&rsquo;re only going a little above in your gamble on them continuing to improve, and you keep them happy and invested.</p>

<p>Derozan going to the Kings doesn&rsquo;t move the needle for me either way. They are better and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to impact Murray in a negative way. I also don&rsquo;t see them as title contenders.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, I actually do think the new CBA is good for players when you consider the other avenues they have to make money and the lifting of rules on marijuana. If I&rsquo;m a player though, I&rsquo;m calling BS on any owner that tries to use the 2nd apron against my ability to make money. Celtics just won a title being over the 2nd apron and are title favorites again being over the 2nd apron.</p>

<p>But, it’s easy to criticize any major move. You can do that for every team that made moves this summer. You can criticize the Clippers for letting Paul George walk, at the same time criticize the Sixers for signing Paul George.</p>

      <label for="lfjd7c8" class="commentText"><p>It needs to be looked at within the full context of our team and the league.</p>

<p>OG allows our two best players to do what they do, even better. OG addresses the single most important defensive position in the Eastern conference, being able to guard the Jays/Giannis/PG/Butler.</p>

<p>Health is a valid concern, and that’s no question. But our team is deep enough that we don’t entirely fall apart without our $40mm man being on the floor, and having <em>another</em> all-defense caliber wing alongside him. Also it doesn’t hurt that we’ve got the majority of our team signed at incredibly under-market value.</p>

<p>OG is a ceiling raiser; he moves us from “underdogs with a chance” to “Biggest threat to Boston other than a backpack”. Given what players are costing these days, I’m not sure there’s a more fitting player that could be paid this money that isn’t on a discount or rookie contract.</p>

      <label for="lfjca3i" class="commentText"><p>To be fair, the Clippers letting PG walk and the Sixers signing him are two different situations, and I kinda do criticize both</p>

<p>For the Clippers, they had very little room to maneuver, and had already re-signed Kawhi, so why balk at re-signing PG? They ended up replacing him with Kris Dunn, Nicholas Batum, and DJJ; decent additions, but not as good as having PG imo</p>

<p>And for the Sixers, they had a ton of room to maneuver. For the price of PG they could&rsquo;ve had DeMar, KCP, and a Malik Beasley/Kris Dunn/Haywood Highsmith kind of guy, and had them all on shorter deals. To me that sounds better than paying old PG that much money for that long</p>

      <label for="lfkwstq" class="commentText"><p>I never said it was only because of the cap. It&rsquo;s a multitude of reasons. A 17 game regular season and single elimination playoffs is a big reason. Large rosters where you lose key pieces every off season contributes as well.</p>

<p>A relegation/promotion system is best imo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have enough good teams for that though. And even the worst team in the league (Pistons going by last year) would destroy all the G-League teams. You&rsquo;d have to probably expand to 36 teams and split it into 2 leagues of 18 to get anywhere close to that level and it&rsquo;s never happening.</p>

<p>NFL has less parity.</p>

<p>It has far more when you realize what parity is. Parity is everyone playing on the same field. The packers have the same money to spend than the giants. Its on them to make good decisions instead of just overpaying cause the owner is willing to pay the tax.</p>
