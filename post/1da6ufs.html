      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1da6ufs/kyrie_irving_led_the_dallas_mavericks_in_assists/"><p>Kyrie Irving led the Dallas Mavericks in assists in Game 1 of the NBA Finals, with 2 assists.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Assists are the unsung heroes of basketball. Teamwork and chemistry essential for success and the Mavs did a terrible job. When players prioritize assists, it means they&rsquo;re seeing the court well and making smart decisions, which often translates to more scoring opportunities and higher shooting percentages. Plus sharing the ball has a strong effect on  team spirit so everyone feels involved and motivated. Assists aren&rsquo;t just about stats; they&rsquo;re a good indication of the cohesiveness of the team. Every other Mavs player had 1 or 0 assists. Pathetic for an NBA finals run.</p>

      <label for="l7jpwid" class="commentText"><p>It will be interesting to see what he comes up with, especially since he&rsquo;s kinda tasked with the Coach Spo style of the last 5 years- making lineups that force your obvious strengths into use and paper over your obvious shortcomings. I don&rsquo;t know to what extent that is possible versus these Celtics as long as Kristaps and Al looked as spry as they did last night.</p>

<p>Based on the Pacers&rsquo; games - and not just the ones where they had Hali + Turner PnR in their sets - I can say that a lot of the fight will just be moving fast and knowing what you want to do. <strong>You have to iso against these Celtics some.</strong> Especially with how easy it looked for our guys to navigate Lively and Gafford&rsquo;s screens as obvious rollmen. Nembhard and TJ obviously have some huge respect from Celtics&rsquo; fans for just how decisively they beat our guys to spots and didn&rsquo;t shy away from the hard stuff.</p>

The problem they might have is that, it’s not like any one adjustment will do much beyond causing them a different host of problems, bc THATS the exact point of our roster design and how we play as a team… we are a team designed to give the other team unstoppable and unsolvable problems, and they can only try their best to pick a worse poison.</p>

<p>It’s usually us who play ourselves out of games, lol.</p>

Maybe a cut to the basket or off ball screens to get loose. Still feels like everything has to go right for the Mavs: Kyrie makes tough shots, Luka cleans up his defense, role players hit 3s.</p>

<p>Luka loves to lob the ball and get defenders attention so he can draw more to himself and pass.</p>

<p>The issue is that the Celtics didnt double him much and made it impossibke to lob the ball.</p>

<p>Add to it a bunch of missed 3s and shit starts to make sense.</p>

      <label for="l7is0ke" class="commentText"><p>Regarding the lobs, the other issue is that Tatum guarded the centers.  So you have to bring him into the action, which of course is dumb because Tatum matches up well with Luka.  So they ended up screening with pj or jones and they aren’t going to duck in for a lob.  And that also means those guys are getting corner threes.</p>

<p>What was bad was going 2 for 5 on free throws.</p>

<p>That said dont bs by lumping Jordan and Kobe together.</p>

<p>First of the most defensively intense era was the early 2000s. Kobes claim to fame, his 2 championships without Shaq, are in the late 2000s when defenses werent as intense.</p>

<p>And the 90s has got to be the most overrated era of them all when it comes to defense. Somehow it gets lumped into the early 2000s, even though it was nowhere near as dificult to score as the early 2000s were.</p>

<p>Kobe beat the most 50 win teams in NBA history. He had to get through Duncan&rsquo;s Spurs, and stacked teams like the Rockets, Nuggets, Suns, Celtics, etc. He went to the finals 3 years in a row in an era when they were scoring 80-high 90 points per game&hellip;playing with broken fingers. Stop bullshitting dude.</p>

<p>90s era is not overrated, you actually had to foul to cause a foul, not like today where a centimeter of your skin touches someone&rsquo;s elbow and it&rsquo;s called a flagrant. In the 90s every player had to play defense, today there is none of that. Tell me how the scores in the 90s were ending in the 60s,70s, 80s instead of 120-130 like today if the defense was shit?</p>

      <label for="l7izme8" class="commentText"><p>Tatum can play that way because the Celtics aren’t forced to run all of their offense through him. He can actually play off of other good players instead of only being a threat on ball, so when teams put a ton of focus on him it opens things up for other guys to attack instead.</p>

<p>Luka could literally be playing with Brunson and KP on complete steals of contracts that would probably let them add even more, similar to Boston, if he could play like Tatum does, but he can’t. The only star he’s been able to work next to is Kyrie and they don’t even play off of each other, they just take turns. Aside from that they’ve had to fill out there roster with complementary role players who can’t create anything, because no one else fits. Luka needs to grow as a player or else he’s always going to need to do it all on his own.</p>

      <label for="l7j5k9c" class="commentText"><p>Except KP and Brunson worked well with Luka, KP was constantly injured which only the Celtics can afford, Brunson was a fumble but it&rsquo;s not like he was gonna average 25, he literally plays Luka ball in NY except actually holds the ball more and isn&rsquo;t nearly as efficient or productive</p>

<p>Luka and Kyrie core is way better than Luka, Brunson and KP unless you assume KP is healthy which he never was</p>

      <label for="l7j7p00" class="commentText"><p>Lmao both guys absolutely blew up as soon as they left Dallas. Luka worked well with them because he still got his, they didn’t work well with Luka because they didn’t get there’s. KP was relegated to catch and shoots and Brunson never got the opportunities he needed to take the next step.</p>

<p>You’re right though, the Luka/Kyrie core is better than those 3 would be. That’s not a good thing though, Brunson is flat out a better player than Kyrie at this point and you’d be adding KP on top of that. The only reason the Luka/Kyrie core is better is because the other two guys have more problems playing in a heliocentric offense around someone else, Kyrie’s fine just taking his turns when Luka needs a break.</p>

<p>Brunson isn&rsquo;t better than Kyrie, he&rsquo;s had higher usage than Luka for half a year and his stats are barely better than Kyries on worse efficiency</p>

<p>I don’t expect them to play like that every series and they had a great come back run that was stifled by their own idiotic travels and poor rebounding. Get these guys to settle down and make the necessary adjustments and it’ll be a great series.</p>

<p>Or the C’s will sweep 4-0 and we’ll have to live with the misery that is a thousand Celtics fans on here never shutting up about this (very deserved, the C’s have been top dogs all year) championship.</p>

<p>I think they need to play faster so DJJ and the others can get easier looks so they can get something going. But ultimately Kyrie must have at least 25 the rest of the games</p>

<p>If they just calm the fuck down, clean up the mistakes and stop trying to play hero ball the Mavs will make this competitive.</p>

<p>I still have them as favorites like I did before game 1, but the chances of Cs starting this hot and Dallas scoring 89 points in games to come is extremely low</p>

<p>And sad to say, but if Cs do go up 2-0, you know the refs will be doing what&rsquo;s in their power to tie the series up in Dallas. Not to say that couldn&rsquo;t be their agenda in game 2</p>

<p>Are the Mavs role players going to adjust and/or shoot better?</p>

<p>I think it’s fair to assume that both teams will regress to the mean a little bit. I still firmly believe that the Mavs don’t matchup well against the C’s, I’m interested in seeing how Kidd adjusts.</p>

      <label for="l7j1amd" class="commentText"><p>It was a lob attempt. Luka looks at Gaff as soon as the help slides over. But the contest affected the angle and the pass/timing was off and looked awkward. Either way, the Mavs couldn’t generate much of anything that night, so this result seems fitting.</p>
