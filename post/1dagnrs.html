</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Tatum guarding Gafford and Lively prevents Luka from exploiting the PNR Lob.  No one on the Wolves was able to stop this. Tatum is.</p>

<p>Tatum can also shut down perimeter defenders with his lateral movement.</p>

<p>Tatum&rsquo;s defensive versatility is what sets him apart from players like Jokic, Luka, Embiid, Giannis, SGA, Brunson.</p>

<p>Everyone spent the last 2 months pushing Tatum down so I would like to highlight how his PNR defense is extremely rare and elite and a large component to winning in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="l7ki5mw" class="commentText"><p>Obviously it&rsquo;s still early in the series and a lot can change in the next few games, but thus far it&rsquo;s looked like Boston&rsquo;s roster now is kind of what okc is aiming to be in a year or two. Massive, athletic, excellent defense at every position, and all anchored by amazing two way wings and a giant stretchy center. I dunno if chet will ever shoot like tingus can but if he speeds up his release just a bit I feel like OKC will really be fielding a pretty similar team to Boston, with Shai possibly being an even better #1 option than anything the Celtics have</p>

      <label for="l7kuch8" class="commentText"><p>I haven&rsquo;t checked the stats or anything but I thought Chet&rsquo;s biggest strength offensively is actually his shooting and that&rsquo;s why OKC can play a deadly 5 out offense? It&rsquo;s just that he sometimes can get outmuscled on the boards (he had 5 rebounds total or something the last 2 games against Dallas)</p>

      <label for="l7kw1w7" class="commentText"><p>In reality chet is not the shooter porzingis is. The biggest thing is how slow his release is compared to porzingis having such a fast one, but even beyond that porzingis is willing to shoot from further away, and is more accurate. So regular season its deadly but not the same in the playoffs with better defenders closing out</p>

He’s a help defense god and can also, obviously, guard centers. The top 3 two players of the superstars are probably Giannis, Embiid (center impact), then Tatum in that order, at least for me.</p>

      <label for="l7k5nwg" class="commentText"><p>I will agree his versatility is what makes him great. He is arguably the most well rounded player in the league, he is good at about everything. Though acting like a guy like Giannis isnt a versatile defensive piece is underselling him.</p>

<p>Obviously some players are much greater at other facets of the game and that can make them a better player than Tatum. But I do believe his ability to literally do everything in the NBA at a high level is undersold at times.</p>

<p>Having a shooting big in KP or Horford and a solid handler and driver in Jaylen Brown means Tatum can be a solid very good basketball player in many ways. And depending on how the team is doing he can fill different roles.</p>

<p>KP shot well in Game 1, so Tatum rebounded and passed more and only scored 15 or whatever. But that&rsquo;s impactful AF and there&rsquo;s not a lot of players who can just fundamentally change how they contribute to a game. </p>

      <label for="l7klvfb" class="commentText"><p>It also means you can be flexible with him. I&rsquo;ve always felt Tatum as a perimeter shooting threat isn&rsquo;t playing to his own strengths. He&rsquo;s genuinely a very solid playmaker and if you watch him play his court vision passing skills and his own ability to use his gravity makes it hard to imagine that he&rsquo;s just a five assist per game kind of player. His playmaking feel looks more like a seven assist per game kind of player.</p>

<p>Whatever you need him to do he will do it and he will do it effectively. He fits into any team, he fits into any game plan and he fits into any scheme and roster because of his versatility.</p>

<p>His primary role last night was facilitator. Sure, he didn&rsquo;t score very efficiently and sure, his assist numbers weren&rsquo;t significant. But there is a very clear game plan for him, and he did an exceptional job at giving the game what it needed. Would we have liked to see him score a bit more efficiently? Sure. But there is a very clear game plan for Tatum in game 1 and he executed it super super effectively.</p>

      <label for="l7koj51" class="commentText"><p>Agreed 100%.</p>

<p>Basketball is a team sport with a very small team and a very small &ldquo;field&rdquo;; unlike say, soccer, a basketball star can take over a game in a truly immense way. But a weakness can be exploited similarly. So an all around player like Tatum can provide huge value by just not-being-exploitable.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a funny thought experiment to think about building an optimal team out of &ldquo;all-around&rdquo; or &ldquo;min-max specialist&rdquo; guys, to see how the star power vs small field vs weakness exploitation translates to success.</p>

<p>Like Gobert is clearly a min-maxed defensive rim protecting center. Jokic is clearly a min-maxed offensive center and game controller.</p>

<p>AD is a more all-around player, with defensive skills as a rim protector that aren&rsquo;t up to Gobert&rsquo;s ability but are still good (and better than Jokic&rsquo;s), and with much better offensive output than Gobert (but not as much as Jokic&rsquo;s). So AD is a really good all-around player, even if he&rsquo;s not &ldquo;better&rdquo; than Jokic or Gobert in some ways.</p>

<p>KD is &ldquo;the most unstoppable scorer of all time&rdquo;. Is there a better all-around SF type who can do a little bit of everything whose defense accounts for scoring less than KD? (Obviously LeBron comes to mind but that&rsquo;s sort of cheating).</p>

<p>Could you make a team of all Tatum, AD, etc type &ldquo;all-around&rdquo; guys who are top 20 in their own right but not top 5, and would they do better than a team of Gobert&rsquo;s defense, KD&rsquo;s unstoppable offense, etc. type of guys who are all top 10 individuals but have weaknesses?</p>

      <label for="l7kte67" class="commentText"><p>I appreciate this thought experiment. It&rsquo;s about balance and minimizing exploitable weaknesses.</p>

<p>Regarding Tatum, it&rsquo;s funny..I had the thought about him not being exploitable before reading your response. That is what makes him such a great impact player.</p>

<p>The one thing I&rsquo;ll challenge is that there IS one thing that can sort of be exploited with him. He&rsquo;s an average to slightly below average volume pull up shooter, and if he gets frustrated with himself, you can force himself to continue to take those shots. The issue with that is that he IS capable of having a good 1-2 elite pull up jump shooting games per series, so it can be risky. AND he&rsquo;s smart and disciplined enough now to not force it, and is receptive enough to being coached to the point of avoiding those pull up tight 1v1 defenses.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny. Tatum doesn&rsquo;t impact the game like other MVPs. But when you look at the big picture&hellip; Team building, skills, weakness, roster, health&hellip;.</p>

<p>Take a well constructed roster, a legitimate near championship quality roster, a championship quality roster&hellip;</p>

<p>How many guys do you take over Tatum right now and moving forward to be the #1 guy on that team and turn them into a contender? Legitimately?</p>

<p>Jokic? Duh. Lol. Giannis? Yup. Doncic? Yup. Curry? At his age? Embiid? His health and ineffective post season play? SGA? Maybe?</p>

<p>Who else?</p>

<p>No one. Tatum may not be top 1-2 at anything but his versatility and portability ABSOLUTELY makes him a top 4 or 5 player in the NBA despite being a CLEAR step below Doncic, Giannis who are steps below Jokic.</p>

<p>You can say Embiid is a better individual talent, and SGA is comparible, but versatility at an all star level on both ends of the ball with peaks as high as all time great scoring nights make you a top 5 player.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s unfair to omit Tatum from top 5 lists at this point. He&rsquo;s a top 5 player. He&rsquo;s absolutely worse than those other top 5 guys. Both can be true.</p>

He isn&rsquo;t the best in the league in one thing where you go &ldquo;wow no one else can do that&rdquo; and it amazes you. Instead, he just does everything really well and it wins games, but it doesn&rsquo;t fit the same way into a highlight reel, so people don&rsquo;t accurately judge him. I mean this thread alone is a good example of him doing something well that most people won&rsquo;t notice. Yet it is such an important aspect of getting wins, but it doesn&rsquo;t show up like highlight dunks or crazy stat lines.</p>

<p>First off he could barely guard anyone cause he was having to carry the offense with a fucked back, he couldn’t do both.</p>

<p>Second, he listens to what the coaches tell him and holiday told everyone he wanted to guard him.</p>

<p>Third, he guarded Jimmy in 2021 and shut him down and shut him down this season when guarding him.</p>

<p>Now he actually has a coach that lets him guard the other teams best player.</p>

      <label for="l7k7k22" class="commentText"><p>Dallas has no fast guards also. Kyrie is really slow, just extremely crafty. Luka is stuck in the mud out there as well, also just crafty. Jrue and Tatum are absolutely elite vs those types of players ( Kornet/Horford are also an elite defenders vs those types for centers).</p>

<p>White is our dedicated speed stopper, which actually makes his somewhat of a liability defensively for this matchup. But he&rsquo;s still elite on offence so it works fine.</p>

<p>The point is that OP is saying that the Tatum is breaking the Mavs offense. And I’am suggesting the Mavs might not have anything to break.  They have one dimensional screen and role centers. And most playoff level defenders can take advantage of that. It’s certainly like the 11th most impressive thing that Tatum can do.</p>

<p>The Mavs centers can’t score from the post, they can’t bully you for offensive rebounds, they can’t throw passes in a 4 out motion set. They are tools for Luka to play with. And when you play a team like the Celtics who can put 5 good defenders on the floor you are asking to get strangled.</p>

But they also looked like shit in the game 1&rsquo;s vs LAC and OKC and then made adjustments and won the series. I&rsquo;m not suggesting the Mavs are going to turn around and dominate BOS, certainly BOS shut down literally everyone but Luka last night. But they play a series for a reason. Last night was a blow out but despite how piss poor Dallas played they made a solid push and came back within striking distance in the 3rd.</p>

<p>I can guarantee 1 adjustment they will make that I&rsquo;m absolutely shocked Kidd didn&rsquo;t make in game, the Mavs absolutely can not switch on Porzingis. Time and again I saw Lively and Gafford switching on a KP screen and then the Mavs paid for it.</p>

<p>… BUT if you leave the bigs on KP he’ll stretch them out to the perimeter and take away any rim protection the Mavs have.</p>

<p>I honestly think you live with the midrange shots and just try to be disruptive physically… maybe send a double from his blindside? But if Gafford/Lively aren’t in the paint to back up Luka as he gets blown past on every possession, the Jays are going to feast.</p>

<p>Disagree about the Giannis point. Embiid provides the best rim protection of any consensus top 10 player and one of the best of any star, but I’m not sure I’d trust him to defend even mediocre point guards in a playoffs setting.</p>

He may not be good enough for Embiid and Jokic, but in this playoff run for example the Celtics have been able to put him on Bam, Mobley, and Myles Turner for large stretches and still win a lot of basketball games. Then obviously on the flip side you have to have your center cover someone else because Tatum can cook literally every single center in the league on offense</p>

      <label for="l7kbj06" class="commentText"><p>I think it depends. Like he can&rsquo;t guard Embiid 1 on 1 when Embiid has the ball all that great (I&rsquo;d say he can do better than most but that&rsquo;s not good enough), but he can cover him off ball. Jokic could definitely back him down when posting up, but Tatum could smother him enough to limit his passing options. He&rsquo;s not an &ldquo;answer&rdquo; against big centers in general, but he can limit them as a secondary option, something he can do against almost anyone. As a primary on ball defender, he&rsquo;s usually not your first choice unless the opponent&rsquo;s top ball handler is another big wing like Lebron or KD, but off ball he&rsquo;s gonna lock down basically anyone, and usually be able to help everyone else with their guy too. He&rsquo;s just a really useful people whose contributions are easy to miss because he&rsquo;s rarely the one making the play, he&rsquo;s just forcing you to avoid where he is, and he takes up a big area.</p>

It&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;s not good. The Celtics are just too deep and simply don&rsquo;t even need him to win.</p>

<p><a href="https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4268/onoff#tab-team_efficiency" target="_blank">Tatum&rsquo;s efficiency differential</a> when he was on the floor during this regular season was -2. Obviously the first time of his career it&rsquo;s negative.</p>

<p>They literally don&rsquo;t need Jayson Tatum. He is not a critical piece of the 2024 Boston Celtics and this is why they will finally win it all this year after years of being contenders.</p>

Jrue Holiday is probably the best perimeter defender in the league, Porzingis is a mobile big who can block shots, Jaylen Brown is an elite perimeter defender, Derrick White is up there as well. The Celtics do not have a single bad defender in their playoff rotation.</p>

<p>Like is it apart of it? Yes. Is it “what breaks the Mavs offense” No.</p>

<p>You can point out defensive abilities unique to most of those players. Like Shai isn’t going to switch on to a center like Tatum, but he absolutely is able to come from the weak side and thwart them - which is why he has the most blocks ever by a PG in a playoff series.</p>

<p>Lmfaoo the recency bias is insane. This post would not do nearly as well in the middle of the season if this post wasn’t full of Celtics flairs</p>

<p>Bro really said Tatums defense is what sets him apart from Giannis💀</p>

      <label for="l7kmqg0" class="commentText"><p>SGA has become a severely underrated defender in these tatum discussions. Before you talk about versatility, Tatum can’t guard ones and he can’t guard true centers. Tatums versatility in which positions he can actually guard is expected for his size.</p>

<p>He can’t guard quick little guards, and he can’t guard a true center 7 feet or over.</p>

<p>He can’t guard 1-5. He can guard 2 through like 4.5. Which for a 6’9 athletic guy should be the bare minimum</p>

      <label for="l7krfg0" class="commentText"><p>First of all, literally nobody in the league can actually guard 1-5. Bam might be the closest but he still gets pushed around by those same centers you are pointing to and torched by small fast guards. If Giannis can&rsquo;t guard the Jokics and Embiids of the NBA either then I don&rsquo;t know why you would expect Tatum to be able to. There are only a handful of those guys just having the size isn&rsquo;t enough they need the bag to take advantage too (see: Gobert in the WCF).</p>

<p>SGA is 6&rsquo;6&rdquo; and doesn&rsquo;t crack 200 lbs so he can&rsquo;t even guard most 4&rsquo;s and a lot of those guys DO have the bag to take advantage. Saying SGA is &ldquo;severely underrated&rdquo;  defensively is wild when a lot of people were trying to shoehorn him into the DPOY conversation earlier this year when he&rsquo;s not even the second best defender on his own team.</p>

<p>He gets pushed around by Embiid and Jokic and that’s it. Just like everyone else in the NBA. Bam has routinely made KP his bitch with plenty of evidence of when he was at the Mavericks. On top of that, bam doesn’t get cooked by fast guards either. Just look up Bam defense on curry and Bam defense on Kyrie and you’ll see how he’s guarded the best offensively gifted small guards in the league throughout the course of a game and clamped them.</p>

<p>I’m not saying Tatum can’t guard Jokic and Embiid, I’m saying Tatum can’t guard anyone 7ft and over. There are plenty of centers 7ft and over aside from Jokic and Embiid.</p>

<p>And SGA’s defense has become underrated this post season because of Celtics fans trying to prop up Tatum by shitting on SGA</p>

      <label for="l7kvrz3" class="commentText"><p>KP doesn&rsquo;t like being crowded, Smart stifled him with that strategy for years its nothing new. Neither Kyrie not Curry are that fast so its little wonder you picked them as examples, guys like Ant, SGA and Trae make a mockery of Bam&rsquo;s defense. That isn&rsquo;t shitting on Bam its just not reasonable to expect him to be able to guard those guys, if the Heat weren&rsquo;t mid the last few regular seasons he probably has a DPOY by now</p>

<p>Again there are not many 7 footers with a bag. Expecting Tatum to handle the few out there is just as unreasonable as expecting Bam to handle SGA. Its not happening</p>

<p>SGA is not as good of a defender as Tatum, sorry. Hes good but hes just not in that same tier of defender.  Why would you expect anything less from Celtics fans? Tatum been getting shit all season and now the receipts are coming due, most of yall were saying the Mavs would eat us and that Tatum is barely a top-10 player just an few days ago. The fans are gonna prop up their guys thats what fans do</p>

<p>Yeah the convo ends here lmao that’s a brain dead ass take. Especially considering the games I’m talking about where he clamped curry and Kyrie were 3 or 4 years ago, where they are not as aged as they are now.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>LMFAOOO now I know you’re not watching shit. Bam has had no issues with ant and has clamped Trae plenty of times before. Bam has probably played SGA no more than 3 times and each time dude was just making anything he threw up in the midrange. Nobody could guard him those games</p>

      <label for="l7kk4f7" class="commentText"><p>Not just guard, but he came out hunting rebounds. The Mavs need their big men to be competitive on the boards if the Celtics aren’t even going to put a center on them. Despite this, Tatum on his own had more rebounds than Lively, Gafford, and Kleber combined. And that’s by having 11, not like 20. That’s an area they’ll have to be better if they want to punish putting Porzingis and Horford elsewhere in position to help clog the paint on lobs/PnRs.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t even call that a particularly good game from Tatum due to some scoring inefficiency (though part of that inefficiency was some late shot clock chucks) and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> turnovers being pretty awful, but his Swiss Army knife skillset was huge in mucking up Dallas’ normal offensive plans, and also opening things up on Boston’s offense. He wasn’t on a scoring tear, but Dallas was really worried about him getting mismatches out of actions with White and Porzingis, creating opportunities elsewhere. Overall he wasn’t our best performance but shows why he’s actually the most important/best player on Boston. He can do a little of most anything asked of him. His 3 ball looked better. Don’t be surprised if he scores at least closer to the Indiana series the rest of the way. They’ll probably need at least once explosion to win.</p>

      <label for="l7klmzx" class="commentText"><p>I feel like he gets all the shit because his shooting % is low and isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;prime time&rdquo; or whatever the fuck SAS means by that. People love offense, defense is always less highlighted. I&rsquo;m talking the yeoman&rsquo;s defense like PnR, boxing out, switching&hellip;chase down blocks get all the glory certainly, but goodness Tatum is so important to this team on defense.</p>

      <label for="l7km0at" class="commentText"><p>Also, as dumb as it&rsquo;s going to sound via text, pre-emptively giving Luka bad matchups to exploit (on SOME possessions) is working out pretty well?</p>

<p>Putting Horford or Kornet on Luka means there&rsquo;s no reason for him to call a PnR and get the switch. What, would he rather get Jrue or Tatum switched onto him? So he iso&rsquo;s on a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; Celtics defender, everyone else stays at home, and suddenly one of Luka&rsquo;s best assets - his playmaking - is basically off the table.</p>

<p>So pre-switching Tatum onto Lively/Gafford and Horford/Kornet onto Luka prevents them from even <em>wanting</em> to runt he PnR and get the switch, and even if they do then there&rsquo;s a big defending a big to eliminate the lob threat. Their best bet (on paper) is for Luka to repeatedly iso his defender and drop 30+ - but then everyone else is ice cold when they&rsquo;re needed most (including Kyrie, who&rsquo;s exiled to Derrick White Island or whatever that whole time).</p>

<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s probably only possible because the Celtics &ldquo;bad&rdquo; defenders are still above average. Still, it&rsquo;s fascinating to see these sorts of adjustments in the very first game.</p>

      <label for="l7kulsz" class="commentText"><p>Very few noted in the 2 weeks leading to G1 that Celtics will use JT on Lively like they used him on Turner, for pnr defense and lobs antidote. Folks who haven&rsquo;t been watching Celtics bball all season (feels like 95% of the media / SM / this sub).</p>

<p>When it was brought up, it was usually  brushed off quickly.</p>

<p>JT is so underrated.</p>

<p>Mazooka been just flings him around every game / series to new different type of roles and assignments.</p>

<p>Yo JT , today you are covering Lively to take away that pnr lob and rebounds. Lol</p>

<p>Like what other star is assigned to do the dirtiest work at elite level.</p>
