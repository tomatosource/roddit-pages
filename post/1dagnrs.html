</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Tatum guarding Gafford and Lively prevents Luka from exploiting the PNR Lob.  No one on the Wolves was able to stop this. Tatum is.</p>

<p>Tatum can also shut down perimeter defenders with his lateral movement.</p>

<p>Tatum&rsquo;s defensive versatility is what sets him apart from players like Jokic, Luka, Embiid, Giannis, SGA, Brunson.</p>

<p>Everyone spent the last 2 months pushing Tatum down so I would like to highlight how his PNR defense is extremely rare and elite and a large component to winning in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="l7ki5mw" class="commentText"><p>Obviously it&rsquo;s still early in the series and a lot can change in the next few games, but thus far it&rsquo;s looked like Boston&rsquo;s roster now is kind of what okc is aiming to be in a year or two. Massive, athletic, excellent defense at every position, and all anchored by amazing two way wings and a giant stretchy center. I dunno if chet will ever shoot like tingus can but if he speeds up his release just a bit I feel like OKC will really be fielding a pretty similar team to Boston, with Shai possibly being an even better #1 option than anything the Celtics have</p>

      <label for="l7kuch8" class="commentText"><p>I haven&rsquo;t checked the stats or anything but I thought Chet&rsquo;s biggest strength offensively is actually his shooting and that&rsquo;s why OKC can play a deadly 5 out offense? It&rsquo;s just that he sometimes can get outmuscled on the boards (he had 5 rebounds total or something the last 2 games against Dallas)</p>

      <label for="l7kw1w7" class="commentText"><p>In reality chet is not the shooter porzingis is. The biggest thing is how slow his release is compared to porzingis having such a fast one, but even beyond that porzingis is willing to shoot from further away, and is more accurate. So regular season its deadly but not the same in the playoffs with better defenders closing out</p>

      <label for="l7l4jjl" class="commentText"><p>At one point PP took a corner 3 that was clearly a bit off with three mavs directly under the basket. Easy rebound right? Nope, they all watched it hit the ground which gave PP a chance to grab it off the bounce as he crashed the board on his own shot. It felt very emblematic of the rebounding effort</p>

      <label for="l7l6fto" class="commentText"><p>Tatum is a great defender who can do more than one defensive role. But Giannis is arguably the most versatile defender in the league. He’s right up there with Anthony Davis. It isn’t an insult to Tatum to say he isn’t on the same level as the absolute most versatile defensive players in the league.</p>

<p>There are very few dudes in the league that can do the full defensive responsibilities of a drop coverage center, along with also being a weakside help wing, strong side pick and roll switch/drop man, and chase guards around perimeter as needed.</p>

<p>This is also why I don’t understand how Gobert keeps getting DPOYs when the modern NBA clearly values being elite AND versatile on defense and Rudy is really only elite at one defensive role while bordering on inept at all other roles.</p>

He’s a help defense god and can also, obviously, guard centers. The top 3 two players of the superstars are probably Giannis, Embiid (center impact), then Tatum in that order, at least for me.</p>

<p>Obviously some players are much greater at other facets of the game and that can make them a better player than Tatum. But I do believe his ability to literally do everything in the NBA at a high level is undersold at times.</p>

<p>Having a shooting big in KP or Horford and a solid handler and driver in Jaylen Brown means Tatum can be a solid very good basketball player in many ways. And depending on how the team is doing he can fill different roles.</p>

<p>KP shot well in Game 1, so Tatum rebounded and passed more and only scored 15 or whatever. But that&rsquo;s impactful AF and there&rsquo;s not a lot of players who can just fundamentally change how they contribute to a game. </p>

      <label for="l7klvfb" class="commentText"><p>It also means you can be flexible with him. I&rsquo;ve always felt Tatum as a perimeter shooting threat isn&rsquo;t playing to his own strengths. He&rsquo;s genuinely a very solid playmaker and if you watch him play his court vision passing skills and his own ability to use his gravity makes it hard to imagine that he&rsquo;s just a five assist per game kind of player. His playmaking feel looks more like a seven assist per game kind of player.</p>

<p>Whatever you need him to do he will do it and he will do it effectively. He fits into any team, he fits into any game plan and he fits into any scheme and roster because of his versatility.</p>

<p>His primary role last night was facilitator. Sure, he didn&rsquo;t score very efficiently and sure, his assist numbers weren&rsquo;t significant. But there is a very clear game plan for him, and he did an exceptional job at giving the game what it needed. Would we have liked to see him score a bit more efficiently? Sure. But there is a very clear game plan for Tatum in game 1 and he executed it super super effectively.</p>

      <label for="l7koj51" class="commentText"><p>Agreed 100%.</p>

<p>Basketball is a team sport with a very small team and a very small &ldquo;field&rdquo;; unlike say, soccer, a basketball star can take over a game in a truly immense way. But a weakness can be exploited similarly. So an all around player like Tatum can provide huge value by just not-being-exploitable.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a funny thought experiment to think about building an optimal team out of &ldquo;all-around&rdquo; or &ldquo;min-max specialist&rdquo; guys, to see how the star power vs small field vs weakness exploitation translates to success.</p>

<p>Like Gobert is clearly a min-maxed defensive rim protecting center. Jokic is clearly a min-maxed offensive center and game controller.</p>

<p>AD is a more all-around player, with defensive skills as a rim protector that aren&rsquo;t up to Gobert&rsquo;s ability but are still good (and better than Jokic&rsquo;s), and with much better offensive output than Gobert (but not as much as Jokic&rsquo;s). So AD is a really good all-around player, even if he&rsquo;s not &ldquo;better&rdquo; than Jokic or Gobert in some ways.</p>

<p>KD is &ldquo;the most unstoppable scorer of all time&rdquo;. Is there a better all-around SF type who can do a little bit of everything whose defense accounts for scoring less than KD? (Obviously LeBron comes to mind but that&rsquo;s sort of cheating).</p>

<p>Could you make a team of all Tatum, AD, etc type &ldquo;all-around&rdquo; guys who are top 20 in their own right but not top 5, and would they do better than a team of Gobert&rsquo;s defense, KD&rsquo;s unstoppable offense, etc. type of guys who are all top 10 individuals but have weaknesses?</p>

      <label for="l7kte67" class="commentText"><p>I appreciate this thought experiment. It&rsquo;s about balance and minimizing exploitable weaknesses.</p>

<p>Regarding Tatum, it&rsquo;s funny..I had the thought about him not being exploitable before reading your response. That is what makes him such a great impact player.</p>

<p>The one thing I&rsquo;ll challenge is that there IS one thing that can sort of be exploited with him. He&rsquo;s an average to slightly below average volume pull up shooter, and if he gets frustrated with himself, you can force himself to continue to take those shots. The issue with that is that he IS capable of having a good 1-2 elite pull up jump shooting games per series, so it can be risky. AND he&rsquo;s smart and disciplined enough now to not force it, and is receptive enough to being coached to the point of avoiding those pull up tight 1v1 defenses.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny. Tatum doesn&rsquo;t impact the game like other MVPs. But when you look at the big picture&hellip; Team building, skills, weakness, roster, health&hellip;.</p>

<p>Take a well constructed roster, a legitimate near championship quality roster, a championship quality roster&hellip;</p>

<p>How many guys do you take over Tatum right now and moving forward to be the #1 guy on that team and turn them into a contender? Legitimately?</p>

<p>Jokic? Duh. Lol. Giannis? Yup. Doncic? Yup. Curry? At his age? Embiid? His health and ineffective post season play? SGA? Maybe?</p>

<p>Who else?</p>

<p>No one. Tatum may not be top 1-2 at anything but his versatility and portability ABSOLUTELY makes him a top 4 or 5 player in the NBA despite being a CLEAR step below Doncic, Giannis who are steps below Jokic.</p>

<p>You can say Embiid is a better individual talent, and SGA is comparible, but versatility at an all star level on both ends of the ball with peaks as high as all time great scoring nights make you a top 5 player.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s unfair to omit Tatum from top 5 lists at this point. He&rsquo;s a top 5 player. He&rsquo;s absolutely worse than those other top 5 guys. Both can be true.</p>

He isn&rsquo;t the best in the league in one thing where you go &ldquo;wow no one else can do that&rdquo; and it amazes you. Instead, he just does everything really well and it wins games, but it doesn&rsquo;t fit the same way into a highlight reel, so people don&rsquo;t accurately judge him. I mean this thread alone is a good example of him doing something well that most people won&rsquo;t notice. Yet it is such an important aspect of getting wins, but it doesn&rsquo;t show up like highlight dunks or crazy stat lines.</p>

<p>The point is that OP is saying that the Tatum is breaking the Mavs offense. And I’am suggesting the Mavs might not have anything to break.  They have one dimensional screen and role centers. And most playoff level defenders can take advantage of that. It’s certainly like the 11th most impressive thing that Tatum can do.</p>

<p>The Mavs centers can’t score from the post, they can’t bully you for offensive rebounds, they can’t throw passes in a 4 out motion set. They are tools for Luka to play with. And when you play a team like the Celtics who can put 5 good defenders on the floor you are asking to get strangled.</p>

But they also looked like shit in the game 1&rsquo;s vs LAC and OKC and then made adjustments and won the series. I&rsquo;m not suggesting the Mavs are going to turn around and dominate BOS, certainly BOS shut down literally everyone but Luka last night. But they play a series for a reason. Last night was a blow out but despite how piss poor Dallas played they made a solid push and came back within striking distance in the 3rd.</p>

<p>I can guarantee 1 adjustment they will make that I&rsquo;m absolutely shocked Kidd didn&rsquo;t make in game, the Mavs absolutely can not switch on Porzingis. Time and again I saw Lively and Gafford switching on a KP screen and then the Mavs paid for it.</p>

<p>… BUT if you leave the bigs on KP he’ll stretch them out to the perimeter and take away any rim protection the Mavs have.</p>

<p>I honestly think you live with the midrange shots and just try to be disruptive physically… maybe send a double from his blindside? But if Gafford/Lively aren’t in the paint to back up Luka as he gets blown past on every possession, the Jays are going to feast.</p>

It&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;s not good. The Celtics are just too deep and simply don&rsquo;t even need him to win.</p>

<p><a href="https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4268/onoff#tab-team_efficiency" target="_blank">Tatum&rsquo;s efficiency differential</a> when he was on the floor during this regular season was -2. Obviously the first time of his career it&rsquo;s negative.</p>

<p>They literally don&rsquo;t need Jayson Tatum. He is not a critical piece of the 2024 Boston Celtics and this is why they will finally win it all this year after years of being contenders.</p>

He may not be good enough for Embiid and Jokic, but in this playoff run for example the Celtics have been able to put him on Bam, Mobley, and Myles Turner for large stretches and still win a lot of basketball games. Then obviously on the flip side you have to have your center cover someone else because Tatum can cook literally every single center in the league on offense</p>

      <label for="l7k8syz" class="commentText"><p>Op was explicitly referring to “defensive versatility”, not to how good of a defender someone is. Those are two related but different things.</p>

<p>Disagree about the Giannis point. Embiid provides the best rim protection of any consensus top 10 player and one of the best of any star, but I’m not sure I’d trust him to defend even mediocre point guards in a playoffs setting.</p>

Jrue Holiday is probably the best perimeter defender in the league, Porzingis is a mobile big who can block shots, Jaylen Brown is an elite perimeter defender, Derrick White is up there as well. The Celtics do not have a single bad defender in their playoff rotation.</p>

<p>Also sure Tatum&rsquo;s versatility is different than Embiid&rsquo;s rim protection, but it&rsquo;s pretty clear that Embiid&rsquo;s rim protection - like that of many great rim protects like Gobert, Wemby, etc. - is much more valuable over the course of the game as a whole. Rim protection is the most valuable part of defense, so kinda weird to throw him in there. Even though I&rsquo;m on the side of Jokic not being a good defender, also weird to have him in this. Very apples vs oranges</p>

<p>Like is it apart of it? Yes. Is it “what breaks the Mavs offense” No.</p>

<p>You can point out defensive abilities unique to most of those players. Like Shai isn’t going to switch on to a center like Tatum, but he absolutely is able to come from the weak side and thwart them - which is why he has the most blocks ever by a PG in a playoff series.</p>

      <label for="l7kk4f7" class="commentText"><p>Not just guard, but he came out hunting rebounds. The Mavs need their big men to be competitive on the boards if the Celtics aren’t even going to put a center on them. Despite this, Tatum on his own had more rebounds than Lively, Gafford, and Kleber combined. And that’s by having 11, not like 20. That’s an area they’ll have to be better if they want to punish putting Porzingis and Horford elsewhere in position to help clog the paint on lobs/PnRs.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t even call that a particularly good game from Tatum due to some scoring inefficiency (though part of that inefficiency was some late shot clock chucks) and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> turnovers being pretty awful, but his Swiss Army knife skillset was huge in mucking up Dallas’ normal offensive plans, and also opening things up on Boston’s offense. He wasn’t on a scoring tear, but Dallas was really worried about him getting mismatches out of actions with White and Porzingis, creating opportunities elsewhere. Overall he wasn’t our best performance but shows why he’s actually the most important/best player on Boston. He can do a little of most anything asked of him. His 3 ball looked better. Don’t be surprised if he scores at least closer to the Indiana series the rest of the way. They’ll probably need at least once explosion to win.</p>

He&rsquo;s a beast offensively but also not to be fucked with defensively and he&rsquo;s a very good play maker for other players too.  He gets his criticism at times but he&rsquo;s still one of the best players on the court no matter who else is there.</p>

      <label for="l7kxuid" class="commentText"><p>Tatum is a great defender but his job was pretty easy if you think about it. Gafford and Lively are pretty limited offensively if it isn&rsquo;t a lob or a dunk. Don&rsquo;t think either can hit a jump shot to save their life. You just need to keep them out of the paint and you effectively neutralize them on the offensive end.  The same could probably said about the rest of the Mavericks&rsquo; role players. Just braindead diving into the paint against multiple defenders and attempting an obvious dunk.</p>

<p>You must feel he lacks in one of these areas given your statement &ldquo;Tatum&rsquo;s defensive versatility is what sets him apart from players like&rdquo; and included Giannis in the list.</p>

<p>Also, I haven&rsquo;t really heard people &ldquo;pushing Tatum down&rdquo;.  The only narrative has been that he&rsquo;s in the 5-10 range rather than the 1-4 range of NBA players.  I don&rsquo;t know why Boston fans get so upset about that.</p>

      <label for="l7l25zw" class="commentText"><p>Agreed! Tatum is elite because he&rsquo;s the most versatile player in the league imo. He&rsquo;s not the best defender, but he can guard every position well. He&rsquo;s a good not great POA defender, he&rsquo;s a really really good help defender, and he&rsquo;s strong enough to never really be exploited in the post.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s not the best offensive player, but he can do it all at a high level. Really good 3 level scorer. He&rsquo;s no Luka, but he&rsquo;s an amazing playmaker.</p>

<p>Also, his rebounding is elite especially for his position. I think that&rsquo;s probably his most underrated skill.</p>

<p>He gets a lot of flack because he&rsquo;s not like a LeBron level talent, but he&rsquo;s easily been a top 10 player. He&rsquo;s honestly underrated. Even though he had a below average/bad game last night, he was still impactful in a ton of ways.</p>

<p>Tatum guarding Gafford and Lively prevents Luka from exploiting the PNR Lob.  No one on the Wolves was able to stop this. Tatum is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m sorry, but this is largely wrong.</p>

<p>The Wolves got fucked up by the lob because they didn’t switch. The (illegal) screen would put Luka’s defender behind the play, which would then force the big (Gobert) to play two (Luka layup or lob). Luka’s a fucking master of navigating that.</p>

<p>Boston is mostly switching. They can do this because they have 2 big and strong perimeter players (Brown and Tatum) who can bother Luka on the perimeter and are stout enough to disrupt the bigs. The Wolves could not, because Gobert/ KAT can’t reliably cover Luka in iso, and Ant/Conley can’t hold up against the bigs down low. They also have the perimeter speed to have Porzingis cheat off of the Mavs’ worst shooter to clog up the lane and scramble behind him to take away corner 3s (the Wolves can’t do this as well because of KAT’s lack of speed/Conley’s size).</p>

<p>Boston is largely switching everything.</p>

      <label for="l7l5vpl" class="commentText"><p>Tbf, this really only applies to regular or really skinny centers. Guys like Jokic, AD, Embiid, Brook, Sengun, and  Sabonis (he&rsquo;s just strong AF) would not really be affected by Tatum.</p>

<p>Centers with little to no offensive skills are the problem. It also helps that the Mavs role players, in general, are under-skilled compared to the Celtics.</p>

<p>Brad Stevens did a masterful job.</p>
