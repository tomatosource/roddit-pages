</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Tatum guarding Gafford and Lively prevents Luka from exploiting the PNR Lob.  No one on the Wolves was able to stop this. Tatum is.</p>

<p>Tatum can also shut down perimeter defenders with his lateral movement.</p>

<p>Tatum&rsquo;s defensive versatility is what sets him apart from players like Jokic, Luka, Embiid, Giannis, SGA, Brunson.</p>

<p>Everyone spent the last 2 months pushing Tatum down so I would like to highlight how his PNR defense is extremely rare and elite and a large component to winning in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="l7ki5mw" class="commentText"><p>Obviously it&rsquo;s still early in the series and a lot can change in the next few games, but thus far it&rsquo;s looked like Boston&rsquo;s roster now is kind of what okc is aiming to be in a year or two. Massive, athletic, excellent defense at every position, and all anchored by amazing two way wings and a giant stretchy center. I dunno if chet will ever shoot like tingus can but if he speeds up his release just a bit I feel like OKC will really be fielding a pretty similar team to Boston, with Shai possibly being an even better #1 option than anything the Celtics have</p>

      <label for="l7k5nwg" class="commentText"><p>I will agree his versatility is what makes him great. He is arguably the most well rounded player in the league, he is good at about everything. Though acting like a guy like Giannis isnt a versatile defensive piece is underselling him.</p>

<p>Obviously some players are much greater at other facets of the game and that can make them a better player than Tatum. But I do believe his ability to literally do everything in the NBA at a high level is undersold at times.</p>

      <label for="l7kiwe1" class="commentText"><p>Being a great all around star is really impactful especially if the rest of your team has people who are stars at certain roles.</p>

<p>Having a shooting big in KP or Horford and a solid handler and driver in Jaylen Brown means Tatum can be a solid very good basketball player in many ways. And depending on how the team is doing he can fill different roles.</p>

<p>KP shot well in Game 1, so Tatum rebounded and passed more and only scored 15 or whatever. But that&rsquo;s impactful AF and there&rsquo;s not a lot of players who can just fundamentally change how they contribute to a game. </p>

      <label for="l7klvfb" class="commentText"><p>It also means you can be flexible with him. I&rsquo;ve always felt Tatum as a perimeter shooting threat isn&rsquo;t playing to his own strengths. He&rsquo;s genuinely a very solid playmaker and if you watch him play his court vision passing skills and his own ability to use his gravity makes it hard to imagine that he&rsquo;s just a five assist per game kind of player. His playmaking feel looks more like a seven assist per game kind of player.</p>

<p>Whatever you need him to do he will do it and he will do it effectively. He fits into any team, he fits into any game plan and he fits into any scheme and roster because of his versatility.</p>

<p>His primary role last night was facilitator. Sure, he didn&rsquo;t score very efficiently and sure, his assist numbers weren&rsquo;t significant. But there is a very clear game plan for him, and he did an exceptional job at giving the game what it needed. Would we have liked to see him score a bit more efficiently? Sure. But there is a very clear game plan for Tatum in game 1 and he executed it super super effectively.</p>

      <label for="l7kdjo0" class="commentText"><p>That’s not really “Embiid too” then though. He’s absolutely a defensive force, one of the best in the nba, but his impact on that end doesn’t come from his versatility the way that Tatum’s and Giannis’ do.</p>

<p>It’s like saying current Steph is special due to his gamebreaking 3 point shooting and someone saying “Shai too, his 3 isn’t quite as good but he’s an unstoppable midrange shooter”.</p>

<p>They’re just different ways of impacting the game and can be more or less valuable depending on the situation.</p>

      <label for="l7khc91" class="commentText"><p>I mean he&rsquo;s a versatile player for a big, he does switch well compared to most centers. Tatum can&rsquo;t actually guard the best centers in the league. He can stop 1 dimensional lob threats in this pick and roll coverage I guess according to one game.</p>

<p>To me it&rsquo;s like saying what sets apart tony parker from prime lebron and prime steph is his floater game. But one thing&rsquo;s a lot more important and that&rsquo;s their overall offense which is on a different level compared to tony parker, (just like comparing embiid and tatum defensively). It doesn&rsquo;t actually set them apart in a significant way, other than being idiosyncratic.</p>

His conditioning isn&rsquo;t always there and can allow him to lose some of his effectiveness and his injury proneness definitely hurts him a lot too. But yeah I&rsquo;d say Tatum, Giannis, and Embiid are tier 1 two-way players. I&rsquo;d say then guys like Shai are right behind them.</p>

Jrue and Tatum are absolutely elite vs those types of players ( Kornet/Horford are also an elite defenders vs those types for centers).</p>

<p>White is our dedicated speed stopper, which actually makes his somewhat of a liability defensively for this matchup. But he&rsquo;s still elite on offence so it works fine.</p>

<p>Not to say that many are capable of this like Tatum is, but he also wouldnt be able to do this against the top centers in the league.</p>

      <label for="l7k8aff" class="commentText"><p>I still don&rsquo;t see this as a huge negative. He may not be good enough for Embiid and Jokic, but in this playoff run for example the Celtics have been able to put him on Bam, Mobley, and Myles Turner for large stretches and still win a lot of basketball games. Then obviously on the flip side you have to have your center cover someone else because Tatum can cook literally every single center in the league on offense</p>

      <label for="l7kbj06" class="commentText"><p>I think it depends. Like he can&rsquo;t guard Embiid 1 on 1 when Embiid has the ball all that great (I&rsquo;d say he can do better than most but that&rsquo;s not good enough), but he can cover him off ball. Jokic could definitely back him down when posting up, but Tatum could smother him enough to limit his passing options. He&rsquo;s not an &ldquo;answer&rdquo; against big centers in general, but he can limit them as a secondary option, something he can do against almost anyone. As a primary on ball defender, he&rsquo;s usually not your first choice unless the opponent&rsquo;s top ball handler is another big wing like Lebron or KD, but off ball he&rsquo;s gonna lock down basically anyone, and usually be able to help everyone else with their guy too. He&rsquo;s just a really useful people whose contributions are easy to miss because he&rsquo;s rarely the one making the play, he&rsquo;s just forcing you to avoid where he is, and he takes up a big area.</p>

But they also looked like shit in the game 1&rsquo;s vs LAC and OKC and then made adjustments and won the series. I&rsquo;m not suggesting the Mavs are going to turn around and dominate BOS, certainly BOS shut down literally everyone but Luka last night. But they play a series for a reason. Last night was a blow out but despite how piss poor Dallas played they made a solid push and came back within striking distance in the 3rd.</p>

<p>I can guarantee 1 adjustment they will make that I&rsquo;m absolutely shocked Kidd didn&rsquo;t make in game, the Mavs absolutely can not switch on Porzingis. Time and again I saw Lively and Gafford switching on a KP screen and then the Mavs paid for it.</p>

<p>Disagree about the Giannis point. Embiid provides the best rim protection of any consensus top 10 player and one of the best of any star, but I’m not sure I’d trust him to defend even mediocre point guards in a playoffs setting.</p>

<p>Like is it apart of it? Yes. Is it “what breaks the Mavs offense” No.</p>

<p>You can point out defensive abilities unique to most of those players. Like Shai isn’t going to switch on to a center like Tatum, but he absolutely is able to come from the weak side and thwart them - which is why he has the most blocks ever by a PG in a playoff series.</p>

      <label for="l7kjy3t" class="commentText"><p>You can analyze Tatum&rsquo;s non-scoring impact all you want but the reality is yesterday&rsquo;s game wouldn&rsquo;t have been any closer with Tatum on the bench. Celtics are just too deep and simply don&rsquo;t even need him to win.</p>

<p><a href="https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4268/onoff#tab-team_efficiency" target="_blank">Tatum&rsquo;s efficiency differential</a> when he was on the floor during the regular season was -2. Obviously the first time of his career it&rsquo;s negative.</p>

<p>They literally don&rsquo;t need Jayson Tatum.</p>

      <label for="l7kk4f7" class="commentText"><p>Not just guard, but he came out hunting rebounds. The Mavs need their big men to be competitive on the boards if the Celtics aren’t even going to put a center on them. Despite this, Tatum on his own had more rebounds than Lively, Gafford, and Kleber combined. And that’s by having 11, not like 20. That’s an area they’ll have to be better if they want to punish putting Porzingis and Horford elsewhere in position to help clog the paint on lobs/PnRs.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t even call that a particularly good game from Tatum due to some scoring inefficiency (though part of that inefficiency was some late shot clock chucks) and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> turnovers being pretty awful, but his Swiss Army knife skillset was huge in mucking up Dallas’ normal offensive plans, and also opening things up on Boston’s offense. He wasn’t on a scoring tear, but Dallas was really worried about him getting mismatches out of actions with White and Porzingis, creating opportunities elsewhere. Overall he wasn’t our best performance but shows why he’s actually the most important/best player on Boston. He can do a little of most anything asked of him. His 3 ball looked better. Don’t be surprised if he scores at least closer to the Indiana series the rest of the way. They’ll probably need at least once explosion to win.</p>

      <label for="l7klmzx" class="commentText"><p>I feel like he gets all the shit because his shooting % is low and isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;prime time&rdquo; or whatever the fuck SAS means by that. People love offense, defense is always less highlighted. I&rsquo;m talking the yeoman&rsquo;s defense like PnR, boxing out, switching&hellip;chase down blocks get all the glory certainly, but goodness Tatum is so important to this team on defense.</p>

      <label for="l7kmqg0" class="commentText"><p>SGA has become a severely underrated defender in these tatum discussions. Before you talk about versatility, Tatum can’t guard ones and he can’t guard true centers. Tatums versatility in which positions he can actually guard is expected for his size.</p>

<p>He can’t guard quick little guards, and he can’t guard a true center 7 feet or over.</p>

<p>He can’t guard 1-5. He can guard 2 through like 4.5. Which for a 6’9 athletic guy should be the bare minimum</p>

      <label for="l7km0at" class="commentText"><p>Also, as dumb as it&rsquo;s going to sound via text, pre-emptively giving Luka bad matchups to exploit (on SOME possessions) is working out pretty well?</p>

<p>Putting Horford or Kornet on Luka means there&rsquo;s no reason for him to call a PnR and get the switch. What, would he rather get Jrue or Tatum switched onto him? So he iso&rsquo;s on a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; Celtics defender, everyone else stays at home, and suddenly one of Luka&rsquo;s best assets - his playmaking - is basically off the table.</p>

<p>So pre-switching Tatum onto Lively/Gafford and Horford/Kornet onto Luka prevents them from even <em>wanting</em> to runt he PnR and get the switch, and even if they do then there&rsquo;s a big defending a big to eliminate the lob threat. Their best bet (on paper) is for Luka to repeatedly iso his defender and drop 30+ - but then everyone else is ice cold when they&rsquo;re needed most (including Kyrie, who&rsquo;s exiled to Derrick White Island or whatever that whole time).</p>

<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s probably only possible because the Celtics &ldquo;bad&rdquo; defenders are still above average. Still, it&rsquo;s fascinating to see these sorts of adjustments in the very first game.</p>
