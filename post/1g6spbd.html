The injured Cavs team still beat other healthy playoff teams like the Pacers. The OKC team beat the healthy Suns and and a still good Knicks as the next games after the Rockets, both without SGA.</p>

Was he as good the first two years as he was this year when he went off? No, but that’s pretty standard development and growth, players are usually better in year 3 than year 1. Doesn’t hurt that he finally had an nba level coach for the first time in his life</p>

      <label for="lslfbhr" class="commentText"><p>problem is Jalen Green has done this every damn year.</p>

<p>for his career in the months of March and April Green averages 23.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>.7 on 45.<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>37</sub>.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>78</sub>.1 (57.6 TS%) with 2.2 TPG</p>

<p>from the months of October through February he averages 18.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>.2 on 40.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub>.0/80.1 (52.5 TS%) with 2.4 TPG</p>

<p>you can look at his career year-by-year and this trend holds for each season. he’s inefficient as fuck up until March (save for a single month in November 2022), then he goes on a mini-heater where he plays like a borderline All-Star through the end of the regular season. you convince yourself he’s gonna turn a corner next year and when he comes back he’s the same inefficient chucker he was at the beginning of the prior season. it’s literally clockwork</p>

<p>no shot in hell would I give him a max and if that’s enough to make him walk then so be it. these ball-hogging inefficient microwave scorers who don’t do anything else well on a basketball court aren’t worth much to teams who are actually trying to win something.</p>

      <label for="lsljryy" class="commentText"><p>the other thing is that when you give a player a contract you’re not just paying them for the production they’ve already given you, you’re paying them for their projected future production.</p>

<p>with that in mind, why would I give Green a max deal when he‘s barely improved at all as a player since his rookie season? he’s still an inefficient scorer, he still doesn’t play defense, he still doesn’t look to get his teammates involved.</p>

<p>it’s genuinely stunning to me that he himself even thinks he can demand a max deal. somebody in his camp needs to be honest with him</p>

<p>look at guys like Barnes, Suggs and Wagner drafted after him who are miles ahead of where they were as rookies, meanwhile Green is basically still the same guy. to have played this long and still have not progressed in an appreciable way as a player is a major indictment on him IMO and raises real questions about his maturity and work ethic</p>

      <label for="lslgmqe" class="commentText"><p>Sengun as a non-top draft pick will give us more cap space if we extend next offseason. Same thing that happened with Maxey. $25 million extra cap IIRC. Given his injury, he may lock in a lower extension for the guaranteed money, though. We’ll see which way it shakes and how much the team benefits. But given his productivity and the other people in his class getting maxes, I’m happy with it.</p>

<p>Green is definitely on a prove-it year though. The highs are high, but it’s always a question of consistency. The process and how he plays looks different and significantly better in preseason, but we’ll see how the results pan out over the course of the regular season.</p>

I&rsquo;m assuming Kawhi won&rsquo;t qualify because of injuries, and Embiid will definitely fail to play enough games. Still a steep climb. Maybe in 4-5 years he could do it, but the Rockets will still be in the play-in range this year.</p>

<p>edit: this guy blocked me (lol) so I can&rsquo;t reply to the post below me, but In no particular order off the top of my head &ndash; Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Franz Wagner, Paolo Banchero, Cade Cunningham, Tyrese Maxey, Donovan Mitchell, James Harden, Ja Morant, Bam Adebayo, and Zion Williamson would all clearly have a much better argument for All-NBA before we even started considering Sengun for third team.</p>

      <label for="lsliso1" class="commentText"><p>Cade Cunningham, Franz Wagner, James Harden? lol. I agree with Jaylen Brown but I could also see Haliburton losing a spot especially if he keeps playing like he did post all-Star break. Trae, Ja, Zion could all easily miss 18 games and be out of consideration. Bam and Paolo are serious competition but if Sengun plays good he could make it over them. We will see.</p>

<p>Individually, Sabonis won’t decline much but he won’t improve much either. Sengun on the other hand could improve a lot. So, Sabonis won’t make it because Sengun will just be better.</p>

<p>Brooks is tradeable but if Jabari doesn’t improve and wants to chase money you let him go and keep
Brooks.</p>

<p>It’ll be brutal business but we have some picks, building a culture and a cornerstone in sengun.</p>

<p>I’d rather try for the best and risk being bad again than accept mid and pay to avoid being bad</p>

      <label for="lsle5w9" class="commentText"><p>That is the reason. There are reports outside of ESPN that have been negotiations for less than the max but still very high though since Sengun would like some stability. Free cap space in a weak free agent class isn&rsquo;t the only avenue for the Rockets since they can still take FVV&rsquo;s player option and trade that if a star wanted to come to Houston.</p>

<p>Sengun will just need to walk away and demand a trade from any organization that would do that. He ain’t winning for a team like that.</p>

<p>Also what is the point of this sentence Shams</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There’s not a max contract on the table right now. If there was, there would have been an extension signed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No fucking shit. You’re telling me someone would sign to get the most possible money now instead of waiting to sign later?</p>

<p>Sengun on the other end is IMO still underrated because of a fluky win streak vs bad teams when he got hurt, if they can get him below the max they should 100% do it, not sure they will be able to do so in a year when he has proven that he&rsquo;s the 3rd best offensive center in the league</p>

<p>Houston&rsquo;s problem currently though is that their identity isn&rsquo;t really defined currently, whose team is it? Who do you go to with 5 seconds on the clock, who&rsquo;s the cultural leader of the team, etc&hellip;</p>

<p>big season for Green as well. Self creation threat, with Adams healthy&hellip; If he&rsquo;s a max contract player I want all star calibre player</p>

<p>I really like Houston but I really like them because of DB, Jabari Smith, Tari Eason, Stevo, Freddie, what Cam Whitmore can be, etc&hellip; aka a team of just guys with no dudes&hellip;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a question of whether he is good, it&rsquo;s whether you can win a championship with him on the max.</p>

      <label for="lslh0oz" class="commentText"><p>Because more than 3 players in the league should get the max. Doesn&rsquo;t mean you won&rsquo;t win but not high odds. When the alternative is being a crappy team since Harden left at least being a marketable team with a chance is important.</p>

<p>Also, what&rsquo;s the alternative is letting him walk and being a nothing team hoping to tank for years to maybe have a shot. Just being competitive is the goal for the majority of front offices.</p>
