      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fg32lu/how_much_of_the_shift_to_streaming_vs_cable/"><p>How much of the shift to streaming vs cable actually contributes to the decline in ratings?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I&rsquo;ve heard both sides of people talking about the subject. Some people claim the NBA viewership is declining regardless of where the views are coming from. They claim the NBA has deteriorated as a product largely due to rule changes / officiating and all that jazz. Others claim it&rsquo;s the opposite where NBA viewership is actually increasing and a large amount of it isn&rsquo;t being caught, statistically, because of streaming and so much of viewership coming outside of America and most TV ratings only account for US households.</p>

<p>Which do you think is the actual direction viewership is trending toward? And what&rsquo;s your overall opinion of the direction the NBA, as a product, is moving?</p>

There isn&rsquo;t a single TV show in this country even remotely <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/most-popular-tv-shows-highest-rated-2023-2024-season-tracker-survivor-1236015844/" target="_blank">close</a> to getting those kinds of viewers in 2024. Even the NFL only averages 19 million viewers per game, and that&rsquo;s the most watched television program in the country. Keep in mind the US population was also smaller back then.</p>

<p>So yeah, the shift to streaming has undoubtedly impacted viewership.</p>

<p>And the the regional deals make it worse. Do you know how hard it is to watch an NBA game in Canada?</p>

<p>In the 90s, I could just turn on Channel 50 and watch EVERY Pistons game and then click on NBC and catch all the big in-season games and playoff games.</p>

<p>Now? I can&rsquo;t even watch the All Star game.</p>

      <label for="ln15fge" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, my theory, which I consider plausible but I have no data to really backup is pretty much exactly this. The NBA made rights deals with cable (and now streamers), which pay tons of money in the contract. But cable (and even more so streamers) have a different profit model than traditional TV networks: ratings don’t matter as much as subscribers. Traditional TV networks make less money per viewer, but they have many more viewers. So, the NBA kind of knowingly traded ratings for more money— viewership may be down, but they’re making more money per viewer. It remains to be seen if this trajectory is sustainable though.</p>

<p>In contrast, the NFL was always skeptical of a model where they squeezed more money out of bigger fans at the risk of losing some casual fans: they wanted to remain a part of the mass market and broadcast television was and is still essential to that. But the NFL found other ways to make more money off of bigger fans (Sunday Ticket, Redzone), and the NBA did try to duplicate that somewhat. However, the NBA just has way too many games for any product like Sunday Ticket to really catch on.</p>

<ol>
<li>They moved my team away from the city (sonics)</li>
<li>I tried to continue paying for the product by adopting another team, but they immediately blacked out the games for them up here in seattle (because apparently seattle is local to portland 3 hours away)</li>
<li>I tried to get around this with a VPN to still pay for their product, but last year they blocked VPN&rsquo;s from working on LP.</li>
<li>And finally this year, my adopted team became so awful, they&rsquo;re not fun to watch anymore.</li>

<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding! i&rsquo;m still going to try and watch this year. It is weird that ratings are decreasing though. Wonder why?</p>

      <label for="lmz71io" class="commentText"><p>As everybody has moved on to content on their schedule, the traditional viewership numbers are less and less accurate. I think the game has obviously grown at a global scale, and income from merchandising and streaming rights reflect that. It’s just hard to pin down because everybody views the content their own way.</p>

They pick up the pace a little during playoffs but it’s minimal .</p>

<p>It’s the same reason in my opinion why so many movies flop . The ones with big box office numbers are the ones advertising through relevant channels like tik tok . I don’t know when a movie is coming out until the week of and you use to be harassed for weeks .</p>

<p>I shouldn’t have to google “ what nba playoff game is tonight “ it should be flooding my tik tok like the nfl</p>

      <label for="ln0l20d" class="commentText"><p>Streaming and digital cable is tracked with of accuracy unimaginable a few decades ago. Somebody has extremely accurate numbers, but who?</p>

<p>There are many streaming platforms. Each streaming platform will track viewings for its products with extraordinary accuracy but do not have visibility into numbers on other platforms.</p>

<p>This means that only the NBA and nobody else has authoritatively accurate viewership numbers for all viewings of NBA games. They had to give accurate numbers to potential bidders when negotiating rights deals so there are a select few media executives who have second-hand but not authoritative access to these numbers. All of these parties are unlikely to have leaked them.</p>

<p>The days of ratings reports being reliable are long over. Any numbers you hear about are just estimates either based off of a set of assumptions or 3rd party tracking technology. This isn&rsquo;t just for the NBA, this is for all media. These estimates could be close to the real numbers or they could be way off. There&rsquo;s not much reason to have high confidence in them while the value of the TV rights deals are concrete numbers publicly reported by the parties involved.</p>

<p>My opinion is that the new TV deal compared to the old one says a lot about more about the direction of the NBA as a product than anybody&rsquo;s guesses.</p>
