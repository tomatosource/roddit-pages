</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>With salaries exploding around the NBA, players should be throwing a party. But unfortunately, that party also includes a game of musical chairs where a few get left out of the cap space parade. For them, it may make sense to lick their wounds and return to the market next year.</p>

<p>Here are the most intriguing among them &ndash;</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(1) PG Tyus Jones, Washington, 28 years old</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a new era in the NBA, one where traditional point guards with traditional size are being devalued, as illustrated by the lack of a market for Tyus Jones. He&rsquo;s a throwback at the PG spot &ndash; a steady eddie field general. Limited by his athleticism and his size (at 6&rsquo;1&rdquo;), he&rsquo;s always been viewed as a high-end backup. Still, Jones is a smart player who has always been productive. Per 36, he&rsquo;s averaged 13.0 points, 7.6 assists, 1.8 steals, and only 1.2 TO, one of the best A/TO ratios in the entire league. He&rsquo;s somewhere between a poor man&rsquo;s Mike Conley and a rich man&rsquo;s Monte Morris.</p>

<p><em>best fit</em>: Presuming Tyus Jones and his team can&rsquo;t work out a better sign-and-trade for $10M+ somewhere, he may have to take a one-year deal to return to the market next year. The best place for him to stay in the spotlight may be <strong>Denver</strong>. They&rsquo;ve lacked a backup PG since Monte Morris left. Frankly, they lack depth across the board; their roster goes about as deep as a microphallus. Not only could Tyus Jones anchor a bench unit, he&rsquo;d buffer them from a potentially-disasterous scenario if Jamal Murray or Nikola Jokic misses extended time.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(2) SG Gary Trent Jr., Toronto, 26 years old</strong></p>

<p>I thought that Gary Trent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Trent_Jr." target="_blank">Jr.</a> would sign a healthy $60M contract given his theoretical role as a 3+D wing, but the market has spoken and suggested that they don&rsquo;t buy his act. His defensive effort has clearly waned since a plucky run with Portland in the bubble. The shooting is still there, though, as he hit 39.3% from deep last year and averages 38.6% for his career. He&rsquo;s not going to give you much else (with meek averages of 3.0 rebounds and 1.9 assists per 36 in his career), but that&rsquo;s still something.</p>

<p><em>best fit</em>: If Trent Jr. needs to wait a year to re-enter free agency, then re-uniting with Damian Lillard in <strong>Milwaukee</strong> makes the most sense from both sides. Like Denver, the Bucks&rsquo; depth has been a problem for them, particularly on the wing spots. Trent Jr. isn&rsquo;t a world beater, but he&rsquo;s probably better than departing Malik Beasley or Pat Connaughton or the young prospects (MarJon Beauchamp and Andre Jackson Jr.) that Doc Rivers will refuse to develop anyway.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(3) SG Luke Kennard, Memphis, 28 years old</strong></p>

<p>Luke Kennard isn&rsquo;t just a &ldquo;shooter&rdquo; &ndash; he&rsquo;s a flamethrower. He&rsquo;s legitimately one of the best bombers in the league, with career averages of 43.9% from three and 87.9% from the line. Heck, he&rsquo;s averaged over 45.0% from three across the last three seasons combined. Obviously, there&rsquo;s a reason Kennard isn&rsquo;t raking in huge money. He&rsquo;s injury prone, and limited by his size (6&rsquo;5&rdquo;, 6&rsquo;5&rdquo; wingspan). As a result, teams have been reluctant to trust him with a major role. He&rsquo;s only started 110 games across 7 his seasons in the league.</p>

<p><em>best fit</em>: It sounds like Luke Kennard is working toward re-signing with Memphis, but I&rsquo;ve never particularly liked his fit there. After all, the Grizzlies have a similar (but better) version of him with Desmond Bane, capping his upside. He&rsquo;d be best served on a team with bigger perimeter players who can cover for him defensively, or perhaps a defensive eraser like Victor Wembanyama in <strong>San Antonio</strong>. Ever since the Spurs perfected &ldquo;the Beautiful Game&rdquo; and beat the Heatles in the Finals, they&rsquo;ve ranked in the bottom 10 in three point attempts.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>other names of note</strong></p>

<p>Is it really the end of the road of relevance for former # 1 pick <strong>Markelle Fultz</strong>? Maybe. He still can&rsquo;t stay healthy or hit (or even attempt) a three. Perhaps he can utilize his length and reinvent himself as a Delon Wright-type backup. <strong>Landry Shamet</strong> is a more reliable combo guard who gives you some 3+D. At 6&rsquo;8&rdquo;, SF <strong>Jordan Nwora</strong> also has some of that potential at the wing spot.</p>

      <label for="ld5t2ne" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I originally wrote a longer blurb about Fultz that included Brooklyn (although they have Simmons) and Chicago (although they have Giddey). If either team wants multiple rehab projects it makes sense.</p>
