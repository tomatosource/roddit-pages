<p>I honestly have more respect for Flip Saunders than Larry Brown as a Pistons fan.</p>

<p>The fact that Brown got his first ring with the Pistons and was taking calls from the Knicks (a shittier team by far) while in the conference finals&hellip; HORSE SHIT.</p>

<p>What an ass. A quitter.</p>

<p>He was such a GREAT coach with regard to X&rsquo;s and O&rsquo;s, but he was such an AWFUL coach in so many other respect.</p>

<p>He killed Darko&rsquo;s career. He killed Team USA&rsquo;s gold medal. That dude had Tim Duncan in his prime and was giving most of the shots to chucker Iverson. If ANYBODY else had coached that team, they would have walked to the gold medal.</p>

<p>People shit on the players for that loss: It was 100% on Brown. Some of the worst coaching.</p>

<p>Can you imagine sitting guys like Wade, LeBron, and Melo because &ldquo;Their rookies.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l9up59h" class="commentText"><p>Darko was high on EVERYBODY&rsquo;S draft board.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s just a big man with a huge upside and a lot of potential, and the Pistons knew they didn&rsquo;t need somebody to come in and play big minutes and figured they&rsquo;d take time to develop him.</p>

<p>He just didn&rsquo;t pan out, in large part due to the way Brown treated him. He was a 7 footer, and as the old adage goes, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t teach height.&rdquo; He was also a very adept shot blocker and a good rebounder. Had he been drafted lower and picked up by a team that played him, things could have been different.</p>

<p>Asking why? He&rsquo;s a big man. The next bet big man is the most valuable guy in the league, and you just never know where that&rsquo;s coming from Sam Bowie? Thabeet? Oden? Wiseman? Yinke Dare? Raw big guys are picked high a lot.</p>

<p>Why did Denver &lsquo;waste&rsquo; a pick on a fat center from Serbia? I mean, even in his first couple years, people were saying &ldquo;This Jokic guy is pretty good, but he&rsquo;s got to stop coming into the season out of shape and treating the regular season as a way to play himself into shape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fast forward a few years, and he&rsquo;s a FMVP, and three time MVP.  You just never know. Had he gone first in the the 2014 draft over Embiid, people would have been shitting on the Nuggets.</p>

<p>Big men are big. That&rsquo;s why he went second.</p>

<p>What I don’t understand from the Pistons’ POV is exactly what you called out about Larry Brown. Did the team think Brown would develop him, and not realize he’d shun Darko instead? The pairing was oil &amp; water, and I’m not sure why Detroit thought it would work.</p>

      <label for="l9uobs3" class="commentText"><p>Melo got sparing minutes and they didn&rsquo;t run plays for him. Wade was playing point guard at the time for the Heat and was forced to play off ball because Iverson was handling the ball.</p>

<p>But neither of those two explains why Iverson (who shot 37%) was getting more shots than ANYBODY and by a long shot: He was taking over 11 shots a game compared to 2 for Amare (.563), 4 for Boozer (.600), 6.4 for Odom (.569) 4 for LeBron (.594) 8 for Marion (.531) and 8.4 for Duncan (.567).</p>

<p>The two guys that Brown gave the MOST shots were Iverson (11.3 shots on .378) and Marbury (8.9 on .423). The guard he had coached on Philly and the guard he was going to be coaching in New York.</p>

<p>Brown allowed personal preferences to dictate who got minutes and who got shots.</p>

<p>It was HORRIBLE fucking coaching. Hands down. Larry Brown and Iverson are the reason that Team USA ended up with a bronze medal. It was a fucking joke.</p>

<p>Any coach with a job in the NBA at the time would have done a better job than Brown did.</p>
