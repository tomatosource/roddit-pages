<p>I honestly have more respect for Flip Saunders than Larry Brown as a Pistons fan.</p>

<p>The fact that Brown got his first ring with the Pistons and was taking calls from the Knicks (a shittier team by far) while in the conference finals&hellip; HORSE SHIT.</p>

<p>What an ass. A quitter.</p>

<p>He was such a GREAT coach with regard to X&rsquo;s and O&rsquo;s, but he was such an AWFUL coach in so many other respect.</p>

<p>He killed Darko&rsquo;s career. He killed Team USA&rsquo;s gold medal. That dude had Tim Duncan in his prime and was giving most of the shots to chucker Iverson. If ANYBODY else had coached that team, they would have walked to the gold medal.</p>

<p>People shit on the players for that loss: It was 100% on Brown. Some of the worst coaching.</p>

<p>Can you imagine sitting guys like Wade, LeBron, and Melo because &ldquo;Their rookies.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l9up59h" class="commentText"><p>Darko was high on EVERYBODY&rsquo;S draft board.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s just a big man with a huge upside and a lot of potential, and the Pistons knew they didn&rsquo;t need somebody to come in and play big minutes and figured they&rsquo;d take time to develop him.</p>

<p>He just didn&rsquo;t pan out, in large part due to the way Brown treated him. He was a 7 footer, and as the old adage goes, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t teach height.&rdquo; He was also a very adept shot blocker and a good rebounder. Had he been drafted lower and picked up by a team that played him, things could have been different.</p>

<p>Asking why? He&rsquo;s a big man. The next bet big man is the most valuable guy in the league, and you just never know where that&rsquo;s coming from Sam Bowie? Thabeet? Oden? Wiseman? Yinke Dare? Raw big guys are picked high a lot.</p>

<p>Why did Denver &lsquo;waste&rsquo; a pick on a fat center from Serbia? I mean, even in his first couple years, people were saying &ldquo;This Jokic guy is pretty good, but he&rsquo;s got to stop coming into the season out of shape and treating the regular season as a way to play himself into shape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fast forward a few years, and he&rsquo;s a FMVP, and three time MVP.  You just never know. Had he gone first in the the 2014 draft over Embiid, people would have been shitting on the Nuggets.</p>

<p>Big men are big. That&rsquo;s why he went second.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>True, he also was the most raw prospect of the Top 3 players in that draft and the one with the least amount of skills attached to him. Melo was the obvious choice, they just botched it because they believed in picking for potential instead of drafting the best player available, which is always a mistake.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He just didn&rsquo;t pan out, in large part due to the way Brown treated him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, this is just plain hating Larry Brown at this point, Darko didn&rsquo;t pan out because he couldn&rsquo;t play, plain and simple. The only half decent skill he had was shot blocking, he was poor at literally everything else that he tried to do in a basketball court. Darko talked about this himself, he didn&rsquo;t listen to anybody, didn&rsquo;t work hard and thought he was the best thing since sliced bread when he came into the league when in reality he was just bad, really bad.</p>

<p>For example, if anyone seriously thinks that had they drafted Carmelo Anthony that he wouldn&rsquo;t have succeeded, yall seriously have no idea about anything about basketball.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did Denver &lsquo;waste&rsquo; a pick on a fat center from Serbia?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Denver picked Jokic in the SECOND ROUND, that&rsquo;s completely different from picking a project with the No.2 overall pick over Carmelo fucking Anthony, a guy that had just destroyed everybody at Syracuse and you could just watch the tape and see that he had every skill possible offensively and that he was going to be able to play in the NBA.</p>

<p>Even then, Jokic almost immediately proved that he was worth the gamble, watch a single game of Jokic&rsquo;s rookie season and you can already see all the instincts and raw skills that would eventually lead him to become what he became, Darko had nothing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Big men are big. That&rsquo;s why he went second.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is a notoriously stupid way of thinking and has led to some of the most stupid draft decisions of all-time, some you even listed. When you are on the lottery, you pick the best player available ALWAYS, never on potential. Wanna pick on potential? Use a late 1st round pick or a 2nd round pick for it, 99.9% of the times picking on potential with a lottery pick fails spectacularly.</p>

<p>Larry Brown was a legendary Xs and Os coach, but he did do many things wrong with how he handled his career by team hopping and negotiating deals while still coaching teams, but Darko Milicic was NOT his fault, Darko couldn&rsquo;t play and he was going to get eaten alive in the NBA with his mentality/skills at literally any other place.</p>

<p>Had the Pistons drafted Melo instead, not only he would&rsquo;ve worked out for them, but Melo probably would&rsquo;ve had a completely different mentality throughout his career after coming off the bench for his first and second year, learning from vets like Chauncey, Sheed and Rip. No doubts he would&rsquo;ve struggled early on with a bench role, but Melo had all the skills necessary and winning solves everything, plus that team had some great player leadership.</p>

<p>What I don’t understand from the Pistons’ POV is exactly what you called out about Larry Brown. Did the team think Brown would develop him, and not realize he’d shun Darko instead? The pairing was oil &amp; water, and I’m not sure why Detroit thought it would work.</p>

      <label for="l9uobs3" class="commentText"><p>Melo got sparing minutes and they didn&rsquo;t run plays for him. Wade was playing point guard at the time for the Heat and was forced to play off ball because Iverson was handling the ball.</p>

<p>But neither of those two explains why Iverson (who shot 37%) was getting more shots than ANYBODY and by a long shot: He was taking over 11 shots a game compared to 2 for Amare (.563), 4 for Boozer (.600), 6.4 for Odom (.569) 4 for LeBron (.594) 8 for Marion (.531) and 8.4 for Duncan (.567).</p>

<p>The two guys that Brown gave the MOST shots were Iverson (11.3 shots on .378) and Marbury (8.9 on .423). The guard he had coached on Philly and the guard he was going to be coaching in New York.</p>

<p>Brown allowed personal preferences to dictate who got minutes and who got shots.</p>

<p>It was HORRIBLE fucking coaching. Hands down. Larry Brown and Iverson are the reason that Team USA ended up with a bronze medal. It was a fucking joke.</p>

<p>Any coach with a job in the NBA at the time would have done a better job than Brown did.</p>

<p>Melo bruh, there&rsquo;s about a 0% chance Larry Brown is going to favor you over Taushan Prince. and Prince was playing close to 40MPG so you&rsquo;re spending your most pivotal development years playing mop-up minutes.</p>

Time has proven that Rick was good enough to win with us if we stuck with him. Larry got his but I celebrated when Carlisle finally won with Dallas because we always knew he was a championship coach.</p>

      <label for="l9wh896" class="commentText"><p>Yeah&hellip; I think Carlisle was a better coach by the time he got to Dallas.</p>

<p>One thing to remember is that Joe Dumars literally had to walk in and TELL Carlisle to play Prince in that series against Orlando, which was the difference maker. He shut T-Mac down.</p>

<p>That season, Prince got 10mpg. The last three games of that series, he played double his season average. In the first four games (when they went 1-3) Prince got a DNP, 15 minutes, 11 minutes, and another DNP.</p>

<p>The Pistons were 4-2 in games Prince got minutes, and 0-2 when Carlisle sat him.</p>

<p>I love Carlisle. Was happy to see him win in Dallas, happy to see him grow as a coach, and happy to see him in Indy doing well, but he was a young guy and not prepared to win at a high level at that point.</p>

      <label for="l9wgfur" class="commentText"><p>I think Melo would have had a harder time under Larry Brown than George Karl.</p>

<p>Also, Melo&rsquo;s lack of defence would have hurt the Pistons team chemistry.</p>

<p>In my mind, the best pick in hindsight would have been Wade (who the Heat grabbed ahead of where he was expected to go on most draft boards). Wade could play both guard position, was a smart, high IQ player. Brown would have had an easier time with him than Melo, or rather the other way around.</p>

      <label for="l9vv2oz" class="commentText"><p>Carlisle got robbed of an early championship by feuding with ownership. He&rsquo;s the one that built that team on the court with Dumars as the one who assembled the team in the front office. Props to Larry Brown for coaching that team to a title, but the rest of his NBA career was mediocre (outside of a few Pacers years) and he really gets overrated as an NBA coach because of that one title. Was a huge headcase as a coach for the 76ers and is responsible for the US&rsquo;s worst Olympics ever. He was a curmudgeon who clashed with bigger ego stars and was overly harsh with younger players. Plus the guy was just kind of a dick, especially with that New York hopping shit he pulled</p>

<ol>
<li><p>He arrives, there is hate all around, he’d like to trade the entire team.</p></li>
