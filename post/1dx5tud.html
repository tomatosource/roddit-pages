LeBron is the offensive engine of the Lakers. He makes everyone on the team better and generates most of the points. I know AD is the defensive anchor, but in the modern NBA an offensive engine is more valuable to winning. Nobody says Gobert is better than Ant.</p>

<p>Not to beat the dead horse on Embiid, but durability is my main issue with him.</p>

<p>Having a higher expected value per game in some set of stats is just the start, you need to be present to actually act on them. When you&rsquo;re talking your teams main guy, would you rather have the guy shooting 34/11/5 for 39 games or 25/7/8 for 71? At a certain point, being reliably present is itself the most important stat.</p>

Embiid&rsquo;s injuries makes him impossible for comparisons, but James is consistently a better playoff performer than him if you value that. Lebron certainly gives his team more than Embiid. If you only care about Embiid&rsquo;s small sample sizes of dominance then Embiid is the best player in the nba.</p>

He just got knee inflammation come playoff times Kawhi played 3 less games then Lebron in the regular season. People have this weird way of tainting Kawhis entire season because he missed the last two weeks. </p>

<p>Lebron for his age is UNREAL, but don’t get it twisted for his age is an important factor. </p>

<p>He’s not top 10 in the current NBA, not the best on this team, and tbh he isn’t the best player on the Lakers either.</p>

He came back from plantar fasciitis in like a month last year.</p>

<p>I’m still taking old Bron over most players in the world. There are players better than him now, but not 10. Also he’s absolutely the best player on the Lakers</p>

LeBron was better by production and efficiency in their head-to-heads as well. He also had arguably better numbers than Durant, Edwards, and Brunson who were all on the 2nd team.</p>

<p>LeBron and Curry will likely stand out on this team because they have abilities that aren&rsquo;t really duplicated by anyone else on the team. Curry&rsquo;s still the best shooter alive and LeBron&rsquo;s basketball IQ can really only be compared to Luka and Joker. This should be such a fun team.</p>

Fact is Kawhi crushes Lebron on D and is just a better go to bucket getter. Lebron when he has the energy still is amazing, but Kawhi was just too good last year. Having Harden to distribute allowed him to really turn up defensively. </p>

<p>The Olympic team for sure will be super fun to watch it always is </p>

      <label for="lc0mfl7" class="commentText"><p>I think you can still go 100% hard without practicing in game speed. Going in game speed is kinda abnormal because if you don&rsquo;t ace everything then there&rsquo;s a good chance the entire thing you&rsquo;re practicing goes to shit. This is true on other fields as well - I think most guitar players, even great ones, practice at first on a lower speed and then ramp it up to &ldquo;performance speed&rdquo;.</p>

<p>He has that story where ant was working out for the warriors pre draft and ant was absolutely busting his ass, and Steve Kerr, not out of animosity but just because he wanted to help him was basically like “is that all you can do?”  He took ant out to dinner after and was telling him what Steph and kd do in practice and ant immediately called his trainer and was like “we need to take it up a notch”.</p>

<p>Here’s an article that talks about nba practices.</p>

<p>“The rhythm of the NBA also deemphasizes practice somewhat. Most coaches now forego hard, intense practices for video sessions and shoot-arounds. Health and load management are just as important as full-contact scrimmage.”</p>

      <label for="lc0dr72" class="commentText"><p>He’s right in a sense NBA teams practice less than every level below them but that’s because the expectation is you do your own work. You might practice for a few hours that’s it. The 82 game schedule is gruelling asf practice isn’t a big part of it. When your in the league practice is not where you improve it’s the off season.</p>

<p>I suspect there’s a lot more individual coaching for players and otherwise team learning offensive and defensive drills. I highly doubt teams are using their limited practice time to just shoot around like they do before games 90% of the time.</p>

<p>MJ was known to be such an intense practice player that Jerry Krause said he was reluctant to draft shooting guards. Not only would they likely never play while MJ was on the team, but MJ would just go so hard at people during routine practices he would just destroy their confidence and they wouldn’t be the same.</p>

<p>The bulls may not have the highest median level of talent overall, but you KNOW they all dawgs.</p>

<p>MJ wanted his teammates to fight back, because he wanted gritty fighters in his corner.</p>

<p>Yeah, he was an asshole.  But he wasn&rsquo;t a &lsquo;true&rsquo; bully in that normal bullies want weak, easy targets around.  MJ wanted all the mentally &lsquo;weak&rsquo; players gone so that his team would only be tough players.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not so different from being a drill sergeant.</p>

<p>Were drill sergeants and MJ complete assholes sometimes? Yup.</p>

      <label for="lc0wy9x" class="commentText"><p>They didn’t need to and still could have put on a way better performance. Our lack of a good frontcourt killed us. It was like they spent 90% of the time choosing the roster on the backcourt and were like “oh these players are so good it doesn’t even matter” then just picked a couple good frontcourt players. It was complete hubris and it showed. Even just adding like one real rim protecting center and a pf that could just play good defense, shoot decently, and actually grab rebounds instead would have probably gotten them the win.</p>

<p>I like (or liked lol) hali, he’s my favorite type of player, a huge guard that is a great facilitator so they can play pg full time and can shoot. But he just isn’t good enough at beating his man and driving inside to score or collapse the defense, which is crucial for a facilitating guard. Great playmaking becomes a lot less valuable when the defense can just hold you on the perimeter the whole time and doesn’t have to worry about drive and kicks.</p>

<p>the national TV broadcast sideline reporters like Allie Laforce, Chris Haynes, etc absolutely do go to practices for whichever game they&rsquo;re covering, and if someone doing color like mike breen, or reggie miller, or in this case, steve Kerr wanted to tag along to check out Lebron doing drills, they would absolutely be allowed in.

<p>Add Keegan Murray to the actual USA roster you cowards!! You need forwards who can shoot the 3.</p>
