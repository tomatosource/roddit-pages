He just got knee inflammation come playoff times Kawhi played 3 less games then Lebron in the regular season. People have this weird way of tainting Kawhis entire season because he missed the last two weeks. </p>

<p>Lebron for his age is UNREAL, but don’t get it twisted for his age is an important factor. </p>

<p>He’s not top 10 in the current NBA, not the best on this team, and tbh he isn’t the best player on the Lakers either.</p>

Bron has been nearly indestructible for 21 straight seasons at this point. Even when he gets hurt in his old age he always comes back for the playoffs. Never missed a playoff game. He came back from plantar fasciitis in like a month last year.</p>

<p>I’m still taking old Bron over most players in the world. There are players better than him now, but not 10. Also he’s absolutely the best player on the Lakers</p>

Lebron is great at feasting on the weak, unreal smart player as he always has been, but he isn’t that guy anymore. He isn’t on the level that he can carry you to a chip. AD is playing on another planet and they can hardly make the playoffs. </p>

      <label for="lc0b8xz" class="commentText"><p>Did I say Bron could still carry a team to a title? Yes, he’s declined from that state, but he’s still a chess master out there on the floor while everyone else is playing checkers. The only player who can beat him at chess on the floor right now is Jokic.</p>

<p>Also, if carrying a team is your standard, AD isn’t your guy lol. He’s never been able to carry a team, furthest he’s been doing that was the second round once. He’s one of those big men who need an elite playmaker to set them up, Bron is essential to AD’s success. Just look at NOLA, the one year they were good was when he had Rondo feeding him.</p>

<p>Kawhi’s knee is made of glass. If it was 2019 you’d have an argument. He hasn’t finished a playoff run since they choked in the bubble and he hasn’t played beyond the second round since 2019 (hasn’t even made the second round since 2021). Kawhi has also literally never carried a team, those Spurs teams and that Raptors team had a bunch of other talented players on them, nothing like the bums Bron has carried before lol. Not that that’s relevant to right now anyways, I’m just assuming you’re basing Kawhi on half a decade ago because he’s given us nothing the last 3 years to go on lol.</p>

      <label for="lc0c2n4" class="commentText"><p>The facts are you’re better off rolling the dice Kawhi stays healthy then taking a healthy Lebron if you want to win it all. If you just wanna be in the playoffs and see playoff games with your favorite player on them sure, but Kawhi is still top 5 when he’s on the court and can carry a team to the chip. </p>

<p>Yes I get it he’s been injured the facts are he’s still a dominant player though on both ends of the ball. Lebron obviously still has strengths HES A TOP 15-20 player IN THE NBA LOL. Do we think this type of player is chop liver? Yes I know he’s extremely smart, amazing playmaker, and when he has the energy to drive to the lane the dude still is deadly. The problem is he doesn’t play both ends effectively anymore and the players ahead of him are also absolutely dynamic as well. </p>

<p>AD has also been absolutely crazy for them. Did you seriously watch ANY lakers basketball this season? I sadly was tortured through watching probably 25 of their games because my nephew loves Lebron. AD is literally THEIR ENTIRE DEFENSE. This team would be far better without Lebron than without AD that’s just a fact. They need both to compete, but defense means sooooo much more than the casual fan wants to admit. They wanna post a stat line and think it means everything. Go ask the Suns how that worked out taking Bradley Beal on. </p>

      <label for="lc0cg55" class="commentText"><p>Statistically, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like Kawhi was better than LeBron last season. They were comparable but LeBron had the edge in most categories. LeBron was better by production and efficiency in their head-to-heads as well. He also had arguably better numbers than Durant, Edwards, and Brunson who were all on the 2nd team.</p>

<p>LeBron and Curry will likely stand out on this team because they have abilities that aren&rsquo;t really duplicated by anyone else on the team. Curry&rsquo;s still the best shooter alive and LeBron&rsquo;s basketball IQ can really only be compared to Luka and Joker. This should be such a fun team.</p>

      <label for="lc0b9e2" class="commentText"><p>Giannis, Tatum, Curry, Jokic, Kawhi, Luka, Embiid, Ant Man, Jaylen Brown, KD, AD, Brunson, SGA. You’re not removing 4 of these guys from this list, defense matters and Lebron doesn’t play much of it. He is still a smart team defender who can cover in spurts, but overall when he tries hard on D he slacks hard on O. </p>

<p>Like I said he’s still amazing for his age and he’s in the top 15-25 range you can make cases for a few others in his range like Jimmy Butler, JA when he’s playing, Booker. Outside of this it’s just too far to argue anyone else I don’t think I’ve forgotten anyone. </p>

<p>The main thing is people take this as some sort of disrespect to his career or something that he isn’t a top 5-10 player anymore. It’s weird I don’t get it. Just watch his games, watch how often he has to flop to keep their team effective. Even with a historical landslide in FT they’re still hardly competitive </p>

The only things Bron has over those two at this point in time is 1) playmaking, 2) height, 3) intelligence. Shai and Tatum both have a better 3pt shot, midrange, handles, perimeter defence, offball defence. Tatum has better interior D too. This really shouldny be a conversation, Tatum and sga at in the 2023-2024 season were undeniably more impactful players the bron</p>

      <label for="lc0dn9v" class="commentText"><p>They statistically don’t shoot better from 3 which is very easy to verify. And their teams are 10x better and actually fit them unlike the Lakers. Okc and the Celtics go just as far if you replace them Bron. Yeah he isn’t as a good as a defender as Tatum and isn’t a good of a scorer as SGA but he literally impacts the game in ways they can’t(efficiency and playmaking).</p>

      <label for="lc0bsa5" class="commentText"><p>Well said, but this is exactly the same reason why Celtics fans were so butthurt about the Tatum conversation this post season.</p>

<p>Celtics fans have Tatum at like, 3rd best, but he obviously isnt. So even if you put Tatum at as low as 6, theyll be mad at you.</p>

<p>Lebron isnt really close to top 10 and it&rsquo;s for the reasons you listed. He really just doesnt play defense at all and his team suffers for it.</p>

<p>Hell, he&rsquo;s not even the best player on his team.</p>

You might practice for a few hours that’s it. The 82 game schedule is gruelling asf practice isn’t a big part of it. When your in the league practice is not where you improve it’s the off season.</p>

<p>MJ was known to be such an intense practice player that Jerry Krause said he was reluctant to draft shooting guards. Not only would they likely never play while MJ was on the team, but MJ would just go so hard at people during routine practices he would just destroy their confidence and they wouldn’t be the same.</p>

      <label for="lc02tov" class="commentText"><p>ooh that&rsquo;s some good shieeet.</p>

<p>The bulls may not have the highest median level of talent overall, but you KNOW they all dawgs.</p>

<p>MJ wanted his teammates to fight back, because he wanted gritty fighters in his corner.</p>

<p>Yeah, he was an asshole.  But he wasn&rsquo;t a &lsquo;true&rsquo; bully in that normal bullies want weak, easy targets around.  MJ wanted all the mentally &lsquo;weak&rsquo; players gone so that his team would only be tough players.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not so different from being a drill sergeant.</p>

<p>Were drill sergeants and MJ complete assholes sometimes? Yup.</p>

<p>Did it work?</p>

<p>Hell fucking yeah.</p>

      <label for="lc05v1c" class="commentText"><p>I love the myth that MJ called Muggsey Bogues a fucking midget and it ruined him. It’s been debunked a number of times, but it’s hilarious to think about a guy who is 5’2” and was likely called a midget thousands of times in his life getting mentally crushed when it comes from Jordan.</p>

<p>the national TV broadcast sideline reporters like Allie Laforce, Chris Haynes, etc absolutely do go to practices for whichever game they&rsquo;re covering, and if someone doing color like mike breen, or reggie miller, or in this case, steve Kerr wanted to tag along to check out Lebron doing drills, they would absolutely be allowed in. The team PR heads have very active working relationships with all these people</p>

<p>Add Keegan Murray to the actual USA roster you cowards!! You need forwards who can shoot the 3.</p>
