<p>“I continue to believe there’s enormous opportunity here. It’s not something where we’ll transform a league structure in the short term. But I think that there’s an appetite among our team owners for additional investment in global basketball. We have a huge initiative in China. We have a huge initiative in Africa. Given the quality of the basketball here in Europe, it would seem to make sense that we should be doing something here as well.”</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I figured he meant. An NBA Europe equivalent to NBA Africa. Not sure how it&rsquo;d work in comparison with Europe having much more of a professional structure, but obviously there&rsquo;s <em>a lot</em> of NBA players coming out of Europe in the last 10-20 years.</p>

      <label for="lg7md98" class="commentText"><p>I think an NBA Europe league would be wildly unpopular. Europe has their own basketball culture and teams with decades of history. Panathinaikos has had a basketball team since 1919 for example.</p>

<p>One way the NBA could help is from a financial/marketing aspect, which Euroleague and FIBA are incompetent at. Maybe helping them secure a better tv rights deal or something. The NBA could also help with player development and invest in improving facilities, especially in areas where basketball hasn’t caught on as much yet.</p>

      <label for="lg6ygfu" class="commentText"><p>Idk how the NBA initiative in China works but the BAL in Africa is basically the basketball version of the UEFA Champions League. Each of the countries have their own independent national leagues with teams/clubs, and only the winning club of each country gets to participate in the BAL. So if you implemented something like that in Europe it would be the winner of the Greek league (Panathanaikos) vs the winner of the French league (AS Monaco) vs the winner of the Spanish league (Real Madrid) vs the winner of the Serbian league (Crvena zvezda) etc etc. So it would actually just run completely separately and wouldn&rsquo;t change anything for the national leagues themselves, it&rsquo;d just be this champions league which would be run by the NBA. Not sure if this kind of thing is what he was referring to but that&rsquo;s how the BAL works in Africa</p>

<p>but that already exists. it&rsquo;s called the Euroleague, and FIBA does not control it. clubs like Real Madrid and Panathinaikos own it, so NBA would need to give them something better than the incentives they already have.</p>

      <label for="lg7nzz8" class="commentText"><p>My guess is any joint venture could work in a similar fashion to how MLS teams are related to Premier League teams like NYCFC is to Man City - they are both administered by the same holding company (CFG Ltd), whose ownership is comprised of a whole bunch of billionaires, private equity firms and state-owned investment funds all over the world.</p>

<p>NYCFC and Man City operate independently in different leagues in different countries but share branding, scouting networks and sometimes use each other as feeders to exchange/develop players + share scouting networks and coaching talent. They already kinda do this in basketball to an extent but maybe they want to formalise this type of arrangement which would pave the way for truly international ownership structures.</p>

<p>Establishing a new league with FIBA would kinda fuck EuroLeague, although EuroLeague itself is sort of a FIBA coup anyway so this would be like fucking them back.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t comprehend an actual NBA team in Europe logistically. It just seems like it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense</p>

<p>Perhaps they&rsquo;re going to do more international games. Perhaps they take another section of the regular season and make it a glorified tournament that happens in Europe. Who knows.</p>

<p>Has someone who spent a lot of his life in Europe I definitely think there&rsquo;s still a lot of untapped potential for the NBA over here and I&rsquo;m all foreseen how they plan on making that a reality</p>

      <label for="lg776bw" class="commentText"><p>not going to work. Basketball has a very similar club structure to Soccer in spite of the ongoing dispute between FIBA and EuroLeague, because at least all the permanent clubs in EuroLeague still compete domestically. It&rsquo;s going to have to be a heavily sponsored FIBA European Champions League for any NBA involvement to work.</p>

<p>Another case in point in why an NBA Europe wouldn&rsquo;t work? Look at Golf - LIV is nowhere nearly as popular or respected as the PGA and World Tour in spite of paying the golfers way more than the other two. The PGA has issues but it&rsquo;s still far more prestigous than a competition that is only throwing money at it&rsquo;s athletes.</p>

<p>Soccer has another example because the Saudi League, Qatari League, Chinese Super League and even to a degree the MLS are all seen as &ldquo;Retirement Leagues&rdquo; because they are only using money to lure former big names that are clearly on the decline. Far moreso the first three examples.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t doubt for a minute clubs like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Olympiakos, Barcelona and Olympia Milano would much rather have their teams be the world&rsquo;s best (better than the top NBA teams) than be second fiddle to a league completely controlled by the NBA itself.</p>

      <label for="lg70kyt" class="commentText"><p>Americans have tried it before, offering more money to players and creating their own American-like league.</p>

<p>The problem they ran into?</p>

<p>Nobody gave a shit, why would you support a team funded entirely by rich businessmen from the other side of the world, instead of supporting your local team that has decades/centuries of history and successes</p>

      <label for="lg71g24" class="commentText"><p>lol @ you acting like the European sports leagues aren’t capitalist and the Americans are some evil rich businessman.</p>

<p>Don’t Europe franchises bend over backwards to get money from daddy Middle East?</p>

      <label for="lg72mi1" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m really sorry if my comment came off as hating on American sports, it wasn&rsquo;t my intention.</p>

<p>What I meant was that simply coming in and trying to create a new league with brand new teams and expecting it to become a major success is going to fail. There is a lot wrong with European sports (especially football and basketball) and American involvement is not an inherently bad thing. I just think that if the NBA wants to invest in Europe it would be better to do so through the existing organisations and teams (ideally finally ending the FIBA vs Euroleague split). That&rsquo;s all</p>

      <label for="lg748ei" class="commentText"><p>That’s completely fair. My point is I’d just like to see the best competition in the world face each other.</p>

<p>And I’d love for American teams to face European teams similar to how in European football, there is a global competition.</p>

      <label for="lg7vfhp" class="commentText"><p>dont know how they&rsquo;d handle the interests of the EuroLeague clubs with a high level competition in Europe but if the NBA wanted to have a bigger initiative in Brazil the folks at NBB would welcome them with open arms, legs and asscheeks</p>
