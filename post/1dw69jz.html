      <label for="lbsixnr" class="commentText"><p>Hey Magic fans, curious to learn more about his progression arch. Did Franz start in year 1?  What was his impact in year 1-2 vs 3? What has he developed over the last few years?</p>

<p>I‚Äôve seen him play, I like his game. But would like to learn more from someone who follows the team day to day.</p>

      <label for="lbsmfgd" class="commentText"><p>Yep he‚Äôs been starting since Day 1, was genuinely really really damn good his rookie year to the point lots of magic fans were actually disgusted he wasn‚Äôt top 3 in ROY voting</p>

<p>Year 2 was honestly more of the same, his first year playing with paolo and they both showed they can not only fit together but thrive together</p>

<p>Year 3 was kind of up and down, I think year 3 was his best defensive year but his shot making just wasn‚Äôt up to par from his first two years. A lot of that is his playing and winning the World Cup during the summer and not really have an offseason to rest, and re-accruing ankle injury that kind of slowed him down.</p>

      <label for="lbsnmc6" class="commentText"><p>1st year there wasn‚Äôt huge expectations despite the fact he was a lottery pick in the 2021 draft. I think a lot of this came from the fact that we picked Suggs 4 that year or because Franz was a very unsexy pick. Regardless, he struggled a bit at summer league and some people were already getting nervous about the pick. Come the 1st season he started every game he played and put up very solid numbers for a rookie. 15 pts, 47% FG, 35% 3 on 3 3PA a game. You could tell early that year he had a real craft around the basket and a way better handle and better vision than people realized going into the draft. Following year put up similar efficiency on 19 PPG and upping his free throw attempts and assist. I think by the middle of the 2nd season most Magic fans knew he was going to be a long term piece. This third season he seemed to really up his defense motor and got even better around the basket but had a big slump from 3 dropping from 35-36% to 28%. One theory is he had a nagging injury preventing him from shooting with his natural jump shot form. You could tell his shot was much flatter for some reason. Had a good playoff series at home this year but really struggled away. Overall I think most Magic fans are very optimistic he becomes a legit 2nd or 3rd best player on a championship team.</p>

      <label for="lbsmj2z" class="commentText"><p>I‚Äôm actually both a Michigan and Magic fan so I‚Äôve watched him a lot. He‚Äôs always started for both (His 1st Magic team was not good) and he‚Äôs always been good to great. Very high levels of consistency. It‚Äôs why he typically doesn‚Äôt blow up for 40-50 points but he won‚Äôt completely shit the bed (except on rare occasions). My only problems with him were his 3 ball disappeared last year and he‚Äôs been awful when the team needs him most (2021 E8 vs UCLA and 2024 G7 vs Cleveland) where he went a respective 2-16 and 1-15.</p>

      <label for="lbswfmo" class="commentText"><p>He did start year 1. In his first year, we were a very young team that had just moved Vuc, AG and Fournier and there were really no expectations for the team. I was expecting to see a lot from Suggs since he was drafted like four picks in front of Franz, but Franz had a better than expected rookie year by playing his beautiful European game, which includes carving up the other team&rsquo;s entire defense by euro-stepping his way through the paint AND hitting open shots. That&rsquo;s key because year 2, he was largely the same in our first year with Paolo but then last year, he went from shooting 36% from 3 in his first two seasons to 28%. He did get hurt, but even before he sprained his right ankle about a third of the way into the season, he was shooting about 30% from 3. Now, we did make the playoffs which is what matters, and he had some good games and some bad.</p>

<p>Someone can probably go more in depth about how he has developed over his career, but he&rsquo;s always been shifty enough to find open space and get a good look. I think he&rsquo;ll keep growing into a championship player for us, but every summer, he&rsquo;s playing German basketball which can&rsquo;t be sustainable for his legs in the long-term to be playing that much basketball in a row, but also that&rsquo;s less individual time to work on your game. All in all, the whole team is going to keep improving together and I think Franz can be our second-best player on a championship team.</p>

<p>I spoke facts, in nba terms not including that the money is insane ever since gambling got introduced, there has to be a middle ground between the max and role player. Wings be getting every premium.</p>

      <label for="lbsjbif" class="commentText"><p>Of course you gave up on your bummy ass team üíÄ</p>

<p>Also, Franz is not a role player. Did he have a down year when it comes to shooting from the 3? Yes, but he‚Äôs still young and could bounce back. He also improved in other areas such as rim scoring and defense, which are very important things to have on this Magic team.</p>

<p>These are still ifs and I get it especially as a wing he&rsquo;s extremely valuable wings are hard to find that are good, but that money is just still insane with an entire down year, development is never promised.</p>
