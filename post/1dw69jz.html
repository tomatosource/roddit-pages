<p>I‚Äôve seen him play, I like his game. But would like to learn more from someone who follows the team day to day.</p>

      <label for="lbsmfgd" class="commentText"><p>Yep he‚Äôs been starting since Day 1, was genuinely really really damn good his rookie year to the point lots of magic fans were actually disgusted he wasn‚Äôt top 3 in ROY voting</p>

<p>Year 2 was honestly more of the same, his first year playing with paolo and they both showed they can not only fit together but thrive together</p>

<p>Year 3 was kind of up and down, I think year 3 was his best defensive year but his shot making just wasn‚Äôt up to par from his first two years. A lot of that is his playing and winning the World Cup during the summer and not really have an offseason to rest, and re-accruing ankle injury that kind of slowed him down.</p>

      <label for="lbsmj2z" class="commentText"><p>I‚Äôm actually both a Michigan and Magic fan so I‚Äôve watched him a lot. He‚Äôs always started for both (His 1st Magic team was not good) and he‚Äôs always been good to great. Very high levels of consistency. It‚Äôs why he typically doesn‚Äôt blow up for 40-50 points but he won‚Äôt completely shit the bed (except on rare occasions). My only problems with him were his 3 ball disappeared last year and he‚Äôs been awful when the team needs him most (2021 E8 vs UCLA and 2024 G7 vs Cleveland) where he went a respective 2-16 and 1-15.</p>

      <label for="lbsnmc6" class="commentText"><p>1st year there wasn‚Äôt huge expectations despite the fact he was a lottery pick in the 2021 draft. I think a lot of this came from the fact that we picked Suggs 4 that year or because Franz was a very unsexy pick. Regardless, he struggled a bit at summer league and some people were already getting nervous about the pick. Come the 1st season he started every game he played and put up very solid numbers for a rookie. 15 pts, 47% FG, 35% 3 on 3 3PA a game. You could tell early that year he had a real craft around the basket and a way better handle and better vision than people realized going into the draft. Following year put up similar efficiency on 19 PPG and upping his free throw attempts and assist. I think by the middle of the 2nd season most Magic fans knew he was going to be a long term piece. This third season he seemed to really up his defense motor and got even better around the basket but had a big slump from 3 dropping from 35-36% to 28%. One theory is he had a nagging injury preventing him from shooting with his natural jump shot form. You could tell his shot was much flatter for some reason. Had a good playoff series at home this year but really struggled away. Overall I think most Magic fans are very optimistic he becomes a legit 2nd or 3rd best player on a championship team.</p>
