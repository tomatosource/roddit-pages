<p>Brad Stevens was hired as head coach almost right after KG and Pierce were traded and coached for 8 seasons. The Celtics were only in the lottery once and followed it up with 7 appearances in the playoffs. Brad then transitioned to GM and in those 3 seasons, the Celtics won 9 playoff series and a championship.</p>

Heat hate trading “their” guys unless it’s for super stars, while the Celtics focus on getting better every offseason. That’s why they have a ring now and Riley still hasn’t fucked off to Malibu</p>

      <label for="l9bh322" class="commentText"><p>The Heats literal biggest problem is Spo.</p>

<p>Because he&rsquo;s so good that he kept tricking Pat Riley into thinking he could win with Jimmy/Herro/Bam as his core. Meanwhile all 3 of the other consistent East contenders: Boston, Philly and Milwaukee have all made big moves or trades to try to get over the hump (KP, Jrue, Harden and Dame).</p>

      <label for="l9bjc89" class="commentText"><p>I think the Heat wanted a ring with developed guys and thought the power of friendship was enough, but they haven’t been healthy during any of their runs and it’s their fault because they’re relying on injury prone guys to take them all the way. The Celtics would’ve probably traded Herro after the bubble finals at peak value to get a better player, the heat rather keep him and then over pay him to stay here.</p>

<p>Really as far as the roster and decisions the FO have made, it’s been awful. Heat have been good in spite of their FO by developing G league guys and Spo being amazing. Right now Rozier, Herro, Duncan make up 50% of the cap, they’re all guards who are inefficient and can’t defend. Can’t play them at the same time on the court and they take up 50% of the cap, that’s just inexcusable, it’s flat out terrible roster construction.</p>

<p>That’s why it doesn’t matter if we get a “star” this summer, not like we would anyway. But you need to move 2 of Herro/Rozier/Duncan to have a functioning team. How do you move those guys now and for what? That’s the work they have to do and I’ll bet anything they’ll use the injury excuse and run it back again</p>

      <label for="l9bcqpd" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve said for a while - Stevens is happy to hit singles and doubles.  Pretty much every trade he&rsquo;s made has seemed (at the time it happened at least) as a win-win.  He&rsquo;s not sitting there waiting for some home run fleece.  Of course, part of that is because he had his foundation from the start, but part of it is philosophical, I think.</p>

      <label for="l9b76c1" class="commentText"><p>You just need to have the foundation set, Celtics didn’t want Smart being the culture leader, they wanted Brown and Tatum to be the foundation. They then got players to build around them and make up for their weaknesses by getting rid of “culture” guys. In the Heat’s case, obviously you keep Bam as the torch bearer of “culture” but when you’re reluctant to move Duncan Robinson, Herro, Martin, Highsmith, Jovic, etc unless it’s for a super star you’re not going to get better. You can’t just keep the whole team because you like those guys, have to always focus on getting better.</p>

<p>Obviously trading for KP and Jrue is huge, but the Mavs trading for PJ and Gafford got them to the finals. You have to make moves to get better around the margins sometimes to have better synergy than just going for a top 15 player and hoping a depleted team with 2-3 top 20 guys can you win something. Just hasn’t been the way to win recently</p>

      <label for="l9bf6x2" class="commentText"><p>Your last paragraph is a really good and important point. Because part of the reason Celtics could get KP and Jrue is because we are just loaded with assets and have the depth to compensate for sending out quality players. IMO Heat would struggle to land as big fish as KP and Jrue without sacrificing enough depth to make it questionable, or more questionable then for the C&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>They could however have easily made PJ and Gafford type moves and gotten better around the margins like you said.  And the Heat had more actual evidence then the Mavs that they were contenders at the deadline of this year, yall just went to finals. I&rsquo;d feel the same frustration you do for sure.</p>

KP wasn’t going to demand a lot in a trade because he was injury prone and making a shit ton of money in his last season before becoming a FA.

You guys gave up Smart and got 2FRPs and KP, he wasn’t even headlining that trade it was Smart. The media hype drove his value sky high because that’s just an incredible fleece. And not every team is willing to pay the tax, Miami didn’t want KP, Beal, many others because of tax. They only want to pay tax for a super team, which will never happen</p>

      <label for="l9bfdwj" class="commentText"><p>This feels like it&rsquo;s suffering from a bit of confirmation bias, Brad took a very big risk and got lucky it panned out. There&rsquo;s more futures where KP&rsquo;s body doesn&rsquo;t hold it together for the playoffs, Jrue&rsquo;s actually washed, and every team the Celtics are up against doesn&rsquo;t suffer injuries to their best players.</p>

<p>Heat have overachieved making it to the finals twice in the last 5 years, having a 5 year stretch where in 2 years you made it to the biggest stage and then. Y&rsquo;all ran into the GOAT, the best teams from the 2 best centers of this generation, and stacked Celtics rosters. Health was never in y&rsquo;alls favor in any of these series.</p>

<p>Not winning it all is always going to be seen as a failure but like this 5 years stretch is better than 95% of 5 years stretches for sports teams in existence.</p>

      <label for="l9bgqyo" class="commentText"><p>I’m not saying that our last 5 years were a failure and I’d much rather be memed for having lost in the finals than never making the playoffs. It’s the fact you had that team go that far twice in 5 years and the big moves you make to reinforce the team were 36 year old Lowry and this season a trade for Rozier. Now we have 3 players on our roster, that take up 50% of the cap and can’t see the court together. I’m sorry that’s just bad roster construction and us making the finals was because of Spo, Jimmy, and Bam.</p>

<p>You have to make risky moves to win, our moves were even riskier and made no sense. Celtics lose in 22 and get White for peanuts. They lose last year and get KP and Jrue, they made moves to make their roster deeper and better, Heat made moves to not pay tax</p>

      <label for="l9b6dwi" class="commentText"><p>He could definitely guard Porzingis before his Wizards&rsquo; stint (and a lot of other 5s without good post skills), but he was a liability on true post players (and nowadays Porzingis wouldn&rsquo;t try to muscle him but just shoot over the top comfortably). Timelord was definitely the better and more impactful defender, though.</p>

      <label for="l9b7wr7" class="commentText"><p>A liability? Maybe on a bunch of possessions in a row but I watched Smart lock up Embiid and Giannis plenty of times in the playoffs. Part of why Timelord as the free safety worked so well is because Smart could switch onto bigs in the post so Williams wouldn’t get bullied.</p>

      <label for="l9bb8ha" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, but he didn&rsquo;t. He used to try to get better positioning and ended up off balance and off rhythm. Nowadays he faces up on the catch and shoots without putting the ball on the floor (or will kick back out for a repost).</p>

<p>It used to be really easy to throw him off his post game and Marcus Smart (and other defenders) would do it rather effectively.</p>

<p>All five winners only have one title but they’re the only one to make more than one Finals. Four ECFs as well, compared to Denver/LA’s two WCFs. And the best winning percentage besides Milwaukee, with better playoff success to put them over.</p>

      <label for="l9b57cz" class="commentText"><p>It’s cause the East was weak and their record didn’t reflect how good they were. People think “64 wins in a weak conference means they got to steal wins and their record is inflated”. It more likely meant they got to sleepwalk through half of the season because of an insurmountable lead in the standings. Advanced stats puts this Celtics squad up there with 72 and 73 win bulls and warriors.</p>

<p>If they kept their foot on the gas, I don’t think 70 wins was out of the question.</p>

<p>I had hope my team could pull it off and never gave up on my team, but Celtics were going to win against anyone. Probably not as handily as they beat the Mavs, but they literally have no defensive weaknesses and their entire rotation can score</p>

<p>Denver had Bruce Brown last year which is a big deal, but over a 7-game series I think it’s a toss up. Jokic is tougher to deal with than Luka just from a matchup perspective, but while we’re playing hypotheticals, we didn’t have Porzingis for half this playoff run either.</p>

<p>It’s hard to say in hypotheticals because you can look at it on paper and people’s predictions are wrong all the time, but I think the teams are pretty equal in their performance that either team in 6 or 7 doesn’t feel like a bad pick</p>

      <label for="l9bk5px" class="commentText"><p>KP&rsquo;s injury was not ignored&hellip;it was a huge story&hellip;I know you were responding to something separate (which I also agree with about the East)</p>

<p>but two things can be true here - the Celtics, and this is a credit to their FO, built a team with a lot of depth that can space/spread the floor in pretty much all areas&hellip;due to that depth, and some minor injuries here and there during the season, they had already prepared themselves to play without KP, who was their 3rd option offensively (granted, you had nights where White got his points too; some others had big games in the postseason)&hellip;I forget how many games they played/won without KP in the regular season</p>

<p>other teams were not prepared to lose their 1st and/or 2nd options and surviving though&hellip;because of all of that, it turned out you guys did not actually need KP for this specific playoff run, as his absence was largely negated (I believe this is an objective thought)&hellip;if all teams were healthier in the most critical of areas, then you almost certainly would have</p>

<p>If you remember the incident, he stated something that was tone deaf. And he had to leave or otherwise face scrutiny/team faces scrutiny</p>

<p>But he was the one who drafted the Jays. He recruited and hired Brad Stevens.  He does deserve a ring imo.</p>
