<p>Brad Stevens was hired as head coach almost right after KG and Pierce were traded and coached for 8 seasons. The Celtics were only in the lottery once and followed it up with 7 appearances in the playoffs. Brad then transitioned to GM and in those 3 seasons, the Celtics won 9 playoff series and a championship.</p>

<p>Brad came to the Celtics to coach a rebuilding roster where he refused to tank, but only put up <em>one</em> 25-win season (the only non-playoffs season) before a 40-42 season. Those were his only sub-.500 seasons. <strong>SIX</strong> ECF appearances.</p>

Now he&rsquo;s crafted potentially one of the most versatile and defensively sound back courts in the modern NBA, with two strong 6&rsquo;4 guards who can both shoot, create, drive, temporarily switch onto bigs, play hounding defense, crash the boards, and in White&rsquo;s case, block shots</p>

<p>Because he&rsquo;s so good that he kept tricking Pat Riley into thinking he could win with Jimmy/Herro/Bam as his core. Meanwhile all 3 of the other consistent East contenders: Boston, Philly and Milwaukee have all made big moves or trades to try to get over the hump (KP, Jrue, Harden and Dame).</p>

      <label for="l9bjc89" class="commentText"><p>I think the Heat wanted a ring with developed guys and thought the power of friendship was enough, but they haven’t been healthy during any of their runs and it’s their fault because they’re relying on injury prone guys to take them all the way. The Celtics would’ve probably traded Herro after the bubble finals at peak value to get a better player, the heat rather keep him and then over pay him to stay here.</p>

<p>Really as far as the roster and decisions the FO have made, it’s been awful. Heat have been good in spite of their FO by developing G league guys and Spo being amazing. Right now Rozier, Herro, Duncan make up 50% of the cap, they’re all guards who are inefficient and can’t defend. Can’t play them at the same time on the court and they take up 50% of the cap, that’s just inexcusable, it’s flat out terrible roster construction.</p>

<p>That’s why it doesn’t matter if we get a “star” this summer, not like we would anyway. But you need to move 2 of Herro/Rozier/Duncan to have a functioning team. How do you move those guys now and for what? That’s the work they have to do and I’ll bet anything they’ll use the injury excuse and run it back again</p>

<p>Problem is that you often had some bad health luck and the times you got to the finals you played very healthy teams led by All-time greats.</p>

<p>The downside of having the Celtics and Heat go to war for 7 games almost every year is that we ended up too battered to win the chip.</p>

<p>That said, I do think Riley has been way too willing to just stand pat year after year.</p>

      <label for="l9cn2sb" class="commentText"><p>I think really the best chances were 22, because we had a good team that year and 2020. 2020 everyone says we would’ve lost anyway, which is easy to say because we lost. We missed Dragic and Bam played hobbled and was a shell of himself. Jimmy was going toe to toe with Lebron before running out of gas. The warriors would’ve been tough in 22 and the 7 game series probably fucked us anyway, but those are the 2 years I think we had a shot. Last year, as long as it was the nuggets there was no way, just we are historically, a terrible team against them.</p>

<p>I’m mad that we didn’t win, but I’m still proud of the team and love the years we had. Last year playoff run was amazing and the bubble run was great too. 2022 was a year where we finally were the first seed and made it to within one shot of the Finals. When Jimmy left to Miami people thought it was to retire because the Heat were in such a dire state, but he helped prop up the franchise and led it to one of its most prosperous eras even if we didn’t get a win. He’s won a ton of playoff games and had legendary battles, sometimes it just doesn’t end the way you want it to</p>

      <label for="l9diip1" class="commentText"><p>We are allergic to putting a PF taller than 6’5 next to Bam, it’s insane the lengths we’d go to not add size. We started playing better once Jovic played next to Bam and a lot of that is because he’s got size. Size impacts more than just rebounding, size makes getting to the paint harder, size gives you versatility defensively. Unfortunately the Heat only want to get bigs that no one else wants. We signed Bryant who couldn’t see the floor for the champs when we played against them but thought he could be a back up big for Bam? Bam has had Zeller, Dedmon, Bryant, as his backups. His best PF guys have been PJ Tucker and Jae Crowder, like the roster is just ass man. Spo is a fucking wizard</p>

Jimmy is a great player, and he deserves tremendous props for what he was able to do in 2020 and 2023, but talent-wise he’s simply not good enough to be the best player on a championship team.</p>

      <label for="l9c9ljs" class="commentText"><p>Idk if I agree with him not being good enough, I think he is good enough but he went up against much better teams. In 2020 we were missing <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of our best players so of course that one was always likely we’d lose. But they never really built around him sufficiently, and so he has to turn to Jordan to beat teams. Like Jimmy averaged 37ppg to beat the best team in the regular season on the road in 5 games. He’s one of like 3 players to have a 30pt triple double in the finals. He’s not at fault here, he’s done everything a tier 1 superstar could do, he just doesn’t have the rest of the roster to back him up.</p>

<p>I mean the Heat are competing and making the finals with more undrafted players than any other team in history. We don’t even have actual NBA rotation players. Jimmy and Spo are using black magic to even get as far as they have.</p>

      <label for="l9c4erv" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think Portland fared much better honestly but it’s disingenuous to say because Portland was offered a shittier deal than what was getting memed all of last summer. They were never offered Herro, Jovic, Jaquez, Martin and 3 FRPs. They were offered Lowry, Robinson, and a first, got insulted and then never picked up the phone again.</p>

<p>Who those guys move for im not sure, they should look to make moves for players who are close to running out their contracts and maybe see what happens. Value players are had all the time without having to move stars. Gafford was moved for richaun Holmes and a protected first. PJ was moved for a first and Grant Williams. Like you just can’t be attaching picks to get rid of KZ Okpala and Dwayne Dedmon.</p>

<p>Robinson is an expiring deal and he’s a good shooter, Rozier isn’t making a ton of money and is a solid scorer. There are teams that can benefit from any of those 2. Herro still has value even if it’s at an all time low now, because he’s 23 years old and won a 6MOTY. Jaquez and Jovic are good young pieces to develop as well, like Miami has assets they just never want to move them</p>

Pretty much every trade he&rsquo;s made has seemed (at the time it happened at least) as a win-win.  He&rsquo;s not sitting there waiting for some home run fleece.  Of course, part of that is because he had his foundation from the start, but part of it is philosophical, I think.</p>

      <label for="l9b76c1" class="commentText"><p>You just need to have the foundation set, Celtics didn’t want Smart being the culture leader, they wanted Brown and Tatum to be the foundation. They then got players to build around them and make up for their weaknesses by getting rid of “culture” guys. In the Heat’s case, obviously you keep Bam as the torch bearer of “culture” but when you’re reluctant to move Duncan Robinson, Herro, Martin, Highsmith, Jovic, etc unless it’s for a super star you’re not going to get better. You can’t just keep the whole team because you like those guys, have to always focus on getting better.</p>

<p>Obviously trading for KP and Jrue is huge, but the Mavs trading for PJ and Gafford got them to the finals. You have to make moves to get better around the margins sometimes to have better synergy than just going for a top 15 player and hoping a depleted team with 2-3 top 20 guys can you win something. Just hasn’t been the way to win recently</p>

      <label for="l9bf6x2" class="commentText"><p>Your last paragraph is a really good and important point. Because part of the reason Celtics could get KP and Jrue is because we are just loaded with assets and have the depth to compensate for sending out quality players. IMO Heat would struggle to land as big fish as KP and Jrue without sacrificing enough depth to make it questionable, or more questionable then for the C&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>They could however have easily made PJ and Gafford type moves and gotten better around the margins like you said.  And the Heat had more actual evidence then the Mavs that they were contenders at the deadline of this year, yall just went to finals. I&rsquo;d feel the same frustration you do for sure.</p>

We just didn’t want to pay the tax, that whole NTC thing was what local media was running with because we’d have “no flexibility” and because they thought Miami wanted Dame more.</p>

<p>Not saying that deal would’ve worked out better for us or not, but it’s fairly obvious the Heat make moves with tax in mind. This would be the first time they pay tax in the Jimmy era and like the 3rd time overall since that was a thing. The bucks paid more in tax just last year than we have in our franchise’s history.</p>

<p>I agree with the general point, but I really don&rsquo;t think this was the case. The Smart for KP trade was the backup plan after a similar one sending Brogdon to LA stalled. If Brad was going into the offseason looking to trade Smart, the trade that accomplished that and netted an extra pick or two would have been plan A. It probably doesn&rsquo;t matter a whole lot because there&rsquo;s a pretty good chance that Marcus gets traded anyway when Jrue becomes available, but it really looks like brad kind of went out of his way to try to keep him.</p>

      <label for="l9bfdwj" class="commentText"><p>This feels like it&rsquo;s suffering from a bit of confirmation bias, Brad took a very big risk and got lucky it panned out. There&rsquo;s more futures where KP&rsquo;s body doesn&rsquo;t hold it together for the playoffs, Jrue&rsquo;s actually washed, and every team the Celtics are up against doesn&rsquo;t suffer injuries to their best players.</p>

<p>Heat have overachieved making it to the finals twice in the last 5 years, having a 5 year stretch where in 2 years you made it to the biggest stage and then. Y&rsquo;all ran into the GOAT, the best teams from the 2 best centers of this generation, and stacked Celtics rosters. Health was never in y&rsquo;alls favor in any of these series.</p>

<p>Not winning it all is always going to be seen as a failure but like this 5 years stretch is better than 95% of 5 years stretches for sports teams in existence.</p>

      <label for="l9bgqyo" class="commentText"><p>I’m not saying that our last 5 years were a failure and I’d much rather be memed for having lost in the finals than never making the playoffs. It’s the fact you had that team go that far twice in 5 years and the big moves you make to reinforce the team were 36 year old Lowry and this season a trade for Rozier. Now we have 3 players on our roster, that take up 50% of the cap and can’t see the court together. I’m sorry that’s just bad roster construction and us making the finals was because of Spo, Jimmy, and Bam.</p>

<p>You have to make risky moves to win, our moves were even riskier and made no sense. Celtics lose in 22 and get White for peanuts. They lose last year and get KP and Jrue, they made moves to make their roster deeper and better, Heat made moves to not pay tax</p>

      <label for="l9bven1" class="commentText"><p>The roster construction was good though when you had late draft picks and two way guys getting you to the finals multiple times, it has to go both ways. You can&rsquo;t just look at the result and be like &ldquo;Riley bad&rdquo;, your teams had no business getting to the finals in the years it did but the coaching and roster construction made it happen.</p>

<p>The Celtics on the other hand had a treasure trove of talent and assets gifted to them by the Nets, they had a team that was #1 in the standings that then went on to get multiple #3 top draft picks and had a DPOY that they could trade. On top of that every single team in this year&rsquo;s title run that they went up against except the Mavs had injuries to their main star causing them to miss games. If anything, the Celtics are probably underperforming only winning one in the last 7 years, but that&rsquo;s a whole other conversation. You need a depth of assets to be able to make marginal improvements, it&rsquo;s not possible to just snake oil your way to a better roster and Riley&rsquo;s tried this anyway trying to trade players like Robinson and Herro.</p>

<p>Heat just don&rsquo;t have those assets, y&rsquo;all just won <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> and then had an incredibly short rebuild and we&rsquo;re back in title contention. It&rsquo;s fine to want more, but expecting more is a bit unrealistic.</p>

      <label for="l9c2xuh" class="commentText"><p>The roster construction has been a criticism throughout the entire Jimmy era. It was never good, that’s why I said they went that far in spite of the front office. The Heat don’t try to trade Robinson or Herro. Herro wasn’t even offered for Dame, Robinson was only offered for super stars.</p>

<p>The heat have to attach picks to get rid of contracts and still have assets that are worth something. Especially a Jaquez, Jovic, Robinson, Herro, all could be moved. Any of those guys would’ve brought back a KP, you didn’t really have to givd up major assets to rebuild your team. You can say Smart, he was extremely overvalued and that was just a fleece. Guy was traded as the main piece for Porzingis, got 2 FRPs back for him and KP. That’s just a terrible fucking move but what are the Celtics going to do say no?</p>

<p>So the roster was never it, it’s had the same issues since that 2020 year and they never really tried fixing them. They tried getting cheap vets and Lowry who they had to trade for when he was a FA and was 36. If they would’ve moved those guys for better pieces to surround Jimmy and Bam sure, but they’ve made dumbass moves. They’ve been making dumbass moves since Wade left. At least since they’ve become better at drafting</p>

I think you’re forgetting that originally Smart wasn’t even gonna be traded, the original KP deal had us keeping Smart and sending Brogdon to the Clippers. Smart only ended up getting traded <em>after</em> the Clippers pulled out because of Brogdon’s physicals.</p>

<p>I really don’t think it’s as deep as you’re making it out to be. I think it just came down to, Brad viewed KP and (at the time) one of Brogdon or Smart as being more impactful than having Brogdon <em>and</em> Smart with no KP.</p>

      <label for="l9c11ei" class="commentText"><p>I don’t understand how timelord n brogdon became Jrue . I thought it was a shitty deal at the time and only ok cos of Jrue retirement talk . Two late frps n 2 guys who are never healthy n playing or worth anything . If Portland waited I could see teams offering more for Jrue by deadline . Teams were offering that kinda package for Caruso or dejounte who’s inferior to Jrue . It’s still wild to me but blazers are a shitty franchise so , plus they might actually have been spiting dame even tho they never tried to build around him  n go all in.</p>

Timelord was definitely the better and more impactful defender, though.</p>

<p>It used to be really easy to throw him off his post game and Marcus Smart (and other defenders) would do it rather effectively.</p>

      <label for="l9b57cz" class="commentText"><p>It’s cause the East was weak and their record didn’t reflect how good they were. People think “64 wins in a weak conference means they got to steal wins and their record is inflated”. It more likely meant they got to sleepwalk through half of the season because of an insurmountable lead in the standings. Advanced stats puts this Celtics squad up there with 72 and 73 win bulls and warriors.</p>

<p>If they kept their foot on the gas, I don’t think 70 wins was out of the question.</p>

<p>I had hope my team could pull it off and never gave up on my team, but Celtics were going to win against anyone. Probably not as handily as they beat the Mavs, but they literally have no defensive weaknesses and their entire rotation can score</p>

Someone in our subreddit said we finished like that on the season but I wasn&rsquo;t able to quickly confirm it, but was able to confirm at least as of March that was indeed the case. Which is absolutely insane.</p>

<p>Dont get me wrong, Celtics still win, but acting like they played the same level of team as the West did is crazy. The only player that brought his A game to the finals was Luka and even he had some duds.</p>

<p>God why do you even watch basketball. They looked cooked because Celtics took away lobs and corner 3s which is where they were eating against the Clippers, Wolves etc.</p>

<p>Their 3s were contested because Celtics refused to blitz Luka/Kyrie like every other team before them did allowing them to stay home on the shooters.</p>

<p>Your “analysis” isnt worth the 30 seconds it took to type out. Basketball players dont magically become shit.</p>

<p>Basketball players do absolutely become shit, aka theyre playing hot, rest for 7 games, and come back different. It&rsquo;s also a make or miss league, these guys missed.</p>

<p>Honestly, it&rsquo;s just a dickriding sub right not because all non-Celtics fans are gone.</p>

<p>And I watch basketball for the competition. This year there was basically none in the playoffs. The Celtics didnt play a single healthy team besides the Mavs, and the western teams choked for various reasons (inexperience, etc). </p>

<p>Overall, bad year for basketball, and the numbers show it. </p>

But they also lost very VERY few games vs scrub squads which was also a huge difference to past years. This year felt much more about just building and executing a gameplan that would take you all the way through a Finals run and not making statements or fitting narratives or regular season award bait.</p>

<p>In a series against the Celtics theyd have the best player, which is usually how it goes down as well.</p>

<p>They also actually faced real competition in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Not sure why a Bucks fan is dickriding the Celtics. I also think the Championship Bucks team probably beats this years Celtics.</p>

      <label for="l9cc0bw" class="commentText"><p>Lol 3 play in teams? You mean between last year and this year?</p>

<p>The Nuggets beat two all timers and a team that was on a run heading into the playoffs.</p>

<p>The Celtics didnt beat a single team with a healthy roster besides the Mavs, who were hitting above their average all the way to the finals.</p>

<p>Luka was probably the best player in the series but he played by himself, nobody else showed up.</p>

<p>What about your 2022 champion Bucks?? Why you ignoring that part? I question your fandom. Me personally? 2022 bucks beat the 2024 celtics in 7 games, probably in 6.</p>

<li><p>The stars of Boston aren’t particularly beloved. Tatum is seen as very inauthentic and Brown has a checkered history that reddit loves to hound on.</p></li>

<li><p>When Boston lost they <em>LOST</em> really badly and ugly. Meanwhile they had a number of wins that were more their opponents shooting themselves in the foot (Indiana series for example).</p></li>

<li><p>Boston had been expected to compete and win a title for a few years and it feels more like a <em>finally</em> than a <em>they did it!</em></p></li>

<p>Denver had Bruce Brown last year which is a big deal, but over a 7-game series I think it’s a toss up. Jokic is tougher to deal with than Luka just from a matchup perspective, but while we’re playing hypotheticals, we didn’t have Porzingis for half this playoff run either.</p>

<p>It’s hard to say in hypotheticals because you can look at it on paper and people’s predictions are wrong all the time, but I think the teams are pretty equal in their performance that either team in 6 or 7 doesn’t feel like a bad pick</p>

      <label for="l9bkpm8" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, the Celtics easily deserved this championship more than any team in the league over that timespan. I remember when the Rockets were competitive with Harden and those Celtics teams were always a pain in the ass, with Tatum, Brown, and Smart. It&rsquo;s crazy to think how long ago that was. The fact that it&rsquo;s essentially the same core (sans Smart), makes it even better.</p>

The team had a .500 record in 2021, the Kemba signing was proving to be a disaster, and they got annhilated in round one against the Nets with a disgusting line-up around JT (JB was injured). Things could have gone downhill really quick from there, but they managed to recover.</p>
