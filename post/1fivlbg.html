</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I was reading through old newspaper story from 1958 which explained that the night before the Game 6 of the 1958 NBA Championships (11 April 1958) the following happened:</p>

<p><em>The magazine, Sports Illustrated, has a  written story on basketball star Bill Russell of the Boston Celtics and the stark prejudice of his downtown restaurants. The article, which does not contain one word of preachment, tells how Bill Russell was injured in the third game of the championship basketball playoffs, which had as opponents the Celtics and your St. Louis Hawks. On the night before the 6th game here in St. Louis, Celtic coach Red Auerbach and teammates Bob Cousy and Tom Heinsohn were sitting in the lobby of the Hotel Jefferson, when Bill Russell limped in.</em></p>

<p><em>His teammates were surprised to see him, because Russell had been ordered to stay home and rest his injured ankle. But the lanky basketball star couldn&rsquo;t stay away from the game. He told Coach Auerbach, &ldquo;I didn’t come here to watch the game, I came here to play.&rdquo; The coach didn’t argue with his fighting spirit. He invited Bill Russell to go with the rest of them across the street to an all-night cafeteria. When they got their trays and stood in line, the counterman looked at Russell and said he wouldn&rsquo;t serve Bill.&rdquo; They went around the corner from the hotel to a greasy hamburger joint, and were again rebuffed. The team mates went back to the hotel hungry.</em></p>

<p>Three years later on the 11th April 1961, Bill delivered one of his greatest performances in Game 5 of the 1961 NBA finals against the St Louis Hawks. Russell scored 30 points, got 38 Rebounds and blocked 8 shots to win the NBA Championship.</p>

<p>I found this story interesting a given that it was exactly three years later to the prior event.</p>

      <label for="lnk1e1h" class="commentText"><p>Russell and his colleagues went through some truly heinous shit in their days. People always say the Big O was a surly character, well no shit given the stuff that he had to hear and see. Not everyone can weather the storm like a Bill Russell, he was one of one. That kind of racism is bound to affect you.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying that it didn&rsquo;t impact Bill Russell either. I know he battled his feelings for Boston versus the accomplishments he achieved in the city his entire life. It&rsquo;s just that he was such a graceful man that he always appeared so calm and poised in public.</p>

      <label for="lnkmedc" class="commentText"><p>He converted to Islam and boycotted the summer Olympics to protest the treatment of black people before he&rsquo;d made one dime in the NBA. I&rsquo;ve always admired how he didn&rsquo;t hedge his bets over his principles like that, in a time and climate so against that. </p>

<p>Ahmad Rashaad is another that comes to mind. He&rsquo;d only had one promising NFL season before converting, and the Cardinals dumped their all rookie wide receiver for terrible value because he wouldn&rsquo;t respond to his old name. He had a few years being ignored in Buffalo and was considered a headcase in the media, with him changing his name being the only thing anyone had to point to. </p>

<p>He turned his career around and made 4 pro bowls with the Vikings, and he says that when he first met Bud Grant, coach Grant started the conversation with, &ldquo;Hello Ahmad&rdquo;, and it was all Ahmad could do to not burst into tears.</p>

<p>Hmm according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/737390/number-of-hate-crime-incidents-in-the-us-by-motivation/" target="_blank">here</a> there were 3421 anti black hate crimes in the USA in 2022.</p>

<p>Which is less than 10 per day for the whole country.</p>

<p>I would have thought by the news it would be way more.</p>

      <label for="lnl1j8z" class="commentText"><p>There are a number of ways that you could do this. By relative employment levels by ethnicity, by number of police interactions relative to ethnicity, by infant mortality, by integration of neighbourhoods, by education level attained, and so on. Basic sociological stuff. Hate crimes would actually be a pretty bad way of evaluating it - both because of the nature of hate crime recording, but also because it flattens what racism is.</p>

      <label for="lnksdq9" class="commentText"><p>I was more thinking along the lines of segregation and where the &ldquo;black&rdquo; neighborhoods are and where the &ldquo;white&rdquo; ones are.  Milwaukee is the 5th most segregated city in America, and the black neighborhoods are also some of the poorest in the USA.  It&rsquo;s hard to make it out of those neighborhoods and a lot of ppl born in them will never have the opportunity to really make it out. There are some people from Metclafe Park who will literally never leave that neighborhood in their entire lives, except to prison or the courthouse. I remember a local reporter once brought a resident of Metclafe to a Bucks game at Firserv and it was quite literally his first time downtown, he had never really been outside of a 10 block radius from his neighborhood.</p>

<p>Also unfortunately a lot of the violence isn&rsquo;t hate crimes, it&rsquo;s black on black, they pushed all the poor and desperate people into the same area so of course gangs would form and the city thinks as long as the violence in kept in one area it doesn&rsquo;t matter so they never do anything about it.</p>

      <label for="lnldv4o" class="commentText"><p>More random SI trivia:</p>

<p>The first basketball player to ever grace the cover of SI was Kenny Sears in <a href="https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/2/santa-clara-university-ken-sears-december-20-1954-sports-illustrated-cover.jpg" target="_blank">the December 20, 1954 issue</a>.</p>

<p>At the time, Sears was the star center at Santa Clara University. He would go on to have a respectable NBA career, being twice named an All Star.</p>

      <label for="lnl4t2v" class="commentText"><p>This is why I think the question of whether players today are better than the players of yesterday is so frustrating. It ignores <em>a lot</em>. In reality, the question should be: If the players of today were instead born into some previous era of basketball, would they perform better? But that&rsquo;s a boring question, because they obviously would not. And I&rsquo;m of the opinion that a lot of the barriers that the greats like Bill Russell had to deal with, would keep a lot of modern players away if they had grown up in that same era.</p>
