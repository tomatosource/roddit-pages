</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I was reading through old newspaper story from 1958 which explained that the night before the Game 6 of the 1958 NBA Championships (11 April 1958) the following happened:</p>

<p><em>The magazine, Sports Illustrated, has a  written story on basketball star Bill Russell of the Boston Celtics and the stark prejudice of his downtown restaurants. The article, which does not contain one word of preachment, tells how Bill Russell was injured in the third game of the championship basketball playoffs, which had as opponents the Celtics and your St. Louis Hawks. On the night before the 6th game here in St. Louis, Celtic coach Red Auerbach and teammates Bob Cousy and Tom Heinsohn were sitting in the lobby of the Hotel Jefferson, when Bill Russell limped in.</em></p>

<p><em>His teammates were surprised to see him, because Russell had been ordered to stay home and rest his injured ankle. But the lanky basketball star couldn&rsquo;t stay away from the game. He told Coach Auerbach, &ldquo;I didn’t come here to watch the game, I came here to play.&rdquo; The coach didn’t argue with his fighting spirit. He invited Bill Russell to go with the rest of them across the street to an all-night cafeteria. When they got their trays and stood in line, the counterman looked at Russell and said he wouldn&rsquo;t serve Bill.&rdquo; They went around the corner from the hotel to a greasy hamburger joint, and were again rebuffed. The team mates went back to the hotel hungry.</em></p>

<p>Three years later on the 11th April 1961, Bill delivered one of his greatest performances in Game 5 of the 1961 NBA finals against the St Louis Hawks. Russell scored 30 points, got 38 Rebounds and blocked 8 shots to win the NBA Championship.</p>

<p>I found this story interesting a given that it was exactly three years later to the prior event.</p>
