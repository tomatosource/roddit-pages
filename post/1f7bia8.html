      <label for="ll6mv7u" class="commentText"><p>As much as it pains me to say it, guys like Rodman and Pippen should not be on a list like this. As good as they were, there&rsquo;s no way perimeter guys can provide the same defensive value as a big.</p>

<p>Rodman/Pippen/Kawhi can destroy one guy. Bigs consistently deter the most valuable shots in the game. Making the best perimeter guy shoot worse is valuable, but nowhere near as valuable as making a bunch of layups worse.</p>

<p>A good illustration: How does a team with 2 Top 10 defenders ever (according to this comment chain), another top 20 (Jordan) and 2 more defense first players  never get mentioned as a top 10 defense ever, while tons with only one (04 Pistons, Russell Celtics) always do? Big man defense is simply more valuable and more impactful.</p>

      <label for="ll69bup" class="commentText"><p>Dude has really replied to me, that he thinks every guy here is better than Rodman.</p>

<p>So Draymond Green, the nut kicker (I know I know, he has been better and a DPOY), is a better D player?</p>

<p>Guy has not even added Rudy Gobert or Dwight Howard, literally four and three times DPOYs.</p>

<p>No Marc Gasol too. No Kawhi as well.</p>

<p>But Draymond is here. Time Duncan, who never won a DPOY is better than three-four times DPOYs.</p>

<p>Biggest disrespect to me still, is the lack of Rodman. The purest 1-5 defender we have seen. Not talking about the potential of Bill Russell to defend guards, but was he known for that? Same goes for most people mentioned here. They had the potential, but Rodman did it, and has two DPOYs to show for it.</p>

if you use accolades as sole metric in ranking players’ ability to play basketball, then you should probably watch more basketball.</p>

<p>marcus smart has a DPOY. do you think he’s a better defensive player than Anthony Davis ?</p>

<p>kobe has one MVP. steve nash has two. jokic has three. do you think the Nash and Jokic are better players than Kobe ?</p>

<p>there’s a lot of narrative that comes with awards like that so they should hold very little weight in ball debates.</p>

<p>dwight howard, rudy gobert &amp; rodman are also some of the best defensive players but they’re just not better than the names on the list to me because i feel names like Draymond green simply had more impact on defense and bill walton because of the era he played in.</p>

<p>and IMO i don’t even think Rodman was better/more impactful than Pippen.</p>

<p>My brother, IDK if you and me are watching the same NBA, and maybe we will always see it differently, but the Dwight, Rudy have had a better impact that Dray.</p>

<p>And about Rodman and his role being lesser than Pippen&rsquo;s, brother. He just did not defend, like actually defend 1-5, he got you rebounds too. He got balls when they were headed out of bounds.</p>

<p>I am almost sure he will be top 5 in 90% of lists out there. Again, maybe we will always look at it differently.</p>

      <label for="ll6hhkm" class="commentText"><p>Draymond Green is the greatest defensive communicator i have ever seen.
he’s also most likely the smartest defender on this list.
one of the greatest versatile defenders in the history of the sport as well and the reason why this is so important is because he plays in an era where versatility is extremely important.</p>

<p>in this pace and space era that we’re in, PnR is utilized in almost every possession and once you draw Gobert and DH away from the paint, they cannot switch as effectively as Draymond Green and their impact reduces significantly. The coaching staff then has to come up with some scheme to cover up for them.</p>

<p>draymond green can seamlessly switch the pnr without bleeding any value defensively because he’s one of the most versatile man defenders oat and he can also hold his own quite well against big men down low as we’ve seen numerous times.
++ he’s in constant communication with his teammates to cover up any loopholes or gaps in the defense.</p>

<p>ibr the only reason he isn’t higher up on this list is because he’s 6’8.</p>

      <label for="ll6eb0e" class="commentText"><p>what I mean is about the coma hahahaha and not about Rodman not being included, but I think being DPOY doesnt mean you are a very good defender, DPOY basically comes from Team Defense and not individual then when that team defense is number 1, that&rsquo;s when they chose a player, its weird but that happens to Rudy this year. his defense as individual is not the likes of AD or BAM but because his team has great defense and he is the one anchoring it, that is why he is chosen as the winner of the Award.</p>

      <label for="ll67v3b" class="commentText"><p>Dwight Howard has to be on there imo. 3 DPOY, 5 All Defense selections, 13th all time in blocks, best defensive big man of his era. When&rsquo;s the last time a super star player carried a team to the finals on the back of their defense? He only put up 20ppg in 2009 but we ran to the Finals on the back of Dwight&rsquo;s defense and the team defense we were able to build around him. Dude was surrounded by players who had never before and never after been lauded for their defense: Jameer Nelson (undersized pg), a rookie Courtney Lee (who was good defensively but was still a rookie that year), Hedo Turkoglu (who was never a standout defender), Rashard Lewis (who was severly undersized as a PF back then and also never known for being a strong defender).</p>

<p>Dwight Howard is absolutely one of the best defenders of all time. Should be on here over Draymond at least.</p>

One of if not the best pure man defender of all-time, his lateral quickness and post reaction time was uncanny. Not to mention he was a brick wall. I feel like he gets underrated just because he’s old-school.</p>

<p>I think Kareem was a more fundamental defender than Dwight, not to knock Dwight but he had a tendency to block-chase which hurt his positioning often. Kareem has also led some excellent defensive teams despite spotty personnel. But it’s pretty close so by all means, it’s fair.</p>

      <label for="ll6g3of" class="commentText"><p>Im surprised how low most people are on Draymond as a defender. I think he&rsquo;s the best defender in the league of the last decade above Gobert, Kawhi and AD. His hands are super quick, and he is super versatile and lead the Warriors to being a top defense multiple times. and that success continued in the post season.</p>

<p>Then guys like Kidd, Payton &amp; Frazier need to be considered into the mix as well. Just because they weren’t rim protectors doesn’t mean they weren’t an issue on defense.</p>

<p>&amp; I’m curious why no one has put Rudy on their list 😅</p>

      <label for="ll6c0uv" class="commentText"><p>Interesting discussion. I’m not going to argue either of the two names on this list belong in the top 10, but are two names people might overlook:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Alvin Robertson: Ranks 9th all time in defensive box plus-minus, which is especially impressive for a guard. One of the all-time leaders in steals per minute (around 3rd, depending on cutoff for minutes played). Recorded an ultra-rare quadruple double that included 10 steals (only person in NBA history to record a quadruple double with 10 steals).</p></li>

<li><p>Rasheed Wallace: 33rd all-time in defensive win shares doesn’t get him close to the top 10. But I’ve with the possible exceptions of Payton and Jordan, and maybe Draymond, I’ve never seen another player defend better during clutch moments. Not sure if there’s a stat for that, but seeing him shut down all-stars like KG and Duncan in clutch moments was awe-inspiring.</p></li>

      <label for="ll67506" class="commentText"><p>Draymond Green, Bill Walton, and Wilt probably shouldn&rsquo;t be on there. Draymond is close, but there are arguably better defenders from this era. Bill Walton was great defensively, but I think you run into the issue of how long his peak was. Wilt is another one who&rsquo;s close, but when his competition was Russell, it kinda makes his defense pale in comparison, in my opinion. My list is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pippen</p></li>

<li><p>David Robinson</p></li>

<li><p>Dwight Howard</p></li>

<li><p>Dikembe Mutumbo</p></li>

<li><p>Dennis Rodman</p></li>

<li><p>KG</p></li>

<li><p>Ben Wallace</p></li>

<li><p>Duncan</p></li>

<li><p>Olajuwon</p></li>

<li><p>Russell</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The way I see it, everyone is going to have these top 5 on everyone&rsquo;s list, in some order or another, so they may as well be the top 5. From there, it&rsquo;s far more subjective, but I think Thurmond is a great pick. I think Wilt said he had the toughest time scoring on him.</p>

<p>Seriously MJ was quite a solid defender no doubt, but he got was too many defensive accolades, same as Kobe.</p>

<p>Especially when Pippen was the star of the show on the Bulls defense.</p>

<p>MJ was a fantastic defensive guard, he&rsquo;s not even near the level of the great bigs and considerably below Pippen.</p>

      <label for="ll6g1i8" class="commentText"><p>Dude. Pippen guarded Magic for 3 quarters in Game 2 AS the primary defender. Why- MJ picked up his 3rd foul early. Every other Game MJ was the primary defender. 66% of total possessions!</p>

<p>And you know what, I actually watched it back then!</p>

<p>Btw by def RAPTOR MJ was the 4th best perimeter defender ever! </p>

<p>Pippen was a great defender, but not better. They were pretty equal.</p>

<p>What made the Bulls defense so tough to deal with was Jordans and Pippens ability to play lock down D and play free safty at the same time. both were incredibly long and agile.</p>

<p>Jordan averaged 4.8 DWS per season, Pippen averaged 4.7 DWS per season.</p>

<p>Jordan averaged 2.0 DBPM, Pippen just 1.8</p>

<p>Jordan has a Drtg of 103, Pippen is at 102.</p>

<p>Pippen also should have won 1 DPOY. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>It has him as the 4th best <strong>guard</strong>, not the 4th best perimeter defender overall. Pippen literally is in the list right above with a higher DRAPTOR, and MJ gets absolutely dwarfed by the big men on said list too.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Nobody denied this, as I said before, MJ is definitely one of the greats as far as defensive guards go.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jordan averaged 4.8 DWS per season, Pippen averaged 4.7 DWS per season.</p>

<p>Jordan averaged 2.0 DBPM, Pippen just 1.8</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both are notoriously poor ways to judge defense, particularly DBPM. For reference, Jokic has the 3rd highest DBPM on record to date, and he would very obviously not be on your (or any sane person&rsquo;s) list.</p>

<p>Also not really sure why you&rsquo;re using averages. If you want to argue peak it&rsquo;s not that relevant, and if it&rsquo;s top 10 for a career it&rsquo;s also not very relevant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jordan has a Drtg of 103, Pippen is at 102.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only might individual DRtg be the most worthless statistic in basketball, but lower is better in it. Near equals, but according to that Pippen still comes out ahead.</p>

      <label for="ll6mxeh" class="commentText"><p>Defense is hard to picture in stats.true. I used the stats we have. I know they are not perfect. I also know lower Drtg is better. That&rsquo;s why I used it, to show they are pretty even. Jordan has a slight edge in  DWS and DBPM, Pippen in Drtg. </p>

<p> Averages are more useful in comparison than accumulative stats. Especially if the Game sample size is +100 games apart.</p>

<p>But I actually overread Pippen having a 2.3 def RAPTOR. My bad. </p>

<p>Like I said. Pretty equal. </p>

<p>Pippen should have won 1 DPOY as well. </p>
