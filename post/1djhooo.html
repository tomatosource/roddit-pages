      <p>i know this is irrelevant right now but this has got me thinking since last night. how come they beat the nuggets but lost to the mavs? was luka just that good? was ant just tired because of kyrie? or were they really just one hell of a match up for the nuggets? cause i refuse to believe that they are less of a team than the mavs. would appreciate it if yall would lay out your thoughts regarding this lol</p>

      <label for="l9arz1c" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s all about match ups.</p>

<p>Nuggets don&rsquo;t have eltie rim protection. Ant attacked the rim at will.
The Mavs had rim protection all the time. Ant had to rely on his outside shot a lot more and wasn&rsquo;t as effective.</p>

<p>The Celtics proved that the most important part of the Mavs offense is Luka&rsquo;s playmaking. They took that away, by switching everything, and the Mavs offense fell off a cliff.
As long as Gobert is out there, the Wolves can&rsquo;t play a switching defense. He can&rsquo;t defend Luka outside the 3 point line. But in drop Luka&rsquo;s playmaking is at its best. So the Mavs role players got easy shots.
Luka was scoring and playmaking at all level that was hard for the Wolves to keep up with especially in the clutch.</p>

<p>Also, the Celtics had the bodies to throw at Luka. Jaylen Brown and Tatum actually have the body type you need to guard Luka. Mcdaniels is not heavy enough and Ant is to short.</p>

<p>The Wolves are a good team. They just ran into a player they&rsquo;re not built to stop, and is probably the pick and roll operator in the league.
The same way the Mavs are a good team but ran into a team that has the antidote for a Luka Doncic lead offense.</p>

      <label for="l9az4qo" class="commentText"><p>McDaniels is young and getting stronger.</p>

<p>But that series was really close most of the time, and Luka benefitted from way too many messed up calls by baiting the refs. Additionally, several players who had previously played great seemed to hit a wall. Coming off an emotional 7-game series with little rest can do that.</p>

<p>The Wolves were clearly a better, deeper team than the Nuggets. That series should not have gone 7 games.</p>

<p>I think with a little bit better game plan they could have beaten the Mavs. And it would have been a much better finals if the Wolves had faced the Celtics.</p>

<p>Next season will be the third for Gobert with the Wolves, and there&rsquo;s no reason to think he won&rsquo;t continue to adapt. If he and KAT both continue to build on what they started last year they&rsquo;ll continue to be a force. Ant has improved every season he&rsquo;s been in the league. Only two seasons ago this was still KAT&rsquo;s team, and half way through the playoffs this year media pundits were saying Ant is the face of the <em>league</em>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all happening so fast. This team is pretty young and currently on a good trajectory. One pickup in free agency, or one slick trade could propel them to the top, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s necessary. I think it&rsquo;s just as likely that last year&rsquo;s experience and an updated approach will make all the difference.</p>

<p>Oh, and they need to hound the league about the inconsistent whistles. I elected not to watch half the nuggets series or most of the Mavs series because the refs were cherry picking when and when not to use their whistles. Key Wolves players were constantly in foul trouble while their biggest opponents were brazenly fouling and not getting called for it until the 3rd or 4th quarter. Totally changes the defensive schemes and will of a defense. It&rsquo;s really hard not to buy into conspiracy narratives when the refs set a tone that immediately impacts either teams approach.</p>

      <label for="l9avoy0" class="commentText"><p>Fans are [rightfully] so focused on their own team, but the reality is, it&rsquo;s hard to win a championship. Celtics have been chipping away for years and finally were able to accomplish it in Tatum&rsquo;s 7th season (5th ECF or Finals). Unless you have a generational superstar, it&rsquo;s hard to win on your first go-around and then consistently win after that.</p>

<p>I suppose there are moves the Wolves could make, but that probably involves trading KAT. Who would they trade him for, though? It&rsquo;s a similar situation to Jaylen Brown - many people wanted to trade him, too, but he finally proved to be a legitimate running mate with Tatum. The same could happen with KAT. If the Wolves continue to make the WCF at a relatively consistent clip, it&rsquo;s likely they will eventually break through, too.</p>
