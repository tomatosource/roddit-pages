      <label for="l9arz1c" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s all about match ups.</p>

<p>Nuggets don&rsquo;t have eltie rim protection. Ant attacked the rim at will.
The Mavs had rim protection all the time. Ant had to rely on his outside shot a lot more and wasn&rsquo;t as effective.</p>

<p>The Celtics proved that the most important part of the Mavs offense is Luka&rsquo;s playmaking. They took that away, by switching everything, and the Mavs offense fell off a cliff.
As long as Gobert is out there, the Wolves can&rsquo;t play a switching defense. He can&rsquo;t defend Luka outside the 3 point line. But in drop Luka&rsquo;s playmaking is at its best. So the Mavs role players got easy shots.
Luka was scoring and playmaking at all level that was hard for the Wolves to keep up with especially in the clutch.</p>

<p>Also, the Celtics had the bodies to throw at Luka. Jaylen Brown and Tatum actually have the body type you need to guard Luka. Mcdaniels is not heavy enough and Ant is to short.</p>

<p>The Wolves are a good team. They just ran into a player they&rsquo;re not built to stop, and is probably the best pick and roll operator in the league.
The same way the Mavs are a good team but ran into a team that has the antidote for a Luka Doncic lead offense.</p>

      <label for="l9bdlnf" class="commentText"><p>Also on the defensive end, The Mavs could hide Luka defensively by having him kinda zone up at the low block since Gobert&rsquo;s not an offensive threat and that added another body to help slow down drives. The Celtics had 5 guys on the floor that are offensive threats, and they could p and r until they got the matchups they wanted, which was Luka most of the time. That not only worked to create better shots for the Celtics, but also helped tire Luka out a bit, as exemplified by the number of second half turnovers Luka had.</p>

<p>However, I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily say &ldquo;hide Luka&rdquo;, I would say the Mavs didn&rsquo;t have to worry about Luka not being engaged or giving effort defensivley. Because they didn&rsquo;t really need to hide him at all. Apart from Edwards, and maybe Naz, who were the Mavs afraid of bringing Luka on to an island to defend them one on one? McDaniels? Kyle Anderson? Even Conley couldn&rsquo;t  really cook Luka the Celtics were attacking him.</p>

<p>Also the Wolves didn&rsquo;t make the Mavs pay for Luka ball watching, losing his man off ball, not boxing out, not rotating to shooters fast enough etc. In the Celtics series, everytime Luka wasn&rsquo;t engaged defensivley, on/off ball, the Mavs paid the price by either giving up a wide open shot or offensive rebound or a shot at the rim (because Jrue cut to the basket when Luka wasn&rsquo;t paying attention).</p>

<p>So yeah, the Celtics had players who where threats on and off the ball. The Wolves offense was more static and lacking in personnel to take advantage of the same weaknesses.</p>

<p>This was really the difference in the series.</p>

<p>Celtics didn&rsquo;t really play up to their offensive level. And the Mavs despite Luka&rsquo;s defensive efforts, we&rsquo;re actually not doing a terrible job of defending.</p>

<p>Their offense was completely shut down by the Celtics.</p>

<p>Wish we could’ve seen the Celtics vs another western conference team like OKC or Denver. Similarly dynamic offenses like the pacers but with better closers. Could’ve gotten a <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> game finals</p>

<p>Also, Wolves were physically and emotionally exhausted by beating the former champs- they had to dig deep after being down 3-2. They had no legs and shot like shit in the Mavs series, and still only lost the first two games by a basket each. They got their heart taken after those first two, and getting jobbed by the refs on more than a couple calls didn&rsquo;t help.</p>

<p>Wolves-Celts would&rsquo;ve been a much better series. Dallas is a bad match-up for us. A few adjustments and we&rsquo;ll be ok.</p>

      <label for="l9az4qo" class="commentText"><p>McDaniels is young and getting stronger.</p>

<p>But that series was really close most of the time, and Luka benefitted from way too many messed up calls by baiting the refs. Additionally, several players who had previously played great seemed to hit a wall. Coming off an emotional 7-game series with little rest can do that.</p>

<p>The Wolves were clearly a better, deeper team than the Nuggets. That series should not have gone 7 games.</p>

<p>I think with a little bit better game plan they could have beaten the Mavs. And it would have been a much better finals if the Wolves had faced the Celtics.</p>

<p>Next season will be the third for Gobert with the Wolves, and there&rsquo;s no reason to think he won&rsquo;t continue to adapt. If he and KAT both continue to build on what they started last year they&rsquo;ll continue to be a force. Ant has improved every season he&rsquo;s been in the league. Only two seasons ago this was still KAT&rsquo;s team, and half way through the playoffs this year media pundits were saying Ant is the face of the <em>league</em>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all happening so fast. This team is pretty young and currently on a good trajectory. One pickup in free agency, or one slick trade could propel them to the top, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s necessary. I think it&rsquo;s just as likely that last year&rsquo;s experience and an updated approach will make all the difference.</p>

<p>Oh, and they need to hound the league about the inconsistent whistles. I elected not to watch half the nuggets series or most of the Mavs series because the refs were cherry picking when and when not to use their whistles. Key Wolves players were constantly in foul trouble while their biggest opponents were brazenly fouling and not getting called for it until the 3rd or 4th quarter. Totally changes the defensive schemes and will of a defense. It&rsquo;s really hard not to buy into conspiracy narratives when the refs set a tone that immediately impacts either teams approach.</p>

<p>It was close score wise. But it never felt like the Wolves took control of that series.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Deeper, probably. Better definitely not. The Wolves beat a team better than them because they were able to neutralise their offense.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This Mavs team has only been togther half a season. They&rsquo;ll be better too next year.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Are they? Yeah, Ant/Mcdaniels/Naz are young. KAT is 28, Gobert is 31, Conely is 36.
The Mavs are younger, Thunder ae younger.
The Wolves are closer in age to the Nuggets than they are to the Mavs.</p>

<p>Also, the refs are the refs. They haven&rsquo;t been the best. But every team has dealt with bad calls. There hasn&rsquo;t been a call so bad it&rsquo;s changed a series.</p>

<p>The Wolves are a good team. They&rsquo;ll be back. And could win the West next year. But that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean they were &ldquo;robbed&rdquo; this year or they were clearly better than every other team. Hope, they address what they were missing this year to come back stronger.</p>

<p>Minnesota had the lead with under 2 minutes to go in both games.</p>

<p>Minnesota had a 5 point lead with just over a minute to go in Game 2 and would have had a 4 point lead with 45 seconds to go had it not been for one of the most egregious calls in NBA history.</p>

Again, the refs are the refs. Also, that bad call in game 2 happens a lot. It just happened to be in a close game. That call didn&rsquo;t change the outcome of the series.</p>

      <label for="l9ccwp0" class="commentText"><p>How can you argue the series was one sided when another team had the lead at the end of the game for Games 1 and Games 2 and won Game 4?</p>

<p>The only game that was lopsided was Game 5.</p>

<p>In Game 2, Zarba made the wrong call on purpose.  Wolves would have won if he made the obvious correct call.  You can see him looking at the play unobstructed from 3 feet away.  Kyrie was not close to the ball on the foul.  If refs miss those calls often, they should all be fired (which many should).</p>

<p>The Mavs figured out the Wolves&rsquo; defense and out-executed them in the clutch and that was the difference in the series.</p>

<p>Edit: rookie Tatum went to ECF in 2017-18, rookie Kawhi went to WCF in 2011-12, rookie Charles Barkley went to ECF in 1984-85 though I&rsquo;m not sure if he was a starter</p>

<p>Same with Luka. You can&rsquo;t stop him offensively, he will get 25+ points a night. All you can hope for is to limit his playmaking or hope that he shoots himself in the foot by like fouling out or something. However with Luka you CAN target him on defense and tire him out. Which is exactly what the Celtics did, to great effect.</p>

      <label for="l9bblme" class="commentText"><p>Jamal&rsquo;s wrist injury had him shooting bricks, so Joker had no 2nd option. Which led to him battling post game with Kat (who&rsquo;s big and strong enough to exhaust him over the course of the entire game). He dominated Gobsrt in paint though that game was a master class.</p>

<p>The other denver players aren&rsquo;t shot creators so they went cold from 3.</p>

<p>And denver has literally zero bench so you can&rsquo;t rest the joker at all.</p>

<p>Basically Murray hitting shots is the key to denver, it unlocks the 2 man game, which allows other guys to get open catch and shoot 3&rsquo;s.</p>

      <label for="l9avoy0" class="commentText"><p>Fans are [rightfully] so focused on their own team, but the reality is, it&rsquo;s hard to win a championship. Celtics have been chipping away for years and finally were able to accomplish it in Tatum&rsquo;s 7th season (5th ECF or Finals). Unless you have a generational superstar, it&rsquo;s hard to win on your first go-around and then consistently win after that.</p>

<p>I suppose there are moves the Wolves could make, but that probably involves trading KAT. Who would they trade him for, though? It&rsquo;s a similar situation to Jaylen Brown - many people wanted to trade him, too, but he finally proved to be a legitimate running mate with Tatum. The same could happen with KAT. If the Wolves continue to make the WCF at a relatively consistent clip, it&rsquo;s likely they will eventually break through, too.</p>

      <label for="l9c62q2" class="commentText"><p>This isn&rsquo;t really about saving money as much as maintaining flexibility. You can&rsquo;t pay Gobert, KAT, Ant, and McDaniels, and still expect to get any free agent signings or be allowed to freely participate in the trade market if you hit whichever apron means you can&rsquo;t aggregate salaries. The easiest way to keep that flexibility is to shed a max contract. Considering you just sold the farm for Gobert, it&rsquo;s hard to see MN trading him, and Ant is the future, so that leaves trading KAT or just running it back with a 36 year old Mike Conley and the rest of the flaws on the roster and going into cap hell when you need to extend guys and hoping for the best.</p>

      <label for="l9ceyr6" class="commentText"><p>I mean I don’t think you’re necessarily making the greatest point. The Celtics front office made good move after good move to support the Jays, even when they had to fire their head coach, they just kept chugging.</p>

<p>Who else has that kind of confidence in their front office? How often are teams are deep and good as the Celtics assembled? That’s what you need to win with a “flawed” played.</p>

<p>Even if you say it’s feasible, KAT is a different kind of flawed. The Jays offense might not <em>always</em> be immaculate but their defense is mostly really good, their playmaking also helps offset bad shooting nights. KAT is a much worse defensive player at a more pivotal position for team defense. KAT self anointed greatest shooting big man of all time avg’d 36% from 3 on 5 attempts, Lebron out shot him from 3 in the playoffs this year. He averaged less than 3 assists per game in the playoffs.</p>

<p>If the Jays are “flawed” then KAT is whatever is a step beyond that. I’m not saying you can’t win with him, but everything would have to break just right, way more so than for your average star. You just can’t expect to win with someone who is as inconsistent offensively as he is, is a traffic cone on defense, a bad playmaker, it’s just too much to account for most of the time unless he has the series or playoffs of his life.</p>

<p>I’m not saying trade him, but I absolutely understanding people saying moving him is their best bet to potentially improve and win</p>

      <label for="l9bwm6x" class="commentText"><p>He makes dumb mistakes but i don’t agree that his bbiq is bad. He’d played great defense for the most part and he’s a great playmaker on the offensive end. The offense is so much more dynamic with him in the lineup and I don’t see how you find a replacement for that</p>

Lebron carried 11 guys named Mo to the finals and got that experience. And we just saw the Jays in Boston.</p>

<p>A good distributor and 1 more playoff run for Ant and the Wolves will probably bring the first title to MN since Mikan.</p>

      <label for="l9btlak" class="commentText"><p>I’d love to upgrade any part of the roster, so if there was an opportunity to upgrade KAT, I’d take it. With that said, KAT will also get better with experience. This postseason run doubled the number of career playoff games he was in. Even within the Nuggets series we saw him improve massively as the series went on.</p>

<p>I think there’s a case to be made that the Wolves will get a lot better just running it back. They really just lack someone to eat minutes at PG. They have 3 critical pieces who are &amp;lt;25 plus KAT. They’ll get better with playoff experience</p>

      <label for="l9b1qsx" class="commentText"><p>Timberwolves are just missing time and experience. It will come. Ant solidifies as a true top 5 player eventually, maybe Jaden develops a few wrinkles to his offensive game and adds a few pounds to his frame for Luka types. Solid PG&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t *too* difficult to come by in terms of an original style PG - just a distributor that can set up the actions and not get hunted on defense come playoffs. KAT probably gets traded eventually but the return won&rsquo;t be bad and streaky big men shooters are more around than ever. Bright future ahead.</p>

      <label for="l9biwav" class="commentText"><p>KAT playing horribly in the WCF had a huge impact. If he even shot average, it’d space the floor better. Ant maturing would help more too.</p>

<p>Gobert is the trickiest answer because he’ll always play drop coverage and the Mavs feasted on it. Finch and go. Will have to figure out how to keep Gobert from getting drawn out of the paint too much. Gobert is the best interior defender in basketball, but whatever team he’s on always suffer when they figure out a way to get him in no-man’s land out of the paint.</p>

<p>I thought Minnesota would’ve been able to switch on the perimeter enough to give Luka and Kyrie a little trouble, but they relentlessly drew the bigs out and eviscerated them. They’ll have to figure out how to get more switchability on the perimeter while camping Gobert near the basket. Maybe that can be another 3D, which the Wolves probably can’t afford, so who knows? It’s a problem every team with Gobert has yet to solve. The Buvks are the only team to win a title with a drop defense. Maybe there are some answers in Bud’s schemes?</p>

<p>The other option is to trade KAT and reconfigure the team, though I would probably roll one more year with the current pillars. Since KAT will be insanely expensive after next year, they’ll have to consider that option.</p>

<p>I think it’s just a case of getting a better PG and ANT settling into his superstar role.</p>

      <label for="l9bzx6v" class="commentText"><p>Everyone hates the truth, but Walker Kessler, four 1st-round picks, and a bunch of cap space.</p>

<p>Now it feels like their path to success is:
A) Ant become top 5 player next season
B) They do some FO wizardry that involves trading Kat or Naz Reid
C) Retool so they are in a good position when Ant hits his prime and Gobert is no longer making max money</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think they are really ready to compete. Boston is a lot better, they&rsquo;re probably the 4th best team in the West, and 2 of those teams have much easier path to improve.</p>

      <label for="l9bmylm" class="commentText"><p>Ant &amp; Towns just flat out got outplayed by Kyrie &amp; Luka.  I wished they wouldve blitzed Luka more. They are still really really good at flying around on D as evidence in the Denver game Rudy missed.</p>

<p>I also think Ant needs to expend less energy on D.  He is an outstanding individual defender but he expended A LOT of energy on D.  He’s not just staying in front but constantly pressuring ball &amp; trying to create turnovers. Takes too much energy. Needs to limit that style to spots.  He looked worn out vs Mavs.</p>

<p>Also very tough to win it with your best player being only 22.</p>

      <label for="l9bo8oh" class="commentText"><p>I think the Wolves got tired after the Denver series but also played poorly overall against the Mavs&hellip; bad shooting (KAT and Ant shot under 30% for Games 1 and 2), stupid unforced turnovers (late in games and leading to points off of turnovers), and bad coaching.</p>

<p>Ant and McDaniels were getting destroyed on the perimeter against Dallas which was a strength of the Wolves all season.  I am guessing both were tired plus Ant may have been playing hurt.  NAW also injured his shooting shoulder fighting through an illegal screen against Denver and he couldn&rsquo;t make any shots after that.</p>

The problem for Minnesota is that KAT makes them bulletproof against the Nuggets, but also is a total liability against other elite teams. Their only real chance at a championship is get rid of him, and just hope someone else takes care of Denver for them. If Boston can find Jrue and Porzingis in exchange for literal dogshit worthless pieces, then you have to ask your GM to find something in exchange for a center who is at least great offensively. They are close enough that if they can make the right trade, they can still compete with Denver and be ready for other teams as well.</p>

      <label for="l9bdppt" class="commentText"><p>Not only did Ant and some of the other players look visibly gassed during the WCF, but many of the players said that they needed to train differently this summer because they were tired. Which is honestly really sad, I&rsquo;d be so peeved if I were on the team and the reason we lost is that we weren&rsquo;t in good enough shape. I do think this is a factor.</p>

<p>I also think they need to be comfortable matching up in the playoffs and benching Rudy. Yes Rudy gets too much hate. BUT he is a very limited offensive player who is also ineffective on defense against a handful of teams, which is a common aspect of non-mobile bigs. The Spurs beat the Heat when they benched Tiago Splitter for Boris Diaw. The Warriors beat the Cavs when they benched Andrew Bogut for Andre Iguodala. The Wolves needed to have benched Rudy Gobert against the Mavs. That is bad coaching because of a big contract</p>

<p>They should have been in the finals this year. That means they&rsquo;re missing very little if anything. Really disappointing end to a great year for the wolves, ultimately a lot just has to go right to make it as far as they did so we&rsquo;ll see</p>
