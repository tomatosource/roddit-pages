      <label for="l8xap84" class="commentText"><p>“It wasn’t one of my options, it wasn’t like No. 1 on my list,” Irving said. “So when the trade opportunity got approached to me, instead of going back and appreciating the Celtics’ history, I just came in with an open mind and just kind of like, alright, I’m just going to go with the flow into this. But I think that was the wrong approach.”</p>

<p>“Now that I’m a little older, hindsight looking back on it, I would’ve definitely taken the time to get to know the people within the community,” Irving said. “Talk to some of the champions that have come before me and actually extend myself to them instead of the other way around expecting them to be there for me, giving me advice. Because they’ve been through it, they have a championship pedigree here, they’ve shown it for years, they’re one of the most winning franchise in all of sports.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I was talking about in terms of accepting the choices,” Irving said. “But looking back, I would have shown my respect and have more of a council around me from some of the Boston Celtics that came before me to explain what the pressure is like.”</p>

      <label for="l8xmn88" class="commentText"><p>You wonder why players hate the media - this was a solid, thoughtful, introspective answer in which Kyrie basically said he approached the club wrong and didn’t appreciate what it was and called them one of the most winning franchises in sports history, and then you see what got posted from this. I guarantee if they weren’t required to talk to the media these dudes wouldn’t cross the street to piss on one of these reporters to put out a fire, and neither would I in their situation.</p>

      <label for="l8xucvp" class="commentText"><p>lol you mean the headline that is literally referencing the sound bite where he says when the crowd is shouting “kyrie sucks” that they have a psychological edge and he wants to silence them early??? You mean the headline and article that had nothing to with the sound bite in this posted clip that was taken out of context earlier only on social media from which i can find.</p>

<p>Come on man, it seems like you saw my comment, wanted to counter it to hate on the media and went to the least journalistic site to make your counter, saw a headline and assumed it was related to the subject at hand and used it to establish your counter argument.</p>

<p>I’m not even trying to say the media is good, I’m saying often times it’s social that makes things inflammatory and takes things out of context and everyone points to “the media” as the ones who tricked them. Most people aren’t opening an article, they are getting their info from a twitter quote. Just like the shit that happened to Kyrie here.</p>

<p>So, yes, it&rsquo;s the capital-M Media, not just random jackasses on Twitter.</p>

      <label for="l8xnnxe" class="commentText"><p>This is way more logical as a full quote. As a Knicks fan, some people openly don’t like coming here because the media is a monster. There’s taxes. There’s this and there’s that. I’m older now than what Kyrie was when he joined the Celtics. And with time comes knowledge, and sometimes that knowledge is just wishing you went about something with a lot more of a plan instead of that youthful wing it attitude.</p>

<p>like, the full quote gives it context, but the original quote still kind of pushes blame/responsibility on Boston rather than himself which he very much acted immaturely. A massive part of the reason why he was so affected by the Boston media was because of his own antics.</p>

<p>This is the guy who wanted out of Cleveland for an immature reason (didn’t want to play in Lebron’s shadow), did things like talk about how much he wanted to stay in Boston while he was there but then wanted out, spouted both antivax and antisemitic conspiracies as well as many other things. The pressure of Boston was a lot for him because of how closed minded and narcissistic he is</p>

<p>I just don’t understand how he can say stuff like this, then call the Celtics organization a cult and not for everyone in the same interview.</p>

      <label for="l8xis7h" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s all silly really.  His idea of leading the team at the time was dominating like LeBron, but of course he&rsquo;s not LeBron.  In a locker room of vets that needed shots to get paid, and young guns that had gotten the team to the CF the year before with him injured, the implosion was inevitable.</p>

<p>Kyrie being Kyrie can&rsquo;t just say he failed so you get all this odd reasoning.</p>

      <label for="l8xhyd4" class="commentText"><p>Tbf - Mavs fans did the same with KP on the JJ podcast. He was trying to be self reflecting and identifying non injury reasons for some of his struggles in Dallas and Mavs fans locked in on one part of his quote without including the context. It&rsquo;s been a very annoying thing to have to keep defending KP about.</p>

      <label for="l8xi1yj" class="commentText"><p>But that&rsquo;s why this happens with him. He has proven himself time and time again to not be sincere/genuine in these moments. I get Dallas fans trying to defend him (we did against Cav fans at the time) but there&rsquo;s clearly a pattern here across 3 organizational stints now that he hasn&rsquo;t matured or changed. If he does, happy for you guys. Now Celtics fans should thank Kyrie for saving us from the headache of him on a max deal here.</p>

      <label for="l8xvhrz" class="commentText"><p>It seems like Kyrie has matured a lot since joining Dallas. He was my favorite player to watch before he joined the Celtics, and I was ecstatic when he joined us. It&rsquo;s unfortunate how things played out, but I&rsquo;m happy to see the growth he&rsquo;s made.</p>

These comments aren’t nearly as incendiary as other threads suggested, but they still strike me as disingenuous: He talks about how he shouldn’t have expected people to be there for him, giving him advice, but it’s pretty well known that Kyrie put up barriers between himself and people who could have helped him.</p>

<p>The problem isn’t that he wasn’t proactive in trying to work with people improve his situation—it’s that he was proactive in keeping it from happening. </p>

<p>New York (AFP) – Resigned to the villain&rsquo;s role in Boston, Dallas star Kyrie Irving is less concerned with silencing hostile Celtics fans than with quieting self doubt and leading the Mavs in a must-win NBA Finals game five.</p>

I think he was pretty in tune with the historical culture of greatness at the time as well.

<p>Does that cancel out all of the disrespectful shit Kyrie <em>has</em> said and done in regards to Boston? No. There&rsquo;s no overreaction here. There&rsquo;s being a heel, and then there&rsquo;s disrespecting a franchise and its legacy after having the privilege to play on their behalf. You don&rsquo;t wipe your sneaker on our logo&rsquo;s face and get any more &ldquo;overrections&rdquo; out of us. Fuck Kyrie.</p>

No one bags an eye when you say you believe in God, Allah,     or any other choice for deity, but if you say the earth is flat all of a sudden you’re a horrible person</p>

      <label for="l8xq79l" class="commentText"><p>Dude what are you talking about? Just as the flat earth theory is disproven very clearly by science, so are most religious ideas. Ex. God created humans from dust, and breathed life into them, adam and eve etc. are all disproven by the theory of evolution, and the bones and skeletons of our ancestors.</p>

<p>Again I could give two shits what people believe in. Which is why I don&rsquo;t judge Kyrie for his flat earth theory either, but this is not a false equivalence lol.</p>

<p>You talk about religion but a few days ago, people were making fun of Kyries religious native-american beliefs calling them stupid. The majority of this subreddit isn&rsquo;t arguing in good faith when it comes to anything Kyrie related. Also at least his flat earth beliefs arent hurting anyone, unlike religious beliefs that result in abortion rights being taken away, misogyny, homophobia, just to name a few.</p>

      <label for="l8xtmpg" class="commentText"><p>Theres also no proof that the flying spaghetti monster doesn&rsquo;t exist. You see how illogical, and frankly how dangerous that frame of reasoning is? Also theres a plethora of evidence that contradicts statements from most major world religions. There IS proof that humans evolved over millions of years and not molded by god with dirt and clay.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t care what you believe. I don&rsquo;t care what Kyrie believes. But what you&rsquo;re saying is just illogical.</p>

      <label for="l8xu0eu" class="commentText"><p>What are you talking about?  I agree, you can&rsquo;t conclusively prove a negative.  It&rsquo;s impossible to conclusively prove that God doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s a false equivalence to the earth not being flat.  The earth cannot be both flat and spherical, and there IS objective evidence that the earth is spherical, which logically concludes that it can&rsquo;t be flat.  It&rsquo;s not the same type of argument at all and the fact that you keep trying to stretch this parallel means you don&rsquo;t really understand either argument</p>

      <label for="l8xuqzu" class="commentText"><p>Thats not the point of this entire thing though. Lets bring it back to this post. Its about Kyrie and his beliefs about the earth being flat (which I think are stupid and don&rsquo;t agree with).</p>

<p>If tomorrow, Kyrie goes to the media and says he believes theres an immortal being that lives in the centre of the sun and watches over us, there would be a 5000+ comment thread ridiculing Kyrie for his beliefs DESPITE the fact that there is no way to conclusively prove this, since we will never be able to see the core of the sun.</p>

<p>The point I&rsquo;m trying to argue is when it comes to Kyrie, people hate absolutley anything he says. There was a thread a few days ago about people making fun of him burning sage as part of his native american religion. The fact you fail to comprehend the premise of this is baffling.</p>
