<p>How many from Jokic bullshit shots?</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t actually JOKIC.   It was all Jamal Murray and MPJ against the Lakers.  MPJ turned into Kevin Durant in that series, and Murray is annoying as fuck.  He could be TRASH all game but gets hot in the 3rd or 4th quarters of a close game.</p>

<p>Lakers dominated and led most of that series against the Nuggets, but lost 3 games in the 4th Quarters, because of Jamal Murray.  2 of them was game winners.   He even got the lucky bounce and everything</p>

      <label for="lrim7ym" class="commentText"><p>Jokic averaged 28/16/10 on 67.2% TS which are video game numbers</p>

<p>He wasn&rsquo;t the one to hit the actual buzzer beaters (which is normal for a center even Shaq didn&rsquo;t) but it absolutely wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;all Murray and MPJ&rdquo; lol</p>

<p>The way Jokic scores by just flipping in floaters might not feel as noticeable as Murray or MPJ hitting tough contested jumpers so it might not SEEM like he averaged more points overall but he did</p>

<p>Saying that Murray and MPJ were better than Jokic is similar to the &ldquo;Kyrie led the Cavs in 2016&rdquo; fallacy where people just remember the last 2 minutes and not the 46 minutes that led up to it</p>

<p>Especially this is true because Murray was a HUGE reason the Lakers had big leads to begin with</p>

      <label for="lrku0l6" class="commentText"><p>I can see both sides. Virtually every LeBron drive is an offensive foul and a defensive foul at almost the same time. if you&rsquo;re rooting for LeBron, there&rsquo;s an uncalled defensive foul to get mad about; if you&rsquo;re rooting against LeBron, there&rsquo;s an uncalled offensive foul (and often a called defensive foul to get mad about). Refs typically let them play since who wants to see LeBron foul out in the first quarter with 7 points on <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> free throws of every <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> call gets a whistle. That famous play with Hinrich when LeBron was on the Heat is a great example &ndash; afterwards, LeBron was clutching his pearls, claiming it was an open field tackle. But it could have easily been an offensive foul. Shaq and Giannis are the same way. To be honest, I think Giannis gets too many calls, and I think he should be reffed more like LeBron.</p>

<p>I think there is a subconscious bias on the refs just because a player looks big and strong they dont call as much fouls as opposed to players who look small. That is my theory maybe some advanced stats guys can analyze the numbers if true. haha</p>

      <label for="lrjg2qv" class="commentText"><p>Do you think there&rsquo;s some kind of a relationship between foul baiting over the regular season and playoff ability to get the calls?</p>

<p><strong>(That&rsquo;s a genuine question btw).</strong></p>

<p>Meaning, the more you &ldquo;cry wolf&rdquo; during regular season, the more the people get tired of it or don&rsquo;t believe you when you actually do &ldquo;act a bit/sell the foul or contact&rdquo; to get the call when it matters the most in a rough playoff game?</p>

<p>Maybe the ref got used to Lebron being so dominant that they don&rsquo;t call him as often.</p>

<p>But maybe he understands that if you need to sell a foul/contact, it&rsquo;s better to save it for the important moments?<br>
The ones that define a legacy.</p>

<p>Like, who cares for 5 more FTs a night if nobody gives them to you in the final when your team needs it?</p>

<p>Also usually negatively impacts your image for some fans (Harden/Embiid are two examples).</p>

<p>It puts a small asterisk on your accomplishments for some people, and I guess you don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re Harden or Embiid:</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll be remembered as a great player, and people won&rsquo;t care in 20 years.</p>

<p>But in the GOAT convo? Every detail matters?</p>

Based on <a href="https://x.com/AndrewDBailey/status/1772275077280858370" target="_blank">this data</a> for net free throws The Lakers were about 3.23 standard deviations out from the mean. I would love to hear the justification you have for claiming this is not an outlier, because 3+ sigma is generally considered well into outlier territory. You want to actually talk stats or are you just going to stick to ad hominems?</p>

      <label for="lrj9i9q" class="commentText"><p>It’s a differential you muppet lmao.</p>

<p>If there’s nothing statistically fishy about how many FTs the Lakers got and nothing statistically fishy about how many FTs the Lakers gave up then it means it’s entirely possible for a team to play in such a way to faily earn as many FTs as the Lakers did and fairly give up as many FTs as the Lakers did.</p>

<p>As evidenced by the fact that some random Hornets team a few years back had a higher FT differential than last year’s Lakers.</p>

<p>We even saw the Lakers’ FT differential dip back the other way during their horrible post IST stretch where they were starting Reddish-Vando-AD and couldn’t get anything at the rim cos the spacing sucked.</p>

<p>This year there’s going to be way more DHOs, spot ups and off-screen shots with an emphasis on getting shots at the basket off of cuts. That might be somewhat counteracted by more offensive rebounds but I’d still expect LA to get fewer FTs.</p>

<p>On defense the Lakers are going to be more versatile in coverages which means less drop so giving up more FTs + probably playing more high energy defenders like Christie and Vincent which also means more FTs. How much do you want to bet the Lakers don’t lead the league in FT differential and not a single soul gives a flying fuck about which team does ?</p>

<p>Yeah its a meaningful differential! It means that somehow The Lakers were consistently shooting *way more* free throws than they gave up. If your contention is just that is just a random fluctuation then there is still plenty of grounds for me to remain skeptical because there is less than a 0.1% chance of a 3.2 sigma outlier happening being observed from a normal distribution. Are you really asking me to weigh a less than <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1000</sub> chance that this happens randomly versus The Lakers just getting a favorable whistle? Because if so&hellip; hmmmmmm&hellip;</p>

<p>Were the Hornets a 3.2 sigma outlier?</p>

<p>I would also love to have a look at your source data for this claim:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They weren’t outliers at all in FTs attempted or FTs given up.</p>

<p>Rarely do players go that extremely hot and cold in pretty much back to back months like that. Klay Thompson was similar in that sense, where his overally shooting stats are strong but he was also awful for a long part of the season before catching fire</p>

<p>The Lakers ultimately go as he goes or at least that has been the case for a while now.</p>

<p>But in the playoffs, DLO is two-face from batman. In odd number games, he looks like a star. Then in even games, he becomes Emmanuel Mudiay. Marked improvement from him not belonging in the playoffs at all</p>

      <label for="lrif9oa" class="commentText"><p>I hate when people counter with your “argument”</p>

<p>Like name another team who’s coach sabotaged their lineup. Played starting lineups that consisted of only 1 shooter, starting lineups that had no point guards, didn’t play the obviously 5 best players, didn’t call timeouts or use challenges. For fucks sake he played cam reddish (shud be out of the league) Taurean Prince (shud be a 12 min a night player) and Vando(zero offense) as starters every game for heavy minutes.</p>

<p>This isnt “oh my Bucks had a 2-7 stretch let’s just take that out.” This is a coach trying his hardest to piss off his team.</p>

<p>“OF cOUrse Every teAM WIL be Beter OF you TaKe out THere worST sTReTch”</p>

<p>Ham did everything possible to lose during that 13 game stretch. This is not the same as a team just simply having a poor shooting stretch. This is the not the same as a team having too many road games. This is not the same as having injuries. This is not the same as players being tired and and logging too many minutes. This isn’t a team having too many games against top teams</p>

<p>This was all on Darvin</p>

<p>Darvin Ham had a bad coaching stretch and you want to blame absolutely 110% of every single of those 10 losses solely on him and nothing but him is hilarious.</p>

<p>You know what my bad, you&rsquo;re right bro, why stop there: the Lakers went 47-35 that year. If LeBron didn&rsquo;t miss those 11 games Lakers would have gone 71-11 if DARVIN HAMAS wasn&rsquo;t the coach &amp;gt;:(</p>

<p>But darvin did cost us at least 4-5 wins</p>

<p>We had a healthy rui playing like 15 minutes
Max not getting any minutes and Cam and prince getting 30+</p>

<p>I like prince but 30 minutes a game?</p>

<p>He would see the team gassed and allowing a 12-2 run and wouldn’t call time out</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s such a bizzare statement to make. If you are consistantly winning clutch games, that means you have some great late game execution. He says &ldquo;clutch situations are <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub>&rdquo;, but honestly, i don&rsquo;t know how true that is. especially if you have guys like lebron (or kyrie and luka who he also bought up).</p>

      <label for="lrj9ag3" class="commentText"><p>This is an important part of the analysis but it feels like it is missing some controls to compare against and fully test the hypothesis. If it turned out the R-squared value for win percentage overall in consecutive seasons was also very low for example, then clutch game performances are not significantly less random than anything else.</p>

<p>If clutch games are a coin toss, there should also be little to no correlation between a team&rsquo;s performance in clutch games and the quality of their performances in the rest of their games that season. This admittedly is testing something a little different, whether there&rsquo;s any correlation between clutch performances and team quality within a season, but is getting at the same core question.</p>

      <label for="lrk6t8z" class="commentText"><p>(note: all of this is done using OLS and data from 2000-present)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>following win% ~ previous win% &ndash;&amp;gt; r-squared of 0.363</p></li>

<li><p>following close win% ~ previous close win% &ndash;&amp;gt; r-squared of 0.027</p></li>

<li><p>following close win% ~ previous close win% + previous win% &ndash;&amp;gt; r-squared = 0.101, prev cg win% not statistically significant</p></li>

<li><p>following win% ~ previous close win% + previous win% &ndash;&amp;gt; r-squared = 0.364, prev cg win% not statistically significant</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So while win percent alone isn&rsquo;t a great predictor of future win percent, it has a stronger relationship than win percentages in close games do. In fact, your previous record in close games isn&rsquo;t statistically significant when predicting future win% if you also include your overall win%</p>

<p>Within a single season, non-close game win % vs close game win % has a r-squared value of 0.184. That&rsquo;s a relatively stronger relationship than year over year close game win%, but it&rsquo;s weaker than you&rsquo;d expect for an in-season sample. For context, if you take a random sample of 20 games (the approx. number of close games each plays per season) and compare the in-sample win% against the out of sample win% for each team, you get an r-squared of ~0.5.</p>

One clarification question, is the unsquared r value / correlation coefficient positive in all these instances? Even some of the weaker relationships would be more surprising if they were somehow negative. Would help support the popular idea in this thread that a good close game winning percentage might even be a predictor of less wins the following year, though I think lack of year over year correlation already suggests that.</p>

      <label for="lrlk2eo" class="commentText"><p>So, all of the regressions I ran are positively correlated on a league level, but some smaller sections of the data (ie looking at it for individual teams or players) have negative correlations. Interestingly, Lebron&rsquo;s teams have a negative coorelation (again, with a very small r^2 ) in close game win% year over year. So in general all the relationships are positive, but some subsets have negative correlations (albeit with much smaller sample sizes, so you can&rsquo;t really take that much from them)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I think this is somewhat true but moreso when you narrow the definition of a &ldquo;clutch&rdquo; game - if you look at like 2 possession games that&rsquo;s probably a very true statement, but the NBA stats definition used for this record is quite broad: any game where the score was within 5 points in the final 5 minutes. They definitely filter out possessions where a game swings between clutch and not clutch, but I&rsquo;m fairly certain that for this any game that meets that criteria <em>at any point</em> in the 5 minutes would qualify.</p>

<p>Which is a long winded way of saying that the best teams will tend to (roughly) correlate year over year, 2022-2023 for example your top five was:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bucks</li>
<li>Celts</li>
<li>76ers</li>
<li>Nets</li>
<li>Nuggets</li>
</ol>

<p>And the Nuggets and Celtics (notably the teams with the most roster continuity) were top five again last year.</p>

<p>Like if the game is close to 200 posessions&hellip;and it come down to ONE shot in x star players hands, like the game went wrong possessions 1-199 not on final shot #200.</p>

<p>Clutch game situations? which are close to half the games of a season, 5 minutes total, yeah I think THAT + the amount of clutch games you&rsquo;re in matters a bit, 5mins of executing properly when it matters most.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in 25 clutch games out of 82, that means you either blew out teams a lot, probably a top seed, or were a lottery team that got blown out often.</p>

<p>IF you&rsquo;re in 48 clutch games the season, that means you just straight up barely lost or won your games, very mid, aka the Bulls Hawks and Warriors exactly how that linked graph showslol .</p>

      <label for="lri9ir3" class="commentText"><p>Clutch games are way more <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> than people give it credit for. Execution is obviously a thing, but what execution gets you is from a 35% 3pt shot to a 45% 3pt shot. The vast majority of the variance comes from the fact that Basketball a game where your 2pt shot goes in about half the time. Hell, single games are basically random. The best teams lose regularly to bad teams on a single game sample size.</p>

<p>If feels like basically every season you&rsquo;ll see some player or team lead in these clutch stats, then come playoff time they way underperform expectations. The Jazz a few years back, the Suns the next year, Donovan Mitchell (or someone like that) one year.</p>

<p>I remember personally watching all the Lakers games and getting the feeling that they got a good bounce more often than not. That didn&rsquo;t make them any worse than they were (wins are wins), but means people put higher expectations on them than they should have.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not wrong to note that clutch games are much more susceptible to random chance because you&rsquo;re suddenly analyzing a &amp;lt;5 minute game instead of a 48 minute one. But at the same time this attitude of dismissing fans who care about it feels pretty soulless.</p>

<p>If you take these statistical conclusions to their logical end, when the games are close in the fourth quarter fans should turn it off because it&rsquo;s folly to watch the outcome of a coin flip and be super invested in it. Watching a game become a blowout is comparatively more meaningful basketball.</p>

Very good clutch team but so many close games, net rating of a 43 win team with a healthy Bron and AD, minimal roster improvements while teams around them have or are fully healthy. Teams that outperform their net ratings and win clutch games like that&hellip;not always sustainable the next year. Although I believe the Lakers have been a good clutch team in their winning seasons since Bron/AD has been there.</p>

      <label for="lrik672" class="commentText"><p>Just for context, that&rsquo;s the highest win % they&rsquo;ve had in regular season clutch games in the Bron era - next closest was going 20-10 in the 19-20 season.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s also despite shooting just 28% from deep in the clutch as a team last year. What they did do was absolutely dominate the free throw line - they had an absurd 0.652 FTR (ratio of FTAs to FGAs), first in the league, next closest was the Mavs at 0.559 (median ~0.442). They also led the league in <em>opponent</em> FTR: just 0.230 for their opponents compared to 0.327 for the next closest team (median ~0.433).</p>

<p>A huge part of that is Bron &amp; AD knowing how to get to the stripe and forcing the issue when the game is on the line, and having a bunch of vets who know how to defend without fouling, but they did not dominate those metrics to that extent in prior season. Will be interesting to see if their whistle is a little less favorable (as it has been in the past) how that hits their clutch performance.</p>

<p>The Lakers were 47-35. This stat tells me they probably weren&rsquo;t even that good. The more clutch games you win the more clutch games you were in, and that&rsquo;s not a good thing.</p>

He said that clutch record varies greatly year to year, and if the lakers have a similar amount of “clutch games” this season, there’s a good chance there’s a regression, which in a stacked western conference, makes a huge difference in the standings</p>

      <label for="lriaqvi" class="commentText"><p>He had clearly lost the locker room, you had AD going to the media telling them that it feels like they don’t know what they’re doing on defense in the playoffs. The team is arguably more offense heavy, yet they had a mediocre offense. His coaching also wasn’t reaching his players, he insisted on playing Reddish big minutes in the beginning of the season when he shouldn’t have, he didn’t adjust Taurean Prince’s minutes when it became clear that he was relying on him too much in games, he benched Reaves, then benched DLO and Reaves in favor of Vanderbilt and Reddish. Some of these are excusable, but all of them together combined with the team losing confidence in you and your decisions says a lot about your coaching decisions.</p>

      <label for="lribw5k" class="commentText"><p>more offense heavy doesn&rsquo;t mean they are a great offense when the team lacks shooters. it just means their offense is better than their defense cause their defense is AD + 4 traffic cones lol</p>

<p>Reddish was always gonna get minutes. that&rsquo;s the entire reason he&rsquo;s signed with Klutch. Lebron was also Cam&rsquo;s biggest hype man</p>

<p>adjust Prince&rsquo;s minutes to what and for who? Prince shot 40% from 3pt on the season btw</p>

<p>yea and they had a terrible record in that stretch starting D&rsquo;Lo. don&rsquo;t see the problem with testing different lineups. that&rsquo;s what reg season is for</p>

<p>is Ham without fault? no. but Lakers fans are scapegoating him entirely when the team simply wasn&rsquo;t that good in the first place</p>
