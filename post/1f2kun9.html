<p>Mahomes called Marino&rsquo;s 1984 the best regular season ever; I think Rodgers did too. And these two have two of the greatest regular seasons ever in Mahomes&rsquo;s 2018 and Rodgers&rsquo;s 2011. So a lunatic who does ayahuasca+locks himself in a dark room for days actually pays more respect to the history of his sport.</p>

<p>It just seems like the NBA is the only sport that has this issue where drama and narrative-based arguments drive just as much engagement as the actual on-court product. Maybe because the audience skews younger? I’m not sure what it is.</p>

      <label for="lk7rmzg" class="commentText"><p>Maybe it doesn’t come to mind because it’s more niche but MMA fans are way worse. At least most basketball fans don’t think rooting for certain players makes you good at basketball.</p>

<p>If you think era arguments are annoying try watching a sport that’s relatively new. Most people don’t understand that when fighters decline, they decline fast. So if a guy was a champion 10 years ago and loses today the extrapolation is that the sport must have really sucked 10 years ago.</p>

<p>NBA fans will joke if there’s a shitty matchup that nobody is going to watch, UFC fans get pissed regardless of skill level if there’s a card and they don’t recognize any names. It’s mind boggling to someone who started watching when there were ten cards a year. People might argue the playoffs are watered down but nobody is arguing that the league should downsize to the 12 most well known teams.</p>

<p>To top it all off you know how every year there’s accusations that big market teams get favorable calls in the playoffs because the NBA wants matchups that will result in ratings? Imagine everytime this was brought up like 30% of the sub not only agreed it was true, but advocated for it. To give you an example Belal Muhammad just won the welter weight (170) belt. He had a 10 fight unbeaten streak (9-0-1) with the draw being to the champion) but because he’s kind of boring stylistically people argued he shouldn’t fight for the belt. When NBA fans complain about play style it’s typically stuff like foul baiting that feels like it takes advantage of the rules. When you UFC fans complain about style they bitch fundamental techniques in the sport. The NBA equivalent would be someone that’s like “I know it’s part of the sport but does anyone find jump shooting boring? I just want to see dunks.”</p>

<p>Take all the worst parts of NBA fandom then add booze, some shitty coke, a tap out t shirt that’s a size too small, and a propensity to live vicariously through others in a way that would make the shittiest little league father blush and that’s your loud contingent of UFC fans.</p>

<p>Like having that guy on the floor should create mental strain on the opponent for how hard their job is about to be</p>

<p>Rudy having such a perimeter weakness in 2024 to me means he&rsquo;s not the best defender even if his rim protection is elite of elite, he can be exploited too easily</p>

Sheed is probably overcorrecting when he says his defense wasn&rsquo;t as good as a lot of guys. He was a very good defender he just wasn&rsquo;t a real dpoy. He was never the best defender in the league. Shit he wasn&rsquo;t even the best defender on the bulls. That goes to scottie and or Rodman</p>

      <label for="lk783iz" class="commentText"><p>So was Jrue Holiday overrated on defense because Jimmy Butler got him?</p>

<p>Great defensive players are meant to get got, because they had the difficult assignment every night, and sometimes players get hot and no one could stop them.</p>

<p>Clyde Drexler scored 42 once on Michael Jordan. Not just 42, but 42/5/9/8/1, while Jordan had 52/8/3/2/3. It was a great position rivalry game back in 1988, similar to Kobe vs Wade in the late 2000s. I am not saying Drexler was Jordan, Kobe or Wade, but of course when he got hot he could score on anybody. He WAS a great player. He WAS that good.</p>

<p>But the other two names Rasheed mentioned were questionable.</p>

<p>Joe Dumars was a great player. He played 70 games against Jordan. But he only scored 25+ points 6 times, and only once did he score 30+ points (precisely 31 points). He did well but I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t say he got Jordan.</p>

<p>JR Rider indeed did very well against Jordan. He scored about 5 more points against Jordan than his average in those years. But it was a total of 5 games only, all in regular seasons. The sample size was way too small to dig anything.</p>

<p>I love Rasheed Wallace, but he definitely doesn&rsquo;t have the most logical takes all the time, and this take is definitely not one of them.</p>

We should not say Jrue Holiday is overrated just because Jimmy Butler got him.</p>

      <label for="lk7qxrp" class="commentText"><p>When you look at the entirety of his career, sure, Jordan probably got beat a fair number of times. Famously, in the 91 Finals, Magic was cooking so bad they had to switch Scottie on to him. But he was an excellent shot blocker at his position, and he consistently had high steal numbers. That, combined with his ability to get up and pressure so well with his athleticism (long time Bulls assistant Johnny Bach called him and Pippen the Dobermans) makes him probably one of the best defensive guards ever. His IQ, athleticism, strength and quick hands meant in high leverage possessions, MJ was probably as destructive any player ever to play. That was probably mitigated by having such a heavy offensive load, and calling MJ overrated because he got beat a couple times is silly.</p>

<p>I mean the most iconic play of his career starts with him stripping the ball from one of the greatest power forwards of all time. This deconstruction of the Jordan mythos is getting out of hand.</p>

      <label for="lk7ys64" class="commentText"><p>My point is that steals don’t inherently make you a great defender.</p>

<p>You made a separate and pretty unrelated point about how not all MVPs are equal and in general are a bad way to compare guys due to inconsistencies in voting. Which I’d agree with completely and tbh would extend to pretty much every award if you’re trying to split hairs by number of accolades…</p>

<p>Still very unrelated tho. Were you trying to do a gotcha?</p>

I think his all defensive selections were probably a couple too many, but a lot of stars you could say the same. Pippen was clearly underrated on D and should have had more than Jordan by a couple.</p>

<p>But this take is pretty off base. Jordan defended his guy at the same position better than most by far. He was a damn thief.</p>

I can see the point of view of how can a guard win dpoy against big men but that particular season jordan had an insane stat record for steals and blocks and his narrative was strong.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t ever think a guard or wing can defend better than a big simply because of the importance of that position and I do think MJ wasn&rsquo;t the best defensive player that year but he was incredible and the season before he did a never before done 200 steals and 100 block season and turned around and did better the season he won dpoy. He was one of the best RIM protectors in the league that season which is crazy to say because he was a guard. The eye test on him at that time was good too because it seemed like that man was everywhere. Like I said before I don&rsquo;t think he was the best defender that year simply because he wasn&rsquo;t a big man but I am happy he got 1 dpoy in his career because he is one of the best of all time.</p>

<p>The same is not true for Jordan. People dug into the games themselves and proved that the numbers didn’t make sense.</p>

<ul>
<li>11/07/87: MJ credited with 6 steals, had 4 in reality</li>
<li>11/20/87: MJ credited with 4 steals, had 1 in reality</li>
<li>01/16/88: MJ credited with 4 steals, had 1 in reality</li>
<li>01/05/88: MJ credited with 4 steals, had 1 in reality</li>
<li>01/07/88: MJ credited with 6 steals, had 3 in reality</li>
<li>02/15/88: MJ credited with 5 steals, had 2 in reality</li>
</ul>

<p>The Haberstroh article goes more in-depth, but yeah it’s absolutely more suspicious stat inflation than anything we’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>And guess what? It’s just 1988. His other seasons are nowhere near as bad. It’s just the season he was openly campaigning for DPOY.</p>

<p>And your response is LeBron assists? What?</p>

<p>An interesting fact I found outside of this article is that the 1988 Bulls had the highest ever recorded steal rate (percentage of opponent turnovers recorded as steals) difference between home and away games. Wasn’t the only case of stat fluffing, but as far as steals go, it seems to be the biggest.</p>
