</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Shout out to u/historical_tip_6347 on the great post re: DeMar Derozan, his addition to the Kings, and his potential playoffs performance and success playing alongside Sabonis and Fox. I believe they will all greatly aid one another.</p>

<p>DeMar was very impressive yesterday in his Kings debut, and so far in camp, the fit looks seamless offensively. The two man game between Domas and DeMar has been every bit as effective as it seemed like it would be on paper very early on. DeMar has never played with a hub like Domas, the spacing provided by Murray, Monk, Ellis, Huerter is at a level he hasn&rsquo;t had around him in years, and the ability of Fox to pressure the rim and break down the defense as well, DeMar got easy looks last night, he is an awesome option with the elbow actions and DHO&rsquo;s the Kings run a lot of, and I believe he&rsquo;s due to have his most efficient season of his career. To me, this is a match made in heaven.</p>

<p>Do you all believe DeRozan has his most efficient season this year for the Kings?</p>

      <label for="lraathp" class="commentText"><p>On the Spurs his volume was lower than usual but he shot a blistering 53% from the field his 2nd season there, which is beyond amazing as someone who does so much work from the mid-range.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t be surprised if he does roughly the same thing on the Kings at his position, and playing with Fox and Sabonis, he’s gonna get some nice open looks in that system.</p>

      <label for="lrbax3n" class="commentText"><p>Ah yes saying “better scorer” is something to take lightly when talking about comps, as if he’s not a significantly better scorer than Lowry ever was. Lowry was a better defender, that’s literally it. There’s nothing else he’s definitively better than Fox at.</p>

      <label for="lrbjgks" class="commentText"><p>Lowry was a <em>much much</em> better defender and also played a much bigger role as the primary playmaker.</p>

<p>Also, for whatever it&rsquo;s worth, Fox&rsquo;s 26.6 ppg last season was good for the 8th best average in the NBA. In &lsquo;15-16, Lowry averaged 21.2 ppg, which was good for the 14th best in the NBA that year.</p>

<p>At his best Lowry was a top 20 scorer in the NBA, while being a top 10 passer, and one of the best and most switchable small guard defenders in the league. He was consistently in the top 20 in advanced stats like BPM.</p>

<p>I think you&rsquo;re underrating Kyle Lowry to prop up your guy.</p>

      <label for="lrbmc1a" class="commentText"><p>His best season Lowry averaged 21 a game on 42% shooting that season. Thats not very efficient.</p>

<p>Fox doesn’t need to be a big time playmaker with sabonis out there taking the pressure off him. There isn’t any scenario where Lowry is a better playmaker than Fox. They are both just as good. No separation there.</p>

<p>But in an offensive driven league, that’s what separates him and Lowry.  Lowry’s defense being better isn’t a good enough reason to say at his prime he’s better than Fox was. That’s just nonsense.</p>

<p>Lowry has a higher career TS% than Fox.</p>

      <label for="lrbq2k5" class="commentText"><p>Fox has been an underrated playmaker. Before sabonis got there, and with him on the team. He just doesn’t have to do as much of it now with sabonis being the Big Man playmaking Hub that the team needs him to  be. That’s the point I’m trying to make. Context is important.</p>

<p>Fox has averaged 6.1 assists his career, Lowry is at 6.2. Again, what kind of separation is there? There’s hardly any for it to be undeniable that he’s truly the better playmaker</p>

<p>And Lowry was the second-third option on those raptor teams, never was the first option. Fox has been the first option on his team since he’s been in the league. They are not the same. He gets guarded by the best defenders on the team. Lowry didn’t have to deal with that kind of load.</p>

<p>TS % is just nonsense when you consider the difference in roles those guys have had on their respected teams.</p>
