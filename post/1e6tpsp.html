If Bron and Savannah did anything right in their lives it would be raising their kids properly. There are people out there with a fraction of the wealth they have that turn out to be entitled monsters but you never hear anything bad about the James kids. Same with kobe and Vanessa&rsquo;s kids, you never hear anything bad. You see them putting in the work to make something of themselves, even though they honestly don&rsquo;t have to.</p>

<p>This nepotism shit is real, but at the end of the day if you didn&rsquo;t put in the work you&rsquo;ll get exposed like North West just butchering the lion King.</p>

<p>Eh, it has nothing to do with Bronny. It&rsquo;s all about his dad and Lakers nepotism.</p>

<p>Bronny just happen to be on the bad end of that stick. Suck that is works that way but it&rsquo;s not a secret, that it does. He is also adult and knew what he&rsquo;s getting himself into.</p>

<p>Remove the last name and just say, <em>&ldquo;Top 20 prospect who had a cardiac arrest and was out for most his freshman year had some stinkers when he finally recovered&rdquo;</em> and I don&rsquo;t see a compelling reason he goes undrafted in a class this weak.

<p>Remove his last name like you said, and he probably never plays at Sierra Canyon. A lot of his highschool career was the product of connections because of Lebron.</p>

<p>Not to say he was bad in high school, even though he didn&rsquo;t have flashy numbers, it&rsquo;s somewhat understandable because of how stacked Sierra Canyon was with talent, there&rsquo;s only one ball.</p>

Not a two way . Other teams had interest but only as a two way so they were told not to draft him. Similar case to TJD to the warriors. Or even reaves to lakers.

<p>On the pressure side, the whole year people were basically talking about where Bronny would go and would his dad go to that team. I can’t imagine any 18 year old not get impacted by that.</p>

<p>Or maybe it was just a lame duck mentality. We saw it with Ben Simmons at LSU. He knew he was the first pick (and Bronny knew someone would draft him or Klutch would pull strings) so why even try.</p>

You have guys coming in the first round who absolutely need the ball in their hands to shine, and whilst some of them are defintently going to be star players, you also need to find guys who do the dirty work.</p>

<p>Bronny knows he&rsquo;s not the star player right now, and he&rsquo;s willing to do the other stuff that teams look for coming off the bench. Getting those reps in and he&rsquo;ll be a great player to have</p>

<p>Tbh, I really don&rsquo;t blame Jaylen for not walking it back because at the time he made the comment, Bronny had been playing like straight-up ass in Summer League games. Bronny has definitely picked it up the last 2 games, but at the time Jaylen wasn&rsquo;t wrong about Bronny&rsquo;s legitimacy as an NBA-ready player. Makes sense why he didn&rsquo;t try to correct the record.</p>

<p>Oh, I would actually &ldquo;blame&rdquo; him if he would. Dude is known for standing to his own opinion and this one was said in private, he was perfectly entitled to have it.</p>

<p>I understand he meant no disrespect but changing your opinion 180 under pressure is not a good look.</p>

<p>People need to know the difference. Heart attack would have caused irreversible damage to the heart tissue which could have damn well caused him to no ball again.</p>

<p>Cardiac arrest can happen due to many different thing. It’s basically the disruption of the electrical current that allows the heart to beat causing the heart to not work until it can possibly be restarted.( this was me trying in simple terms describe it)</p>

<p>but it is by far and away the most egregious example of it, he&rsquo;s a second round pick not projected to contribute anything, and LeBron is at worst the second greatest player in nba history actively still playing at a high level. how and why are people so mad over this</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t give a fuck if it was MJs son, Kobes son or any other all time great&rsquo;s son, a second round pick is not enough to kick up a nepo shit storm over</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure the guys scrapping for a contract don&rsquo;t see it that way lol. A late second round pick getting a 3 year guaranteed contract before he&rsquo;s played a single second of NBA ball would be frustrating. Life isn&rsquo;t fair and never has been but it&rsquo;s still a bad feeling to see it on such a big stage and being insinuated as being deserved in any way.</p>

<p>Calling a spade a spade is the move here, imo (which you&rsquo;ve done)</p>

      <label for="ldvuf3s" class="commentText"><p>So, I would like to apologize to Bronny James. Granted he played so bad after the media talked about him none stop. But I was legimately questioning for a moment if LeBron just brainwashed ESPN after his initial play and seeing his stats in college and high school. Still needs some G-league development, but he isn&rsquo;t the worst player in summer league and tbh seems like worthy 2-way contract player.  Time to direct the critism to Alex Sarr </p>

<p>Edit: Dalton Knecht looks NBA ready, and tbh if we have a 2 way slot I wouldn&rsquo;t mind picking up Collin Castleton.</p>
