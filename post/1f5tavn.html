      <p>I mean you hear the East is weak narrative all the time. How come the west was rarely weak throughout most if not all of this century? When did the &ldquo;weak east&rdquo; narrative begin?</p>

      <label for="lkvami0" class="commentText"><p>There are a bunch of reasons. One of the major ones is that the stronger conference reinforces itself.</p>

<p>In a weak conference, you can make moves that mortgage your future, trading picks/signing floor-raising players, that will get you to the 6-8 seed. In the West, that doesn&rsquo;t work, since signing a past their prime vet won&rsquo;t help enough to break through. This incentivizes Eastern teams to make moves that won&rsquo;t win championships, while it forces Western teams to build better.</p>

<p>Look at what the Rockets have had to build to not make the playoffs last year vs what the Bulls have done.</p>

<p>A better conference forces teams to build better to even qualify, while a weaker conference rewards short-sighted moves.</p>

<p>The draft positions are also affected. The teams at the bottom of the West have brutal schedules, there aren&rsquo;t many easy games. While in the East, even the bottom of the playoff bracket is beatable. This means the bottom of the West have a tanking advantage. Even the playoff teams gain (if the 7th seed in the West is comparable to the 4th in the East, they still get better draft position).</p>

<p>While both conferences have their share of poor owners, I think the East has a few more.</p>

<p>Combine ownership, schedule difficulty, and the forced requirements to even make the playoffs, plus everything else listed here and you get what we have.</p>

      <label for="lkvcqdy" class="commentText"><p>This is the correct answer. Further expanding on the draft issue, the lottery reinforces conference strength. Almost never were the 7-8 teams in the east top 16 teams in the league but they made the playoffs so they don’t get a lottery pick. Conversely, the 9-10 teams in the west are usually borderline top 15 teams in the league but they get to load up on more talent through the lottery</p>

      <label for="lkvu3rk" class="commentText"><p>The East for sure has had really bad ownership for the most part.</p>

<p>The Magic are finally relevant again for the first time in over a decade.</p>

<p>The Wizards haven&rsquo;t been good since Wall and Beal shared the court and prior to that were middling even with that Arenas led group.</p>

<p>Charlotte has been a joke of a franchise.</p>

<p>Miami has good quality despite having absolutely done nothing the last couple of off-season when they should have gone all-in.</p>

<p>Atlanta has been stable but the Young era has had plenty of ups and downs, mostly downs.</p>

<p>Pacers have been damn solid since I started watching NBA 20 years ago.</p>

<p>Pistons have been a joke since that Iverson trade.</p>

<p>Bulls have mostly been shit since Rose had that injury.</p>

<p>Cavs have done well for themselves since LeBron left the 2nd time. They were a joke the first time he left.</p>

<p>Bucks were interesting for a moment but it didn&rsquo;t lead them anywhere until they got Giannis.</p>

<p>Nets overall have been a rich franchise that have thought that buying stars would equate to winning. They haven&rsquo;t done anything relevant since switching to Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Knicks have finally turned the corner a few years back with Randle, then Brunson and possibly with OG and Mikal. First time they&rsquo;ve been threatening since that short time Carmelo was there.</p>

<p>Celtics have always been relevant seemingly.</p>

<p>Raptors did well for a while now look lost.</p>

<p>Sixers process years were brutal but might bear fruit this season.</p>

      <label for="lkvxj5h" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, the real answer has been that over a third of Eastern Conference owners are happy using their team as a piggy bank that shits out 100m a year while there are basically no owners like that in the West. Then another few like to stay competitive enough but feast on the &ldquo;we&rsquo;re too small to compete with big markets&rdquo; excuse; again, that basically doesn&rsquo;t happen in the West. The two worst offenders were the Warriors and Kings, both of whom have become significantly better, and were never not trying to be good.</p>

<p>Players obviously do want to live there, but the Knicks have been terrible for some 40 years outside of some brief periods where they are competitive (including this current one).</p>

<p>But then that&rsquo;s where point number 2 comes into play, and I think point number 2 is probably more important.</p>

      <label for="lkv9klh" class="commentText"><p>I think it just comes down to there happening to be more good front offices/ownerships in the west over the past 25 years. The east has franchises like the Hornets, the Wizards, the Bulls being owned by a guy who is content with mediocrity, and so on. If there were more Heat and Celtics-type franchises in the east then the east would&rsquo;ve been strong this whole time too.</p>

<p>I disagree with the people saying the west has more appealing cities and that&rsquo;s why. 3 of the top 10 teams in the NBA since 2000 by win % are San Antonio, Utah, and OKC.</p>

<p>And while I personally think the West <em>does</em> have more appealing cities, I’m of the mind it’s the climate, culture, politics, and locality to nature that are bigger draws for athletes — and more importantly, their families that move with them.</p>

Teams like the Lakers, Spurs, and Warriors have had star players and smart management. Great draft picks and key trades have also bolstered their strength.

      <label for="lkvmgw9" class="commentText"><p>Nah, it&rsquo;s that the nba added 5 expansion teans to the east from 88 which just crushes the conferences quality. All the teams that would have exited their natural playoff cycle were suddenly pushed up in the standings by having more bottom feeders below them. And because more quality teams moved west, you could make consistently short sighted moves to temporarily improve and get in to the backend of the play in mix.</p>

<p>And because in the west you have to be better to make the playoffs it forces coherent long term strategy to actually make the playoffs. Even if you suck as an owner the shot term moves don&rsquo;t pan out so you are stuck at the bottom which gives you mroe chance of lucking into stars and good role players.</p>

Eastern teams were known for halfcourt defense and post play.
The west also had coaches to liked to run like Donnie Nelson, Westphal, Westhead, D&rsquo;Antoni, etc. When a roster is set up to run, usually you look for a coach that likes to run and each side perpetuates the other.</p>

<p>The West was seen as a soft, showboating conference back in the 80’s and early-90’s, but a lot of those organizations made efforts to be taken more seriously and it manifested in the late-90’s to early-00’s. It’s been the better Conference since, although as it ages the East might finally see some superiority in upcoming years.</p>

<p>Thats really about it. The only really good one is Boston. The reast range from solid with the 76ers (though even they are a bit shaky) to mediocre with the Pistons (nowadays being really bad) and the Knicks being ok. Maybe you could argue Cavs, thoigh that shit was just the pure luck of drafting Lebron and then later Kyrie, but they just couldnt build shit around Lebron the first time around. They are fine nowadays though.</p>

<p>Compare them to like thw Mavs that always managed things with Dirk and being insanely good with drafting Luka, trading for Kyrie when his stock was low and some other great decisions (though not without faults).</p>

<p>The Lakers speak for themselves. Mistakes were made, Kobe, Shaq, Gasol, Lebron and AD are just some of the more notable names on the Lakers this past century and many more excelent and sought after roleplayers too.</p>

<p>The Spurs were the longest lived dynasty rhat refused to die, winning in 3 difrent decades. Had they not had their falling out with Kawhi they never would have stoped winning. Now they even lucked out with Wemby for another shot at a dynasty or just winning in general.</p>

<p>The Warriors speak for themselves and i dont need to explain why they are pne of the best.</p>

<p>Point being the west just drafts better, makes better trades and their gambles pay off.</p>

<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t really mean the East isn&rsquo;t weak but you&rsquo;d expect that the West would win all those championships the way people talk about the West.</p>

Remember the Melo trade and how the Nuggets made out like bandits? Nets mortgaging their futures to get KG and Pierce.</p>

It is easier to get 20k when X million population is relatively closer to the game. A similar effect is seen in local tv viewers. Since the bulk of a teams revenues are ticket sales and local TV contacts, western teams have to try harder since their media markets are much larger geographically.</p>

<p>Western teams need to offer fans a better value proposition than eastern teams do, which leads to them investing more in competitiveness</p>

      <label for="lkwh25f" class="commentText"><p>I think Lebron had something to do with it. His dominance had a depressive effect on other team&rsquo;s willingness to spend money. And on free agents wanting to be in the East.</p>

<p>Celtics and Sixers are prime examples. They should have been heavy hitters, but Lebron going to Miami sent them both into tank mode.</p>

<p>The effect might not be as clearcut with other teams, but its still there. It seemed more rewarding to focus on positioning themselves to compete after Lebron passed his prime &hellip; but oh wait .. he stayed at prime level for too long.</p>

<p>The string of 12 seasons where the West had a winning record against the east finally ended in 2022, shortly after Lebron left the East.</p>

<p>You’re basically down 3 teams that should be perennial contenders due to their location as FA destinations. 10 years ago lebron was close to going to Chicago, and now they have 0 future and 0 players worth watching.</p>

<p>On the other hand the big western markets (LA/LA/SF) have been extremely well run over the last 30 years.</p>

<p>Expect this to change with the lakers as Jeanie buss continues her run.</p>

<p>Knicks even now are really poorly run. They could have held their chips in for Joel embiid who is probably asking out next year and had 2 top 10 guys but instead they decided to spend their money and picks on role players which just makes them late 2010s Toronto with a borderline t10 guy, a useless playoff dropper, and some elite role players.</p>

<p>I think you could say that if the Lakers didn&rsquo;t make it out of the west in 4 of those years, the west team would&rsquo;ve still been favorites in the finals - 00-02 and 2020. The 02 Kings for example would&rsquo;ve crushed the Nets that year no question in my mind.</p>
