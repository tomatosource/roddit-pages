    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Because LeBron and Curry have essentially won 8 of the last 14 championships, there aren’t a ton of champions. A lot of fans favorite player haven’t won a ring. I could be wrong but it’s kind of crazy that there’s 3 former mvps who have yet to win one.</p>

<p>Just this list of how talented these guys are</p>

<p>Chris Paul - top 5 mvp voting 5x, 12X all star</p>

<p>Westbrook - MVP, 9X all star</p>

<p>Harden- MVP, 3X second in mvp, 10x all star</p>

<p>Paul George - 3rd in mvp voting once, 9x all star</p>

<p>Embiid- mvp, 2x 2nd in mvp, 7x all star.</p>

<p>Butler/ Dame/Demar</p>

<p>Then the next gen
Luka</p>

<p>Booker</p>

<p>SGA</p>

<p>Ant</p>

<p>Brunson</p>

<p>Mitchell</p>

<p>Ja</p>

<p>Haliburton</p>

<p>Trae</p>

<p>I’m sure I’m forgetting some, but there’s so much talent without rings, it’s insane. Maybe this is common? But most likely your favorite teams best player hasn’t won and will start to change the Ring discourse. That’s my theory. It’ll take time though</p>

      <label for="lmk69f7" class="commentText"><p>This happens sometimes in basketball.</p>

<p>I remember when MJ won six rings in the 90s, for a while ther you didn&rsquo;t hear people use &ldquo;no rings&rdquo; arguments against people like Barkley, Stockton, Malone, Gary Payton etc.</p>

<p>I think when one or two teams dominate for a long time, it creates too many situations where certain fan bases are painfully aware that someone like Gary Payton is a better basketball player than say Ron Harper, despite the easily explainable ring gap.</p>

<p>What???? Since when lol</p>

<p>Why do you think Karl Malone wanted to go to the Lakers so bad</p>

<p>Why do you think Barkley was on the Rockets?</p>

<p>Why do you think The Glove went to play with Shaq twice over?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Rings argument is mainly an argument between the players who define a contending team. No one is going to legitimately argue that a role player (I know Harper was a star pre bulls dw) is better than an all time great because they got more rings playing next to someone like MJ</p>

      <label for="lmk7g5i" class="commentText"><p>Ring culture will never die, as long as superstars are as important as they are when it comes to winning games and winning playoff series.</p>

<p>All time greats like Lebron, MJ, Kobe, Duncan, Bird, Magic, Shaq etc have all added 30 to sometimes 40 wins to their regular season teams and are often the only reason why their squads win playoff series at all.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like other sports, where a superstar is often just an elite version of their specific role, which is one part of a bigger machine. Basketball superstars play all facets of the game, it&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re so awesome to watch.</p>

<p>Even more so, when all time great players often finish their careers with 4-6 rings. Often beating out several other all time greats to do so.</p>

      <label for="lmk83ht" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s mainly because of an unprecedented era of parity + only one new dynasty since 2010.</p>

<p>Lakers and Spurs winning 5 a piece is unprecedented as it gets though. Every decade since the 60s features at least one dynasties&rsquo; core picking up 1 ring in each decade. (if that makes sense, it sounds terrible, ill try word it better)</p>

<p>They won 5 each through 99-14. It&rsquo;s wild.</p>

<p>Simple minds feel the need to make things black and white. Look at Shaq. Dude is a full blown idiot, but casual fans agree with him when he disses anyone who doesn&rsquo;t have a ring.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just a modern day thing. How many 90s greats were denied a ring because Jordan existed in that decade? So many all time greats, still worthy of the title of all time great.</p>

<p>If you didn&rsquo;t think Rings mattered that much, you&rsquo;d rate Karl Malone much higher than you currently do (wherever that is ofc)</p>

      <label for="lmk8gb2" class="commentText"><p>It is actually pretty common. Most decades have 2 or 3 dominant teams and then there are some teams on the edge or a period of transition until another dynasty pops up</p>

<p>80s it was Magic and Bird with 5 and 3 championships respectively. With Sixers and Pistons as those edge teams.</p>

<p>90s it was MJ and the Bulls, with Houston as the edge team.</p>

<p>San Antonio started in the late 90&rsquo;s and went into the 00&rsquo;s with 5 championships (though the 5th came in &lsquo;14, I&rsquo;d say at that point they were more of an edge team themselves) and you had the Shaq and Kobe Lakers in the 00&rsquo;s as well, with Kobe coming back for 2 more later in the decade.</p>

<p>In the 10&rsquo;s it was Steph and whoever Lebron was playing for at the time between the Heat, Cavs, and Lakers.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re kind of in that transition period at the moment, with a bunch of teams looking like they might take the next step up, but learning that dynasties are really hard to build. Could the Celtics have another dynasty? Can the Bucks and Nuggets win another? Are there young teams on the rise that will take over? This is what makes periods like this so interesting IMO, we don&rsquo;t know the result from season to season.</p>

<p>TLDR - Most decades have a couple of dominant dynasties.</p>

      <label for="lmk9adh" class="commentText"><p>Jeez mate that&rsquo;s a big question. I&rsquo;m sure there are some stat focused accounts that you could ask, but I&rsquo;m not one of them. I&rsquo;m just old enough to grow up in the 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s. It would be interesting to know though.</p>

<p>EDIT - Actually, that&rsquo;s a really easy one to answer it turns out.</p>

<p>Iverson in 00-01</p>

<p>Garnett in 03-04</p>

<p>Nash in 04-05 and 05-06</p>

<p>As u/<em>Meece</em>  points out, Dirk in 06-07 as well.</p>

<p>For a few season before Garnett went to the Celtics and won a ring there, those <del>3</del> 4 were all MVPs without a ring.</p>

<p>EDIT 2 - 90s as well with Barkley, Malone, and Robinson, until the Spurts won their first in 99</p>
