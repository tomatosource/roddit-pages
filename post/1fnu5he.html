    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I’ve often heard Rockets fans point out that the narrative flip between 2015 and 2017 and 2019 was unfair on Harden as the criterias such as team record and individual stats were all inconsistently valued against Harden, and to some degree, there is a some truth in that.</p>

<p>In 2015 and 2019, Harden had better stats than Steph and Giannis. In 2017, Harden had the better record against Westbrook. He lost all three. Which one should he feel most “robbed” about?</p>

      <label for="lokx8qa" class="commentText"><p>2017 IMO because the Rockets actually had a LOWER preseason win over/under than OKC lol</p>

<p>The idea that Harden had a great supporting cast that year was only created later in the season so he almost in a way got punished by his team exceeding expectations by so much</p>

<p>At the start of the year Houston being bad outside Harden was every bit as much the consensus as OKC being bad outside Westbrook</p>

<p>If we operated on expectations then Shai would be the mvp right now and not the guy who just won a ring</p>

      <label for="lokxsti" class="commentText"><p>at the time, i thought he deserved it in 2015</p>

<p>mainly cause i hadn&rsquo;t fully appreciated Steph as a superstar yet and didn&rsquo;t realize just how insane his gravity truly was</p>

<p>also cause he did have an argument anyways, Dwight missed like 40 games, his second guy was like Ariza averaging like 13</p>

<p>2017 - i thought he deserved it and that&rsquo;s one i still think he should have, not that Russ wasn&rsquo;t deserving</p>

<p>o/u was 44 wins, same as the thunder, wins 55 games, great efficiency, if he averaged 2 more rebounds he probably wins it easily which i don&rsquo;t like</p>

<p>i think he probably wins 2019 if they started 14-11 instead of 11-14 imo anyways</p>

<p>so 2017 is the one i&rsquo;d go with</p>

      <label for="lokxz48" class="commentText"><p>2017 was probably the most deserved of those three.</p>

<p>Him and Russ accounted for a similar amount of points, yet Harden was significantly more efficient. He was also only 1.9 RPG off a triple double himself, but not actually getting the achievement made his case uglier.</p>

<p>The Rockets’ supporting cast wasn’t much greater than OKC’s either, both stars were carrying. And Harden’s individual record of 54-27 stands out a lot more than Russ’ 46-35.</p>

<p>But that’s a very retrospective analysis, Russ had narrative and momentum on his side that whole year <em>(and rightfully so)</em>, so it was never Harden’s to win. But that year had so many amazing regular season performances, Kawhi/LeBron/Curry were excellent as well.</p>

<p>Curry&rsquo;s numbers got heavily deflated by sitting out 4th quarters which is why advanced stats heavily favor Curry that year even if the raw volume totals didn&rsquo;t</p>

<p>The main argument I&rsquo;ve seen is literally &ldquo;well the players voted for Harden&rdquo; when players often have an <em>extremely</em> strong bias towards ISO scorers lol</p>

<p>Like him winning wasn&rsquo;t like if Tatum won last year or if Booker won in 2022 he was legitimately the best player in the league by most advanced metrics</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t think it should be just &ldquo;best player on the best team wins MVP&rdquo; but I also don&rsquo;t think it should be &ldquo;best player on NOT the best team wins MVP&rdquo; either</p>
