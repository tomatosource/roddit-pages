</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I’ve often heard Rockets fans point out that the narrative flip between 2015 and 2017 and 2019 was unfair on Harden as the criterias such as team record and individual stats were all inconsistently valued against Harden, and to some degree, there is a some truth in that.</p>

<p>In 2015 and 2019, Harden had better stats than Steph and Giannis. In 2017, Harden had the better record against Westbrook. He lost all three. Which one should he feel most “robbed” about?</p>

      <label for="lollo1a" class="commentText"><p>nah this is why stats require context. Harden was a terrible leader that year and sold on his team</p>

<p>Started off the season trying to get McHale fired cause Harden was still salty McHale benched him in the 4th quarter of an elimination game in 2015 playoffs as Rockets overcame a 19-point deficit without him</p>

<p>then Harden was also beefing with Dwight and played negative defense all year. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=5VYdhYUS56c" target="_blank">that season was a peak Haren defense masterclass</a></p>

<p>The idea that Harden had a great supporting cast that year was only created later in the season so he almost in a way got punished by his team exceeding expectations by so much</p>

<p>At the start of the year Houston being bad outside Harden was every bit as much the consensus as OKC being bad outside Westbrook</p>

      <label for="lokxz48" class="commentText"><p>2017 was probably the most deserved of those three.</p>

<p>Him and Russ accounted for a similar amount of points, yet Harden was significantly more efficient. He was also only 1.9 RPG off a triple double himself, but not actually getting the achievement made his case uglier.</p>

<p>The Rockets’ supporting cast wasn’t much greater than OKC’s either, both stars were carrying. And Harden’s individual record of 54-27 stands out a lot more than Russ’ 46-35.</p>

<p>But that’s a very retrospective analysis, Russ had narrative and momentum on his side that whole year <em>(and rightfully so)</em>, so it was never Harden’s to win. But that year had so many amazing regular season performances, Kawhi/LeBron/Curry were excellent as well.</p>

      <label for="lokxsti" class="commentText"><p>at the time, i thought he deserved it in 2015</p>

<p>mainly cause i hadn&rsquo;t fully appreciated Steph as a superstar yet and didn&rsquo;t realize just how insane his gravity truly was</p>

<p>also cause he did have an argument anyways, Dwight missed like 40 games, his second guy was like Ariza averaging like 13</p>

<p>2017 - i thought he deserved it and that&rsquo;s one i still think he should have, not that Russ wasn&rsquo;t deserving</p>

<p>o/u was 44 wins, same as the thunder, wins 55 games, great efficiency, if he averaged 2 more rebounds he probably wins it easily which i don&rsquo;t like</p>

<p>i think he probably wins 2019 if they started 14-11 instead of 11-14 imo anyways</p>

<p>so 2017 is the one i&rsquo;d go with</p>

<p>Around 2019 was when his image of being a playoff-choker was well established, Meanwhile Giannis was emerging as an up and coming superstar and was aggressively promoted in pursuit of NBA&rsquo;s globalization. So it wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising if Harden felt he got robbed because of the narrative the league was pushing. In reality, tho, because Bucks had a better record that season and Harden had a disappointing playoff run the prior season after winning his first MVP, he probably had a better shot in 2017 than in 2019.</p>

<p>Curry&rsquo;s numbers got heavily deflated by sitting out 4th quarters which is why advanced stats heavily favor Curry that year even if the raw volume totals didn&rsquo;t</p>

<p>The main argument I&rsquo;ve seen is literally &ldquo;well the players voted for Harden&rdquo; when players often have an <em>extremely</em> strong bias towards ISO scorers lol</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t think it should be just &ldquo;best player on the best team wins MVP&rdquo; but I also don&rsquo;t think it should be &ldquo;best player on NOT the best team wins MVP&rdquo; either</p>

<p>Westbrook winning in 2017 completely screwed MVP discourse IMO because now being on a worse team is seen as a plus</p>

<p>Yeah, if you actually watched the season, which it seems apparent that you didn&rsquo;t, you saw Giannis and his healthy team beat up the Pistons/Bulls/Cavs, who were all bottom-feeders, 4x each, in a pitiful East, while Harden was carrying G-leaguers for half the season while CP3/Capela/Eric Gordon were all out extended time, in an extremely competitive West.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Only thing harden had was scoring more</p>

<p>Pretty reductionist. Harden scored 8.4 ppg more than Giannis. That&rsquo;s a fuck ton more. Any other person averages 36 ppg, they get the MVP, full stop</p>

<p>Bucks won 60+ games that season you think those all came from pistons/bulls/cavs? Why does Giannis get the knock cause his team wa healthy? lol</p>

<p>But by your logic I’m guessing you also think Jokic deserved the mvp over Embiid in 2023 cause he played in the west?</p>

<p>The difference between Luka and Jokic this passed season was also 8 ppg so I’m guess you think Luka deserved mvp as well?</p>

<p>Scoring a lot doesn’t mean you win mvp, again there’s a scoring title for a reason.</p>

<p>It made the idea that MVP is about volume stats first way more popular</p>

<p>If Westbrook didn&rsquo;t set a precedent for the idea that volume stats and how bad your team is matter more than wins and advanced stats nobody would complain about 2019</p>

<p>A HUGE chunk of the 2019 complaints are basically some version of &ldquo;but in 2017 volume stats were all that mattered and seeding didn&rsquo;t why is it different now?&rdquo;</p>
