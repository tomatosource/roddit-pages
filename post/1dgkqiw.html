      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dgkqiw/dell_curry_on_the_wolves_drafting_steph_i_got_a/"><p>Dell Curry on the Wolves drafting Steph: “I got a call from Minnesota [Timberwolves] as well, asking about drafting [Steph], I told them, ‘Please don’t. Please don’t.’ It was [ex-Timberwolves assistant coach] J. B. Bickerstaff. They said, ‘OK, we won’t.’  “</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Golden State gladly was able to draft Steph at No. 7 overall, while the Knicks settled for Jordan Hill with the next pick &ndash; the two have had vastly different professional basketball careers.</p>

<p>Dell’s pleading, however, didn’t stop with the Knicks. He also requested something from the Minnesota Timberwolves, who had the No. 5 and No. 6 picks in 2009.</p>

<p>“I got a call from Minnesota [Timberwolves] as well, asking about drafting [Steph],” Dell added. “I told them, ‘Please don’t. Please don’t.’ It was [ex-Timberwolves assistant coach] J. B. Bickerstaff. They said, ‘OK, we won’t.’</p>

<p>“They didn’t. [They took] two back-to-back point guards.”</p>

<p>Point forwards? Nellie (Paul Pressey in MIL).</p>

<p>Positionless basketball? Nellie (played SFs like Billy Owens and Rod Higgins at C in GS, played lineups with 4 switchable wings - JRich, SJax, Al Harrington, Matt Barnes).</p>

<p>Smallball? Nellie (played 2 PGs together with Baron/Monta and Steph/Monta, played 3-4 guard lineups with Hardaway, Richmond, Marciulionis, Terry Teagle).</p>

<p>Stretch bigs/5-Out offense? Nellie (Dirk, LaFrentz, he even let Manute Bol shoot 3s).</p>

<p>Pace and space? Nellie (Run TMC).</p>

<p>Euro players? Nellie (brought over Marciulionis, worked with the Lithuanian national team).</p>

<p>Player empowerment? Nellie (when Webber demanded a trade because Nellie wanted him to play C instead of PF, Nellie offered to resign rather than have GS lose Webber).</p>

<p>Hack a Shaq? Nellie (he actually first used it against Rodman, not Shaq).</p>

<p>I used to love the Nash - Van Exel backcourt he ran for heavy minutes in Dallas. For point forwards, don&rsquo;t forget Sidney Moncrief in MIL, Owens in GS, and even Anthony Mason in NY (which got him fired for marginalizing Ewing&rsquo;s role in the offense, deservedly so&ndash; every crazy genius has an occasional wild swing and a miss).</p>

It takes real skill to be able to read things like some of them do. They are able to read their ,assistants , trainers ,coaches, players, general manager in a single entity, cohesive unit.</p>

<p>I will say I think it’s easier to manage people when you have nothing else to worry about other than what vacation you want next. But I definitely think it takes a certain mindset to hire and fire people and not have any remorse</p>

<p>Those owners believed in Donny when nobody else did</p>

      <label for="l8s0af5" class="commentText"><p>That year I watched a bunch of college highlights. Curry was like nothing I had ever seen before.  People compared him to Reddick who scored like crazy for Duke after years prior to that and then it didn&rsquo;t translate to the NBA, however Reddick never displayed the handle or the range Curry did. Curry reminded me of Marovich. There was never any doubt in my mind that Curry would be an offensive juggernaut in the NBA. Scouts were like &ldquo;he won&rsquo;t do this in the NBA.&rdquo; And I was like &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s try. Nothing to lose, the Warriors sucked.</p>

<p>In his rookie year at the end of the year when it was Curry + D-League guys he did exactly what he did in college in the NBA and it was glorious. His early career was derailed by coach Smart, a bad fit with Ellis and ankle injuries.</p>

<p>I was so happy when the Warriors got Curry. I didn&rsquo;t even think about winning championships. I was just happy because Curry was entertaining as a player and very unique.</p>

<p>I think as far as pre-nba highlights just completely sticking out and making me think &ldquo;the scouts are wrong.&rdquo; It was only Doncic and Curry that really jumped out as obvious. Like Curry should have been competing for Blake as the no. 1 and Doncic should have been the consensus no. 1 in his draft. Curry&rsquo;s draft ended up being an amazing draft with a whole bunch of great players but Curry and Blake were the only ones that I could really just see they would be guaranteed to be good. Wemby, Zion and LeBron obviously too, but they were consensus no. 1 picks.</p>

<p>evans (25 games) - 19.8 pts 6.2 reb 6.9 ast 1.4 stl on 45/25/68 shooting splits</p>

<p>curry (29 games) - 22.1 pts 5.5 reb 7.7 ast 2.0 stl on 47/44/91 shooting splits</p>

<p>also curry played at an elite level to close out the season as in the last month &amp; 16 games curry averaged</p>

<p>23.6 pts 5.5 reb 8.0 ast 2.3 stl on 49/51/90 shooting splits in 38 minutes</p>

<p>curry was voted rookie of the month 3 times &amp; evans 2 times in <sup>2009</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> yet the latter won rookie of the year though i&rsquo;d guess curry isn&rsquo;t all that upset at this time looking back</p>

I guess between him and Chet is why Jabari was considered the top pick for a very long time until the very end when everyone figured out they were going with Paolo. </p>

<p>Basically the future of Lebron was unclear and they made it known he had no desire to play there from that</p>

<p>Edit: also fun fact the Cavs had a trade lined up for Luka in that draft and said no to the hawks cause they didn’t want to take on Kent Bazmors contract.</p>

<p>So when you look at the opportunities the Cavs had that summer it was truly a brutal offseason lol</p>

      <label for="l8rv7sx" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s sad to hear about the business side of things, basically you want some sort of parity and not just backdoor deals going on all the time. Shai would have been perfect for the Cavs esp rn, they need backcourt length. Not hating on short guards, but unless you have like Derrick Rose athleticism, small market teams I dont believe should be picking guards like Collin Sexton that high. Collin would be great as a backup or playing with a good floor general but not as starting PG himself. Cavs should have went for one of the good wings in that draft I guess if SGA didnt want to go there. They also messed up that Okoro pick badly. We&rsquo;ll see what happens this summer and that&rsquo;ll pretty much decide where the franchise will go in the next couple of years.</p>

<p>But hey at least looking pretty for OKC fans and it is nice to see small market teams trending on the up and up</p>

<p>“I know Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is shooting up draft boards but from what I can tell, it doesn’t seem like he wants to play for the Cavs,” said Windhorst. “He patently refused to work out for them, in fact made a point to tell them he didn’t want to be there.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think because at the time Bron was one foot out in his decision, they chose someone who actually wanted to be there.</p>

<p>Shai was more direct in his approach but Mobley didn’t work out for Cavs either, his team wanted #1 or OKC. They learned from the Shai mistake and selected him anyway.</p>

      <label for="l8rp3zu" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, even if it&rsquo;s not necessarily a black and white deciding factor, it does have to figure into your reasoning at least somewhat how much a player is going to accept and embrace playing for your team. If there are two players you&rsquo;re torn on, something like that could easily be the deciding factor.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true though that the standardized rookie contract scale has largely done away with the more overt power moves around a rookie trying to control where he goes, or use that as leverage to boost their rookie contract. It used to be a huge problem. I think when Jim Jackson was drafted by the Mavs in the 90s he held out from even starting to play games for them and missed a hefty chunk of the regular season (something around 30 games?) until they gave him an unusually fat contract.</p>

<p>Having said that, if you&rsquo;re selecting in the lottery, raw talent and star potential has to be the main consideration. Even at the time, it was laughable to select Flynn over Curry.</p>

Might have kept Rose healthy too, he was so banged up playing through injuries in 2012 there was multiple sports doctors saying his running form was compensating &amp; would lead to injury.</p>

<p>On the other hand Thibs mightve killed Rose, Lebron, Wade, Bosh, &amp; Deng and turned them into an even more epic Roy / Oden Blazers.</p>

<p>Think of LeBron James. He is the first example of success in NBA, yeah? Well, Cavs lost him before the time that everyone associates with his biggest successes really started. While in general no one would say they shouldn&rsquo;t have drafted LeBron, relatively, the benefit of drafting him was not quite the same as having him for the career.</p>

<p>You are allowed to draft a guy, but he is also more or less allowed to pull a Shaq or a T-Mac.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine you have a choice, you can have Shaq for his first 4 years, or Zo who likes the team and if all goes well may stay forever (hey, Zo, another example of a guy who left after just a few years! Do people even remember him in Charlotte colors?). Harder choice to make or not?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I understand what you are saying and I’m not disagreeing with your point, but as I mentioned above, the NBA has changed rules over these last 20 years to try and help teams with this process. </p>

<p>The RFA process is huge because it allows a team to essentially have 8 or 9 years of control for their drafted player. I agree they they can still leave or demand a trade at the end of this (as you mentioned LeBron or even AD recently), but 8-9 years is quite a long time. </p>

<p>Even if a player does not want to re-sign, due to the RFA process, they can essentially match any contract. Yes, the player could take the QO and leave early, but they would be leaving a huge contract and guarantees on the table (which often is a max for a star level player).</p>

<p>This is why although people sometimes speculate so and so will take the QO (Zion Williamson), they end up still taking the max. </p>

<p>There are still other issues to worry about like a disgruntled player like AD but usually they will still be there for the first 8-9 years before acting up. </p>

<p>It used to not be this way though. Back in the early 90s, the Warriors drafted Chris Webber number 1 and his contract had an opt out clause after year 1. He said he would use it, so the Warriors had no choice but to trade him to get something back. The NBA has gone a long way to prevent these things from happening. </p>

      <label for="l8qtahk" class="commentText"><p>Surely the restricted contract means a lot. But definitely the players&rsquo; will means something in the league.</p>

<p>In reality, players are just asking for trades now. For example Porzingis. And, well - just as teams can draft anyone, they can also keep any player and are not forced to honor trade demands. And yet, they often do it, which sometimes has massive consequences to teams.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say hypothetically, you somehow know the future and you can choose LeBron who doesn&rsquo;t wanna be there, or Wade who wants to be there. Harder choice or no difference? The exact player is not the point, you can exchange it with any other set of players and ask the same question.</p>

<p>I thought he&rsquo;d be Celtics Ray Allen type who averaged 20/5/5, randomly scored 35 twice a month, and could play combo guard - a sporadically explosive scorer who would compete for a reserve All-Star spot most years Like a more PG version of Manu. And even that was more optimistic than the median prediction.</p>

<p>Predraft Steph was unproven as a floor general. He showed promise, increasing his assists taking over the PG role without a big increase in TOs, but it was only against Davison-level defenses. He didn&rsquo;t have a great first step, and didn&rsquo;t have the obvious athleticism or strength that most late-00s guys needed to finish effectively at the rim.</p>

      <label for="l8rftgy" class="commentText"><p>Just pulling shit out your ass and getting upvoted for it? <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2017/06/19/lavar-ball-lonzo-ball-nba-draft-lakers-celtics-stephen-curry-father" target="_blank">This is a very famous story.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2009, just days after my May 22 hiring as President of Basketball Operations for the Minnesota Timberwolves, the agent for Steph Curry told me that Steph’s father, Dell, did not want his son to be drafted by Minnesota—“No offense,” as I recall Jeff Austin, his agent saying to me at the Chicago draft combine.</p>

<p>Jeff Austin, who I&rsquo;d known casually, had represented Dell Curry when he was a player. He had been handed Steph due to his connection to Dell and told me this was a family request. “I really need your help on this,” Jeff said, explaining why there would be no visit and perhaps even hell-to-pay. (As it turned out, this was the only time when I was with the Wolves that I ever ran into this type of draft problem.)</p>

<p>The back-channel message would have weighed heavily in my decision-making process under any circumstances, but especially in Minnesota. Immediately after my hire, I was spending nearly every weekday morning in the team’s conference room, listening to team business partners and season-ticket holders lament over coffee and pastries. “You’ll never attract free agents here,” they said, practically in unison. “Players don’t want to play in cold-weather places.” Doomsday all around.</p>

      <label for="l8s1t5n" class="commentText"><p>Okay? Nobody’s arguing that not picking him was the <em>right</em> decision (obviously it wasn’t). But the claim above is “Dell Curry didn’t actually change anything by talking to Bickerstaff, he’s just trying to make himself look good.”</p>

<p>The point I shared shows Dell, Kahn, Steph’s agent, Bickerstaff, etc. were all on the same page about Steph not wanting to be in Minnesota. Steph’s camp clearly made a very concerted effort to scare the Wolves off of him before the draft, and they succeeded.</p>

He had a ton of question marks about his size, true position, and athleticism when he was drafted. The irony is he was a generation shooting prospect, probably the best ever even as a prospect, but shooting wasn’t as valued as it is today (partly due to Steph). </p>

      <label for="l8qkaro" class="commentText"><p>Obviously the rings would be nice, we wouldn&rsquo;t have had Klay, Durant wouldn&rsquo;t have come here.  I don&rsquo;t think Steph wins those rings here, The Wolves would have messed it up with his early ankle injuries.</p>
