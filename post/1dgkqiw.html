      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dgkqiw/dell_curry_on_the_wolves_drafting_steph_i_got_a/"><p>Dell Curry on the Wolves drafting Steph: “I got a call from Minnesota [Timberwolves] as well, asking about drafting [Steph], I told them, ‘Please don’t. Please don’t.’ It was [ex-Timberwolves assistant coach] J. B. Bickerstaff. They said, ‘OK, we won’t.’  “</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Golden State gladly was able to draft Steph at No. 7 overall, while the Knicks settled for Jordan Hill with the next pick &ndash; the two have had vastly different professional basketball careers.</p>

<p>Dell’s pleading, however, didn’t stop with the Knicks. He also requested something from the Minnesota Timberwolves, who had the No. 5 and No. 6 picks in 2009.</p>

<p>“I got a call from Minnesota [Timberwolves] as well, asking about drafting [Steph],” Dell added. “I told them, ‘Please don’t. Please don’t.’ It was [ex-Timberwolves assistant coach] J. B. Bickerstaff. They said, ‘OK, we won’t.’</p>

<p>“They didn’t. [They took] two back-to-back point guards.”</p>

<p>The last time any player was able to pull off not wanting to join a team after being drafted was Steve Francis in 1999, but it’s unlikely to happen again in the NBA with the current rules. </p>

<p>If the TWolves were willing to take Rubio (who wasn’t even guaranteed to come and in fact took 2 additional years), they definitely could have taken Steph if they were confident.  </p>

I guess between him and Chet is why Jabari was considered the top pick for a very long time until the very end when everyone figured out they were going with Paolo. </p>

      <label for="l8qo2yr" class="commentText"><p>Considering that most players are not a plus for the first few years of their NBA career, if at all, the will to re-sign is quite major. I would say the player&rsquo;s will to be there is quite important.</p>

<p>Think of LeBron James. He is the first example of success, yeah? Well, Cavs lost him before the time that everyone associates with his biggest successes really started. While in general no one would say they shouldn&rsquo;t have drafted LeBron, relatively, the benefit of drafting him was not quite the same as having him for the career.</p>

<p>You are allowed to draft a guy, but he is also more or less allowed to pull a Shaq or a T-Mac.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine you have a choice, you can have Shaq for his first 4 years, or Zo who likes the team and if all goes well may stay forever (hey, Zo, another example of a guy who left after just a few years! Do people even remember him in Charlotte colors?). Harder choice to make or not?</p>

      <label for="l8qjer9" class="commentText"><p>Wolves just weren’t that high on Steph. If Steph was considered the BPA at the time of their picks, they would have chosen him. He had a ton of question marks about his size, true position, and athleticism when he was drafted. The irony is he was a generation shooting prospect, probably the best ever even as a prospect, but shooting wasn’t as valued as it is today (partly due to Steph). </p>

      <label for="l8qm6y2" class="commentText"><p>I would say essentially nobody thought that in 2009. If you look at Steph’s rookie year, the volume difference among league leaders then to now is crazy. </p>

<p>If you thought the NBA would be where it if at today just 15 years later, then I guess you deserve all the praise in the world and deserve to work for any NBA franchise. </p>
