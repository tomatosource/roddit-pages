Please don’t.’ It was [ex-Timberwolves assistant coach] J. B. Bickerstaff. They said, ‘OK, we won’t.’  “</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Golden State gladly was able to draft Steph at No. 7 overall, while the Knicks settled for Jordan Hill with the next pick &ndash; the two have had vastly different professional basketball careers.</p>

<p>Dell’s pleading, however, didn’t stop with the Knicks. He also requested something from the Minnesota Timberwolves, who had the No. 5 and No. 6 picks in 2009.</p>

<p>“I got a call from Minnesota [Timberwolves] as well, asking about drafting [Steph],” Dell added. “I told them, ‘Please don’t. Please don’t.’ It was [ex-Timberwolves assistant coach] J. B. Bickerstaff. They said, ‘OK, we won’t.’</p>

<p>“They didn’t. [They took] two back-to-back point guards.”</p>

<p>The last time any player was able to pull off not wanting to join a team after being drafted was Steve Francis in 1999, but it’s unlikely to happen again in the NBA with the current rules. </p>

<p>If the TWolves were willing to take Rubio (who wasn’t even guaranteed to come and in fact took 2 additional years), they definitely could have taken Steph if they were confident.  </p>

<p>Think of LeBron James. He is the first example of success in NBA, yeah? Well, Cavs lost him before the time that everyone associates with his biggest successes really started. While in general no one would say they shouldn&rsquo;t have drafted LeBron, relatively, the benefit of drafting him was not quite the same as having him for the career.</p>

<p>You are allowed to draft a guy, but he is also more or less allowed to pull a Shaq or a T-Mac.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine you have a choice, you can have Shaq for his first 4 years, or Zo who likes the team and if all goes well may stay forever (hey, Zo, another example of a guy who left after just a few years! Do people even remember him in Charlotte colors?). Harder choice to make or not?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I understand what you are saying and I’m not disagreeing with your point, but as I mentioned above, the NBA has changed rules over these last 20 years to try and help teams with this process. </p>

<p>The RFA process is huge because it allows a team to essentially have 8 or 9 years of control for their drafted player. I agree they they can still leave or demand a trade at the end of this (as you mentioned LeBron or even AD recently), but 8-9 years is quite a long time. </p>

<p>Even if a player does not want to re-sign, due to the RFA process, they can essentially match any contract. Yes, the player could take the QO and leave early, but they would be leaving a huge contract and guarantees on the table (which often is a max for a star level player).</p>

<p>This is why although people sometimes speculate so and so will take the QO (Zion Williamson), they end up still taking the max. </p>

<p>There are still other issues to worry about like a disgruntled player like AD but usually they will still be there for the first 8-9 years before acting up. </p>

<p>It used to not be this way though. Back in the early 90s, the Warriors drafted Chris Webber number 1 and his contract had an opt out clause after year 1. He said he would use it, so the Warriors had no choice but to trade him to get something back. The NBA has gone a long way to prevent these things from happening. </p>

      <label for="l8qtahk" class="commentText"><p>Surely the restricted contract means a lot. But definitely it means something.</p>

<p>In reality, players are just asking for trades now. For example Porzingis. And, well - just as teams can draft anyone, they can also keep any player and are not forced to honor trade demands. And yet, they often do it, which sometimes has massive consequences to teams.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say hypothetically, you somehow know the future and you can choose LeBron who doesn&rsquo;t wanna be there, or Wade who wants to be there. Harder choice or no difference? The exact player is not the point, you can exchange it with any other set of players and ask the same question.</p>

      <label for="l8qjer9" class="commentText"><p>Wolves just weren’t that high on Steph. If Steph was considered the BPA at the time of their picks, they would have chosen him. He had a ton of question marks about his size, true position, and athleticism when he was drafted. The irony is he was a generation shooting prospect, probably the best ever even as a prospect, but shooting wasn’t as valued as it is today (partly due to Steph). </p>

<p>If you thought the NBA would be where it if at today just 15 years later, then I guess you deserve all the praise in the world and deserve to work for any NBA franchise. </p>

Then they take fucking Flynn, and we had another FRP and used it on a 3rd PG (Ty Lawson), who was traded immediately.</p>

<p>David fucking Kahn. What a shit stain of a GM. This is just another reason why Glen Taylor needs to go!!</p>
