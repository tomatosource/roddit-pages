<p>At some point you have to acknowledge that while it&rsquo;s super clever and all to point out that Pistons still wouldn&rsquo;t have win a championship with 22 wins vs 14, there is also definitely a line in how much failure you&rsquo;re willing to argue is meaningless before you have to concede that some amount is unacceptable. 22 wins would have been acceptable for this team, 14 was historically awful and therefor unacceptable; therefore, there&rsquo;s a meaningful difference</p>

Just as the difference between 0 and 8 is much more than the difference between 14 and 22, so too is the difference between 52 and 60. 14 and 22 is both just such a massive leap from being an actual contender that I’d rather see more backups get minutes than win a few more low importance games</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re about to tell me that you think 22 wins is meaningfully different than 14 but you simultaneously don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s MUCH different and the entirety of your point is contained within your own definition of what you meant by much then I really don&rsquo;t care what you have to say.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re responding to an exchange between me and somebody else about equating 22 wins with 14 when the former is a typical yearly finish and the latter is a literal historical record. If you&rsquo;re not actively trolling I have no clue why you thought parsing out your own personal unpacking of this exchange was something anyone was looking for</p>

<p>Monty played Killian Hayes over Jaden Ivey and the FO had to intervene into forcing him to start Jaden and give him more minutes. Monty has a weird habit of playing 10-11 man rotation and don&rsquo;t stagger minutes between Cade and Jaden to maximize their skillset. Their starters were usually up 5-10 points and the all bench unit comes in then proceed to give up the advantage from +5 to +10 to -10 to -15. The team never recovered after it.</p>

<p>The roster is bad, no doubt which is why Weaver is gone. However, the coaching is also bad which is why Monty is gone. That&rsquo;s why Langdon is hired to run the team and he&rsquo;ll get his chance to hire a coach who can develop young players and understands modern NBA offense.</p>

<p>Fucking LOL, there’s no way you think this is true?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Pistons net rating WITH CADE ON THE FLOOR: -9.4</p></li>

<li><p>Starting Lineup Net Rating (Cade, Ivey, Ausar, Stew, Duren): -7.7</p></li>

<p>You’re blaming this all on rotations? That’s the biggest fucking cope I’ve ever heard. They had, by far, the worst roster in the NBA. Don’t blame it all on Monty</p>

<p>I did not put 100% blame on Monty. I explained in my original post that it&rsquo;s on Weaver and Monty. Yes, while Monty got a raw deal with the roster construction but he also did a terrible job of not maximizing the roster. He played a non-NBA player, Kllian Hayes, heavy minutes because he didn&rsquo;t care about coaching.</p>

      <label for="l9c2e6e" class="commentText"><p>Box scores and stats lack context when it comes to individual players, but they are factual numbers that prove that the starters were not getting leads. If they were regularly getting leads and losing them due to bench lineups, Cade and other starters would show HUGE on/off numbers (like Jokic has with the Nuggets’ atrocious bench in recent years).</p>

<p>But Cade’s on/off was +4.4 with a net rating of -9.4, meaning whether he or starters or bench units were playing, they weren’t even CLOSE to playing teams evenly let alone winning. You’re a homer and you’ll see what you want to see, but you were just straight up wrong about starters “getting leads”, they weren’t.</p>

<p>Hey guy it sounds like this might be your first time hearing about stats but citing the on/off numbers isn&rsquo;t actually a counterargument to the extremely common fan observation that starters would often go up 5-10 points before being subbed out for all bench units that would obliterate all momentum</p>

<p>You can be up early and still have a negative on/off at the end of the game, especially when you have a terrible game manager who routinely torpedoes all momentum as your coach</p>

<p>It shows that they were routinely losing badly, no matter who or what rotation was in the game. Keep coping though, surely you’ll be so much better this season with a new coach LOL.</p>

<p>Sorry if you weren&rsquo;t referring to on/off NetRtg then what point do you even think you&rsquo;re making here? Just that Cade had a worse NetRtg when playing with non-starters than he did with starters? That&rsquo;s how you think you&rsquo;ve refuted the extremely common observation that Monty spent all season tanking early leads by subbing in all-bench units and riding them until the lead had dissipated?</p>

<p>Point is, no rotation could’ve saved your dogshit roster.</p>

      <label for="l9b70ol" class="commentText"><p>As a Pistons fan for over two decades, I can say with complete confidence Monty Williams was the worst and most frustrating coach I’ve ever had the displeasure of watching. Here’s why:</p>

<p>Refused to stop playing Killian Hayes. Hayes was immediately out of the NBA after the front office was forced to release him because Monty refused to stop playing him.</p>

<p>Always insisted on hockey style line changes instead of staggering our two best players and ball handlers - Ivey and Cunningham.</p>

<p>Benched Ivey and refused to play him over Killian fucking Hayes, despite Ivey being arguably our best player the season before while Cunningham was hurt.</p>

<p>Never challenged anything, despite everyone in the building knowing he should challenge. Never called a timeout to stop a run or make an adjustment.</p>

<p>We watched two of our most promising young guys - Ausar Thompson and Jalen Duren regress over the course of the season. Ausar in particular was getting top 5 ROY of the buzz when the season began and after Monty destroyed his confidence he didn’t even make an all rookie team.</p>

<p>Somehow took over a team that didn’t have their best player and only star the year before (Cunningham) and had a worse record with an objectively better roster.</p>

<p>It genuinely felt like he was actively trying to sabotage the team and get himself fired.</p>

<p>As for Flip, he still helped the Pistons to something like 6(?) consecutive ECF appearances, even after Ben left. That is not easy. And like u/dontredditcareme said, it was just unfortunate timing that those ECF appearances happened to coincide with the rise of the Heat, LBJ and the Celtics super team.</p>

<p>I don’t recall Flip running Ben out of town, thought it was more of a FO thing but either way Ben’s career fell off a cliff after he left so that wasn’t really damaging at all.</p>

<p>Flip definitely played a part. Pistons ran into some good teams, but the Pistons were also a good team and that’s just what happens when you make it deep in the playoffs.</p>
