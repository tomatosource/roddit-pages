<p>So as glorious as it would be to watch him gun for a third scoring title and just break the MVP conversation wide open, I don’t think that’s happening now that he doesn’t need to just hard carry us every night.</p>

      <label for="lc580cx" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s also unlikely that after losing KCP the Nuggets will again be in contention for the top seed in the West, and that makes a difference to the MVP voters. If Jokic leads them to like 65 wins though, then his name will be right back in there, but I think they&rsquo;re probably more likely to be looking at closer to 50 wins. So much is riding on Murray staying healthy all year now.</p>

      <label for="lc58y1e" class="commentText"><p>Came here to say this&hellip; but just watch, for the 2nd year in a row the Nuggets lost a good, important player.</p>

<p>The Nuggets, while still really good, aren&rsquo;t as good as they used to be.</p>

<p>Joker is going to have to ball out and I fully expect him to be even better next season because the team will need that from him.  I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll win it all next year but I expect him to ball out trying to make that happen.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s in his prime, he&rsquo;s played for years, understands what teams try to do to him, how they try to defend him.</p>

<p>He has such a complete offensive game, he scores on all 3 levels, we all know he&rsquo;s the best passer in the game now.  He rarely forces things, he is able to hit tough shots though.</p>

<p>Sucks that voter fatigue happens and not just to Joker, to anyone.</p>

<p>MVP for next season should ONLY be about that season, but folks are idiots, they set narratives so early and then so many in the media pick up on it and copy cat it.</p>

<p>Look, Joker may not be the best next year, tis why they play the games.</p>

<p>SAG is GREAT, no doubt and he is more than capable of being the MVP.</p>

<p>I just want whoever deserves it to get it, regardless of who that is.</p>

      <label for="lc5jiu7" class="commentText"><p>A lot of the MVP award is perception, and Giannis has the unfortunate problem of being the only MVP candidate with a gaping hole in his offensive game, plus having been overtaken by Jokic and Embiid in the middle of his prime. Combine that with the general placement of him as a player being high, but not exceptionally high all-time, and it’s weird for a lot of people to justify a third MVP on a historical level. Then you’ve got the team around him being old and seen as “past their window”…</p>

<p>It’s just kind of unfortunate. He’s definitely good enough to win it, but a lot of narrative factors are working against him.</p>

      <label for="lc5j56t" class="commentText"><p>MVP is the best advanced stats award. Giannis&rsquo; advanced stats fell off from his 2020 season (bounced back in 2022 but Jokic had a historic campaign that year). Unfortunately, Jokic has better advanced stats than him in all the years. Even Embiid has better stats the past couple seasons and Shai had better advanced stats in 2024.</p>

<p>young team that got better, they&rsquo;ll be a bitch to play every night, will bring it every night, he puts up insane raw numbers and his advanced numbers are crazy too</p>

<p>Mavs just feel more built for the playoffs than RS, much like LeBron/Kyrie, they never won a crazy amount of games or anything together</p>

<p>Denver i don&rsquo;t think will win a crazy amount of games, probably 52ish win team</p>

<p>Embiid won&rsquo;t play as much</p>

<p>Tatum/ANT put up the raw numbers, but Shai&rsquo;s advanced kinda blows their numbers out the water, the dude is elite efficiency with an 8% turnover rate while having a 30% usage rate, that&rsquo;s insane</p>

Usually after trade deadlines, a lot of teams went on a crazy run because players who were traded tend to play better in a bit to &ldquo;prove&rdquo; why the team that traded him made a mistake. I highly doubt the Mavs will go on a 21-2 run. Expecting them to be a 50 - 53 win team again.</p>

      <label for="lc5btdp" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s because they literally have no bench now. When they won the title they had Murray, KCP, Brown, Braun and Jackson in the backcourt. Now it&rsquo;s just Murray and Braun, and Murray gets injured a lot. If he misses a month this year again like he did last year, Denver is gonna be in deep shit with whomever they have replacing him in the starting lineup, as they don&rsquo;t really even have any serviceable backup guards anymore.</p>

<p>Losing your 5th starter if you&rsquo;re a deep team isn&rsquo;t a huge deal. But losing him on an incredibly top-heavy team is a major loss.</p>

<p>Like maybe voter fatigue hits Jokic, so its between Embid and someone else.</p>

<p>But that someone else could very easily be Luka. Just cause a guy is 2nd in one year, doesnt mean that he is gonna win it the next year.</p>

<p>And this guys double now that Shai doesnt have the bennefit of leading the youngest team to the 1st seed ever.</p>

<p>We know hes got a great squad and now they got their hands on even more talent.</p>

<p>Really it might be tougher for him to win it next year unless the Thunder are just that dominant and his numbers look just as amazing as they did this year.</p>

<p>The controversy from that kinda got rid of his voter fatigue, but i wouldnt be shocked if it hit him hard for next season. Though you never know tbh.</p>

      <label for="lc4m3sj" class="commentText"><p>Rather than that i view it as how much of the teams success is really because of you.</p>

<p>Cause rn the Thunder is better than ever, so if they just have the same, if not worse record&hellip;well thats not really as impressive as it was last year.</p>

<p>Take the Sixers last season for example. That was a perfect MVP season for Embid, if he just didnt get injured.</p>

<p>Insane individual production, visible impact on winning, clearly making his team play better, lack of talent around him and genuen good record.</p>

<p>I think its harder to just distinguish yourself ona  more talented team, which makes it dificult to win these sorts of individual awards.</p>

It&rsquo;s highly unlikely the Nuggets will again be fighting for the top seed in the West. Add to that voter fatigue, and I just don&rsquo;t see Jokic winning it this year. Denver would have to blow everyone away for him to win it this year, IMO.</p>

      <label for="lc51jon" class="commentText"><p>I think Shai really will win this year. He’s got a very healthy shot diet and that Thunder squad will be contending for the 1 seed again.</p>

<p>I think there’s four guys with a legit shot: SGA as the slight favorite, Luka (contingent on the Mavs record, top-3 seed should do it imo), Ant (if the Wolves get the 1 seed, he has a chance if he pushes close to 30 a game), and Embiid (needs to play 65 games). I think Jokic could also still win one but Denver’s roster is getting more top heavy and you gotta wonder if voters will give him that 4th MVP even if he deserves it at this point. He needs a massive statistical season and a Denver 1 seed I think.</p>
