</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>In light of recent news, I was wondering to myself how much of an outlier Kawhi Leonard&rsquo;s health was in relation to his superstar peers. I grabbed some quick data and voila, here&rsquo;s 13 NBA superstars of the Lebron era and the trends for what percentage of regular season games they played in over time.</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/VzKxDOf" target="_blank">Behold!!</a></p>

<p>The above graph is the <strong>CUMULATIVE</strong> percentage of available games played by each player. I tried to color appropriately but distinctively.</p>

<p>Durability rankings of the guys I grabbed:</p>

<ol>
<li>Nikola Jokic (93.6%) - Of course, he&rsquo;s only 29 so he hasn&rsquo;t hit the old man injury phase yet</li>
<li>Russell Westbrook (90.9%) - Maybe the true iron man of the list; Missed 0 games for first 5 seasons</li>
<li>James Harden (89.6%) - Consistently durable, with slightly less miles on him due to early sixth man role</li>
<li>Giannis Antetokounmpo (89.5%) - Started strong with a healthy rookie contract and has been fairly average in health since then. Still relatively young for this list</li>
<li>Lebron James (88.3%) - Known early on for being an iron man, but slow decline has tracked the average slope of leaguewide health vs. age pretty dead on</li>
<li>Damian Lillard (87.1%) - Very healthy in his 20s; steeper decline than most in his 30s</li>
<li>Luka Doncic (84.2%) - <em>mildly,</em> repeat, <em>mildly</em> concerned that he couldn&rsquo;t rank higher at age 25</li>
<li>Chris Paul (83.4%) - memetically always injured in his prime; has generally kept the slope straighter than most in his 30s but it was a low baseline to maintain</li>
<li>Carmelo Anthony (82.6%) - I tried to avoid anyone who dropped off so much that he actually wasn&rsquo;t on a team for some of the eligible seasons, but he was important enough to include. Feel free to mentally bump him up a percent or two for pure health, but his late 20s were not kind to him either - he actually tracks Paul&rsquo;s graph closely</li>
<li>Dwyane Wade (80.6%) - by far the roughest early-career health of any superstar, even with Kawhi on this chart</li>
<li>Stephen Curry (79.9%) - this actually reaches the level of pretty big all-time what-if scenario; impressive 5-year run in his 20s to briefly break from last place to mid-pack, though</li>
<li>Kevin Durant (78.0%) - <em>catastrophic</em> 30s for someone looking to push his way into the all-time top 10 discussion</li>
<li>Kawhi Leonard (67.4%) - don&rsquo;t want to dunk on the guy but this is such a wild outlier; Kevin Durant (12) is closer to Lebron (5) than Kawhi.</li>
</ol>

<p>I wanted to do even more players but the graph was already cramped enough.</p>

      <label for="lovjs5a" class="commentText"><p>Tracking players health is a huge insight into how injuries affects their scoring, assist and over contribution on the court. Durability is indeed a key factor in a Superstar&rsquo;s career since it will influence not only their performance but also the team&rsquo;s success and dynamics. Great post on what you here.</p>

<p>Indeed Jokic is healthy and can see he might be still in the league for quite some time.</p>

      <label for="lovq80q" class="commentText"><p>Maybe people will quit saying Giannis is &ldquo;injury prone&rdquo; now.  I swear I&rsquo;ve had the same argument a billion times this off-season.  He missed the 2023 playoffs because he was undercut while grabbing a rebound.  A freak accident (no pun intended).  2024 was literally his first time really missing any amount of time due to a wear and tear injury.  Outside of that, he&rsquo;s been an iron man.  And yet people keep writing him off saying &ldquo;he won&rsquo;t be healthy for the playoffs&rdquo;.  Do people really expect KLove to run under him again this year like wtf I feel like I&rsquo;ve been taking crazy pills with how some people have been describing Giannis.</p>

<p>His injuries have had the worst possible timing so more people see it, but he&rsquo;s never been injury prone. Yet a big narrative this off-season is we can&rsquo;t count on healthy Giannis for the playoffs???</p>

<p>I’m sure teams are capturing this internally, I don’t think any of them is maintaining a league wide one though.</p>
