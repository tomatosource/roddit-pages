</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>This season the Boston Celtics had a 123.2 ORTG and the league average ORTG was 115.3. This gives them a relative offensive rating of +7.9, a mark that has only been reached by 3 other teams. Here is the full top 10:</p>

<ol>
<li>2004 Dallas Mavericks: +9.2</li>
<li>2005 Phoenix Suns: +8.4</li>
<li>2016 Golden State Warriors: +8.1</li>
<li><strong>2024 Boston Celtics: +7.9</strong></li>
<li>2002 Dallas Mavericks: +7.7</li>
<li>2010 Phoenix Suns: +7.7</li>
<li>1997 Chicago Bulls: +7.7</li>
<li>1998 Utah Jazz: +7.6</li>
<li>2007 Phoenix Suns: +7.5</li>
<li>1996 Chicago Bulls: +7.5</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/oZaU5ui" target="_blank">Source (Thinking Basketball historical stat board)</a></p>

<p>Stat board is missing the last two seasons, however in 2023 the Kings led the league with a +4.6 rORTG.</p>

<p>Another note, Steve Nash has a legitimate case as the offensive GOAT. He was on all of these Mavericks and Suns teams. Obviously the Mavs offenses were more on Dirk than him, but still, it&rsquo;s impressive.</p>

<p>Edit:  You&rsquo;re also the second best raw offense of all time, it&rsquo;s just that league average ORTG has ballooned these last two seasons. In 2022 it was 112.0, 2023 114.8 and now 115.3 (was higher before the officiating changes).</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s underrated offensively because people just scoff at the idea of someone with 0 rings being a GOAT-tier offensive player which he absolutely was at his peak as this shows</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s overrated defensively as the contradiction between him being arguably a top 5 offensive player and him not being close to overall GOAT level is because his defense was THAT bad</p>

<p>Like as good as you think Nash was offensively and as bad as you think he was defensively he somehow was even better and even worse than that respectively</p>

<p>If Steph Curry had Celtics IT&rsquo;s defense that&rsquo;s basically the level Nash was on both ends</p>

<p>Maybe kids today who didn&rsquo;t watch him think this, but nobody questioned it at the time.  That Suns offense was a revelation to fans, signaling what could be after the long defensive slugfest era of the previous decade.  And it was all Nash running the show.  You don&rsquo;t win back-to-back MVP&rsquo;s without some strong consensus about how talented you are.</p>

<p>Craziest thing about Nash is I don&rsquo;t know if the Suns even really used him to his full potential.  In today&rsquo;s game he&rsquo;d be averaging 30 points and taking 12 3&rsquo;s a game.</p>

      <label for="l9h23re" class="commentText"><p>I agree Nash is underrated on offense, but I think you may be overselling how bad his defense was. Most RAPM datasets grade him out as a slight negative, and for my money, he was a bad defender more because of physical limitations than effort/IQ. To some that may not make a difference, but to me it does.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s still a &lsquo;bad&rsquo; defender, but not a huge killer because he understood positioning quite well, to the point of leading the league in charges for a couple of years I believe. Similar to Curry in that regard. Plus, he looks worse because he had pretty much no one behind him to help out. Marion was probably the best defender who got minutes, but the Suns also had arguably the worst defender of all time in Amare.</p>

      <label for="l9gwsp9" class="commentText"><p>Every teams got its own style. The top 4 teams all played offense very different from each other and I think that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>

<p>The Mavs would play through Dirk and spead the floor with shooters to let him cook. The Suns were about 10 years early to the party in terms of their pace, spacing and PnR spam. The Warriors relentless motion combined with Curry&rsquo;s insane gravity made them pretty much impossible to guard. The Celtics probably had the best spacing of all time which allowed them to mismatch hunt and generate good shots on demand.</p>

      <label for="l9gz26o" class="commentText"><p>Having an ORTG 7.7 points better than league average when the league average is 104.5 (2002 Mavs) is much better than being 7.9 points better than average when the league average is 115.3 (2024 Celtics).</p>

<p>In a lower scoring environment, each marginal point is more valuable. A team that&rsquo;s +8 in a lower scoring environment should win more games than a team that&rsquo;s +8 in a higher scoring environment (all else equal).</p>

<p>The way to measure this is looking at the percentage better than average rather than the raw difference above average.</p>

<p>This is also why Basketball-Reference&rsquo;s TS+ is better than Thinking Basketball&rsquo;s rTS%.</p>

Offensive ratings have increased but 3pt attempts have stabilized over the last couple of years as well I believe, so it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see if ortg keeps trending up. If it doesn&rsquo;t and the 2024 Celtics are still 4th in rOrtg after a couple of years, I think it makes them look more impressive.</p>
