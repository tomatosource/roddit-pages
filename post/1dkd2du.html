      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dkd2du/the_2024_celtics_had_the_4th_best_offense_of_all/"><p>The 2024 Celtics had the 4th best offense of all time (relative to league average). Also, Steve Nash was on half of the top 10 offenses of all time.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>This season the Boston Celtics had a 123.2 ORTG and the league average ORTG was 115.3. This gives them a relative offensive rating of +7.9, a mark that has only been reached by 3 other teams. Here is the full top 10:</p>

<ol>
<li>2004 Dallas Mavericks: +9.2</li>
<li>2005 Phoenix Suns: +8.4</li>
<li>2016 Golden State Warriors: +8.1</li>
<li><strong>2024 Boston Celtics: +7.9</strong></li>
<li>2002 Dallas Mavericks: +7.7</li>
<li>2010 Phoenix Suns: +7.7</li>
<li>1997 Chicago Bulls: +7.7</li>
<li>1998 Utah Jazz: +7.6</li>
<li>2007 Phoenix Suns: +7.5</li>
<li>1996 Chicago Bulls: +7.5</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/oZaU5ui" target="_blank">Source (Thinking Basketball historical stat board)</a></p>

<p>Stat board is missing the last two seasons, however in 2023 the Kings led the league with a +4.6 rORTG.</p>

<p>Another note, Steve Nash has a legitimate case as the offensive GOAT. He was on all of these Mavericks and Suns teams. Obviously the Mavs offenses were more on Dirk than him, but still, it&rsquo;s impressive.</p>

<p>Edit:  You&rsquo;re also the second best raw offense of all time, it&rsquo;s just that league average ORTG has ballooned these last two seasons. In 2022 it was 112.0, 2023 114.8 and now 115.3 (was higher before the officiating changes).</p>

      <label for="l9imz60" class="commentText"><p>Does it net out the same though? If the league average rating in year 1 is 100 and a team is +5.0, that&rsquo;s 5% above league average. But if the league average in year 2 increases to 110 and a team is +5.0 that&rsquo;s only 4.5% better. So you could argue that team with a +4.8 in year 1 is better than a team with a +5.1 in year 2.</p>

In that series I was actually glad on those possessions were Brown or Tatum were trying to play 1 on 1 and attack a matchup because the Celtics are so much scarier when they are forcing the defense to react to some kind of action. Problem is Tatum and Brown are so damn good that even that small flaw isn&rsquo;t really something a coach can exploit. Only team in the east that may have had a chance to slow them down was the Magic just because they are so switchable, but we never got that series.</p>

      <label for="l9hdrzt" class="commentText"><p>The Pacers offense though keeps the ball moving sort of regardless, the Celtics will either just randomly or at the end of the shot clock go to the ISO Jays thing that indeed usually works but isn&rsquo;t ideal unless you are purposefully trying to wear down their best player who isn&rsquo;t good enough defensively (Luka and Hali being those sorts of players).</p>

<p>The big gap was C&rsquo;s have a much better defense, but those were close games even after Hali go injured.  Probably the closest series despite the sweep.  Magic are very switchable, but their offense would look really rough against the C&rsquo;s lol.  I very much think they should go for Klay.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s actually how we play offense. All year we forced mismatches with guard to forward screens and forced the defense to react. It&rsquo;s how we generated so many open 3&rsquo;s and why Tatum and Brown had their best playmaking seasons (even if raw assist numbers weren&rsquo;t up). When KP played we&rsquo;d run screens with him to get smalls on him and it led to the most efficient post player in the NBA on good volume. That free throw area jumper was automatic if he had a small on him, felt like a 70% shot or free throws.</p>

<p>We also posted Tatum and Brown a ton too. This led to us being the most efficient post up team in the league, while also being second in volume (8.1 per game just behind Denver at 8.5).</p>

<p>This is also why the offense could appear &ldquo;stagnant&rdquo; if we had an off night, it was more a feature and not a bug.</p>

<p>Nash just didn&rsquo;t have any instinct to be a star that, well, NBA stars tend to have. He wanted to be a traditional point guard who just directs the whole play. He found basketball more fun that way, more interesting, more statisfying. It probably wasn&rsquo;t the best for his team, but it was good enough, and it influenced basketball played in the NBA a lot.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s underrated offensively because people just scoff at the idea of someone with 0 rings being a GOAT-tier offensive player which he absolutely was at his peak as this shows</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s overrated defensively as the contradiction between him being arguably a top 5 offensive player and him not being close to overall GOAT level is because his defense was THAT bad</p>

<p>Like as good as you think Nash was offensively and as bad as you think he was defensively he somehow was even better and even worse than that respectively</p>

      <label for="l9h23re" class="commentText"><p>I agree Nash is underrated on offense, but I think you may be overselling how bad his defense was. Most RAPM datasets grade him out as a slight negative, and for my money, he was a bad defender more because of physical limitations than effort/IQ. To some that may not make a difference, but to me it does.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s still a &lsquo;bad&rsquo; defender, but not a huge killer because he understood positioning quite well, to the point of leading the league in charges for a couple of years I believe. Similar to Curry in that regard. Plus, he looks worse because he had pretty much no one behind him to help out. Marion was probably the best defender who got minutes, but the Suns also had arguably the worst defender of all time in Amare.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is the big thing to me. Nash and Amare, their two biggest stars, were <em>both</em> lousy defenders. My theory has always been that you can get away with one big star who only plays offense, but you can&rsquo;t win a title if both your #1 and #2 options are below average on the defensive end (this year was another good test with Kyrie and Luka).</p>

<p>Tony Parker was a crappy defender too, maybe even worse than Nash, but he had Duncan behind him who was elite, and Manu was pretty good too.</p>

<p>Or for another example, Steph wasn&rsquo;t a good defender (though he got a lot better in the late 10s), but Klay was. Ray Allen was a weak defender, but Pierce was good and Garnett was fantastic.</p>

      <label for="l9hg0bu" class="commentText"><p>I agree with your thesis, but Amare had the ability to morph into a pretty damn good defender for stretches.  I really do think he could have sustained it for a playoff run- he was pretty thin, but his athleticism let him cover an amazing amount of ground when the effort was there</p>

<p>Then came the knee injuries and yes the combo of him and Nash was continually exploited by quick guards like Tony Parker. Cannot have a turnstile at the point of attack and the back end</p>

<p>Maybe kids today who didn&rsquo;t watch him think this, but nobody questioned it at the time.  That Suns offense was a revelation to fans, signaling what could be after the long defensive slugfest era of the previous decade.  And it was all Nash running the show.  You don&rsquo;t win back-to-back MVP&rsquo;s without some strong consensus about how talented you are.</p>

<p>Craziest thing about Nash is I don&rsquo;t know if the Suns even really used him to his full potential.  In today&rsquo;s game he&rsquo;d be averaging 30 points and taking 12 3&rsquo;s a game.</p>

<p>The Mavs would play through Dirk and spead the floor with shooters to let him cook. The Suns were about 10 years early to the party in terms of their pace, spacing and PnR spam. The Warriors relentless motion combined with Curry&rsquo;s insane gravity made them pretty much impossible to guard. The Celtics probably had the best spacing of all time which allowed them to mismatch hunt and generate good shots on demand.</p>

<p>In a lower scoring environment, each marginal point is more valuable. A team that&rsquo;s +8 in a lower scoring environment should win more games than a team that&rsquo;s +8 in a higher scoring environment (all else equal).</p>

<p>The way to measure this is looking at the percentage better than average rather than the raw difference above average.</p>

Offensive ratings have increased but 3pt attempts have stabilized over the last couple of years as well I believe, so it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see if ortg keeps trending up. If it doesn&rsquo;t and the 2024 Celtics are still 4th in rOrtg after a couple of years, I think it makes them look more impressive.</p>

Reason that Steph and Harden will end as the top 2 3 point shooters all time being drafted both in the same year.</p>

<p>Except D&rsquo;Antoni was not on the Mavs teams, or the 2010 Suns. Nash has more top 10 all time offenses without D&rsquo;Antoni than with him.</p>

      <label for="l9ina11" class="commentText"><p>If you&rsquo;re trying to use ORTG to determine who had the best offense of all time relative to the league average at the time, it would make more sense to compare the percentage difference between the best team and the league average.</p>

<p>Boston&rsquo;s 123.2 ORTG was 6.9% better than the league average of 115.3. That&rsquo;s still impressive, but it puts them somewhere around 10th best all time instead of 4th best.</p>

<p>If he played now where offenses are more sophisticated and coaches generally understand it at a higher level he would be about a Jokic+ level player and respected accordingly.</p>

<p>The NBA draft is a fat fucking load of shit because it&rsquo;s a parade of black bodies but this is a league predicated on skill, provided of course you&rsquo;re randomly at least 6&rsquo;3&rdquo;</p>
