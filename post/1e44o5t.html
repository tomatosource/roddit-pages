      <label for="ldcfc4x" class="commentText"><p>I think that’s their gripe:</p>

<p>How long till an owner/GM/president of a team goes to their extension-elligible star and asks them to take less than their max because Brunson did the same?</p>

<p>If I’m a 2nd or 3rd tier star in the NBA whose thinks they’re a max player and is on a team that doesn’t want to pay the full max (I.E. Brandon Ingram, Jimmy Butler), I’m probably not happy to hear about the Brunson deal.</p>

<p>The 2nd apron is already complicating those negotiations, but this is seen as another case that can be used by management for leverage.</p>

      <label for="ldchk1w" class="commentText"><p>But it wasn&rsquo;t less than what&rsquo;s Brunson&rsquo;s eligible for, he just opted to sign a long term extension now instead of waiting a year. There&rsquo;s 0 paycut involved.</p>

<p>Edit: Why am I getting downvoted lol - <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GSUMlDEXgAEVHB7?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" target="_blank">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GSUMlDEXgAEVHB7?format=jpg&amp;name=medium</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s literally the 4 year max, he would have to wait a year to sign the contract he forgoed and anything could happen in a year, he didn&rsquo;t take a dollar less than he was eligible for.</p>

      <label for="ldciyci" class="commentText"><p>This is playing semantics, even if Brunson tore his ACL this season with all the Nova guys and Leon Rose there is zero chance they don&rsquo;t pay him. He&rsquo;s not a fringe starter who would be at risk of missing his payday. Isaiah thomas is a good six inches or so shorter than Brunson so that comparison is off before people decide to go there.</p>

<p>And if you are so sure that Leon will offer him a contract no matter what then it is smart for Brunson to take the current deal so that in 3 years he can get the 10 year mega max still with Leon and the Nova guys on the roster.</p>

      <label for="ldcr84i" class="commentText"><p>Look what he did was great for NY fans but this whole media narrative about it is getting way overblown, he&rsquo;s giving up <span class="math inline">\(36M over the next 3 years to avoid potentially \)</span>156.5M in downside if he gets a career ending injury.</p>

<p>Then he&rsquo;s eligible in 2027 to sign for the 10 year vet max where he&rsquo;d recoup the <span class="math inline">\(36M now that he's foregoing because if he signed the 5 year max next year he'd be missing out on \)</span>23M + <span class="math inline">\(19M = \)</span>42M across the <sup>2028</sup>&frasl;<sub>2029</sub> seasons because he wouldn&rsquo;t be eligible to sign the 10 year extension then and make additional money on those years already under contract, he&rsquo;d have to wait until 2029 assuming he has the player option or 2030 if he doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>So he&rsquo;s just giving up <span class="math inline">\(36M now but he's making it back later because of how these contracts work(You can argue if he got a player option for 2029-30 next year, he could have recouped something like \)</span>20M on that years contract then at that point it&rsquo;s costing him like <span class="math inline">\(17M, which is meaningless when he's going to make \)</span>480M over the next 9 years).</p>

<p>The only way what he did works against him is if he&rsquo;s 100% healthy next year but then gets a career ending injury in 26-<sup>27</sup>&frasl;<sub>27</sub>-28.</p>

<p>Tl;DR: Brunson&rsquo;s only giving up at most <span class="math inline">\(17M but protecting himself from the downside of being out of long term contract going into next year which would cost \)</span>100&rsquo;s of millions in the worst case scenario.</p>

      <label for="ldci3hm" class="commentText"><p>The players union angle always confused me. Who in the players union is really upset about this? The reality is that the way these contracts have been structured, a select few players make an insane amount of money and the remaining like 95% of the league is fighting for what&rsquo;s left. No one bats an eye when Brad Beal or Zach Lavine sign absolutely disgusting 200 million dollar contracts because there&rsquo;s no way to pay a player what they&rsquo;re actually worth.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we have guys like Caleb Martin, who yes fumbled the bag to some degree not taking the Miami deal, but now has to play for like 0$ and wait until next time in the hopes that someone has the space to sign him to a reasonable deal.</p>

      <label for="ldcputp" class="commentText"><p>How so? They are well above the salary cap and cannot sign a player for more than the amount Brunson gave up. I suppose they could trade all their picks and more players for an expensive player and then sign that player for more than Brunson gave up? But they already gave away all their picks for Bridges.</p>

<p>I would love to see an analysis that claims this signing costs the Knicks money.</p>

      <label for="ldcs2fl" class="commentText"><p>It was only 7 years ago that Isaiah Thomas told the Celtics to &ldquo;bring the Brinks truck out,&rdquo; fresh off a second team All-NBA nod and one year from free agency at age 27.  He subsequently got 2 one-year minimums in free agency, and has not had a full season contract since 2019, just some 10 day contracts and a couple of rest-of-season deals.</p>

<p>A contract&rsquo;s not real until it&rsquo;s signed.  Brunson could have bet on himself and gone to free agency next year and made more money, but he chose to take the maximum extension available and locked in the money.  That left some potential money on the table, but it also guaranteed an extra $130M compared to the worst case scenario.</p>

Had they not landed Mikal I don’t think he opts for less but he wants all his boys to stay together and get paid. I seen Mikal is also planning on taking less. The number one key to winning is sacrificing as a team wether it be shot attempts, minutes, role, or money you have to sacrifice a little or in JB case a lot to get the ultimate goal. That 100mil he leaving on table honestly would’ve prolly only been like 30mil after ny state taxes and federal taxes lol</p>

      <label for="ldch46g" class="commentText"><p>Who said it’s normal? It’s unselfish for sure but it’s understandable because of multiple unique circumstances that only apply to Brunson.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Taking a pay cut almost guarantees that the front office won’t have to trade one of Brunson’s close friends to duck the 2nd apron. If Brunson said no I’m not taking a pay cut then eventually players like Josh Hart or Donte would have had to have been salaried dumped or released just like the nuggets had to do with KCP. Obviously Brunson wouldn’t want that to happen.</p></li>

<li><p>His family is literally making the decisions. Rose is his godfather, Thibs knew him since a child and his father is on the staff. Brunson doesn’t have to question whether he can trust the front office as he can be safe knowing that they will do him right. There won’t be no “Daryl Morey is a liar.”</p></li>
</ol>

<p>When you combine the two it’s a simple pitch. “Hey Brunson take a pay cut now so that we can keep your friends on the roster for the next few seasons so you can all compete in New York for a championship and when the time comes we will be sure to pay you back. You can trust us because I’ve known you since you literally were born.”</p>

<p>Obviously Brunson is a NY legend for accepting this deal and deserves a statue. But it would be better for the media to focus on how NY being a family organization known to do right by their players allowed for this deal to happen instead of talking about random conspiracy theories on why Brunson took the contract.</p>

<p>Sure if we have a chance to flip Hart and Divincenzo for Giannis fine, but right now there are very few trades that we can make that are going to give us better value than Hart and Donte off the bench. We are basically locked into this team going forward.</p>

<p>And Brunson is our franchise player lol, you think the Bucks are trading Thanasis without consulting Giannis first?</p>

      <label for="ldcih29" class="commentText"><p>Those aren&rsquo;t legitimate counterpoints to the main argument which is that it&rsquo;s bad for the players (and great for owners) to create an environment where fans are putting pressure on players to take less because that&rsquo;s the environment necessary to compete.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a tricky situation because if too many people do this, the players union will be forced to negotiate for stronger veteran minimums which is going to create new problems.</p>

<p>Just saying &ldquo;hey its great for the knicks so its okay&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a counterargument. Why it&rsquo;s positive for <em>him</em> isn&rsquo;t an argument. Every team in the league could benefit from their highest paid player giving up a cut close to that percentage.</p>

      <label for="ldckihc" class="commentText"><p>Again he took the MAX that was available for him this offseason. He didn’t give up any money that was currently available. The players union can’t force him to wait a year to maybe get more money next season.</p>

<p>This isn’t replicable by other star players because Brunson was a unique situation as he was a 2nd round pick and a later bloomer so he can only extend off his current contract. Players like Tatum (or in your case Scottie) are already on max contracts so they can extend off that to get a max with little risk.</p>

<p>What if Brunson tears his Achilles next year? Was it a bad move then? Like I mentioned in 2021 Julius Randle coming off an All-NBA 2nd team season (like Brunson) took <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/2753711/2021/08/05/why-julius-randles-4-year-max-extension-sets-knicks-up-well-for-the-future/" target="_blank">the max extension</a> possible that season guaranteeing him a 100 million dollar contract. If he waited one more year he could have signed a 5 year 206 million dollar deal.</p>

<p>Luckily he did extend because he had a horrible year due to a poorly constructed roster and he would have been lucky to get half of his current extension.</p>

<p>You can’t get mad at players for turning down 100 million dollar contracts to risk losing everything where there are a ton of examples of players losing out on a ton of money either due to injuries or betting on themselves (Oladipo, IT, Noel, etc.)</p>

      <label for="ldckv3n" class="commentText"><p>This is one of the reasons LeBron, as the face of the league, took the max deal almost every year. It definitely never helped him from a roster building standpoint, but it sure helped every other player from a business standpoint. Once a lower benchmark from better players have been established, goodluck trying to negotiate a max.</p>

<p>Yeah nobody not actually in the players union considers that a con. Pretty sure plenty of members of the players union don’t either.</p>

      <label for="ldczdzz" class="commentText"><p>Caleb Martin got a deal maybe slightly lower than he would&rsquo;ve in the past, $40M with incentives included is a fair deal for him and is not far off what he would&rsquo;ve received a few years ago in relative terms at all. I do think it is players like him that will be hurt the most from the new CBA though.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s less the CBA, more the overall lack of cap space that&rsquo;s hurt guys like GTJ this offseason. DeMar waited out and made his money. Teams are still maxing out their cores.</p>

<p>Hard to see any cons, it&rsquo;s all wait and see at this point. Obviously, the Knicks are the big winners. Brunson having security and upping his $$$ is a big winner too. An even bigger winner down the line.</p>

Also us hiring his family to show he can trust us to take care of him in the long term is fine. As long as they&rsquo;re not circumventing the cap, anything is on the table. Lebron teams have done this, the Clippers did this, tons of teams have done this, we&rsquo;re just the 1st team to actually get a guy to trust us implicitly to take care of him lol.</p>
