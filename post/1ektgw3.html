</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>If you’re like me you can’t wait for Tuesday when we get some incredible single elimination Olympic basketball featuring some of the greatest players in the NBA &amp; world. The international game is so fun thanks to the lack of commercials and overall game flow and now things have gotten serious so we get the best of the best going at it. I wanted to make a preview for NBA fans to get excited for the games and give some insight on how things might play out. I also figured I’d take a shot at some predictions since everywhere else online seems to just be reporting the odds without much analysis.</p>

<p>I’ll be Ranking these games in order of excitement factor:</p>

<p><strong>1. France - Canada</strong></p>

<p>Why to be excited:</p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] The most hyped prospect since Lebron in Wembenyama gets his first ever playoff level game as an NBA pro and opportunity to perform as a team leader at a young age with real stakes. Can he live up to expectations?</li>
<li>[ ] Perennial MVP candidate SGA looks to get Canada their first ever Olympic basketball medal since the 1940s</li>
<li>[ ] These games are the first ones actually being played in Paris and the crowds have already been amazing, with Wemby vs SGA the atmosphere is going to be ELECTRIC</li>
</ul>

<p>Things To Lookout For:</p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] Will Frances coaching staff keep underutilizing Wembys iso and pick and roll game as a handler even against big men in Dwight Powell and Kelly Olynk who should have no shot at stopping him from getting to the rim at will?</li>
<li>[ ] Nic Batum, Frankie Smokes, and Bilal Coulibaly need to play lock down D on SGA, RJ Barrett Jamal Murray and Nembhard. If they do a half decent job funneling to their bigs, I could see Canada having trouble scoring as Wemby and Gobert are #1 and #2 in the tourney in blocks so far. BUT — If they play too much Fournier and Strazle and Albicy they’ll get picked apart by SGA in ISO so once again we’ll see how the French coaching responds</li>
<li>[ ] If France runs a Zone with Wemby or Gobert in the middle during any Powell / Khem Burch minutes that could swing the game depending on how Canadas perimeter shooting reacts</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Germany - Greece</strong></p>

<p>Why to be excited:</p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] This is our first time seeing Giannis in a big game in a few years and he’s been playing incredible averaging the most ppg so far of anyone in the tournament while trying to get the first medal of his career</li>
<li>[ ] Germany are the defending World Cup champions and have an elite team chemistry and Franz Wagner + Dennis Schroeder are absolutely on fire so far with Franz being 3rd in PPG so far with 17 and Dennis being 1st in assists with 9 per game</li>
</ul>

<p>What to watch for:</p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] Giannis should be able to outmuscle pretty much anyone on this German team, the likelihood of him and Orlando Magic big man Mo Wagner getting into a dust up as a result of this feels like it has to be -350. If Greece is even remotely good on their 3’s they should have a real shot to win this game.</li>
<li>[ ] Greece’s Nick Calathes is one of the best passers in the Olympics but can he generate enough offense to put pressure on the German perimeter?</li>
<li>[ ] Germany has been shooting well across their roster and has good pick and pop big men while Greece’s bigs outside of Giannis are pretty slow footed recovering on picks. Look for Germany to bomb a bunch of 3’s.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Serbia - Australia</strong></p>

<p>Why to be excited:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>[ ] Reigning MVP and one of the funnest players to watch Nikola Jokic seeks his first medal since 2016 when he won Silver against the reigning bronze medal team from the last Olympics in AUS</p></li>

<li><p>[ ] Josh Giddey is becoming a star in front of our eyes in this tourney, will we look back on this moment as a turning point for his career into an all star? Bulls fans keep a close eye on this game as Giddey will show a lot about himself in this do or die situation much like he had to for the Thunder last year in the playoffs. He is the motor of the Boomers as Patty Mills has become more of a secondary scorer due to age. Josh has been hitting pull up 3’s all tourney and will need to do it again to win this game.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What to watch for:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>[ ] Can Jock Landale be successful against Jokic? He’s had a great tournament and will be the primary matchup all game. Regardless look for him to score a lot on the other end too on the pick &amp; roll</p></li>

<li><p>[ ] If Dyson Daniels or Dante Exum hit their open shots Australia could absolutely pull off the upset. Especially if those guys can lock up Bogdan Bogdanovic and Micic which will be the key matchup of the day on the perimeter for Australia.</p></li>

<li><p>[ ] Aleksa Avramovic became famous for locking up SGA in the World Cup last year, if he can shut down the heart of AUS in either Patty Mills or Josh Giddey then this is going to be an easy game for Serbia</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. USA - Brazil</strong></p>

<p>Why to be excited:</p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] We get to watch LeBron, Steph, Ant, KD and everyone else play together, duh.</li>
<li>[ ] Single Elimination basketball plus the USA defensive rebounding weakness could make this game more dramatic than you think</li>
</ul>

<p>What to watch for:</p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] The odds say the USA will win this by 26.5 or more, id put a little action on that under as Brazil is a good 3 point shooting team who also have been very good on the offensive glass. If the USA is lazy early, this could cause major issues like it did in Brazil’s game against France that they almost won. I could see this game being close in the 4th if Bruno Caboclo and Bulls legend Cristiano Felicio get enough rebounds and Vitor Benite and Gui Santos hit their 3’s</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Predictions</strong></p>

<p>Prediction #1: at least one of these games is not going chalk and their will be an upset. Which leads me to my second prediction</p>

<p>Prediction #2: I think both Giannis and Wemby bring their teams to major upsets. France has a huge weakness against Canadas guards but if Canada doesn’t shoot super well from the outside, I could see France dominating with their big men and getting every available board and block which could skew the possession advantage towards france. Giannis has been unbelievable in this tournament and I don’t see anyone on Germany who has a chance against him. Off that star power plus him locking down the paint I have faith Giannis is going to want it more than anyone on the floor and shock the world.</p>

<p>Prediction #3 USA wins but it’s close going into the 4th quarter</p>

<p>Let me know what predictions you have below and who you’ve got in each game! Cant wait!</p>

      <label for="lgn3s40" class="commentText"><p>Exactly, the biggest problem the french team has is that they can&rsquo;t get their bigs into the game because the guards are too bad. SGA is going to force a lot turnovers just like Schröder did.</p>

      <label for="lgn720m" class="commentText"><p>I wouldn’t say far bigger.</p>

<p>Wemby and Gobert are several tiers above Dwight Powell, Kelly Olynyk, and Khem Birch.</p>

<p>SGA and the Canadian guards are several tiers above the French guards.</p>

<p>That’s largely a wash. Our defensive wings tip the balance in our favour.</p>

      <label for="lgnr8wf" class="commentText"><p>He also only highlighted how we&rsquo;ll struggle to defend their guards (which is definitely true, although we do have some strong defenders), but to me the far bigger issue is that our guard are far too weak at ball handling to stand a chance against Dort/SGA/NAW/Brooks. If I was Canada, I would play as much full court press as I can, we&rsquo;re gonna rack up the turnovers or only have limited time to set up our offense, which is already a huge problem for us to begin with.</p>

<p>The only guy I somewhat trust to bring the ball up under pressure is Strazel, but he&rsquo;s gonna be way undersized and will also struggle mightily on defense. To me that&rsquo;s the key to this game and why I believe we don&rsquo;t stand a single chance outside of a miracle (on top of Canada just being the far better team to begin with).</p>
