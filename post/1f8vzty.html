      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1f8vzty/derrick_rose_and_wes_unseld_are_the_only_mvp/"><p>Derrick Rose and Wes Unseld are the only MVP winners to make only one All-NBA team in their careers.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Unseld&rsquo;s career is interesting.</p>

<p>He was MVP, ROY, All-NBA 1st Team, and an All-Star in his 1968-69 rookie season, averaging 13.8 ppg and 18.2 rpg after pairing with Earl the Pearl Monroe (the previous year&rsquo;s ROY) and Gus Johnson (an All-Star) to help Baltimore improve by 21 wins over their previous season (from 36-46 to 57-25).</p>

<p>Then Unseld finished 8th in MVP voting in his second season, but wasn&rsquo;t named an All-Star or All-NBA, even though he had similar averages (16.2 ppg and 16.7 rpg) and his team had similar success (50-32).</p>

<p>Not making the All-NBA team in year two made sense - there were only two All-NBA teams back then, and he was edged out for the center spots by Willis Reed (that year&rsquo;s MVP) and a 22 year old Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. But not making the All-Star team is hard to make sense of.</p>

<p>He was an All-Star four more times in his career, and received MVP votes in three more seasons, but never made All-NBA again after year one.</p>

      <label for="llhcc68" class="commentText"><p>Another fun fact, for a long time MVP and All-NBA were voted on by different groups, the former the players and the latter the media, so you could get some interesting results.</p>

<p>Dave Cowens got 2nd Team the year he won MVP, Bill Russell got 2nd Team in a whopping <em>three</em> of the seasons he won MVP.</p>

<p>That rule only changed with the 80-81 season, where both since then are voted on solely by media.</p>

      <label for="llhdnnx" class="commentText"><p>Rose won the MVP because he was the best player on the One Seed in the Eastern Conference and sports writers were clutching their pearls after LeBron went on TV to announce his decision. Statistically, you could make the case Rose wasn’t even a top-five player in the league that year. One of the weakest MVPs.</p>

      <label for="llhsfge" class="commentText"><p>LeBron wasn&rsquo;t even the runner-up, and he himself said Rose should win MVP. I assume you didn&rsquo;t have the chance to watch that season, but just look up the injuries alone that team faced. Rose accomplised more with less.</p>
