      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1f8vzty/derrick_rose_and_wes_unseld_are_the_only_mvp/"><p>Derrick Rose and Wes Unseld are the only MVP winners to make only one All-NBA team in their careers.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Unseld&rsquo;s career is interesting.</p>

<p>He was MVP, ROY, All-NBA 1st Team, and an All-Star in his 1968-69 rookie season, averaging 13.8 ppg and 18.2 rpg after pairing with Earl the Pearl Monroe (the previous year&rsquo;s ROY) and Gus Johnson (an All-Star) to help Baltimore improve by 21 wins over their previous season (from 36-46 to 57-25).</p>

<p>Then Unseld finished 8th in MVP voting in his second season, but wasn&rsquo;t named an All-Star or All-NBA, even though he had similar averages (16.2 ppg and 16.7 rpg) and his team had similar success (50-32).</p>

<p>Not making the All-NBA team in year two made sense - there were only two All-NBA teams back then, and he was edged out for the center spots by Willis Reed (that year&rsquo;s MVP) and a 22 year old Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. But not making the All-Star team is hard to make sense of.</p>

<p>He was an All-Star four more times in his career, and received MVP votes in three more seasons, but never made All-NBA again after year one.</p>

      <label for="llhcc68" class="commentText"><p>Another fun fact, for a long time MVP and All-NBA were voted on by different groups, the former the players and the latter the media, so you could get some interesting results.</p>

<p>Dave Cowens got 2nd Team the year he won MVP, Bill Russell got 2nd Team in a whopping <em>three</em> of the seasons he won MVP.</p>

<p>That rule only changed with the 80-81 season, where both since then are voted on solely by media.</p>

      <label for="llhz26u" class="commentText"><p>To be fair to the media about the Russel voting, he won MVP the year Wilt averaged 50 points per game.  The players viewed Wilt as a stat padding douche and Russel as a winner, so they gave it to him.  It’s fucking crazy that a guy averaged 50 ppg and didn’t win league MVP</p>

      <label for="llhofym" class="commentText"><p>He probably will still make it anyway, but I feel like Rose could have really cemented his HOF case at the end of his career by either being a 6MOTY on a playoff team (Jordan Clarkson type) or a major contributing player on the championship team (Shaun Livingston type). An MVP, all star, and 6MOTY or champion, would be a great career arch given his injuries</p>

      <label for="llhzo0u" class="commentText"><p>It’s the sympathy hall of fame, so Rose will definitely make it.  However, there isn’t enough of a case in my opinion.  Like you said, he needed at least something in his career post injury.  He needed a 6 man or a deep playoff run where he was a key contributor.  He currently doesn’t really have anything post injury except a couple little runs where he looked kinda good like when he was on the Knicks.</p>

He&rsquo;s also extremely popular and managed to have a long career in spite of the injury. When he was a Knick, other players would come over before games like they were paying respects to the don. It probably won&rsquo;t be immediate, but as soon as there&rsquo;s a weak class they&rsquo;ll give it to him.</p>

Hah I would always get his card when I bought a deck.</p>

<p>Also I loved Unseld’s game so much. 6’7” center who owned the paint on both ends of the floor.</p>

He had 0.602 share compared to Reeds 0.266. I guess it&rsquo;s one of those things you can understand only if you lived at that time.</p>

Statistically, you could make the case Rose wasn’t even a top-five player in the league that year. One of the weakest MVPs.</p>

      <label for="lli66c1" class="commentText"><p>I think part of the issue for voters was that LeBron&rsquo;s individual stats dipped compared to the previous season, and that Miami&rsquo;s record was actually 3 wins worse than Cleveland&rsquo;s the previous year. It felt like LeBron had created a super team in Miami and done worse, both individually and collectively, than he had in Cleveland.</p>
