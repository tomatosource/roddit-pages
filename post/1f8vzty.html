      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1f8vzty/derrick_rose_and_wes_unseld_are_the_only_mvp/"><p>Derrick Rose and Wes Unseld are the only MVP winners to make only one All-NBA team in their careers.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Unseld&rsquo;s career is interesting.</p>

<p>He was MVP, ROY, All-NBA 1st Team, and an All-Star in his 1968-69 rookie season, averaging 13.8 ppg and 18.2 rpg after pairing with Earl the Pearl Monroe (the previous year&rsquo;s ROY) and Gus Johnson (an All-Star) to help Baltimore improve by 21 wins over their previous season (from 36-46 to 57-25).</p>

<p>Then Unseld finished 8th in MVP voting in his second season, but wasn&rsquo;t named an All-Star or All-NBA, even though he had similar averages (16.2 ppg and 16.7 rpg) and his team had similar success (50-32).</p>

<p>Not making the All-NBA team in year two made sense - there were only two All-NBA teams back then, and he was edged out for the center spots by Willis Reed (that year&rsquo;s MVP) and a 22 year old Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. But not making the All-Star team is hard to make sense of.</p>

<p>He was an All-Star four more times in his career, and received MVP votes in three more seasons, but never made All-NBA again after year one.</p>

      <label for="llhcc68" class="commentText"><p>Another fun fact, for a long time MVP and All-NBA were voted on by different groups, the former the players and the latter the media, so you could get some interesting results.</p>

<p>Dave Cowens got 2nd Team the year he won MVP, Bill Russell got 2nd Team in a whopping <em>three</em> of the seasons he won MVP.</p>

<p>That rule only changed with the 80-81 season, where both since then are voted on solely by media.</p>

      <label for="llhz26u" class="commentText"><p>To be fair to the media about the Russel voting, he won MVP the year Wilt averaged 50 points per game.  The players viewed Wilt as a stat padding douche and Russel as a winner, so they gave it to him.  It’s fucking crazy that a guy averaged 50 ppg and didn’t win league MVP</p>

      <label for="llid4f7" class="commentText"><p>When I see online basketball commentators talk about the 50 ppg season, they usually say &ldquo;he was a black hole of offense who limited his team.&rdquo; On one hand, I get it, the net rating isn&rsquo;t that good. On the other, the team&rsquo;s offensive rating and, more importantly, winning record improved considerably when he joined the Warriors. When he was scoring, they were winning.</p>

<p>I can grant that he probably was better as a passer who could score or as a defensive stalwart, but it seems like the output of scoring really did help his team. I mean, the year he averaged 50, they went to 7 games against the eventual champions, a 60 win Russell Celtics team.</p>

Also Bill Russels Celtics went to 7 many times. Yeah 1967 Wilt was better than any other year of Bill Russel. But that was 1 year.</p>

      <label for="lljkcbk" class="commentText"><p>Obviously stats don&rsquo;t tell the whole story, but when he joined the Warriors, they went from last in offensive rating to middle of the pack. Conversely, the defensive rating remained largely the same.</p>

<p>Part of the problem is that basketball discourse has come much further than where it was, and all we have is word of mouth, not too many recorded matches. I&rsquo;ve got no doubt that Wilt&rsquo;s defense was always a prominent and valuable aspect of his play, which I think helps counter those &ldquo;stat-padding&rdquo; allegations. That said, I&rsquo;m so curious about the offensive impact of his crazy iso-scoring and how it changed alongside his style of play. He went from averaging 50 to leading the league in assists as a center. That&rsquo;s insane.</p>

      <label for="lljoqg2" class="commentText"><p>Iso scoring floor raising a bad offense to good is a something has happened many times. But most of the players who won championships with a simply good playoff offense were also all time great defensive players  you could build a championship level playoff defense with (Hakeem, Duncan, KG, etc)
   But you need to have extra playmaking alongside that to be an actual championship level offensive n1. But there is a reason why Wilt didn&rsquo;t lead the league in assits till his curbing down his scoring.
Because Wilt has the biggest difference in shot selection  diet of any player of history. From 1962, the highest shot attempts to assist the ratio in NBA history. To being the top offensive players when he passed more.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;Yeah, but he average 50&quot;. Using boxscores ppg isn't how you actually figure out actual on court impact.
</code></pre>

<p>Once you adjust to pace( per 75 and +rts%), and his shot attempts to assist ratios. The &ldquo;best scoring season in NBA history&rdquo; narratives that people use to prop up that particular season. Still ranks as one of the best regular scorings season ever.  &ldquo;He went from scoring leader to assit leader.&rdquo; This implies an ability to use playmaking to help scoring and vise versa. But those versions of Wilt are completely different players. Like super Soldier AI to John Stockton.
Still a top 10 player ever. But counting stats are overstating his impact way more than his Bill Russel. Who for literally all but 1 year was a better player. Being the greatest defender in a defensive oriented era was much more impactful for his team championship odds than Wilts Scoring ever was.</p>

      <label for="llhofym" class="commentText"><p>He probably will still make it anyway, but I feel like Rose could have really cemented his HOF case at the end of his career by either being a 6MOTY on a playoff team (Jordan Clarkson type) or a major contributing player on the championship team (Shaun Livingston type). An MVP, all star, and 6MOTY or champion, would be a great career arch given his injuries</p>

      <label for="llhzo0u" class="commentText"><p>It’s the sympathy hall of fame, so Rose will definitely make it.  However, there isn’t enough of a case in my opinion.  Like you said, he needed at least something in his career post injury.  He needed a 6 man or a deep playoff run where he was a key contributor.  He currently doesn’t really have anything post injury except a couple little runs where he looked kinda good like when he was on the Knicks.</p>

I get that all previous MVPs have won it but this is a pretty unique case where there is minimal support around his case unlike Walton who was a legendary college player. To me, he shouldn&rsquo;t be HoF but at the same time the HoF is pretty damn lenient as far as HoFs go.</p>

Ignoring the college career, Bill Walton did have a higher peak winning the title, but he also had the 6th man of the year later in Boston.  Rose would have needed something like this.  A 6th man on a title team and he would make his case a lot stronger</p>

      <label for="llizjck" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, okay, I hadn&rsquo;t read that. It looks like it&rsquo;s a logistic regression using five predictor variables (height, championships, all star game selections, peak win shares, and total points scored, using mostly older data, and excluding players with fewer than 50 total win shares.</p>

<p>If it were me, I&rsquo;d include college championships and Olympic gold medals in the model, because they seem to matter to the HoF, but okay. The bigger problem is that this setup doesn&rsquo;t allow for changing parameters over time, which might be an issue. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p>My hunch is that the model is underrating the HoF chances of  Holiday, and Brown at the moment, but such is life.</p>

On the HoF&rsquo;s website &ldquo;about&rdquo; page, one can find the explanation, &ldquo;We honor individuals from all backgrounds - men, women, both professional and amateur, and those who have contributed to the game domestically and internationally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I think neglecting variables capturing non-NBA achievements is a possible deficiency in the model.</p>

      <label for="lljogc0" class="commentText"><p>College championships are hard to incorporate especially in the age of one-and-done. I honestly can&rsquo;t think of a player who has college as a differentiating factor at this point. Since this is forward looking, I totally understand not including them.</p>

<p>Same with Olympic golds. Outside of international ones, they&rsquo;re typically not moving the needle.</p>

<p>One thing you should think about when adding variables is whether they add any real weight to a HoF candidacy rather than just being a description of a career. There are definitely seemingly reasonable parameters that could be added that probably aren&rsquo;t as valuable as you might think (i.e. most MVPs are already shoe-ins with just Walton and Rose as exceptions). I don&rsquo;t think the accuracy of the calculator would be improved by what you&rsquo;re describing. <em>Maybe</em> all-NBAs could matter but as a obfuscated binary classifier the calculator is pretty good for the most part.</p>

<p>The case against Rose making it would be that he had 3-4 very good years, but post-injury he bounced between replacement-level play and solid bench play for the rest of his career. He never achieved major team success at the college or NBA level, and he wasn&rsquo;t part of an Olympic team. So you&rsquo;re putting him in the Hall almost entirely because of his one MVP award alone; this is pretty unprecedented, either way.</p>

He&rsquo;s also extremely popular and managed to have a long career in spite of the injury. When he was a Knick, other players would come over before games like they were paying respects to the don. It probably won&rsquo;t be immediate, but as soon as there&rsquo;s a weak class they&rsquo;ll give it to him.</p>

      <label for="lli66c1" class="commentText"><p>I think part of the issue for voters was that LeBron&rsquo;s individual stats dipped compared to the previous season, and that Miami&rsquo;s record was actually 3 wins worse than Cleveland&rsquo;s the previous year. It felt like LeBron had created a super team in Miami and done worse, both individually and collectively, than he had in Cleveland.</p>

<p>But not making the All-Star team is hard to make sense of.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only 12 players per conference in the all-star game in 1970 and only 2 centers made it per conference. Kareem and Willis were both in the Eastern Conference (as was Baltimore). Elvin Hayes (then a center) and Bob Rule (in for Nate Thurmond, who was injured) were the West&rsquo;s centers.</p>

<p>Wes probably would have been an injury replacement in the West for Nate Thurmond in all likelihood.</p>
