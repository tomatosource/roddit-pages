      <p>Man hasn’t had a single bad performance in the finals</p>

<p>2017: 35/8/5 on 69.8 TS%</p>

<p>2018: 29/11/8 on 65.0</p>

<p>2019: Injured obviously but still managed to score 11 points in the 12 minutes he played</p>

<p>I say top ~7 ish. I don’t think you can find many guys with this level of production/efficiency consistently in the finals.</p>

<p>It is not just winning one for Dallas. Just look at how people has almost already forgot Giannis has won with the Bucks 3 years ago.</p>

That whole series with Wade and Lebron mocking Dirk being sick, being arrogant like they already won the chip, Lebron playing hot potato with the basketball in the 4th quarters.

<p>Still KG and Allen were traded for a LOT of assists, they were not banana boating together in Cancun two weeks prior to free agency.</p>

<p>Then to be fair Allen the two yeaers before being traded wasn&rsquo;t an All NBA and had just 2 selection as All NBA in his career before that. Garnett was just 3rd team All NBA the year prior and no selection the year before. Both were 31. Pierce himself wasn&rsquo;t even an All-Star in 2007&hellip; so what are we talking about here?</p>

<p>Wade and Bron were both on All NBA first, top five in MVP voting, the two years prior. Bosh was a perennial All-Star too.</p>

<p>Moreover the Celtics 3 were old, as said. The only time we saw 3 stars gathering in a team, all in their prime was when the Heat did it. Then the Warriors with KD also did, but it was 1 piece addition too, not two.</p>

<p>But again, Irving was young and entered in his prime in 2015, even considering Love was among the best bigs out there in Minnesota, still it is no match to pair the MVP with the 3rd most voted to be MVP, so basically 2 top 3 players, in their prime, as it was with Lebron and Wade.</p>

It’s the same reason Kobe’s first three rings don’t mean as much. He faced way less defensive attention than other superstars in his threepeat. </p>

<p>And that’s ignoring how the third option behind him was nuclear level threat the second he was open. </p>

<p>Okay, this isn’t true, I’m not sure your seeing other comments in this thread, but Durant actually was guarded by Lebron who was the Cavs best defender, and he actually shot more contested looks in both finals series than Steph, Steph was open more statistically.</p>

<p>Are you really comparing pippens role on offense to Kds on the warriors? Kd was legit their primary scoring option. Klay Steph draymond and Steve Kerr all said he was their best player.</p>

<p>The idea that kd was just getting open shots just isn’t true man, i rewatched the series and he was their best player. Cavs defended kd and Steph the same , they just hedged curry more on screens with draymond, kd ISOs more so it’s harder to double from the post.</p>

<p>Durant literlaly did what he was doing on the warriors on 2021 vs bucks, playing 1 on 4 with his teammates hurt. The idea that he was a 2nd option or priority on the warriors just isn’t true.</p>

<p>u/link_slater</p>

<p>Houston also prioritized  kd over Steph</p>

      <label for="lm6tcis" class="commentText"><p>I mean, Durant was the primary scoring option for the warriors. They embraced him as their first option. He averaged 35-9-5 on 70TS. He didn’t play a pippen, horry or whatever role. He actually played a similar role to MJ where they were feeding him the ball off screens, on downs, postups, and cuts.</p>

<p>Whenever warriors were In Trouble, needed a clutch basket, or wanted easy offense, they threw it to kd in the post. He was also defending 1-4 on defense and averging nearly 3 blocks a game.</p>

<p>He was not some pippen or kyrie….</p>

<p>Are you really saying all of this due a ty Lue quote where he also said they defended kd similarly?</p>

<p>I mean… I watched the finals multiple times, KD was not defended any different than Dirk, Lebron, Jokic, Giannis, etc in their finals series. He actually led the finals in contested shot attempts for both teams…..</p>

<p>Is it not just conceivable that kd averged 35 because he was the best scorer in the world at the time and a 5 time scoring champ?</p>

<p>Houston also prioritized kd over Steph, and kd was the best player in that series</p>

<p>The Venn Diagram of folks who will do this to KD, but then scream foul if you bring up the myriad of times LeBron has benefitted from either forming a super team himself, playing in weird bubble circumstances, or benefitting from injuries to get to the Finals is almost a perfect circle.</p>

<p>KD’s rings count as much as 3 out of 4 of LeBron’s if we’re going there.</p>

<p>In single coverage. Curry, much like Lebron, create separation from their opponents by quickness or explosiveness to get their open shots. It’s an indicator a superstar has created their own shot.</p>

<p>KD saw role player attention in golden state because he was riding shotgun to the best off ball player in league history. He feasted like any other star player would (kawhi, PG, any other scoring wing).</p>

<p>No one has ever questioned KD’s ability to score in single coverage. Single coverage, by its own definition, isn’t defense breaking.</p>

<p>Durant never seeing a double team, aka receiving role player attention, is thanks to Curry blowing up defenses by him creating on and off ball.</p>

<p>Do you think KD just magically became a better player once he joined the warriors? Look at his OKC scoring rate and efficiency in the playoffs (identical to james harden) then look at him when he shared the court with curry.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Curry shooting open shots is because he is running all over the court making defenders run into each other to get open. Screening and using screens is his specialty.</p>

<p>KD of course can simply shoot over most defenders in single coverage. That’s KD’s speciality.</p>

<p>That’s actually practically the same as his warriors years. And way clear of any harden 3 year stretch</p>

<p>Doing this with almost no spacing too.</p>

<p>Kd also had his best postseason run of his career in the 2021 nets, he basically continued doing what he did on the warriors in 2021.</p>

<p>I’m sure curry was helping him “get open” 2,000 miles away right?</p>

<p>Right? Maybe we should take a look at curry’s numbers without draymond in the playoffs, 24ppg on 52TS….woah</p>

<p>Fact of the matter is—-curry is continually more open when taking his shots, even took more shots in a finals series than kd, but literally shoots worse from all over the floor. I kid you not Curry was guarded less than kd in those finals series, 90% of the time (I rewatched the series), curry is in the corner with jr smith guarding him and Durant is just scoring on the entire defense off a screen, cut, iso, post up.</p>

<p>Yes, kd can shoot over players at will all over the floor, that’s why he’s better than Steph and has been on those title teams, who knew that a player being able to create a 50% shot for himself at will from all over is extremely valuable, they embraced him as their best player because he was, no one in real life besides curry Stan’s but the gravity nonsense. Lebron kd curry all were defenses 1v1 in that series, no need to lie</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No Curry was winning another championship while KD could barely get out of the first round.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s why won before Curry was on the same team, then he beat Curry head to head, then Curry joined his team, and then proceeded to win again without Curry. Oh wait, nvm that was KD. Weird how KD is so much better than Curry yet Curry has done literally twice as much winning as KD. If KD doesn&rsquo;t join Curry, well, he never wins at all.</p>

<p>Of course the player we should be comparing KD to is actually James Harden. Their playoff stuff is nearly identical: one finals win without Curry. Really something.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>who knew that a player being able to create a 50% shot for himself at will from all over is extremely valuable</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is horrible half court offense and the fact that you admitted this is pretty embarrassing. But when your favorite player specializes in the least efficient shot in basketball, idk what else you want say.</p>

<p>Before you block me, it&rsquo;s threads like this where the tide is turning on KD. He&rsquo;s only slipping further outside of the top 15. Jokic and Giannis will pass him up and then he&rsquo;ll be in the &ldquo;really great but couldn&rsquo;t win shit without a 73 win team&rdquo;  category.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be a shoulder for you to cry on bro. It&rsquo;s gonna be ok</p>

<p>“Curry getting another championship” when talking about Curry and KD in 2021 is just precious</p>

<p>KD was the best player in the world at these playoffs. That was Giannis opinion btw, the only other one at that level, maybe</p>

<p>Curry didn’t make the playoffs that year. Was individually outplayed by Bron for the 20th time in a row or something. (KD arguably outplayed Bron for a few games in <sup>17</sup>&frasl;<sub>18</sub>)</p>

<p>You might say Curry has a better career. At GSW, however, KD being better was clear as day. KD had better numbers, easy FMVPs, you can watch the games right now and see for yourself. Without him, Kawhi outplayed Steph and took the ring</p>

<p>Your point is also offensive to the Cavs</p>

<p>They were getting torched by KD in the finals. And you think they deliberately tried to keep attention on Steph to get swept?</p>

<p>If they could stop KD somehow, they would. So they would at least have a chance of changing something</p>

<p>I have that performance as somewhere between the 4-7th best in the Finals since 2000. I think you can make the argument that it&rsquo;s behind 2016 LeBron, 2000 Shaq, 2003 Duncan, 2012 LeBron, 2023 Jokic, and 2001 Shaq.</p>

<p>So if that&rsquo;s his peak performance, and you consider the degree of difficulty was so low vs others, he&rsquo;s not 7th all-time as a finals performer.</p>

Too easy for him to score when the defense was worried about a guy with insane gravity. Lots of easy layups and dunks.</p>

<p>He factually did not get a lot of layups or dunks, he shot the most contested amount of shots In Both finals. Curry factually got more “layups and dunks”</p>

      <label for="lm77ga3" class="commentText"><p>Very interesting data, haven&rsquo;t seen this before and I lurk a lot on realGM. Tracking data of course is a bit wonky by nature but this speaks a pretty clear language. I&rsquo;m not going to go as far and say that the whole &ldquo;shut down Steph first&rdquo; game plan is false but it&rsquo;s definitely debunking some of the very common Internet opinions that KD was basically taking practice shots in those finals other than the last couple of minutes.</p>

<p>KD wasn&rsquo;t defended as hard as he would have been in OKC, and for a player like him it&rsquo;s enough to go scorching hot if he doesn&rsquo;t have to think about the barrage of traps, doubles and helpside rotations as much because he shares the floor with Steph and Klay. As always things aren&rsquo;t black and white and I appreciate you collecting and presenting the data pointing to both players having pulled a lot of the weight in those series.</p>

<p>KD had some of the best finals in league history in 2017 and 2018, and often people forget that it not only looked so easy because of the godlike roster, but that we were also witnessing peak KD here; it just happened to be during his stint on the warriors as well. I always thought that KD was otherworldly in the finals. He def wanted to make a point when it came to the LBJ rivalry imo.</p>

      <label for="lm81b5n" class="commentText"><p>I know you&rsquo;re not saying this, but just because Ty Lue said their gameplan was to stop steph, doesn&rsquo;t mean steph was the best player. It also doesn&rsquo;t mean it was the best plan.</p>

<p>Just guessing, but Lue probably did it to force the warriors to break out of their triangle offense and do ISOs with KD. I do know the result was a lot of ISOs with KD. No, these weren&rsquo;t easy layups and dunks. If they were, barnes and kuminga would&rsquo;ve dominated too. They only looked easy because it&rsquo;s kevin durant and, in his prime, there was literally nobody that could stop him 1on1. Not even lebron.</p>

<p>The “game plane was against curry”, doesn’t make too much sense to me in that aspect. How are you the game plan but open more, takes more open shots, and takes more shots in general?</p>

<p>The truth is the Cavs game planned for both players equally, kd was just better</p>

<p>“Similar to strategy against warriors stopping curry they targeted harden”</p>

<p>Is Durant discourse  on this sub so bad that after lying about curry getting targeted and making it seem like KD was just open all the time (curry got more open looks in the finals)….the narrative is that a 6th man was prioritized over the player who led them to the finals? What the fuck?</p>

<p>Battier, Lebron, Wade were guarding kd in a 2 man zone and filling the gaps, Westbrook was guarded heavily next, THEN harden off the bench.</p>

<p>The heat might’ve prioritized harden the same way, defenses guard a 2nd or third option, but the Heat defense FOCUSED on stopping Kd first and for most, he was by far their best player and just had a top 10 series ever vs the spurs.</p>

<p>Harden averaged 32 minites in the series, kd averged 43ppg. That’s like saying Boston in 2022 prioritized wiggins over Curry because of a udoka quote….</p>

      <label for="lm813qr" class="commentText"><p>30ppg on 55/39/88 splits. Considering how Miami was zoning him and guarding him with Wade/bron/battier…that’s pretty crazy scoring series. They lost marginally, every game was pretty close with suspect officiating.</p>

<p>When kd had the ball, the entire defense was focused on him, harden doesn’t have offball gravity, he famously does not shoot spot ups, and if a I remember correctly, harden did not even play in the 4th quarter of game 1, where kd scored 17 points in the 4th and won them the game.</p>

<p>Kd was the focus FAR more than a bench player…one of the crazier things I’ve heard on this sub</p>

You know what you couldn&rsquo;t do to prime KD? You could not stop him from scoring. So you&rsquo;re only chance of winning is to take away the rest of the team and hope he doesn&rsquo;t kill you. The Warriors lost in 16 against the Cavs. They only won in 15 because Bron had no one. They needed KD. I genuinely don&rsquo;t see how you could watch his finals performance and not think of anything other than dominant unless you are biased</p>

<p>He’s a top 5 finals performer ever, okc is actually more impressive statically,</p>

      <label for="lm5blnm" class="commentText"><p>Bro, rewatch the series, Steph is being face guarded by jr smith or shumpert.</p>

<p>They’re not really doubling him unless he’s targeting Kevin love.</p>

<p>Durant led the series in contested shots, he shot more contested looks than Steph in both series.  So he factually wasn’t open more. Kd was defended basically how the last 4 FMVPs were defended?</p>

<p>Also, in 2012 he literlaly broke the record for efficiency in a final series, vs the best defense in the league, was curry helping him 2,000 miles away?</p>

<p>You can’t extrapolate 1 or 2 instances of kd getting an open dunk off miss communication as if it were happening all series long.</p>

<p>Durant literally shot more contested looks than Steph .</p>

<p>Proof: 16-17 finals</p>

<p>open shots (4-6 feet) <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shots-closest-defender-10?CloseDefDistRange=4-6+Feet+-+Open&amp;Season=2016-17&amp;PORound=4" target="_blank">https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shots-closest-defender-10?CloseDefDistRange=4-6+Feet+-+Open&amp;Season=2016-17&amp;PORound=4</a></p>

<p>Steph - 4.6 fga</p>

<p>KD - 2 fga</p>

<p>wide open shots (6 + feet ) <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shots-closest-defender-10?CloseDefDistRange=6%2B+Feet+-+Wide+Open&amp;PORound=4&amp;Season=2016-17" target="_blank">https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shots-closest-defender-10?CloseDefDistRange=6%2B+Feet+-+Wide+Open&amp;PORound=4&amp;Season=2016-17</a></p>

<p>Steph - 4.4 fga</p>

<p>KD - 1.8 fga</p>

<p>17-18 finals</p>

<p>open shots (4-6 feet) <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shots-closest-defender-10?CloseDefDistRange=4-6+Feet+-+Open&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;PORound=4" target="_blank">https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shots-closest-defender-10?CloseDefDistRange=4-6+Feet+-+Open&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;PORound=4</a></p>

<p>Steph - 7.5 fga</p>

<p>KD -  4.8 fga</p>

<p>wide open shots (6 + feet) <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shots-closest-defender-10?CloseDefDistRange=4-6+Feet+-+Open&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;PORound=4" target="_blank">https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shots-closest-defender-10?CloseDefDistRange=4-6+Feet+-+Open&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;PORound=4</a></p>

<p>Steph - 4.8 fga</p>

<p>KD - 0.8 fga</p>

<p>but curry was double teamed every single possession!</p>

      <label for="lm87jov" class="commentText"><p>im not cherry picking he played next to someone who had more gravity than him. it helped make it easier for him. i posted multiple examples of people leaving him open because they were worried about curry. no one was leaving curry open because they were worried about durant. no one was face guarding and denying durant the ball the entire game.</p>

<p>He’s an all time great player. top 3 of his generation imo but finals wise i cant rank him like i can bron, dirk, kobe, tim, kawhi, jason kidd, giannis, or even jimmy butler. they had runs as the #1 option. i dont hold the 1 appearance with okc against him because he was still a pup going against a super team like i dont hold lebron’s 07 loss against him.</p>

<p>You keep talking about moments. Yes, there were a moment or two when curry helped kd score in transition, but that was not happening for the majority of the series. You can’t take select plays and claim they happened all the time.</p>

<p>The funny thing is, after kd got the open layup due to an mis communication, the very next play, curry got an open three because they loaded up on kd.</p>

<p>The VAST MAJORITY of Kds shots were contested in iso or off movement</p>

<p>you can find plenty of instances where KD is wide open with his arms up while steph is being double teamed. the gravity is different.</p>

<p>If you didn’t find the Warriors and Rockets going 7 games or the 2019 Finals interesting or competitive then I don’t know what to tell you. But keep crying about how Durant ruined everything.</p>

      <label for="lm562lb" class="commentText"><p>I wasn’t telling myself anything, I was telling you since you don’t seem to know that the Warriors didn’t easily beat everyone. I get it you were only watching Bulls games so you were checked out by the playoffs.</p>

<p>Another thing that may surprise you is that even if you say the Warriors ruined the league for three years, they didn’t even win in that third year. Imagine ruining a whole league and you didn’t even win the title.</p>

      <label for="lm4rdk5" class="commentText"><p>so kd had better numbers on more difficult shots? and curry had higher fga on open and wide open shots yet takes less shots?
curry averaged 21 fga per game in the 2018 finals btw. kd had 18.3, but curry takes less shots right? (kd shot 54.8% from the field, curry shot 44%)
in the 2017 finals kd had 20.6 fga per game on 58.3% from the field. curry had 17.8 on 44.9%</p>

<p>crazy how the guy with better shot selection shoots way worse than the guy with worse shot selection.</p>

<p>a common trait of r/nba users is they are to quick to generalize you so they can frame you as a hater or a stan. im not a curry hater or a kd fan! i just dont like people discrediting someone with a blatantly wrong narrative that keeps getting repeated and repeated instead of just saying &ldquo;im mad kd joined the warriors so i wont give him credit&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lm5heur" class="commentText"><p>Durant is a basketball genius and his talent is off the charts. That being said, because he never managed to build something himself, because he left that OKC team, then became a sorta elite journeyman, he&rsquo;s never going to live up to the real greats. He may even be better than them, but his move to GSW - which he couldn&rsquo;t really predict, or even care to an extent - killed it. His two FMVP&rsquo;s mean almost nothing to almost everyone. He tried to win before and after but couldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I respect his finals vs Heat more than anything else he did, and it&rsquo;s interesting, that THEY were the favorites in that series according to many.</p>

<p>Still love the guy, he just had bad luck with decisions. Which is a great s3gawy to WHY you need good people around you to make good decisions. But who cares durantula is fine, if he&rsquo;s biggest knock is not being in the same category as Levron, MJ, Hakeem, Kobe etc. Then it is still a pretty successful career</p>

      <label for="lm8ayh7" class="commentText"><p>Why is this same logic not applied to Lebron?</p>

<p>He left the team he was drafted to in order to form super team #1 Bron, prime wade, and an elite 3rd guy in Bosh not to mention a very stacked supporting cast of role players.</p>

<p>LeBron then leaves the heat squad which wasnt working anymore to go back to cleveland But he doesnt just go quietly oh no he will insist they get another star in kevin love trading the first overall pick. Than they load that team with shooters and role players.</p>

<p>KD joined a warriors team which lost to that Cavs team (on paper these teams should actually have been close. The Cavs without question have the better first/second option. Klay cant really create and overall Bron and Ky were putting up almost 30 pts per game each. Than figure in the 3rd wheel. Kevin Love, warriors 3rd option legit was Draymond.</p>

<p>When KD joins the warriors he is now making it so the teams first and second option are comparable. The 3rd option Klay to Love is much more reasonable. Draymond is a defensive dynamo as their 4th star, and I completely accept and agree that their supporting cast was stronger. But lets not act like LeBron didnt push for the best rosters around him at all times</p>

      <label for="lm6sopr" class="commentText"><p>The 7ft demi-god with unlimited range who can shoot over anyone should NEVER EVER have the luxury of getting wide open shots in the finals. He should never have the luxury of playing iso-ball 1v1 without the defense sending any help. The greatest scorers in the history of basketball are meant to be schemed against. Things are supposed to be difficult. If they avoid the challenge, they&rsquo;re not getting that respect. Sorry.</p>

<p>Still love KD as a person though.</p>

<p>Boston even played curry in a drop coverage in the 2022 finals sending no amount of help.</p>

<p>The suns played Giannis 1v1 on an island with ayton.</p>

<p>The warriors in ever finals just played Lebron 1v1 with no help.</p>

<p>Where he averaged 30 on 65 TS vs the best defense in the league.</p>

<p>Was curry helping him 2,000 miles away?</p>

<p>Did you also know that curry took more open shots than kd in the finals?</p>

<p>You can’t take one or two open dunks but ignore the many open threes curry got due to Kds gravity in the mid post as well.</p>

<p>He put up those numbers because he’s a top 3 scorer in the world</p>

      <label for="lm6d5np" class="commentText"><p>Top 15, arguably top 10. He plays basically the same as his regular season level, maybe a bit better overall, and that’s all you can ask for from arguably the greatest scorer ever. Even if we don’t look at the Warriors performances, where he was a machine, his Nets 2021 and Thunder days were all really impressive. Game 5 of Nets vs Bucks 2021 might be the best game he’s ever played with game 7 not far behind. Longevity also helps his case.</p>

<p>His playoff defensive numbers consistently took a step up as well iirc. He was a force defensively on the Warriors.</p>
