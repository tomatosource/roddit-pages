      <p>Man hasn‚Äôt had a single bad performance in the finals</p>

<p>2012: 31/6/2 on 65.0 TS% (at age 23!)</p>

<p>2017: 35/8/5 on 69.8 TS%</p>

<p>2018: 29/11/8 on 65.0</p>

<p>2019: Injured obviously but still managed to score 11 points in the 12 minutes he played</p>

<p>I say top ~7 ish. I don‚Äôt think you can find many guys with this level of production/efficiency consistently in the finals.</p>

It was the first time in my life I rooted for a team that was not mine.  That whole series with Wade and Lebron mocking Dirk being sick, being arrogant like they already won the chip, Lebron playing hot potato with the basketball in the 4th quarters.  My god I wish I could relive it for the first time again.</p>

<p>Still KG and Allen were traded for a LOT of assists, they were not banana boating together in Cancun two weeks prior to free agency.</p>

<p>Then to be fair Allen the two yeaers before being traded wasn&rsquo;t an All NBA and had just 2 selection as All NBA in his career before that. Garnett was just 3rd team All NBA the year prior and no selection the year before. Both were 31. Pierce himself wasn&rsquo;t even an All-Star in 2007&hellip; so what are we talking about here?</p>

<p>Wade and Bron were both on All NBA first, top five in MVP voting, the two years prior. Bosh was a perennial All-Star too.</p>

      <label for="lm4quzj" class="commentText"><p>Sure and even with that context it‚Äôs still a double standard.</p>

<p>The Venn Diagram of folks who will do this to KD, but then scream foul if you bring up the myriad of times LeBron has benefitted from either forming a super team himself, playing in weird bubble circumstances, or benefitting from injuries to get to the Finals is almost a perfect circle.</p>

<p>KD‚Äôs rings count as much as 3 out of 4 of LeBron‚Äôs if we‚Äôre going there.</p>

      <label for="lm4sya9" class="commentText"><p>You just don‚Äôt know how to marry stats with context. Steph took fewer shots because he was open less. Steph took more wide open shots because he is highly selective of his shots, like Lebron. 60% of game planning for Steph is off ball and closing off cutting lanes. It wouldn‚Äôt show up as shots.</p>

<p>A defensive strategy focusing on KD might send a few doubles and might also deny him access to the ball knowing he is tall and can shoot over him. Cavs stuck a good man on him that could largely keep up and contest, and live with what he gives them. Everything else was beating the shit out of Curry.</p>

<p>They tried to stop Steph and clearly failed given how many open looks he was able to get. The warriors system is designed around getting Steph open and that beat out the cavaliers plan of limiting his options.</p>

      <label for="lm49mzu" class="commentText"><p>I agree with this guy, though acknowledge Durant is such a legendary player. Personally, 2017 was his best performance for me, but it was done on one of the most loaded teams of alltime.</p>

<p>I have that performance as somewhere between the 4-7th best in the Finals since 2000. I think you can make the argument that it&rsquo;s behind 2016 LeBron, 2000 Shaq, 2003 Duncan, 2012 LeBron, 2023 Jokic, and 2001 Shaq.</p>

<p>So if that&rsquo;s his peak performance, and you consider the degree of difficulty was so low vs others, he&rsquo;s not 7th all-time as a finals performer.</p>

You know what you couldn&rsquo;t do to prime KD? You could not stop him from scoring. So you&rsquo;re only chance of winning is to take away the rest of the team and hope he doesn&rsquo;t kill you. The Warriors lost in 16 against the Cavs. They only won in 15 because Bron had no one. They needed KD. I genuinely don&rsquo;t see how you could watch his finals performance and not think of anything other than dominant unless you are biased</p>

      <label for="lm539zm" class="commentText"><p>yes but you have 3 more instances where kobe was the #1 option to go off of. &amp; it is steph. kobe would get double and triple teamed cus there was a point in time where there was no one else on his team besides lamar odom who‚Äôs offensive game wasnt that great.</p>

<p>you can find plenty of instances where KD is wide open with his arms up while steph is being double teamed. the gravity is different.</p>

      <label for="lm4rdk5" class="commentText"><p>so kd had better numbers on more difficult shots? and curry had higher fga on open and wide open shots yet takes less shots?
curry averaged 21 fga per game in the 2018 finals btw. kd had 18.3, but curry takes less shots right? (kd shot 54.8% from the field, curry shot 44%)
in the 2017 finals kd had 20.6 fga per game on 58.3% from the field. curry had 17.8 on 44.9%</p>

<p>crazy how the guy with better shot selection shoots way worse than the guy with worse shot selection.</p>

<p>a common trait of r/nba users is they are to quick to generalize you so they can frame you as a hater or a stan. im not a curry hater or a kd fan! i just dont like people discrediting someone with a blatantly wrong narrative that keeps getting repeated and repeated instead of just saying &ldquo;im mad kd joined the warriors so i wont give him credit&rdquo;</p>

In your death bed, surrounded by family you‚Äôll still be whining about Kevin Durant. Also the fact that you think that what you want should‚Äôve gone over what Durant wanted to do with his career is peak fan delusion.</p>

<p>If you didn‚Äôt find the Warriors and Rockets going 7 games or the 2019 Finals interesting or competitive then I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. But keep crying about how Durant ruined everything.</p>

<p>Another thing that may surprise you is that even if you say the Warriors ruined the league for three years, they didn‚Äôt even win in that third year. Imagine ruining a whole league and you didn‚Äôt even win the title.</p>

<p>What you are actually trying to convey is that he was the best player on a good team which is true of all superstars usually.</p>

      <label for="lm45kl1" class="commentText"><p>MVP is a media voted award. Fucking people like Malika from ESPN vote on it. It&rsquo;s a joke and only indication of who the media favors. KD benefited from being on one of the best defensive teams and being left open because Steph was the one being hunted by the defense. Different story, when he&rsquo;s treated like the actual 1st option by the opposition. No rings.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to simp so hard for your nba crush. It&rsquo;s not that deep.</p>

      <label for="lm46ahm" class="commentText"><p>Well again, he was the best player on the floor, stats don‚Äôt lie. He outperformed everyone in 2017 including LeBron. This is why he won MVP. The funny thing is before KD joined the narrative was that Steph choked in the finals. He hadn‚Äôt play like his normal standard even when they won in 2015. Then suddenly KD joins and he was ‚Äúthe best player‚Äù. See how narratives change?</p>

<p>Again, just same old rhetoric. No one played defense on KD? Like how dumbass a statement can you make lol</p>

<p>You just resort to insults and narratives. Just be honest for once and say you didn‚Äôt like him going there.</p>

Probably better luck trying to stop the short guy instead of the unguardable one that rises over defenses considering they both can torch you, but Steph is more volatile.</p>

No KD and they probably lose 2017 also. That Cavs team was locked in.
Lebron went super saiyan in 2018, he just couldn‚Äôt do it all with KD hitting dagger after dagger
‚Ä¶tbh Harden‚Äôs Rockets probably would have clipped the KD-less Warriors at least once</p>
