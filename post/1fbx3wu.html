<p>2019: Injured obviously but still managed to score 11 points in the 12 minutes he played</p>

<p>I say top ~7 ish. I don’t think you can find many guys with this level of production/efficiency consistently in the finals.</p>

Dirk beat the shit out of the reigning Champs Lakers in 2nd round, then vs the eventual WC champs the next year, and then vs the 1st ever superteam assembled through friendship and free agency, a team that of course won the next two years too.</p>

<p>It is not just winning one for Dallas. Just look at how people has almost already forgot Giannis has won with the Bucks 3 years ago.</p>

It was the first time in my life I rooted for a team that was not mine.  That whole series with Wade and Lebron mocking Dirk being sick, being arrogant like they already won the chip, Lebron playing hot potato with the basketball in the 4th quarters.  My god I wish I could relive it for the first time again.</p>

<p>Still KG and Allen were traded for a LOT of assists, they were not banana boating together in Cancun two weeks prior to free agency.</p>

<p>Then to be fair Allen the two yeaers before being traded wasn&rsquo;t an All NBA and had just 2 selection as All NBA in his career before that. Garnett was just 3rd team All NBA the year prior and no selection the year before. Both were 31. Pierce himself wasn&rsquo;t even an All-Star in 2007&hellip; so what are we talking about here?</p>

<p>Wade and Bron were both on All NBA first, top five in MVP voting, the two years prior. Bosh was a perennial All-Star too.</p>

      <label for="lm5fprc" class="commentText"><p>the Miami team was def more WTF but when the Celtics were assembled it was the first time in that era we saw anything like it. You can go find old shitty ESPN commercials where they jokingly ask to be called the big 3. It&rsquo;s not even like they were the first team with three good players though (spurs and suns both had 3 top players), but it was the first group of three undebatably elite players in that era.</p>

<p>Shortly after we saw the gasol/Bryant/Odom Lakers and Bron/Bosh/wade heat, plus a failed &ldquo;big 3s&rdquo; in the Lopez/dwill/Joe Johnson nets (and in the background we had the spurs big 3 + a transition into the kawhi Leonard teams, OKC big 3)</p>

<p>Eventually all the top contenders were viewed to require three star level players where the pinnacle was the warriors adding KD.</p>

<p>The salary cap rules today have pushed a return to Duo stars IMO. You still see teams with three but usually where the third guy is either on his first contract or not a true top ten player.</p>

<p>You even went out comparing Kobe/Gasol/Odom (or Bynum or Artest), the Nets &ldquo;big 3&rdquo;, or other examples to the Miami big 3s is just ludicrous.</p>

<p>Moreover the Celtics 3 were old, as said. The only time we saw 3 stars gathering in a team, all in their prime was when the Heat did it. Then the Warriors with KD also did, but it was 1 piece addition too, not two.</p>

Bosh is seriously the most overrated player maybe in NBA history.  He was the designated guy on a sorry team.  Somebody has to put up points and grab rebounds.  I&rsquo;d rather have had Horace Grant or Charles Oakley.  The Heat probably win an extra title with 1 of them instead.</p>

      <label for="lm4p9rl" class="commentText"><p>Because teams, especially the Cavs, played KD as a second option. It would be like comparing what Pippen did to Dirk or Lebron. It’s the same reason Kobe’s first three rings don’t mean as much. He faced way less defensive attention than other superstars in his threepeat. </p>

<p>And that’s ignoring how the third option behind him was nuclear level threat the second he was open. </p>

<p>The Venn Diagram of folks who will do this to KD, but then scream foul if you bring up the myriad of times LeBron has benefitted from either forming a super team himself, playing in weird bubble circumstances, or benefitting from injuries to get to the Finals is almost a perfect circle.</p>

<p>KD’s rings count as much as 3 out of 4 of LeBron’s if we’re going there.</p>

<p>In single coverage. Curry, much like Lebron, create separation from their opponents by quickness or explosiveness to get their open shots. It’s an indicator a superstar has created their own shot.</p>

<p>KD saw role player attention in golden state because he was riding shotgun to the best off ball player in league history. He feasted like any other star player would (kawhi, PG, any other scoring wing).</p>

<p>No one has ever questioned KD’s ability to score in single coverage. Single coverage, by its own definition, isn’t defense breaking.</p>

<p>Durant never seeing a double team, aka receiving role player attention, is thanks to Curry blowing up defenses by him creating on and off ball.</p>

<p>Do you think KD just magically became a better player once he joined the warriors? Look at his OKC scoring rate and efficiency in the playoffs (identical to james harden) then look at him when he shared the court with curry.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Curry shooting open shots is because he is running all over the court making defenders run into each other to get open. Screening and using screens is his specialty.</p>

<p>KD of course can simply shoot over most defenders in single coverage. That’s KD’s speciality.</p>

      <label for="lm6hw2r" class="commentText"><p>His scoring rate in okc has been measured.</p>

<p>30ppg on +8 rts in his consecutive 3 year peak from 2012-2014.  <a href="https://imgur.com/a/PPV1Tud" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/PPV1Tud</a></p>

<p>That’s actually practically the same as his warriors years. And way clear of any harden 3 year stretch</p>

<p>Doing this with almost no spacing too.</p>

<p>Kd also had his best postseason run of his career in the 2021 nets, he basically continued doing what he did on the warriors in 2021.</p>

<p>I’m sure curry was helping him “get open” 2,000 miles away right?</p>

<p>Right? Maybe we should take a look at curry’s numbers without draymond in the playoffs, 24ppg on 52TS….woah</p>

<p>Fact of the matter is—-curry is continually more open when taking his shots, even took more shots in a finals series than kd, but literally shoots worse from all over the floor. I kid you not Curry was guarded less than kd in those finals series, 90% of the time (I rewatched the series), curry is in the corner with jr smith guarding him and Durant is just scoring on the entire defense off a screen, cut, iso, post up.</p>

<p>I have that performance as somewhere between the 4-7th best in the Finals since 2000. I think you can make the argument that it&rsquo;s behind 2016 LeBron, 2000 Shaq, 2003 Duncan, 2012 LeBron, 2023 Jokic, and 2001 Shaq.</p>

<p>So if that&rsquo;s his peak performance, and you consider the degree of difficulty was so low vs others, he&rsquo;s not 7th all-time as a finals performer.</p>

      <label for="lm4oobv" class="commentText"><p>You’re out of your mind if you think looking at those performances objectively shows KD is top 10 performer. Objectively watching another player get doubled so you’re wide open doesn’t mean you are good. Calling the second option objectively top 10 is a wild claim</p>

      <label for="lm4zcjn" class="commentText"><p>You can’t really think that Kevin Durant was left wide open that much during those finals, you’re acting like it was every possession. Also he scored more points and took more shots than Curry in both their finals so calling him the second option is just clearly hating. The lengths y’all go to hate on this man.</p>

You know what you couldn&rsquo;t do to prime KD? You could not stop him from scoring. So you&rsquo;re only chance of winning is to take away the rest of the team and hope he doesn&rsquo;t kill you. The Warriors lost in 16 against the Cavs. They only won in 15 because Bron had no one. They needed KD. I genuinely don&rsquo;t see how you could watch his finals performance and not think of anything other than dominant unless you are biased</p>

      <label for="lm57s9h" class="commentText"><p>Do you consider the Raptors’ championship win over the Warriors to be of the same quality as LeBron’s victory against the Warriors? Or you rank the Raptors ring equally even tho Klay and KD were hurt?</p>

<p>You don’t factor in quality of the team and opponent when ranking performances?</p>

      <label for="lm5eztq" class="commentText"><p>I think the Raptors championship run was actually tougher. They had to face the Sixers, Bucks, and Warriors. The Cavs had a cakewalk in the East and then needed the NBA to suspend Draymond. So while beating the Warriors in 2016 is more impressive than beating the Warriors in 2019, it gets even out due to the road to getting them.</p>

<p>I think you are confusing how impressive the team run is with how impressive a player performs in that run.</p>

<p>They’re not really doubling him unless he’s targeting Kevin love.</p>

<p>Durant led the series in contested shots, he shot more contested looks than Steph in both series.  So he factually wasn’t open more. Kd was defended basically how the last 4 FMVPs were defended?</p>

<p>Also, in 2012 he literlaly broke the record for efficiency in a final series, vs the best defense in the league, was curry helping him 2,000 miles away?</p>

<p>You can’t extrapolate 1 or 2 instances of kd getting an open dunk off miss communication as if it were happening all series long.</p>

<p>Durant literally shot more contested looks than Steph .</p>

<p>Proof: 16-17 finals</p>

<p>open shots (4-6 feet) <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shots-closest-defender-10?CloseDefDistRange=4-6+Feet+-+Open&amp;Season=2016-17&amp;PORound=4" target="_blank">https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shots-closest-defender-10?CloseDefDistRange=4-6+Feet+-+Open&amp;Season=2016-17&amp;PORound=4</a></p>

<p>you can find plenty of instances where KD is wide open with his arms up while steph is being double teamed. the gravity is different.</p>

      <label for="lm5ro9g" class="commentText"><p>Which is stats basically with no context. For example: Might be registered as open shots for Curry? Run through traffic for half an hour with two people trailing and get an opening to shoot. Maybe registered as a close contest for KD: 1vs1 matchup in a favorable spot, where the cavs can&rsquo;t send doubles. Those are hypotethicals, but also shows that those stats cant be taken at face value. Most superstars would likely rather have a steady shot diet of the second hypothetical.</p>

      <label for="lm4rdk5" class="commentText"><p>so kd had better numbers on more difficult shots? and curry had higher fga on open and wide open shots yet takes less shots?
curry averaged 21 fga per game in the 2018 finals btw. kd had 18.3, but curry takes less shots right? (kd shot 54.8% from the field, curry shot 44%)
in the 2017 finals kd had 20.6 fga per game on 58.3% from the field. curry had 17.8 on 44.9%</p>

<p>crazy how the guy with better shot selection shoots way worse than the guy with worse shot selection.</p>

<p>a common trait of r/nba users is they are to quick to generalize you so they can frame you as a hater or a stan. im not a curry hater or a kd fan! i just dont like people discrediting someone with a blatantly wrong narrative that keeps getting repeated and repeated instead of just saying &ldquo;im mad kd joined the warriors so i wont give him credit&rdquo;</p>

He plays basically the same as his regular season level, maybe a bit better overall, and that’s all you can ask for from arguably the greatest scorer ever. Even if we don’t look at the Warriors performances, where he was a machine, his Nets 2021 and Thunder days were all really impressive. Game 5 of Nets vs Bucks 2021 might be the best game he’s ever played with game 7 not far behind. Longevity also helps his case.</p>

<p>His playoff defensive numbers consistently took a step up as well iirc. He was a force defensively on the Warriors.</p>

In your death bed, surrounded by family you’ll still be whining about Kevin Durant. Also the fact that you think that what you want should’ve gone over what Durant wanted to do with his career is peak fan delusion.</p>

<p>If you didn’t find the Warriors and Rockets going 7 games or the 2019 Finals interesting or competitive then I don’t know what to tell you. But keep crying about how Durant ruined everything.</p>

<p>Another thing that may surprise you is that even if you say the Warriors ruined the league for three years, they didn’t even win in that third year. Imagine ruining a whole league and you didn’t even win the title.</p>

      <label for="lm5heur" class="commentText"><p>Durant is a basketball genius and his talent is off the charts. That being said, because he never managed to build something himself, because he left that OKC team, then became a sorta elite journeyman, he&rsquo;s never going to live up to the real greats. He may even be better than them, but his move to GSW - which he couldn&rsquo;t really predict, or even care to an extent - killed it. His two FMVP&rsquo;s mean almost nothing to almost everyone. He tried to win before and after but couldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I respect his finals vs Heat more than anything else he did, and it&rsquo;s interesting, that THEY were the favorites in that series according to many.</p>

<p>Still love the guy, he just had bad luck with decisions. Which is a great s3gawy to WHY you need good people around you to make good decisions. But who cares durantula is fine, if he&rsquo;s biggest knock is not being in the same category as Levron, MJ, Hakeem, Kobe etc. Then it is still a pretty successful career</p>

      <label for="lm3wfe2" class="commentText"><p>He was 2 x Finals MVP and was statistically the best player on the floor in 2017 and 2nd to LeBron in 2018. Bro was doing the carrying. Did you forget the Warriors lost in 2016?</p>

      <label for="lm3wjbo" class="commentText"><p>He definitely benefitted from Curry’s spacing but I wouldn’t say he was carried. KD was clutch af during those two series and hit soul crushing daggers in back to back years.</p>
