</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I think it was Bob Myers or someone from ESPN who said that the NBA is the fastest league that can have a complete 180.</p>

<p>3 years ago - back in June 2021:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Suns made the NBA Finals and eventually became the runner up. Their future looked bright with possible several deep playoff runs with young guys like Booker Ayton and Bridges. Booker is the only one left.</p></li>

<li><p>The Atlanta Hawks made the East Finals. Back then, they were expected to have multiple playoff appearances but they just went to the lottery this year.</p></li>

<li><p>The Warriors looked lost. Missed playoffs for the 2nd straight year. Won the chip the very next year and now back to the lottery again.</p></li>

<li><p>Nets losing in the 2021 ECSF. They were primed to have a revenge season to win the chip in 2022, while expecting A FULL season of KD Kyrie and Harden. Kyrie went into a sabbatical, Harden left midseason and they were swept in 2022.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In 3 years, none of those superstars are there in Brooklyn. Nets are back in the lottery having a fire sale and tanking.</p>

<p>Damn.</p>

      <label for="lhp80b6" class="commentText"><p>Yup, the takeaway from this is that teams should seize each and every possible opportunity to feasibly win a championship. Stumbling around and hesitating to make (actual) win-now moves is very unwise. Denver is a prime example. Two years of contetion were wiped out with Jamal Murray having been injured. They won in 2023 but just over a year later they&rsquo;ve lost a key starter and there&rsquo;s no real way for them to plug that hole.</p>

      <label for="lhpa2mx" class="commentText"><p>Suns really fucked up imo they were a great team that just needed more time together. I think instead of going all out for Durant they should‚Äôve tried to trade Ayton/Cp3 and upgrade their roster. I only say cp3 cause he was getting old.</p>

<p>As for Hawks I‚Äôm not sure what happened, idk if Nate lost the locker room or what but they played amazing from the time he took over till they got eliminated in 2021 then it was downhill from there. Iirc they had the best record in the league from the time Nate took over till the end of the regular season.</p>

      <label for="lhp9o1d" class="commentText"><p>Overdue trades and small market constraints‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Atlanta gave up too early. No confidence in the core that ‚Äúoverachieved‚Äù. Hawks need to free Trae. I think he‚Äôs moved this year before deadline.</p>

<p>The Warriors and Steph are stubborn. They are gonna burn him out Kobe style on his last years. After the Olympics perhaps Steph has a paradigm shift and will bless a trade. This Warriors team is not going anywhere. Draymond needs to go too before he is exposed as over the hill.</p>

<p>Suns and Nets made a bet, ironically involving the same main piece in Durant. It‚Äôs asking too much to ask the older pieces in a big 3 to play all sides of the ball like madmen for 39 minutes for 106 games.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt fault these teams but Brooklyn did it right and cut bait. Phoenix needs to do as well. Even though their owner says 20 teams would trade rosters and picks in a second.. almost none would.</p>

All it takes is one injury to Tatum/Brown (which I hope never happens) and that changes things a bit. Guys could regress. Guys could demand a trade.  Off the court issues could take place.
