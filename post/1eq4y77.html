      <p>I think it was Bob Myers or someone from ESPN who said that the NBA is the fastest league that can have a complete 180.</p>

<p>3 years ago - back in June 2021:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Suns made the NBA Finals and eventually became the runner up. Their future looked bright with possible several deep playoff runs with young guys like Booker Ayton and Bridges. Booker is the only one left.</p></li>

<li><p>The Atlanta Hawks made the East Finals. Back then, they were expected to have multiple playoff appearances but they just went to the lottery this year.</p></li>

<li><p>The Warriors looked lost. Missed playoffs for the 2nd straight year. Won the chip the very next year and now back to the lottery again.</p></li>

<li><p>Nets losing in the 2021 ECSF. They were primed to have a revenge season to win the chip in 2022, while expecting A FULL season of KD Kyrie and Harden. Kyrie went into a sabbatical, Harden left midseason and they were swept in 2022.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In 3 years, none of those superstars are there in Brooklyn. Nets are back in the lottery having a fire sale and tanking.</p>

<p>Damn.</p>

      <label for="lhpv3j7" class="commentText"><p>I think people are still adapting to the way the league has changed since the end of the Warriors/Cavs era. It&rsquo;s not that we can&rsquo;t all see that there&rsquo;s greater parity in the league these days, but greatness in the NBA has long been measured by extended periods of dominance - and when we see a player or a team come along that seems truly special, it&rsquo;s hard not to believe they&rsquo;ll be able to do what the &ldquo;special&rdquo; NBA players and teams have always done.</p>

      <label for="lhpd7qr" class="commentText"><p>The thing about the NFL is that teams with good QBs tend to move Heaven and Earth to keep them, and those teams tend to have the best chances year-to-year. I think the AFC had a period where only the Patriots, Ravens, Steelers, and Peyton Manning had made the Super Bowl out of the conference for well over a decade. Mahomes, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow have a good chance at having a similar hold on the conference for the next 5-10 years.</p>

      <label for="lhpde19" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, the NBA is actually one of the slower leagues as far as change goes, imo.</p>

<p>Great teams tend to stay great for a while (Warriors Dynasty, LeBron’s Cavs teams, the Celtics have been perpetually in the hunt for the last half-decade, etc.) and awful teams take a long time to actually turn around (like, how long till Detroit goes deep in the playoffs?)</p>

<p>The NFL certainly has some mainstays (Chiefs, Eagles), but teams can legitimately go from deep playoff run to bottom 6 in a blink (and go back just as quickly).</p>

      <label for="lhpkvem" class="commentText"><p>I see what you&rsquo;re saying, and I agree. But I think what you both highlight is the impact of player movement. The post mentioned several teams who lost 1-2 players and now suddenly their championship window is closed.</p>

<p>In the NBA, if you have 2-3 players who are Top 5 at their position, you&rsquo;re going to be contenders every year until they leave. In the NFL that doesn&rsquo;t mean shit because there&rsquo;s 22 guys out there every down. So 1-2 players leaving doesn&rsquo;t dramatically affect your championship window.</p>

      <label for="lhpls1s" class="commentText"><p>True but Detroit managed 30 years without a playoff win in football which was much worse than their basketball streak.</p>

<p>New England’s run of 9 SBs and 6 SB wins spanned all of those NBA winners, and actually started with the Shaq Lakers and Duncan Spurs. Brady even got another in 21 after Giannis won his.</p>

<p>In the NFL consistency comes from having a top QB basically, as P Manning, Roethlisberger, Rodgers and Brees all led perpetual winners with no actual “Bad” seasons for 15 years each. Wilson had a 9 year run contending in Seattle during that stretch too. Mahomes has had 6 season so far.</p>

<p>So definitely pretty consistent winners at the top in the NFL for the last 2 decades and losers like Detroit can stay losers for a long ass time too.</p>

<p>But, on a team by team basis there is definitely faster turnaround in the NBA</p>

      <label for="lhqo2xk" class="commentText"><p>Recently it&rsquo;s been flipped. NBA has a different champion every year while Brady and Mahomes were just GOATs trading the titles back and forth. If anyone can shake Mahomes from that perch in a real way, I doubt it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s one game series so while the NFL looks more chaotic, over the last decade it&rsquo;s always the top two QBs. Eagles and Rams were the recent exceptions, definitely lucky and one of them played Brady (Burrow should be the #2 guy and he lost one of those). Just like  Kobe vs Duncan or Lebron vs Curry or Lebron vs Kawhi.</p>

<p>The QB rules have completely flipped the script here, along with Moreyball 3-AND-D NBA teams. And, arguably, the injuries. Kawhi, Embiid, KD, PG, CP3, AD. It&rsquo;s as unpredictable as football used to be.</p>

I get the Chiefs have been dominant but that’s nothing compared to the Heat Dynasty and Warriors Dynasty that have happened in that time since. If it was solely based off championships I’d say baseball has had the most parity in the last 10 years.</p>

In the last 10 years in the east the only nba finals team without multiple finals appearances is the Bucks, in the west the Warriors appeared in 6 finals. It’s crazy to say that the NBA has more parity than the NFL. In the Super Bowl both the Pats and Chiefs have appeared the most the last 10 years at 4 appearances each. Other than that no other team has appeared more than twice and none in consecutive years. It’s weird to try and even make the comparison</p>

      <label for="lhp80b6" class="commentText"><p>Yup, the takeaway from this is that teams should seize each and every possible opportunity to feasibly win a championship. Stumbling around and hesitating to make (actual) win-now moves is very unwise. Denver is a prime example. Two years of contention were wiped out with Jamal Murray having been injured. They won in 2023 but just over a year later they&rsquo;ve lost a key starter and there&rsquo;s no real way for them to plug that hole.</p>

<p>You definitely need luck to win a championship, Nuggets clicked at the right time. They were clearly better than the whole West, and only competition they had were Celtics who choked on the ECF. Highest the faced was a 4 seed.</p>

<p>When a team makes the finals, there&rsquo;s about six months where this sub thinks of that team as a finals team. And when a team makes the play-in, there&rsquo;s about six months where this sub thinks of that team as a play-in team. What gets lost sometimes in that is the idea that there actually isn&rsquo;t that much real estate between a play-in team vs a finals team. The difference is basically eight, ten games. That can easily be accounted for with trades, luck with injuries, player development, other teams players declining, etc.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is, if would not surprise me that much if Atlanta and Golden State both made the conference finals this year, nor would it shock me much if both teams were in the play-in. There&rsquo;s just not as big a difference between those types of teams as people seem to believe.</p>

<p>As for Hawks I’m not sure what happened, idk if Nate lost the locker room or what but they played amazing from the time he took over till they got eliminated in 2021 then it was downhill from there. Iirc they had the best record in the league from the time Nate took over till the end of the regular season.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s similar to Frank Vogel (although I think Vogel is a much better coach). It&rsquo;s not his fault the Lakers got rid of a bunch of 3&amp;D guys to get Russ, but once they did and the locker room was out, you gotta fire him!</p>

<p>At some point someone is going to have to say that Trae is not winning basketball.</p>

<p><sup>26</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> barely means anything with constant league TO record of 4.2, shooting abysmal 3pt at .33 on a high volume, and being useless on defense.</p>

<p>And Hakws dont wanna say it. ECF only managed to prolong the realization, even though it was a team effort, and they still seem reluctant to come to that realization / determination</p>

<p>And the worst part is that there is no solution for Trae, he either plays the way he does, or doesnt play.</p>

      <label for="lhqn7u4" class="commentText"><p>What confuses me about Trae and the Hawks is that it isn&rsquo;t a situation where you look at the roster and it&rsquo;s just abysmal outside of Trae. It&rsquo;s not like their roster is just devoid of talent:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Bogdan and Dejounte are good players.</p></li>

<li><p>Capela, DeAndre Hunter, and Jalen Johnson are great role players (Capela has fallen off a bit tho.)</p></li>

<li><p>Bey is a solid rotation guy (although last year he struggled shooting which hurts his on-court value a ton).</p></li>

<li><p>Okongwu is a great backup big (possibly even starter-quality.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, this isn&rsquo;t a championship roster. But you&rsquo;d think if Trae was as good as his stats seem to say he is, they&rsquo;d at least be a playoff team. That&rsquo;s where my struggle with Trae&rsquo;s perceived value is. If Trae is truly a star, this roster seems good enough (on paper) to be a lot better than they were.</p>

      <label for="lhququs" class="commentText"><p>I hate to be &ldquo;That guy&rdquo; but you are 100% on point, with a logically following conclusion - Trae is a Negative.</p>

<p>I watch Hawks as a Serb, for Bogdan. And I am not necessarily 100% in support of Serbian players,I criticize them when deserved - on the other side, I even got to like many of the Hawks and Nuggets players, as I watch them all the time</p>

<p>I love Okongwu and I believe he has a greater potential. I was devastated that Hawks got rid of AJ, I believe in JJs potential, just as much as I would like Jamal to get out of the slump, consider AG a honorary Serb, I cant get a smile of my face whenever young Braun does something insane, and so on</p>

<p>I honestly cant stand to watch Trae&rsquo;s game. He is suffocating what ever talent is there around him. A guy shooting .33 for the career has the green light to shoot beyond Steph Range ? That&rsquo;s some f&rsquo;ed up shit.</p>

<p>As far as team landscapes, or what is typically considered parity, the NFL takes the cake. With limited games in a season a few sprained ankles can make a contender on paper into a non playoff team plus having a one and done playoff format means a terrific team having an off night can lead to an easy upset win.</p>

<p>Where the NBA shines over most sports is strategy:
Before Jordan no one thought you could win without an elite big man to center an offense around, in the 90s everyone was seeking tall athletic guards who could attack the basket, in the 2000s everyone was trying to build inside/outside duos like Shaq and Kobe, in the early part of 2010 everyone wanted a big 3, in the late 2000s 3pt shooting point guards playing off the high screen and roll was all anyone wanted to run, now were back to versatile offensive big men.</p>

<p>In the NBA &ldquo;lost arts&rdquo; are always being revived, different positions are always getting the premium treatment, rules constantly looking to be changed&hellip;eras getting harder and harder to compare.</p>

<p>The NBA is ever evolving</p>

      <label for="lhqe85l" class="commentText"><p>I think the exciting part of the NBA is when we do get that different style and it catches everyone off guard. Jokic didn&rsquo;t suddenly learn how to pass the ball and shoot jumpers as a big, he was doing that before he was drafted and every team still passed on drafting him because no one knew how to make that work in a system - then Denver figured it out and now everyone wants a jokic on their team.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s always a team in the league experimenting with a new way to play or centering their success on a player no one else would, and looking out for them is always fun. There&rsquo;s one every year I feel. NBA pundits on ESPN like to pretend they always saw it coming which is probably what kills the effect until they win (because pundits never expect the different team to win) but don&rsquo;t let them take the joy of watching unique teams play.</p>

      <label for="lhpce1k" class="commentText"><p>My roommate and I were talking earlier about this. It’s why I don’t think we should hold it against Giannis or Jokic if they each finish their careers with “just” the one title each of them currently has. There is a lot more high-end talent now, and it’s largely spread out across different teams. That will naturally make it harder to sustain a championship window.</p>

PHX was building something interesting, but the finals run was ahead of schedule and they still had a lot of work to do before they would be considered an established team. The Hawks run was fun but they started from the play-in and they were never an established team. The warriors did look lost and I was guilty as anyone else as exaggerating the state of decline, but it was a really bad run of injuries that derailed them for two years.</p>

<p>The Warriors and Steph are stubborn. They are gonna burn him out Kobe style on his last years. After the Olympics perhaps Steph has a paradigm shift and will bless a trade. This Warriors team is not going anywhere. Draymond needs to go too before he is exposed as over the hill.</p>

<p>Suns and Nets made a bet, ironically involving the same main piece in Durant. It’s asking too much to ask the older pieces in a big 3 to play all sides of the ball like madmen for 39 minutes for 106 games.</p>

<p>I don’t fault these teams but Brooklyn did it right and cut bait. Phoenix needs to do as well. Even though their owner says 20 teams would trade rosters and picks in a second.. almost none would.</p>

      <label for="lhpbkh8" class="commentText"><p>Yep, you could argue that Harden and Irving showed everyone who they are and Brooklyn didn’t believe them. You could also argue that if they had a coach like Mike Brown or even the older version of Doc Rovers instead of a rookie coach in Nash, they woulda came out ok</p>

<p>Boston has their championship team returning next year and their 2 biggest stars locked up for a long time.</p>

<p>The Celtics are not going anywhere.</p>

      <label for="lhpbie5" class="commentText"><p>The Celtics have a great roster and a chance to be competitive for years to come but you can’t say for certain they aren’t going anywhere. All it takes is one injury to Tatum/Brown (which I hope never happens) and that changes things a bit. Guys could regress. Guys could demand a trade.  Off the court issues could take place. A lot can happen. Nothing is guaranteed</p>
