    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I think it was Bob Myers or someone from ESPN who said that the NBA is the fastest league that can have a complete 180.</p>

<p>3 years ago - back in June 2021:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Suns made the NBA Finals and eventually became the runner up. Their future looked bright with possible several deep playoff runs with young guys like Booker Ayton and Bridges. Booker is the only one left.</p></li>

<li><p>The Atlanta Hawks made the East Finals. Back then, they were expected to have multiple playoff appearances but they just went to the lottery this year.</p></li>

<li><p>The Warriors looked lost. Missed playoffs for the 2nd straight year. Won the chip the very next year and now back to the lottery again.</p></li>

<li><p>Nets losing in the 2021 ECSF. They were primed to have a revenge season to win the chip in 2022, while expecting A FULL season of KD Kyrie and Harden. Kyrie went into a sabbatical, Harden left midseason and they were swept in 2022.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In 3 years, none of those superstars are there in Brooklyn. Nets are back in the lottery having a fire sale and tanking.</p>

<p>Damn.</p>

      <label for="lhpd7qr" class="commentText"><p>The thing about the NFL is that teams with good QBs tend to move Heaven and Earth to keep them, and those teams tend to have the best chances year-to-year. I think the AFC had a period where only the Patriots, Ravens, Steelers, and Peyton Manning had made the Super Bowl out of the conference for well over a decade. Mahomes, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow have a good chance at having a similar hold on the conference for the next 5-10 years.</p>

      <label for="lhpde19" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, the NBA is actually one of the slower leagues as far as change goes, imo.</p>

<p>Great teams tend to stay great for a while (Warriors Dynasty, LeBron‚Äôs Cavs teams, the Celtics have been perpetually in the hunt for the last half-decade, etc.) and awful teams take a long time to actually turn around (like, how long till Detroit goes deep in the playoffs?)</p>

<p>The NFL certainly has some mainstays (Chiefs, Eagles), but teams can legitimately go from deep playoff run to bottom 6 in a blink (and go back just as quickly).</p>

      <label for="lhpkvem" class="commentText"><p>I see what you&rsquo;re saying, and I agree. But I think what you both highlight is the impact of player movement. The post mentioned several teams who lost 1-2 players and now suddenly their championship window is closed.</p>

<p>In the NBA, if you have 2-3 players who are Top 5 at their position, you&rsquo;re going to be contenders every year until they leave. In the NFL that doesn&rsquo;t mean shit because there&rsquo;s 22 guys out there every down. So 1-2 players leaving doesn&rsquo;t dramatically affect your championship window.</p>

      <label for="lhpls1s" class="commentText"><p>True but Detroit managed 30 years without a playoff win in football which was much worse than their basketball streak.</p>

<p>New England‚Äôs run of 9 SBs and 6 SB wins spanned all of those NBA winners, and actually started with the Shaq Lakers and Duncan Spurs. Brady even got another in 21 after Giannis won his.</p>

<p>In the NFL consistency comes from having a top QB basically, as P Manning, Roethlisberger, Rodgers and Brees all led perpetual winners with no actual ‚ÄúBad‚Äù seasons for 15 years each. Wilson had a 9 year run contending in Seattle during that stretch too. Mahomes has had 6 season so far.</p>

<p>So definitely pretty consistent winners at the top in the NFL for the last 2 decades and losers like Detroit can stay losers for a long ass time too.</p>

      <label for="lhp80b6" class="commentText"><p>Yup, the takeaway from this is that teams should seize each and every possible opportunity to feasibly win a championship. Stumbling around and hesitating to make (actual) win-now moves is very unwise. Denver is a prime example. Two years of contetion were wiped out with Jamal Murray having been injured. They won in 2023 but just over a year later they&rsquo;ve lost a key starter and there&rsquo;s no real way for them to plug that hole.</p>

<p>As for Hawks I‚Äôm not sure what happened, idk if Nate lost the locker room or what but they played amazing from the time he took over till they got eliminated in 2021 then it was downhill from there. Iirc they had the best record in the league from the time Nate took over till the end of the regular season.</p>

And even though the reporting seems to indicate that Trae Young is generally not a great guy to get along with, the worst thing a coach can do is lose the room and you gotta fire a coach who has lost the room.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s similar to Frank Vogel (although I think Vogel is a much better coach). It&rsquo;s not his fault the Lakers got rid of a bunch of 3&amp;D guys to get Russ, but once they did and the locker room was out, you gotta fire him!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the life of an NBA coach.</p>

      <label for="lhpdnkz" class="commentText"><p>I know this isn&rsquo;t important to the point you&rsquo;ve made, but for what its worth, I don&rsquo;t think the Hawks or Warriors are materially in much of a different spot today than they were in 2021.</p>

<p>When a team makes the finals, there&rsquo;s about six months where this sub thinks of that team as a finals team. And when a team makes the play-in, there&rsquo;s about six months where this sub thinks of that team as a play-in team. What gets lost sometimes in that is the idea that there actually isn&rsquo;t that much real estate between a play-in team vs a finals team. The difference is basically eight, ten games. That can easily be accounted for with trades, luck with injuries, player development, other teams players declining, etc.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is, if would not surprise me that much if Atlanta and Golden State both made the conference finals this year, nor would it shock me much if both teams were in the play-in. There&rsquo;s just not as big a difference between those types of teams as people seem to believe.</p>

It‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt think we should hold it against Giannis or Jokic if they each finish their careers with ‚Äújust‚Äù the one title each of them currently has. There is a lot more high-end talent now, and it‚Äôs largely spread out across different teams. That will naturally make it harder to sustain a championship window.</p>

      <label for="lhpm8h6" class="commentText"><p>I think it‚Äôs because the championship can still be won by a team that isn‚Äôt the Chiefs. Things can still break the wrong way in a game, and we get the Rams/Bengals SB. That doesn‚Äôt happen in basketball because it‚Äôs a series and the better team pretty much always wins, barring major injury.</p>

<p>The Rams were a good team the year they won it (only 1 game back of the 1 seed). Yeah, the Bengals were a surprise, but so were the Mavs this year in the NBA.</p>

Before that, Jordan in the 90s was in a similar place, as long as he was around and in shape, they were winning it all, guaranteed.</p>

      <label for="lhp9o1d" class="commentText"><p>Overdue trades and small market constraints‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Atlanta gave up too early. No confidence in the core that ‚Äúoverachieved‚Äù. Hawks need to free Trae. I think he‚Äôs moved this year before deadline.</p>

<p>The Warriors and Steph are stubborn. They are gonna burn him out Kobe style on his last years. After the Olympics perhaps Steph has a paradigm shift and will bless a trade. This Warriors team is not going anywhere. Draymond needs to go too before he is exposed as over the hill.</p>

<p>Suns and Nets made a bet, ironically involving the same main piece in Durant. It‚Äôs asking too much to ask the older pieces in a big 3 to play all sides of the ball like madmen for 39 minutes for 106 games.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt fault these teams but Brooklyn did it right and cut bait. Phoenix needs to do as well. Even though their owner says 20 teams would trade rosters and picks in a second.. almost none would.</p>
