</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I thought this was interesting, because it’s the only example of writers voting for a GOAT during a league anniversary, and an earlier example of the GOAT debate happening.</p>

<p>The results were as follows:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/nba_35th_anniversary.html" target="_blank">https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/nba_35th_anniversary.html</a></p>

<p>GOAT: Bill Russell</p>

<p>GOAT coach: Red Auerbach</p>

<p>GOAT team: 1967 76ers (won a then record 68 games with Wilt, ended a run of 8 straight Celtics championships)</p>

<p>All-time team (alphabetical order):</p>

<p>C	Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</p>

<p>F	Elgin Baylor</p>

<p>C	Wilt Chamberlain</p>

<p>G	Bob Cousy</p>

<p>F	Julius Erving</p>

<p>G/F	John Havlicek</p>

<p>C	George Mikan</p>

<p>F	Bob Pettit</p>

<p>G	Oscar Robertson</p>

<p>C	Bill Russell</p>

<p>G	Jerry West</p>

<p>Some notes: NBA team rosters were only 11 players at the time, explaining the small squads. It increased to 12 the next year and stayed that way for years.</p>

<p>The biggest snub off the top of my head then would maybe be someone like Dolph Schayes or Rick Barry. From 35 years there’s only really one player (Mikan) who accomplished the most during the league’s first ten years, while 8 of the 11 were in the league at the same time in the early 60s</p>

<p>Anyway, very neat. Haven’t seen this before.</p>

<p>There’s some other cool stuff on this page: <a href="https://www.apbr.org/oldtimrs.html" target="_blank">https://www.apbr.org/oldtimrs.html</a></p>

<p>Most notably a vote for greatest player of the century in 1999 (so just a GOAT list) with Jordan, <em>Oscar</em>, Wilt, Russell, Magic, Bird, Kareem in order. Only a seven person panel (albeit a stacked one) but always struck me how low Kareem was.</p>

<p>There’s also a 1950 vote for greatest player of the last 50 years. Mikan was only 25-years-old when he won.</p>

<p>It unironically began shifting because of Bill Simmons.  If you were even passively looking at sports forums towards the end of the 2000s, there was a noticeable and pretty immediate shift towards reevaluating Kareem after Simmons made the case for him being top-3 in <em>The Book of Basketball</em>.</p>

<p>If you only know Simmons in his current position, it&rsquo;s very hard to understand how much of a touchstone that book was for basketball discourse.</p>

<p>With that being said, I fully expect Kareem to fade from that position back to top-6ish (where he spent most of his post-career in popular discourse) in the next decade or so.  While Simmons played a big role in starting it, a large part of why it has continued is because a not insignificant number of NBA fans have begun to value longevity over most anything else since, because of one player in particular (Lebron).  Kareem greatly benefits from that value system as well.</p>

<p>^(although i do think people who discredit Wilt and Bill for playing in the late 60s but don&rsquo;t discredit Kareem&rsquo;s early career need to learn a little more about the history of the league)</p>

      <label for="lk1sbyd" class="commentText"><p>I think the shift started in the mid-80s. The Kareem nadir was in the late 70s or early 80s. He had grabbed a number of MVPs, an FMVP and a ring with the Bucks, but his stint with the Lakers left a lot to be desired. He was aloof with the media and fans and not very popular. Then the Lakers added Magic and won right away and had deep playoff runs for the next decade; and Magic was a media darling, always ready for a great quote, and was also appealing to fans. So Magic got a lot of that credit in the early 80s, and rightfully so.</p>

<p>The Kareem erasure lessened up in the mid 80s. He broke Wilt&rsquo;s scoring title late in the 1984 season, and then won the FMVP in 1985. He was named <em>Sports Illutrated Sportsman of the Year</em> at the end of that calendar year (1985). In the 1986 All Star Game the NBA threw together a panel of GMs and coaches and former players and asked them to pick the GOAT, and <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/gjaxv2/at_the_1986_allstar_game_a_60person_panel_made_up/" target="_blank">they picked Kareem</a>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a quote from Doug Moe (ABA player who also had a long coaching career) from that aforementioned SI article: &ldquo;Six or seven years ago I thought he was not a good player. He didn&rsquo;t seem to have the interest—he wasn&rsquo;t there. He&rsquo;s 10 times better now; he hasn&rsquo;t played any better in his career than in the last two years. He&rsquo;s 38, and he&rsquo;s a <em>bitch</em>.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lk1bvvp" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll fade back considering modern basketball discourse favors him like you said. Another thing that hurt Kareem is that he was unpopular and not the endearing media personality that Magic was. A lot of people underrated Kareem because they also didn&rsquo;t want to rate him over Russell or even Wilt for that matter. Kareem also has done a lot post-career to really shifted his public perception and given him a lot more respect.</p>

      <label for="lk20wc9" class="commentText"><p>I remember how it went in 92 and 93. MJ was considered &ldquo;GOAT level&rdquo; after his second championship.</p>

<p>The 1993 3-peat was what solidified it, though. He was definitely in the conversation after 1992 just because of how dominant he was.</p>

<p>But, at the time, the 3-peat was a big deal because nobody had done it since the Celtics in the 60s.</p>

<p>The fact that he broke the finals scoring record in the process - all while leading a comeback in game 6 on the Suns&rsquo; home floor against the regular season MVP (Barkley) - was talked about constantly.</p>

<p>He was on the Level of Magic and Bird as far as greats of their era by 92. That 3-peat in 93 pushed MJ up to #1 all-time for a lot of people, though. It was like &ldquo;Oh, this guy is like Wilt&rsquo;s stats/individual dominance, Russell&rsquo;s winning/leadership and Robertson&rsquo;s skill/IQ all rolled into one player.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he came back and the Bulls won 3 more it kind of blew everyone&rsquo;s mind. One or two more championships was expected. But that 1998 championship, completing the second 3-peat with that game winner, was the thing elevated MJ to mythical status.</p>

<p>Before MJ, the idea of winning with a high-scoring shooting guard as your best player with no dominant/All-star-level center, was seen as a ridiculous feat to overcome.</p>

<p>The fact that MJ 3-peated twice under those circumstances really broke everyone&rsquo;s traditional ideas of &ldquo;winning basketball&rdquo; in a way similar to Curry.</p>

      <label for="lk0bp5s" class="commentText"><p>All that stat chasing in the first part of Wilt’s career did not win championships. There were two problems with Wilt’s offense, tremendous though it was.</p>

<p>First, he was predictable. Normally he was focused almost entirely on scoring, and not passing, regardless of whether he was double or triple teamed. One year he responded to criticism by focusing almost <em>entirely</em> on passing, not scoring. But again he was predictable, and his own defender was free to roam and help on other players.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Wilt often made his pass with little time left so his teammate had no choice but to shoot, whether open or not. No hockey assists for Wilt!</p>

<p>The ideal offensive center mixes it up like Nikola Jokic so that the defense never knows what to expect. It’s too bad no one kept track of triple doubles back then, or Wilt might have had a stat that encouraged him to mix it up. (The triple double was coined by fans of Magic Johnson in the 1980s who wanted to counter the narrative that Magic didn’t score enough.)</p>

<p>Second, the energy Wilt spent on offense meant he had less energy for defense, especially since he played long minutes in almost every game including lots of rough 1960s travel and back-to-back games. Later in his career, from the 1967-67 season through the 1972-73 season, Wilt finally focused on defense and won championships in 1967 and 1972.</p>

<p>However, Wilt was once again stubborn about it. Having finally agreed to change his game and focus more on defense, he often passed up easy scoring opportunities. As Frank DeFord wrote for <em>Sports Illustrated</em> in January 1969:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The main problem [for the Lakers] on the court is not that Chamberlain, Baylor and West do not get the ball enough. It is that Chamberlain will not—or cannot—go to the basket when he does get it. In other words, the fantastic Laker juggernaut lacks a sufficient offense to carry it; the team has been reduced to depending on its defense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://vault.si.com/vault/1969/01/27/on-topbut-in-trouble" target="_blank">https://vault.si.com/vault/1969/01/27/on-topbut-in-trouble</a></p>

<p>Despite assembling the first superteam with a Big Three of Wilt, Elgin Baylor, and Jerry West, there were already signs of trouble in January 1969. And although the Lakers made it to the Finals that season, they improbably lost in seven games to an aging Celtics team led by player/coach Bill Russell in his last year before retirement.</p>

<p>Similarly, in 1973, when the reigning champion Lakers were beset by injuries to players other than Wilt, Wilt seemed absorbed by breaking the record for most <em>efficient</em> shooting, as noted in a March 1973 <em>Sports Illustrated</em> staff article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chamberlain’s taste in shots is considerably more conservative these days than his taste in overcoats. He rarely tries his fallaway one-hander or his underhanded finger roll anymore. He limits himself mostly to dunks, tips and lay-ins, and even these are shot sparingly. To rank among the best shooters in the NBA listings this week, Chamberlain needed at least 440 field-goal attempts. He had 460. He will need 560 shots by the end of the season to win the accuracy title and possibly set a new record. He should make it—just barely.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same article reveals that retired great Bill Russell publicly accused Wilt of stat chasing, as Wilt himself noted when denying it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>”Sure, I’m careful how I shoot. I’m not about to throw the ball away. But it’s not like Bill Russell says on TV, that I’m not willing to shoot as much because I’m worried about my percentage.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To paraphrase Shakespeare’s Hamlet, the gentleman doth protest too much, methinks.</p>

<p>Once again this was a sign of trouble to come. The Lakers made it to the Finals for a rematch with the New York Knicks, a team they easily beat four games to one in  the 1973 Finals. But this time the Knicks won easily, four games to one, with Wilt scoring a measly 11.6 points per game despite the fact that Jerry West was hobbled and averaged only 16 points per game. Wilt could not or would not pick up the slack.</p>

      <label for="lk0dxj7" class="commentText"><p>Wilt seems like a classic target for sportwriters and fans. He was so good and so talented that nothing he did was ever enough. I that 1969 season, he averaged 20 points and 21 rebounds at 32 years old on high efficiency, while playing 45 minutes per game. In that 1973 season, he averaged 13 and 18 at 36 years old, while playing 82 games and making the all defensive team. It just seems like one of those things where fans and writers don&rsquo;t appreciate greatness and want to nitpick.</p>

      <label for="lk0fbdo" class="commentText"><p>Wilt famously clashed with management, coaches, and teammates, too. No one doubted his physical abilities or talent, and yes he did play long minutes without complaint. But it’s remarkable to see comments about the years in which he won championships, and how teammates and coaches remarked on Wilt’s willingness to practice, listen to the coach, and do whatever was best for the team.</p>

<p>Although meant as compliments, these comments suggest that Wilt did <em>not</em> want to do that in most seasons, and that if he had he would have won more championships. And other facts confirm this. At one point he actually lived in New York City and played for Philadelphia, which meant team practices had to be held in the afternoon and Wilt still might skip them.</p>

<p>He was a target because he was a bit of a little bitch. (I say that with all respect, lol.)</p>

<p>What I mean is that he was viewed as a complainer and quitter.</p>

<ul>
<li>He quit college after two years the Jayhawks came up short, and went to play for the Globe Trotters instead.</li>
<li>After his Sixers got bounced by the Celtics in 1960 (his rookie year), he announced he was quitting basketball. (Imagine if Ant had said he was going to retire this year after losing to the Mavs - he would get shit on, and rightfully so.)</li>
<li>He got traded multiple times <em>in his prime</em>. That tells you something right there.</li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s understandable why local sportswriters would not be willing to sing his praises when he threatens to quit, complains about getting bullied in the paint, and demands trades.</p>

      <label for="lk1fia4" class="commentText"><p>So many people overthink Wilt. His stat chasing isn’t what kept him from winning titles, his teams in Philly could never match up to the Celtics. Those Celtics teams had triple the talent and arguably(certainly at the time) the GOAT coach to top it off</p>

<p>Despite that, Wilt took them to 7 in 62 and 65, beat them 4-1 in 67, and took them to 7 again in 68.</p>

<p>People look at this as failure because they’re ring-brained as fuck, but the reality is that these were Herculean efforts to make what should’ve been blowout series incredibly close.</p>

<p>I don’t think there’s any player in history that consistently leads these Philly teams over those Celtics. I’m not sure how many ever even push it to 7. Those teams were the 60s equivalent of the KD Warriors, but without any drama or injuries and a better coach. We rightfully don’t blame LeBron for getting run out of the gym in back-to-back seasons by them. He lost in 5 games once and got swept the other time.</p>

<p>Wilt was pushing the Celtics hard at least and often going the distance.</p>

      <label for="lk1nl9u" class="commentText"><p>Amazingly inaccurate and revisionist history. Bob Cousy was the league MVP when Russell was a rookie. Heinsohn joined the Celtics the same year as Russell did - they were rookies together. Heinsohn was already good enough to be an all-star and win ROTY.</p>

<p>Russell didn&rsquo;t magically turn Sam Jones into a top-5 scorer in the league at his peak. He didn&rsquo;t give birth to and bottle feed John Havlicek to superstardom. He led the Celtics to a 68 win season after Russell retired and followed that up with a FMVP. The list goes on.</p>

<p>Russell&rsquo;s an amazing player, he&rsquo;s top-10 all-time without question. Let&rsquo;s not lie about his teammates, diminish their own greatness, and undermine the work <em>they</em> put in to be great just to make the point and throw in a false dig at Wilt while we&rsquo;re at it.</p>

      <label for="lk2793u" class="commentText"><p>I’ll grant you Cousy and Havlicek, both first-ballot Hall of Fame inductees. But note that their years with Russell overlapped very little, at the end of Cousy’s career and the beginning of Havlicek’s. So the Celtics never even had a Big Three.</p>

<p>But Bill Sharman, Frank Ramsey, Tommy Heinsohn, K.C. Jones, and Sam Jones were not first ballot Hall of Famers. Sharman took 15 years to be inducted. Ramsey took 18 years, Heinsohn 21 years, K.C. Jones 22 years, Sam Jones 23 years.</p>

<p>The people who knew these players best did not think they were Hall of Fame players. Rather, years later, other, younger voters were dazzled by rings.</p>

<p>Bill Sharman was a four time champion, Frank Ramsey was a seven time champion, Tommy Heinsohn was an eight time champions, K.C. Jones was an eight time champion with Russell in the NBA and a two time champion with Russell in college, and  Sam Jones was a ten time champion. Many years after becoming eligible, new voters less familiar with their games figured all those rings had to count for something.</p>

<p>Surely Bill Russell wasn’t so dominant that he could win 11 championships in a 13 year career with just one true Hall of Famer (first Cousy, then Havlicek) helping him out. So they voted in five more Celtics who weren’t top tier Hall of Fame players at all, as their contemporaries knew.</p>

      <label for="lk0c11o" class="commentText"><p>I think this is not only ahistorical, but goes against the fundamentals of basketball. First and foremost, the job of a 1960s center was essentially “designated scorer“. The coaching philosophy of every team with a dominant big man was dump it into the big man and let him score. Wilt did what was asked of him. If you want to make the argument that he should’ve gotten his teammates more involved, I won’t argue against that, but that’s simply not the way he was coached.</p>

<p>I would actually argue that nearly every shot taken by Wilt Chamberlain was a higher percentage shot than any he could’ve created by moving the ball around. Guards and wings shoot their teams out of games, not centers who are consistently in the top three for fg%. The more logical answer is that Wilt won when he scored less, because he had better teammates, so he had less scoring responsibility. This makes far more sense than “wilt played the wrong way” narratives.</p>

      </div>
      <label for="lk1hi8k" class="commentText"><p>There were three big changes. First, the NBA brought over the three point shot from the ABA in the 1976 merger. That change was already in place at the time of this survey, but was still new and viewed as a gimmick. It took decades for players and coaches to take full advantage of the three point shot, and the increase in such shots still hasn’t leveled off.</p>

<p>Second, the NBA legalized the zone defense in 2001, a/k/a the anti-Shaq rule. While the change helped reduce the dominance of offensive giants like Shaq, it also reduced scoring from other positions. Scoring declined around the league.</p>

<p>Defense became more important than offense. The Detroit Pistons proved this when they won the 2004 championship with stifling team defense and a below average offense. Their defensive rating was 2nd out of 29 teams in the league, but their offensive rating was 18th out of 29 teams. Not since the days of Bill Russell had defense been so dominant, and Detroit’s Ben Wallace seemed like the second coming of Bill Russell.</p>

<p>The NBA knows offense sells tickets. They looked for a way to keep low post offense in check while opening up perimeter offense. This wasn’t a secret — the NBA rule makers stated their intentions. They introduced a new rule banning hand-checking. They clarified the rule on blocking fouls and told officials to enforce it strictly. And they told officials to pay attention to anyone standing in the paint and call defensive three seconds strictly. So there was the new rule plus more emphasis on two old rules.</p>

<p>These changes made it almost impossible to legally prevent a skilled perimeter player from driving to the basket without a double team. If the defender can’t put his hand on a man (hand check) or block a man with his body then he can’t resist his move towards the basket or steer him in a lateral direction.</p>

<p>Ususlly the best a perimeter defender  can do is run along side the penetrator hoping to strip the ball during his gather or block the ball when he shoots. But if there’s no help on defense that’s very hard to do. The vast majority of defenders now need help to stop penetration.</p>

<p>Even if there is help, the penetrator has several options. He can pull up and shoot a short floater that’s a high percentage shot. He can toss the ball to a wide open big teammate in the pick and roll. Or he can toss the ball back out to a wide open three point shooters on the perimeter. The help on the drive has to come from somewhere, and that means someone is open.</p>

<p>So yes, the effect of the three point shot was gradual over nearly 50 years. But the other two changes in 2001 and 2004 were pretty abrupt. It only took two or three years for teams to learn to take advantage of those rules.</p>

<p>Dolph Schayes or Rick Barry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just looking at scoring, Schayes was 13th and Barry 14th in NBA total points through the 1980 season. Barry lost 5 years to ABA (and the mandated year off while waiting to play there) play.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure there was a real strong case for either of them to be on a team of 11 players who were arguably more decorated to that point (or in Dr. J&rsquo;s case, was the league standard bearer at the time).</p>

      <label for="lk461c2" class="commentText"><p>Those Celtics teams were not nearly as “dominant” as people make them out to be. They were pretty much never the clear run away best team in the league. For perspective Bill Russell still holds the record for most game 7s in NBA history, despite there being an entire extra round of playoffs now. Yet he somehow went 10-0 in game 7s, even with multiple coming down to a 2-3 point game. That’s the most impressive record he holds imo, even more so than him having 11 rings. His teams were not a buzzsaw…Bill Russell just simply could not lose lol</p>

<p>The odds of going 10-0 in game 7s are just absolutely astronomical considering they are almost always <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> games or really close to it. No team is the clear cut favorite as each team has both won 3 and lost 3…yet somehow Russell won the 7th every single time. Just insane</p>

I think KAJ is more comparable to KD. Undoubtedly an all-time great player, a unicorn, tremendously skilled,  top 3 in the league most years in their career, but folks were never clamoring for KD to have the GOAT title like Lebron</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The incessant prattling about all time legacy placement didn&rsquo;t exist in that era like it does today, the current discourse is almost entirely a direct consequence of <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> sports news needing content to fill dead air time.</p>

<p>Even so, when Kareem beat the all time scoring record it was a huge deal, and then he won 3 more titles.  The idea that Kareem was only put on the NBA mount rushmore long after his career was over is just revisionist nonsesnse intended to generate debate and drive engagement just like the GOAT arguments as a whole.</p>
