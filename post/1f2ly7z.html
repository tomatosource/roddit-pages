      <label for="lk8cvsk" class="commentText"><p>Well, that Rockets team was worlds better than the 2018 cavs. But I agree, Harden is unfairly maligned for his performance in the playoffs against the warriors. But the rockets were really constructed to beat the warriors so I can&rsquo;t really say it&rsquo;s quite the same. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, the 2018 cavs were constructed to beat no one. The 2017 cavs, fair enough, though can&rsquo;t really say it&rsquo;s Lebron&rsquo;s fault in those finals. I think his +/- for the series was positive if I&rsquo;m not mistaken</p>

<p>edit: Nope, turns out he was indeed a -7, pretty decidedly too. Was only positive in 2 games. Though you look at how Bron performed, and even despite this, it&rsquo;s tough to see that he did anything other than play outstanding basketball and just lose to a way more stacked team.</p>

      <label for="lk8cig6" class="commentText"><p>No, Capela was pretty consensus the 3rd best player. And there were all the stats about the harden-cp3-capela lineup basically never losing. He was the main defensive presence and cp3 + harden have been so amazing at setting up a dunking big man (especially CP3), so he was better for that team. Gordon was great though, I remember the prior year, he literally got a few all star votes almost entirely because of Harden but you know, was still the 2nd best player on that team by his own merit.</p>

It doesn&rsquo;t take that many brain cells to understand that one is not necessarily more important than the other than it is about having the best mix of both. MVP doesn&rsquo;t always go to the best player on the best team, nor does it always go to the player with the best stats. That&rsquo;s not how the award works. It goes to the most valuable player.</p>

<p>I agree that Harden deserved MVP in 2017 but to say your argument is oversimplifying it would be a massive understatement.</p>

<p>Bro, it was all but dismissed even at the time. And it was longer than 2 months, he did it for 40 games as I recall.</p>

<p>Harden that season had the highest ppg of anyone since MJ’s 37 which was the highest since Wilt. And he did it on spectacular efficiency, while also throwing in 7.5 apg for good measure. And on a team that won 53 games and lost in 6 in the 2nd round to the KD Warriors. How often is that mentioned relative to Fat Hitler jokes?</p>

      <label for="lk7pxhv" class="commentText"><p>Eh, huge Jokic fan, but Luka was pulling off some true heroics, especially pre trades. That team was insanely flawed (as we have been since we drafted him), and he kept the thing afloat. Not saying it was a runaway, and not super upset about Jokic taking it, but he really should’ve been MVP.</p>

<p>Now, he’ll probably get his pity/retroactive MVP this year without actually deserving it hah…</p>

<p>If you apply that to his 36.1ppg from 2018-19 he would be at 37.1ppg. Which as /u/FeralTames pointed out with Luka’s 34/9/10 doesn’t guarantee an MVP at all.</p>

      <label for="lk82pqy" class="commentText"><p>MVP is a comparison among individuals, not teams. You aren&rsquo;t using the right equation by looking at offensive ratings. The amount of individuals scoring over 30 ppg was significantly less back in 2019 than now, which is why 34 ppg is less impressive now than it would have been then. Harden&rsquo;s separation from the rest of the pack is what is important.</p>

<p>You could even say as a result of Harden&rsquo;s impact, less and less shots are being given to roleplayers and funneled back into stars and <em>even still</em> 36 ppg has not been touched.</p>

      <label for="lk84b8s" class="commentText"><p>It’s partly dismissed and forgotten for the same reason that modern games are often forgettable: the playstyle is homogenous and repetitive, largely due to the dictates of analytics.</p>

<p>Look at Harden’s 2019 shot chart <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hardeja01/shooting/2019" target="_blank">here</a>. Harden basically did three things, bomb threes, get layups (his 20 dunks were 1% of his shot diet), and make free throws. These are the most efficient plays in basketball, which is why Morey pushed it, but it all just bleeds into a blur of doing the same things over and over with unlimited usage.</p>

<p>Compare that to Lebron’s 2013 shot chart <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01/shooting/2013" target="_blank">here</a>. Variability is more memorable.</p>

      <label for="lk85uyv" class="commentText"><p>I’d be okay with this - it’s true too, obviously and demonstrably that Harden and those teams ignored the mid-range after a point - if it wasn’t simultaneously used to denigrate Harden’s efficiency.</p>

<p>He’s the only player I’ve ever seen where somehow TS% is suddenly a bad metric, because TS% as it should takes into account free throws, and Harden apparently gets those free throws illegally. So now we can’t use TS with him. Nonsense.</p>

<p>Aesthetics is one thing. That’s obviously going to be very subjective and personal; I happen to think prime Harden killing absolutely everyone off the dribble was very entertaining to watch just aesthetically, but opinions differ there and have little to do with actual impact. Some people think he was dreadful to watch, that’s fine too.</p>

<p>But when you go to effectiveness and efficiency? Harden that year scored 36 ppg on 61.6% TS, that is absolutely humongous offensive output no amount of crying about free throws can diminish, and that’s before you even get to his assists.</p>

<p>I’m well aware of the percentage. And I’m well aware that he loves extremely high volume of difficult shots. These are all part of the conversation from 6 years ago.</p>

<p>But missing 650 threes in a season is equally as baffling as his counting stats.</p>

<p>Kinda miss those days, even though his three point shooting and elite passing era was objectively superior.</p>

<p>The higher and quicker release but being closer to the basket mean they have to be defended similarly to a mid range j, and with Harden&rsquo;s pull up/step back 3 and his quick first step he was blowing by his man then the help guy has to defend the floater, lay up, and lob</p>

<p>Harden is my pick for the best scorer of all time</p>

<p>Wilt and MJ in raw ppg, Kobe probably has him in pace adjusted ppg</p>

<p>I think Harden is a better scorer than any of them due to the way he does it from 3. It lets other players play off of him easier with the increased space and that shows in his assist numbers</p>

      <label for="lk7nsl7" class="commentText"><p>I consider myself a Harden fan, more than most who are where I am in the northeast.</p>

<p>However in retrospect, I can say now objectively Harden was properly rated during that time. His 34 and 36ppg seasons were incredible from a numbers standpoint and you can&rsquo;t argue his teams were probably the only pure counterpart to GSW and many years were the finals before the finals, even if it was in round 2.</p>

<p>That said, the way he scored was pretty unremarkable to the average fan and his style of between the legs dribble into step back 3, between the legs dribble to into pump fake, foul bait.. rip thru and foul bait, then finally an in the lane floater, was exhausting as well as the 12+ free throws a lot of the time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m of the opinion his 36ppg season should have netted him MVP and the season he actually won it probably was not even the one he should have, but I think a few players are capable of these kinda numbers if they played in high usage iso ball with 10 threes a game and 10 free throws a game. It&rsquo;s just not how you win in the post-season.</p>

<p>I think Luka could do this, I think KD could have done this any season he wanted, Lebron could do it, Kawhi maybe, but ya, Harden is neither underrated or overrated for that stretch, it was cool, but the context makes it less so.</p>

<p>NBA fans overvalue championships when no other sport scrutinizes that same thing to the same extent when judging greatness - championships in those sports are consistently viewed as “gravy” and how a guy played is what actually counts.</p>

<p>If this same standard was applied to NBA players, Harden would popularly be considered a first ballot guy (as he already is imo)</p>

      <label for="lk7swx5" class="commentText"><p>not always. but I do agree that the issue primarily is that people tend not to dive into the context of why they didn’t win one</p>

<p>in the case of Harden it was mostly the fact that he shared his prime with the greatest team of all time and when he had his best chance of getting one in 2021 his hamstring exploded</p>

<p>that being said his performance definitely dropped off slightly in the playoffs in his prime and he has some really famous stinkers in big moments. and I think the tale of Harden is strong proof that heliocentric teams that get almost all their offense from one place have a hard ceiling. typically if Harden wasn’t amazing, Houston would lose. it’s a formula that’s too difficult to sustain when the league is this talented</p>

<p>so while Harden had shit luck I think it should be acknowledged that his playstyle itself had at least a little to do with it</p>

<p>Harden was iron man and carried teams on his back regardless of who was hurt or healthy. He played and he took them where they needed to go.</p>

<p>Once curry loses some support, they shut him down, cuz he’s incapable of playing enough minutes and his game doesn’t translate to carrying a team.</p>

<p>Harden is so much better than Curry and that comparison is fundamental to my original comment.</p>

      <label for="lk7ur4s" class="commentText"><p>No idea where you get the thought that other sports don’t value championships. In football Marino is constantly dropped out of GOAT convos for his lack of a ring and the two at the top before Mahomes, Brady and Montana, were there for their rings. Until Brady hit his 3rd prime it was the same NBA conversation actually. Joe was 4-0 and Brady had 2 L’s. Hard to argue once Brady has 7 rings though. And in the other football, I can’t even begin to count the amount of people that would refuse to put Messi over Pele due to his not having a World Cup win until 2022.</p>

<p>Every sport assigns a massive amount of weight to championships, and even if the NBA discourse is slightly heavier on rings than other sports, NBA players are 20% of the their team on the court compared to less than 10% for either of the others. 1 NBA player can do more to influence his team’s chance of winning than 1 Football or Soccer player.</p>

      <label for="lk7g8wh" class="commentText"><p>This might be a hater take but I think what will always hurt Harden&rsquo;s legacy is that he never dominated like that in the playoffs. And I think a lot of that had to with teams scheming hard against him, not hesitating to double or triple team, and then the tighter whistle in the playoffs which took away his greatest strength. Harden is such a problem to guard in the regular season because if you touch him it&rsquo;s a foul, so guys were guarding him in weird ways like with their hands behind their back.</p>

<p>As a scorer I&rsquo;m still going to take Kobe because his scoring translated to the playoffs, plus he is was much much better off ball.</p>

      <label for="lk85uvz" class="commentText"><p>The stepback / sidestep three made an insane amount of space, and if you somehow stayed with him, he was jumping into you or bringing his arms into your arm, so you hit him during his shot.</p>

<p>You finally lean into the stepback and cover it well without being even slightly out of positon, so he drives past you and his first look is a shooter in the corner with a help defender dropping, then Capela over the top to keep the big honest, then the cradle / euro once he&rsquo;s forced any help to stay home</p>

<p>The cradles / euro layups were unstoppable one on one because he&rsquo;d use his body to seal you off, make space, and finish since he was strong as shit and had an insane touch.  If you try to reach in and interrupt the euro or cradle by tying up the ball, he&rsquo;d hook your arm, make you foul him, and have the touch to make it anyway.</p>

<p>You stay up on him, force him to drive, your team makes good rotations, helps down on him, and he can&rsquo;t just make a pass to an open shot?  Then he throws up an extremely consistent floater that you are not allowed to contest without getting your arm hooked and sending him to the line again.</p>

<p>The dude broke the game.  He was completely unguardable.  His game would still be insanely effective with the new system of offensive fouls (like 30 ppg instead of 36), but god damn was it effective with the old ruleset.</p>

<p>Regardless of what you think about the ethics of his style, he will always be remembered as a player the league had to nerf.  That&rsquo;s a wild legacy to me and the further removed from it I am the more I respect it in a way.</p>

      <label for="lk7ktzm" class="commentText"><p>Lets be fair here, he was/will be known as someone who benefited from foul baiting/superstar-whistle to where people were afraid to guard him physically, opening up shots that weren’t there come playoffs (he abused tf out of the rip through move to the point they no longer counted it towards a shooting foul), not to mention the abundance of free throws artificially boosted shooting efficiency numbers as a result of those “attempts” not counting and inflated his scoring statistics. Plus they were really fast and loose with what counted as a legal “step back” jumper and not just a travel, where it’s pretty easy to get separation if you can take 4-5 shuffle steps without dribbling</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, he’s still an all-time great scorer in his prime (at least regular season wise) and I don’t necessarily think he didn’t deserve those MVP’s, but the numbers don’t tell the truth, IMO.</p>

Harden&rsquo;s peak absolutely rivals Kobe&rsquo;s peak (don&rsquo;t think it surpasses but it&rsquo;s a convo that can be had), which isn&rsquo;t a diss to Kobe, but more a testament to how insane Harden was, which will be appreciated when he retires. It&rsquo;s beginning to be appreciated a bit more now that he&rsquo;s not creating as much drama these days.</p>
