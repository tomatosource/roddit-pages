<p>Listen to how mad Chris Webber was. He’s seen this before. Happy he was calling that game. Butterfly effects are crazy, if foster makes even one of those calls I think the 0-27 never happens.</p>

I know it sounds dramatic, but being an European and having to stay up til early morning just to watch that was crushing, watched pretty much every Rockets game that season. Having it all be for nothing, sacrificing sleep etc. I still remember how I felt, just in disbelief. Refs were pissing me off, but goddamn we couldn’t hit a shot either. It just felt unreal, I had faith that surely we would hit one, but we just didn’t. Saying this, that team is still  one of my favorite sports teams of all time.</p>

      <label for="lk8cvsk" class="commentText"><p>Well, that Rockets team was worlds better than the 2018 cavs. But I agree, Harden is unfairly maligned for his performance in the playoffs against the warriors. But the rockets were really constructed to beat the warriors so I can&rsquo;t really say it&rsquo;s quite the same. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, the 2018 cavs were constructed to beat no one. The 2017 cavs, fair enough, though can&rsquo;t really say it&rsquo;s Lebron&rsquo;s fault in those finals. I think his +/- for the series was positive if I&rsquo;m not mistaken</p>

<p>edit: Nope, turns out he was indeed a -7, pretty decidedly too. Was only positive in 2 games. Though you look at how Bron performed, and even despite this, it&rsquo;s tough to see that he did anything other than play outstanding basketball and just lose to a way more stacked team.</p>

      <label for="lk8cig6" class="commentText"><p>No, Capela was pretty consensus the 3rd best player. And there were all the stats about the harden-cp3-capela lineup basically never losing. He was the main defensive presence and cp3 + harden have been so amazing at setting up a dunking big man (especially CP3), so he was better for that team. Gordon was great though, I remember the prior year, he literally got a few all star votes almost entirely because of Harden but you know, was still the 2nd best player on that team by his own merit.</p>

      <label for="lk82hbe" class="commentText"><p>MVP is stats X narrative X team success and it changes every year which gets weighted higher but it’s pretty subjective</p>

<p>Russ had 30/10/10 and one of the greatest narrative scores in recent nba history the year he won over harden and Giannis had <sup>28</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> and was second in DPOY on a 60 win team the year he won it over harden</p>

<p>Harden only having 1 is totally fine in the history of the nba even if he had insane counting stats</p>

Not to say he wouldn’t have still scored 32 a game without it, but people will always remember the ugly. Same reason KD still gets flak for running to GS. Same reason Karl Malone doesn’t exist in legacy discussions.</p>

<p>I appreciate the crazy shit he was doing, but I will always remember him hooking arms and flinging his head back like a sniper shot him</p>

It doesn&rsquo;t take that many brain cells to understand that one is not necessarily more important than the other than it is about having the best mix of both. MVP doesn&rsquo;t always go to the best player on the best team, nor does it always go to the player with the best stats. That&rsquo;s not how the award works. It goes to the most valuable player.</p>

<p>I agree that Harden deserved MVP in 2017 but to say your argument is oversimplifying it would be a massive understatement.</p>

<p>Bro, it was all but dismissed even at the time. And it was longer than 2 months, he did it for 40 games as I recall.</p>

<p>Harden that season had the highest ppg of anyone since MJ’s 37 which was the highest since Wilt. And he did it on spectacular efficiency, while also throwing in 7.5 apg for good measure. And on a team that won 53 games and lost in 6 in the 2nd round to the KD Warriors. How often is that mentioned relative to Fat Hitler jokes?</p>

<p>If that happened today, the guy would be averaging over 40 points a game and would be a unanimous MVP lol. scoring has inflated a lot since 2019 and still nobody has touched 36 ppg</p>

That team was insanely flawed (as we have been since we drafted him), and he kept the thing afloat. Not saying it was a runaway, and not super upset about Jokic taking it, but he really should’ve been MVP.</p>

<p>Now, he’ll probably get his pity/retroactive MVP this year without actually deserving it hah…</p>

      <label for="lk84b8s" class="commentText"><p>It’s partly dismissed and forgotten for the same reason that modern games are often forgettable: the playstyle is homogenous and repetitive, largely due to the dictates of analytics.</p>

<p>Look at Harden’s 2019 shot chart <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hardeja01/shooting/2019" target="_blank">here</a>. Harden basically did three things, bomb threes, get layups (his 20 dunks were 1% of his shot diet), and make free throws. These are the most efficient plays in basketball, which is why Morey pushed it, but it all just bleeds into a blur of doing the same things over and over with unlimited usage.</p>

<p>Compare that to Lebron’s 2013 shot chart <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01/shooting/2013" target="_blank">here</a>. Variability is more memorable.</p>

<p>For context, curry has never been over 886 attempts and the most misses he’s had in a season was 519 at age 35</p>

It’s that he does both and it’s a basterdization of the game. It’s extremely hard to root for that kinda playstyle</p>

      <label for="lk7ur4s" class="commentText"><p>No idea where you get the thought that other sports don’t value championships. In football Marino is constantly dropped out of GOAT convos for his lack of a ring and the two at the top before Mahomes, Brady and Montana, were there for their rings. Until Brady hit his 3rd prime it was the same NBA conversation actually. Joe was 4-0 and Brady had 2 L’s. Hard to argue once Brady has 7 rings though. And in the other football, I can’t even begin to count the amount of people that would refuse to put Messi over Pele due to his not having a World Cup win until 2022.</p>

<p>Every sport assigns a massive amount of weight to championships, and even if the NBA discourse is slightly heavier on rings than other sports, NBA players are 20% of the their team on the court compared to less than 10% for either of the others. 1 NBA player can do more to influence his team’s chance of winning than 1 Football or Soccer player.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that.  Marino is the only QB I can recall whose legacy as a GOAT QB was secured without winning a super bowl.  Elway was on his way to the same kind of recognition before he got his rings right at the end.  It&rsquo;s rare for a QB in the NFL to earn GOAT recognition without a ring, but I also think it&rsquo;s true that NFL players who aren&rsquo;t QBs are held to a lower standard because there&rsquo;s only so much of the game they can control.  Same goes for all baseball players.</p>

<p>I think basketball actually has a pretty long list of players without rings who&rsquo;ve earned this kind of recognition including guys like Chuck and Karl Malone.  Harden has earned his place among that group but not above them.  He locked that in with 6 turnovers in the elimination game of the WCF against the warriors.  4 in the fourth quarter. Served it up on a platter.</p>

      <label for="lk85uvz" class="commentText"><p>The stepback / sidestep three made an insane amount of space, and if you somehow stayed with him, he was jumping into you or bringing his arms into your arm, so you hit him during his shot.</p>

<p>You finally lean into the stepback and cover it well without being even slightly out of positon, so he drives past you and his first look is a shooter in the corner with a help defender dropping, then Capela over the top to keep the big honest, then the cradle / euro once he&rsquo;s forced any help to stay home</p>

<p>The cradles / euro layups were unstoppable one on one because he&rsquo;d use his body to seal you off, make space, and finish since he was strong as shit and had an insane touch.  If you try to reach in and interrupt the euro or cradle by tying up the ball, he&rsquo;d hook your arm, make you foul him, and have the touch to make it anyway.</p>

<p>You stay up on him, force him to drive, your team makes good rotations, helps down on him, and he can&rsquo;t just make a pass to an open shot?  Then he throws up an extremely consistent floater that you are not allowed to contest without getting your arm hooked and sending him to the line again.</p>

<p>The dude broke the game.  He was completely unguardable.  His game would still be insanely effective with the new system of offensive fouls (like 30 ppg instead of 36), but god damn was it effective with the old ruleset.</p>

<p>Regardless of what you think about the ethics of his style, he will always be remembered as a player the league had to nerf.  That&rsquo;s a wild legacy to me and the further removed from it I am the more I respect it in a way.</p>

      <label for="lk7nsl7" class="commentText"><p>I consider myself a Harden fan, more than most who are where I am in the northeast.</p>

<p>However in retrospect, I can say now objectively Harden was properly rated during that time. His 34 and 36ppg seasons were incredible from a numbers standpoint and you can&rsquo;t argue his teams were probably the only pure counterpart to GSW and many years were the finals before the finals, even if it was in round 2.</p>

<p>That said, the way he scored was pretty unremarkable to the average fan and his style of between the legs dribble into step back 3, between the legs dribble to into pump fake, foul bait.. rip thru and foul bait, then finally an in the lane floater, was exhausting as well as the 12+ free throws a lot of the time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m of the opinion his 36ppg season should have netted him MVP and the season he actually won it probably was not even the one he should have, but I think a few players are capable of these kinda numbers if they played in high usage iso ball with 10 threes a game and 10 free throws a game. It&rsquo;s just not how you win in the post-season.</p>

<p>I think Luka could do this, I think KD could have done this any season he wanted, Lebron could do it, Kawhi maybe, but ya, Harden is neither underrated or overrated for that stretch, it was cool, but the context makes it less so.</p>
