<p>Listen to how mad Chris Webber was. He’s seen this before. Happy he was calling that game. Butterfly effects are crazy, if foster makes even one of those calls I think the 0-27 never happens.</p>

I know it sounds dramatic, but being an European and having to stay up til early morning just to watch that was crushing, watched pretty much every Rockets game that season. Having it all be for nothing, sacrificing sleep etc. I still remember how I felt, just in disbelief. Refs were pissing me off, but goddamn we couldn’t hit a shot either. It just felt unreal, I had faith that surely we would hit one, but we just didn’t. Saying this, that team is still  one of my favorite sports teams of all time.</p>

      <label for="lkbo7c0" class="commentText"><p>I feel the same brother. The officiating in this game permanently damaged the way I saw the NBA and its not quite the same since. I was so invested in this series as a lifelong Rockets fan, I was kinda numb by the end of this game. I can see one or two bad calls, hey shit happens, but the refs CLEARLY had an agenda this game. We did hit at least one 3, it was just denied by Foster.</p>

<p>During the next season their agenda was pretty much confirmed when you watched the regular season matchup against GSW and the extremely blatant out of bounds call missed on Durant in the closing minutes. I&rsquo;ll never get over this sadly.</p>

      <label for="lkaw6je" class="commentText"><p>Some of these I think were good calls by Scott. For example the 2nd &ldquo; missed call&rdquo;, was blatant that Harden just forced a bad shot to get the 3 and 1 the moment contact was made on him before the shooting motion even began.</p>

<p>I gotta say though the moving screen Bell gave Steph was so fucking funny to me. It&rsquo;s such a circus like foul that I don&rsquo;t know how you can &ldquo; miss&rdquo; that call.</p>

<p>Edit: I just saw the Bell Flop and that was even funnier.</p>

<p>Majority of those teams?</p>

<p>The only teams I can think of he dragged was 2013-2017 Rockets and 2020.</p>

<p>On okc, he was the 3rd best player. 2018 and 19, he had Chris Paul and a good set of role players. However I’ll still say he dragged the 19 and 2020 team since cp got hurt. Since then though, he hasn’t dragged anything.</p>

<p>Nets had kyrie and kd. Sixers were led by embiid. Clippers had kawhi and Paul George.</p>

<p>I love Harden but he’s been on good teams besides the early rockets teams. At least 8 of the 15 seasons, he was on good teams. In 7 of the 15 seasons he’s not even the best player on his team.</p>

<p>Lebron has been the best player on his teams for 19 seasons. I give the slight edge to AD the last 2 years but still it’s close af. It’s silly to bring up Harden carrying and compare it to Bron when Harden isn’t even the best player on his teams in nearly half of his career.</p>

      <label for="lk8cvsk" class="commentText"><p>Well, that Rockets team was worlds better than the 2018 cavs. But I agree, Harden is unfairly maligned for his performance in the playoffs against the warriors. But the rockets were really constructed to beat the warriors so I can&rsquo;t really say it&rsquo;s quite the same. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, the 2018 cavs were constructed to beat no one. The 2017 cavs, fair enough, though can&rsquo;t really say it&rsquo;s Lebron&rsquo;s fault in those finals. I think his +/- for the series was positive if I&rsquo;m not mistaken</p>

<p>edit: Nope, turns out he was indeed a -7, pretty decidedly too. Was only positive in 2 games. Though you look at how Bron performed, and even despite this, it&rsquo;s tough to see that he did anything other than play outstanding basketball and just lose to a way more stacked team.</p>

      <label for="lk8cig6" class="commentText"><p>No, Capela was pretty consensus the 3rd best player. And there were all the stats about the harden-cp3-capela lineup basically never losing. He was the main defensive presence and cp3 + harden have been so amazing at setting up a dunking big man (especially CP3), so he was better for that team. Gordon was great though, I remember the prior year, he literally got a few all star votes almost entirely because of Harden but you know, was still the 2nd best player on that team by his own merit.</p>

<p>Kobe being asked about that Harden run. With TMac right there and agreeing.</p>

<p>They believed that Harden wasn&rsquo;t given enough credit. Kobe said  that style (heliocentric perimeter?) doesn&rsquo;t win championships as it is easier to defend . But that you have to keep the team above water and win games too</p>

<p>And Harden certainly did that. In spades. It was a tremendous run.  I felt Rachel ninichols was trying to get a negative quote out of kobe and he just wouldn&rsquo;t give her one</p>

<p>I can appreciate it at a certain level, but aesthetically I am not as much as fan of watching it</p>

It doesn&rsquo;t take that many brain cells to understand that one is not necessarily more important than the other than it is about having the best mix of both. MVP doesn&rsquo;t always go to the best player on the best team, nor does it always go to the player with the best stats. That&rsquo;s not how the award works. It goes to the most valuable player.</p>

<p>I agree that Harden deserved MVP in 2017 but to say your argument is oversimplifying it would be a massive understatement.</p>

<p>Harden was extremely unlucky in the best 2 years of his career and most likely at least gets 1 ring if it wasn’t for the kd warriors. The 18 rockets were so fucking good</p>

The first fmvp wasn&rsquo;t insane, but still deserved, and he still would have crazy playoff riser stats in his career, and the 2019 was insane even without the championship especially with &ldquo;the shot&rdquo;. The legacy takes a hit, but he&rsquo;d still be seen as a winner, superstar, and big what if with the injuries similar to now.</p>

<p>Giannis without the championship would be going crazy with the narratives. And in a twist of fate, it&rsquo;s also a KD situation that made the difference with the &ldquo;shoe was one-inch shorter&rdquo; what if. Similar with Dirk/Jokic.</p>

Mid to poor defense, but more importantly, the heliocentric offense just isn’t versatile enough to be resistant to playoff defensive scheming and effort.  You’re going to run into a defense that can shut you down, unless maybe you’re Lebron and have multiple other god tier tools.</p>

<p>2018 was the only year he even sniffed a title as the best player.  His game was incredible for farming regular season numbers, but struggled when teams locked down and coaches could gameplan for him over the course of a series.</p>

<p>He seems accurately rated to me.  Right below Wade all time, basically.</p>

<p>Bro, it was all but dismissed even at the time. And it was longer than 2 months, he did it for 40 games as I recall.</p>

<p>Harden that season had the highest ppg of anyone since MJ’s 37 which was the highest since Wilt. And he did it on spectacular efficiency, while also throwing in 7.5 apg for good measure. And on a team that won 53 games and lost in 6 in the 2nd round to the KD Warriors. How often is that mentioned relative to Fat Hitler jokes?</p>

      <label for="lk7pxhv" class="commentText"><p>Eh, huge Jokic fan, but Luka was pulling off some true heroics, especially pre trades. That team was insanely flawed (as we have been since we drafted him), and he kept the thing afloat. Not saying it was a runaway, and not super upset about Jokic taking it, but he really should’ve been MVP.</p>

<p>Now, he’ll probably get his pity/retroactive MVP this year without actually deserving it hah…</p>

<p>He beat luka in every advanced stat, won more games(55-24 vs 46-24, had disgusting on off stats(though this one is partially his backups being trash), and averaged damn near a triple double</p>

      <label for="lk84b8s" class="commentText"><p>It’s partly dismissed and forgotten for the same reason that modern games are often forgettable: the playstyle is homogenous and repetitive, largely due to the dictates of analytics.</p>

<p>Look at Harden’s 2019 shot chart <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hardeja01/shooting/2019" target="_blank">here</a>. Harden basically did three things, bomb threes, get layups (his 20 dunks were 1% of his shot diet), and make free throws. These are the most efficient plays in basketball, which is why Morey pushed it, but it all just bleeds into a blur of doing the same things over and over with unlimited usage.</p>

<p>Compare that to Lebron’s 2013 shot chart <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01/shooting/2013" target="_blank">here</a>. Variability is more memorable.</p>

      <label for="lk85uyv" class="commentText"><p>I’d be okay with this - it’s true too, obviously and demonstrably that Harden and those teams ignored the mid-range after a point - if it wasn’t simultaneously used to denigrate Harden’s efficiency.</p>

<p>He’s the only player I’ve ever seen where somehow TS% is suddenly a bad metric, because TS% as it should takes into account free throws, and Harden apparently gets those free throws illegally. So now we can’t use TS with him. Nonsense.</p>

<p>Aesthetics is one thing. That’s obviously going to be very subjective and personal; I happen to think prime Harden killing absolutely everyone off the dribble was very entertaining to watch just aesthetically, but opinions differ there and have little to do with actual impact. Some people think he was dreadful to watch, that’s fine too.</p>

<p>But when you go to effectiveness and efficiency? Harden that year scored 36 ppg on 61.6% TS, that is absolutely humongous offensive output no amount of crying about free throws can diminish, and that’s before you even get to his assists.</p>

Anytime I try and explain why I think he’s the best player in the league and argue with people about his usage and why he should have the ball in his hands as much as possible, I contradict every argument I ever made against Harden. I do think Luka is a better passer than Harden and I’ll chalk it up to bias since he’s in a Mavs jersey when I say I find him more fun to watch. Harden is cold af tho. Can’t deny it.</p>

<p>Kinda miss those days, even though his three point shooting and elite passing era was objectively superior.</p>

<p>The higher and quicker release but being closer to the basket mean they have to be defended similarly to a mid range j, and with Harden&rsquo;s pull up/step back 3 and his quick first step he was blowing by his man then the help guy has to defend the floater, lay up, and lob</p>

<p>Harden is my pick for the best scorer of all time</p>

      <label for="lk85uvz" class="commentText"><p>The stepback / sidestep three made an insane amount of space, and if you somehow stayed with him, he was jumping into you or bringing his arms into your arm, so you hit him during his shot.</p>

<p>You finally lean into the stepback and cover it well without being even slightly out of positon, so he drives past you and his first look is a shooter in the corner with a help defender dropping, then Capela over the top to keep the big honest, then the cradle / euro once he&rsquo;s forced any help to stay home</p>

<p>The cradles / euro layups were unstoppable one on one because he&rsquo;d use his body to seal you off, make space, and finish since he was strong as shit and had an insane touch.  If you try to reach in and interrupt the euro or cradle by tying up the ball, he&rsquo;d hook your arm, make you foul him, and have the touch to make it anyway.</p>

<p>You stay up on him, force him to drive, your team makes good rotations, helps down on him, and he can&rsquo;t just make a pass to an open shot?  Then he throws up an extremely consistent floater that you are not allowed to contest without getting your arm hooked and sending him to the line again.</p>

<p>The dude broke the game.  He was completely unguardable.  His game would still be insanely effective with the new system of offensive fouls (like 30 ppg instead of 36), but god damn was it effective with the old ruleset.</p>

<p>Regardless of what you think about the ethics of his style, he will always be remembered as a player the league had to nerf.  That&rsquo;s a wild legacy to me and the further removed from it I am the more I respect it in a way.</p>

<p>NBA fans overvalue championships when no other sport scrutinizes that same thing to the same extent when judging greatness - championships in those sports are consistently viewed as “gravy” and how a guy played is what actually counts.</p>

<p>If this same standard was applied to NBA players, Harden would popularly be considered a first ballot guy (as he already is imo)</p>

<p>There’s an argument for Wilt but he struggled at the line and didn’t shoot from 3, also just dominated by being a physical monster in a less physically gifted era. Now harden was the mix of everything. Shooting, footwork, finishing. He was way more efficient and ranged than his SG comps, and he was more focused on scoring than a guy like Lebron. Honestly nobody comes close to harden on offense at his peak.</p>

      <label for="lk7ktzm" class="commentText"><p>Lets be fair here, he was/will be known as someone who benefited from foul baiting/superstar-whistle to where people were afraid to guard him physically, opening up shots that weren’t there come playoffs (he abused tf out of the rip through move to the point they no longer counted it towards a shooting foul), not to mention the abundance of free throws artificially boosted shooting efficiency numbers as a result of those “attempts” not counting and inflated his scoring statistics. Plus they were really fast and loose with what counted as a legal “step back” jumper and not just a travel, where it’s pretty easy to get separation if you can take 4-5 shuffle steps without dribbling</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, he’s still an all-time great scorer in his prime (at least regular season wise) and I don’t necessarily think he didn’t deserve those MVP’s, but the numbers don’t tell the truth, IMO.</p>

It’s time for the classic r/nba reverse circle jerk where people will act like they have zero idea why he got the hate that he did (especially in the playoffs).

      <label for="lk7nsl7" class="commentText"><p>I consider myself a Harden fan, more than most who are where I am in the northeast.</p>

<p>However in retrospect, I can say now objectively Harden was properly rated during that time. His 34 and 36ppg seasons were incredible from a numbers standpoint and you can&rsquo;t argue his teams were probably the only pure counterpart to GSW and many years were the finals before the finals, even if it was in round 2.</p>

<p>That said, the way he scored was pretty unremarkable to the average fan and his style of between the legs dribble into step back 3, between the legs dribble to into pump fake, foul bait.. rip thru and foul bait, then finally an in the lane floater, was exhausting as well as the 12+ free throws a lot of the time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m of the opinion his 36ppg season should have netted him MVP and the season he actually won it probably was not even the one he should have, but I think a few players are capable of these kinda numbers if they played in high usage iso ball with 10 threes a game and 10 free throws a game. It&rsquo;s just not how you win in the post-season.</p>

<p>I think Luka could do this, I think KD could have done this any season he wanted, Lebron could do it, Kawhi maybe, but ya, Harden is neither underrated or overrated for that stretch, it was cool, but the context makes it less so.</p>
