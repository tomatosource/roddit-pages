      <p>I just came across some of his highlights and he was such a bucket. Iâ€™m not an Xâ€™s and Oâ€™s guy, but what made him such a good scorer in 2016-17? Was he just a high usage/high volume guy? Was it the system? Or was he just him?</p>

<p>Should also mention that he was the main scoring threat on that team and he had the ball in his hands a lot</p>

      <label for="lewc3sm" class="commentText"><p>It was a combination of a lot of things.</p>

<p>38% 3 pt shooter on high volume which teams had to respect, he averaged a good volume of FTs on excellent percentages too. Team ran a ton of pick and roll for him and featured the offense around him. His quickness and ability to hit layups at ridiculous angles was unmatched that year. Iâ€™ve never seen a guy go high off glass as much as him finishing around the rim.</p>

<p>Heâ€™s one of the few guys in history I can remember whose efficiency went up significantly while taking on a higher usage. Usually that trend goes the opposite way.</p>

<p>It was a perfect storm of him being one of the quickest players in the nba, incredible touch around the rim, nuclear from 3 that year, a system ran around him, and some good ole shooting luck (he never got close to this overall efficiency again and itâ€™s his highest usage season).</p>

I have no data to back this up, but it seemed to me that the fall-off was at least a little related to the refs swinging wildly from letting him cup the ball all the time, to getting super strict on the call with him specifically.  seemed like he got nerfed, bigtime.  (not to ignore the rather important injury struggle as well).</p>

Finishing around the rim (especially through contact), putting his body and the ball in the right place, and his floater game. Couldn&rsquo;t sag off him because he shot the three well enough. Couldn&rsquo;t really play him tight because he was quick enough to get parallel with his first step and he was brilliant at maneuvering his body between his defender and the rim so that the defender was forced to either try to block him from behind (probably a foul) or let him get his finish attempt up.</p>

      <label for="lewpr5n" class="commentText"><p>Brad Stevens system was bolstered by a shifty guard that can attack the basket and also was a threat from deep. IT and Kyrie thrived in this system. Kyrie on the Celtics was really fun to watch, as much as the Celtics fans currently would tell you otherwise.</p>

      <label for="lewrwq5" class="commentText"><p>Super efficient with his game. No unnecessary dribbling. A couple hang dribbles and attack. But his athleticism is underrated, dude had crazy hang time and is strong as an ox. Dudes would bounce off him. Also just a knock down shooter in his prime.</p>

      <label for="lewsmk4" class="commentText"><p>3 ball was good that year, he mastered the pull up from range.</p>

<p>Had good screeners combined with his first step got him past the first line of defense, then he was fearless when finishing. Contributing to his hip injury, it looked like once he was near the paint he would jump as high as he could and finish however he needed to, not caring about the landing. When he didn&rsquo;t do that his floater game was very nice, going to basket and across the paint moving horizontally if that makes sense.</p>

<p>Then for whatever reason with all that put together he was very clutch. Averaged like 10+ points in the fourth quarter IIRC.</p>
