      <p>I just came across some of his highlights and he was such a bucket. I’m not an X’s and O’s guy, but what made him such a good scorer in 2016-17? Was he just a high usage/high volume guy? Was it the system? Or was he just him?</p>

      <label for="lew5rce" class="commentText"><p>His size, while leading to problems defensively, helped him get through small spaces and his floater game/jump shot was elite. Very shifty with his handle and could get by a lot of defenders. Very clutch too</p>

<p>Should also mention that he was the main scoring threat on that team and he had the ball in his hands a lot</p>

<p>People also mention Iverson when it comes to small greats and mention the Kobe quote “we should all be happy AI isn’t 6’6”. But in my opinion… Nate Robinson is one of the strongest pound for pound players ever. Dude was 5’9 doing incredible things. The way he dunked and made it look so effortlessly in Chicago. He took command of that team. Also during the Knicks/Nuggets fight, he went toe to toe with JR Smith, who is 6’6 (almost a foot taller) and held his own. Dude is insanely strong</p>

<p>IT actually had crazy bounce, he was good at 2 foot jumping, getting off the ground faster, and initiating contact to do super outstretched finishes.</p>

      <label for="lewc3sm" class="commentText"><p>It was a combination of a lot of things.</p>

<p>38% 3 pt shooter on high volume which teams had to respect, he averaged a good volume of FTs on excellent percentages too. Team ran a ton of pick and roll for him and featured the offense around him. His quickness and ability to hit layups at ridiculous angles was unmatched that year. I’ve never seen a guy go high off glass as much as him finishing around the rim.</p>

<p>He’s one of the few guys in history I can remember whose efficiency went up significantly while taking on a higher usage. Usually that trend goes the opposite way.</p>

<p>It was a perfect storm of him being one of the quickest players in the nba, incredible touch around the rim, nuclear from 3 that year, a system ran around him, and some good ole shooting luck (he never got close to this overall efficiency again and it’s his highest usage season).</p>

      <label for="lewm905" class="commentText"><p>I think that it has gotten much worse since IT.  IT&rsquo;s carries offended the sensibilities as a neutral observer back then.  I have no data to back this up, but it seemed to me that the fall-off was at least a little related to the refs swinging wildly from letting him cup the ball all the time, to getting super strict on the call with him specifically.  seemed like he got nerfed, bigtime.  (not to ignore the rather important injury struggle as well).</p>

Was very quick and shifty before his hip injuries, and his size helped him on offense a lot besides being blocked. He was basically the only reliable bucket for the Celtics in that era</p>

Finishing around the rim (especially through contact), putting his body and the ball in the right place, and his floater game. Couldn&rsquo;t sag off him because he shot the three well enough. Couldn&rsquo;t really play him tight because he was quick enough to get parallel with his first step and he was brilliant at maneuvering his body between his defender and the rim so that the defender was forced to either try to block him from behind (probably a foul) or let him get his finish attempt up.</p>

<p>Had good screeners combined with his first step got him past the first line of defense, then he was fearless when finishing. Contributing to his hip injury, it looked like once he was near the paint he would jump as high as he could and finish however he needed to, not caring about the landing. When he didn&rsquo;t do that his floater game was very nice, going to basket and across the paint moving horizontally if that makes sense.</p>

<p>Then for whatever reason with all that put together he was very clutch. Averaged like 10+ points in the fourth quarter IIRC.</p>

      <label for="lewulkq" class="commentText"><p>It wasn&rsquo;t just high PnR. The whole offense was built to get him an advantage, he&rsquo;d run up from the corners into dribble handoffs with the bigs. Either working with a huge screener like Zeller or a shooter the defense had to respect like Olynyk. Just screen after screen until his man was sure to be at least a half step behind.</p>

<p>Defenses couldn&rsquo;t switch because he&rsquo;d torch larger guys off the dribble, and he was efficient at all three levels had every pull up, floater, and fadeaway shot in the lane mastered.</p>

<p>He was the best little guy I ever saw finishing at the rim through contact. He&rsquo;d explode up with two hands on the ball, take the hit, then switch to one hand and finish on the way down.</p>

<p>He also had a devastating Smitty move that he&rsquo;d hit at least 5 times a game to go right by people. It was incredible to watch that season and felt totally unsustainable. And it was, sadly.</p>
