      <p>I just came across some of his highlights and he was such a bucket. I’m not an X’s and O’s guy, but what made him such a good scorer in 2016-17? Was he just a high usage/high volume guy? Was it the system? Or was he just him?</p>

<p>Should also mention that he was the main scoring threat on that team and he had the ball in his hands a lot</p>

<p>People also mention Iverson when it comes to small greats and mention the Kobe quote “we should all be happy AI isn’t 6’6”. But in my opinion… Nate Robinson is one of the strongest pound for pound players ever. Dude was 5’9 doing incredible things. The way he dunked and made it look so effortlessly in Chicago. He took command of that team. Also during the Knicks/Nuggets fight, he went toe to toe with JR Smith, who is 6’6 (almost a foot taller) and held his own. Dude is insanely strong</p>

      <label for="lexbmqd" class="commentText"><p>It’s not “weird” it’s how they measure heights in the NBA. KD probably slumped a tiny bit and took off his shoes for his official height but mostly everybody is getting measured with their socks and shoes fully on. And these are basketball shoes not flip flops with an eighth of an inch of material as the sole.</p>

<p>IT actually had crazy bounce, he was good at 2 foot jumping, getting off the ground faster, and initiating contact to do super outstretched finishes.</p>

<p>Look at 2:18-2:40 in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Znmk4bXNgvU" target="_blank">these highlights</a> especially that second finish between mirotic and lopez. Just ridiculous contortion and ability to hang midair and adjust at the rim.</p>

      <label for="lewc3sm" class="commentText"><p>It was a combination of a lot of things.</p>

<p>38% 3 pt shooter on high volume which teams had to respect, he averaged a good volume of FTs on excellent percentages too. Team ran a ton of pick and roll for him and featured the offense around him. His quickness and ability to hit layups at ridiculous angles was unmatched that year. I’ve never seen a guy go high off glass as much as him finishing around the rim.</p>

<p>He’s one of the few guys in history I can remember whose efficiency went up significantly while taking on a higher usage. Usually that trend goes the opposite way.</p>

<p>It was a perfect storm of him being one of the quickest players in the nba, incredible touch around the rim, nuclear from 3 that year, a system ran around him, and some good ole shooting luck (he never got close to this overall efficiency again and it’s his highest usage season).</p>

I have no data to back this up, but it seemed to me that the fall-off was at least a little related to the refs swinging wildly from letting him cup the ball all the time, to getting super strict on the call with him specifically.  seemed like he got nerfed, bigtime.  (not to ignore the rather important injury struggle as well).</p>

      <label for="lewsmk4" class="commentText"><p>3 ball was good that year, he mastered the pull up from range.</p>

<p>Had good screeners combined with his first step got him past the first line of defense, then he was fearless when finishing. Contributing to his hip injury, it looked like once he was near the paint he would jump as high as he could and finish however he needed to, not caring about the landing. When he didn&rsquo;t do that his floater game was very nice, going to basket and across the paint moving horizontally if that makes sense.</p>

<p>Then for whatever reason with all that put together he was very clutch. Averaged like 10+ points in the fourth quarter IIRC.</p>

      <label for="lewulkq" class="commentText"><p>It wasn&rsquo;t just high PnR. The whole offense was built to get him an advantage, he&rsquo;d run up from the corners into dribble handoffs with the bigs. Either working with a huge screener like Zeller or a shooter the defense had to respect like Olynyk. Just screen after screen until his man was sure to be at least a half step behind.</p>

<p>Defenses couldn&rsquo;t switch because he&rsquo;d torch larger guys off the dribble, and he was efficient at all three levels had every pull up, floater, and fadeaway shot in the lane mastered.</p>

<p>He was the best little guy I ever saw finishing at the rim through contact. He&rsquo;d explode up with two hands on the ball, take the hit, then switch to one hand and finish on the way down.</p>

<p>He also had a devastating Smitty move that he&rsquo;d hit at least 5 times a game to go right by people. It was incredible to watch that season and felt totally unsustainable. And it was, sadly.</p>

Crowder and co ran beautiful pick and rolls creating just enough space for IT to get some pretty nice looks and he was excellent at creating scoring changes for himself with just a little space.</p>

<p>It all revolves around high pick and roll action, getting IT downhill, and it felt to me like if he didn’t get his shot the first time, he was pretty good at getting the defense to lose track of him so he could spot up off the pass.</p>

<p>It’s very similar to what the Knicks do now with Brunson, and was a really excellent coaching job by Stevens, and Ainge did an incredible job putting a team together that could support a winning playstyle without big name guys.</p>

      <label for="lewjckj" class="commentText"><p>He was absolutely elite at a few things. Finishing around the rim (especially through contact), putting his body and the ball in the right place, and his floater game. Couldn&rsquo;t sag off him because he shot the three well enough. Couldn&rsquo;t really play him tight because he was quick enough to get parallel with his first step and he was brilliant at maneuvering his body between his defender and the rim so that the defender was forced to either try to block him from behind (probably a foul) or let him get his finish attempt up.</p>

Combine that with quickness and being a decent enough shooter and you have a very good offensive player. Then injuries hit and that was that.</p>

      <label for="lexajdh" class="commentText"><p>I think his combination of skill, pace and strength made him really lethal in a PnR offense with good spacing. Also, the team didn’t have another guy who consistently could create their own offense; so, the offense ran through Isaiah Thomas, he got most of the end of the shot clock isolation plays, and he got the close game 4th quarter isolation plays.</p>

<p>People like to point to the firing of coach Michael Malone as the big blunder that the Kings did in that era, but that was nothing compared to kicking Isaiah Thomas out the door sometime earlier. He was that good, and it was not a mystery.</p>
