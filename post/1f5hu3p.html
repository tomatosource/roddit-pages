</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Let&rsquo;s say it is for a 30-team single season, and injury-free is guaranteed.</p>

<p>I think Jordan and LeBron go 1 and 2. Undisputed GOAT contenders and impossible to not build a strong team around. Would you consider KAJ for one of the top picks? Or Shaq considering it is just a single season with no injuries?</p>

<p>I feel like after those picks, bigs will be the first to get grabbed. KAJ, Olajuwon, Wilt, Shaq, Russell, Duncan. There will be a demand to secure a top big since the drop-off after the top picks are more drastic compared to other positions.</p>

<p>I think the point guard position is most saturated with greats, but where do you select the best guards like Magic, Curry, Oscar Robertson?</p>

Personally, I don’t accept baking in the difference in eras as I believe, taking one action or decision away from someone makes them an entirely different person. If Michael Jordan decides to eat a sandwich or decides not to eat a sandwich, those are now 2 different Michael Jordan’s. One is real one is a hypothetical.</p>

      <label for="lkt87js" class="commentText"><p>It makes sense to take Lebron since he&rsquo;s a great scorer and a great 5-on-5 player. I&rsquo;d even take him over Prime Shaq. The one &ldquo;knock&rdquo; on Lebron though for what we&rsquo;re considering is that he was slightly less effective when the offense broke down and other players weren&rsquo;t seeing things the way he did. He obviously could hit game winners, but a guy like Kyrie who specialized in one-on-one shotmaking was useful to have in that case. If you take Jordan you have a guy who didn&rsquo;t make the offense work through point-guard-like passing ability, but who made it work by distorting the defense so much with his scoring threat and then passing to open guys after the fact. That&rsquo;s also effective, but I lean towards Jordan because when everything breaks down I don&rsquo;t have to have another one-on-one specialist as a secondary option.</p>

It might be a point for Lebron. I guess it depends on who is available at pick #31 too.</p>

LeBron’s bread and butter is in the paint though which Shaq dominated on another level in his peak. On top of that Shaq had difficulties against greats like Duncan, Hakeem and Ben Wallace. Lebron was foiled by JJ Barrera, Boris Diaw and JR Smith. Don’t forget Shaq knew how to find other guys for wide open shots just like LeBron.</p>

      <label for="lktbsvz" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d take prime Shaq over anyone other than Jordan or Lebron. He was a monster, but during Lebron&rsquo;s second stint of playoff runs with the Cavs, Lebron scored more than Shaq did during the Lakers 3-peat, and on a higher True-Shooting Percentage (30.8 / 58% vs. 29.9 / 56.2%). The gap is even wider when you cut off the year when the rest of the Cavs were injured (31.0 / 61.8%).</p>

<p>Lebron&rsquo;s percentage on 2-point shots during that run is also higher than Shaq&rsquo;s (55.8% vs 55.2%).</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the stat that made me realize Lebron might be the best of all-time.</p>

      <label for="lkthq5o" class="commentText"><p>I don’t worship stats or use them to compare players from different eras. All I know is that both of those guys were physical forces of nature that had the desire for greatness. Obviously Lebron is more versatile which affects most of his statas because of his position. But Shaq’s weaknesses were clear and understandable to himself and the audience whereas when LeBron failed it was confusing to everyone.</p>

<p>Jordan’s legacy is awesome but when you really think about it he was just the right guy in the right place. He was able to rise to the occasion like few have ever done but there’s a solid handful of other guards that were basically clones of him. He also played with a ton of really good players that took on lesser roles to ride his coattails. I also will die on the hill saying that his insane hype machine influenced every moment of his career. NBA2k plays homage to all the great players in different parts of their careers but they won’t don’t really touch Jordan when he was on the wizards. Jordan truly transcended the NBA in ways that can’t be ever be replicated but that’s just PR. Every passing year people forget more and more about Horace grant, luc, parish, Harper and or think pippen was a bitch, or Rodman wasn’t a huge X factor and Phil Jackson didn’t prove he was the best coach in professional basketball. I really would be hesitant to put him over Bird. Jordan won with a bunch proven greats that accomplished real shit before or after him. You can’t say the same things about Bird’s teammates. Even Kobe for that matter because (except for Shaq) all his other guys were fringe NBA players or underachieving stars like Gasol and Odom who won a total of how many playoff series without him? Everyone needs to accept that Jordan was super cool but just like the Super Nintendo there are better or equal or close to equal options</p>

<p>Shaq and Lebron are in my opinion 1 of 1s in today modern era at this point. Shaq just dominated and had an attitude that demanded greatness and respect. Lebron is a combo of Magic and Shaq in my eyes but he didn’t pick a lane and go all in because he wasn’t big enough to power every play or he was inspired to be looked at as a team player. It’s honestly splitting hairs but trust me as soon as Shaq reached his peak it was over. It was so over that people look at the great Kobe Bryant as replaceable piece. Lebron had peak years that ended embarrassingly for one reason or another. Lebron only repeated ONCE and it was with a fricken prime super team that he hopped on. His saving grace was how he came back in 2016, completely sonned the warriors in 2018 during game 1 and his incomparable longevity.</p>

<p>But my finals ranks are:
Shaq
Lebron
Kareem
Bird</p>

      <label for="lktjvfu" class="commentText"><p>The stat comparison between Lebron and Shaq just says that Lebron scored more points than Shaq did and his shots even went in more often then Shaq&rsquo;s shots, which is incredible since Shaq would dunk the ball or use power moves to get easy finishes pretty much every time.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no comparison at all between Jordan and the other guards who emulated him. You have to look at the actual stats and achievements there. Jordan led the NBA in impact stats 61 times. Kobe never did even once. Kobe just looked like him on the very surface level. Jordan also led the entire NBA in minutes 3 years in a row, was defensive player of the year, he was an off-the-charts freak in multiple ways. There&rsquo;s no comparison between him and the other guys.</p>

<p>I also think Lebron is an off-the-charts freak, but you seem very biased in what you&rsquo;re saying. It&rsquo;s also irksome that you wrote all that then gave a ranking that was just three Lakers players at the top. We have to do better than that, man.</p>

<p>You’re going to have a much easier time fitting McGrady next to other star players than Giannis. Peak McGrady is pretty ridiculous, I might even take him higher. His shooting was really streaky though. </p>

<p>I think west is too high but the argument must be positional versatility and shooting. </p>

<p>Just to be clear I love KG and was always a fan of his while playing, his MVP season especially warmed my heart like a mf. But there’s no fucking way he deserves to go 3rd OA behind MJ and Lebron in an all-time draft no matter what the metric. One season, or a hundred seasons.</p>

<p>And he wasn’t even <em>in</em> his prime anymore by the time he went to Boston. He spent his entire prime on the worst rosters put around a star player ever.

KG spaces better, is better defensively, is a better passer, and can play more positions. You’re not picking the “best” player, you’re picking the guy who allows you to set up the rest of the roster better. Also, center is loaded historically. </p>

      <label for="lkt1ao3" class="commentText"><p>This is not a career accolades list or an all-time ranking. It’s an average draft position for single-season peaks. Player impact is only one of many factors taken into consideration. For instance, Russell Westbrook is a more impactful basketball player than Kyle Lowry. However, Westbrook does not fit as ideally alongside other superstars. Lowry is generally drafted higher for his ability to mesh with other superstars while maintaining his value and raising the offensive ceiling. As such, he’s also a lot easier to build around. Hope this helps.</p>

<p>The player who strikes me as overrated is Reggie Miller. When you say &ldquo;single-season peaks&rdquo;, is that just based on stats or do you account for other things like making people better, intangibles? He did have a freakishly high FG% in 89-90 and 90-91, so that must be a big part of it.</p>

<p>No one can shoot and move like Reggie (except Curry, who is top 5 in this), and he takes nothing off the board for dozens of ball dominant players who are better than him, so you have the option of taking whoever you want next to Reggie and he&rsquo;ll still thrive in future rounds.   I bet anyone who finds a certain player really out of place in this list will realise how flexible they are next to great scorers.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, we weigh playoff performance quite a bit heavier than regular season performance. Reggie’s numbers are relatively unimpressive in the RS, but he becomes a monster in the postseason, with both his volume and efficiency ballooning. Like was mentioned with KG and Lowry, Reggie also has the portability bonus going for him. It’s really easy to work him into a lineup and he serves as a great second option for your superstar.</p>

<p>If we’re drafting one year rentals of players in their prime, his prime would be top 10 at a minimum. Probably higher.</p>

      <label for="lktpnvf" class="commentText"><p>I dunno. In an all time draft Jokic will be going up against players like Shaq, Wilt, Kareem and Hakeem. Jokic haven&rsquo;t matched up against centers of those caliber in his era. They would absolutely punish and expose Jokic&rsquo;s defensive deficiencies which imo would put him lower in an all time draft.</p>

Honestly I don&rsquo;t think it makes too much difference whether you take MJ, Lebron, Shaq, etc. The most important thing is building a strong overall team.</p>

<p>If this scenario is like a fantasy draft where you build an entire roster from scratch, I think the mid-round picks would be the most interesting. Like if you took Magic #1, then you want your other players to be shooters &amp; finishers. If your #1 was Shaq, then you might go for different players in the mid rounds who could play a more grinding type of game (but you still want shooters no matter what).</p>

I’m as big of a LeBron fan as there is and I loved watching Jordan when I was young, but I’m not sure how you pass on prime Shaq. How exactly are you neutralizing him as one of the other 29 teams? There’s at least a half dozen players who have had a better overall career but Shaq in his prime is the most dominant thing I’ve seen. The entire western conference was trying to load up on big bodies just to foul him.</p>

<p>Realistically, a player like Curry should go #1 because he&rsquo;s a harder archetype to find than a ball dominant scorer like MJ/Kobe/Durant or a flexible playmaker you can run your offense through like Lebron/Magic/Bird</p>

<p>First of all, Idk what planet you live on but here on earth there is no way that peak Kawhi is going in the third round lol. He is a first round pick and probably somewhere around the 17th to 27th pick. This hypothetical is asking for you to build a team of players at their peak. Where in your head did you think there would be over 60 players better than Raptors Kawhi (or pick your flavor of Spurs or Clippers because he was great in every jersey)?</p>

<p>I think Kawhis peak would have him as the 4th small forward off the board after LeBron, Durant and Bird. And that&rsquo;s if you plan on playing them at those positions. In a modern style I would play both Bird and Durant at the power forward.</p>

<p>There was literally a post like 2 weeks ago where everyone was saying Kawhi peaked higher than Wade (I think it&rsquo;s a good argument and would prefer peak Kawhi if I&rsquo;m building in this draft idea). He&rsquo;s a first rounder.</p>

<p>Second&hellip;.</p>

<p>I like your trade answer but in a hypothetical B.O.A.T league (I use best instead of greatest since some of the all time greats won&rsquo;t be picked due to the changes in the game, sorry Cousy) I don&rsquo;t think you can trade picks in a snake draft as it would get real messy quickly.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also confused why people are including KAJ. Obviously a great player, but his argument in the top 5 discussion is based mostly on longevity.</p>

<p>So while I wouldn&rsquo;t have Shaq first or Steph top 5, at least you considered the actual question and were thoughtful about your rankings.</p>

<p>MJ LeBron are 1 and 2</p>

<p>All-time great bigs/pf: Hakeem, Shaq, Kareem, Duncan, KG, DRobinson</p>

<p>Insert Kobe and KD in between somewhere</p>

<p>Curry gets drafted first before Magic</p>

<p>Giannis, Kawhi, Jokic, CP3 are super high commodities</p>

<p>Klay Thompson also gets drafted earlier than usual because he is the perfect complimentary shooting guard</p>

<p>Dirk is a sought out 2nd option especially with a Non spacing big that can cover his defensive weakness or LeBrom&rsquo;s second option</p>

<p>Then we got some really good current players that are really good picks: Luka, SGA, Wemby, Paul George</p>

<p>When the team lacks stout bigs: draft Yao Ming, Nate Thurmond, Artis Gilmore, Alonzo Mourning, Dennis Rodman</p>

<p>When the team needs a shooting guard: Reggie Miller, Ray Allen</p>

<p>When teams need a playmaker: Kidd, Nash, Jrue, Harden</p>

<p>Role players that get drafted over all time greats because of fit and spacing: Derrick White, Chet Holmgren, Chris Webber, Cooper Flagg</p>

<p>Tertiary scorers: Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Horace Grant</p>

<p>High risk of getting roasted for drafting them: Willis Reed, Elgin Baylor, Walt Frazier, Oscar Robertson, Bill Russell Wilt Chamberlain</p>

<p>Auto-lose picks: Russell Westbrook</p>

<p>If I fall in the first 15 picks I look to trade into the 16-30 range and if I start with pick 16-30 I look to move my third pick and more to get into the top half of round 2.</p>

<p>While the top players are amazing I believe there&rsquo;s more value in having 2 players from the 15 to 50 range than one player from the 1 to 15 range.</p>

      <label for="lktfyfm" class="commentText"><p>This is my favorite exercise to do in my free time and I do it all the damn time whenever I&rsquo;m driving or sitting somewhere with nothing else to occupy my time (Yes, my social life is quite sad and I am aware of how lame this is). </p>

<p>This has been played out many times on different threads and discussions forums that I will link at the bottom if you want to see how people drafted in the past.</p>

<p>In my made up scenario, all of the players are reverted to whatever season was their absolute peak and even though they keep their memories, they have the muscle memory and play style/skills as if they played at their peak yesterday. An example is if you pick “Jason Kidd 03” you are getting that version as a player so he won&rsquo;t be shooting threes as competent as he did when he gracefully aged in Dallas. </p>

<p>Then, all of the players who aren&rsquo;t currently in the NBA are sent to a private island where for 5 months they train with the best trainers (Drew Hanlan, Tim Grover etc.) and shooting coaches to help them adjust to the new rules and game style (being allowed to basically carry the ball while dribbling, step backs increasing their range and shooting a million threes, big men practicing PnR and perimeter defense, lobs, etc.). Also, practicing with coaches like Bud and Pop so they learn drop coverage and modern zone like defenses. Then coaches like Carlisle to learn modern offensive sets and pace and space tactics. They have games against G league teams then watch film and do it again and again until they have the modern style down. Then the last 1.5 months the current NBA players show up and they train with them both individually and scrimmages until the boot camp ends. For some older players, getting their feet into some modern shoes will make a massive difference on its own. Imagine going from &ldquo;Chuck Taylors&rdquo; or even &ldquo;The Weapons&rdquo; to some Hyperdunks or Zoom Soldiers. </p>

<p>After that, the draft occurs but it should be noted that it&rsquo;s a snake draft and the rules of this league are basically how international basketball is now but with NBA ball and court. Or maybe I&rsquo;d just use NBA refs from 2005-2014 when IMO they did the best job at allowing for more space and offense but also not going overboard on the advantages and letting them be just physical enough.</p>

<p>Here are the examples. Click on the “drafts w/teams tabs” on a few of them. I should note that these are from somewhere around 2016 to 2020 so a lot has changed (also, number 2 is terrible). </p>

      <label for="lkth0y8" class="commentText"><p>To me you have to take either MJ with the first pick, the gap between them and the next at their position (Kobe for Jordan, Curry for Magic) seems higher than the gap between LeBron and Bird or the interior players (Duncan is far from every other 4 but we know he played like a &ldquo;traditional big&rdquo;, looking more like Hakeem and Russell than any power forward playing right now).</p>

<p>Then, it depends on your rules, how many you are to play the games or if you&rsquo;re doing it as teams and have 1 pick alternating 1-60. Then, you go with MJ or LeBron or Kareem/Wilt. In that case, your question is a bit like &ldquo;rank the greatest players ever&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It also depends on whether you select players &ldquo;in a vacuum&rdquo; or &ldquo;in relation with their era&rdquo;. In the first case, quite a few players would drop, when active players who have benefited from improvements in many domains and easier rules would climb.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think so, it&rsquo;s the centers for me. I have Kareem, Wilt, Russell, Shaq, Hakeem, Moses, Jokic all in my top 20 players ever. Only Magic, Curry and Robertson are up there for point guards and Jordan, Kobe, West for shooting guards. Historically, the NBA is a big men&rsquo;s league!</p>

      <label for="lktnnc9" class="commentText"><p>You rarely hear people discuss how the changing basketball meta over the recent years would impact this kind of a draft.</p>

<p>The way the game is played has fundamentally changed. This isn&rsquo;t the same game it used to be. With the rise of analytics and the increased emphasis on 3-point shooting you can clearly see how scoring has shot up.</p>

<p>The way games are officiated nowadays and different rule sets have also drastically nerfed what defenders can get away with and made scorers even more valuable.</p>

<p>An NBA game averaged 97.2 PPG in 2004-2005 with 15.8 3PA per game.</p>

<p>In 2023-24 average PPG was up to 114.2 with a staggering 35.1 3PA per game.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I think most people in this thread would be very surprised how modern GMs would set up their draft boards for this exercise and select their picks.</p>

      <label for="lktkj3h" class="commentText"><p>Wow,</p>

<p>This tells me something about your understanding of the game if you think KG or Steph would have the same impact that MJ would have.</p>

<p>I understand the LeBron pick because he&rsquo;s in that MJ tier but those two are both athletically AND talent wise drastically above anyone else who ever played the game.</p>

<p>Recency bias is a real thing and I will admit that I fall for it all the time as well. Due to the style change of the Association, we don&rsquo;t have any experience with MJ playing a modern style of basketball so imagination is needed which might be what&rsquo;s holding you back, right?</p>

<p>If you take the time to watch Jordan play basketball from 88-93, like really watch him, preferably a few playoff games, not just highlights. You&rsquo;d get a glimpse into how incredibly athletic he was and would still be in his own tier if he played today. His hang time actually made me look up if people were capable of staying in the air longer than others besides just jumping higher than everyone (they can&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s all in the vert lol).</p>

<p>On top of the first step and floating, MJ had a work ethic that maybe only a handful could match or beat (Logo and Kobe are the only that come to mind right now). Steve Kerr once said that they (the Bulls) played harder in their practice scrimmages than on game day. This was during a time where you didn&rsquo;t utilize &ldquo;load management&rdquo; while playing an 82 game season.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not someone who believes that &ldquo;The 90s were better basketball and today&rsquo;s NBA is soft&rdquo;. I think that&rsquo;s a terrible take and again, comes from someone who doesn&rsquo;t understand the game. Today&rsquo;s league IS however, catered towards the offense and doesn&rsquo;t require the same amount of &ldquo;toughness&rdquo; because the paint isn&rsquo;t packed with 2 guys who are 6&rsquo;10&rdquo; to 7&rsquo;4&rdquo; that want to hit you. The shooting of the role players took this strategy away by making it so those tall dudes have to get out to the 3 point line and contest shots (that&rsquo;s of course if they&rsquo;re lucky enough to be on the court).</p>

<p>Because of this, a player that can jump higher than everyone else, has a first step faster than everyone else, has better footwork than anyone else AND has the best touch and mid range jumper (also fade away) is going to be outrageously effective with the amount of space they theoretically would have as long as their teammates are shooters.</p>

<p>I am starting to laugh at all of the former players who think they would average 30-50 points a game in today&rsquo;s era and would dominate. Most of them are giving themselves too much credit and the modern players not enough credit but MJ is not one of those guys. He&rsquo;s a guy who was already averaging over 30 at over 50% while amongst the trees and with hand checking allowed.</p>

<p>Anyone who would have the daunting task of guarding MJ in a modern league would just hope that he wouldn&rsquo;t put his mind towards shooting threes like he did in that finals game against the Blazers. If that were to happen, it would be a wrap.</p>

<p>People can manipulate the results to make either of the two look statistically &ldquo;better&rdquo; by just adjusting the parameters or changing which metric they use.</p>

<p>At this point, anyone who is a serious NBA fan and is speaking with their mind not their heart, should be able to admit that regardless of who you choose, it&rsquo;s a valid argument.</p>

<p>They are both so incredible and dominant at their peaks that they are in their own tier at the top and the only wrong answer would be choosing anyone else.</p>

<p>IMO, MJ is a bit more refined and I trust him more in big moments BUT LBJ&rsquo;s size is a real advantage and his versatility on defense is extremely valuable.</p>

<p>I probably choose MJ if I have the first pick but if I have the second pick and I end up with LeBron I don&rsquo;t think I am at a disadvantage whatsoever.</p>

<p>Preference is the only difference.</p>

      <label for="lkswpqx" class="commentText"><p>I think LeBron is the clear number one pick, but I think it gets real dicey real quick after that.  In this hypothetical, imagining current GMs drafting all time players for TODAY’S game would be very weird.  MJ is the best player of his generation, yet he probably would’ve been even better in the 2000’s, when the style of play would be even better suited to him.  Although that’s literally because of him, but whatever.  If you are drafting an all time team, I think there’s a really good argument for guys like Jokic or Curry to be taken before MJ.  Both because they are guaranteed to work well in the current era, and because even if you have no idea what the rest of your team will look like, you know they will make the players around them better in uniquely great ways.  I think something like LeBron, MJ, Curry, Jokic, Shaq in some order would make the most sense.  Two goats, two easy can’t fail picks, and peak Shaq lmao</p>

<p>and yes I understand how this is hella recency bias but oh well 🤷‍♂️</p>

<p>And over his career even though he put no emphasis on it, he shot 32.7 from 3 to lebrons 34.3 (who put in tons of work on it). Give Jordan an off-season and he’d come back a three point shooter.</p>

Those 3 seasons he averaged 40.4% on 3.3 attempts per game. You exclude those years and guess what you get?</p>

<p>28.8% on 1.4 attempts.</p>

<p>It’s Shaq number 1 period. I’m sure there are enough solid guards to catch in the second round that can balance out his weakness at the free throw line.</p>

Literally anyone could be the all-time scoring leader in both PPG and playoff PPG by a wide margin. Even your boy Shaq, who never averaged 30 PPG despite playing in the 90s with Jordan, could easily average 45.  </p>

      <label for="lktpp23" class="commentText"><p>Whenever some dude makes a reference about putting the male genitalia in ones mouth, it&rsquo;s clear that they are projecting because why else would your head go to that image? Do whatever you want to your MJ (Shaq?) trading cards on your own time but please don&rsquo;t bring us into it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what you meant by players at their peak succeeding if they took MJs place in the timeline. Are you trying to insinuate that there are &ldquo;many&rdquo; players who would have two threepeats and would have been the undisputed best player in the league for 10 years? Because if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re saying then you probably should change up your medication dosage. You&rsquo;re sounding a bit delusional.</p>

<p>I will admit that Shaq is a valid argument for top pick. I would go with Shaq in 99-00 which I think was his best season and it&rsquo;s before he started to really accumulate mass so he&rsquo;s more nimble and better suited for today&rsquo;s style (Maybe not as much as Orlando Shaq but he&rsquo;s a lot better so it&rsquo;s worth the trade off).
I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s the best option for the number one choice though because of a couple things. One, the free throw thing you mentioned is real and having guards that are good free throw shooters doesn&rsquo;t help that situation so I&rsquo;m not sure what you were trying to say with that one. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind the poor FT shooting UNTIL the end of the 4th when you would have to bench him against a team using the Hack a Shaq strategy, especially if that team has great 3pt shooters because it would be a quick way to blow a lead.</p>

<p>If having to bench the number one pick of the best basketball players of all time at the end of games isn&rsquo;t enough to deter you from choosing Shaq then I would also be worried about his PnR/perimeter defense. Shaq is not built to be able to defend quick players in space. He would get blown past anytime you get him in the high PnR action. As long as you have a center who can shoot threes, it would be difficult to field an effective defense with Shaq out of the paint attempting to guard faster/quicker wings. Depending on the rules of the league you could probably find ways to hide him but combined with the free throws/benching concerns, that&rsquo;s enough for me to move him to the 6-10 range on my draft big board.</p>

<p>So in conclusion,
Stop projecting your penis envy thoughts onto everyone else AND Shaq&rsquo;s major flaws are enough to at least have Jordan and LeBron comfortably ahead of him on draft big boards but if you end up with him as your first selection, you&rsquo;re in pretty good shape.</p>
