</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>The 2009-2010 Charlotte Bobcats are a very interesting team. It&rsquo;s not likely you remember that team, so let me refresh your memory. Their main players were Gerald Wallace, Boris Diaw, Stephen Jackson, and Raymond Felton. Tyson Chandler was also on that team, but he was injured for a big part of the year.</p>

<p><strong>About that team</strong></p>

<p>Now, Gerald &ldquo;Crash&rdquo; Wallace was an absolutely sensational defender at his prime. He was a master at getting blocks and he was a great rim defender. He also drew a lot of free throws and went to the rim a lot. Wallace was also the most efficient player on the team besides Tyson Chandler, with a +4.3 rTS%. Stephen Jackson was the main scorer on the team with an inflation adjusted total of 22 points per 75, but on a dreadful -2.3 rTS%. Boris Diaw and Raymond Felton were also good players on the team, especially Felton who had the most assists per 75 possessions with 7.5. With DJ Augustin, Ronald Murray, and Nazr Mohammed coming off the bench, the Hornets had a competent team. Those Hornets finished with the BEST defensive rating that year with a relative defensive rating of -4.8 in the 95th percentile all time. But they also had the 24th best offense with a -3.2 which is in the 15th percentile all time. Larry Brown is truly something else. What a coach!</p>

<p><strong>What changed from the previous year.</strong></p>

<p>The previous year, they had the 7th best defense, so it wasn&rsquo;t completely out of the blue, but given their only real star was Wallace, it was probably a surprise to many. They didn&rsquo;t even make very many changes in the offseason, the only change of note was trading Emeka Okafar for Tyson Chandler. That trade was heavily criticized at the time, for good reason. Okafar was one of their key players on offense, and their offense was already bad enough, so the trade seemed stupid. They made a midseason trade getting Stephen Jackson for Raja Bell.</p>

<p><strong>What happened after/how things collapsed.</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, that team collapsed the next year after letting their starting point guard Raymond Felton go and replacing him with Shaun Livingston. They gave away Tyson Chandler for free to save money. The Hornets went 34-48 a year after having the best defense in the league and they decided to rebuild and that was that. And just another year after that, they infamously went 7-59. What a tragic story indeed.</p>

      <label for="l9xoj7g" class="commentText"><p>that team was absolutely capped out but should&rsquo;ve been quite a bit better. wish they&rsquo;d kept everything together 1 more year, and then traded Gerald Wallace for the Lillard pick like Portland did</p>

<p>Tyson Chandler was dumped for negative value and then won the title with Dallas the next year</p>

      <label for="l9xmv5g" class="commentText"><p>This is the deep dive I didn’t know I needed. Great job.</p>

<p>In hindsight I wonder if the team benefited from three point variance. They were mid pack in opponent 3p% (14th best), then suddenly 2nd best that one good year, then back down to earth and 16th the year after.</p>

      <label for="l9xosqq" class="commentText"><p>it&rsquo;s actually hilarious how many quality role players the Bobcats were hoarding during that era that would eventually go on to play pivotal roles on contenders.</p>

<p>outside of Gerald Wallace of course, who would live on in infamy as the player the Nets traded the draft rights to Dame Lillard for.</p>

      <label for="l9xow2p" class="commentText"><p>Chandler wasn&rsquo;t even a big reason for the Bobcats having a good year defensively. He missed 30 games, only started 27 of the 51 he played in. Bobcats were only 11-16 when he started (33-22 in the other games).</p>

<p>Charlotte had a three man rotation at center with Theo Ratliff and Nazr Mohammed taking the center spot the rest of the season between Chandler getting benched and hurt.</p>

      <label for="l9ymadg" class="commentText"><p>A few extra details</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Raymond Felton wasn&rsquo;t replaced by Shaun Livingston.  They had drafted DJ Augustin two years prior and were letting him take over the PG position, but he proved to be a bit worse.</p></li>

<li><p>I believe Tyson Chandler didn&rsquo;t want to be in Charlotte.  I remember being shocked by the trade, because they basically got nothing in return and the Bobcats were looking to build on their first playoff appearance.  If it really was a salary saving move, they had already fucked up by trading for Desangana Diop&rsquo;s albotross of a contract the prior season.</p></li>

<li><p>Larry Brown and the entire coaching staff got fired after starting the next season 9-19.  I can only imagine it partially had to do with the gaping hole at the center position they filled with Kwame Brown and Diop, but the team was obviously worse going into the year.  They had bascially scrapped the entire team for parts by the end of the year.</p></li>

      <label for="l9xq3y0" class="commentText"><p>Dwight destroyed our bigs, wasn&rsquo;t even his offense. His defense and rebounding completely changed the series, and we diverted so many resources to shutting him down that we let every other Magic player cook. We were actually undefeated in the regular season vs LeBron&rsquo;s Cavs, we should&rsquo;ve tanked that matchup imo</p>

      <label for="l9xrimk" class="commentText"><p>those teams had basically nothing in common.</p>

<p>But Stephen Jackson was a severely underrated player because of his reputation. He was a chucker offensively, but could do everything else really well. That said, he had one game that year where he 100% played drunk. He had a pretty loaded statline but shot 1-16</p>

<p>If anyone has highlights of a CHA/LAC game on 2/22/10, I want to see that again</p>
