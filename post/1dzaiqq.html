      <label for="lcea9bk" class="commentText"><p>Well, Bridges took a plea deal and was suspended for basically an entire year (in line with what the court handed down, 3 years probation, tons of counseling) - and then the next set of charges were dropped due to insufficient evidence.</p>

<p>So to punish him further, the league basically would have to take a unilateral stance on domestic violence that actually exceeds the court of law, following this logic.</p>

<p>If the implication is Bridges (or Mazzulla, or Kidd, or whoever) should really be gone for good, the league would essentially be saying that no one who’s ever been accused of domestic abuse can ever play in the league, even if they haven’t actually been convicted of a crime yet. And while I think setting that as a precedent could be useful, I’m not sure a sports league would ever do that.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying I think it&rsquo;s a hostile thing, I think it&rsquo;s cooperative.</p>

<p>I think if a big enough star was found to be a wifebeater he&rsquo;d get away with it for as long as the league and union could keep it under wraps.

If you saw the images what he did and heard what their child said and decided this man being applauded and lauded and put in front of kids to admire is an acceptable thing to happen so soon after the instances that&rsquo;s a choice you are making.</p>

<p>Secondly, the league absolutely does not have to meet the legal standards for prosecuting domestic violence. They are not putting anyone in jail. There are a million measures they could put in place to prevent domestic abusers being put on platforms to be celebrated and admired and idolised.</p>

<p>Also, cool thing missing where he - very recently - approached her in her car and threw shit at her with their child inside. As if that weren&rsquo;t enough, with the recording of their child talking about seeing Bridges strangle his mother. You can&rsquo;t play &lsquo;But what can they do!?&rsquo; while a player batters and threatens their partner or former partner <em>while they are actively playing in the league</em> - you are choosing to imagine circumstances where you are forced to be okay with it because you are trying to be okay with it.</p>

<li>I have not defended him, in fact I’ve actively spoken out about how much I dislike him on the team. You’ve really just spoken around my entire post without reading it. This isn’t about the Hornets or Bridges, it’s about defining how things ought to be. I’m trying to get at something bigger here.</li>
</ol>

<p><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>. No trust me I am well aware of everything that has happened with Bridges. The recent incident with the car is what I was referring to when I said the charges were dropped. The prosecutor said that there was insufficient evidence. You can read the details here: <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nba/hornets-miles-bridges-charges-dropped-domestic-violence-case/3776027/?amp=1" target="_blank">https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nba/hornets-miles-bridges-charges-dropped-domestic-violence-case/3776027/?amp=1</a></p>

<p>So in essence here is what you are proposing: the NBA as an employer must punish its players for DV (even alleged DV) beyond what a court of law would impose, and must punish players for even allegations of domestic violence.</p>

<p>Which is fine, and in many ways something I agree with. But this also puts the onus of investigation and litigation also on the NBA, almost like running a shadow PI firm to dole out punishments. And that is not a role any corporation is likely to take.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s no &lsquo;alleged&rsquo; here, he plead no contest. And yes, the NBA should implement a something where sexual and domestic assault cases that are proven to a reasonable extent (still to a lesser criteria than the law requires, because no-one is going to jail) carry with them a period where the player cannot be part of an NBA organisation. That would seem a pretty significant step forward and would very importantly prevent domestic abusers being put in a position to be admired and idolised and followed by children. <em>You</em> are very welcome to play dumb and act like unless someone goes to jail for ten years there is nothing the NBA can do and that is because you are playing dumb about this.</p>

<p>Kids watch this game, kids watch these games and go to to these games and fall in love with players and learn about them from a perspective where the player is the good guy. Having someone like Miles Bridges in the position he is is tangibly fucking dangerous and the NBA and the Hornets have made a significant moral failure for entertaining that. Women watch this game and learn what violence against them means when it comes from people in power. This shit is so obviously reprehensible. Stop trying to defend it.</p>

<p>The NBA has made a calculated decision that doing this would open them up to more liability and headache than the relative moral/PR victory would provide. Essentially, it comes down to having good players on the court is more important to their business than having good people on the court, but it also comes down to, being a moral arbiter on domestic violence is not a position they are willing to stick their neck out to do.</p>

<p>Okay, cool, congratulations - you have gotten to the <strong>first</strong> step where you have realised that capitalism and profit seeking organisations are not especially bothered with ethics. I am glad you got there too. The problem is instead of taking the next step; that means people need to push and argue for change, you have decided to sit on the first one. The reality of the situation is that there is absolutely no political, or practical, reason that the NBA can not have a stricter policy against domestic and sexual violence.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not lashing out at you, I am telling you that the above is the case and trying to offer cover for the most ruthless and immoral end of that apathy is functionally endorsing it. If you don&rsquo;t like that, then maybe you should consider your role here and the message you are sending.</p>

<p>But you’re incorrect about the implications of what a no contest plea means. A no contest plea or nolo contendre the defendant does not assert innocence or guilt in a formal manner</p>

<p>You may be confusing it with a Alford plea in which a defendant formally admits guilt and it’s an important distinction to make because of the differences in legal ramifications as an Alford plea can be used in civil litigation after the fact and a no contest plea cannot. In the court of public opinion the distinction may not matter but in the legal sense it does</p>

<p>Again not defending miles just clarifying the meaning of what a no contest plea means and its implications in the legal system</p>

<p>I get what you&rsquo;re saying, but that is my issue with people picking at the legal charges and responses. There isn&rsquo;t an &lsquo;alleged&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s extremely clear what happened to absolutely everyone involved, that a no contest plea doesn&rsquo;t formally assert guilt doesn&rsquo;t especially matter here.</p>

      <label for="lcepghr" class="commentText"><p>Man I get where you’re coming from but the nba is a business and it’s practices are governed by them, and especially with its practices being countered by a players union it would be incredibly difficult for them to enact punishment beyond that of the legal to an extreme like barring him from playing would be challenged in court and idk if they could win that battle. As opposed to a straight up guilty plea would likely be much easier to establish guilt etc</p>

<p>This is the most Reddit take ever. Some things can be automated like ball hitting out of bounds but to automate the entire reffing? Bruh it blows my mind people genuinely believe this is a thing that can currently happen</p>

      <label for="lcecns1" class="commentText"><p>How would you make that work ? Basketball works fast so you want a bell to ring automatically whenever a no call occurs ? Is it going to be implemented mid play or at a stoppage. If it’s at a stoppage what if there was multiple no calls before the stoppage. There’s no way to organize that while keeping the essence of the hand</p>

<p>Certain things can be automated for sure (out of bounds, 3pt vs 2pt, probably goaltending), but I’d imagine things like traveling, block/charge, reach ins, etc. would be super difficult to actually automate.</p>

<p>If they cared about the integrity of the sport, they&rsquo;d implement a VAR style system for referees that reviews most calls in live time. If they are unable to review the call within 10-15 seconds, the call on the floor stands. This would literally eliminate 95% of bogus calls and shit decisions.</p>
