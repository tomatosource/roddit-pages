Dwight was not doing anything like that, the 09 and 10 Magic were an all around force. They were a dominant 3pt shooting team and a dominant defensive team.</p>

<p>He carried the defense, while being the interior suction that created their amazing 3pt shooting. But as soon as one of those key players went down, the whole team kind of crumbled sadly. It was Jameer in 09 and Rashard in 2010.</p>

<p>Rashard outscored Dwight in their amazing series v the Celtics just for example, they were much more than role players. They were an all around force, 3pt shooting out the ass, STANK defense on the interior. Great guard play, excellent wings and a dominant defensive big who could put up 15-20 with ease.</p>

<p>KG led the 08 Celtics in scoring. Did he carry the 08 Celtics?</p>

<p>But like KG, he lead his team in scoring, by all of 1 ppg my dude. Saying Dwight carried the team on offense and defense, like he was averaging 35 ppg and 7 assists + playing DPOY defense is silly.</p>

<p>Dwight was awesome in 09. But the 09 and 10 magic were an all around force as a team. Incredible interior defense, incredible wing play, nightmare spacing. First finals team since the bulls to use the stretch big to devastating effect.</p>

<p>Hedo and Rashard were a 3 and 4. Did you watch this team? They often swapped between the two at the 4 spot, depending on the matchup.</p>

<p>This team vastly overplayed their talent level, it&rsquo;s what made their style of play so awesome. That&rsquo;s why I call them an all round force. Every part of their team was awesome, but like other teams like this, when one part gets injured, the whole team crumbles. This team played like the 15 Hawks with a dominant defensive big in the middle if you needed a comparison. It was awesome.</p>

<p>Regardless, using Dwight carried the 09 Magic, like they weren&rsquo;t a high octane machine that fired on all cylinders is silly. He wasn&rsquo;t even the leading scorer for the Magic in multiple series, including the Finals. The team Dwight carried was the 11 Magic, the year he probably should&rsquo;ve won MVP.</p>

<p>But he definitely was a beast at his peak. I used to frequent the sporting events subforum on the twoplustwo forums and there were tons of really knowledgeable basketball fans back around 2009-2013. They&rsquo;d do mock dynasty drafts and for a 12-18 month period, Dwight would often get picked first before Lebron.</p>

      <label for="lt4frv9" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not saying I agree with the Dwight hate. But Dwightmare was a real thing, a lot of people have axes to grind with him. He&rsquo;s a no-brainer top 75, much better career than Lillard - people holding onto grudges or bad media perception is the idiocy that kept him off</p>

<p>EDIT: I can&rsquo;t respond because the dude blocked me for some reason. But the decision to make it next 25, was from the media, even if the panel had coaches and players. They openly said they didn&rsquo;t want to remove anyone who was selected for top 50 /u/vmpafq</p>

<p>2nd EDIT: /u/everyoneneedsaherro <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/steve-aschburner-explains-vote-for-nba-75" target="_blank">Here&rsquo;s one of the voters straight up saying he refused to remove any of the top 50 and would just make his vote list the next 25.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dropping players from the first one would mean that, 25 or 50 years from now, great players who made this group of 75 could get jettisoned, too.</p>

<p>For the prestige and honor to endure, that one and this one had to last. That’s when I decided I had to keep the first 50 intact and add 25.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember Bill Simmons and a few others all saying the same thing. Votes came out and it&rsquo;s clear they all thought that too.</p>

      <label for="lt4bsvj" class="commentText"><p>If the media voters weren&rsquo;t so insistent on including everyone who made the top 50 in the Top 75, a list that only rounded out to 50 because they scraped the bottom of the barrel. Plenty of worthy players, including Dwight, would have made it in.</p>

<p>Guys like Dave DeBusschere, Billy Cunningham, Dave Bing had no real place in a top 75. At least the early players like Dolph Schayes have an argument for being foundational players or something along those lines.</p>

<p>But those 3 were just pretty good players, who played on good-great teams well after the NBA had been established.</p>

<p>I feel like the media ruined it by doing a Next 25, rather than a top 75.</p>

<p>Should&rsquo;ve been top 75, not next 25. They ruined it by just making it next 25.</p>

<p>Like Dwight, Melo, Dame and Brow are all easy picks for a top 75. We should&rsquo;ve been arguing over whether guys like Klay or TP or Alex English should be getting in. Not some of the best players of the past 25 years.</p>
