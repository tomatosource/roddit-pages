      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1f8bkbp/what_team_are_you_a_believer_in_for_either_this/"><p>What team are you a believer in for either this upcoming season or for their core long-term?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Last week, I posted in here asking if there was a team that you didn&rsquo;t see the vision for, aka what team who you don&rsquo;t think is going to be very good this year or who&rsquo;s long term plan makes no sense.</p>

<p>Now, I wanted to shift the conversation in a more positive direction and ask what&rsquo;s the one team that you believe in more than most? Now, this isn&rsquo;t like a &ldquo;who&rsquo;s the best team&rdquo; or anything like that, rather it&rsquo;s a team who you think is going to be much better than what seems to be the consensus. This can either be a team that you think is going to overperform their expectations this year, or a team who&rsquo;s not competing this year but is on the right track and could be relevant again in just a couple of years.</p>

<p>For me, it&rsquo;s the Atlanta Hawks. Their roster is super young (Trae could be their oldest starter) and has a lot of room for growth. I think Dyson Daniels is much better of a fit next to Trae since he isn&rsquo;t very ball dominant and a good defender (essentially what people thought DJM would be) and a Risaccher/Jalen Johnson wing combo has a lot of potential to be really good and really fun. Another thing is that they don&rsquo;t own their picks for the next 3 years, so there&rsquo;s literally no reason for them to head towards a rebuild unless they get their picks back from San Antonio. With no incentive to tank, I think they&rsquo;ll try and add at the deadline or next FA cycle to try and become a real threat in the east</p>

Franz is very iffy with his outside shot being so bad and he’s not some elite defender. Paolo went off in the playoffs but his regular season efficiency was actually below league avg.</p>

<p>Still need to see more from both of them.</p>

      <label for="lle12ni" class="commentText"><p>This is a biiiig swing year for Portland.  It&rsquo;s all about Scoot, Sharpe, and the lottery pick.</p>

<p>If Scoot/Sharpe come out and look like future allstars and/or they land Flagg/Bailey they&rsquo;re suddenly one of the most talented young teams in the league.  Camara was one of the best defenders in the league as a rookie.  Deni Avdija is a big wing that can shoot, pass, and defend and he&rsquo;s on one of the best contracts in the NBA.  And then there&rsquo;s Clingan protecting the rim.  Then they are loaded with useful players and tradeable contracts after that.  Grant, Simons, Timelord, Reath, Thybulle, Jabari Walker, Murray, etc.</p>

<p>At the end of the day though that&rsquo;s just a bunch of good pieces without the centerpiece.  They need one of Scoot/Sharpe/the lottery pick to turn into a future allstar guy at the very least or the Blazers rebuild is going nowhere.  Even if just one of them is just an allstar they are likely be heading for mediocrity.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a real chance between the 3 there&rsquo;s an all-nba player and another allstar and then the Blazers would be set up to have a very very good team in the future.  But if it doesn&rsquo;t go that way it&rsquo;s going to be ugly until they find that piece.</p>

      <label for="lldc4sr" class="commentText"><p>Easy one but the spurs for me. I just like that they are embracing soft tanking.</p>

<p>Signing Chris Paul was perfect in that u legitimately got some pg help but it’s also possible Paul will miss 20-30 games.</p>

<p>They shouldn’t try to win this year. Why would that make any sense when the draft is stacked. Soft tank for one more year. Imagine if they win the lotto and get Flagg.</p>

<p>They can let their new draft pick run point guard behind tre jones if/when Chris Paul gets hurt. Kinda like the Sochan experiment. It won’t lead to wins and it will definitely lead to losses since castle is nowhere close to starting pg material now but he will get experience leading an offense while being a tank commander.</p>

<p>Wemby is already good enough where the spurs could make a push for a late playoff seed if they wanted to. But by basically not acquiring anyone of value except the corpse of Chris Paul, you can rest easy knowing you’ll be in the Flagg sweepstakes.</p>

<p>I also think ppl are quick to assume someone like Jeremy Sochan will be around long term. Imo I don’t think anyone on this spurs roster aside from wemby and Vassell (even he isn’t guaranteed) will be on the roster when they are ready to compete. Sochan is straight up not a good player right now, don’t really care what spurs fans say. He’s so bad on offense, his defense doesn’t make up for it. I’ve watched him too so spurs fans will try to act like u don’t watch him so u don’t know his impact blah blah blah. I think the spurs are perfectly content letting Sochan play heavy minutes and see if he earns a spot on that franchise for the future. But it’s so far from guaranteed.</p>

      <label for="lldhy6z" class="commentText"><p>Difference between Castle and Sochan is that Castle actually has PG skills</p>

<p>Sochan sucks and won&rsquo;t be on the team when they start trying to win I agree but Castle will find a way to be impactful one way or another guy is just a winner</p>

      <label for="lldkdfz" class="commentText"><p>Yeah castle has more potential to be around in the long term compared to Sochan. I could see castle becoming a 3 and D pg where he’s not really the main playmaker of the offense but he’s just a guard that defends well, passes well, can run p and r, and shots well enough.</p>

      <label for="lldlwxc" class="commentText"><p>I cannot agree anymore about Sochan. There a few Draymond types who are good enough to still provide value with no shooting, currently Sochan has no skills whatsoever offensively. He’s very young and the Spurs know better than me, so he could turn it around, but if I had to guess he’s not going to be around long term. </p>

      <label for="lldn2c5" class="commentText"><p>The issue with the draymond comps is that Sochan isn’t anywhere near the defender draymond was when he came into the league. They don’t play anything alike offensively or defensively so I just found it really baffling spurs fans tried to make that comp.</p>

<p>Draymond was pretty much immediately a rim protector for golden state. He avg over 1 block and 1 steal every year after his rookie season. And by his second season, draymond was avg 7 assists per game.</p>

<p>Sochan just doesn’t come anywhere close to that.</p>

      <label for="lldy0ze" class="commentText"><p>Dyson isn&rsquo;t just not ball dominant, he&rsquo;s generally considered a negative on offense.  Should be better a better fit but the real reason the hawks got DJ was not for defense but because of the Miami series a few years back where they shut Trae down and made us look terrible (only stole one because of Trae heroics).  Hopefully that problem is solved with JJs emergence and Kobe taking a step forward alongside Bogi doing his thing, but it&rsquo;s a real concern.</p>

<p>The bits I saw from the Olympics have me hopeful about Dyson though and I&rsquo;m super excited to see how we look with him and ZR.  If Dyson can just be a connector who hits some open shots while playing elite defense that would be huge.</p>

<p>We also have the lakers fully unportected pick next year which could be super valuable if one of their stars is injured for an extended time.  That could end up being the centerpiece in a deadline trade or a lottery pick in a very strong draft.  After next off-season though we&rsquo;re very bare on draft assets for a couple years, so that&rsquo;s our last obvious opportunity for improvement in the immediate future.</p>

<p>Amen Thompson is so overhyped on this sub my god. He doesn’t excel at anything except defense. That is not good enough to make u a starter in the nba.</p>

<p>Reed Sheppard is 6’1 and isn’t a good enough passer as it stands to be a pg. Hes like a sg in a pg’s body.</p>

<p>Jabari smith is up in the air. He showed real improvements last year with his efficiency so will see with him but definitely not a sure building block for the future.</p>

<p>Jalen green is just a bust. 3 straight years of the exact same statlines.</p>

<p>Sengun is basically the only actually real building block that houston has but you wouldn’t know that reading this sub.</p>

      <label for="lldhgu7" class="commentText"><p>Yeah they often get put in the same tier as orlando without any of their young guys having proven as much. Amen, reed, jabari are mostly potential right now (although I think reed will be good). I like sengun but I don’t think his ceiling is much higher than where he is now unless he starts making  threes. Not really convinced jalen green or whitmore will contribute to great team basketball at any point or be worth big contracts, but we’ll see.</p>

      <label for="lldhqev" class="commentText"><p>i kind of agree, but think there&rsquo;s a lot of room for them to improve. people on this sub often confuse potential and talent, and that just because you have a lot of young guys with all-star potential, it means that some of them are guaranteed to reach that potential and become an elite core or something.</p>

<p>Jalen Green is the biggest X-Factor for them. If March Jalen Green from last year was a sign of real improvement and not just a few good shooting games, then Houston will be legit. If he goes back to who he was for most of the year (and quite frankly, his career) then I think their team is pretty much capped at being a low-level playoff or play-in team.</p>
