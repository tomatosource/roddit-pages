    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Last week, I posted in here asking if there was a team that you didn&rsquo;t see the vision for, aka what team who you don&rsquo;t think is going to be very good this year or who&rsquo;s long term plan makes no sense.</p>

<p>Now, I wanted to shift the conversation in a more positive direction and ask what&rsquo;s the one team that you believe in more than most? Now, this isn&rsquo;t like a &ldquo;who&rsquo;s the best team&rdquo; or anything like that, rather it&rsquo;s a team who you think is going to be much better than what seems to be the consensus. This can either be a team that you think is going to overperform their expectations this year, or a team who&rsquo;s not competing this year but is on the right track and could be relevant again in just a couple of years.</p>

<p>For me, it&rsquo;s the Atlanta Hawks. Their roster is super young (Trae could be their oldest starter) and has a lot of room for growth. I think Dyson Daniels is much better of a fit next to Trae since he isn&rsquo;t very ball dominant and a good defender (essentially what people thought DJM would be) and a Risaccher/Jalen Johnson wing combo has a lot of potential to be really good and really fun. Another thing is that they don&rsquo;t own their picks for the next 3 years, so there&rsquo;s literally no reason for them to head towards a rebuild unless they get their picks back from San Antonio. With no incentive to tank, I think they&rsquo;ll try and add at the deadline or next FA cycle to try and become a real threat in the east</p>

      <label for="lldc4sr" class="commentText"><p>Easy one but the spurs for me. I just like that they are embracing soft tanking.</p>

<p>Signing Chris Paul was perfect in that u legitimately got some pg help but it’s also possible Paul will miss 20-30 games.</p>

<p>They shouldn’t try to win this year. Why would that make any sense when the draft is stacked. Soft tank for one more year. Imagine if they win the lotto and get Flagg.</p>

<p>They can let their new draft pick run point guard behind tre jones if/when Chris Paul gets hurt. Kinda like the Sochan experiment. It won’t lead to wins, it will definitely lead to losses but castle will get experience leading an offense.</p>

<p>Wemby is already good enough where the spurs could make a push for a late playoff seed if they wanted to. But by basically not acquiring anyone of value except the corpse of Chris Paul, you can rest easy knowing you’ll be in the Flagg sweepstakes.</p>

<p>I also think ppl are quick to assume someone like Jeremy Sochan will be around long term. Imo I don’t think anyone on this spurs roster aside from wemby and Vassell (even he isn’t guaranteed) will be on the roster when they are ready to compete. Sochan is straight up not a good player right now don’t really care what spurs fans say. He’s so bad in offense, his defense doesn’t make up for it. I’ve watched him too so spurs fans will try to act like u don’t watch him so u don’t know his impact blah blah blah. I think the spurs are perfectly content letting Sochan play heavy minutes and see if he earns a spot on that franchise for the future. But it’s so far from guaranteed.</p>
