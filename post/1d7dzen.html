<p>Johnson said that the clippers broke up because of the utah jazz and then barnes chimed in and blamed it on doc giving his son the money.</p>

<p>I actually think he played pretty well for the money he was being paid lol, dude was a very solid player.</p>

<p>I know we aren&rsquo;t supposed to compare NBA job to real life, but it&rsquo;s basically the equivalent of senior management hiring their son that flunked out of business school to a position he wouldn&rsquo;t get anywhere near without the connections.

<p>People don&rsquo;t seem to remember this and there&rsquo;s a surprising amount of pushback these days when you call Austin Rivers a huge beneficiary of nepotism.  Like all this &ldquo;he carved out a nice NBA career all on his own&rdquo; stuff.  Like his dad didn&rsquo;t totally rescue his career.   Austin was one of the worst per-minute players in the NBA his first few years, and like you said, it was super unusual to not have his option picked up.  That kind of career path usually ends up in you being Josh Jackson aka out of the league at 24.</p>

<p>How many high lottery picks get years to figure it in their mid-20s with no fear of failure? How many guys with fringe NBA talent could eventually figure out a role and valuable skillset if they were gifted minutes for two or three seasons and had the full support of an organization during that time?</p>

<p>Kinda off topic, I know, but it&rsquo;s always so weird when people act like he totally succeeded on his own.  You see it in this thread - &ldquo;Austin Rivers could actually play. He played like 10 seasons and 700 games&rdquo; and stuff like that.</p>

<p>For sure. Like the person can be future HOFer, an All Star, bench player or even a bust and it&rsquo;s still nepotism at the end of the day if the person only got opportunities because he&rsquo;s related to someone with a lot of influence. It&rsquo;s the same with Bronny now as although I wish to see him develop well, he&rsquo;s only getting all this attention and workout invites because he&rsquo;s Bron&rsquo;s kid</p>

<p>People don&rsquo;t seem to remember this and there&rsquo;s a surprising amount of pushback these days when you call Austin Rivers a huge beneficiary of nepotism.

<p>Pretty sure most people know this. It&rsquo;s like the only thing people remember about Austin&rsquo;s career. We just recognize that he turned out to be a pretty solid role player, but I&rsquo;ve never seen one person argue that his signing with the Clippers was anything but nepotism.</p>

      <label for="l70x9j3" class="commentText"><p>Your comment highlights how competitiveness in the league doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make for a meritocracy, obvious outliers like Bronny notwithstanding. Many players outside the 450ish roster spots have what it takes, but maybe not the time on a team, the right fit, or whatever other opportunities to make it work. The cream doesn&rsquo;t always rise to the crop when it comes to role and fringe players, even in a hyper competitive work environment where one would theoretically think merit would win out. The real world is much murkier. </p>

<p>Austin Rivers’ wasn’t even that much money among them. It’s not like it was an overpay</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not just the money. Austin didn&rsquo;t deserve to be getting minutes on a team that was trying to contend for a title. Heck, Austin didn&rsquo;t deserve minutes on a play-in level team.</p>

<p>It was also especially notable that Doc refused to give any young guys a chance. The team badly needed a SF for years (they defended KD with CP3, to give you an idea how weak their SF spot was), yet he refused to play Reggie Bullock. Brice Johnson was drafted in the 1st and couldn&rsquo;t even get on the floor.</p>

<p>Except Austin, of course. He got all the minutes he wanted. He was inexplicably on the floor for clutch time during the playoffs, which is how the whole &ldquo;Here comes Austin Rivers!&rdquo; moment was even possible to begin with.</p>

<p>But also the money. Austin got a 3 yr $35M contract in 2016 that he didn&rsquo;t deserve. Better players who signed for similar money that summer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Aaron Afflalo 2 yr, $25M</li>
<li>Rajon Rondo 2 yr, $28M (Clippers badly needed a backup PG, but he doesn&rsquo;t like CP3)</li>
<li>Jeremy Lin 3 yr, $36M</li>
<li>Courtney Lee 4 yr, $48M</li>
<li>Mo Harkless 4 yr, $42M</li>
<li>Eric Gordon, 4 yr, $53M</li>
</ul>

<p>Any of these guys would&rsquo;ve been better signings than Austin.</p>

<p>The best argument you can make for Doc is that by 2016 the Warriors were miles ahead of the Clippers, and Doc gave up. And that&rsquo;s his best case.</p>

<p>Also ur so clueless about the minutes you conveniently forgot that CP3 was injured most of time especially in the playoffs.</p>

<p>AR just played with 8 stitches in the eye vs prime Dame Lillard and dropped almost 20-10 in elimination game.</p>

<p>Clippers dont win vs Spurs without Austin exploding one game, and multiple games vs Rockets before getting eliminated with injured both CP3 and Blake.</p>

<p>Affalo was out of the league two years later and put up similar if not worse numbers than Rivers.</p>

<p>Rondo still thought of himself as a starting PG. He wasn&rsquo;t going to back up CP3.</p>

<p>Mo Harkless was not better. Everyone was down on Eric Gordon after his injury prone tenure in New Orleans. Morey got so much criticism siging EG to that 4 year guarnateed contract given how much of a let donw he was in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Lin sure, but given how injury prone Lin ended up being (essentially injured 2 and a half seasons of that 3 year deal) he wasn&rsquo;t better.</p>

<p>Courtney Lee was the only one on that contract that was definitively better at the time.</p>

Also, I can&rsquo;t understand how it doesn&rsquo;t negatively impact the locker room. Players are fighting for minutes, new contracts. Millions of dollars are on the line. Then you have this dude coaching his son and giving him minutes. Some might say Austin deserved those minutes but I guarantee at least half the locker room would feel there is favoritism. Deserved or undeserved your locker room is already split. Someone from the Clippers should have vetoed that move. The only way it would have worked was if Austin was a bonafide super star. I mean Steph, Bron, Joker or Luka level super star. For a role player it was going to cause a rift in the locker. No way around it.</p>

<p>When?</p>

<p>He was a bench guy who shot a lot, and did so poorly. He couldn&rsquo;t pass and could barely dribble in anything besides a straight line.</p>

<p>In his Clippers tenure, Austin never had a Net Rating better than minus-6. And that was on a team that won 53 games.</p>

<p>The season he was &ldquo;good&rdquo; (aka, Doc let him shoot a bunch), he was 4th on the team in FGA/game (more than Gallinari) and 14th in TS%.</p>

<p>Just becasue Barnes and Jackson are morons doesn&rsquo;t make Austin a good player.</p>

<p>whatever you think of them, barnes and sjax came from rough backgrounds and had to fight for absolutely everything they ever got in the league. barnes was there at the origins of the then-called d-league making zero dollars for several seasons, and jackson played multiple multiple years overseas before breaking through.</p>

<p>no shit they hate the silver spoon kid who was the son of the celtics head coach given every advantage that ever existed, who STILL didnt make it as long as either of them did</p>

Jackson was complaining Bronny is ten times better than Austin Rivers was in college when the reality of it is that Rivers was far far superior to Bronny. Dude had a headstart by coming from an NBA family, but he played and got paid for basically average NBA production.</p>

<p>Make no mistake that Clippers bench was generally one of the worst in the NBA, you had chucker Jamal Crawford going <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>17</sub> (6moty winning seasons btw), overall horrible play with nobody on the court who can run the offence and Doc Rivers who <em>refused</em> to stagger CP3 or Blake&rsquo;s minutes. The starting 5 was actually championship worthy sadly enough.</p>

<p>People live up to job expectations that their resumes don&rsquo;t qualify them for all the time. That the hiring lived up to the expectations for the role doesn&rsquo;t prove the ordinary merit-based hiring processes were followed.</p>

As a GM, i (think i know) my son’s character and what he brings to a locker room. There have been crazier let’s take a flyer moves. The contract was meh. But it worked out, and Austin played well enough for most of the nepo shit to disappear for the rest of his career until.. now. All of this coming from someone who literally met him in a college bar in New Orleans (not a favorable impression tbh) and hated him till he played hard for the rockets. I respect his game and knowledge of the game of basketball.</p>

<p>Austin Rivers could actually play. He played like 10 seasons and 700 games. Maybe being coached by your own father isn&rsquo;t the smartest thing out there but he was still a decent player.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not doing Bronny any good, he should stay in college, just like playing under Doc didn&rsquo;t do Austin any good when it comes to the nepotism slander.</p>

<p>He became an average player, but at the time of his acquisition by the Clippers, he was not that.</p>

      <label for="l6z1kfg" class="commentText"><p>I think most people saying he was good for the Clippers (which is true for the most part) and Barnes is just talking shit are forgetting how things went down.</p>

<p>Austin Rivers was terrible for the Pelicans and was traded to Boston as a throw in to facilitate a Jeff Green trade. He was gonna be a free agent and he was only gonna get DNPs in Boston. That&rsquo;s when Doc traded for him, gave him 20 minutes per game on a playoff team despite him not being good and after the season gave him a guaranteed contract with a player option after the first year (which he declined and Doc re-signed him for a big contract).</p>

<p>Did Austin end up living up to the contract? Probably (good on him for putting the work and improving) but at the time every single person thought Doc was prioritizing saving his son&rsquo;s career over the Clippers title hopes. I know people want to hate on Barnes (fair enough) and I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s quite what &ldquo;broke up Lob City&rdquo; but I can absolutely believe the Clippers locker room wasn&rsquo;t happy with the whole thing at the time, in fact I&rsquo;d be surprised if they weren&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Austin improving after all that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that the Clippers players definitely felt a certain way about Doc-Austin while it was happening.</p>

      <label for="l700mzd" class="commentText"><p>That’s dumb. Austin legit won the clippers playoff games. Huge game in 2015 against the spurs. Hit 7 straight baskets. Clippers would have been down 3-1 if he didn’t go crazy. Won without cp3 against the rockets in two different games. Then the year after almost forced a game 7 with no Blake and no cp3 against a lillard led blazers if it wasn’t for a dumb loose ball foul on a rebound by Jeff green.</p>

<p>I don’t think many clippers fans from the lob city days hold any dislike for rivers.</p>

<p>Real reason it failed wasn’t just the dislike of cp3 by Blake and Deandre. It was that cp3 and Blake kept getting injured or kept disappearing in the ducking clutch.</p>

      <label for="l70l29f" class="commentText"><p>Austin Rivers was a legitimately solid role player and I don&rsquo;t think was over particularly overpaid by any team, looking at his career salaries.  Even as an older vet on the Nuggets I thought he played his ass off and was a great teammate.</p>

<p>This is a really dumb notion that gets parroted a lot.  Perhaps the family connection was the reason for the deal, but it wasn&rsquo;t a bad deal and Austin would&rsquo;ve made that money no matter what cause he was a good role player for contenders.  The most he ever made was $11 million a year.  He was worth that, unquestionably, and it made sense from a roster perspective and contender status as the clippers were.  The only reason people think it&rsquo;s a bad deal is cause of the family connection, which is just missing the point of the issue of nepotism.  Someone being paid a legitimately fair salary for what they are legitimately able to do in their profession shouldn&rsquo;t be considered &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; because that salary is being paid by a family member.  The issue is when someone is depriving a more deserving person of their position and salary due to nepotism.  That isn&rsquo;t the cause with Austin, dude earned his shit</p>

      <label for="l6zl1c9" class="commentText"><p>Austin Rivers wasn&rsquo;t very good, and when you think about how small an NBA roster is every spot matters. Wasting it on the coach&rsquo;s son so he can have a pricey internship weakens the roster and probably annoys the guys who are talented enough to be in the league.</p>

      <label for="l6zonl7" class="commentText"><p>I don’t follow the Clippers closely and don’t remember the ins and outs of that team, but some lottery picks get all kinds of chances to stick to a team. Kevin Knox was in the league last year. Frank Ntilikina was on a team for the 2022-2023 season.</p>

<p>Austin Rivers is far from the only lottery pick that got a chance after his first situation didn’t work out. Doc being his dad didn’t hurt of course, but let’s not act like he’s the only lottery pick to ever get a chance. And he made it work, so maybe the other scouts or player personnel in LA also liked Rivers’ game.</p>

<p>He was on his way out of the NBA but this lifeline gave him all the opportunities he needed to get better, well, good enough to stay in the NBA.</p>

<p>That’s privileged. The privileged among us get infinite opportunities to fail, as many times as they like in as many ways as they like for as long as they like.</p>
