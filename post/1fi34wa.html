      <label for="lnf2275" class="commentText"><p>To be fair, Unicaja is better than a bunch of Euroleague teams this season.</p>

<p>But even as a fan of Unicaja this isn&rsquo;t a fair comparision. We&rsquo;re a team that has kept the same 10+ players for the past three seasons and have played 80+ games a season. Unicaja is super in tune with eachother. Meanwhile the GLeague United team is a team of players that have never played together before, under a set of rules they&rsquo;ve never played under before doing the best they can.</p>

<p>Even then Osetkowski is better than any of the guys playing for that GLeague team.</p>

      <label for="lnfb3x4" class="commentText"><p>Also worth noting that G League team rosters are not constructed with the primary intention of winning basketball games. It&rsquo;s literally a farm league, where the main objective is to develop a small subset of its players so that they can transition to the NBA (usually as role players, not even as full starters yet alone stars). Compare this to any Euroleague team where obviously teams are trying to win titles and their team composition, playstyle and minutes distributions will reflect that.</p>

<p>The guy&rsquo;s comments were dumb, but if he&rsquo;s just said it was the second most talented league in the world then he&rsquo;d at least have a better argument.</p>

      <label for="lnfqr71" class="commentText"><p>Alba Berlin, Paris, LDLC Asvel, Baskonia, I would argue Bayern now that they&rsquo;ve lost Ibaka, Bonga, Francisco and Laso are for me worse than Unicaja on equal conditions. Since we had the benefit of a lighter continental schedule we finished ahead of Barça and Madrid beating them both with a squad I would argue is worse than the one we have now. But it needs to be said, we had more rest than those teams. Just my opinion, obviously it is very hard to tell although we&rsquo;ve already beaten teams like Monaco and Baskonia in preseason (not indicative of their full level once the season starts but still)</p>

      <label for="lnfsu15" class="commentText"><p>We had a horrible time after we were in the Euroleague I think around 2017. We had a couple solid seasons but the COVID season and the following made it hard for Unicaja (the bank) to keep pushing money into the team. The team got rapidly worse, finished 12th in the Spanish league, god knows what happened in the Eurocup but ultimately Unicaja ended up joining the BCL for its lesser strain of schedule and better economical upside. Unicaja is a team that will flourish economically if it&rsquo;s winning no matter the competition due to its loyal fanbase, so they prefer playing in a lower competition they know they can win and also benefits them economically.</p>

<p>I think Baskonia is desperately hanging on to a Euroleague spot for its history kind of like Unicaja did a couple of seasons back. It&rsquo;s a team that lacks the financial support of the biggest teams ut still has enough to stay afloat and a mantained team culture that makes them fight and hard to beat. Last year they made the Euroleague playoffs but sacrificed the Spanish league and failed to make those playoffs as a result.</p>

<p>Teams of similar magnitude, only one has chosen to fight to regain national prestige while the other one is trying to retain any continental prestige they have left.</p>

Unicaja finished 1st in Spain in the regular season with 2 wins against Barcelona and 1 against Real Madrid. They are clearly in the top tier of European clubs.</p>

<p>Unicaja could focus on the Spanish league to a much higher degree and have a much more rested squad than Euroleague teams, who had 1-2 Euroleague games each week.</p>

<p>Unicaja has a better team than Alba, ASVEL and maybe Paris, every other Euroleague team has a better squad than them.</p>

<p>Even that is debatable. Take Kendrick Perry for example, the F4 MVP last year. In his short stint in Euroleague he was an unimpressive role player for Panathinaikos, which was one of the worst teams in the league at the time.</p>

      <label for="lnel6c1" class="commentText"><p>We just saw France beat a Canadian team with 10 solid to great NBA players (SGA), led by three Euroleague players (Yabusele, Cordinier and Lessort).</p>

<p>Those Detroit and Charlotte squad&rsquo;s are tanking/focusing on developing talent over winning, while the best Euroleague teams (Panathinaikos, Real Madrid, Olympiacos) are built to win, have better chemistry and are stacked with players who could play in the NBA based on current quality, but don&rsquo;t do so for a number of reasons (the money in Europe is a lot better than an NBA minimum for some, NBA teams prefer their end of bench spots to go to young prospects with high upside and good locker room guys etc.).</p>

<p>Yabusele is an example, he was one of the best power forwards in Europe, but wasn&rsquo;t an elite player, yet he got himself an NBA contract because of a great Olympic showing.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re a lot more players like Yabusele, but teams prefer to have guys like Tristan Vukcevic get minutes in hopes that they can develop into a 3x better Yabusele in the future, than give his minutes to a guy who&rsquo;s currently twice the player, but has a much worse upside.</p>

      <label for="lneur3k" class="commentText"><p>I like what your trying to say but it&rsquo;s not entirely true, Yabusele was previously in the NBA as a 16th pick. He was that young guy with potential that teams wanted to develop. He didn&rsquo;t work out so he was cut from the NBA and went to Europe. There are no grand conspiracies.</p>

<p>Some people are late bloomers, I hope he is better this time around. But it&rsquo;s not like he wasn&rsquo;t given a shot at the NBA. He just wasn&rsquo;t good enough and no other team wanted to pick him up when he was released.</p>

      <label for="lneyyq3" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ll put it like this.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s Player A and Player B.</p>

<p>Player A is 20 years old, doesn&rsquo;t have the quality currently to contribute for a winning team in the NBA, but has the potential to be at least a good starter level player in the future.</p>

<p>Player B is 31 years old, has the quality to be a low tier rotation/end of bench guy for a winning team in the NBA, but is in his prime currently and won&rsquo;t improve noticeable (or at all) in the future.</p>

<p>NBA teams, especially tanking ones, will choose to sign Player A to get at least 10-15 MPG during the regular season over Player B <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> times.</p>

<p>It has nothing to do with Yabusele specifically, it&rsquo;s that there are a lot of Euroleague players who fit into the Player B category.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like comparing Marathon runners with 1500M runners. It looks the same, but I honestly believe that most European players (ex: Vezenkov or Micic) will mostly be as effective as most NBA players over the course of <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> games, but NBA is so much more demanding with the rythm of games that a lot of european talents aren&rsquo;t really able to keep a good level of performance over and over.</p>

      <label for="lnf7hj0" class="commentText"><p>First and foremost, anyone who has ever paid even the slightest attention to international basketball knows that G-league isn&rsquo;t close to competing with some of the international leagues. The G-league also serves an entirely different purpose than those international leagues and as such employees of all types approach the game differently.</p>

<p>HOWEVER the number one rule difference that helps international teams against NBA(not G-league) competition is the duration of the game. A standard NBA game is 20% longer than a standard FIBA game, which greatly increases the better team&rsquo;s chance of winning.</p>

      <label for="lneudfg" class="commentText"><p>Juancho hernangomez did not lead anything in Panathinakos during their last European campaign, although showing how he could still be a good system player on a top Euroleague contender.
Not even the Wizards, Pistons, Hornets have any kind of interest on having a similar kind of player, except for mentorship roles such as Udonis, Dudley or Rose in Memphis.
What&rsquo;s been said before is 100% the truth, the &ldquo;European talent&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t only rely in the individuals that play the game, but also in the system, or how they fit with each other.
The last Olympics talked for that, Cordinier, was not even finding his spot in Virtus Bologna during the Italian Serie A season, but still he resulted in being a key factor for France, just for being a perfect gear in the team engine.
European basketball is great for that.</p>

The young squads in the NBA still win 20-25% of their games against NBA competition, these teams aren’t going 2-80. Their average scoring margin is around -10, they lose by about 10 points on average. In short, I wouldn’t say they’re being wrecked regularly even by NBA teams.</p>

<p>You have to either think that the Euroleague talent is better than the NBA talent they would otherwise be playing (it’s not) or that playing FIBA rules is that big of a difference. I don’t think the rule change is that drastic but I’ll give you it’s at least possible.</p>

They still have a roster full of NBA caliber players while the best Euroleague teams at best only have a handful of guys at the NBA level. They also compete night in and night out in an 82 game season against the best teams in the world (with many games being more competitive than you&rsquo;d think). If you had the worst NBA teams actually try, they&rsquo;d destroy the best teams in Europe.</p>

<p>On a random night the Pistons may just beat the Celtics, nobody in Europe is even coming close to beating Boston.</p>

      <label for="lnep0e4" class="commentText"><p>sorry but this is not a good comparison. High-end Euroleague teams could probably beat some NBA teams on a bad day. But as a whole there are some bad or mediocre Euroleague teams that wouldn&rsquo;t do well in the domestic Spanish league, the ACB. In other words, Unicaja would be a middle of the pack Euroleague team if the amount of teams per country weren&rsquo;t limited. But if you seriously think this team is the best the G league has to offer, I can just peak at the top 50 scorers in the G league last year and not find a single player on this team. Here&rsquo;s an easy alternative one:</p>

<p>Centers: Adam Sanogo, Usman Garuba, Oscar Tshiebwe, and Wenyen Gabriel</p>

<p>Forwards: Hunter Tyson, Malcom Hill, Ethan Thompson, Justin Champagnie, Jordan Miller, Leonard Miller</p>

<p>Guards: Elfrid Payton, JD Davidson, Mac Mcclung, Malcolm Hill and Buddy Boeheim</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not an NBA team, nor are they beating Real Madrid or Panathinaikos. But they can flat out kill many Euroleague teams if they go through a proper training camp. That&rsquo;s my honest opinion</p>

<p>However, the reason why DeMar and his family never left California previously (even on a vacation) was because he didn’t have the money to do it.</p>

<p>Yeah, I’m sure it’s scary to leave your home state when you have never left for 20 years.</p>

<p>In DeMar’s case, his fear of leaving California was more than likely due to never leaving it.</p>

<p>Johnson averaged 14 MPG in his last NBA season prior to joining Panathinaikos in the Euroleague. He averaged 3 PTS and 2 REB on 35/26/67 shooting splits that season in the Euroleague and retired from basketball altogether after that.</p>

<p>Kaminsky had injury troubles, but averaged 21 MPG from 2015-16 to 2021-22. He played for the club I support in the Euroleague last season, was atrocious because of his awful defense and rebounding, and is still a free agent because no one wants to pick him up.</p>

      <label for="lnf0e3u" class="commentText"><p>No one in the EL would offer him a contract, he showed he doesn&rsquo;t belong here. Maybe some bottom teams in the 2nd-3rd leagues offered something. For example, Edmond Summner averaged 7 or 8 points on the Nets, signed with an EL team and he was one of the main reasons that team didn&rsquo;t make the playoffs. He was BY FAR the absolute worst player on the floor 95% of the time that got any minutes and he had an insanely long leash. He wouldn&rsquo;t be a detriment to the team in like 1 in 4 or 5 games. I am not exaggerating, he would have like 4-5 turnovers in 10 minutes every other game. And he was a rotational player on the Nets the year prior. After this year he went straight to China, absolutely nobody wanted him. He was the worst signing since Ty Lawson (who absolutely stunk it up here during lock out). There are huge style differences and not everyone can fit in. Undersized score first guards can not break NBA rotation while here they can actually be themselves and lead a team in 2nd or 3rd tier and get a chance in EL if they don&rsquo;t have a mentality that they are a star and realize that they have to actually work hard. That&rsquo;s why Keenan Evans was one of the most exciting players to watch until he tore his achiles, because he had that mentality and was really fucking good and gave his all every posession on defense as well. If they think they are the best because they just were in the NBA you get something like Ty Lawson or Wesley Johnson pretty often.</p>

      <label for="lnekdt1" class="commentText"><p>Lol, Oostende. Their League is considered the bottom of Europe. Nobody from our countries (the BNXT League stretches ove two countries) has ever made the final rounds of Euro League, met alone win anything more then a game or two, in European competitions.</p>

<p>So if that is where you are going as. GLeague player, you are done. You are going to have fun, win some national championship or cup, maybe see a few European countries, have a nice life, marry a hot Belgian chick, and never move back to the USA.</p>

<p>But you are not sniffing the NBA if you are in Oostende.</p>

Let&rsquo;s pretend that JTA added nothing to the 2022 championship, even though that&rsquo;s not true. He was around Steph, Dray, Klay, Steve Kerr, all legendary winners. That on its own is incredibly valuable. For all we know, this talk could be heavily inspired by something one of those guys said. JTA should be looked to as a vet and a voice to follow on this team</p>

      <label for="lnfom64" class="commentText"><p>Best euroleage teams would win against very bottom nba teams, most due nba teams tanking. Thats were Real, Panatinaikhos would end up at reg season, ~26th place. If nba teams would not tank, Real/Pao most likely would not win. Gotta understand tanking teams still have few top players in nba, while real/panatinaikos some ex players, but who were role or trash/bench. Overall player quality of bottom nba teams is better, is just their tactic is to tank. Mano-i-mano trying to win, bottom nba teams are better.</p>

<p>evan fournier last season 7.2 points in nba on bottom detroit team, he will be a superstar this season, likely candidate of best scorer title. Bojan bogdanovic was 20 pts on detroit, if he came to euroleague he would be superstar and most likely mvp.</p>

<p>40 year old cripple sabonis became euroleage mvp. kirilenko became euroleague mvp at the end of his career. What are we talking about? Mike james is nba trash, euroleagues best player give it or take it.
shane larkin was complete bench player in nba, set euroleague record i believe 49pts in a game.
If anything, euroleague champs are on a par of ncaa top 4 teams that has 3-4 nba draftees. Guess who usually fills euroleague teams? 5-7th players from top ncaa teams, nba wash outs bench players, or european nba player at their sunset of career.</p>

<p>As euro i could be bias and try to prop up top euroleague teams but thats not fair.
Unicaja if played in euroleague would be in top 12 or so, yet did not completely blow out a team of basically non nba players, that is not build to win, but more to develop, run and gun.</p>

<p>A team that plays in the 3rd tier European league just destroyed them.</p>
