      <label for="lnel6c1" class="commentText"><p>We just saw France beat a Canadian team with 10 solid to great NBA players (SGA), led by three Euroleague players (Yabusele, Cordinier and Lessort).</p>

<p>Those Detroit and Charlotte squad&rsquo;s are tanking/focusing on developing talent over winning, while the best Euroleague teams (Panathinaikos, Real Madrid, Olympiacos) are built to win, have better chemistry and are stacked with players who could play in the NBA based on current quality, but don&rsquo;t do so for a number of reasons (the money in Europe is a lot better than an NBA minimum for some, NBA teams prefer their end of bench spots to go to young prospects with high upside and good locker room guys etc.).</p>

<p>Yabusele is an example, he was one of the best power forwards in Europe, but wasn&rsquo;t an elite player, yet he got himself an NBA contract because of a great Olympic showing.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re a lot more players like Yabusele, but teams prefer to have guys like Tristan Vukcevic get minutes in hopes that they can develop into a 3x better Yabusele in the future, than give his minutes to a guy who&rsquo;s currently twice the player, but has a much worse upside.</p>

      <label for="lneur3k" class="commentText"><p>I like what your trying to say but it&rsquo;s not entirely true, Yabusele was previously in the NBA as a 16th pick. He was that young guy with potential that teams wanted to develop. He didn&rsquo;t work out so he was cut from the NBA and went to Europe. There are no grand conspiracies.</p>

<p>Some people are late bloomers, I hope he is better this time around. But it&rsquo;s not like he wasn&rsquo;t given a shot at the NBA. He just wasn&rsquo;t good enough and no other team wanted to pick him up when he was released.</p>

      <label for="lneudfg" class="commentText"><p>Juancho hernangomez did not lead anything in Panathinakos during their last European campaign, although showing how he could still be a good system player on a top Euroleague contender.
Not even the Wizards, Pistons, Hornets have any kind of interest on having a similar kind of player, except for mentorship roles such as Udonis, Dudley or Rose in Memphis.
What&rsquo;s been said before is 100% the truth, the &ldquo;European talent&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t only rely in the individuals that play the game, but also in the system, or how they fit with each other.
The last Olympics talked for that, Cordinier, was not even finding his spot in Virtus Bologna during the Italian Serie A season, but still he resulted in being a key factor for France, just for being a perfect gear in the team engine.
European basketball is great for that.</p>

<p>They just signed Osman, who is still an NBA level player and averaged 18 MPG last season, and Yurstseven, who averaged 11 MPG for the Heat last season, and those two are going to be rotation options for them next season.</p>

      <label for="lneqssu" class="commentText"><p>Don’t think so, unless you also think the best Euroleague teams would win the NBA championship under Euroleague rules. The young squads in the NBA still win 20-25% of their games against NBA competition, these teams aren’t going 2-80. Their average scoring margin is around -10, they lose by about 10 points on average. In short, I wouldn’t say they’re being wrecked regularly even by NBA teams.</p>

<p>You have to either think that the Euroleague talent is better than the NBA talent they would otherwise be playing (it’s not) or that playing FIBA rules is that big of a difference. I don’t think the rule change is that drastic but I’ll give you it’s at least possible.</p>

Even if they went -3 again, it would be a 12 point loss rather than 10, still not close a blowout in my opinion</p>

<p>Unicaja could focus on the Spanish league to a much higher degree and have a much more rested squad than Euroleague teams, who had 1-2 Euroleague games each week.</p>

<p>Unicaja has a better team than Alba, ASVEL and maybe Paris, every other Euroleague team has a better squad than them.</p>

<p>They can make it to certain European leagues, like ours, but not to anything significant.</p>

<p>You have to be at least Shane Larkin level, to be considered good around here in Euroleague. And he could not last in the NBA for long.</p>

So you don&rsquo;t need to be Shane Larkin level, you can be a couple levels below that.  I would say any 11th or 12th man on an NBA roster can fit into a Euroleague team comfortably.</p>

<p>Johnson averaged 14 MPG in his last NBA season prior to joining Panathinaikos in the Euroleague. He averaged 3 PTS and 2 REB on 35/26/67 shooting splits that season in the Euroleague and retired from basketball altogether after that.</p>

<p>Kaminsky had injury troubles, but averaged 21 MPG from 2015-16 to 2021-22. He played for the club I support in the Euroleague last season, was atrocious because of his awful defense and rebounding, and is still a free agent because no one wants to pick him up.</p>

<p>Those are just examples that I thought of first.</p>

Panathinaikos I believe is one of the top teams in Euroleague, someone like Wes Johnson could go to a lesser team if he wanted to, but it probably wasn&rsquo;t worth it given he made so much already in his career.</p>

<p>So if that is where you are going as. GLeague player, you are done. You are going to have fun, win some national championship or cup, maybe see a few European countries, have a nice life, marry a hot Belgian chick, and never move back to the USA.</p>

      <label for="lnep0e4" class="commentText"><p>sorry but this is not a good comparison. High-end Euroleague teams could probably beat some NBA teams on a bad day. But as a whole there are some bad or mediocre Euroleague teams that wouldn&rsquo;t do well in the domestic Spanish league, the ACB. In other words, Unicaja would be a middle of the pack Euroleague team if the amount of teams per country weren&rsquo;t limited. But if you seriously think this team is the best the G league has to offer, I can just peak at the top 50 scorers in the G league last year and not find a single player on this team. Here&rsquo;s an easy alternative one:</p>

<p>Centers: Adam Sanogo, Usman Garuba, Oscar Tshiebwe, and Wenyen Gabriel</p>

<p>Forwards: Hunter Tyson, Malcom Hill, Ethan Thompson, Justin Champagnie, Jordan Miller, Leonard Miller</p>

<p>Guards: Elfrid Payton, JD Davidson, Mac Mcclung, Malcolm Hill and Buddy Boeheim</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not an NBA team, nor are they beating Real Madrid or Panathinaikos. But they can flat out kill many Euroleague teams if they go through a proper training camp. That&rsquo;s my honest opinion</p>
