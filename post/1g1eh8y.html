      <label for="lrg96n9" class="commentText"><p>His variability stems from the fact that he doesn&rsquo;t generate a lot of rim pressure.  He&rsquo;s like one of the few #1 or #2 options in the league who gets 80%+ of his scoring from range, which is just subject to incredible variability.  Most high volume scoring options supplement their game with some inside/rim pressure and he does not.  That&rsquo;s why his free throw rate is abyssmal (~3 per game) compared to other guards especially of all-star caliber (SGA gets ~7, Curry gets ~5).</p>

<p>I think he&rsquo;s going to be more of the same - some months he&rsquo;s going to be on fire, and some months he&rsquo;s going to be disappointing.  He&rsquo;ll win a few games on his own, and probably lose a few too.  It&rsquo;s just whether he&rsquo;s hot during the playoffs or not at this point.  Being luckier with less injuries will also likely help him a lot.</p>

      <label for="lrggl8l" class="commentText"><p>Small, but I like how you listed SGA as 7 free throws per game. He actually averaged 11 FTA and 9 FTs the past two seasons, which actually only strengthens your point.</p>

<p>He’s probably one of the (if not THE) most consistent players in the entire league and that comes in many ways from his free throw-based/drive-based game. Doesn’t matter if the jumper is falling, he’s getting 7-10 points from the line.</p>

      <label for="lrgk5if" class="commentText"><p>What&rsquo;s funny is that I don&rsquo;t think Denver as a team needs more rim pressure.  AG and Jokic are enough to terrify defenses on that front, especially with back cuts from MPJ and Braun who are both excellent cutters.  What Denver needs is Murray, MPJ, and (to some extent) Braun to shoot more.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s odd because if you wanted Murray wanted to make an all-star game, you&rsquo;d tell him to get to the rim more.  Getting to the line would make his PPG number skyrocket and his consistency go way up.  But if you want the Nuggets to win more, you&rsquo;ll tell him to run more 2 man game with Jokic and focus on getting more shots off handoffs, screens, and passes.  The more Murray drags guys out of the paint to shut him down, the better Denver&rsquo;s offense gets.</p>

      <label for="lrgg3ag" class="commentText"><p>Nice assessment. Murray&rsquo;s handles and first step aren&rsquo;t good. He gets his pocket picked too easily for a PG and has trouble beating defenders off the dribble. Thankfully he&rsquo;s athletic and plays off Jokic so well. I do think he&rsquo;s peaked even though he&rsquo;s only 27</p>

      <label for="lrgq239" class="commentText"><p>Good may have been the wrong word. But his handles aren&rsquo;t at a level I&rsquo;d expect for a PG with the contract he has. He&rsquo;s had his pocket picked way too easily in the playoffs, he has trouble getting around defenders in iso so he over dribbles. Barton handled the ball a ton when he was on the team.</p>

<p>Some examples</p>

<p>He brings other stuff like excellent shooting, cutting, size at the 1, willingness to set picks, etc.</p>

      <label for="lrgm9no" class="commentText"><p>Shai generates a lot more Fts than that. And Steph is prob not the best example, he’s not exactly some elite rim pressure either. Jamal shoots less FGAs than Steph in general, but his FT rate isn’t really that much worse. Both guys aren’t crazy athletic. A better example would be a guard that is explosive like an Ant Edwards or even a Dame that likes to attack with force and occasionally dunk</p>

If Murray can take just one more step in efficiency at the mid range and add more 3s I think it&rsquo;s fine if he doesn&rsquo;t generate rim pressure. You have AG and Jokic putting pressure down low and Murray and MPj up top.</p>

<p>MPJ needs to take another. He&rsquo;s getting paid like a 20+ pt guy.</p>

<p>If one of them takes a jump, that&rsquo;s big for the Nuggets. If two take a jump, they might be Western conference favorites.</p>

<p>None of this exists without Jokic, and none of it matters much if Murray isn&rsquo;t playing at least okay, but those things can easily be the difference between a tough second round loss and a title.</p>

      <label for="lrhb434" class="commentText"><p>Murray and MPJ will miss games and their depth is not the best. Jokic is once again gonna need another MVP level season for them to be a top 4 seed. Meanwhile the West will probably be even more competitive. The good thing is that their young players should get plenty of minutes.</p>

      <label for="lrgrd4j" class="commentText"><p>Julian strawther. He&rsquo;s a way better scorer on a bench that needs scoring. And has shown great progression every time he gets the opportunity.</p>

<p>Brauns jumpshot is the biggest question mark. It&rsquo;s definitely not who&rsquo;s filling brauns 15-20 minutes a night. And considering we win the wolves series if KCP could hit an open jumper it&rsquo;s not that big of a question.</p>

<p>This is  literally the repeat of last year when everyone said are bench was ass because we lost Bruce. News flash the  benched has sucked since the bubble. It&rsquo;s literally pointless we&rsquo;ve known that as soon as jokic sits we give up a run. Doesn&rsquo;t matter what collection of players.</p>

<p>As a nuggets fan, this is genuinely the best I&rsquo;ve felt about the bench since the bubble. This years bench definitely has more scoring capabilities than any other one we&rsquo;ve had since and the defense has been atrocious so.</p>

      <label for="lrh2mny" class="commentText"><p>Then who replaces Peyton Watson from last year? Again, the chain continues.</p>

<p>KCP played 31.6 minutes per game last year (in 76 games). Reggie Jackson played 22.2 MPG (in 82 games). Justin Holiday played 14.9 MPG (in 59 games).</p>

<p>That’s a lot of minutes to replace (nearly 70). Yeah, they added Westbrook and Saric, can expect some internal development from guys like Braun, Watson, Strawther, and Tyson, and get Cancar back, but that’s still a lot of ifs that need to materialize.</p>

<p>Not to mention the Nuggets were remarkably healthy last year outside of Murray.</p>

Sure it&rsquo;s slightly lower this year, but it would&rsquo;ve been even lower next year if we had to lose AG for KCP. Retaining AG gives the nuggets a better shot at the chip.

      <label for="lrgfebj" class="commentText"><p>You could have had both! The second apron only creates roster problems if you&rsquo;re in it for more than two years. Before then, it&rsquo;s just money. So you go in this year for KCP, stay in it to retain AG next year and then it isn&rsquo;t a problem for two offseasons. And Jokić doesn&rsquo;t have to fall off of a cliff if MPJ or AG or Murray does. Going 80% in on  a chip for three years is not as good as going 100% in for two, especially because even with KCP, the Nuggets aren&rsquo;t the most talented team in the league, the Celtics are. And even in the West, they&rsquo;re not significantly better than the Thunder, who would be much deeper even with KCP. The margins are razor thin at the top and the Nuggets lost one of their 5 best players from one of the best units in the league just to save money.</p>

<p>You should believe me as a Warriors fan when I say that you can have one of the best players in the world and if his role players fall off it doesn&rsquo;t really matter because it is much harder to re-assemble when the second tier stars on your team are not good and so retaining every bit of talent possible is important.</p>

      <label for="lrgh4b1" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think that’s a guarantee.</p>

<p>You can trade players (like KCP) to dump money if needed.</p>

<p>It’s a bit riskier because of potential injury, but say KCP makes it through the season (relatively) healthy and plays about fine. A lot of teams with cap space would be down to take him on cheap.</p>

<p>Like, you think Charlotte would balk at trading someone like Grant Williams (at 13 million) for KCP at 22? That saves Denver 9 million and gives them a very solid rotation piece with Williams. They could also even absorb him into cap space.</p>

      <label for="lri6uc9" class="commentText"><p>I feel like both of those players are at places with their careers and health where planning multiple years in the future for specifically them is actually a bit of a risk. KCP is 2 years older at 31 but actually really doesn&rsquo;t stay hurt Gordon despite being 29 has really sat out some serious time in his career. If you were betting on who would be healthy in two years you&rsquo;d have to go KCP just looking at it he&rsquo;s a way safer option the only bad thing you can really say about him is that he&rsquo;s 2 years older but 33 isn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> old</p>

<p>Russ versus Jackson may be a wash, but I don&rsquo;t see it as a big swing in either direction.  Saric or an improved Nnaji should combine for more backup at the 4-5 than last year,  but that isn&rsquo;t saying anything.  These can also backfire if Malone&rsquo;s insistence on playing bad veterans too much comes into play.</p>

<p>Jamal&rsquo;s health and that of the other returning starters is key.  Jamal had a great season last year until he got injured about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> through and hasn&rsquo;t been the same since. He and Jokic put on additional Olympic minutes, though that can also count as experience.</p>

      <label for="lrfxhvt" class="commentText"><p>It is wild to me how, to mostly everyone, Denver’s situation losing talent over the past two years while spending minimally to replace it paired with their new FO clearly not on the same page with Malone makes us think this will be a tougher season for them (relatively speaking, of course - as long as Jokic plays they’ll make the playoffs).</p>

<p>But most Nuggets fans and apparently AG legitimately believe they have improved and that KCP is replaceable. That Braun will replace KCP well in the starting lineup, that Watson will be great this year, and that Russ will fit in and provide value in a way he really hasn’t for years.</p>

<p>Quite the disconnect between the two takes. Nuggets fans could very well be vindicated, we’ll have to wait and see. But I definitely fall into the former camp, even though I think Braun and Watson are solid young players. I just struggle to believe that their depth is truly improved from last year - Saric and Westbrook don’t really move me.</p>

      <label for="lrg7cbt" class="commentText"><p>KCP is good but people are overhyping his impact. He&rsquo;s not a volume 3pt shooter and he exclusively takes (and Makes) WIDE OPEN 3s. Any nearby contest and he&rsquo;s swinging the rock. People talk about the &ldquo;threat to shoot&rdquo; and such but that applies way more for MPJ than KCP. Even Braun made something like 42% of his above the break 3&rsquo;s last year, CB is just ass from the corners.</p>

<p>KCPs defense is good, particularly on slippery guards, but the threats in the west that Denver has to worry about in OKC and Minny have big, strong guards that Braun is much better at defending.</p>

<p>Reggie Jackson was a bottom 3 rotation player in the NBA last season and replacing him with any version of Russ is a huge upgrade. Ditto for Saric over Zeke.</p>

<p>People have completely lost their minds when it comes to Denver. Any lineup with the big 4 is going to be +8-+15. We just need the bench to not be bottom 3 in the league and that&rsquo;s what WB and Saric are here for. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if they coast into a top 4 seed while resting Jok/Murray/MPJ/AG for 7-10 games each in the last 2 months of the season.</p>

<p>I have doubts about braun being able to fill that gap immediately, but he&rsquo;s proven himself to be pretty capable on the defensive end in last year&rsquo;s playoffs.</p>

      <label for="lrgz5wh" class="commentText"><p>And Braun was significantly better than KCP defensively in the Wolves series.  Ant was getting literally anything he wanted with KCP on him, but Braun had him in a torture chamber.  I love KCP, and he will be missed, but Braun is definitely ready to take over his role on the defensive end of the court.  If he can up his 3p volume to 4-5 shots a game and still hit them at 37%+(last season was 2 a game at 37%), which isn&rsquo;t a stretch at all given his increased minutes and significantly more time with Jokic, he will bring enough on the offensive side as well.</p>

<p>Our bench unit looks like it has the ability to be the best bench in years for us, which isn&rsquo;t a high bar to clear, but helps.  Even old/bad Russ will not be worse than Reggie, and Saric will be a significant upgrade to Zeke fuckin&rsquo; Nnaji lol, if Strawther can stay healthy he will be a very impactful bench player, and PWat is getting better and better every month.</p>

From my perspective I saw KCP as a pretty perfect fit in the starting lineup, and while I hear you about Braun and his defensive value, I&rsquo;m still not fully sold on the offense. Of course Denver doesn&rsquo;t rely on the 3 ball, but just the fact that Gordon/Braun/Watson/Westbrook are going to have to log heavy minutes and some combination of them will almost always be on the floor, to me seems like it could create some issues.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>See I&rsquo;m really just not sold on this part. Jackson and Naji were awful last year, but are Saric and Westbrook much of an upgrade at all??&hellip;. Again we&rsquo;ll have to see but I am not sold on the fit yet.</p>

<p>I appreciate your comment because I feel like it kind of embodies the first part of my first comment, just how far off non-Nuggets fans are in evaluating the roster versus Nuggets fans. Your top 4 is one of the best groupings I have ever seen play together, period, so I do agree that a top 4 finish wouldnt surprise me at all. How that plays out in the playoffs is a slightly different story, but now I&rsquo;m just getting WAY ahead of myself, it is only October lol.</p>

      <label for="lrgsffo" class="commentText"><p>Westbrook is pass first and a net positive defender. Reggie is&hellip; neither.</p>

<p>Word on the street is Malone will stagger Mike with the bench to run a lineup of: Westbrook/Strawther/Watson/ MPJ/ Saric.</p>

<p>Just westbrook surrounded by shooters and Watson roaming the Baseline for dunks, let WB drive and kick. I think it&rsquo;s pretty clear upgrade, not from being bullish on WB, but from how terrible Reggie was. Going from a -5 to a 0  so to speak is still massive. The Nuggets had a 62 win pace last season when Murray was healthy and it had less to do with Murray playing well than with Reggie not being on the court as much LMAO</p>

<p>Saric is going to be great in the system because it lets Denver play a similar style with Jok off or on the court. They had that with Boogie and he looked amazing. I think Dario is perfectly suited for the role, Denver had been trying to get him on the team at the trade deadline last year. He is going to thrive and there are rumors we may see some twin towers lineups with Jokic and Saric playing together.</p>

<p>Agree on the shooting. The one issue that could sink Denver is the shooting. Guys like Hunter Tyson and Trey Alexander may see minutes at the 9th/10th man just because they are reliable shooters. Same time, MPJ is the best shooter in the NBA outside of Curry, Jamal had his best shooting season last year, Saric is reliable, Strawther has looked great his whole life from distance, Braun was 42% above the break last year, Jokic and Saric are positive shooting bigs, ect. The trio of Watson/Gordon/Westbrook really just needs one guy to hit 35% for it to not be a massive problem but whether or not that happens feels iffy at best.</p>

<p>But the GM has said if he sees an issue, they are trading for shooting. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see a trade for another guard (or just Waive one of the deep bench guys and pickup someone in the buyout market).</p>

      <label for="lrgzujh" class="commentText"><p>Yeah your points about replacing Reggie with Westbrook and having Saric play that playmaking Center role off the bench are, to me, the scenario where these moves work out best for the Nuggs. I could definitely see it happening. Not going to lie, at this moment (before seeing them play regular season minutes of course), that Russ/Strawther/Watson/MPJ/Saric lineup looks&hellip;.. not great to me. But again, havent seen it in real action yet.</p>

<p>100%, and end of the day this is why this whole conversation has a lot of people (including me) getting ahead of themselves. And just to reiterate, I&rsquo;m not at all saying the team has markably gotten <strong>worse</strong>. I&rsquo;m just not sold that the team has gotten <strong>better</strong>, given how it looks at this moment. And my comment was mainly just me observing at how far apart predictions are for people with this Nuggets roster.</p>

<p>But even an offseason wash has the Nuggs in ~55 win territory. And to your comment I can definitely see a scenario where the Westbrook and Saric adds, plus the development of the young guys, pays off big.</p>

<p>He isn&rsquo;t either of those things. Unless you think standing around watching the ball while his man scores by cutting backdoor is a positive. Or his man getting an open shot because he decided to gamble for steals.</p>

      <label for="lrhh7t0" class="commentText"><p>The idea that westbrook is a worse defender than half dead Reggie Jackson is laughable. Half the people in this thread could give Reggie a bucket.</p>

<p>Lebron is unable to play a different style of basketball other than 4 or 5 out drive and kick. Its why he had Chris Bosh and Kevin Love shooting 3s for a decade. Obviously westbrook will look like shit playing with him, because NO ONE can be pass first and play with Lebron. In Denver he is expected to make the Nuggets bench go from 29th in the NBA to about 20th. That&rsquo;s all it takes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never known all Denver&rsquo;s rivals had such high opinions of Reggie before we signed WB LMAO</p>

I think he can maybe fit into a lineup trying to play with a lot of pace and shooters but ultimately I don&rsquo;t really think that he&rsquo;s playing real winning basketball anymore now that he has slowed down a bit. He could be a rotation player but you&rsquo;d need a really specific bench to let him lead and basically attack the other team&rsquo;s rotations with but he really can&rsquo;t be out there against starting lineups without getting exposed. It&rsquo;s really hard to justify building around a player at that position in their careers so he kinda needs to just accidentally land on the right team</p>

<p>Reminder that when guarded by CB for 100 possessions in the playoffs, Anthony Edwards averaged 9.7 points per 36 on 51% TS. Braun puts big guards in prison</p>

<p>Ja is back this year. And Kyrie is pretty much the textbook definition of a slippery guard.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re also overrating Westbrook, but that happens every time he joins a new team. You&rsquo;ll just have to find out in time, like folks here in LA did. But the real Russ always inevitably shows up, and he&rsquo;s not even a good bench player.</p>

<p>This is pretty much where I’m at and the main reason I struggle to hop on the “better” train at the moment. Your take is pretty much what I would’ve expected to be the consensus from the fanbase, which is why I just find it interesting how far apart some opinions on your offseason moves are.

<p>In terms of talent, I don&rsquo;t think losing Bruce Brown or KCP matters that much in terms of the playoffs, because in the playoffs what matters is your top 5 guys and that&rsquo;s relatively in tact.  The Nuggets won the title in 2023 with relatively no bench - they killed people with their starting lineup.  That hasn&rsquo;t changed.  Winning the the title is what made people believe that Bruce Brown and Braun were a good bench, but prior to the start of the season they were just as questionable as the bench is now.</p>

<p>The reality is the nuggets dont have any other options. We have essentially 3 max deal players (Murray, MPJ, and Jokic) and Gordon eats up the rest of the cap.  We have to make due with scraps, and that&rsquo;s what the rest of the roster is. But that top 4 is good enough to win a title and that&rsquo;s all that matters.  When people are arguing your 6th option being iffy is what worries you, the team is really good.</p>

      <label for="lrgnkia" class="commentText"><p>Strawther is definitely an interesting part of the equation that I forgot to mention. Braun/Watson/Strawther are all intriguing young players that any team would be excited to have. My question is how they play in their roles this upcoming season. The Jokic/Murray/Gordon/MPJ grouping is already proven and we know they will be great. The rest of the roster is where I personally am uncertain.</p>

      <label for="lrh4c7n" class="commentText"><p>Being uncertain is all fine and reasonable. It&rsquo;s when people act like there&rsquo;s no scenario at all we can be better than last year that irks me.</p>

<p>I would argue that players who were cold in the playoffs last year simply regressing to their mean gives us an avenue to be better in of itself, let alone Westbrook/Saric giving our bench some PREVIOUSLY NON-EXISTENT playmaking and improvement of young players being possibilities </p>

      <label for="lrg38ux" class="commentText"><p>I think the discourse around the loss of KCP has gotten kind of ridiculous. KCP played his role well and is a good player but i’ve watched Jokic carry a team of end of bench guys to 48 wins and the Nuggets set a franchise record for wins last year despite murray missing almost 30 games.</p>

<p>The idea the nuggets title odds fall off a cliff because KCP left doesn’t make sense me. he’s not an all star caliber in his prime, he’s a role player well into his 30s. I’ve always viewed Braun as an eventual KCP replacement, it just happened a year sooner than I expected.</p>

      <label for="lrh8bex" class="commentText"><p>The volume difference between KCP and Braun last year per 36 was 1 3pa per game.  We aren&rsquo;t talking him having to quadruple his shots.  He will also get to benefit from the spacing of the starters, which is massively better than what last years bench provided.  It is an unknown until we see it, but it is pretty unlikely his % drops significantly taking 1-2 extra shots a game.</p>

      <label for="lrgecbc" class="commentText"><p>between injuries and unreliable players, the team basically had a 7-man rotation in the playoffs &ndash; the big 4 of Murray/MPJ/AG/Jokic, and then 3 more guards in KCP/Reggie Jackson/Braun (Peyton Watson&rsquo;s role diminished greatly in the Minnesota series in particular.)  They ran out of gas because the big 4 were just worn down.</p>

<p>The team got rid of KCP (who is a great role player) and Reggie Jackson (who is booty), and then brought in Westbrook and Saric, which on paper is a downgrade &ndash; but there&rsquo;s also every expectation that Strawther and Vlatko will be healthy this year, which means now it&rsquo;s the big 4 + Braun starting, and a bench of Westbrook/Strawther/PWat/Vlatko/Saric which is just much less likely to be a total trash bench that&rsquo;s constantly blowing 15+ point leads and constantly making the starters have to play extra minutes.  It&rsquo;s a more balanced bench, and that could at least possibly make up for the loss of super 5th man KCP, even if Braun doesn&rsquo;t take much of a leap this year.</p>

KCP is irrelevant in terms of that series or the prior one, Braun is a better defender anyway at this stage and KCP is not worth 60 some odd mill over 3 years. Russ helps them certainly he’s a much more impactful player than Jackson and has higher highs than KCP but lower lows.</p>

      <label for="lrfxuac" class="commentText"><p>KCP was an instrumental part of that team&rsquo;s success, he is more than just a typical 3-D player. He is actually a pretty good shooter from mid range and his off ball actions really did open up the offense. Losing your best perimeter defender who is a 30+ mpg playoff player and replacing him with one of the most inneficient players in the league is a pretty big downgrade.</p>

<p>The best hope that the Nuggets have is to pray that Braun is capable of being a starting caliber 2 guard who can play 30+ minutes come playoff time. This idea that you can combine the production of Braun + Russ + Strawter to replace KCP is foolish. That&rsquo;s not how basketball works, and as a Mavs fan who lived through the fanbase drinking the Dinwiddie + Wood &amp;gt; Brunson copium, I know delusion when I see it.</p>

      <label for="lrfzprf" class="commentText"><p>I’m confused why it’s foolish in your last point? Braun is a better defender and rebounder than KCP, he isn’t a better shooter I agree altho this is his third year let’s see if there’s a jump there. Russ is a much more impactful player than Jackson and will be great for the playmaking the nuggets need, Strawther is a nice scorer I could see scoring around 8-12 ppg I don’t think that’s crazy to say he can shoot and has a good floater game.</p>

<p>KCP was not getting younger either he was worse compared to the 2023 season and I’m not advocating for him to get paid 20 some odd million when he’s the least impactful player of that starting 5 in den. They beat the wolves if Murray is as good as he was in 2023 with or without KCP. He really isn’t all that you guys are making him out to be compared to jokic, Murray, Gordon and MPJ far better players.</p>

      <label for="lrg1nj9" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not saying Braun being an adequete replacement to KCP is totally out of the quesiton, but KCP is a far, far better shooter than Braun is. Braun has shown very little promise of being anything more than a spot up shooter who needs space to be effective. Not all 3 point shooters are created equally, KCP is light years agead of where Braun is or may ever be as a shooter.</p>

<p>If Braun doesn&rsquo;t efficiently increase his 3 point diet, I think the Nuggets will struggle to play with 2 non dependable shooters in Gordon &amp; Braun. This was a Mavs weakness that bit us in the finals with PJ &amp; DJJ.</p>

<p>Biggest thing is KAT leaving. OKC is the only team that can use the big + rim protector combo</p>

The reason they gave those contracts is because they know they aren&rsquo;t gonna be the one paying. Magic Johnson voice &ldquo;they ain&rsquo;t gonna be there).</p>

<p>And the new owners are gonna be capped to improve the team for seasons. It&rsquo;s not a good situation for a team that isn&rsquo;t guaranteed a finals appearance. And are chances only take a small dip with losing KCP. Especially since he couldn&rsquo;t shoot nor defend when it mattered.</p>

He didn’t rebound, didn’t pass, shot well from 3 but took only a few shots per game and in most games, he had no offensive impact. His defense was great, but he was and is replaceable.</p>
