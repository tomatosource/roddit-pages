</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Not a Kings fan but Boogie is still one of my favorite players of all time and I hate the way his career turned out.</p>

<p>I still think a return of Hield, Tyreke, Galloway (who were both waived iirc) and the 10th pick traded to Portland is one of the worst returns ive ever seen for a player like Cousins.</p>

<p>Just wondering if there were better offers why were they not taken?, It doesnt surprise me considering Vivek is the worst Gm in the league (no offence)</p>

<p>I remember hearing a couple of rumours throughout that season. Boogie to Orlando for Vucevic and Fournier. Boogie to Detroit for Andre Drummond and a Suns package I cant rememer what the exact details were.</p>

<p>Just wondering if there were better options for the Kings and Boogie at the time? And if so where and what for? I think even if he stayed healthy in New Orleans AD was going to jump ship eventually anyway.</p>

<p>Also feel free to mention any teams you would have liked to see Boogie traded to. I would have loved if Phoenix paired him with Devin Booker I also think Miami could have been a great landing spot for him at the time.</p>

      <label for="llfjgbd" class="commentText"><p>That and he was an unrestricted free agent the following season so said attitude made him a headache and a potential rental.  In a Western Conference where the KD Warriors would walk to their first ring 16-1&hellip;yeah, not hard to see why the offers weren&rsquo;t better</p>

<p>Kings still screwed up their side of the trade unless you want to pretend the Sabonis trade that moved Hield didn&rsquo;t have Tyrese Haliburton in it for salary purposes</p>

      <label for="llfdvld" class="commentText"><p>Vlade divac even said in the post trade conference that he had a better offer a couple days before. However without the hindsight of his career Buddy was the 6th pick that year and had plenty of upside. So basically the return was a player just picked 6th and a pick that ended up 10th. Not a good return but still not insanely small. At the end of the day it’s good we didn’t give demarcus the super max that we would have given him even if he wasn’t traded. Even if he never gets injured he’s probably never worth that contract even though I do think people who didn’t watch him underrate him nowadays.</p>

<p>#6 and #10 for a Boogie in his contract year (+17 games) is pretty fine, considering how Boogie&rsquo;s career went after that this was probably one of the best moves Vivek ever did. Maybe they could have gotten a little more but there&rsquo;s a timeline where the Kings don&rsquo;t trade Boogie, he walks and stays healthy or the Kings supermax him and he gets injured</p>

<p>This is complete hindsight bias, Vucevic in 2017 wasn&rsquo;t half the player he became over the next 5 years and Fournier was always projected as a decent role player or above-average scorer on a bad team</p>

<p>Vuc was already the key piece in the Dwight trade more than 3 years prior that worked out so well for your franchise.</p>

      <label for="llfgaee" class="commentText"><p>Yes it was Hield in his rookie year, not the 6th and 10th picks. If Boogie stayed healthy its a terrible return. You can hardly call that hindsight bias considering nobody knew Cousins would be signing minimum deals only a handful of years later.</p>
