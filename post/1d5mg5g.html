      <label for="l6o83iz" class="commentText"><p>Yup, but i&rsquo;m talking about the entire playoffs. Kyrie really struggled against OKC, and went off against a middling Clippers defense after Kawhi went down. And without Kawhi, their defense is basically as bad as Indys. He was definitely good against the Wolves though</p>

<p>Brown obviously faced worse defenses overall, but expectantly he hasn&rsquo;t had a below average, inefficient series. I think that focus on the Cs schedule has let how efficient he has been slip through the cracks</p>

      <label for="l6n97zt" class="commentText"><p>I think Brown vs Kyrie is also debatable.  No doubt Brown has way more trade value (less off court issues and 5 years younger), but “better player right now” is debatable IMO.  Brown is better on D, bigger/stronger, more explosive athletically, but Kyrie has a massively better handle, is a much better passer, is a better shooter, and comes up bigger in clutch moments.  I’d personally take Kyrie, but you could go either way.</p>

<p>Agreed the whole article/ranking is a very reasonable take.</p>

      <label for="l6o8i43" class="commentText"><p>My major problem is ranking these players 1-15 does not truly quantify how good the players are in relation with each other. For example, what is the gap between player 1 and 2, is this gap bigger than the difference between player 4 and 5?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I think most people would say the best player is Luka and would rank him 98-99 (let’s be conservative and give him a 98.</p></li>

<li><p>Most people would rank Tatum between 95-96 (let’s be conservative and give him a 95.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>3 and 4) Brown and Kyrie are debatable where they would score someone 91-92. Kyrie is interesting because he plays like a 85 for 2 quarters then becomes a 98 for the last 2 quarters.</p>

<p>5-7) rest of Boston’s starting line up would range from 87-91. In MY opinion, porzingis has the highest peak out of the remaining 3 and can be rated even higher than Brown at times, but suffers from inconsistency (mostly due to untimely injuries). Either way all 3 are fringe all star caliber players.</p>

<p>8-11) Lively, PJ, DJJ and Horford range from 82 to 85. There is a world in which Lively is the 5th best player this series. While I would not count on it, his chemistry with Luka is undeniable and is a x-factor Boston needs to figure out if they want to win this series. His ability to switch on the perimeter, protect the paint, and be a lob threat at any time can change the series especially IF porzingis is not fully healthy.</p>

<p>The other 4 to 7 players in this series (not listed above) can make a difference this series, but it is hard to properly rank them until we see how effective the players before them are. Is Gafford even playable this series if Porzingis is healthy? Is Boston’s bench really that much better than Josh Green?</p>

<p>At the end of the day, there is a reason Boston is the heavy Vegas favorite, but Luka is by far and away the best player and the teams are close enough where you can see Luka closing out the series in 6 or 7 especially is Porzingis is not fully healthy.</p>

<p>I would say Tatum or Brown can be 1 any given night. Luka and Kyrie can also be 1 any given night.</p>

<p>It’s the Celtics players outside their top dogs that’s  just extremely problematic. Even without KP they roflstomped their way through the East.</p>

<p>Luka is also slowly recovering from injury while playing through the west. So hopefully we get supernova Luka back for the Celtics.</p>

<p>The magic of their playoff run is that they can both be #1 throughout the game.  Luka is much less ball dominant than I expected these playoffs.</p>

      <label for="l6o13xw" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not sure how many mavs games you&rsquo;ve watched, but Luka is the best on the team at protecting the ball while dribbling. He rarely gets it stolen. His turnovers come almost entirely from passes. Kyrie, who many consider to have the best handles in the league or at least on the team, lost the ball several times in each round by trying to be too tricky or dribbling through too much traffic. If you want the mavs to score, the best bet is to have luka dribble it down and then either shoot or pass. That is why the numbers reflect his high usage- the ball gets down the court with him. Anyone else on the team has a much higher chance to lose the ball before we even get to begin an offensive set. Hardy has come a long way (obviously some mentoring going on from Kyrie and Shamgod), but he still is prone to losing it. He has been exceptionally better at passing the ball than during the regular season, which I think mostly comes from the types of minutes he&rsquo;s playing. Green is undersized and sometimes moves quicker than the ball. Exum hasn&rsquo;t been able to knock down shots (if he even takes them) so he&rsquo;s not playing much. THJ isn&rsquo;t playing much because of his lack of defense and not knocking down enough shots. PJ can drive to the rack, but that&rsquo;s not his best utilization. DJJ can drive too, but he has a hard time getting through the physicality of the defense - he is tough though, just he is playing with a difficult hand.</p>

That said, the daylight in each case is small enough that it’s an any-given-night situation, and the Celtics are obviously the stronger roster top to bottom.</p>

His perimeter defense has also been exploited multiple times, he’s clearly lost a step there and that’s only going to be magnified against Kyrie and Luka.</p>

      <label for="l6ncclz" class="commentText"><p>He’s shot well from 3. Basically had two bad shooting games in Cleveland and has been 40% since. He also showed you can’t leave him open because he can easily hit 6-7 threes in a game when you do.</p>

<p>His perimeter defense has been exploited but he’s also proven he can do it in spurts. He’s not going to be constantly switched onto Luka on Kyrie, they’ll still play a lot of drop against them as well. Additionally he’ll likely be on DJJ, not the C, so the guards getting over screens won’t be as difficult if they want to switch Al onto one of them.</p>

Definitely seemed like as the game went on it became more of an issue, but shouldn&rsquo;t when he&rsquo;s playing 15-20 minutes instead of 30+. Also Luka being a lot slower than the Pacers guards will help as well, but obviously that doesn&rsquo;t mean Luka won&rsquo;t still score over the top.</p>

      <label for="l6mx8ei" class="commentText"><p>That’s not how this works though lol. You can’t say 24 minutes of two players is better than 30 minutes of another. Jrue and Dwhite together are better than Kyrie but that’s not an argument anyone would make even if they share the court together or not.</p>

<p>Also, Gafford is much much worse than Al and Al is similar to Lively. If Al could play 48 he’d be much more valuable and much better so I don’t like this take. Also if you take 30 minutes of Al and add in 18 of KP when Al isn’t on the court they’re MILES ahead so it’s not a real comp.</p>

<p>There’s also a MASSIVE difference between KP/Jrue/White and any role player on the mavs. Outside of Luka and Kyrie, not one of the Mavs 3-5 best players would start for the Celtics. On top of that, it’s pretty clear that Al is in a similar realm as PJ/Lively. You can argue who you prefer but they’re relatively similar skill levels and Al is the Celtics 6th man whereas that’s the 3rd/4th best players.</p>

<p>Tatum could easily outplay him four games in a row.  Let’s mention how Tatum defensively alone is an extremely valuable player, then with near identical offensive output, Tatum is pretty clearly capable of being better than him any given night.</p>

<p>The childish belief that the variance between players is so great just adds to the argument that basketball fans know the least about the sport they talk about</p>

      <label for="l6ogfba" class="commentText"><p>This was my takeaway. I think the top 5 is kind of locked in (if we are talking about potential and not actual playoff experience since then I think KP drops below some of the other C&rsquo;s) and they can all shift around depending on the night. I&rsquo;m fine with a bit of homecooking from the list though, the Celtics have had more productive roleplayers but their counterparts on the Mavs have had explosive performances and were able to keep the Mavs going through a brutal path to the Finals. I do think the gap between Luka and Tatum is not exactly small however. Tatum is going to get a 35-40 point game out of this series but I expect 3-4 other C&rsquo;s players to be doing more than carrying their own weight over 6-7 games whereas we win this series purely based on Luka&rsquo;s performance. A TWolves game 4 box score from Luka on 2-3 nights is basically the deathknell.</p>

      <label for="l6om7cp" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I think your last piece is super important and not something a lot of people are talking about. Luka is certainly the best player in the series, but he needs to play like the best player in the series, and nba, every night. If he doesn’t, it’s not likely the mavs win that given game and even if he does it by no means implied a mavs win.</p>

<p>Luka will need to be on his A game this whole series 100%</p>

<p>I’m in the majority who think Horford is too high, I had him 11th behind PJ, DJJ, and Lively.</p>

<p>I take Kyrie over Brown by a hair.</p>

<p>I’m high on PJ Washington; I had him 8th behind Jrue, but I think PJ/Lively/DJJ are close.</p>

<p>I liked Dallas’ chances this series, but when you lay it out like this and the Celtics have 5 of the top 7, gonna be tough. On the other hand you can say each team has 5 of the top 10 if that makes you feel better as a Dallas backer.</p>

<p>I think the series is just gonna come down to the gap between Luka and everyone else.</p>

If a TX based pub made the changes you suggested I wouldn&rsquo;t think anyone should clown on it. These are two very, very good teams with the C&rsquo;s being <em>generally</em> more well-rounded with the Mavs having the consensus number one by a margin and Kyrie/the Mavs RP&rsquo;s being streaky and explosive.</p>

Has value as a floor spacer by just being out there and can get buckets here and there in the post.  Dude shot over 40% on threes the past two years.  That’s elite.  Gafford and lively to a lesser extent are shining because of Luka.  They are comparatively less skilled on their own.  They can defend but won’t be able to sit in the paint this series because pretty much every player in the Celtics top eight can shoot.</p>

      <label for="l6mhvhv" class="commentText"><p>Looking at the comments so far and this is going to be a fun series. I have been rooting for the mavs throughout the playoffs, and I see the same common themes that I am seeing with the Boston series.</p>

<ul>
<li>People think Luka is a liability on defense</li>
<li>People are underestimating Kyrie. IMO he couldn’t be playing his role any better. He is picking his moments just right and letting Luka or PJ cook, and make his shots when needed</li>
<li>Mavs can defend the 3, and Celtics are making the most of those in the league</li>
<li>Luka and Kyrie can make shots against anyone in the league. Every series it’s the same, team X has elite wing defender Y. And yet here the mavs are.</li>
</ul>

<p>Kyries 23 points per game are not telling the full story. There have been a few games where it is unbelievable how hot he gets. But because he plays alongside Luka, he’ll only go off for 1 quarter or so.</p>

<p>It feels to me like the mavs have 2 players who can put up 50-60 points in efficient shooting without relying on the refs whistle. They can go off. The Celtics are all around the deeper and more talented team, but I think the mavs can get it done and will surprise a lot of fans, just like they did in the OKC and Minnesota series</p>

<p>Edit: „couldn’t“ not „could“ for Kyrie playing his role</p>

<p>There definitely was some outliers in the playoffs, like that one game where the clippers couldn’t miss (I think that was the game where Luke picked up 3 quick fouls and then didn’t play D), and then that game where Naz Reid was on fire.</p>

<p>Let’s see, but if they come in with the game plan to take away the 3 from Boston, they are capable</p>

I’m not saying they won’t defend the 3 well, I’m just saying it’s yet to be proven, and I think Porzingis and Horford will really test Dallas’ defense in the Lively/Gafford minutes. You can’t give up the same shots to those two that they did to Chet and Jaylin Williams.</p>

      <label for="l6nb91y" class="commentText"><p>I think you have some good points but the Celtics aren&rsquo;t just wing defender X. They have two elite (all defense) guards and Tatum and Brown are both on the shortlist for top wing defenders if they get switched. I 100% agree Luka is going to get his points but Jrue and White will make him work. Luka got like 30-40 in both matchups in the regular season but it didn&rsquo;t matter. On defense he might not be a liability but if he ends up spending a lot of energy defending it is going to affect him offensively. The real liability is Kyrie who Tatum has a history of switching onto and posting up. Assuming the Celtics get Zingus back it also gives them that inside game back that made them so deadly during the regular season so even if the Mavs sell out to stop the 3 it&rsquo;s not going to end well. It&rsquo;s going to be a great series. Respect the hell out of Lukas game.</p>

Even if Luka gets his points guarantee you Jrue will be a pest and force him into tougher shots than he would take vs 99% of the NBA.</p>

<p>People think Luka is a liability on defense</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Against the Celtics, he is. On a theoretical talent basis, Luka is a fine defender, but the issue he has is that he plays a high volume, effort based offensive style, so he needs to take possesions off ala LeBron. The Wolves are a low IQ team on offense, they let Luka get rest on most possessions because they weren&rsquo;t swinging the ball to get him switched into the action. With his less than stellar conditioning, he can&rsquo;t both carry an offense and also defend well on the majority of possessions. It&rsquo;s why the Celtics blew past him for free so many times when we played the Mavs this regular season.</p>

<p>Even the Post-ASB new look Mavs with a wicked good defense had 138 points hung on their head by the Celtics who shot basically at their season averages. A large part of that was Luka a) giving up 32 points as the primary defender and b) him needing help on so many possessions, leading to the pass first Celtics who have a minimum of 4 shooters at any given time generating free looks from 3 all game.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t expect to play the Wolves again. The Celtics are <em>not</em> going to let Luka stand around practicing his deep breathing for 20 seconds 2 out of 3 trips down the court. In both regular season games, they showed the willingness, ability, and intent to force him to expend the effort on defense all game. A 7 game series of that will not be easy on him.</p>

He&rsquo;s definitely in good shape now with how he&rsquo;s played recently (while also recovering from injury). However, he still has to exert so much effort on offense that I do think attacking him repeatedly will still tire him out and pay dividends on both ends.</p>

      <label for="l6nczt8" class="commentText"><p>There&rsquo;s basically no player in the NBA except for maybe a hypothetical 2019 Kawhi who can lead an offense and a defense. It&rsquo;s not that Luka&rsquo;s a bum for that fact, but it&rsquo;s still true. Based purely on the numbers and shooting splits, the Celtics have already had success attacking Luka in both games, and one of those was post ASB where they had their genuinely incredible defensive turnaround. The Mavs like to hide Luka on the weakside on a non-shooter so he can drop towards the paint and basically take the possession off while still having time to recover if said non-shooter drives. There&rsquo;s genuinely not a single Celtic in our top 9 other than Luke Kornet who this would work against, and you will never see a possession of Luke standing in the corner waiting for a catch-and-shoot 3.</p>

      <label for="l6nyrrf" class="commentText"><p>That post ASB is being quoted by a lot of people as evidence of how the Celtics will do. Problem is that&rsquo;s during the stretch when kidd was experimenting with lineups and we went 1-5. It&rsquo;s not a game that will translate very well to this series.</p>

      <label for="l6o2pvl" class="commentText"><p>Oh God, you&rsquo;re right. How could I forget the famous Mavericks Celtics Weastern Conference Semi-Finals series 😭</p>

<p>The Mavericks haven&rsquo;t played any teams who are analogous to the Celtics on offense because, as much as haters on this sub might hate to hear it, these Celtics are one of one on offense. They have 1 non-shooter in their top <strong>nine</strong> players, and it&rsquo;s their 3rd string center. They posted the best ORTG in the history of basketball!</p>

<p>What team should I look to for analogies that the Mavs have played so far? The Wolves, who have 2 players who you can completely ignore on offense in their top 5? The basically underage Thunder, whose starting SG can&rsquo;t hit 3s with a gun to his head? The beat-up, old man Clippers?</p>

He stretches the floor and can have nights like the close out game against Celevend where he went for 22pts, 15rbs and 3blks while making 5-6 threes, lively just isn’t going to have games like that. But you’ll also get games where Al gets hunted on D and goes 0-7 from three, whereas lively always seems to do what is expected of him. It’s a hard comp</p>

      <label for="l6nrllq" class="commentText"><p>In a vacuum, Al better than both of those dudes.  More skills on offense and still very solid defensively.  Has value as a floor spacer by just being out there and can get buckets here and there in the post.  Dude shot over 40% on threes the past two years.  That’s elite.</p>

<p>Gafford and lively to a lesser extent are shining because of Luka.  They are comparatively less skilled on their own.  They can defend but won’t be able to sit in the paint this series because pretty much every player in the Celtics top eight can shoot.</p>

<p>The Celtics may or may not have a better defense than the Wolves, but they have a vastly superior offense.  I think the Mavs will score well, but I don&rsquo;t think they can keep up with the Celtics without higher variance from both teams in opposite directions.</p>

      <label for="l6mu9yy" class="commentText"><p>Interesting list, Brown and Kyrie are interchangeable on the eyes of who you ask and should be regarded as a tier of their own, not one strictly better because they fit and play unique roles on their teams not straight comparable 1 on 1  (because by numbers the list is correct and Brown has performed better there) , Al is the most shocking placement of this list, Lively and PJ have played more consistent and showed better these playoffs, I’ll say this tho Al has been the better player on located moments of the games (defensively) and has shoot the 3 better, when he locks in he is the better defender but the timing of these spurs is way more limited due to his age (note how he closed all games against Pacers), either way solid list and the series is gonna be closer than the average fan thinks of it.</p>

If Luka and Kyrie are able to switch on him, they’re going to feast. If Horford is on Lively, Washington, or DJJ, I think it’s mostly ok. If not, they may play him off the court.</p>

Luka is the best player in the world and Kyrie is unguardable. That creates more problems for the Celtics than the Celtics do for the Mavs by having 2 top 10 players and some other really solid borderline all-star types.</p>

<p>I think the way Luka breaks down defenses is demoralizing and the Mavs defense has been fantastic. I might be drunk on the kool-aide though.</p>

<p>oh prepare for Lively/Gafford outrun those 2 guys and make demoralizing easy buckets after easy buckets then. that will be epitome of &ldquo;2pts is not just 2pts&rdquo;. especially if Al/KP playing as shooter with Gaff/Lively defending, meaning our springy fast centers already on 3pt line if we can secure the rebound</p>

<p>the game plan will be : bait Tatum as playmaker more, Jrue as shooter more, and make their centers shoot 3s A LOT (lower Tatum/Brown shot attempts). cant game plan for everyone because they are that talented</p>

This is because he&rsquo;s a master at evading contact and getting really tough shots up that no one else in the league could - which takes immense skill - but, unfortunately, doesn&rsquo;t actually provide much value. This is because avoiding contact means you don&rsquo;t get free throws, and also means you have to take those aforementioned high degree of difficulty shots</p>

<p>All of this results in a genuinely incredible shotmaker in Kyrie only having so-so efficiency metrics (for example, his true shooting this year was effectively identical to Tatum&rsquo;s, and many people would say Tatum is a chucker). This gives him less of an offensive edge than your eyes would suggest, and from there JB&rsquo;s defensive value makes up the gap</p>

      <label for="l6nb0i9" class="commentText"><p>I don’t mind at all! I’m honestly a tad frustrated that I got downvoted when I invited discussion, and I really appreciate this!</p>

<p>Kyrie is a better offensive player, he scored more points, more efficiently, and of course has more assists/a better playmaker</p>

<p>Jaylen is a better defender (though I will say, when locked in this playoffs Kyrie’s defense has not been a liability) I think they’re very close</p>

      <label for="l6nc5mf" class="commentText"><p>One other thing to keep in mind: JB is better than his stats would suggest (purely from a volume standpoint). He scored about 4 more points per game last year but if you watch him play, he&rsquo;s clearly a better player this year. The reason for the dropoff is because the Celtics added two more scoring threats to the team (Jrue and KP) without removing any (Smart, Rob, Grant, and Brogdon left. The only guy there that actually scores is Brogdon, but he was replaced with Pritchard who is also score-first). So, JB&rsquo;s volume stats are lower than they would be if he swapped teams with Kyrie for example because of his relatively limited opportunities</p>

<p>You can see this same effect with Tatum as well. Down 3 ppg from last year with no meaningful change in efficiency</p>

      <label for="l6p6ds9" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m a notorious doomer when it comes to sports being a Seattle sports fan (Mavs are dad&rsquo;s team I picked up after Sonics left) so I&rsquo;m not sure. If you asked me right after the WCF I&rsquo;d say 95-5 Mavs but right now I&rsquo;m at a solid 55-45. It can&rsquo;t be overstated how solid Celtics, shit, top 7 or 8 players are. Realistically speaking I see it going at least to game 6 regardless of who actually wins. I think Mavs take Game 1 in TD then have to turn up for their home games to keep up cause Boston is gonna be playing pissed if they drop a home game early.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s 100% the showdown between Heliocentric and more balanced, spread offenses for the ages. If Luka has a Wolves Game 4 more than once Kyrie and the combination of PJ/Lively/Gafford are going to need to play absolutely lights out 20 points a piece and still could easily lose 130-100</p>

<p>Look at when he played Shai, there&rsquo;s pretty wide gap when Shai iso him. But that wingspan still bother Shai getting a good look</p>

      <label for="l6nequy" class="commentText"><p>This series reminds me a lot of the 2016 NBA finals just with worse teams. In that series the warriors were clearly the better team from top to bottom, but the Cavs had the best player in the world, and Kyrie, who was the second best player on the court. The series was ultimately defined by Kyrie and LeBron playing at a historically good level that was too much to overcome for the much deeper warriors. Steph curry also did not play up to his MVP level self in that series which let the Cavs win 3 straight.</p>

<p>The same can happen this series. If Luka and Kyrie play at an elite level the whole series, I think they have a chance. But the Celtics should be favored. Tatum needs to keep his foot on the gas the whole series and play like a top 5 player in the league.</p>

      <label for="l6n98as" class="commentText"><p>Personally I think it ends up being:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Luka</p></li>

<li><p>Tatum</p></li>

<li><p>Brown</p></li>

<li><p>Kyrie</p></li>

<li><p>Jrue</p></li>

<li><p>White</p></li>

<li><p>Lively</p></li>

<li><p>Porzingis</p></li>

<li><p>Washington</p></li>

<li><p>Derrick Jones Jr.</p></li>

<li><p>Gafford</p></li>

<li><p>Horford</p></li>

<li><p>Pritchard</p></li>

<li><p>Green</p></li>

<li><p>Hauser</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I think Mavs take it based on our bigs giving the Cs more trouble inside than their bigs give us outside&hellip;</p>

      <label for="l6nbe0p" class="commentText"><p>Not bad. Porzingis is the wild card. If fully healthy, he&rsquo;s clearly 5th. If not, 8 seems about right</p>
