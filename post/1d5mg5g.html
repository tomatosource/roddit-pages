      <label for="l6o83iz" class="commentText"><p>Yup, but i&rsquo;m talking about the entire playoffs. Kyrie really struggled against OKC, and went off against a middling Clippers defense after Kawhi went down. And without Kawhi, their defense is basically as bad as Indys. He was definitely good against the Wolves though</p>

<p>Brown obviously faced worse defenses overall, but expectantly he hasn&rsquo;t had a below average, inefficient series. I think that focus on the Cs schedule has let how efficient he has been slip through the cracks</p>

      <label for="l6n97zt" class="commentText"><p>I think Brown vs Kyrie is also debatable.  No doubt Brown has way more trade value (less off court issues and 5 years younger), but “better player right now” is debatable IMO.  Brown is better on D, bigger/stronger, more explosive athletically, but Kyrie has a massively better handle, is a much better passer, is a better shooter, and comes up bigger in clutch moments.  I’d personally take Kyrie, but you could go either way.</p>

<p>Agreed the whole article/ranking is a very reasonable take.</p>

      <label for="l6o8i43" class="commentText"><p>My major problem is ranking these players 1-15 does not truly quantify how good the players are in relation with each other. For example, what is the gap between player 1 and 2, is this gap bigger than the difference between player 4 and 5?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I think most people would say the best player is Luka and would rank him 98-99 (let’s be conservative and give him a 98.</p></li>

<li><p>Most people would rank Tatum between 95-96 (let’s be conservative and give him a 95.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>3 and 4) Brown and Kyrie are debatable where they would score someone 91-92. Kyrie is interesting because he plays like a 85 for 2 quarters then becomes a 98 for the last 2 quarters.</p>

<p>5-7) rest of Boston’s starting line up would range from 87-91. In MY opinion, porzingis has the highest peak out of the remaining 3 and can be rated even higher than Brown at times, but suffers from inconsistency (mostly due to untimely injuries). Either way all 3 are fringe all star caliber players.</p>

<p>8-11) Lively, PJ, DJJ and Horford range from 82 to 85. There is a world in which Lively is the 5th best player this series. While I would not count on it, his chemistry with Luka is undeniable and is a x-factor Boston needs to figure out if they want to win this series. His ability to switch on the perimeter, protect the paint, and be a lob threat at any time can change the series especially IF porzingis is not fully healthy.</p>

<p>The other 4 to 7 players in this series (not listed above) can make a difference this series, but it is hard to properly rank them until we see how effective the players before them are. Is Gafford even playable this series if Porzingis is healthy? Is Boston’s bench really that much better than Josh Green?</p>

<p>At the end of the day, there is a reason Boston is the heavy Vegas favorite, but Luka is by far and away the best player and the teams are close enough where you can see Luka closing out the series in 6 or 7 especially is Porzingis is not fully healthy.</p>

      <label for="l6nv2yf" class="commentText"><p>Horford still makes plays, but I don&rsquo;t see him close to the player he used to be.  I think the Celtics need to move on from him, because his physical abilities are going to reach their end really quickly.  He&rsquo;s using up the last of his time and he deserves great respect for how much he&rsquo;s achieving at the end of his career.</p>

<p>I am rooting for the Mavs, but I would love to see Horford get a ring.</p>

<p>Tatum I don&rsquo;t think deserves one yet.  He needs to find a new level to his game to impose his will at crunch time.  Maybe this is the series where he grabs the title by the balls.  I know Luka and Kyrie are ready to do so, but is Tatum as well?</p>

<p>Tatum, as much as anyone, is helped by the stat inflation of a faster game with more possessions.  I don&rsquo;t care about his stats &ndash; I want to see him down one with a minute left in the game and for him to refuse anything but getting to the rim for an and-one.  That is what superstars who win titles do.</p>

Also want to see how Gafford and Lively handle having to cover so much more ground, as well as how the Dallas guards handle him on the perimeter.  I guess they body him to prevent him getting shots off.</p>

<p>I would say Tatum or Brown can be 1 any given night. Luka and Kyrie can also be 1 any given night.</p>

<p>It’s the Celtics players outside their top dogs that’s  just extremely problematic. Even without KP they roflstomped their way through the East.</p>

<p>Luka is also slowly recovering from injury while playing through the west. So hopefully we get supernova Luka back for the Celtics.</p>

<p>The magic of their playoff run is that they can both be #1 throughout the game.  Luka is much less ball dominant than I expected these playoffs.</p>

      <label for="l6o13xw" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not sure how many mavs games you&rsquo;ve watched, but Luka is the best on the team at protecting the ball while dribbling. He rarely gets it stolen. His turnovers come almost entirely from passes. Kyrie, who many consider to have the best handles in the league or at least on the team, lost the ball several times in each round by trying to be too tricky or dribbling through too much traffic. If you want the mavs to score, the best bet is to have luka dribble it down and then either shoot or pass. That is why the numbers reflect his high usage- the ball gets down the court with him. Anyone else on the team has a much higher chance to lose the ball before we even get to begin an offensive set. Hardy has come a long way (obviously some mentoring going on from Kyrie and Shamgod), but he still is prone to losing it. He has been exceptionally better at passing the ball than during the regular season, which I think mostly comes from the types of minutes he&rsquo;s playing. Green is undersized and sometimes moves quicker than the ball. Exum hasn&rsquo;t been able to knock down shots (if he even takes them) so he&rsquo;s not playing much. THJ isn&rsquo;t playing much because of his lack of defense and not knocking down enough shots. PJ can drive to the rack, but that&rsquo;s not his best utilization. DJJ can drive too, but he has a hard time getting through the physicality of the defense - he is tough though, just he is playing with a difficult hand.</p>

<p>His perimeter defense has been exploited but he’s also proven he can do it in spurts. He’s not going to be constantly switched onto Luka on Kyrie, they’ll still play a lot of drop against them as well. Additionally he’ll likely be on DJJ, not the C, so the guards getting over screens won’t be as difficult if they want to switch Al onto one of them.</p>

      <label for="l6nv8m8" class="commentText"><p>If you think Al would get played off the floor you haven’t really watched the Celtics. He’s not an elite defender but he’s certainly not terrible on the perimeter. Additionally, he’s not going to be on the centers, he’ll likely be on DJJ so then you’re needing your not great screeners to be setting the screen to get Al (which means the great perimeter defends on the Celtics can get around it). Additionally, it means Tatum is going to be planted in the paint with either Lively or Gafford to protect anything around the rim.</p>

<p>It’s just kinda illogical to assume he gets played off the court when literally nothing has showed that should be the case, including the regular season games.</p>

Jrue and Dwhite together are better than Kyrie but that’s not an argument anyone would make even if they share the court together or not.</p>

<p>Also, Gafford is much much worse than Al and Al is similar to Lively. If Al could play 48 he’d be much more valuable and much better so I don’t like this take. Also if you take 30 minutes of Al and add in 18 of KP when Al isn’t on the court they’re MILES ahead so it’s not a real comp.</p>

They’re 2 of the top 3 defensive guards in the NBA, both shoot &amp;gt;40% from 3, both have TS = 60%. Combine them and give them 48 full minutes and they’re better than Kyrie for certain, that’s what the other dude was arguing with Gafford and Lively. Too bad that’s not how basketball works and not how life works.</p>

Has value as a floor spacer by just being out there and can get buckets here and there in the post.  Dude shot over 40% on threes the past two years.  That’s elite.</p>

<p>Gafford and lively to a lesser extent are shining because of Luka.  They are comparatively less skilled on their own.  They can defend but won’t be able to sit in the paint this series because pretty much every player in the Celtics top eight can shoot.</p>

<p>There’s also a MASSIVE difference between KP/Jrue/White and any role player on the mavs. Outside of Luka and Kyrie, not one of the Mavs 3-5 best players would start for the Celtics. On top of that, it’s pretty clear that Al is in a similar realm as PJ/Lively. You can argue who you prefer but they’re relatively similar skill levels and Al is the Celtics 6th man whereas that’s the 3rd/4th best players.</p>

      <label for="l6nxx4x" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think it is. Tatum is a 3x all nba first teamer the past three seasons. Sure his shot has been down this playoffs but that’s really been the major problem. If he even hits at near his regular season clip I don’t think you realize how close the two will be. But alas only time will tell anyway</p>

      <label for="l6o1p5i" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, Tatum is great and I think his shot will come back in the series. This is more about just how good Luka is. He’s better at ever part of the game than Tatum except defense and again it’s not a slight at Tatum, we’re just talking about the best player in the league</p>

      <label for="l6nspxf" class="commentText"><p>Yep, but thinking about it league rankings doesn&rsquo;t make sense. The difference between Michael Jordan and Glen Rice(5th in MVP <sup>96</sup>&frasl;<sub>96</sub> was massive. The difference between Lebron James and tony parker/rajon rondo(6th/7th in MVP 2012) is huge.  The gap between Tatum and Luka is very similar to those examples.</p>

<p>At the end of the day the best player is going to have a much larger impact on the series then a 6th man horford or a jru holiday.</p>

      <label for="l6nvoy4" class="commentText"><p>Yes but Rondo/Parker/Glen rice aren’t 3x 1st team all nba players who have been too 6 in MVP voting 3 years in a row as well. Context is extremely important in looking at that.</p>

<p>Also I think you’re underestimating how important role players and overall starters are in the playoffs. If jrue gives the Celtics 18.5/7/6 with his elite defense on 59/42/100 splits on 73% TS, the mavs are in trouble. Sure he likely won’t but he literally did that in the last series. Same with D white and KP, either of those 3 can go off for a full series of 18-20 per game on elite efficiency.</p>

      <label for="l6mhvhv" class="commentText"><p>Looking at the comments so far and this is going to be a fun series. I have been rooting for the mavs throughout the playoffs, and I see the same common themes that I am seeing with the Boston series.</p>

<ul>
<li>People think Luka is a liability on defense</li>
<li>People are underestimating Kyrie. IMO he couldn’t be playing his role any better. He is picking his moments just right and letting Luka or PJ cook, and make his shots when needed</li>
<li>Mavs can defend the 3, and Celtics are making the most of those in the league</li>
<li>Luka and Kyrie can make shots against anyone in the league. Every series it’s the same, team X has elite wing defender Y. And yet here the mavs are.</li>
</ul>

<p>Kyries 23 points per game are not telling the full story. There have been a few games where it is unbelievable how hot he gets. But because he plays alongside Luka, he’ll only go off for 1 quarter or so.</p>

<p>It feels to me like the mavs have 2 players who can put up 50-60 points in efficient shooting without relying on the refs whistle. They can go off. The Celtics are all around the deeper and more talented team, but I think the mavs can get it done and will surprise a lot of fans, just like they did in the OKC and Minnesota series</p>

<p>Edit: „couldn’t“ not „could“ for Kyrie playing his role</p>

      <label for="l6mxfsa" class="commentText"><p>They were a different team the last 20 games of the season and into the playoffs.</p>

<p>There definitely was some outliers in the playoffs, like that one game where the clippers couldn’t miss (I think that was the game where Luke picked up 3 quick fouls and then didn’t play D), and then that game where Naz Reid was on fire.</p>

<p>Let’s see, but if they come in with the game plan to take away the 3 from Boston, they are capable</p>

      <label for="l6mz5mc" class="commentText"><p>I’m aware. But they were still 5th worst in the league post ASB in 3P defense. I’m not saying they won’t defend the 3 well, I’m just saying it’s yet to be proven, and I think Porzingis and Horford will really test Dallas’ defense in the Lively/Gafford minutes. You can’t give up the same shots to those two that they did to Chet and Jaylin Williams.</p>

      <label for="l6mx74q" class="commentText"><p>Are you looking at season long stats? It’s well established that the team changed a lot during the back half of the season and the rotations have been much better. They’re middle of the pack in the playoffs, similar to the Celtics, and better than any team the Celtics have played. And the teams they’ve played had a regular season 3P% rank of: 1, 3, and 6. So essentially they’ve played 3 of the 6 best three point shooting teams in the NBA and have them shooting equivalent to the 21st best shooting team.</p>

      <label for="l6n1ajv" class="commentText"><p>Season long, post asb, either way. And yes, the playoff stats have turned around and I’m not trying to diminish that, but I think Boston’s bigs present a larger issue on the perimeter than Minnesota, OKC, or the Clippers. You can’t come off anyone on the Celtics the way you can Rudy and Kyle Anderson, Jaylin Williams and Giddey, Zubac, etc. Those teams shot a high percentage but they weren’t high volume teams.</p>

<p>Again, not trying to downplay the defensive turnaround in Dallas. I just think the matchup will strain the bigs to the outside and it’ll be a decision of living with Horford and Porzingis taking 3s, or staying more attached and opening the paint a bit more, and I’ll be curious how Dallas plays it.</p>

      <label for="l6nb91y" class="commentText"><p>I think you have some good points but the Celtics aren&rsquo;t just wing defender X. They have two elite (all defense) guards and Tatum and Brown are both on the shortlist for top wing defenders if they get switched. I 100% agree Luka is going to get his points but Jrue and White will make him work. Luka got like 30-40 in both matchups in the regular season but it didn&rsquo;t matter. On defense he might not be a liability but if he ends up spending a lot of energy defending it is going to affect him offensively. The real liability is Kyrie who Tatum has a history of switching onto and posting up. Assuming the Celtics get Zingus back it also gives them that inside game back that made them so deadly during the regular season so even if the Mavs sell out to stop the 3 it&rsquo;s not going to end well. It&rsquo;s going to be a great series. Respect the hell out of Lukas game.</p>

<p>People think Luka is a liability on defense</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Against the Celtics, he is. On a theoretical talent basis, Luka is a fine defender, but the issue he has is that he plays a high volume, effort based offensive style, so he needs to take possesions off ala LeBron. The Wolves are a low IQ team on offense, they let Luka get rest on most possessions because they weren&rsquo;t swinging the ball to get him switched into the action. With his less than stellar conditioning, he can&rsquo;t both carry an offense and also defend well on the majority of possessions. It&rsquo;s why the Celtics blew past him for free so many times when we played the Mavs this regular season.</p>

<p>Even the Post-ASB new look Mavs with a wicked good defense had 138 points hung on their head by the Celtics who shot basically at their season averages. A large part of that was Luka a) giving up 32 points as the primary defender and b) him needing help on so many possessions, leading to the pass first Celtics who have a minimum of 4 shooters at any given time generating free looks from 3 all game.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t expect to play the Wolves again. The Celtics are <em>not</em> going to let Luka stand around practicing his deep breathing for 20 seconds 2 out of 3 trips down the court. In both regular season games, they showed the willingness, ability, and intent to force him to expend the effort on defense all game. A 7 game series of that will not be easy on him.</p>

      <label for="l6nbs27" class="commentText"><p>Agreed with everything except Luka&rsquo;s conditioning. He&rsquo;s definitely in good shape now with how he&rsquo;s played recently (while also recovering from injury). However, he still has to exert so much effort on offense that I do think attacking him repeatedly will still tire him out and pay dividends on both ends.</p>

      <label for="l6nczt8" class="commentText"><p>There&rsquo;s basically no player in the NBA except for maybe a hypothetical 2019 Kawhi who can lead an offense and a defense. It&rsquo;s not that Luka&rsquo;s a bum for that fact, but it&rsquo;s still true. Based purely on the numbers and shooting splits, the Celtics have already had success attacking Luka in both games, and one of those was post ASB where they had their genuinely incredible defensive turnaround. The Mavs like to hide Luka on the weakside on a non-shooter so he can drop towards the paint and basically take the possession off while still having time to recover if said non-shooter drives. There&rsquo;s genuinely not a single Celtic in our top 9 other than Luke Kornet who this would work against, and you will never see a possession of Luke standing in the corner waiting for a catch-and-shoot 3.</p>

Problem is that&rsquo;s during the stretch when kidd was experimenting with lineups and we went 1-5. It&rsquo;s not a game that will translate very well to this series.</p>

      <label for="l6o2pvl" class="commentText"><p>Oh God, you&rsquo;re right. How could I forget the famous Mavericks Celtics Weastern Conference Semi-Finals series 😭</p>

<p>The Mavericks haven&rsquo;t played any teams who are analogous to the Celtics on offense because, as much as haters on this sub might hate to hear it, these Celtics are one of one on offense. They have 1 non-shooter in their top <strong>nine</strong> players, and it&rsquo;s their 3rd string center. They posted the best ORTG in the history of basketball!</p>

<p>What team should I look to for analogies that the Mavs have played so far? The Wolves, who have 2 players who you can completely ignore on offense in their top 5? The basically underage Thunder, whose starting SG can&rsquo;t hit 3s with a gun to his head? The beat-up, old man Clippers?</p>

It severely knocks down the lob threat when lively and gafford have to try and create for themselves and with KP he&rsquo;s def the biggest rim protector they will have played.</p>

      <label for="l6nbdaj" class="commentText"><p>I do think the Celtics backcourt is better defensively than the Wolves backcourt but not necessarily by that much. However, I also think they match up better than the Wolves did against Luka and Kyrie. They are obviously still gonna get theirs (especially Luka) because you can only hope to slow them down but I would argue Brown, Jrue, and Tatum are all better equipped to guard Luka than anyone on the Wolves and Jrue and White will match up on Kyrie at least as well as NAW.</p>

Has value as a floor spacer by just being out there and can get buckets here and there in the post.  Dude shot over 40% on threes the past two years.  That’s elite.</p>

<p>Gafford and lively to a lesser extent are shining because of Luka.  They are comparatively less skilled on their own.  They can defend but won’t be able to sit in the paint this series because pretty much every player in the Celtics top eight can shoot.</p>

<p>I’m in the majority who think Horford is too high, I had him 11th behind PJ, DJJ, and Lively.</p>

<p>I take Kyrie over Brown by a hair.</p>

<p>I’m high on PJ Washington; I had him 8th behind Jrue, but I think PJ/Lively/DJJ are close.</p>

<p>I liked Dallas’ chances this series, but when you lay it out like this and the Celtics have 5 of the top 7, gonna be tough. On the other hand you can say each team has 5 of the top 10 if that makes you feel better as a Dallas backer.</p>

<p>I think the series is just gonna come down to the gap between Luka and everyone else.</p>

      <label for="l6nr21e" class="commentText"><p>His defense is what to be scared of. It’s the most consistent part of his game and he’s been fantastic. His shooting is very hot and cold. Obviously vs the Thunder he was fantastic on offense, but I don’t think the Mavs can bank on that.</p>

      <label for="l6n91ji" class="commentText"><p>Lively has been more consistent but I think Horford’s impact ceiling is higher. He stretches the floor and can have nights like the close out game against Celevend where he went for 22pts, 15rbs and 3blks while making 5-6 threes, lively just isn’t going to have games like that. But you’ll also get games where Al gets hunted on D and goes 0-7 from three, whereas lively always seems to do what is expected of him. It’s a hard comp</p>

      <label for="l6n9f3l" class="commentText"><p>I understand my flair probably ruins any validity this message has, but I do think there&rsquo;s a good reason to take JB over Kyrie</p>

<p>When you watch Kyrie play, he looks better than he actually is. This is because he&rsquo;s a master at evading contact and getting really tough shots up that no one else in the league could - which takes immense skill - but, unfortunately, doesn&rsquo;t actually provide much value. This is because avoiding contact means you don&rsquo;t get free throws, and also means you have to take those aforementioned high degree of difficulty shots</p>

<p>All of this results in a genuinely incredible shotmaker in Kyrie only having so-so efficiency metrics (for example, his true shooting this year was effectively identical to Tatum&rsquo;s, and many people would say Tatum is a chucker). This gives him less of an offensive edge than your eyes would suggest, and from there JB&rsquo;s defensive value makes up the gap</p>

<p>Kyrie is a better offensive player, he scored more points, more efficiently, and of course has more assists/a better playmaker</p>

<p>Jaylen is a better defender (though I will say, when locked in this playoffs Kyrie’s defense has not been a liability) I think they’re very close</p>

      <label for="l6nc5mf" class="commentText"><p>One other thing to keep in mind: JB is better than his stats would suggest (purely from a volume standpoint). He scored about 4 more points per game last year but if you watch him play, he&rsquo;s clearly a better player this year. The reason for the dropoff is because the Celtics added two more scoring threats to the team (Jrue and KP) without removing any (Smart, Rob, Grant, and Brogdon left. The only guy there that actually scores is Brogdon, but he was replaced with Pritchard who is also score-first). So, JB&rsquo;s volume stats are lower than they would be if he swapped teams with Kyrie for example because of his relatively limited opportunities</p>

<p>You can see this same effect with Tatum as well. Down 3 ppg from last year with no meaningful change in efficiency</p>

      <label for="l6nequy" class="commentText"><p>This series reminds me a lot of the 2016 NBA finals just with worse teams. In that series the warriors were clearly the better team from top to bottom, but the Cavs had the best player in the world, and Kyrie, who was the second best player on the court. The series was ultimately defined by Kyrie and LeBron playing at a historically good level that was too much to overcome for the much deeper warriors. Steph curry also did not play up to his MVP level self in that series which let the Cavs win 3 straight.</p>

<p>The same can happen this series. If Luka and Kyrie play at an elite level the whole series, I think they have a chance. But the Celtics should be favored. Tatum needs to keep his foot on the gas the whole series and play like a top 5 player in the league.</p>

      <label for="l6ns03w" class="commentText"><p>In a vacuum, Al better than both of those dudes.  More skills on offense and still very solid defensively.  Has value as a floor spacer by just being out there and can get buckets here and there in the post.  Dude shot over 40% on threes the past two years.  That’s elite.</p>

<p>Gafford and lively to a lesser extent are shining because of Luka.  They are comparatively less skilled on their own.  They can defend but won’t be able to sit in the paint this series because pretty much every player in the Celtics top eight can shoot.</p>

Want to see how that matchup goes for as good as a defender as tatum is he definitely has a tendency at times to let up at times which is natural but want to see what he can do locked in vs Luka.</p>

<p>You could see in the series against the nets he really took that matchup with KD seriously, want to see if I he can bring that intensity and success to a difficult matchup with Luka.</p>

      <label for="l6mzr7a" class="commentText"><p>From the article “Luka is the unquestionable best player in the playoffs.” Meanwhile Tatum is a bum who has shot horribly in the playoffs. Meanwhile in reality</p>

<p>TS Tatum 56.5% &amp;gt; Luka 56.4%, assist to turnover ratio Tatum 2.5 &amp;gt; Luka 2.2.</p>

<p>Luka averages 8.8 minutes of possession a game in the playoffs, while Tatum averages 5.2. Hogging the ball and holding it so you’re the last player to pass before a shot will certainly help your scoring totals and assist totals, but it also shows up in turnovers and doesn’t mean you’re a better player.</p>

<p>I’d take Tatum <sup>26</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> with 2.5 turnover, moving the ball with superior efficiency over Luka <sup>28</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub> with 4 turnovers iso ball. And when you factor in defense I’m not convinced Luka is the best player in the playoffs, let alone the “unquestionable” best player.</p>

      <label for="l6ndhoa" class="commentText"><p>Dude you’re making playoff judgments as if Luka and Tatum played against the same teams on the road to the finals. The road to the finals from the East was Charmin soft in comparison to the West. Luka is unquestionably the best player still standing and even most Celtics fans agree. </p>

      <label for="l6n7xot" class="commentText"><p>He struggled alot with the knee early in the playoffs. Last 7 games tho. 65 TS%. Luka has just gotten better and better over the playoffs. Defensive rating is basically the same.</p>

      <label for="l6n9zty" class="commentText"><p>Ahh struggled with the knee. Didn’t know you were the mavericks orthopedist. Amazing how his knee magically got better playing every other day…</p>

<p>I get it though. When Luka plays poorly he’s hurt and when he plays better than normal that’s how he’s going to play forever. It’s not that nba player have up and down stretches or anything and why we look at longer periods of data for significance.</p>

<p>I know you’re not pretending Luka is anywhere near as good as Tatum on defense…</p>

      <label for="l6nd1ky" class="commentText"><p>In other words, you haven&rsquo;t watched a single Mavericks game. It was fucking obvious that he was injured. Better than normal?? check his season stats he has been playing average Luka games. Postseason Luka usually has higher stats then his regular season. and i know you&rsquo;re still holding on to that old Luka is trash on defense line that people like to spew. But again, if you actually watched games and were competent enough to understand what you&rsquo;re seeing. You could recognize that he has been good defensively.</p>

<p>My point is they didn&rsquo;t face the same opponents, you can&rsquo;t really compare their stats</p>

      <label for="l6nfd0i" class="commentText"><p>Silly injury conspiracy nonsense aside, I like how confidently you stated &ldquo;superior efficiency&rdquo; for .1% TS in this playoffs.  Luka has been more efficient than Tatum for both his regular season and playoff career by the way.</p>
