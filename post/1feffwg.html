</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been thinking about Muggsy Bogues and how he basically did the unthinkable for a guy his size: he not only played in the NBA but also got drafted in the lottery and played 14 seasons. So with that in mind I have so many questions.</p>

<p>What made him so special and allowed him to have the career he had? I know his calling card was defense and he was a pretty good passer but so were a lot of other point guards at the time and they were average height for the NBA. Was that really all there was to his game? There hasn&rsquo;t been a player at his height before he came into the league and there hasn&rsquo;t been since. So what did scouts see in him even at the college level that made them say &ldquo;You know what this guy belongs in the NBA, I&rsquo;d like to take him with my lottery pick&rdquo;? He was also a standout college player but so are so many other D-I players and even they didn&rsquo;t sniff the league let alone play there for 14 years. What other tools allowed him to get playing time on the court apart from his very low center of gravity and his nose for the ball? And (this might be more of a speculative question  why didn&rsquo;t he leave much of a legacy for smaller guards when he left? Why didn&rsquo;t NBA scouts look at smaller players differently and decide they could be an NBA point guard even when they already had a precedent for a smaller player playing and lasting long in the league?</p>

      <label for="lmmt0xp" class="commentText"><p>Muggsy was probably the most athletic person 5’5” and under in the world at that time. I know there aren’t that many people that size but he was the best of them all. </p>

<p>He actually was considered a prodigy ever since he was young. He played on arguably the greatest public high school basketball team of all time, where he was its leader despite it having 3 other future NBA players. </p>

<p>He also had a tough bulldog like mentality. If you watch him play even in college or at the 1986 FIBA WC even before the NBA days, you’ll see a player who just ran way more than any other player. Part of that I think also has to do with his upbringing, as he went through a lot but learned how to be tough and persevere. </p>

<p>Today, think of someone like Jose Alvarado. Obviously Muggsy was even shorter but Jose is key NBA rotation player today despite also being way shorter than his peers. </p>

<p>With that said, he would need to improve his 3 point shooting today if he has any shot. His height wouldn’t actually be the main factor holding him back (it would be the second factor). His outside shooting would pretty much automatically disqualify him from the NBA today. </p>

      <label for="lmn5cj2" class="commentText"><p>The sheer amount of hope he inspired in young/short kids. He was an absolutely perfect fit for that kind of basketball/children&rsquo;s cartoon crossover. It would have been a huge miss not to include him in that universe.</p>

<p>Him being an NBA player, and such a visible one at that, allowed me to believe I had a shot at playing high-level basketball for much, much longer than I would have otherwise.</p>

<p>And even now, it hammers home that I&rsquo;m not a high-level basketball player mostly because I lack the talent and drive and not because of my perfectly average height.</p>

      <label for="lmou15l" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily think that it&rsquo;s because things were going so well, I think it&rsquo;s because it was largely before computers/tech began to take over everything. Every decision now in every business is data-driven. It wasn&rsquo;t that way back then. Muggsy would never get a sniff now because models would automatically disqualify him. Same idea for the old fashioned 30 HR 200 strikeout in a season baseball hitters.</p>

<p>Minus the race riots police brutality; the complete lack of rights of LGBTQ individuals; drug laws specifically target the black community; the bombing in OKC, of the World Trade Center, and at the Olympics; genocide in Bosnia and Rwanda; the US failures in Somalia and the first gulf war planting the seeds of the US spending decades in the Middle East.</p>

      <label for="lmn28d6" class="commentText"><p>This is the answer. He was 5&rsquo;3 with a 5&rsquo;5 wingspan and allegedly had a 44&rdquo; vertical (you can find photos of him touching rim),. He had all time level elite quickness, speed and stamina. He also happened to be incredibly strong which made him durable and able to hold up well when opponents attempted to post up on him. He was always able to win against other guards whenever there was a tie up. I do think if he grew up in an era where 3pt shooting was a focus he&rsquo;d have been a good outside shooter based on the fact that he had good form (career 83% FT shooter) and an elite midrange shot (over his final 5 seasons, when shooting distance based data became available, he shot 50% of his FGAs between 16&rsquo; and the 3pt line while making 43% of them&hellip;for context, guys known as elite mid-range shooters like LaMarcus Aldridge shot the same and DeMar DeRozqn shoots 40% on those shots)</p>

      <label for="lmn32u3" class="commentText"><p>to add onto this, he used his short stature as an asset about as well as you can. He was strong as hell, and his super low center of gravity made it super hard for tall players to back him down.</p>

<p>And of course because he was low to the ground and had really quick reflexes, he&rsquo;d just steal the ball anyone had loose handles around him, and he&rsquo;d dribble so low that nobody was able to take it from him. He was racking up 5 to 6 AST/TO ratio seasons before Tyus Jones/Monte Morris made it cool</p>

      <label for="lmniwnj" class="commentText"><p>OP has probably never played ball against really tall people.</p>

<p>I’m 6’2 and usually one of the more athletic people on the floor (I’m 36 y/o and can still rim-scrape a dunk if I have an open lane). We have a guy that plays who is a legit 6’11. He’s older, not the most athletic, mainly rode the bench at a D1 school back in the day.</p>

<p>His ability to block and redirect shots, even with his limited athletic ability, is crazy. It’s <em>such</em> a different game when you’re going into the lane and these massive humans are there. We watch guys in the NBA navigate around these people so it’s hard to comprehend just how difficult it is in real life.</p>

<p>Imagine Muggsy being 5’3 then playing at a high level against actually athletic/skilled instances of these guys… it’s just crazy to think about.</p>

<p>Mugsy was a legend in part because of his stamina, but also because his superb assist/turnovers and on ball defense added a unique element that helped a lot when most of his opponents couldn&rsquo;t really take advantage of his height due to spacing of the era.</p>

      <label for="lmnxkzf" class="commentText"><p>I totally agree with you that the game was different, but one of the critiques of Muggsy&rsquo;s height was that he would never be able to finish in the paint, and he would always have his shot blocked because of his lack of overall length.</p>

<p>What worked for him between 1989-1995 and why he was able to start, wasn&rsquo;t because of the artifacts of the game of yesteryear.  What got him to start was that he was the perfect point guard  for pairing with Larry Johnson and Alonzo Mourning with Dell Curry and Hersey Hawkins spacing the floor.  He managed the conflicting egos of LJ and Mourning very well.  Nobody could boss Muggsy Bogues around (he once wrestled J.R. Reid, who was 250 pounds, Muggsy about 150 wet, and Bogues pinned Reid to the ground).  And he had shooters whom were good enough to have gravity.  Hawkins was also a three level scorer who was athletic, could finish well and had good shooting form.  In the days of illegal defense, this means the hornets can clear both wings to opposite ends of the floor while Muggsy orchestrates a two man game with one of the bigs.</p>

<p>All these factors gave Muggsy a tremendous amount of room in the mid range and a bevy of options coming off the pick and roll in the half court set.  And nobody beats Muggsy free throw line to free throw line when he&rsquo;s running the break.  With Larry Johnson sprinting beside him and Mourning trailing, Charlotte&rsquo;s transition offense became their primary attraction, and IMHO it is largely why Muggsy became a spectacle in the first place.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising, that Muggsy&rsquo;s particular skillset, he was hugely successful in high school where he didn&rsquo;t have to score a lot of points, because he had Reggie Williams, David Wingate and later on Reggie Lewis (along with a bevy of D1 prospects that became overseas pros).  If you look on his Wake Forest teams, although his college team mates were less heralded, he always had other scorers to feed.  Ditto for his NBA career.  He was not effective in Washington, nor was he nearly as effective when he was in Golden State, especially after a pretty serious injury.  But with the Hornets, he was a sight for sore eyes.  In today&rsquo;s league, he would still be an all time on ball defender, an amazing offensive general, and with the right roster he would be able to find space and do just enough on that side of the offense to stay on the court.</p>

      <label for="lmpg1ir" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m surprised this is the only post I saw in here addressing the &ldquo;pretty good passer&rdquo; part. The first and main thing I think about with Bogues is his passing and ball handling. A fair comparison might be a very short Chris Paul, without the jump shot. Yes he had the toughness and athleticism to hold his own on D, but playmaking and ball handling is where he really shined.</p>

<p>Another underappreciated aspect in this discussion is that Bogues did all this <em>without a jump shot</em>, which is just incredible when you think about it. OP is also a little off in saying no one else has had success at that height&ndash; Earl Boykins was only a couple of inches taller than Bogues at 5&rsquo;5&rdquo;, but had a long and productive career too. But he did that as a flamethrower of a scorer with a great jumper and dribble penetration game, which makes a little more sense. To be 5&rsquo;3&rdquo; <em>and</em> have no jump shot yet still be an effective NBA player is nuts.</p>

      <label for="lmn2l5e" class="commentText"><p>Do you think Mugsy would have been able to be a solid defender in today’s game, with all the PNRs and just the much higher level of shooting? He fundamentally can’t close down perimeter shooters, high volume shooter bigs, and would have a really hard time dealing with the volume of 3p shooting in general.</p>

<p>He was a phenomenal ISO defender, but we are now past peak ISO ball. With fewer ISOs and limited hand checking, I’m not sure how effective he could possibly be.</p>

Other than him, only Earl Boikins comes to mind when talking about short people in the NBA.</p>

<p>Although basketball might be one of the sports where height is a severe advantage, we can see in international play where short guys can play just as good, but sometimes it is hard for someone to believe and put faith in it (at least I see some examples like this).</p>

<p>JJ Barea was also a succesful short person, although I think he was 6&rsquo;0</p>

Or will you get tracked very early on into a different sport where height is less of a disadvantage? So the pool of short, super athletic people who play basketball is already a small sample.</p>

<p>What teams look for in the NBA draft today is different from what it was back in Mugsy&rsquo;s day.  Back then, players who had achieved at the collegiate level were more highly valued than they are now.</p>

<p>NBA draft picks today &ndash; especially lottery picks &ndash; are about POTENTIAL.</p>

Also playing in college doesn’t necessarily “prove your worth” to the NBA game because it’s so different. Frank Kaminski was the best player in college by his fourth year and was out of the league in 6-7 years.</p>

My guess is that back in the day Muggsy could still play good defense because players, especially guards were not as strong, so it was not easy to overpower him. Guys like Stockton, Kevin Johnson, even Penny Hardaway were fairly lanky compared to guards today as there was not as much emphasis on strength training.</p>

Teams were still focused on going for layups instead of shooting 3s.  Hand checking actually helped him because he could keep people in place and had a much lower center of gravity.</p>

<p>Look at short players like Isaiah Thomas. Bogues would get cooked on defense in today&rsquo;s NBA. Sure he can run around and try to pick people&rsquo;s pockets&hellip; but that&rsquo;s not going to get you very far at all when teams can just PnR and shoot over your head.</p>

      <label for="lmplpdx" class="commentText"><p>He made the playoffs 4 times and was a part of many 19-25 win teams. His deepest playoff run was on the back of  Alonzo Mourning and Larry Johnson.</p>

<p>I think people romanticized his career because he’s such a unique player. I had his jersey and his career and life story is a fantastic example of working hard. But the rules favor height more than ever.</p>

<p>391-498 regular season record. 19 playoff games over his career… He logged massive minutes on bad teams.</p>

<p>Also, the reason he was on the Hornets is because it was an expansion team. The team that drafted Muggsy didn’t protect him from being taken by the expansion Heat or Hornets. Teams got to protect 8 players, so he was deemed the 9 most important player.</p>

He was drafted by the team who also had a 7 ft. 7 in. player named Manute Bol. His high pick was a marketing gimmick imo. They had both the tallest and shortest player in the NBA on the same team (and probably in NBA history?).</p>

<p>As for how he stayed in the league, I was a little young for his era, but as far as I know he was scrappy af.</p>

I do think the basketball community overrates height as a component of basketball skill. Im not saying height isnt important but in the guard positions its overrated. Wingspan and standing reach (which I know is correlated with height but it does vary) footspeed and strength are far more important than I think even seasoned scouts give credit. The basketball community has self selection bias and I think there is some level of attribution error where players are dinged in their evaluations based on size. &ldquo;Small ball&rdquo; was the communitty self correcting so i think the bias isnt as big as it was.</p>

<p>NBA nitpicking once again.</p>

<p>NBA All-Time leaders in assist-to-turnover ratio (min. 7,000 career assists)</p>

<ol>
<li>Chris Paul - 4.00</li>
<li>John Stockton - 3.72</li>

<li>Gary Payton - 2.96</li>
<li>Magic Johnson - 2.89</li>

<p>That&rsquo;s similar to LeBron not officially having a couple longevity records. For example scoring average at age x because he missed the NBAs minimum requirement by just a game or two.</p>

Grew up watching him on those very early Charlotte teams, but never really “got” how small he is until I stood next to him and shook his hand. I’m 6’0” and very much average size. I felt so big next to him. He was shorter than my 11-year-old son. Super nice guy.</p>
