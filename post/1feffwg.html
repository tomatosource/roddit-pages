</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been thinking about Muggsy Bogues and how he basically did the unthinkable for a guy his size: he not only played in the NBA but also got drafted in the lottery and played 14 seasons. So with that in mind I have so many questions.</p>

<p>What made him so special and allowed him to have the career he had? I know his calling card was defense and he was a pretty good passer but so were a lot of other point guards at the time and they were average height for the NBA. Was that really all there was to his game? There hasn&rsquo;t been a player at his height before he came into the league and there hasn&rsquo;t been since. So what did scouts see in him even at the college level that made them say &ldquo;You know what this guy belongs in the NBA, I&rsquo;d like to take him with my lottery pick&rdquo;? He was also a standout college player but so are so many other D-I players and even they didn&rsquo;t sniff the league let alone play there for 14 years. What other tools allowed him to get playing time on the court apart from his very low center of gravity and his nose for the ball? And (this might be more of a speculative question  why didn&rsquo;t he leave much of a legacy for smaller guards when he left? Why didn&rsquo;t NBA scouts look at smaller players differently and decide they could be an NBA point guard even when they already had a precedent for a smaller player playing and lasting long in the league?</p>

      <label for="lmmt0xp" class="commentText"><p>Muggsy was probably the most athletic person 5’5” and under in the world at that time. I know there aren’t that many people that size but he was the best of them all. </p>

<p>He actually was considered a prodigy ever since he was young. He played on arguably the greatest public high school basketball team of all time, where he was its leader despite it having 3 other future NBA players. </p>

<p>He also had a tough bulldog like mentality. If you watch him play even in college or at the 1986 FIBA WC even before the NBA days, you’ll see a player who just ran way more than any other player. Part of that I think also has to do with his upbringing, as he went through a lot but learned how to be tough and persevere. </p>

<p>Today, think of someone like Jose Alvarado. Obviously Muggsy was even shorter but Jose is key NBA rotation player today despite also being way shorter than his peers. </p>

<p>With that said, he would need to improve his 3 point shooting today if he has any shot. His height wouldn’t actually be the main factor holding him back (it would be the second factor). His outside shooting would pretty much automatically disqualify him from the NBA today. </p>

<p>What teams look for in the NBA draft today is different from what it was back in Mugsy&rsquo;s day.  Back then, players who had achieved at the collegiate level were more highly valued than they are now.</p>

<p>NBA draft picks today &ndash; especially lottery picks &ndash; are about POTENTIAL.</p>

      <label for="lmmu5dd" class="commentText"><p>I know it sounds cliche but he had that dawg in him. A lot of it.</p>

<p>Often times when you’re at a physical disadvantage compared to somebody who is bigger, faster and stronger than you it forces you to use up every bit of your will power and Muggsy exemplified that.</p>

      <label for="lmmvih5" class="commentText"><p>I’ve only ever been told that a player like Muggsy Bogues could never have survived in the 80s-90s. I heard LeBron would quit basketball due to the ridiculously hard fouls and constant physicality. I question if Muggsy was even real. So don’t ask me.</p>

      <label for="lmmvrk0" class="commentText"><p>Quickness, hands, defensive fundamentals. And not just a pretty good passer, elite in BBIQ and decision-making. That&rsquo;s why he was in the neighborhood of 10 assists and only 2 turnovers per game in his prime.</p>

      <label for="lmmu4pc" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s interesting. Average height of the NBA players hasn&rsquo;t changed much since 1980&rsquo;s, but the average weight went up by 12 pounds. My guess is that back in the day Muggsy could still play good defense because players, especially guards were not as strong, so it was not easy to overpower him. Guys like Stockton, Kevin Johnson, even Penny Hardaway were fairly lanky compared to guards today as there was not as much emphasis on strength training.</p>
