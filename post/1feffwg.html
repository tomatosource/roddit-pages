</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been thinking about Muggsy Bogues and how he basically did the unthinkable for a guy his size: he not only played in the NBA but also got drafted in the lottery and played 14 seasons. So with that in mind I have so many questions.</p>

<p>What made him so special and allowed him to have the career he had? I know his calling card was defense and he was a pretty good passer but so were a lot of other point guards at the time and they were average height for the NBA. Was that really all there was to his game? There hasn&rsquo;t been a player at his height before he came into the league and there hasn&rsquo;t been since. So what did scouts see in him even at the college level that made them say &ldquo;You know what this guy belongs in the NBA, I&rsquo;d like to take him with my lottery pick&rdquo;? He was also a standout college player but so are so many other D-I players and even they didn&rsquo;t sniff the league let alone play there for 14 years. What other tools allowed him to get playing time on the court apart from his very low center of gravity and his nose for the ball? And (this might be more of a speculative question  why didn&rsquo;t he leave much of a legacy for smaller guards when he left? Why didn&rsquo;t NBA scouts look at smaller players differently and decide they could be an NBA point guard even when they already had a precedent for a smaller player playing and lasting long in the league?</p>

      <label for="lmmt0xp" class="commentText"><p>Muggsy was probably the most athletic person 5’5” and under in the world at that time. I know there aren’t that many people that size but he was the best of them all. </p>

<p>He actually was considered a prodigy ever since he was young. He played on arguably the greatest public high school basketball team of all time, where he was its leader despite it having 3 other future NBA players. </p>

<p>He also had a tough bulldog like mentality. If you watch him play even in college or at the 1986 FIBA WC even before the NBA days, you’ll see a player who just ran way more than any other player. Part of that I think also has to do with his upbringing, as he went through a lot but learned how to be tough and persevere. </p>

<p>Today, think of someone like Jose Alvarado. Obviously Muggsy was even shorter but Jose is key NBA rotation player today despite also being way shorter than his peers. </p>

<p>With that said, he would need to improve his 3 point shooting today if he has any shot. His height wouldn’t actually be the main factor holding him back (it would be the second factor). His outside shooting would pretty much automatically disqualify him from the NBA today. </p>

<p>Him being an NBA player, and such a visible one at that, allowed me to believe I had a shot at playing high-level basketball for much, much longer than I would have otherwise.</p>

<p>And even now, it hammers home that I&rsquo;m not a high-level basketball player mostly because I lack the talent and drive and not because of my perfectly average height.</p>

      <label for="lmn28d6" class="commentText"><p>This is the answer. He was 5&rsquo;3 with a 5&rsquo;5 wingspan and allegedly had a 44&rdquo; vertical (you can find photos of him touching rim),. He had all time level elite quickness, speed and stamina. He also happened to be incredibly strong which made him durable and able to hold up well when opponents attempted to post up on him. He was always able to win against other guards whenever there was a tie up. I do think if he grew up in an era where 3pt shooting was a focus he&rsquo;d have been a good outside shooter based on the fact that he had good form (career 83% FT shooter) and an elite midrange shot (over his final 5 seasons, when shooting distance based data became available, he shot 50% of his FGAs between 16&rsquo; and the 3pt line while making 43% of them&hellip;for context, guys known as elite mid-range shooters like LaMarcus Aldridge shot the same and DeMar DeRozqn shoots 40% on those shots)</p>

      <label for="lmn32u3" class="commentText"><p>to add onto this, he used his short stature as an asset about as well as you can. He was strong as hell, and his super low center of gravity made it super hard for tall players to back him down.</p>

<p>And of course because he was low to the ground and had really quick reflexes, he&rsquo;d just steal the ball anyone had loose handles around him, and he&rsquo;d dribble so low that nobody was able to take it from him. He was racking up 5 to 6 AST/TO ratio seasons before Tyus Jones/Monte Morris made it cool</p>

<p>I thought someone like Muggsy would be at least a 2 standard deviation height to the left of the average but that’s probably not right now that you mention it. </p>

      <label for="lmn7kjr" class="commentText"><p>Well 5&rsquo;10 is taller than average, the average asian is southeast asia (or actually just south asia) is somewhere from 5&rsquo;3-5&rsquo;6. When I&rsquo;m in HK I feel normal height at 5&rsquo;4 (though some people think I&rsquo;m shorter than I look because I got wide shoulders and a big chest). In the U.S., I feel like a midget, I always feel like I&rsquo;m the shortest guy anywhere I go to.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a miracle I&rsquo;m even 5&rsquo;4 because originally my family doctor estimated I would only grow to 4&rsquo;10-11 because of my family genetics so I took a lots of growth hormone shots as a kid. I just wished during that period I did more excersing and stretching so that not only I can growth a few more inches, but also become leaner and more athletic. Maybe I should do the limb lengthening surgery, my parents keep urging me but I&rsquo;m kinda scared of the risks&hellip;</p>

      <label for="lmnezaf" class="commentText"><p>My dad is also 5&rsquo;4, my mom is 5&rsquo;0 (maybe even 4&rsquo;11), my dad&rsquo;s side of the family is not tall at all, the tallest guy in my family is my dad&rsquo;s younger brother and he&rsquo;s only 5&rsquo;8. My cousins and other relatives are all 5&rsquo;2 or shorter.</p>

<p>As for my mom&rsquo;s side, the women are short, but weirdly enough, both my mom&rsquo;s brother and their father is around 5&rsquo;11 (maybe even 6&rsquo;0 in their 20s). They tower over most people in HK and my uncle look normal next to people in the U.S. It&rsquo;s a shame not alot of my grandpa&rsquo;s genes from my mom side passed down to me but then again, the genes from my dad side are really strong, hence my dad&rsquo;s side everyone looks the same regardless of gender and are all short (espicially when we all wear glassess) lol.</p>

<p>Well I don&rsquo;t think lengthening surgery is gonna give me 4 inches, maybe around 2-2.5 inches (3 inches is VERY generous). My arms would also look kinda short if I actually do 4 inches lol. Playing defense while being short, having a proportional wingspan, and not being the most coordinated/agile is such a brutal thing in basketball, I rather guard someone posting up than someone slashing to the rim, breaks my heart because I really wanna be a good defensive player like a Jrue Holiday and PJ tucker since these guys are girthy strong defenders but they are also long and have more athletiscim in their pinky than my whole body. I kinda understand how Alperen Sengun feels guarding athletic slashers lol</p>

      <label for="lmn099e" class="commentText"><p>I actually think he just doesn&rsquo;t make it in today&rsquo;s NBA because reliably getting a 3P shot off at that height is basically impossible.  Requires an insane amount of space.  He maybe would have a backup role as a pass-first PG and POA defender, but I cannot see him making it as a starter in today&rsquo;s NBA.</p>

<p>What teams look for in the NBA draft today is different from what it was back in Mugsy&rsquo;s day.  Back then, players who had achieved at the collegiate level were more highly valued than they are now.</p>

<p>NBA draft picks today &ndash; especially lottery picks &ndash; are about POTENTIAL.</p>

Also playing in college doesn’t necessarily “prove your worth” to the NBA game because it’s so different.

      <label for="lmn2l5e" class="commentText"><p>Do you think Mugsy would have been able to be a solid defender in today’s game, with all the PNRs and just the much higher level of shooting? He fundamentally can’t close down perimeter shooters, high volume shooter bigs, and would have a really hard time dealing with the volume of 3p shooting in general.</p>

<p>He was a phenomenal ISO defender, but we are now past peak ISO ball. With fewer ISOs and limited hand checking, I’m not sure how effective he could possibly be.</p>

My guess is that back in the day Muggsy could still play good defense because players, especially guards were not as strong, so it was not easy to overpower him. Guys like Stockton, Kevin Johnson, even Penny Hardaway were fairly lanky compared to guards today as there was not as much emphasis on strength training.</p>

      <label for="lmn0pua" class="commentText"><p>NBA had a different set of rules, zone defense was illegal. The NBA had been watered down due to the rapid expansion of the NBA under Michael Jordan. Teams were still focused on going for layups instead of shooting 3s.  Hand checking actually helped him because he could keep people in place and had a much lower center of gravity.</p>

<p>Look at short players like Isaiah Thomas. Bogues would get cooked on defense in today&rsquo;s NBA. Sure he can run around and try to pick people&rsquo;s pockets&hellip; but that&rsquo;s not going to get you very far at all when teams can just PnR and shoot over your head.</p>
