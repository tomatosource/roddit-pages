      <label for="l9hsio2" class="commentText"><p>Exactly. Dude was known as a good role player well enough if you actually watched basketball. He was getting decent run in the playoffs for the spurs and put up some big games. Like 30+ points in a playoff game kind of big. Pop gave him a bag with $73mm 4 year rookie scale extension and then dealt him to Boston in preparation for the following year’s tank for wemby.</p>

<p>I doubt anyone knew he’d be a 2 time all defensive 2nd teamer, but Boston wouldn’t have given up a first and j-rich’s expiring contract for him and that longer contract if they thought he wasn’t good.</p>

<p>The only people really underrating him are casuals like OP who get their basketball opinions from the comment sections of Reddit and Instagram posts</p>

      <label for="l9hkczf" class="commentText"><p>Deni has already had his breakout though. He averaged 15/7/4 on good efficiency. The great thing about the D-White trade is that he still had his questions when he was traded. I feel like Deni is too good right now where every team knows what value he would be, so he really isn&rsquo;t a diamond in the rough.</p>

      <label for="l9hlno5" class="commentText"><p>Yeah White was fairly undervalued because of his lack of a 3 point shot, and with guard defense being less sought after than wing defense. That&rsquo;s why I think Deni is so valuable. Nearly all 30 teams are looking for efficient 2 way wings, and Deni checks off those boxes. He really doesn&rsquo;t have a huge negative to his game that would scare off some teams.</p>

<p>I think White was just one of those guys that wasn&rsquo;t really available right up until he was, and Stevens got there first with a fair offer.  Spurs were still trying at that point, and White was traded out before Murray or Poeltl and the commitment to tanking.  Had White more publicly hit the market I think he would have commanded a lot of interest.</p>

      <label for="l9hqfmr" class="commentText"><p>His age + contract definitely make him better than Jerami Grant, but there are still some big questions about Deni, mainly his shooting. I know he shot quite well (but still not elite) from 3 this year,, but he was shooting only 31% from 3 for three season before that. And it was on relatively low number of attempts too. If he can keep up the shooting he showed this year he would be perfect, but if he doesn&rsquo;t keep it up we would have some serious spacing issues.</p>

<p>One of the big reasons why we&rsquo;re trying to upgrade the PJ-DJJ frontcourt is that they are both average shooters at best, so if Deni regresses back to 31% we have a problem. This is also why Jeram Grant is mentioned so much as a target, he&rsquo;s a legit good shooter.</p>

<p>I would still take him over Jerami due to contract and age, as said, but it&rsquo;s not like he is the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; target.</p>

He had a good season playing the role of 3&amp;D here and was fantastic against Phoenix before hurting his shoulder running into multiple Joker screens game 3.  He wasn&rsquo;t the same after that and a hard time getting his jersey off that night.  I think there is a lot more to him, that can still be unlocked.</p>

Who would have thought the Celtics actually might have gotten the bad end of the Nesmith, Theis, and 1st for Brogdon deal - especially after Brogdon won 6moty?</p>

<p>And, yes, I realize Brogdon was used as salary to trade for Jrue, I was just talking in terms of pure value.</p>

<p>Nesmith showed flashes of being solid (which is why Indiana wanted him) but there simply isn’t room for him on this Celtics roster. Even if they somehow kept Nesmith he’d be playing like 15 min/game at best.</p>

I could definitely see him being a super role player in the future.</p>

<p>Too young and raw at this stage to say he could have that impact if traded though and a lot of promising Heat players seem to fizzle when they go elsewhere and lose that Spoelstra magic</p>

<p>The irony in you calling out revisionist history and then saying this is funny. The vast majority of people didn&rsquo;t even know who Derrick White was before the trade while Murray was literally an All Star.</p>

<p>If you want an actual concrete example, here is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14FwSuJwIexTs2Fm01IUVF07eE3heRlHpjWpTsrp7bQg/edit?gid=207351266#gid=207351266" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a> ranking the top 100 players for the 2022-2023 season, based on average placement on list from ESPN, Bleacher Report, The Athletic etc. Dejounte Murray ranks 35th, Derrick White isn&rsquo;t even in the top 100.</p>

<p>No one thought the Spurs &ldquo;gave away White for nothing&rdquo;. People thought it was a fair trade on both sides at the time</p>

<p>He wanted to expand his role, you may agree or not but he in fact did expand his role.</p>

<p>He also wanted to get the bag, and he did got a bag.</p>

<p>I doubt he will have all those on the Nuggets.</p>
