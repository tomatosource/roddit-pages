<p>The joke is that Roman men did the same but with an era that is ancient to <em>them,</em> the Macedonians, who&rsquo;s empire peaked about 300 years before the beginning of the Roman Empire.</p>

And some above commenters talking about mysterious ancient cultures idolized by the Egyptians. It should come as no surprise that 40,000-50,000 years of Homo sapiens and the limits of preservation mean there is a LOT we don’t know about the past and the complexity of the people and societies who lived it. Sure monumental architecture a la ancient Egypt is fascinating but certainly not special in the abstract.</p>

      <label for="l6gx2ix" class="commentText"><p>Occasionally I like to pretend that the Venus theory thing is true. That humans used to live on Venus. We developed reliable space travel and started colonizing earth. We fucked up Venus/something bad happened and only the colony on earth was left. Without a supply line the colony slowly recessed. A lot of religious stuff was due to leadership being in orbit in space and was just martial law misinterpreted over thousands of years. A huge civil war broke out and that was the event that reduced humanity down to like 10,000 (I forgot what the extinction event was called). And that the spaceships in area 51 are the only surviving remnants from that time period.</p>

<p>Venus is covered in thick atmosphere we can&rsquo;t easily observe through, and the most time we&rsquo;ve spent on the surface is like 2 seconds before the intense heat and hydrosulfuric acid killed the rover. Venus also has gravity closer to Earth, and may have had similar conditions to Earth before a run away greenhouse effect.</p>

<p>they were not some separate people. They were greek. Alexander the Great was a Macedonian, and he was Greek.  Just like Leonidas was a Spartan, he was still a greek</p>

<p>The pomerium was basically a dividing line between a city and everything else, but Rome’s pomerium was special.</p>

<p>According to mythology, Romulus and Remus disagreed on which hill near the river Tiber to build their city on. Eventually, after Romulus and his followers began digging a trench around their favoured hill (the Palatine), a fight broke out between them and Remus’ group, resulting in Romulus killing Remus. The trench later became Rome’s pomerium.</p>

<p>Later generations of Romans justified the killing of Remus by claiming that anyone who crossed Rome’s pomerium was symbolically breaching the defences of the city, something that they had to be killed for.</p>

<p>To allow people to actually enter and exit the city without needing to kill them, the Romans established gaps in the pomerium for people to travel through. The pomerium was basically just an invisible boundary with some markers indicating where it was by the 1st Century BC, but the Romans still only travelled through the gaps. At his triumph, Pompey Magnus tried and failed to get a chariot pulled by elephants through one of the gaps - he couldn’t move them through the much wider spaces on either side of the gap, because that would have been breaching the pomerium.</p>

<p>The pomerium also played a role in Roman government. If a soldier or a provincial governor passed through the pomerium, it was an instant resignation (unless they were having a triumph). This meant that any provincial governors who wanted to run for office had to resign their post before entering the city, which they had to do to be eligible for election (this played a role in Julius Caesar crossing the Rubicon).</p>

<p>However, some elections required the citizens voting for them to symbolically become soldiers. Symbolic soldiers weren’t allowed in the pomerium either, so the voters had to leave the pomerium and vote on the campus martius. As a result, wealthy citizens could simply visit their villas outside the city, while crowds of plebs were bottlenecked at the pomerium’s gaps.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a consul outside the pomerium was considered to be on military campaign, and therefore held the power of life and death. This was symbolised by his attendants putting axe blades into the bundles of sticks they carried with them. Symbolism aside, it was also forbidden to bring weapons into the pomerium at all. However, a dictator could do all of the above without breaking the law, as that office was only held in times of extreme crisis (or if Julius Caesar had won a civil war).</p>

      <label for="l6ha115" class="commentText"><p>Well the &ldquo;meme&rdquo; is specifically from tiktok iirc, and it involves girls asking their boyfriends how often they think about the Roman Empire. And then everyone comes up with these wild assumptions about why so many men seem to think about it.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s tiktok so assuming there is a toxic masculinity aspect to it is natural for those people lol. </p>

<p>Now to be fair there is a segment of the far right who absolutely do romanticize a fantastical version of the Romans (wherein they ignore all the gay sex the Romans enjoyed among other things lol). It&rsquo;s practically a prerequisite for any shade of fascist-curious dweebs to hold distorted views of the past that support their current theories about the world.</p>

      <label for="l6h12ho" class="commentText"><p>Um, since when is this men thinking about the Roman Empire thing about some idealized form of masculinity? This is the first I’m hearing of this. I thought it was because the Romans were an interesting and highly influential ancient civilization the actions of which are still felt today. But I guess some people are just gonna make up bullshit to advance their personal agenda.</p>

      <label for="l6hb1q5" class="commentText"><p>Honestly, framing it that way is letting toxic masculinity/altright take things. Ancient Rome spanned hundreds of years with many different periods and things you can find interesting. Don’t let them take it from normal people who like history just because they want to grasp and straws and cherry pick things to justify whatever nonsense they’re trying to peddle.</p>

<p>We pretty much just let them take as much Nordic imagery as possible with no pushback. At least frame it so they look dumb “certain people seem to think ancient Rome espouses their toxic modern beliefs, but those people shouldn’t be allowed to make every person interested in ancient Rome get side-eyed.”</p>

and again, go touch grass, you care way too much about homophobic chuds, it&rsquo;s not healthy to just be so focused on hating people like that, that when you see an explaination for a joke you need to make a jab at them.</p>

<p>I mean I have a problem with OP of the comment saying men thinking about the roman empire because masculinity, which is very reductive and it&rsquo;s akin to saying people are interested in star wars for the light saber battles (which yes its one reason but not the only reason).</p>

<p>History is beautiful and horrifying, being from Austria I’ve grown to take my country’s history very seriously. Which in turn informs my feelings on the discourse in alt right circles a lot.

<p>Men thinking about the Roman Empire all the time is a current meme. This meme makes fun of that by asking what they thought about during the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>The answer is the Macedonian empire which is just an older empire. The other answer you got while thorough is probably thinking about it a lot harder than your cousin was when they sent it.</p>

      <label for="l6h2v78" class="commentText"><p>Tom Tucker here.</p>

<p>In September 2023, there was a peak in discussions around a <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-often-do-you-think-about-the-roman-empire" target="_blank">viral meme about how often men think about the Roman Empire</a>. The topic had come up on social media since 2022. It quickly died out after the peak led to coverage in mainstream media outlets.</p>

<p>The comic in question, which based on its  style and the font of the caption appeared in the <em>New Yorker</em> magazine, was a commentary on that discussion. The artist attempted to find humor by showing two Roman men in discussion about how often they think about civilizations that were ancient to them. The joke being that men have always been this way, with a fascination for ancient civilizations that is not shared by women, according to the viral meme.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t have a date on the comic from the <em>New Yorker</em>, so it is not clear whether it was contemporaneous with the viral conversation about men and Rome. The humor of the single-panel comics in the <em>New Yorker</em> is often mocked for trying too hard to seem smart or relevant when they are an exercise in blandness and mediocrity.</p>

<p>It therefore is possible that this comic making a gag about men thinking about the Roman empire appeared in the <em>New Yorker</em> long after the joke was relevant.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m Tom Tucker. And I&hellip; am&hellip; out of here.</p>
