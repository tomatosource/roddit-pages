      <label for="lse010a" class="commentText"><p>It felt like the tipping point where there was definitely a 0% chance Lillard would be dealt to Miami was when Dame’s agent was calling other teams telling them to stop submitting offers and that he wouldn’t report to them if traded there.</p>

<p>Whether or not Miami was in cahoots with Dame’s agent in that (they probably were), Portland felt like they were actively trying to take all agency away from the Blazers and forcing them to take the Miami offer for Lillard. And that would piss any front office off.</p>

<p>It is genuinely impressive that Portland got as good of an offer for Dame as they did, given how much Lillard and the Heat were trying to depress his value.</p>

Might have still got the #1 seed but with a lot more wear and tear, and stars having to play heavy minutes late in the season to lock up home court advantage.</p>

<p>Plus, Jrue was so incredibly valuable in a switching defense</p>

      <label for="lsehx4h" class="commentText"><p>Brogdon and Timelord would be Celtics in this scenario. So no, not everyone would be taking more minutes. Keep in mind that Porzingis would still be on the team. In fact, I’d argue everyone would take on less minutes because we sent out 2 players for 1 (Jrue). Plus we probably would’ve made another trade for a guard anyways considering Brogdon wasn’t ever going to stay after the summer trade fiasco</p>

<p>Joe Cronin could have went to Miami, proposed a Lowry or Herro, Jovic, Jaquez, and picks/swaps package and see if Miami accepted. Of course Miami didn’t offer everything they could give up, you want to trade as little as possible, but that doesn’t mean they wouldn’t have given all that up for Dame, we don’t know because Cronin never proposed that trade to them, he only proposed stupid stuff like Bam or Jimmy, which was never going to happen because it went against the entire intent of trading for Dame.</p>

<p>And Dame didn&rsquo;t ask, he demanded. His agent is literally on record saying both that Dame wouldn&rsquo;t play for any other team, and that he was calling teams telling them not to put in offers.</p>

<p>You know what Jrue Holiday did? In private, he gave Blazers small list of destinations he&rsquo;d like. If Dame played it that way, and Miami made competitive offers in a free market, Dame might be on Heat right now. Course, the Heat might have lost some good rookies and not made past first round anyway&hellip;but that&rsquo;s exactly why Pat didn&rsquo;t want to do a fair trade.</p>

<p>Sure if you want to count all related trades, the full package was Dame, Nurkic, Little, Keon Johnson for Ayton, Brogdon, Rob Williams, Camara and 3 picks. If you want to loop in the Brogdon + 2 picks for Deni trade (probably should if you&rsquo;re counting the Jrue return as part of the package, no?) the return changes to Ayton, Rob Williams, Avdija, and 1 pick. Speaking of getting off contracts, if Portland didn&rsquo;t have to salary dump Brogdon as part of the Avdija trade to cut their luxury tax bill (if they traded for Lowry&rsquo;s expiring contract instead of Brogdon&rsquo;s <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>45</sub> contract, as they would have in this hypothetical), they probably could have traded less draft capital for Avdija</p>

<p>Yes, like I said that was &ldquo;the best possible package Miami could have offered.&rdquo; It has been widely reported the 2 teams hardly negotiated/spoke over the summer. That package I mentioned was definitely not offered by Miami at any point.</p>

<p>Blazers got pissed at the shitty bully tactics and went somewhere else. Now, did Miami freak out and try to give more realistic offers as the situation progressed? We&rsquo;ll never really know, but given Reilly&rsquo;s track record, I doubt they ever really ponied up something that made sense for blazers.</p>

<p>Yes, which is why I clearly said that package was &ldquo;the best possible package Miami could have offered&rdquo; not that they actually offered it.

<p>As if if this was a realistic thing? If you&rsquo;re just being completely hypothetical, it&rsquo;s still kind of a silly response. &ldquo;Well, team XYZ could have topped Miami&rsquo;s best offer, so why didn&rsquo;t we take that?&rdquo; Not on the table.

<p>&ldquo;The best possible package Miami could have offered if they went all-in for Dame&rdquo; makes it very clear that the package I am about to present is a hypothetical. That was the first sentence of my comment that you originally replied to. The point I was replying to was also a hypothetical (&ldquo;Miami never had the assets to pull that trade off.) How would I respond to that hypothetical without a hypothetical lmao?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not on the table. Not &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; which as you point out was the framework for this convo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that was your takeaway from the sentence &ldquo;Realistically Miami never had the assets to pull that trade off&rdquo; and the rest of that comment, you badly misread it. If you still don&rsquo;t understand how, you badly need to work on your reading comprehension. I&rsquo;m pretty sure you&rsquo;re just intentionally misrepresenting everything though lol because it would be weird for you to have perfect writing but middle school level reading comprehension.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>OP</strong>: Realistically, Miami never had the assets to pull that trade off. You had Herro who, due to his contract, is a neutral asset and whole bag of nothing. When you compare that to the actual haul Portland got, you see how far away Miami really was. So from Miami&rsquo;s standpoint whether or not they pissed Portland off was irrelevant, that trade was not happening unless they managed to scare other suitors off and be the only offer on the table. Good effort by Miami, I can see why they gave it a go.<br>
<strong>You</strong>: The point OP was making, the main point, was that Miami couldn&rsquo;t or reasonably wouldn&rsquo;t make an offer to get Dame.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The guy is clearly saying Miami did not have the ability to put together a competitive package for him even if they offered all of their assets outside of Jimmy and Bam lol. There is no ambiguity in that comment. This was also the prevailing narrative by the national media and Blazers fans throughout summer 2023 for some reason.</p>

      <label for="lsehban" class="commentText"><p>Cronin absolutely is an idiot. The Heat offered a lowball to see how cheap Dame’s value is. Cronin never thought to make a proposal to Miami of what he wanted from them, he asked for Bam or Jimmy like a child.</p>

<p>Even if he didn’t want Herro because of Simons, Lowry, Jovic, Jaquez, 2 firsts, and some pick swaps is undoubtedly better than the garbage they ended up with.</p>

<p>Cronin isn’t worthy of praise in this situation. Miami front office actually deserves more praise for valuing their assets now that Herro, Jovic, and Jaquez are all Top 6 rotation guys on a playoff team.</p>

The closest there ever was to a credible report of Miami&rsquo;s actual offer was from Marc Spears like the week of the trade to Milwaukee and it was pretty vague.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On July 1, ESPN reported that Lillard requested a trade, with his preferred destination being the Miami Heat. In the nearly three months since that request became public, no substantial trade conversations have taken place between the two teams, sources said.<br>
The Heat initially offered a trade package that included sharpshooter Tyler Herro and two first-round draft picks, a source said.</p>

<p>He didn’t even give a list of like 3 teams. Nope just one. Dumbest shit ever, no team would ever bend over for their guy like that. That’s just bad business.</p>

<p>Dame took a huge dump on his legacy here after he handled that summer. Real bummer. Dude spent over a decade building his entire brand on loyalty. Stay loyal to the soil was basically his motto.</p>

<p>And listen, most of us would agree it was best for dame to get traded. We knew he wanted to stay here his whole career, but we obviously wanted better for him since we wasted his whole prime here. So if he had gone straight to Cronin with a list of several contenders he would be ok being traded to, and asked Cronin to start looking for a deal, then none of this shit would have had to go down. But dame decided to listen to his dumbass agent and pull off a wildly unprofessional career arc.</p>

But people rightfully thought it was bullshit how he and his agent were handling it.</p>

<p>I do feel like Mike conceded too much/accepted a subpar offer, but in all fairness to our pass-first point guard Mike Richman, he was arguing 2 against 1 while under the cloud of Dame’s agent declaring the Dame would immediately request a trade if sent anywhere other than Miami. </p>

<p>I’ll also confess that I may have taken some joy when on a later Locked On NBA podcast covering the Dame to Milwaukee trade hosted by the Miami host, that Miami host had a mini-breakdown and tried to declare that the Bucks offer was worse than the Miami offer.</p>

You had Kevin O’Boston writing articles about how a trade for Miamis young guys would be the worst trade of all time and the Portland ended up getting a bunch of guys whose bodies don’t function from Boston. The cognitive dissonance is astounding.</p>

      <label for="lse4r1x" class="commentText"><p>Is it the Miami &ldquo;media machine&rdquo; or just free agent agents doing their job and hyping up a destination that is popular for players, but not for other GMs?</p>

<p>I feel like there is a lot of &ldquo;leveraging the aura of Pat Riley against other GMs&rdquo; at play here, and that&rsquo;s why we end up with Dame listing us as a desired destination, knowing damn well he wouldn&rsquo;t end up here. It&rsquo;s just to raise their price.</p>

<p>I was never under the delusion that we could land Dame. And it&rsquo;s because of the league-wide impression that Riley is always going to win the deal. No, we don&rsquo;t always win the trade. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s just about filling needs. But in the case of Portland, their GM was so shook by Pat&rsquo;s aura that he shot the franchise in the foot.</p>

      <label for="lsea7a3" class="commentText"><p>Nah. Ayton played through our late season tank and has played every preseason game while our other vets have sat. The team is clearly gauging his chemistry with the new young core and he seems pretty happy to be here.  So far, fans and FO have been satisfied with the results. If something changes, the Pelicans or another team lacking a real center will trade for him. Everything&rsquo;s gravy over here. 😎</p>
