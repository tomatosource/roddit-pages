      <label for="lse010a" class="commentText"><p>It felt like the tipping point where there was definitely a 0% chance Lillard would be dealt to Miami was when Dame’s agent was calling other teams telling them to stop submitting offers and that he wouldn’t report to them if traded there.</p>

<p>Whether or not Miami was in cahoots with Dame’s agent in that (they probably were), Portland felt like they were actively trying to take all agency away from the Blazers and forcing them to take the Miami offer for Lillard.</p>

<p>It is genuinely impressive that Portland got as good of an offer for Dame as they did, given how much Lillard and the Heat were trying to depress his value.</p>

<p>There is no “Miami media”.  On the other hand Bill Simmons, Portnoy and all the New England-based staffers that power ESPN have made millions off of non-stop Celtics coverage (a team that’s only won two titles during the <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> sports media era.)
Bill himself is usually the only big mouth who talks a lot about the Heat.</p>

<p>So from Miami&rsquo;s standpoint whether or not they pissed Portland off was irrelevant, that trade was not happening unless they managed to scare other suitors off and be the only offer on the table. Good effort by Miami, I can see why they gave it a go.</p>

<p>Blazers got pissed at the shitty bully tactics and went somewhere else. Now, did Miami freak out and try to give more realistic offers as the situation progressed? We&rsquo;ll never really know, but given Reilly&rsquo;s track record, I doubt they ever really ponied up something that made sense for blazers.</p>

<p>Yes, which is why I clearly said that package was &ldquo;the best possible package Miami could have offered&rdquo; not that they actually offered it. The first sentence of the comment I replied to said: &ldquo;Realistically Miami never had the assets to pull that trade off.&rdquo; Did you not read those?</p>

      <label for="lse7nxk" class="commentText"><p>I read it and felt compelled to respond because your comment is silly. OP is talking realistic, and you come in with some wild trade that was never on the table and say, quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You think trading Lillard for that package would have been worse than trading him for Grayson Allen, Jrue, 1 pick, and useless swaps that won&rsquo;t convey?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As if if this was a realistic thing? If you&rsquo;re just being completely hypothetical, it&rsquo;s still kind of a silly response. &ldquo;Well, team XYZ could have topped Miami&rsquo;s best offer, so why didn&rsquo;t we take that?&rdquo; Not on the table. Not &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; which as you point out was the framework for this convo.</p>

<p>The point OP was making, the main point, was that Miami couldn&rsquo;t or reasonably wouldn&rsquo;t make an offer to get Dame.</p>

The closest there ever was to a credible report of Miami&rsquo;s actual offer was from Marc Spears like the week of the trade to Milwaukee and it was pretty vague.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On July 1, ESPN reported that Lillard requested a trade, with his preferred destination being the Miami Heat. In the nearly three months since that request became public, no substantial trade conversations have taken place between the two teams, sources said.<br>
The Heat initially offered a trade package that included sharpshooter Tyler Herro and two first-round draft picks, a source said.</p>

      <label for="lse4r1x" class="commentText"><p>Is it the Miami &ldquo;media machine&rdquo; or just free agent agents doing their job and hyping up a destination that is popular for players, but not for other GMs?</p>

<p>I feel like there is a lot of &ldquo;leveraging the aura of Pat Riley against other GMs&rdquo; at play here, and that&rsquo;s why we end up with Dame listing us as a desired destination, knowing damn well he wouldn&rsquo;t end up here. It&rsquo;s just to raise their price.</p>

<p>I was never under the delusion that we could land Dame. And it&rsquo;s because of the league-wide impression that Riley is always going to win the deal. No, we don&rsquo;t always win the trade. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s just about filling needs. But in the case of Portland, their GM was so shook by Pat&rsquo;s aura that he shot the franchise in the foot.</p>

      <label for="lse1xga" class="commentText"><p>They got Ayton, Robert Williams, Brogdon (who they’ve flipped for Avdija on a great deal) and Camara (who’s looking like the steal of the trade), and 2 first round picks. They were also able to move off Nurks contract.</p>

<p>How is this a bad trade? What was the better option?</p>

      <label for="lse57gm" class="commentText"><p>They needed Grayson Allen in the deal to make it work. Maybe Miami throws a guy in too so it’s moot, still Ayton is younger, can be a trade chip moving forward, and gives you more than Nurk does at this point.</p>

      <label for="lse5sq1" class="commentText"><p>Ayton is no trade chip. Blazers are clearly already done with him that’s why they drafted his replacement  after one season with him. The Miami Heat trade where they would’ve gotten Jaime Jacquez was clearly the best trade option he would’ve been the best player they acquired.</p>

      <label for="lse4nji" class="commentText"><p>That haul for Damian Lillard is embarrassing. Anyone who thinks that was the best they could pull off is lying to themselves. Cronin is just a bum and people wanted to cheer him on because they hate Miami and thought he was actually sticking it to us. All the miami trade reports ended up being false, the media Bill is talking about was not the Miami media.</p>

      <label for="lse5nwu" class="commentText"><p>We got fucked. The market was fucked when Dame and his agent refused to play anywhere but Miami. All we would get at that point were low ball offers. Also, there were fair questions about dames age, contract, and defense.</p>

<p>So yeah, would have loved to get more, but you&rsquo;re missing the circumstances in which the trade happened. </p>

      <label for="lse2hse" class="commentText"><p>And we should have traded for Miami&rsquo;s worse offer? What?</p>

<p>If the return we got was bad, it&rsquo;s in part because of the shenanigans Dame&rsquo;s agent and media pulled to try and force their way to Miami, who couldn&rsquo;t put up a legit offer otherwise.</p>
