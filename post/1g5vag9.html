      <label for="lse010a" class="commentText"><p>It felt like the tipping point where there was definitely a 0% chance Lillard would be dealt to Miami was when Dame’s agent was calling other teams telling them to stop submitting offers and that he wouldn’t report to them if traded there.</p>

<p>Whether or not Miami was in cahoots with Dame’s agent in that (they probably were), Portland felt like they were actively trying to take all agency away from the Blazers and forcing them to take the Miami offer for Lillard.</p>

<p>It is genuinely impressive that Portland got as good of an offer for Dame as they did, given how much Lillard and the Heat were trying to depress his value.</p>

Might have still got the #1 seed but with a lot more wear and tear, and stars having to play heavy minutes late in the season to lock up home court advantage.</p>

<p>Plus, Jrue was so incredibly valuable in a switching defense</p>

      <label for="lsehx4h" class="commentText"><p>Brogdon and Timelord would be Celtics in this scenario. So no, not everyone would be taking more minutes. Keep in mind that Porzingis would still be on the team. In fact, I’d argue everyone would take on less minutes because we sent out 2 players for 1 (Jrue). Plus we probably would’ve made another trade for a guard anyways considering Brogdon wasn’t ever going to stay after the summer trade fiasco</p>

      <label for="lsenaee" class="commentText"><p>I swear jrue was not very good/looked like he did in a lot of bucks playoffs runs until partway through the ECF. He was great after that.</p>

<p>I’m not trying to shit on the Celtics because it’s so tiring to argue, but the Celtics legit did have an easy run to the finals (relatively) and I thought the Mavs were weaker than the twolves and thunder. Jokic would’ve been better than any of the Mavs players against them too. I say this all to say, yes, I think they would’ve won without jrue.</p>

<p>But I also know I’m gonna have people responding saying I’m salty about the jrue trade (I’m not, I’ll make that trade <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> times) and bring up our nets series (disregarding the bucks, sixers, knicks were decimated last playoffs)</p>

<p>But also my bad I was thinking about the early 2010s teams too but obviously not the same.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Is your memory so bad that you forgot 2023 was a 7 game series as well?  And that Tatum rolled his ankle on literally the first play?  Sure a healthy Tatum isn&rsquo;t a guaranteed win, but there&rsquo;s good reason the Celtics were favored by Vegas in that game.  Also 2020 was a 6 game series.  Literally no dominant series wins for either side this era.</p>

I’m not sure how you’d monitor/enforce the difference between a player requesting a trade or just being traded.</p>

<p>On top of that, a no-trade clause allows players to say no to a trade. If it was some type of can’t-be-traded clause, I’m not sure the team would want to lose that flexibility</p>

Its only gotten to this point because star players have high profile examples that they cant trust owners to prioritise rewarding loyalty and trying to keep those players and build around them</p>

<p>So from Miami&rsquo;s standpoint whether or not they pissed Portland off was irrelevant, that trade was not happening unless they managed to scare other suitors off and be the only offer on the table. Good effort by Miami, I can see why they gave it a go.</p>

<p>Blazers got pissed at the shitty bully tactics and went somewhere else. Now, did Miami freak out and try to give more realistic offers as the situation progressed? We&rsquo;ll never really know, but given Reilly&rsquo;s track record, I doubt they ever really ponied up something that made sense for blazers.</p>

<p>Yes, which is why I clearly said that package was &ldquo;the best possible package Miami could have offered&rdquo; not that they actually offered it. The first sentence of the comment I replied to said: &ldquo;Realistically Miami never had the assets to pull that trade off.&rdquo; Did you not read those?</p>

      <label for="lse7nxk" class="commentText"><p>I read it and felt compelled to respond because your comment is silly. OP is talking realistic, and you come in with some wild trade that was never on the table and say, quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You think trading Lillard for that package would have been worse than trading him for Grayson Allen, Jrue, 1 pick, and useless swaps that won&rsquo;t convey?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As if if this was a realistic thing? If you&rsquo;re just being completely hypothetical, it&rsquo;s still kind of a silly response. &ldquo;Well, team XYZ could have topped Miami&rsquo;s best offer, so why didn&rsquo;t we take that?&rdquo; Not on the table. Not &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; which as you point out was the framework for this convo.</p>

<p>The point OP was making, the main point, was that Miami couldn&rsquo;t or reasonably wouldn&rsquo;t make an offer to get Dame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The best possible package Miami could have offered if they went all-in for Dame&rdquo; makes it very clear that the package I am about to present is a hypothetical. That was the first sentence of my comment that you originally replied to. The point I was replying to was also a hypothetical (&ldquo;Miami never had the assets to pull that trade off.) How would I respond to that hypothetical without a hypothetical lmao?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not on the table. Not &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; which as you point out was the framework for this convo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that was your takeaway from the sentence &ldquo;Realistically Miami never had the assets to pull that trade off&rdquo; and the rest of that comment, you badly misread it. If you still don&rsquo;t understand how, you badly need to work on your reading comprehension. I&rsquo;m pretty sure you&rsquo;re just intentionally misrepresenting everything though lol because it would be weird for you to have perfect writing but middle school level reading comprehension.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>OP</strong>: Realistically, Miami never had the assets to pull that trade off. You had Herro who, due to his contract, is a neutral asset and whole bag of nothing. When you compare that to the actual haul Portland got, you see how far away Miami really was. So from Miami&rsquo;s standpoint whether or not they pissed Portland off was irrelevant, that trade was not happening unless they managed to scare other suitors off and be the only offer on the table. Good effort by Miami, I can see why they gave it a go.<br>
<strong>You</strong>: The point OP was making, the main point, was that Miami couldn&rsquo;t or reasonably wouldn&rsquo;t make an offer to get Dame.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The guy is clearly saying Miami did not have the ability to put together a competitive package for him even if they offered all of their assets outside of Jimmy and Bam lol. There is no ambiguity in that comment. This was also the prevailing narrative by the national media and Blazers fans throughout summer 2023 for some reason.</p>

<p>Sure if you want to count all related trades, the full package was Dame, Nurkic, Little, Keon Johnson for Ayton, Brogdon, Rob Williams, Camara and 3 picks. If you want to loop in the Brogdon + 2 picks for Deni trade (probably should if you&rsquo;re counting the Jrue return as part of the package, no?) the return changes to Ayton, Rob Williams, Avdija, and 1 pick. Speaking of getting off contracts, if Portland didn&rsquo;t have to salary dump Brogdon as part of the Avdija trade to cut their luxury tax bill (if they traded for Lowry&rsquo;s expiring contract instead of Brogdon&rsquo;s <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>45</sub> contract, as they would have in this hypothetical), they probably could have traded less draft capital for Avdija</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And yeah there is what they could have offered but from the sounds of it they wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, like I said that was &ldquo;the best possible package Miami could have offered.&rdquo; It has been widely reported the 2 teams hardly negotiated/spoke over the summer. That package I mentioned was definitely not offered by Miami at any point.</p>

What was reported was Miami sent an initial offer to cronin at the start of the summer and cronin never got back, at all.  There was never a negotiation, Miami had plenty of assets to move but there was never a talk.  The only talk was media and fans b/c it&rsquo;s the offseason and no one had anything better to talk about.</p>

They&rsquo;ll count Brogdon, plus the picks, plus Deni who cost them Brogdon and the picks.

      <label for="lseruie" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not goalpost moving lol. When the assets used in the trade are all moved for other items it becomes a part of the &ldquo;haul&rdquo; just like when trades are done and years later you start putting players in place the draft picks that were used on them.</p>

<p>When discussing the &ldquo;haul&rdquo; the blazers got for Dame it is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Deni</li>
<li>Rob Williams</li>
<li>Ayton</li>
<li>Camara</li>
<li>2029 Bos 1st (could possibly be sent to wiz)</li>
<li>2029 Bucks 1st (could possibly be sent to wiz)</li>
<li>2028 and 2030 Bucks 1st Swaps</li>
</ul>

<p>The only things we added in those deals were Keon, Nurk, Nas, and a 2nd. There&rsquo;s a chance maybe some of that happens with the miami deal, maybe it doesn&rsquo;t. Can&rsquo;t say for certain. All we can say is that the rumored miami deal wasn&rsquo;t as good as the actual Milwaukie deal.</p>

<p>Even if he didn’t want Herro because of Simons, Lowry, Jovic, Jaquez, 2 firsts, and some pick swaps is undoubtedly better than the garbage they ended up with.</p>

<p>Cronin isn’t worthy of praise in this situation. Miami front office actually deserves more praise for valuing their assets now that Herro, Jovic, and Jaquez are all Top 6 rotation guys on a playoff team.</p>

      <label for="lsesa4h" class="commentText"><p>Derozan is the 1st option and it’ll work because he is a veteran who has playoff experience.</p>

<p>Fox is one of the best 2nd options in the league.</p>

<p>Sabonis is the best 3rd option in the league.</p>

<p>The Kings can be contenders with 3 top 30 players and a ton of good role players.</p>

The closest there ever was to a credible report of Miami&rsquo;s actual offer was from Marc Spears like the week of the trade to Milwaukee and it was pretty vague.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On July 1, ESPN reported that Lillard requested a trade, with his preferred destination being the Miami Heat. In the nearly three months since that request became public, no substantial trade conversations have taken place between the two teams, sources said.<br>
The Heat initially offered a trade package that included sharpshooter Tyler Herro and two first-round draft picks, a source said.</p>

<p>I do feel like Mike conceded too much/accepted a subpar offer, but in all fairness to our pass-first point guard Mike Richman, he was arguing 2 against 1 while under the cloud of Dame’s agent declaring the Dame would immediately request a trade if sent anywhere other than Miami. </p>

<p>I’ll also confess that I may have taken some joy when on a later Locked On NBA podcast covering the Dame to Milwaukee trade hosted by the Miami host, that Miami host had a mini-breakdown and tried to declare that the Bucks offer was worse than the Miami offer.</p>

      <label for="lsetpdz" class="commentText"><p>Fuck the front office, we lost the best player the Blazers have seen since The Glyde because they wouldn&rsquo;t build a team around him.  We had a chance, just a chance, in 2018.  But we got fucked by injuries.  And we never really capitalized on that.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so depressing.  I have been a Blazers fan since I was 7, going to games in the Memorial Coliseum with my Grandpa.  Was there for the Finals against the Bulls, Game 4.  Got to see Drexler vs Jordan first hand.  And also of 2016, I am now a part of the production team as either a spot op or house lights op for games.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure where I am going with this, I&rsquo;m day drinking before the preseason game tomorrow.  RIP CITY!</p>

<p>He didn’t even give a list of like 3 teams. Nope just one. Dumbest shit ever, no team would ever bend over for their guy like that. That’s just bad business.</p>

<p>Dame took a huge dump on his legacy here after he handled that summer. Real bummer. Dude spent over a decade building his entire brand on loyalty. Stay loyal to the soil was basically his motto.</p>

<p>And listen, most of us would agree it was best for dame to get traded. We knew he wanted to stay here his whole career, but we obviously wanted better for him since we wasted his whole prime here. So if he had gone straight to Cronin with a list of several contenders he would be ok being traded to, and asked Cronin to start looking for a deal, then none of this shit would have had to go down. But dame decided to listen to his dumbass agent and pull off a wildly unprofessional career arc.</p>

But people rightfully thought it was bullshit how he and his agent were handling it.</p>

      <label for="lse4r1x" class="commentText"><p>Is it the Miami &ldquo;media machine&rdquo; or just free agent agents doing their job and hyping up a destination that is popular for players, but not for other GMs?</p>

<p>I feel like there is a lot of &ldquo;leveraging the aura of Pat Riley against other GMs&rdquo; at play here, and that&rsquo;s why we end up with Dame listing us as a desired destination, knowing damn well he wouldn&rsquo;t end up here. It&rsquo;s just to raise their price.</p>

<p>I was never under the delusion that we could land Dame. And it&rsquo;s because of the league-wide impression that Riley is always going to win the deal. No, we don&rsquo;t always win the trade. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s just about filling needs. But in the case of Portland, their GM was so shook by Pat&rsquo;s aura that he shot the franchise in the foot.</p>
