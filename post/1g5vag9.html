      <label for="lse010a" class="commentText"><p>It felt like the tipping point where there was definitely a 0% chance Lillard would be dealt to Miami was when Dame’s agent was calling other teams telling them to stop submitting offers and that he wouldn’t report to them if traded there.</p>

<p>Whether or not Miami was in cahoots with Dame’s agent in that (they probably were), Portland felt like they were actively trying to take all agency away from the Blazers and forcing them to take the Miami offer for Lillard.</p>

<p>It is genuinely impressive that Portland got as good of an offer for Dame as they did, given how much Lillard and the Heat were trying to depress his value.</p>

      <label for="lse6yye" class="commentText"><p>Yup the Heat’s offer was never all that they <em>could have offered</em> people just assume it was despite no reporting or rumors that they did.  Jaquez was NEVER on the table in any capacity, Jovic was but the Heat were removing a 1st from their offer</p>

<p>Bucks made a bigger offer than the Heat were willing to make</p>

      <label for="lsennc1" class="commentText"><p>lol yup. Saw people the other day going “The Heat offer of Jaquez, Jovic, Herro, and 1sts was much better!” Like that wasn’t the offer, that’s just everything the Heat basically could put on the table (that didn’t involve Bam and Jimmy), so people assumed that must have been what was turned down.</p>

      <label for="lseva9q" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, a lot of us Heat fans assumed the team was lowballing the Blazers, we&rsquo;re pretty used to how Riley operates, and we were all annoyed that the team was lowballing for <em>Damian Lillard</em>, who also addresses basically our biggest roster hole for the past 4 years. Other Heat fans didn&rsquo;t assume that though, which made the discourse pretty obnoxious.</p>

The silent majority of Miami sports fans are pretty reasonable but get absolutely overwhelmed by the aggressive vocal minority. Most of us are even more tired of arguing with these Miami fans than you guys are after years of it. I can&rsquo;t count the amount of times I&rsquo;ve had to silently nod along as a random acquaintance at a friend&rsquo;s party or work event went on a rant about how the Heat need to fire Spo/Riley for not trading Dexter Pittman for Dwight Howard. That shit gets exhausting as you guys know lol.</p>

      <label for="lseasqp" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think so. Horford would have been starting at the 4, and Jaylen Brown starting at shooting guard. Everyone would have taken on more minutes. Might have still got the #1 seed but with a lot more wear and tear, and stars having to play heavy minutes late in the season to lock up home court advantage.</p>

<p>Plus, Jrue was so incredibly valuable in a switching defense</p>

<p>I think Boston has a tougher time winning at the clip they did all season and definitely had a tougher time against Dallas in the finals.</p>

      <label for="lsenaee" class="commentText"><p>I swear jrue was not very good/looked like he did in a lot of bucks playoffs runs until partway through the ECF. He was great after that.</p>

<p>I’m not trying to shit on the Celtics because it’s so tiring to argue, but the Celtics legit did have an easy run to the finals (relatively) and I thought the Mavs were weaker than the twolves and thunder. Jokic would’ve been better than any of the Mavs players against them too. I say this all to say, yes, I think they would’ve won without jrue.</p>

<p>But I also know I’m gonna have people responding saying I’m salty about the jrue trade (I’m not, I’ll make that trade <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> times) and bring up our nets series (disregarding the bucks, sixers, knicks were decimated last playoffs)</p>

      <label for="lsh5jdn" class="commentText"><p>The whole easy run thing doesn&rsquo;t make any sense because that&rsquo;s accounted for in the results. they won over 60 games when the Easter conference was healthy. And then they completely blew the doors off all of the teams in East.</p>

<p>I could understand this criticism if they struggled to get past these injured teams and then you might actually wonder if the Celtics were really the best team or if they just got lucky.</p>

<p>But you had like a 110 game sample size where they dominated everyone whether they were healthy or not.</p>

<p>meanwhile, they were missing their starting center/ borderline All-Star player for 85% of the playoffs and they still barely had to break a sweat to win it all</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just such a joke how some fans try to pretend like they were a fluke.</p>

<p>And I would make the argument that durability is a strength and an asset. but the The Celtics had injury issues in the playoffs and still blew everyone&rsquo;s doors off.</p>

<p>We were hearing whispers leaking from the blazers front office that GMs from all over the league were begging Portland NOT to trade Dame to Miami, because of that leak from his agent warning other teams not to try for him.</p>

<p>If you remember correctly Adam Silver came out pretty quickly and made that statement that that was not okay.</p>

<p>During that whole dame drama other teams fan bases were loudly rooting for us to not trade Dame to Miami.</p>

<p>And the whole time Miami fans were brigading everywhere calling us trash and worthless and stupid and that it was our obligation to trade Dame to them for their shit package.</p>

<p>We already have gotten back way way way way more than Tyler Herro and two garbage firsts.</p>

<p>The entitlement of Miami fans last summer was really weird. They still haven’t gotten over it it feels like.</p>

<p>Asking Blazers to trade their franchise legend will go one of two ways, and it was handled poorly by Dame’s agent (&amp; likely others). It could have been a wonderful parting, in question of the title Blazers wouldn’t be able to deliver in his last few years, but the leaking to the media and rhetoric from all sides made it bitter, really quick. No need to come in here and make things worse by being involved.</p>

<p>Heat were definitely low-balling and Herro was redundant in Portland, because of the players they had. It was on Heat to turn him into something of value for the Blazers.</p>

<p>Just playing devil&rsquo;s advocate, in the power balance between teams/front office and the players.</p>

<p>Fans seem to be against the players when they request a trade, but are neutral to teams/front office when they trade players.</p>

      <label for="lsetocm" class="commentText"><p>I get where you’re coming from with this, but the side effect of that would be in situations where the player didn’t request a trade, a la KAT. no reason he should lose part of his salary because he’s traded (for the record I’m assuming he’s a super max player but i haven’t actually looked it up, so that might not be a perfect example). I’m not sure how you’d monitor/enforce the difference between a player requesting a trade or just being traded.</p>

<p>On top of that, a no-trade clause allows players to say no to a trade. If it was some type of can’t-be-traded clause, I’m not sure the team would want to lose that flexibility</p>

<p>The no-trade clause is actually meant to be a little onerous because it means that teams have to treat these deals as the creation of partnership with the player rather than retention of an asset they can move on from if things don&rsquo;t work out how they want.</p>

      <label for="lsf4cco" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s mostly due to cross-federation deals, where existing contracts are bought out and new contracts are signed, rather than typical intra-league trades that are common in US sports, not because Euro leagues are pro-labor. Intra-league trades are trading the contract itself, so a player can&rsquo;t refuse to play for the new team since he&rsquo;s still bound by his original contract.</p>

<p>International football players have more agency because they can refuse to sign the new contract, killing any transfer with which they disagree. Teams still have plenty of power over the non-superstar players, but top 20 players can dictate which team they wish to play for, assuming that team also wants (and can afford to pay) them.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what this sub swore would happen with the current CBA lol. Contrary to popular belief(or more so cope)owners are pretty happy with where the league is right now and don&rsquo;t particularly care as long as the money keeps flowing.</p>

<p>The two biggest sports media/podcasting networks are The Ringer and Barstool both founded by Boston guys and heavily lean Boston, to put it mildly.</p>

<p>And when the rumored trade package went down, it was Boston media throwing a fit, saying Portland was getting robbed.  They spoiled the well, and ironically Miamis package wound up being better than the one they got imo.</p>

<p>I like Simmons a lot more than Lebetard, but if there&rsquo;s a annoying media machine swaying their power, it&rsquo;s 100% coming from Boston. We just saw it again with Tatums Olympic benching 😂</p>

<p>Compared to who? I specifically remember when Russ asked for a trade after we traded PG and there was plenty of &ldquo;mutual interest between Miami and Russ&rdquo; which was obviously coming from the Miami side and they definitely weren&rsquo;t offering anything of value.</p>

<p>Then we get CP3 and the same thing happens where there is &ldquo;mutual interest&rdquo; but Miami was putting out that they wanted one of their picks (which we owned) back. That was also coming from the Miami side and not the OKC side.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t really seem like they are that tight lipped at all&hellip;</p>

A lot hinged on Miami getting a pinky promise of CP3 opting out the PO (lol) which was never gonna happen AND Presti swapping a pick. They never pursued it past that. But reporters still ran the CP3 to Heat a lot that summer.</p>

<p>Miami always get pulled into big name trades because they never leak anything.</p>

<p>See the Dame package. Heat offered one substantial packaged that was interpreted different by everyone. Even Heat fans/reporters. In the end, it wasn’t even substantial last Herro, picks, and salary fillers.</p>

<p>So from Miami&rsquo;s standpoint whether or not they pissed Portland off was irrelevant, that trade was not happening unless they managed to scare other suitors off and be the only offer on the table. Good effort by Miami, I can see why they gave it a go.</p>

<p>I do feel like Mike conceded too much/accepted a subpar offer, but in all fairness to our pass-first point guard Mike Richman, he was arguing 2 against 1 while under the cloud of Dame’s agent declaring the Dame would immediately request a trade if sent anywhere other than Miami. </p>

<p>I’ll also confess that I may have taken some joy when on a later Locked On NBA podcast covering the Dame to Milwaukee trade hosted by the Miami host, that Miami host had a mini-breakdown and tried to declare that the Bucks offer was worse than the Miami offer.</p>

<p>And honestly sounds like anything we would have gotten back the pick or Scoot would have left us in no-man&rsquo;s land. Our team was just too bad for another player to get us winning again. Dame probably would have bailed anyway (divorce and losing still) and we&rsquo;d have lost a good pick in what was supposed to be a good draft.</p>

Crazy to see what Utah got for Gobert and Mitchell,  or Nets for Bridges and we got&hellip;sort of fucked by Dame/his agent?</p>

<p>I dunno, my non-blazer fan friends were quick to point at Dame&rsquo;s age, contract, and non-existent defense, so maybe I overestimated.</p>

The closest there ever was to a credible report of Miami&rsquo;s actual offer was from Marc Spears like the week of the trade to Milwaukee and it was pretty vague.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On July 1, ESPN reported that Lillard requested a trade, with his preferred destination being the Miami Heat. In the nearly three months since that request became public, no substantial trade conversations have taken place between the two teams, sources said.<br>
The Heat initially offered a trade package that included sharpshooter Tyler Herro and two first-round draft picks, a source said.</p>

<p>In comparison, Jaquez was arguably the 3rd best rookie, Jovic shot 40% and became a stretch PF starter for the Heat, and Tyler Herro could be flipped for an additional first by say the Nets. Plus the Blazers still would’ve gotten Ayton facilitating the trade</p>

      <label for="lsetpdz" class="commentText"><p>Fuck the front office, we lost the best player the Blazers have seen since The Glyde because they wouldn&rsquo;t build a team around him.  We had a chance, just a chance, in 2018.  But we got fucked by injuries.  And we never really capitalized on that.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so depressing.  I have been a Blazers fan since I was 7, going to games in the Memorial Coliseum with my Grandpa.  Was there for the Finals against the Bulls, Game 4.  Got to see Drexler vs Jordan first hand.  And also of 2016, I am now a part of the production team as either a spot op or house lights op for games.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure where I am going with this, I&rsquo;m day drinking before the preseason game tomorrow.  RIP CITY!</p>
