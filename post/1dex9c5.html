      </div>
      <label for="l8f0l12" class="commentText"><p>almost every great has at least one big blemish on their resume, and last night was the first significant one of Luka’s career. in the biggest game of his life, not only did he have a mediocre scoring night (finishing the game with 16 points on <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> shooting and 0/4 from 3 after his quick 11-point start), but all his worst habits were on full display for the world to see: baiting for calls, jawing at the refs, letting up buckets by not getting back on defense, allowing blow-bys and losing his assignment off the ball, committing silly frustration fouls, and ultimately exiting the game with an extremely unwise attempt to draw a charge when his team had a chance to steal the win late. this Finals has genuinely been an all-time bad defensive display from Luka, and last night was extra poor timing for him to have <em>that</em> kind of game, seeing that Kyrie finally managed to wake up as a scorer. his frustration couldn’t have been clearer in his body language and that lack of poise affected the Mavericks as a whole. stark difference compared to the Celtics last night and highlighted the experience gap between these teams in terms of handling the emotions of high-leverage playoff moments. until he eventually gets over the hump, this moment and series will follow him</p>

<p>on the flipside the lessons Boston has learned from years of failure were evident last night. they rode the emotional rollercoaster of the game perfectly, didn’t panic when Dallas got out to a fast start, didn’t overreact to bad calls, and didn’t let the rope go when the Mavs made their furious run in the 4th. the Celtics defense was outstanding after a slow start to the game, forcing Luka and Kyrie into a ton of tough shots even when they got the matchup they wanted; particularly, Xavier Tillman’s ability to come off the bench and provide size while still effectively guarding Luka on switches was massive for filling the gap left by Porzingis’ absence. Jayson Tatum and Sam Hauser were key in keeping Boston afloat in the first half before Jaylen Brown absolutely took over the second half with a signature performance (ofc, with significant contributions from the Stock Exchange, as has been tradition this postseason). clutch shotmaking from everywhere on the floor, great passing and rebounding, outstanding individual defense, just a virtuoso game from Brown that will likely earn him a well-deserved Finals MVP</p>

<p>some final notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Boston is still having way too much ease generating good looks from 3, getting up another 46 last night after shooting 42 and 39 in the first two games. you will never beat the Celtics when you allow that kind of 3P volume</li>
<li>Mavs other guys played better at home but it’s still painfully obvious that most of them have very little confidence when it comes to attacking closeouts and shooting the 3, and they’ve simply been undisciplined as a unit. PJ’s foul on Holiday in the backcourt was brutal and completely unnecessary</li>
<li>THJ minutes last night were a crazy gamble that I could get behind given the Mavs need for an offensive spark, but Kidd putting him back in when Luka fouled out was mind-boggling. as soon as it was evident he didn’t have his shot that night his ass should’ve been glued to the bench. Exum’s shooting, handling, defense and pace would’ve made way more sense in that moment and honestly I thought he should have gotten more of a chance throughout the game</li>
</ul>

      <label for="l8exmrx" class="commentText"><p>You have to admit it did not look good with how many Celtics players looked like they were playing straight CTE ball in the fourth. But a 20 point hole is tough to overcome even in the modern NBA, and the Celtics did enough work in the third to ensure they won out.</p>

<p>Credit to Brown and White for making some big plays at the end to ice the Mavs. On the Mavs part, they definitely have not looked like the strong second half team they typically are, but a lot of that credit has to go to the Celtics defense slowly eroding their energy over the course of each game.</p>

      <label for="l8f14bo" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s also important to note how much a strong defensive performance seems to feed an offense too. It&rsquo;s no surprise that the Mavs started getting good looks when their defense was dialed in during the 4th. But there just wasn&rsquo;t enough left in the tank for the last 3-4 minutes of the game, and Luka fouling out snuffed out the last ounce of energy they had.</p>

      <label for="l8ex2lx" class="commentText"><p>The clutch gene seems to have disappeared for the Mavs, despite that being how they got here. Had all of the momentum on their side going into the last 5 minutes and the shots stop falling, Kidd starts taking odd timeouts, and they can&rsquo;t get timely stops. The Kyrie fadeaway 3 was the only time I felt like they really missed Luka offensively. And they should&rsquo;ve been <em>better</em> on defense without him. They can&rsquo;t put together a full 48</p>

      <label for="l8ez71s" class="commentText"><p>Is this really it for the Mavs? They came out on top of the west, which was by no argument, the tougher conference. This Celtics team really only has depth on the Thunder/Timbs. I expected more disruption of their offense. Instead, they’re letting the Celtics easily pass the ball into the next shot on each possession. Talk about a cakewalk.</p>

      <label for="l8f5w57" class="commentText"><p>One more win and the C&rsquo;s solidify a pretty historic run. Would be interesting to start compiling where their accomplishments rank in terms of NBA history. Right now, they have a top 5 all-time regular season NetRtg, 2nd fewest losses in the playoffs since they went to a 7-7-7-7 format, one of the longest winning streaks in playoff history, and have a +11.4 NetRtg in the Finals.</p>

<p>They may have a resume for a top 5-10 team all-time for a single season.</p>

      <label for="l8f1v3x" class="commentText"><p>impressive that Celtics have held them under a 100 each game</p>

<p>but gotta give Dallas&rsquo;s defense some credit too, have held the Celtics to just  107, 105, 106 points in the three games</p>

<p>holding the best offense in the league to league average is impressive on their part</p>

<p>what they&rsquo;re missing really is just that 5th starter, and given what their team looks like, Kyrie/Luka/PJ/Lively, that&rsquo;s your 4 30+ min guys</p>

<p>that last guy is becoming pretty clear on what type of player it has to be, reliable shooter, a KCP type would be amazing for them</p>

      <label for="l8f6gt2" class="commentText"><p>Yeah and the Celtics have had some miracle 3s go in too. Pritchard&rsquo;s heave in game 2, White&rsquo;s banked 3 last night, and a few others.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a ton but I think people are overrating how many open shots the Celtics are getting.</p>

<p>the problem really has just been the shooting, 26% on open and wide open threes</p>
