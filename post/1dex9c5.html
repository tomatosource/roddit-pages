      <label for="l8f0l12" class="commentText"><p>almost every great has at least one big blemish on their resume, and last night was the first significant one of Luka’s career. in the biggest game of his life, not only did he have a mediocre scoring night (finishing the game with 16 points on <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> shooting and 0/4 from 3 after his quick 11-point start), but all his worst habits were on full display for the world to see: baiting for calls, jawing at the refs, letting up buckets by not getting back on defense, allowing blow-bys and losing his assignment off the ball, committing silly frustration fouls, and ultimately exiting the game with an extremely unwise attempt to draw a charge when his team had a chance to steal the win late. this Finals has genuinely been an all-time bad defensive display from Luka, and last night was extra poor timing for him to have <em>that</em> kind of game, seeing that Kyrie finally managed to wake up as a scorer. his frustration couldn’t have been clearer in his body language and that lack of poise affected the Mavericks as a whole. stark difference compared to the Celtics last night and highlighted the experience gap between these teams in terms of handling the emotions of high-leverage playoff moments. until he eventually gets over the hump, this moment and series will follow him</p>

<p>on the flipside the lessons Boston has learned from years of failure were evident last night. they rode the emotional rollercoaster of the game perfectly, didn’t panic when Dallas got out to a fast start, didn’t let themselves get rattled by bad calls, and didn’t let the rope go when the Mavs made their furious run in the 4th. the Celtics defense was outstanding after a slow start to the game, forcing Luka and Kyrie into a ton of tough shots even when they got the matchup they wanted; particularly, Xavier Tillman’s ability to come off the bench and provide size while still effectively guarding Luka on switches was massive for filling the gap left by Porzingis’ absence. Jayson Tatum and Sam Hauser were key in keeping Boston afloat in the first half before Jaylen Brown absolutely took over the second half with a signature performance (ofc, with significant contributions from the Stock Exchange, as has been tradition this postseason). clutch shotmaking from everywhere on the floor, great passing and rebounding, outstanding individual defense, just a virtuoso game from Brown that will likely earn him a well-deserved Finals MVP</p>

<p>some final notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Boston is still having way too much ease generating good looks from 3, getting up another 46 last night after shooting 42 and 39 in the first two games. you will never beat the Celtics when you allow that kind of 3P volume</p></li>

<li><p>Mavs other guys played better at home but it’s still painfully obvious that most of them have very little confidence when it comes to attacking closeouts and shooting the 3, and they’ve simply been undisciplined as a unit. PJ’s foul on Holiday in the backcourt was brutal and completely unnecessary</p></li>

<li><p>THJ minutes last night were a crazy gamble that I could get behind given the Mavs need for an offensive spark, but Kidd putting him back in when Luka fouled out was mind-boggling. as soon as it was evident he didn’t have his shot that night his ass should’ve been glued to the bench. Exum’s shooting, handling, defense and pace would’ve made way more sense in that moment and honestly I thought he should have gotten more of a chance throughout the game</p></li>

THAT was his first big blemish to his resume and while this one is still pretty bad, it’s not as bad as whatever tf last season was.</p>

He&rsquo;ll make an expression and be frustrated but he doesn&rsquo;t really jaw. That&rsquo;s honestly Ant lol, Ant is the one who complains and has the techs, not KAT. But even Ant&rsquo;s complaining is nowhere like Luka&rsquo;s</p>

<p>lol I was in person for the WCF games and Luka was literally complaining to refs during the commercial breaks 😂 I was honestly impressed at his dedication lol</p>

      <label for="l8fh8hs" class="commentText"><p>The thing about Luka’s defense is that it seems more about habits than it is about caring and I’m not sure if that’s good news or not. Luka is undoubtedly the best of the young generation bunch for now but he’s letting frustrations bleed into his play too much.</p>

<p>Also the Mavs have been practically making a living out of help defense on their way out of the west, now it’s all torn to shreds. The fact that they can’t get Jones Jr. on the floor consistently because of the lack of offensive spacing is the big killer for their defense and neither Lively nor Gafford can help from serious 3-point shooting bigs.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>If you mean the bad habits regarding his conditioning, particularly in the offseason, then the good news is that it is something that can absolutely be fixed.  The question is, is this series enough to make him start <em>caring</em> about it?</p>

<p>Even 10-15lbs lighter and some regular cardio work in the offseason would do wonders for his ability to keep players in front of him on defense.</p>

      <label for="l8fxri6" class="commentText"><p>Great summary. I can&rsquo;t believe how Celtics snatched Xavier Tillman and Jaden Springer at trade deadline for nothing.</p>

<p>Now Springer is a bench rider, but next year I expect to see him more.</p>

<p>In terms of Luka&rsquo;s baiting calls and arguing with refs, I assume these habits are from his years with Real Madrid. His teammates Llull, Fernandez and Reyes were really good at these as it is easier to get into the heads of referees in FIBA and these habits were vital for them to build a dynasty for Spanish basketball. But this is NBA and referees are harder to manipulate.</p>

      <label for="l8exmrx" class="commentText"><p>You have to admit it did not look good with how many Celtics players looked like they were playing straight CTE ball in the fourth. But a 20 point hole is tough to overcome even in the modern NBA, and the Celtics did enough work in the third to ensure they won out.</p>

<p>Credit to Brown and White for making some big plays at the end to ice the Mavs. On the Mavs part, they definitely have not looked like the strong second half team they typically are, but a lot of that credit has to go to the Celtics defense slowly eroding their energy over the course of each game.</p>

      <label for="l8f14bo" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s also important to note how much a strong defensive performance seems to feed an offense too. It&rsquo;s no surprise that the Mavs started getting good looks when their defense was dialed in during the 4th. But there just wasn&rsquo;t enough left in the tank for the last 3-4 minutes of the game, and Luka fouling out snuffed out the last ounce of energy they had.</p>

<p>You have to admit it did not look good with how many Celtics players looked like they were playing straight CTE ball in the fourth.</p>

<p>Literally everyone but DWhite was having meltdowns. Both Jays, Jrue and Al all had terrible turn overs in that stretch. It finally stopped when they gave DWhite the ball and let him run the offense. But the nice thing about a 20 point lead is you got a lot of cushion to work with and they only needed a few buckets to close it out.</p>

<p>Cs play as a unit on both ends, and bc of this have many different buttons to push vis anything Dallas tries. Mavs can only spam Luka/Kyrie and those guys while great are a) in fact defendable with the right personnel &amp; b) HUGE defensive liabilities for their team. </p>

<p>Particularly satisfying to me is to see Luka be so broadly exposed for his vulnerability on d, so that when we come around to these inane ranking discussions next time around we can actually figure the defensive end of the game into those discussions</p>

<p>This is where the payoff from Ainge handing the reins to Brad comes in.  Putting aside the fact that the trades didn&rsquo;t fit HIS style of preferred roster building, teams were gun-shy to make big trades with him after his fleecing of the Nets years earlier.</p>

<p>Brad had no such history, however.  Couple this with reports that he was going into Ainge&rsquo;s office at least 2 YEARS before taking over in the front office asking Danny to get Jrue, the writing was clearly on the wall when he did become available.</p>

Would be interesting to start compiling where their accomplishments rank in terms of NBA history. Right now, they have a top 5 all-time regular season NetRtg, 2nd fewest losses in the playoffs since they went to a 7-7-7-7 format, one of the longest winning streaks in playoff history, and have a +11.4 NetRtg in the Finals.</p>

<p>They may have a resume for a top 5-10 team all-time for a single season.</p>

<p>This Celtics team really feels like the new age 2015 Warriors for me in many regards, but there’s so much to process about this Celtics team that idk if that’s an understatement or a hyperbole. But I think 2015 Warriors or a level just below that sounds about right.</p>

      <label for="l8g0ylz" class="commentText"><p>This is a good point. Celtics have been in multiple Game 7s and multiple ECFs/Finals, many of which had tight games. Most of the WCF was clutch games and 2 of those losses were primarily because of Wolves mistakes on the last possession (like that Ant TO) because of course a 22 year old is still learning how to run an offense. Then again, Wolves played great in clutch to close out the Suns and in the 2 clutch games in the Nuggets series so idk. Kyrie and Luka are still more experienced and will make less mistakes though.</p>

<p>In the OKC series, Shai was clutch and awesome but the supporting cast looked out of their element and were too young.</p>

People give the Celtics a lot of shit for beating up on easy teams but the Mavs went through mostly teams with no playoff experience. Better maybe but not so demonstrably that the narratives that developed going into game one &ndash;best back court ever, best D in last X games, etc&ndash; almost appeared out of nowhere.</p>

<p>This series feels like the distillation of who both teams have been all year: the Celtics are monsters on both sides but prone to quarters where they get complacent and the Mavs look hottest when they have less sophisticated teams to abuse with their main two.</p>

<p>Miami is always a dogfight for Boston.  That was the one team I DIDN&rsquo;T want them to play because of the injury risk.  My fears were realized when Tingus got hurt. Spoelstra is the basketball coaching equivalent of being the Supermarket Stakeout grand champion with how he can take random pieces and elevate them into a dangerous playoff contender.</p>

<p>Cleveland, I&rsquo;ll give you that one.</p>

<p>Pacers?  That was NOT an easy team to play.  Yes, Boston swept them but 3 of the 4 wins were slugfests that came down to the wire.  Indiana had an offensive powerhouse going all season; they&rsquo;re about 1.5 players and 1-2 years of experience away from being a Finals contender IMO.  All the respect in the world to them.  Bonus that their fans generally aren&rsquo;t asses like many other teams have.</p>

      <label for="l8g48uf" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t know the last game but this is the correct question:</p>

<p>Celtics got <strong>36 wide open</strong> looks from three in first two games, hitting 36%.</p>

<p>Dallas got <strong>24 wide open</strong> looks in those two, hitting 25%.</p>

<p>So, season avarages won&rsquo;t make difference if applied. And remember that rhythm is a thing in play here, too. Besides who are taking the open shots, from where and at which part of the shotclock. All goes agains Dallas. For an example, corner threes:</p>

<p>Celtics got <strong>26 corner threes</strong> in first two games, Dallas got <strong>8 corner threes</strong>.</p>

<p>And maybe most importantly, we were getting easier looks at the rim with that open 3s: Celtics were shooting <strong>83% in the restricted area</strong>, Dallas <strong>72%</strong> with very similar volumes.</p>

<p>That is like having at least two good options every possession, tbh, we weren&rsquo;t running chin actions or pin down screens etc. as we used to do, we didn&rsquo;t need most of them.</p>

<p>All in all, we run the offense as we like, Mavs couldn&rsquo;t. Numbers will tell the same story as the eye test if you look beyond just raw shooting splits.</p>

<p>Just to make it more clear how important it is to get the shots you like, another example: Pacers have been more succesful and lead all playoffs on getting wide open looks from three by an important margin and they sure gave more fight to us just by doing that.</p>

<p>I dont think the mavs are holding the celtics to league average. the celtics are playing at a slower pace and therefore generating fewer looks. ie they shot 82 times last night, compared with their regular season average of 90</p>

      <label for="l8fki0r" class="commentText"><p>Before this season I was wondering how much guard defense still mattered, with so much emphasis on scoring and the challenging whistle defenders face and I figured the jrue &amp; d white backcourt would be the ultimate test to see if &ldquo;defense wins championships&rdquo; or if it truly was now a &ldquo;make or miss league&rdquo;. Very relieved to see that it&rsquo;s being one of, if not the deciding factor in the series. </p>

<p>With Dallas having such a heliocentric offense around it&rsquo;s two guards, the ability to throw them off their game just a little shuts everything down. And while Luka and Kyrie have very different styles, I feel like the strategy for defending them as a team is quite similar (except with Luka you also have to defend a pass) which plays into Boston&rsquo;s hands. While this is made possible through brilliant one on one defense from jrue, white, and jaylen, it&rsquo;s not all them. The one time Dallas has had rhythm and open looks this series, the first quarter of this game, the Celtics defense was stretched out and not rotating. In every other quarter of this game, as well as games 1 and 2, the Celtics have been great at collapsing the paint on drives while simultaneously preventing passes and not biting on fakes. This is made possible by the whole team communicating and switching on the fly, and by Tatum&rsquo;s incredible paint defense. Hes consistently denying multiple options, positioned perfectly, and dominating the boards. Horford has long been a master of positioning and is still one of the best bigs at defending the perimeter, but did have a few terrible misjudgements on rotations giving up easy buckets. </p>

<p>Luka needs to have an all time great game, and Kyrie needs to put up similar shooting numbers again for Dallas to have a chance. Though I must say about Kyrie, even though his box score looks great, I thought his rhythm was very out of sync with what the team needed, though it&rsquo;s not really like they have any other options besides him and luka. </p>

      <label for="l8g3auq" class="commentText"><p>I think one thing this is showing is that perimeter defense is synergistic. A lot of teams have a perimeter defense specialist or two alongside defensively-challenges guards or non-switchable bigs. Luka has shown he can pick apart drop coverage and blitzes, even when both the on-ball and screener defenders are elite in those roles. Holiday and White deserve all the praise they’re getting, but I think the big difference has been Horford/KP/PP holding their own while the Celtics have success against the Mavs’ weaker defenders.</p>

<p>With a win in game 4,</p>

<p>Celtics would surpass the lakers for most titles in nba history with 18.</p>

<p>It will be only the 3rd finals sweep in 20 years. It would be the second time the Celtics swept a finals series with the first being in 1959 when they won their 2nd championship.</p>

<p>If the mavericks get swept, it will be the first time since 2012 and only the second time they got swept in a best of 7 series in  franchise history.</p>

Boston is an amazing team, Dallas crushed teams earlier that just couldn&rsquo;t deal with Kyrie/Luka, especially when they were having better success facilitating other scorers. Dallas is also underperforming bricking wide open shots at an alarming rate even when they get them.</p>

<p>Not really that interesting. BOS is basically the closest thing to a super team. And it doesn&rsquo;t matter that the other team has a superstar when that superstar is clearly injured and the rest of the team is nowhere near as talented as BOS.</p>

<p>A fully healthy DAL team could have taken 1 or 2 games from this BOS team maybe. But with Luka injured even avoiding a sweep is tough.</p>

      <label for="l8ff2m0" class="commentText"><ul>
<li>2 homegrown stars</li>
<li>2 aging pick-ups that didn&rsquo;t have a huge market</li>
<li>Derrick White</li>
<li>A mostly homegrown bench</li>
</ul>

<p>We can&rsquo;t just call good teams super teams or it loses meaning. If they had managed to add Dame or Durant or another superstar in free agency then sure.</p>

<p>I agree though, Dallas was never cut out to win this (even with Luka healthy)</p>

      <label for="l8g3kod" class="commentText"><p>Agree, but my point is that adding Jrue doesn&rsquo;t make you a super team. Adding Dame does. The Celtics didn&rsquo;t add super starts therefore they aren&rsquo;t a super team</p>

      <label for="l8fx66r" class="commentText"><p>They&rsquo;re not wrapping him up in bandages or whatever it is for show I should think.</p>

<p>Being injured doesn&rsquo;t necessary mean that you&rsquo;re not playing. But could be things like being a bit slower and weaker in general. Lack of explosiveness. Lack of being &ldquo;on&rdquo; due to missing practice or intensive practice/workouts due to injury. Keeping up a specific tempo shorter.</p>

<p>Lots of things about injuries that can make you play at way less than 100% (and less long) without having to actually miss games.</p>

<p>And the worst part is that it only gets worse, not better by playing more. You can hopefully play yourself out of a slump even in the same series, but you&rsquo;re not going to magically perform better by playing more through injuries.</p>

<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s why Luka is acting out even more than usual: he knows it&rsquo;ll just get worse and worse for him.</p>

      <label for="l8fls7c" class="commentText"><p>I think Tatum is the best player in the league right now. And I&rsquo;m gonna keep saying it no matter how much I&rsquo;m downvoted. Because he does literally everything, and is anywhere from very good to elite at really every single aspect of the game. And so much of what he does just doesn&rsquo;t show up on the box score, especially this year with us moving to a more 5 out, ball movement offense, and going even harder on the switching defense. Because his gravity is what opens everything up on offense and makes our offense work, and his ability to cover literally anyone while also providing great off ball defense and help defense is basically the key that makes our whole defense work. Not 1 man in this league right now I would rather build a team around. At least for 1 season anyway, not getting into the &lsquo;x player is so much younger&rsquo; question.</p>

      <label for="l8g07zf" class="commentText"><p>idk if I&rsquo;d call him the best player in the league, but he&rsquo;s the least exploitable. what I mean by that is, Tatum doesn&rsquo;t have a weakness that you can exploit with a gameplan</p>

<p>Luka&rsquo;s defense is obviously poor and he has poor conditioning. Jokic isn&rsquo;t as bad as Luka but his defense has been exploited in the past as well. Giannis can&rsquo;t shoot which lets you aggressively play to stop his drive. Embiid has bad stamina, can&rsquo;t stay healthy and is not a good passer out of double teams. SGA doesn&rsquo;t have many weaknesses either but he&rsquo;s not nearly as big as Tatum and can therefore be more vulnerable to mismatch hunting. obviously you need to have the right personnel to take advantage of any of these weaknesses, but they are weaknesses that exist</p>

<p>Tatum&rsquo;s only real weaknesses as a player are that his shooting touch is ridiculously inconsistent, and that he’s not overwhelmingly great at creating good shots for himself. but those aren&rsquo;t things you can gameplan to attack. if you dare Tatum to shoot the ball, you have a realistic chance of him bricking everything, but you also have a realistic chance of ending up on the wrong end of a 50-piece. if you play his jumpshot too aggressively then have fun to trying to stop that 6&rsquo;10&rdquo; muscle-bound freak from getting to the rim and finishing. he&rsquo;s too big and strong for smaller guys, and he&rsquo;s too quick for most big men. if you send double teams or collapse, he is capable of quickly finding the open man and accurately delivering it to him. he can initiate offense out of the post, and he can run PnR and make great decisions out of it both as a handler and as a screener. defensively he&rsquo;s a monster on the glass, you can switch him 1-5, you can&rsquo;t attack him on the perimeter, and most guys aren&rsquo;t gonna be able to back him down either</p>

<p>maybe he&rsquo;s not the best at any one thing, but his 2-way versatility is actually unmatched</p>
