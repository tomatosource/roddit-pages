      <label for="l8f0l12" class="commentText"><p>almost every great has at least one big blemish on their resume, and last night was the first significant one of Luka’s career. in the biggest game of his life, not only did he have a mediocre scoring night (finishing the game with 16 points on <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> shooting and 0/4 from 3 after his quick 11-point start), but all his worst habits were on full display for the world to see: baiting for calls, jawing at the refs, letting up buckets by not getting back on defense, allowing blow-bys and losing his assignment off the ball, committing silly frustration fouls, and ultimately exiting the game with an extremely unwise attempt to draw a charge when his team had a chance to steal the win late. this Finals has genuinely been an all-time bad defensive display from Luka, and last night was extra poor timing for him to have <em>that</em> kind of game, seeing that Kyrie finally managed to wake up as a scorer. his frustration couldn’t have been clearer in his body language and that lack of poise affected the Mavericks as a whole. stark difference compared to the Celtics last night and highlighted the experience gap between these teams in terms of handling the emotions of high-leverage playoff moments. until he eventually gets over the hump, this moment and series will follow him</p>

<p>on the flipside the lessons Boston has learned from years of failure were evident last night. they rode the emotional rollercoaster of the game perfectly, didn’t panic when Dallas got out to a fast start, didn’t overreact to bad calls, and didn’t let the rope go when the Mavs made their furious run in the 4th. the Celtics defense was outstanding after a slow start to the game, forcing Luka and Kyrie into a ton of tough shots even when they got the matchup they wanted; particularly, Xavier Tillman’s ability to come off the bench and provide size while still effectively guarding Luka on switches was massive for filling the gap left by Porzingis’ absence. Jayson Tatum and Sam Hauser were key in keeping Boston afloat in the first half before Jaylen Brown absolutely took over the second half with a signature performance (ofc, with significant contributions from the Stock Exchange, as has been tradition this postseason). clutch shotmaking from everywhere on the floor, great passing and rebounding, outstanding individual defense, just a virtuoso game from Brown that will likely earn him a well-deserved Finals MVP</p>

<p>some final notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Boston is still having way too much ease generating good looks from 3, getting up another 46 last night after shooting 42 and 39 in the first two games. you will never beat the Celtics when you allow that kind of 3P volume</li>
<li>Mavs other guys played better at home but it’s still painfully obvious that most of them have very little confidence when it comes to attacking closeouts and shooting the 3, and they’ve simply been undisciplined as a unit. PJ’s foul on Holiday in the backcourt was brutal and completely unnecessary</li>
<li>THJ minutes last night were a crazy gamble that I could get behind given the Mavs need for an offensive spark, but Kidd putting him back in when Luka fouled out was mind-boggling. as soon as it was evident he didn’t have his shot that night his ass should’ve been glued to the bench. Exum’s shooting, handling, defense and pace would’ve made way more sense in that moment and honestly I thought he should have gotten more of a chance throughout the game</li>
</ul>

      <label for="l8fco1o" class="commentText"><p>Great comment but to your first sentence, Luka literally missed the playoffs last year lol. His roster was shit and all, but he still had Kyrie. THAT was his first big blemish to his resume and while this one is still pretty bad, it’s not as bad as whatever tf last season was.</p>

      <label for="l8fh8hs" class="commentText"><p>The thing about Luka’s defense is that it seems more about habits than it is about caring and I’m not sure if that’s good news or not. Luka is undoubtedly the best of the young generation bunch for now but he’s letting frustrations bleed into his play too much.</p>

<p>Also the Mavs have been practically making a living out of help defense on their way out of the west, now it’s all torn to shreds. The fact that they can’t get Jones Jr. on the floor consistently because of the lack of offensive spacing is the big killer for their defense and neither Lively nor Gafford can help from serious 3-point shooting bigs.</p>

But a 20 point hole is tough to overcome even in the modern NBA, and the Celtics did enough work in the third to ensure they won out.</p>

<p>Credit to Brown and White for making some big plays at the end to ice the Mavs. On the Mavs part, they definitely have not looked like the strong second half team they typically are, but a lot of that credit has to go to the Celtics defense slowly eroding their energy over the course of each game.</p>

      <label for="l8f14bo" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s also important to note how much a strong defensive performance seems to feed an offense too. It&rsquo;s no surprise that the Mavs started getting good looks when their defense was dialed in during the 4th. But there just wasn&rsquo;t enough left in the tank for the last 3-4 minutes of the game, and Luka fouling out snuffed out the last ounce of energy they had.</p>

<p>Literally everyone but DWhite was having meltdowns. Both Jays, Jrue and Al all had terrible turn overs in that stretch. It finally stopped when they gave DWhite the ball and let him run the offense. But the nice thing about a 20 point lead is you got a lot of cushion to work with and they only needed a few buckets to close it out.</p>

      <label for="l8f5w57" class="commentText"><p>One more win and the C&rsquo;s solidify a pretty historic run. Would be interesting to start compiling where their accomplishments rank in terms of NBA history. Right now, they have a top 5 all-time regular season NetRtg, 2nd fewest losses in the playoffs since they went to a 7-7-7-7 format, one of the longest winning streaks in playoff history, and have a +11.4 NetRtg in the Finals.</p>

<p>They may have a resume for a top 5-10 team all-time for a single season.</p>

Sure, people can say &ldquo;oh but the teams they faced were injured&rdquo; as much as they want, but the reality is that you guys have made it look so damn easy the entire stretch - to the point that I don&rsquo;t think the other teams being healthy would have made much a difference aside from killing that stupid ass narrative.</p>

      <label for="l8fg8dd" class="commentText"><p>It’s gonna be weird talking about their place in the history books, cuz despite benefitting from injuries for 3 rounds the numbers without question say they’re one of the greatest. (Also going 16-2 or maybe 16-3 in an entire playoff run minus your 3rd best player is… wow.)</p>

<p>This Celtics team really feels like the new age 2015 Warriors for me in many regards, but there’s so much to process about this Celtics team that idk if that’s an understatement or a hyperbole. But I think 2015 Warriors or a level just below that sounds about right.</p>

      <label for="l8fgdmq" class="commentText"><p>It’s not simply a talent disparity. It’s utterly systemic- a perfect illustration of team basketball versus heliocentric starball (a la current Mavs, apex Harden Rockets)</p>

<p>Cs play as a unit on both ends, and bc of this have many different buttons to push vis anything Dallas tries. Mavs can only spam Luka/Kyrie and those guys while great are a) in fact defendable with the right personnel &amp; b) HUGE defensive liabilities for their team. </p>

<p>Particularly satisfying to me is to see Luka be so broadly exposed for his vulnerability on d, so that when we come around to these inane ranking discussions next time around we can actually figure the defensive end of the game into those discussions</p>

The Kyrie fadeaway 3 was the only time I felt like they really missed Luka offensively. And they should&rsquo;ve been <em>better</em> on defense without him.

      <label for="l8fekin" class="commentText"><p>But how clutch were the Mavs before this? People give the Celtics a lot of shit for beating up on easy teams but the Mavs went through mostly teams with no playoff experience. Better maybe but not so demonstrably that the narratives that developed going into game one &ndash;best back court ever, best D in last X games, etc&ndash; almost appeared out of nowhere.</p>

<p>This series feels like the distillation of who both teams have been all year: the Celtics are monsters on both sides but prone to quarters where they get complacent and the Mavs look hottest when they have less sophisticated teams to abuse with their main two.</p>

<p>holding the best offense in the league to league average is impressive on their part</p>

<p>what they&rsquo;re missing really is just that 5th starter, and given what their team looks like, Kyrie/Luka/PJ/Lively, that&rsquo;s your 4 30+ min guys</p>

<p>Not really that interesting. BOS is basically the closest thing to a super team. And it doesn&rsquo;t matter that the other team has a superstar when that superstar is clearly injured and the rest of the team is nowhere near as talented as BOS.</p>

<p>A fully healthy DAL team could have taken 1 or 2 games from this BOS team maybe. But with Luka injured even avoiding a sweep is tough.</p>

      <label for="l8fgk7u" class="commentText"><p>Honestly I think it&rsquo;s pretty evenly split between those 3 explanations. Boston is an amazing team, Dallas crushed teams earlier that just couldn&rsquo;t deal with Kyrie/Luka, especially when they were having better success facilitating other scorers. Dallas is also underperforming bricking wide open shots at an alarming rate even when they get them.</p>

      <label for="l8fhnof" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s quite funny how the discourse has shifted this past week:</p>

<ul>
<li>9to1 days before game 1: How easily does the greatest duo clear the Celtics?</li>
<li>Game 1 / 2: how healthy would the Mavs need to be to win?</li>
<li>Game 3: Could the Celtics beat the 2017 Warriors, LeBron Cavs, MJ?</li>
<li>Game 4: If gods assembled a basketball team, how many games do the Celtics take?</li>
