</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>The 2025 draft is deep with tons of star potential. Utah is in no man’s land with a team that is not bad enough to get a top 4 pick but not good enough to make the playoffs. Lauri has 1 year left on his contract and wants to have a great year to earn a max contract. Are they going to keep him and risk missing out on Flagg and others? Are they going to play him fewer minutes and fewer games in a season where he wants to show out for his next contract? If teams don’t cave to Ainge’s steep asking price they could probably get a better deal at the deadline when Utah decides to tank the last part of the season.</p>

<p>But back when Toronto made that trade the dubs were a juggernaut, a 80s Lakers / Celtics, 90s Bulls, 90s/00s Lakers level dynasty.</p>

<p>Celtics aren&rsquo;t really close to being there yet. The Bucks looked stacked and lost their way. Denver looked stacked - all last season we kept hearing about their championship experience meaning they can coast the regular season and dominate the playoffs and it didn&rsquo;t work out.</p>

Markannen is good but he’s not a difference maker. He’s a fringe all star that only made it as AS because it was hosted in his home city. He’s been a losing player ever since he was drafted, traded to a worse team every time, and had an anomaly of a season. Why would any team get into a bidding war for that when there are plenty other options that are worth their considerations.</p>

      <label for="lbv0apr" class="commentText"><p>I’d argue that Kuminga will be the true second option for the team. Markannen is better now but the difference isn’t large enough that it outweighs his experience playing in the system for years. This isn’t like Dame joining the Bucks and is far better than Middleton.</p>

<p>For the Raps, he isn’t going to move the needle at all. We’ll finish a couple spots higher and end up with a worse draft pick (which we might not even have given the asking price) for multiple years. He doesn’t fill a positional need either. We’ll be stuck in play-in purgatory for years unless he gets better trade return down the line for us.</p>

      <label for="lbuxb0k" class="commentText"><p>Lauri was a legit all star in 23 and had an argument this year. At this point he’s had two better seasons than Mikal Bridges has ever had and he just got traded for a huge package. He also does a more valued thing at a rarer position for doing that thing (stretching the floor with the ability to handle the ball as a big).</p>

<p>In the right situation I don’t think it’s crazy to think of him as the 2nd best player on a really good team. Him as a 3rd option means you’re probably going at least a few rounds in the playoffs.</p>

<p>He’s just SO improved since eurobasket in 2022, really felt like it unlocked something for good</p>

Probably a top 5 in that regard and his best season in 2023 was ways more impressive than Lauri, what are you even on about. Bridges has experience in the playoffs, what does Lauri actually do better than Bridges other than be taller?</p>

      <label for="lbvudh0" class="commentText"><p>Most leaks occur for specific reasons. Warriors leaked their interest in Markanen as a means to justify not extending Klay.</p>

<p>There may very well be numerous other teams interested in trading for Markanan, all of whom have no incentive to broadcast that interest, as it would only upset the trade bait currently on their roster. If/when the trade doesn’t happen, things get awkward when the whole world knows the team was thisclose to trading said player(s) for Lauri</p>

<p>Getting iHart def boosts SGA&rsquo;s MVP chances next year too, more offensive rebounds while not taking up that much offensive usage like Lauri would&rsquo;ve</p>

But I think the combo of assets they’d have to give up, contract they’d have to extend him on, lost flexibility in a couple years when Dub and Chet extend, and the fact Lauri is not a great defender (the Thunder have shown a clear focus this offseason on having five plus defenders on the floor at all times) probably all contributed to deciding it wasn’t worth it.</p>

<p>Better to use the money to get Hartenstein for no asset cost, maintain flexibility when Dub and Chet’s extensions hit, and give Dub and Chet the shots Lauri would have taken to help their development.</p>

<ul>
<li>Utah also has to meet the minimum salary cap <span class="math inline">\(126.5m for the season. They're currently at \)</span>110.7m. They have to hit the salary floor by mid-October. They basically can hit the minimum salary cap by renegotiating and extending Lauri in August.</li>
<li>Due to the 140% raise rule, he can only sign a max contract extension if he also gets this season&rsquo;s salary renegotiated into free cap space.</li>
<li>What teams trading for him have the cap space to do that? If he&rsquo;s not extended by Utah and he&rsquo;s traded to a team above the cap, he can&rsquo;t sign a true max extension with the team trading for him. Why would he want to be traded? He&rsquo;d be screwing himself out of a massive raise this season.</li>
<li>Why would an above the cap team give up assets to get Lauri if he can get more money in the open market as a free agent next summer than the best extension offer the above the cap team can give him?</li>
<li>Also, if he has his contract renegotiated and he signs an extension at the earliest date August 6, 2024, it means he can&rsquo;t be traded until February 6, 2025 aka trade deadline day. Which means teams better get their deal done with Utah between midnight and 3PM EST on deadline day.</li>

</blockquote>

<p>Okay, that’s interesting. But Markkanen doesn’t have to sign on the 6th, right? He could just delay signing until August 7th and then effectively have a no trade clause for the year? By signing it sounds like he is locking in to being traded at the deadline to a random team…</p>

<p>I’m just assuming that he’s not going to want to pick up his life and move to another team mid season? Unless it was to a contender, but what contenders realistically could fit him anyways.</p>

      <label for="lbtss9w" class="commentText"><p>I think most likely he signs an extension in August. 26 year old 7 foot sharpshooting unicorn all stars that want to play in Utah are pretty rare. Wed be stupid to trade him for a subpar package. Could he get traded? sure. But there is no way they trade him for pennies on the dollar because they “have” to tank.</p>

Having Lauri and them makes the team good enough to always be in the back end of the lotto. By the time yall possibly get a young star and are ready to compete Lauri is gonna be like 30. Yall should be gathering picks until you hit on a star and then continue to pick up young talent or trade the boatload of picks for proven pieces.</p>

<p>If he renegotiated and extends in Utah, his money is locked up and his performance this year doesn’t affect his future earnings anyway.</p>

<p>Part of the reason the 2025 draft is so hyped is because of its depth, not just Flagg. The Jazz could conceivably get a franchise player with any of the top 6-7 picks, and they can probably keep Lauri and still do that if they want.</p>

In a really strong draft they should be pulling out all the stops to ensure they keep their pick. Ainge is smart, my bet is he keeps him until the trade deadline when teams are more desperate and hard tank the remainder of the season.</p>

      <label for="lbub4k4" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not just that they tank.  They&rsquo;ve slowly been turning over the roster.   They got rid of Fontecchio and Olynyk at the deadline who were really solid vets.  They called up Hendricks and Sensebaugh and they just drafted three more guys they want to put in the rotation ASAP.  They are moving Kris Dunn and will be trying to drop Clarkson (whose AAV drops dramatically over the summer because he was on a front loaded contract). So basically the only long term vets are Markkanen and Sexton, and the rest is the frosh team.  </p>

      <label for="lbuleke" class="commentText"><p>Because while it&rsquo;s great that the young guys are good and theyre playing well theyre gonna possibly lose out on their pick this year. Top 5 would still be great in this draft. But higher than 8 and they lose the pick.</p>

<p>And just off their roster so far, none of the young guys are star level talents that can lead a team. As we all know, you need a star to compete. So even if the team is solid, they need a star. And that is harder to get if theyre picking in the late lotto. Unless they hit big with the late lotto picks then they&rsquo;re gonna be stuck in the 8-15 range all the time in a weird limbo and Lauri will be too old to be a part of the core.</p>

<p>Utah is fine with keeping him and so there’s literally 0 pressure to trade him. There’s no bluff or urgency which is why he hasn’t been traded already. You aren’t getting him with 4 picks that will be late first round. That’s not gonna wow them enough to budge. You are gonna need to provide promising young players, and no mid first round picks from this draft don’t count, in addition to quality picks.</p>

      <label for="lbtxjgl" class="commentText"><p>The Jazz doing the exact same thing as the last two seasons where they only tank the last 30 games would be really bad for Utahs future. Ainge and Co want to tank and I think the rest of the league knows that and won’t overpay for an expiring like Markannen. Jazz fans don’t wanna admit it obviously but this isn’t a Rudy/Donovan situation.</p>

      <label for="lbtywen" class="commentText"><p>The rest of the league can believe what they want. This isn’t the same situation, you are correct. Unlike Mitchell, Lauri has shown interest in staying in Utah if he can and unlike Rudy he’s young enough still that he could fit a timeline to rebuild.</p>

<p>Also the jazz can be bad enough with lauri to tank, last year they went 1-12 with Lauri playing after the all star break when they committed to tank. Utah doesn’t need to settle to be a feeder team and take scraps from another team.</p>

      <label for="lbtzmaq" class="commentText"><p>We disagree on the being bad enough with Lauri portion. There will be a lot of teams gunning for a top 5 pick with this loaded draft. I don’t think the Jazz will be as bad as those teams if Lauri is playing. They can sit him again but how much does Lauri want his long term value being hurt by that. Ainge and Co want to trade him but they’re saving face to preserve his value. If it makes you feel better, I think they’ll get above market value for him but not the haul that jazz fans have been saying is a given.</p>

<p>If they did keep him I’m assuming there’s a max extension coming so not really concerned about the value being hurt, since he will still be able to shine after.</p>

I don&rsquo;t see anyone giving up their 2025 lottery pick for Kuminga, and Ainge knows this. Only team that has a real shot at Lauri is OKC, and thankfully Presti has to max a bunch of his own players soon and is thinking ahead.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I hoped my team would put in a reasonable offer, say 2-3 protected frp+a young guy with some upside, but no future all-star potential and leave it at that. It&rsquo;s substantial for someone who can&rsquo;t play defense, would be on a so-so contract, and have health issues despite being a real good shooter. We can chase other FAs in the next year or two. I&rsquo;d love to have Lauri, esp. a Finnish player on my team but we aren&rsquo;t going to throw kitchen sink at him</p>

      <label for="lbvvi9g" class="commentText"><p>The problem is, you seem to believe Aubge only has two options for Lauri. Trade him or don’t trade him. However he most likely has at least 4 or 5 options. He could trade him to team x, team y, team z or he could keep him. Think about how many team right now, are probably at least slightly interested in trading for Lauri. If I had to guess, the Kings, Lakers, Warriors all most likely made offers for him. I could see the Heat or Pelicans being at least somewhat intrigued. With some many suitors, Ainge has to take his time and find the best possible deal.</p>

<p>Imagine Grizz fans talking about a trade based around Santi Aldama, who came out of the same draft class and is more proven yet 9th on our depth chart</p>
