<p>There’s a lot of reporting that Utah prioritized Brandin Podziemski instead of Jonathan Kuminga as the “blue chip” prospect coming back [in a potential Lauri trade]…</p>

<p>That’s as much about the extension number that Jonathan Kuminga would like than it is about anything these two guys have done on the floor.</p>

<p>Podz is going to be entering year 2 of a 4 year rookie deal, Jonathan Kuminga is entering the final year of his rookie deal… the word around the league, from various sources, is that Kuminga and his representation are looking for a full max extension.</p>

<p>Over the 2nd half of last season he was basically a co-2nd option (with Klay) and put up an very efficient 19 / 5.4 / 3 on a team that was tied for 4th in the league in offensive efficiency.  All as a 21 year old.</p>

<p>If he makes another leap this year, he&rsquo;ll be worth the rookie max.</p>

<p>Sure, its not guaranteed but if you compare JK&rsquo;s stats as a 21 year old to pretty much any forward besides LeBron, KD, Tatum, then JK looks like he&rsquo;s on track to be an all-star even borderline all-NBA guy.</p>

<p> The question is if kuminga will improve enough to be deserving of a max contract, and he hasn&rsquo;t been an all star, all NBA, all defense team, or even a candidate for any of those awards  </p>

<p> If he takes a step forward and increases his counting stats 25% and his efficiency at least 10% without decreasing his effort on defense , I can see GS making the argument for maxing him, but that&rsquo;s a tall ask , and even then, he&rsquo;s not even guaranteed an all NBA spot at forward </p>

      <label for="lh4zhro" class="commentText"><p>Since when is being an all-star - much less all-NBA - the criteria for a rookie max?</p>

<p>Kuminga&rsquo;s max would start at ~ $35 million. Here is a list of players making about that much as of next year: Michael Porter Jr, Lamelo Ball, Maxey, Bam, Fox, Bane, Harden, Ayton, Brunson, Middleton, Quickly, J Holiday, J Grant.</p>

<p>Worth noting that Bam&rsquo;s deal will increase to $51 million in &lsquo;27 and D Fox likely will as well, as he&rsquo;ll be eligible for a new contract.</p>

<p>Less than half of those dudes are all-stars - if you have any of the above on ~ $35 mlilion per year its a GREAT deal.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, but paying the max just because someone else will also does not make sense.  The suns knew better than anyone Ayton was not worth the max and now he&rsquo;s just a toxic asset.  You&rsquo;re betting on someone else being convinced they can rehab him or he has value on a max and that&rsquo;s just not the case in the current CBA.</p>

<p>Sometimes it’s better to let go, accept the loss of the asset and think ahead instead of gambling on a coin toss. Kuminga will need to improve a lot to be tradeable with that contract. Better to lose the asset than to gain a liability.</p>

<p>If they don&rsquo;t offer it and they match, then the player will get a max offer sheet for one year less than what GSW can offer.  So GSW will lose out on a year of control and make him feel disrespected in the process.  Those are all reasons for GSW to offer a max.</p>

      <label for="lh4l6xy" class="commentText"><p>You are overstating how this will impact Kuminga and the chances he actually gets a max contract offer while understating all of the option GS has before Kuminga actually gets to free agency. The reality is that if Kuminga plays well enough this season to get a max deal then GS will offer it in the offseason before free agency. Right now, no one is giving a max deal to him. I am sure that he feels GS has diminished his value but the reality is that if he was as good as he thinks he is then he would&rsquo;ve got more playing time.</p>

      <label for="lh43m4j" class="commentText"><p>25%.  But it&rsquo;s not like most teams stop at the cap these days unless they suck.</p>

<p>He had a great few week stretch last winter where he was averaging 25 points a night, and he popped of a bunch again towards the end of last season.  You&rsquo;d basically be maxing him on the hopes that he can start dialing that in more consistently, which isn&rsquo;t unreasonable given that he&rsquo;s only 21.</p>

<p>The potential is very clearly there.</p>

Feels like Warriors should let him play out the year then, unless he&rsquo;s ready to cause a scene, as they&rsquo;d at least get to make sure he&rsquo;s worth it as they&rsquo;d be paying max either now or by matching a RFA bid from another team.</p>

<p>As a fan of the Blazers, it wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising to me to see the Blazers try to swap jerami grant with Kuminga.  In the Blazers youth group, they&rsquo;ve got Scoot, Shae, and Deni.  Without seeing him in the NBA, they have Clingan for center.  The glaring hole is a starting-level pf.</p>

      <label for="lh5awlp" class="commentText"><p>25% doesn’t even seem that crazy though. He is certainly a starter on a lot of teams as is assuming no growth. If you add in the fact he is pretty likely to improve at least a little it seems kinda fine to pay him that. It might make your team top-heavy but Kuminga probably can be the third best player on a competent team even if he doesn’t get much better. Not everyone can contend and everyone spends most of their cap, sometimes it’s okay to pay a guy that’s just pretty good and just be a mid team for a bit.</p>

<p>Guys like Kuminga have upside and are going to demand a max contract coming off the rookie deal, even though they have a lot left to prove.</p>

<p>Otto Porter was in a similar situation with the Wizards, he signed a max rookie contract. But that was 7 years ago, the salary cap was 40M less than today.</p>

<p>Lacob&rsquo;s strategy of paying the tax gave them an additional championship and showed the league that they take care of their stars. But it&rsquo;s also a situation he created by giving Wiggins and Draymond contracts that their performances aren&rsquo;t living up to.</p>

<p>Also, this league is hell bent on breaking championship teams apart by penalising talent concentration. It&rsquo;s good for the small market teams and for increased parity in the league. Bad for the likes of the Celtics, warriors, clippers, Lakers, Denver, Bucks who want to make the jump to the top or stay there.</p>

I think most young teams would&rsquo;ve given Sengun the rookie max.</p>

<p>The value of the rookie max is that if your guy develops into an all-NBA player during his early prime, 25% of the cap is great value.</p>

<p>Kuminga - after being put inthe starting lineup - put up 19 / 5.5 / 3 on 54% shooting. And he did that for the 4th best offense in the league - they were not empty shot attempts.</p>

<p>Jalen Green is an inefficient chucker with worse defense and rebounding than Kuminga.</p>

      <label for="lh4qwwt" class="commentText"><p>I think you have a typo - Green averaged 22 points per game in the 2nd half of the season not 28.</p>

<p>But more importantly, he did that on 55% TS whereas JK had &amp;gt; 60% TS. That&rsquo;s the difference between being on par with the #4 offense in the league and the #28 offense.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reason that Houston had the #19 offense in the league over the 2nd half&hellip; its largely Jalen Green.  Add to that his &lsquo;meh&rsquo; playmkaing for a guard and bad defense and he&rsquo;s probably the favorite for players who will find a new team.</p>

Only assisted on 60% of his field goals. Mediocre 3 point shooter but good from everywhere else. Good on/offs.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t max him, but he&rsquo;s definitely earned a substantial extension given his age. Are the Warriors going to nickel-and-dime him over a few million a year?</p>

      <label for="lh4qq4g" class="commentText"><p>List of (potential) max rookie extensions in the last 4 seasons:</p>

<p>2018: Luka, Trae, MPJ, Shai</p>

<p>2019 Max Rookie Extensions: Zion, Ja, Garland</p>

<p>2020: Ant, LaMelo, Haliburton, Maxey</p>

<p>2021: Cade, Mobley, Barnes, Wagner, (Sengun, Kuminga)</p>

<p>I think the market is definitely bullish because of the new TV deal and there are several players who wouldn&rsquo;t get a max in a normal circumstance, but still, the other 5 are like borderline max players in a normal year while Kuminga is a tier below. Don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll get one this off season.</p>

If you have to ask &ldquo;is he worth a max contract?&rdquo;, then the answer is (or should be) &ldquo;absolutely not&rdquo;. The players that actually deserve a max contract get one without question, because of course they&rsquo;re worth it. You think OKC will have internal decisions of whether or not to max Shai? Anybody think the nuggets had/have to think hard about giving Jokic whatever he&rsquo;s eligible for? Are the wolves considering low balling Ant on his next contract? Fuck no to all of those because those players clearly deserve whatever they can get. Kuminga? Fuck no. Murray? Fuck no. Now, that didn&rsquo;t mean they won&rsquo;t get it from someone, but those are immediately bad contacts the second they are signed in today&rsquo;s NBA.</p>

      <label for="lh4qp26" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think they will give it to him, but I don’t blame his agent for <em>attempting</em> to set that expectation. There’s not much of a middle class in the NBA, especially when it comes to rookie extensions. After max deals, the drop off is typically hella steep. Not too many 4th year players get “reasonable” extensions. It’s perceived as either you have potential as a future cornerstone building block, or you don’t… in which case you get paid like a role player.</p>

<p>His agent is holding out hope that there is a team that believes in this young player’s <em>potential</em></p>

      <label for="lh40nuf" class="commentText"><p>Remember y’all saying every starter will get 40-50m is normal? Sure just give Podz 50m next. TCJ will get 60m a year in a few years. It’s not normal</p>

<p>People are referencing the second apron instead of the actual salary cap.</p>

<p>Using only the second apron means you’re essentially just keeping your current guys and keep drafting and that’s it. In a few years from now if the cap keeps going up 10% year over year sure your 5 starters could all make 40-50 each, and you’d have your draft picks and vet mins to fill out ur roster. That’s it</p>

<p>So basically by r/nba logic, the warriors will be</p>

<p>Melton/Podz/Moody/Kuminga/TCJ all making 50m each. Lmao</p>

<p>It doesn’t work like that and won’t be like that. Not every starter will be getting paid 50m.</p>

<p>Under the new cba it’s actually the exact opposite. Teams won’t overpay for bad players. They will have two dudes making 50-60m and 3 starters making like 25-30 and a decent bench. That’s the correct model</p>

He was as good as anyone from his class during that period. He hasn’t proven it over the course of a full season though, but that’s on his coach dicking him around. He has deserved more opportunity than he has been given. From his vantage point, the difference between him and the other guys who have gotten the max is opportunity not ability. I agree with him.</p>

<p>Think the Warriors might let Kuminga test the market if he really does think he&rsquo;s a max guy. I think they might call his bluff. Depends on the season he has. I do think they&rsquo;d match him if he gets a max.</p>

      <label for="lh4u2uc" class="commentText"><p>I hope he gets his bag. This wouldn’t even be a discussion if he was drafted by a young team and given a starting spot just based off the fact he was a high draft pick. Kerr has messed with Kuminga and we have known it since year 2. Year 1 he didn’t play cause he was “raw” and the team was competing for a championship. There were some games when he played where you could see glimpses of an all-star. Year 2, Kerr continues to start Wiggins turning a blind eye to his struggles and giving mins to Anthony Lamb. Year 3 Kerr continues to play favorites with Klay and Wiggins, Kuminga is special when he plays but one mistake and pulls him out. Kuminga calls Kerr out, finally kerr starts giving him real minutes and Kuminga is easily their 2nd best player. Kuminga should start without question and get majority of mins at SF over Wiggins but who knows with Kerr.</p>

Now they don’t know what they have and someone else is definitely willing to take the risk on qualifying offer especially if they dont have to trade anything. The question is if you wont max him now then why bother waiting until someone else shows up with that offer, things will already be a mess by then.</p>

I mean if the Pistons draft placement disappoints again, I can see them maxing Kuminga and making the de facto second option of the future. Dude is built to be paid. A big wing that can average 20 on decent percentage and not be a complete dumpster fire on defense. Nets another option since they only have a small window to tank.</p>

A contact that starts at 21.25% of cap, and rises to 25% if he hits certain milestones isn&rsquo;t crazy for Kuminga&hellip; I still don&rsquo;t love it, I&rsquo;d rather knock about 3% off, but it at least creates some flexibility (and tradability) if he doesn&rsquo;t reach his incentives, and Kuminga still has a potential max contract.</p>
