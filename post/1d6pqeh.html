      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1d6pqeh/in_the_playoffs_when_rudy_gobert_was_on_the_floor/"><p>In the playoffs, when Rudy Gobert was on the floor the Wolves scored 16 (!) more points than when he was off the floor. Rudy&rsquo;s presence elevates their offense (121.55) to what would be #2 in the playoffs and the regular season, and they are the 3rd worst offense when he is off the floor.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Although he looks awkward and we remember the fumbles the most, Rudy creates advantages for his team on offense with his screens, creating open threes with his vertical gravity, getting the team into the bonus, pnr, and lobs (when he&rsquo;s utilized). Ant hit game winning daggers off of Rudy screens.</p>

<p>His offensive impact has been greater than his defensive impact, particularly in their 3pt shooting. When Rudy is on the floor, Wolves shoot 39% from 3 and 30% when he is off the floor. His screens and gravity creates open threes for his teammates (because defenders have to tag his roll) and that is hugely valuable and partially how Utah was the #1 offense in the past (they surrounded corner shooters around him).</p>

<p>Throughout the playoffs, Rudy had the biggest impact on the offense a*nd* defense among all the Wolves rotation players. </p>

<p><strong>Other context:</strong></p>

<p>When Ant is on without Rudy, the offense is 103. When Ant and Rudy are on together, the offense is 122.9.</p>

<p>When KAT is on without Rudy, the offense is 105. KAT and Rudy together, the offense is 122.</p>

<p>When Rudy is on without Ant the offense is 110 and when Rudy is on without KAT the offense is 122.</p>

<p>The Wolves stars generate more offense when paired with Rudy. The trend is the same when you dig into further lineup combinations. This isn&rsquo;t over a single game, it&rsquo;s throughout the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="l6tzz46" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I was wondering this too.</p>

<p>When Rudy and Ant are on together, the offense is 122.9 (would be #1 in the playoffs and the regular season).</p>

<p>When Ant is on <em>without</em> Rudy, the offense is 103&hellip; and when Rudy is on without Ant, the offense is 111. So it&rsquo;s not just minutes overlapping with Ant. <a href="https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612750&amp;Season=2023-24&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PlayerIds=203497,1630162" target="_blank">https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612750&amp;Season=2023-24&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PlayerIds=203497,1630162</a></p>

<p>Yeah it reminds me of Steven Adams impact on offenses. The rebounding and screens is so impactful.</p>

      <label for="l6uat61" class="commentText"><p>This is silly. The net rating with Ant and Gobert both off the court is damn near the same as with them on the floor. This is the same reason that +/- stats are generally useless. Rotations don&rsquo;t happen in a vacuum, they are generally aligned with how the opponent is playing their roster.</p>

<p>Apparently the team is better when all 3 sit. And when kat and Edwards are off the floor the team has the worst defensive rating of all. DPOY at work.</p>

      <label for="l6u4cln" class="commentText"><p>Thank you. The amount of Rudy on-off posts is wild. On-off is a horrible metric to evaluate a player. On-off takes into account not just the single player, but the other 9 guys on the court during those same minutes.

It&rsquo;s not just single player +/- and it&rsquo;s not just for a single game. Digging into other lineup combos over a large sample size: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1d6pqeh/comment/l6u4e14/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1d6pqeh/comment/l6u4e14/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button</a></p>

<p>I just wanted to draw attention to this because so many people say he&rsquo;s a &ldquo;liability&rdquo; on offense because they&rsquo;ll remember a fumble or one TO and overreact to that. But in actuality, his screens, getting the team into the bonus, and vertical gravity are very impactful and no matter how dig into the on/off numbers across player combos, his offensive impact is clear. Ant and KAT generate more offense when paired with Rudy. I thought it was fascinating and the advantages a true big can create for an offense isn&rsquo;t talked about enough in casual NBA discourse which is why I wanted to put this out there.</p>

      <label for="l6u7cao" class="commentText"><p>Fair enough. His screening is def great and I can see how that helps generate better offense for his teammates. That said, after watching every game in the Denver and Dallas series, it&rsquo;s hard for me to see Rudy as a net positive offensive player. He&rsquo;s not a reliable lob threat, which is wild given how tall he is. And he can&rsquo;t reliably hit any shot that&rsquo;s not an open dunk. He does get fouled and did shoot ok from the FT line, so that helps. Idk, from what I saw he seemed like an offensive liability. Wolves had a bad offense rating all season, so it&rsquo;s hard for me to believe they wouldn&rsquo;t be better off offensively with a big that can score better. The contrast with Gafford and Lively yamming all those lobs was pretty stark.</p>

      <label for="l6ua6jc" class="commentText"><p>Yeah Ant and Rudy were not able to connect on lobs the same way Gafford and Lively were able to with Luka.</p>

<p>I think Rudy&rsquo;s offensive impact in the Mavs and Denver series were largely screens, creating open threes out of the short roll, and getting the team in the bonus which is an underrated contribution and ended up being crucial to comeback in Game 7. His mistakes are Shaqtin the fool worthy though lol</p>

      <label for="l6u3zwa" class="commentText"><p>What context do you mean?</p>

<p>A 16 point difference is big. Compared to any other Wolves rotation player, he has the biggest impact.</p>

<p>I was curious about context too so I looked into it further: When Ant is on without Rudy, the offense is 103 (!) and when KAT is on without Rudy the offense is 105. When Rudy is on without Ant it&rsquo;s 110, and when he&rsquo;s on without KAT it&rsquo;s 122. When Rudy is on with KAT or Ant or both, it&rsquo;s 122. Rudy is driving these offensive numbers more than other players on the team and Ant and KAT generate more offense when they are paired with Rudy on the court.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just stats. The impact of his screens, vertical gravity and getting the team into the bonus is easy to see. I&rsquo;m just bringing this up because I found the evidence to be fascinating and did not realize it was a 16 point swing on offense (and it&rsquo;s not single game, this is over the whole playoffs and even when you dig further into lineup combinations the trend is the same).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to make anyone &ldquo;look good or bad&rdquo;, just thought this was a fascinating discussion with evidence but people seem averse to it</p>

It&rsquo;s really more being an absolute awful decision maker in the middle of the floor or short roll. Mavs clearly could navigate his screens and forced the ball handler to dump to the middle lots where he immediately panics. Not to mention he can have almost any player on the court tag him whether it&rsquo;s briefly to let another defender recover or switch for the whole possession onto him no worry. It&rsquo;s been used over and over vs him in the playoffs.</p>

When Ant or KAT is on without Rudy the offense is surprisingly a low 103 and 105, respectively.

<p>A true big has more value to an offense than I thought.</p>

<p>But damn people are averse to having a discussion about what Rudy Gobert positively brings to offenses here lol. Yeah I should probably move to r/nbadiscussion and just let the hating commence here. Just thought this was fascinating evidence of the impact of a true big (that holds even when splicing into lineup combos and adding context) but people are weirdly averse to it</p>

Would people rather have a player who&rsquo;s contributions don&rsquo;t get them to the WCF? One reason they won Game 7 and made the WCF was because Rudy got them into the bonus early in the 4Q which got his whole team FTs. That is an offensive contribution that many people don&rsquo;t think about because his mistakes are just Shaqtin the fool and people fixate on them.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t like stats, another example is his roll-man gravity that creates open threes. <a href="https://x.com/HowlsAndGrowls_/status/1611796086171000832" target="_blank">It is clear as day</a> how defenders collapse to his roll.</p>

<p>No…his roll man, and the help defender….2 defenders, a normal play…ANY roll man gets that response….</p>

<p>Buddy, stop. You’re trying to hype up Gobert cause he’s on your team. You’re embarrassing yourself by arguing like it’s some unique thing that Gobert can do BASIC concepts that literally every player in the NBA does. Literally ANY player that screens and rolls gets that response because that’s quite literally a middle school level of defensive knowledge. </p>

<p>FYI, “gravity” doesn’t mean what you think it means. Someone covering a roll man isn’t what gravity in basketball refers to. Vertical gravity is about lobs and being a threat to dunk alley oops….Gobert is not a lob threat…..</p>

He can&rsquo;t finish anything other than spoon-fed dunks. He can&rsquo;t pass. He can&rsquo;t shoot. He can&rsquo;t hit FTs. He has bad awareness and IQ.
