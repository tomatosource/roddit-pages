      <label for="lilxtn1" class="commentText"><p>Winning the MVP (while obviously not a bad thing for his legacy), came with the side effect of putting a microscope on him, as well as expectations and comparisons that wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise have been there.</p>

<p>The microscope really exposed a lot of facets of his game (shooting, off-ball), which then quickly became apparent were not just not elite, but are actively awful.</p>

<p>In parts of his game, you could make strong arguments he&rsquo;s amongst the best ever, but his holes are just so massive that if you&rsquo;re comparing him to the peer group of MVP/All Timer caliber players, it&rsquo;s naturally going to elicit a reaction that he doesn&rsquo;t deserve to be in that conversation.</p>

<p>Realistically his conversation should have always been comparing him amongst other high quality all stars - with whom he would shine brightly in many ways and the team success expectations would have been much lower.</p>

      <label for="lim9171" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s also because he never seemed to learn or admit his weaknesses. I&rsquo;ve never seen someone with such a low bbiq on defense. Obviously I am bias, but it makes no sense that he&rsquo;s so bad on defense considering his wingspan, athletic ability, and build.</p>

<p>He doesn&rsquo;t deserve all the hate he gets, but he absolutely deserves the criticism of his game.</p>

      <label for="limqs3j" class="commentText"><p>Having watched quite a few of Russ&rsquo; games from college onward, I think part of the reason he is such a bad defender is exactly because of his athleticism. He got away with bad habits for years, even in the NBA, because he was such a superior athlete he could recover. But as his athleticism has started to dip, those moments of ball watching, being slightly more hung up on a screen, low basketball iq, etc. have been highlighted. Great athletes are often harolded as great defenders because they get to balls others think they can&rsquo;t get to, or make some highlight block or whatever - but half the reason those plays are needed are because they&rsquo;re out of position in the first place.</p>

I remember watching him actively getting out of the way of offensive players driving at him or coming off of screens where he had drop/show responsibilities and giving them direct lines straight to the basket so he could try for a chase down block on them.  Dude was so athletically gifted he could leap up and get the block a decent amount. Looked absolutely amazing when he got the block, but wasn’t so great the other 3 or 4 times when he either fouled them or they got a free layup/dunk or a kick out for a wide open three when the help was forced to come.</p>

      <label for="lin5ij8" class="commentText"><p>An ethical rebound is one where you&rsquo;re actually &lsquo;defending&rsquo; in getting the rebound. He was at the top of the league in uncontested def. rebound percentage (i.e. even among the bigs in the league, Russ was grabbing easy rebounds). He was also near rock bottom among league starters in contested shots and contested 3s. When you review the footage that year, he was ignoring HIS man and letting them get open shots so he could grab a rebound if they missed.</p>

<p>He wasn&rsquo;t actually hustling to fight for rebounds 80%+ of the time. His teammates were boxing out and waiting for him to grab it while he actively refused to play defence so he&rsquo;d be in better position. It was artifically inflated to benefit his box score.</p>

<p>Nevermind the sheer number of games he stayed in during blowouts to chase extra rebounds or assists, even yelling at teammates who wouldn&rsquo;t take shots off his pass when he was at 9 assists. Add the 42% usage rate (by far the highest in history), he was blatantly statpadding all season.</p>

      <label for="limh62n" class="commentText"><p>Also, his performance is noticeably worse in the playoffs.  Inefficient, high turnovers and critical low IQ plays at key moments. From my perspective, he is the worst MVP in recent memory. Some may say D Rose but for me it&rsquo;s Russ. He shot 42% FG in his MVP season and was blatantly chasing triple doubles. Which is fine but then he went on to shoot 38 percent from the field in the playoffs while averaging 6 turnovers. As an opponent, at that kind of inefficiency I want you to take all the shots.</p>

<p>I am not saying he is not a great player but I think he won&rsquo;t be the choice for number one or number two option in the playoffs if you want to win it all. No shooting and low BBIQ (both offense and defense) is probably not what you want from your primary or secondary player. Especially, if that player plays PG. Then the question arises is he good as a third guy or role player for a contender? Well not really. So, his value is getting good numbers on a bad team with high usage and constant ball in his hand. He will give you all star numbers which is great.</p>

      <label for="limsgey" class="commentText"><p>Personally, I think he could&rsquo;ve been quite a good defensive player but in a lot of playoff games I just see him standing around literally doing nothing.</p>

<p>Plenty of players play both sides of the ball. Even Curry is giving near max effort on most possessions. He&rsquo;s physically limited but he&rsquo;s clearly putting in effort and getting into stances as opposed to just literally standing there. And he runs probably 2x more on offense than anyone else.</p>

<p>Great players who actually try on defense: Kawhi. KD. Younger Lebron. Kobe. Jordan. Giannis. Duncan. Garnett. Or if we want to just go guards: Wade, Paul, Kidd, Billups, Rondo.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just saying when I rewatch some old OKC series, Westbrook is a traffic cone a lot of the time</p>

<p>When he sees a chance to gamble for a steal, he&rsquo;ll run hard on that. When it&rsquo;s comes to keeping track of his man on defense, he can&rsquo;t be bothered.</p>

<p>When he sees a chance to get a rebound, he&rsquo;ll try on that play. If you ask him to set a screen, or cut through and pull his defender to the weak side to allow KD/Beal/LeBron/Kawhi to iso without a help defender in their lap, he can&rsquo;t be bothered.</p>

<p>If you put him on the weak side, he stands there just as lazily as any Harden or Luka lowlight.</p>

People are just remembering his highlights in that space during his prime and now a critical threshold of fans think he was special in that range. But his actual %s were never that good - not even <em>close</em> to competitive with the midrange shooters in the league we&rsquo;d call &lsquo;elite&rsquo;.</p>

He ranked lower than 160th in the league shooting the percentage he shot this past year. For reference, guys like Poole, Dinwiddie and Giddey were shooting 32-33% and people were saying they were terrible shooters.</p>

      <label for="liofyfp" class="commentText"><p>The list of guys who raise their teams <em>to championship level</em> is incredibly short. Like literally maybe a handful of guys max at any given time. Every single player who doesn&rsquo;t fit that isn&rsquo;t a bad team player. Thats not even mentioning the fact that even among those who can, its still very dependent on having a great roster around them unless they&rsquo;re literally prime Lebron.</p>

<p>A guy who has lead the league in assists is not a bad team player. A guy who took a frankly bad roster to the playoffs in the West is not a bad team player who doesnt raise his teams&rsquo; ceilings. A guy who helped Paul George become and MVP candidate when they played together in OKC (and helped KD <em>win</em> MVP) isn&rsquo;t a bad team player. You can&rsquo;t just say guys whose playstyles you don&rsquo;t like are &ldquo;bad team players&rdquo;, or &ldquo;don&rsquo;t play winning basketball&rdquo; and will it into reality.</p>

<p>There are perfectly valid criticisms of Russ. Him being a bad team player is not one. I could very easily argue you have the exact opposite opinion of him as reality would suggest you should. I could argue he was always at his best as a co-star lifting up his teammates and that he was moreso limited as a lone star who you would probably never win a championship with as your best player, unless it was a truly stacked roster like current Boston with him instead of Tatum. And before anyone suggests otherwise, yes prime Russ was far better than Jaylen and he would be their best player.</p>

<p>He doesn&rsquo;t just say that stuff, he also plays like it.</p>

<p>The more you watch him, the more you realize he only tries when he has a chance to get a stat. Steals are a stat, so he&rsquo;ll try hard when gambling on those.</p>

<p>But staying attached to your man on defense, so that you don&rsquo;t give up an open 3 or backdoor layup, is not a stat, so Russ doesn&rsquo;t care about that.</p>

<p>This has been a thing with Russ since he was a rookie, and it&rsquo;s never improved even a little.</p>

Players back then act like people were getting wheeled out on stretchers every game. I watched a lot of 80s and 90s ball. Sure, there were some hard fouls every few games, but outside of that there was actually less overall physicality on defense, imo, since a lot of the contact was centered around one on one iso basketball between two guys while the rest of the players were cleared out to the other side due to illegal defense rules.</p>

<p>That didn&rsquo;t even work at Davidson, where Curry didn&rsquo;t have Klay next to him - let alone KD too. Yeah, you can shut down Curry like that, but you&rsquo;ll just lose the game playing 3-on-4 with everyone else.</p>

<p>When it happened in college, Steph was doubled all game and held scoreless.</p>

<p>And his team won by 30.</p>

<p>Except for Westbrook. He loves Westbrook because he reminds him of himself, and the whole triple double shit brought Oscar Robertson back into the general NBA media conversation.</p>

<p>Westbrook at his peak raised the floor of any team he was on. But also lowered the ceiling of any team that had elite talent surrounding him. That’s why he can seem to be both overrated and underrated.</p>

      <label for="linqsxg" class="commentText"><p>He definitely wears his heart on his sleeve.  As someone who can overshare, get emotional, or say questionable things in the moment—I think I understand where some negativity comes from. I get it&rsquo;s part of the spectacle and the way some enjoy the game, but where&rsquo;s the empathy for other human beings?</p>

<p>The trouble I see is when fans can&rsquo;t appreciate the moment or what they have in another human being.</p>

<p>We could ask most on any professional team, and they&rsquo;d remember a player from their youth with more heart and hustle than they&rsquo;d ever have.  Maybe they weren&rsquo;t tall enough or had a career ending injury too young.  They wouldn&rsquo;t look back at the box score; they&rsquo;d remember the reason they didn&rsquo;t give up.</p>

      <label for="linxb5x" class="commentText"><p>Watching him play I always thought he could have been nearly as good as Gary Payton on defense. But he instead lollygagged and made bad decisions for most of his career.  He could have been as good as Jason Kidd at orchestrating an offense.  But even when getting his assists it didn&rsquo;t lead to as winning of basketball.  Westbrook is the biggest &ldquo;what if&rdquo; in NBA history since I&rsquo;ve been watching over the last 40+ years.  I like the guy.  He just didn&rsquo;t live up to his potential.  At times it seems like he worked against complementary basketball and being the best he could be to win game.</p>
