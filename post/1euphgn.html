      <label for="lilxtn1" class="commentText"><p>Winning the MVP (while obviously not a bad thing for his legacy), came with the side effect of putting a microscope on him, as well as expectations and comparisons that wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise have been there.</p>

<p>The microscope really exposed a lot of facets of his game (shooting, off-ball), which then quickly became apparent were not just not elite, but are actively awful.</p>

<p>In parts of his game, you could make strong arguments he&rsquo;s amongst the best ever, but his holes are just so massive that if you&rsquo;re comparing him to the peer group of MVP/All Timer caliber players, it&rsquo;s naturally going to elicit a reaction that he doesn&rsquo;t deserve to be in that conversation.</p>

<p>Realistically his conversation should have always been comparing him amongst other high quality all stars - with whom he would shine brightly in many ways and the team success expectations would have been much lower.</p>

      <label for="lim9171" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s also because he never seemed to learn or admit his weaknesses. I&rsquo;ve never seen someone with such a low bbiq on defense. Obviously I am bias, but it makes no sense that he&rsquo;s so bad on defense considering his wingspan, athletic ability, and build.</p>

<p>He doesn&rsquo;t deserve all the hate he gets, but he absolutely deserves the criticism of his game.</p>

      <label for="limqs3j" class="commentText"><p>Having watched quite a few of Russ&rsquo; games from college onward, I think part of the reason he is such a bad defender is exactly because of his athleticism. He got away with bad habits for years, even in the NBA, because he was such a superior athlete he could recover. But as his athleticism has started to dip, those moments of ball watching, being slightly more hung up on a screen, low basketball iq, etc. have been highlighted. Great athletes are often harolded as great defenders because they get to balls others think they can&rsquo;t get to, or make some highlight block or whatever - but half the reason those plays are needed are because they&rsquo;re out of position in the first place.</p>

<p>I think as time passes after he retires people will start to respect his game more. chasing triple doubles aside, he was a really fun player to watch and really impactful, especially when he was on teams that kinda sucked. I always felt like he was cursed with being good enough to elevate shitty players to be decent, but not adaptable enough to work alongside other star players, but he had so many chances to adapt and just didn&rsquo;t that he has to eventually start to take some of the blame.</p>

<p>Until you win it all, you are nothing. Lebron or Jordan without rings would be out of the top 10 <del>20</del> all time (yeah, 20 is a bit too much, but point still stands). Tatum and Jokic were on fraud-watch these last 2 years. Nowitsky, too, before 2011.</p>

<p>If Westbrook won just 1 ring in his career, i predict there would be half the &ldquo;hate&rdquo; there&rsquo;s right now around his persona.</p>

<p>A lot of stats without ring = empty stats. A lot of stats that lead to a ring = legend&rsquo;s stuff. I don&rsquo;t know, it seems a bit too extremist as a way of thinking.</p>

      <label for="lim76zd" class="commentText"><p>Lebron or MJ would still be in the top 20. That&rsquo;s a dumb argument. 4 and 6x MVPs aren&rsquo;t lower than top 20 players.</p>

<p>Malone and Barkley are typically ranked in the top 20 and they don&rsquo;t have a chip.</p>

      <label for="limh62n" class="commentText"><p>Also, his performance is noticeably worse in the playoffs.  Inefficient, high turnovers and critical low IQ plays at key moments. From my perspective, he is the worst MVP in recent memory. Some may say D Rose but for me it&rsquo;s Russ. He shot 42% FG in his MVP season and was blatantly chasing triple doubles. Which is fine but then he went on to shoot 30 percent from the field in the playoffs while averaging 6 turnovers. As an opponent, at that kind of inefficiency I want you to take all the shots.</p>

<p>I am not saying he is not a great player but I think he won&rsquo;t be the choice for number one or number two option in the playoffs if you want to win it all. No shooting and low BBIQ (both offense and defense) is probably not what you want from your primary or secondary player. Especially, if that player plays PG. Then the question arises is he good as a third guy or role player for a contender? Well not really. So, his value is getting good numbers on a bad team with high usage and constant ball in his hand. He will give you all star numbers which is great.</p>

<p>People didn&rsquo;t like how WB was racking up triple doubles, the injuries took a toll on his shot and people started running with narratives about how unskilled he was.</p>

<p>At his peak, he was arguably the best playmaker in basketball. He could create advantages like few could.</p>

<p>He basically never moved off-ball. If he passed, the play was over as far as he was concerned. His off-ball defense was completely non-existent.</p>

<p>He was a great player with some amazing strengths. You&rsquo;re right that he was an incredible playmaker.</p>

<p>But the idea that he wasn&rsquo;t bad at anything? C&rsquo;mon. Why treat him like Kim Jung Il?</p>

<p>Russ will always play 100% his heart out effort. He is a dynamite player that dominates the ball and all aspects of the game. Is what made him great and why he&rsquo;s had such a long NBA career.</p>

<p>Russ as a passive role player is useless you can get 100 other ones that are better. He just happens to have a play style that doesn&rsquo;t age well but it&rsquo;s what made him the player he is. It&rsquo;s on the coaching staff to figure out where he fits and how to use him properly. If he changes his game he&rsquo;ll be immediately out of the league.</p>

<p>Problem is people keep trying to get him on stacked all star teams but he is better suited as a no. 2 option on a younger team.  I could see him working well for someone like Orlando Magic.</p>

<p>Except for Westbrook. He loves Westbrook because he reminds him of himself, and the whole triple double shit brought Oscar Robertson back into the general NBA media conversation.</p>

<p>Westbrook at his peak raised the floor of any team he was on. But also lowered the ceiling of any team that had elite talent surrounding him. That’s why he can seem to be both overrated and underrated.</p>

      <label for="lim7exb" class="commentText"><p>As a certified Westbrook hater, I think Rus has gotten a pretty fair shake. He won an MVP, put up some historic numbers, and made a ton of all star games.</p>

<p>That doesn’t stop him from being a super inefficient shooter and terrible off-ball player. I always believed no team with him as the #1 option could feasibly win a championship.</p>

<p>Now in the twilight of his career, is he gonna lean into the spark plug creator that made him an all-star, or the ball-centric shot chucker that made me a hater? Both sides will be aspects of his legacy regardless.</p>

      <label for="lim791n" class="commentText"><p>Westbrook and Harden had the green light to do WHATEVER they wanted stat padding etc. Never won a damn thing no matter how much talent around them. No defense, Ball dominant, shot jacking garbage play. Neither can play off ball or score with efficiency low 40s fg%  turnover machines. The Era of the most overated low skilled player&rsquo;s ever.</p>
