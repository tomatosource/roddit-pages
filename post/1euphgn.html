      <label for="lilxtn1" class="commentText"><p>Winning the MVP (while obviously not a bad thing for his legacy), came with the side effect of putting a microscope on him, as well as expectations and comparisons that wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise have been there.</p>

<p>The microscope really exposed a lot of facets of his game (shooting, off-ball), which then quickly became apparent were not just not elite, but are actively awful.</p>

<p>In parts of his game, you could make strong arguments he&rsquo;s amongst the best ever, but his holes are just so massive that if you&rsquo;re comparing him to the peer group of MVP/All Timer caliber players, it&rsquo;s naturally going to elicit a reaction that he doesn&rsquo;t deserve to be in that conversation.</p>

<p>Realistically his conversation should have always been comparing him amongst other high quality all stars - with whom he would shine brightly in many ways and the team success expectations would have been much lower.</p>

Obviously I am bias, but it makes no sense that he&rsquo;s so bad on defense considering his wingspan, athletic ability, and build.</p>

<p>He doesn&rsquo;t deserve all the hate he gets, but he absolutely deserves the criticism of his game.</p>

      <label for="lim6612" class="commentText"><p>Also the lack of rings hurts too much these days.</p>

<p>Until you win it all, you are nothing. Lebron or Jordan without rings would be out of the top 10 <del>20</del> all time (yeah, 20 is a bit too much, but point still stands). Tatum and Jokic were on fraud-watch these last 2 years. Nowitsky, too, before 2011.</p>

<p>If Westbrook won just 1 ring in his career, i predict there would be half the &ldquo;hate&rdquo; there&rsquo;s right now around his persona.</p>

<p>A lot of stats without ring = empty stats. A lot of stats that lead to a ring = legend&rsquo;s stuff. I don&rsquo;t know, it seems a bit too extremist as a way of thinking.</p>

      <label for="lim7fgl" class="commentText"><p>I personally feel like the reverse is true. He has been borderline unplayable the last few years and yet his teammates tend to love him despite his woes as an individual player. I’d say he’s more of a team player who can raise the ceiling of a terrible roster but a bad player in any other environment. </p>

<p>It’s pretty easy to see why he’s annoying imo</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“[Curry] has shot well because of what’s going on in basketball today. In basketball today, it’s almost like if you can dunk or make a three-point shot, you’re the greatest thing since sliced bread&hellip;there have been some great shooters in the past&hellip;but here again, when I played&hellip;if you shot outside and hit it, the next time I’m going to be up on top of you. I’m going to pressure you with three-quarters, half-court defense. But now they don’t do that. These coaches do not understand the game of basketball, as far as I’m concerned.”</p>

<p>That doesn’t stop him from being a super inefficient shooter and terrible off-ball player. I always believed no team with him as the #1 option could feasibly win a championship.</p>

<p>Now in the twilight of his career, is he gonna lean into the spark plug creator that made him an all-star, or the ball-centric shot chucker that made me a hater? Both sides will be aspects of his legacy regardless.</p>

      <label for="limg7yr" class="commentText"><p>If OKC were committed to building a squad around him in his prime, they could have contended.</p>

<p>His luck: he went to a small market, and only the elite of the greats were to switch teams and succeed while leading different squads.</p>

<p>Oscar was able to team up with KAJ to win his.</p>

      <label for="lim791n" class="commentText"><p>Westbrook and Harden had the green light to do WHATEVER they wanted stat padding etc. Never won a damn thing no matter how much talent around them. No defense, Ball dominant, shot jacking garbage play. Neither can play off ball or score with efficiency low 40s fg%  turnover machines. The Era of the most overated low skilled player&rsquo;s ever.</p>
