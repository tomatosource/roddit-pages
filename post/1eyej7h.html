<p>Truth is even if they chose Harden over Westbrook, Harden only became better then Westbrook AFTER KD would&rsquo;ve left. BTW Harden played with KD again after that, what happened ? Oh yeah they had bad injury luck just like Russ and KD, but I guess injury luck doesn&rsquo;t matter and I&rsquo;ll just say that like always Harden came up short when it mattered (which isn&rsquo;t true)</p>

<p>I don’t agree with this, I felt like Harden was better than Westbrook not too long after he established his self in Houston. Like around 2014 &amp; honestly I think he would have been better on OKC than Russ anyway, Russ was not a great decision maker &amp; watching him &amp; KD play often turned into your turn, my turn. Russ was more athletic than Harden so what he was doing you can’t teach. </p>

<p>Harden before he joined up with KD in Brooklyn was an Ironman pretty much, dude didn’t really get injured. Hamstrings are tricky though, I absolutely believe OKC is a better team with a Harden &amp; KD duo for the future rather than Russ &amp; KD though. Ofcourse hindsight is 2020 but I thought Harden was nice when he was coming off the bench </p>

<p>Westbrook has never outplayed KD or Harden in the playoffs.  You’re delusional.</p>

      <label for="ljcr5ul" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I have to agree with you. Harden &amp; KD would have been a much more interesting duo imo, I just did not like watching Russ’s decision making. I feel like Harden would have unlocked more potential for OKC than Russ, like yeah Russ was incredibly athletic &amp; great in the fast break but I kind of feel like we were blinded by that.</p>

<p>Harden &amp; KD would have meshed really well, I wonder if KD would step more into a vocal leader role though. If I remember correctly I feel like he tried more early OKC? Maybe I’m misremembering though. I wish I could have seen Harden &amp; KD grow together </p>
