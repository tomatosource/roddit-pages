<blockquote>
<p>At some point, Houston is going to make a move on the trade market. This organization is looking to significantly upgrade their roster and make a legitimate playoff push during the upcoming season. How Sheppard has played in Las Vegas, as well as how he begins the new season off the bench, will have a direct impact on Green&rsquo;s future with the organization.</p>

<p>While many in Houston still believe in Green&rsquo;s abilities to be a featured long-term scoring option for them at the shooting guard position, the Rockets have shown more of a willingness to discuss his name in trade situations around the league, sources said. Houston has not attempted to move Green, other than for Bridges last season, his future is certainly more in question than that of Alperen Sengun, whom the organization views as a top-five center in the NBA right now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>​</p>

<p>With both Jalen Green and Alperen Şengün eligible for rookie extensions, both likely to be for the rookie max, and Houston having a wealth of talented young players, and Green is the most obvious trade candidate as he has yet to prove the highs he has shown have been consistent.</p>

If he has a great season, you either just sign him as soon as you can next year or you obviously match.   If he sucks this year, his price will more than likely come down.    Added bonus of having cap space still available next year until you match an offer or re-sign him.</p>

I feel better about him being a core player on a team in the playoffs, does need to get stronger and more viable as a sole center to really break out.

      <label for="lem6meh" class="commentText"><p>Mobley and Wagner got maxed and I just don&rsquo;t think either of them impact a game like Sengun. I think they are both very good, but there seems to be a sentiment of Sengun isn&rsquo;t worth max.</p>

<p>Sengun just eats any defender on him. His game is going to age great. His defense took a big jump with Ime and he was by and far our best player last year.</p>

<p>I really only watch Rockets so take it with a grain of salt, but I would take Sengun #1 in a re-draft. Cade has been dealt a shit hand in Detroit, so he could end up living up to the hype. But Sengun wows me almost every game he plays. Last year he consistently showed up in the 4th as our go to scorer.</p>

<p>I would watch more Sengun if I were you. He is our best player, who we go to in the 4th if we need an iso bucket, and was able to score even when guarded by elite defenders.</p>

<p>His defense was solid last year but I don&rsquo;t know what come up to the surface means, so not sure about that point.</p>

I’m ok with sign and trading him away if some team wants to overpay for him but I don’t think any team will if he has a season like his last 3. He’s a little underrated by r/nba but I wouldn’t pay him more than 23 mil a year as of now </p>

<p>It’s just mean to Steph what they are asking him to do at this point in his career in terms of carrying an offense and yeah Jalen Green isn’t the most efficient player so far in his career, but he has scoring versatility and athleticism that just doesn’t grow on trees. A lot of your All-Star shooting guards presently weren’t very efficient in their first few years in the league either.</p>

      <label for="len3wo1" class="commentText"><p>Rockets haven&rsquo;t even be willing to go the extension route yet with Sengun. He&rsquo;s gonna get one. But the Rockets are holding their fire, because they are due to have major cap space next year. FVV/Landale among others off the books. They&rsquo;re gonna look to make a major deal for a star and could have the ability to bring in a star via trade with cap space and unload that salary from a team, which will have value with the new apron rules.</p>

<p>Do that and wait to extend Sengun as we saw the Sixers do with Maxey. Jalen Green&rsquo;s future hinges on his play up to the deadline in February, but truly I&rsquo;d say after the first 25 games, 30 games. If the inconsistency is still there, if the defense hasn&rsquo;t taken another leap, he&rsquo;s gonna absolutely be on the block, as he should be&hellip;.and he will have suitors, because someone with his shotmaking talent doesn&rsquo;t come along often.</p>

<p>Jabari Smith is also someone who&rsquo;s gonna be on the block without a jump in performance. He&rsquo;s been worse than Jalen Green and Tari Eason is waiting in the wings.</p>

<p>The Rockets are still in fact finding mode, discovery mode, wanting to see who sinks/swims and who they will be building around going forward, so no way they&rsquo;re locking themselves into this core yet.</p>
