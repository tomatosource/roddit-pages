      <label for="l6icog4" class="commentText"><p>I think Biden held a press conference and announced this because he didn’t want international media twisting the narrative like they did with the last ceasefire debacle. </p>

<p>last time, the international press reported that Hamas had accepted a ceasefire proposal and put the onus on Israel to respond even though Israel hadn’t even seen the proposal and the new terms Hamas agreed to seemed to be dictated by Hamas (we later learned there was Egyptian espionage at play that sabotaged the deal) </p>

<p>This time Biden is making very clear whose court the ball is in. </p>

<p>Smart leadership, the international press can’t be trusted at this point.</p>

Even if Palestine is left a smoldering ruin, unable to defend itself, Israel will never let Egypt actually claim any ground there.

      <label for="l6ishsk" class="commentText"><p>The Egyptian military is its own rabbit hole.  It operates in a decent portion of the Egyptian economy and has pretty darn good equipment for the region.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it also utilizes unpopular conscription and has a focus on maintaining internal control.  That plus dividing its energy into turning profit means it is never really deployed in an effective fashion for external conflict, nor are large parts of it trained adequately for modern combat.</p>

<p>Your analysis on territory seems correct to me.  Weakening Hamas could reduce odds of radical influence in their territory though, and a weaker Israel might give them more leverage as a “reasonable”country in the area with international partners.</p>

<p>But now it is. Probably much worse with how our economy is. People are really angry at him but theyre too scared to sacrifice their life for a revolution.. But when you see how much egyptians fight each other regarding boycotting alone..</p>

<p>Yeah openly supporting Israel in such a way could be the flare that brings Sisi and his regime down.</p>

<p>As much as I want that man and his military rule to go, I dont think its a good idea at all for another revolution to come so suddenly</p>

      <label for="l6iypil" class="commentText"><p>As an outsider, it seems to me that Egypt stands for Egypt.</p>

<p>A lot of the politics in the Middle East are scars from the Cold War when global super powers wanted you to either join Club West or the USSR, bloc. For a while, Islamism was seen as a third option but most Muslim majority nations don&rsquo;t really have an interest in Islamism as a political group. Saudi Arabia and Iran are in a tug of war over who gets to be the face of an Islamic bloc, but nations like Turkey and Egypt have the opportunities to not play the game. For a lot of the Middle East, Israel vs Palestine is the rallying cry for Islamism as a political identity separate from the so-called West, but this doesn&rsquo;t define the word stage anymore. Israel&rsquo;s been a nation for a while, regardless any representation, and for that reason more nations like Egypt see a value in staying neutral on the conflict and trading with whoever serves their interest.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like Egypt want to conquer the Gaza strip, but a powerful/stable Israel and Palestine means more ships paying the toll for the Suez</p>

<p>Especially because Egypt hosts quite a lot of american or European tourists who ive personally interacted with. The last thing egypt needs is for a bus full of old rich tourists to explode, and im sure our government knows that</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not clear if they are lying or not. Egyptian government has some people that make money from Hamas&rsquo; smuggling operations at Rafah border. Egypt foreign policy is also somewhat two sided with Israel. They have a strong security partnership, but they also like Israel being bogged down, helps with their negotiating position.
It could be a rogue diplomat. But there is a chance, they were hoping to put more pressure on Israel.</p>

<p>Either this is a genuine last ditch effort to get the hostages back, or Israel and the US don&rsquo;t believe Hamas will take the deal and are trying to make sure the world knows whose at fault.</p>

I follow generalist national and international press, I can&rsquo;t really imagine where you could get something approximating a more reasonable overview of events than there. Israeli and Arab press are useful as a comparison tool to see the internal perspective, but I don&rsquo;t want to get my news from the parties directly involved in the conflict.</p>

<p>Every time there&rsquo;s an article on Israel-Palestine I hear people saying that &lsquo;the press&rsquo; is lying to everyone all the time or whatever, but I can never figure out what better sources we can use, unless I am meant to just pick my preferred primary state department source to get my info diet from.</p>

      <label for="l6iv584" class="commentText"><p>To be honest there is no true reliable press. Unfortunately, They&rsquo;re all driven by bias and not integrity</p>

<p>Best way to analyse this is to read up on history (check your sources too)
And analyze news and people&rsquo;s perspectives from both sides and from neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>For Arab news is also important to note what they tell to middle eastern audiences may tell a different narrative from what Arab news say to westerners.</p>

<p>Not that western media is exactly honest but it&rsquo;s important to be aware what is exactly told to different audiences</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also best not to jump into conclusions and take everything in face value. Always wait until more details is revealed.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the most advice I can give you.</p>

      <label for="l6j8pvx" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not easy, but the most important thing in general is to be patient with breaking news because that&rsquo;s where misinformation is most common.  It doesn&rsquo;t hurt me at all to wait a few days, weeks or months to form a strong opinion on an event until there&rsquo;s enough evidence and I understand what happened well enough.</p>

<p>When it comes to legal things like the various ICJ rulings that have been misreported those are public record so I try to read them myself to see if they match what I&rsquo;m being told.  I&rsquo;m not a legal expert though so I&rsquo;ll hold any insights I read from it lightly until I also try to look for less biased legal experts to comment on it and see if I can match up what they say to the document or any relevant history they&rsquo;re mentioning.</p>

<p>For history I think it&rsquo;s important to try to read primary sources or their translations whenever possible and to avoid pop historians.  Even with more respected historians who can read the original languages I&rsquo;d generally try to read about the same things from both the Arab and Israeli perspective.</p>

<p>In general whether in or out of the I/P context never trust quotes or video clips without going and independently finding the context.  And keep in mind that while the situation seems intractable there have been a number of significant changes within both sides at various points in time so there&rsquo;s a tendency for propogandists to take a quote or policy from a decade or more before an event and try to apply it to the event.  Same with trying to figure out how much someone speaks for a cause at the time they said the thing, one person, even in a position of leadership, doesn&rsquo;t speak for millions of people on either side.  A lot of Israeli&rsquo;s hate Ben Gvir and a lot of Palestinians hate Sinwar, them being in leadership doesn&rsquo;t even mean everyone in their own parties agree with them.</p>

<p>But, again, above all, it&rsquo;s okay not to have a strong opinion for however long it takes to be able to do enough research to justify a strong opinion.</p>

<p>They are an investigative group that aims to back up every statement they make with publically available information. The catch here is that they can take weeks to &ldquo;break&rdquo; a story because they can spend so long verifying everything. They also focus on russia-related events.</p>

<p>Aside from that, you&rsquo;re best getting news from as many sources as possible <em>even things like al Jazeera</em>.</p>

<p>The goal is to be abe to build a bigger picture and understand bias in sources, so that you can parse the information you are getting. I also find just reddit comments are a useful source. They are&rsquo;t reliable but as the ancient adage goes; &ldquo;the best way to get accurate information is to post something wrong on the internet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first phase would last for six weeks &hellip; [and] would include a full and complete cease-fire, withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza, the release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly, the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners,&rdquo; Biden said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then phase two would be in exchange for the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, Israeli forces, with withdrawal from Gaza – and as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments, a temporary cease-fire would become, in the words of the Israeli proposal, a cessation of hostilities permanently,&rdquo; Biden continued.</p>

<p>Phase three would encompass &ldquo;a major reconstruction plan for Gaza,&rdquo; according to Biden, as well as the repatriation of the remains of deceased hostages to their families. &ldquo;The people of Israel should know they can make this offer without any further risk to their own security, because they&rsquo;ve devastated Hamas over the past eight months.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l6iufxn" class="commentText"><p>Saying that an entire population cannot ever be given freedom is quite a horrible thing to hear. Based on what you wrote, it seems like they can definitely be given freedom once you have better education in place and some stability is provided there. For instance - just spitballing - the UN can come in, govern the region, provide supplies, security, education, also maintain borders in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Do that for a generation or two and you have a more stable population.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>after <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> the US obliterated isis murdering millions in the process, no one ever told them to stop</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&rsquo;re confusing a few points. US didn&rsquo;t destroy any terrorist organizations - they still exist including numerous offshoots. You can kill leadership, definitely, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop terrorist organizations. This is particularly when recruiting is so easy: if you kill civilians during military operations then you&rsquo;ll get your next batch of recruits.</p>

<p>Also, US invaded Afghanistan to get Al Qaeda. US then invaded Iraq but not because of terrorist reasons. That invasion helped spawn ISIS. US defeated ISIS as far as they don&rsquo;t really have any territory anymore (though they&rsquo;ve spread to Africa) but the issue with terrorists groups is that you cannot militarily defeat them. You can kill the leaders, maybe disrupt some finances, but more members join for numerous reasons - including being children of civilians who died as a result of counter-terrorist organizations. By waging unending war, you plant fresh crops of terrorists with every engagement by spilling blood of innocent people.</p>

<p>I have some hope for the region because another lengthy - and bloody - conflict that was also related to religion had a relatively peaceful end: Northern Ireland. The situation is a bit different but it was resolved not by having to indefinitely kill terrorists but to make changes, include the more reasonable leaders in power sharing agreements, and moderate the situation gradually. I think that what needs to happen here. For instance, bring Fatah in - who is more moderate - and with UN&rsquo;s help, stabilize the region with local Arabs (i.e. Fatah) which would decrease Hamas claims to the area which would now be handled by Fatah instead. Definitely change the educational materials and build (rebuild?) schools. UN can help and after some time, terrorism won&rsquo;t be so enticing. People will be fed, clothed, [properly] educated (i.e. not taught anti-semitism, etc), and since nobody is losing any houses to settlers and nobody is bombnig anymore, why would someone join a terrorist group when things are looking up.</p>

<p>I agree in theory but UNRWA and UNIFL have been incompetent and that basically <em>has</em> been the plan since 2005.</p>

      <label for="l6ir1ne" class="commentText"><p>Several things:</p>

<p>The US reconstruction in Japan was sweeping and lasted almost a decade. The average Japanese citizen had a significantly higher standard of living a decade post-war than they did at the end of the war.</p>

<p>US troops supplied massive food aid across the country. They <strong>declined</strong> to dissolve the well respected monarchy while simultaneously transitioning the actual role of government to democracy, including the enfranchising women. Established a constitution, abolished the state religion (enabling the still large Buddhist population to practice their faith openly), established labor standards and weakened large industrial conglomerates (ironically an attempt to weaken Japan&rsquo;s industrial potential but almost certainly having the opposite effect).</p>

<p>They didn&rsquo;t just leave the Japanese people to live in squalor post war. It was possibly the greatest case of intentional nation building in history.</p>

<p>That would be because Israel takes the land and declares it part of Israel.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You mean the 2 state solution that <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/21/middleeast/netanyahu-palestinian-sovereignty-two-state-solution-intl/index.html" target="_blank">Israel&rsquo;s current government rejects</a>?</p>

<p>Just curious, how would you feel if an occupying force stole your land and gaslit the world into thinking that it always belonged to them, and now they&rsquo;re not only stealing land, but murdering your children (even before Oct 7) and trying to establish sovereign control over you?</p>

      <label for="l6inxqw" class="commentText"><p>Someone made an interesting point the other day, which is that the Iron Dome technology Israel has been using to intercept rockets and minimize casualties has been, oddly enough, a PR disaster. Because they keep winding up in these scenarios where they are being actively attacked by Hamas but suffering minimal casualties due to their extensive and extremely expensive counter measures. But when Israel responds to attempts at mass murder by bombing the attackers, more people die on the attackers&rsquo; side and then they cry to the international community about how disproportionate the response was.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s this perception that Israel is supposed to just sit here and spend billions after billions on shooting down rockets because it would be totally unfair to shoot back before enough people died.</p>

      <label for="l6is7v5" class="commentText"><p>yes but your comment is creating a sense of some sort of equivalence from the two sides, which is crazy.  One side (Israel) is always reacting to the other (Hamas).  In 2005, Israel pulled out of the strip, leaving greenhouses, infrastructure, facilities, etc.  Prior to the Intifada, there was freedom of movement between Gaza and Israel.  The walls were put up in response to suicide attacks.  The blockade was enacted after a terrorist group took over Gaza.  The bombings are in response to the biggest terrorist attack, probably of all time.  There is no Gaza war if Hamas does not attack Israel.  There is no more bombardment if Hamas surrenders.</p>

There are bad actors on both sides, but the bulk of it is on the Palestinians. I hold them most responsible since they are the ones who deliberately screw up ceasefires and two state solutions, commit near constant terrorism and they are fine with sacrificing their children. I lose sympathy for people who refuse to admit they lost and deliberately murder their children.</p>

<p>And don’t you fucking dare claim that terrorism is understandable. They kill people in OTHER countries beyond Israel. They’ve assassinated leaders. They’ve caused civil wars. They’re currently trying to hijack American politics and throwing actual Americans under the bus to NOT help themselves with Trumps election lmao. So their ideas are also stupid as well as wrong.</p>

      <label for="l6iwp5m" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s complicated. The territory in the West Bank is divided up into a few areas under the Oslo accords, areas A and B are administered by the Palestinians and jointly by the Palestinians and Israel respectively. There is no settlement activity in either, Palestinians are recognised by everyone as having a claim.</p>

<p>Area C is where it gets interesting. It&rsquo;s administered solely by Israel under military law. Israel do not recognise there as having been any recognised previous owner. Parts of the international community argue that there&rsquo;s a violation of article 4 of the Geneva convention when Israelis settle in the area, Israel argue that they aren&rsquo;t deporting anyone to area C so article 4 can&rsquo;t possibly apply.</p>

<p>And <em>then</em> it gets complicated. Eg. There have been a bunch of random UN resolutions over the years (documents that are distinctly <em>not</em> laws or treaties).</p>

<p>TL;DR it&rsquo;s a clusterfuck, random international scholars say different things, Israel actually controls and administers the area according to multilateral international treaty and says they&rsquo;re not doing anything wrong. I think they should probably not let their citizens build settlements there, but technically it&rsquo;s theirs to administer as they see fit and they&rsquo;re abiding by the treaty, even if they&rsquo;re being dicks about it :shrug:</p>

Now, the day after a guilty on 34 count conviction for the ex-president, this comes out? Its like they have less faith now in the blank check they were hoping for?</p>

      <label for="l6iub3v" class="commentText"><p>The Israeli statement was that combat can last through the end of the year. It wasn’t tied to the US election, it was tied to the calendar.   The statement was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are now in the fifth month of 2024, which means we expect another seven months of fighting to deepen our achievements and achieve our goal of destroying the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas and Islamic Jihad</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, the US election is in a little over 5 months, not seven. And I believe Israel made its proposal a couple days ago. Biden is making a speech about it now, I <em>think</em> because the proposal was barely reported in the press and when it was reported it was with a pro-Hamas slant.</p>

Forgive me but how can you make a deal without major player being part of it?  How is this different to what happened with Egypt two weeks ago?</p>

<p>I was reading the terms of the deal and they suck from Israeli perspective- if they were not involved or agreed to it this would make perfect sense.  WTH</p>

      <label for="l6ivsc9" class="commentText"><p>Some more details from <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw8860gn1nwo" target="_blank">the BBC</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Speaking at the White House on Friday, Mr Biden said that the first phase of the proposed plan would include a &ldquo;full and complete ceasefire&rdquo;, the withdrawal of IDF forces from populated areas and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is truly a decisive moment,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Hamas says it wants a ceasefire. This deal is an opportunity to prove whether they really mean it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ceasefire, he added, would allow more humanitarian aid to reach the beleaguered territory, with &ldquo;600 trucks carrying aid into Gaza every single day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The second phase would see all remaining living hostages returned, including male soldiers. The ceasefire would then become &ldquo;the cessation of hostilities, permanently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In his speech, Mr Biden acknowledged that negotiations between phase one and phase two would be difficult.</p>

<p>The third phase would see the final remains of any deceased Israeli hostages returned, as well as a &ldquo;major reconstruction plan&rdquo; with US and international assistance to rebuild homes, schools and hospitals.</p>

      <label for="l6ilh4m" class="commentText"><p>The article you linked actually broke it down fairly well imo.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of the aid to Israel, some <span class="math inline">\(5.2 billion will go toward replenishing and expanding Israel’s missile and rocket defense system; another \)</span>3.5 billion will go to purchasing advanced weapons systems; <span class="math inline">\(1 billion to enhance weapons production; \)</span>4.4 billion for other defense supplies and services provided to Israel; and some $2.4 billion to US operations in the region amid the Gaza war</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of that aid, I anticipate most would still go to Israel, as it&rsquo;s all things our government is fine with giving them anyway even absent conflict.</p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t want peace and they don&rsquo;t care about Palestinians - they want power for themselves and their primary mean to get it is to kill all the jews.</p>
