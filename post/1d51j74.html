      <label for="l6icog4" class="commentText"><p>I think Biden held a press conference and announced this because he didn’t want international media twisting the narrative like they did with the last ceasefire debacle. </p>

<p>last time, the international press reported that Hamas had accepted a ceasefire proposal and put the onus on Israel to respond even though Israel hadn’t even seen the proposal and the new terms Hamas agreed to seemed to be dictated by Hamas (we later learned there was Egyptian espionage at play that sabotaged the deal) </p>

<p>This time Biden is making very clear whose court the ball is in. </p>

<p>Smart leadership, the international press can’t be trusted at this point.</p>

      <label for="l6ishsk" class="commentText"><p>The Egyptian military is its own rabbit hole.  It operates in a decent portion of the Egyptian economy and has pretty darn good equipment for the region.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it also utilizes unpopular conscription and has a focus on maintaining internal control.  That plus dividing its energy into turning profit means it is never really deployed in an effective fashion for external conflict, nor are large parts of it trained adequately for modern combat.</p>

<p>Your analysis on territory seems correct to me.  Weakening Hamas could reduce odds of radical influence in their territory though, and a weaker Israel might give them more leverage as a “reasonable”country in the area with international partners.</p>

<p>A lot of the politics in the Middle East are scars from the Cold War when global super powers wanted you to either join Club West or the USSR, bloc. For a while, Islamism was seen as a third option but most Muslim majority nations don&rsquo;t really have an interest in Islamism as a political group. Saudi Arabia and Iran are in a tug of war over who gets to be the face of an Islamic bloc, but nations like Turkey and Egypt have the opportunities to not play the game. For a lot of the Middle East, Israel vs Palestine is the rallying cry for Islamism as a political identity separate from the so-called West, but this doesn&rsquo;t define the word stage anymore. Israel&rsquo;s been a nation for a while, regardless any representation, and for that reason more nations like Egypt see a value in staying neutral on the conflict and trading with whoever serves their interest.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like Egypt want to conquer the Gaza strip, but a powerful/stable Israel and Palestine means more ships paying the toll for the Suez</p>

      <label for="l6izsh4" class="commentText"><p>Things in Egypt are a bit unstable now too. Sisi got his job because he presented himself as a savior from Morsi/Muslim Brotherhood. And his supporters always used the line &ldquo;At least its not as bad as when Morsi was in charge&rdquo;</p>

<p>But now it is. Probably much worse with how our economy is. People are really angry at him but theyre too scared to sacrifice their life for a revolution.. But when you see how much egyptians fight each other regarding boycotting alone..</p>

<p>Yeah openly supporting Israel in such a way could be the flare that brings Sisi and his regime down.</p>

<p>As much as I want that man and his military rule to go, I dont think its a good idea at all for another revolution to come so suddenly</p>

They don’t want Palestinian refugees flooding in, they don’t want Muslim Brotherhood Islamists toppling the current regime, they wouldn’t take Gaza if it were free, and the last Egyptian head of state who signed a peace accord with Israel got riddled with bullets.</p>

I follow generalist national and international press, I can&rsquo;t really imagine where you could get something approximating a more reasonable overview of events than there. Israeli and Arab press are useful as a comparison tool to see the internal perspective, but I don&rsquo;t want to get my news from the parties directly involved in the conflict.</p>

<p>Every time there&rsquo;s an article on Israel-Palestine I hear people saying that &lsquo;the press&rsquo; is lying to everyone all the time or whatever, but I can never figure out what better sources we can use, unless I am meant to just pick my preferred primary state department source to get my info diet from.</p>

      <label for="l6iv584" class="commentText"><p>To be honest there is no true reliable press. Unfortunately, They&rsquo;re all driven by bias and not integrity</p>

<p>Best way to analyse this is to read up on history (check your sources too)
And analyze news and people&rsquo;s perspectives from both sides and from neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>For Arab news is also important to note what they tell to middle eastern audiences may tell a different narrative from what Arab news say to westerners.</p>

<p>Not that western media is exactly honest but it&rsquo;s important to be aware what is exactly told to different audiences</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also best not to jump into conclusions and take everything in face value. Always wait until more details is revealed.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the most advice I can give you.</p>

      <label for="l6j8pvx" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not easy, but the most important thing in general is to be patient with breaking news because that&rsquo;s where misinformation is most common.  It doesn&rsquo;t hurt me at all to wait a few days, weeks or months to form a strong opinion on an event until there&rsquo;s enough evidence and I understand what happened well enough.</p>

<p>When it comes to legal things like the various ICJ rulings that have been misreported those are public record so I try to read them myself to see if they match what I&rsquo;m being told.  I&rsquo;m not a legal expert though so I&rsquo;ll hold any insights I read from it lightly until I also try to look for less biased legal experts to comment on it and see if I can match up what they say to the document or any relevant history they&rsquo;re mentioning.</p>

<p>For history I think it&rsquo;s important to try to read primary sources or their translations whenever possible and to avoid pop historians.  Even with more respected historians who can read the original languages I&rsquo;d generally try to read about the same things from both the Arab and Israeli perspective.</p>

<p>In general whether in or out of the I/P context never trust quotes or video clips without going and independently finding the context.  And keep in mind that while the situation seems intractable there have been a number of significant changes within both sides at various points in time so there&rsquo;s a tendency for propogandists to take a quote or policy from a decade or more before an event and try to apply it to the event.  Same with trying to figure out how much someone speaks for a cause at the time they said the thing, one person, even in a position of leadership, doesn&rsquo;t speak for millions of people on either side.  A lot of Israeli&rsquo;s hate Ben Gvir and a lot of Palestinians hate Sinwar, them being in leadership doesn&rsquo;t even mean everyone in their own parties agree with them.</p>

<p>But, again, above all, it&rsquo;s okay not to have a strong opinion for however long it takes to be able to do enough research to justify a strong opinion.</p>

<p>They are an investigative group that aims to back up every statement they make with publically available information. The catch here is that they can take weeks to &ldquo;break&rdquo; a story because they can spend so long verifying everything. They also focus on russia-related events.</p>

<p>Aside from that, you&rsquo;re best getting news from as many sources as possible <em>even things like al Jazeera</em>.</p>

<p>The goal is to be abe to build a bigger picture and understand bias in sources, so that you can parse the information you are getting. I also find just reddit comments are a useful source. They are&rsquo;t reliable but as the ancient adage goes; &ldquo;the best way to get accurate information is to post something wrong on the internet.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l6ih09i" class="commentText"><p>the deal says nothing about alive hostages, it´s actually the worst deal i have ever seen, it doesn´t even demand the immediate release of all alive hostages, honestly biden would never make this deal for the us if these were his hostages</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first phase would last for six weeks &hellip; [and] would include a full and complete cease-fire, withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza, the release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly, the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners,&rdquo; Biden said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then phase two would be in exchange for the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, Israeli forces, with withdrawal from Gaza – and as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments, a temporary cease-fire would become, in the words of the Israeli proposal, a cessation of hostilities permanently,&rdquo; Biden continued.</p>

<p>Phase three would encompass &ldquo;a major reconstruction plan for Gaza,&rdquo; according to Biden, as well as the repatriation of the remains of deceased hostages to their families. &ldquo;The people of Israel should know they can make this offer without any further risk to their own security, because they&rsquo;ve devastated Hamas over the past eight months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What are you saying? George Bush&rsquo;s War on Terror is almost unanimously considered a mistake. The whole &lsquo;Iraq WMDs&rsquo; things is considered one of the most public and damaging intelligence failures of the modern world (if you don&rsquo;t think it was a willful lie). Modern politicians lie about having supported it out of shame. Protests against the Iraq War were the largest anti-war protests the US has since Vietnam.</p>

<p>In terms of international response, even major US allies opposed the war. The US/UK wanted to propose a resolution for war in the UN, but it was clear they wouldn&rsquo;t get even half the necessary votes, and France promised to veto it regardless.</p>

<p>The US being big enough and strong enough to push through international/domestic pressure and wage a failure of a war doesn&rsquo;t mean that every country should get a turn.</p>

      <label for="l6ir1ne" class="commentText"><p>Several things:</p>

<p>The US reconstruction in Japan was sweeping and lasted almost a decade. The average Japanese citizen had a significantly higher standard of living a decade post-war than they did at the end of the war.</p>

<p>US troops supplied massive food aid across the country. They <strong>declined</strong> to dissolve the well respected monarchy while simultaneously transitioning the actual role of government to democracy, including the enfranchising women. Established a constitution, abolished the state religion (enabling the still large Buddhist population to practice their faith openly), established labor standards and weakened large industrial conglomerates (ironically an attempt to weaken Japan&rsquo;s industrial potential but almost certainly having the opposite effect).</p>

<p>They didn&rsquo;t just leave the Japanese people to live in squalor post war. It was possibly the greatest case of intentional nation building in history.</p>

      <label for="l6ira77" class="commentText"><p>This is exactly how I read it as well. Israel would presumably control a huge buffer area on the Egyptian border to prevent weapons smuggling.  Also, given that the deepest smuggling tunnels under the border are thought to be 100 feet, it would not surprise me if Israel was to dig a trench 300 feet deep a half mile from the border.  And then 6 months later dig it another 50 feet deeper.</p>

I’m also sick of people genuinely believing that Hamas is the Rebel Alliance from Star wars. I WATCHED THE OCT 7 VIDEOS BECAUSE THEY UPLOADED THEMSELVES. If you gleefully kill dogs and kidnap children and light people’s houses on fire with them inside and then upload the video to brag about it, you can fuck all the way off to hell.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people can’t wrap their heads around the fact that this is not a binary conflict. There is no “good guy” and “bad guy” here, this is an extremely complex situation where both armies do not see the civilian populace on the other side as human.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Speaking at the White House on Friday, Mr Biden said that the first phase of the proposed plan would include a &ldquo;full and complete ceasefire&rdquo;, the withdrawal of IDF forces from populated areas and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is truly a decisive moment,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Hamas says it wants a ceasefire. This deal is an opportunity to prove whether they really mean it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ceasefire, he added, would allow more humanitarian aid to reach the beleaguered territory, with &ldquo;600 trucks carrying aid into Gaza every single day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The second phase would see all remaining living hostages returned, including male soldiers. The ceasefire would then become &ldquo;the cessation of hostilities, permanently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In his speech, Mr Biden acknowledged that negotiations between phase one and phase two would be difficult.</p>

<p>The third phase would see the final remains of any deceased Israeli hostages returned, as well as a &ldquo;major reconstruction plan&rdquo; with US and international assistance to rebuild homes, schools and hospitals.</p>

You might want to read about the Marshall Plan, the political payback, the American ownership of foreign infrastructure, the preferential trade agreements, and everything else that came out of using U.S. tax dollars to rebuild far larger regions that had been far more thoroughly destroyed. Much of the American economy, even today, is built on the preferential trade that comes from security guarantees the U.S. can logistically support because of the alliances that came out of those tax dollars.</p>

      <label for="l6iiu5g" class="commentText"><p>There are no settlements in Gaza and if Hamas cared about the people they represent (who still overwhelmingly support them) then they wouldn’t put them in this position in the first place. Their best course of action would be to have accepted one of the numerous two state solutions offered to them over the last 75 years instead of insisting on exterminating all Jews</p>

      <label for="l6inxqw" class="commentText"><p>Someone made an interesting point the other day, which is that the Iron Dome technology Israel has been using to intercept rockets and minimize casualties has been, oddly enough, a PR disaster. Because they keep winding up in these scenarios where they are being actively attacked by Hamas but suffering minimal casualties due to their extensive and extremely expensive counter measures. But when Israel responds to attempts at mass murder by bombing the attackers, more people die on the attackers&rsquo; side and then they cry to the international community about how disproportionate the response was.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s this perception that Israel is supposed to just sit here and spend billions after billions on shooting down rockets because it would be totally unfair to shoot back before enough people died.</p>

      <label for="l6is7v5" class="commentText"><p>yes but your comment is creating a sense of some sort of equivalence from the two sides, which is crazy.  One side (Israel) is always reacting to the other (Hamas).  In 2005, Israel pulled out of the strip, leaving greenhouses, infrastructure, facilities, etc.  Prior to the Intifada, there was freedom of movement between Gaza and Israel.  The walls were put up in response to suicide attacks.  The blockade was enacted after a terrorist group took over Gaza.  The bombings are in response to the biggest terrorist attack, probably of all time.  There is no Gaza war if Hamas does not attack Israel.  There is no more bombardment if Hamas surrenders.</p>

There are bad actors on both sides, but the bulk of it is on the Palestinians. I hold them most responsible since they are the ones who deliberately screw up ceasefires and two state solutions, commit near constant terrorism and they are fine with sacrificing their children. I lose sympathy for people who refuse to admit they lost and deliberately murder their children.</p>

<p>And don’t you fucking dare claim that terrorism is understandable. They kill people in OTHER countries beyond Israel. They’ve assassinated leaders. They’ve caused civil wars. They’re currently trying to hijack American politics and throwing actual Americans under the bus to NOT help themselves with Trumps election lmao. So their ideas are also stupid as well as wrong.</p>

      <label for="l6iwp5m" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s complicated. The territory in the West Bank is divided up into a few areas under the Oslo accords, areas A and B are administered by the Palestinians and jointly by the Palestinians and Israel respectively. There is no settlement activity in either, Palestinians are recognised by everyone as having a claim.</p>

<p>Area C is where it gets interesting. It&rsquo;s administered solely by Israel under military law. Israel do not recognise there as having been any recognised previous owner. Parts of the international community argue that there&rsquo;s a violation of article 4 of the Geneva convention when Israelis settle in the area, Israel argue that they aren&rsquo;t deporting anyone to area C so article 4 can&rsquo;t possibly apply.</p>

<p>And <em>then</em> it gets complicated. Eg. There have been a bunch of random UN resolutions over the years (documents that are distinctly <em>not</em> laws or treaties).</p>

<p>TL;DR it&rsquo;s a clusterfuck, random international scholars say different things, Israel actually controls and administers the area according to multilateral international treaty and says they&rsquo;re not doing anything wrong. I think they should probably not let their citizens build settlements there, but technically it&rsquo;s theirs to administer as they see fit and they&rsquo;re abiding by the treaty, even if they&rsquo;re being dicks about it :shrug:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are now in the fifth month of 2024, which means we expect another seven months of fighting to deepen our achievements and achieve our goal of destroying the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas and Islamic Jihad</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, the US election is in a little over 5 months, not seven. And I believe Israel made its proposal a couple days ago. Biden is making a speech about it now, I <em>think</em> because the proposal was barely reported in the press and when it was reported it was with a pro-Hamas slant.</p>

      <label for="l6jav4h" class="commentText"><p>You need to understand the current hierarchy, there are 4 elements at play here :</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>The Government</strong> - This is the coalition of parties governing the parliament, it has 64 of 120 parliament members (min req 61), they area the lawmakers and completely irrelevant for this topic unless they quit the government, I&rsquo;ll add an important note that it currently has an additional party of 12 members in the government solely for a &lsquo;war unity gov&rsquo; but if they quit nothing changes, the government only collapses if they go below 61</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Cabinet</strong> - This is the original forum for security and diplomacy matters (or anything very important), it currently has 6 permanent members from the coalition (4 Likud, 1 Religious Zionism, 1 Jewish Might, basically all the leaders) with an additional 7 members (3 Likud, 3 National Unity, 1 non affiliated minister), 1 observer, 5 permanent VIPs (AG, Chief of National Security+1, Military Secretary for PM+Defense Minister) and to close it all off, these meetings typically take place with a whole host of VIPs such as the Chief of Staff/ISA/Mossad and basically all the liaisons or important and relevant security personnel</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Technically speaking this is the &lsquo;real&rsquo; forum, but due to the war, the War Cabinet was established for faster  and dedicated decision making</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>The War Cabinet</strong> - This includes Netanyahu, Gallant (Defense Minister), Gantz (Opposition party leader that joined the gov solely for war purposes, currently Netanyahu&rsquo;s biggest political rival and former Chief of Staff) and a couple observers (one of which is also a former chief of staff), this is where all the real decisions are being made</p></li>

<li><p><strong>The Negotiators</strong> - assigned a mandate by the War Cabinet, which as stated received immense flexibility (this means Netanyahu didn&rsquo;t need to agree to 100% of it from the get go)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The term of the deal does suck for Israel, I believe Netanyahu relies on Hamas to fuck it up and ruin negotiations on the 3rd stage, afterwhich Israel may resume fighting but will already have all the hostages, a war with Lebanon might also overshadow all this deal, if we get the female hostages at the very least, Netanyahu will be relieved of A LOT of domestic pressure</p>

<p>From Israel&rsquo;s standpoint, this deals means returning to a worse state than oct 6, because all the &lsquo;axis of resistance&rsquo; (Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas and so on) are emboldened and will claim victory (They already do) and showcase that armed resistance is the only way to achieve their goals, Israel basically surrenders to get its hostages back and will return to war at a later date in worse conditions, especially if a 2 state solution is forced upon them</p>

<p>The US just wants it to end, they are hoping Gaza&rsquo;s hostilities ending will stop the Houtis and Hezbollah (and Iraq) from attacking too and they want to tie it all in with a Saudi normalization deal and a 2 state solution, all before elections, they are in for a disappointing reality&hellip;</p>
