      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ecrav7/70_of_lottery_picks_in_this_years_nba_draft_had/"><p>70% of Lottery Picks in this year&rsquo;s NBA Draft had at least 1 Immediate Family Member Play Professional or Division I College Basketball</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Every year it becomes more common that top NBA Draft picks have some sort of high level basketball connection.  This year, 10 of the 14 lottery selections had at least one link to a professional or Division I college basketball.</p>

<p>The first 14 NBA Draft picks immediate families combine for 4 NBA players, 6 overseas professional players who did not make the NBA, 3 Division I players who didn’t play professionally, and 3 professional coaches.  (Note: This does not count Bub Carrington’s second cousin, Rudy Gay)</p>

<p>Out of the 3 players with no professional basketball connection, Ron Holland is a 6’ 8” all world athlete and Zach Edey is a 7’ 4” giant, leaving Rob Dillingham (6’ 1”) as the only lottery pick to truly beat the incredible odds of making into the NBA without immense height or genetic connection to pro basketball.</p>

<p>Sources: Anything I could find on google or wikipedia for each player’s family.</p>

<ol>
<li>Zacchaire Risacher: Father Stephane was a all-star level player in the French basketball league for a decade and a key member of France’s National team.</li>
<li>Alex Sarr: Father Massar was a former pro basketball player for Senegal, brother Olivier played in NBA.</li>
<li>Reed Sheppard: Son of Jeff Sheppard, who played for Kentucky and was MOP on Kentucky’s national championship team before going to NBA. Mother Stacey Reed scored 1,400 points for the Kentucky Women’s team.</li>
<li>Stephon Castle: Dad played basketball at Wake Forest with Tim Duncan.</li>
<li>Ron Holland: No strong athletic connections (6’ 8”).</li>
<li>Tidjane Salaün: Older sister Janelle is a pro basketball player in France, and she is playing for France in this year’s Olympics.</li>
<li>Donovan Clingan: Mother Stacey played basketball at University of Maine.</li>
<li>Rob Dillingham: No strong athletic connections (6’ 1”).</li>
<li>Zach Edey: no strong pro connection (7’ 4”).</li>
<li>Cody Williams: Older brother Jalen Williams averaged 19 PPG for the OKC Thunder this past season.</li>
<li>Matas Buzelis: Grandpa Petras was a pro basketball player in Lithuania, mother Kristina played youth basketball for Lithuania’s national team, Dad Aidas was also a pro basketball player in Lithuania.</li>
<li>Nikola Topic: Father Milenko was a professional basketball player in Europe and won a silver medal for Yugoslavia in the 1996 Olympics. Milenko later became a head coach for professional teams in Serbia.</li>
<li>Devin Carter: Father Anthony played 13 years in the NBA before becoming an assistant coach in the NBA.</li>
<li>Bub Carrington: No immediate family members had a basketball connection but Bub’s second cousin is 17-year NBA veteran Rudy Gay.</li>

      <label for="lf1w5bo" class="commentText"><p>This makes sense.</p>

<p>As somebody involved in youth basketball and have kids currently involved, a lot of it (beyond genetics) is knowing the right people. You have to have access to training, have to know the right people for coaching, and even that is the bare minimum stuff for people who are trying to play at a high level in highschool or low level colleges.</p>

<p>Takes a huge time commitment from parents, and the people have to have some level of support system around them supporting their basketball journey.</p>

<p>So much more money is involved in it than it was when I was growing up. If you don’t come from a basketball family, it’s a huge culture shock to get involved in it. Combine the natural genetics that come from being related to high level athletes with the fact that the culture of playing and training and traveling is already familiar, and that they already have the connections, and it makes plenty of sense.</p>

<p>Takes great genetics, the right connections, and a ton of luck and work ethic to make it on a high level. Helps when a couple of those things are taken care of naturally</p>

      <label for="lf29vaa" class="commentText"><p>Yeah the entire culture of youth basketball and commitment required of the families nowadays is tough to navigate for the average family. A kid has major advantages over his peers if he has a parent that hooped at a high level and understands the sacrifices necessary to get there.</p>

<p>His peers may not have the same level of support and guidance that keeps them on a favorable trajectory and their becomes a lot more luck involved in getting them there. Its definitely not just the genetics factor, there&rsquo;s plenty of &ldquo;regular people&rdquo; or failed hoopers out there that do have great genetics (6&rsquo;3+ and windmilling) but didn&rsquo;t have the right support system. Even as fathers themselves, they cant guide or provide for their kid in the same way a former pro or scholarship level player with no student debt can.</p>

<p>Tbh would argue that the genetics are the least important part of the equation to become a future pro (overseas included), provided that the kid is 6&rdquo;ish barefoot which isnt freakishly tall.</p>

Also lets say it was your uncle, its aways easy to talk to some one who has walked the same path you are attempting to walk, rather then having no one to share the same experience.
Mentor is a key role</p>

      <label for="lf26z3j" class="commentText"><p>AAU and personal trainers weren’t a thing for most non-pros 30 years ago. So the playing field for wealthy and poor players was fairly even. </p>

<p>Since then, AAU costs and personal trainer fees make it much harder for poorer kids to make to the pinnacle. </p>

<p>I’d also add that the money pro athletes make went from really good in the 70s and 80s to some of the highest paying jobs on the planet starting in the 90s. A guy with a cup of coffee in the league in the 70s or 80s had to go work as an insurance broker after their career ended.</p>

<p>Pay is so high now, that a rookie contract provides generational wealth. You can then use that free time/money to pay for the best trainers, facilities, and travel teams.</p>

<p>Soccer - much more skill based than genetics based unlike basketball. Most of pros did not grow up rich</p>

<p>Baseball - genetics plays a large factor here, but most of the players are very normal dudes</p>

<p>Travel league basketball is also very expensive lol… sure anyone can pick up a ball and throw it in a hoop but that’s not all it takes to get into the NBA</p>

<p>Khan and Fury grew up middle class. Fury’s father was in jail and has like 5 kids… nobody is growing up rich that way</p>

We said with the genes of the nba unlike other sports, having height is by far the more important component for having a chance in the nba. So we all kinda agreed that in 20-30 years the nba would just be all the former nba stars kids running the league.  Obviously like this post says, relatives too, but I wouldn’t be shocked if this ends up being a major portion of the nba.</p>
