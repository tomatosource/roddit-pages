</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Every year it becomes more common that top NBA Draft picks have some sort of high level basketball connection.  This year, 10 of the 14 lottery selections had at least one link to a professional or Division I college basketball.</p>

<p>The first 14 NBA Draft picks immediate families combine for 4 NBA players, 6 overseas professional players who did not make the NBA, 3 Division I players who didn’t play professionally, and 3 professional coaches.  (Note: This does not count Bub Carrington’s second cousin, Rudy Gay)</p>

<p>Out of the 3 players with no professional basketball connection, Ron Holland is a 6’ 8” all world athlete and Zach Edey is a 7’ 4” giant, leaving Rob Dillingham (6’ 1”) as the only lottery pick to truly beat the incredible odds of making into the NBA without immense height or genetic connection to pro basketball.</p>

<p>Sources: Anything I could find on google or wikipedia for each player’s family.</p>

<ol>
<li>Zacchaire Risacher: Father Stephane was a all-star level player in the French basketball league for a decade and a key member of France’s National team.</li>
<li>Alex Sarr: Father Massar was a former pro basketball player for Senegal, brother Olivier played in NBA.</li>
<li>Reed Sheppard: Son of Jeff Sheppard, who played for Kentucky and was MOP on Kentucky’s national championship team before going to NBA. Mother Stacey Reed scored 1,400 points for the Kentucky Women’s team.</li>
<li>Stephon Castle: Dad played basketball at Wake Forest with Tim Duncan.</li>
<li>Ron Holland: No strong athletic connections (6’ 8”).</li>
<li>Tidjane Salaün: Older sister Janelle is a pro basketball player in France, and she is playing for France in this year’s Olympics.</li>
<li>Donovan Clingan: Mother Stacey played basketball at University of Maine.</li>
<li>Rob Dillingham: No strong athletic connections (6’ 1”).</li>
<li>Zach Edey: no strong pro connection (7’ 4”).</li>
<li>Cody Williams: Older brother Jalen Williams averaged 19 PPG for the OKC Thunder this past season.</li>
<li>Matas Buzelis: Grandpa Petras was a pro basketball player in Lithuania, mother Kristina played youth basketball for Lithuania’s national team, Dad Aidas was also a pro basketball player in Lithuania.</li>
<li>Nikola Topic: Father Milenko was a professional basketball player in Europe and won a silver medal for Yugoslavia in the 1996 Olympics. Milenko later became a head coach for professional teams in Serbia.</li>
<li>Devin Carter: Father Anthony played 13 years in the NBA before becoming an assistant coach in the NBA.</li>
<li>Bub Carrington: No immediate family members had a basketball connection but Bub’s second cousin is 17-year NBA veteran Rudy Gay.</li>

      <label for="lf2l8rt" class="commentText"><p>The short answer is genetic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean" target="_blank">regression to the mean</a>.</p>

<p>The medium length answer asks us to imagine a simplified, two-factor model of athletic success, in which basketball skill is a function of A) genetic advantages (height, build, et cetera), and B) everything else (modelled behaviour, elite coaching,  etc&hellip;). The particulars of these two components don&rsquo;t matter a great deal, but we can say that for any given level of overall athletic ability (e.g. for a 99.9th percentile athlete in a sport) there are many different combinations of A &amp; B that can allow an athlete to reach that level.</p>

<p>Further, we can say that A is more important than B to athletic success in a given sport if a decrease in the amount of A must be compensated by a larger increase B to maintain the same level in overall athletic success.</p>

<p>Turning back to children of elite athletes, applying the above model to the conversation in this thread, these children are assumed to have, essentially, maximal B. The best coaching, direct access to a mentor who&rsquo;s done it, connections, training from a young age, etc. But, while the expected genetic gifts of this child are certainly much, much higher than the average person, their expected value is still closer to the average human than their parents.</p>

<p>Putting it all together, if the tradeoff between A &amp; B is steep enough then the importance of those B factors begin to fade and competition for limited NBA spots comes down to one question: are you in the 99.999th percentile of athletes in terms of combined height and athleticism. And while the children of elite athletes are probably over-represented in that group, they&rsquo;re significantly out numbered by the random, exceptional outliers produced by the other 8 billion humans on the planet.</p>

<p>And, while the above is extremely crude and ignores important extraneous factors (see below) it&rsquo;s empirically validated by the higher presence of father/son and uncle/nephew pairs in the NHL and MLB.</p>

<p>Other factors: I expect that the children of, say, boxers largely don&rsquo;t became boxers because it&rsquo;s a bad job and their parents discourage them from doing so; I think it&rsquo;s possible the same applies to certain NFL positions. Also, there&rsquo;s been a significant and largely detrimental cultural shift towards accepting, or at least tolerating, elite athletic training for young children which probably effects all the above, although I don&rsquo;t have a strong conviction as to how.</p>

      <label for="lf1w5bo" class="commentText"><p>This makes sense.</p>

<p>As somebody involved in youth basketball and have kids currently involved, a lot of it (beyond genetics) is knowing the right people. You have to have access to training, have to know the right people for coaching, and even that is the bare minimum stuff for people who are trying to play at a high level in highschool or low level colleges.</p>

<p>Takes a huge time commitment from parents, and the people have to have some level of support system around them supporting their basketball journey.</p>

<p>So much more money is involved in it than it was when I was growing up. If you don’t come from a basketball family, it’s a huge culture shock to get involved in it. Combine the natural genetics that come from being related to high level athletes with the fact that the culture of playing and training and traveling is already familiar, and that they already have the connections, and it makes plenty of sense.</p>

<p>Takes great genetics, the right connections, and a ton of luck and work ethic to make it on a high level. Helps when a couple of those things are taken care of naturally</p>

Also lets say it was your uncle, its aways easy to talk to some one who has walked the same path you are attempting to walk, rather then having no one to share the same experience.
Mentor is a key role</p>

      <label for="lf29vaa" class="commentText"><p>Yeah the entire culture of youth basketball and commitment required of the families nowadays is tough to navigate for the average family. A kid has major advantages over his peers if he has a parent that hooped at a high level and understands the sacrifices necessary to get there.</p>

<p>His peers may not have the same level of support and guidance that keeps them on a favorable trajectory and there becomes a lot more luck involved in getting them there. Its definitely not just the genetics factor, there&rsquo;s plenty of &ldquo;regular people&rdquo; or failed hoopers out there that do have great genetics (6&rsquo;3+ and windmilling) but didn&rsquo;t have the right support system. Even as fathers themselves, they cant guide or provide for their kid in the same way a former pro or scholarship level player with no student debt can.</p>

<p>Tbh I would argue that the genetics are the least important part of the equation to become a future pro (overseas included), provided that the kid is 6&rsquo;ish barefoot which isnt freakishly tall.</p>

      <label for="lf2ldg7" class="commentText"><p>If you’re just starting out I’d recommend joining the local youth program, making sure the kid enjoys it, and it can branch out from there.</p>

<p>If they are already playing, You could probably find a local place that offers classes/camps for kids just looking online but There is a big range on this. I’ve found just talking to the parents of players who are excelling is a decent way to sort them. If there are three kids really standing out and they all take classes at the same place, it’s probably a decent place to get into. Once you find a good little spot doors kind of start to open as far as travel teams and stuff like that goes as they get a little bit older.</p>

<p>I can’t link directly, but about a quarter of the way down is a chart indicating % of players under 6 feet tall. You can see that there was an uptick in the 90s and 2000s followed by a drop off. </p>

<p>Since then, AAU costs and personal trainer fees make it much harder for poorer kids to make to the pinnacle. </p>

<p>I’d also add that the money pro athletes make went from really good in the 70s and 80s to some of the highest paying jobs on the planet starting in the 90s. A guy with a cup of coffee in the league in the 70s or 80s had to go work as an insurance broker after their career ended.</p>

<p>Pay is so high now, that a rookie contract provides generational wealth. You can then use that free time/money to pay for the best trainers, facilities, and travel teams.</p>

If Edey was just a tall Canadian dude in the 70s or 80s he just would have become a lumberjack or something. Since only a small amount of people have the genetics to end up 7&rsquo;4 then it&rsquo;s a pretty small pool to draw talent from.</p>

      <label for="lf24glh" class="commentText"><p>My friends and I talked about this back when Bronny initially started getting real nba hype ~2018-19’. We said with the genes of the nba unlike other sports, having height is by far the more important component for having a chance in the nba. So we all kinda agreed that in 20-30 years the nba would just be all the former nba stars kids running the league.  Obviously like this post says, relatives too, but I wouldn’t be shocked if this ends up being a major portion of the nba.</p>

My parents were a mechanic and a waitress.  I didn’t have connections, but got to where I was by working hard and out working everyone.</p>

<p>But a lot of people in those programs got there by working smarter.  They were setup for success, knew what questions to ask, what to focus on, which faculty to work with, etc.</p>

<p>I’m a public librarian now and I spent time with high schoolers sharing my advice when applying for scholarships and targeting what program to go to and giving them advice on what faculty to talk to once they’re there.</p>

<p>Same thing holds true in sports.  You have to know what coaches to go to, what summer programs to compete in, that leads to invites to special camps, endorsements, visits from college coaches, you know what program is best for your skill set, etc.</p>

The NBA is easily the major sport with the highest correlation with genetics due to the benefits that follow from height and with the worldwide popularity of the sport, pretty much anyone 6&rsquo;8 and above throughout the world born after 1992 has been scouted and approached by a basketball coach sometime in their lives so there&rsquo;s no more undiscovered tall people to bring in new family trees. Not to mention the developmental benefits that come along with having a professional athlete father/relative.</p>

      <label for="lf2hefj" class="commentText"><p>Second cousins being included is a bit of a stretch lol but the general point def makes sense. Seems like lots of guys are sons of pros nowadays or at least parents or a parent who played in college. The Lebrons of the world are extreme outliers obviously for how incredible he became despite poverty and homelessness but that’s gonna become almost obsolete eventually with AAU and the sport costing more to play.</p>

      <label for="lf2l4zp" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s crazy the amount of children of NBA players with draft expectations or playing high level D1 basketball</p>

<p>I just wonder if it&rsquo;s some level of nepotism like Bronny. Like say with Matt Barnes twins, I&rsquo;m sure any top AAU team, trainer, or coach would love to take them in just to say &ldquo;I have Matt Barnes kids on my team&rdquo; plus the publicity and attention of Matt Barnes attending games. Same with college, I&rsquo;m sure UCLA would gladly recruit them knowing former alum Matt Barnes would show up to games and help them sell more tix.</p>
