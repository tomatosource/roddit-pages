</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Every year it becomes more common that top NBA Draft picks have some sort of high level basketball connection.  This year, 10 of the 14 lottery selections had at least one link to a professional or Division I college basketball.</p>

<p>The first 14 NBA Draft picks immediate families combine for 4 NBA players, 6 overseas professional players who did not make the NBA, 3 Division I players who didn’t play professionally, and 3 professional coaches.  (Note: This does not count Bub Carrington’s second cousin, Rudy Gay)</p>

<p>Out of the 3 players with no professional basketball connection, Ron Holland is a 6’ 8” all world athlete and Zach Edey is a 7’ 4” giant, leaving Rob Dillingham (6’ 1”) as the only lottery pick to truly beat the incredible odds of making into the NBA without immense height or genetic connection to pro basketball.</p>

<p>Sources: Anything I could find on google or wikipedia for each player’s family.</p>

<ol>
<li>Zacchaire Risacher: Father Stephane was a all-star level player in the French basketball league for a decade and a key member of France’s National team.</li>
<li>Alex Sarr: Father Massar was a former pro basketball player for Senegal, brother Olivier played in NBA.</li>
<li>Reed Sheppard: Son of Jeff Sheppard, who played for Kentucky and was MOP on Kentucky’s national championship team before going to NBA. Mother Stacey Reed scored 1,400 points for the Kentucky Women’s team.</li>
<li>Stephon Castle: Dad played basketball at Wake Forest with Tim Duncan.</li>
<li>Ron Holland: No strong athletic connections (6’ 8”).</li>
<li>Tidjane Salaün: Older sister Janelle is a pro basketball player in France, and she is playing for France in this year’s Olympics.</li>
<li>Donovan Clingan: Mother Stacey played basketball at University of Maine.</li>
<li>Rob Dillingham: No strong athletic connections (6’ 1”).</li>
<li>Zach Edey: no strong pro connection (7’ 4”).</li>
<li>Cody Williams: Older brother Jalen Williams averaged 19 PPG for the OKC Thunder this past season.</li>
<li>Matas Buzelis: Grandpa Petras was a pro basketball player in Lithuania, mother Kristina played youth basketball for Lithuania’s national team, Dad Aidas was also a pro basketball player in Lithuania.</li>
<li>Nikola Topic: Father Milenko was a professional basketball player in Europe and won a silver medal for Yugoslavia in the 1996 Olympics. Milenko later became a head coach for professional teams in Serbia.</li>
<li>Devin Carter: Father Anthony played 13 years in the NBA before becoming an assistant coach in the NBA.</li>
<li>Bub Carrington: No immediate family members had a basketball connection but Bub’s second cousin is 17-year NBA veteran Rudy Gay.</li>

      <label for="lf1w5bo" class="commentText"><p>This makes sense.</p>

<p>As somebody involved in youth basketball and have kids currently involved, a lot of it (beyond genetics) is knowing the right people. You have to have access to training, have to know the right people for coaching, and even that is the bare minimum stuff for people who are trying to play at a high level in highschool or low level colleges.</p>

<p>Takes a huge time commitment from parents, and the people have to have some level of support system around them supporting their basketball journey.</p>

<p>So much more money is involved in it than it was when I was growing up. If you don’t come from a basketball family, it’s a huge culture shock to get involved in it. Combine the natural genetics that come from being related to high level athletes with the fact that the culture of playing and training and traveling is already familiar, and that they already have the connections, and it makes plenty of sense.</p>

<p>Takes great genetics, the right connections, and a ton of luck and work ethic to make it on a high level. Helps when a couple of those things are taken care of naturally</p>

<p>But i do feel confident that with personal trainers and a strong mentor I would have been a hell of a lot better and probably even good enough to get a scholarship at some D2 schools. </p>

<p>I think that separates a lot of guys that had the genes but their family didn’t have the means to help them along in the process.</p>

Also lets say it was your uncle, its aways easy to talk to some one who has walked the same path you are attempting to walk, rather then having no one to share the same experience.
Mentor is a key role</p>

      <label for="lf29vaa" class="commentText"><p>Yeah the entire culture of youth basketball and commitment required of the families nowadays is tough to navigate for the average family. A kid has major advantages over his peers if he has a parent that hooped at a high level and understands the sacrifices necessary to get there.</p>

<p>His peers may not have the same level of support and guidance that keeps them on a favorable trajectory and there becomes a lot more luck involved in getting them there. Its definitely not just the genetics factor, there&rsquo;s plenty of &ldquo;regular people&rdquo; or failed hoopers out there that do have great genetics (6&rsquo;3+ and windmilling) but didn&rsquo;t have the right support system. Even as fathers themselves, they cant guide or provide for their kid in the same way a former pro or scholarship level player with no student debt can.</p>

<p>Tbh I would argue that the genetics are the least important part of the equation to become a future pro (overseas included), provided that the kid is 6&rsquo;ish barefoot which isnt freakishly tall.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That part. It is alarming how demanding some adults can be of these kids&rsquo; &ldquo;dedication&rdquo; to the game at such young ages. At the high school level, I get it because times winding down so to speak, but theres 10-12yr olds training like maniacs and playing 5 games every weekend. Its a bit much if you ask me, but thats what the youth landscape has turned into.</p>

<p>There shouldnt be the feeling that thats the &ldquo;bare minimum&rdquo; and your kid will fall behind if they go without those resources. I would love for America to institute some regulations on youth coaching primarily for the sake of educating coaches on how to develop these kids in a more healthy way, physically and mentally.</p>

<p>Honestly theres a lot of money literally wasted on playing AAU and training with some half-ass trainers. Having a basketball background in the family gives some discernment and keeps you from getting scammed basically or spending more wisely to develop as a player properly.</p>

<p>A lotta kids would be better off just going to the park or open gyms consistently than playing AAU, but the system&rsquo;s programmed everyone into thinking AAU&rsquo;s a necessity.</p>

      <label for="lf2oyil" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, for sure. The first is a little bit of a hot take, but remove long term expectations right now. Don’t start training with the hope that they are going to go pro or get a D1 scholarship. Start with goals that are much more short-term and ensure they always have a love for basketball.</p>

<p>From a skill perspective, the most important thing I can advise you to do is to turn your kid into a shooter. The best way you can do that is not let them to bomb threes right away. Develop proper shooting form on shorter hoops and at shorter distances and only let them shoot from further away as they get older/stronger. It’s a really hard thing to do. You (and your kid) are going to see other kids that are 7/8/9 years old that are bombing threes and making them consistently, but with really bad form. As they age, it becomes much harder to break those habits and those kids have shots that are too slow or can easily be blocked and they become unplayable.</p>

<p>Regardless of what people on here say, don’t worry about getting them into elite AAU programs or in with elite trainers before middle school. Take these formative years to make sure they can shoot, handle the ball, understand man-to-man defensive concepts and have a deep love and appreciation for the game.</p>

      <label for="lf30bac" class="commentText"><p>That’s the million dollar question. There’s tons and tons of videos and tutorials out there on YouTube.  <a href="https://youtu.be/t7ciq_x4138?si=_96Ksz-X6m9czmwn." target="_blank">This one is a quick run down of shooting fundamentals</a></p>

<p>The most important thing though is to build the jumpshot slowly and patiently. Moving too far from the basket too soon just reinforces bad shooting habits. From a post on Reddit about this:</p>

<p>“By far the best is form shooting up close. And the level of expertise you need to get to is being able to easily make those form shots in a 360-degree loop around the hoop, behind the backboard and all.</p>

<p>What you want to look for is the ball almost sliding down into the hoop. That means your rotation and/or arc is sufficient enough to make a soft landing for your shot.</p>

<p>Once you have mastered that, you have mastered your shot release. Now you can take that mastery and start to back up and add your full body into the shot, starting from your feet which power the shot and on through your new mastered form.”</p>

<p>Not all jumpshots are going to be textbook though. It matters most that a jumpshot has a decent amount of lift, a stable base that can be consistent through different gathers, no hitch in the gather or push, a quick straight motion, and a high release point.</p>

      <label for="lf2ldg7" class="commentText"><p>If you’re just starting out I’d recommend joining the local youth program, making sure the kid enjoys it, and it can branch out from there.</p>

<p>If they are already playing, You could probably find a local place that offers classes/camps for kids just looking online but There is a big range on this. I’ve found just talking to the parents of players who are excelling is a decent way to sort them. If there are three kids really standing out and they all take classes at the same place, it’s probably a decent place to get into. Once you find a good little spot doors kind of start to open as far as travel teams and stuff like that goes as they get a little bit older.</p>

      <label for="lf2l8rt" class="commentText"><p>The short answer is genetic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean" target="_blank">regression to the mean</a>.</p>

<p>The medium length answer asks us to imagine a simplified, two-factor model of athletic success, in which basketball skill is a function of A) genetic advantages (height, build, et cetera), and B) everything else (modelled behaviour, elite coaching,  etc&hellip;). The particulars of these two components don&rsquo;t matter a great deal, but we can say that for any given level of overall athletic ability (e.g. for a 99.9th percentile athlete in a sport) there are many different combinations of A &amp; B that can allow an athlete to reach that level.</p>

<p>Further, we can say that A is more important than B to athletic success in a given sport if a decrease in the amount of A must be compensated by a larger increase B to maintain the same level in overall athletic success.</p>

<p>Turning back to children of elite athletes, applying the above model to the conversation in this thread, these children are assumed to have, essentially, maximal B. The best coaching, direct access to a mentor who&rsquo;s done it, connections, training from a young age, etc. But, while the expected genetic gifts of this child are certainly much, much higher than the average person, their expected value is still closer to the average human than their parents.</p>

<p>Putting it all together, if the tradeoff between A &amp; B is steep enough then the importance of those B factors begin to fade and competition for limited NBA spots comes down to one question: are you in the 99.999th percentile of athletes in terms of combined height and athleticism. And while the children of elite athletes are probably over-represented in that group, they&rsquo;re significantly out numbered by the random, exceptional outliers produced by the other 8 billion humans on the planet.</p>

<p>And, while the above is extremely crude and ignores important extraneous factors (see below) it&rsquo;s empirically validated by the higher presence of father/son and uncle/nephew pairs in the NHL and MLB.</p>

<p>Other factors: I expect that the children of, say, boxers largely don&rsquo;t became boxers because it&rsquo;s a bad job and their parents discourage them from doing so; I think it&rsquo;s possible the same applies to certain NFL positions. Also, there&rsquo;s been a significant and largely detrimental cultural shift towards accepting, or at least tolerating, elite athletic training for young children which probably effects all the above, although I don&rsquo;t have a strong conviction as to how.</p>

<p>Since then, AAU costs and personal trainer fees make it much harder for poorer kids to make to the pinnacle. </p>

<p>I’d also add that the money pro athletes make went from really good in the 70s and 80s to some of the highest paying jobs on the planet starting in the 90s. A guy with a cup of coffee in the league in the 70s or 80s had to go work as an insurance broker after their career ended.</p>

<p>Pay is so high now, that a rookie contract provides generational wealth. You can then use that free time/money to pay for the best trainers, facilities, and travel teams.</p>

It’s significantly fewer now than it was in the 90s and 2000s and Dramatically smaller than it was in the 50s when league average height was 6’4. </p>

<p>I can’t link directly, but about a quarter of the way down is a chart indicating % of players under 6 feet tall. You can see that there was an uptick in the 90s and 2000s followed by a drop off. </p>

Players are measured by the teams and the teams don&rsquo;t have a uniform criteria. Some teams might measure players with their shoes on, while others might measure without them. Some teams might round up, while other might round down.</p>

<p>The only real uniform data comes from the Draft Combine, but before this year, big time college player barely even participated in it.</p>

      <label for="lf4ugx2" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s a factor of the game slowing down in the 90s and 00s. It was harder to exploit bad defenders when switching screens wasn&rsquo;t nearly as common and in 1 on 1 situations shorter guys are typically pretty good at going for steals on the dribble. Now that offenses are more complex and switching on defense is commonplace shorter players get put in actions more and are very rarely going 1 on 1 with anyone.</p>

<p>Isaiah Thomas was unbelievable on offense in the 4th; he had to be. If he wasn&rsquo;t King of the 4th, every 4th, he was a liability who gave up points at an alarming rate.</p>

      <label for="lf2p026" class="commentText"><p>Just from a mathematical standpoint, it makes sense. There are more people alive every year that played in the NBA. I&rsquo;m sure it grows very slowly, but there are more ex-NBA/pro athletes existing today than there were 20 years ago. Expansion of the NBA by a few teams. Growth of women&rsquo;s basketball. Growth of the international game since the 90s.</p>

<p>And as other comments have said, the &ldquo;poor kid who struck gold with sports&rdquo; has become way less common across all sports just due to how expensive youth sports is and the specialized training kids get. Basketball still probably has the lowest barrier to entry in terms of cost, and you can&rsquo;t buy height, but all things considered, someone with money is always going to have a leg up these days.</p>

Mental acuity is at least somewhat genetic.  Being around a coach gets you thinking that way and knowing what it takes to do the job.  Sure there have been some nepotistic flops but there have also been a lot of really good coach’s that are children of coaches.  Same for a lot of other professions.</p>

He didn&rsquo;t play until his sophomore year in high school, because he had focused on baseball and hockey until he outgrew them. He did get accepted into IMG&rsquo;s academy for his junior year based on his height alone, but played on their &ldquo;B&rdquo; team.  He was the ~#450 recruit when he went to Purdue.</p>

Maybe there was a 7 footer in Turkmenistan who could have manhandled Russell and Chamberlain, but simply had no access to Basketball, so he became a farmer.</p>

<p>Thats why I have only players in my all time ranking that played after Basketball Globalization (in my opinion it started in 1992).</p>

<p>Propably a controverse take, but I hope you understand what I am saying.</p>

<p>Nope!  Even though he was tall, Zach actually had no interest in basketball.  Zach&rsquo;s father Glen was a pro baseball player and that was Zach&rsquo;s interest growing up.  He only took up basketball when he &lsquo;outgrew&rsquo; baseball in high school.  That&rsquo;s when he decided to take up the sport his 6&rsquo;4 mom had played, basketball.  So he was very late into the development pipeline.</p>

We said with the genes of the nba unlike other sports, having height is by far the more important component for having a chance in the nba. So we all kinda agreed that in 20-30 years the nba would just be all the former nba stars kids running the league.  Obviously like this post says, relatives too, but I wouldn’t be shocked if this ends up being a major portion of the nba.</p>

Thinking do the NFL, say your dad was a lineman but you’re smaller so you become a linebacker. There’s tons of positions you could play and still benefit from your dad knowing the right people for the nfl track even at a different position. NBA doesn’t really seem to have that as much</p>

      <label for="lf2c562" class="commentText"><p>Same thing holds up in most fields.  In academia, I was surrounded by people whose parents had doctorate degrees.  My parents were a mechanic and a waitress.  I didn’t have connections, but got to where I was by working hard and out working everyone.</p>

<p>But a lot of people in those programs got there by working smarter.  They were setup for success, knew what questions to ask, what to focus on, which faculty to work with, etc.</p>

<p>I’m a public librarian now and I spent time with high schoolers sharing my advice when applying for scholarships and targeting what program to go to and giving them advice on what faculty to talk to once they’re there.</p>

<p>Same thing holds true in sports.  You have to know what coaches to go to, what summer programs to compete in, that leads to invites to special camps, endorsements, visits from college coaches, you know what program is best for your skill set, etc.</p>

      <label for="lf2fbxe" class="commentText"><p>Not surprised. The NBA is easily the major sport with the highest correlation with genetics due to the benefits that follow from height and with the worldwide popularity of the sport, pretty much anyone 6&rsquo;8 and above throughout the world born after 1992 has been scouted and approached by a basketball coach sometime in their lives so there&rsquo;s no more undiscovered tall people to bring in new family trees. Not to mention the developmental benefits that come along with having a professional athlete father/relative.</p>

<p>I just wonder if it&rsquo;s some level of nepotism like Bronny. Like say with Matt Barnes twins, I&rsquo;m sure any top AAU team, trainer, or coach would love to take them in just to say &ldquo;I have Matt Barnes kids on my team&rdquo; plus the publicity and attention of Matt Barnes attending games. Same with college, I&rsquo;m sure UCLA would gladly recruit them knowing former alum Matt Barnes would show up to games and help them sell more tix.</p>

      <label for="lf3dgdy" class="commentText"><p>Ah, the NBA Draft, where it seems like you either need a family tree that looks like a basketball hall of fame or be a genetic freak of nature to get a shot. I mean, 10 out of 14 lottery picks with pro or D1 connections? It’s like they’re drafting last names instead of players.</p>

<p>Ron Holland at 6&rsquo; 8&rdquo; and Zach Edey at 7&rsquo; 4&rdquo; have basically won the genetic lottery—good luck to anyone else trying to compete without an extra foot of height or a dad who dunked on the 90s. And shoutout to Rob Dillingham for being the only “normal” guy at 6’1” making it without a family resume that reads like an NBA trivia night cheat sheet. He’s like the “Rocky” of the draft, minus the soundtrack.</p>

<p>So, moral of the story: If you’re under 6 feet tall and your parents didn’t ball out, maybe keep the day job. Or grow a foot overnight. Whichever&rsquo;s easier.</p>

Would imagine similar stats say with those who are doctors, would say their parents or a close relative is also in the medical field too.  Smaller scale of course but we&rsquo;re seeing it more common in the NFL too with several active players being kids of a past players.</p>

      <label for="lf2zzck" class="commentText"><p>We&rsquo;ve seen this in hockey, where money and an early start are even more critical. Starting skating after 3 years old is considered late for NHL prospects (which isn&rsquo;t that weird, as skating is the equivalent of running - imagine a basketball player who didn&rsquo;t run before they played basketball). You need money to get ice time - former NHL goalie Carey Price&rsquo;s parents famously drove him for hours and hours across rural British Columbia to get on-ice practice time. That&rsquo;s not something poor families can afford to do.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the same reason the overwhelming majority of &ldquo;self-made&rdquo; business people come from at least fairly affluent backgrounds: only those families can provide the soft landing necessary to confidently pursue something with such a low probability of success.</p>

<p>This is why European football clubs set up their academy systems: they allow them to dip into the vast swathes of poor people who have talent, but lack the resources to securely develop those talents into skills. They&rsquo;re not doing it out the goodness of their hearts by any means, but it&rsquo;s probably still a more effective talent development methodology than our current one in most American Sports. In hockey, there is the USA Hockey National Team Development Program that has built quite the pipeline to the NHL (again, hockey has massive barriers to entry compared to pretty much any sport that doesn&rsquo;t use animals or machines).</p>

<p>To be fair, some of this is motivation. Maybe some family members aren&rsquo;t motivated to work. Not a shot, <strong>I</strong> straight up quit sports in high school despite having two spots haha.</p>

      <label for="lf4dgtx" class="commentText"><p>As far as Salaün and Williams are concerned, it doesnt really make sense to include siblings for the purposes of this post, since having a sibling a year or two older than you has nothing to do with the overall thesis of this post that the players with NBA dads had the advantage of NBA money, genetics and industry knowledge. Siblings dont have an impact on any of that stuff</p>

<p>you&rsquo;re basically just trying to inflate the numbers as high as possible so your thesis is more convincing by including siblings</p>

<p>Clinghan&rsquo;s mom playing at <em>maine</em> of all places is also a bit of a stretch too, even if it technically fits lol</p>

<p>Like I remember the third Gasol brother is like 10 years younger than Pau and ended up walking on at UCLA when Pau was there.  It&rsquo;s just &hellip; he showed no interest in basketball before that and it showed lol.  But point being, he only got a spot by being Pau&rsquo;s much younger brother.  Other guys, their sibling means nothing.</p>

<p>Or maybe not.  Thinking about UCLA again, all three Ball brothers were promised scholarships to get Lonzo to sign.</p>

<p>We are poor af and can barely afford basketballs (he goes through a lot cause outdoor court). Meanwhile his friend who doesn&rsquo;t practice much at all, got the chance to go to some basketball camp that has a bunch of professional trainers and MJ has even been known to stop by there from time to time.</p>
