      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1eyjyr0/an_all_time_team_of_small_forwards/"><p>An All Time team of Small Forwards</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Last week <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1erb13z/alltime_single_position_teams/" target="_blank">I made a post</a> asking &ldquo;How do you make an all-time starting 5 out of small forwards?&rdquo;, and here are my results based on the comments (team posted about halfway down). This team is not definitive; it is just the one I constructed</p>

<p>#The rules:</p>

<p>All 5 players historically played the same position (based on the strict majority of seasons listed on basketball reference, so MJ and Giannis don&rsquo;t count as SFs), and you have to attempt to make a complete team. This isn&rsquo;t just a top 5 SF post; there&rsquo;s gotta be a SF hypothetically played at point guard and center here. I didn&rsquo;t explicitly say it in the original post, but all 5 teams would play each other.</p>

<p>#Small Forward doing big things</p>

<p>This is the team that I think will be the best. SF typically combines size, skill, and shooting in a way that they could play bully ball on the guards and out shoot the bigs, without losing too much on the defensive ends against either. Wings like these are so valuable and versatile. Several of these guys have been the best of their era, so this team will be incredibly stacked. As stated above, the strategy for this team is just to be versatile. The ability to shoot, post up, defend, and run in transition are all going to be important. There are plenty of SFs that have been decent passers, but I&rsquo;m worried LeBron is probably the only one capable of true point guard duties because he fits well at center too (and every position).</p>

<p>Lebron James, KD, Larry Bird, Jamaal Wilkes, Scottie Pippen, Elgin Baylor, Paul George, Rick Barry, Dominique Wilkins, Andre Iguodala, Grant Hill, Paul Pierce, James Worthy, Dr. J, Ron Artest, Jimmy Butler, Bernard King, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Mullin, Kawhi, Jayson Tatum, John Havlicek, Paul Arizin, Alex English, Schrempf, Marion, Glen Rice, Marques Johnson, Mark Aguirre, Kiki Vandeweghe, DeBusschere, Billy Cunningham, Cedric Maxwell, Toni Kukoc&hellip;</p>

<p>There are a lot of guys that were either the /#1 or /#2 on their team, a defensive specialist, and a difference maker. There are 2 DPOYs, 4 MVPs, 9 FMVPs, a few 6MOTY, and a ton of All Star and All-NBA selections in this crowd. But I am only going to take 10 for this team</p>

<p>#The Team</p>

<p>PG - Lebron James
SG - Kevin Durant
SF - Scottie Pippen
PF - Larry Bird
C - Elgin Baylor</p>

<p>Bench: Rick Barry, Kawhi Leonard, James Worthy, Dominique Wilkins, Julius Erving</p>

<p>This really was a &ldquo;How do you choose?&rdquo; sort of team. Especially for older guys where I was less familiar with their games, but I know of them as greats of the game. Anyway&hellip; Lebron at PG is kind of an easy one. He&rsquo;s been listed at PG with the Lakers, and he even tallied 10 assists in the 2019-20 season. But if he got put at any other position, he would fit there too. KD at shooting guard. Easy choice. He&rsquo;s good at everything, and probably the guy you want on the perimeter the most. Lebron/KD pick and roll? Please. Scottie Pippen had to be in my starters. He is a true Swiss army knife, and he was capable of being the best on the team when needed. Plus, he&rsquo;s one of the best defenders of all time, so he would be locking down the other team&rsquo;s best player. Larry Bird at PF. Another all-time great. He can do it all, and he could be plugged in at any position without a worry. Elgin Baylor is at center mainly for his tenacious rebounding. He has a career boxscore of 27.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>13</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.3, so who cares that he&rsquo;s the smallest guy in this lineup? He had one season where he was actively enlisted and could only play on weekends; he recorded 38.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>18</sub>.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.6 as a 6&rsquo;5&rdquo; small forward. For a game against the 4s and 5s, maybe he would move to the 3 and Pippen and Bird would move up. The bench: another set of hard choices. On the bench, the only guys I was sure of were Barry, Erving, and Kawhi. The last two spots were total toss-ups that I couldn&rsquo;t be sure of. Nique was great even if he was never on a great team, and Worthy was great on a great team. But if anyone included PG, Grant Hill, Hondo, or Tatum, I would understand that too. Maybe some old heads are more familiar with DeBusschere and Vandeweghe than I am.</p>

<p>#Notable Omissions</p>

<p>I have kind of addressed this above. There are a ton of guys that could have been on this team. On the guard teams, there were guys who I included for being defensive specialists. This team doesn&rsquo;t need them. But also, maybe they could be good. This is a team that doesn&rsquo;t really need &ldquo;glue guys&rdquo; as most of these guys have played every role on the floor, defended each position, set screens, and rebound a lot.</p>

<p>Who would your team be?</p>

      <label for="ljdohjw" class="commentText"><p>Imo, SF is the position which is easiest to make a Positional Lineup.</p>

<p>Because traditionally,  SF is the most versatile position. SFs usually can play multiple positions like Lebron or KD.</p>

Since Basketball-Reference is the source, Lebron is listed at different positions in different years and may not qualify as SF for 2013, 18, or 20. This is all made up, so play the game you want</p>

<p>Feels like a no-brainer to me on the 5, just a matter of positions.</p>

<p>The combo of shooting/passing/defense here is absurd.</p>

<p>I like the Elgin callout for rebounding, i just don’t think it outweighs the shooting/defense of the other guys.</p>

      <label for="ljdreh1" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, Baylor felt thrown in a bit because I don&rsquo;t know much about him beyond his incredible rebounding and scoring numbers. Kawhi would slot in well, plus give absolutely suffocating defense between him and Pippen. KD would be a good 5 against the guard teams, but against the big teams, it would probably need to be Lebron or Kawhi just for the sake of strength. This team is just so versatile that you could really shuffle the positions randomly and not end up with a bad lineup.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be smaller in rim protection and dirty work anyway. But Kawhi and Pippen at POA are ideal to compensate for the foot speed of SFs. And they can switch onto the bigs in pnr so they&rsquo;ll spend time down low anyway.</p>

<p>C: Tim Duncan
PF: Dirk Nowitzki
SF: Draymond Green
SG: Giannis Antetokounmpo
PG: Charles Barkley</p>

<p>Biggest problem with PF and C positions is ball handling, passing, 3pts shooting and perimeter defense.</p>

<p>Barkley and Giannis is probably the best ballhandlers and facilitators. They also both have a better chance to defend the other teams guards. It’s a little bit cheating to put Duncan at center, but i do it anyway.</p>

<p>The difficult positions is PF and SF. I have Dirk for his 3pt shooting, because otherwise there is very little 3pt shooting on the team. The SF position is between Garnett and Draymond Green. I actually think peak Draymond would be a better fit because we already have 4 other superstars so he would be the glue on this team. I think his 3pt shooting and passing ability is needed.</p>

<p>Garnett and Malone gets snubbed. You can maybe put Garnett in instead of Draymond, but i honestly don’t think it would be a good idea because of the lack of shooting and facilitating.</p>

<p>Thinking about it you might actually be better off putting someone like Siakam in or another one who can play 3 and D. The team badly needs 3pt shooting.</p>

      <label for="ljedx0f" class="commentText"><p>Yep, the bigs are hard to find a PG for. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Jokic, the center team would be really tough to have an offensive initiator. For the PFs, Blake Griffin could be someone who actually did do a little bit of ball handling, passing, and shooting after he stopped playing with CP3. There are a lot of guys who are good connective passers or good at kicking out after attacking the basket with very few true table setters. Draymond is actually one of the better ones here as well, and peak Dray was a good shooter on top of it. You could go for a shooting specialist if you wanted. Matt Bonner doesn&rsquo;t fit in with the &ldquo;all time great&rdquo; theme, but he also shot &amp;gt;40% on almost 4 attempts for several years. JJJ is another really good floor spacer too. Kevin Love or Chris Bosh also played the role of stretch <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> on championship teams.</p>

<p>I liked the idea of these posts because it is fun to think about fit for a group of all time greats. When I have made these teams, I have sacrificed overall talent to try to find guys who would hypothetically complement each other&rsquo;s strengths.</p>

<p>Optimal lineup for me would be:</p>

<p>PG - Grant hill - legit lebron lite before his ankle injury</p>

<p>SG - Kawhi - toronto Kawhi was better than KD, imo</p>

<p>SF - Pippen - ultimate non-lebron swiss army knife</p>

<p>PF - Lebron - probably the strongest of all these guys</p>

<p>C - Bird - my favorite player growing up, but on a team like this he&rsquo;s the slowest and least athletic by far, but also big and bulky enough to cause problems for opposing centers</p>

      <label for="ljfo2q6" class="commentText"><p>Fun topic and fun post. </p>

<p>My Team:</p>

<p>PG - Grant Hill</p>

<p>I believe he played point guard in college, and was an excellent passer and fast enough for the role. Now he wasn&rsquo;t a good three-point shooter, not that it was a big issue during his days, but he isn&rsquo;t Ben Simmons and everybody else will be hot from three so I&rsquo;m cool with it. Somehow both &ldquo;The Next Michael Jordan&rdquo; and &ldquo;LeBron James before LeBron James&rdquo;, I think he&rsquo;ll do fine. </p>

<p>SG - Kawhi Leonard </p>

<p>KD as shooting guard sounds pretty awesome, but due to his size I&rsquo;d want him in a role more traditionally close to the rim. Kawhi is the guy I want patroling for steals and taking shots. They say he&rsquo;s the closest thing we have to MJ in the modern game, and his massive hands and cyborg-esque automatic shooting doesn&rsquo;t inspire much disagreement from me. </p>

<p>SF - Larry Bird </p>

<p>Another spot I&rsquo;d like KD for, but Bird has the better passing game, which I think lends better to being the swingman on a team of swingmen. Bird could do it all. Shoot from anywhere, pass great, incredible rebounding, good defense, and he even won a tip-off against Dream once. That&rsquo;s the deep versatility I want at SF. </p>

<p>PF - Kevin Durant</p>

<p>As great as KD is at the perimeter, 6 foot 11 is 6 foot 11. I want him to operate closer to the rim and in the midrange, where I believe he attempted the most shots from last year, and use that length to protect the rim and rebound. I&rsquo;ve seen KD prove impactful in this role when forced into it by wing-dense line-ups, so he&rsquo;ll do just fine. </p>

<p>C - LeBron James </p>

<p>He led the league in assists once, so ideally he&rsquo;d fit in best at PG, but I can&rsquo;t think of another SF that has a better overall build for center. He&rsquo;s a little undersized at 6 foot 9, but the man is build like an action figure and has the muscle and mobility to work himself to that rim again and again, and hold his own keeping bodies away from it. </p>

<p>Bench: </p>

<p>PG - Jimmy Butler (all-around efficent defensive star who&rsquo;s averaged 5.7 assists in Miami, and shot .41 from three on 2.5 attempts last year)</p>

<p>SG - Rick Barry (great shooter and scorer, led the league in steals in 1975)</p>

<p>SF - John Havlicek (had two 27/7/7 seasons, our sixth man swingman that&rsquo;ll do it all and fill in any role, will run the second unit offense)</p>

<p>PF - Scottie Pippen (all-time defensive player, need to have him)</p>

<p>C - James Worthy (6 foot 9 with a strong build, came in clutch in Big Games, he will do)</p>

<p>Honorable mention to Dr. J, the 3rd best SF ever </p>

<p>The only team they will have massive trouble defending are the centers in the post, and even they can be beaten by focusing on picking perimeter handles and entry passes. Plus, you can put Simmons in as a dedicated defender and dunker while loading the other positions up with all-time shooters and ball handlers drawing double and triple teams.</p>

      <label for="ljg9qwq" class="commentText"><p>I would throw Kawhi at the 2 and KD at the 3. KD still abuses SFs with his high release point, but he also has a better time defending SFs, and he has a better speed advantage while maintaining his height advantage, compared to playing vs. SGs.</p>

<p>Kawhi can still guard 2s at an elite level, but the strength mismatch is huge for him. He routinely bullies SFs, but it&rsquo;s even worse against SGs</p>
