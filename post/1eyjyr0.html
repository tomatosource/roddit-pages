</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Last week <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1erb13z/alltime_single_position_teams/" target="_blank">I made a post</a> asking &ldquo;How do you make an all-time starting 5 out of small forwards?&rdquo;, and here are my results based on the comments (team posted about halfway down). This team is not definitive; it is just the one I constructed</p>

<p>#The rules:</p>

<p>All 5 players historically played the same position (based on the strict majority of seasons listed on basketball reference, so MJ and Giannis don&rsquo;t count as SFs), and you have to attempt to make a complete team. This isn&rsquo;t just a top 5 SF post; there&rsquo;s gotta be a SF hypothetically played at point guard and center here. I didn&rsquo;t explicitly say it in the original post, but all 5 teams would play each other.</p>

<p>#Small Forward doing big things</p>

<p>This is the team that I think will be the best. SF typically combines size, skill, and shooting in a way that they could play bully ball on the guards and out shoot the bigs, without losing too much on the defensive ends against either. Wings like these are so valuable and versatile. Several of these guys have been the best of their era, so this team will be incredibly stacked. As stated above, the strategy for this team is just to be versatile. The ability to shoot, post up, defend, and run in transition are all going to be important. There are plenty of SFs that have been decent passers, but I&rsquo;m worried LeBron is probably the only one capable of true point guard duties because he fits well at center too (and every position).</p>

<p>Lebron James, KD, Larry Bird, Jamaal Wilkes, Scottie Pippen, Elgin Baylor, Paul George, Rick Barry, Dominique Wilkins, Andre Iguodala, Grant Hill, Paul Pierce, James Worthy, Dr. J, Ron Artest, Jimmy Butler, Bernard King, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Mullin, Kawhi, Jayson Tatum, John Havlicek, Paul Arizin, Alex English, Schrempf, Marion, Glen Rice, Marques Johnson, Mark Aguirre, Kiki Vandeweghe, DeBusschere, Billy Cunningham, Cedric Maxwell, Toni Kukoc&hellip;</p>

<p>There are a lot of guys that were either the /#1 or /#2 on their team, a defensive specialist, and a difference maker. There are 2 DPOYs, 4 MVPs, 9 FMVPs, a few 6MOTY, and a ton of All Star and All-NBA selections in this crowd. But I am only going to take 10 for this team</p>

<p>#The Team</p>

<p>PG - Lebron James
SG - Kevin Durant
SF - Scottie Pippen
PF - Larry Bird
C - Elgin Baylor</p>

<p>Bench: Rick Barry, Kawhi Leonard, James Worthy, Dominique Wilkins, Julius Erving</p>

<p>This really was a &ldquo;How do you choose?&rdquo; sort of team. Especially for older guys where I was less familiar with their games, but I know of them as greats of the game. Anyway&hellip; Lebron at PG is kind of an easy one. He&rsquo;s been listed at PG with the Lakers, and he even tallied 10 assists in the 2019-20 season. But if he got put at any other position, he would fit there too. KD at shooting guard. Easy choice. He&rsquo;s good at everything, and probably the guy you want on the perimeter the most. Lebron/KD pick and roll? Please. Scottie Pippen had to be in my starters. He is a true Swiss army knife, and he was capable of being the best on the team when needed. Plus, he&rsquo;s one of the best defenders of all time, so he would be locking down the other team&rsquo;s best player. Larry Bird at PF. Another all-time great. He can do it all, and he could be plugged in at any position without a worry. Elgin Baylor is at center mainly for his tenacious rebounding. He has a career boxscore of 27.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>13</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.3, so who cares that he&rsquo;s the smallest guy in this lineup? He had one season where he was actively enlisted and could only play on weekends; he recorded 38.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>18</sub>.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.6 as a 6&rsquo;5&rdquo; small forward. For a game against the 4s and 5s, maybe he would move to the 3 and Pippen and Bird would move up. The bench: another set of hard choices. On the bench, the only guys I was sure of were Barry, Erving, and Kawhi. The last two spots were total toss-ups that I couldn&rsquo;t be sure of. Nique was great even if he was never on a great team, and Worthy was great on a great team. But if anyone included PG, Grant Hill, Hondo, or Tatum, I would understand that too. Maybe some old heads are more familiar with DeBusschere and Vandeweghe than I am.</p>

<p>#Notable Omissions</p>

<p>I have kind of addressed this above. There are a ton of guys that could have been on this team. On the guard teams, there were guys who I included for being defensive specialists. This team doesn&rsquo;t need them. But also, maybe they could be good. This is a team that doesn&rsquo;t really need &ldquo;glue guys&rdquo; as most of these guys have played every role on the floor, defended each position, set screens, and rebound a lot.</p>

<p>Who would your team be?</p>

      <label for="ljdohjw" class="commentText"><p>Imo, SF is the position which is easiest to make a Positional Lineup.</p>

<p>Because traditionally,  SF is the most versatile position. SFs usually can play multiple positions like Lebron or KD.</p>

2 Kawhi ‘17
3 Bird ‘86
4 Scottie ‘91
5 KD ‘21</p>

<p>Feels like a no-brainer to me on the 5, just a matter of positions.</p>

<p>The combo of shooting/passing/defense here is absurd.</p>

<p>I like the Elgin callout for rebounding, i just don’t think it outweighs the shooting/defense of the other guys.</p>

      <label for="ljdreh1" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, Baylor felt thrown in a bit because I don&rsquo;t know much about him beyond his incredible rebounding and scoring numbers. Kawhi would slot in well, plus give absolutely suffocating defense between him and Pippen. KD would be a good 5 against the guard teams, but against the big teams, it would probably need to be Lebron or Kawhi just for the sake of strength. This team is just so versatile that you could really shuffle the positions randomly and not end up with a bad lineup.</p>
