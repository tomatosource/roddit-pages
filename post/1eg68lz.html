<blockquote>
<p>But Bridgeman understood her point. Salaries for players then weren’t that high by today’s standards. In Bridgeman’s 12-season career, which included a stint with the LA Clippers, he made about <span class="math inline">\(2.95 million and never more than \)</span>350,000 in a season.</p>

<p>After his career, he built a fast-food empire that, at its peak, totaled more than 450 restaurants nationwide. He became a Coca-Cola bottling distributor with territory across three states and into Canada. He bought Ebony and Jet magazines. His estimated net worth soared to nearly $600 million, behind just Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and LeBron James, among NBA players.</p>

<p>Very impressive though, considering how many NBA players blow through money</p>

      <label for="lfqkbdn" class="commentText"><p>And every single person alive understands that you can make a lot of money franchising one. 40 years ago it wasn’t common knowledge that you can make a lot of money franchising fast food. If you did research and studied, yes you’d understand that.</p>

<p>The average person today has more knowledge and information at their fingertips than any other point in human history. That’s why our economy is evolving  the way it is, it’s become too overexposed. Everyone knows how to make money now, so all of the avenues of revenue generation are getting exploited. It’s not just McDonalds franchising, it is every single long term revenue source (over valuation of stocks, real estate, personal loans and even cars). Every revenue source is being exploited and pushed to its limit because we all know about it. Wasn’t common knowledge 40 years ago, so it was easier to break into with the knowledge of today.</p>

<p>Genuinely asking, did you come up with that, or do you have a source for that?
Cuz to my knowledge the fast food market only became more competitive in the past 4 decades and McDonalds was pringting money in the 80s already and started expanding internationally in the late 70s. Plus it was pretty common for athletes and showbuz ppl to invest into restaurants back then.</p>

<p>Edit—you deleted your comment, but here was my response:</p>

<p>The way you phrased it makes it sound like his money grew solely because he was already wealthy.</p>

<p>Also, money doesn’t 10x in 40 years, lmao. 3m in 1985 is 9m today not 29m like you erroneously pointed out. That’s a very important difference:</p>

<p>Bridgeman being just a role player in the 70s managed to grow his wealth more than many today players are just impressive</p>

      <label for="lfrfhi1" class="commentText"><p>I’d probably agree. He wasn’t supplementing his income with brand deals and couldn’t leverage being Shaq, MJ, or Magic as a part of his negotiations. Mother fucker just had to be himself and own the right deals. And the $600m figure suggests he did just that.</p>
