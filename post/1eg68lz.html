<blockquote>
<p>But Bridgeman understood her point. Salaries for players then weren’t that high by today’s standards. In Bridgeman’s 12-season career, which included a stint with the LA Clippers, he made about <span class="math inline">\(2.95 million and never more than \)</span>350,000 in a season.</p>

<p>After his career, he built a fast-food empire that, at its peak, totaled more than 450 restaurants nationwide. He became a Coca-Cola bottling distributor with territory across three states and into Canada. He bought Ebony and Jet magazines. His estimated net worth soared to nearly $600 million, behind just Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and LeBron James, among NBA players.</p>

<p>Very impressive though, considering how many NBA players blow through money</p>

If you did research and studied, yes you’d understand that.</p>

<p>The average person today has more knowledge and information at their fingertips than any other point in human history. That’s why our economy is evolving  the way it is, it’s become too overexposed. Everyone knows how to make money now, so all of the avenues of revenue generation are getting exploited. It’s not just McDonalds franchising, it is every single long term revenue source (over valuation of stocks, real estate, personal loans and even cars). Every revenue source is being exploited and pushed to its limit because we all know about it. Wasn’t common knowledge 40 years ago, so it was easier to break into with the knowledge of today.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Genuinely asking, did you come up with that, or do you have a source for that?
Cuz to my knowledge the fast food market only became more competitive in the past 4 decades and McDonalds was pringting money in the 80s already and started expanding internationally in the late 70s. Plus it was pretty common for athletes and showbuz ppl to invest into restaurants back then.</p>

<p>Also, even with the much lower barriers to entry in the 80&rsquo;s for things like McDonalds or any franchise a lot of people did not have that much saved up in the bank nor were willing to take out a loan at 12-15% interest (prime was still insane in the mid 80&rsquo;s) against their house to bet on themselves. The country had just come out of a pretty nasty recession/inflation cycle in the late 70&rsquo;s/early 80&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s probably easier now for entrepreneurs and wannabe entrepreneurs to get going from an information gathering/marketing research standpoint because of how much info is available for free or near free. Startup costs in a lot of industries, however, are way higher (beyond inflation impacts over time).</p>

<p>I know, I was alive in 1984 &amp; when I skipped school, I went to a library to acquire &ldquo;common knowledge&rdquo; in the 90s. ;)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m genuinely curious, if fast food restaurants were seen as a &ldquo;good investment&rdquo; back then, cuz I work in the food industry and I was under the impression, that many ppl thought that.</p>

<p>The way you phrased it makes it sound like his money grew solely because he was already wealthy.</p>

<p>Also, money doesn’t 10x in 40 years, lmao. 3m in 1985 is 9m today not 29m like you erroneously pointed out. That’s a very important difference:</p>

I order to 10x his money over that period he would only have to achieve a modest return of 5.8%.</p>

<p>He’s still doubled the return of the S&amp;P which is impressive but your $9M number is laughably off and using an inflation adjusted number makes absolutely no sense in this context.</p>

      <label for="lfsberz" class="commentText"><p>Are you [redacted]? Even using your own calculator gets us to $227m. Can you really not input numbers into the shit you link yourself? Further, in what universe is it realistic to take all of the money he’s ever earned and to invest every dollar of it and all dividends into the stock market?</p>

<p>Using an inflation adjusted value is literally what the other person tried to do. You don’t even have his comment to work off of and are coming in here being a snarky tw**. You literally don’t even know what he said.</p>

<p>TL ; DR: learn to input numbers into a calculator, and realize you need to live off of money too and can’t just put every dollar into the stock market. Durrrrr</p>

<p>A lot of athletes are just idiots or have zero financial literacy.</p>

<p>They might not have done it as well as he would have, but a lot of money would be made on safe/simple investments at that salary.</p>

<p>And that assumes you live on $0/year. Like you&rsquo;re just gonna be homeless so that your million dollars can sit in a mutual fund.</p>
