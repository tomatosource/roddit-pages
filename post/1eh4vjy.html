      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1eh4vjy/the_cleveland_cavaliers_won_48_games_in_202324_4/"><p>The Cleveland Cavaliers won 48 games in <sup>2023</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub>. 4 of their top 6 players in their rotation missed at least 14 games. Are they a sleeper for <sup>2024</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub>?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Donovan Mitchell=55 games.</p>

<p>Darius Garland=57 games.</p>

<p>Evan Mobley=50 games.</p>

<p>Caris Levert=68 games.</p>

<p>Strus also missed 12 and played through injury. Allen was their one guy who played through the season&hellip;then he went down and missed the playoffs.</p>

<p>Not a single starter made it the season unscathed. They still won 48 and won a playoff series. Is this team a darkhorse threat in the Eastern Conference? Nobody is treating them like they&rsquo;re a contender, but the way I see it, only Boston and Philly are clearly ahead of them on paper as a team.</p>

<p>Depth is a question mark, but surely their health fortunes won&rsquo;t be that poor again? Atkinson is likely an offensive upgrade as coach for a team that was 18th on offense last season. And Donovan has clearly taken his game to another level in Cleveland. What do you all think?</p>

      <label for="lfwy0mu" class="commentText"><p>I don’t want to look to much into the fit with Mobley and Allen for now, cause I think Mobley has potential to develop into something that the fit won’t be too concerning, but I don’t think there’s much to say. It’s a good team who’s chances will be dependent on how good Garland and Mobley become, I’m big on both of them but Garland had a minor regression and Mobley hasn’t really improved like I thought he would, I thought he’d be a fringe all star by now. Nobody in their core is gonna be washed anytime soon, so I guess there’s time, but at this point with their cap situation and everything they just have to bank on internal development. Do they have what it takes to beat the Celtics? I personally don’t think so.</p>

      <label for="lfwznop" class="commentText"><p>Boston aside, I think they have a punchers chance in a series against anyone else in the East. Mitchell can be the best guy in any series. We saw Garland have some big games against New York last playoffs.  Allen was dominating Orlando before getting hurt, Mobley was very good against Boston. Strus and Levert are quality players. Wade is really good when healthy. Then you have 3 to 6 specialists and young players that you can go to. Okoro (possibly), Merrill, Naing, Tyson and CpJ. You probably need to add another center.</p>

<p>They limped in to the playoffs. The team seemed to lose faith in JB. Mitchell was coming back from a bone bruise and wasn’t close to right until later in the Orlando series and the  strained his calf against Boston. DG was a mess. Allen played 4 games before the rib. Mobley had a knee procedure mid season. Strus was beat up. Wade didn’t play until the Boston series and missed extensive time.</p>

<p>A new offense should help and Atkinson is definitely going to be better at that than JB and that has been much more the issue for the Cavs than the defense in the playoffs.</p>

<p>There’s also a lot of room for internal growth with Mobley, Garland and Okoro really finally getting close with the jumper.  They’ve all gotten a real taste of the playoffs and continuity isn’t a bad thing.</p>

<p>A top four seed? I could see it.</p>

<p>A threat to come out of the East? No.</p>

<p>The issue is that their top four players are redundant and flawed archetypes. How good is a team when your best four guys are two small offense-first guards that can&rsquo;t defend and two big men who can defend but can&rsquo;t shoot (or really rebound)?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like they went all in on the Lillard/McCollum Blazers</p>

      <label for="lfwyo28" class="commentText"><p>Not unless Garland shows up in the playoffs. Dude scored only 15 ppg on 52% true shooting and 14 shots. I&rsquo;m willing to give him the benefit of the doubt because he kept getting bumped off his spots due to him losing weight because of the jaw injury, but that can&rsquo;t happen again, especially when he passed up open looks from 3. He also still hasn&rsquo;t developed an off ball game, unlike Mitchell who did have some off ball plays ran for him. Also the 4th quarter turnovers gotta stop.</p>

<p>Still, the main problem is the spacing. Notice how when Allen was out of the lineup in the playoffs, Donovan Mitchell had better games because he had more space to operate( with the exception of game 5 against the magic where he still struggled). Games 3 and 4, the Magic did a good job keeping Mitchell out of the restricted area because they finally learned to clog up the lanes.</p>

<p>Mobley has to be a better 3pt shooter and overall expand his offensive game. The one thing I&rsquo;ll criticize JB for is that he kept trying to get Mobley to play his back up against the basket when he isn&rsquo;t a great post player due to his lack of strength. He plays better when he can face up for a mid range or drive to the rim.</p>

      <label for="lfxdt03" class="commentText"><p>In the 22-23 season with all 4 of Garland/Mitchell/Mobley/Allen on the court the Cavs outscored opponents by 8.9 points per 100 possessions. Last season, it dropped to +2.6. They actually had some of their best stretches when 1-2 of their core players were out. So I don&rsquo;t think just getting better health will automatically give them a big boost, they need to get their starting lineup back to an elite level when it&rsquo;s available.</p>

<p>Having Garland/Mitchell and Mobley/Allen gives them a lot of structural redundancy and a really solid floor, but there is some clunkiness in the fit that Atkinson will have to work out. Garland not having to eat through a straw for a month should help though</p>

      <label for="lfxe327" class="commentText"><p>considering they actually played better when 1-2 of their core was out because they were such a bad fit together, I&rsquo;m gonna say no. I think if they were serious about contending this year they&rsquo;d trade Allen. I can forgive them for wanting to give garland a longer leash to see if he can make it work with mitchell, but Allen just isn&rsquo;t good enough to play a promising young player out of position and fuck with his development. If they do that Allen for BI swap that was rumored before then maybe they&rsquo;d be more of a threat.</p>

<p>But yeah Garland was a shell of himself after returning last year. Allen missed crucial time. They have 4 key stars and a strong bench, they have some pieces.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s going to be about Mobley stepping up in to a bigger role and Atkinson delivering as coach, especially the challenge of making sense of those 4 on the court together.</p>

      <label for="lfxkhqe" class="commentText"><p>IIRC they were actually better when one of their guards or bigs was out. Mitchell/Garland and Mobely/Allen are just really redundant together, so I&rsquo;m not sure if them being fully healthy is as much a boon to them as it would be to other teams.</p>
