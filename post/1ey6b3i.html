</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>It wasn&rsquo;t an easy first season for Beal with the Suns due to injuries that saw him play only 53 games. Injuries have become a very common theme for Beal over the last several seasons and won&rsquo;t be less of a potential concern now that he&rsquo;s on the wrong side of 30. He has had back/lower body injuries over the last several seasons.</p>

<p>He was certainly good once he was able to get a good stretch of games in&hellip;shot an outlier 69% from 3 in April but was over 40% after the All Star break overall and for the season. Really efficient, learning his teammates tendencies and gaining comfort in the offensive system and more effective as a playmaker. Was OK on offense in the playoffs too, but his defense was another story and can&rsquo;t be ignored when it comes to his value to the Suns and overall. Still, if he can remain healthy this season, he&rsquo;s a very good third option offensively for Phoenix. He could benefit from less playmaking and more off ball scoring with Tyus Jones in the starting lineup.</p>

<p>What are your expectations for Beal this season?</p>

<p>I lurked in their subreddit a bit when the Suns were eliminated last season and the one guy none of them were mad at seemed to be Beal. He did his job, put his heart in it and balled out to whatever extent he could but had the clamps on him because of their roster construction.
It&rsquo;s too bad they can&rsquo;t trade him, he has a lot of value, he just can&rsquo;t reach his potential at all beside KD and Booker.</p>

<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t really know what to expect from him this season, it&rsquo;s hard to tell. Maybe he&rsquo;d be a lot more effective in the Ginobili role coming off the bench?</p>

      <label for="ljb2bfb" class="commentText"><p>Suns fan here. Trading for him made sense only in that it was an all in move and that it was justified by not wanting to lose Chris Paul for nothing. A move I would have done every time even if the fit is not great.</p>

<p>Beal will likely never be anywhere what he was in Washington but given his willingness so far to do other things he is well liked by the fan base. I just hope he can be a high end third option that can run some bench units while KD and Book sit, and of course stay healthy.</p>

<p>He is not going anywhere so may as well do our best to maximize what he can do. Hopefully Budenholzer can figure that out.</p>

      <label for="ljc53k8" class="commentText"><p>That bad elimination game (and it was awful) has really made Beal underrated. His contract is putrid of course but people here are often way off about the type of player he is. I guess from the outside, seeing us get swept R1 reinforces that he&rsquo;s a &ldquo;losing player&rdquo; which some people label him as.</p>

<p>Granted I couldn&rsquo;t have really said for sure if he was when he was a Wizard, but I think that is dead wrong after watching every Suns game this season.</p>

<p>Beal is a guy who will stand in and take a charge that breaks his nose, then if his protective facemask is bothering him he&rsquo;ll just throw it aside and still drive into the paint with a broken nose and no fear. He got swatted in his broken nose and after writhing on the ground in obvious pain he was back out there giving it 100% still with no mask in some random ass regular season game.</p>

<p>And he performed well, too. Some growing pains for the team obviously, but he averaged 18 points this season not because his days of being able to put up big scoring numbers are behind him, but because more than anyone else he was the guy willing to sacrifice his game and counting stats for the betterment of the team. He was our swiss army knife on both ends. And of course he&rsquo;ll still go off for 30+ here and there and make it look easy.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s fair to doubt his health and the Suns as a whole, but I&rsquo;m not worried about Beal&rsquo;s performance when he&rsquo;s out there. Dude is a baller.</p>
