      <p>Hello everyone. I posted TB&rsquo;s list a couple of days ago and this sub heavily disagreed with it. So I decided to create a p0ll where we as a community can vote on the same list. You can <a href="https://all-our-ideas.citizens.is/group/593" target="_blank">vote here</a>. I will post the results as it&rsquo;s own list in 24 hours. Let&rsquo;s see how we do compared to the TB guys!</p>

<p>Harden played 15 playoff series in Houston alone and never averaged less than 25.</p>

<p>When harden was the age Luka will be this year he led the league in win shares and vorp while narrowly coming in second in mvp while winning the players mvp.</p>

<p>Luka has not shown he’s better than him yet</p>

      <label for="liuroat" class="commentText"><p>It might help if you actually take the time to learn instead of letting bill Simmons work your mouth like a puppet. By any actual fact or metric harden is one of the greatest playoff performers of all time, and one of the greatest clutch performers of all time.</p>

<p>In the last 25 years he’s 10th in eFG% (so not even counting free throws) on clutch playoff points, ahead of kd and way ahead of guys like dirk and Kobe.</p>

<p>In the last 15 years he has the fourth most clutch playoff points behind only steph, lebron, and butler, and he’s more efficient on them than guys like Lebron, kd, and jokic.</p>

<p>He has better elimination games numbers than Kobe.</p>

<p>I’m honestly curious like where you get this from to be so confident in it when it’s so far removed from reality. Like have you just heard a bunch of people on this sub say it and just go full for it? I feel like part of it is harden is the only player on earth, where any discussion on him in the playoffs you’ll notice is solely about individual bad games he’s had (which literally every star has had), there will never be an overall fact or metric mentioned, because that would instantly show how ridiculous it is. And he’s the only player where whenever he does well they just constantly move the goalposts. Like oh nice you had your 11th 40 point playoffs game against one of the best rosters in the league when we told you you were here to be the second option to the mvp. But it wasn’t a game 7 to eliminate the greatest roster ever so it doesn’t really count and we’ll just say you personally choked the entire series.</p>

<p>Like I feel like people give dame playoff props for having a big game or two in a first round loss. He’s not good enough to ever have a chance to choke. Where with harden he could get through the early rounds so easily no one cared and then he would finally lose to a team with like 4 players that would start on the shitty roster he carried there and it was basically like “oh which vastly superior 60+ win roster did you finally lose to this year you choking piece of shit.”</p>

<p>The one other thing which I won’t really get into because you guys are in way too deep and will like personally attack me, is peak harden was a really solid defender. This one I never got because this sub talks about him like he’s been rookie trae young his entire career traffic cone level, which never made sense to me especially watching full games but also the fact that he was like a quick 6’5 linebacker playing pg that was strong as shit. Someone like that would have to put actual effort into being that big of a traffic cone. But the other day someone was saying the same old bs so i actually spent like 30 mins gathering all this info, making sure it was all legit and trying to present it in the most non biased way possible, i put some work into it and was kind of excited because i thought someone would be interested to learn something about basketball on a basketball sub. Which was my critical mistake. But I started off like yeah so harden was a bad defender originally, so is like every star. And then I went year by year showing was percentile he was in and the ppp he gave up on average on each type of defensive play. I was happy honestly, it was a good comment.</p>

<p>Like 30 seconds after I posted I just got a response saying lmao not reading that. So basically like he was so invested in harden being a traffic cone his entire career as soon as he saw it was a long comment with a lot of info that would show him otherwise he flipped out and refused to read anything more basketball related I said and just started being a huge dick to me. Like it was such an integral part of his identity that harden was the worst defender to ever live he literally could not handle it. It was fucking creepy.</p>

<p>So I’ll correct comments like yours that are for a lack of a better term “wrong” about his playoff stuff and people are actually getting more receptive. It’s also easier because if you look at it for 30 seconds it’s impossible to still believe that bs about him being bad in the playoffs just because it’s so obviously wrong.</p>

<p>The defense bs I just let go because you guys are in like way to deep or something it’s like a cult and will short circuit your brain and you’ll personally attack me because it’s like such an important part of your lives that harden was always the worst defender to ever live. It’s a little bit cultish and I don’t get it but it’s better than getting a stream of furious messages that refuse to read any basketball related info I put in.</p>

<p>I will say it does impress and slightly worry me how you guys are able to talk about things with like this supreme confidence without giving a flying fuck to check if it’s actually true or not first lol</p>

There’s literally zero argument for Luka over harden right now. Even with all the scoring inflation Luka still hasn’t touched hardens level, obviously as a scorer, but also as a floor general</p>

<p>Edit: if someone can make a logical argument that Luka is above the level of prime harden I will give you a million dollars. I don’t have a million dollars but it’s ok because one doesn’t exist</p>

Harden vs Luka is like the ultimate flirting vs harassment meme, except at this point harden is still the rich good looking guy compared to Luka. We were all just basically told to hate him by the media ten plus years ago now so 90% of fans did, and now it’s been so long it’s like a religion for most people. Then with Luka the media has been dying to give him an mvp since his rookie year.</p>

<p>Jokic is the best offensive player i have ever seen, but i can listen to arguments for Steph if people want to make them. LeBron in his peak was a better player than both, but that mostly came down to the fact that he on top of being a legendary offensive player, also was a ridiculously great defender.</p>

Jordan: 18

      <label for="liukpmu" class="commentText"><p>I get asking the same question a couple times to make sure who you’re voting for is who you really think is best. The hardest one for me was kd or doncic. Because kd was like the original automatic bucket, but then you have to take into account scoring inflation for Luka, plus the massive impact on offense players like him or harden or cp3 have beyond just scoring.</p>

<p>I think I legit got kd or kawhi at least like 30 times though, and I don’t get why because I put the same answer every time.</p>

      <label for="liufu8j" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s super uncontroversial. Jokic has an argument to be the best offensive player ever. Or at least top 3.</p>

<p>KD doesn&rsquo;t sniff that. His playmaking is nowhere near good enough.</p>

      <label for="liuk77z" class="commentText"><p>What exactly does peak mean here? Is it their best season. Because then it has to be Jokic for 22, harden for 19, Steph for 16, then everyone else.</p>

<p>Is it a stretch of a couple seasons of their peak? Because then it has to be harden, Jokic, then steph maybe Lebron then everyone else.</p>

<p>I realize you guys will probably take the poll down if there’s any chance of harden winning, but dude was top 3 in mvp voting 5 out of six years. He was all nba 7 times in 8 seasons with six being first team, and the one year he didn’t make it he averaged 29/6/8, objectively deserved to make it but the voters were just like hey fuck you, get used to it. Kd has this quote, it was from when he was team mates with Westbrook lol, where he called it a sin. I specifically remember him using that word because he didn’t just call it dumb or politics, he was legitimately appalled lmao. Then he was objectively the most valuable player three years in a row where he won the scoring title each year and led the league in threes, including 2019 where he had the highest impact rating ever, passing steph in 2016, and outscored freaking wilt, until Jokic just barely edged his 2019 season out with his 23 season. All while being one of the greatest floor generals of all time and hard carrying hot garbage more than anyone since young lebron. He led the league in win shares 5 times.</p>

<p>Also can someone please explain to me how kd is a better offensive player than harden? We all know kd is a straight bucket and the iso master. Except harden clearly became a better iso scorer, overall scorer, and has the all time great playmaking kd doesn’t. You can look it up, between 2014-2020 alone harden has more accolades and accomplishments than kd does in his entire career, outside of the free rings harden obviously could’ve gotten too if he joined a 73 win team.</p>

<p>Also im not gonna get into it now because people are gonna get pissed but I’m surprised Russ basically still even gets such a huge pass for being, for lack of a better term, really bad compared to his counting stats. Like I feel like other players people pour over any stats they can find to try and make them look worse. It feels like no one on this sub has ever looked at any of Russ stats outside of raw points, assists, and rebounds. The other day I was actually bored and decided to look up all the award voting shares from like the last ten years. Steph just passed Russ in all nba teams this year. That blew my mind given how great steph is and how…uhh Westbrook is. But the most shocking part was I was looking at awards shares for DPOY and all defensive teams, and literally every year of his career except I think his rookie season Russ gets voted into like the top 20 of DPOY or the all defense teams. That absolutely blew my mind, like I obviously would have assumed he never got a DPOY or all defense vote in his life, and there’s these obviously deranged people voting for him every season. And like these are the people that decide actual important award winners that people use to rank players all time.</p>

<p>But seriously though, if Luka finishes above harden it’s pretty objective proof that people are just picking the players they like more and it’s completely meaningless.</p>

Ever since 17 when I hear the words triple double i want to punch someone. It’s an embarrassment to the league that he has an mvp</p>
