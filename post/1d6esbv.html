      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1d6esbv/an_overview_on_the_memphis_grizzlies_of_the_early/"><p>An overview on the Memphis Grizzlies of the early 10s.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I was looking back at Spurs loss to Memphis in 2011 (yeah i like suffering), but, damn, they were better than i could remember. It&rsquo;s not like they were a super team, but in hindsight that lineup was great.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>PG: Mike Conley.</strong> Yeah, the same Mike that was playing WCF for Minnesota. He was young but already serviceable. Great mind, good shooter and good defender for his size.</li>
<li><strong>SG: Tony Allen.</strong> Exceptionally good on defense; one of the best defensive guards in the world. He got praised a lot by his peers, like Kobe, Durant and Curry. I can&rsquo;t remember if he was good on the offensive end, as well, but his stats say no.</li>
<li><strong>SF: Rudy Gay.</strong> Definitely a pure scorer, but he was really skillful at that, so his defensive liability was overlooked. He was young like Conley, but already a consolidated starter.</li>
<li><strong>PF: Zach Randolph.</strong> Really strong and powerful player, good on both ends. I believe he was the best defender of the team in 2011. I never liked him for his behavior, but can&rsquo;t negate the talent.</li>
<li><strong>C: Marc Gasol.</strong> Powerful defender (even won DPOY in 2013) with great skill with the ball. He was asked to walk his brother&rsquo;s path and didn&rsquo;t disappoint. Him and Zach were one of the best defensive frontcourt in the league.</li>
</ul>

<p>&ldquo;Honorable&rdquo;(?) Mention: <strong>O.J. Mayo</strong> probably on PEDs and with attitude problems. Still strong in those years. He left after 2011-12 season.</p>

<p>Overall, they were defensive-minded, with Rudy and Zach able to provide a prolific attack and Conley as the mind. They were relatively young and this might have impacted their results. They also lacked a clear superstar to compete in those years, which were top heavy and had dynasties and superteams roaming around. Randolph starting to suffer a series of injuries and O.J. debacle didn&rsquo;t help either.</p>

<p>They had ups and downs in the RG and playoffs:</p>

<ul>
<li>In <strong>2011 (46-36)</strong> they took down San Antonio in one of the greatest upsets in history, they then lost to the rising OKC in a 7 games series.</li>
<li>In <strong>2012 (41-25)</strong> they went out 1st round against the Clippers.</li>
<li>In <strong>2013 (56-26)</strong> they took revenge on Clippers and then on OKC, but got swep by San Antonio out for blood in <strong>WCF</strong>.</li>
<li>In <strong>2014 (50-32)</strong> they went out 1st round against OKC, which answered back.</li>
<li>In <strong>2015 (55-27)</strong> they won 1st round, but lost 2nd against the future champions Golden State, which was kind of expected, but they still took them to game 6.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a small franchise they had a good stretch and showed concrete chances of competitiveness.</p>

<p>Do you think they would be good today? Better or worse than their current roster?</p>

      <label for="l6rue73" class="commentText"><p>It’s one of the great teams that is lost to history because the West is too damn stacked. Like the Tmac and Yao Rockets that nearly beat the Lakers in 2008. Or the LMA Blazers with Roy and Oden and later Dame</p>

<p>There’s gonna be a lot of teams right now doomed to a similar fate out there</p>
