</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I was looking back at Spurs loss to Memphis in 2011 (yeah i like suffering), but, damn, they were better than i could remember. It&rsquo;s not like they were a super team, but in hindsight that lineup was great.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>PG: Mike Conley.</strong> Yeah, the same Mike that was playing WCF for Minnesota. He was young but already serviceable. Great mind, good shooter and good defender for his size.</li>
<li><strong>SG: Tony Allen.</strong> Exceptionally good on defense; one of the best defensive guards in the world. He got praised a lot by his peers, like Kobe, Durant and Curry. I can&rsquo;t remember if he was good on the offensive end, as well, but his stats say no.</li>
<li><strong>SF: Rudy Gay.</strong> Definitely a pure scorer, but he was really skillful at that, so his defensive liability was overlooked. He was young like Conley, but already a consolidated starter.</li>
<li><strong>PF: Zach Randolph.</strong> Really strong and powerful player, good on both ends. I believe he was the best defender of the team in 2011. I never liked him for his behavior, but can&rsquo;t negate the talent.</li>
<li><strong>C: Marc Gasol.</strong> Powerful defender (even won DPOY in 2013) with great skill with the ball. He was asked to walk his brother&rsquo;s path and didn&rsquo;t disappoint. Him and Zach were one of the best defensive frontcourt in the league.</li>
</ul>

<p>&ldquo;Honorable&rdquo;(?) Mention: <strong>O.J. Mayo</strong> probably on PEDs and with attitude problems. Still strong in those years. He left after 2011-12 season.</p>

<p>Overall, they were defensive-minded, with Rudy and Zach able to provide a prolific attack and Conley as the mind. They were relatively young and this might have impacted their results. They also lacked a clear superstar to compete in those years, which were top heavy and had dynasties and superteams roaming around. Randolph starting to suffer a series of injuries and O.J. debacle didn&rsquo;t help either.</p>

<p>They had ups and downs in the RG and playoffs:</p>

<ul>
<li>In <strong>2011 (46-36)</strong> they took down San Antonio in one of the greatest upsets in history, they then lost to the rising OKC in a 7 games series.</li>
<li>In <strong>2012 (41-25)</strong> they went out 1st round against the Clippers.</li>
<li>In <strong>2013 (56-26)</strong> they took revenge on Clippers and then on OKC, but got swep by San Antonio out for blood in <strong>WCF</strong>.</li>
<li>In <strong>2014 (50-32)</strong> they went out 1st round against OKC, which answered back.</li>
<li>In <strong>2015 (55-27)</strong> they won 1st round, but lost 2nd against the future champions Golden State, which was kind of expected, but they still took them to game 6.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a small franchise they had a good stretch and showed concrete chances of competitiveness.</p>

<p>Do you think they would be good today? Better or worse than their current roster?</p>

      <label for="l6rue73" class="commentText"><p>It’s one of the great teams that is lost to history because the West is too damn stacked. Like the Tmac and Yao Rockets that nearly beat the Lakers in 2008. Or the LMA Blazers with Roy and Oden and later Dame</p>

<p>There’s gonna be a lot of teams right now doomed to a similar fate out there</p>

      <label for="l6uj5eg" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ll happily speak to Tony Allen&rsquo;s offense!</p>

<p>TA was a poor shooter on a relatively low volume. He was an active cutter, and finished decently at the rim off of those cuts, especially over smaller defenders.  He was also a good rebounder for a guard, especially on the offensive end. He had a decent handle, and while not particularly creative in this regard, he was an able and willing passer.</p>

<p>His most obvious offensive creation would happen off of his steals, where he&rsquo;d run the fast break. He was a WAY shittier finisher on those fast break layups (he was a bit of a head case on those), but he was a good enough rebounder to get a second chance at those fairly often.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a narrative that TA&rsquo;s poor offense allowed Kerr to put Andrew Bogut on him in 2015, allowing him to help on our bigs more. This wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible without the TA hamstring injury that really limited his ability as a cutter.</p>

<p>Those quick cuts to the rim really helped keep defenses honest when they were gearing up for a full plate of slow-ass zbo post-ups, and Tony was a good enough passer to find a big when the defense overcommitted to him.</p>

      <label for="l6uu39z" class="commentText"><p>The 2011 upset of the Spurs was an underrated part of the Mavs winning the chip. We lost 3 of 4 against them that year and they were always sort of lurking as the Mavs&rsquo; nemesis in the West. They were a big reason why we were treated as an afterthought in terms of potential title teams. Don&rsquo;t know what would have happened in the playoffs but I suspect they would have been a tougher out than a still-a-year-away OKC team ended up being.</p>

<p>So, uh, thanks.</p>

      <label for="l6t1p2b" class="commentText"><p>Those Grizzlies teams were actually really well equipped to take on that Heat team. Off the top of my head I don&rsquo;t remember our record against them, but i remember not being scared of them at all. Those Grizzlies teams simply forced other teams to play a painfully slow game. You could either shoot your way past us <em>(gsw)</em> or be an exceptional halfcourt offense <em>(spurs)</em>, but athletic teams looking to play in transition and teams relying on star power were regularly embarrassed by us. It was kinda our thing.</p>
