<p>My friends needed one more person for their draft and even though I knew next to nothing about the NBA nor have played on a basketball team in my life, they still insisted I join so I eventually did</p>

<p>I had Auto draft on since I didn’t know who to pick so it just selected players for me and the first player I got was Chris Paul who I learned more about and became one of my favorite players of all time, plus I ended up getting Blake Griffin so I really started tuning into a lot of Clippers games</p>

<p>From there, I would listen to a bunch of NBA podcasts and watch YouTube episodes of a daily NBA show called The Starters (formerly Basketball Jones and now the No Dunks podcast) that gave really good recaps of that night’s games in a fun, casual yet informative way</p>

<p>I also used Basketball Reference a lot to look up career stats for players as well as what they’re averaging that specific season and what their percentages were from different areas of the floor</p>

You&rsquo;ll pick up a lot just by watching games and you can always look up something you hear about and don&rsquo;t understand. Unfortunately, online basketball communities are a mixed bag, but you can learn a lot from places like reddit and tiktok</p>

      <label for="lm8uonm" class="commentText"><p>Not a stupid question at all. I&rsquo;d say it depends on what you want to learn.</p>

<p>Quick: If you&rsquo;re looking to understand rules, that&rsquo;s totally different. Watch a few tutorials and play a (video) game.</p>

<p>Details: But if I really wanted to get into the background and evolution of the game to understand the present, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d do.</p>

<p>Just like learning a subject and developing a passion for it, prime your brain first :)</p>

<p>Start from the beginning, ie the history of the sport and look up James Naismith. Which country was he from?</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/AdGeedbI1fg?si=tHuXmHhvyKf3O_Wv" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/AdGeedbI1fg?si=tHuXmHhvyKf3O_Wv</a></p>

<p>Then do a quick review of the rules as it can get confusing if you watch a game. You don&rsquo;t need to get into the weeds, but skim as part of priming your brain. Lots of YT tutorials here to help you.</p>

<p>Next, look at how the sport evolved. Here&rsquo;s an article from Bleacher report on the different eras
<a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1554991-ranking-each-decade-of-nba-basketball-from-the-1960s-to-today" target="_blank">https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1554991-ranking-each-decade-of-nba-basketball-from-the-1960s-to-today</a></p>

<p>Pick up the names of the superstars from those eras and check out a few YT videos to see what made them great. There are documentaries on Netflix on Bill Russell and Jordan (The Last Dance) to help out from an understanding and entertainment perspective.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also see how the NBA compares against international teams. Start with the &lsquo;92 dream team and why they were called that. Then check out a great documentary on Argentina in 2004 aka the golden generation.
<a href="https://tv.apple.com/gb/show/the-golden-generation/umc.cmc.6cgd85kb87hzncs768tha3xd2" target="_blank">https://tv.apple.com/gb/show/the-golden-generation/umc.cmc.6cgd85kb87hzncs768tha3xd2</a></p>

<p>(There are YT videos also if you don&rsquo;t have a subscription.)</p>

<p>Also check out incredible recent playoff/championship games (2016 Cavs, 2019 Raps)</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re old enough, you&rsquo;re now ready to get involved in a couple of heated conversations in a bar :)</p>

      <label for="lm9926t" class="commentText"><p>i started watching basketball about two years ago during the 2022 NBA Finals and because of how much i grew to love the sport, i now know more about basketball and the NBA than a lot of people who started watching years before me.</p>

<p>you should start from the fundamentals. try to understand the rules, the way the game is officiated (fouls, traveling etc) the 5 positions and their roles (don’t hold this to too much weight though because NBA roles aren’t strict). also understand terms like “post”, “paint”, “perimeter”, “restricted area”, “corner”, “wing”, “above the break” — basically the different spots on the court.</p>

<p>you should also learn about basic stats like points per game, assists, rebounds, steals, blocks, field goal percentage (FG%), free throw percentage (FT%).</p>

<p>to speed up the learning process, you could watch some videos on youtube to understand these basics terms and concepts along with other stuff like the NBA draft.</p>

<p>you should also watch more games. you can start with highlights on Youtube then later progress to full games. we’re in the offseason so this is a great time to watch former games.</p>

<p>there are a ton of old full games on youtube and the NBA website/app [go to the “watch” segment and scroll all the way down to the bottom. there are full NBA finals game — all the way back to 1990. there are also a number of classic games for each NBA team e.g the Lakers].</p>

<p>with time you’d progress to more advanced stats like true shooting percentage (TS%), effective field goal percentage (eFG%), defensive field goal percentage (dFG%), team offensive rating (oRTG), team defensive rating (dRTG), pace, relative true shooting percentage (rTS%), rebound %, assist % etc.</p>

<p>and if you’re a stat guy like me lolol, you might eventually take a bit of shine to advanced analytics like EPM, RAPM etc.</p>

<p>with a bit of time, you’d understand that all stats need context and they should only serve to augment what you’ve actually watched. you’d also understand that some stats inherently have more value than others (e.g TS% and eFG% are better stats than FG%).</p>

<p>with time you start to pick up offensive and defensive schemes and you start to notice nuances in the game.</p>

      <label for="lm9aiim" class="commentText"><p>Just pick a team and watch them. An easy team to like watching are the Warriors during their dynasty. If you want to watch current games I would recommend watching the Celtics.</p>

<p>If you already have a team you want to support then I’d say you could just start watching them.. but I assume you do not.</p>

<p>You can pick a team based on your location, or just the player you like.</p>

<p>I’m personally a basketball fan and a fan of a few players. I like the playstyle of a few players so I watch those teams. I enjoy watching Steph Curry. He is always fun to watch and I like their style of play.. although they could be on the down turn and the fan base isn’t necessarily the best to join.</p>

<p>If you want to watch good basketball now and a team likely to go through a lot of different phases in the next few years then I’d watch the Clippers. If you wanted something more fast pace as in seeing them go from bad to contenders then the Spurs could be interesting with Victor Wembanyama.</p>

<p>I personally wanted to be a Nets fan even though I have no connection to the city/team/players etc. I eventually decided that nah. I didn’t enjoy watching them and last season was the first year I really watched the NBA.</p>

<p>So I started watching the Warriors.</p>

<p>In the playoffs I enjoyed watching the Mavericks even though I didn’t want them to win at the time. Now they are likely one of my top teams going into next season. (I’m a big Dereck Lively fan.. which is odd ngl but I was high on him pre-draft).</p>

      <label for="lm9k2w0" class="commentText"><p>In addition to watching games and maybe trying to play, consider reading box scores.</p>

<p>It’s interesting to see why a team one.  Did they just make a higher percentage of their shots?  Did they get more free throw attempts?  Make more 3s?  Did they get more attempts through rebounds or turnovers?</p>

<p>I always find that interesting.</p>

      <label for="lm9p589" class="commentText"><p>First of all, just watch games. It&rsquo;s always going to be awesome to watch good basketball. Full games are best, especially if they&rsquo;re competitive. Watching live is a good excuse to hang out with friends or drink a beer too.</p>

<p>The rest you can find easily. I do enjoy the occasional Secret Base or Thinking Basketball video myself.</p>

      <label for="lm9t34n" class="commentText"><p>It’s a bit tricky in today’s NBA, because the positions are becoming less and less defined.</p>

<p>For example, since Curry, many players who start at PG (mainly due to height) are the primary scorers on their team (Brunson, Dame, Ja), while historically the job of the PG was to make sure to get their 2-5 involved in scoring. Another modern day example is Draymond Green, who typically starts at the 4, but plays much more like a point-center (Sets screens for the backcourt, plays interior D, makes passes for his scorers).</p>

<p>Your best bet may be to start watching individual highlights by position (i.e. 1. Isiah/Magic, 2. Kobe/MJ, 3. LB/LBJ, 4. KG/TD, 5. KAJ/Shaq) and try to notice similarities between all-time greats who played the same position.</p>

<p>Once you know the primary jobs of certain positions, you can start to understand the flow of a game, i.e. P+R’s/post splits and defensive strategies.</p>

<p>It just takes time, because again, basketball is far more loose and maliable than a sport like baseball or gridiron, as everyone on a team plays defense, passes and scores. Watch highlights from every era, get into some individual players, then teams, and you’ll have a proper understanding in no time.</p>
