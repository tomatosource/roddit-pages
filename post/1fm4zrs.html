</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I’m a Timberwolves fan and was thinking about the decision to let Chauncey Billups go to Detroit, where he became a long-term star in the 2000’s. At the time, the decision made more sense - he really didn’t become that level of a player until he joined the Pistons.</p>

<p>My question is: are there any other free agent signings that had this sort if impact for their team and for the person’s career?</p>

<p>It doesn’t need to be “a nobody became a mega star” but like Kevin Durant already had scoring titles before he went to the championship Warriors, so we already knew he’d be that great and we already knew the team would be that great.</p>

      <label for="lo7xujy" class="commentText"><p>Surely we didn’t let another talented point guard leave 15+ years ago who would also become a top player in the league, who was ALSO good friends with our superstar, who would nearly immediately lead his new team to elite status.</p>

<p>Surely if that happened once we would learn our lesson and not let it happen again</p>

      <label for="lo7xx5y" class="commentText"><p>Jermaine O&rsquo;Neil rode the bench in Portland, then immediately became a star with the Pacers. Jalen Rose was a bust in Denver before becoming a star with the Pacers. Oladipo was a midlevel starter for his career, then became a star with the Pacers. Ron Artest was a solid player in Chicago who became a star with the Pacers. Domantas Sabonis shot less than 40% from the floor in OKC then became a star with the Pacers. Malcom Brogdon was a solid role player on the Bucks but became a star with the Pacers.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not even a pacers fan, but it seems like they might be the best in the league at identifying players who can elevate their games if given the chance.</p>

      <label for="lo7xy1a" class="commentText"><p>Jimmy Butler raised the floor of every team that traded for him, and they all became worse after he left.</p>

<p>Wolves were the 3rd seed before he became injured, they slipped out of the playoffs picture without him until he came back early to win the last 3 games of the season so they made 8th seed on the last game. They didn&rsquo;t make the playoffs after trading him.</p>

<p>Philly came one game winner from beating the champions, and Jimmy were arguably their best player in the playoffs, then dont re-sign him and get swept in the first round next year.</p>

<p>Miami were in &ldquo;basketball hell&rdquo; when they managed to sign Jimmy and went from a non playoffs team to a finals team and contender for several years.</p>
