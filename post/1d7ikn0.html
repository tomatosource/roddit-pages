</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><strong>Tl;dr</strong>: The Celtics iso all the time because they&rsquo;re elite at making shots, but not as good at passing. It&rsquo;s an intentional strategy.</p>

<hr>

<p>I&rsquo;ve long since run out of new basketball content to consume waiting for the Finals, so I wanted to be part of the solution. Strap in for a way-too-long post because I am very bored.</p>

<p>Hopefully it&rsquo;s informative for people who haven&rsquo;t watched much Celtics basketball this year or are wondering why the hell we iso so much.</p>

<p><strong>Is Mazzulla An Idiot?</strong></p>

<p>A common talking point in the media and even with relatively sophisticated analysts like Zach Lowe and Ben Taylor is that Boston&rsquo;s offense &ldquo;stagnates&rdquo; and iso&rsquo;s too much. Against a set defense, the Celtics usually do a series of PnR&rsquo;s to find a favorable matchup. Then, the ballhandler tries to beat the (hopefully) mismatched or out-of-position defender 1-on-1 with the rest of the team standing around.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll see this a million times in any Celtics game, and it has even increased (at least by my eye test) in the playoffs. This state of affairs confuses people because the side effect is often an all-NBA guy like Tatum standing in the corner and doing nothing.</p>

<p>Is this a waste of talent? Is Mazzulla an idiot?</p>

<p>Given that Mazzulla and his staff get paid millions of dollars to scheme for the Celtics (not to mention GM Brad and his X&rsquo;s-and-O&rsquo;s genius), it&rsquo;s safer to assume that the media is missing something instead of them. After watching a ton of Celtics basketball this season, I&rsquo;d like to share my pet theory: Celtics are covering for their lack of passing talent, their only real offensive weakness.</p>

<p><strong>The One Offensive Weakness</strong></p>

<p>By the numbers, the Celtics technically were the best offense of all-time this year. We all know they have an 8-player rotation of shooters. They also have a surplus of individual shot creators. Tatum, Brown, and Porzingis all iso score at great-to-elite levels. White, Jrue, and Pritchard can make stuff happen off the dribble as secondary creators as well.</p>

<p>All this stuff is non-controversial, so I won&rsquo;t belabor the point.</p>

<p>However, while all these players have really good scoring ability and are GOOD passers, none of them are ELITE passers like a top-tier point guard, let alone someone like Luka or Jokic. As such, iso ball is often a decent option to reduce the number of potentially poor passing decisions.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s use three examples to illustrate my point. First, Tatum&rsquo;s behind the back pass to Horford in the ECF G3 against the Pacers near the end of the game. <a href="https://streamable.com/4y4yp2" target="_blank">Here&rsquo;s a link</a>. I rate Tatum as a good play-maker (B or B+) because he&rsquo;s very good at getting past the initial defender, drawing help, and then making nifty pass to an open man like Horford.</p>

<p>People used this pass to highlight his progress as a creator for teammates. While he has certainly grown, notice though that he has a simple read here. While the pass itself is awesome, Tatum is still just reading his and Horford&rsquo;s defenders for the most part. It&rsquo;s not rocket science.</p>

<p>Another example (sorry, no link): Again ECF G1, this time in OT. With less than 2 minutes left, Tatum botches a pass to Jrue Holiday, leading to 3 FT&rsquo;s for Haliburton after a steal the other way. While infrequent watchers of Celtics basketball chalked this up to Tatum &ldquo;choking&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s actually representative of many bad possessions by the Celtics.</p>

<p>You see awkward passing from time-to-time, not just from Tatum but every ballhandler. Hesitant post entry passes, missed cutters, slightly inaccurate passes that give the defense time to close out a shooter, stuff like that. The team has all gotten better at passing, but no one is at the level of elite distributors, let alone someone like Luka.</p>

<p>Final example (sorry, no link): WCF Game 2. Around 3:35 in Q1, Luka gets trapped near the logo by Ant and Gobert. Without hesitation, Luka fake-looks to the left wing and lasers a no-look pass to Lively in the paint. Because the pass gets there so fast and unexpectedly, McDaniels panics and helps from the strong-side corner, leaving Lively an easy pass to a wide open Hardy who hilariously bricks the 3.</p>

<p>I like this example because it&rsquo;s so routine for Luka. We saw plays like this virtually every game from him this year (at least ones I watched), sometimes multiple times. No-look lasers, precise lobs, pinpoint skip passes to the opposite corner, you take these for granted when watching top tier passers like him.</p>

<p>These are not skills that any Celtic has or even approaches. It&rsquo;s not that they lack all-world level passing of someone like Luka, which is obvious. It&rsquo;s that they lack a player with even all-star level passing, someone like prime Rondo or Draymond.</p>

<p><strong>Motion Is Overrated</strong></p>

<p>OK, so the Celtics lack a truly elite passer. So what? This doesn&rsquo;t stop them from running more motion in their offense, right? Yes, but this brings us full circle to Celtics&rsquo; offensive talent.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s review the Celtics offensive talent again. Porzingis has crazy post up efficiency vs. mismatches. Tatum and Brown can get around (or through) almost any defender in the league 1-on-1. Derrick White only needs a sliver of space to launch 3s or drive past someone for his little floater. Jrue has his big boy post-moves.</p>

<p>Assuming we can get a mismatch or attack downhill, that&rsquo;s usually enough for us to get a good look. Adding motion to the offense, especially off-ball actions in conjunction with on-ball actions, leads to more difficult pass-reads and pass-making. This can lead to more turnovers, especially without an elite passer at the helm.</p>

<p>With our embarrassment of talent at shot-making, ending a possession in a passing turnover is a disaster. You&rsquo;d rather them get a look vs a mismatch in iso and see what happens, even if it does end up in a bricked midrange fadeaway.</p>

<p>A missed shot can still draw a shooting foul, a putback, or an offensive rebound. Meanwhile, any turnover ends our chance to score, and a live ball turnover is hard to stop even with our defensive talent.</p>

<p>For these reasons, the Celtics&rsquo; current heavy diet of iso isn&rsquo;t a fluke or a result of Mazzulla being dumber than sports media. It&rsquo;s an intentional core piece of the offense, and it&rsquo;s probably optimal given our current roster.</p>

<hr>

<p>I have more to say about why we&rsquo;re seeing more iso in the playoffs, what other teams have done to slow our iso&rsquo;ing, and how it&rsquo;ll fare against the Mavs in the Finals, but I&rsquo;ll save that for another edition if I have time. This is already getting way too long.</p>

<p>Agree with me? Think I&rsquo;m an idiot? Would love to hear in the comments. I&rsquo;m clearly way too bored.</p>

      <label for="l6zjym2" class="commentText"><p>Live by the 3 die by the 3 is a narrative that is applied to past Celtics teams more than this team. The 3’s this Celtics team takes are quality shots within the offense opened up by dribble drives from jrue, white, brown and Tatum. It’s why our percentage is near the top of the league. And the more quality 3’s we take, there is actually less variance too.</p>

      <label for="l717xyb" class="commentText"><p>I hear this point all the time. However, Dallas pretty much got the blueprint to beat the Celtics against the Thunder:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>top 5 offense and defense</p></li>

<li><p>best 3pt % in the league</p></li>

<li><p>5-out offense for 38 out of 48 minutes (exception were the 10 Giddey minutes. If Kornet plays for the Celtics, it will be pretty much the same)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>They let Lou Dort hunt Luka for 40 minutes a game on defense and let him shoot wide open 3s on offense. he went from a 39% 3pt shooter to a 31% shooter in the series. Were the lights too bright? was it just a bad stretch? or was Dort gassed?</p>

<p>its going to be interesting if Jrue, White and potentially Brown can still hit their 3s when they have to hunt Luka and Kyrie for 44 minutes a game. Dallas might just copy the OKC game plan.</p>

      <label for="l718dqi" class="commentText"><p>That’s a good point and honestly I think we will just have to see. A lot of this is unknown territory. We have no clue how this version of the Celtics and this version of the mavs will match up. One thing I know for sure is that the best player in the series is on the mavericks and that has to have some sort of effect. The previous Celtics/Mavs matchups this season don’t paint an accurate picture of how this series will go.</p>

<p>Either way, I think we are going to have a very good finals. I’d love for Luka to go god mode and for kyrie to redeem himself against the Celtics, squashing any narrative there is about winning his ‘only’ chip’ with lebron. However, on paper, this Celtics team shouldn’t lose a series to any team in the league. We can all sit here analyzing the stats but no one can predict the future.</p>

<p>Anyways.. mavs in 6.</p>

      <label for="l71brb0" class="commentText"><p>The differences are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>SGA is elite at shot creation but no other players in OKC is really good at that. 3-point shooters are not enough, if you don&rsquo;t have that. Your defensive scheme at that series won&rsquo;t be enough.</p></li>

<li><p>OKC defence has always been taking away the driving lanes with a lots of help from the corners. Even I have been saying that PJ will feast and be the x factor from game 1 in that series (pick Dallas as the winner in my bracket) in game threads here. While we use that corner help too with drop like every other team, that is not all of our arsenal.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That being said, we will have to better against p&amp;r and sets around the horn, while you will have to deal with a more complicated offense than your previous opponents with chin sets, pin down p&amp;r&rsquo;s and so on. Just as people overlook at your defensive progression and scheme for last four months, they are overlooking all those actions for Boston by simplifying our offense &ldquo;drive and kick&rdquo;, &ldquo;5 out&rdquo; etc. That will be fun and all the fans on both sides thinking that they are going against a simple opponent they figured out will be really surprised.</p>

<p>So Celtics media and Bill Simmons should stop crying for lack of credit. Showing stats from these super-easy, injury-lucky series is just weak. These are empty calories. Bad team good stats guy doesnt count so easy matchups good stats also doesnt count.</p>

<p>Just be happy with Finals/Title but not ask some credit like if Celtics beat any decent team yet.</p>

      <label for="l6zs1s7" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve seen less of the wildly open 3s in the playoffs though because teams are playing more disciplined defense.</p>

<p>Against Miami and Cleveland, it felt like nothing was truly open that often because they helped late and stayed at home mostly with the shooters. Even when they rotated, they prioritized running people off the line instead of protecting the paint.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t stop us, but it prevents getting run out of the gym like you&rsquo;d see so many times in the reg season.</p>

<p>Pacers, they just sucked it up sometimes like in the Tatum example. They scored enough to make up for it though.</p>

      <label for="l7170x2" class="commentText"><p>Is it really different? Giddey played 10 min. For the other 38 min it was Joe and Dort, who both are very good 3 pt shooters (39% and 41% on 6.5 and 4.5 attempts). On paper, all 5 players from okc could hit the 3 for 38 out of 48 minutes. they just didnt. Three possible explanations:</p>

<ul>
<li>the lights were too bright</li>
<li>the Mavs defense was extremely good</li>
<li>Lou Dort was gassed on offense bc he had to chase Luka the entire game</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe it was a combination of all of that…how good will the shotmaking of Jrue, Brown and White be after chasing Luka and Kyrie on defense for 44 minutes? Will their 3% go down like the one from Lou Dort?</p>

<p>I think the problem is that some possessions nobody touches the ball EXCEPT the person ISOing</p>

<p>ISO works better when you ISO after a bunch of passes because then your team stays engaged and the opponent has to predict where the ISO comes from, whilst maintaining good positioning</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mind ISO</p>

<p>I mind constant Tatum almost-8-second-violation into pounding the ball for 8 more seconds before going ISO</p>

<p>The one thing he struggles with is being too patient. Brown can usually get to the rim or a midrange and make it a lot because he’s very deliberate about his spots. It seems like Tatum is always waiting for something to open up and sometimes it doesn’t. I feel like he needs a tiny bit more direction, which is why it’s good Boston doesn’t have to have him as <strong>primary primary</strong> ball handler all the time.</p>

I completely agree with your point that a lot of the dialogue about Boston&rsquo;s offense is pretty unsophisticated, even from people like Zach Lowe.  Its the best in the league, yet it gets stagnant?  They kind of stop there instead of going into the &ldquo;why&rdquo; or &ldquo;how.&rdquo;  And in any event it seems like it would be difficult for both of those things to be true, so you figured out why it might <em>look</em> like it stagnates.</p>

      <label for="l70oky9" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a solid take.   As a cetlics fans, we see a team full of very good passers but technically very good passer isn&rsquo;t elite so it makes sense to not pass too much and risk a TO.</p>

<p>The reality is 5 starters that can create their own shot means you don&rsquo;t need to risk it, and most teams don&rsquo;t have 5 starters creating their own shots.  it&rsquo;s a very unusual comp.</p>

<p>Injured CLE was a good example of a team where some guys need a pass as they can&rsquo;t create.   Dallas is weird because they have 2 elite creators who are S tier at shot creation or passing.  They have players who absolutely need a pass but Luka is so elite at that skill that the turnover risk is low.</p>

      <label for="l70w0jx" class="commentText"><p>I thought this all season. When they play other teams they typically have 6 of the best 8 or 9 players in the game. Get the ball to the guy being guarded by number 11. Occasionally run action to get that 11th on the number 1-4 best player in the game.  Sometimes with bench you have the best player being guarded by the 13th or 14th.</p>

      <label for="l6zpnx0" class="commentText"><p>I generally agree with your points on their offense. The one thing that I might disagree on is &lsquo;Celtics don&rsquo;t have an elite passer&rsquo;. Most teams don&rsquo;t have one either. Most teams just need a decent/above average passers. I think the better thing to say might be their talent is slower at reading passing lanes so they keep things simple and not rely on motion offense. They focus more on making a correct read with their iso offense which is simple and safe rather than making a fast read to accelerate their passing offense which is more prone to turnovers.</p>

<p>This is why this Celtics team stumps everyone a little. With their talent, people look and believe they should be able to make fast reads. I have the Celtics winning the Finals, but I can easily see this being a sweep or seven games. Their variance is just that high to me.</p>

<p>For the Mavs, I imagine most people will say 6-7 games just due to a more grind it out play style. If Mavs win in less games, it will be due to variance of the Celtics IMO.</p>

      <label for="l6zquqs" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s fair. It&rsquo;s more the fast reads than skill, though I do think there&rsquo;s plain passing skill lacking too. You see teams aggressively ball-denying us in the post in every playoff series. It&rsquo;s worth the risk because they know our passers aren&rsquo;t that great at entries, so it bogs down the possession sometimes.</p>

<p>Which current contending teams don&rsquo;t have a top tier passer though? Maybe I&rsquo;m missing someone, I only thought of the Timberwolves, and I think they felt that loss in the Dallas series because they couldn&rsquo;t generate offense, especially if Conley was out.</p>

Some examples of teams that could have contended with no elite passer, but flamed out due to other reasons:</p>

<p>Sixers: Embiid/Maxey - good passers. Health issues.</p>

<p>Bucks: Dame/Giannis - Similar to Sixers.</p>

<p>Thunder: Shai - good passer. Lack of team experience IMO.</p>

<p>Suns: Booker/Durant/Beal - average passers at best. Depth and defense issues.</p>

<p>Warriors: Draymond is questionable at elite if anything makes really good reads. Depth issues.</p>

<p>Knicks: Brunson is average at best; More team passing; Injury issues.</p>

<p>Heat: Butler is great playmaker. Injury issues.</p>

<p>Overall, there are only a handful of elite passers in the league. Not every team has one. A lot of teams get by with top tier playmakers which is a difference group from elite passers. Celtics are a contender with no top tier passer, but above average playmakers in Tatum, White, Jrue, and Horford.</p>

Dallas has some guys that can defend but after a couple of games Brown and Tatum are devastating because they figure you out and they get to their favourite spots at will.</p>

      <label for="l6zvv63" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t have an issue with us isolating against mismatches. I think the only criticism of our offense that actually makes sense is the tempo thing— it doesn&rsquo;t happen as much as some people seem to think it does, but it <em>is</em> really frustrating when we burn 10 seconds off the shot clock before even starting our first action, or decide to dump it off to Tatum for a pullup with over 10 seconds left on the clock. And to be clear, this isn&rsquo;t a Tatum thing, it&rsquo;s a general team offense thing. They can&rsquo;t be doing that shit against Dallas.</p>

      <label for="l702ic8" class="commentText"><p>One major problem with your theory is that nobody on the Celtics is great at isolating. Tatum&rsquo;s roughly the 20th best in the league, Brown is closer to 80th, Porzingus gets so few isos and doesn&rsquo;t score well on them. (This is eyeballing the iso stats, I count 16ish guys on high volume with better ppp than Tatum this year, and some guys who are probably better had down years (Durant), Brown is so far down I stopped counting)</p>

<p>Their team isolation stats seem to be buoyed by elite spacing and the lack of truly poor iso-players&hellip; Such as rookies exploring the studio space (Banchero/Barnes/Cade) tank commanders (Poole/Kuzma), unaware vets (WB, Beal, Randle), bad bench gunners (big gov&rsquo;t).</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re not actually beating their man one-on-one at an elite level. Especially considering that Tatum has the highest iso frequency in the league and Brown is in the top 40.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is Mazulla&rsquo;s plan. They&rsquo;ve had this criticism the last 6-7 years (never being below 9th in iso frequency). The Jays just seem to default to isolation.</p>

<p>While they aren&rsquo;t a bad iso team, they&rsquo;re just so much better when they don&rsquo;t do it, dropping 3-4 isos per game would make their offense even more dominant.</p>

      <label for="l7070lq" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s too frequent to be not intentional. Do those stats include the PPP for the entire team or just efficiency for the person for the iso possession? If it&rsquo;s just for the person, it might miss the knock on effects of shooting these shots and getting the putback/rebound as well.</p>

<p>The stats also don&rsquo;t necessarily measure beating their man, just what they score, right? The open 3s we get usually come off these drives, so I&rsquo;d guess you&rsquo;d have to factor that as well. Saying that Tatum isn&rsquo;t getting past his initial defender seems an incorrect statement because that&rsquo;s literally the engine of our offense and how we generated a lot of our 3s in the first place.</p>

      <label for="l70opa7" class="commentText"><p>I really don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s intentional.</p>

<p>It definitely doesn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;s there to open up putbacks. Their offensive rebound rate (even adjusted for their awesome shooting numbers) is middle of the road. A Tatum/Brown iso on a mismatch doesn&rsquo;t provide a numbers edge on the glass.</p>

<p>This is nitpicking that I&rsquo;m doing. Boston would have a better offense if they eliminated 3-5 isos per game (rank 15-20 rather than #4). Ultimately, we&rsquo;re arguing over 4% of Boston&rsquo;s possessions, their offense is unbelievable. It&rsquo;s so good that we criticize a good play because it&rsquo;s not a great play.</p>

<p>Mazzulla, the Js, Porzingus, the whole team deserve tons of credit.</p>

<p>Mazzulla can be criticized; he definitely gets more than his fair share. he has a great offensive system, the guys have bought in (even guys accepting smaller roles than they could probably expect). He&rsquo;s done a great job.</p>

People act like 5 people cutting, moving, filling, spaces, stretching out is supposed to be going on every play and easy to execute. But that can lead to overcomplication and more mistakes. Its also can get blown up if the defense reads it already. It also tires everyone out. A point no one talks about is no matter how creative the coach is, the players either have to be really smart and in synch or have a specific role ingrained in them. I dont think 60% of the NBA can fit that category. Being able to create from mismatches is a key factor to every offense and sometimes if your talent suits it, that’s all you need plus spacing. The answer is obviously to mix it up which a lot of coaches do.</p>

      <label for="l700iah" class="commentText"><p>I think the cornerstone of the Celtics offense (like many) is the PnR. Often that turns into isolation certainly, but often it leads to a pop 3 pointer for the screener, a rim run dunk for KP or Kornet, or a kick out on the drive. So I don&rsquo;t think its purely isolation, but sometimes as an option/call (often last one) we iso.</p>

<p>Mazzulla seems most happy when we generate open 3s and move the ball around. That comes from drive and kick most often, but it isn&rsquo;t always a drive from belabored isolation, more just a drive off the PnR.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think we pound the ball as much as a Luka does. I don&rsquo;t often see us dribbling the ball for 16 seconds straight before a drive.</p>

      <label for="l70d3jy" class="commentText"><p>Easily the most overlooked part of Mazzulla. Celtics were disastrous offensively with their turnovers during their finals run of 2 years ago. Mazzulla took over the next year on last minute notice and although he clearly was unprepared and had issues, one of the things he clearly fixed was turnovers. Now the team is one of the least turnover prone teams in the entire NBA.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not as pretty, but people often mistake motion for plays. You can create action out mismatches that lead to easy shots, that&rsquo;s exactly what the Celtics do.</p>

      <label for="l706g0g" class="commentText"><p>Appreciate the effort and there’s definitely something there. But there’s a difference between iso-ing and stagnating. Celtics won’t play well if they walk the ball up, clear out the wing and watch Tatum go to work. They still benefit from swinging the ball and movement. That gets the defense to think and react, and then when an iso happens, there’s flow and rhythm to it. And the criticism is that they spend too much time stagnant. That’s probably an eye test thing though because as noted they had the best offense in the league. The stagnant stretches stand out because otherwise the offense looks great — and to your point they still have elite scorers who can make up for a bad possession. They don’t need elite passing to literally just pass the ball or execute a drive-and-kick, and they do those things plenty.</p>

<p>However, prime Rondo was absolutely an otherworldly passer who made passes every single game that made you gasp.</p>

      <label for="l7098ti" class="commentText"><p>Well it really depends on what your definition of iso is. My definition is that, even if you go through a series of PnR&rsquo;s, if the end result is just one guy squaring up another guy and trying to beat him 1-on-1, that&rsquo;s effectively iso.</p>

<p>This is different from having an offense based on lots of cuts, Curry-style offball actions to free up a shooter, etc.</p>

<p>I also think you&rsquo;re just disagreeing with me straight up with the stagnant point lol (which is fine). I think the &ldquo;stagnant&rdquo; possessions are the point, whereas you think it&rsquo;s a problem for players&rsquo; flow. Agree to disagree I guess.</p>

<p>I will say that, beyond keeping iso&rsquo;s around, pushing the pace has been an obvious point of emphasis from Mazzulla. I see this as getting a good possession without needing to fall into our basic PnR iso ball.</p>

      <label for="l70bqp8" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I do think some ball movement is a nice lubricant for offense even if the passes aren’t home runs. But I don’t contest the point that we have plenty of guys who will have an advantage against an individual defender at any given moment, and that means we don’t need “the beautiful offense” to score. I also think it can be a trap when guys try to spam the mismatch over and over - I think a drive and kick or pick n roll produces more reliable results. When you do have scorers and shooters at every position you need to move the rock to open up lanes.</p>

<p>But shit man I don’t wanna be overly critical I think it’s a good point and more broadly the idea that there are many ways to succeed and the best teams will play their strengths and personnel.</p>

      <label for="l7095er" class="commentText"><p>I agree that our offense should have a lot of iso given our players, but I think you’re underrating our playmakers. We don’t have a Luka or Jokic passer, but I wouldn’t say our passing is actually weak. It’s more so that they have multiple players who are elite at punishing mismatches, so they mismatch hunt- you play to your teams strengths.</p>

<p>White is straight up known for being a great decision maker. It’s his whole thing, he VERY rarely makes mistakes, and when he does it’s one of those random games where he gets all of them out of the way at once lol.</p>

<p>Jrue is a very skilled passer and has run point his whole career at a near all star to all star level, and won a ring at the position. He and White have thrown a LOT of entry passes to Tatum, Brown, and Porzingis this year with very few mistakes.</p>

<p>Tatum is a good enough passer to run offense through. He routinely makes skip passes, uses his height to hit tough angles, and is excellent at passing out of doubles- doubling him is almost always positive for the Celtics. He’s averaging 5.9 assists and a 2.44 assist to turnover ratio this playoffs, which is actually <em>better</em> than Luka’s 2.39 (yes, lower usage and totals, I’m not saying he’s a better playmaker lol).</p>

<p>And we haven’t seen this because he’s been out, but the Celtics do utilize KP in the high post to run motion-type stuff at times- usually for a Brown cut. Their chemistry is great and leads to some great plays, as Porzingis is a very underrated passer. The offense as a whole is much more dynamic with him due to his pop/roll abilities being way better than any other big.</p>

<p>Ultimately though, we are saying the same thing, which is that the playstyle is based on personnel. The Celtics run a scheme that fits their players, and would not be better off running plays that work because of guys like Jokic, Luka, or Curry. Wow that was way too long.</p>

      <label for="l70f2f2" class="commentText"><p>Tldr: Boston don’t have elite passers hence they only play PnR and iso ball. Motion offense is overrated.</p>

<p>Not sure if I agree completely as OP defined “elite passer” as Luka and Jokic. I mean there are only two of these in the whole world… if the answer is you need two of them to play motion offense, is a kind of a big stretch. What is true though is that Boston does lack playmakers in their rotation. Jrue is not your typical PG who directs the offense. They have a lot of secondary playmakers who can initiate offense but don’t have any primary typical PG.</p>

<p>This has to be a deliberate decision by the Celtics as this was critiqued for several playoff runs when Smart had to create opportunities for the team.</p>

<p>I also differ in OPs analysis of motion offense being overrated and heavy iso play being preferable in the playoffs. A heavy motion offense like GSW tend to be TO heavy giving opponents the opportunity for fast breaks and early offense. But you don’t have to play such a one sided offense but a balanced one. I mean even iso heavy offenses need to get the defense into scramble mode, as with great defenses they won’t let you play 1on1 but giving different looks every time down the floor and with help side waiting at the rim. And here comes the crux in Bostons offense, when out of sync the offense resembles a headless chicken where nobody knows what to do, as there is nobody (last seasons) to calm down the offense and reset it, do some set plays to get everyone going.</p>

<p>This year in the playoffs there was also resemblances of the past with inexplicable dry spells. The difference to past years is the experience of the core team in clutch situations and let’s face it the lack of true adversaries. We won’t know if Boston changed and learned from the last seasons until the final starts and they face an elite defensive team in Dallas. On paper both of the teams match rather well with each other. Let’s hope for a long and exciting series!</p>

<p>I think Suns needed more motion because they couldn&rsquo;t fall back on ridiculous talent across the board, particularly the center which couldn&rsquo;t space the floor from 3.</p>

      <label for="l70gnj7" class="commentText"><p>You don&rsquo;t need an elite passer to play motion offense. The Spurs this year play motion offense and they&rsquo;re one of the teams with a high assist rate. If those bums could actually make a shot after the ball swings around and generates an open look, their offense wouldn&rsquo;t be hot garbage.</p>

<p>But the Celtics actually do have shot makers the defense have to respect. They&rsquo;d be much deadlier if they moved the ball around more. If Pop can make a bunch of g-leaguers play motion offense, Joe should be able to get players who are ten times more talented to do the same, especially since they&rsquo;re not gonna need too many passes to generate a good shot because they&rsquo;re so talented they don&rsquo;t need a super wide open look.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with iso, but it is essentially putting all your eggs in one basket. Not in the sense of scoring, but in the sense of breaking down an entire defense. Every good offense can get a ballhandler into the paint. Not only are you dealing with the high variance that comes with shooting so many 3s, now you&rsquo;re also banking on one person to get a paint-touch on isolations just so you could lure the help defender in and get that open 3-point shot. And that&rsquo;s if the iso scorer doesn&rsquo;t just settle for the 3.</p>

They&rsquo;re elite at making tough shots, but not great passers. So, instead of risking bad passes, they let Tatum, Brown, and Porzingis go one-on-one. It plays to their strengths and keeps turnovers down. Mazzulla knows what he&rsquo;s doing!</p>

      <label for="l70a3nb" class="commentText"><p>The main difference is ability to drive and score or kick. We got 4 players who can do that at a decent to elite level (everyone but Porzingis). Wolves only got Ant who&rsquo;s dangerous. Everyone else was only OK at it and not something Mavs were afraid of.</p>

<p>KAT arguably was actively bad. He&rsquo;d get a charging foul every few drives that he tried.</p>

      <label for="l70c4vm" class="commentText"><p>Yeah well, my issue is that the Celtics haven&rsquo;t been tested in this playoffs due to every team losing their main player when they play them. Is that the Celtics fault? no. Does it matter in terms of assessing their quality in terms of playoff games? Yes.</p>

<p>They haven&rsquo;t faced someone of Luka&rsquo;s caliber yet this year. The last time they did, they lost the finals (Curry). So it&rsquo;s really hard to say they will create a mismatch because Dallas only has one actual short person (Kyrie) in the starting lineup. Derick Lively/Gafford has been pretty good in the post. It&rsquo;s easy to have good post effiecney when the best center you have faced in the whole playoffs is one Bam (Who is great but undersized). The constant changing of centers for Dallas allows them to be more powerful and well-rested. Once KP sits who is going to take their place? KP doesn&rsquo;t play all 48 minutes.</p>

<p>Their offense works in the sense they find a short guard and pick on him the whole game. I don&rsquo;t think Kyrie would be getting mismatched in most situations because that isn&rsquo;t his position. Also by the way? you are right. The ISO-heavy game is a feature of your offense. As it has always been from a wing-dominated lineup (look up at KD&rsquo;s team). Usually, when the best player is a wing player they are ISO heavy. This has its benefits, but also has negatives because you end up not having great passers. Which can hurt you in pick and rolls and slashing offense. OR just when the ISO isn&rsquo;t working. You can&rsquo;t really have a plan B.</p>

<p>The ISO-heavy play works when the other team doesn&rsquo;t have a player (or in this case two) that can do the same on the other end. We know KP isn&rsquo;t that high level of a defender how do we know the Mavs can&rsquo;t put him in the same pick-and-roll situation and do the same Timberwolves situation?</p>

<p>Also, I feel the Celtics issue has never really been their offense and defense. It has been mental fortitude and coaching adjustment. Their players don&rsquo;t have that &lsquo;dawg&rsquo; in them, where they can single-handedly take a game over like Curry, Jokic or Luka does.</p>

      <label for="l6zrnon" class="commentText"><p>I mean, it tends to work until it doesn&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;ve shown a remarkable ability to flounder in the waning minutes of games, taking bad shots, and a general failure to generate any cohesive offense.</p>

<p>We haven&rsquo;t really been tested at all yet this playoffs, so it&rsquo;s really TBD, imo. I genuinely do think Mazzoula is a horrible coach when it comes to Xs and Os.</p>
