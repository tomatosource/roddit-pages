</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><strong>Tl;dr</strong>: The Celtics iso all the time because they&rsquo;re elite at making shots, but not as good at passing. It&rsquo;s an intentional strategy.</p>

<hr>

<p>I&rsquo;ve long since run out of new basketball content to consume waiting for the Finals, so I wanted to be part of the solution. Strap in for a way-too-long post because I am very bored.</p>

<p>Hopefully it&rsquo;s informative for people who haven&rsquo;t watched much Celtics basketball this year or are wondering why the hell we iso so much.</p>

<p><strong>Is Mazzulla An Idiot?</strong></p>

<p>A common talking point in the media and even with relatively sophisticated analysts like Zach Lowe and Ben Taylor is that Boston&rsquo;s offense &ldquo;stagnates&rdquo; and iso&rsquo;s too much. Against a set defense, the Celtics usually do a series of PnR&rsquo;s to find a favorable matchup. Then, the ballhandler tries to beat the (hopefully) mismatched or out-of-position defender 1-on-1 with the rest of the team standing around.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll see this a million times in any Celtics game, and it has even increased (at least by my eye test) in the playoffs. This state of affairs confuses people because the side effect is often an all-NBA guy like Tatum standing in the corner and doing nothing.</p>

<p>Is this a waste of talent? Is Mazzulla an idiot?</p>

<p>Given that Mazzulla and his staff get paid millions of dollars to scheme for the Celtics (not to mention GM Brad and his X&rsquo;s-and-O&rsquo;s genius), it&rsquo;s safer to assume that the media is missing something instead of them. After watching a ton of Celtics basketball this season, I&rsquo;d like to share my pet theory: Celtics are covering for their lack of passing talent, their only real offensive weakness.</p>

<p><strong>The One Offensive Weakness</strong></p>

<p>By the numbers, the Celtics technically were the best offense of all-time this year. We all know they have an 8-player rotation of shooters. They also have a surplus of individual shot creators. Tatum, Brown, and Porzingis all iso score at great-to-elite levels. White, Jrue, and Pritchard can make stuff happen off the dribble as secondary creators as well.</p>

<p>All this stuff is non-controversial, so I won&rsquo;t belabor the point.</p>

<p>However, while all these players have really good scoring ability and are GOOD passers, none of them are ELITE passers like a top-tier point guard, let alone someone like Luka or Jokic. As such, iso ball is often a decent option to reduce the number of potentially poor passing decisions.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s use three examples to illustrate my point. First, Tatum&rsquo;s behind the back pass to Horford in the ECF G3 against the Pacers near the end of the game.Â <a href="https://streamable.com/4y4yp2" target="_blank">Here&rsquo;s a link</a>. I rate Tatum as a good play-maker (B or B+) because he&rsquo;s very good at getting past the initial defender, drawing help, and then making nifty pass to an open man like Horford.</p>

<p>People used this pass to highlight his progress as a creator for teammates. While he has certainly grown, notice though that he has a simple read here. While the pass itself is awesome, Tatum is still just reading his and Horford&rsquo;s defenders for the most part. It&rsquo;s not rocket science.</p>

<p>Another example (sorry, no link): Again ECF G1, this time in OT. With less than 2 minutes left, Tatum botches a pass to Jrue Holiday, leading to 3 FT&rsquo;s for Haliburton after a steal the other way. While infrequent watchers of Celtics basketball chalked this up to Tatum &ldquo;choking&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s actually representative of many bad possessions by the Celtics.</p>

<p>You see awkward passing from time-to-time, not just from Tatum but every ballhandler. Hesitant post entry passes, missed cutters, slightly inaccurate passes that give the defense time to close out a shooter, stuff like that. The team has all gotten better at passing, but no one is at the level of elite distributors, let alone someone like Luka.</p>

<p>Final example (sorry, no link): WCF Game 2. Around 3:35 in Q1, Luka gets trapped near the logo by Ant and Gobert. Without hesitation, Luka fake-looks to the left wing and lasers a no-look pass to Lively in the paint. Because the pass gets there so fast and unexpectedly, McDaniels panics and helps from the strong-side corner, leaving Lively an easy pass to a wide open Hardy who hilariously bricks the 3.</p>

<p>I like this example because it&rsquo;s so routine for Luka. We saw plays like this virtually every game from him this year (at least ones I watched), sometimes multiple times. No-look lasers, precise lobs, pinpoint skip passes to the opposite corner, you take these for granted when watching top tier passers like him.</p>

<p>These are not skills that any Celtic has or even approaches. It&rsquo;s not that they lack all-world level passing of someone like Luka, which is obvious. It&rsquo;s that they lack a player with even all-star level passing, someone like prime Rondo or Draymond.</p>

<p><strong>Motion Is Overrated</strong></p>

<p>OK, so the Celtics lack a truly elite passer. So what? This doesn&rsquo;t stop them from running more motion in their offense, right? Yes, but this brings us full circle to Celtics&rsquo; offensive talent.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s review the Celtics offensive talent again. Porzingis has crazy post up efficiency vs. mismatches. Tatum and Brown can get around (or through) almost any defender in the league 1-on-1. Derrick White only needs a sliver of space to launch 3s or drive past someone for his little floater. Jrue has his big boy post-moves.</p>

<p>Assuming we can get a mismatch or attack downhill, that&rsquo;s usually enough for us to get a good look. Adding motion to the offense, especially off-ball actions in conjunction with on-ball actions, leads to more difficult pass-reads and pass-making. This can lead to more turnovers, especially without an elite passer at the helm.</p>

<p>With our embarrassment of talent at shot-making, ending a possession in a passing turnover is a disaster. You&rsquo;d rather them get a look vs a mismatch in iso and see what happens, even if it does end up in a bricked midrange fadeaway.</p>

<p>A missed shot can still draw a shooting foul, a putback, or an offensive rebound. Meanwhile, any turnover ends our chance to score, and a live ball turnover is hard to stop even with our defensive talent.</p>

<p>For these reasons, the Celtics&rsquo; current heavy diet of iso isn&rsquo;t a fluke or a result of Mazzulla being dumber than sports media. It&rsquo;s an intentional core piece of the offense, and it&rsquo;s probably optimal given our current roster.</p>

<hr>

<p>I have more to say about why we&rsquo;re seeing more iso in the playoffs, what other teams have done to slow our iso&rsquo;ing, and how it&rsquo;ll fare against the Mavs in the Finals, but I&rsquo;ll save that for another edition if I have time. This is already getting way too long.</p>

<p>Agree with me? Think I&rsquo;m an idiot? Would love to hear in the comments. I&rsquo;m clearly way too bored.</p>

      <label for="l6zjym2" class="commentText"><p>Live by the 3 die by the 3 is a narrative that is applied to past Celtics teams more than this team. The 3âs this Celtics team takes are quality shots within the offense opened up by dribble drives from jrue, white, brown and Tatum. Itâs why our percentage is near the top of the league. And the more quality 3âs we take, there is actually less variance too.</p>

      <label for="l717xyb" class="commentText"><p>I hear this point all the time. However, Dallas pretty much got the blueprint to beat the Celtics against the Thunder:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>top 5 offense and defense</p></li>

<li><p>best 3pt % in the league</p></li>

<li><p>5-out offense for 38 out of 48 minutes (exception were the 10 Giddey minutes. If Kornet plays for the Celtics, it will be pretty much the same)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>They let Lou Dort hunt Luka for 40 minutes a game on defense and let him shoot wide open 3s on offense. he went from a 39% 3pt shooter to a 31% shooter in the series. Were the lights too bright? was it just a bad stretch? or was Dort gassed?</p>

<p>its going to be interesting if Jrue, White and potentially Brown can still hit their 3s when they have to hunt Luka and Kyrie for 44 minutes a game. Dallas might just copy the OKC game plan.</p>

      <label for="l71brb0" class="commentText"><p>The differences are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>SGA is elite at shot creation but no other players in OKC is really good at that. 3-point shooters are not enough, if you don&rsquo;t have that. Your defensive scheme at that series won&rsquo;t be enough.</p></li>

<li><p>OKC defence has always been taking away the driving lanes with a lots of help from the corners. Even I have been saying that PJ will feast and be the x factor from game 1 in that series (pick Dallas as the winner in my bracket) in game threads here. While we use that corner help too with drop like every other team, that is not all of our arsenal.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That being said, we will have to better against p&amp;r and sets around the horn, while you will have to deal with a more complicated offense than your previous opponents with chin sets, pin down p&amp;r&rsquo;s and so on. Just as people overlook at your defensive progression and scheme for last four months, they are overlooking all those actions for Boston by simplifying our offense &ldquo;drive and kick&rdquo;, &ldquo;5 out&rdquo; etc. That will be fun and all the fans on both sides thinking that they are going against a simple opponent they figured out will be really surprised.</p>

<p>OKC were a top 5 team in offense and defense but they weren&rsquo;t on the Celtics level, the Celtics are bigger, longer and have more optionality on offense they use the post more than most teams in the league.</p>

<p>So Celtics media and Bill Simmons should stop crying for lack of credit. Showing stats from these super-easy, injury-lucky series is just weak. These are empty calories. Bad team good stats guy doesnt count so easy matchups good stats also doesnt count.</p>

<p>Just be happy with Finals/Title but not ask some credit like if Celtics beat any decent team yet.</p>

      <label for="l6zs1s7" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve seen less of the wildly open 3s in the playoffs though because teams are playing more disciplined defense.</p>

<p>Against Miami and Cleveland, it felt like nothing was truly open that often because they helped late and stayed at home mostly with the shooters. Even when they rotated, they prioritized running people off the line instead of protecting the paint.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t stop us, but it prevents getting run out of the gym like you&rsquo;d see so many times in the reg season.</p>

<p>Pacers, they just sucked it up sometimes like in the Tatum example. They scored enough to make up for it though.</p>

      <label for="l7170x2" class="commentText"><p>Is it really different? Giddey played 10 min. For the other 38 min it was Joe and Dort, who both are very good 3 pt shooters (39% and 41% on 6.5 and 4.5 attempts). On paper, all 5 players from okc could hit the 3 for 38 out of 48 minutes. they just didnt. Three possible explanations:</p>

<ul>
<li>the lights were too bright</li>
<li>the Mavs defense was extremely good</li>
<li>Lou Dort was gassed on offense bc he had to chase Luka the entire game</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe it was a combination of all of thatâ¦how good will the shotmaking of Jrue, Brown and White be after chasing Luka and Kyrie on defense for 44 minutes? Will their 3% go down like the one from Lou Dort?</p>

      <label for="l717awe" class="commentText"><p>agree but yeah, experience plays in this kind of scenario and jrue &amp; white is more experienced than dort joe and all other okc players. which is why this doesnt look different on paper, but itll be different for sure. i dunno but i think this series will depend on can our role players make their own plays against boston. cause luka and kai will get theirs but can djj make his drives, or can pj make his 3s or make passess? because i dont know, i feel thay our role players should be able to match Cs role players</p>

      <label for="l72c046" class="commentText"><p>Giddey played 12 mins&hellip;.the games were so close, 12 mins of an inefficient offense is all it takes to lose&hellip;.heck 5 mins of an inefficient offense is all it takes.</p>

<p>Chet was 22% from 3, Mavs could sag off Chet. Shai doesn&rsquo;t take much attempts at 3 either.</p>

<p>Celtics starting 5 takes a lot more 3s than OKC. For example in the pacers series White took 8.3 attempts, holiday 6, Tatum 9, Jaylen 6.8, Horford 7. That&rsquo;s 37.1 by just their starters. Add in Porzingus + bench.</p>

<p>Regarding Celtics players how good they will be on offense after chasing Kyrie and Luka&hellip;.Fortunately Celtics have 4 guys that they will be comfortable guarding those 2. Having the work load split against 4 guys should be fine. How good will Kyrie and Luka be on offense when all 5 guys target Luka and Kyrie on defense? Celtics repeatedly went at Haliburton&hellip;same will occur with Kyrie and Luka. OP highlighted here, Celtics like to ISO, they wont want to ISO against PJ, DJJ or Lively, it will be Luka and Kyrie from start to finish.</p>

      <label for="l72n0ji" class="commentText"><p>So first of all: The Celtics are the best team the Mavericks will face and the clear favorites. I dont deny that.</p>

<p>But the Mavericks have beaten the 3rd and 5th best offenses in the history of the NBA and held them 8.5 points &amp; 6 points below their ORtg.</p>

<p>A player like Chet (or Dort, or KAT, or PG or Edwards or JDub), who normally shoots 37% from 3, doesnt just randomly start missing shots against the Mavericks. The Mavericks just play extremely well on defense and make them miss shots. Mavs defense has been one of the best, if not the best defense in the league for the past 3 months.</p>

<p>Dont just take it as given that the Celtics will get the same looks and same % from 3 against this Mavericks D.</p>

<p>And saying you got 4 guys who feel comfortable guarding Luka is straight up wrong. They are all good defenders, not denying that, but thats not enough against Luka. I dont see the Ben Simmons or Lou Dort type of player, who at least manages to pose some problems to Luka. White and Jrue are too small. Brown and Tatum need to carry an offensive load, so Mazzulla will try to keep them away from Luka as long as possible. If the Celtics intend on giving Luka every switch he is looking for, this is going to be a disaster for them. By game 2, Brown will be on Luka 85% of the time.</p>

<p>Lastly, you want to chase Luka and Kyrie? well, be my guest. That was the Clippers&rsquo; plan too. They hunted Luka and Kyrie. At some point they just had to give up, bc their offense became extremely stagnant and they had one bad shot very late in the shot clock after another. And even if you get the switch and are able to get past Luka, the best rim protecting front court in the NBA is going to meet you right under the basket. Clippers gave up the flow of their offense bc they desperately tried to wear down Luka (and Kyrie). It did not work at all.</p>

<p>look up Luka and Kyrie and their iso defense in regular season and playoffs:</p>

      <label for="l72vrab" class="commentText"><p>Note, to make it clear I think Mavericks are a great team and worthy competitor. I think Celtics should still be favorites, something like 55% to mavs 45%.</p>

<p>Which teams are you referring to being the 3rd and 5th best offense? I know OKC was 3rd this year&hellip;.clippers 12th, wolves 18th.</p>

<p>Chet shot 25% and 21% on wide open 3 point shot and open 3 point shots respectively.</p>

<p>Giddey shot 20% on wide open 3 and 0% on open 3 point shots.</p>

<p>Jalen williams 29% on open 3s<br>
Dort 32% on open 3s.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shots-closest-defender?TeamID=1610612760&amp;PORound=2&amp;CloseDefDistRange=4-6+Feet+-+Open" target="_blank">https://www.nba.com/stats/players/shots-closest-defender?TeamID=1610612760&amp;PORound=2&amp;CloseDefDistRange=4-6+Feet+-+Open</a></p>

<p>For context, none of celtics players are under 40% for wide open 3s in the pacers series.</p>

<p>As you can see above, these are open to wide open 3s that some OKC players were missing.</p>

<p>Regarding the 4 players that can defend Luka and Kyrie&hellip;its not that I mean they can each stop both or even slow them down, but Celtics will live with White / Jrue defending Luka 1-1.</p>

<p>The ppp for luka and kyrie defending in iso is great, but I think its partly because of Lively on the backline defending the paint. Teams can&rsquo;t blow by Luka and Kyrie and expect to go to the rim, hence a big reason for the low ppp stat. However, if Lively wants to hang out by the rim, that means a Celtic player will be wide open in the corner, so do you choose lively defending the paint or wide open corner 3s?</p>

      <label for="l750mur" class="commentText"><p>this is what some mavs fans do not understand. perimeter defense was effective because the strategy is to funnel the drive to the big man. but this wont work against the celtics because it&rsquo;s either there is no big under the basket or if there is a big, a shooter would be wide open. this really would come down to if luka and kyrie can hold their own in the perimeter while still being able to make shots at a high level. but maybe jkidd and staff has something thay us fans do not know so we&rsquo;ll see.</p>

      <label for="l72hgdm" class="commentText"><p>Their defensive rating is exactly the same in the playoffs at 111.1 so Iâm not sure how Dallas is easily better, plus we are mostly focusing on 3 point defense because thatâs how you beat the Celtics and the Cavs are better in the playoffs in both 3PA and 3P%. In the second half of the regular season, sure, but thatâs a niche cut off to then not include the playoffs. If you want to argue difficulty of opponent for the defensive numbers then Cleveland had to face the Celtics who are 2nd in offensive rating whereas Clippers, OKC and Minnesota were 11th, 8th and 7th. I think youâre severely underrating the Cavs defenseÂ </p>

<p>Like I said, Dallas has an amazing defense. Iâm not denying that since the trade deadline theyâve been incredible defensively, ranked 1st or whatever it is, but their defense is not designed to take away the 3. Theyâre 6th in 3PA and 9th in opponent 3P% in the playoffs and in the regular season they were 18th for both 3PA and %</p>

<p>Minnesota is a good team because of their defense. Their offense is average to above average at best and relies heavily on Ant taking over. Clippers are dogshit without Kawhi, especially on offense because heâs their main playmaker and scorer. OKC are good offensively but theyâre young and inexperienced but yes I will give you them even if their offensive rating in the playoffs was middle-of-the packÂ </p>

<p>We are just going to go around in circles. Iâve said twice now I think Dallas has a good defense but youâre just getting mad and canât just agree their defense isnât designed to stop 3 point shootingÂ </p>

After a loss, people think they should change absolutely everything about their scheme and go back to the drawing board.</p>

<p>Some nights it works, some nights it doesn&rsquo;t, but <strong>overall</strong> it works much more than it doesn&rsquo;t, and that&rsquo;s why they had the best record in the NBA. Stick to the plan and recognize that every series won&rsquo;t be a sweep.</p>

      <label for="l6zwkv6" class="commentText"><p>Don&rsquo;t think the problem is the ISO</p>

<p>I think the problem is that some possessions nobody touches the ball EXCEPT the person ISOing</p>

<p>ISO works better when you ISO after a bunch of passes because then your team stays engaged and the opponent has to predict where the ISO comes from, whilst maintaining good positioning</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mind ISO</p>

<p>I mind constant Tatum almost-8-second-violation into pounding the ball for 8 more seconds before going ISO</p>

<p>The one thing he struggles with is being too patient. Brown can usually get to the rim or a midrange and make it a lot because heâs very deliberate about his spots. It seems like Tatum is always waiting for something to open up and sometimes it doesnât. I feel like he needs a tiny bit more direction, which is why itâs good Boston doesnât have to have him as <strong>primary primary</strong> ball handler all the time.</p>

<p>I love Tatum but they need to help him out with actual playmaking. The Mavs literally run everything through PnR and let Luka or Kyrie make the reads. Itâs the definition of a simple offense. The issue with the Celtics isnât complexity, itâs just playmaking. No one ever rolls to the rim on that team.</p>

I completely agree with your point that a lot of the dialogue about Boston&rsquo;s offense is pretty unsophisticated, even from people like Zach Lowe.  Its the best in the league, yet it gets stagnant?  They kind of stop there instead of going into the &ldquo;why&rdquo; or &ldquo;how.&rdquo;  And in any event it seems like it would be difficult for both of those things to be true, so you figured out why it might <em>look</em> like it stagnates.</p>

      <label for="l70oky9" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a solid take.   As a cetlics fans, we see a team full of very good passers but technically very good passer isn&rsquo;t elite so it makes sense to not pass too much and risk a TO.</p>

<p>The reality is 5 starters that can create their own shot means you don&rsquo;t need to risk it, and most teams don&rsquo;t have 5 starters creating their own shots.  it&rsquo;s a very unusual comp.</p>

<p>Injured CLE was a good example of a team where some guys need a pass as they can&rsquo;t create.   Dallas is weird because they have 2 elite creators who are S tier at shot creation or passing.  They have players who absolutely need a pass but Luka is so elite at that skill that the turnover risk is low.</p>

      <label for="l70w0jx" class="commentText"><p>I thought this all season. When they play other teams they typically have 6 of the best 8 or 9 players in the game. Get the ball to the guy being guarded by number 11. Occasionally run action to get that 11th on the number 1-4 best player in the game.  Sometimes with bench you have the best player being guarded by the 13th or 14th.</p>

<p>I think Dallas is going to find out that Porzingis is a very different offensive threat than Gobert (and White is very different than McDaniels). Gobert was good overall in that series but he just can&rsquo;t punish mismatches very well. Kristaps is very good at that, I don&rsquo;t think Luka can guard him.</p>

Maybe you trap them on screens idk, but if they keep to the middle of the floor it&rsquo;ll be hard to do. If Boston can make their corner threes Porzingis might be a weak link tactically.</p>

      <label for="l6zvv63" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t have an issue with us isolating against mismatches. I think the only criticism of our offense that actually makes sense is the tempo thingâ it doesn&rsquo;t happen as much as some people seem to think it does, but it <em>is</em> really frustrating when we burn 10 seconds off the shot clock before even starting our first action, or decide to dump it off to Tatum for a pullup with over 10 seconds left on the clock. And to be clear, this isn&rsquo;t a Tatum thing, it&rsquo;s a general team offense thing. They can&rsquo;t be doing that shit against Dallas.</p>

      <label for="l72aqtf" class="commentText"><p>Yeah but the thing with resting on offense to let your team catch their breath (by just having one guy dribble waiting for 5-10 seconds left to start an offense), is that it lets their defense rest too. Also the Celtics tend to only do this under specific circumstances; ends of quarters (where everyone will shortly get a break) to get final shot or setup a 2 for 1, or ends of game with a double digit lead.  I like the goal, but I feel they should be going for the goal in the course of their offense.</p>

      <label for="l6zpnx0" class="commentText"><p>I generally agree with your points on their offense. The one thing that I might disagree on is &lsquo;Celtics don&rsquo;t have an elite passer&rsquo;. Most teams don&rsquo;t have one either. Most teams just need a decent/above average passers. I think the better thing to say might be their talent is slower at reading passing lanes so they keep things simple and not rely on motion offense. They focus more on making a correct read with their iso offense which is simple and safe rather than making a fast read to accelerate their passing offense which is more prone to turnovers.</p>

<p>This is why this Celtics team stumps everyone a little. With their talent, people look and believe they should be able to make fast reads. I have the Celtics winning the Finals, but I can easily see this being a sweep or seven games. Their variance is just that high to me.</p>

<p>For the Mavs, I imagine most people will say 6-7 games just due to a more grind it out play style. If Mavs win in less games, it will be due to variance of the Celtics IMO.</p>

<p>Which current contending teams don&rsquo;t have a top tier passer though? Maybe I&rsquo;m missing someone, I only thought of the Timberwolves, and I think they felt that loss in the Dallas series because they couldn&rsquo;t generate offense, especially if Conley was out.</p>

      <label for="l70v1bf" class="commentText"><p>If you are looking at just the conference finals this year, then yes. Only the Timberwolves. However, not every team makes it to the conference finals, so you have to look at the playoffs teams as a whole. Some examples of teams that could have contended with no elite passer, but flamed out due to other reasons:</p>

<p>Sixers: Embiid/Maxey - good passers. Health issues.</p>

<p>Bucks: Dame/Giannis - Similar to Sixers.</p>

<p>Thunder: Shai - good passer. Lack of team experience IMO.</p>

<p>Suns: Booker/Durant/Beal - average passers at best. Depth and defense issues.</p>

<p>Warriors: Draymond is questionable at elite if anything makes really good reads. Depth issues.</p>

<p>Knicks: Brunson is average at best; More team passing; Injury issues.</p>

<p>Heat: Butler is great playmaker. Injury issues.</p>

<p>Overall, there are only a handful of elite passers in the league. Not every team has one. A lot of teams get by with top tier playmakers which is a difference group from elite passers. Celtics are a contender with no top tier passer, but above average playmakers in Tatum, White, Jrue, and Horford.</p>

      <label for="l703xcw" class="commentText"><p>I think the 2013-14 San Antonio Spurs and to a lesser extent the prime Steph Curry Warriors warped the perception of how offense should be played and thereby made iso heavy offences seem undesirable by extension. There&rsquo;s a weird disconnect where analysts can understand the reasoning behind shooting more 3s but then can&rsquo;t extend that logic to iso-ing.</p>

      <label for="l70a8xe" class="commentText"><p>Your motion is overrated is a point that so many people miss. People act like 5 people cutting, moving, filling, spaces, stretching out is supposed to be going on every play and easy to execute. But that can lead to overcomplication and more mistakes. Its also can get blown up if the defense reads it already. It also tires everyone out. A point no one talks about is no matter how creative the coach is, the players either have to be really smart and in synch or have a specific role ingrained in them. I dont think 60% of the NBA can fit that category. Being able to create from mismatches is a key factor to every offense and sometimes if your talent suits it, thatâs all you need plus spacing. The answer is obviously to mix it up which a lot of coaches do.</p>

      <label for="l70d3jy" class="commentText"><p>Easily the most overlooked part of Mazzulla. Celtics were disastrous offensively with their turnovers during their finals run of 2 years ago. Mazzulla took over the next year on last minute notice and although he clearly was unprepared and had issues, one of the things he clearly fixed was turnovers. Now the team is one of the least turnover prone teams in the entire NBA.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not as pretty, but people often mistake motion for plays. You can create action out mismatches that lead to easy shots, that&rsquo;s exactly what the Celtics do.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>An underrated part of their success this year. Even the worst shot is better than a turnover, and if you have the option of 3 god-awful shots per game vs. 3 more turnovers per game, you always take the first one. Plus turnovers (esp live ball ones) lead to points the other way.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know where the exact balance is of &ldquo;no turnovers&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;finding the best shot&rdquo; but I bet it&rsquo;s something the Celtics org has done some research into</p>

      <label for="l700iah" class="commentText"><p>I think the cornerstone of the Celtics offense (like many) is the PnR. Often that turns into isolation certainly, but often it leads to a pop 3 pointer for the screener, a rim run dunk for KP or Kornet, or a kick out on the drive. So I don&rsquo;t think its purely isolation, but sometimes as an option/call (often last one) we iso.</p>

<p>Mazzulla seems most happy when we generate open 3s and move the ball around. That comes from drive and kick most often, but it isn&rsquo;t always a drive from belabored isolation, more just a drive off the PnR.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think we pound the ball as much as a Luka does. I don&rsquo;t often see us dribbling the ball for 16 seconds straight before a drive.</p>

      <label for="l72qnck" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I didn&rsquo;t get into this in detail for length reasons (was already writing War and Peace over here&hellip;), but iso is not the ONLY thing we do. We do have designed actions and other options as you said, and we&rsquo;re not heliocentric like the Mavs bc we got 4-5 people who initiate these actions (Tatum, Brown, White, PP, Jrue sometimes).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just that the end result ends up being more iso in the playoffs because our players have the greenlight to do so. Playoff defenses also shut off the &ldquo;default options&rdquo; more frequently. The wide open 3 you saw from Horford is a rare sight in the playoffs, but we got shots like that all the time in the reg season.</p>

<p>In any case, I doubt Mazzulla is berating them on the sidelines for not running another action and iso&rsquo;ing instead. I feel like he trusts them to make a call and sees enough value generated in iso possessions that he doesn&rsquo;t stomp them out  completely as a coach.</p>

      <label for="l702ic8" class="commentText"><p>One major problem with your theory is that nobody on the Celtics is great at isolating. Tatum&rsquo;s roughly the 20th best in the league, Brown is closer to 80th, Porzingus gets so few isos and doesn&rsquo;t score well on them. (This is eyeballing the iso stats, I count 16ish guys on high volume with better ppp than Tatum this year, and some guys who are probably better had down years (Durant), Brown is so far down I stopped counting)</p>

<p>Their team isolation stats seem to be buoyed by elite spacing and the lack of truly poor iso-players&hellip; Such as rookies exploring the studio space (Banchero/Barnes/Cade) tank commanders (Poole/Kuzma), unaware vets (WB, Beal, Randle), bad bench gunners (big gov&rsquo;t).</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re not actually beating their man one-on-one at an elite level. Especially considering that Tatum has the highest iso frequency in the league and Brown is in the top 40.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is Mazulla&rsquo;s plan. They&rsquo;ve had this criticism the last 6-7 years (never being below 9th in iso frequency). The Jays just seem to default to isolation.</p>

<p>While they aren&rsquo;t a bad iso team, they&rsquo;re just so much better when they don&rsquo;t do it, dropping 3-4 isos per game would make their offense even more dominant.</p>

      <label for="l7070lq" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s too frequent to be not intentional. Do those stats include the PPP for the entire team or just efficiency for the person for the iso possession? If it&rsquo;s just for the person, it might miss the knock on effects of shooting these shots and getting the putback/rebound as well.</p>

<p>The stats also don&rsquo;t necessarily measure beating their man, just what they score, right? The open 3s we get usually come off these drives, so I&rsquo;d guess you&rsquo;d have to factor that as well. Saying that Tatum isn&rsquo;t getting past his initial defender seems an incorrect statement because that&rsquo;s literally the engine of our offense and how we generated a lot of our 3s in the first place.</p>

      <label for="l70opa7" class="commentText"><p>I really don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s intentional.</p>

<p>It definitely doesn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;s there to open up putbacks. Their offensive rebound rate (even adjusted for their awesome shooting numbers) is middle of the road. A Tatum/Brown iso on a mismatch doesn&rsquo;t provide a numbers edge on the glass.</p>

<p>This is nitpicking that I&rsquo;m doing. Boston would have a better offense if they eliminated 3-5 isos per game (rank 15-20 rather than #4). Ultimately, we&rsquo;re arguing over 4% of Boston&rsquo;s possessions, their offense is unbelievable. It&rsquo;s so good that we criticize a good play because it&rsquo;s not a great play.</p>

<p>Mazzulla, the Js, Porzingus, the whole team deserve tons of credit.</p>

<p>Mazzulla can be criticized; he definitely gets more than his fair share. he has a great offensive system, the guys have bought in (even guys accepting smaller roles than they could probably expect). He&rsquo;s done a great job.</p>

      <label for="l706g0g" class="commentText"><p>Appreciate the effort and thereâs definitely something there. But thereâs a difference between iso-ing and stagnating. Celtics wonât play well if they walk the ball up, clear out the wing and watch Tatum go to work. They still benefit from swinging the ball and movement. That gets the defense to think and react, and then when an iso happens, thereâs flow and rhythm to it. And the criticism is that they spend too much time stagnant. Thatâs probably an eye test thing though because as noted they had the best offense in the league. The stagnant stretches stand out because otherwise the offense looks great â and to your point they still have elite scorers who can make up for a bad possession. They donât need elite passing to literally just pass the ball or execute a drive-and-kick, and they do those things plenty.</p>

<p>However, prime Rondo was absolutely an otherworldly passer who made passes every single game that made you gasp.</p>

      <label for="l7098ti" class="commentText"><p>Well it really depends on what your definition of iso is. My definition is that, even if you go through a series of PnR&rsquo;s, if the end result is just one guy squaring up another guy and trying to beat him 1-on-1, that&rsquo;s effectively iso.</p>

<p>This is different from having an offense based on lots of cuts, Curry-style offball actions to free up a shooter, etc.</p>

<p>I also think you&rsquo;re just disagreeing with me straight up with the stagnant point lol (which is fine). I think the &ldquo;stagnant&rdquo; possessions are the point, whereas you think it&rsquo;s a problem for players&rsquo; flow. Agree to disagree I guess.</p>

<p>I will say that, beyond keeping iso&rsquo;s around, pushing the pace has been an obvious point of emphasis from Mazzulla. I see this as getting a good possession without needing to fall into our basic PnR iso ball.</p>

      <label for="l70bqp8" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I do think some ball movement is a nice lubricant for offense even if the passes arenât home runs. But I donât contest the point that we have plenty of guys who will have an advantage against an individual defender at any given moment, and that means we donât need âthe beautiful offenseâ to score. I also think it can be a trap when guys try to spam the mismatch over and over - I think a drive and kick or pick n roll produces more reliable results. When you do have scorers and shooters at every position you need to move the rock to open up lanes.</p>

<p>But shit man I donât wanna be overly critical I think itâs a good point and more broadly the idea that there are many ways to succeed and the best teams will play their strengths and personnel.</p>

      <label for="l70f2f2" class="commentText"><p>Tldr: Boston donât have elite passers hence they only play PnR and iso ball. Motion offense is overrated.</p>

<p>Not sure if I agree completely as OP defined âelite passerâ as Luka and Jokic. I mean there are only two of these in the whole worldâ¦ if the answer is you need two of them to play motion offense, is a kind of a big stretch. What is true though is that Boston does lack playmakers in their rotation. Jrue is not your typical PG who directs the offense. They have a lot of secondary playmakers who can initiate offense but donât have any primary typical PG.</p>

<p>This has to be a deliberate decision by the Celtics as this was critiqued for several playoff runs when Smart had to create opportunities for the team.</p>

<p>I also differ in OPs analysis of motion offense being overrated and heavy iso play being preferable in the playoffs. A heavy motion offense like GSW tend to be TO heavy giving opponents the opportunity for fast breaks and early offense. But you donât have to play such a one sided offense but a balanced one. I mean even iso heavy offenses need to get the defense into scramble mode, as with great defenses they wonât let you play 1on1 but giving different looks every time down the floor and with help side waiting at the rim. And here comes the crux in Bostons offense, when out of sync the offense resembles a headless chicken where nobody knows what to do, as there is nobody (last seasons) to calm down the offense and reset it, do some set plays to get everyone going.</p>

<p>This year in the playoffs there was also resemblances of the past with inexplicable dry spells. The difference to past years is the experience of the core team in clutch situations and letâs face it the lack of true adversaries. We wonât know if Boston changed and learned from the last seasons until the final starts and they face an elite defensive team in Dallas. On paper both of the teams match rather well with each other. Letâs hope for a long and exciting series!</p>

      <label for="l71k6gz" class="commentText"><p>I agree they get into an ISO heavy offense to reduce turnovers. The problem with these possessions with limited motion is theyâre making it way too easy for defenders and letting them conserve their energy to explode on offense. I suppose this goes both ways - the Celtics are conserving energy on offense to out hustle opponents on defense.</p>

      <label for="l72p71b" class="commentText"><p>Interesting point, but Tatum and Brown have weaknesses as 1 on 1 players that other playoff teams have dialed in on.</p>

<p>Brown has issues with ball security and gets tunnel vision on drives, especially in late game situations when the chips are down and the offense is struggling. Tatum doesn&rsquo;t have a great first step and doesn&rsquo;t have the technique or deceleration that a Harden or Luka has to make up for it, so he can get stonewalled. I remember him trying and failing to get by TJ McConnell a couple of times during the last round, and Strus gave him issues. Both of them are prone to turning the ball over on bad passes and settling for contested shots when the game is close. Matter of fact, I think Tatum&rsquo;s deficiencies and inconsistency as a scorer in 1v1s is what separates him from being in that top tier of players right now.</p>

      <label for="l72svjr" class="commentText"><p>While Brown has sucked in these moments in the past, it haven&rsquo;t been true for this playoffs so far. Tatum has had his brain farts too. I agree that he lacks the decel and body control to be truly unstoppable at the rim. Even so, I believe he still roasts defenders at a high enough rate to justify making it a core part of the offense.</p>

<p>Tatum&rsquo;s personal numbers are middling in iso, but I&rsquo;d love to see what the team PPP are when he drives. It&rsquo;s probably pretty high. That&rsquo;s just my guess though.</p>

      <label for="l7095er" class="commentText"><p>I agree that our offense should have a lot of iso given our players, but I think youâre underrating our playmakers. We donât have a Luka or Jokic passer, but I wouldnât say our passing is actually weak. Itâs more so that they have multiple players who are elite at punishing mismatches, so they mismatch hunt- you play to your teams strengths.</p>

<p>White is straight up known for being a great decision maker. Itâs his whole thing, he VERY rarely makes mistakes, and when he does itâs one of those random games where he gets all of them out of the way at once lol.</p>

<p>Jrue is a very skilled passer and has run point his whole career at a near all star to all star level, and won a ring at the position. He and White have thrown a LOT of entry passes to Tatum, Brown, and Porzingis this year with very few mistakes.</p>

<p>Tatum is a good enough passer to run offense through. He routinely makes skip passes, uses his height to hit tough angles, and is excellent at passing out of doubles- doubling him is almost always positive for the Celtics. Heâs averaging 5.9 assists and a 2.44 assist to turnover ratio this playoffs, which is actually <em>better</em> than Lukaâs 2.39 (yes, lower usage and totals, Iâm not saying heâs a better playmaker lol).</p>

<p>And we havenât seen this because heâs been out, but the Celtics do utilize KP in the high post to run motion-type stuff at times- usually for a Brown cut. Their chemistry is great and leads to some great plays, as Porzingis is a very underrated passer. The offense as a whole is much more dynamic with him due to his pop/roll abilities being way better than any other big.</p>

<p>Ultimately though, we are saying the same thing, which is that the playstyle is based on personnel. The Celtics run a scheme that fits their players, and would not be better off running plays that work because of guys like Jokic, Luka, or Curry. Wow that was way too long.</p>

      <label for="l72merz" class="commentText"><p>Something that I couldn&rsquo;t talk much about in my post was all the other stuff we do besides iso&rsquo;s. There&rsquo;s a decent amount of that too.</p>

<p>If I were to guess, we get like <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> split of designed actions like horns, another <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of transition tempo pushes based off misses or turnovers, and a final <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of mismatch finding iso ball.</p>

<p>Tatum and Co run the designed actions well and they get lots of mileage in easy passes from the transition too.</p>

<p>Beyond that, I actually think stats overstate how good this team is at passing. We got lots of assists and no TO&rsquo;s because we get people wide open with our spacing.</p>

<p>Our ballhandlers don&rsquo;t thread the needle well, but they usually don&rsquo;t have to given our spacing. Passes like to the post vs a fronting defender or between defenders to a cutter. You do see skip passes from time to time, but they&rsquo;re often not &ldquo;in the pocket&rdquo; or mistimed.</p>

      <label for="l70gnj7" class="commentText"><p>You don&rsquo;t need an elite passer to play motion offense. The Spurs this year play motion offense and they&rsquo;re one of the teams with a high assist rate. If those bums could actually make a shot after the ball swings around and generates an open look, their offense wouldn&rsquo;t be hot garbage.</p>

<p>But the Celtics actually do have shot makers the defense have to respect. They&rsquo;d be much deadlier if they moved the ball around more. If Pop can make a bunch of g-leaguers play motion offense, Joe should be able to get players who are ten times more talented to do the same, especially since they&rsquo;re not gonna need too many passes to generate a good shot because they&rsquo;re so talented they don&rsquo;t need a super wide open look.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with iso, but it is essentially putting all your eggs in one basket. Not in the sense of scoring, but in the sense of breaking down an entire defense. Every good offense can get a ballhandler into the paint. Not only are you dealing with the high variance that comes with shooting so many 3s, now you&rsquo;re also banking on one person to get a paint-touch on isolations just so you could lure the help defender in and get that open 3-point shot. And that&rsquo;s if the iso scorer doesn&rsquo;t just settle for the 3.</p>

<p>This is true, but it&rsquo;s also important that he can draw the opposing C out to an uncomfortable spot on the floor, which makes the &ldquo;dribble-drive -</p>

<p>Al is a 3-point threat, but KP stretching the floor out to 26 feet really bends the opposing defense to the breaking point, and the Celtics love to put him in every P&amp;R action because he can take a small guy either to the post or out to the 3 point line.</p>

<p>If he&rsquo;s not fit in this series, the Celtics are going to have a much harder time with their offense.</p>

If they have âgood passersâ then they shouldnât have to run iso ball to create shots. They can still run motion offense and get good shots with multiple âgood passersâ.</p>

<p>I would agree with the premise if you arguing that their passers are below average (only âgoodâ passer imo is maybe Jrue).</p>

<p>Either way, iso ball ainât the solution lmao. Regardless of why you got here, itâs either poor team construction or poor game planning.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m super curious about the finals. Kyrie and Luka are some of the best ISO scorers in the game, and I&rsquo;m curious how the rest of the team matches up for the first 40 minutes of the game.</p>

      <label for="l7396k3" class="commentText"><p>Nice post.</p>

<p>The Celtics iso looks a lot like LeBron ball where you get the matchup you want and then LeBron cooks.</p>

<p>The difference, to your point, is LeBron was a perfect playmaker out of this whereas Tatum is just good.</p>

<p>However the Celtics secondary playmaking is elite (Jrue and Derrick White would be starting point guards on almost every team in the league, Boston can play them both because they are spectacular defenders) - which makes up for a lot of the gap.</p>

<p>Thatâs why the regular, non-iso pick and roll offense is so good â they are just stacked (which isnât that interesting for a pundit to say but probably all that needs to be said - though now Iâm going to say more).</p>

<p>One benefit of iso ball if itâs efficient enough is it really helps with transition defense too because thereâs floor balance with all the players spaced out on the perimeter matched up with their man.</p>

<p>The other added benefit when you have a star going iso is that you usually get the benefit of the doubt on calls - not only do you get to go to the line, but then the other team has to play in the half court the next possession.</p>

<p>This is why having the best iso player in the league and surrounding them with good half court defenders is such a good formula â it takes a super team like the old spurs or Warriors or maybe these Celtics to beat it.</p>

<p>When you donât play iso or the other team blitzes the pick and roll, the blitzers can run out after the quick shot goes up and you get easy transition buckets if you miss.</p>

<p>If you donât trust your half court offense (usually because youâre less talented) you want to speed up the game by blitzing/ doubling.  You will give up way more points but you can maybe get them back.  Itâs about the only chance you have if youâre outmatched.</p>

<p>The Pacers did a lot of this (really all year) and it worked out fine until the ends of games when they (like most teams) get stiff and play iso.</p>

<p>Ironically, because the Pacers were up most of the games they played even slower at the end and the Celtics had to play fast and we all know what happened.</p>

<p>Dallas almost always has four long defenders on the floor (as opposed to Indiana or Cleveland that had very undersized guards).</p>

<p>Itâll be a lot harder for Jrue or White to get pesky offensive boards and there should be way less space for secondary playmaking.</p>

<p>I think the Mavs trust their half court offense and will be happy to leave Gafford or Kyrie on an island (especially at home).</p>

<p>The Celtics probably want to play fast and attack through Brown when they can and maybe wear Luka out.</p>

      <label for="l70c4vm" class="commentText"><p>Yeah well, my issue is that the Celtics haven&rsquo;t been tested in this playoffs due to every team losing their main player when they play them. Is that the Celtics fault? no. Does it matter in terms of assessing their quality in terms of playoff games? Yes.</p>

<p>They haven&rsquo;t faced someone of Luka&rsquo;s caliber yet this year. The last time they did, they lost the finals (Curry). So it&rsquo;s really hard to say they will create a mismatch because Dallas only has one actual short person (Kyrie) in the starting lineup. Derick Lively/Gafford has been pretty good in the post. It&rsquo;s easy to have good post effiecney when the best center you have faced in the whole playoffs is one Bam (Who is great but undersized). The constant changing of centers for Dallas allows them to be more powerful and well-rested. Once KP sits who is going to take their place? KP doesn&rsquo;t play all 48 minutes.</p>

<p>Their offense works in the sense they find a short guard and pick on him the whole game. I don&rsquo;t think Kyrie would be getting mismatched in most situations because that isn&rsquo;t his position. Also by the way? you are right. The ISO-heavy game is a feature of your offense. As it has always been from a wing-dominated lineup (look up at KD&rsquo;s team). Usually, when the best player is a wing player they are ISO heavy. This has its benefits, but also has negatives because you end up not having great passers. Which can hurt you in pick and rolls and slashing offense. OR just when the ISO isn&rsquo;t working. You can&rsquo;t really have a plan B.</p>

<p>The ISO-heavy play works when the other team doesn&rsquo;t have a player (or in this case two) that can do the same on the other end. We know KP isn&rsquo;t that high level of a defender how do we know the Mavs can&rsquo;t put him in the same pick-and-roll situation and do the same Timberwolves situation?</p>

<p>Also, I feel the Celtics issue has never really been their offense and defense. It has been mental fortitude and coaching adjustment. Their players don&rsquo;t have that &lsquo;dawg&rsquo; in them, where they can single-handedly take a game over like Curry, Jokic or Luka does.</p>

      <label for="l6zrnon" class="commentText"><p>I mean, it tends to work until it doesn&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;ve shown a remarkable ability to flounder in the waning minutes of games, taking bad shots, and a general failure to generate any cohesive offense.</p>

<p>We haven&rsquo;t really been tested at all yet this playoffs, so it&rsquo;s really TBD, imo. I genuinely do think Mazzoula is a horrible coach when it comes to Xs and Os.</p>
