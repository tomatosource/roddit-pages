</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><strong>Tl;dr</strong>: The Celtics iso all the time because they&rsquo;re elite at making shots, but not as good at passing. It&rsquo;s an intentional strategy.</p>

<hr>

<p>I&rsquo;ve long since run out of new basketball content to consume waiting for the Finals, so I wanted to be part of the solution. Strap in for a way-too-long post because I am very bored.</p>

<p>Hopefully it&rsquo;s informative for people who haven&rsquo;t watched much Celtics basketball this year or are wondering why the hell we iso so much.</p>

<p><strong>Is Mazzulla An Idiot?</strong></p>

<p>A common talking point in the media and even with relatively sophisticated analysts like Zach Lowe and Ben Taylor is that Boston&rsquo;s offense &ldquo;stagnates&rdquo; and iso&rsquo;s too much. Against a set defense, the Celtics usually do a series of PnR&rsquo;s to find a favorable matchup. Then, the ballhandler tries to beat the (hopefully) mismatched or out-of-position defender 1-on-1 with the rest of the team standing around.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll see this a million times in any Celtics game, and it has even increased (at least by my eye test) in the playoffs. This state of affairs confuses people because the side effect is often an all-NBA guy like Tatum standing in the corner and doing nothing.</p>

<p>Is this a waste of talent? Is Mazzulla an idiot?</p>

<p>Given that Mazzulla and his staff get paid millions of dollars to scheme for the Celtics (not to mention GM Brad and his X&rsquo;s-and-O&rsquo;s genius), it&rsquo;s safer to assume that the media is missing something instead of them. After watching a ton of Celtics basketball this season, I&rsquo;d like to share my pet theory: Celtics are covering for their lack of passing talent, their only real offensive weakness.</p>

<p><strong>The One Offensive Weakness</strong></p>

<p>By the numbers, the Celtics technically were the best offense of all-time this year. We all know they have an 8-player rotation of shooters. They also have a surplus of individual shot creators. Tatum, Brown, and Porzingis all iso score at great-to-elite levels. White, Jrue, and Pritchard can make stuff happen off the dribble as secondary creators as well.</p>

<p>All this stuff is non-controversial, so I won&rsquo;t belabor the point.</p>

<p>However, while all these players have really good scoring ability and are GOOD passers, none of them are ELITE passers like a top-tier point guard, let alone someone like Luka or Jokic. As such, iso ball is often a decent option to reduce the number of potentially poor passing decisions.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s use three examples to illustrate my point. First, Tatum&rsquo;s behind the back pass to Horford in the ECF G3 against the Pacers near the end of the game.Â <a href="https://streamable.com/4y4yp2" target="_blank">Here&rsquo;s a link</a>. I rate Tatum as a good play-maker (B or B+) because he&rsquo;s very good at getting past the initial defender, drawing help, and then making nifty pass to an open man like Horford.</p>

<p>People used this pass to highlight his progress as a creator for teammates. While he has certainly grown, notice though that he has a simple read here. While the pass itself is awesome, Tatum is still just reading his and Horford&rsquo;s defenders for the most part. It&rsquo;s not rocket science.</p>

<p>Another example (sorry, no link): Again ECF G1, this time in OT. With less than 2 minutes left, Tatum botches a pass to Jrue Holiday, leading to 3 FT&rsquo;s for Haliburton after a steal the other way. While infrequent watchers of Celtics basketball chalked this up to Tatum &ldquo;choking&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s actually representative of many bad possessions by the Celtics.</p>

<p>You see awkward passing from time-to-time, not just from Tatum but every ballhandler. Hesitant post entry passes, missed cutters, slightly inaccurate passes that give the defense time to close out a shooter, stuff like that. The team has all gotten better at passing, but no one is at the level of elite distributors, let alone someone like Luka.</p>

<p>Final example (sorry, no link): WCF Game 2. Around 3:35 in Q1, Luka gets trapped near the logo by Ant and Gobert. Without hesitation, Luka fake-looks to the left wing and lasers a no-look pass to Lively in the paint. Because the pass gets there so fast and unexpectedly, McDaniels panics and helps from the strong-side corner, leaving Lively an easy pass to a wide open Hardy who hilariously bricks the 3.</p>

<p>I like this example because it&rsquo;s so routine for Luka. We saw plays like this virtually every game from him this year (at least ones I watched), sometimes multiple times. No-look lasers, precise lobs, pinpoint skip passes to the opposite corner, you take these for granted when watching top tier passers like him.</p>

<p>These are not skills that any Celtic has or even approaches. It&rsquo;s not that they lack all-world level passing of someone like Luka, which is obvious. It&rsquo;s that they lack a player with even all-star level passing, someone like prime Rondo or Draymond.</p>

<p><strong>Motion Is Overrated</strong></p>

<p>OK, so the Celtics lack a truly elite passer. So what? This doesn&rsquo;t stop them from running more motion in their offense, right? Yes, but this brings us full circle to Celtics&rsquo; offensive talent.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s review the Celtics offensive talent again. Porzingis has crazy post up efficiency vs. mismatches. Tatum and Brown can get around (or through) almost any defender in the league 1-on-1. Derrick White only needs a sliver of space to launch 3s or drive past someone for his little floater. Jrue has his big boy post-moves.</p>

<p>Assuming we can get a mismatch or attack downhill, that&rsquo;s usually enough for us to get a good look. Adding motion to the offense, especially off-ball actions in conjunction with on-ball actions, leads to more difficult pass-reads and pass-making. This can lead to more turnovers, especially without an elite passer at the helm.</p>

<p>With our embarrassment of talent at shot-making, ending a possession in a passing turnover is a disaster. You&rsquo;d rather them get a look vs a mismatch in iso and see what happens, even if it does end up in a bricked midrange fadeaway.</p>

<p>A missed shot can still draw a shooting foul, a putback, or an offensive rebound. Meanwhile, any turnover ends our chance to score, and a live ball turnover is hard to stop even with our defensive talent.</p>

<p>For these reasons, the Celtics&rsquo; current heavy diet of iso isn&rsquo;t a fluke or a result of Mazzulla being dumber than sports media. It&rsquo;s an intentional core piece of the offense, and it&rsquo;s probably optimal given our current roster.</p>

<hr>

<p>I have more to say about why we&rsquo;re seeing more iso in the playoffs, what other teams have done to slow our iso&rsquo;ing, and how it&rsquo;ll fare against the Mavs in the Finals, but I&rsquo;ll save that for another edition if I have time. This is already getting way too long.</p>

<p>Agree with me? Think I&rsquo;m an idiot? Would love to hear in the comments. I&rsquo;m clearly way too bored.</p>

      <label for="l6zjym2" class="commentText"><p>Live by the 3 die by the 3 is a narrative that is applied to past Celtics teams more than this team. The 3âs this Celtics team takes are quality shots within the offense opened up by dribble drives from jrue, white, brown and Tatum. Itâs why our percentage is near the top of the league. And the more quality 3âs we take, there is actually less variance too.</p>

      <label for="l6zs1s7" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve seen less of the wildly open 3s in the playoffs though because teams are playing more disciplined defense.</p>

<p>Against Miami and Cleveland, it felt like nothing was truly open that often because they helped late and stayed at home mostly with the shooters. Even when they rotated, they prioritized running people off the line instead of protecting the paint.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t stop us, but it prevents getting run out of the gym like you&rsquo;d see so many times in the reg season.</p>

<p>Pacers, they just sucked it up sometimes like in the Tatum example. They scored enough to make up for it though.</p>

      <label for="l6zpnx0" class="commentText"><p>I generally agree with your points on their offense. The one thing that I might disagree on is &lsquo;Celtics don&rsquo;t have an elite passer&rsquo;. Most teams don&rsquo;t have one either. Most teams just need a decent/above average passers. I think the better thing to say might be their talent is slower at reading passing lanes so they keep things simple and not rely on motion offense. They focus more on making a correct read with their iso offense which is simple and safe rather than making a fast read to accelerate their passing offense which is more prone to turnovers.</p>

<p>This is why this Celtics team stumps everyone a little. With their talent, people look and believe they should be able to make fast reads. I have the Celtics winning the Finals, but I can easily see this being a sweep or seven games. Their variance is just that high to me.</p>

<p>For the Mavs, I imagine most people will say 6-7 games just due to a more grind it out play style. If Mavs win in less games, it will be due to variance of the Celtics IMO.</p>

      <label for="l6zquqs" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s fair. It&rsquo;s more the fast reads than skill, though I do think there&rsquo;s plain passing skill lacking too. You see teams aggressively ball-denying us in the post in every playoff series. It&rsquo;s worth the risk because they know our passers aren&rsquo;t that great at entries, so it bogs down the possession sometimes.</p>

I see players simply just lob it up over the top which can lead to <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> balls. I&rsquo;m a personal fan of just fake lob and bounce pass entry which hardly anymore does anymore.</p>

<p>Which current contending teams don&rsquo;t have a top tier passer though? Maybe I&rsquo;m missing someone, I only thought of the Timberwolves, and I think they felt that loss in the Dallas series because they couldn&rsquo;t generate offense, especially if Conley was out.</p>

      <label for="l6zv7q3" class="commentText"><p>I consume more basketball content than is probably necessary, especially now that there are only two teams still playing, and this is some of the best analysis I&rsquo;ve heard in a while.  I completely agree with your point that a lot of the dialogue about Boston&rsquo;s offense is pretty unsophisticated, even from people like Zach Lowe.  Its the best in the league, yet it gets stagnant?  They kind of stop there instead of going into the &ldquo;why&rdquo; or &ldquo;how.&rdquo;  And in any event it seems like it would be difficult for both of those things to be true, so you figured out why it might <em>look</em> like it stagnates.</p>

I think the only criticism of our offense that actually makes sense is the tempo thingâ it doesn&rsquo;t happen as much as some people seem to think it does, but it <em>is</em> really frustrating when we burn 10 seconds off the shot clock before even starting our first action, or decide to dump it off to Tatum for a pullup with over 10 seconds left on the clock. And to be clear, this isn&rsquo;t a Tatum thing, it&rsquo;s a general team offense thing. They can&rsquo;t be doing that shit against Dallas.</p>

      <label for="l702ic8" class="commentText"><p>One major problem with your theory is that nobody on the Celtics is great at isolating. Tatum&rsquo;s roughly the 20th best in the league, Brown is closer to 80th, Porzingus gets so few isos and doesn&rsquo;t score well on them. (This is eyeballing the iso stats, I count 16ish guys on high volume with better ppp than Tatum this year, and some guys who are probably better had down years (Durant), Brown is so far down I stopped counting)</p>

<p>Their team isolation stats seem to be buoyed by elite spacing and the lack of truly poor iso-players&hellip; Such as rookies exploring the studio space (Banchero/Barnes/Cade) tank commanders (Poole/Kuzma), unaware vets (WB, Beal, Randle), bad bench gunners (big gov&rsquo;t).</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re not actually beating their man one-on-one at an elite level. Especially considering that Tatum has the highest iso frequency in the league and Brown is in the top 40.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is Mazulla&rsquo;s plan. They&rsquo;ve had this criticism the last 6-7 years (never being below 9th in iso frequency). The Jays just seem to default to isolation.</p>

<p>While they aren&rsquo;t a bad iso team, they&rsquo;re just so much better when they don&rsquo;t do it, dropping 3-4 isos per game would make their offense even more dominant.</p>

      <label for="l7070lq" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s too frequent to be not intentional. Do those stats include the PPP for the entire team or just efficiency for the person for the iso possession? If it&rsquo;s just for the person, it might miss the knock on effects of shooting these shots and getting the putback/rebound as well.</p>

<p>The stats also don&rsquo;t necessarily measure beating their man, just what they score, right? The open 3s we get usually come off these drives, so I&rsquo;d guess you&rsquo;d have to factor that as well. Saying that Tatum isn&rsquo;t getting past his initial defender seems an incorrect statement because that&rsquo;s literally the engine of our offense and how we generated a lot of our 3s in the first place.</p>

There&rsquo;s a weird disconnect where analysts can understand the reasoning behind shooting more 3s but then can&rsquo;t extend that logic to iso-ing.</p>

      <label for="l700iah" class="commentText"><p>I think the cornerstone of the Celtics offense (like many) is the PnR. Often that turns into isolation certainly, but often it leads to a pop 3 pointer for the screener, a rim run dunk for KP or Kornet, or a kick out on the drive. So I don&rsquo;t think its purely isolation, but sometimes as an option/call (often last one) we iso.</p>

<p>Mazzulla seems most happy when we generate open 3s and move the ball around. That comes from drive and kick most often, but it isn&rsquo;t always a drive from belabored isolation, more just a drive off the PnR.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think we pound the ball as much as a Luka does. I don&rsquo;t often see us dribbling the ball for 16 seconds straight before a drive.</p>

      <label for="l706g0g" class="commentText"><p>Appreciate the effort and thereâs definitely something there. But thereâs a difference between iso-ing and stagnating. Celtics wonât play well if they walk the ball up, clear out the wing and watch Tatum go to work. They still benefit from swinging the ball and movement. That gets the defense to think and react, and then when an iso happens, thereâs flow and rhythm to it. And the criticism is that they spend too much time stagnant. Thatâs probably an eye test thing though because as noted they had the best offense in the league. The stagnant stretches stand out because otherwise the offense looks great â and to your point they still have elite scorers who can make up for a bad possession. They donât need elite passing to literally just pass the ball or execute a drive-and-kick, and they do those things plenty.</p>

<p>However, prime Rondo was absolutely an otherworldly passer who made passes every single game that made you gasp.</p>

      <label for="l7098ti" class="commentText"><p>Well it really depends on what your definition of iso is. My definition is that, even if you go through a series of PnR&rsquo;s, if the end result is just one guy squaring up another guy and trying to beat him 1-on-1, that&rsquo;s effectively iso.</p>

<p>This is different from having an offense based on lots of cuts, Curry-style offball actions to free up a shooter, etc.</p>

<p>I also think you&rsquo;re just disagreeing with me straight up with the stagnant point lol (which is fine). I think the &ldquo;stagnant&rdquo; possessions are the point, whereas you think it&rsquo;s a problem for players&rsquo; flow. Agree to disagree I guess.</p>

<p>I will say that, beyond keeping iso&rsquo;s around, pushing the pace has been an obvious point of emphasis from Mazzulla. I see this as getting a good possession without needing to fall into our basic PnR iso ball.</p>

      <label for="l70bqp8" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I do think some ball movement is a nice lubricant for offense even if the passes arenât home runs. But I donât contest the point that we have plenty of guys who will have an advantage against an individual defender at any given moment, and that means we donât need âthe beautiful offenseâ to score. I also think it can be a trap when guys try to spam the mismatch over and over - I think a drive and kick or pick n roll produces more reliable results. When you do have scorers and shooters at every position you need to move the rock to open up lanes.</p>

<p>But shit man I donât wanna be overly critical I think itâs a good point and more broadly the idea that there are many ways to succeed and the best teams will play their strengths and personnel.</p>

      <label for="l7095er" class="commentText"><p>I agree that our offense should have a lot of iso given our players, but I think youâre underrating our playmakers. We donât have a Luka or Jokic passer, but I wouldnât say our passing is actually weak. Itâs more so that they have multiple players who are elite at punishing mismatches, so they mismatch hunt- you play to your teams strengths.</p>

<p>White is straight up known for being a great decision maker. Itâs his whole thing, he VERY rarely makes mistakes, and when he does itâs one of those random games where he gets all of them out of the way at once lol.</p>

<p>Jrue is a very skilled passer and has run point his whole career at a near all star to all star level, and won a ring at the position. He and White have thrown a LOT of entry passes to Tatum, Brown, and Porzingis this year with very few mistakes.</p>

<p>Tatum is a good enough passer to run offense through. He routinely makes skip passes, uses his height to hit tough angles, and is excellent at passing out of doubles- doubling him is almost always positive for the Celtics. Heâs averaging 5.9 assists and a 2.44 assist to turnover ratio this playoffs, which is actually <em>better</em> than Lukaâs 2.39 (yes, lower usage and totals, Iâm not saying heâs a better playmaker lol).</p>

<p>And we havenât seen this because heâs been out, but the Celtics do utilize KP in the high post to run motion-type stuff at times- usually for a Brown cut. Their chemistry is great and leads to some great plays, as Porzingis is a very underrated passer. The offense as a whole is much more dynamic with him due to his pop/roll abilities being way better than any other big.</p>

<p>Ultimately though, we are saying the same thing, which is that the playstyle is based on personnel. The Celtics run a scheme that fits their players, and would not be better off running plays that work because of guys like Jokic, Luka, or Curry. Wow that was way too long.</p>

      <label for="l70a8xe" class="commentText"><p>Your motion is overrated is a point that so many people miss. People act like 5 people cutting, moving, filling, spaces, stretching out is supposed to be going on every play and easy to execute. But that can lead to overcomplication and more mistakes. Its also can get blown up if the defense reads it already. It also tires everyone out. A point no one talks about is no matter how creative the coach is, the players either have to be really smart and in synch or have a specific role ingrained in them. I dont think 60% of the NBA can fit that category. Being able to create from mismatches is a key factor to every offense and sometimes if your talent suits it, thatâs all you need plus spacing. The answer is obviously to mix it up which a lot of coaches do.</p>

      <label for="l70c4vm" class="commentText"><p>Yeah well, my issue is that the Celtics haven&rsquo;t been tested in this playoffs due to every team losing their main player when they play them. Is that the Celtics fault? no. Does it matter in terms of assessing their quality in terms of playoff games? Yes.</p>

<p>They haven&rsquo;t faced someone of Luka&rsquo;s caliber yet this year. The last time they did, they lost the finals (Curry). So it&rsquo;s really hard to say they will create a mismatch because Dallas only has one actual short person (Kyrie) in the starting lineup. Derick Lively/Gafford has been pretty good in the post. It&rsquo;s easy to have good post effiecney when the best center you have faced in the whole playoffs is one Bam (Who is great but undersized). The constant changing of centers for Dallas allows them to be more powerful and well-rested. Once KP sits who is going to take their place? KP doesn&rsquo;t play all 48 minutes.</p>

<p>Their offense works in the sense they find a short guard and pick on him the whole game. I don&rsquo;t think Kyrie would be getting mismatched in most situations because that isn&rsquo;t his position. Also by the way? you are right. The ISO-heavy game is a feature of your offense. As it has always been from a wing-dominated lineup (look up at KD&rsquo;s team). Usually, when the best player is a wing player they are ISO heavy. This has its benefits, but also has negatives because you end up not having great passers. Which can hurt you in pick and rolls and slashing offense. OR just when the ISO isn&rsquo;t working. You can&rsquo;t really have a plan B.</p>

<p>The ISO-heavy play works when the other team doesn&rsquo;t have a player (or in this case two) that can do the same on the other end. We know KP isn&rsquo;t that high level of a defender how do we know the Mavs can&rsquo;t put him in the same pick-and-roll situation and do the same Timberwolves situation?</p>

<p>Also, I feel the Celtics issue has never really been their offense and defense. It has been mental fortitude and coaching adjustment. Their players don&rsquo;t have that &lsquo;dawg&rsquo; in them, where they can single-handedly take a game over like Curry, Jokic or Luka does.</p>

      <label for="l6zrnon" class="commentText"><p>I mean, it tends to work until it doesn&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;ve shown a remarkable ability to flounder in the waning minutes of games, taking bad shots, and a general failure to generate any cohesive offense.</p>

<p>We haven&rsquo;t really been tested at all yet this playoffs, so it&rsquo;s really TBD, imo. I genuinely do think Mazzoula is a horrible coach when it comes to Xs and Os.</p>
