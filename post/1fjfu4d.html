      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fjfu4d/what_are_your_expectations_of_the_celtics_bench/"><p>What are your expectations of the Celtics bench with Porzingis out potentially the first 25-30 games of the season?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>KP is expected to be out til around Christmas time after surgery on his left leg. If he&rsquo;s back around Christmas he&rsquo;ll have missed the first 28 games. He&rsquo;s looking jacked and he&rsquo;s already doing shooting drills and light conditioning so his rehab is coming along well.</p>

<p>Celtics will be fine without him but KP changes them as a team because of his ability to score at all three levels and the stretch ability, and the rim protection on D. Big Al Horford obviously can bring most of that to the table himself&mdash;he&rsquo;s shot well over 40% from 3 the last two seasons combined. He&rsquo;s not quite as dynamic obviously as KP at this stage of his career, but the shot is very repeatable and if he has space he will knock it down. He&rsquo;s still a very good play finisher and effective in the post, although he&rsquo;s become mostly a 3 point specialist these days&hellip;and obviously he remains a very positive defensive presence.</p>

<p>Celtics starting five will remain excellent and league&rsquo;s best level, unless Father Time catches Al&hellip;no indication surely as it stands now but can creep at any time at 38&hellip;it does take a chunk out of their depth a little, however. Kornet, Tillman, Queta will all play based on matchups. Al played 27 minutes a game last year and 30 the year before. He&rsquo;s not gonna get more than ~30 and will have periodic rest. How well do you think these guys will hold up?</p>

<p>Celtics allowed Brissett to walk and drafted Baylor Scheierman. I like him a lot&hellip;he&rsquo;s mature and very skilled offensively. He may be asked to immediately step into the rotation. Jordan Walsh had a decent G-League season, not a very good summer league, but has shown signs of refinement on both ends in his game. Lonnie Walker has an inside track on a roster spot but not guaranteed. He&rsquo;s coming off the best year of his career but been pretty volatile and inconsistent throughout his career. Celtics brass like Jaden Springer who hasn&rsquo;t had much opportunity or performance yet in three NBA seasons and who was added during the deadline. Maybe this is his chance.</p>

<p>Pritchard and Hauser are studs, two of the best backups at their positions around, but the rest of the bench has some question. Not questions that are massively existential but there are questions surrounding big and wing depth. How well do you think they hold the fort in KP&rsquo;s absence?</p>

      <label for="lnnxt71" class="commentText"><p>The Celtics went 21-4 (69 win pace) without Porzingis in the regular season, and 10-2 without him in the playoffs (68 win pace). And they currently have the same Center rotation as last year.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying they are going to win at a near 70 win pace, but I think they will be fine. Porzingis is just the cherry on top for the Celtics. They are plenty lethal without him.</p>

What sort of &ldquo;analysis&rdquo; is this!? They&rsquo;re essentially the same team, and arguably better for having won. They&rsquo;re really, really good without him. They&rsquo;re simply unstoppable with him.</p>

      <label for="lnntpva" class="commentText"><p>Our center rotation is more than fine. Kornet knows this team and we can get 8-10 serviceable minutes out of him most nights if needed. the great bigs will hurt us for sure but none of those teams can guard tatum and brown so we just gotta out pace them early and put the game out of reach so Al can rest. The biggest thing i would want us to get this season is some rest for tatum. dude has played probably 1000 more minutes of basketball than anyone else in the nba since he came into the leauge. we need him to have some rest nights this season.</p>

      <label for="lnnu2j2" class="commentText"><p>We will still have one of the better benches in the league.</p>

<p>Tatum plays a lot with our bench. For some reason, he has unreal chemisty with Kornet, and takes Kornet from being pretty meh to a solid backup big. I assume we will still use the Tatum+PP+Hauser+Kornet 4 man group a lot, and continue to use one of the starting guards with them. Maybe some Lonnie Walker as well as the 5th guy in that grouping.</p>

<p>I think its more likely that we see a decent amount of Lonnie, but use him more with Brown while Tatum is on the bench. We just wont run full bench lineups in actual games.</p>

      <label for="lnnu6uk" class="commentText"><p>They would have won the championship without him so more than fine barring more injuries. Their starting lineup is so good that they can stagger players &amp; throw out countless regular season lineups that end up positive. So the bench is chill, the bigger “problem” for them is if Tatum’s jumper continues to be streaky but I highly doubt that considering literally the rest of his career/23-24 regular season shooting splits.</p>

      <label for="lno8hkh" class="commentText"><p>Negligible impact - maybe lose an extra 2 games - so 22-8 instead of 24-6 over first 30.  Even without KP they&rsquo;re the best team in the league.  KP just makes them untouchable.</p>

<p>The biggest pain point is probably that they can&rsquo;t play Horford for 30 straight games.  So there&rsquo;s going to be a handful of rest games for him where you&rsquo;ve got to get some solid production out of Kornet/Queta/Tillman.  In the long run it may actually help them to get Queta/Tillman more minutes and into the flow of the team anyways.</p>

      <label for="lno8uer" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s a great ceiling raiser but their floor is still a top-5 team in the NBA. Horford&rsquo;s old and the backups can&rsquo;t shoot so  with some east teams making some major upgrades I won&rsquo;t discount it having an impact. Still, its clear this is a team playing for the playoffs regardless and I don&rsquo;t think it would be overly concerning if they don&rsquo;t manage to secure the 1 seed again this year. If he gets injured again before the playoffs that would be both more significant and also not terribly surprising given his history. If they decide to keep him in bubble wrap for most of the regular season playing limited minutes I would be in favor</p>

      <label for="lnosht4" class="commentText"><p>The bench will be fine. Porzingis is expected back around Christmas and in the 29 games before then, we play the Wizards x2, Pistons x2, Hornets x2, Hawks x2, Nets x2, Raptors, and Bulls x3. That&rsquo;s half of the games.</p>

<p>We have 5 back-to-backs and 3 with no travel, but Horford will be sitting 5 of these games regardless.</p>

<p>Our schedule is really easy to start the year and it will be a good opportunity to give other guys like Tillman, Queta and Kornet solid rotation minutes and tinker with smaller lineups.</p>

<p>The most interesting part of Porzingis&rsquo; absence is the Celtics play all 3 matchups against the Bucks by December 6 and 2 are in Boston, where the Bucks have not won in the regular season since December of 2018. They have lost the last 7 games there, but they have won 8 of their last 10 in Milwaukee. That tiebreaker could be very interesting if the Bucks have an excellent regular season or they need it in a specific scenario at the end of the year.</p>
