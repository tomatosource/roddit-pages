      <p>We all know the legends of Arvydas Sabonis, one of the biggest ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù in NBA history, who only arrived to the NBA at the age of 30, with finished legs instead of arriving 10 years earlier due to Cold War tensions. Which any other foreign league greats would have been likely to succeed in the NBA had they arrived to the league in their early 20s rather than only starting their NBA careers at the age from late-20s to 30s? Would players like Andrew Gaze, Fabricio Oberto or Antoine Rigaudeau made it in the NBA?</p>

<p>Pablo Prigioni was a decent bench player for the Knicks when he was like 34.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that both could have had long and productive careers in the league if they started sooner, albeit not as stars like they were in Europe</p>

Had he been allowed to play it would‚Äôve changed the course of history with the Trail Blazers as he was basically a mixture of Dirk &amp; Jokic. By the time he was allowed in the league he was already past his prime and still put up great numbers but his knees were cooked.</p>
