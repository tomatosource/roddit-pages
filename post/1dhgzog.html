</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Before he was considered an all-star caliber player and one of the best shooting guards in the league, now it’s like he vanished idk haven’t heard about him at all. He only averaged 19 ppg which is very disappointing compared to his previous seasons. Bulls are obviously in the gutter and have no hope to become contenders. I read that other playoff teams aren’t even interested in trading for him, so who knows what will happen.</p>

      <label for="l8wxqn1" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s been injured for years, but on the Bulls you play through injuries because the org wants every last win to make the play-in so it&rsquo;s not very apparent.</p>

<ul>
<li>2021:  Healthy.  27 / 5 / 5, 63% TS</li>
<li>2022:  Thumb injury 5 games into the season, he played all season with it injured even though he said playing risked further tearing. 24 / 4.6 / 4.5, 60% TS</li>
<li>2023:  (pre-ASG) Knee surgery on ACL knee. 24 / 4.9 / 4.1, 59% TS</li>
<li>2023: (post-ASG) Recovered &amp; in normal health. 27 / 3.5 / 4.7, 64% TS</li>
<li>2024:  Required ankle surgery.  20 / 5.2 / 3.9, 58% TS</li>
</ul>

<p>When healthy he&rsquo;s 27 ppg, 40%+ 3P%, and 63-64% True Shooting but that&rsquo;s only happened for a season and a half since 2021.</p>

Give him a point guard and don&rsquo;t ask him to shoulder the entire offensive load and you got a stew goin. He&rsquo;s an okay defender but would probably be better if he didn&rsquo;t have to be a significant part of our offense.</p>

It disgusts me that these mfers wanna resign him for 30m+ over multiple years for fucking veteran presence. Sure he’s a good vet, but all the things he’s teaching everyone, can’t even be used when he’s ball hogging all the damn time.</p>

<p>Trade Zach to GS for Chris Paul and filler and that would be all the vet presence we need. CP would do wonders for Coby and Ayo while also getting guys like Pat the fucking ball since his a pass first point god.</p>

<p>He’s 29 now. He used to be, arguably, the best athlete in the NBA. He’s still very good, but he’s not the bolt of lightning he used to be. That makes finishes around the rim harder. You have to settle for a slightly harder jumper. Etc.</p>

<p>I do think he’s gotten a bad rap these past few years. People talk about him like he’s trash now. He’s still a fantastic scorer.</p>

He&rsquo;s not a great defender or playmaker and that hurts him when he has other players that can score around him. I like the guy as a player but never had him among the best 2 gaurds in the league like others did</p>

You’re acting like it’s impossible to get minutes on Miami if you aren’t a great defender.  That’s just like, objectively untrue even in recent years. But past years too, Jason Williams, Antoine walker, Ray Allen, Mike miller, the Pat Riley era of Miami has always had good offensive players who can’t play defense.</p>

      <label for="l8x90of" class="commentText"><p>I have to be honest, I think he could’ve definitely been a 2nd option on a very good team, a la Booker or Mitchell. There was a time a few years ago where all three of those players were basically neck and neck for the “best 2 guard in the league” title, and it’s not like Booker or Mitchell have improved drastically since then, it’s more that Lavine got hurt and fell off. He sort of ducked out of the race versus those two taking off. There’s very little either Booker or Mitchell can do that Lavine can’t and there’s plenty that Lavine can do they they can’t (Lavine is taller, faster, and more athletic than either, especially Booker, but even Mitchell). Lavine was also good in the clutch as well, he was actually a very good player before the injuries. He was the second best player on a team that was a 1 seed for most of the year and was incredible in the clutch.</p>

<p>He had a good defense around him, a capable scorer next to him, the bulls had a pretty good roster that first year of adding DeRozan.  Things just didn’t pan out as far as health, but he had everything needed to be just as good of a player as Booker or Mitchell are now, and they are like top 15-20ish players in my book, and solid 2nd options on contenders, or first options on playoff teams. Lavine easily was that and would’ve continued to be that.</p>

      <label for="l8xbwot" class="commentText"><p>Booker just averaged 27 on 61%ts with 7 assists per game (to only 2.6topg), best year of his career. Curious how that’s not an improvement?</p>

<p>Also, Booker and DMitch have both been 1st options on ELITE regular season teams and won playoff series as the 1st option. Two things that Lavine has never done.</p>

<p>I’m not saying he can’t reach their heights, but they’ve both clearly surpassed him at this point.</p>

      <label for="l8x8yzq" class="commentText"><p>He missed most of the season, and Bulls definitely looked a better team with nothing in place of LaVine in the roster. At some point it is a bit hard to keep completely ignoring that if you wanna win. Especially considering he has a contract that would suggest making a gigantic positive difference to the teams&rsquo; strength, which is very difficult to find in the results any year.</p>

<p>He is a good scorer, but Bulls having now three other players who like the ball, and few very-low-usage players in the roster, his amount of ppg might not always be the highest too. He can likely get way more ppg in some team, if they focus on that. But considering his age, contract, and overall play in a modern NBA team, it&rsquo;s hard to say which team might find a benefit in it.</p>

<p>A lot of comments here are very surprising to me and imo don&rsquo;t describe his role in a team at all. Dude is eating the plays. It&rsquo;s hard to have good plays and movement with him. He is neither good at playing off ball or playing with others who do. In NBA you need both to technically execute the plays well and also have the understanding of the game to read the game by second and actually do those plays at the right time. That makes a big difference between him and the players he is compared to (as the better one, too) in this thread. Depending on every particular player&rsquo;s efficiency, it might be better or worse to have him (again, individually he is a better scorer than most), but the results of his teams&rsquo; over the years don&rsquo;t give reasons to suggest that offense with LaVine is better offense. Also, the belief that is X and Y happens he will stop costing points on defense is so far just that, belief. Many hopeful beliefs about him, overall, for a guy that is not a beginner.</p>

      <label for="l8xfdf4" class="commentText"><p>I’m trolling I actually like watching the bulls when fully healthy they are a competitive regular season team. It is nice to talk to a reasonable bulls fan. Bulls I was dumbfounded when they traded Carter. I thought they got a steak with him. Always liked White too he’s really good. Caruso I would sell with his value high. But he’s a really good player. The bulls problem is players like Vu, Demar, Lavine make them too good to tank. Not good enough for a contender. Bulls need sell who they can out of the big 3 vets and rebuild. I will say the Pistons went from no core to Cade, Ivey, Ausar, Simone, Duren, Stew, Sasser, Grimes core in 3 years. So it definitely speeds the process up to fully tank for a few seasons! </p>
