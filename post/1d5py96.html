    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>There have been certain players (Josh Hart and Rajon Rondo come to mind) who have gotten their team many extra possessions by going hard after offensive rebounds, not necessary by crashing the boards   but running into the paint area and picking off the rebounds that bounce a little further out. There are many teams though that have the players prioritize getting back on defense instead. It would seem be better to at least make some attempt to get the offensive rebound, the rest of the team can scramble back.</p>

      <label for="l6n3gvg" class="commentText"><p>going for extra possessions vs giving up more points in transition is the simple equation. the decision is often personnel related, but some coaches live and die by one or the other. a lot of the better transition defense also have lower offensive rebound rates &amp;  a lot of the better offensive rebounding teams have worse transition defense.</p>

<p>in a similar vain, a lot of heavy ball movement offenses may have better shot quality because of the nature of catch and shoot shots, but have more turnovers.. and teams that are heavy isolation have less turnovers but way more difficult shots.</p>

<p>lots of little tradeoffs like that in basketball.</p>

<p>Gregg Popovich actually preached the exact opposite for most of the Spurs 5-championship dynasty.  Granted they had Tim Duncan, but those Spurs teams always crashed the boards the least in the league.  They always prioritized getting set up on defense and playing good on that end over slightly increasing your low chances of getting an offensive rebound (but risking giving up easier transition points).  And it worked for them pretty well.</p>

      <label for="l6n2ksz" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s called crashing the boards.</p>

<p>The issue is if I&rsquo;m a Center/forward and I see a little guard next to me, I&rsquo;m definitely passing up court for a fast break.</p>

<p>You can get away with it a few times if you see the spacing to get the rebound (or a team has bad rebounders on the court)but most times, it&rsquo;s not worth letting your teammates rush around and get fouls trying to stop the fast break.</p>
