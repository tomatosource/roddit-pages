<p>That&rsquo;s half of all Finalists since 2019-20.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The 2020 Finals were the only Finals in this whole list where both teams had missed the playoffs the year before.</p></li>

<li><p>The 2023 Finals are the only Finals since 2019-20 to feature two teams that made the playoffs the previous year.</p></li>

<li><p>On top of this, none of the last 5 defending champs have reached the conference finals.</p></li>

<li><p>Since 2019-20, only 3 out of 20 teams that were coming off a conference finals berth made it back to the conference finals (nobody in 2020, 2021 and 2022, Heat and Celtics in 2023, Celtics in 2024).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This paints a picture of league that has changed massively since the KD-Warriors broke up. Since then we have had an unprecedented likelihood of teams going from bad to contenders in a single year, and contenders falling off in a single year.</p>

<p>I think this is important to keep in mind when looking at how quickly fans are dismiss the chances of a deep playoff run of any team that missed the playoffs / lost in round 1 the previous year, and to stop pencilling-in every team that looked like a contender the previous year to be one again the next year.</p>

<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s something inherent to today&rsquo;s league that makes it harder to stay on top and easier to pop off out of nowhere? Or is it just random and this will go back to normal in the future?</p>

      <label for="lazkg9p" class="commentText"><p>It’s still pretty insane how “getting healthy” is enough to propel a team from not even making the playoffs to being in the finals. I mean all the Warriors did was get Klay back who was coming off ACL and Achilles tears and all the Mavs did was draft a raw rookie center who averaged 5 ppg at Duke and trade for two mid players playing for the worst teams in the league. Obviously teams like the Lakers, Heat, and Suns did trade for big-time pieces.</p>

      <label for="lazhe2e" class="commentText"><p>yeah but it&rsquo;s not like those things never happened from 1976 to 2019. Even with that possibility, it used to exceedingly rare for teams to turn around from the lottery to the Finals in a single year.</p>

      <label for="lazh71r" class="commentText"><p>I don’t really think so when you look at the context of all of these teams.</p>

<p>Lakers were a playoff team the year before but Bron got hurt and they fell off.</p>

<p>The Heat signed Jimmy Buttler in the offseason which is a major move.</p>

<p>The Suns looked like a much improved team in the bubble going undefeated and then traded for CP3 which is a major move.</p>

<p>Warriors dealt with a bunch of injuries the were before and pretty much punted the year. Made trades like getting Wiggins and got healthy.</p>

<p>Mavs tanked to end the year to get a high pick. Made the perfect pick and then made trades at the deadline to contend.</p>

      <label for="lazhr0e" class="commentText"><p>yeah but isn&rsquo;t that kind of the point? With the player movement era it&rsquo;s probably easier now to make the kind of offseason roster hauls that can transform a lottery team into a Finals team than it used to be, no?</p>

      <label for="laztazz" class="commentText"><p>I feel like most contenders these days are extremely top heavy, relying on 2 or 3 guys to be finals contenders. 3 max guys is like 115% of the cap, so it’s hard to have much talent outside of that.</p>

<p>One guy goes down, suddenly you’re terrible. Guy gets healthy, you’re amazing again.</p>

<p>Boston this year was a masterclass in roster construction. 2 all nba guys and 3 fringe all stars in their starting lineup. Two elite perimeter defenders who can score, and a shot blocking center who can shoot, and two forwards who are elite 2 way players. Really just no holes. Toss in a  wiley vet like Horford and a smart high effort guy like Pritchard, and it’s probably the most complete roster the league has seen in quite some time.</p>
