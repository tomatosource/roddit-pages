<p>We&rsquo;ll see how the Clippers do over the next 4+ years but I don&rsquo;t even see them winning a playoffs series with that roster.</p>

<p>And the new CBA introduced not only the 2nd apron, but even harsher luxury tax penalties for repeat offenders. So maxing PG would&rsquo;ve also meant way more money out of Ballmer&rsquo;s pockets compared to their present situation.</p>

      <label for="lc7lxv2" class="commentText"><p>These guys are getting older and would actually need better role players around them to compete in the west, and the second apron penalties would have severely limited their ability to construct a better roster.</p>

<p>In addition to the First Apron penalties, Clips would have faced these Second Apron penalties:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Teams cannot use a trade exception generated by aggregating the salaries of multiple players</p></li>

<li><p>Teams cannot include cash in a trade</p></li>

<li><p>Teams cannot use a trade exception generated in a prior year</p></li>

<li><p>First-round picks seven years out are frozen (unable to be traded)</p></li>

<li><p>A team&rsquo;s first-round pick is moved to the end of the first round if they remain in the second apron for three out of five seasons</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The second apron is so punishing that I believe we&rsquo;ll see a lot of teams start to do this over throwing good money in after bad.</p>

      <label for="lc7iaxq" class="commentText"><p>Thing is from the way PG makes it sound if they gave him the <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>150</sub> when Kawhi got his in January the NTC wouldn’t have come into play. It only did because of how the Clippers handled negotiations throughout the year.</p>

<p>They didn’t offer him that contract until the end of the season at which point I’m sure he knew Philly had a 4 year max for him so he looked at it as “Y’all played with me all year but I will still take $60 million less to stay, just give me a NTC” and Clips said no. They played hardball and lost PG for nothing when they probably would have had him on a 3 year max without a no trade clause if they didn’t offer him <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>60</sub> to begin with.</p>

I think they were thinking when push came to shove PG would wanna stay home in LA. Ownership and management forget players are people and this is what happens when you don’t take that into consideration. 2 years/$60 million as an initial offer is crazy and shows what their mindstate was dealing with PG and they didn’t take into account he wouldn’t forget that</p>

If they valued him that lowly they should’ve made him available in trades and got some assets back but it seems they really thought he’d just take whatever they offered all year because LA. People trying to pat them on the back for rejecting the NTC when that’s a corner they pushed themselves into in the first place. Now if they do start a rebuild they got Harden and one of the most injury prone superstars in the league who are both 33+.</p>

Let the team have some flexibility if things change ffs. You are already getting 200mil to put a leather ball through a hoop, you sure can move to another city for a few years and let your previous team build up a bit, be successful.</p>

<p>If players are going to be this selfish about everything, then they get no sympathy from me. They have the right to brle selfish and maybe they should fine… but don’t go on a podcast and cry you feel disrespected.</p>

<p>No, it&rsquo;s becuase they want the flexibility to be able to trade him.</p>

<p>Those are two very different things.</p>

      <label for="lc7idun" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s not the point IMO.</p>

<p>Beal stayed there all his career, the Wizards were so bad at trading  and at managing that they cornered themselves  with a walking out Beal that you have to promise a 4th or 5th rebuild while he brings to the table two of the only requirements to get the max ( all star in one of the last 2 years+ NBA award in the last 2 years).</p>

<p>So Wizards bring to the table:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>No top seed of the division since 2017.</p></li>

<li><p>No second round since also 2017.</p></li>

<li><p>An offense that makes him top 5 in shot attempts because the rest of the team isn&rsquo;t as efficient.</p></li>

<li><p>No credible way to  even convince him that the money saved from him taking less could bring a player that would make them compete with the Heat, Bucks, Boston, Sixer.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Meanwhile.</p>

<p>Beal was in the same situation as Lillard. Carrying the team like a Max contract top 15 player but not making miracles like the top 5/MVP level players but&hellip; He qualified for the Max so the only leverage the Wizard had was the NTC.</p>

<p>So I believe that any team that lets their max eligible player hit free agency and demand loyalty in the form of a team friendly deal will be demanded that loyalty back with the NTC or the player will walk for nothing.</p>

<p>If what people think is true is actually true, Harden basically couldn&rsquo;t say it publicly without risk of the NBA punishing the Sixers extremely hard and potentially voiding hardens contract.</p>

      <label for="lc77eqt" class="commentText"><p>I had a friend who worked for the NBA and it’s always so interesting to see how negotiations with players actually works. I was told when the Blazers started poorly (lot of injuries) in <sup>19</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> season, there were rumors of us going for Kevin Love. My friend was giving a ride to a media member who was close to Neil Olshey and they were laughing that Cavs GM asked for CJ + Collins + 3 1st round picks. Now if they were laughing it may have been a bit exaggerated. But it just makes sense that Clippers first offered 2/$60 just hoping PG would take it lol.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>True, but this only matters when you care about alienating the player. Obviously, the Clippers thought the risk of alienating PG was worth it.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that they didn&rsquo;t really want him unless it was on their terms.</p>

The deal will be bad at the end odds are Embiid&rsquo;s health/body won&rsquo;t have him playing at a high level anymore. Which is also why the Harden trade was so nice for us since we&rsquo;ll be resetting the team around Maxey and having those extra 1sts will help. They probably get traded before that to be honest, but they do fit the timeline if not.</p>

<p>As a player, hes probably closer to Harden (35m/yr) than Kawhi whereas Paul clearly wanted more, and nobody should blame him.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s definitely not good enough to warrant a NTC unless he&rsquo;s taking a pretty large hometown discount. That&rsquo;s an insanely unrealistic ask by him imo.</p>

I also think the clippers FO might have burned some serious good will with players after the Blake thing too so I&rsquo;d get being worried about promises from them</p>

<p>Yeah, the <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>60</sub> seems low but that&rsquo;s where you start when you begin negotiations&hellip; Plus, hell of a way to prove them wrong with a stinker of post season. Good luck in philly 🙌</p>

Whatever&rsquo;s left of Kawhi + whatever&rsquo;s left of Harden isn&rsquo;t doing much. They&rsquo;ll both be on the move at some point, cause the Clippers need to turn the page and get whatever draft picks they can. Paul George leaving for nothing has to sting considering what they gave up to get him.</p>

<p>PG asked for <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>150</sub> WIHTOUT the NTC after Kawhi got his deal and Clippers rejected that, which was January.</p>

<p>Clippers didn’t offer him the <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>150</sub> until the end of the year at which point he countered by asking for a NTC or full max, they rejected both. He didn’t initially ask to match Kawhi contract with a NTC attached to it, it’s a subtle difference but an important one.

      <label for="lc76585" class="commentText"><p>Clippers played this wrong, just match him and Kawhi from the beginning,  you lowballed him now he knows u don&rsquo;t really want him and a trade is near guaranteed in the pipeline, so he asks for 4 years or a NTC in the 3 year as tensions arise in negotiations</p>

<p>He seems honest and further in the interview he express he didn&rsquo;t want to leave, Clipped relied to much on PGs love for LA.</p>

<p>PG did avoid accountability for his playoff performance yet again but arguably the damage was already done, best for both to part ways</p>

      <label for="lc7axoi" class="commentText"><p>PG walking for nothing after the calling out the Clippers bluff is the actual result of Harden being in his ear all year. I mean I get the Clipper not wanting to add a NTC, odds are he is going to look rough in 3 years, but if you&rsquo;re gonna push that you want someone to retire there you gotta back it up.</p>

I&rsquo;m not talking about the money he eventually got after an efficient regular season and playing 74 games. If he had once again played less than 60 games no one in their right mind is giving him 50 mil a year. He would have been viewed as a 34 extremely injury prone and declining player.

I&rsquo;m literally talking about the BEGINNING of the season. The very first offer. 2 years 60 mil is a perfectly reasonable starting offer to a guy who over the course of the previous 4 season averaged 47.25 games a year. He had not played int he playoffs in two years due to injury. I am not saying <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>60</sub> is a good final offer for a guy coming off 74 games and efficient shooting year. So yes, muddyklux, use your brain. It&rsquo;s not that hard of a concept to grasp, but maybe it is for you.</p>
