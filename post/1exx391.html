      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1exx391/which_current_or_recently_retired_nba_players/"><p>Which current or recently retired NBA players will make fans 10+ years from now wonder “Why weren’t they a bigger deal” because of their counting stats?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I think a good example of this for a long-retired player is Alex English:</p>

<p>If you look at English’s stats, it’s very apparent he was a prolific NBA scorer. In fact, he scored the most total points in the NBA throughout the 1980s.</p>

<p>Why isn’t he a bigger deal? Despite his eye-popping scoring numbers, he was a poor defender who played the majority of his career with the Denver Nuggets (who had several of the worst defensive teams in NBA history during the ‘English Era’)</p>

<p>Zach Lavine has been positive in all of the last 6 years and has been above league average efficiency in every year of his career that he played at least half the season besides his rookie year (he was injured this year and <sup>2017</sup>&frasl;<sub>18</sub> and also had below average efficiency those years).</p>

<p>Zach Lavine was an efficient 20 point scorer with a positive impact* (per BPM) 5 times</p>

<p>If Zach Lavine was signed to a Derrick white like contract (31 mil a year) he would get shit on a lot less, but instead he gets paid 45 mil. I feel the same way about Beal.</p>

      <label for="lj9nqrj" class="commentText"><p>Oh I agree Zach Lavine is def not ever going to be considered when listing top 100 players of all time. This gen’s Alex English the closest thing I can think of is like Carmelo</p>

<p>Alex English was a 10 year volume scorer whose teams averaged about a 55% winning % made the conference finals once and the 2nd round 3 times 8 time all star 3x all nba 0 MVP</p>

<p>Carmelo Anthony was that but he sustained it for longer, Granted idk if I would consider Carmelo this era</p>

<p>As of rn the biggest volume scorer without playoff success is Donovan Mitchell (SGA and Brunson are still to early into stardom to count them). Booker could also fall into this but at least Booker has a finals appearance. And also already has 3 2nd rounds. Obvi Joel Embiid has had no playoff success but he has an mvp so I feel like it’s a different group also</p>

Also, even as a Monte hater, he put his tools together really well-simplifying it to great finisher/decent midrange shooter/elite first step understates his ability. That first step created separation, the threat of the layup caused defenders to give space, and the midrange was a great counter to defenders that took away the layup.</p>

<p>fun trivia fact that I don’t think many would guess: Mitchell is tied for 3rd all-time for 50-point playoff games, and he’s one of only 8 players in NBA history with multiple career 50-point playoff games. the other 7 are MJ, Wilt, Iverson, Tatum, Jamal Murray, Lillard and Jerry West</p>

<p>Alex English was an 8x All-Star (only 51 players have more). So we should be looking at All-Star level players who might end up being forgotten about.</p>

<p>FT % seems like one of those things, where once you are good, you should continue to be good at as there is not pressure and no time limitations on shooting. Seems like you&rsquo;d need a major arm/upper body injury that severely impacts your shooting form. I don&rsquo;t recall Westbrook having something like this late in his career.</p>

Nobody gives a fuck about usage rate when talking about who is good and who isn’t.. people have been defending Westbrook for over a decade. The reality is, he’s an insane athlete that lacks the motivation to play off ball defense and has an incredibly low offensive situational IQ.</p>

<p>But the stats show he is incredible and people will only get more adamant over time that Westbrook was one of the best to ever lace them up and shocked that he never won a championship.</p>

<p>already a 4x All-Star, 2x All-NBA player. 7 feet tall, 250 lb, athletic and strong and skilled, career <sup>23</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> averages on nearly 40% from 3 and 62.3 TS%, undoubtedly one of the best players in Wolves history. yet somehow, a guy with this player profile has never been a top 10 player and is arguably not even a top 25 player in today’s league</p>

<p>even today it’s strange to me that the reality of KAT doesn’t quite measure up to the concept of KAT. when people ask a decade from now why he wasn’t more highly regarded in his prime, we’ll talk about a guy who had tremendous talent and managed to prove that to an extent in the NBA, but could never figure out the mental side of the game enough to truly break into the upper echelon of stars</p>

KAT was the perfect answer for OP&rsquo;s question because he is one of the worst &ldquo;star/super star&rdquo; playoff performers of recent memory. Nobody cares about players that fill up the stat sheet during the regular season and then completely disappear during games that actually matter. Not to mention, despite KAT&rsquo;s superb career efficiency, he is also one of the dumbest IQ stars I can ever remember watching. He has continuously made losing play after losing play throughout his entire career and things that don&rsquo;t show up in the stat sheet.</p>

      <label for="lj9y0ud" class="commentText"><p>I thought this died after these playoffs. He shot 36% from 3 in 16 games last playoffs on 5 attempts, only shoots 35% in the playoffs for his career. If people wanna call him the greatest regular-season-3-point-shooting
-big of all time then sure, but Dirk runs circles around him as a shooter from the mid range and in games that actually have stakes. Dirk shot 40% from 3 in the playoffs during his 10 year prime.</p>

      <label for="lja1l5w" class="commentText"><p>Correct. Town&rsquo;s career isn&rsquo;t over either. Until last year, he never made it out of the first round. If he struggles over another couple deeper playoff runs, then I would agree he will never match Dirks pedigree. But I&rsquo;ll enjoy waiting and watching. Just a lifelong fan who is finally hyped about a team. Timberwolf fandom has been a dark place, for a long time. Excuse my excitability.</p>

      <label for="lj9t816" class="commentText"><p>KAT&rsquo;s not even going to get close to Dirk. His body is breaking down, topped 62 games once in the last five years (35 in covid year, so he wouldn&rsquo;t have broken 62 anyway). In the other four, in two of them he averaged 33 games.</p>

<p>The other thing is the concept of KAT will match reality if you consider that even conceptual, his defense sucks. If you watch him play defense it just doesn&rsquo;t make sense how someone who&rsquo;s played as much basketball as he has and is that athletic makes some of those mistakes.</p>

<p>edit: in fairness to KAT, his body breaking down is in large part due to him playing an extremely physical style when he started his career, as an undersized center no less. KAT is super tough but that&rsquo;ll hurt his career longevity.</p>

If you watched Kat against Jokic in the playoffs, he showed he could play defense. I haven&rsquo;t seen many play defense on Jokic like KAT did. But KAT will get DOGGED for his lack of defense? Haha had to do it. This is a reasonable take, didn&rsquo;t think about it that way. This is why I like constructive arguments, you learn something.</p>

The moment he leaves the Wolves his stats fall off a cliff and the only accolades are 2 All Star selections and a second place in 6th man of the year voting over 12 years. If someone comes across his stats in 10 years they&rsquo;ll certainly wonder why he went from <sup>26</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> one season to <sup>16</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> the next, but not why his career overall wasn&rsquo;t held in higher esteem. The counting stats just aren&rsquo;t there outside of those 3 great Wolves seasons.</p>

<p>This goes into the same bucket as the bullshit we kept hearing during the Olympics about FIBA having higher IQ players and better playstyles or whatever stupid shit people came up with to justify their weird hatred of the NBA. It makes no sense. This sub uses &lsquo;offball&rsquo; movement like it&rsquo;s a sign of knowing wtf they&rsquo;re talking about.</p>

<p>Two of the top 5 most iso-heavy teams made it to the Finals this season. You don&rsquo;t need pointless offball movement to be successful. Not every team is built like the Warriors with Draymond Green running the playmaking show and Klay taking attention off Steph - when has Trae ever had that type of talent and system around him?</p>

<p>And if you disagree with me, please note I used &lsquo;offball movement&rsquo; in my response to you so I&rsquo;m automatically smarter than everyone else in this sub.</p>

<p>You need a rim runner center who&rsquo;s an elite finisher, you need big guards who don&rsquo;t mind not having the ball in their hands and have to cover the other team&rsquo;s best perimeter player. You need a second star who sacrifices his offensive freedom and usage. Etc, etc. They&rsquo;re just hard players to build around and his advanced stats reflect that.</p>

      <label for="ljapdmh" class="commentText"><p>Alright, listen up, folks. Jerami Grant, man&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on with him. He&rsquo;s a talented dude, no doubt about it. But this guy&rsquo;s inconsistency is driving me absolutely bananas. One game, he&rsquo;s hitting threes like it&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s business, the next game he&rsquo;s airballing everything in sight. It&rsquo;s like watching a different player every night.</p>

<p>And let&rsquo;s talk about his defense. Used to be a lockdown guy, now he seems like he&rsquo;s just going through the motions. He&rsquo;s getting blown by, he&rsquo;s losing his assignments, it&rsquo;s a mess. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s confidence or effort or what, but something&rsquo;s gotta change.</p>

<p>Look, I&rsquo;m rooting for the guy. I want him to succeed. But this inconsistency is killing the team. We need him to be a reliable contributor, not a question mark every night. So get it together, Jerami. It&rsquo;s time to start playing like the player we all know you can be.</p>

Dame got all the credit that series for hitting the game winner, but the blazers were in that position becuase Lamarcus TORCHED both Dwight Howard and Omer Asik. In game one he did it down low in the post, then in game 2 the Rockets said &lsquo;Push him out further from the basket!&rsquo; which they did. He then torched them from midrange.</p>

      <label for="lj9u21v" class="commentText"><p>I think he can still improve, and he can still improve how people perceive him. I haven&rsquo;t watched his Toronto games, but coaching should have a huge impact on him given how big the difference is between his efficiency and effectiveness when he gets to his left hand versus going to his right. Plus he&rsquo;s young enough to improve skill-wise, though he needs to show improvement soon.</p>

Maybe it was just a matter of time given the usage they were carrying, but they really looked like they figured out how to be an impossible matchup.

<p>People forget how ridiculous he was in Minnesota.  He had a year of 2nd in RPG and 4th in PPG.<br>
Not to mention the more recognized part of his career as a legit big 3 in CLE championship.  Was able to move away from the basket and become a sniper as well.  One of the first 4&rsquo;s to reinvent his game with the times.  One of the original strech 4&rsquo;s.  Not to mention, still doing it on a pretty high level to this day.</p>
