      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1exx391/which_current_or_recently_retired_nba_players/"><p>Which current or recently retired NBA players will make fans 10+ years from now wonder “Why weren’t they a bigger deal” because of their counting stats?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I think a good example of this for a long-retired player is Alex English:</p>

<p>If you look at English’s stats, it’s very apparent he was a prolific NBA scorer. In fact, he scored the most total points in the NBA throughout the 1980s.</p>

<p>Why isn’t he a bigger deal? Despite his eye-popping scoring numbers, he was a poor defender who played the majority of his career with the Denver Nuggets (who had several of the worst defensive teams in NBA history during the ‘English Era’)</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, Monta is inefficient, but it didn’t stand out nearly as much back then lol</p>

<p>31% without the shortened line and his mid retirement, he could legit be a sub 30% 3 point shooter as the wear and tear added up.</p>

<p>If Zach Lavine was signed to a Derrick white like contract (31 mil a year) he would get shit on a lot less, but instead he gets paid 45 mil. I feel the same way about Beal.</p>

      <label for="lj9nqrj" class="commentText"><p>Oh I agree Zach Lavine is def not ever going to be considered when listing top 100 players of all time. This gen’s Alex English the closest thing I can think of is like Carmelo</p>

<p>Alex English was a 10 year volume scorer whose teams averaged about a 55% winning % made the conference finals once and the 2nd round 3 times 8 time all star 3x all nba 0 MVP</p>

<p>Carmelo Anthony was that but he sustained it for longer, Granted idk if I would consider Carmelo this era</p>

<p>As of rn the biggest volume scorer without playoff success is Donovan Mitchell (SGA and Brunson are still to early into stardom to count them). Booker could also fall into this but at least Booker has a finals appearance. And also already has 3 2nd rounds. Obvi Joel Embiid has had no playoff success but he has an mvp so I feel like it’s a different group also</p>

Also, even as a Monte hater, he put his tools together really well-simplifying it to great finisher/decent midrange shooter/elite first step understates his ability. That first step created separation, the threat of the layup caused defenders to give space, and the midrange was a great counter to defenders that took away the layup.</p>

<p>I’m not so sure time will be kind to wesybrook. When all fans see in 20 years in true shooting percentages, playoff stats, and usage rates I think they’ll talk or him being overrated</p>

Nobody gives a fuck about usage rate when talking about who is good and who isn’t.. people have been defending Westbrook for over a decade. The reality is, he’s an insane athlete that lacks the motivation to play off ball defense and has an incredibly low offensive situational IQ.</p>

<p>But the stats show he is incredible and people will only get more adamant over time that Westbrook was one of the best to ever lace them up and shocked that he never won a championship.</p>

<p>FT % seems like one of those things, where once you are good, you should continue to be good at as there is not pressure and no time limitations on shooting. Seems like you&rsquo;d need a major arm/upper body injury that severely impacts your shooting form. I don&rsquo;t recall Westbrook having something like this late in his career.</p>

<p>You need a rim runner center who&rsquo;s an elite finisher, you need big guards who don&rsquo;t mind not having the ball in their hands and have to cover the other team&rsquo;s best perimeter player. You need a second star who sacrifices his offensive freedom and usage. Etc, etc. They&rsquo;re just hard players to build around and his advanced stats reflect that.</p>

Doesn&rsquo;t need a bunch of ISO touches, low usage even when he&rsquo;s the first option, and is a legit sharpshooter from three (39.9% on 8.2 attempts last year). Lauri&rsquo;s also a very underrated, efficient rim runner and has a great touch in the paint.</p>

<p>already a 4x All-Star, 2x All-NBA player. 7 feet tall, 250 lb, athletic and strong and skilled, career <sup>23</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> averages on nearly 40% from 3 and 62.3 TS%, undoubtedly one of the best players in Wolves history. yet somehow, a guy with this player profile has never been a top 10 player and is arguably not even a top 25 player in today’s league</p>

<p>even today it’s strange to me that the reality of KAT doesn’t quite measure up to the concept of KAT. when people ask a decade from now why he wasn’t more highly regarded in his prime, we’ll talk about a guy who had tremendous talent and managed to prove that to an extent in the NBA, but could never figure out the mental side of the game enough to truly break into the upper echelon of stars</p>

Good people are hard to find but it doesn&rsquo;t help the ball legacy. Fans like assholes a la Jimmy Butler. Maybe that&rsquo;s why? Too add on Towns being a good dood&hellip;Paul George invited him to his wedding in Italy (I believe) and George said everyone there LOVED Towns. He didn&rsquo;t big time anyone. Sat down and talk/took pictures with everyone. Was basically the life of the party. I could live with that legacy.</p>

      <label for="lj9po9a" class="commentText"><p>You can&rsquo;t call yourself the greatest big man shooter of all-time and then shoot 38% from the field and 24% from three in a Conference Finals. KAT was the perfect answer for OP&rsquo;s question because he is one of the worst &ldquo;star/super star&rdquo; playoff performers of recent memory. Nobody cares about players that fill up the stat sheet during the regular season and then completely disappear during games that actually matter. Not to mention, despite KAT&rsquo;s superb career efficiency, he is also one of the dumbest IQ stars I can ever remember watching. He has continuously made losing play after losing play throughout his entire career and things that don&rsquo;t show up in the stat sheet.</p>

<p>When dirk came to the league teams took 13 3’s per game and now we‘re at 35</p>

<p>For KATs career that‘s 31,7
For Dirks career 20,2</p>

-big of all time then sure, but Dirk runs circles around him as a shooter from the mid range and in games that actually have stakes. Dirk shot 40% from 3 in the playoffs during his 10 year prime.</p>

      <label for="lj9t816" class="commentText"><p>KAT&rsquo;s not even going to get close to Dirk. His body is breaking down, topped 62 games once in the last five years (35 in covid year, so he wouldn&rsquo;t have broken 62 anyway). In the other four, in two of them he averaged 33 games.</p>

<p>The other thing is the concept of KAT will match reality if you consider that even conceptual, his defense sucks. If you watch him play defense it just doesn&rsquo;t make sense how someone who&rsquo;s played as much basketball as he has and is that athletic makes some of those mistakes.</p>

<p>edit: in fairness to KAT, his body breaking down is in large part due to him playing an extremely physical style when he started his career, as an undersized center no less. KAT is super tough but that&rsquo;ll hurt his career longevity.</p>

I haven&rsquo;t watched his Toronto games, but coaching should have a huge impact on him given how big the difference is between his efficiency and effectiveness when he gets to his left hand versus going to his right. Plus he&rsquo;s young enough to improve skill-wise, though he needs to show improvement soon.</p>

<p>People forget how ridiculous he was in Minnesota.  He had a year of 2nd in RPG and 4th in PPG.<br>
Not to mention the more recognized part of his career as a legit big 3 in CLE championship.  Was able to move away from the basket and become a sniper as well.  One of the first 4&rsquo;s to reinvent his game with the times.  One of the original strech 4&rsquo;s.  Not to mention, still doing it on a pretty high level to this day.</p>

He was not a worse defender than Larry Bird, Charles Barkley, Dominique Wilkins, Mark Aguirre, Adrian Dantley etc. It is more that he played in a second tier team in a smaller market at a time when the NBA was still not at the major league level in national TV.</p>
