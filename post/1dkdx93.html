<ul>
<li><p>at 26 will have the most wins in the league since his debut, despite being a relatively young draftee and most NBA careers starting slowly (even only counting regular season, he also edged Jokić by 1 game lately, he has a higher lead including playoffs)</p></li>

<li><p>will do that record while leading his team in minutes every season</p></li>

<li><p>arguably the best player of his team in that time basically all the time (I&rsquo;m saying arguably because people will argue anything and really who knows what &ldquo;best&rdquo; is&hellip; but I&rsquo;d say best)</p></li>

<p>2022 playoffs - Tatum 148 assists 100 turnovers 24 games</p>

<p>2024 playoffs - Tatum 119 assists 50 turnovers 19 games</p>

<p>The turnovers is what doomed them in 2022. Now that he can read the game better and make plays for his teammates while limiting the turnovers, it’s made a huge difference. Better reads means better offense, but it also means fewer live ball turnovers, which means less easy baskets for opposing team.</p>

      <label for="l9hztmy" class="commentText"><p>He’s closer to Lebron than people like to admit. Lebron is known for being the “27/7/7” guy and Tatum just averaged 27/7/5 this season (30/8/4.5 last year). His passing is not quite Lebron level but it’s underrated. Both guys can defend a wide variety of positions at a very high level. Both can score inside, from midrange, and from 3. Both are seeing a ton of double teams as a point-forward and asked to be a playmaker.</p>

<p>He’s not as athletic as prime LeBron and will never be as good a player. But whether he’s modeling his game after Lebron or not, he’s playing a very similar style.</p>

<p>The point was more about the balance – LeBron’s greatness isn’t from scoring. It’s that he did everything. Tatum is in the same mold. Like adjusted for era, Tatum would be like 24/7/4, which again, is not the same level as Lebron but is still a really well rounded stat line.</p>

<p>He absolutely is not. He&rsquo;s learned to become an effective passer when making basic reads using his gravity, Lebron is an offense unto himself (and guys like Luka and Jokic). 5 assists in the modern NBA just means that you&rsquo;re primary offensive option who can consistently make basic reads.</p>

<p>Joel Embiid averaged 5.6 assists this season, does he play like Lebron too?</p>

      <label for="l9i8ww9" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s hard to say whether releasing some of the pressure will help his shooting.  I do think the best thing he can do is develop a reliable mid-range move in the offseason.  He basically didn&rsquo;t post-up at all in the playoffs, and if he doesn&rsquo;t get a lay-up, he doesn&rsquo;t have that 8-foot pull-up a lot of those guys feast on.</p>

<p>Basically, it&rsquo;s bizarre for a guy who has been a consistent 27-30ppg players for several years now, that he really doesn&rsquo;t have a signature move.  The closest is the step-back, and I think even he admits that&rsquo;s not reliable right now.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

      <label for="l9i4kl5" class="commentText"><p>For sure. That said, it&rsquo;s good to keep in mind that while Tatum impacted the game in a lot of ways (scoring, rebounding, defense), his biggest contribution in the Mavs series was his gravity. Mavs were all but tripling him and he was able to create offensive opportunities out of that very regularly, making the correct decisions. People get caught up in scoring too easily, Tatum played VERY well in the playoffs and finals. Only reason fmvp really went to Jaylen was his elite defense on Luka imo</p>

It&rsquo;d be better if you filter on high usage players, i.e. what is the plus/minus of those players that is often involved in plays on the floor: <a href="https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=top+plus+minus+in+2024+playoffs+with+usage+rate+above+25%25" target="_blank">https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=top+plus+minus+in+2024+playoffs+with+usage+rate+above+25%25</a></p>

<p>2024: Tatum +147, Luka +97</p>

<p>2023: Murray +181, Jokic +169</p>

<p>2022: Curry +121, Tatum +108</p>

<p>2021: Giannis: +130, Embiid +121</p>

<p>2020: Davis: +184, Lebron +165</p>

<p>One player we are discussing has been to 5 CF.</p>

<p>The other 0.</p>

<p>And bozos like you try to make excuses for all his playoff exits. And downplay all of Tatum’s playoff successes.</p>

<p>Maybe your dipshit Twitter troll big man isn’t the sort of leader that a playoff team needs.</p>

<p>I’ll take Tatum who has been a consummate pro over the goofy poor diet dumbass who falls all over the court any day.</p>

<p>“One player(s team) we are discussing has been to 5 CF.”</p>

<p>“The other(s team) 0”</p>

<p>Funny enough, zero is the amount of finals mvp and number of times tatums performed as the number one player on a championship team. Any Tatum fan using goofy to put another player down is hilarious considering he has the cringiest in finals history</p>

<p>I mean not really. He was up 3-2 on the Celtics last year and completely choked it for his team.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>His +/- stats are heavily influenced by the sixers not putting a lot of money into the backup center position and instead sinking it into having very good starters.</p>

      <label for="l9i1bc3" class="commentText"><p>Embiid in 2019 wasnt half the &ldquo;dominant scorer&rdquo; in fact he was mostly an allstsr for his defensive presence and was #2 in DPOY voting.</p>

<p>The sixers won by 10 in 45 minutes he played. Over the whole series he was +89. What more do you want???</p>

<p>Again, in the Hawks series the Sixers won by 53 when he played. How much does he need to do to compensate for a godawful team? He needs to beat the opponent by 25  every game so he can sit for 5 minutes? how fkn unrealistic is that?</p>

I guess you could say that Butler and Embiid were both frauds and the role players themselves had a better chance fo beat us no? Going back to +/- Embiid was +10. I hate the sixers too but let&rsquo;s be honest. He&rsquo;s still an amazing player that&rsquo;s at worst top 4 in the world. He&rsquo;s still relevant to this era, And the raptors defense were hard on Embiid, like they were against Giannis in the next round.</p>

And 2021, are we REALLY gonna blame it on Embiid when Ben Simmons in Game 7 had only 5 points on 4 shots?

      <label for="l9ig8o1" class="commentText"><p>Its not about whether a loss is on him or not, because there&rsquo;s a lot of losses that are on Embiid (2023 Game 7 immediately comes to mind) however to blame 2019 on Embiid when EVERYONE shot badly that game is disingenuous. Are we also gonna blame Butler who was 5 for 14, or Redick who was 5 for 11, or Ben Simmons only shooting 5 times in 42 minutes as well? Or does all the blame exclusively go towards Embiid when Butler also shot 1 for 6 from 3? Not just exclusive to Philly, Kawhi was 16 for 39, Lowry was 4 for 13, Siakam was 4 for 11. So Embiid isn&rsquo;t the only bad shooting outlier in this game. Embiid has been a MAJOR victim of circumstance which limits him going to a ECF (Kawhi luckt bounce, Ben Simmons poor shooting, Philly not paying Butler but paying Harris) and its incredibly unfair to him to scrutinize him for things he has no hand in when his teammates are also underperforming, when he&rsquo;s doing great (Game 7 2021 ECSF vs Atlanta with Harris going 8-24 and Ben Simmons 4 shots)</p>

Hold everyone to the same standard. Embiid shot bad, but don&rsquo;t just disregard that literally everyone else but Serge Ibaka shot terribly that game, just because they were guarded by Butler, Siakam, Simmons, or Kawhi.

      <label for="l9i7vn3" class="commentText"><p>So when Tatum has bad scoring numbers but good plus minus stats, it shows he impacts the game in so many ways, but for embiid he’s still a bum? Embiid was +89 for the entire series btw, he has one of the best plus minus portfolios in playoff history. You’re basically just picking and choosing when you think plus minus is good or not based on whether you like the player in question. If the Celtics continually fell apart with Tatum off the court to the degree the 6ers have with embiid off the floor than Tatum probably wouldn’t have gotten to the conference finals either</p>

<p>Bucks game 6. Sixers game 7.</p>

<p>I think he’s actually a lot better this season in terms of +/- so a lot of the good Celtics lineups include him now (as opposed to previous years where the Celtics best lineups were the starters-Jaylen+a bench guy).</p>

      <label for="l9jh7sm" class="commentText"><p>If we’re being technical, the stat of interest here should be +/- divided by games (or ideally, minutes), not just total plus/minus.</p>

<p>That said, Tatum still leads +/- per game for all players who played &amp;gt;15 min per game in the playoffs (+7.7).  Although to be fair, he is tied with Embiid.  The next three are Jrue, Holmgren, and Horford.</p>

<p>PS.  Personally I’ve always thought +/- should also have a small normalization for the average plus/minus of all other teammates, ideally weighted by shared court time with the player in question.  But the crude version would just be an adjustment for your team’s net rating at all times that you’re not on the floor.  This would help to resolve the obvious bias toward players on good teams and make it more about the individual player’s impact.  But that’s another conversation.</p>

      <label for="l9h6y7k" class="commentText"><p>Jokic was 169 to Gordon at 187. Not a big divide like we are seeing with Jaylen and Tatum.</p>

<p>Jaylen and Tatum share a ton of time together on the court. But clearly when one is on and one is off, the team is doing a lot better with Tatum than with Jaylen.</p>

<p>Tatum was +147 and Jaylen +88. Both of these guys played roughly 40 minutes per game.</p>

<p>If you adjust on a per minute basis it’s .19 for Tatum and .12 for Jaylen. That’s about a 50% difference</p>

<p>You care to share photos of yourself a rundown of what makes you so dope?</p>

<p>Secondly a lot of players say or do a few things you could label as corny. Who cares. They are recorded and interviewed constantly. Anyone who is documented that often is not going to appear cool at every last moment.</p>

<p>I don’t follow any athletes on social media. I don’t care what they wear pregame. None of that matters to me. I watch the games. That’s what I give a shit about. You dorks are so obsessed with all the extra stuff.</p>

<p>In 2022 playoffs Tatum had 148 assists and 100 turnovers over 24 games</p>

<p>In 2024 playoffs Tatum had 119 assists and 50 turnovers over 19 playoff games</p>

<p>He’s made huge strides in being able to read the defenses and break things down without getting stripped, while spotting which passing lanes are opening and closing.</p>

<p>If anything if there were a lot of blowouts and the +/- was low that would show that the lead wasn’t built when they were on the court.</p>

<p>But a +147 over 19 games is +7.7 per game which is quite high.</p>

<p>Tatum was a +147 playing 768 minutes = .19 per min</p>

<p>Jaylen was a +88 playing 707 minutes = .12 per min</p>

<p>Why didn’t Jaylen’s plus minus get inflated in a similar fashion to Tatum’s?</p>

<p>Is it possible that Tatum had highest plus minus on team because he was the team’s best and most valuable player?</p>

<p>Tatum 2022 playoffs - 148 assists 100 turnovers in 24 games</p>

<p>Tatum 2024 playoffs - 119 assists 50 turnovers in 19 games</p>

<p>Jaylen 3.3 assists per game 2.7 turnovers</p>

<p>Tatum 6.3 assists per game 2.6 turnovers</p>

<p>You sub Herro in and you lose defense, size on rebounding, playmaking, etc.</p>

<p>You bozos really can’t grasp how vital Tatum is because all you understand is points and FG%</p>
