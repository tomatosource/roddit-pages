<p>For example LeBron James was shooting 47% in the 2015 Finals and it was described as playing absolutely phenomenally and being by far the best player in the league (which had been a bit doubted before those finals).</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s be honest NBA culture is purely about amount of shooting, not percentage of makes.</p>

His playmaking was fantastic, I&rsquo;ve watched him his whole career and never thought he&rsquo;d be able to run an offense this well. He had 9 assists in the first half of Game 5 if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, for a PG that would be awesome, for a scoring forward like Tatum it&rsquo;s insane, has any other forward done something like that recently in the Finals? Probably have to go back to LeBron.</p>

<p>I guess if you left out the part about leading their team in scoring, assists, and rebounds, sure.</p>

<p>But I would turn it around&ndash;you seem to be implying most stars would average more because they were surrounded by less talent. Ok, great. I think everyone agrees with that.</p>

<p>So why are you <em>less</em> impressed by him because he&rsquo;s surrounded by a good team and thus his PPG is depressed?</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s still the best player on a stacked team and leading his team in all three counting stats. The fact that he&rsquo;s doing that on one of the best teams of all time seems like it should be more of a positive than a negative, but people seem to be acting like it&rsquo;s a bad thing?</p>

      <label for="l9iachk" class="commentText"><p>lol you imply his PPG cause he wasn’t shooting, no he was just inefficient as hell. Still shot ~20fga and ~5fta per game.</p>

<p>List of scoring leaders from the last 8 champs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>2024, Celtics, Tatum: 22.2ppg on 50.5%TS</p></li>

<li><p>2023, Nuggets, Jokic: 30.2ppg on 67.2%TS</p></li>

<li><p>2022, Warriors, Curry: 31.2ppg on  62.6%TS</p></li>

<li><p>2021, Bucks, Giannis: 35.2ppg on 65.8%TS</p></li>

<li><p>2020, Lakers, Lebron: 29.8ppg on 67.1%TS</p></li>

<li><p>2019, Raptors, Kawhi: 28.5ppg on 60.6%TS</p></li>

<li><p>2018, Warriors, KD: 28.8ppg on 65.4%TS</p></li>

<li><p>2017, Warriors, KD: 35.2ppg on 69.8%TS</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Tatum is the only one below 28ppg OR 60%ts and he was all the way down at 22ppg and 50%ts. Reality is he had the worst STAR performance of any championship winning team in a very long time, and got carried by his TEAM far more than any other star has had the fortune of having.</p>

<p>So you&rsquo;re arguing he wouldn&rsquo;t shoot more if he had worse teammates? He clearly would score more, regardless of his TS%. TS% is not the end-all of metrics. His PPG would still go up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reality is he had the worst STAR performance of any championship winning team in a very long time, and got carried by his TEAM far more than any other star has had the fortune of having.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s certainly a take to say that the player on a team that literally led his team in points, rebounds, <em>and</em> assists was &ldquo;carried by his team more than any other star.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l9hztmy" class="commentText"><p>He’s closer to Lebron than people like to admit. Lebron is known for being the “27/7/7” guy and Tatum just averaged 27/7/5 this season (30/8/4.5 last year). His passing is not quite Lebron level but it’s underrated. Both guys can defend a wide variety of positions at a very high level. Both can score inside, from midrange, and from 3. Both are seeing a ton of double teams as a point-forward and asked to be a playmaker.</p>

<p>He’s not as athletic as prime LeBron and will never be as good a player. But whether he’s modeling his game after Lebron or not, he’s playing a very similar style.</p>

      <label for="l9i64yu" class="commentText"><p>Absolutely. Like I said, he’ll never be as good as Lebron.</p>

<p>The point was more about the balance – LeBron’s greatness isn’t from scoring. It’s that he did everything. Tatum is in the same mold. Like adjusted for era, Tatum would be like 24/7/4, which again, is not the same level as Lebron but is still a really well rounded stat line.</p>

<p>He absolutely is not. He&rsquo;s learned to become an effective passer when making basic reads using his gravity, Lebron is an offense unto himself (and guys like Luka and Jokic). 5 assists in the modern NBA just means that you&rsquo;re primary offensive option who can consistently make basic reads.</p>

<p>Joel Embiid averaged 5.6 assists this season, does he play like Lebron too?</p>

      <label for="l9hvial" class="commentText"><p>The biggest improvement either player made in recent years is Tatum with his decision making.</p>

<p>2022 playoffs - Tatum 148 assists 100 turnovers 24 games</p>

<p>2024 playoffs - Tatum 119 assists 50 turnovers 19 games</p>

<p>The turnovers is what doomed them in 2022. Now that he can read the game better and make plays for his teammates while limiting the turnovers, it’s made a huge difference. Better reads means better offense, but it also means fewer live ball turnovers, which means less easy baskets for opposing team.</p>

Instead, he&rsquo;s taking what the defense gives the team which is open looks for his teammates.    People were crying about how he sucked when he only put up 16-18 points, ignoring the fact that he was a black hole sucking defenders in AND making the correct passes to maximize TEAM output.</p>

      <label for="l9i8ww9" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s hard to say whether releasing some of the pressure will help his shooting.  I do think the best thing he can do is develop a reliable mid-range move in the offseason.  He basically didn&rsquo;t post-up at all in the playoffs, and if he doesn&rsquo;t get a lay-up, he doesn&rsquo;t have that 8-foot pull-up a lot of those guys feast on.</p>

<p>Basically, it&rsquo;s bizarre for a guy who has been a consistent 27-30ppg players for several years now, that he really doesn&rsquo;t have a signature move.  The closest is the step-back, and I think even he admits that&rsquo;s not reliable right now.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

That said, it&rsquo;s good to keep in mind that while Tatum impacted the game in a lot of ways (scoring, rebounding, defense), his biggest contribution in the Mavs series was his gravity. Mavs were all but tripling him and he was able to create offensive opportunities out of that very regularly, making the correct decisions. People get caught up in scoring too easily, Tatum played VERY well in the playoffs and finals. Only reason fmvp really went to Jaylen was his elite defense on Luka imo</p>

<p>I mean not really. He was up 3-2 on the Celtics last year and completely choked it for his team.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>worst franchise ever caused this</p>

<p>His +/- stats are heavily influenced by the sixers not putting a lot of money into the backup center position and instead sinking it into having very good starters.</p>

<p>The sixers won by 10 in 45 minutes he played. Over the whole series he was +89. What more do you want???</p>

<p>Again, in the Hawks series the Sixers won by 53 when he played. How much does he need to do to compensate for a godawful team? He needs to beat the opponent by 25  every game so he can sit for 5 minutes? how fkn unrealistic is that?</p>

I guess you could say that Butler and Embiid were both frauds and the role players themselves had a better chance fo beat us no? Going back to +/- Embiid was +10. I hate the sixers too but let&rsquo;s be honest. He&rsquo;s still an amazing player that&rsquo;s at worst top 4 in the world. He&rsquo;s still relevant to this era, And the raptors defense were hard on Embiid, like they were against Giannis in the next round.</p>

I love Kawhi as a player but let&rsquo;s be honest, he got a INCREDIBLY lucky bounce at the end of Game 7 which won it. And 2021, are we REALLY gonna blame it on Embiid when Ben Simmons in Game 7 had only 5 points on 4 shots? I&rsquo;m all for the slander when a player completely underperforms but you have to add the context of what happened for them to not succeed.</p>

      <label for="l9ig8o1" class="commentText"><p>Its not about whether a loss is on him or not, because there&rsquo;s a lot of losses that are on Embiid (2023 Game 7 immediately comes to mind) however to blame 2019 on Embiid when EVERYONE shot badly that game is disingenuous. Are we also gonna blame Butler who was 5 for 14, or Redick who was 5 for 11, or Ben Simmons only shooting 5 times in 42 minutes as well? Or does all the blame exclusively go towards Embiid when Butler also shot 1 for 6 from 3? Not just exclusive to Philly, Kawhi was 16 for 39, Lowry was 4 for 13, Siakam was 4 for 11. So Embiid isn&rsquo;t the only bad shooting outlier in this game. Embiid has been a MAJOR victim of circumstance which limits him going to a ECF (Kawhi luckt bounce, Ben Simmons poor shooting, Philly not paying Butler but paying Harris) and its incredibly unfair to him to scrutinize him for things he has no hand in when his teammates are also underperforming, when he&rsquo;s doing great (Game 7 2021 ECSF vs Atlanta with Harris going 8-24 and Ben Simmons 4 shots)</p>

Hold everyone to the same standard. Embiid shot bad, but don&rsquo;t just disregard that literally everyone else but Serge Ibaka shot terribly that game, just because they were guarded by Butler, Siakam, Simmons, or Kawhi.

      <label for="l9i7vn3" class="commentText"><p>So when Tatum has bad scoring numbers but good plus minus stats, it shows he impacts the game in so many ways, but for embiid he’s still a bum? Embiid was +89 for the entire series btw, he has one of the best plus minus portfolios in playoff history. You’re basically just picking and choosing when you think plus minus is good or not based on whether you like the player in question. If the Celtics continually fell apart with Tatum off the court to the degree the 6ers have with embiid off the floor than Tatum probably wouldn’t have gotten to the conference finals either</p>

      <label for="l9il9zy" class="commentText"><p>That’s because Jaylen is unable to run an offense so he’s pretty much garbage when he’s playing without Tatum.</p>

<p>I think he’s actually a lot better this season in terms of +/- so a lot of the good Celtics lineups include him now (as opposed to previous years where the Celtics best lineups were the starters-Jaylen+a bench guy).</p>

<p>Doesn’t mean I was not happy for Brown as a person to have won the award. I would have been happy with any of our players winning. That would mean we advanced.</p>

<p>Meanwhile you are a Pats fan posting on the Celtics sub bashing Tatum and saying Mavs would win in 7. You are a biased dipshit.</p>

      <label for="l9hm06u" class="commentText"><p>Well for one. A lot of the people calling him corny are probably lame/corny/dorky themselves so it’s kind of a joke.</p>

<p>You care to share photos of yourself a rundown of what makes you so dope?</p>

<p>Secondly a lot of players say or do a few things you could label as corny. Who cares. They are recorded and interviewed constantly. Anyone who is documented that often is not going to appear cool at every last moment.</p>

<p>I don’t follow any athletes on social media. I don’t care what they wear pregame. None of that matters to me. I watch the games. That’s what I give a shit about. You dorks are so obsessed with all the extra stuff.</p>

      <label for="l9h6y7k" class="commentText"><p>Jokic was 169 to Gordon at 187. Not a big divide like we are seeing with Jaylen and Tatum.</p>

<p>Jaylen and Tatum share a ton of time together on the court. But clearly when one is on and one is off, the team is doing a lot better with Tatum than with Jaylen.</p>

<p>Tatum was +147 and Jaylen +88. Both of these guys played roughly 40 minutes per game.</p>

<p>If you adjust on a per minute basis it’s .19 for Tatum and .12 for Jaylen. That’s about a 50% difference</p>

<p>If anything if there were a lot of blowouts and the +/- was low that would show that the lead wasn’t built when they were on the court.</p>

<p>Tatum was a +147 playing 768 minutes = .19 per min</p>

<p>Jaylen was a +88 playing 707 minutes = .12 per min</p>

<p>Why didn’t Jaylen’s plus minus get inflated in a similar fashion to Tatum’s?</p>

<p>Is it possible that Tatum had highest plus minus on team because he was the team’s best and most valuable player?</p>

<p>I love Jaylen. Amazing second option. Never once advocated for him to be traded. But what Tatum provides on the playmaking side in addition to his scoring is what puts him at a different level.</p>

<p>Jaylen is able to thrive in his role and score more efficiently because the main playmaking duties are on Tatum’s shoulders. Even Jrue and White averaged more assists per game than Jaylen this run. Jaylen has a very simplified role on offense. He executes it quite well. But he’s not as good as Tatum.</p>

<p>Jaylen was a +88 for the run.</p>

<p>It’s clear as day to those who actually pay attention to this team that Tatum is the engine of the offense and the most important player. Couldn’t win it without Jaylen, he was super valuable and played amazing this run, but Tatum is the best player.</p>
