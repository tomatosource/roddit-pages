<p>Warner has a lot less to lose here though.  If they win a lawsuit NBA is going to have to pay them a fortune.  If they lose it, they&rsquo;re basically out legal costs.  But this is going to take years to solve.</p>

      <label for="levnngk" class="commentText"><p>Yeah the main issue with WB is just that they are in so much debt right now, that I don&rsquo;t know if they will want to risk paying insane attorneys&rsquo; fees if they lose.  Because of their debt, my guess is that they don&rsquo;t really have a massive group of lawyers on retainer anymore (at least compared to what they normally had). </p>

<p>On the other hand, the NBA&rsquo;s legal team is always locked and loaded and ready to go.  I did a Clerkship for the NBA one summer during Law School (but for Copyright Law), and the number of lawyers there was pretty insane. </p>

      <label for="levung8" class="commentText"><p>I just mean with the amount of debt that WB-Discovery has (something around 40 Billion), my guess is that one of the first costs they cut was the legal team on retainer. Obviously they still definitely have a large legal team and they can still afford to hire the attorneys if this issue is really important for them, I&rsquo;m just not sure if the issue will be worth it to them, when weighing the potential cost/ benefit. </p>

<p>With the NBA, I just mostly know that they keep a lot of firms on retainer because I worked at one. They have a large in-house team, and then they kept a lot of different specialized firms on retainer. Also the NBA does a lot of work with Contracts (as does WB of course). This specific issue with another TV Network might be rare, but the type of law involved is not a unique issue.</p>

<p>I’m just a stupid dummy but it feels to me like maybe this one will end up in contact law books somewhere down the road</p>

<p>What Warner will be suing for are the financial damages to their business for not having the games.  Like if their contract cost <span class="math inline">\(10B and they argue/determine that they would bring in \)</span>15B from the games, then $5B is their damages.  (Actual amount could be much higher, but that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;d be fighting over)</p>

      <label for="lev0a76" class="commentText"><p>It’s hard to imagine that “matching” means that TNT gets to pick which rights package they get to match. Their prior rights package went to NBC, not Amazon, so TNT is saying “oh, we’re matching Amazon”, but the more expensive package is the one it seems they’re entitled to match. None of us know, though, and clearly the NBA and TNT disagree with each other, so this is going to court (or the threat thereof).</p>

<p>TNT never had rights to match all broadcasting - only the rights to match their own share.  And the NBA didn&rsquo;t do this new agreement in a clean way that just kept everything the same except they swapped in NBC for exactly what TNT had.  NBC now also has streaming rights to additional games, they&rsquo;ve added a whole new streaming partner in Amazon, and who knows all the billions of tiny details that have changed.</p>

      <label for="lev0zmn" class="commentText"><p>Warner though has experience in this arena.</p>

<p>In 2008, Warner was sued by 20th Century Fox over claims that WB violated Fox&rsquo;s rights over distribution and profits for the then upcoming Zack Snyder film WATCHMEN.</p>

<p>The root of the lawsuit was that Fox was the original home of the film adaptation as far back as 1991.  When the project got pushed into turnaround in 1994, producer Lawrence Gordon then executed a deal to buy the rights from Fox so he could shop the IP by himself, eventually landing at Warner Bros.</p>

<p>However, this deal apparently contained clauses related to Fox&rsquo;s right to be compensated for development costs and right to first participation should &ldquo;any creative elements of the project be changed&rdquo; - which Fox argued would have included themselves and Zack Snyder in spite the film having no director attached in the 1990&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Drama in the lawsuit included Fox claiming it placed a phone call to Warner in 2005 warning them of Fox&rsquo;s rights to which WB representatives denied that any of them had answered a phone call from 20th Century Fox. There was also correspondence with producer Lloyd Levin that revealed WB and Fox had actually met directly with producers of WATCHMEN around 2005 where Fox clearly stated it was not interested in making what it called an &ldquo;unintelligible story&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The end result of all this, of course was that Fox and WB agreed to share WATCHMEN. Fox got around 8% of the film&rsquo;s global gross + 10m USD but in exchange would waive any rights over the WATCHMEN film (and any future sequels) to Warner.</p>

      <label for="levov4s" class="commentText"><p>Turner just pissing more money away. My take is that if Zaslav hadn&rsquo;t pissed everyone off the NBA would have taken a &ldquo;close enough&rdquo; approach and stuck with them.  Instead everyone hates this guy and the NBA probably took the approach of trying to find any minor detail in their offer that did not exactly match what Amazon proposed just so they could reject it.</p>
