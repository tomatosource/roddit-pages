<p>In almost any contract, matching is referring to money, but I suppose the NBA was vague enough that they’ll argue WBD would have to match the global reach of Amazon.</p>

      <label for="leuy3hl" class="commentText"><p>Yeah it will be something like that. In the NBA rejection they claimed that WBD &ldquo;failed to match the terms&rdquo; of the Amazon offer. That can be anything including pledged payment periods being off by one day or something. 😆</p>

      <label for="lev0a76" class="commentText"><p>It’s hard to imagine that “matching” means that TNT gets to pick which rights package they get to match. Their prior rights package went to NBC, not Amazon, so TNT is saying “oh, we’re matching Amazon”, but the more expensive package is the one it seems they’re entitled to match. None of us know, though, and clearly the NBA and TNT disagree with each other, so this is going to court (or the threat thereof).</p>

      <label for="lev0zmn" class="commentText"><p>Warner though has experience in this arena.</p>

<p>In 2008, Warner was sued by 20th Century Fox over claims that WB violated Fox&rsquo;s rights over distribution and profits for the then upcoming Zack Snyder film WATCHMEN.</p>

<p>The root of the lawsuit was that Fox was the original home of the film adaptation as far back as 1991.  When the project got pushed into turnaround in 1994, producer Lawrence Gordon then executed a deal to buy the rights from Fox so he could shop the IP by himself, eventually landing at Warner Bros.</p>

<p>However, this deal apparently contained clauses related to Fox&rsquo;s right to be compensated for development costs and right to first participation should &ldquo;any creative elements of the project be changed&rdquo; - which Fox argued would have included themselves and Zack Snyder in spite the film having no director attached in the 1990&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Drama in the lawsuit included Fox claiming it placed a phone call to Warner in 2005 warning them of Fox&rsquo;s rights to which WB representatives denied that any of them had answered a phone call from 20th Century Fox. There was also correspondence with producer Lloyd Levin that revealed WB and Fox had actually met directly with producers of WATCHMEN around 2005 where Fox clearly stated it was not interested in making what it called an &ldquo;unintelligible story&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The end result of all this, of course was that Fox and WB agreed to share WATCHMEN. Fox got around 8% of the film&rsquo;s global gross + 10m USD but in exchange would waive any rights over the WATCHMEN film (and any future sequels) to Warner.</p>
