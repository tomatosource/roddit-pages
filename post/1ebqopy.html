<p>In almost any contract, matching is referring to money, but I suppose the NBA was vague enough that they’ll argue WBD would have to match the global reach of Amazon.</p>

<p>Warner has a lot less to lose here though.  If they win a lawsuit NBA is going to have to pay them a fortune.  If they lose it, they&rsquo;re basically out legal costs.  But this is going to take years to solve.</p>

      <label for="levnngk" class="commentText"><p>Yeah the main issue with WB is just that they are in so much debt right now, that I don&rsquo;t know if they will want to risk paying insane attorneys&rsquo; fees if they lose.  Because of their debt, my guess is that they don&rsquo;t really have a massive group of lawyers on retainer anymore (at least compared to what they normally had). </p>

<p>On the other hand, the NBA&rsquo;s legal team is always locked and loaded and ready to go.  I did a Clerkship for the NBA one summer during Law School (but for Copyright Law), and the number of lawyers there was pretty insane. </p>

      <label for="levung8" class="commentText"><p>I just mean with the amount of debt that WB-Discovery has (something around 40 Billion), my guess is that one of the first costs they cut was the legal team on retainer. Obviously they still definitely have a large legal team and they can still afford to hire the attorneys if this issue is really important for them, I&rsquo;m just not sure if the issue will be worth it to them, when weighing the potential cost/ benefit. </p>

<p>With the NBA, I just mostly know that they keep a lot of firms on retainer because I worked at one. They have a large in-house team, and then they kept a lot of different specialized firms on retainer. Also the NBA does a lot of work with Contracts (as does WB of course). This specific issue with another TV Network might be rare, but the type of law involved is not a unique issue.</p>

<p>What Warner will be suing for are the financial damages to their business for not having the games.  Like if their contract cost <span class="math inline">\(10B and they argue/determine that they would bring in \)</span>15B from the games, then $5B is their damages.  (Actual amount could be much higher, but that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;d be fighting over)</p>

      <label for="lew2gff" class="commentText"><p>Well according to WBD, they executed their contractual right to match the offer. Similar to a restricted free agent who wants to test the market and then the team matches the offer. So per WBD, they didn’t have to agree to a new deal because they could just match one of the offers afterwards. Now that NBA has declined their alleged matching offer, they will sue the NBA for breach of contract. The damages from a breach of contract is the amount of money necessary to put the non breaching party in the position they would have been in had the contract been performed (i.e., profit [revenue - cost of contract]).</p>

<p>It’s definitely not a shit business practice to potentially win all the benefit of having the contact while not actually having to pay for the new deal, but it would maybe be sleazy if they never had intentions to actually match and knew the nba would decline their matching rights. But that isn’t a consideration in corporate litigation. So WBD is looking at a potential billion$+ windfall.</p>

<p>The contract interpretation of the matching rights language compared to the matching offer will be handled in court.</p>

      <label for="lew5ew8" class="commentText"><p>I mean ultimately that depends on the stubbornness of the NBA and WB and what exactly WB is looking for (assuming the rest of the contract doesn&rsquo;t make the meaning of the word &ldquo;matching&rdquo; obvious and clear).  </p>

<p>Also while I&rsquo;m assuming that WB is just looking for damages, if they are genuinely only interested in getting the distribution rights and are going after performance on the contract, settling may not be enough for them. Although, I imagine they&rsquo;ll be fine with a settlement.</p>

      <label for="lew924p" class="commentText"><p>The contract interpretation of the matching provision compared to the alleged matching offer will be for the courts. But specific performance on breach of contract is almost never available when money damages is a remedy, so this will most likely be a money matter (e.g., breach of contract for like a house sale can sometimes be forced because no 2 properties are similar, but all money is green. This is business contract for profit.) regardless, I have no doubt WB will ask for specific performance for distribution anyways, and they can obviously agree to whatever in a settlement.</p>

<p>I doubt this sniffs trial because neither of these parties would have any tolerance for a multi billion dollar gamble on the outcome of the trial, stubborn or not. The way the case progresses will dictate the strength of either side for settlement negotiations.</p>

Their prior rights package went to NBC, not Amazon, so TNT is saying “oh, we’re matching Amazon”, but the more expensive package is the one it seems they’re entitled to match. None of us know, though, and clearly the NBA and TNT disagree with each other, so this is going to court (or the threat thereof).</p>

      <label for="levjdur" class="commentText"><p>Well it&rsquo;s not that simple, because the structure isn&rsquo;t the same as last time. This entire fight is going to be about &ldquo;what is matching?&rdquo; - and the answer is probably super vague in the existing agreement.</p>

<p>TNT never had rights to match all broadcasting - only the rights to match their own share.  And the NBA didn&rsquo;t do this new agreement in a clean way that just kept everything the same except they swapped in NBC for exactly what TNT had.  NBC now also has streaming rights to additional games, they&rsquo;ve added a whole new streaming partner in Amazon, and who knows all the billions of tiny details that have changed.</p>

One company “matching” the cost-for-cost construction of a billboard isn’t the same if one company can plop it down in Times Square and another company in Albuquerque.</p>

      <label for="levbo3p" class="commentText"><p>I would think matching would refer to all the other stipulations of the contract as well wouldn&rsquo;t it? Amazon is going to be exclusively streaming games, it sounds like WB wants to pay for the same games but still put them on TNT which is a fundamentally different proposition.</p>

      <label for="lev0zmn" class="commentText"><p>Warner though has experience in this arena.</p>

<p>In 2008, Warner was sued by 20th Century Fox over claims that WB violated Fox&rsquo;s rights over distribution and profits for the then upcoming Zack Snyder film WATCHMEN.</p>

<p>The root of the lawsuit was that Fox was the original home of the film adaptation as far back as 1991.  When the project got pushed into turnaround in 1994, producer Lawrence Gordon then executed a deal to buy the rights from Fox so he could shop the IP by himself, eventually landing at Warner Bros.</p>

<p>However, this deal apparently contained clauses related to Fox&rsquo;s right to be compensated for development costs and right to first participation should &ldquo;any creative elements of the project be changed&rdquo; - which Fox argued would have included themselves and Zack Snyder in spite the film having no director attached in the 1990&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Drama in the lawsuit included Fox claiming it placed a phone call to Warner in 2005 warning them of Fox&rsquo;s rights to which WB representatives denied that any of them had answered a phone call from 20th Century Fox. There was also correspondence with producer Lloyd Levin that revealed WB and Fox had actually met directly with producers of WATCHMEN around 2005 where Fox clearly stated it was not interested in making what it called an &ldquo;unintelligible story&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The end result of all this, of course was that Fox and WB agreed to share WATCHMEN. Fox got around 8% of the film&rsquo;s global gross + 10m USD but in exchange would waive any rights over the WATCHMEN film (and any future sequels) to Warner.</p>

My take is that if Zaslav hadn&rsquo;t pissed everyone off the NBA would have taken a &ldquo;close enough&rdquo; approach and stuck with them.  Instead everyone hates this guy and the NBA probably took the approach of trying to find any minor detail in their offer that did not exactly match what Amazon proposed just so they could reject it.</p>

      <label for="lex1704" class="commentText"><p>For people who are wondering: didn’t TNT match Amazon’s offer? I thought I heard they did earlier this week.
WBD (WarnerBrothersDiscovery, the parent company of TNT) has claimed they matched Amazon’s offer. The NBA has claimed it did not because (per the NBA) WBD’s payment for the first 3 years will be funded via credit lines while Amazon’s payment for the first 3 years will directly come from Amazon (most likely via cash). WBD has threatened a lawsuit which will be interesting since they are covering the NBA in 2024-25 (Charles’ jokes will be 🔥 if a lawsuit were to happen; he’s retiring anyway). WBD (and its previous incarnations: i.e. AOLTjmeWarner) could point out that they previously paid the NBA using credit/loans and the NBA had no issue then. How the WBD will match Amazon’s offer is irrelevant-all that matters is that WBD matches Amazon?
The NBA has a good argument though: WBD has a lot of debt (this is well documented via various news outlets and their own financial statements) and the fact that they must use credit to match Amazon’s offer suggests that WBD might not actually be able to pay the obligations they are to owe the NBA if the NBA accepts WBD’s offer.
Lawsuits are very expensive and David Zaslav (CEO of WBD) has a very important decision to make: do you sue the NBA for specific performance (force them to accept your offer) and settle for a reduced package with a lesser bill? Is it because the NBA brings in more money via advertising than what you are paying the NBA, the talent (i.e. Broadcasters, studio hosts, production crew, musicians, etc), and the infrastructure costs (i.e. cameras, travel bills, heating/electricity for studio J)? Is this number greater than what the legal bills will be? Will it be worth it to have “dirty laundry” aired it in court and legal documents that will exist forever (i.e. How much debt WBD owes? How often they have used credit to pay obligations?) and might hurt the stock price and the ability for the company to acquire/merge/borrow in the future?
This is why David Zaslav as CEO of WBD is paid the big bucks to make these decisions.</p>
