      <label for="l8q4yat" class="commentText"><p>I highly doubt he gets past the first round. The Knicks have back to back picks at the end of the first round and cap space to spare. The Twolves or Nuggets could easily draft him at picks 27 or 28. In such a weak draft, it doesn’t make sense not to draft him. The chance at Lebron is much more rewarding than whoever they would normally draft.</p>

      <label for="l8q6b4n" class="commentText"><p>It honestly makes a lot of sense to pick Bronny in the late 20s. Lebron can take a good team and make them finals contenders. Thats better than what 90% of rookies will do in their career that late in the draft. I think the Suns would be all over him at 22, they have to win with this core and no one they pick will see real minutes for a couple years when the core is even older.</p>

<p>than it is for a team to sign Lebron if they draft bronny.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If PG and AD can force their teams to trade them, then LeBron definitely can.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do people actually think Lebron is just going to sign with whatever team drafts his son?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why not? He&rsquo;s already accomplished all there is to do as a basketball player, except for that.</p>

<p>Say he goes to a middling team to play with Bronny and they go 41-41 and lose in the play-in. Is that gonna make any difference to his legacy compared to going 45-37 in LA and losing in the 1st round?</p>

<p>In 20 years, is LeBron gonna look back on a 45-37 season as a treasured memory? Because I guarantee he would treasure the memory of playing with his son, for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>Plus life is short. Everybody thought Kobe would be around to watch Gianna grow up. There was speculation he might take a HS coaching job to coach her, and who knows - maybe even coach in the WNBA if she made it.</p>

<p>And then one day, poof, it&rsquo;s all gone.</p>

<p>And if anyone realizes that, it&rsquo;s LeBron and Bronny - kid already had a damn cardiac arrest.</p>

      <label for="l8t8amb" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think he will sign with whatever team drafts his son, but it’s a pretty no brainer move to take LeBron’s kid because if nothing else you can hold him as a trade hostage and force whatever team LeBron is playing for to give you higher draft picks, talent or cash.</p>

<p>I think that might be an issue for a few teams though because they have already mortgaged future picks and don’t have anything to offer.</p>

<p>I could also see a team taking him hoping to court LeBron but acting like they don’t care about signing LeBron, so he has to come take a league minimum contract lol.</p>

      <label for="l8rjxoq" class="commentText"><p>If the team that drafts Bronny can&rsquo;t get LeBron, presumably LeBron would be interested in leveraging a trade to get Bronny on whatever roster he winds up on. That means Bronny could have outsize trade value relative to his draft position and talent. So for the team that drafts Bronny, it&rsquo;s win-win to take a swing and see what happens, especially in such a weak draft.</p>

<p>Bronny is run by rich Paul.</p>

<p>Bronny is going where team James wants him to go. This is not a choice for teams beyond their consent.</p>

<p>If you go against the mob, understand that you pay the price. Suns know. They shit on earl Watson and then didn&rsquo;t sniff a single rich Paul client for a decade.</p>

<p>Everything is already set up, the pieces just gotta move. I don&rsquo;t know what that plan is, but I&rsquo;m quite certain that this plan is pretty solid by now.</p>

<p>My guess - bronny is picked 17th,and the next day it is announced that LeBron signed a 3 yr/165M extension. Everyone happy and they all gaslight that this was in any way setup by the mob.</p>

<p>The Heat can easily draft him at 15, the 76ers at 16 and say, that’s fine if you don’t want to sign Lebron, the team you want to go to will have to trade assets for your son. It only takes 1 team to pull the trigger, not all 30 teams. Especially if that GM doesn’t like Rich Paul and wants to stick it him. Rich Paul has no control. And they don’t care about his future clients. That only hurts Rich Paul from signing new clients in the future. I’d want an agent who has good relationships with all 30 teams, not just some of them.</p>

<p>Is it though? Is a year or two of an aging star who is going to completely dominate your team&rsquo;s identity better than a chance at someone who could be a key rotation player or starter for two full contracts? I know most people will say &ldquo;draft bad&rdquo; but there isn&rsquo;t much indication that picks 20 and on project to be far worse than an average draft.</p>

      <label for="l8ta3ka" class="commentText"><p>These are facts. I hate seeing all the idiots in this thread acting like LeBron isn&rsquo;t still a winning player averaging a very efficient 25/7/8 while shooting the best he ever has. If he goes to a team that already has a good 1st and 2nd option, such as Philly, Phoenix, or NY, he could be the piece that gets them a ring and at a minimum he&rsquo;s getting them better seeing and further into the playoffs.</p>

<p>Also I hate seeing all the people talking about trades and saying that teams can&rsquo;t LeBron. He has until June 29th to opt out and be a free agent. The draft is the 26th and 27th. Money isn&rsquo;t gonna be a concern if he wants to play with his son. He can sign for the minimum, he&rsquo;s already the richest player in the NBA by a lot.</p>

      <label for="l8rkqd1" class="commentText"><p>Although there are plenty of impactful players who were taken late in the first round or later, on average a late first rounder doesn&rsquo;t amount to much of anything. That consideration seems to be heavily magnified in this draft class in particular, which is supposed to be so weak. So there wouldn&rsquo;t be much opportunity cost for a team to take a gamble on Bronny and see if that gives leverage to either acquire LeBron, or flip Bronny to another LeBron-hungry team for a value that would be much higher than a late first rounder in this draft.</p>

<p>Bronny is trying to become the next Alex Caruso, which is the perfect type of player to be molded alongside Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo.</p>

      <label for="l8qi8c0" class="commentText"><p>I’ll actually disagree here. It’s a pretty weak draft. Bronny was really good coming out of high school, he’s a plus athlete, good ball handler and facilitator, great defender and good enough shooter.</p>

<p>He sucked at USC but that’s pretty easily explained by the heart attack and not playing basketball until December.</p>

<p>I think first round is a reach, but he’s worth a second round pick even when not considering who his father is. If you can get him back to how he was looking coming out of high school, there’s a potential high quality 3 and D type player there, and he’d be worth a second round pick to find out. He legitimately had very solid potential coming out of high school.</p>

The issue is he is 6&rdquo;1&rsquo;, horribly inefficient, with a center-like 67 FT percentage, and a 36% field goal percentage. I understand he had a heart attack, but that just means he has health issues on top of being a poor player. He is not worth a pick, even in bad draft.</p>

But the point is that the value of this pick wouldn&rsquo;t come from the player himself. He&rsquo;s a &ldquo;get LeBron&rdquo; lottery ticket that the team that drafts him can either try to use for itself or trade to another team for value.</p>

      <label for="l8r173q" class="commentText"><p>6’7 wingspan makes up for the height, and wingspan is far more important for defense than height. He was also one of the best backcourt defenders in high school in his class, like top 3 defensively. So it’s not just theoretical.</p>

<p>You can’t take anything from his year at USC. Heart attack in the summer and didn’t practice until December. Of course he was going to be inefficient. You’re looking solely at his high school tape and athleticism and banking on getting back to form.</p>

<p>And we’re talking second round which is a lottery any way, particularly in a bad draft. Bronny’s ceiling is solid for a second round pick type if you think you can get him back to it. If he has a clean bill of health, he’s worth a second rounder and it wouldn’t even be controversial if he wasn’t LeBron’s son.</p>

You can’t take anything from his year at USC because of the heart attack. If he passes all physicals, then his ceiling is still what it was post-high school.</p>

<p>On3 ranked him as the 11th overall prospect his year, if you want to pretend he doesn’t have a high ceiling, fine, believe what you want.</p>

<p>But he absolutely has a high ceiling. Sure, his floor is low but so is every second round prospect’s, it’s why they’re second rounders. Hes worth a flier late round pick.</p>

<p>The fact you say his ceiling isn’t high tells me you never watched his high school film.</p>

<p>Call me delusional all you want, but I’ve watched Bronny in person twice, I watched every game televised for Sierra Canyon and as much of his AAU film that’s available. I actually have an informed opinion on him as a prospect and think he’s clearly worth a second round pick based on what he’s shown in the past.</p>

<p>Instead of throwing baseless insults, actually state argument. The problem is, you can’t. Like too many people these days you want to speak confidently on something you know nothing about.</p>

Because unlike the NFL draft, almost none of these guys are going to be impact players from day 1, so as a fan, any interest I have is tempered by the fact that watching a player&rsquo;s first 2 years is 100x more interesting than draft hype. And when there&rsquo;s a prospect like Vic, it&rsquo;s the lottery that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>

<p>Of course, this attitude would have left me opening reddit the next morning and finding out two teams passed on Luka, which would have been interesting in it&rsquo;s own kind of way 😂</p>

<p>LeBron has actively walked back his comments on wanting to play with his son all year.</p>

<p>Even if LeBron has intent to move teams, the NBPA will not let him sign a vet min or anything under a max contract.</p>

<p>The route to get LeBron to play with his son barring the Lakers picking him is entirely unrealistic.</p>

      <label for="l8qiueq" class="commentText"><p>Eh just depends on where in the draft. First round? I agree with you. Second? Disagree. Bronny showed legitimate potential in high school. Plus athlete, good defender, good facilitator and good enough shooter. Has the potential of being a high quality 3 and D type player. If you think his heart issues are behind him, he’d be worth a second round pick to see if you can unlock his potential.</p>

<p>Second round picks are super cheap, and very rarely work out any way. Bronny had potential as a first round guy coming out of high school, admittedly needing a couple years. The heart attack set him back but I could understand using a second round pick during a weak draft to buy low on Bronny now, even forgetting who his dad is.</p>

<p>I agree that you have to do some imagining of what he can be but again, we’re talking a second round pick here which are basically worthless. Hes got more potential than most if you can get him in the second. Now, like I said, anything before like pick 35, I agree it’s a waste. But after that, in a weak draft, taking Bronny is worth seeing if you can get him back on the trajectory he was on end of his high school career.</p>

<p>The NBA doesn&rsquo;t ignore college tape in favor of HS tape and even with all the extenuating circumstances Bronny was a 4 star guy, not some elite recruit. Bronny also is undersized as well.</p>

<p>Realistically a guy like that not only doesn&rsquo;t get drafted but doesn&rsquo;t even consider entering the draft. He transfers and rebuild his stock in his sophomore year.</p>

      <label for="l8qqe0x" class="commentText"><p>Huh? The NBA certainly has ignored college tape for high school tape before, particularly in prospects later in the draft. Patrick Baldwin Jr, for instance, was drafted in the first round entirely based on his high school tape.</p>

<p>Emoni Bates last year wouldn’t have been drafted if not for his stellar high school years.  Definitely happens.</p>

<p>It’s also obviously more likely to happen in extenuating circumstances where there is an easy explanation for the bad play.</p>

<p>Also, Bronny was a five star, he was the 22nd overall prospect on 247Composite, which averages all the major rankings. In individual sites, On3 had him ranked as high as 11th.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t necessarily call him undersized. He’s 6’3 with a 6’7 wingspan and has the frame to add muscle. Hes not a jumbo guard by any means but he isn’t little.</p>

<p>So I just have to disagree with you, in large part because you’re just wrong on your facts regarding his high school ranking and size. Its a weak draft, Bronny was a high level prospect coming out of high school, and it would make a ton of sense for a team to buy low with a typically worthless second round pick on a guy who fits his profile. Worst case scenario, he busts like 95% of second picks. Best case, he lives up to his five star potential.</p>

Also, composite scores are kind of a joke. There are really only 3 places people look (who all had him as a 4 star) and 247 clearly is the dominant force. This also ignores the elephant in the room that his stock was likely bolstered because of his Dad.</p>

<p>Also if you want to talk about Baldwin and Bates both those guys were top 5 recruits and started in college. I don&rsquo;t know why you think Bronny deserves to be compared to them.</p>

      <label for="l8qyspo" class="commentText"><p>6’1.5 without shoes but 6’3 in shoes, which is how colleges and NBA has commonly measured. But it’s his wingspan which is most important, any way, and that’s 6’7. Wingspan is far more important than height for defense.</p>

<p>And composite scores are a joke? Lol come on man, composite scores are obviously the best way to rank by averaging all the major rankings to get the least biased outcome.</p>

<p>It’s also obvious to me you don’t know much about ranking services by calling 247 the clear dominating force, when their best staff members have all left for On3, including their top basketball guys. If any service right now is the “best,” On3 has by far the strongest claim (but you’ll likely disagree, conveniently, seeing as On3 had the highest opinion of Bronny).</p>

<p>By saying that there are only 3 places people look and excluding On3 as one of those (which you’re doing by saying the 3 places look all had Bronny as a four star), you clearly don’t know anything about the high school ranking services. Even then, every service had him as a top-30 prospect.</p>

<p>I don’t think his stock was particularly bolstered by his dad as he actually fell in the rankings throughout the process until he did well his junior season and then excelled in the AAU circuit leading into his final year of high school.</p>

<p>And my point with Bates and Baldwin was that the NBA does ignore college tape in favor of high school tape at times, something you claimed they don’t do even with extenuating circumstances. Yet we have two quick and easy examples just in the last couple of drafts that prove your point incorrect.</p>

<p>There are clear reasons why, even without his last name, Bronny would be worth a second round pick in this draft. I don’t even think it would be particularly controversial if his dad wasn’t LeBron. This draft sucks. Bronny was a very good prospect coming out of high school with solid 3andD potential and great athleticism. If he’s healthy, big if, using a second round pick on him wouldn’t be controversial, it would be a standard roll of the dice in the round where 95% of picks bust any way. Youre trying to deny the real potential he had coming out of high school, while I’m guessing you never watched any of his AAU tape or anything.</p>

      <label for="l8r1hd7" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not denying he has potential to make it to the NBA but it&rsquo;s silly to say that he deserves to get drafted based on his present body of work. You&rsquo;re completely ignoring that he even the most favorable service towards him did not have him as a can&rsquo;t-miss recruit and that he isn&rsquo;t anywhere near as special as you think physically. Those other two guys were special players in high school and have great physical traits that teams were willing to take fliers on them.</p>

<p>How many defense-first PGs who are a straight-up liability on offense do you see drafted after their freshman year? Like I said, those guys don&rsquo;t even declare for the draft. And even his defense isn&rsquo;t NBA-ready yet.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love if you could objectively explain Bronny&rsquo;s fit in the NBA rather than just hurling insults because I&rsquo;m not sold on your favorite player&rsquo;s kid</p>

      <label for="l8r4v7l" class="commentText"><p>Nobody is a can’t miss prospect. The most favorable service had him at 11th overall, that’s really good and a likely one and done guy.</p>

<p>And again we are talking about the second round. You’re acting like I’m arguing he should be a top 10 pick.</p>

<p>The second round is already a lottery in a good draft, let alone one this bad. 95% of the picks won’t be in the League in four years, and
Bronny showed more potential this time last year than pretty much anyone getting selected after pick 35. Dude would not be a controversial late round flier at all if his dad wasn’t LeBron, but too many people like you never watched a second of his tape but want to pretend his accolades are all because of his dad.</p>

<p>I haven’t hurled a single insult like you claim, unless you think pointing out your clear lack of knowledge on a topic you are trying to speak confidently on is an insult? I mean, claiming 247 is the most dominant recruiting service and saying On3 isn’t a place people look just immediately outs you as not knowing what you are talking about. That isn’t an insult, it’s just the truth. Or calling you out for clearly not watching any of his AAU or high school tape but trying to talk about him as a high school prospect? Please point out the insult I’ve hurled your way.</p>

<p>Again, Bronny was not a liability on offense lol Bronny was a plus shooter in high school, who was an unselfish player and good facilitator. He was a top 3 backcourt defensive player in his entire high school class. He fits the mold of a potential high level 3 and D shooter, as I’ve said, who can work mostly off ball but can give you some on ball facilitating when needed. Plenty of guys around his size have carved out careers in these roles: Derrick White, Gary Harris, De’Anthony Melton, DiVincenzo, Seth Curry, Malik Beasley, Grayson Allen, Quentin Grimes, etc. just off the top of my head, all guys worth more than a single second round pick to trade for.</p>

<p>Basing it on his high school tape, which you have to do, it’s easy to see why a team would draft him as a flier in a weak draft. The clay is there to be molded into a quality player.</p>

<p>You can say his defense isn’t ready but of course it isn’t, almost no college freshman’s is but plenty have gotten picked because of the flashes they show on that end (Max Christie, for instance). Any young player involves projecting to what they will be, not what they currently are. Bronny was in contention for best backcourt defender in his high school class, he was a menace on that end.</p>

<p>But once more, looking at what he was in high school, a plus athlete, good shooter, good passer, unselfish, and a top 3 backcourt defender in his entire class, it’s easy to see why he is worth a second round pick, even if you want to continue denying it because you think it’s nepotism.</p>

<p>Lebron isn’t my favorite player. I like him, but I’m not defending Bronny because of him. I think too many people are like you who very clearly did not watch Bronny at all in high school and want to act like the discussion around him is all nepotism. There is a lot to legitimately like about him and he has a real NBA ceiling, he’s likely worth a second round pick to see if you can tap into what he was on track to becoming. I find the discourse around him to be filled with people who don’t know much of what they’re talking about who want to hate on him because of who is dad is, yet don’t actually know anything about him beyond looking at some box scores or recruit rankings which does lead to me defending him more than I would like, but it’s because too many want to talk about him without diving into his film.</p>

      <label for="l8r99h1" class="commentText"><p>Lol you keep saying I lack knowledge because I disagree with your very subjective take on Bronny which you based entirely on his high school career when we&rsquo;ve seen countless other people with better high school careers and traits not even make it to the NBA.</p>

<p>IMO he looked good enough in high school to go D1 but I thought at his best he&rsquo;d be an end of the bench guy. Regardless of what I think he&rsquo;ll get drafted and we&rsquo;ll find out very quickly if he&rsquo;s the underrated gem you think he is or if this was the biggest case of nepotism in NBA history like I think.</p>

<p>I say you lack knowledge because it is evident you have never watched Bronny’s high school film or AAU tape, and you probably never watched him at USC either.</p>

<p>I don’t care if someone disagrees with me, but I do care that people don’t speak on things they haven’t learned. The moment you tried to imply On3 isn’t used was the moment it was clear you don’t pay attention to high school recruiting and just don’t know what you’re talking about on this subject.</p>

      <label for="l8qhxo8" class="commentText"><p>This is what he&rsquo;s talking about. Rivers was an actual good player in college and an elite high school recruit. Lee had a solid college career and was a UDFA who worked his way into being a rotational player. The only one who didn&rsquo;t deserve any shot to even get in the league was Blevins who is literally called Big Nepo. And even there at least he was undrafted and later given a two way contract.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why you act like nepotism was cool before this. Also you ignore the scope of nepotism at play. We&rsquo;re talking legitimate first round buzz for an undersized guard who rode the bench on a terrible college team.</p>

<p>I know this is a weak draft. He also was on bad team and couldn’t shoot straight. He is not a playmaker in the least. His best trait is defense and he is not particularly tall.  There is potential in theory, but if he was James Brony he wouldn’t even be discussed as higher than 50.</p>
