      <label for="l8q4yat" class="commentText"><p>I highly doubt he gets past the first round. The Knicks have back to back picks at the end of the first round and cap space to spare. The Twolves or Nuggets could easily draft him at picks 27 or 28. In such a weak draft, it doesn’t make sense not to draft him. The chance at Lebron is much more rewarding than whoever they would normally draft.</p>

      <label for="l8q6b4n" class="commentText"><p>It honestly makes a lot of sense to pick Bronny in the late 20s. Lebron can take a good team and make them finals contenders. Thats better than what 90% of rookies will do in their career that late in the draft. I think the Suns would be all over him at 22, they have to win with this core and no one they pick will see real minutes for a couple years when the core is even older.</p>

Playing with his son is priceless to him, Im not saying its happening but you really think Lebron would pass up a chance in PHX to team with KD and his son. Have a chance at a title and fulfill his biggest dream. Im not saying its a lock but I think if a real contender drafts bronny there is a really good chance Lebron follows. Now if like Indiana drafted him I doubt he would go there.</p>

      <label for="l8qi8c0" class="commentText"><p>I’ll actually disagree here. It’s a pretty weak draft. Bronny was really good coming out of high school, he’s a plus athlete, good ball handler and facilitator, great defender and good enough shooter.</p>

<p>He sucked at USC but that’s pretty easily explained by the heart attack and not playing basketball until December.</p>

<p>I think first round is a reach, but he’s worth a second round pick even when not considering who his father is. If you can get him back to how he was looking coming out of high school, there’s a potential high quality 3 and D type player there, and he’d be worth a second round pick to find out. He legitimately had very solid potential coming out of high school.</p>

Maybe 11 of those 2nd round picks will ever sniff a 6th man or staring position, most will play in the g league so they can maybe develop. Picking bronny in the 2nd round is no different than Ulrich comche. </p>

      <label for="l8q6fho" class="commentText"><p>Seems like the most interesting draft pick in a while. Because unlike the NFL draft, almost none of these guys are going to be impact players from day 1, so as a fan, any interest I have is tempered by the fact that watching a player&rsquo;s first 2 years is 100x more interesting than draft hype. And when there&rsquo;s a prospect like Vic, it&rsquo;s the lottery that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>

<p>Of course, this attitude would have left me opening reddit the next morning and finding out two teams passed on Luka, which would have been interesting in it&rsquo;s own kind of way 😂</p>

<p>I know this is a weak draft. He also was on bad team and couldn’t shoot straight. He is not a playmaker in the least. His best trait is defense and he is not particularly tall.  There is potential in theory, but if he was James Brony he wouldn’t even be discussed as higher than 50.</p>

      <label for="l8qiueq" class="commentText"><p>Eh just depends on where in the draft. First round? I agree with you. Second? Disagree. Bronny showed legitimate potential in high school. Plus athlete, good defender, good facilitator and good enough shooter. Has the potential of being a high quality 3 and D type player. If you think his heart issues are behind him, he’d be worth a second round pick to see if you can unlock his potential.</p>

<p>Second round picks are super cheap, and very rarely work out any way. Bronny had potential as a first round guy coming out of high school, admittedly needing a couple years. The heart attack set him back but I could understand using a second round pick during a weak draft to buy low on Bronny now, even forgetting who his dad is.</p>

<p>I agree that you have to do some imagining of what he can be but again, we’re talking a second round pick here which are basically worthless. Hes got more potential than most if you can get him in the second. Now, like I said, anything before like pick 35, I agree it’s a waste. But after that, in a weak draft, taking Bronny is worth seeing if you can get him back on the trajectory he was on end of his high school career.</p>

<p>The NBA doesn&rsquo;t ignore college tape in favor of HS tape and even with all the extenuating circumstances Bronny was a 4 star guy, not some elite recruit. Bronny also is undersized as well.</p>

<p>Realistically a guy like that not only doesn&rsquo;t get drafted but doesn&rsquo;t even consider entering the draft. He transfers and rebuild his stock in his sophomore year.</p>

      <label for="l8qqe0x" class="commentText"><p>Huh? The NBA certainly has ignored college tape for high school tape before, particularly in prospects later in the draft. Patrick Baldwin Jr, for instance, was drafted in the first round entirely based on his high school tape.</p>

<p>Emoni Bates last year wouldn’t have been drafted if not for his stellar high school years.  Definitely happens.</p>

<p>It’s also obviously more likely to happen in extenuating circumstances where there is an easy explanation for the bad play.</p>

<p>Also, Bronny was a five star, he was the 22nd overall prospect on 247Composite, which averages all the major rankings. In individual sites, On3 had him ranked as high as 11th.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t necessarily call him undersized. He’s 6’3 with a 6’7 wingspan and has the frame to add muscle. Hes not a jumbo guard by any means but he isn’t little.</p>

<p>So I just have to disagree with you, in large part because you’re just wrong on your facts regarding his high school ranking and size. Its a weak draft, Bronny was a high level prospect coming out of high school, and it would make a ton of sense for a team to buy low with a typically worthless second round pick on a guy who fits his profile. Worst case scenario, he busts like 95% of second picks. Best case, he lives up to his five star potential.</p>

Also, composite scores are kind of a joke. There are really only 3 places people look (who all had him as a 4 star) and 247 clearly is the dominant force. This also ignores the elephant in the room that his stock was likely bolstered because of his Dad.</p>

<p>Also if you want to talk about Baldwin and Bates both those guys were top 5 recruits and started in college. I don&rsquo;t know why you think Bronny deserves to be compared to them.</p>

      <label for="l8qhn2z" class="commentText"><p>Austin Rivers never lived up to his lottery selection, but he had a solid and lengthy nba career.</p>

<p>And you also used Damion Lee as an example when he literally went undrafted.</p>

<p>And rivers high school career blows Bronnys out of the water. Thru HS and college, Rivers was a much better player.</p>

<p>literally also proving my point w/ Damion Lee</p>

      <label for="l8qibct" class="commentText"><p>Rivers earned his draft status by being a fantastic HS and college player. You are clearly struggling to see my point</p>

<p>And I’m not proving your point with Lee. His draft status wasn’t boosted inorganically (like bronnys) so he went undrafted.</p>

<p>You’re struggling to see where the nepotism plays a part.</p>

      <label for="l8qhxo8" class="commentText"><p>This is what he&rsquo;s talking about. Rivers was an actual good player in college and an elite high school recruit. Lee had a solid college career and was a UDFA who worked his way into being a rotational player. The only one who didn&rsquo;t deserve any shot to even get in the league was Blevins who is literally called Big Nepo. And even there at least he was undrafted and later given a two way contract.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why you act like nepotism was cool before this. Also you ignore the scope of nepotism at play. We&rsquo;re talking legitimate first round buzz for an undersized guard who rode the bench on a terrible college team.</p>
