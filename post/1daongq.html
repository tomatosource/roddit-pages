      <label for="l7mf94e" class="commentText"><p>This comparisons unfair in a lot of ways.</p>

<ul>
<li>Brunson benefitted statistically extremely from so many players being out particularly Randle. Literally no one else in the NYK offense is dribbling besides attacking close outs. He still shot lights out sure but continuing on&hellip;</li>
<li>Kyrie played way tougher defenses. OKC and Minny were the 1 and 2 seed in the West..Brunson beat the 7th? Seed and then feasted on Indiana which has not been known for defense this year</li>
<li>most importantly all the playoffs aside Kyrie is playing beside Luka and consciously letting Luka be the #1. Brunson looked the same as Kyrie - even worse because he is way less creative in how he dissects offenses - when he was in Dallas and he wouldn&rsquo;t look like he is now if he stayed. He always popped off when Luka was sitting but they were never a great match together at the time</li>
<li>all things said I think they are equal right now and fit different teams. Brunson is a great shot maker but Kyrie dissects defenses way more dynamically. Different strokes.</li>

      <label for="l7maygy" class="commentText"><p>Well the question <em>here</em> is if he&rsquo;s a better player than Kyrie, which he is at this point.</p>

<p>And also I&rsquo;d argue that he was already quietly turning into one of the best scoring guards in Dallas, his problem there was that he was behind Luka and half a season of Porzingis.</p>

<p>In the first round vs the Jazz when Luka was hurt for half the series and then played hurt, he put up 27.8 PPG on 58.3% TS, which is pretty much what he&rsquo;s done in his two years in NY.</p>

      <label for="l7m7vsm" class="commentText"><p>We offered him a below what was his maximum for an extension once, following his 8p, 2.6r, 1.4a showing in the 2021 playoffs, for rather obvious reasons. I don’t think there is many teams in the league that would have given nearly $14m a year to an undersized PG who averaged 8/3/1 the previous postseason.</p>

<p>However, when he showed improvement we offered him the maximum we could, 4yr/$55m, and by that time he and his agent correctly realized he was worth more, as he was now averaging 16/4/5 while maintaining great efficiency despite a massive usage increase. We weren’t allowed to offer more than that until he officially hit free agency the following offseason. He was scheduled to meet with the team the day before FA began, but he instead canceled the meeting and flew to New York.</p>
