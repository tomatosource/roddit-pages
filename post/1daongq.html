      <label for="l7maygy" class="commentText"><p>Well the question <em>here</em> is if he&rsquo;s a better player than Kyrie, which he is at this point.</p>

<p>And also I&rsquo;d argue that he was already quietly turning into one of the best scoring guards in Dallas, his problem there was that he was behind Luka and half a season of Porzingis.</p>

<p>In the first round vs the Jazz when Luka was hurt for half the series and then played hurt, he put up 27.8 PPG on 58.3% TS, which is pretty much what he&rsquo;s done in his two years in NY.</p>

      <label for="l7mf94e" class="commentText"><p>This comparisons unfair in a lot of ways.</p>

<ul>
<li>Brunson benefitted statistically extremely from so many players being out particularly Randle. Literally no one else in the NYK offense is dribbling besides attacking close outs. He still shot lights out sure but continuing on&hellip;</li>
<li>Kyrie played way tougher defenses. OKC and Minny were the 1 and 2 seed in the West..Brunson beat the 7th? Seed and then feasted on Indiana which has not been known for defense this year</li>
<li>most importantly all the playoffs aside Kyrie is playing beside Luka and consciously letting Luka be the #1. Brunson looked the same as Kyrie - even worse because he is way less creative in how he dissects offenses - when he was in Dallas and he wouldn&rsquo;t look like he is now if he stayed. He always popped off when Luka was sitting but they were never a great match together at the time</li>
<li>all things said I think they are equal right now and fit different teams. Brunson is a great shot maker but Kyrie dissects defenses way more dynamically. Different strokes.</li>

      <label for="l7ndtqx" class="commentText"><p>Philadelphia was only a 7th seed because of Embiid’s injury though, they were like a top 3-4 seed when he was healthy. Everyone thought that the 76ers was a bad “reward” for being a top 2 seed in the East</p>

<p>Embiid was still going through it though I’ll say.</p>

<p>I actually think Kyrie is probably the better fit with Luka especially as the older veteran leader of the team. With that said Brunson would have been cheaper at the same time which would give the Mavs a lot more flexibility to build the team up.</p>

      <label for="l7m7vsm" class="commentText"><p>We offered him a below what was his maximum for an extension once, following his 8p, 2.6r, 1.4a showing in the 2021 playoffs, for rather obvious reasons. I don’t think there is many teams in the league that would have given nearly $14m a year to an undersized PG who averaged 8/3/1 the previous postseason.</p>

<p>However, when he showed improvement we offered him the maximum we could, 4yr/$55m, and by that time he and his agent correctly realized he was worth more, as he was now averaging 16/4/5 while maintaining great efficiency despite a massive usage increase. We weren’t allowed to offer more than that until he officially hit free agency the following offseason. He was scheduled to meet with the team the day before FA began, but he instead canceled the meeting and flew to New York.</p>

<p>And just to be clear, I’m not saying anything remotely negative about Brunson at all. But the idea that he was a burgeoning superstar, even just All-Star caliber player and our front office lowballed him just isn’t true.</p>

<p>So weird reading these kinds of comments. Maybe you should have a look at the polling on this:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/2024/03/21/majority-in-u-s-say-israel-has-valid-reasons-for-fighting-fewer-say-the-same-about-hamas/" target="_blank">https://www.pewresearch.org/2024/03/21/majority-in-u-s-say-israel-has-valid-reasons-for-fighting-fewer-say-the-same-about-hamas/</a></p>

<p>Most people support Israel, and the vast majority of people either support Israel or don&rsquo;t give a fuck either way.</p>

<p>These comments where you seem to assume that what Israel is doing is universally reviled and that everybody who reads your comment is going to agree with you is a truly cringe &lsquo;go outside&rsquo; moment for you bruh.</p>

<p>But sure, we can all agree that casinos are a cancerous plague so you&rsquo;ve got that at least.</p>
