      <label for="ldjrac1" class="commentText"><p>On the 3pt shots, most of that is because Jordan never had a 3pt line until he joined the nba. The 3pt line was new. However, by late 80&rsquo;s to mid 90&rsquo;s, he was a 34% shooter. In fact, Jordan has a higher 3p% than LeBron in the playoffs and much higher in the finals.</p>

<p>All of this is with Jordan even saying he didn&rsquo;t practice the 3 much because he didn&rsquo;t see it as part of the game. There is no reason to believe he would NOT improve with more focus as there has been since the 2000&rsquo;s.</p>

On basketball reference in the playoffs Jordan averaged 33.2% over his career, and even his later years on the Bulls he was never a high volume 3 point shooter, with his highest in the playoffs being 3.8 attempts per game in 93’. In comparison, Lebron for his playoff career also averages 33.2% from 3 but on nearly twice the volume as Jordan (4.9 vs 2.5), with his recent playoffs runs going as high as 37.5% on 8 attempts.</p>

      <label for="ldjug1r" class="commentText"><p>The way the game was played before was you go for the high percentage shots. Three point shots weren’t viewed as high percentage shots, even open ones. So in Jordan’s mind, why go take a three point shot when he can drive it to the rim or even take his fadeaway middies that are tough to contest anyway. That’s why you see a lot  longer midrange shots before and you hardly see them now.</p>

      <label for="ldjvurx" class="commentText"><p>Correct. To expand on the thinking back then:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>True understanding of how much spacing 3&rsquo;s create only started happening in 00&rsquo;s with analytics but still didn&rsquo;t really take off until starting around 2014ish (the beginning of the pace and space era0</p></li>

<li><p>Shooting 35% from 3&rsquo;s is like shooting 52.5% from 2&rsquo;s so on paper it looks like a toss up. But the thinking back then was that 3&rsquo;s are inconsistent and you will lose in the long run. That is actually true IF 3&rsquo;s weren&rsquo;t creating benefits by spacing the floor but per #1, it wasn&rsquo;t really until about 2014 where that spacing was really understood</p></li>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but what makes you think that someone who literally said he didn&rsquo;t practice the 3 would not have improved his shot for higher volume in the more modern game?</p>

<p>Also, did you know that LeBron between his rookie year and 2020 only had 2 spans where he took same/more shots as Jordan 90-93 AND had a higher 3P%?</p>

<p>edit: There are so many examples in the past 15 years of players INCLUDING LEBRON that improved their 3pt shooting as they focused more on it. MANY examples.  Your post is suggesting that Jordan would not improve with practice. This is why stats often have to be compared relative to their era.</p>

<p>All signs point to players improving with practice and focus as well as just the nba realizing in the 2000&rsquo;s and after the importance of 3&rsquo;s. Players like Reggie Miller and Ray Allen which I&rsquo;m certain you can agree are great 3pt shooters saw them take more and more 3&rsquo;s (per 100 poss) as they got older and into the 2000&rsquo;s without a drop in 3P%.</p>

      <label for="ldjobkx" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve been seeing way to many uneducated comments from young fans, especially those that get their info on tiktok. One of the worst takes they make is that it was somehow easier for players like Jordan in the 90&rsquo;s than it was for Bron in his era. This is despite the fact that in the early and mid 2000&rsquo;s, the NBA specifically said they wanted to increase scoring and make it more perimeter friendly game. They made some rule changes before 2002 and again before 2005 season. The rule changes before 2005 season lead to instant shift in the game from post dominated to perimeter dominated. Stats for perimeter players began to climb rapidly and 90&rsquo;s perimeter players now around 30 or older began to have their best offensive statistical seasons from 2005 or after.</p>

<p>This video is to show I am not cherry picking. It is just ONE game so not cherry picked from numerous games.</p>

<p>There were 17! offensive fouls &amp; travels called in just that ONE game with up to 14 of them likely not called today</p>

<p>And People wonder why late 90&rsquo;s game were low scoring &amp; didn&rsquo;t look as talented as today. That&rsquo;s because the rules/enforcement HEAVILY favored the defense.</p>

<p>1.There was effectively one less step allowed in traveling AND shuffling your feet on the first step was far more frequently called travel than today.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They were not allowed to palm the ball anywhere near the amount they do today.</p></li>

<li><p>Very little movement in screens was allowed while today they allow a considerable amount of moving while setting screens which help players get open</p></li>

<li><p>Offensive players couldn&rsquo;t push defenders with off arm or lowered shoulder that you see in just about every possession today. The most they allowed in the 90&rsquo;s was when offensive player had his back to the basket and the offensive player could push with his back &ndash; which is what Shaq did as well as many other bigs. That&rsquo;s a reason the 90&rsquo;s was dominated by centers &amp; power forwards. The few instances that they allowed offensive players to initiate contact was in the post but didn&rsquo;t allow it on the perimeter.</p></li>

      <label for="ldk4gnx" class="commentText"><p>Lebron is the perfect example though because he’s played for 20 years. He’s not nearly as dominant athletically but he’s still averaging great stat lines due to the 3pt shot and lenience for offensive fouls. The modern NBA stats are inflated.</p>

<p>I don’t think 1990 defenses were as physical and sophisticated as we make them out to be and the talent on the perimeter wasn’t nearly as strong as it is now. Players are naturally getting better as they can learn from previous generations. Defense has evolved but the rule changes wildly favor offense and as a result defense can’t keep up. Even from a team building standpoint offense is heavily favored.</p>

<p>Anyone arguing Jordan wouldn’t be as dominant might be right from a team standpoint. That argument has merit but individually there’s no doubt he’d have the same advantages. His dexterity at the basket and explosiveness to get there are unparalleled. Not to mention the skill in the mid-range.</p>

      <label for="ldjxy58" class="commentText"><p>Didn&rsquo;t realize I was going to get so many toxic comments that demonstrate no amount of evidence or facts will convince them of anything other than their current opinions. I will add more context about rule changes before 2002 &amp; 2005 seasons that instantly transformed the league from post dominated to perimeter dominated in 2005.</p>

<p>NBA&rsquo;s <a href="https://i.imgur.com/m882uW6.png" target="_blank">Adam Silver</a>, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/DCE1mgy.jpeg" target="_blank">Stu Jackson</a> &amp; <a href="https://i.imgur.com/yYXpfyI.png" target="_blank">Rod Thorn</a> confirm rule changes before 2002 &amp; 2005 were meant to make it easier to score and targeted at making it easier for perimeter players and perimeter offense.</p>

<p>The impact was immediate with rule changes before the 2004-05 season that instantly transformed the league from post dominated to perimeter dominated.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/OvSS2sD.jpeg" target="_blank">Perimeter players stats</a> instantly increased. Tracking the same players, you could see the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/XKzPOoM.jpeg" target="_blank">major impact the rule changes had</a></p>

<p>Rough approximation, the rule changes before 2005 season added to the top perimeter players 14% pts increase, 4% increase in efg% &amp; 2.5% increase in TS%. Or 13% pts, 3.8%efg%, and 2.4%TS if you use % change approach rather than unit change approach.</p>

      <label for="ldk6h2q" class="commentText"><p>And yet offenses continued to get better years after the rule changes. The talent has continued to get better on the perimeter because the game continues to grow. Those rule changes were just the beginning. The Suns, Miami Big 3, and the Warriors embody those changes. Skill on the perimeter became far more favorable.</p>

<p>Help defense has also really hurt post play imo. Pretty much forces bigs to make more difficult reads and for whatever reason bigs haven’t gained a lot of advantages from a rule stand point.</p>

<p>Anyone arguing that Jordan wouldn’t be dominant today is fooling themselves. It’s just an unserious argument. There’s more space and lenience on the perimeter than ever before. Strangely think his assist numbers would be higher as opposed to his scoring in today’s game.</p>

      <label for="ldk7b5m" class="commentText"><p>I just want ton point something out: those charges are dangerous. They are undercutting the offensive player as or even after he has gone up. Im glad there is a change in emphasis on those calls to dissuade players from doing something that risky.</p>

<p>A lot of that “feet shuffling” just looks like a blatant travel. It’s still <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> if it gets called today (<sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> being VERY generous), but I feel players today aren’t as egregious/blatant/excessive/expressive about shuffling their feet like that. They still do, but it doesn’t look like that. Maybe I’m crazy, but it feels like only Gobert would shuffle his feet like that (in the modern nba).</p>

<p>Also, a lot of “good defense” in that video would be considered “defensive flopping” today. It’s not just the change in the rules, it’s a change in perspective.</p>

<p>2:44 - Jordan receives the ball, beats the defender and he is fouled. Lane was open for him, even though he received the ball with 8 seconds left.</p>

<p>4:04 - Jordan beats the defender and again he is fouled. No rim protection, the help gets there extremely late.</p>

<p>5:09 - Jordan beats the defender again, help gets there too late yet again, easy layup.</p>

<p>5:41 - Jordan dribbles for several seconds, no double team or any reaction from Utah even though the entire universe knew he was going to shoot, Jordan has all the freedom in the world.</p>

<p>Is this the super difficulty for perimeter players? Jordan simply cooked this Bryon Russell dude several times and he had basically no help. And reminder, this was the most crucial elimination game in clutch time, so it doesn&rsquo;t get more serious than that. AND Utah was the first ranked defense that year.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but this is not good. The defense Luka faced in the finals this year is miles ahead of this.</p>

      <label for="ldjyv3s" class="commentText"><p>I think reddit might be worse than twitter on this. Any way, I think people at least 35 yrs old saw the major impact of rule changes in the early mid 2000&rsquo;s and remember it. But what I don&rsquo;t get is that you can clearly see a game in 2024 and a game in 2014 and see HUGE differences too. There is no reason to think the nba hasn&rsquo;t been purposely making it much easier for offense and in particular perimeter offensive players. If they are say an age of 22&hellip;they would have been 14 in 2014. But it&rsquo;s possible that&rsquo;s still not old enough to truly understand the changes</p>

<p>I made another top level comments with sources / stats /quotes proving the NBA did in fact intentionally change rules to make it more perimeter easy game and stats back it up that it did become much easier.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1e567bb/rules_enforcement_of_rules_in_the_1990s_made_it/ldjxy58/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1e567bb/rules_enforcement_of_rules_in_the_1990s_made_it/ldjxy58/</a></p>

<p>Personally, I am old but I also understand that the rules of late 90&rsquo;s and early 00&rsquo;s where holding players back too much and change was needed though I think in the past decade they went too far with all the offensive pushing they allow &amp; all the travel. It&rsquo;s just sad that these young people won&rsquo;t even acknowledge what the nba literally states as facts.</p>

<p>I think youre focusing on certain defensive rules but not others. How can you be so sure that hand checking, travel calls, and charges were more influential in creating more offense when defenses couldn’t even play zone till 2001?</p>

<p>A step back doesn’t require 3 steps. Not sure why we keep bringing 3 steps up. Screens were still effective back then, they were used often to get shooters open. Here is a clip of Abdul-Rauf, a small guard, using screens to get open. Using the 3 ball to create mismatches in the defense, and giving the 1996 Bulls the business.</p>

<p>These players were rare in the late 90s. You admit that in earlier posts. Guards who stretch the defense to 25 ft are not rare in today’s game. I don’t think hand checking and travel calls change that.</p>

<p>Because they were post players. The game was far more post dominated&hellip;literally the point of the video which shows how many perimeter plays that are allowed today wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed back then so it was more efficient to have more BIGS playing in the post.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Those teams were built for that era and today&rsquo;s team built for today&rsquo;s era. If you want an honest debate, you would look at how ONE player you pick today would play in the past given those rules. There would be less spacing, the player couldn&rsquo;t push with his off arm, he could only take 2 steps and thus no euro, and they couldn&rsquo;t lower their shoulder and push the defender.</p>

<p>But if teams were post player heavy then shouldn’t that mean perimeter players had matchup advantages on offense?</p>

<p>Placing 3 slow footed bigs on the floor with modern nba guards might as well be a forfeit. Even accounting for rule changes, a step back 3 still counts as 3 points and no big is stopping it consistently without getting blown by like a traffic cone.</p>

<p>Add: small guards who shot 40%-50% of their FGAs from behind the arc did pretty well in the late 90s; Blaylock, T. Hardaway, Van Excel, Stoudemire, etc</p>

<p>I made a top level response with quotes from NBA execs proving they purposely made rule changes to make it much easier on perimeter players &amp; I showed statistical data to back it up. There is also a peer reviewed study showing the rule changes did make scoring easier though they didn&rsquo;t focus on perimeter offense like I did.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But if teams were post player heavy then shouldn’t that mean perimeter players had matchup advantages on offense?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With handchecking, little spacing, unable to push defenders with off arm or with a lowered shoulder, one fewer step allowed, etc.</p>

<p>If that doesn&rsquo;t convince you that it wouldn&rsquo;t be easier on perimeter players back then, then explain what would convince you? The link above shows stats for perimeter players increasing a good deal after handchecking was effectively banned (and before anyone steps in, yes in the past year or two handchecking has made a comeback but offenses can literally push hard against defenders so overall advantage is HUGE on the offensive player).  There were other rule changes and in 2009 NBA reinterpreted the travel to add an extra step though this was done after at least 5 years of NBA players already being allowed that extra step. In 2019 they rewrote the travel rule to make everything more clear.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a step back 3 still counts as 3 points and no big is stopping it consistently without getting blown by like a traffic cone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes I think people are not willing to accept facts but considering your tone, I think you just don&rsquo;t have the experience with older games to understand&hellip;..that a step back 3 with just 2 steps is MUCH harder than it is with 3 steps like today. I&rsquo;m including gather steps when I say 2 steps and 3 steps.</p>

<p>There are a few examples of 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s players doing what is now called a euro step&hellip;.and they were called for a travel! Even funnier, they techically did it within the steps allowed back then but it looked like travel so they called it.</p>

<p>here is Dominique called for travel on a euro step in the 80&rsquo;s</p>

<p>Rod Strickland called for travel on a euro step in 1992. Please also note how much handchecking was happening at the top of the key.</p>

<p>This euro step called for a travel even looks to be done with 1 step plus the gather yet called for a travel. If it looked odd, they called it a travel back then even if it was within the rules.</p>

<p>This one goes back to 1969 where it was even MORE strict. This was called a travel and he took 1.5 steps!</p>

      <label for="ldjqoug" class="commentText"><p>So because the video shows 14 plays called for fouls or travels that would not be called today, it&rsquo;s not a reflection of it being more difficult to score back than? Also, what do you say to all the statistical evidence that it did get easier for perimeter players (but all players too) with rule changes for the 2002 and 2005 seasons?</p>

<p>I guess the better way for me to ask this is to determine if you are willing to engage in any honest discussion&hellip;.what exactly would you accept as evidence that it was more difficult to score for perimeter players before the early mid 2000&rsquo;s rule changes &amp; enforcement changes that happened since?</p>

      <label for="ldjsq1n" class="commentText"><p>So you won&rsquo;t answer the question of what it would take. Got it. Thank you for making it obvious you are not willing to accept any evidence or facts.</p>

<p>edit: and below STILL refuses to answer. Basically, even if I show you many players from the 90&rsquo;s having their best statistical seasons in 2005+ seasons after rule changes, you will not accept it that rules made it easier for perimeter offense.</p>
