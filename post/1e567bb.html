      <label for="ldjrac1" class="commentText"><p>On the 3pt shots, most of that is because Jordan never had a 3pt line until he joined the nba. The 3pt line was new. However, by late 80&rsquo;s to mid 90&rsquo;s, he was a 34% shooter. In fact, Jordan has a higher 3p% than LeBron in the playoffs and much higher in the finals.</p>

<p>All of this is with Jordan even saying he didn&rsquo;t practice the 3 much because he didn&rsquo;t see it as part of the game. There is no reason to believe he would NOT improve with more focus as there has been since the 2000&rsquo;s.</p>

      <label for="ldjsrql" class="commentText"><p>Where are you getting the stats from? On basketball reference in the playoffs Jordan averaged 33.2% over his career, and even his later years on the Bulls he was never a high volume 3 point shooter, with his highest in the playoffs being 3.8 attempts per game in 93’. In comparison, Lebron for his playoff career also averages 33.2% from 3 but on nearly twice the volume as Jordan (4.9 vs 2.5), with his recent playoffs runs going as high as 37.5% on 8 attempts.</p>

      <label for="ldjug1r" class="commentText"><p>The way the game was played before was you go for the high percentage shots. Three point shots weren’t viewed as high percentage shots, even open ones. So in Jordan’s mind, why go take a three point shot when he can drive it to the rim or even take his fadeaway middies that are tough to contest anyway. That’s why you see a lot  longer midrange shots before and you hardly see them now.</p>

      <label for="ldjvurx" class="commentText"><p>Correct. To expand on the thinking back then:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>True understanding of how much spacing 3&rsquo;s create only started happening in 00&rsquo;s with analytics but still didn&rsquo;t really take off until starting around 2014ish (the beginning of the pace and space era0</p></li>

<li><p>Shooting 35% from 3&rsquo;s is like shooting 52.5% from 2&rsquo;s so on paper it looks like a toss up. But the thinking back then was that 3&rsquo;s are inconsistent and you will lose in the long run. That is actually true IF 3&rsquo;s weren&rsquo;t creating benefits by spacing the floor but per #1, it wasn&rsquo;t really until about 2014 where that spacing was really understood</p></li>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but what makes you think that someone who literally said he didn&rsquo;t practice the 3 would not have improved his shot for higher volume in the more modern game?</p>

<p>Also, did you know that LeBron between his rookie year and 2020 only had 2 spans where he took same/more shots as Jordan 90-93 AND had a higher 3P%?</p>

<p>edit: There are so many examples in the past 15 years of players INCLUDING LEBRON that improved their 3pt shooting as they focused more on it. MANY examples.  Your post is suggesting that Jordan would not improve with practice. This is why stats often have to be compared relative to their era.</p>

<p>All signs point to players improving with practice and focus as well as just the nba realizing in the 2000&rsquo;s and after the importance of 3&rsquo;s. Players like Reggie Miller and Ray Allen which I&rsquo;m certain you can agree are great 3pt shooters saw them take more and more 3&rsquo;s (per 100 poss) as they got older and into the 2000&rsquo;s without a drop in 3P%.</p>

      <label for="ldjobkx" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve been seeing way to many uneducated comments from young fans, especially those that get their info on tiktok. One of the worst takes they make is that it was somehow easier for players like Jordan in the 90&rsquo;s than it was for Bron in his era. This is despite the fact that in the early and mid 2000&rsquo;s, the NBA specifically said they wanted to increase scoring and make it more perimeter friendly game. They made some rule changes before 2002 and again before 2005 season. The rule changes before 2005 season lead to instant shift in the game from post dominated to perimeter dominated. Stats for perimeter players began to climb rapidly and 90&rsquo;s perimeter players now around 30 or older began to have their best offensive statistical seasons from 2005 or after.</p>

<p>This video is to show I am not cherry picking. It is just ONE game so not cherry picked from numerous games.</p>

<p>There were 17! offensive fouls &amp; travels called in just that ONE game with up to 14 of them likely not called today</p>

<p>And People wonder why late 90&rsquo;s game were low scoring &amp; didn&rsquo;t look as talented as today. That&rsquo;s because the rules/enforcement HEAVILY favored the defense.</p>

<p>1.There was effectively one less step allowed in traveling AND shuffling your feet on the first step was far more frequently called travel than today.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They were not allowed to palm the ball anywhere near the amount they do today.</p></li>

<li><p>Very little movement in screens was allowed while today they allow a considerable amount of moving while setting screens which help players get open</p></li>

<li><p>Offensive players couldn&rsquo;t push defenders with off arm or lowered shoulder that you see in just about every possession today. The most they allowed in the 90&rsquo;s was when offensive player had his back to the basket and the offensive player could push with his back &ndash; which is what Shaq did as well as many other bigs. That&rsquo;s a reason the 90&rsquo;s was dominated by centers &amp; power forwards. The few instances that they allowed offensive players to initiate contact was in the post but didn&rsquo;t allow it on the perimeter.</p></li>

<p>Because they were post players. The game was far more post dominated&hellip;literally the point of the video which shows how many perimeter plays that are allowed today wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed back then so it was more efficient to have more BIGS playing in the post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even if they reverted back to this offense would still be leagues better than it was in the 90s and 2000s</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those teams were built for that era and today&rsquo;s team built for today&rsquo;s era. If you want an honest debate, you would look at how ONE player you pick today would play in the past given those rules. There would be less spacing, the player couldn&rsquo;t push with his off arm, he could only take 2 steps and thus no euro, and they couldn&rsquo;t lower their shoulder and push the defender.</p>

Also, what do you say to all the statistical evidence that it did get easier for perimeter players (but all players too) with rule changes for the 2002 and 2005 seasons?</p>

<p>I guess the better way for me to ask this is to determine if you are willing to engage in any honest discussion&hellip;.what exactly would you accept as evidence that it was more difficult to score for perimeter players before the early mid 2000&rsquo;s rule changes &amp; enforcement changes that happened since?</p>

      <label for="ldjsq1n" class="commentText"><p>So you won&rsquo;t answer the question of what it would take. Got it. Thank you for making it obvious you are not willing to accept any evidence or facts.</p>
