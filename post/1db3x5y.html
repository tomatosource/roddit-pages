<h1 id="atlanta-hawks">Atlanta Hawks</h1>

<p><strong>Draft and free agency decisions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>1st pick: Alexandre Sarr</li>
<li>3rd pick: Reed Sheppard</li>
<li>9th pick: Cody Williams</li>
<li>21st pick: Yves Missi</li>
<li>FA signing: Tyus Jones</li>
<li>FA loss: Saddiq Bey</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why it makes sense:</strong> Hawks trade away their disappointing star loaded backcourt experiment with Young and Murray in order to assemble a young and exciting roster by enriching their current and future draft capital, something they very much lack as they traded away their future draft picks via Dejounte Murray trade in the 2022 off-season. Hawks also clean up the front court by trading Capela and Okongwu in order to maximize the development and playing time of future 1st overall pick Alexandre Sarr. Free agency acquisition Tyus Jones would be a solid mentor to 3rd overall pick Reed Sheppard. Even if they overpay for Jones to lure him away from the Wizards, a pass first point guard veteran is invaluable to a young rebuilding team and other more prestigious free agents will probably prefer other destinations anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Why it doesn&rsquo;t make sense:</strong> they don&rsquo;t manage to get their own picks back from the Spurs which could prolong their rebuild, especially if their 2024 picks don&rsquo;t pan out.</p>

<p><strong>Objective POV:</strong> Trading either/both Young or/and Murray basically seems like a necessity after two mediocre seasons. A fresh start with young talent would be a welcome change in Atlanta and being patient by building through the draft certainly seems like the smart choice compared to a popular rumour of Atlanta trading for Pelicans&rsquo; Brandon Ingram, which could just walk away for nothing in 2025 free agency.</p>

<p><strong><sup>2024</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub> line-up:</strong></p>

<h1 id="houston-rockets">Houston Rockets</h1>

<p><strong>Draft and free agency decisions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Re-sign: Aaron Holiday</li>
<li>Decline 7M$ TO: Jae&rsquo;Sean Tate</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why it makes sense:</strong> Rockets become a defensive powerhouse by adding Murray and Bridges, while also maintaining a solid offence as well. That sounds just like what the Boston Celtics managed to do last off-season by adding Holiday and Porzingis to an already contending team. Yes, the current Rockets aren&rsquo;t as good as the Celtics were last season, but coach Udoka undoubtedly puts a lot of emphasis on defence and team fit, which many times prevails over mindlessly hoarding offensive star power. A rightly constructed Rockets team could do miracles next season.</p>

<p><strong>Why it doesn&rsquo;t make sense:</strong> Jalen Green could prove to be a superstar on the Nets and the asking price for Bridges is quite high. Dejounte Murray would need to silence his doubters by returning to an all-defensive team form he had on the Spurs.</p>

<p><strong>Objective POV:</strong> Rockets are at crossroads with Jalen Green who might even get a supermax deal next off-season. Retaining their ambitious young core will be practically impossible as they have Whitmore, Green, Sengun and Smith Jr. to extend on highly expansive deals in the near future. Sacrifices will have to be made and at first glance, Bridges and Murray seem like they fit better into the Rockets system than Green, but a move like this won&rsquo;t be executed without taking risks, i.e. trading future draft capital. </p>

<h1 id="brooklyn-nets">Brooklyn Nets </h1>

<p><strong>Draft and free agency decisions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Re-sign: Nic Claxton</li>
<li>FA loss: Lonnie Walker IV </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why it makes sense:</strong> Nets replenish their first round draft picks, meaning they don&rsquo;t face any pressure to be competitive right now and can afford to suffer a few bad seasons with potential for landing a franchise talent in the draft. Jalen Green has shown flashes of superstardom this season with Rockets that could be unleashed for the whole season given a better opportunity under a rebuilding Nets team. Resigning Claxton would be beneficial even if it means they trade him by February&rsquo;s trade deadline versus the alternative of letting him walk for nothing in return, plus given his last season performances he could be a DPOY candidate in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Why it doesn&rsquo;t make sense:</strong> Jalen Green and Cam Thomas might not gel well together given their similar ball dominant playstyles and this could hinder the development of either of them.</p>

<p><strong>Objective POV:</strong> Nets will go into next off-season with an enormous amount of cap space as Ben Simmons&rsquo; contract is expiring. Not getting back their FRPs doesn&rsquo;t mean the end of the world for the Nets as they can afford to get impatient and chase star talent in free agency due to their highly desirable big market in NYC. They also have the leverage of Suns&rsquo; picks to use in a potential future trade.</p>

<h1 id="new-orleans-pelicans">New Orleans Pelicans</h1>

<p><strong>Draft and free agency decisions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Extend: Brandon Ingram</li>
<li>FA Signing: Mo Bamba</li>
<li>FA loss: Jonas Valančiūnas</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why it makes sense:</strong> Pelicans finally surround Zion Williamson with an outstanding playmaker in Trae Young. Despite finishing as a 7th seed, reaching 49 wins in a regular season is not a small amount and a healthy Pelicans squad has proven that they are a serious team. Offensively speaking Trae Young fits perfectly into the Pelicans&rsquo; playstyle. There are quality shooters on the wing with Ingram, Murphy III, and Hawkins, explosive lob threats with Williamson and Capela, and lockdown defence played by Herb Jones, Dyson Daniels, and Jose Alvarado. It seems like this team would be perfectly build to compete for a championship as they would be well versed in every aspect of the game (i.e. shooting, finishing, playmaking, defending, rebounding).</p>

<p><strong>Why it doesn&rsquo;t make sense:</strong> Brandon Ingram and Clint Capela could just walk away for free next season. Extending Ingram beforehand would seem to be of crucial importance in making this type of trade, as they would have no money to sufficiently replace his contribution to the team in 2025 free agency.</p>

<p><strong>Objective POV:</strong> Pelicans are sort of stuck in purgatory without a true starting point guard. A true starting point guard like Young could propel them to their desired success.</p>

<h1 id="memphis-grizzlies">Memphis Grizzlies</h1>

<p><strong>Draft and free agency decisions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>FA Signing: Andre Drummond</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why it makes sense:</strong> Grizzlies are in desperate need of improving their rebounding and center position. Getting Okongwu and Drummond would fix those issues immediately. The frontcourt of Okongwu and Jackson Jr. would also greatly complement each other on defence. Memphis would also get a much-needed scoring momentum of the bench with SMOY candidate Bogdan Bogdanović. They already have a stacked backcourt with Smart, Morant and Bane. An improved frontcourt might just give them that extra needed push to raise the Larry O&rsquo;Brien Trophy for the first time in franchise history.</p>

<p><strong>Why it doesn&rsquo;t make sense:</strong> Grizzlies might want strengthen their wing position. Trading the 9th pick for Okongwu and using their MLE on a center like Drummond might leave them weak at small forward. </p>

<p><strong>Objective POV:</strong> Grizzlies have a built great young core through the draft (Morant, Bane, Jackson Jr) and the upcoming draft decision might just be the decision that will be their most important one yet. Barring serious injuries/circumstances, this Grizzlies team probably won&rsquo;t hit the lottery for quite some time and making the correct decision on draft night might just be the difference between a ring or no ring.</p>
