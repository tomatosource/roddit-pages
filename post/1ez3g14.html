<p>That Pistons team was just straight up way better than the Lakers; the only reason the Lakers stole a game in that series is because Kobe hit a buzzer beater to go to overtime in Game 2.</p>

<p>The Pistons absolutely dominated that Lakers team.</p>

<p>Plus- give Kobe some credit. What was he supposed to do with Tayshaun Prince checking him?</p>

<p>What he supposed to do against Tayshaun? Simply put him out of the game with tons of PnR with shaq and karl.</p>

<p>He went iso mode against Prince bc he took pride in having a big time defender on him, but TP simply had his number on D.</p>

<p>Ain&rsquo;t no way a 3 peat team got exposed like that. They had no chemistry and kobe chucking it up all series didn&rsquo;t help, even if one of those was a buzzer beater to go OT.</p>

<p>We all go through hard shit.</p>

<p>We all want something and work really hard at it.</p>

<p>And not all of us act like total tools to get there.</p>

<p>And carrying a decent attitude, finding a way to manage yourself and your emotions, finding ways to deal with different pesonalities *is* part of the total package.</p>

<p>Someone like Pop is a great example of a dude that is winner, is obsessed, is also crying with Demar when his dad dies, and legit every story that comes out of that camp is with total respect.</p>

<p>Lin is very devout and of strong faith. Kobe might have been like, bitch, praying ain’t going to improve your game and defense. Practice will, get your ass to the court and go 20 laps.</p>

<p>Kobe was definitely frustrated at how poor of a defensive player he was</p>

I&rsquo;d much rather have 20, 7 and 8 from a guy who plays decent defense than some Charles Oakley bs. I&rsquo;m Kobe&rsquo;s age, so I grew up falling in love with the NBA during the 90s. As much as there was to love about that era, the style of some teams&rsquo; play was awful to watch. We have so much exciting ball nowadays. Imagine taking some 20 year old and forcing him to watch Alonzo Mourning and Dale Davis mean mug and bump shoulders for 40 minutes. That&rsquo;s the shit we had to endure lol</p>

      <label for="ljiqmt9" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s less racism as it&rsquo;s actually resentment and taking things personal. Jeremy cooked older Kobe during Linsanity and he took it personally. Being that they became teammates soon after he never got the chance to even the score, so he took it out on him in practices and in situations like what Teague talked about.</p>

      <label for="lji4gly" class="commentText"><p>I actually found Kobe really annoying to watch.</p>

<p>Such an incredible player, but he seemed to actively want to take tuff shots. And while I enjoy watching a player make a tuff shot the defense has forced them into, that&rsquo;s only when they&rsquo;ve first tried to get a good shot.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve sometimes had a little bit of the same issue watching Dirk and KD, but they&rsquo;re both happier ball movers (if lesser passers.)</p>

<p>Idk, maybe I was too unsophisticated a basketballer viewer at that age, but I thot he played like he&rsquo;d rather lose as the main character than win as a team member.</p>

<p>Obviously he managed to win a lot, which makes me question that evaluation.</p>

<p>This is quite a contrast from the newer generation of Steph fans, which are very focused on their shooting ability on catch and shoot, giving greater spacing in the game, which I really enjoy.</p>

      <label for="ljipar5" class="commentText"><p>There&rsquo;s actually two new generation. Steph and Kyrie, for steph I agree. They like hanging in the 3 point line and rely on being open and moving a lot. If the latter part is missing that&rsquo;s the bad part of the new generation wanting to be steph.</p>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s the kyrie type, people who plays like there&rsquo;s 2 mins shot clock and if at the very start their teammates are moving they&rsquo;ll get tired at some point especially since the ball isn&rsquo;t going to them anyway so they&rsquo;ll just stand there and watch this guy dribble.</p>

<p>Tim also studied psychology and wrote his final thesis on narcissistic behavior. Having followed his entire career, it absolutely checked out when I learned about it.</p>

<p>Another example is Manu&rsquo;s story about Tim calling him non-stop to cheer him up after the Dallas blunder in 2006. Or having Tony&rsquo;s back during particularly hard video sessions when he was in Pop&rsquo;s crosshair.</p>

He was such a heavily scrutinized player during much of his career. I thought <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HZ_Ho29bRQ" target="_blank">Kyle J Mann</a> did the best job encapsulating Kobe&rsquo;s legacy in his tribute video.</p>

This is the guy who openly threw Pau Gasol under the bus after a playoff game. Viciously criticized Andrew Bynum and the Lakers management for not trading him. Obviously the well known Shaq feud.</p>

<p>If you followed his career I’d say his Lakers were an unhappy team/locker room for at least 7 or 8 seasons. The problem with Kobe is he tried to mold himself into the hypercompetitive caustic psycho  like MJ - but he had to try. What he never realized was that was just MJ was being authentically himself. Kobe overcompensated.</p>

<p>He did socialize a whole lot more though. You can tell Kobe wanted to be Jordan so bad. I mean, so did every kid who loved basketball back then. The perfect player to replicate.</p>

<p>It’s harder to determine Kobe’s tendencies away from the court because of the sheer amount of time he was on it. He was obsessed with winning basketball whereas Jordan was just obsessed with winning in general. I believe Kobe even references this in the Last Dance doc.</p>

      <label for="lji73uj" class="commentText"><p>There&rsquo;s an interview I watched with him, where he was talking with an interviewer who I believe was from a Catholic media outlet (I&rsquo;m trying to find it but I don&rsquo;t even remember how I ever ended up watching it), but I believe it was post-retirement and Kobe was talking about how he basically realised that his anger had driven him most of his life and that in order to save his marriage, his family and become a better man, his faith made him realise that he had to let go of his anger and find a drastically different way to live.</p>

<p>I think this is what made his 2nd act so incredibly different from this life in the league. He made some major personal changes and choices and it clearly made him a better man, husband and father. By all respects, he was an incredibly supportive friend and mentor to players in both the NBA &amp; WNBA. He was doing a lot of charity work, advocacy work, media work, encouraging colleagues in the media and coaching his daughter. People constantly spoke highly of him in retirement.</p>

<p>Kobe was a shitty person during his league days and he knew it. But I think we forget too easily that people are nuanced, damaged and they can heal, grow up and change. It certainly seems that Kobe did. ETA: I say this as someone that respected his game, but <em>hated</em> Kobe during his league days. But I came to genuinely admire the person he&rsquo;d become in retirement.</p>

      <label for="ljhzw0v" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think you can train as maniacally as he did without having unmet emotional needs. He really strikes me as a guy who never felt like he was good enough, or belonged anywhere. The stories of him never going to parties or team dinners, training after important events in your life; you can’t be like that unless you’re proving something to yourself, it was almost self-destructive.</p>

<p>I don’t think NBA guys are adjusted to ever being around people like this, most of them have always been so good they never doubt where they belong or their ability. Kobe was a dude who sacrificed everything and gave up nothing unless you pried it from him. It’s pretty admirable with a tragic undertone.</p>

<p>Can’t deny it’d be pretty hard to work with, but it’s a nice hero’s journey nonetheless. He seemed pretty content after retiring.</p>

      <label for="lji14gn" class="commentText"><p>When you talk about Kobe not going to parties and being a loner, I think of how young Kobe clashed with Shaq, but also everyone else on that team before Shaq left. Like this excerpt when Kobe was going through his rape trial:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kobe stands up and goes face-to-face with me and says, “You always said you’re my big brother, you’d do anything for me, and then this Colorado thing happens and you never even called me.” I did call him. &hellip; So here we are now, and we find out he really was hurt that we didn’t stand behind him. That was something new. I didn’t think he gave a rat’s ass about us either way. “Well, I thought you’d publicly support me, at least,” Kobe said. “You’re supposed to be my friend.”</p>

<p>Brian Shaw chimed in with “Kobe, why would you think that? Shaq had all these parties and you never showed up for any of them. We invited you to dinner on the road and you didn’t come. Shaq invited you to his wedding and you weren’t there. Then you got married and didn’t invite any of us. And now you are in the middle of this problem, this sensitive situation, and now you want all of us to step up for you. We don’t even know you.” &hellip;</p>

      <label for="ljibjsg" class="commentText"><p>Kobe saying &ldquo;You should support me, you&rsquo;re supposed to be my friend&rdquo; to Shaq, after trying to rat Shaq out to the police in Colorado, has got to be one of the most narcissistic moments in NBA history.</p>

<p>I guess loyalty was just a one-way street with him.</p>

      <label for="lji72ig" class="commentText"><p>Icons Club was a super interesting listen. I liked all of it but the Dr J and the Kobe/Shaq episodes were my favorites. The Kobe freestyle rap story was extremely telling and then this one. Dude definitely had a hard time understanding friendship and that Shaq&rsquo;s method of bonding with the team was also effective. While he wasn&rsquo;t working his ass off and pushing himself to the limit with his workouts, Shaq was building better bonds with his teammates and they all loved him generally and wanted him there, whereas nobody wanted Kobe around in those early days and didn&rsquo;t like him. Super interesting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>-Bryant stated that he assumed consent for sex because of the accuser&rsquo;s body language.</p>

<p>-It was revealed that Bryant leaned the woman over a chair to have sex with her, which allegedly caused the bleeding. This was the sex act in question, as the accuser claims she told Bryant to stop, but he would not, and Bryant claims he stopped after asking if he could ejaculate on her face.</p>

<p>-I told Detective Winters that Mr. Bryant had made me stay in the room and wash my face. While I was held against my will in that room, I was not forced to wash my face.</p>

<p>I was getting killed by Kobe fans a couple days ago. And I wasn’t even the one the brought it up. I was just responding to a Kobe fan who said something like “there’s great reason to believe Kobe is innocent because she changed her story” I pointed out that Kobe also changed his story multiple times and apologized to her for a crime he claimed he didn’t commit.. I wasn’t even saying I know for a fact he did it.. I was just saying there are some pretty major red flags as far as that case is concerned, and all the sudden it was “well it doesn’t matter if Kobe changed his story. he was the defendant. Innocent until proven guilty.” Like this ain’t a court of law my guy. Bro already beat the charges. I’m not advocating for them to dig up Kobe’s body and put it in prison. I’m just trying to have an honest human conversation about the case.. but even that wasn’t good enough.</p>

<p>It’s just crazy to me that you can like how someone plays basketball so much to the point your defending them as a person NO MATTER WHAT, and not even open to having a real conversation about the details. It’s basically “all the things that make her look bad, I take for facts; but all the things that make him look bad, is just conjecture. No way to know for sure.” I know some people will be like “it happened so long ago why bring it up.” But I do think it says something about how a lot of people look at these cases even now, when you hear people complain about how the “me too movement has gone too far.” It seems like it’s still an uphill battle if the person you’re accusing is a beloved public figure.</p>

<p>Literally every single teammate Duncan has ever had has said he was the best guy they ever played with. Selfless, fun to be around, always did what was best for the team etc. That’s a far cry from Kobe where multiple ex teammates have come out and said he was a bully.</p>

Hearing the stories of his work ethic is great and all but the reality is waking up at 3-4am and having several workouts a day followed by sleeping 2-4 hours/night (Kobe has said publicly he has a hard time sleeping) is not good on the body.  Compare that to todays athletes who emphasize the importance of recovery and sleep.</p>

<p>Kobe ego got bruised, after he stood up to him</p>

<p>This is like the opposite of what happened with Kerr vs Jordan: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yOTK1uRRq8E" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yOTK1uRRq8E</a></p>

<p>Maybe Lin should have punched him, and then he would have gained his respect. NBA world is wild bruh.</p>

      <label for="ljirrq6" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s amazing what a piece of crap Kobe was. Not only in the clueless and misguided way he treated other players on the team in the name of his fake Jordan quest, but also how dishonest he was. He gave many reasons for shooting the ball, and basically contradicted all of them. Like that he wanted to win, when his shooting cost the Lakers the &lsquo;04 Finals, or that he didn&rsquo;t care if someone else shot &ldquo;but you have to make the shot,&rdquo; when he kept shooting when he was 12th on the team in TS%. Apparently the reason he developed in such a warped way is that Jerry Buss didn&rsquo;t have to deal with him every day and wouldn&rsquo;t let Phil Jackson trade him, so Phil had to make stuff work around him.</p>

<p>Sure he was overlooked AND overrated at the same time, but that&rsquo;s what made it work for him. It was unfortunate that the league didn&rsquo;t have the most accurate assessment of him, but he&rsquo;s made that clear that players should be viewed equally, without stereotypes.</p>

<p>The opposite end I&rsquo;d think would be bronny james.</p>
