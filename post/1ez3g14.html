<p>That overall outlook kinda gets swept under this broader point of just needing to be tougher. We were missing 2 starters lol.</p>

      <label for="ljhujxc" class="commentText"><p>I mean Kobe did this publicly too, I don’t know why people are acting surprised about the Lin stuff coming out now. This is the guy who openly threw Pau Gasol under the bus after a playoff game. Viciously criticized Andrew Bynum and the Lakers management for not trading him. Obviously the well known Shaq feud.</p>

<p>If you followed his career I’d say his Lakers were an unhappy team/locker room for at least 7 or 8 seasons. The problem with Kobe is he tried to mold himself into the hypercompetitive caustic psycho  like MJ - but he had to try. What he never realized was that was just MJ was being authentically himself. Kobe overcompensated.</p>

<p>He did socialize a whole lot more though. You can tell Kobe wanted to be Jordan so bad. I mean, so did every kid who loved basketball back then. The perfect player to replicate.</p>

      <label for="ljhzosn" class="commentText"><p>I feel like it’s the opposite. Jordan was a massive gambling addict and competitive golfer. He never lost that competitive edge away from the court. Sure he enjoyed a good time, but that psycho drive to win was constant.</p>

<p>It’s harder to determine Kobe’s tendencies away from the court because of the sheer amount of time he was on it. He was obsessed with winning basketball whereas Jordan was just obsessed with winning in general. I believe Kobe even references this in the Last Dance doc.</p>

      <label for="lji73uj" class="commentText"><p>There&rsquo;s an interview I watched with him, where he was talking with an interviewer who I believe was from a Catholic media outlet (I&rsquo;m trying to find it but I don&rsquo;t even remember how I ever ended up watching it), but I believe it was post-retirement and Kobe was talking about how he basically realised that his anger had driven him most of his life and that in order to save his marriage, his family and become a better man, his faith made him realise that he had to let go of his anger and find a drastically different way to live.</p>

<p>I think this is what made his 2nd act so incredibly different from this life in the league. He made some major personal changes and choices and it clearly made him a better man, husband and father. By all respects, he was an incredibly supportive friend and mentor to players in both the NBA &amp; WNBA. He was doing a lot of charity work, advocacy work, media work, encouraging colleagues in the media and coaching his daughter. People constantly spoke highly of him in retirement.</p>

<p>Kobe was a shitty person during his league days and he knew it. But I think we forget too easily that people are nuanced, damaged and they can heal, grow up and change. It certainly seems that Kobe did. ETA: I say this as someone that respected his game, but <em>hated</em> Kobe during his league days. But I came to genuinely admire the person he&rsquo;d become in retirement.</p>

      <label for="ljhzw0v" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think you can train as maniacally as he did without having unmet emotional needs. He really strikes me as a guy who never felt like he was good enough, or belonged anywhere. The stories of him never going to parties or team dinners, training after important events in your life; you can’t be like that unless you’re proving something to yourself, it was almost self-destructive.</p>

<p>I don’t think NBA guys are adjusted to ever being around people like this, most of them have always been so good they never doubt where they belong or their ability. Kobe was a dude who sacrificed everything and gave up nothing unless you pried it from him. It’s pretty admirable with a tragic undertone.</p>

<p>Can’t deny it’d be pretty hard to work with, but it’s a nice hero’s journey nonetheless. He seemed pretty content after retiring.</p>

      <label for="lji14gn" class="commentText"><p>When you talk about Kobe not going to parties and being a loner, I think of how young Kobe clashed with Shaq, but also everyone else on that team before Shaq left. Like this excerpt when Kobe was going through his rape trial:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kobe stands up and goes face-to-face with me and says, “You always said you’re my big brother, you’d do anything for me, and then this Colorado thing happens and you never even called me.” I did call him. &hellip; So here we are now, and we find out he really was hurt that we didn’t stand behind him. That was something new. I didn’t think he gave a rat’s ass about us either way. “Well, I thought you’d publicly support me, at least,” Kobe said. “You’re supposed to be my friend.”</p>

<p>Brian Shaw chimed in with “Kobe, why would you think that? Shaq had all these parties and you never showed up for any of them. We invited you to dinner on the road and you didn’t come. Shaq invited you to his wedding and you weren’t there. Then you got married and didn’t invite any of us. And now you are in the middle of this problem, this sensitive situation, and now you want all of us to step up for you. We don’t even know you.” &hellip;</p>

The Kobe freestyle rap story was extremely telling and then this one. Dude definitely had a hard time understanding friendship and that Shaq&rsquo;s method of bonding with the team was also effective. While he wasn&rsquo;t working his ass off and pushing himself to the limit with his workouts, Shaq was building better bonds with his teammates and they all loved him generally and wanted him there, whereas nobody wanted Kobe around in those early days and didn&rsquo;t like him. Super interesting.</p>

<p>What he never realized was that was just MJ was being authentically himself. Kobe overcompensated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty much this, you read Phil and Shaq&rsquo;s books he he a lot of trouble fitting in as a young guy due to growing up in Italy and not knowing the slang, the music, the movies and shows etc. So he was a loner and Shaq and the guys thought he was a nerd. Theres a funny scene in the book where a young Kobe sees the guys with Shaq freestyling on the team bus, so after a few games he comes to them trying to rap some shit he wrote down and memorized and they laugh him off.</p>

<p>It was only way later in his career after Shaq left and he was the guy, he created this whole Mamba Mentality persona. Which fits his mentality as he was always close with MJ who served as a sort of mentor so he tried to do the same thing.</p>

<p>Zen Master Phil Jackson was doing the same shit to players during all years including the three peat. Lambasting to the media for public accountability. Shaq was a victim. Kobe was a victim. Pau was a victim. Whatever Kobe said about Pau being soft, needing Big Boy Pants, etc, is no worse than what their 11x championship coach was doing, not to mention 80% of the league back then. Those are the questions asked by the media, and those are the honest responses.</p>

<p>I don’t even know where to start with your Bynum nonsense. We all seen that video. Kobe was real “vicious” with that. LAL had 3 seasons with boba fide walk on scrubs that had no career in the league outside of those years. Kobe was 26. A desire to win now and ship off a rookie for Jason Kidd or other players to contend in your prime is normal. 7 or 8 seasons? You’re delusional.</p>

<p>Kobe also on Lin publicly stated he wanted Lin to have confidence, to not be a pushover, and to control the game. Then 3 months into the season J Lin fails to foul Conley in a no-shot-clock one possession game because Byron Scott was saying not to. DEFINITION of pushover.</p>

<p>Kobe was the one who told Phil he&rsquo;d rather lose by himself than win with Shaq.</p>

<p>Kobe only wanted to win with himself as the star. He didn&rsquo;t have an unconditional desire to win, the way Tim Duncan or older Wilt Chamberlain did.</p>

<p>People look past MJ and Kobe being a prick to teammates because they won championships but the reality is most people would rather go into a work environment not feeling like they have to walk on egg shells or being berated by someone higher up than them.</p>

      <label for="ljigxsx" class="commentText"><p>I think circumstances also matter here. MJ thrown into a cocaine circus and was getting whaled on by the Pistons. Kobe was thrown into a team with Shaq. Both of them didn&rsquo;t ask anything of their teammates which they themselves didn&rsquo;t do. TD was drafted by a playoff franchise with an elite culture already set by David Robinson.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to tell how players would&rsquo;ve grown had they been in each other&rsquo;s situations. Maybe Kobe wins fewer rings if he&rsquo;s drafted by the Spurs, maybe TD wins fewer if he&rsquo;s drafted by the Lakers.</p>

      <label for="lji4gly" class="commentText"><p>I actually found Kobe really annoying to watch.</p>

<p>Such an incredible player, but he seemed to actively want to take tuff shots. And while I enjoy watching a player make a tuff shot the defense has forced them into, that&rsquo;s only when they&rsquo;ve first tried to get a good shot.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve sometimes had a little bit of the same issue watching Dirk and KD, but they&rsquo;re both happier ball movers (if lesser passers.)</p>

<p>Idk, maybe I was too unsophisticated a basketballer viewer at that age, but I thot he played like he&rsquo;d rather lose as the main character than win as a team member.</p>

<p>Obviously he managed to win a lot, which makes me question that evaluation.</p>

<p>This is quite a contrast from the newer generation of Steph fans, which are very focused on their shooting ability on catch and shoot, giving greater spacing in the game, which I really enjoy.</p>

<p>Literally every single teammate Duncan has ever had has said he was the best guy they ever played with. Selfless, fun to be around, always did what was best for the team etc. That’s a far cry from Kobe where multiple ex teammates have come out and said he was a bully.</p>

Somebody within the organization has to have that cut throat mentality. If it&rsquo;s the coach, he has to have the backing of the organization otherwise he&rsquo;s gone. If it&rsquo;s the player he has to be a goat candidate.</p>

Hearing the stories of his work ethic is great and all but the reality is waking up at 3-4am and having several workouts a day followed by sleeping 2-4 hours/night (Kobe has said publicly he has a hard time sleeping) is not good on the body.  Compare that to todays athletes who emphasize the importance of recovery and sleep.</p>

<p>Kobe ego got bruised, after he stood up to him</p>

<p>This is like the opposite of what happened with Kerr vs Jordan: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yOTK1uRRq8E" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yOTK1uRRq8E</a></p>

<p>Maybe Lin should have punched him, and then he would have gained his respect. NBA world is wild bruh.</p>

      <label for="lji743k" class="commentText"><p>IMO I don&rsquo;t think its the right way to look at it.</p>

<p>Kobe is human. There is stuff to love like his passion and hard work, and stuff to not love like him bad mouthing his teammates. No one is perfect, especially if you put them under a microscope. Learn from it and become a better person.</p>

Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, he&rsquo;s a legend but he was an MJ-wannabe asshole who was a ball hug, had horrible efficiencies, not to mention a horrendous teammate. I&rsquo;d take Tim duncan over kobe any day.</p>

Was Kobe an ass to all his teammates (A la MJ - but we excused it because he was “driven”, etc?) Maybr this was a reaction towards all the Lindsanity stuff that Kobe may have felt was undeserved.. ? Can’t imagine Lin was that much of an asshole to warrant what Kobe threw at him.</p>
