      <label for="ljhujxc" class="commentText"><p>I mean Kobe did this publicly too, I don’t know why people are acting surprised about the Lin stuff coming out now. This is the guy who openly threw Pau Gasol under the bus after a playoff game. Viciously criticized Andrew Bynum and the Lakers management for not trading him. Obviously the well known Shaq feud.</p>

<p>If you followed his career I’d say his Lakers were an unhappy team/locker room for at least 7 or 8 seasons. The problem with Kobe is he tried to mold himself into the hypercompetitive caustic psycho  like MJ - but he had to try. What he never realized was that was just MJ was being authentically himself. Kobe overcompensated.</p>

Dude is a fierce competitor to the end. I’ve heard stories about him playing 3 full rounds back to back due to betting, and not wanting to drive home a loser.</p>

<p>He did socialize a whole lot more though. You can tell Kobe wanted to be Jordan so bad. I mean, so did every kid who loved basketball back then. The perfect player to replicate.</p>

      <label for="ljhzosn" class="commentText"><p>I feel like it’s the opposite. Jordan was a massive gambling addict and competitive golfer. He never lost that competitive edge away from the court. Sure he enjoyed a good time, but that psycho drive to win was constant.</p>

<p>It’s harder to determine Kobe’s tendencies away from the court because of the sheer amount of time he was on it. He was obsessed with winning basketball whereas Jordan was just obsessed with winning in general. I believe Kobe even references this in the Last Dance doc.</p>

<p>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who was Bynum’s personal coach said “I believe Andrew has always had the potential to help a team when he puts his heart not it. He just doesn’t seem to be consistent with his commitment to the game. That can lead to a lot of frustration for any team that has signed him.”</p>

They were able to get Dwight Howard the best center in the league for Bynum eventually. Even if the Dwight era didn’t work out, trading Bynum when Kobe wanted to would have been selling him low</p>

      <label for="ljhzw0v" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think you can train as maniacally as he did without having unmet emotional needs. He really strikes me as a guy who never felt like he was good enough, or belonged anywhere. The stories of him never going to parties or team dinners, training after important events in your life; you can’t be like that unless you’re proving something to yourself, it was almost self-destructive.</p>

<p>I don’t think NBA guys are adjusted to ever being around people like this, most of them have always been so good they never doubt where they belong or their ability. Kobe was a dude who sacrificed everything and gave up nothing unless you pried it from him. It’s pretty admirable with a tragic undertone.</p>

<p>Can’t deny it’d be pretty hard to work with, but it’s a nice hero’s journey nonetheless. He seemed pretty content after retiring.</p>

      <label for="lji14gn" class="commentText"><p>When you talk about Kobe not going to parties and being a loner, I think of how young Kobe clashed with Shaq, but also everyone else on that team before Shaq left. Like this excerpt when Kobe was going through his rape trial:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kobe stands up and goes face-to-face with me and says, “You always said you’re my big brother, you’d do anything for me, and then this Colorado thing happens and you never even called me.” I did call him. &hellip; So here we are now, and we find out he really was hurt that we didn’t stand behind him. That was something new. I didn’t think he gave a rat’s ass about us either way. “Well, I thought you’d publicly support me, at least,” Kobe said. “You’re supposed to be my friend.”</p>

<p>Brian Shaw chimed in with “Kobe, why would you think that? Shaq had all these parties and you never showed up for any of them. We invited you to dinner on the road and you didn’t come. Shaq invited you to his wedding and you weren’t there. Then you got married and didn’t invite any of us. And now you are in the middle of this problem, this sensitive situation, and now you want all of us to step up for you. We don’t even know you.” &hellip;</p>

      <label for="lji2twf" class="commentText"><p>Yup, he was a really immature guy, he brought that on himself completely. All that shit people talk about him now, i doubt he even noticed in the moment, maybe he thought his skill made him his friendships and not his personality. Maybe he thought he wasn’t all that important and they’d be happier without him around.</p>

<p>I saw that clip a long time ago and it really stuck out to me personally, I feel for him cause I’ve had those kinds of heart-sink conversations before, I remember where I was at mentally before they happened.</p>

      <label for="lji1t67" class="commentText"><p>He was an asshole up until he retired.  I think retirement and raising his daughters is when he realized that basketball isn’t that serious.</p>

<p>People look past MJ and Kobe being a prick to teammates because they won championships but the reality is most people would rather go into a work environment not feeling like they have to walk on egg shells or being berated by someone higher up than them.</p>

<p>They are not a packaged deal. He did some awful things (calling his teammates &ldquo;that shit&rdquo;), but was also a very committed hard worker.</p>

Cuz he did have a cool side, a fatherly side, etc. but he also had psycho kobe side when it game to the lakers. Thise last couple years and he was shooting like 35%, losing, had to have been ugly.

      <label for="lji2ltt" class="commentText"><p>I honestly believe that his body broke down because of how intense and overboard his training was.  Hearing the stories of his work ethic is great and all but the reality is waking up at 3-4am and having several workouts a day followed by sleeping 2-4 hours/night (Kobe has said publicly he has a hard time sleeping) is not good on the body.  Compare that to todays athletes who emphasize the importance of recovery and sleep.</p>

<p>Kobe ego got bruised, after he stood up to him</p>

<p>This is like the opposite of what happened with Kerr vs Jordan: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yOTK1uRRq8E" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yOTK1uRRq8E</a></p>

<p>Maybe Lin should have punched him, and then he would have gained his respect. NBA world is wild bruh.</p>

      <label for="ljhzme7" class="commentText"><p>Love how the non stop parade of mid to garbage tier players shitting on Kobe. Couldn’t have anything to do with him not being around to come back at them right? Cowards all of them. OP is especially cowardly.  Keep posting Kobe hate to try and make yourself feel better about the sad excuse for a life you have.</p>

<p>Rodman is cool with MJ but not even feeling it with Kobe cause MJ knew what he can do towards who and not force it</p>

<p>Nobody in their right mind would want to play with Kobe, He is the Laker&rsquo;s Homelander</p>
