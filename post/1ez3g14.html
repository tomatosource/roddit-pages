<p>Lin is very devout and of strong faith. Kobe might have been like, bitch, praying ain’t going to improve your game and defense. Practice will, get your ass to the court and go 20 laps.</p>

<p>That overall outlook kinda gets swept under this broader point of just needing to be tougher. We were missing 2 starters lol.</p>

We&rsquo;ve paid homage to Asian cultures for decades in movies and music. Don&rsquo;t spread lies like that. Now maybe in certain cities where there&rsquo;s some shaky history between blacks and Asians like LA but in most places we don&rsquo;t have any negative opinions about Asians. Not to mention you&rsquo;re not Asian or black how the fuck are you a reputable source on our relationships? Because you saw some news reports on TV during covid? Lol get the fuck out of here.</p>

Jeremy cooked older Kobe during Linsanity and he took it personally. Being that they became teammates soon after he never got the chance to even the score, so he took it out on him in practices and in situations like what Teague talked about.</p>

      <label for="lji4gly" class="commentText"><p>I actually found Kobe really annoying to watch.</p>

<p>Such an incredible player, but he seemed to actively want to take tuff shots. And while I enjoy watching a player make a tuff shot the defense has forced them into, that&rsquo;s only when they&rsquo;ve first tried to get a good shot.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve sometimes had a little bit of the same issue watching Dirk and KD, but they&rsquo;re both happier ball movers (if lesser passers.)</p>

<p>Idk, maybe I was too unsophisticated a basketballer viewer at that age, but I thot he played like he&rsquo;d rather lose as the main character than win as a team member.</p>

<p>Obviously he managed to win a lot, which makes me question that evaluation.</p>

Think it bit him in the ass these Finals when he kept trying to rely on that tough shot making ability and was in a cold stretch (not sure what I think about the &lsquo;can&rsquo;t play in/against Boston&rsquo; angle, don&rsquo;t think I buy it really).</p>

      <label for="ljijlzw" class="commentText"><p>My biggest gripe with Kobe was his influence on the kids I played basketball with growing up. The lil Kobe fans would take these extremely difficult fadeaways that they had seen Kobe make, and just miss 80% of them.</p>

<p>This is quite a contrast from the newer generation of Steph fans, which are very focused on their shooting ability on catch and shoot, giving greater spacing in the game, which I really enjoy.</p>

      <label for="ljipar5" class="commentText"><p>There&rsquo;s actually two new generation. Steph and Kyrie, for steph I agree. They like hanging in the 3 point line and rely on being open and moving a lot. If the latter part is missing that&rsquo;s the bad part of the new generation wanting to be steph.</p>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s the kyrie type, people who plays like there&rsquo;s 2 mins shot clock and if at the very start their teammates are moving they&rsquo;ll get tired at some point especially since the ball isn&rsquo;t going to them anyway so they&rsquo;ll just stand there and watch this guy dribble.</p>

<p>Tim also studied psychology and wrote his final thesis on narcissistic behavior. Having followed his entire career, it absolutely checked out when I learned about it.</p>

<p>Another example is Manu&rsquo;s story about Tim calling him non-stop to cheer him up after the Dallas blunder in 2006. Or having Tony&rsquo;s back during particularly hard video sessions when he was in Pop&rsquo;s crosshair.</p>

This is the guy who openly threw Pau Gasol under the bus after a playoff game. Viciously criticized Andrew Bynum and the Lakers management for not trading him. Obviously the well known Shaq feud.</p>

<p>If you followed his career I’d say his Lakers were an unhappy team/locker room for at least 7 or 8 seasons. The problem with Kobe is he tried to mold himself into the hypercompetitive caustic psycho  like MJ - but he had to try. What he never realized was that was just MJ was being authentically himself. Kobe overcompensated.</p>

<p>It’s harder to determine Kobe’s tendencies away from the court because of the sheer amount of time he was on it. He was obsessed with winning basketball whereas Jordan was just obsessed with winning in general. I believe Kobe even references this in the Last Dance doc.</p>

      <label for="lji73uj" class="commentText"><p>There&rsquo;s an interview I watched with him, where he was talking with an interviewer who I believe was from a Catholic media outlet (I&rsquo;m trying to find it but I don&rsquo;t even remember how I ever ended up watching it), but I believe it was post-retirement and Kobe was talking about how he basically realised that his anger had driven him most of his life and that in order to save his marriage, his family and become a better man, his faith made him realise that he had to let go of his anger and find a drastically different way to live.</p>

<p>I think this is what made his 2nd act so incredibly different from this life in the league. He made some major personal changes and choices and it clearly made him a better man, husband and father. By all respects, he was an incredibly supportive friend and mentor to players in both the NBA &amp; WNBA. He was doing a lot of charity work, advocacy work, media work, encouraging colleagues in the media and coaching his daughter. People constantly spoke highly of him in retirement.</p>

<p>Kobe was a shitty person during his league days and he knew it. But I think we forget too easily that people are nuanced, damaged and they can heal, grow up and change. It certainly seems that Kobe did. ETA: I say this as someone that respected his game, but <em>hated</em> Kobe during his league days. But I came to genuinely admire the person he&rsquo;d become in retirement.</p>

Kobe might be a great player, but he&rsquo;s the Gordon Ramsay of basketball players: his success and being an asshole in a very public way made a lot of much-less-talented people in their field think that it&rsquo;s professionally acceptable to be an asshole to their peers and subordinates.</p>

      <label for="lji6w1k" class="commentText"><p>Ramsay at least has mellowed a bit, and was only really an asshole to people who were either behaving dangerously with other people&rsquo;s health or were risking his own name and branding which endangers the jobs of tons of other people. He&rsquo;s talked publicly about how much pressure he feels since becoming a TV star since there&rsquo;s so many people counting on him personally. It&rsquo;d be like if the lakers would dissolve as a franchise if Kobe lost too many games. </p>

He really strikes me as a guy who never felt like he was good enough, or belonged anywhere. The stories of him never going to parties or team dinners, training after important events in your life; you can’t be like that unless you’re proving something to yourself, it was almost self-destructive.</p>

<p>I don’t think NBA guys are adjusted to ever being around people like this, most of them have always been so good they never doubt where they belong or their ability. Kobe was a dude who sacrificed everything and gave up nothing unless you pried it from him. It’s pretty admirable with a tragic undertone.</p>

<p>Can’t deny it’d be pretty hard to work with, but it’s a nice hero’s journey nonetheless. He seemed pretty content after retiring.</p>

      <label for="lji14gn" class="commentText"><p>When you talk about Kobe not going to parties and being a loner, I think of how young Kobe clashed with Shaq, but also everyone else on that team before Shaq left. Like this excerpt when Kobe was going through his rape trial:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kobe stands up and goes face-to-face with me and says, “You always said you’re my big brother, you’d do anything for me, and then this Colorado thing happens and you never even called me.” I did call him. &hellip; So here we are now, and we find out he really was hurt that we didn’t stand behind him. That was something new. I didn’t think he gave a rat’s ass about us either way. “Well, I thought you’d publicly support me, at least,” Kobe said. “You’re supposed to be my friend.”</p>

<p>Brian Shaw chimed in with “Kobe, why would you think that? Shaq had all these parties and you never showed up for any of them. We invited you to dinner on the road and you didn’t come. Shaq invited you to his wedding and you weren’t there. Then you got married and didn’t invite any of us. And now you are in the middle of this problem, this sensitive situation, and now you want all of us to step up for you. We don’t even know you.” &hellip;</p>

      <label for="lji72ig" class="commentText"><p>Icons Club was a super interesting listen. I liked all of it but the Dr J and the Kobe/Shaq episodes were my favorites. The Kobe freestyle rap story was extremely telling and then this one. Dude definitely had a hard time understanding friendship and that Shaq&rsquo;s method of bonding with the team was also effective. While he wasn&rsquo;t working his ass off and pushing himself to the limit with his workouts, Shaq was building better bonds with his teammates and they all loved him generally and wanted him there, whereas nobody wanted Kobe around in those early days and didn&rsquo;t like him. Super interesting.</p>

<p>What he never realized was that was just MJ was being authentically himself. Kobe overcompensated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty much this, you read Phil and Shaq&rsquo;s books he he a lot of trouble fitting in as a young guy due to growing up in Italy and not knowing the slang, the music, the movies and shows etc. So he was a loner and Shaq and the guys thought he was a nerd. Theres a funny scene in the book where a young Kobe sees the guys with Shaq freestyling on the team bus, so after a few games he comes to them trying to rap some shit he wrote down and memorized and they laugh him off.</p>

<p>It was only way later in his career after Shaq left and he was the guy, he created this whole Mamba Mentality persona. Which fits his mentality as he was always close with MJ who served as a sort of mentor so he tried to do the same thing.</p>

<p>Literally every single teammate Duncan has ever had has said he was the best guy they ever played with. Selfless, fun to be around, always did what was best for the team etc. That’s a far cry from Kobe where multiple ex teammates have come out and said he was a bully.</p>

Hearing the stories of his work ethic is great and all but the reality is waking up at 3-4am and having several workouts a day followed by sleeping 2-4 hours/night (Kobe has said publicly he has a hard time sleeping) is not good on the body.  Compare that to todays athletes who emphasize the importance of recovery and sleep.</p>

<p>Kobe ego got bruised, after he stood up to him</p>

<p>This is like the opposite of what happened with Kerr vs Jordan: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yOTK1uRRq8E" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yOTK1uRRq8E</a></p>

<p>Maybe Lin should have punched him, and then he would have gained his respect. NBA world is wild bruh.</p>

      <label for="ljirrq6" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s amazing what a piece of crap Kobe was. Not only in the clueless and misguided way he treated other players on the team in the name of his fake Jordan quest, but also how dishonest he was. He gave many reasons for shooting the ball, and basically contradicted all of them. Like that he wanted to win, when his shooting cost the Lakers the &lsquo;04 Finals, or that he didn&rsquo;t care if someone else shot &ldquo;but you have to make the shot,&rdquo; when he kept shooting when he was 12th on the team in TS%. Apparently the reason he developed in such a warped way is that Jerry Buss didn&rsquo;t have to deal with him every day and wouldn&rsquo;t let Phil Jackson trade him, so Phil had to make stuff work around him.</p>

<p>Sure he was overlooked AND overrated at the same time, but that&rsquo;s what made it work for him. It was unfortunate that the league didn&rsquo;t have the most accurate assessment of him, but he&rsquo;s made that clear that players should be viewed equally, without stereotypes.</p>

<p>The opposite end I&rsquo;d think would be bronny james.</p>

<p>Shit sucks but that&rsquo;s life I guess, hope he made it better for those after him.</p>
