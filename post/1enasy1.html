      <label for="lh4vl15" class="commentText"><p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not rocket science.  The only reason to trade him as an expiring would be throw it all in the tank.</p>

<p>But now Lauri is theoretically worth more on a long-term deal.</p>

<p>So he can either tank next season after a haul of a trade, or use the haul the Jazz already have to start building a proper team (the bulk of assets being used to bring in a proper shot-creating number 1 option).</p>

<p>Like, there isn&rsquo;t some secret society that he can trade the picks to turn the Jazz into basketball cyborgs.  Ainge has the same options as every other team.</p>

<p>Draft, trade, sign free agents.</p>

<p>Players don&rsquo;t often do that unless they are traded <em>exactly</em> where they want to go.</p>

<p>All Lauri had to do was say &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to test free agenecy&rdquo; and then his trade value is that of a rental.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the logic behind saying this after saying this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But now Lauri is theoretically worth more on a long-term deal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His value is the same because the team getting him knows they&rsquo;re going to extend him. So what&rsquo;s the difference?</p>

      <label for="lh531v6" class="commentText"><p>It’s not as simple as they’re saying because there’s still only a select amount of teams that would want Lauri. But theoretically it increases the amount of teams that can be more willing to trade for Lauri thus increasing his value. Before the contract extension, the pool of teams is limited to teams Lauri would sign an extension with. Now that he’s locked in a contract, other teams that Lauri wasn’t fond of might be more willing to trade for him.</p>

      <label for="lh5chi2" class="commentText"><p>Because one is theory, and the other is reality.</p>

<p>In theory, Lauri is worth more on a long-term deal as opposed to expiring.</p>

<p>Reality is, it doesnt matter because Lauri <em>has</em> extended, and we won&rsquo;t know what he could be traded for until next off-season when he is eligible to be traded.</p>

<p><em>If</em> he gets traded.</p>

      <label for="lh523nb" class="commentText"><p>Yea, although I believe his options are likely limited to Brooklyn, Washington, Houston, and San Antiono most likely. Two of those teams look like they&rsquo;ll be bottom feeders for the next 3 years (although by staying in Utah, Lauri has shown that might not be a deal breaker).</p>

<p>Houston has Jabari Smith who seems like a poor fit with Lauri</p>

<p>But the Spurs actually do seem like a good potential landing spot&hellip;.</p>

      <label for="lh5561x" class="commentText"><p>The only issue with trading Lauri down the line is his contract actually increases over the years.  Not sure a team would pay close to 50 million for a legit 3rd option</p>

      <label for="lh5fg7v" class="commentText"><p>Yeah but realistically only ~2.5% in the last year (projected 54.1m if he had got all raises).</p>

<p>Yeah the cap is going up, but this specific CBA looks to have really hurt that third max slot on good teams. </p>

<p>He is an off ball player, arguably one of the best in the league, but your really need to be able to create your own shot got truly be considered a second option. Hell look at PG, he is a pretty good on ball creator but is likely to be a 3rd option now.</p>

<p>I think this is where a lot of the reservation over this deal comes from. On a good to great team, is he worth this amount of money in the CBA era of punitive aprons.</p>

      <label for="lh5gse5" class="commentText"><p>Exactly.  People are overthinking this.  Lauri is an asset.  They have locked that asset up.  They will still be bad and will still get good draft picks to get more assets.  They already have a ton.  They are setup to do a big trade if one presents itself, or just keep grinding trying to get more assets.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t rebuild in the NBA by trying to liquidate every good player you have for draft picks.</p>

<p>You do it by accumulating assets.  Young good players are assets.</p>

      <label for="lh57emz" class="commentText"><p>I remember seeing Jazz vs Wizards tickets for $7 during the 2nd half of last season. I imagine a full-on tank would obliterate ticket sales even worse than they already were, and the FO would not let that happen. Especially with the lottery odds not even making a full-season tank worth it anymore.</p>
