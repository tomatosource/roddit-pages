      <label for="l6c6twj" class="commentText"><p>Frankly I think it has to do with the fact that he’s 1) French and 2) easy to clown on someone without much of an offensive game, especially here or on Twitter. Like I’ll be honest, I’m not smart enough to comprehend an NBA-level defense, but I like to think it’s still an eye test thing that Rudy is an absolute net positive on the court. People who watch highlights and ESPN clips of Perk being an asshole think Rudy is useless.</p>

<p>Rudy gets clowned on because A) He looks awkward when he plays B) Most fans aren&rsquo;t capable of evaluating good defense (If you get scored on, you&rsquo;re bad). That&rsquo;s it.</p>

      <label for="l6csncc" class="commentText"><p>It didn&rsquo;t used to be that way which is interesting to me. Anti-french campaign started in US media during early 2000s when France refused to participate in the &ldquo;war on terror&rdquo; because their intel said the weapons of mass destruction - the thing that the US was rallying people around as a reason it had to happen - didn&rsquo;t exist. And they were ultimately proven right!</p>

<p>However, the media went constantly about how weak the French are, how they always surrender, their national flag is just a white flag, and things of that nature that it just stuck in peoples head and became a &ldquo;truth&rdquo; in US society.</p>

<p>Note: it&rsquo;s not remotely true. At the time, France had won something like 14 of its last 16 wars and their military was always held in high regard. It was just US politicians and media in an uproar that someone told them &ldquo;no&rdquo; (at least for a while, they did eventually cave and join) EDIT: I was mixing up Afghanistan and Iraq here. France was in from the start in 2001 in Afghanistan. It was 2003&rsquo;s Iraq war that France opposed which kickstarted the response I&rsquo;m referring to.</p>

<p>There are a couple podcasts on the whole situation if you find that interesting.</p>

<p>“You put so much stock in winning wars,” the grubby iniquitous old man scoffed. “The real trick lies in losing wars, in knowing which wars can be lost. Italy has been losing wars for centuries, and just see how splendidly we’ve done nonetheless. France wins wars and is in a continual state of crises. Germany loses and prospers. Look at our own recent history. Italy won a war in Ethiopia and promptly stumbled into serious trouble. Victory gave us such insane delusions of grandeur that we helped start a world war we hadn’t a chance of wining. But now that we are losing again, everything has taken a turn for the better, and we certainly will come up on top again if we succeed in being defeated.”</p>

<p>French here, we were from the beginning in 2001 in Afghanistan, the uproar was because we didn&rsquo;t join in 2003 in Irak. I was quite young then, but I clearly remember that we were shown pictures comparing military sites with French satellites on one side, and on the other side a picture the US used to justify the existence of the weapons of mass destruction. The French pictures just showed less buildings basically.</p>

<p>(Also, I can say from my experience in the States that being French is often more seen as a positive, but that could be area dependent I guess. Certainly it&rsquo;s not at all felt like people hold a huge distaste for us, minus general opinions about Parisians being assholes which&hellip; well, is true, especially towards US tourists who are also often assholes lol)</p>

      <label for="l6cwbbb" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s his Frenchness but I do remember there was a narrative that Gobert precipitated the NBA taking the unprecedented step of canceling its season for Covid right after a press conference with him. The one where he tippy-tapped all the mics to show he didn&rsquo;t care about Covid and it was overblown. Then 2 days later he&rsquo;s diagnosed with it and the NBA said oh shit, oh fuck cancel everything.</p>

<p>I know that&rsquo;s not exactly how it played out but there was that narrative briefly following the shutdown.</p>

<p>You can swap Gobert in that and it&rsquo;d still be true lol. Sets the best screens in the league, can be a force on the offensive glass, and is always at the top or near the top in FG% due to his dunks. He&rsquo;s also pretty good at drawing fouls and isn&rsquo;t completely helpless at the free throw line, like some other rim runners i.e. Deandre Jordan</p>

<p>He was a big part in making Utah&rsquo;s offense one of the best in the league during the Mitchell years.</p>

It&rsquo;s embarrassing to watch Rudy with the ball more than 3 feet away from the basket and have that moment of, &ldquo;oh no. He&rsquo;s about to make a move.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He&rsquo;d get a lot less clowning if he didn&rsquo;t have hands of stone. He fumbles the ball half the time, or gets it stripped as soon as someone puts a finger on the ball.</p>

<p>Neither of these things are something Gobert can do lol. More important Draymond contributes these things at nearly HALF of Gobert&rsquo;s salary. A team with Steph Klay and Gobert would be playing vet mins and MLEs.</p>

      <label for="l6cubky" class="commentText"><p>It’s 100% an eye test thing and if you watch games involving Rudy, you’ll see 15 instances a night where a guy is dribbling around the elbow and in the paint, tries approaching the basket, and then instead of shooting just keeps dribbling because Rudy’s presence took away what they thought was an attractive shot. He alters offensive plays all the time.</p>

      <label for="l6cnr1i" class="commentText"><p>The issue is entirely due to his contract and the idea that maybe a purely defensive player shouldn&rsquo;t be worth that much. Draymond gets paid half of Gobert and he&rsquo;s infinitely better on the offensive end due to passing. An elite offensive player will make the offense elite (Luka, Jokic, Harden). An elite defensive player isn&rsquo;t guaranteed to make the team&rsquo;s defense elite (AD, Wemby, Caruso). Especially in the modern NBA.</p>

<p>So when people see someone who makes 41 mill a year be unable to score in the post, it rubs them the wrong way. Especially when he&rsquo;s in the same position as Embiid, Jokic, and Wemby.</p>

I really do think Draymond shoehorning in his Rudy beef whenever possible combined with the image of Luka scoring a gamewinner over Rudy in spite of some pretty solid defense have both contributed to a lot of inappropriate criticism.</p>

In Game 4, he was switching onto Kyrie and defending him well. But that won&rsquo;t be talked about. Just that one possession when one of the best isolation players hit a shot on him will be talked about and people will say he needs to return his DPOY trophies bc a guy hit a shot on him thus he&rsquo;s &ldquo;played off the floor&rdquo; 🙄</p>

<p>But like you said, Luka is just that good. The conversation should be about him, not the defender</p>

A lot of them look like totally normal offensive possessions that end in a missed jumper, not realizing how much of an impact he had because he looks kinda uncoordinated on the floor.</p>

<p>Most bigs cant end up on that island with people like harden or kawhi, meaning you have to run a different scheme, or they end up fouling, or they buy more space and dont get their shot impacted.</p>

<p>Its kinda like how a ton of interceptions in the NFL are actually because of QB pressures. They dont show up a ton in stat sheets, but man do they make an impact.</p>

      <label for="l6cw9nm" class="commentText"><p>But haven&rsquo;t you heard that AD, who couldn&rsquo;t stop Jamal Murray (not a borderline MVP) from hitting a game winning 3 pointer, would have shut Doncic down and absolutely destroyed him on that possession!??!  After all, failing to guard the perimeter in the first round is <em>definitely</em> a sign that you would lock that shit up in the third round against a significantly more skilled and bigger opponent while on an island&hellip;</p>

<p>Serious lack of Lakers flairs in this thread talking that dumb baseless shit, wacky how they all just disappeared after game 4.</p>

      <label for="l6cii12" class="commentText"><p>Right?  Luka is a top 50 player of all time, perhaps top 25 and he&rsquo;s at his prime right now.  He&rsquo;s 25 years old and likely has another 5 years or so of playing at his current level.  Rudy has some trouble with him.  Rudy is one of the few that can contain him.  He has also shut Luka down a couple times.  Not in this series, but in games past.</p>

      <label for="l6c1bgl" class="commentText"><p>108, 109, 116, and 100. It’s comical that anyone would think defense is the issue for the Wolves. And they have by far the best defensive rating when he’s on the floor. Gobert is just an easy target, but he’s been good this series on the defensive end. Yeah, Luka hit a game winner over him. But so did Murray over AD and nobody said shit about that.</p>

<p>My main issue with Rudy is actually on the offensive side. On top of his butterfingers, the guy consistently fails to set solid screens and just rolls to the basket clogging up the paint.</p>

<p>Gafford and Lively set <strong>hard</strong> screens and they don’t just roll right to the basket every single time. They’ll stay back a bit, give Luka or Kyrie space at the rim, and come in from an angle. They clear the defender out and themselves. It makes the defender have to think about where they are on the floor. Rudy just runs right to the rim which is exactly where the defender wants to be anyways. It’s infuriating and you can see some frustration from Ant when the paint is completely clogged because Rudy has just parked himself there.</p>

It was be design and it nearly worked with game 4 being so tight but Steph being Steph was the difference. We switched up the coverage in game 5 and Steph was bad in that game but Klay and Wiggins absolutely cooked us. The level of attention paid to the details of the game is unbelievable bad.</p>

<p>the explanation why Gobert has a high ORtg i suspect is mainly because good defense translates into easier opportunities on offense.</p>

<p>fun fact, for Dallas the highest ORtg is Lively at 199 followed by Doncic at 123.</p>

      <label for="l6c8aor" class="commentText"><p>Transition offense is part of it. He also is HUGE on improving other players offense. He’s like an entire offensive line on football, improving the success of everyone else in four out.</p>

<p>Jazz had the number one offense in the nba with 7 &amp;gt;39% 3 point shooters bc gobert makes everyone get OPEN 3 point looks. (Believe me we didn’t have 7 naturally good 40% 3 point shooters)</p>

<p>His screen assisting then rim rolling allows for the guy with the ball to get space to shoot a 3, and he makes defenders have to tag him under the basket or else he gets a dunk (called gravity), which causes another defender to have to sag in, and you can pass to another perimeter player for an open 3. If they don’t sag in, then he gets a free 2 points at the rim off a pass or lob.</p>

<p>His constant screening then rim rolling opens everyone else up for open catch and shoot 3s</p>

<p>So in essence you got a player who is the best in defense and makes everyone else better on offense, giving you an extremely overall high net impact player on both defense and offense (even if he has cinderblocks for hands and can’t create his own offense.)</p>

If you read the article, the stats back that up.  And if you watch Rudy when he&rsquo;s not shooting, he&rsquo;s creating at a high level off ball.  Elite off ball skills and feel for the game.  Not to mention Rudy&rsquo;s getting you 3-4 more possessions through offensive rebounding which is double to triple what you&rsquo;re getting from KAT/Naz.  +3-4 more possessions is +3-4 more points per game.</p>

<p>KAT Gobert PnR has always been productive because KAT really does look to feed him whenever possible.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with Gobert is when he&rsquo;s stopped on his roll and he posts up. Anytime he dribbles more than a couple of seconds it&rsquo;s going to be iffy. Someone should be cutting immediately imo</p>

<p>I still remember Ben Simmons (back when he was a relevant NBA player and in contention for DPOY) talking about how he&rsquo;d scored so much against the Jazz, even though he wasn&rsquo;t known as a scorer.</p>

<p>This ignores the facts that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Jazz won the game, which was kinda the important bit.</p></li>

<li><p>Gobert wasn&rsquo;t even his primary defender, and barely guarded him.</p></li>

<li><p>Jordan Clarkson, who Simmons <em>was</em> guarding, scored a season high of like 40 points that game.  Which when we&rsquo;re talking about DPOY bona fides&hellip;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>But yeah, Gobert tends to get blame for everything.  And I mostly wanted to shit on Ben Simmons for old times&rsquo; sake.</p>

And based on what I’m reading it doesn’t matter that an all time great player is cooking you it only matters that you got cooked</p>

Like 2 years ago when the Lakers just straight up stopped guarding Dillon Brooks.  Go ahead Dillon, take that 3!  Then he&rsquo;d make 1 and mean mug everyone.  Dude, they LET you shoot!</p>

      <label for="l6dnt2r" class="commentText"><p>Lowe and Simmons have also had this creepy ass vendetta against harden for over a decade now. Literally any metric or stat you want to use has harden as an all time great playoff performer.</p>

<p>Like after maxeys bad game when Simmons was discussing it on his podcast he said “it’s really hard to have two good playoff games in a row…as harden and PG could tell us hahaha”…when through the first four games harden was averaging 26 on by far the highest efficiency of any scorer in the playoffs.</p>

<p>And after the 2018 season Zach Lowe said he would never vote harden for mvp again no matter what, which imo that kind of open bias should get your vote taken away, and then in 2019 harden has one of the greatest seasons ever averaging 8 more ppg than the second leading scorer (which is absolutely absurd) to drag a bunch of trash to 50+ wins in the west and then outplayed Steph in their playoff series…and didn’t win mvp because half the voters just listen to whatever Zach Lowe says</p>

      <label for="l6c4egh" class="commentText"><p>Other than his presence seeming to motivate Luka, as a Mavs fan I’m always happy to see him leave the game. He’s really good, even with his struggles scoring when he can’t just dunk it. And we saw last game that when the Mavs didn’t have a true center on the court that him as an offensive liability is mostly no longer the case. He can just pivot around a guy like Powell and at his height he can more easily make the extra pass when there’s not length bothering him.</p>

<p>Honestly, the ultimate irony about this series — and the beef he and Luka have in general — is that the two playing together would be absurdly good. I adore Lively and Gafford (and think Lively’s ceiling is in the stratosphere), but imagine Gobert catching lobs from Luka. His shortcomings would be masked by how often he’d score simply from Luka spoon feeding him.</p>

      <label for="l6cf33m" class="commentText"><p>That’s kinda my point — they’re all pretty limited as post players and are only efficient on offense when rim-running.</p>

<p>Lively is better than Gafford at passing off the catch when Luka or Kyrie is blitzed and it’s basically 4 on 3. My sense is he’s also better than Gobert as a passer, but I could be wrong on that if he’s shown more talent in that area than what I’ve seen over the years.</p>

      <label for="l6dqsae" class="commentText"><p>The thing with Gobert offensively is sometimes he can cook and you’ll be left with your mouth wide open thinking I didn’t know Rudy could do that. Then other times his hands turn to stone and he can’t catch the ball. Its very inconsistent at times but he can be an extremely efficient scorer at the rim and even if he does get stone hands every once in a while he’s getting us into the bonus and get other guys in foul trouble.</p>

<p>To answer your question though, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a huge difference between the three of them. They have comparable turnover rates and offensive rebound rates, and I think they are all similarly effective as play finishers. I do think Lively is much better in the short roll than the other two.</p>

<p>Hard to measure all of their impact in so few games, but Rudy is definitely the better screener, gaff/lively have better hands, and lively is the better passer. None of them should be putting the ball on the floor.</p>

<p>Id say overall theyre similar, although livelys ceiling is the moon. Crazy how good he is at 20.</p>

<p>He’d probably respond with something like “as a big man shooting wasn’t my job” which then leads us to the question why is there such a focus put on Rudy’s performance defending top guards on the perimeter (where he’s still good, but definitely beatable) when that’s not really a big man’s job either</p>

He comes from a long playoff history on the Jazz, then comes to the TWolves who&rsquo;ve never had any success whatsoever and have a bunch of players who can never get anything done. He then leads them to the WCF in his second year there. How does he get so much hate?</p>

<p>Here are recent DPOYs and the playoff hate they received:</p>

<p>2024: Gobert is a bum because Luka and Jokic cooked him</p>

<p>2023: Jaren Jackson Jr is a bum because he doesn&rsquo;t rebound</p>

<p>2022: Marcus Smart isn&rsquo;t even the best defensive player in his team. They just gave it to him because they had to give it to a Celtic</p>

<p>2021: Rudy Gobert is a bum because he can&rsquo;t guard everyone on the Clippers at once</p>

<p>2020: If Giannis is such a good defensive player, why isn&rsquo;t he guarding Jimmy Butler more?</p>

      <label for="l6cebbx" class="commentText"><p>It’s hard for people to contextualize defense over the course of a full game which is where Gobert shines. Like, in a 100 possession game, teams may take 25 shots at the rim against Gobert vs 50 shots for your average center. Regardless of what else happens in a game, if the offense gets 25 less possessions of shooting a high percentage shot in the paint, their offense just isn’t gonna be as good. People see Rudy get scored on and are like he can’t possibly be the dpoy, but that’s not really what is special about his defense.</p>

<p>If he had just 1 or 2 DPOYs then he wouldn’t be thought of as overrated, but as it stands it kinda seems like he just gets the award every year where there isn’t another obvious choice based on performance/narrative.</p>

<p>The fact that he doesn’t put up eye popping counting stats and isn’t a lock down multi-positional defender doesn’t help his case either. People love a big block a lot more than they love solid help side defense, and everyone loves when a great defender puts someone in a straight jacket.</p>

<p>There’s a clear disconnect between how Gobert is viewed by fans and voters and how he’s viewed by other players.</p>

<p>The media exists for fans, so they&rsquo;re going to partake in this cycle of narrative building, which only serves to reinforce fans&rsquo; dumb BS. Just have some self-awareness of why you think what you do and where your opinions are coming from.</p>

<p>Gobert is clearly one of the greatest defenders ever. There&rsquo;s no secret &ldquo;but actually, he&rsquo;s a bum and a fraud&rdquo;. He plays against other great players who can succeed every once and a while against him. Sometimes that happens in big moments. That doesn&rsquo;t change the fact Gobert&rsquo;s an awesome defender. Sports are a zero-sum game; when a great defender goes up against a great scorer, one of them has to lose. Don&rsquo;t let the previous game&rsquo;s box score completely shape your reality. It&rsquo;s immature.</p>

      <label for="l6cbr2a" class="commentText"><p>Rudy is a really good player but I can’t fucking stand this whole “here are stats, I’m right” sports world we live in now. Instead of citing a stat to  how about you go watch the game and breakdown every play to see how we got to the numbers you’re presenting. That way there’s no miss on who is to get credit or blame.</p>

<p>But nah. No nuance in these conversations anymore. Just stats. Acknowledging Rudy is good while also pointing out how he gets hunted by other teams consistently in playoff matchups due to poor perimeter defense is blasphemy. No room for that</p>

<p>For the record, as I said at the top, I think Gobert is a really good player. I don’t think Rudy is the sole reason the wolves are losing, anyone who is solely blaming Rudy is an idiot. In fact, I’d argue he’s in the minority of blame to go around.</p>

<p>Honestly the biggest reason he’s getting all this flak is all his DPOY’s. In an era of space, pace, and high volume 3pt shooting I don’t think it’s crazy to want whoever wins DPOY to be able to guard the perimeter better. Back in the day, no one was really shooting 3’s the way teams do now so it made sense for DPOY to almost always go to a shot blocker. See: Bam, Wemby, AD, JJJ. Before anyone takes that the wrong way, no one is saying these bigs I listed need to be Marcus Smart or Jrue Holiday, but objectively those guys all protect the paint really well AND aren’t liabilities on the perimeter to the point they’re being hunted for an iso every single fucking play</p>

<p>i just don’t think having that much salary wrapped up into someone with gobert’s flaws (let alone trading 5 firsts and more for him) is smart team building. but then again, they beat the defending champs so anything can happen i guess</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You have to address why he has these insane numbers if you want to argue things like above. Stats can be misleading but so can the &ldquo;eye test&rdquo;. If you want to argue that Rudy is a bad playoff player then you will need to explain why he has these elite playoff stats. Cant just ignore them.</p>

The eye test doesn&rsquo;t support those claims either unless you ignore everything but his mistakes and awkward moments (like much of the NBA viewership does)</p>

<p>There are definitely valid criticisms of Rudy, but anything suggesting he&rsquo;s a net detriment to the team is simply not based in reality</p>

<p>Also, stats can be effective in dispelling an argument or narrative, my whole thing, even tho I generally agree on Rudy, is I don’t like it when a stat or stats is someone’s entire take. Basketball, a team sport, is much more nuanced than that. Again, stats can certainly be helpful. No debate there</p>

<p>His “bad” possessions look worse than normal because of his gangly body proportions but fact of the matter is if Rudy is defending on the perimeter you’re still better off with him than about 97% of bigs in the league.</p>

<p>Rudy’s bar is that high because 1) he’s really good 2) the DPOY’s, which like I said, I personally think is a big season he has so much attention coming his way. Take away this years DPOY and I’d bet while still being attacked to an extent, it’d be lesser than what we have going on.</p>

      <label for="l6cbuyq" class="commentText"><p>To me the wildest point was when Stan Van Gundy, the guy who coached Dwight Howard to DPOYs and MVPs, was getting on drop coverage as the reason why one time Derrick Jones Jr blew by Naz Reid because Naz got blown by one time on a closeout. Gobert shut down both the roller (Gafford) and Luka was in an awkward spot but a completely unrelated breakdown got blamed on Rudy by pretty much THE expert on this type of defense.</p>

      <label for="l6cnqk6" class="commentText"><p>The on/off stats are good for the lazy &ldquo;Gobert bad&rdquo; criticism, but you just have to watch this series, or any playoff run from his Utah days, to understand why it might be impossible to win a title with Gobert in the starting lineup because of how bad the spacing becomes on offense.  You get far enough into the playoffs and the opposing offense is good enough to find ways to effectively pull Rudy out more to the perimeter and open up the paint a bit.  On the other end, teams have no reason to respect him as a roller so the ball handler just gets doubled every time. If they do manage to hit Rudy on the roll, there is plenty of time to rotate because he cannot dribble and cannot shot effectively from more than about 3&rsquo; out. You can also keep Rudy&rsquo;s defender just hanging out in the pant and dare him to do anything but stand there and pass when near the perimeter.  The only thing keeping these games close is Naz and KAT having absurd shooting games.</p>

      <label for="l6cw4ev" class="commentText"><p>The problem is you’re paying this guy absurd money and he’s not even doing what he’s known for doing very well this series. I can’t say I’ve watched every minute this post season, but he seems late on rotations this series, and he’s absolutely getting cooked down the stretch when he gets switched onto Luka or Kyrie. Fine, Kyrie and Luke cook everyone, but if your main job is defense and I’m paying you the max, you might need to put up a little resistance. It’s very possible you could find a decent rim protector, who is also a better rim runner, for 1/10th the salary and have used that money elsewhere. ANT and KAT deserve their criticism as well, but Rudy is getting attacked constantly, Jaden Hardy even was like yeah I’m gonna cook this guy. Rudy is 100% an 82 game player, and it’s hard to justify paying the max to a center in this era unless they are putting up Jokic level of efficiency.</p>

      <label for="l6du7sq" class="commentText"><p>This right here. Not only the max salary, but 4 DPOYs. He does not live up to either in the playoffs. When Jaden Hardy (and every other halfway decent guard) roasts your ass every year in the playoffs, you cannot be considered one of the best defenders of all time. Dude is even getting cooked on the interior by a rookie. Smh</p>

      <label for="l6cxaur" class="commentText"><p>I could find unimportant advanced stats to support or dismiss any player. Watching him with my eyes in the context of a basketball game leaves me very underwhelmed by his capabilities as a defender. Good rim protector/shot blocker, not great at anything else. Easily the most overrated defender of all time.</p>

      <label for="l6dv9o4" class="commentText"><p>Agreed. Game 2 vs Denver when Rudy missed the game for the birth of his son, the wolves had great defense without him. He doesn&rsquo;t seem necessary at all. People pointing to on/off numbers are dumb. There&rsquo;s all kinds of wild on/off numbers for various players. On/off is one of the most rudimentary stats there is. Has way more to do with who&rsquo;s on the court at the same time as you (both on your team and the opposing team) than anything that single player did. So dumb.</p>

<p>Minny is losing because KAT has been ass lol if he plays even slightly better this series is tied 2-2…even the Luka shot over Gobert wasn’t his fault, McDaniels should either never switched or doubled Luka…everybody knew wtf was gonna happen if u leave Gobert ona island w/Luka…coaching staff shoulda had KAT out there for tht possession</p>

<p>Gobert is who he is, you’re not gettin any offense outta him, he’s a great shot blker thats it</p>
