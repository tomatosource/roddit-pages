He didn&rsquo;t do anything detrimental (eg. the Blake Griffin trade before him), and the way he left the org is at a point where we have the most cap space in the league, but everything was on the margins and so we never got better.</p>

With our cap space the last few years we could‚Äôve been more aggressive instead of taking on dead cap contracts. He should‚Äôve made a lot more trades to address the flaws of our young core, instead of drafting them and hoping they‚Äôd learn to play together.</p>

<p>Ivey being forced into a 3andD role was a consequence of not trading/signing players to round out our young core</p>

      <label for="l6rwdb1" class="commentText"><p>I know it&rsquo;s the job of the GM to find trades and FA targets that make sense, but I would be very interested to see what his options even were. He made good trades at the deadline, so he was certainly capable of finding good value, but I wonder if there were fewer options for us in the offseason last year.</p>

I think it‚Äôs possible that Weaver knew he had to be aggressive to save this season, and we made those moves.</p>

<p>Last offseason could‚Äôve been due to a lack of options or a lack of aggression, or both, but I guess we‚Äôll never know</p>

<p>You‚Äôre a spurs fan, so you know with Wemby the clock is ticking and you need to be aggressive to build around him. I can‚Äôt see players like Cade or Wemby leaving their teams after their rookie contract is over (and not signing an extension), but we need to do a lot to keep them happy and show them we‚Äôre not wasting time and are doing everything we reasonably can to win a chip</p>

Cade&rsquo;s injuries hurt, but he just didn&rsquo;t ever seem to get the team on an exciting upward trajectory, partly because so many minutes were given to dead end young players (Bagley, Wiseman, etc).</p>

      <label for="l6sa7md" class="commentText"><p>Yup, that‚Äôs another problem lol. Picking up players like Josh Jackson, RJ Hampton, Bagley, Wiseman, Dennis Smith Jr are okay in the beginning, but not so much later where we had our own drafted young talent to play. We experimented in the beginning, but needed to take things seriously this last year.</p>

<p>Monty himself was also a problem. His coaching was terrible this year, but it also exposed and sabotaged Weaver in a way that Monty used what Weaver gave him in the team that he constructed. Playing Hayes and Livers was a Monty problem, but it was pieces originally brought out by Weaver. It took him trading/cutting them for Monty to stop playing them</p>

It might be because it&rsquo;s still an ongoing controversy that Weaver could have traded him sooner and got a much better return instead of holding on to him for way too long.

      <label for="l6s0vz3" class="commentText"><p>Eh, outside of Killian Hayes I really don&rsquo;t have anything against the man. I see he&rsquo;s process oriented which I like. But, I&rsquo;m not sure what that process actually was. Not sure he knew either, and that&rsquo;s probably what got him canned. It&rsquo;s all fine and well to bring on &ldquo;serious&rdquo; guys, but at some point there&rsquo;s some more behind that.</p>

<p>Monty Williams was a weird hiring. I think a coach of his caliber would prefer a veteran team over a young one at his stage of his career. I would have went with a younger coach.</p>

<p>Jaden Ivey&rsquo;s athleticism is superstar level, but his IQ is in the basement, so I&rsquo;m not sure when he&rsquo;ll come together. If ever.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just hoping Gores hired another process oriented guy and not someone trying to cheaply build the roster. That&rsquo;s how we ended up with Josh Smith, Blake Griffin, etc. I don&rsquo;t ever want to experience those days again.</p>

<p>Maybe Weaver was just one of those CEO&rsquo;s hired to clean house and take the fall. And he never got the trust to be the one behind the wheel with a clean slate. It is what it is. I&rsquo;m still highly skeptical of ownership, but it&rsquo;s not like I have a choice. üòÇ</p>

      <label for="l6s7l0q" class="commentText"><p>If you look at the situation he inherited, it‚Äôs hard to see how anyone could have done much better. I still think tanking for a few years was the right decision, especially for a chance at Wemby, but this past season was the year where we had to show at least a little progress if he wanted to keep his job.</p>

<p>Like you said, it does almost feel like he became the fall guy for riding out all the bad moves that came before him. They‚Äôre definitely in a better position going forward than they were on the day he was hired, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean he‚Äôs a good GM because anyone can intentionally tank for four years. But it does seem a bit of a raw deal that the next GM gets to start with all the assets and cap flexibility he built up instead of Blake Griffin‚Äôs albatross of a contract and Drummond‚Äôs negative trade value.</p>
