    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Now that it&rsquo;s been 8 years since the &ldquo;new chapter&rdquo; and everyone might be less butthurt about the move, do you think KD actually had a high chance at winning if he stayed with Russ? Also if we ignore &ldquo;loyalty to the organization&rdquo; stuff that no one will remember in 50 years anyways, do you think it was the best move from a selfish perspective of his achievements and numbers that actually <strong>will</strong> be remembered.</p>

<p>A team that took the 73-9 warriors to 7 games in the conference finals, and adding Al Horford and Oladipo the next season with KD entering his prime, Russ entering his physical prime wouldn’t be a problem?</p>

<p>People get so caught up on the “blown a 3-1 lead”, that they forget OKC was up 3-1 against one of the best teams ever in the first place! Choking implies that winning was easily attainable in the first place.</p>

      <label for="lildeim" class="commentText"><p>There’s literally nothing to suggest they would have gotten better next season. Rockets got way better next season too.</p>

<p>I’m not sure why people keep on say Oladipo when he was traded for Ibaka (and the only reason the trade happened was because KD left). It wasn’t like they got Oladipo for free and Oladipo only became good after getting traded to the Pacers. He would never thrived with two ball dominant players. </p>

<p>Then people are claiming Horford when if you just look it up, Horford never said he was signing with OKC. He just met with them since Billy Donovan was his college coach and then went with Boston because they offered a lot more. </p>

<p>And while it’s possible Horford wasn’t going to sign with OKC he’s very much on record since saying he was seriously considering going there before KD left. Most of the journalists following the teams at the time (Thunder and Celtics) believed he was going to OKC if KD stayed.</p>

      <label for="lilj4nj" class="commentText"><p>Ok you might be right on Oladipo but they traded Ibaka for him. They didn’t get him for free. And Oladipo wasn’t that good in OKC and would have been even worse with KD there. </p>

<p>Horford signed with Boston before the KD decision even came out so it’s the same idea as what you are saying with Oladipo. And KD going to the Warriors was a surprise so if Horford didn’t even wait until KD made a decision, I don’t think he was really considering OKC. </p>

<p>If they were only relevant because of KD, surely KD would’ve been able to beat the Grizzlies without dead weight on his team. And obviously PG isn’t KD, nor is <sup>18</sup>&frasl;<sub>19</sub> Russ <sup>15</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> Russ. You can see that in the impact metrics.</p>

<p>KD was so good in 2016 that he took the Warriors 3-1 by himself? Like you’re typing this and it makes sense to you?</p>

<p>Now, even though they took the dubs to 3-1 let’s not pretend it wouldn’t still be hard to take down prime Steph/Klay/Dray in future season.</p>

<p>But ya, if we did it all over and I had to bet, I’d say KD gets one if he stays </p>

      <label for="lilifx8" class="commentText"><p>they cant afford both, especially they still need to sign KD, they trade Ibaka for Victor, signing Al is the only way for them. Russ Entering his Prime is great but he will not be the same when he is alone. with KD he will not average Triple Double. and the fact that he will still not efficient and Turnover machine. I dont think that would help them.</p>

Also completely ignore the context that he was coming off a down year due to a Jones fracture, that is known to end the careers of 7 footers.</p>

<p>Be objective and put your bias aside. Yes it was the weakest move in history. But we can’t let it make us disingenuous in other aspects.</p>

<p>If they didn’t lose KD, they would have kept Ibaka and not traded him for Oladipo since they wouldn’t need him as a scorer. </p>

<p>They would have Westbrook - Robertson - KD - Ibaka - Adams. Still a good starting 5 but limited depth and bad spacing for the games vs the Warriors and Rockets at the early stages of this 3 point era. </p>

      <label for="lilkf9p" class="commentText"><p>Yeah people saying no are too young imo. The 2016 thunder should have beat the warriors that yeah, and the team would have undoubtedly gotten better that post season. The problem with that squad was always injuries before that point, and this was the first healthy season they had in a while. They would have had as good a shot as any to get 1 imo</p>

      <label for="lill0jg" class="commentText"><p>No, that&rsquo;s why he left. GSW wasn&rsquo;t getting any worse, and neither was LeBron and the Cavs.  They had GSW on the ropes in the WCF but you saw what their shortcomings as a team were.  Not to mention the Spurs won 67 games that year too and looked like they were going to be a problem with Kawhi for years to come.  2016 was their chance and they blew it, it wasn&rsquo;t going to get better from there even if Al Horford was going to come over like it was rumored.</p>

<p>Westbrook really fell off/got solved</p>

<p>maybe if they kept Harden and Westbrook was willing to take a 3rd option role but Westbrook lacks the self awareness and OKC was too cheap</p>
