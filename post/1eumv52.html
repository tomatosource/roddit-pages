    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Now that it&rsquo;s been 8 years since the &ldquo;new chapter&rdquo; and everyone might be less butthurt about the move, do you think KD actually had a high chance at winning if he stayed with Russ? Also if we ignore &ldquo;loyalty to the organization&rdquo; stuff that no one will remember in 50 years anyways, do you think it was the best move from a selfish perspective of his achievements and numbers that actually <strong>will</strong> be remembered.</p>

<p>A team that took the 73-9 warriors to 7 games in the conference finals, and adding Al Horford and Oladipo the next season with KD entering his prime, Russ entering his physical prime wouldn’t be a problem?</p>

<p>People get so caught up on the “blown a 3-1 lead”, that they forget OKC was up 3-1 against one of the best teams ever in the first place! Choking implies that winning was easily attainable in the first place.</p>

<p>Russ with fucking AD and LeBron is not Russ with KD.</p>

<p>If they played winning basketball because of KD, why did KD struggle and lose badly to the Grizzlies when Russ got hurt in 2013? Yet every other year was Finals or conference finals</p>

<p>It’s such a ridiculous argument that people use to try to sound smarter than they are. “Yeah his team is way better with him on the court, but he doesn’t play winning basketball trust me!” 😂</p>

<p>If they were only relevant because of KD, surely KD would’ve been able to beat the Grizzlies without dead weight on his team. And obviously PG isn’t KD, nor is <sup>18</sup>&frasl;<sub>19</sub> Russ <sup>15</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> Russ. You can see that in the impact metrics.</p>

<p>how does that make sense to you? you&rsquo;re saying a team that gets handicapped a max player&rsquo;s salary is supposed to win?</p>

<p>never said PG was yet he was as close as a KD replacement as you can get and finished top 3 in MVP voting. yet OKC were massively disappointing 1st round exits. sp Westbrook suddenly dropped off after KD left? how convenient&hellip;</p>

<p>who said he did it by himself? and did they end up winning the series? no because you can&rsquo;t rely on such an inefficient, high volume guard to be consistent enough to win 4 series</p>

<p>… what? Yes it is when the context is all about ceiling raising. Russ and KD apart lost in 13 and 15. Russ and KD together were right there at championship level in 12, 14, and 15.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>missed more games than that</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He missed 36 games.</p>

<p>Yes they are supposed to win lmfao. You’re saying he makes the team worse by not playing winning basketball. So the team that competes every year should fly through the league once he’s hurt right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how convenient</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can see it in the impact metrics lmfao, they are right there for you to see. Are you implying that KD was the reason Russ could make free throws his whole career too once his finger surgeries fucked with his shot? Use your head dude lmfao.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>can’t rely on an inefficient high volume guard</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Yeah instead they could rely on him to win 3 and go 7 with the most winningest team ever. I’m sure, it’s all Russ fault we lost to the Warriors. Let’s just ignore KD’s 54 TS%</strong> let me stop wasting my time.</p>

      <label for="lilrten" class="commentText"><p>the fact that westbrook never practiced shooting tells me enough. dude is the poster child for getting by off athleticism. compare him to his teammate who had to play the bench but well enough he got a chance. blew up instantly and changed or added to his game literally every year to either fill what was needed or create a new system. then in the last of his prime years changed his game 180 to fit his new teammated to create another new system and style. etc etc. harden added maybe like 8 new skills to his game and westbrook legit did not add the one skill that all of modern basketball revolves around… one that nearly every single gaurd can do&hellip; but i mean i get it its a lot of work to be a good nba shooter. but the fact he refused to change his mindset and style is something else. but becasue he yelled loud yall thought he was the one giving his all and loved the game… he tricked yall lol.</p>

<p>Now, even though they took the dubs to 3-1 let’s not pretend it wouldn’t still be hard to take down prime Steph/Klay/Dray in future season.</p>

      <label for="lilifx8" class="commentText"><p>they cant afford both, especially they still need to sign KD, they trade Ibaka for Victor, signing Al is the only way for them. Russ Entering his Prime is great but he will not be the same when he is alone. with KD he will not average Triple Double. and the fact that he will still not efficient and Turnover machine. I dont think that would help them.</p>

      <label for="limi9op" class="commentText"><p>People confidently saying OKC was adding Horford in 2017 and talking about Oladipo disregarding it cost them Ibaka, which was a center piece in that 2016 OKC roster, and pretend to say that OKC would have been a problem, are just saying so in bad faith.</p>

<p>Sorry man, but when you don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about this happens.</p>

<p>No OKC wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem, and you know why? Because despite everything that happened in 2016, OKC was still the 4th best team in the league. They won&rsquo;t get any better in 2017. Maybe you can say in 2018 they could have been better keeping Oladipo and growing Sabonis and KD and Russ and Adams&hellip; but the reality is Russ was and still is a mess player that is an actual floor deminisher for the team as well as a cap to their potential.</p>

<p>There is no world where KD staying in OKC could have ever won a chip. Maybe, just maybe, if you considered deeper in the future, Russ trade for CP3, then covid happens, KD without his achilles injuries, and maybe I could see them winning in the bubble because it was so strange and peculiar that maybe a team that stick around for so long, plus CP3 rather than Russ, would have been the favourite. But now you are basically playing multi-string theory, not even sliding doors&hellip;</p>

      <label for="lileusx" class="commentText"><p>It’s a consensus that players enter their prime from 27-32, yet when it comes to KD people insist that he peaked at 24-25, just to take away from his golden state years saying he didn’t get better. Also completely ignore the context that he was coming off a down year due to a Jones fracture, that is known to end the careers of 7 footers.</p>

<p>Be objective and put your bias aside. Yes it was the weakest move in history. But we can’t let it make us disingenuous in other aspects.</p>

<p>If they didn’t lose KD, they would have kept Ibaka and not traded him for Oladipo since they wouldn’t need him as a scorer. </p>

<p>They would have Westbrook - Robertson - KD - Ibaka - Adams. Still a good starting 5 but limited depth and bad spacing for the games vs the Warriors and Rockets at the early stages of this 3 point era. </p>

<p>In hindsight adding those guys who provide offense and no defense was a bad fit, the team should have stacked the team with defense since they have two guys who can get 30 a piece.</p>

<p>How? They won everything (and 67 wins, something a thunder team has also never achieved of course)</p>

<p>The fact is we don’t know who would have won but the 2015 warriors were better than any iteration of any thunder team ever assembled unless you don’t care about net rating, SRS, wins and actual success.</p>

<p>Because you can’t see the point I am making I will be more explicit. Winning 67 games doesn’t mean you are guaranteed a championship. What it <em>does indicate</em> is that the team is a very good and isn’t some easy out. Saying the west was at its weakest point misses the fact that the 2015 warriors are better than any thunder team assembled. And considering KD/WB’s history of choking when it mattered, I wouldn’t put much confidence in them to beat a 67 win juggernaut.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>With its best player playing directly off an injury that takes months to heal while the thunder were fully healthy.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If curry was healthy probably not even though he directly outplayed both KD and Russ.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I guess what matters is what actually happened. It is unfortunate that the 2015 thunder were injured and Pat bev annihilated Russ’s knees but that is sports.</p>

<p>Steph was better in 2016 than 2015 by a huge margin anyways … he averaged 28 on 61 TS while dancing and yelling im back (and proceeding to be terrible in the finals). We were better than <em>any</em> team he played in 2015.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Think for one second please. Youre saying a team that took a better version of the same team to 7 couldn’t beat the 67 win version? Choking? Lmfao isn’t that what Steph did in the 15 and 16 Finals by your logic? So is he not capable of it too all of a sudden?</p>

<p>Yes that is sports and yes me saying I think we could’ve beaten them is a hypothetical. Why debate the hypothetical and then try to say “it doesn’t matter anyways!” when you realize how dumb your forced rebuttal is?</p>

<p>Yes and he was still playing injured. If you want to discount his injury, then please discount any OKC injury as well. The fact is, curry beat Westbrook and KD at the height of their powers while injured.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sure. But if we equate his play to KD and WB in the OKC playoffs, he was elite.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Its best player was injured. And while that matters, the 67 win team was better defensively.</p>

<p>No insecurity here. All of us in the Bay Area have a bunch of championships we celebrated. OKC has none.</p>

And if you still add PG the following season, that&rsquo;s obviously an insane core. If you don&rsquo;t? Oladipo probably still develops well as a #3 and, even from day one, Sabonis was the surest I&rsquo;ve ever been about a future star. They had tons of routes to stay a top-tier contender for years.</p>

      <label for="lime497" class="commentText"><p>Yes. Anyone who&rsquo;s says no just didn&rsquo;t actually watch basketball during that era. The only thing that kept us from winning a ring between our finals run and the GSW series was injuries. We had a Russ torn knee, Kevin broken foot, Ibaka injured during Spurs series, and I feel like I might be missing on more.</p>

<p>Our first healthy playoffs after the final run, we were up 3-1 on the greatest regular season team of all time before choking. If Kevin stayed, we were set up to get Al Horford. We very well could have still started a dynasty at that point.</p>

The 2016 thunder should have beat the warriors that year, and the team would have undoubtedly gotten better that post season. The problem with that squad was always injuries before that point, and this was the first healthy season they had in a while. They would have had as good a shot as any to get 1 imo</p>

GSW wasn&rsquo;t getting any worse, and neither was LeBron and the Cavs.  They had GSW on the ropes in the WCF but you saw what their shortcomings as a team were.  Not to mention the Spurs won 67 games that year too and looked like they were going to be a problem with Kawhi for years to come.  2016 was their chance and they blew it, it wasn&rsquo;t going to get better from there even if Al Horford was going to come over like it was rumored.</p>

      <label for="liloxz7" class="commentText"><p>I dont think so. The league started to change rapidly after 2014 and eventually Westbrook&rsquo;s lack of shooting would have been an issue in the post season. The talent on the roster would have dried up as Kanter, Roberson, and Ibaka were going to be unplayable at a certain point.</p>

<p>I also think Golden State and Houston were better teams.</p>

<p>They weren&rsquo;t better than the Warriors, they weren&rsquo;t better than the Cavs, they had major spacing issues. People get so caught up in &ldquo;had a 3-1 lead!!&rdquo; not realizing there is a reason they lost 3 straight games in the first place. The fact that it even went 7 games was the surprising part, not that the Warriors won the series.</p>

      <label for="limv8h7" class="commentText"><p>The Thunder had  3 really good opportunities that blew up because of injuries after the Harden trade (2013: Beverly injures Westbrook in the first round, lose in the second to the Grizzlies 2014: Ibaka injured in the WCF, lose to the Spurs 2015: KD misses most of the regular season, Westbrook gets a hole in his face, Ibaka misses part of the regular season, miss the playoffs). I truly believe that 2013 was THE year, but any one of those years could’ve been it.</p>

<p>If you really look at it in 2017 it’s reported that Al Horford would’ve came to the Thunder, they already got Oladipo, and they still could’ve drafted Sabonis. If you’re tracking, that means they would’ve still had Oladipo and Sabonis, which was the PG trade package. So yes, I do believe eventually they would’ve won a title</p>

      <label for="lio34za" class="commentText"><p>No. Westbrook was an athletic stat padder and KD wasn’t and still isn’t good enough to do it on his own. The Thunder weren’t going to stop the rise of the Curry Warriors. The only thing that would have stopped that was an intact Heatles group in an alternate timeline where LeBron stays in Miami and Bosh doesn’t develop blood clots.</p>

      <label for="limio3r" class="commentText"><p>There is no world where KD staying in OKC could have ever won a chip. And that&rsquo;s because OKC in 2016 was the 4th best team, the year after they still wouldn&rsquo;t have been better than the Warriors and the Spurs, and Houston was coming too. The main issue being having Russ as your point guard put you in bona-fide 1st round bound team, second round at best.</p>

<p>Maybe, just maybe, if you considered deeper in the future, Russ trade for CP3, then covid happens, KD without his achilles injuries, and maybe I could see them winning in the bubble because it was so strange and peculiar that maybe a team that stick around for so long, plus CP3 rather than Russ, would have been the favourite. But now you are basically playing multi-string theory, not even sliding doors&hellip;</p>
