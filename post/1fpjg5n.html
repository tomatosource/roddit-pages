</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Wanna know what the community thinks on this one. Bucks were not great under Doc. Some injuries played a part, sure, but the offense was a lot worse under Doc than Griffin. Defense improved, but was still only league average. They went from a top 10 offense, bottom 10 defense to slightly above (O) and slightly below (D) average on both ends. Bucks started 3-7 under Doc, hit a winning streak, but ended up basically a .500 team over a large sample.</p>

<p>Bucks improved on defense by playing at a slower pace and by going back to some of the principles that worked in the past and simplifying their assignments. Dame was featured more under Doc. Being able to get the best out of both Dame and Giannis simultaneously is something that remains an open question. Bucks have improved their roster around their stars, IMO, quite a bit in the offseason with Wright, Trent, Prince additions. Their young guys should be improved, and I like their roster on paper a lot, but this is a make or break season in Milwaukee and it&rsquo;s starting with Middleton yet again under a bit of an injury cloud.</p>

<p>After the way things went last season, Doc will have a short leash. Out of 10, what do you think the likelihood is of Doc Rivers being fired midseason in Milwaukee?</p>

      <label for="loyh6h8" class="commentText"><p>Eh, honestly.</p>

<p>I think people who are blaming Darvin Ham for Lakers&rsquo; failures are misplacing their criticism. Replace Ham with Spo and I don&rsquo;t think they do much better. Maybe a 2nd round ceiling, that&rsquo;s it. Their roster was garbo.</p>

<p>Their shithole FO has been failing miserably for a decade plus, basically since Kobe&rsquo;s twilight. From 13-14 to 17-18 they had records of 27-55, 21-61, 17-65, 26-56 &hellip;.</p>

<p>That ain&rsquo;t coaching. It&rsquo;s a shit FO.</p>

<p>The only reason the Lakers became relevant was because LeBron decided to join them and bring AD along. And then they did some magic and built a rock solid team for 2020 and 2021. Then immediately got rid of their important core role players like KCP, Caruso, Kuzma, etc&hellip;.</p>

<p>If Lakers had Spo all season, they&rsquo;d have finished 5th or 6th seed, and maybe won the 1st round, and slapped in the 2nd round by the Wolves, Nuggets, Thunder or Mavs.</p>

<p>People overrate coaches way too much in the NBA; this ain&rsquo;t NFL.</p>

<p>The roster is far more important, and the Lakers roster is very subpar outside of LeBron and AD.</p>

<p>Ham had very little to do with those losses. Phil Jackon could have coached them and they&rsquo;d still have lost, though maybe not as pathetically.</p>

<p>I think you grossly overestimate a coach&rsquo;s impact to a NBA team&rsquo;s success and underestimate how shit that Lakers roster has been since 2022.</p>

<p>The options are a promoted assistant coach, which they tried and pulled the plug, getting one of the fired coaches, which is a lateral move, or taking a gamble with a college coach. Health is the main problem, not leadership.</p>

<p>That was mid season right before a west coast trip and he had 0 time to practice or get to know players. There’s a reason teams don’t fire coaches mid season.</p>

<p>They beat some great teams under Doc like Twolves, Celtics, nuggets, thunder and mavs iirc and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of those were blowouts. I think some of it was getting the team to lock in against bad teams which they failed at all season. That grizzlies loss right before allstar was the worst regular season loss I’ve seen by the bucks in awhile.</p>

      <label for="loy18m1" class="commentText"><p>I guess it’s not impossible, but I’d say it’s like a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>. Doc has historically been very good at not being fired by teams early in his tenure and if the Bucks struggle, it’ll likely be because the older guys on the team can’t perform at their own levels, which isn’t something easily laid at the feet of the head coach.</p>

<p>If Giannis asks that he get fired, he will be obviously, but how likely is that?</p>

      <label for="loy6df9" class="commentText"><p>This is why doc gets paid the big bucks. He is able to take blame better then most coaches. If you dont think he can scapegoat a bad situation next year then you havent been apart of a doc led team</p>

<p>Doc has created an anti poverty non-profit organization in every city he coaches in. Over 100,000 people helped.</p>

      <label for="loy2yrw" class="commentText"><p>Hopefully sooner rather than later I would like to see Dame stamped so I&rsquo;ll go 7-<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>. Not sure how this man keeps getting a job he&rsquo;s really been living off that celtics ring for too long now. Always has inherited championship aspiring team only to lose in the 1st or 2nd round usually in a 3-1 fashion too.</p>

<p>For someone who is supposed to be known as a players coach, it&rsquo;s surprising to see how many of his former players talk ill of him aside from the Celtics championship team.</p>

      <label for="loy3ij4" class="commentText"><p>Heres the truth. If doc get fired then that means dame and giannis are underperforming but they need a scape goat. Thats what nba coaches are there for. All that top 10 ranking stuff, you know whose fault it really is? It aint docs lol. Its the players. But ofc doc is so elite as his job he can scapegoat any situation but if everyones healthy. Dont see why they do bad. But it is funny if kawhi gets hurt its ofc so obvious. When giannis gets hurt its on doc? </p>
