</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Wanna know what the community thinks on this one. Bucks were not great under Doc. Some injuries played a part, sure, but the offense was a lot worse under Doc than Griffin. Defense improved, but was still only league average. They went from a top 10 offense, bottom 10 defense to slightly above (O) and slightly below (D) average on both ends. Bucks started 3-7 under Doc, hit a winning streak, but ended up basically a .500 team over a large sample.</p>

<p>Bucks improved on defense by playing at a slower pace and by going back to some of the principles that worked in the past and simplifying their assignments. Dame was featured more under Doc. Being able to get the best out of both Dame and Giannis simultaneously is something that remains an open question. Bucks have improved their roster around their stars, IMO, quite a bit in the offseason with Wright, Trent, Prince additions. Their young guys should be improved, and I like their roster on paper a lot, but this is a make or break season in Milwaukee and it&rsquo;s starting with Middleton yet again under a bit of an injury cloud.</p>

<p>After the way things went last season, Doc will have a short leash. Out of 10, what do you think the likelihood is of Doc Rivers being fired midseason in Milwaukee?</p>

<p>I think people who are blaming Darvin Ham for Lakers&rsquo; failures are misplacing their criticism. Replace Ham with Spo and I don&rsquo;t think they do much better. Maybe a 2nd round ceiling, that&rsquo;s it. Their roster was garbo.</p>

<p>Their shithole FO has been failing miserably for a decade plus, basically since Kobe&rsquo;s twilight. From 13-14 to 17-18 they had records of 27-55, 21-61, 17-65, 26-56 &hellip;.</p>

<p>That ain&rsquo;t coaching. It&rsquo;s a shit FO.</p>

<p>The only reason the Lakers became relevant was because LeBron decided to join them and bring AD along. And then they did some magic and built a rock solid team for 2020 and 2021. Then immediately got rid of their important core role players like KCP, Caruso, Kuzma, etc&hellip;.</p>

<p>If Lakers had Spo all season, they&rsquo;d have finished 5th or 6th seed, and maybe won the 1st round, and slapped in the 2nd round by the Wolves, Nuggets, Thunder or Mavs.</p>

<p>People overrate coaches way too much in the NBA; this ain&rsquo;t NFL.</p>

<p>The roster is far more important, and the Lakers roster is very subpar outside of LeBron and AD.</p>

<p>Ham had very little to do with those losses. Phil Jackon could have coached them and they&rsquo;d still have lost, though maybe not as pathetically.</p>

<p>I think you grossly overestimate a coach&rsquo;s impact to a NBA team&rsquo;s success and underestimate how shit that Lakers roster has been since 2022.</p>

Considering the Lakers lost to the (exhausted) Nuggets in 2024 by like really close games and even some buzzer beaters, it’s not that wild to think that a better coach with more experience in playoff basketball could help in making sure the Lakers kept their leads.</p>

<p>Nowhere did I say or imply this. Just like I didn&rsquo;t imply that it was the same FO during those seasons I mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>Your reading comprehension needs a lot of work, because you can&rsquo;t seem to grasp how basic English works.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m blaming the Lakers FO that actually built the team the last few years&hellip;.. for their failures the last few years instead of their coach who has been scapegoated.</p>

<p>Maybe you meant it differently, but that&rsquo;s literally what the words in the post say.</p>

<p>You make a claim: that Darvin Ham is being scapegoated and shouldn&rsquo;t be blamed.</p>

<p>You present your data to back up that claim: that the FO has been failing from 13-14 to 17-18, citing their records from those years.</p>

<p>You reach your conclusion: It is the front office that should be blamed instead.</p>

<p>I hate to break it to you, but it seems that it may in fact be your writing ability that needs a lot of work.</p>

<p>Consider for a second that maybe you&rsquo;re not as smart as you think you are. That maybe other people do know their own teams better than you. That when you say something and someone else misunderstands you, it&rsquo;s possible that the failure in communication occurred on your end instead.</p>

<p>Consider that before going around calling people dumbasses.</p>

      <label for="loy1gy4" class="commentText"><p>Low. The Bucks are in win now mode, and memes aside, Doc is a competant coach. Note that competant doesn&rsquo;t mean championship level good, but it&rsquo;s not like a Kerr, Spo, or Pop will be on the market any time soon.</p>

<p>The options are a promoted assistant coach, which they tried and pulled the plug, getting one of the fired coaches, which is a lateral move, or taking a gamble with a college coach. Health is the main problem, not leadership.</p>

He’s a known quantity so they’d look bad if they seem like they didn’t know what they were getting.  Also the bucks would take a PR hit firing an NBA lifer like Doc without giving him a real shot.</p>

<p>They gotta give him one full season unless they’re awful</p>

      <label for="lozdoje" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t know what your Xs and Os background is, but as a former assistant coach in an NCAA division one school and former head coach at a JC, I&rsquo;m guessing I know a lot more about Xs and Os and inspiration and human management - which is 80 percent of an NBA coaches job - than you do.</p>

<p>I can assure that if you think Doc &ldquo;stinks&rdquo;, it says more about you than it does about Doc. There are only ever about 25 or 30 coaches <strong>on earth</strong> who have coached championship teams.  Doc is one of them. Many of the others are retired. He&rsquo;s also made several credible playoff runs, and his teams usually win playoffs series they &ldquo;should&rdquo; win. Ie, most of the series he&rsquo;s lost, have been series he should have lost.</p>

<p>People think he&rsquo;s old fashioned and doesn&rsquo;t understand pace and space, but again, that says more about those people than it does about Doc. At the NBA level, coaches have assistants who are genius level at modern NBA basketball. The main job of the head coach is to keep the players focused, bought in to the system and culture, and to inspire them to play the best version of their game that they can. Doc is among the absolute best at that.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why MVP caliber players like KG, Chris Paul, and Joel Embiid are willing to accept him as their coach.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just shocking to me that random kids on the internet will think they&rsquo;re qualified to say a guy like that &ldquo;stinks&rdquo;.</p>

      <label for="lozkjqs" class="commentText"><p>God, what a miserable comment.</p>

<p>When people say a player or coach is bad, they obviously mean in comparison to the current coaches/players not in general. Yeah, he did a good job with a great team in 2008. They won that title when George W Bush was president. That doesn’t absolve him from criticism from “random kids” in 2024.</p>

<p>It’s very funny you say Doc wins most of the playoff series he’s expected to win. Disregarding the ones he’s lost as the higher seed and slight favorites — which is a lot! — he’s the only coach to blow three 3-1 playoff series. It’s so difficult to go 0-3 after being up 3-1…and he did it three times! At best, his playoff track record is pretty mediocre.</p>

<p>Spending 25 years as a head coach — 20 of which have been with teams that were objectively big title contenders — and the one ring is with clearly most talented team in the league at the time is not that impressive of a record.</p>

<p>That was mid season right before a west coast trip and he had 0 time to practice or get to know players. There’s a reason teams don’t fire coaches mid season.</p>

<p>They beat some great teams under Doc like Twolves, Celtics, nuggets, thunder and mavs iirc and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of those were blowouts. I think some of it was getting the team to lock in against bad teams which they failed at all season. That grizzlies loss right before allstar was the worst regular season loss I’ve seen by the bucks in awhile.</p>

Doc has historically been very good at not being fired by teams early in his tenure and if the Bucks struggle, it’ll likely be because the older guys on the team can’t perform at their own levels, which isn’t something easily laid at the feet of the head coach.</p>

<p>If Giannis asks that he get fired, he will be obviously, but how likely is that?</p>

      <label for="loy3ij4" class="commentText"><p>Heres the truth. If doc get fired then that means dame and giannis are underperforming but they need a scape goat. Thats what nba coaches are there for. All that top 10 ranking stuff, you know whose fault it really is? It aint docs lol. Its the players. But ofc doc is so elite as his job he can scapegoat any situation but if everyones healthy. Dont see why they do bad. But it is funny if kawhi gets hurt its ofc so obvious. When giannis gets hurt its on doc? </p>
