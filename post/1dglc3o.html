<p>Bontemps and Windhorst talked about how Embiid got on air to do the Countdown show before G4 of the NBA Finals. They talked about it for 7 minutes so I summarized it to fit the title.</p>

<p>Obviously Balmer wants to win now and is willing to spend into the tax but he&rsquo;s also building the Clips brand for the long term, plastering Clipper bball courts all over So.Cal, hanging every California HS jersey in the concourse etc.</p>

<p>I still think PG gets his contract with the Clips but not because r/NBA thinks he needs a splash in the first season of a new stadium. </p>

      <label for="l8qu864" class="commentText"><p>Paul George also might just want to win a championship too, and Philly is going to be his best shot at it. While he&rsquo;s not as good as Butler would be, if they get George instead of needing to trade for Butler, they will still have all their picks to use in another trade to get another piece.</p>

<p>A guard, wing, big Big 3 with Maxey, George, and Embiid is really freaking good as is, even with no additional big trade. But having draft picks to be able to try to bring in more pieces, like Alex Caruso for example, could be huge.</p>

      <label for="l8s4w8q" class="commentText"><p>His advanced stats are better, yeah. Butler has always been an analytics darling. Even then, his advanced stats have declined a lot from previous years, so has his health, while Paul George&rsquo;s have remained very similar or improved recently.</p>

<p>To me it shows that Butler is regressing and possibly next season will regress pretty hard. Pat Riley doesnt want to give him an extension so imo he thinks the same.</p>

<p>Paul George takes 8 3s per game and Butler takes 2,  in static and wide open because teams know its the weakest part of his game. On the sixers he shot 33% from 3 and then had seasons after shooting  25%</p>

      <label for="l8siy18" class="commentText"><p>Butler is only one year removed from being 2nd in WS/48, behind only Jokic. The general consensus was that he was half assing the regular season last year to save himself for the playoffs, and then he got hurt in the first quarter of the play-in game, so there&rsquo;s no way to properly evaluate his regular season last year without also getting to see the playoff performance that he was saving himself for.</p>

<p>The last time each guy has appeared on the Top 20 leaderboards for these stats are Paul George: 12th in WS/48 (2019), 5th in total Win Shares (2019), 20th in PER (2019), 20th in BPM (2021), True Shooting % (Never).</p>

<p>Jimmy Butler is 7th in WS/48 (2024), 13th in total win shares (2024), 17th in PER (2024), 18th in BPM (2024), 18th in True Shooting % (2023).</p>

<p>Neither guy has really saw stat decline over the past 5 years outside of standard season to season variance, but Butler has just been consistently at a higher level since he got to Miami. His stats only dipped last year, which can easily be contributed to half assing it during the regular season to conserve energy for the playoffs or being bothered by the family situation he had last year. 2022-2023 was basically his best statistical regular season of his career followed by dominating the Bucks in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Paul George has appeared in 263 regular season games with the Clippers versus 291 regular season games for Butler with the Heat. Jimmy has been healthier than George since 2019, and was already missing 15+ games per season going back to years 3-5 in Chicago, just now he goes even safer with the rest games when coming back from injury.</p>

Unless they do a S&amp;T for PG13 they&rsquo;re only going to have like 3 other guys that aren&rsquo;t on minimum contract. A little bit of cap space left, plus the 8m room exception and 4.7m bi-annual exception. Everyone else would be on a min contract.</p>

Instead of blaming that one play he gave a sequence of 5 plays which included his own turnovers.  He even said SImmons passing out of the layup didn&rsquo;t matter if Thybulle makes both free throws.</p>

      <label for="l8s1yaz" class="commentText"><p>Embid has like one of the best ever plsyoff on/off. His team even when he’s hobbled as shit don’t seem to lose much when he’s on the court he’s a huge two way firce . Also embid hasn’t really thrown team mates under the bud that’s dumb : he’s said WE/I need to be better- he’s said comments that get taken out of context which are mostly on : I need to be better but not just me the team or moment he felt they lost ( Ben Simmons pass) is prob the closest and honestly that might’ve sucked the energy out of Philly who knows</p>

<p>He
Performed really well this playoffs on one leg ffs. His improved passing has made him unstoppable but unlike jokic he’s a bit better shooting longer shots n defending but now just good enough
Passer to punish the constant doubled n tripled - not jokic lvl but his growth in that area will
I feel very. Confident show - he’ll leeep having great stats in playoffs - before it was on/off but not the actual production now he’ll have both n likely more team success</p>

      <label for="l8rkbr4" class="commentText"><p>MacMahon chose to start covering other NBA teams on the side when the Mavs struck out on all their free agent dreams and didnt put together a contending team in the twilight years of Dirk&rsquo;s career</p>

<p>he said he did this for the sake of his own job security, because he saw how solely covering the Mavs was not a stable situation given the team&rsquo;s outlook</p>

<p>Cuban caught wind of this and banned him, leading to his name Banned MacMahon. but one could argue MacMahon&rsquo;s action was the butterfly effect that forced the team to recognize how dire their situation was, and the need to actually get talent on the team — leading to them trading up to draft Doncic, and the rest is history</p>

<hr>

<p>Lowe also said on the most recent pod he called Luka the whiniest player in the league some time ago — and Cuban said &ldquo;fuck you&rdquo; to him, leading to a stressful 72 hours.</p>

<p>perhaps that critique from Lowe laid the seeds for Doncic to reap the effects of Windhorst&rsquo;s remarks, and respond positively in Game 4</p>
