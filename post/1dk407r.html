</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Luka is a top 5 player in the world, but by all metrics the Mavericks making the finals was not expected, and they were punching above their weight. Heading into the 2023-2024 season, the Mavericks were a +2500 odds to make it to the finals. Not great odds.</p>

<p>Amongst top 5-10 teams in the NBA, the Mavericks have probably the weakest supporting cast, as it’s a huge drop off after Luka and Kyrie. Their third best player is Lively, who was a rookie.</p>

<p>On paper, they aren’t as balanced and stacked as the Wolves, Nuggets, Thunder, healthy Clippers. They deserved to get where they are, but I do think part of it involved getting wins at the right time.</p>

<p>They shouldn’t be clowned, as they surpassed expectations.</p>

<p>sure it&rsquo;s all hindsight but so was best backcourt duo to begin with - people aren&rsquo;t saying that if they lost to the nuggs in 5 either</p>

<p>There’s no league like the NBA when it comes to fans and media refusing to have any middle ground. Everything and everyone has to either be labeled the “greatest ever” or be complete frauds. I don’t see why we can’t acknowledge that Luka is a great player, while also acknowledging at the same time that his defense and conditioning are problems for the Mavs.</p>

Also, every team the Mavericks played these playoffs shot below their season and previous 2024 playoff average.
The Celtics were probably in their best shape since the heat series, game 3.</p>

      <label for="l9gap8d" class="commentText"><p>Seriously. We beat the West’s 1st, 3rd, and 4th seeds. Luka was amazing in those series even when incredibly hobbled early on. His defense was great. Now he had one series where he wasn’t as dominant and he gets written off? It’s insane. Tatum had a bad finals but gets a pass because they won.</p>

<p>At first I thought they were trolling, but they actually believe it. There are a lot of people who genuinely believe that it is better to lose in the first round (or not even make the playoffs!) than it is to make it to the finals and lose in the finals</p>

<p>Respectfully, this has always been one of the dumbest arguments I have ever heard in sports! How is it better to stop at step 1 than it is to stop at step 5??? It’s always come off as the dumbest form of copium that people try to use to support their flimsy arguments</p>

<p>To this day, there is a small (but very vocal) group of football fans who will argue that Joe Montana is better than Tom Brady because Joe is undefeated in Super Bowl appearances, ignoring that Brady appeared in far more Super Bowls and has won a higher number of Super Bowls</p>

      <label for="l9g7cby" class="commentText"><p>Knocking LeBron for losing in the Finals is one of the dumbest arguments I’ve ever heard. Context matters and the only real true blemish on his finals record, imo, is 2011. That Mavs team with Dirk was incredible. Very similar to BOS in that they were deep and stacked with really good veteran role players and had no weaknesses. However, that Heat team underperformed massively and LeBron was rightfully criticized. Other than that, the rest of LeBrons finals runs ended exactly as they should have.</p>

That ‘22 team was ~.500 in Feb of that year before going on a tear at the end of the season to end up as the 2 seed in the East. Then the entire team gets clowned, especially Tatum, for losing to Curry of all people, in the Finals.</p>

<p>If they had beaten Dallas and lost to Minnesota they’d have gotten clowned even worse despite achieving more. And if they dared make the Finals and lost they’d be a punchline for years until they won one. Way it goes.</p>

I don’t like Luka’s foul bait game, but you can tell from how he was playing in G4 and even G5 that it looks like he learned a lot from this finals.</p>

<p>He might try and level up this offseason (either conditioning or defense) to come back even better next year. They put the right team around him, they’re just missing experience, especially Lively and PJ.</p>

      <label for="l9g6xdz" class="commentText"><p>It’s worth noting the mavs knocked out three tough 50 win teams in the west including the 1 seed. Their team was assembled four months ago. That’s absolutely frightening when you consider they’ll be together for a few more years and they’ll have a full season together next year. The west is so stacked and to get finals experience is so valuable for a team trying to climb the mountain. Battle scars are part of the journey for pretty much every superstar in NBA history. Even Jordan had to face disappointment a couple times (pistons whooped his ass) before getting some rings.</p>

      <label for="l9hezux" class="commentText"><p>I mean especially considering that Luka’s main flaw (poor conditioning leading to lazy or incapable defense) was on huge display in this series.</p>

<p>Staying in front of your man is a pretty isolated task, you can’t actually blame it on the weapons the Celtics have or whatever else.  In reality, no one on the Celtics even has an elite first step, and Luka still turned in the highest blow-by percentage in a series in NBA history, and repeatedly failed to help to shooters on top of that.</p>

<p>Without him being such an easy attack point for the drive and kick, the series could have looked much different.</p>

<p>Luka is a huge figure in the league and his weaknesses (such as they are) got exposed on the biggest stage… the clowning makes total sense to me.  Every other superstar that lost their first Finals dealt with the same, Tatum included.</p>

<p>In addition, the NBA media (and a large chunk of the fanbase) have a terminal case of recency bias.</p>

<p>The Mavs had a great year.  The Wolves had a great year.  The Knicks had a great year.  Only the Celts got the chip - and they were truly worthy winners, and a great team - but there are plenty of squads who should be very proud of their performances this season.</p>

<p>4-2 is better than 4-0 in the finals, since the 4-0 player lost before the finals those two years.</p>

<p>Getting 2nd place is objectively better than losing earlier in the playoffs</p>

If anything I’ve seen way more people clowning Tatum and he won the title. Luka got gassed at the end of games from us constantly attacking him and his defense suffered because of it, but he was insane all series until Game 5, even with the injury. It felt like every shot he took would go in. Nothing but respect for the dude.</p>

He averaged close to 40 PPG in December. But you can’t stay conditioning when you’re hurt and he dealt with nagging lower leg injuries throughout the season that only got worse at the end of the season. By the time the playoffs rolled around, he wasn’t even supposed to be playing on his knee but he wasn’t going to sit out</p>

Luka, Kyrie and the Mavs will be back next year for the playoffs. Luka drug a much less potent team to the WCF 2 years ago, and with an offseason and full season to build up the role players and mesh as a team, I think next year will be really fun. Grats to the Celtics for meeting expectations and having a great season.</p>

<p>In reality, Kyrie didn&rsquo;t use enough incense to get rid of his Celtics deamons, and Luka is a traffic cone on defense.</p>

Everyone in the media was picking the Mavs to win, and most people were still delusional thinking they&rsquo;d come back after winning one game. Every game I watched, the commentators couldn&rsquo;t stop talking about Kyrie, as if he&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s gift to the nba. </p>

      <label for="l9fyiid" class="commentText"><p>They&rsquo;re not being clowned for getting to the finals, and not even losing in the finals. The clowning is based on how they lost and the sequence of events; which is essentially a narrative.</p>

<p>Pre-finals, they were dubbed the best offensive backcourt in history. During the series Kyrie kept talking shit about Boston as an organization and its fans. Luka talks to the refs every game, doesn&rsquo;t run back on defense, and seems gassed by the end of every 3rd quarter. These create narratives.</p>

<p>Then, Kyrie has one of the worst finals series by a star player. Can&rsquo;t generate enough offense, cooked on defense, and the Boston crowd gets to him bad. Kyrie clowning started in game 1! Right off the bat.</p>

<p>Luka gets frustrated with the officials, plays with minor injuries, looks tired the whole time and is absolutely targettted on defense. Gets fouled out with 4 mins to go in a must win game 3 at home. Luka survived until game 3 for his clowning to begin.</p>

<p>They lose 4-1 and that&rsquo;s it. It seals the narrative. They exceeded expectations by getting to the finals. During the finals they did some shit to get clowned on.</p>

      <label for="l9ffywf" class="commentText"><p>Nobody acknowledges Tatum for winning a chip, at the end of the day, most ppl online are there to hate so just ignore it. Be happy your team got there, hope it improves and don&rsquo;t give a shit. I see all the slander Tatum is getting here, who fucking cares, bro won a chip at 26. I think that&rsquo;s really how you should view things, especially on things you have no control over, you&rsquo;ll never be able to change the narrative. I&rsquo;ll say this tho, today nobody is giving the benefit of the doubt to Luka. Next year, if he wins MVP, they will all bring it up that luka was injured or else he might&rsquo;ve been able to beat the celtics. Narrative swing from one side to the other. Just look at brown today vs last year after the ECF and especially after signing the contract.</p>

<p>I feel like this is the best advice for a sports fan honestly. Just enjoy watching your team and the players you like, fuck what anybody else thinks.</p>

<p>Same as when he was getting pushed to be MVP ahead of Jokic all year, and ends up 3rd behind even Shai. Of course he&rsquo;s getting &lsquo;clowned&rsquo; for that (more towards his fans).</p>

<p>Doncic and Kyrie “the GrEaTeSt ShOoTiNg BaCkCoUrT oF aLl TiMe” were more Murray than Jokic in both victory and defeat.</p>

<p>Lively was great, as a Mavs fan I’d be super excited about him. Kyrie became the Kyrie we all expected, and Kidd told Doncic what he needs to do to win a title, but doesn’t seem to want to. Next season will be an interesting one for them, a focused Kyrie, defensive focused Doncic, and an ascending Lively will be a serious contender. Or, Kyrie wears out his welcome, Doncic still shows up when he wants, and the season plays out the same way.</p>

      <label for="l9gjeea" class="commentText"><p>I think people are just salty that the finals weren&rsquo;t really competitive (which in fairness, it was a pretty terrible series).</p>

<p>Of course, multiple things can be true:</p>

<p>The Celtics were an absolutely dominant team this year, and dismantled the Mavs even without a healthy Pingus</p>

<p>Kidd&rsquo;s coaching and rotations and time-out judgment were not good at all</p>

<p>Kyrie didn&rsquo;t show up to any of the Boston games</p>

<p>Luka&rsquo;s defense left a lot to be desired outside of game 4.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s ok to say the Mavericks and Luka did have a poor Finals showing, but within the context of an amazing season where they outperformed expectations.</p>

      <label for="l9g9b9f" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve thought since the beginning of the Finals that this Mavs teams gave off such 2022 Celtics vibes.  The team that&rsquo;s overachieving and probably gets a round or so farther into the playoffs than they were thinking they could get under their most optimistic projections, but then just isn&rsquo;t quite ready to win a championship.  A few of their young guys need to develop more, they&rsquo;re probably a transaction or two away from having a real championship threatening roster, and their stars still have a couple of exploitable holes in their game that need to be patched up.</p>

<p>The 2022 Celtics were able to use their loss to the Warriors to fuel the changes they needed to make to get where they are now.  I hope the Mavs can do the same.</p>

They absolutely crushed the Timberwolves in 5 games. That series wasn&rsquo;t in doubt for one minute, and Luka looked absolutely unstoppable.</p>

<p>But the Celtics were the best team all season by a wide margin and played as such in the finals. They just ran into a buzz saw. And Luka in particular has nothing to be ashamed of. He dropped about 29 points a game in the finals. He had a 32 point triple double in game 2.</p>

The whole year this team was getting glazed, walked their way to the finals and easily you could see the matchups and where the advantage was going.  Maybe it was just desire from everyone for Luka and Kyrie to win and beat the Celts, that everyone willed it into a “expectation”.</p>
