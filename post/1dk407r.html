</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Luka is a top 5 player in the world, but by all metrics the Mavericks making the finals was not expected, and they were punching above their weight. Heading into the 2023-2024 season, the Mavericks were a +2500 odds to make it to the finals. Not great odds.</p>

<p>Amongst top 5-10 teams in the NBA, the Mavericks have probably the weakest supporting cast, as it’s a huge drop off after Luka and Kyrie. Their third best player is Lively, who was a rookie.</p>

<p>On paper, they aren’t as balanced and stacked as the Wolves, Nuggets, Thunder, healthy Clippers. They deserved to get where they are, but I do think part of it involved getting wins at the right time.</p>

<p>They shouldn’t be clowned, as they surpassed expectations.</p>

<p>There’s no league like the NBA when it comes to fans and media refusing to have any middle ground. Everything and everyone has to either be labeled the “greatest ever” or be complete frauds. I don’t see why we can’t acknowledge that Luka is a great player, while also acknowledging at the same time that his defense and conditioning are problems for the Mavs.</p>

      <label for="l9h7lf8" class="commentText"><p>The best backcourt duo thing was always ridiculous. But nothing that happened in the Finals should drastically sway anyone who is sober.</p>

<p>Even Lowe got drunk on the Kyrie/Luka combo train. He was talking about them going on a 3 or 4 year run together. Kyrie is already 31 and has had consistent knee problems throughout his career. Let&rsquo;s maybe get through the Finals once before we start talking about them as an all-time duo.</p>

<p>Boston was way way way better than Dallas. Kyrie didn&rsquo;t have a good series. Luka was fine (by his standards). Boston has amazing defenders to throw at both of them and Dallas is still short at least one &ldquo;release valve&rdquo; player.</p>

Sure the issue isn&rsquo;t exclusive to them (not sure why this needs to be pointed out), but most Millenials/X/Boomers don&rsquo;t have the same amount of screen time and they grew up without nearly as many instant feedback loops.</p>

<p>I watched a Boston game with my father and some of his friends some months ago and when Tatum or Brown missed they said things like “how are they paying him so much, he is not good, put Prichard in” and when they made something good they said “Let’s go, why don’t more people talk about Tatum, he is better than Doncic”.</p>

Now he had one series where he wasn’t as dominant and he gets written off? It’s insane. Tatum had a bad finals but gets a pass because they won.</p>

      <label for="l9fk2bu" class="commentText"><p>It’s funny you say that, because there’s a disgustingly large number of people who genuinely disagree with this logic, and it boggles my mind</p>

<p>At first I thought they were trolling, but they actually believe it. There are a lot of people who genuinely believe that it is better to lose in the first round (or not even make the playoffs!) than it is to make it to the finals and lose in the finals</p>

<p>Respectfully, this has always been one of the dumbest arguments I have ever heard in sports! How is it better to stop at step 1 than it is to stop at step 5??? It’s always come off as the dumbest form of copium that people try to use to support their flimsy arguments</p>

<p>To this day, there is a small (but very vocal) group of football fans who will argue that Joe Montana is better than Tom Brady because Joe is undefeated in Super Bowl appearances, ignoring that Brady appeared in far more Super Bowls and has won a higher number of Super Bowls</p>

      <label for="l9h3yq1" class="commentText"><p>It’s still a stupid argument though. Not disagreeing that MJs record is better than lebron, but IMO the 6 “2nd” places for Lebron shouldn’t be treated worse than if he didn’t make the finals those 6 years and was 4-0 in the finals</p>

<p>Lebron has played 21 years. 4 finals wins, 6 finals losses, and 11 times not getting top-2 is objectively better than if he had 4 finals wins, 0 finals losses, and 17 times not getting top-2</p>

      <label for="l9h5zbu" class="commentText"><p>Me personally, I’m out of those discussions: I can’t really separate the 2 at this point as MJ’s peak was crazy high, but also relatively short compared to LBJ’s longevity.</p>

<p>My point was more about the fact that both sides have argument why their guy is better, unlike the football example where one player has both the most SuperBowl wins and appearances. If MJ had 3 out of 3 wins vs LBJ 4 out of 10, we most likely wouldn’t be having this discussion at all lol.</p>

<p>Like if MJ had gone 6-3 in the finals instead of 6-0, that’s actually more impressive. Since in reality those 3 years he lost before the finals</p>

      <label for="l9g7cby" class="commentText"><p>Knocking LeBron for losing in the Finals is one of the dumbest arguments I’ve ever heard. Context matters and the only real true blemish on his finals record, imo, is 2011. That Mavs team with Dirk was incredible. Very similar to BOS in that they were deep and stacked with really good veteran role players and had no weaknesses. However, that Heat team underperformed massively and LeBron was rightfully criticized. Other than that, the rest of LeBrons finals runs ended exactly as they should have.</p>

That ‘22 team was ~.500 in Feb of that year before going on a tear at the end of the season to end up as the 2 seed in the East. Then the entire team gets clowned, especially Tatum, for losing to Curry of all people, in the Finals.</p>

<p>If they had beaten Dallas and lost to Minnesota they’d have gotten clowned even worse despite achieving more. And if they dared make the Finals and lost they’d be a punchline for years until they won one. Way it goes.</p>

<p>He might try and level up this offseason (either conditioning or defense) to come back even better next year. They put the right team around him, they’re just missing experience, especially Lively and PJ.</p>

      <label for="l9g6xdz" class="commentText"><p>It’s worth noting the mavs knocked out three tough 50 win teams in the west including the 1 seed. Their team was assembled four months ago. That’s absolutely frightening when you consider they’ll be together for a few more years and they’ll have a full season together next year. The west is so stacked and to get finals experience is so valuable for a team trying to climb the mountain. Battle scars are part of the journey for pretty much every superstar in NBA history. Even Jordan had to face disappointment a couple times (pistons whooped his ass) before getting some rings.</p>

      <label for="l9hofho" class="commentText"><p>To be fair&hellip; in 2020 they did this exact same thing to the Lakers&hellip; WITH EVERY TEAM! LA has to watch out, the Trailblazers are the greatest 8th seed in NBA history. The Rockets have Russell Westbrook back and could contend with the Warriors for back-to-back years. Denver just came back down 3-1 in back-to-back rounds. The Heat and Jimmy Butler will give them hell.</p>

<p>I think that Dallas exceeded expectations for the sole reason that no one believed in them all season. A play-in team. Second round knock out? Missed the postseason last year.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Boston has been getting clowned for no reason. Especially Jayson Tatum.</p>

      <label for="l9hezux" class="commentText"><p>I mean especially considering that Luka’s main flaw (poor conditioning leading to lazy or incapable defense) was on huge display in this series.</p>

<p>Staying in front of your man is a pretty isolated task, you can’t actually blame it on the weapons the Celtics have or whatever else.  In reality, no one on the Celtics even has an elite first step, and Luka still turned in the highest blow-by percentage in a series in NBA history, and repeatedly failed to help to shooters on top of that.</p>

<p>Without him being such an easy attack point for the drive and kick, the series could have looked much different.</p>

<p>Luka is a huge figure in the league and his weaknesses (such as they are) got exposed on the biggest stage… the clowning makes total sense to me.  Every other superstar that lost their first Finals dealt with the same, Tatum included.</p>

      <label for="l9fvzjx" class="commentText"><p>The sports world very sadly - IMO - falls into a &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re not first, you&rsquo;re last&rdquo; mentality.  Winning isn&rsquo;t considered the main thing; it&rsquo;s considered the only thing.</p>

<p>In addition, the NBA media (and a large chunk of the fanbase) have a terminal case of recency bias.</p>

<p>The Mavs had a great year.  The Wolves had a great year.  The Knicks had a great year.  Only the Celts got the chip - and they were truly worthy winners, and a great team - but there are plenty of squads who should be very proud of their performances this season.</p>

<p>4-2 is better than 4-0 in the finals, since the 4-0 player lost before the finals those two years.</p>

<p>Getting 2nd place is objectively better than losing earlier in the playoffs</p>

<p>In reality, Kyrie didn&rsquo;t use enough incense to get rid of his Celtics deamons, and Luka is a traffic cone on defense.</p>

Everyone in the media was picking the Mavs to win, and most people were still delusional thinking they&rsquo;d come back after winning one game. Every game I watched, the commentators couldn&rsquo;t stop talking about Kyrie, as if he&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s gift to the nba. </p>

      <label for="l9fyiid" class="commentText"><p>They&rsquo;re not being clowned for getting to the finals, and not even losing in the finals. The clowning is based on how they lost and the sequence of events; which is essentially a narrative.</p>

<p>Pre-finals, they were dubbed the best offensive backcourt in history. During the series Kyrie kept talking shit about Boston as an organization and its fans. Luka talks to the refs every game, doesn&rsquo;t run back on defense, and seems gassed by the end of every 3rd quarter. These create narratives.</p>

<p>Then, Kyrie has one of the worst finals series by a star player. Can&rsquo;t generate enough offense, cooked on defense, and the Boston crowd gets to him bad. Kyrie clowning started in game 1! Right off the bat.</p>

<p>Luka gets frustrated with the officials, plays with minor injuries, looks tired the whole time and is absolutely targettted on defense. Gets fouled out with 4 mins to go in a must win game 3 at home. Luka survived until game 3 for his clowning to begin.</p>

<p>They lose 4-1 and that&rsquo;s it. It seals the narrative. They exceeded expectations by getting to the finals. During the finals they did some shit to get clowned on.</p>

<p>Doncic and Kyrie “the GrEaTeSt ShOoTiNg BaCkCoUrT oF aLl TiMe” were more Murray than Jokic in both victory and defeat.</p>

<p>Lively was great, as a Mavs fan I’d be super excited about him. Kyrie became the Kyrie we all expected, and Kidd told Doncic what he needs to do to win a title, but doesn’t seem to want to. Next season will be an interesting one for them, a focused Kyrie, defensive focused Doncic, and an ascending Lively will be a serious contender. Or, Kyrie wears out his welcome, Doncic still shows up when he wants, and the season plays out the same way.</p>

<p>Of course, multiple things can be true:</p>

<p>The Celtics were an absolutely dominant team this year, and dismantled the Mavs even without a healthy Pingus</p>

<p>Kidd&rsquo;s coaching and rotations and time-out judgment were not good at all</p>

<p>Kyrie didn&rsquo;t show up to any of the Boston games</p>

<p>Luka&rsquo;s defense left a lot to be desired outside of game 4.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s ok to say the Mavericks and Luka did have a poor Finals showing, but within the context of an amazing season where they outperformed expectations.</p>

      <label for="l9g9b9f" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve thought since the beginning of the Finals that this Mavs teams gave off such 2022 Celtics vibes.  The team that&rsquo;s overachieving and probably gets a round or so farther into the playoffs than they were thinking they could get under their most optimistic projections, but then just isn&rsquo;t quite ready to win a championship.  A few of their young guys need to develop more, they&rsquo;re probably a transaction or two away from having a real championship threatening roster, and their stars still have a couple of exploitable holes in their game that need to be patched up.</p>

<p>The 2022 Celtics were able to use their loss to the Warriors to fuel the changes they needed to make to get where they are now.  I hope the Mavs can do the same.</p>

The whole year this team was getting glazed, walked their way to the finals and easily you could see the matchups and where the advantage was going.  Maybe it was just desire from everyone for Luka and Kyrie to win and beat the Celts, that everyone willed it into a “expectation”.</p>

      <label for="l9hef9e" class="commentText"><p>Yeah obviously. The thing is NBA fans don’t care. The negativity is part of the appeal for most of the people in this sub. Context and stats don’t mean much when you are just here to hate.</p>

      <label for="l9hrjpa" class="commentText"><p>Whoever the GM for the Mavs is should be getting a crazy bonus. The fact he was able to flip a team that looked play-in bound to a WC champ on a Grant Williams trade is crazy impressive.</p>

      <label for="l9hvu1v" class="commentText"><p>They made the Finals. They went on an insane post trade deadline run to overcome the expectation of a play-in spot. They beat three teams in the playoffs everyone expected them to beat.</p>

<p>The Celtics aren&rsquo;t a fluke team. They aren&rsquo;t a team that got hot in the playoffs. They ran the regular season and they&rsquo;ve been knocking at the door for a few years now. Jrue put them over.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t even be mad. Dallas still won the West when people were all about the Nuggets, Wolves and Thunder. Luka shined, the role players shined and Kyrie did his thing. They just went up against a team that wasn&rsquo;t losing to anyone in the Finals.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m ecstatic for a full year of this roster. An offseason worth of development for Lively is going to be big. Re-signing DJJ needs to happen. I think with this post trade deadline roster and some tweaks (THJ, Maxi, etc. etc.) they&rsquo;ll be right there again.</p>

<p>It sucks losing the Finals but it still means they won the West. Which is more than every other team in the West can say.</p>
