</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Luka is a top 5 player in the world, but by all metrics the Mavericks making the finals was not expected, and they were punching above their weight. Heading into the 2023-2024 season, the Mavericks were a +2500 odds to make it to the finals. Not great odds.</p>

<p>Amongst top 5-10 teams in the NBA, the Mavericks have probably the weakest supporting cast, as it’s a huge drop off after Luka and Kyrie. Their third best player is Lively, who was a rookie.</p>

<p>On paper, they aren’t as balanced and stacked as the Wolves, Nuggets, Thunder, healthy Clippers. They deserved to get where they are, but I do think part of it involved getting wins at the right time.</p>

<p>They shouldn’t be clowned, as they surpassed expectations.</p>

<p>sure it&rsquo;s all hindsight but so was best backcourt duo to begin with - people aren&rsquo;t saying that if they lost to the nuggs in 5 either</p>

Now he had one series where he wasn’t as dominant and he gets written off? It’s insane. Tatum had a bad finals but gets a pass because they won.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;ll spend the first half sucking up to the refs while flopping and charging on every drive until all the calls just mysteriously start going the Mavs way. Then they win by a couple of buckets or exclusively on a terrible call while hes stomping around screaming about what a  great player he is. That&rsquo;s fucking irritating.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s really good at basketball and he&rsquo;s really good at ref-ball. He&rsquo;s not getting the criticism and hate because of his basketball skills.</p>

      <label for="l9fk2bu" class="commentText"><p>It’s funny you say that, because there’s a disgustingly large number of people who genuinely disagree with this logic, and it boggles my mind</p>

<p>At first I thought they were trolling, but they actually believe it. There are a lot of people who genuinely believe that it is better to lose in the first round (or not even make the playoffs!) than it is to make it to the finals and lose in the finals</p>

<p>Respectfully, this has always been one of the dumbest arguments I have ever heard in sports! How is it better to stop at step 1 than it is to stop at step 5??? It’s always come off as the dumbest form of copium that people try to use to support their flimsy arguments</p>

<p>To this day, there is a small (but very vocal) group of football fans who will argue that Joe Montana is better than Tom Brady because Joe is undefeated in Super Bowl appearances, ignoring that Brady appeared in far more Super Bowls and has won a higher number of Super Bowls</p>

      <label for="l9g7cby" class="commentText"><p>Knocking LeBron for losing in the Finals is one of the dumbest arguments I’ve ever heard. Context matters and the only real true blemish on his finals record, imo, is 2011. That Mavs team with Dirk was incredible. Very similar to BOS in that they were deep and stacked with really good veteran role players and had no weaknesses. However, that Heat team underperformed massively and LeBron was rightfully criticized. Other than that, the rest of LeBrons finals runs ended exactly as they should have.</p>

That ‘22 team was ~.500 in Feb of that year before going on a tear at the end of the season to end up as the 2 seed in the East. Then the entire team gets clowned, especially Tatum, for losing to Curry of all people, in the Finals.</p>

I don’t like Luka’s foul bait game, but you can tell from how he was playing in G4 and even G5 that it looks like he learned a lot from this finals.</p>

<p>He might try and level up this offseason (either conditioning or defense) to come back even better next year. They put the right team around him, they’re just missing experience, especially Lively and PJ.</p>

      <label for="l9g6lfn" class="commentText"><p>Yeah i do agree the Celtics should get more praise than Dallas criticism.</p>

<p>But at the end of the day Kyrie was really bad, alot of the role players that everyone thought could be part of the core no longer seem good enough if they want to win in the Finals and Luka was really good but wasnt insane or close to the level we expect from a top 3 player in the league.</p>

      <label for="l9g6xdz" class="commentText"><p>It’s worth noting the mavs knocked out three tough 50 win teams in the west including the 1 seed. Their team was assembled four months ago. That’s absolutely frightening when you consider they’ll be together for a few more years and they’ll have a full season together next year. The west is so stacked and to get finals experience is so valuable for a team trying to climb the mountain. Battle scars are part of the journey for pretty much every superstar in NBA history. Even Jordan had to face disappointment a couple times (pistons whooped his ass) before getting some rings.</p>

<p>In 2022 the Celtics were slight underdogs at +125 and every “analyst” picked them over the warriors.</p>

<p>It makes sense in the same ways the majority of /r/NBA convinced themselves the Mavericks were gonna win - it doesn&rsquo;t matter what they &ldquo;really thought&rdquo; it was just straight up disrespectful and stupid and that&rsquo;s what should be getting clowned on more than Luka but less than Kyrie.</p>

The issue is that analytics just can&rsquo;t predict Tatum and Brown being consistent chokers. Kudos to them though, they stepped up their game this year and finally won the ring as the data expected them to. But just because they underperformed expectations in the past doesn&rsquo;t mean the expectations were wrong</p>

<p>In addition, the NBA media (and a large chunk of the fanbase) have a terminal case of recency bias.</p>

<p>The Mavs had a great year.  The Wolves had a great year.  The Knicks had a great year.  Only the Celts got the chip - and they were truly worthy winners, and a great team - but there are plenty of squads who should be very proud of their performances this season.</p>

They overcame expectations in the first few rounds of the playoffs, but they clearly played much worse than they were capable of in the Finals. Kyrie was bricking shots, Luka was getting blown by. If you can get praise, you can also get criticism.</p>

<p>Without the loss in 2024, their finals record is 12-3.
2000 - 2002 was more representative of how dominant they were.</p>

<p>And across the playoffs they were 45-13 from <sup>99</sup>&frasl;<sub>00</sub> to 01/02, with 8 of those losses coming in their first championship season. In two posit seasons they were 30-5. That&rsquo;s crazy dominant.</p>

<p>2000 - Finals
2001 - Finals
2002 - Finals
2003 - Lost in second Round
2004 - Finals</p>

<p>2004 Lakers were a completely different team. They added an aging Gary Payton and old Karl Malone. Also, Kobe and Shaq&rsquo;s beef really escalated that year that resulted in Shaq leaving that post season. Not to mention Kobe&rsquo;s trial started that year.</p>

<p>It was just a different team. That&rsquo;s why adding thst last finals really obscures how dominant they were between 2000 and 2002.</p>

      <label for="l9g586k" class="commentText"><p>Past judgements? People on here were giddy af that Tatum didn&rsquo;t win FMVP so they can keep talking their shit.</p>

<p>People on here are stupid, reactionary, and hyper critical of shit they don&rsquo;t even begin to know how to evaluate, but every player gets their turn. If anything, Luka tends to get less criticism for how <em>classy</em> he is.</p>

<p>Are the numbers gonna tell you he was often playing center or guarding 1-5? Defensive deflections? Are the numbers gonna tell you how he kept wrecking the Mavs’ defense and kept making it easy for his teammates?</p>

<p>Mindbogglingly dumb if you think he’s playing the same as he was two years ago.</p>

      <label for="l9ffywf" class="commentText"><p>Nobody acknowledges Tatum for winning a chip, at the end of the day, most ppl online are there to hate so just ignore it. Be happy your team got there, hope it improves and don&rsquo;t give a shit. I see all the slander Tatum is getting here, who fucking cares, bro won a chip at 26. I think that&rsquo;s really how you should view things, especially on things you have no control over, you&rsquo;ll never be able to change the narrative. I&rsquo;ll say this tho, today nobody is giving the benefit of the doubt to Luka. Next year, if he wins MVP, they will all bring it up that luka was injured or else he might&rsquo;ve been able to beat the celtics. Narrative swing from one side to the other. Just look at brown today vs last year after the ECF and especially after signing the contract.</p>

<p>I feel like this is the best advice for a sports fan honestly. Just enjoy watching your team and the players you like, fuck what anybody else thinks.</p>

      <label for="l9fyiid" class="commentText"><p>They&rsquo;re not being clowned for getting to the finals, and not even losing in the finals. The clowning is based on how they lost and the sequence of events; which is essentially a narrative.</p>

<p>Pre-finals, they were dubbed the best offensive backcourt in history. During the series Kyrie kept talking shit about Boston as an organization and its fans. Luka talks to the refs every game, doesn&rsquo;t run back on defense, and seems gassed by the end of every 3rd quarter. These create narratives.</p>

<p>Then, Kyrie has one of the worst finals series by a star player. Can&rsquo;t generate enough offense, cooked on defense, and the Boston crowd gets to him bad. Kyrie clowning started in game 1! Right off the bat.</p>

<p>Luka gets frustrated with the officials, plays with minor injuries, looks tired the whole time and is absolutely targettted on defense. Gets fouled out with 4 mins to go in a must win game 3 at home. Luka survived until game 3 for his clowning to begin.</p>

<p>They lose 4-1 and that&rsquo;s it. It seals the narrative. They exceeded expectations by getting to the finals. During the finals they did some shit to get clowned on.</p>

      <label for="l9g6jp2" class="commentText"><p>Real NBA fans aren’t clowning Luka. It’s pretty clear he’s   at least top 3 player in the NBA. Hes younger than Tatum and SGA and I think it’s easy to lose sight of that. Mavs shouldn’t have won the series but they’re not as far apart as people might think. Kyrie  didn’t do anything in this series and Luka is clearly hobbled. Tatum and Brown are two of the top 15 players in the NBA and they couldn’t win until they were surrounded with 4 star level players. It takes time. Mavs had an incredible season and got to the finals ahead of schedule. When you have a Luka, Giannis, or Jokic, your team always has a shot and that’s a good place to be if you’re Dallas fan. Best team won this year and the Celtics are probably gonna be the best team again next year.</p>

Was it also glaringly obvious that Luka was far too out of shape and does he deserve to be clowned for that? Yes 100%. You can’t be that gassed simply by a team face guarding you and trying to score on you if you’re an elite player.</p>

<p>They were the second best team and lost to the best team, it’s not that difficult to comprehend. Boston simply have the more talented team, top to bottom.</p>

      <label for="l9g9b9f" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve thought since the beginning of the Finals that this Mavs teams gave off such 2022 Celtics vibes.  The team that&rsquo;s overachieving and probably gets a round or so farther into the playoffs than they were thinking they could get under their most optimistic projections, but then just isn&rsquo;t quite ready to win a championship.  A few of their young guys need to develop more, they&rsquo;re probably a transaction or two away from having a real championship threatening roster, and their stars still have a couple of exploitable holes in their game that need to be patched up.</p>

<p>The 2022 Celtics were able to use their loss to the Warriors to fuel the changes they needed to make to get where they are now.  I hope the Mavs can do the same.</p>

      <label for="l9gbp9l" class="commentText"><p>Luka is a great offensive player and showed that the entire playoffs. When it came to the big game though, it showed his true lack of leadership skills, as well as defensive skills. He could be the best player easy if he takes being in shape more serious, and gets involved on both ends of the floor.</p>

<p>Secondly, this is just my opinion, but he is going to make his team worse in the long run the way he plays offense. He doesn’t get others involved on offense, rarely passes, and just resorts to passing as a final resort when forced. His team isn’t going to get better if he doesn’t allow the other players to shoot more during the game.</p>

They absolutely crushed the Timberwolves in 5 games. That series wasn&rsquo;t in doubt for one minute, and Luka looked absolutely unstoppable.</p>

<p>But the Celtics were the best team all season by a wide margin and played as such in the finals. They just ran into a buzz saw. And Luka in particular has nothing to be ashamed of. He dropped about 29 points a game in the finals. He had a 32 point triple double in game 2.</p>

      <label for="l9ft19l" class="commentText"><p>To be fair, Kyrie had a horrible finals series because of the Boston pressure. Luka is good but when a team is so one dimensional because the second star can’t produce they are easy beats. I say that with no disrespect to Dallas’ role players either because they are good, but Boston are an extremely deep team. Another season under the belt of this mavs team and we may see a repeat of my lakers in 09, came off a finals loss and rallied BIG time to come back for vengeance.</p>
