      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dk407r/luka_and_the_mavericks_shouldnt_be_clowned/"><p>Luka and the Mavericks Shouldn’t be Clowned because they far exceeded their expectations</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Luka is a top 5 player in the world, but by all metrics the Mavericks making the finals was not expected, and they were punching above their weight. Heading into the 2023-2024 season, the Mavericks were a +2500 odds to make it to the finals. Not great odds.</p>

<p>Amongst top 5-10 teams in the NBA, the Mavericks have probably the weakest supporting cast, as it’s a huge drop off after Luka and Kyrie. Their third best player is Lively, who was a rookie.</p>

<p>On paper, they aren’t as balanced and stacked as the Wolves, Nuggets, Thunder, healthy Clippers. They deserved to get where they are, but I do think part of it involved getting wins at the right time.</p>

<p>They shouldn’t be clowned, as they surpassed expectations.</p>

<p>sure it&rsquo;s all hindsight but so was best backcourt duo to begin with - people aren&rsquo;t saying that if they lost to the nuggs in 5 either</p>

<p>There’s no league like the NBA when it comes to fans and media refusing to have any middle ground. Everything and everyone has to either be labeled the “greatest ever” or be complete frauds. I don’t see why we can’t acknowledge that Luka is a great player, while also acknowledging at the same time that his defense and conditioning are problems for the Mavs.</p>

      <label for="l9gap8d" class="commentText"><p>Seriously. We beat the West’s 1st, 3rd, and 4th seeds. Luka was amazing in those series even when incredibly hobbled early on. His defense was great. Now he had one series where he wasn’t as dominant and he gets written off? It’s insane. Tatum had a bad finals but gets a pass because they won.</p>

<p>At first I thought they were trolling, but they actually believe it. There are a lot of people who genuinely believe that it is better to lose in the first round (or not even make the playoffs!) than it is to make it to the finals and lose in the finals</p>

<p>Respectfully, this has always been one of the dumbest arguments I have ever heard in sports! How is it better to stop at step 1 than it is to stop at step 5??? It’s always come off as the dumbest form of copium that people try to use to support their flimsy arguments</p>

<p>To this day, there is a small (but very vocal) group of football fans who will argue that Joe Montana is better than Tom Brady because Joe is undefeated in Super Bowl appearances, ignoring that Brady appeared in far more Super Bowls and has won a higher number of Super Bowls</p>

      <label for="l9g7cby" class="commentText"><p>Knocking LeBron for losing in the Finals is one of the dumbest arguments I’ve ever heard. Context matters and the only real true blemish on his finals record, imo, is 2011. That Mavs team with Dirk was incredible. Very similar to BOS in that they were deep and stacked with really good veteran role players and had no weaknesses. However, that Heat team underperformed massively and LeBron was rightfully criticized. Other than that, the rest of LeBrons finals runs ended exactly as they should have.</p>

<p>Maybe someone should do it for the NBA</p>

      <label for="l9fyw4i" class="commentText"><p>lol it’s like people don’t remember the discourse around the ‘22 Celtics after their finals or Mavs/Luka fans thought no one would do this to them too. That ‘22 team was ~.500 in Feb of that year before going on a tear at the end of the season to end up as the 2 seed in the East. Then the entire team gets clowned, especially Tatum, for losing to Curry of all people, in the Finals.</p>

      <label for="l9gfmvw" class="commentText"><p>Another good example is OKC who took off this year, got the 1 seed and then got clowned a bit for losing a tough 2nd round series despite that being beyond their expected ceiling going into the year.</p>

<p>If they had beaten Dallas and lost to Minnesota they’d have gotten clowned even worse despite achieving more. And if they dared make the Finals and lost they’d be a punchline for years until they won one. Way it goes.</p>

      <label for="l9g5kbt" class="commentText"><p>Yep. Like us Cs fans were saying, our best player at the time was &amp;lt;25, we were way ahead of schedule. I don’t like Luka’s foul bait game, but you can tell from how he was playing in G4 and even G5 that it looks like he learned a lot from this finals.</p>

<p>He might try and level up this offseason (either conditioning or defense) to come back even better next year. They put the right team around him, they’re just missing experience, especially Lively and PJ.</p>

<p>Mavs have made several playoff runs too, including an ECF appearance in that same 22’ playoffs, losing to the GSW.</p>

<p>Yea the discourse on here (and apparently twitter—I don’t use it) is terrible when it comes to these young teams making it far. We’re even seeing it with Ant and the Wolves. It kinda sucks.</p>

<p>I’m 100% with you though this was really the first time reading through this place through a deep playoff run and the discourse is incredibly toxic around every star player. People were even slandering Jokic which I thought was impossible.</p>

<p>I can understand why someone would clown on a star severely under performing but other than that it&rsquo;s silly.</p>

<p>This wasn&rsquo;t an unforced error by the Mavs, the Celts did everything right and have the entire season&rsquo;s stats to prove it.</p>

<p>But at the end of the day Kyrie was really bad, alot of the role players that everyone thought could be part of the core no longer seem good enough if they want to win in the Finals and Luka was really good but wasnt insane or close to the level we expect from a top 3 player in the league.</p>

      <label for="l9g6xdz" class="commentText"><p>It’s worth noting the mavs knocked out three tough 50 win teams in the west including the 1 seed. Their team was assembled four months ago. That’s absolutely frightening when you consider they’ll be together for a few more years and they’ll have a full season together next year. The west is so stacked and to get finals experience is so valuable for a team trying to climb the mountain. Battle scars are part of the journey for pretty much every superstar in NBA history. Even Jordan had to face disappointment a couple times (pistons whooped his ass) before getting some rings.</p>

      <label for="l9g5x0y" class="commentText"><p>This was my first time engaging with NBA social media during the playoffs, and man, ya’ll have wildass takes lol. Luka, Kyrie and the Mavs will be back next year for the playoffs. Luka drug a much less potent team to the WCF 2 years ago, and with an offseason and full season to build up the role players and mesh as a team, I think next year will be really fun. Grats to the Celtics for meeting expectations and having a great season.</p>

<p>Pre-finals, they were dubbed the best offensive backcourt in history. During the series Kyrie kept talking shit about Boston as an organization and its fans. Luka talks to the refs every game, doesn&rsquo;t run back on defense, and seems gassed by the end of every 3rd quarter. These create narratives.</p>

<p>Then, Kyrie has one of the worst finals series by a star player. Can&rsquo;t generate enough offense, cooked on defense, and the Boston crowd gets to him bad. Kyrie clowning started in game 1! Right off the bat.</p>

<p>Luka gets frustrated with the officials, plays with minor injuries, looks tired the whole time and is absolutely targettted on defense. Gets fouled out with 4 mins to go in a must win game 3 at home. Luka survived until game 3 for his clowning to begin.</p>

<p>They lose 4-1 and that&rsquo;s it. It seals the narrative. They exceeded expectations by getting to the finals. During the finals they did some shit to get clowned on.</p>

<p>He had to get painkiller injections before every game.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not really surprising that he wasn&rsquo;t moving that well.</p>

<p>Doncic and Kyrie “the GrEaTeSt ShOoTiNg BaCkCoUrT oF aLl TiMe” were more Murray than Jokic in both victory and defeat.</p>

<p>Lively was great, as a Mavs fan I’d be super excited about him. Kyrie became the Kyrie we all expected, and Kidd told Doncic what he needs to do to win a title, but doesn’t seem to want to. Next season will be an interesting one for them, a focused Kyrie, defensive focused Doncic, and an ascending Lively will be a serious contender. Or, Kyrie wears out his welcome, Doncic still shows up when he wants, and the season plays out the same way.</p>

<p>Of course, multiple things can be true:</p>

<p>The Celtics were an absolutely dominant team this year, and dismantled the Mavs even without a healthy Pingus</p>

<p>Kidd&rsquo;s coaching and rotations and time-out judgment were not good at all</p>

<p>Kyrie didn&rsquo;t show up to any of the Boston games</p>

<p>Luka&rsquo;s defense left a lot to be desired outside of game 4.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s ok to say the Mavericks and Luka did have a poor Finals showing, but within the context of an amazing season where they outperformed expectations.</p>

The whole year this team was getting glazed, walked their way to the finals and easily you could see the matchups and where the advantage was going.  Maybe it was just desire from everyone for Luka and Kyrie to win and beat the Celts, that everyone willed it into a “expectation”.</p>

      <label for="l9g9b9f" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve thought since the beginning of the Finals that this Mavs teams gave off such 2022 Celtics vibes.  The team that&rsquo;s overachieving and probably gets a round or so farther into the playoffs than they were thinking they could get under their most optimistic projections, but then just isn&rsquo;t quite ready to win a championship.  A few of their young guys need to develop more, they&rsquo;re probably a transaction or two away from having a real championship threatening roster, and their stars still have a couple of exploitable holes in their game that need to be patched up.</p>

<p>The 2022 Celtics were able to use their loss to the Warriors to fuel the changes they needed to make to get where they are now.  I hope the Mavs can do the same.</p>

      <label for="l9gcs3z" class="commentText"><p>The Mavericks had an impressive run. They had to go through the #1 seed Thunder and did so in only 6 games. They absolutely crushed the Timberwolves in 5 games. That series wasn&rsquo;t in doubt for one minute, and Luka looked absolutely unstoppable.</p>

<p>But the Celtics were the best team all season by a wide margin and played as such in the finals. They just ran into a buzz saw. And Luka in particular has nothing to be ashamed of. He dropped about 29 points a game in the finals. He had a 32 point triple double in game 2.</p>

<p>Would I have preferred it if we swept the best version of a team that’s been on the precipice of winning it all for like 5 years? Sure. But it was Boston’s time this year.</p>

      <label for="l9gebrh" class="commentText"><p>The only criticism they deserve is about Lukas conditioning and behaviour with the refs. I don&rsquo;t doubt that he gives effort but it&rsquo;s really clear that if he could be just a little bit better conditioned he would have the energy later in games. And also he&rsquo;s just gotta stop whining to refs.</p>

<p>For the Mavs as a whole, they deserve a lot of credit. I do think they need another guy after Kyrie and Luka who then can go to when Kyrie isn&rsquo;t playing well.</p>

Chet is the Thunders 3rd best player (some argue second) and he is a rookie, so your logic applies to the Thunder as well that they have a weak supporting cast. No one thinks this of course since the Thunder have a very deep team, I&rsquo;m just pointing out how flawed your logic is.</p>
