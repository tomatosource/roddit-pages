      <label for="llzeosk" class="commentText"><p>Man did his career change after that championship season. Like he was a huge part of the reason they won that year, there was so much hype about this kid that worked hard to go from g league to potentially becoming the heir to Steph. He was hitting shots, getting to the line and had a higher free throw percent than Steph.  Locked a huge contract and looked set up to become one of the best offensive guards in the league. Then he got punched in the face, played like shit that year, got traded, played even worse, and now he’s considered a bum by just about everyone.</p>

<p>Icarus flew too close to the sun, but at least he got his ring.</p>

<p>Like&hellip; in basketball, it&rsquo;s already so advantageous to be tall. One of the very few drawbacks is how hard it is to dribble especially against much smaller guys with quick hands.</p>

<p>If they don&rsquo;t call carries it&rsquo;s just too easy. They can easily shoot over people they can easily drive by them too.</p>

<p>No he fucking wasn’t lmao. Are we really rewriting history from less than 2 years ago? Poole being bad was talked about ALL season.</p>

<p>He was awful all playoffs and while his regular season stats look only slightly worse, his game IQ tanked and he became way more selfish. Let’s not forget Steph was ejected from a game because he was so frustrated by Poole.</p>

He deff didn&rsquo;t come close to matching his contract &amp; was horrible early in the season but everything besides his 3pt shoot improved throughtout the year.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to blame him for that after the Dray hit. Dude was young af &amp; getting clowned by the world because his vet dropped him, of course his head might not be in the game.</p>

<p>Poole played well because of the team he was on. Put up great numbers but he also was a significant burden to the team’s culture and was selfish on a team that had Steph Curry and somewhat still intact Klay Thompson.</p>

<p>Acting like the Falcon Punch from Draymond has him playing like butt on Wizards is conjecture. He is playing the exact way I thought he would if he left Warriors. High volume streaky offensive player that has no accountability and an overall liability to the team.</p>

      <label for="lm09cyt" class="commentText"><p>Its crazy i mean that squad as it was maybe could have pulled off one more win. They were rolling hard. First KD and then Poole and Klay even. Plus, apparently, theres issues with Wiggins even. Idk what&rsquo;s happening, but the Warriors gotta find a way to lock down the chemistry before anything else, it seems. Draymond probably makes that hard since hes involved in a lot of this.</p>

<p>My point is let’s not throw words around like that at someone like Poole as he does not deserve that, even if he is over paid. Don’t forget that a failing franchise was half of that decision as well, he simply signed the paper.</p>

To perform at that level you have to maintain confidence. You have to BELIEVE you are great. And if you have talent you will be. After that punch he didn&rsquo;t believe in himself anymore.

And for everyone to side with Dray who was clearly in the wrong with his actions was enough to make him detach from the team. He talked shit and needed a lesson for sure but physical assault wasn&rsquo;t it. He is an emotional guy. Look at him when he watches that tribute for him. He took that punch, sure. But the real damage was on the inside for Poole.</p>

The team dynamic is already fucked at that point. Not saying the punch was right, but Poole definitely deserved it. You simply cannot be running your mouth like that on a winning team</p>

<p>Michael punched the shit out of Kerr at practice.</p>

<p>Then Kerr proceeded to hit the game winner in The Finals.</p>

<p>MJ is an asshole.  But he’s also a winner.  And is celebrated because of it</p>

<p>dude was a 6th man who got paid because he played well during a championship run. he doesn&rsquo;t have a huge resume or history to back this up. he made his money, cooled down, and tried to become a starter. sometimes it&rsquo;s not more complicated than that.</p>

<p>dude even lost his starter position with the WORST TEAM IN BASKETBALL for a bit lol</p>

<p>He’s also been away from draymond for 1 year. It’s easier to believe the 2 months was the anomaly and not the other 3-4 years</p>

<p>look at his first year in washington. he was a shitshow from the start. how you gonna come to your new team and try to act like the man. its wasn&rsquo;t 3 weeks before the wiz sucked even more if thats possible. you could palpably see the hate.</p>

Im not saying his life is over or anything but i think the hate is kinda lame. It’ll be some nice karma for Kerr and the Warriors front office when Curry retires and they realize the team is going to be shit because they put so little focus on the young guys.</p>

Poole was awful the season after winning the title. He was awful for the Wizards. If anything Warriors dodged a bullet getting that contract off. Poole went from improving every season to falling off a cliff he isn’t showing any signs of the things that got him to being a key member of the Warriors.</p>

You don’t seem to understand that he has given up he doesn’t care anymore. And i know you hate GS because you want to stick them with trash ass Poole lol.</p>
