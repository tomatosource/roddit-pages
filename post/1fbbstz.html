      <label for="llzeosk" class="commentText"><p>Man did his career change after that championship season. Like he was a huge part of the reason they won that year, there was so much hype about this kid that worked hard to go from g league to potentially becoming the heir to Steph. He was hitting shots, getting to the line and had a higher free throw percent than Steph.  Locked a huge contract and looked set up to become one of the best offensive guards in the league. Then he got punched in the face, played like shit that year, got traded, played even worse, and now he’s considered a bum by just about everyone.</p>

<p>Icarus flew too close to the sun, but at least he got his ring.</p>

<p>Like&hellip; in basketball, it&rsquo;s already so advantageous to be tall. One of the very few drawbacks is how hard it is to dribble especially against much smaller guys with quick hands.</p>

<p>If they don&rsquo;t call carries it&rsquo;s just too easy. They can easily shoot over people they can easily drive by them too.</p>

<p>No he fucking wasn’t lmao. Are we really rewriting history from less than 2 years ago? Poole being bad was talked about ALL season.</p>

<p>He was awful all playoffs and while his regular season stats look only slightly worse, his game IQ tanked and he became way more selfish. Let’s not forget Steph was ejected from a game because he was so frustrated by Poole.</p>

Poole definitely wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;good&rdquo; his last season with us but he was solid. He deff didn&rsquo;t come close to matching his contract &amp; was horrible early in the season but everything besides his 3pt shoot improved throughtout the year.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to blame him for that after the Dray hit. Dude was young af &amp; getting clowned by the world because his vet dropped him, of course his head might not be in the game.</p>

<p>Poole played well because of the team he was on. Put up great numbers but he also was a significant burden to the team’s culture and was selfish on a team that had Steph Curry and somewhat still intact Klay Thompson.</p>

<p>Acting like the Falcon Punch from Draymond has him playing like butt on Wizards is conjecture. He is playing the exact way I thought he would if he left Warriors. High volume streaky offensive player that has no accountability and an overall liability to the team.</p>

Lol how can you say talent when he’s been playing like utter crap you seem to think he would be playing better if he was in GS still and draymond wasn’t. You don’t seem to understand that he has given up he doesn’t care anymore. And i know you hate GS because you want to stick them with trash ass Poole lol.</p>
