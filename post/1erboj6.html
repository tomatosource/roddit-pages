<p>Harden, Westbrook, DWill, Klove off the bench.</p>

<p>Iguodala and Chandler elite role players</p>

<p>They blew out teams by 50+ every game, never had a moment where they looked weak or vulnerable while the &lsquo;24 team had question marks in almost every exhibition game and half the tournament games.</p>

<p>In &lsquo;12 Germany had Dirk, Spain had the Gasols+Ibaka, France had Tony Parker + 5 NBA players, etc. The World certainly wasn&rsquo;t a cakewalk</p>

<p>Overall, competition is far greater now. Imagine if Lithuania, Slovenia and possibly Croatia had qualified. The Olympics should really create an extra group with 4 teams, and only 2 teams from every group qualify.</p>

      <label for="lhxmkw6" class="commentText"><p>It is definitely weaker. KD and Lebron were two of the best players on the 2024 team and were definitely much better 12 years younger, prior to any health or fatigue issue.</p>

<p>To put it plainly, Lebron in 2012 could play the entire 40 minutes and be extremely effective, which is something he could not do that in 2024. His defense was miles above what it is now and he would close out and harass players on defense. Durant could easily blow by players as well as shoot from all over the court which is something that has been post to him over the years/injuries. The fast break would be even more deadly with guys like Westbrook/Harden. Chandler is actually a good counter to USA bigs as he was a quality big with good size to him.</p>

Ant and Kobe is weird since Kobe was on a decline and Ant is on the up but 2012 don&rsquo;t have Steph who will be the X-factor in any comparison.</p>

<p>92, 96, and 12 are the best teams. Any of those would be tough matchups. 08&rsquo;s bench ain&rsquo;t doing it for me.</p>

      <label for="lhxjpiw" class="commentText"><p>I was thinking the caliber of the foreign teams have just gone up. It’s harder to say one team (outside of the ones that have lost) is better or worse only based on their performances against another country.</p>

<p>My reason for favoring the 2024 team in any sort of best of 7 matchup is that everyone is a pretty solid on both ends of the court. I’d love to see a late career Durant vs Bird.</p>

<p>Both had the best players of the country in the midst of their prime years/prime athletic years.</p>

<p>Dwight would be a massive advantage over any post 2000s team. He was dynamic defender and more athletic by a mile than any other center.
2008 has prime Wade, prime DWill, prime Kobe, CP3 at his peak, and of course Lebron.</p>

<p>Just going by starters, it&rsquo;s era specific and hard to say really. 92 is a juggernaut with all the dudes in their prime. 96 has Shaq but no MJ. 08 has some prime players and could compete with starters. 12 is the same, but a few are getting older there too.</p>

<p>If 92 had prime Bird then they would have it, but they don&rsquo;t.</p>
