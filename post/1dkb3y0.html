      <p>Was trying to crosspost this from <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/1djw2b8/jaylen_brown_defended_luka_don%C4%8Di%C4%87_for_1544/" target="_blank">here</a>, but for whatever reason it wasn&rsquo;t working.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/AndrewDBailey/status/1802943815428501872" target="_blank">This is the original tweet</a></p>

<p>Brown was amazing defensively on Luka this series and a well deserved FMVP. Just in general I think he&rsquo;s improved as a defender and a play-maker. Luka faced a lot of great defenders on his trip to the Finals and I&rsquo;m not sure anyone played him better than Brown.</p>

<p>People kind of wrote him off earlier in the year because it took until around Christmas for him to fit into the team with the two new starters.</p>

      <label for="l9igueh" class="commentText"><p>He’s so fat I mean just look at his gut, that thing is built like a watermelon. When he’s locked in he just makes it really hard to get any food away from him. Especially when he’s in line at Golden Corral, you need that requisite strength to not let him steal everything off your plate.</p>

<p>Kelvin was definitely one of my favourite players to watch this year. The weight gain he’s had especially since the turn of the calendar kinda went under the radar. He’s been cultivating an extreme amount of mass since January.</p>

So when the Celtics are leaving their guys on islands your other guys aren’t getting clean looks. The heliocentric style can make your offense one dimensional so the draw back is if you play a team that has the personnel to make that not effective you are stuck. Playing the heliocentric style was the best way to maximize you efficiency all year tho so it is what it is</p>

      <label for="l9i4wfy" class="commentText"><p>Well the thing is, it could have worked and it did work until you ran into a team that can literally switch everything and at all times has five good defenders on the floor. No team has that besides the Celtics, every team has at least one flaw or matchup you can focus on. To beat a team like the Celtics with the Mavs game plan, you need a third scorer/ball handler to be able to attack and initiate the offense when Luka/Kyrie are off or just to not force them to have to create everything the whole game.</p>

<p>Dream scenario to fix that would be Bridges, but the Nets don’t want to get rid of him even for massive trade packages and the rest of the league wants him as well. Most likely going to have to settle for Wiggins or Jerami Grant most likely.</p>

<p>That was the key.  Boston was the only team that didn&rsquo;t have someone hidden on defense that they could rotate into a matchup with Luka.  Without this favorable matchup, there&rsquo;s no help rushing in.  No help means none of the usual passing lanes for Luka.</p>

So the players spoke and felt like the offensive identity was pretty good, but by shifting to that, they felt they lost what made them work on defense. Joe listened and got this team locked in on defense, adjusted the offense game plan a little (still a lot of chucking, but also more of working to just find the open guy to take a high percentage shot).</p>

<p>How easy would it have been for Joe to tell the team stick to his plan. But he listened and frankensteined the philosophies together. We still didn&rsquo;t really lock in offensively at any point in the finals until maybe the last game. But the defense kept the games manageable.  Great coaching and great effort by the players.</p>

To me it was almost like Lebron against the Spurs in 2007, overmatched and didn’t play well against a well oiled machine.  JB may be better but it’s much harder to guard one guy when the 4 others can contribute.  Other than Kyrie, Luka didn’t have a ton of contribution consistently from a bunch of guys.</p>

<p>Mavs couldn’t play Tatum or Brown 1 on 1 and they’d attack Luka, causing the D to collapse in the paint, generating a bunch of wide open shots for our role players (who are also better than the Mavs role players).</p>

When that&rsquo;s the case he is going to have the greatest impact even when he plays like ass. Its just the way that team is built.</p>

<p>The Celtics on the other hand are not built around any one player they are built around the strengths of the collective. Thats really hard to do in the &lsquo;stats are king&rsquo; era when most stars need to get theirs.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m sure almost every team would like to build a team like Boston, but that&rsquo;s just hard to do. If you take any other star duo and put Holiday, White, KP and Horford around them that&rsquo;s a contender and star players don&rsquo;t need to put up big stats.</p>

      <label for="l9gul8j" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, the Mavs offense would cease to function without him. The eye test confirms this as well; without Kyrie performing it was pretty much all on Luka.</p>

<p>Despite the stats, he still generated good looks for his teammates and used his gravity to manipulate the defense; however, the rest of the Mavs were struggling to hit shots and the Celtics did a fantastic job defending 1-5.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not diminishing JB&rsquo;s great defense, but he was one part of the Mavs being shut down offensively while Luka was pretty much running the offense by himself. Conversely, I would value a defender who can carry the whole defense (e.g. Gobert in Utah, AD, Draymond at times, etc.) higher than an offensive player that is slotting into a larger system.</p>

      <label for="l9gi9z9" class="commentText"><p>Don&rsquo;t let /r/nba hear this, but Luka wasn&rsquo;t <em>actually</em> the best player this series. He simply averaged the highest number of points and shot really well from the mid-range for most of the series.</p>

<p>Jaylen Brown - 20.8 PPG on 16.8 FGA per game, 5.4 RPG, 5.0 APG, and a 53.5 TS% with 2.8 turnovers per game. Splits were <sup>44</sup>&frasl;<sub>23</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>73</sub>.3.</p>

<p>Jayson Tatum - 22.2 PPG on 19.6 FGA per game, 7.8 RPG, 7.2 APG, and a 50.5 TS% with 3.2 turnovers per game. Splits were 38.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>26</sub>.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>92</sub>.6.</p>

<p>Luka Doncic - 29.2 PPG on 25.0 FGA per game, 8.8 RPG, 5.6 APG, and a 53.0 TS% with 4.6 turnovers per game. Splits were 47.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub>.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>58</sub>.6.</p>

<p>Those are just counting stats, so they don&rsquo;t tell the <em>whole</em> story, obviously, and not much about the defensive side of things, but everyone seems really obsessed with efficiency and Luka wasn&rsquo;t even particularly efficient this series with the opportunities he did have.</p>

      <label for="l9gjs6b" class="commentText"><p>The impact of him being a turnstile actually had more of an impact on guys like Jrue Holiday, for example, who was really efficient with the passes he got from Tatum. This is because the blow-bys themselves were overinflated in importance, the bigger issue was that he would not rotate once he did get blown by, which left dudes wide open. Oversimplified example here, but if Tatum or someone blows by Luka, the low-man or corner man (or both) has to commit to him fully - at that point, if Luka isn&rsquo;t leaking over and rotating to pick up whoever they were guarding, he&rsquo;s effectively spectating, and someone is about to either get a free layup or three point attempt.</p>

      <label for="l9gn7f7" class="commentText"><p>Luka wasn’t good on D, but that wasn’t the Mavs’ problem in the series despite what the overwhelming narrative is. Mavs had a 106.4 DRtg in the 38.8mpg minutes Luka played and a solid 109.2 DRtg overall. Mavs’ D did as well as anyone could expect it against a team that posted a record 122.2 ORtg in the regular season and 119.6 through the first three rounds.</p>

<p>Mavs’ offence was the problem, a lot of that stemming from the quality of Boston’s individual defenders up and down the lineup, which allowed Boston to guard everyone one on one much more of the time. Very very few teams can run a scheme like that. It meant nobody was open very often. In previous series Mavs could take advantage of defensive breakdowns, leading to good efficiency by meh offensive players further down the roster - but in the finals there weren’t many to exploit. Between Luka’s myriad injuries and whatever was going on with Kyrie (especially in Boston), their 1-on-1 ability wasn’t their A+ that would maybe have given Mavs a chance.</p>

<p>I actually agree with this on the team level. But when we&rsquo;re talking individual performance, we have to factor in defense if we&rsquo;re factoring in offense. If a guy played really good offense and really good defense on the way to winning it all, it&rsquo;s tough for me to say a guy who played great offense and poor defense on the way to a series loss played better overall.</p>

<p>But in general, I think your analysis is spot on. I think of all the teams in the playoffs, only the Pacers were schematically equipped to consistently deal with Boston&rsquo;s defense because half the philosophy was pushing the pace to get points before we even set up. Teams can do it for a couple of possessions, but that&rsquo;s not something that you can just up and do for whole games when you feel like it though.</p>

<p>And while JB played some of the best 1 on 1 defense I&rsquo;ve seen on Luka, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d say Luka was totally locked up by Brown. It was a team effort. Jrue and White did really well on Luka too. The whole point of Boston is that there&rsquo;s no one in their team that can be targeted and they have the most versatile defense. They can run any scheme extremely well.</p>

<p>Also, JB wasn&rsquo;t only on Luka. He also did a great job on Kyrie. Definitely well deserved FMVP. That said, I do think Brown was overall the best player in the series.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d disagree with this.</p>

<p>He had a poor game 4 offensively, but averaging 20/5/5 while making critical game changing shots during every game won is a great offensive series from your first or second option on any team.</p>

<p>The Pacers series, where he averaged 30 points on 52% from the field and 37% from 3 was a good offensive series.</p>

      <label for="l9iexui" class="commentText"><p>as a celtics fan, yes Luka was better lol. at least first half luka, and then after defending every possession and having to do 99% of the offense, he would get gassed in the second half.</p>

<p>Its easier to play good defense when you have 4 other players on your team that can drop 40 if they feel like it.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s apples to oranges but I remember people saying that KD had a better series than LeBron in 2017 and that really couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth because of LeBron&rsquo;s responsibility and performance. In this series its a little similar because all the stars shot poorly but Luka was basically alone thanks to the Kyrie no-show.</p>

      <label for="l9iy1w4" class="commentText"><p>Not a fair comparison. Luka was shouldering the entire offensive load and as much as he was getting attacked on defence he also had to hold up on that end. Jaylen as much as he was guarding Luka was often getting switched off and getting little breaks, not to mention having the entire teams focus as well.</p>

<p>Luka was basically the entire offensive and defensive focus for both teams and he still dominated at times.</p>

<p>No disrespect to Jaylen his defence, especially screen navigation to stick with Luka was some of the best defence i’ve seen on him.</p>

<p>How would team points work for partial possessions?</p>

<p>If Jaylen guards Doncic for 5 seconds and then switches off him, Jaylen gets credited with a partial possession guarding him. But do they count the team points if the Mavs score later that possession while someone else is guarding Doncic?</p>

      <label for="l9i458g" class="commentText"><p>If you haven&rsquo;t already, you should go watching Thinking Basketball&rsquo;s most recent video on the Celtics. Part of Brown&rsquo;s brilliance on defense is that he fought super hard through and around screens to avoid switches whenever possible, and he was also great at ball denial when he was guarding Luka off ball. So yeah partial possession stats don&rsquo;t tell the full story, but just looking at extended 1v1 sequences doesn&rsquo;t tell the full story either. And of course it helps to have other elite defenders at basically every position</p>

The impact of his defense is not going to show up so obviously in the box score and that defensive intensity absolutely would cause anyone to put up relatively weaker offensive stats due to fatigue.</p>

<p>The entire Celtics team in general put such a priority on playing defense and not focusing on just scoring which lead them to never really having that one explosive offensive game that you would expect given how strong their offense was in the regular season.</p>

It&rsquo;s always been apparent from how teams defend the Celtics, though that may change next year since Tatum&rsquo;s learned how to force the help and make the right play more effectively (and with the Celtics&rsquo; array of weapons).</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think saying he&rsquo;s the &ldquo;worst&rdquo; finals MVP since Iguodala is a diss &ndash; all the others since then are MVP level guys. He&rsquo;s also the best no. 2 since AD in 2020. And probably only Curry/KD, AD, and Pau were better over the last 20 years. I think it&rsquo;s cool to give it to guys who aren&rsquo;t the no. 1 option once in a while, even though the no. 1 option is pretty much always the MVP of the team.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re nuts comparing Tatum who scored 22 ppg on 39% shooting to all-time great finals performances by Bird, Duncan, Lebron and Jokic.  It&rsquo;s a mediocre finals performance and you think Tatum didn&rsquo;t win because of some narrative.</p>

We played him 1v1 till he got in the paint at and then swarmed him at times or we played straight up 1v1 with either Grant or Al. We’re really good at taking away other players in the series and make every match up 1v1 and have the law of averages work in our favour.</p>

      <label for="l9horvf" class="commentText"><p>I think one small tweak that really elevated the Celtics defense this season was having Brown pick up the other teams primary ball handler way more often. Even though we have Jrue and White, JB&rsquo;s biggest weakness has always been off-ball defense. The Stock Exchange are great off-ball defenders and screen navigators, and JB is still an elite man defender against bigger guards, wings, and smaller forwards. Having JB on ball eliminates some easy back door cuts where Jaylen would fall asleep, and at the same time it allows White and Holiday to roam and provide help (which they are also elite at).</p>

He didn&rsquo;t get bullied, and he didn&rsquo;t fall for any of the little tricks he does to get you out of position so he can either score or get a foul. Brown was just forcing him into tough shot after tough shot. That&rsquo;s the key. Luka is still gonna make a lot of shots. But when you make him have to earn every single one, the energy isn&rsquo;t there at the end of games.</p>
