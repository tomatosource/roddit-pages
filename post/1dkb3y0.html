      <p>Was trying to crosspost this from <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/1djw2b8/jaylen_brown_defended_luka_don%C4%8Di%C4%87_for_1544/" target="_blank">here</a>, but for whatever reason it wasn&rsquo;t working.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/AndrewDBailey/status/1802943815428501872" target="_blank">This is the original tweet</a></p>

<p>Brown was amazing defensively on Luka this series and a well deserved FMVP. Just in general I think he&rsquo;s improved as a defender and a play-maker. Luka faced a lot of great defenders on his trip to the Finals and I&rsquo;m not sure anyone played him better than Brown.</p>

One good shooter doesn&rsquo;t make a good offense and one good defender doesn&rsquo;t make a good defense (unless you&rsquo;re Wemby? lol).

So when the Celtics are leaving their guys on islands your other guys aren’t getting clean looks. The heliocentric style can make your offense one dimensional so the draw back is if you play a team that has the personnel to make that not effective you are stuck. Playing the heliocentric style was the best way to maximize you efficiency all year tho so it is what it is</p>

DJJ was hitting crazy shit in earlier series, same with PJ, and lively is good. So I think it’s unfair to phrase how you are. But this is another good question. Will Luke be willing to play a different playstyle when you guys inevitably add more talent. I think he will, but it’s also a fair question</p>

The other guys are only in their for defense and occasional assist catches from one of them.  The Celtics are a uniquely well-balanced team.  I don&rsquo;t think many teams can replicate what they do, especially with the new cap system.</p>

All outside of Luka and Kyrie have no offensive game or very little of it if they aren&rsquo;t spoon fed. The heliocentric offense is the only option for them.
They were targeting luka on defense for a reason. And that&rsquo;s not because of his bad defense (although that makes it even better) but because they had to tire him to slow him on offense. You slow him down when Kyrie has a bad game and the Mavs are cooked.</p>

<p>That was the key.  Boston was the only team that didn&rsquo;t have someone hidden on defense that they could rotate into a matchup with Luka.  Without this favorable matchup, there&rsquo;s no help rushing in.  No help means none of the usual passing lanes for Luka.</p>

      <label for="l9htvar" class="commentText"><p>This is to Joe&rsquo;s credit, but also to the team. But I remember after they got bounced last year, the team spoke with Joe about their identity. Joe supposedly wanted them to just chuck up threes and the law of averages would make this a successful strategy. Only issue is what happens when it fails in the playoffs. So the players spoke and felt like the offensive identity was pretty good, but by shifting to that, they felt they lost what made them work on defense. Joe listened and got this team locked in on defense, adjusted the offense game plan a little (still a lot of chucking, but also more of working to just find the open guy to take a high percentage shot).</p>

<p>How easy would it have been for Joe to tell the team stick to his plan. But he listened and frankensteined the philosophies together. We still didn&rsquo;t really lock in offensively at any point in the finals until maybe the last game. But the defense kept the games manageable.  Great coaching and great effort by the players.</p>

To me it was almost like Lebron against the Spurs in 2007, overmatched and didn’t play well against a well oiled machine.  JB may be better but it’s much harder to guard one guy when the 4 others can contribute.  Other than Kyrie, Luka didn’t have a ton of contribution consistently from a bunch of guys.</p>

<p>Mavs couldn’t play Tatum or Brown 1 on 1 and they’d attack Luka, causing the D to collapse in the paint, generating a bunch of wide open shots for our role players (who are also better than the Mavs role players).</p>

When that&rsquo;s the case he is going to have the greatest impact even when he plays like ass. Its just the way that team is built.</p>

<p>The Celtics on the other hand are not built around any one player they are built around the strengths of the collective. Thats really hard to do in the &lsquo;stats are king&rsquo; era when most stars need to get theirs.</p>

      <label for="l9gul8j" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, the Mavs offense would cease to function without him. The eye test confirms this as well; without Kyrie performing it was pretty much all on Luka.</p>

<p>Despite the stats, he still generated good looks for his teammates and used his gravity to manipulate the defense; however, the rest of the Mavs were struggling to hit shots and the Celtics did a fantastic job defending 1-5.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not diminishing JB&rsquo;s great defense, but he was one part of the Mavs being shut down offensively while Luka was pretty much running the offense by himself. Conversely, I would value a defender who can carry the whole defense (e.g. Gobert in Utah, AD, Draymond at times, etc.) higher than an offensive player that is slotting into a larger system.</p>

      <label for="l9gi9z9" class="commentText"><p>Don&rsquo;t let /r/nba hear this, but Luka wasn&rsquo;t <em>actually</em> the best player this series. He simply averaged the highest number of points and shot really well from the mid-range for most of the series.</p>

<p>Jaylen Brown - 20.8 PPG on 16.8 FGA per game, 5.4 RPG, 5.0 APG, and a 53.5 TS% with 2.8 turnovers per game. Splits were <sup>44</sup>&frasl;<sub>23</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>73</sub>.3.</p>

<p>Jayson Tatum - 22.2 PPG on 19.6 FGA per game, 7.8 RPG, 7.2 APG, and a 50.5 TS% with 3.2 turnovers per game. Splits were 38.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>26</sub>.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>92</sub>.6.</p>

<p>Luka Doncic - 29.2 PPG on 25.0 FGA per game, 8.8 RPG, 5.6 APG, and a 53.0 TS% with 4.6 turnovers per game. Splits were 47.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub>.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>58</sub>.6.</p>

<p>Those are just counting stats, so they don&rsquo;t tell the <em>whole</em> story, obviously, and not much about the defensive side of things, but everyone seems really obsessed with efficiency and Luka wasn&rsquo;t even particularly efficient this series with the opportunities he did have.</p>

      <label for="l9gjs6b" class="commentText"><p>The impact of him being a turnstile actually had more of an impact on guys like Jrue Holiday, for example, who was really efficient with the passes he got from Tatum. This is because the blow-bys themselves were overinflated in importance, the bigger issue was that he would not rotate once he did get blown by, which left dudes wide open. Oversimplified example here, but if Tatum or someone blows by Luka, the low-man or corner man (or both) has to commit to him fully - at that point, if Luka isn&rsquo;t leaking over and rotating to pick up whoever they were guarding, he&rsquo;s effectively spectating, and someone is about to either get a free layup or three point attempt.</p>

      <label for="l9gn7f7" class="commentText"><p>Luka wasn’t good on D, but that wasn’t the Mavs’ problem in the series despite what the overwhelming narrative is. Mavs had a 106.4 DRtg in the 38.8mpg minutes Luka played and a solid 109.2 DRtg overall. Mavs’ D did as well as anyone could expect it against a team that posted a record 122.2 ORtg in the regular season and 119.6 through the first three rounds.</p>

<p>Mavs’ offence was the problem, a lot of that stemming from the quality of Boston’s individual defenders up and down the lineup, which allowed Boston to guard everyone one on one much more of the time. Very very few teams can run a scheme like that. It meant nobody was open very often. In previous series Mavs could take advantage of defensive breakdowns, leading to good efficiency by meh offensive players further down the roster - but in the finals there weren’t many to exploit. Between Luka’s myriad injuries and whatever was going on with Kyrie (especially in Boston), their 1-on-1 ability wasn’t their A+ that would maybe have given Mavs a chance.</p>

<p>I actually agree with this on the team level. But when we&rsquo;re talking individual performance, we have to factor in defense if we&rsquo;re factoring in offense. If a guy played really good offense and really good defense on the way to winning it all, it&rsquo;s tough for me to say a guy who played great offense and poor defense on the way to a series loss played better overall.</p>

<p>But in general, I think your analysis is spot on. I think of all the teams in the playoffs, only the Pacers were schematically equipped to consistently deal with Boston&rsquo;s defense because half the philosophy was pushing the pace to get points before we even set up. Teams can do it for a couple of possessions, but that&rsquo;s not something that you can just up and do for whole games when you feel like it though.</p>

<p>Bro looked like garbage defensively for 3 games in a row, showed up defensively for a few minutes in game 4, and went right back to being a pylon in game 5 with a side of chucking from 3 and hitting nothing when it mattered (16 points before it was already a blowout). Meanwhile, both the Jays played big roles in the great defense that kept the Mavs from reaching 100 points four games out of five and had great offensive efforts that never let the Mavs closer than 7 points in any win.

<p>The best teams can always rack up great stats, but individual player comparisons are more than that.</p>

<p>And while JB played some of the best 1 on 1 defense I&rsquo;ve seen on Luka, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d say Luka was totally locked up by Brown. It was a team effort. Jrue and White did really well on Luka too. The whole point of Boston is that there&rsquo;s no one in their team that can be targeted and they have the most versatile defense. They can run any scheme extremely well.</p>

<p>Also, JB wasn&rsquo;t only on Luka. He also did a great job on Kyrie. Definitely well deserved FMVP. That said, I do think Brown was overall the best player in the series.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d disagree with this.</p>

<p>He had a poor game 4 offensively, but averaging 20/5/5 while making critical game changing shots during every game won is a great offensive series from your first or second option on any team.</p>

      <label for="l9gk0ed" class="commentText"><p>After seeing Luka&rsquo;s AST-TO ratio and bad FTs to go along with the horrible defense it&rsquo;s definitely close.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s apples to oranges but I remember people saying that KD had a better series than LeBron in 2017 and that really couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth because of LeBron&rsquo;s responsibility and performance. In this series its a little similar because all the stars shot poorly but Luka was basically alone thanks to the Kyrie no-show.</p>

      <label for="l9gpa4b" class="commentText"><p>The thing is, LeBron in 2017 was capable both offensively and defensively and put in plenty of work on both ends. You can sort of put it on responsibilities when that&rsquo;s the case, and I agree with you that LeBron&rsquo;s cumulative individual effort on both ends outpaced KD for me.</p>

<p>I disagree that it was similar to Luka. Luka&rsquo;s issue wasn&rsquo;t too much responsibility, it was the fact that he was hunted on defense with the explicit win/win of 1) you either blow by him and he doesn&rsquo;t rotate, leading to points, or 2) he puts in effort and even if he gets the stop, that chips away at his effectiveness on offense because he&rsquo;s never been particularly conditioned. I don&rsquo;t necessarily think that&rsquo;s a responsibility issue.</p>

<p>I remember watching the Minneapolis series and wondering why they were not getting Luka involved defensively in every single action - half the time he seemed to be just stashed in the corner effectively resting.</p>

<p>And picked up full court and covered by ball denial D. Keeping Luka working the entire game definitely worked (check out his 4th quarters). I&rsquo;m sure it was compounded by his injury but he really should get in better shape. Brown&rsquo;s conditioning is obviously way better.</p>

      <label for="l9hvnzk" class="commentText"><p>100p - and frankly, there&rsquo;s no denying that Luka was hurting, but to me that would be more of a factor if Luka was renowned as some specimen who could play his game forever before any injuries &ndash; we handled the Mavs in a  similar/same way in the regular season. He&rsquo;s just not that guy even when he&rsquo;s fully healthy, and this is a gameplan that would have worked on him regardless for that reason. Maybe this will be a wake up call.</p>

<p>Do you really think the guarding of Luka made a bigger impact than Kyrie disappearing completely and the rest of the role players bricking basically everything?</p>

<p>Also, Luka was hobbled with multiple injuries and that fatigued him the more the playoffs went on. Even so, Lukas 3 was off this series obviously, but he basically got what he wanted from 2.</p>

Dort got away with a lot of constant fouling in that series, also that&rsquo;s the series where his injuries looked the worst by far.</p>

<p>JB should have been all-defense but that Celtics team is perfect in almost every way on defense. Simmons at his best was the rare real 1-5 defender, something that gets thrown around too much but he was one of the very few.</p>

      <label for="l9gi9s9" class="commentText"><p>People have been saying that Jaylen is one of the weaker Finals MVPs but they should realize how much energy he had to exert on both ends of the court. The impact of his defense is not going to show up so obviously in the box score and that defensive intensity absolutely would cause anyone to put up relatively weaker offensive stats due to fatigue.</p>

<p>The entire Celtics team in general put such a priority on playing defense and not focusing on just scoring which lead them to never really having that one explosive offensive game that you would expect given how strong their offense was in the regular season.</p>

      <label for="l9glw4x" class="commentText"><p>I think there were quite a few possessions on offense where they were clearly not trying to move the ball but rather drain clock, go iso, and rely on shooting variance to get them at least some points, but it also allowed them to get back on defense instantly because defending the Mavs was crucial at times.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re nuts comparing Tatum who scored 22 ppg on 39% shooting to all-time great finals performances by Bird, Duncan, Lebron and Jokic.  It&rsquo;s a mediocre finals performance and you think Tatum didn&rsquo;t win because of some narrative.</p>

      <label for="l9horvf" class="commentText"><p>I think one small tweak that really elevated the Celtics defense this season was having Brown pick up the other teams primary ball handler way more often. Even though we have Jrue and White, JB&rsquo;s biggest weakness has always been off-ball defense. The Stock Exchange are great off-ball defenders and screen navigators, and JB is still an elite man defender against bigger guards, wings, and smaller forwards. Having JB on ball eliminates some easy back door cuts where Jaylen would fall asleep, and at the same time it allows White and Holiday to roam and provide help (which they are also elite at).</p>

He didn&rsquo;t get bullied, and he didn&rsquo;t fall for any of the little tricks he does to get you out of position so he can either score or get a foul. Brown was just forcing him into tough shot after tough shot. That&rsquo;s the key. Luka is still gonna make a lot of shots. But when you make him have to earn every single one, the energy isn&rsquo;t there at the end of games.</p>
