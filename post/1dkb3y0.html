      <p>Was trying to crosspost this from <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/1djw2b8/jaylen_brown_defended_luka_don%C4%8Di%C4%87_for_1544/" target="_blank">here</a>, but for whatever reason it wasn&rsquo;t working.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/AndrewDBailey/status/1802943815428501872" target="_blank">This is the original tweet</a></p>

<p>Brown was amazing defensively on Luka this series and a well deserved FMVP. Just in general I think he&rsquo;s improved as a defender and a play-maker. Luka faced a lot of great defenders on his trip to the Finals and I&rsquo;m not sure anyone played him better than Brown.</p>

<p>People kind of wrote him off earlier in the year because it took until around Christmas for him to fit into the team with the two new starters.</p>

      <label for="l9ggokk" class="commentText"><p>Roles are entirely different.  Boston has better talent at most positions and Luka is forced to do too much.  To me it was almost like Lebron against the Spurs in 2007, overmatched and didn’t play well against a well oiled machine.  JB may be better but it’s much harder to guard one guy when the 4 others can contribute.  Other than Kyrie, Luka didn’t have a ton of contribution consistently from a bunch of guys.</p>

      <label for="l9ghif8" class="commentText"><p>I mean that was part of the defensive scheme though. They kept everyone at home on the role players because they could guard Luka 1 on 1.</p>

<p>Mavs couldn’t play Tatum or Brown 1 on 1 and they’d attack Luka, causing the D to collapse in the paint, generating a bunch of wide open shots for our role players (who are also better than the Mavs role players).</p>

      <label for="l9gul8j" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, the Mavs offense would cease to function without him. The eye test confirms this as well; without Kyrie performing it was pretty much all on Luka.</p>

<p>Despite the stats, he still generated good looks for his teammates and used his gravity to manipulate the defense; however, the rest of the Mavs were struggling to hit shots and the Celtics did a fantastic job defending 1-5.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not diminishing JB&rsquo;s great defense, but he was one part of the Mavs being shut down offensively while Luka was pretty much running the offense by himself. Conversely, I would value a defender who can carry the whole defense (e.g. Gobert in Utah, AD, Draymond at times, etc.) higher than an offensive player that is slotting into a larger system.</p>

      <label for="l9gyge6" class="commentText"><p>Yeah and his stats would tank if he played real team basketball with actual ball movement instead of his heliocentricity. You can&rsquo;t have your cake and eat it too. The factors that make it &ldquo;all on Luka&rdquo; are the same as what let him pump up 30+point triple double every other night.</p>

<p>As a side note, all this should do is make people really appreciate guys like Bron that much more. With heliocentricity, pace, space, and statistical inflation guys like Luka are getting crazy numbers and people are starting to get a little inflated on their status. It was all on Bron against maybe the best team ever(KD Warriors), he still put up 34/12/10 on 63%TS one year and 34/9/10 on 62%TS the next(and he actually played defense).</p>

<p>Jaylen Brown - 20.8 PPG on 16.8 FGA per game, 5.4 RPG, 5.0 APG, and a 53.5 TS% with 2.8 turnovers per game. Splits were <sup>44</sup>&frasl;<sub>23</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>73</sub>.3.</p>

<p>Jayson Tatum - 22.2 PPG on 19.6 FGA per game, 7.8 RPG, 7.2 APG, and a 50.5 TS% with 3.2 turnovers per game. Splits were 38.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>26</sub>.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>92</sub>.6.</p>

<p>Luka Doncic - 29.2 PPG on 25.0 FGA per game, 8.8 RPG, 5.6 APG, and a 53.0 TS% with 4.6 turnovers per game. Splits were 47.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub>.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>58</sub>.6.</p>

<p>Those are just counting stats, so they don&rsquo;t tell the <em>whole</em> story, obviously, and not much about the defensive side of things, but everyone seems really obsessed with efficiency and Luka wasn&rsquo;t even particularly efficient this series with the opportunities he did have.</p>

      <label for="l9gjs6b" class="commentText"><p>The impact of him being a turnstile actually had more of an impact on guys like Jrue Holiday, for example, who was really efficient with the passes he got from Tatum. This is because the blow-bys themselves were overinflated in importance, the bigger issue was that he would not rotate once he did get blown by, which left dudes wide open. Oversimplified example here, but if Tatum or someone blows by Luka, the low-man or corner man (or both) has to commit to him fully - at that point, if Luka isn&rsquo;t leaking over and rotating to pick up whoever they were guarding, he&rsquo;s effectively spectating, and someone is about to either get a free layup or three point attempt.</p>

      <label for="l9gn7f7" class="commentText"><p>Luka wasn’t good on D, but that wasn’t the Mavs’ problem in the series despite what the overwhelming narrative is. Mavs had a 106.4 DRtg in the 38.8mpg minutes Luka played and a solid 109.2 DRtg overall. Mavs’ D did as well as anyone could expect it against a team that posted a record 122.2 ORtg in the regular season and 119.6 through the first three rounds.</p>

<p>Mavs’ offence was the problem, a lot of that stemming from the quality of Boston’s individual defenders up and down the lineup, which allowed Boston to guard everyone one on one much more of the time. Very very few teams can run a scheme like that. It meant nobody was open very often. In previous series Mavs could take advantage of defensive breakdowns, leading to good efficiency by meh offensive players further down the roster - but in the finals there weren’t many to exploit. Between Luka’s myriad injuries and whatever was going on with Kyrie (especially in Boston), their 1-on-1 ability wasn’t their A+ that would maybe have given Mavs a chance.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I actually agree with this on the team level. But when we&rsquo;re talking individual performance, we have to factor in defense if we&rsquo;re factoring in offense. If a guy played really good offense and really good defense on the way to winning it all, it&rsquo;s tough for me to say a guy who played great offense and poor defense on the way to a series loss played better overall.</p>

<p>But in general, I think your analysis is spot on. I think of all the teams in the playoffs, only the Pacers were schematically equipped to consistently deal with Boston&rsquo;s defense because half the philosophy was pushing the pace to get points before we even set up. Teams can do it for a couple of possessions, but that&rsquo;s not something that you can just up and do for whole games when you feel like it though.</p>

      <label for="l9goqb3" class="commentText"><p>&ldquo;Abusing&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t the word I&rsquo;d use. JB played well but it hardly had a great series for him on the offensive end.</p>

<p>And while JB played some of the best 1 on 1 defense I&rsquo;ve seen on Luka, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d say Luka was totally locked up by Brown. It was a team effort. Jrue and White did really well on Luka too. The whole point of Boston is that there&rsquo;s no one in their team that can be targeted and they have the most versatile defense. They can run any scheme extremely well.</p>

<p>Also, JB wasn&rsquo;t only on Luka. He also did a great job on Kyrie. Definitely well deserved FMVP. That said, I do think Brown was overall the best player in the series.</p>

      <label for="l9gk0ed" class="commentText"><p>After seeing Luka&rsquo;s AST-TO ratio and bad FTs to go along with the horrible defense it&rsquo;s definitely close.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s apples to oranges but I remember people saying that KD had a better series than LeBron in 2017 and that really couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth because of LeBron&rsquo;s responsibility and performance. In this series its a little similar because all the stars shot poorly but Luka was basically alone thanks to the Kyrie no-show.</p>

      <label for="l9gpa4b" class="commentText"><p>The thing is, LeBron in 2017 was capable both offensively and defensively and put in plenty of work on both ends. You can sort of put it on responsibilities when that&rsquo;s the case, and I agree with you that LeBron&rsquo;s cumulative individual effort on both ends outpaced KD for me.</p>

<p>I disagree that it was similar to Luka. Luka&rsquo;s issue wasn&rsquo;t too much responsibility, it was the fact that he was hunted on defense with the explicit win/win of 1) you either blow by him and he doesn&rsquo;t rotate, leading to points, or 2) he puts in effort and even if he gets the stop, that chips away at his effectiveness on offense because he&rsquo;s never been particularly conditioned. I don&rsquo;t necessarily think that&rsquo;s a responsibility issue.</p>

<p>I remember watching the Minneapolis series and wondering why they were not getting Luka involved defensively in every single action - half the time he seemed to be just stashed in the corner effectively resting.</p>

Dort got away with a lot of constant fouling in that series, also that&rsquo;s the series where his injuries looked the worst by far.</p>

<p>JB should have been all-defense but that Celtics team is perfect in almost every way on defense. Simmons at his best was the rare real 1-5 defender, something that gets thrown around too much but he was one of the very few.</p>

      <label for="l9gldrx" class="commentText"><p>It depends on how you look at it. Tatum is the reason the whole offense even functions the way it does at all. But brown is the guy who actually stepped up and took advantage of what Tatum was creating and had the big moment buckets. Brown also was absolutely lock down on defense because Tatum was playing the role of defending bigs. Tatum is a lock down defender too and I&rsquo;m sure he would have given Luka trouble but they needed Tatum elsewhere and brown stepped up when he was needed most. This was as complete a team win as I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>

      <label for="l9goe68" class="commentText"><p>Yeah. All year Tatum has had a ridiculous +/-. Even despite his poor shooting, his assists and rebounds and defense have a huge impact on the game.</p>

<p>I understand the criticism that &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a superstar, its not enough for him to just be a playmaker he needs to score efficiency as well&rdquo; because in 90% of cases it&rsquo;s true but this team is just so different. You can have your best player take more of a supplemental role cause you got guys like JB and White who can easily make up for the offensive slack. And it&rsquo;s not like jt was scoring 15 points a game, he was putting up decent points on below average efficiency. It&rsquo;s a weird series but it actually makes me more confident in the team.</p>

<p>If you watch the post game interviews with JB and all the other players they keep harping on the fact that JT has to sacrifice a lot of his game in order to make the whole system work, and he did. Of course Tatum still took a lot of bad shots. So I do agree with you that JB was better and deserved FMVP, but I think it&rsquo;s also very interesting to see how they both played off each other.</p>

<p>Well on one hand Tatum scored more, assisted more, rebounded more with more impactful defense than Jaylen brown (pretty much single-handedly shut down mavs lobs which won them the series against minny and was the best defender on the floor in Indiana as well).</p>

<p>On the other hand it would make Luka fanboys very angry to acknowledge this.</p>

<p>So it’s kinda a competition</p>

<p>The irony of this fucking statement when other fandoms lift up one star and/or roleplayer exclusively to diss the team&rsquo;s star is hilarious. We love Jaylen - he absolutely played out of his mind this series and the conference finals. We also know the differences between Jaylen and Jayson better than most fan bases do.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Did you know that Jayson Tatum is the first player to lead his team in points, assists, and rebounds while winning a championship (including the finals) and not win FMVP? There&rsquo;s only been 5 other guys that have done that. I think considering Tatum shot 39% from the field, that&rsquo;s a far more significant fact.</p>

<p>Happy for Jaylen though - him winning is ultimately much better for our team chemistry.</p>

<p>If Jaylen guards Doncic for 5 seconds and then switches off him, Jaylen gets credited with a partial possession guarding him. But do they count the team points if the Mavs score later that possession while someone else is guarding Doncic?</p>

      <label for="l9gi9s9" class="commentText"><p>People have been saying that Jaylen is one of the weaker Finals MVPs but they should realize how much energy he had to exert on both ends of the court. The impact of his defense is not going to show up so obviously in the box score and that defensive intensity absolutely would cause anyone to put up relatively weaker offensive stats due to fatigue.</p>

<p>The entire Celtics team in general put such a priority on playing defense and not focusing on just scoring which lead them to never really having that one explosive offensive game that you would expect given how strong their offense was in the regular season.</p>

      <label for="l9glw4x" class="commentText"><p>I think there were quite a few possessions on offense where they were clearly not trying to move the ball but rather drain clock, go iso, and rely on shooting variance to get them at least some points, but it also allowed them to get back on defense instantly because defending the Mavs was crucial at times.</p>
