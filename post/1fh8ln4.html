    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Fultz was the first pick in the 2017 draft snd came into the league as a Slashing playmaker but after so many injuries and time out he hasnt the same, but in <sup>2022</sup>&frasl;<sub>2023</sub> season Fultz was amazing for Orlando averaging 14 pts4 reb 5 ast and 1,4 stl but then again this year he got injured and now hes out of the league but hes only 27 and still a good PG when healthy. The Lakers could really use a backup PG or maybe the Kings but Hes a Slasher not really a shooter. Will Fultz get picked up?</p>

<p>IIRC/From what I&rsquo;ve seen Magics fans say, he did a decent job of adapting a shooting form using his legs more to offset the shoulder/upper body. But he had a few leg injuries that just threw it out the window.</p>

<p>provides no value off the ball</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So many players could massively increase their value by learning to cut off the ball.</p>

<p>Bruce Brown can barely shoot 3s, and is probably a worse ballhandler and passer than Fultz - or at most, not significantly better. Yet he made $22M last season. Largely because when his defender turns away to watch the ball, Bruce runs to the rim instead of just standing around.</p>

<p>Even crazier is that Brown was considered a guy who needed the ball in his hands, coming out of college. His off-ball movement was considered a weakness, And DET didn&rsquo;t try to develop that part of his game at all (they tried to make him into a floor general PG). Yet in BK and DEN he turned cutting into his greatest offensive strength.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no reason why Fultz can&rsquo;t do the same - other than he just doesn&rsquo;t want to.</p>

      <label for="ln80xem" class="commentText"><p>I feel like Fultz&rsquo;s body just isn&rsquo;t up to playing a full season of NBA basketball. He&rsquo;s been in the league for 7 seasons now, and has played just 234 of a possible 555 regular season games, barely half the games he&rsquo;s been eligible to play.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s a decent playmaker (28.6 AST% to 14.8 TOV% career) and defender, and an OK midrange shooter on high volume (.393 career from 10FT-3PT, consisting of 29.8% of his career FGA attempts), but doesn&rsquo;t really have a whole lot else going for him.</p>

<p>With the constant health issues and unspoken implication of having to play him 18-24mpg when healthy, to try to establish some consistency and &ldquo;get him right&rdquo;, I can see why both contenders and rebuilders might be holding their fire on signing him.</p>

      <label for="ln82qlm" class="commentText"><p>With guys like Fultz, if they&rsquo;re not a main option, it&rsquo;s hard to fit them with another non-shooter. If he&rsquo;s coming off the bench, he&rsquo;s playing with other flawed players. That makes it harder to fit a non-shooter, and it also means you probably won&rsquo;t have a lineup as equipped to benefit from his slashing.¬†</p>

<p>Take the Knicks, for example, who needed a backup PG. Even if they stagger Randle and Brunson, Randle is going to be the primary ball handler in those lineups. If Fultz is playing with Hart, Achiuwa, whatever 2 they want to play, and Randle, that&rsquo;s not enough shooting.¬†</p>

<p>Or the Suns. Even if he&rsquo;s playing with one of the big 3, let&rsquo;s say Booker. Is he really a great fit with Booker, O&rsquo;Neal, Okoge, and Plumlee or Nurkic? He&rsquo;s just clogging things up for Booker at that point.¬†</p>

<p>Philly might have been the best option, but they liked Reggie Jackson more. Beyond them, there wasn&rsquo;t a great landing spot for Fultz, Pat Bev, or Dennis Smith Jr.</p>

<p>I think he probably could have gotten the minimum if he were willing to take it. And he probably still can. But it&rsquo;s tough to find someone to give him more than that. And even at the minimum, the second apron probably locked some teams out from getting him.¬†</p>

      <label for="ln81ukk" class="commentText"><p>I reckon he&rsquo;ll get picked up, but unless someone offers him the perfect role for a year (see Tyus Jones), or substantially more than the minimum, there&rsquo;s no reason for him to rush any decision right now.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this looks like teams&rsquo; current response the new CBA. I&rsquo;m sure it balances itself out, but it looks like teams are so afraid of the 1st and 2nd Aprons, as well as the luxury tax, most teams are trying to avoid spending any extra money.</p>

<p>According to spotrac (<a href="https://www.spotrac.com/nba/cap/exceptions" target="_blank">https://www.spotrac.com/nba/cap/exceptions</a>), there&rsquo;s still a bunch of teams with exceptions remaining to offer him more than the minimum.</p>

<p>So my guess would be that his agent has a bunch of teams willing to offer the minimum, but is waiting to see if anyone bumps that up to use their exception, or part thereof. If not, then might as well just keep hanging around until training camps/pre-season to see which situations might give you more garaunteed playing time, or if a team might start to get desperate for a PG.</p>

<p>Every time someone asks this question it&rsquo;s the same answer.  Because not a single front office believes he can be a positive NBA player. Whatever upside you think you see in Fultz, no front office agrees, if they did, he&rsquo;d have a contract. Hope that answers your question.</p>

      <label for="lna1p1a" class="commentText"><p>Point guards who can&rsquo;t shoot need to be INCREDIBLE at other skills to have value. What (some) people don&rsquo;t realize is just how powerful a shooter is even when they don&rsquo;t have the ball, and therefore, how high the opportunity cost for a good team is for having a guy like Fultz out there. Let me break down what I mean by that.</p>

<p>Steph is the ultimate example of this effect; he can walk onto the court, shoot <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>15</sub>, and the other team will still give up 5-10 buckets a game from his gravity. If he&rsquo;s not shooting <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>15</sub>, the defense will need to play people who can move their feet on defense, navigate screens, and communicate. If they don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re screwed.</p>

<p>Obviously, not every player is Steph Curry, but I&rsquo;m using him as an example of the value teams get from shooters. <strong>They juice your offense just by standing around.</strong> This is even MORE valuable for role players. A player you can toss into a lineup that will give you offensive firepower and spacing is always going to have value, and they&rsquo;re going to be easier to use because of that. You&rsquo;ll naturally find situations where they have a role to play, especially because <strong>they don&rsquo;t need the ball to be effective.</strong></p>

<p>On the flip side, if you don&rsquo;t have shooting in your backcourt, that unbalances whatever you&rsquo;re trying to do on offense. The defense can afford to put two on the ball or have a free-safety-like roamer off-ball (think Draymond Green) who will just disrupt whatever you&rsquo;re trying to do. Centers can get away with this lack of shooting (sometimes) because they can act as screeners, defenders, rebounders, and rollers. They can still force someone to guard them. But a point guard? No PG is going to have a center-like impact on defense, so you&rsquo;re usually asking them to juice your offense instead through driving, passing, or shooting&ndash;ideally, all three.</p>

<p>Fultz may be able to do some of that, but this is where the opportunity cost comes in. If he&rsquo;s on the court, the only way he can give you positive net value is if he has the ball. Otherwise, he&rsquo;s a negative. He&rsquo;s not 2022 Gary Payton II, where he will absolutely clamp someone and dunk the ball on the other end. He&rsquo;s not prime Westbrook, who struggled as a shooter but got to the line 10 times a game and set up other players. He&rsquo;s not even prime Ben Simmons, who, by virtue of his height, could play a versatile role on both ends.</p>

<p>Yes, Fultz is a very serviceable backup point guard in terms of running your offense&hellip; but then you&rsquo;re forced to design lineups around him. He basically has no purpose unless your primary (and probably secondary) ball handler is on the bench. How many minutes a game does that happen? Maybe 10 at most? Most primary ball handlers are a team&rsquo;s best player and easily play 32mpg. If the team&rsquo;s best player is not a primary ball handler (Giannis, Wemby, Embiid, etc.) then you want even MORE shooting around them than usual.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s where the problem of opportunity cost really rears its head. A good team will almost certainly want a player who is more versatile than what Fultz can provide&ndash;these teams look for players who can compliment their best players in a variety of lineups, not someone who really only gives you value if your team is super injured.</p>

<p>Then, for the bad teams, the question is one of upside. Fultz basically has no further potential at this point; he is what he is. So, if you can get a young player with some sort of potential as a backup ball handler, you probably want him with the ball instead. If I was a GM, I&rsquo;d rather roll the dice on a second round pick. You&rsquo;re either gonna find someone with potential OR they&rsquo;re gonna fail, which means a higher draft pick for you. Furthermore, these bad teams usually are in desperate need of spacing anyways, and Fultz doesn&rsquo;t help there.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Fultz gives you the most value as an innings-eater during the regular season when your best ball handlers are hurt, but otherwise, he&rsquo;s probably neutral or a wash.</p>

<p>HOWEVER, there are still a few teams that are dumb enough to want to make the playoffs at all costs and aren&rsquo;t trying to grow young players. The Bulls are a classic example, but if Lavine is healthy, they already have plenty of ball handling guards. They don&rsquo;t need what Fultz offers, but he might be worth a contract if they continue to have injury issues. The Raptors might be foolish, but they already struggle enough with spacing, so they won&rsquo;t be interested&hellip; and that&rsquo;s it. I could also see maybe the Hornets giving Fultz a ring if LaMelo gets injured again, or the Wizards if they decide to move on from Poole and need someone to throw entry passes to Sarr. That&rsquo;s kinda it.</p>

<p>¬†I don&rsquo;t think the evidence exists but I saw him at the open scrimmage during pre-season and when he shot free throws I was convinced he was just clowning around. His shooting form was fucking horrendous and nothing like it was the previous year.</p>

<p>Three years in and it was an utter disappointment. He got named the starter over the current Lakers coach but only made it 15 games. If I remember correctly they eventually diagnosed thoracic outlet syndrome (which is like a nerve thing) and then I stopped paying attention.</p>

<p>Possibly the worst first overall is history, especially since we traded up in the draft and the pick we traded turned into Tatum.</p>

      <label for="ln9u404" class="commentText"><p>From what I know he‚Äôs been dealing with a condition called TOS that affects the nerves going through the clavicle area. That‚Äôs what messed up his shot where we all saw his ‚Äúshooting form‚Äù. He tried to change his shot and has had surgery to correct the condition but not sure how successful the surgery was.</p>

<p>Granted, that condition could have been caused by a motorcycle accident or some other form of trauma. It‚Äôs just sad when a player never gets to realize potential due to injuries or things out of their control.</p>

Defense is Sota‚Äôs strength, and Fultz could give them perimeter size that Conley/Dilly don‚Äôt have.</p>

<p>I know the offense would struggle, but you‚Äôd hope KAT and Ant would be able to figure out how to be average on offense.</p>

A number of players got a lot less than they were expecting and for fultz he is in a tough spot being hurt, not shooting, and still trying to develop. But he isn‚Äôt that young so‚Ä¶. Yeah no offers if he‚Äôs willing to take a minimum he probably gets something somewhere but if you‚Äôre hiring for a backup role you need some availability</p>
