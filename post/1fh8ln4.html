    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Fultz was the first pick in the 2017 draft snd came into the league as a Slashing playmaker but after so many injuries and time out he hasnt the same, but in <sup>2022</sup>&frasl;<sub>2023</sub> season Fultz was amazing for Orlando averaging 14 pts4 reb 5 ast and 1,4 stl but then again this year he got injured and now hes out of the league but hes only 27 and still a good PG when healthy. The Lakers could really use a backup PG or maybe the Kings but Hes a Slasher not really a shooter. Will Fultz get picked up?</p>

His defense is good, but not quite good enough to make up for that, right now it&rsquo;s really hard to play a non shooter when your team wants to win games and he&rsquo;s not young enough for a young team to really invest in his developpment.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a bit unfair because he&rsquo;s &ldquo;better&rdquo; then a lot of players in the league right now, but he&rsquo;s not good enough to have the ball in his hands on a lot of teams and provides no value off the ball</p>

<p>IIRC/From what I&rsquo;ve seen Magics fans say, he did a decent job of adapting a shooting form using his legs more to offset the shoulder/upper body. But he had a few leg injuries that just threw it out the window.</p>

      <label for="ln80xem" class="commentText"><p>I feel like Fultz&rsquo;s body just isn&rsquo;t up to playing a full season of NBA basketball. He&rsquo;s been in the league for 7 seasons now, and has played just 234 of a possible 555 regular season games, barely half the games he&rsquo;s been eligible to play.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s a decent playmaker (28.6 AST% to 14.8 TOV% career) and defender, and an OK midrange shooter on high volume (.393 career from 10FT-3PT, consisting of 29.8% of his career FGA attempts), but doesn&rsquo;t really have a whole lot else going for him.</p>

<p>With the constant health issues and unspoken implication of having to play him 18-24mpg when healthy, to try to establish some consistency and &ldquo;get him right&rdquo;, I can see why both contenders and rebuilders might be holding their fire on signing him.</p>

      <label for="ln82qlm" class="commentText"><p>With guys like Fultz, if they&rsquo;re not a main option, it&rsquo;s hard to fit them with another non-shooter. If he&rsquo;s coming off the bench, he&rsquo;s playing with other flawed players. That makes it harder to fit a non-shooter, and it also means you probably won&rsquo;t have a lineup as equipped to benefit from his slashing.Â </p>

<p>Take the Knicks, for example, who needed a backup PG. Even if they stagger Randle and Brunson, Randle is going to be the primary ball handler in those lineups. If Fultz is playing with Hart, Achiuwa, whatever 2 they want to play, and Randle, that&rsquo;s not enough shooting.Â </p>

<p>Or the Suns. Even if he&rsquo;s playing with one of the big 3, let&rsquo;s say Booker. Is he really a great fit with Booker, O&rsquo;Neal, Okoge, and Plumlee or Nurkic? He&rsquo;s just clogging things up for Booker at that point.Â </p>

<p>Philly might have been the best option, but they liked Reggie Jackson more. Beyond them, there wasn&rsquo;t a great landing spot for Fultz, Pat Bev, or Dennis Smith Jr.</p>

<p>I think he probably could have gotten the minimum if he were willing to take it. And he probably still can. But it&rsquo;s tough to find someone to give him more than that. And even at the minimum, the second apron probably locked some teams out from getting him.Â </p>

      <label for="ln81ukk" class="commentText"><p>I reckon he&rsquo;ll get picked up, but unless someone offers him the perfect role for a year (see Tyus Jones), or substantially more than the minimum, there&rsquo;s no reason for him to rush any decision right now.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this looks like teams&rsquo; current response the new CBA. I&rsquo;m sure it balances itself out, but it looks like teams are so afraid of the 1st and 2nd Aprons, as well as the luxury tax, most teams are trying to avoid spending any extra money.</p>

<p>According to spotrac (<a href="https://www.spotrac.com/nba/cap/exceptions" target="_blank">https://www.spotrac.com/nba/cap/exceptions</a>), there&rsquo;s still a bunch of teams with exceptions remaining to offer him more than the minimum.</p>

<p>So my guess would be that his agent has a bunch of teams willing to offer the minimum, but is waiting to see if anyone bumps that up to use their exception, or part thereof. If not, then might as well just keep hanging around until training camps/pre-season to see which situations might give you more garaunteed playing time, or if a team might start to get desperate for a PG.</p>

<p>Every time someone asks this question it&rsquo;s the same answer.  Because not a single front office believes he can be a positive NBA player. Whatever upside you think you see in Fultz, no front office agrees, if they did, he&rsquo;d have a contract. Hope that answers your question.</p>

I think somebody should pick him up, but the likelihood that he blooms into a solid vet would require a multi-year commitment from a team which can probably give that resource to a younger player with a higher upside.  I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve seen all of him, though.  The question is, who would he be a replacement for on a team?</p>

      <label for="ln8y5u8" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s was a pretty common conspiracy theory among Sixers fans that he was in a motorcycle/off-roading accident the summer before his rookie year. As this would likely void (or impact) his contract he hid this from the team.</p>

<p>Â I don&rsquo;t think the evidence exists but I saw him at the open scrimmage during pre-season and when he shot free throws I was convinced he was just clowning around. His shooting form was fucking horrendous and nothing like it was the previous year.</p>

<p>Three years in and it was an utter disappointment. He got named the starter over the current Lakers coach but only made it 15 games. If I remember correctly they eventually diagnosed thoracic outlet syndrome (which is like a nerve thing) and then I stopped paying attention.</p>

<p>Possibly the worst first overall is history, especially since we traded up in the draft and the pick we traded turned into Tatum.</p>

      <label for="ln8j20o" class="commentText"><p>The league has shifted the last few years to fielding studs or developing dudes. The middle ground players are weeded out. There are less veterans or just okay dudes on non competing teams.</p>

<p>At this point Markelle is what he is. Sure heâ€™s better than a lot of dudes in the NBA, but he doesnâ€™t fit in any role player prototype and isnâ€™t going to develop into a superstar. He might make a bad team better by being on it, but he will never fix the underlying issues.</p>

      <label for="ln8l6h4" class="commentText"><p>If heâ€™s going with minimum offers, I think decent teams he could get minutes are Suns, Lakers, Spurs, Grizzlies, Bucks, Heat, but the one I like the most is Minnesota. Defense is Sotaâ€™s strength, and Fultz could give them perimeter size that Conley/Dilly donâ€™t have.</p>

<p>I know the offense would struggle, but youâ€™d hope KAT and Ant would be able to figure out how to be average on offense.</p>

<p>Also he has played long enough that we&rsquo;re pretty sure he won&rsquo;t ever be a good 3PT shooter</p>
