<p>I&rsquo;ve always maintained that Steph Curry is incredible when he&rsquo;s on fire, but hot-Klay Thompson is orders of magnitude more ridiculous.</p>

<p>That 37 point quarter, you could see him just throwing the ball at the hoop daring it to miss, and he couldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Thank you Alvin Gentry for not calling a timeout and enabling us to witness this feat.</p>

<p>• assisted Love on a couple early shots to get him going</p>

<p>• can be seen enthusiastically giving Love a congratulatory bump after he&rsquo;d started 4 of 4</p>

<p>• can also be seen directing Tristan Thompson to set a screen for Love for his 6th consecutive made basket</p>

<p>• did, in fact, find Love a couple times late in the quarter, both instances leading to points for Love <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6LZT98khi0&amp;t=156s" target="_blank">[1]</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6LZT98khi0&amp;t=184s" target="_blank">[2]</a> but neither showing up in Kyrie&rsquo;s stat sheet</p>

<p>• instead of just isoing or whatever, there are a few instances where in the middle of this extravaganza, he &ldquo;ran the offense&rdquo; / deferred to LeBron who then passed to Love on multiple occasions&ndash; including one that looked like a set play to get Love a look and keep him going</p>

<p>• received applause from Love in his post game interview for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6LZT98khi0&amp;t=310s" target="_blank">&ldquo;finding him all over the court&rdquo;</a></p>

At the end of his C&rsquo;s tenure he was pushed to more of a catch and shoot position because Rondo reached his peak and everything on offense ran through him at that point in Boston&rsquo;s Big 3 at that point.</p>

      <label for="ljbi9zw" class="commentText"><p>But part of the point was that he wasn&rsquo;t diminished for that. The issue that Bosh and Love had, that Allen didn&rsquo;t, was that they didn&rsquo;t already have a full Hall of Fame career behind them by the time they were traded. Allen had played 11 years, made 7 All Star games, had a few all NBA teams and a top 10 MVP finish.</p>

      <label for="ljauuta" class="commentText"><p>Kevin Love and Bosh were both top 3 PFs in the NBA before teaming up with Bron. They had to sacrifice most of their games because Bron, Wade, and Kyrie were arguably the best drivers in the NBA. Those guys need the lane clear to work so it was a huge adjustment for both Bosh and K.Love. I understand why they both said it was so difficult. They never had to do that before in their lives.</p>

<p>Are we really about to sit here and act like these guys aren’t happy they won a Ring instead of padding stats on dog water teams? And I’m not saying you were saying that. Just wanted to reply to a comment. I agree with your overall point and it was obviously a hard a adjustment for both, but teams that win Rings always have players that have to sacrifice because that’s how the NBA works</p>

      <label for="ljb3exg" class="commentText"><p>What Bosh did for the Heatles was anchor the best defensive team of all time in my opinion. I know this sounds like an over exaggeration but I&rsquo;ll defend it.</p>

<p>When they turned it on in the 4th, they were unbeatable. So many games those seasons they headed into the 4th down 10, but everyone knew when they snapped their fingers they&rsquo;d go on a run and win the game.</p>

<p>They played a style of basketball that has not been played in the NBA since. They would trap everything. Every single player on that team was a very good defender. Mario, Cole, Battier, LeBron, Wade, Bosh, they were all good and mobile defenders. The opposition had trouble just getting the ball up the court without it being yet another turnover. Teams couldn&rsquo;t set up in the half court. Switching was very hard against them.</p>

<p>The Heat&rsquo;s bread and butter was the transition. They scored so many points off turnovers. A Wade outlet quarterback pass to a galloping LeBron. There were many keys to making this possible, it was a team effort, but Bosh really enabled it with the stretch-4. He was the stretch-4 archetype. The first big-3 season together in Miami Bosh had trouble finding his place on the team. They couldn&rsquo;t have him clogging the paint so he just kind of had to live out in the corner at the 3p line. He&rsquo;s come out and said that first year was very hard for him. He did eventually accept his place though and found the right spot by the 2nd season.</p>

<p>I could go on and on about this team&rsquo;s defense, it was so incredible to watch. Seeing them go on that 27-game win streak when they were down by 10 going into the 4th every single game, then flipping the switch and just destroying everything was something else.</p>

<p>They were a very good defensive team, but this team had a size/rebounding issue that teams exploited and even Roy Hibbert averaged 22 on 55% shooting against them in a playoff series.</p>

<p>They are not close to this title, even if they were a good transition defensive team. You can&rsquo;t be that poor at rebounding and be the best defensive team ever.</p>

<p>They were however, one of the best offensive teams ever for sure and regularly ignited that offense off turnovers. But Bosh being in the middle meant for a very weak front court, that regularly got pounded in defensively. They had to be hyper vigilant on the wings to make up for it.</p>

<p>Front court defense was the weakest aspect of their team.</p>

<p>LeBron uses his passive aggressiveness to manipulate the FO or his teammates. You don’t have to be a hater to realize this (I am a Bronsexual). It’s honestly his worst trait as a person that I’m not a fan of.</p>

Less enjoyed but def max respect from MJ&rsquo;s team to him, with a lot saying his leadership put them over the edge, during their championships.  They each famously reigned in explosive personalities in Artest and Rodman</p>

<p>Lebron&rsquo;s works for him.  Different leadership styles work.  Different leadership styles work with different people.  This taking sides stuff on which is better is stupid</p>

      <label for="ljbbz2p" class="commentText"><p>It’s so funny digging into his playoff stats</p>

<p>What some people dont realize is that he got <em>plenty</em> of postup opportunities</p>

<ul>
<li>Love had the 7th most post up possessions per game in the 2016 playoffs, producing 0.81 points per possession (44th percentile)</li>
<li>Love had the most post up possessions per game in the 2017 playoffs, producing 0.98 points per possession (68th percentile)</li>
<li>Love had the 6th most post up possessions per game in the 2018 playoffs, producing 0.80 points per possession (31st percentile)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is bad offense.</p>

<p>You know what was not bad offense?</p>

<p>In the 2016 playoffs, Love produced 1.18 points per possession on spot up possessions. 1.15 in the 2017 playoffs. 1.00 in the 2018 playoffs.</p>

<p>To the detriment of the team, Kevin Love got a healthy dose of post ups. It did not work, so the team went with what was more effective. Somehow that gets spun into a LeBron criticism lol</p>

<p>Look at how he played in Minnesota, then watch his post ups in Cleveland. They simply weren&rsquo;t the same at all.</p>

<p>Changing his game extended his career.  I think injuries could’ve made things different for him in that Cleveland offense, but he was always going to be the 3rd option with LeBron and Kyrie there.</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s probably part of the issue. LeBron was basically a global superstar before he even became an adult. Under those circumstances, I just sincerely doubt that you&rsquo;ll mature like the rest of us <em>&ldquo;ordinary&rdquo;</em> people do because you&rsquo;re living in this sort of bubble. So it would come as absolutely no surprise to me if he still handles shit now like he did when he was 17. Because why not, that&rsquo;s probably the way he&rsquo;s always done it, and just who the hell is going to tell him off? Only a few people have the guts, gravitas, confidence, and backing to do that. Probably Spo and Pop for example.</p>

      <label for="ljbl3qb" class="commentText"><p>It is 100% guaranteed and deserved that he has his number retired for us. It’s not even close. He was in Cleveland for nearly a decade and was the third best player on a championship team and two finals teams, plus second best on another finals team. He’s pretty high on a bunch of all time team record lists. He’s second in 3s made. Third in defensive rebounds and sixth in total rebounds. Ninth in points. And as many are pointing out, he sacrificed a lot without complaint to make the team work. We still love him and his reception every time he comes back to Cleveland shows it. It is honestly pretty frustrating that a rift with JB (over not playing him when Miami clearly showed he still could) has led to him finishing his career elsewhere. And in general he has a super positive community legacy with all the mental health awareness stuff. He’s still our guy.</p>

<p>Side note, a look at Cavs all time records shows that Big Z was an absolutely amazing player who has sort of been forgotten by his story. Pretty much any franchise record LeBron doesn’t own belongs to Z (Although Mitchell is actually edging LeBron right now for the ppg record.).</p>

      <label for="ljaw7hp" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s funny that the timing of this clip is the same as the interview with Jeremy Lin talking about how Kobe was an ass and didn&rsquo;t talk to him for four months. I think guys like Kobe/Lebron, but really all guys who have to lead their teams more than most athletes-guys like them, Brady, Steve Nash, and of course head coaches-they all have their philosophy on what kind of leadership style they want to take. And they&rsquo;ve all experienced really high levels of success, so they go with what works. I&rsquo;m sure Brady/Kobe/Lebron know sometimes they&rsquo;re straight up assholes, but they also know sometimes that&rsquo;s the price of success and they&rsquo;re willing to pay it.</p>

<p>The thing is, there are other ways that work too. And sometimes they know but it doesn&rsquo;t work in the context of their personality, sometimes they don&rsquo;t think a nicer approach will work at all.</p>

<p>That said, might be an unpopular opinion here but to win at that kind of level is so difficult that I do think the ends justifies the means. Winning in professional sports leagues is like business, you do whatever is right for the organization and don&rsquo;t worry about people&rsquo;s feelings. Reddit will hate me saying that, but I never get angry with work for doing what&rsquo;s best for the business-if someone comes along offering me significantly more money to work somewhere else tomorrow, all things equal, I&rsquo;m gone today. It goes both ways and that&rsquo;s fine. Kobe and Lebron might be assholes but they&rsquo;re definitely doing what they think will help winning.</p>

<p>edit: in response to &lsquo;Am I a bad person?&rsquo; comment. It sucks that society now only knows how to idolize or demonize, with nothing in between, because it leads to a great point. I&rsquo;m always reminded of how Kobe talked about how what made him great was also a weakness. He talked about how he was tough on people,  but moreover, he became great at basketball and he won championships because he was so focused on it. He talked about how he had people who he could talk to who understood what he was going through-he mentioned I think CP, Wade, Lebron-and he could go to for advice or as a sounding board, but he didn&rsquo;t have any friends. He didn&rsquo;t call his friends to just say hi and they knew not to call him if they didn&rsquo;t have something specific to talk about. The same things that drove his greatness were weaknesses too, and he was super open about that. But Kobe also pointed out that what makes a person average at everything was a weakness too, and the things that make a person not good at anything is a weakness too. In the end it&rsquo;s more of a spectrum than anything of how you want to allocate your weaknesses as much as what it is you want to pursue. Kobe had super high self awareness that he was an asshole sometimes and that his life was not balanced. Everyone&rsquo;s going to see it differently and that&rsquo;s fine, I just happen to agree with him that most things and most people, it&rsquo;s all about tradeoffs and most strengths are also weaknesses in either the cost to acquire that strength or if the strength is viewed in a different context. To me the best we can do is have a high self awareness about it, make a choice we can live with and doesn&rsquo;t sell us short on our own potential, see where that road starts to lead us, and reassess periodically to make sure we&rsquo;re still living our best life. A lot of the time, life just comes down to the sacrifices we&rsquo;re willing or unwilling to make to become who we want to be.</p>

<p>I could see him doing and saying things out of immaturity that he likely now regrets.</p>

<p>Contrasting this story to the one I heard just recently with D&rsquo;lo feeling responsible for when the Lakers lost to the Nuggets and LeBron hugging him and telling him that &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok. This is basketball.&rdquo; is indicative of his growth as a leader and likely a person.</p>

      <label for="ljaycqr" class="commentText"><p>Tbh I think the fact that Bron has already won 4 times and is probably counting down the years until he retires has done a lot for him.  I think when players realize they’re almost done they just become more carefree.  Bron is in the unique position of still being on a team that’s ostensibly a contender (unlike MJ and Kobe in their last years), but I still think he’s at a stage where he can separate the game from himself.  He can give it his all on the court while still acknowledging that it’s just a game.</p>

Though one thing that I always found frustrating about him, is how much of a pushover he was in the defensive post. It was especially frustrating, considering he was far more willing to throw his weight around when he was in the offensive post.</p>
