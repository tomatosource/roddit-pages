<p>The reason why Pascal Siakam refused to be traded to the Kings, who were extremely interested, was due to past comments made by their front office about his game, per @sam_amick (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgezCuPk3d0&amp;t=642s&amp;pp=2AGCBZACAQ%3D%3D):" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgezCuPk3d0&amp;t=642s&amp;pp=2AGCBZACAQ%3D%3D):</a></p>

<p>“The way it was framed to me — in an attempt to drive down what it would take to get him — some gossipy-type feedback on his game had gotten back to him.”</p>

<p>Sacramento and the Pacers were the two teams most interested in acquiring Siakam before being traded away from the Raptors.</p>

<p>What do you guys think? I don’t know much about Amick but I think The Athletic does some good work so who knows.</p>

      <label for="l9i7qq7" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m more inclined to believe he wasn&rsquo;t traded to the Kings for the obvious reason that they didn&rsquo;t have shit to trade for him if Keegan wasn&rsquo;t on the table.  The Raptors have to agree to trade him there and what they had at the table was even less appealing than Bruce Brown and some weak firsts.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re literally using the same offer they had on the table for Pascal and no one&rsquo;s biting for a reason (Huerter, Barnes, a pick though presumably they&rsquo;re now offering 13 in this draft instead of some unknown compensation from 28 or beyond)</p>

<p>Kings didn&rsquo;t have the goods, so instead of trying to somehow sweeten the offer, they shit talked Siakam to try driving the price down.</p>

      <label for="l9i8vfz" class="commentText"><p>I mean they literally were having conversations when the Raptors were in Sacramento and then suddenly the talks were off. They were pretty far down the road and then something happened. </p>

<p>As far as not getting anyone to bite with the same offer now, you’re not going to see any trades until the draft so it’s a wait and see on what that trade offer gets you, especially if the picks are on the table. I’m skeptical as to the type of player you can get with that trade package but we’ll see. </p>

      <label for="l9ikw3u" class="commentText"><p>Didn&rsquo;t Siakam also leak in the lead-up to his trade that there was no guarantee he&rsquo;d sign with the Kings long-term if traded there? I remember I was following closely bc I&rsquo;m a Pacers fan and we wanted him. It raised my eyebrows bc it seemed like it meant he may not sign with the Pacers either. Now this makes more sense. He was offended by the Kings in particular and wanted to discourage being traded there. Since coming to Indiana, he&rsquo;s been super optimistic about staying. It seemed like a big 180. He is also the first player to indicate willing to sign internally this off-season, <em>and</em> he agreed to take almost 50 mill less than what he could have.</p>

<p>All this put together, it seems like he really didn&rsquo;t like their FO and is really happy in Indiana.</p>

Finding a 4-man who can shoot, guard the perimeter, <em>and</em> rim-protect to cover up Domas’ deficiencies. Myles Turner was somewhat of an approximation but ultimately he’s a 5, just like Sabonis is.</p>

Both can play D (tho that’s optional in Indy’s current style), Turner can shoot 3s and Siakam thrives as a secondary playmaker working both on the perimeter and inside.</p>

      <label for="l9igvg6" class="commentText"><p>I have historically been very critical of Pascal (mostly as a first option) but it’s really undeniable that he is a top 30 player in the league and those guys get paid the max.</p>

<p>I personally feel like what Pacers did was a straight robbery. They gave up nothing for someone that can definitely be top 3 on a championship team.</p>

<p>Now I know <span class="math inline">\(50M might sound crazy, but the cap is projected to reach \)</span>200M in 4-5 years, so what used to be <span class="math inline">\(25M contract 5 years ago, is now \)</span>50M.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t really worry about his longevity. In terms of play style, he is somewhat DeRozan 2.0 so I expect him to have good longevity as long as there isn’t a career altering/ending injury.</p>

<p>Siakam probably can sign another decent contract even after his current contract with Pacers expire.</p>

      <label for="l9il91v" class="commentText"><p>I think he got a surgery over summer a few years ago and missed 20ish games at the beginning of the season, but outside of that he hasn’t really had any injury that I can think of.</p>

<p>His game these days is mostly midrange shots. He doesn’t rely on speed or power to score.</p>

<p>I personally think Pascal can maintain his level until 36ish at least.</p>

<p>Concerns over his new contract not aging well are really overblown.</p>

      <label for="l9ilret" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I absolutely love his fit here. I think his game will age extremely well. If anything, once he gets some chemistry with the guys it&rsquo;s just going to get better.</p>

<p>You also nailed it. People saying he&rsquo;s not a max player are crazy. I also love what the Pacers are doing - a 4 year max gives you the flexibility to extend him later (which would be great for him), or to trade him/let his contract expire if Mathurin/Jarace end up developing enough to command a hefty paycheck. Absolutely brilliant FO moves, and it (hopefully) keeps everyone happy.</p>

      <label for="l9io09k" class="commentText"><p>Do you think championship cores are built over night?</p>

<p>Maybe in LA, but a team like Pacers needs to incrementally build.</p>

<p>I would say their current iteration is a success if they are a perennial 50+ wins team that can make it to semi-finals. I think they are already close to that level (they just made ECF).</p>

<p>Hali is only 24 so there is room for improvement there. And they have a lot of other prospects that can either improved or be used as trade assets.</p>

<p>They can even trade Siakam and some of those assets for a bigger fish.</p>

<p>I think Pacers are in a great position. They remind of Lowry/DeRozan Raptors. Sure, they didn’t win it all, but that was the basis of a championship team.</p>

Plus, no offense to Kings&rsquo; fans, but the Pacers front office has done wonders and seen a rather quick turnaround there, while the Kings consistently add talent, but can never seem to truly take big steps forward.</p>

      <label for="l9ih0y3" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s very cool, congrats to them. Like I said, they consistently add talent, but you haven&rsquo;t made it out of the first round in 20 years, and have only made the playoffs once in the last what, 18 years? And I&rsquo;m not trying to trash on the Kings or anything, but I think an period of lack of success that is over twice as long as Siakam&rsquo;s entire career is a valid reason for him not to want to go there.</p>

      <label for="l9imki9" class="commentText"><p>Kings get a lot of flack unnecessarily. I think you guys made some very solid moves getting Sabonis and drafting Murray. Plus, Fox is a bucket.</p>

<p>With that said, I think (as a biased fan) what the Pacers did is more impressive. We went from being a lottery team the past 2 years, to getting our two highest draft picks in over 30 years, to improving from 25 wins -&amp;gt; 35 wins ‐&amp;gt; 47 wins and an ECF appearance in the last 3 seasons. And acquiring a legit 2nd star to pair with Haliburton. Plus, those two lottery picks basically didn&rsquo;t even play in the playoffs this year. The path to success is a bit more linear for us right now (so far).</p>

      <label for="l9iokv0" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I think so, especially in the East. Siakam definitely brought you over the hump and while I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll require a move of that magnitude to get there, Monte standing pat last season basically doomed us to similar results. So the moves he makes this summer are really going to determine our fate</p>

He has a lead role with a young Indy team, made ecf, and also getting his money. So it all worked out well for him. And Masai get to say they took care of another former star players</p>

      <label for="l9inewv" class="commentText"><p>I mean kinda. The top 10 in the west are very good. But so are the top 8 in the East. It&rsquo;s just the bottom of the East that is weak.</p>

<p>For example, Pacers were 6th in the East but absolutely blew out Dallas twice right before the end of the regular season. They also had the 4th best net rating in the league since the ASB and the 4th best record in the league against teams above 0.500. That&rsquo;s the 6th seed. NY had a net rating almost as good as Boston when OG and Brunson played together. They would have thrashed almost every team in the West. Add a healthy 76ers, Bucks, or Heat team and and those guys could win against pretty much any Western Conference team.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s more parity in the league than people realize. It&rsquo;s just that the bottom tier teams in the East are horrible.</p>
