<p>Go try to say Babe Ruth played against plumbers in an MLB forum, or that Walter Payton couldn&rsquo;t play the game today in an NFL forum, or that Pele didn&rsquo;t completely transform the game in a soccer forum, or that Dan Bradman domination wasn&rsquo;t undeniable in a cricket forum, or anything degrading about Gretzky in a hockey forum, or anything like that, and you&rsquo;ll get laughed out of the room.</p>

<p>Oh, and somehow, coincidentally, despite how much this sub likes to chant that tv ratings don&rsquo;t matter because nobody watches tv anymore, NBA is the only major sport that has seen its tv ratings steadily fall rather than rise.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that Pele didn’t completely <em>transform</em> the game</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is where the discrepancy comes in. Absolutely no one denies the impact anyone from the past had on the game. There’s just a distinct difference between how important and influential someone was vs how good they actually were relative to people playing today.</p>

<p>But to be a little more serious, the debates always get silly pretty quickly. If you could abduct a player from a point in time in past decades and drop them into any sport today they’ll probably look slow and unathletic. But if you took them as baby, raised them up with the same kind of training, nutrition, strength training and development? Well . .  . it’s still an impossible, unprovable hypothetical.</p>

<p>Remember this is .001% of humanity in terms of both genetic gift, determination, sacrifice etc.</p>

<p>There are a lot of g league guys that have comparable or even above average athletic tools. But u need to be elite overall in almost every case to make it to the league, let alone dominate.</p>

<p>Average player from back then to average player now are probably slightly less skilled, athletic and def less creative offense/defense. But like take dr j. He would still be in that lebron, mj, russ, ja etc outlier athleticism. Its not like most dudes can dunk from ft line now.</p>

But it’s a lot harder to quantify skill outliers. Guys like Ted Williams or Jerry West were monsters, not necessarily because of their .001 percentile athleticism, but because .001 skill and mindset. Would it translate now? Maybe, maybe not, but I wouldn’t bet against it (in this totally unprovable hypothetical).</p>

      <label for="lj2huw9" class="commentText"><p>In chess, it has been said that you cannot compare players of different era. The current players are always stronger than ones of the past. Why? Because the current players learned from those past players. The only way you can compare players of different eras is by the gap between them and their competition. If someone in history absolutely dicked their competition, would they do the same in modern day? You can absolutely argue that.</p>

      <label for="lj1u2ju" class="commentText"><p>Hockey definitely has its 80s detractors with its high scoring era, which gets balanced out a bit with boosting 90s/00s players playing in a low scoring era. Gretzky is untouchable because his numbers are so far ahead his own era and every other era that we struggle to reach those heights in video games. There’s a discussion to be had for GOAT status in the NBA leading to disparaging eras. Any NHL GOAT discussion has to rely on hypotheticals (what if X wasn’t injury plagued) because Gretzky was so dominant it can dismiss any eras argument</p>

<p>Imagine Prime Wilt Chamberlain playing in the 2000s against Shaq. Maybe we wouldn’t be calling Shaq the most dominant player of all time. In fact I’m certain of.</p>

<p>If there was a 7 foot athlete as big and strong as Wilt today… like he would make Giannis look tiny.</p>

      <label for="lj2nzag" class="commentText"><p>The difference is that in the NFL not every team plays all the other teams in the league every season, so some match ups can have multi-year breaks, making the actual games more memorable and special, plus they play only 17 games per season.</p>

<p>I guess with the NBA you could do great games on special days like Christmas, Thanksgiving, MLK day or Playoffs games.</p>

Sure, your favorite team is losing, but your WR1 is putting up 30 points, so maybe it&rsquo;s okay lol.  And now with gambling, yeah, now money is on the line.  Fantasy is usually for money, too.</p>

<p>T-Mac&rsquo;s legacy is pretty lackluster as far as the greatest players of all time, but he has supreme talent.</p>

<p>Or even Durant himself. Larry&rsquo;s legacy is a lot better imo but I think Durant is just a better player.</p>

      <label for="lj26bdl" class="commentText"><p>It’s crazy how it works sometimes, Luka just turned 25 a few months ago and he already has voter fatigue for an MVP that he’s never gotten and people talk about him like the stuff he does is old news and expected of him while people still talk about SGA as a new and upcoming superstar even though he’s older than Luka and the same age as Tatum. I forget who it was but I was watching a video from a pretty big NBA channel or podcast going over expectations for next year and they said something basically along the lines of “SGA and Wemby who are both kind of babies (in terms of experience)” and I was like ???</p>

<p>This is not me hating on SGA but it’s just weird</p>

      <label for="lj2wf2b" class="commentText"><p>It’s just different these days (I’m 40).  There used to be a set pattern to the star players. You see the talent and athleticism the first 2-3 years. Then you see them starting putting it together with BBIQ and some playoffs taste. Then they hit their prime 28-32 where they do the bulk of the winning.</p>

<p>Now we have guys like Luka that are 19 and immediately skilled and great so by the time they hit what supposed to be that middle stage, weve already been talking about them for 5 years and they’ve been in the playoffs so it feels like old news.</p>

<p>Now specifically with Ant, in the grand scheme of things he hasn’t done anything. So he’s just the lovable goof. When he starts knocking on the door of MVPs and finals appearances and has expectations, some of the shit he says won’t just be blown over as easily. We always build these guys up and then tear them down for the same things we loved once they finally reach the potential we all had for them. Then of course we love a comeback story too after the tear down.</p>

By the time you&rsquo;re 27, the general NBA fanbase and media expects you to already have accomplished something, Finals appearances, MVPs, legacy Playoffs performances, etc. Once you&rsquo;re 27, you&rsquo;re not cute any more, you&rsquo;re expected to deliver greatness when you&rsquo;re of Ant&rsquo;s calibre and have his ceiling.</p>

<p>Ant has a lot of league fans who want him to be the next Kobe, MJ, face of the league and I agree people will defend him for a while.</p>

<p>As opposed to someone like Jokic who had to prove to us under multiple scenarios like “ok cool wcf, but what about a title” type stuff.</p>

      <label for="lj2qej4" class="commentText"><p>Because Jokić is everything the mainstream NBA fanbase didn&rsquo;t care about. He&rsquo;s not from the US, wasn&rsquo;t a high draft pick, doesn&rsquo;t look athletic and isn&rsquo;t explosively athletic in the process, he doesn&rsquo;t like being loud or outspoken, and he&rsquo;s white (not a racist take, it&rsquo;s just a known fact that the mainstream media will promote black American players more than white foreigners).</p>

<p>And Anthony Edwards is the exact opposite. A young, black, American, fun kid, charismatic, very athletic, can jump on top of the backboard and he likes being outspoken, he likes to talk trash and create buzz. If anyone will be crowned the face of the league within the next few years, I think it will be him and good for him, more power to him.</p>

He was beloved in 2021, but by the end of last season the media really turned on him and he&rsquo;s often a complete afterthought in the MVP discussions despite having had a historical year. Edwards will experience the same.</p>

      <label for="lj1julb" class="commentText"><p>In the MLB it&rsquo;s really easy to track the improvements to pitching. Increases in speed and ball movement have gone up tremendously in just the last 2 decades. The Olympics have also shown a general improvement to human speed, strength, skill.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to take this data and say that older generations couldn&rsquo;t hang but improvements have mostly been external. What I mean by that is most improvements aren&rsquo;t humans being genetically different or them working harder but improvements are mostly better equipment, medicine, training. If you took an athlete from 30 years ago and put them in today&rsquo;s environment they could quickly acclimate. With that said you can&rsquo;t really deny the advancements and say the athletes from previous generations are better.</p>

You have to be even better to go pro. Much better training now - better understanding all around of running efficient plays, moves, etc. Better training programs. Vods / analytics / monitoring. Even just funding. We&rsquo;ve seen salaries go up massively, a chunk of that is being fed back into the ecosystem.</p>

<p>It would be braindead to argue that average skill level / training is not higher today.</p>

Olympic sprinting is purely improving yourself. In basketball you gotta take what the opponent is giving you, and previous era exploits get patched up over time as coaches develop schemes to shut them down. You can’t really track how Wilt can adjust vs today’s defensive schemes when he never had to think about how to beat today’s defensive schemes</p>

      <label for="lj1quxc" class="commentText"><p>individual players are much more impactful in basketball than football. This leads to people being fans of players themselves just as much (if not more) than the teams, hence the constant GOAT debate drivel. If you’re arguing that MJ is the GOAT, you also need to hype up the rest of the league he was playing against otherwise you end up in the “Wilt played against milkmen” dimension.</p>

<p>tl;dr the average NBA player nowadays is way more talented than 30 years ago, but that doesn’t invalidate past success in the league.</p>

      <label for="lj1kers" class="commentText"><p>yes objectively athethes are better now than they were 30 years ago, but that doesnt mean that players 30 years ago werent extremely skilled. If michael jordan or maradona played today with all the extra techonology, nutrition knowledge, training conditions, etc. they would be at the top aswell. Thats why its hard to compare eras but the skill was always there.</p>

      <label for="lj1uwkn" class="commentText"><p>What?</p>

<p>People disrespect Pele all the time.</p>

<p>In football no one would argue that Joe Montana was better than Brady, Mahomes, Manning, Rodgers, etc. He might have been greater than some but he can’t compare to modern QBs. The only old QB that can is Dan Marino and that’s because he was so ahead of his time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in basketball if someone says that today’s basketball players are better than the 80s and 90s you’d get a bunch of old heads going at your throat for not respecting their “legends”.</p>

<p>Can you argue that Michael, Magic, Larry, etc are greater than a bunch of players from today? Sure.</p>

<p>Can you with a straight face say that they’re better than the current best players? Not a freaking chance and yet people legitimately argue that Michael is better than Bron (not greater but better), that Larry is better than KD, that Magic is better than Steph, etc.</p>

<p>That’s why those of us that aren’t nostalgia merchants push back from than ridiculous narrative.</p>

      <label for="lj1qoaq" class="commentText"><p>To prove Ant&rsquo;s lack of understanding the subject, im gonna draw some names of people who played in the MJ era:</p>

<p>Clyde Drexler. With his skill-set, and his body, he would be one of the best players in today&rsquo;s league. Chris Middleton enhanced version</p>

<p>Prime Kemp. With his skill and body, he would be 1.5x what Aaron Gordon is today. Which is basically an unstoppable PF</p>

<p>Karl Malone. Im truly interested what would Ant suggest for his Wolves team, to stop this dude ? <a href="https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-763ab73cb1d990c011f941d58044db14-lq" target="_blank">Just a reminder</a> that Mailman looked like this, while having unguardable jumper from midrange.</p>

<p>There is a big gap in quality that happened sometime when the League became heavily commercialized and lots of money involved. And it happened late 70s - mid 80s. Players in early 70s are, indeed, hard to compare to a modern player. But once NBA entered 90s, pretty much only medicine and diet improved in todays game, which gave players longer durability and less injuries. Saying that mid 90s player didnt have skill is like saying that average rated boxer of today easily beats <a href="https://youtu.be/dLiJXS-qgMg?t=39" target="_blank">prime Mike Tyson</a>.</p>

      <label for="lj1tkil" class="commentText"><p>There’s quite a few 90’s players that are unfairly underrated now simply because they couldn’t get past Jordan.</p>

<p>For example, Barkley was an absolute beast in the Finals against the Bulls (his career as a whole too) but because they lost (mostly due to that Jordan fella) he’s not higher up on all time lists.</p>

<p>Imagine if they win and he has the same performance/stats? Is he considered top 20? 15?</p>

      <label for="lj245ur" class="commentText"><p>Barkley would be sniffing top 10 with that win. He’d be one of like 9 players to win MVP and FMVP in the same season. Obviously some didn’t win the same season and may be better. But you’re right he was a beast and was only held back by his bad shooting. Otherwise he was very much a modern player with his ability to do everything. Love his fast break highlights where he gets the board and takes it all the way.  </p>

We just play AAU ball and try to make crazy highlight reals while they are working on their basketball skills thoroughly and building chemistry by playing with the same teammates all the way up. So many American players fail nowadays because they can’t play simple basketball, can’t screen properly, is a ball stopper in the half court offense, cutting instead of just standing in the corner for 24 seconds, proper boxing out techniques. Majority of big men in the league from America can’t even post up against a NBA big, they just stand outside and launch threes now</p>

<p>I’m an MJ guy through and through but I heavily dislike the idea that he didn’t have competition in the 90’s.</p>

<p>There’s quite a few phenomenal players from that time period that are unfairly dismissed/diminished simply because they couldn’t beat the Bulls.</p>
