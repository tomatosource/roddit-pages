      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dh45m2/fellow_european_fans_whats_your_experience_with/"><p>Fellow European fans, what‚Äôs your experience with the time zone issue?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>So when picking a team, I was advised to pick an eastern conference team if I want to be able to watch games live and not at 4am.</p>

<p>New York and Toronto for instance are 5 hours behind London. San Antonio and Minnesota on the other hand are 6 hours behind London so it‚Äôs not much a difference.</p>

<p>Another thing is, during the regular season the teams travel to each others cities so when the Knicks travel to face the clippers for instance, wouldn‚Äôt that game be played in the west coast time zone (8 hours behind London)?</p>

<p>Point being, no matter which conference team you pick, there will be games that you won‚Äôt be able to watch unless you wanna stay up til/ wake up at 4am right?</p>

<p>I guess it makes sense in the playoffs as eastern conference games will be played at a more reasonable time but if I wanted to watch the twolves, I would be able to watch games against the suns for instance on our home court at a reasonable time and have to stay up late or miss the games played in pheonix?</p>

<p>Is that how it works? Because I‚Äôve been trying to follow an eastern conference team for a while but I‚Äôm not really feeling any of them, I would rather just stick with the twolves if I ever get to see them play at a reasonable time like if they travel to the east coast or play someone in the same time zone and just miss the games they play against west coast teams</p>

      <label for="l8ud159" class="commentText"><p>Bro honestly, I&rsquo;d just pick a team that I like instead of considering timezones or something like that. Realistically, whatever you pick, you won&rsquo;t be able to watch them play every game at normal times live, especially in the playoffs. At least this way you just watch something you like.</p>

<p>What I do especially in the playoffs where I try to not miss much, is that I avoid the score of the game I want to watch even if it means not checking social media, reddit, sports apps, news, or whatever until I watch it, then I watch the game not knowing what happens. I usually watch it early in the morning when I wake up, so it&rsquo;s not hard to avoid checking stuff until that time. The experience is practically the same, imo definitely better than watching it live.  You can skip to game time, skip ads, skip timeouts or halftime break, whatever as well so its more efficient. Similar to watching live, you have no idea what will happen, it&rsquo;s easier to get excited during the game like you don&rsquo;t know if the 20 point lead is going to go down to 1 but then the Celtics will win by 7 anyway. It&rsquo;s the best method, if your country has like a service that allows you to watch games back.</p>

      <label for="l8uc1x1" class="commentText"><p>I find the better way to watch is by avoiding the score at all costs so no reddit or sports and news apps before watching it, especially in playoff series, and watch it without knowing what will happen. I just find it hard to get into games when I know the score. This way, it feels like you are watching live where anything could happen like the 20 point lead coming down to 1 point in the Dallas-Boston series was hype, but it would be hard to get excited if I knew that Boston would win by like 7 anyway. This is arguably better than watching it live for me since I can just skip to when the game actually starts, skip the ads or timeouts, etc.</p>

      <label for="l8ubgm8" class="commentText"><p>I live 6 hours apart from the east coast, there are no reasonable hours because it&rsquo;s not about when it starts, it&rsquo;s about when it ends. Also, when the game ends your adrenaline is pumping, you&rsquo;re excited for the win or angry for the loss. Either way, you don&rsquo;t feel like going to sleep yet.</p>

<p>My team&rsquo;s games usually start at 1:00 am or 1:30 am (2:30 for the Finals). I&rsquo;ve just got used to it. I either take a small nap before games or have a horrible sleep schedule for some days.</p>

<p>Also, learn that it&rsquo;s just a hobby of yours, if your team loses it&rsquo;s not your fault or your acquaintances&rsquo;. You&rsquo;re going to be a little grumpy because of the lack of sleep and your team losing is going to make it worse. Learn to live with that.</p>

<p>Or watch it on delay but you&rsquo;ll have to avoid any site or person that might spoil the score for you.</p>

Watching at eastern times is a nightmare because you wait super long for the game to start then if it‚Äôs interesting you try to stay awake but there‚Äôs so many stoppages you start hating the NBA. Plus if your team loses you‚Äôre both tired and angry and it‚Äôs very hard to go to sleep.</p>

And not just Eastern conference teams, a lot of Denver/Dallas games too for Jokic and Doncic. In fact I would bet they may schedule a lot of San Antonio games for those time slot so that people can watch Wemby. Even moreso if the Spurs draft Sarr, Risacher or Topic.</p>

      <label for="l8ud2y0" class="commentText"><p>From my experience in GMT timezone.
Weekend games tend to be played at better times for European viewers. Especially Sunday. There will usually be at least one game worth watching starting around 8-10pm.
During the week I can sometimes catch a Boston game starting around midnight if I don&rsquo;t have to wake up early, but that is a luxury I have as a college student.
Generally best way to go about it, especially if you want to follow a western conference team is to just watch replays the next day. It also means you don&rsquo;t get ads so the viewing experience on the whole is better. Also other benefits like being able to pause rewind without worrying about missing something happening live.</p>
