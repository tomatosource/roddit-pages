      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1do8fi1/amick_league_sources_say_the_39yearold_has_not/"><p>[Amick] League sources say the 39-year-old has not given the Lakers any indication about what he will do..He wasn’t involved in the coaching search — never mind that it involved his podcast partner — and has made it clear that he’s in wait-and-see mode when it comes to the Lakers’ offseason business</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <blockquote>
<p>As of Wednesday, the Lakers will be able to trade up to three first-round picks along with whatever players they choose in a trade. But are they willing to, especially when it comes to the prospect of trading a player like Austin Reaves or Rui Hachimura, who have long since become favorites within the Lakers ownership and front office walls? Therein lies the question that will likely dictate the mood going forward.</p>

<p>James’ looming free agency puts him front-and-center in the Lakers’ spotlight right now, and with good reason. <strong>League sources say the 39-year-old has not given the Lakers any indication about what he will do, even if the widely held expectation around the league is that he will either return on his player option or sign a new deal. He wasn’t involved in the coaching search — never mind that it involved his podcast partner — and has made it clear that he’s in wait-and-see mode when it comes to the Lakers’ offseason business and the part it might play in his decision. If he opts out, as so many expect, don’t be surprised if he takes his time in free agency from there.</strong></p>

<p>As Lakers owner Jeanie Buss has always said about this partnership, James’ happiness is the key to it all. Yet while some have surmised that James might be content coasting in these final Lakers years, enjoying all the benefits of living in Los Angeles while continuing to make his incredible mark on the league’s history books, league sources say he desperately wants to win at the highest of levels again. What’s more, James’ unprecedented play at this stage means he remains open to the prospect of playing two, or even three, more seasons before retiring.</p>

<p>As messaging goes, they didn’t exactly make it sound like a significant upgrade to the roster was happening anytime soon — whether it’s Cleveland’s Donovan Mitchell, Atlanta’s Dejounte Murray, Chicago’s Zach LaVine, Portland’s Jerami Grant, Charlotte’s Miles Bridges (who will be a free agent) or someone else of that ilk. Mitchell has long been seen as a premier target for the Lakers, but, according to The Athletic’s Shams Charania, the Cavaliers are optimistic that he’ll sign a $209 million extension soon. Murray, meanwhile, was a player that the Lakers could have had at the February trade deadline if they’d been willing to put Reaves into the deal. He’s a possibility now, as well, but league sources say the Lakers’ stance on Reaves remains the same.</p>

      <label for="la8zg83" class="commentText"><p>That’s what makes what LeBron is doing so insane. The only guys who were doing something similar to him at this age are Karl Malone, Kareem, and John Stockton. All three of those guys didn’t have as much mileage on them since they played in college for 3-4 year first, and even setting that aside, LeBron is better than any of them at that age. This despite the fact that his game is arguably more predicated on athleticism than any of them AND him filling a lot of what both Stockton and Malone did at the same time (he’s both the primary ball handler and a driver to the rim).</p>

<p>Just look at Dirk in year 21, the same season LeBron just finished. He was basically just there to mentor Luka and sell tickets. LeBron is still going and mad All-NBA. He’s arguably still a top 10 player in the league going into the season. No other guy at this age or point in their career was anywhere close to that, again Malone going into that Laker season is probably the closest thing and it’s not even close to where LeBron is right now.</p>

They played 3-4 years in college each which doesn’t have nearly the same number of minutes in a season. That was the point I was making, sorry if it was unclear.</p>

<p>LeBron is the career leader in regular season+playoff minutes and will pass Kareem for regular season minutes this season (already got the playoff minutes record years ago). He’s got more tread on his tires than anyone else ever has and he’s still going.</p>

      <label for="la8v08t" class="commentText"><p>It was good. I never said it couldn’t have been better but it was a good rebuild</p>

<ul>
<li>Julius Randle: Multiple time all nba player</li>
<li>Brandon Ingram: All star</li>
<li>Kuzma: Starter on championship team</li>
<li>Josh Hart: Starter on #2 seed</li>
<li>Caruso: One of the best defenders in the league (arguably best wing defender) and a starter (undrafted)</li>
<li>Reaves: Solid starter (undrafted too)</li>
<li>Zubac: Starter on an every year playoff team</li>
<li>Lonzo Ball: Was looking really really good before he got hurt</li>
<li>Mo Wagner: Solid rotation player</li>
</ul>

<p>If this isn’t a good rebuild I don’t know what is. And this is just the players they drafted (or “undrafted”). Add in with their ability to always get free agents who knows how good they would’ve been. It was a good rebuild.</p>

<p>I also feel like there’s a few players I’m forgetting who were good too</p>

<p>Edit: oh yeah Jordan Clarkson. Solid rotation player</p>

<p>IDK about that, even.  Cavs management hasn&rsquo;t historically been great, and frankly the franchise was kinda saved by a historic run of lottery pick luck before Lebron returned.  They&rsquo;re not getting 3 1st picks and 2 4th picks in four years if Lebron&rsquo;s still there.  And without those picks, they&rsquo;re not getting two all-stars to pair with Lebron in Kyrie and (via picks) Love.</p>

<p>Wades knee became a problem after the first year and bosh was done not long after anyway maybe they could’ve done something but Wade being hurt kind of fucked them regardless</p>

<p>Kyrie wanted out and Love started running into injuries</p>

<p>Not sure who to blame for LA stuff was but Jeanie let Caruso walk for money and that started the guard rotations of doom but AD and Lebron started trading injury time so it probably wouldn’t of mattered anyway</p>

<p>If lakers had a guard that could score and not be a pylon on the other end they’d be a lot better off but ever since Caruso walked there’s just been a bunch of awkward fits that led to the no defense rotation of dlo and Reaves somehow</p>

      <label for="la8mv1v" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s absolutely staggering how much that Westbrook move fucked them over.</p>

<p>If you look at what the Lakers gave for Westbrook - Kuzma, KCP, Harrell (who was receiving 6MOTY votes at the time), and a 1st round pick.  They also replaced Vogel with Ham in a desperate attempt to make the Westbrook situation work.  It&rsquo;s also very possible the financial implications of bringing in Westbrook led them to let Caruso go.</p>

<p>So in the best case you&rsquo;re adding Kuzma, KCP, Harrell, Caruso, Vogel, and a 1st round pick they could&rsquo;ve spent getting a productive player.  It probably doesn&rsquo;t work out <em>that</em> well because all those guys would get paid, but it&rsquo;s insane how one trade killed a championship team.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;d rather have kept KCP and Caruso than get another &ldquo;star&rdquo; player. Those two dudes are stars in their role and make the bigger difference in the playoffs.</p>

<p>But yeah, other than this season, I don&rsquo;t think we would&rsquo;ve had a shot at a ring with Bron and/or AD being injured in the playoffs, and either not playing or in limited fashion.</p>

      <label for="la97akj" class="commentText"><p>I know the comparisons between the two are tired, but I do think MJ’s situation is a great comparison to Lebron’s. We know MJ always wanted more input on the roster and such, but Krause being the hard ass he was never even really entertained Michael. At the time it probably seemed ludicrous, why ignore the GOAT’s wishes? Well, obviously in hindsight it’s extremely unlikely Jordan wins as much if he gets the input and power he desired.</p>

<p>Which is to say I wonder a lot how Lebron’s career would’ve turned out had he never had input. I don’t think anything beyond a miracle could’ve salvaged his first Cleveland stint, but LA at least could’ve ended up drastically different.</p>

I actually think he creates an uncomfortable situation not only with the organization but also the teammates. Plus he has them blow all of their assets right out of the gate to land the biggest available star of the day (which is worth it because he’s gotten four rings out of it). But then the culture of the team usually dissipates over the next couple of seasons as everyone is consistently on the trading block and/or taking all of the blame for losses.</p>

      <label for="la9b455" class="commentText"><p>It’s almost like you guys refuse to put any effort in anything that isn’t just black and white to you lol</p>

<p>Lebron is easily the most scrutinized, criticized and blamed athlete ever when it comes to team personnel, every year he is blamed by media for “wanting this or that guy out” or “getting this or that guy fired”. So it makes PERFECT sense for him to want the word to be out that he had no say in this coaching decision. How you people don’t understand this is just weird.</p>

<p>And then when Rich Paul talks about Bronny he says “well if this was about Bronny playing with his dad we’d just tell LA to take Bronny and that’s that”</p>

      <label for="la999df" class="commentText"><p>I mean, to be fair, the Lakers are really not a very impressive team right now, and LeBron &amp; AD could use another connective piece that doesn’t break the bank plus shooters. I don’t know how they’ll pull it off, but we saw how good the Lakers can be when they’re deeper in 2020. But if LeBron were really looking for a deep team, he’d opt-out &amp; accept a pay cut to clear up cap space.</p>

      <label for="la8ndo7" class="commentText"><p>No team is going to win a championship paying $50M/yr to a 40 year old. </p>

<p>If Lebron re-signs with Lakers, it increases the franchise value from having a legend on the roster. But a championship is unlikely. </p>

<p>If Lebron leaves, Jeannie makes more money from not being in the tax. Lakers can start a rebuild process. </p>

<p>This drama show is just created by the media to draw up some clickbait.</p>

<p>If Bron wasn&rsquo;t interested, why was he texting Dan Hurley to get him to come to the Lakers?</p>

<p>Also, JJ and Bron have a podcast. Do ya&rsquo;ll think these two have not spoken at all? Someone has to end the podcast so they&rsquo;re clearly in communication.</p>
