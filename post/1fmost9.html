      <p>New School VS Old School</p>

<p>Jokic already matches Moses accolades of 3 MVPs and 1 FMVP.</p>

<p>Giannis on the other hand has surpassed David Robinson&rsquo;s 1 MVP. Giannis has 2 MVPs and 1 FMVP in his belt.</p>

<p>But playing level wise.</p>

<p>Do you agree that Jokic/Giannis are better players than Moses Malone and David Robinson</p>

<p>In terms of Big Men, Are they knocking on the door of that cream of the crop tier:</p>

<p><strong>Kareem, Shaq, Hakeem, Wilt, Bill, Timmy</strong></p>

<p>Or you think Jokic and Giannis are still a tier below these legends. And still on Moses/David tier?</p>

<p>Or are they in the midpoint of those tiers?</p>

<p>Defensively and offensively Giannis can compete against him. Dude did have speed for a 7 footer. Plus he was the last or the only one to have a quadruple double. He was a machine on both ends of the court. Jokic might be able to go head to head against thin cause Jokic has skills to counter. Giannis don&rsquo;t really have much else besides bully ball.</p>

<p>I never really checked out Moses so I have no idea about him.</p>

<p>He was a rich man&rsquo;s Zach Randolph/Andre Drummond. Would miss his own shot 4 times at the basket and pad his rebound numbers.</p>

<p>Because he was a low skill / all hustle player his game elevated hisÂ  teams in the playoffs when games slow down, get grindy, and you need players that can win ugly and play bully ball.</p>

<p>Bullshit stat that is heavily flawed based on Nuggets rotations. 4 of the top 10 players in the NBA on on/off are the Nuggets starters.Â </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thats why his advanced stats are good.Â </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually not the case, on off doesn&rsquo;t factor into any of these advanced stats like BPM despite it being named plus minus. The reason why his advanced stats are inflated are because they use positional coefficients that gives centers +20% for points and +50% for assists. Yes if you&rsquo;re using a stat that says Jokic putting up 24 points and 10 assists equals 30 points and 15 assists. And Luka actually putting up 30 points and 15 assists is the equivalent of 24 points and 8 assists. Then yes the advanced stats would be in Jokics favor. Why you think that is a good or accurate way to measure basketball ability or on court play is beyond me.</p>

<p>None of the playoff stats matter for any individual MVP season. Only once has Jokic actually led Nuggets to the 1 seed. He&rsquo;s getting Westbrook level MVPs with worse stats.</p>

Why didn&rsquo;t KCP and AG have that kind of impact when they weren&rsquo;t on the nuggets.Why did a  Nuggets  starting lineup in 21 with AG,Monte Morris,Will Barton and Jeff Green have a 121 offensive rating and overall  a plus 10  net rating? Only DBPM takes in factor center assists.Why does he lead in all of the other stats that don&rsquo;t take it into account? He didn&rsquo;t win the MVP when he got 1 seed,and this year they had the same record as OKC. He got MVPs as a 3 and  tied for 1st seed. He got it as a 6 seed because he led a team that had the talent level of last years Detroit Pistons to 48 wins. What MVP of his was so egregious to you? Is he not one of the best passers and most efficient scorers ever that is also one of the best rebounders in the league? Why would he not be deserving of his mvps?</p>

      <label for="lock9y4" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s hard to hold Robinson up as one of the best when what I remember is Hakeem beating his ass.

<p>The Admiral was an all time great beyond a shadow of a doubt. Hakeem outplaying him doesn&rsquo;t change that, it&rsquo;s just a testament to how good Hakeem was at the time.Â </p>
