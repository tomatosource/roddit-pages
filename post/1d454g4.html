<p>It&rsquo;s cause he&rsquo;s Larry Bird levels of clear. Guy is a creationist and conspiracy theorist as he&rsquo;s shone on his own podcast. He&rsquo;s basically Kyrie Irving with better PR and less of a social media presence. If he was JJ Jackson from Compton, he&rsquo;d be constantly getting clowned on for pretending to be smart. Instead, he gets glazed nonstop.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard anything from JJ that would make me think he&rsquo;s intelligent, but this subreddit holds him up like he&rsquo;s one of the intellectual giants of basketball.</p>

<p><strong>COMPARING ACROSS GENERATIONS IS STUPID AF</strong></p>

<p>There is no way to do this analysis that is fair to anyone in either generation.</p>

<p>Baron makes a good point in this video that, you had all the time in the world to work on basketball, and JJ Reddick wasn&rsquo;t ANYWHERE close West in terms of peer to peer comparison.</p>

<p>Medicine, training, workouts, flights, diets, sports pyschs, a salary that provides generational wealth, better video technology, better stats analysis.</p>

<p>The game isn&rsquo;t even close to the same, it&rsquo;s impossible to compare.</p>

<p>I always assume  Reddick just is comparing like &ldquo;if you put Kevin Love in the 70s NBA he would be 10x MVP&rdquo; or whatever.</p>

<p>Yes and there are high schoolers at every high school in america that would win GOLD in the 100ms at the Olympics if they time traveled 100 years back in time. There are boys in HS right now that would SMOKE Jesse Owens in the 100m. The same 10.3 he ran in Berlin in 1936.</p>

<p>Compare players to who they played against. Jerry West was a fucking BEAST in the NBA when he played. He is a greater player, compared to his peers, than Love or basically anyone else in then NBA today outside of ~20 players.</p>

<p>If you are on TikTok there was a whole trend of &ldquo;we done with the 90s&rdquo; of clips of 90s and 80s basketball players clanking shots, and just looking inept. It was really funny to me how similar a lot of the NBA playoff games look to that now that the refs are letting them play a bit more.</p>

      <label for="l6ddcwl" class="commentText"><p>watching jerry west games, you experience this feeling of seeing the best player in the world at the time more than probably any player. I think one requirement for being the GOAT should be being the best player in the world at some given point. Jerry West was so talented as a guard on  both ends of the floor and I believe he would&rsquo;ve been a superstar in any era, given his build, brains, and work ethic. There&rsquo;s a reason he&rsquo;s such a highly regarded Scouter today.</p>

<p>The power forwards on the list were Giannis, Barkley, AD, Duncan, KG, Malone, Dirk, Rodman, McHale, and Pettit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously Kevin Love doesn&rsquo;t hold a candle to any of these dudes, but it&rsquo;s interesting that this list would hold up super well in today&rsquo;s game IMO. Giannis, AD, Duncan, KG, and Dirk are all either already modern day or close enough to it that their game wouldn&rsquo;t fit any differently than it did during their primes.</p>

<p>Barkley, Malone, and McHale were all so multi-talented and exceptional that I have zero doubt they&rsquo;d kill in today&rsquo;s game too. They all rebounded, Barkley was efficient, Malone was a killer pick-and-roll player, and McHale was a great defender and supreme post-up scorer. Their roles would be a bit different but they&rsquo;d all be killing the league today too.</p>

<p>Rodman was a supernaturally good rebounder and defender, but was an offensive liability outside of being a lane-filler on a break even in the 90s. That would be a bigger problem in today&rsquo;s game given the premium on shooting and ball skills, but he&rsquo;d still be fantastic overall IMO.</p>

<p>The PF list is really a lot less &ldquo;dated&rdquo; than some of the other positions.</p>

He could legit guard anyone 1-5 and grab every damn rebound, plus dig out a half dozen offensive rebounds, plus make a half dozen hustle plays, all while annoying the shit out of the other team&rsquo;s star player.</p>

<p>He would still be a great player today, the question is just how much his lack of offensive skills would hurt him. He knew the offense better than anyone and was a great screener, but couldn&rsquo;t shoot, couldn&rsquo;t put it on the floor, and was only an OK passer. The kind of guy it would be hard to keep on the floor in clutch possessions when he could just be abandoned to double team someone else.</p>

<p>He and Mikan are two of the guys who are done even worse justice than Wilt and Russell due to the lack of film because at least there is some great, clear HD footage from late in both of their careers.

      <label for="l6cnvld" class="commentText"><p>Redick is heavily leaning towards new generation and so is Richard Jefferson. I don&rsquo;t take them seriously when comparing eras.</p>

<p>Them two are trying to make themselves bigger than they were while disrespecting players they looked up to in their careers. Nobody ever made ads about Richard Jefferson or JJ Redick, nobody ever said &ldquo;we need to get one of them on our team&rdquo;, nobody ever said &ldquo;I wanna play with RJ/JJ&rdquo;, but they go around thrashing TMac, Paul Pierce, Jermaine O&rsquo;Neal, LMA, Brandon Roy etc.</p>

You can tell all the kids who never watched his era thinking he was some great star just because he has a podcast. It&rsquo;s like The Last Dance making people think Kerr was some integral piece of the Bulls championship teams lmao. People like him and Perk deserve to never be mentioned or thought of again, instead we give them hours of airtime a day and apparently head coaching gigs because they are photogenic and can talk coherently on air.</p>

Nobody is searching up a random game from the 80&rsquo;s/90&rsquo;s to watch and see what the actual game was like.  People assume Jordan was always unstoppable, and if you drove to the lane you got your ass beat&hellip;which is very far from the truth.</p>

<p>If I were a retired player who made maybe a couple hundred thousand and I played every game I could with terrible traveling, and I saw players today barely playing 80% of the games, in fact whining about that being a thing at all, while making 10-50 mil a year I’d think they were soft as shit too.</p>

<p>That’s not even mentioning all the improvements to diet, medicine, etc.</p>

He participated in civil rights protests, which only angered Boston in using the only word they can pronounce with a hard “R” sound.</p>

<p>In general, people avoid any tough interviews, you end up with something like the verge interview there because pichai clearly expected it to be more friendly and realized walking out would be a bad look. Basically need to catch them off guard</p>

I&rsquo;m a huge hockey fan and from the start of the NHL until about the 70&rsquo;s almost all NHL players had summer jobs. Sports didnt pay enough back then.</p>

<p>Difference is, no one in hockey circles says that Gordie Howe isn&rsquo;t one of the best of all time because he had to play against farmers, plumbers etc. he was still playing against the best hockey players in the world at the time and was able to dominate.</p>

<p>The very best players could definitely compete with the next generations. We can see a direct line that connects them all.</p>

<p>Give them the medical advancements, shoes, diet, and training they have today and the old school players would generally still be great.</p>

<p>Also, you can only compete within your own time against the players who are put in front of you. Will we say LeBron and Curry aren&rsquo;t any good 30 years from now because they didn&rsquo;t play against the genetically modified cyborg supermen of the future?</p>

      <label for="l6cgtg3" class="commentText"><p>Same for soccer, no one is diminishing the accomplishments. You can easily spot it was slower, tactics were horrible compared now (even in the 1990s) but the greats were still so much better than their peers. The only thing you can&rsquo;t really evaluate is before the 1950&rsquo;s since there was so little proper reporting going on, even pictures are hard to find, still have amazing stories though.</p>

They’ll pretend all they want that football started in 1992 with their statistical bookkeeping, but the moment it’s time to make actual history they come popping out with shit like “Manchester City are the first team in English top flight history to win 4 league titles in a row”.</p>

<p>Football started in 1992. Or it didn’t, when it’s convenient.</p>

      <label for="l6chadp" class="commentText"><p>Yeah there is a massive difference. But people talk more about the game being different than the players being worse.  Gretzky, Lemeiux and Orr are still seen as best 3 players by most people.</p>

<p>Its just the game is so much more high level today.  Much faster w/ with much better defense and goaltending.</p>

<p>Its also important to note how much more scoring there was back then when comparing stats today.</p>

<p>Like you had seasons where <sup>25</sup>&frasl;<sub>30</sub> guys scored 100 points. But 10 yrs ago Jamie Benn lead the NHL in scoring with under 90 pts.</p>

      <label for="l6d0w4e" class="commentText"><p>It’s a weird NBA specific thing. Legends in baseball and football are almost always respected. People still talk about Walter Payton and Barry Sanders as amazing RBs, nobody says shit like “they wouldn’t be good against faster modern LBs”. The ring culture is also different, Marino is still widely considered a top 5 QB all time despite never winning a Super Bowl. In the NBA if you haven’t won a title you’re a stat padding bum.</p>

      <label for="l6c7ad9" class="commentText"><p>The argument falls apart when you realize the older generation plays with the younger generations, and they do just fine, they even dominate the younger generation up to a certain point.</p>

<p>Like if you think about it all the current generation plays with and against Lebron or Curry and the like, they do just fine.</p>

<p>Lebron played with and against players like Kobe and Shaq, who played against the players of the 90s like MJ and shit.</p>

<p>MJ played against the likes of Magic and Bird. Magic and Bird played with and against guys like Kareem. Kareem played against someone like Wilt. Wilt played against Russel, and we&rsquo;ve tracked back now to the &ldquo;plumbers&rdquo; generation.</p>

<p>Did at any point any of these greats of the next generation absolutely blow away their older peers? Hell no. So at what point was the game accelerated so much that you could claim the old heads couldn&rsquo;t compete today?</p>

<p>Obviously they weren&rsquo;t as good as the current group of players. Each generation as they catch up to their older peers add to the game, that&rsquo;s how progress works, standing on the shoulders of giants. But if you gave all the older guys the knowledge they had at the end of their career and let them start anew, with the same training techniques and modern advances, they would be as good if not better than that next generation.</p>

<p>this is a great point and is always where the plumber argument falls apart. then you realize its 90% genZ fans (with no understanding of evolution or human biology) that conveniently claim that it is either the year right after Jordan retired, or the nanosecond lebron got drafted in 2003, who regurgitate this BS because its the last resort they have for lebrons claim to GOAT</p>

<p>Idk why people act like LeBron would be a good three point shooter if he played in the 70s when they would’ve probably nailed his ass to the block. He would’ve been just as great back then, but great for a 1970s basketball player with 1970s skills</p>

      <label for="l6c5y37" class="commentText"><p>yeah and this is a real interesting take and a perspective that I never thought of. i always represent for the old school players in these types of arguments. but I never even though about this.</p>

<p>My argument is essentially their fuckin shoes. I know it may sound stupid but just think about the shoes.</p>

<p>I play pickup ball once a week.  Everyone wears basketball shoes.  Mostly Nikes.  Nobody fuckin wears Asics or New Balance.  Now, nothing aginst asics or new balance. Those shoes are great for walking or running.  But nobody&rsquo;s playing ball in those shoes.  you&rsquo;d be crazy to.</p>

<p>But the shoes these guys were wearing in the 70s are like garbage compared to new balance.  These guys would have killed for new balance.  And Wilt averaged 48.5 minutes per game one season in shoes that I wouldn&rsquo;t even play pickup ball in against grade schoolers.</p>

<p>Perspective is key and yeah, critical thinking skills are important.</p>

<p>I respect them for making the game big and being great in spite of their conditions. In the modern era, especially in America, kids that are good at basketball and have great athletic tools have their entire world bend to make their chance at becoming a pro as easy as possible.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And for some reason people like JJ act like if we could transport him to this era he wouldn&rsquo;t hoop AT ALL. JJ acts like nothing back then was harder, it&rsquo;s just that they were less skilled. The traveling rules back then was infinitely more unforgiving. Jerry West with this era dribbling rules would absolutely feast now. u/dantheman9758 (Wilt Chamberlain Archive YT) has been going over this on his channel and it&rsquo;s funny to see JJ talk about players he&rsquo;s CLEARLY never even tried to research.</p>

      <label for="l6c5fjo" class="commentText"><p>He also had to play with rules that were much more strict about ball control and what the PG could and could not do with his hands to the ball.</p>

<p>This makes it so his highlights sometimes look wooden and clunky when he was only handling the ball like that so he wouldn&rsquo;t be called for multiple violations like a ball handler from this era would be if they played in the 50&rsquo;s/60&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The fact that he was able to handle the ball as well as he did, and pull off some of the moves he did, with really strict rules regarding ball-handling is enough to say he&rsquo;s an absolute legend, without even considering how often he and the Celtics won.</p>

To give you a better idea of this reality, Vida Blue won the Cy Young AND MVP in 1971, but also worked as a plumber because Oakland’s owner didn’t have to pay him more for his performance.</p>

      <label for="l6d7gz9" class="commentText"><p>Does everyone forget that JJ made the plumbers comment in response to an attempt to compare Bob Cousy to Chris Paul?</p>

<p>JJ&rsquo;s whole point wasn&rsquo;t that Cousy sucked worse than Paul: His point was you can&rsquo;t compare them</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why he brought up the plumbers and firemen bit, to illustrate that you can&rsquo;t compare them (HE&rsquo;S RIGHT)</p>

<p>He said something like &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s celebrate each player for what they did in their era&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everyone saying &ldquo;oh you know why he was guarded by firemen and plumbers, it&rsquo;s because you needed 3 jobs to be an NBA player at the time and you flew economy or took buses etc.&rdquo; YES but you&rsquo;re projecting that you think that JJ was being negative, he wasn&rsquo;t, you have to actually listen to the clips</p>

      <label for="l6csknu" class="commentText"><p>I implore anyone and everyone curious about JJ&rsquo;s comments to watch these two videos I recently made (and I&rsquo;ll be making more, because apparently crapping on NBA players from prior eras while podcasting is a thing now). He&rsquo;s an NBA player with a lot of content creation talent so he knows the game well (that he saw/played in), and is influential. But he&rsquo;s no historian so it&rsquo;s jarring when he speaks on the history of the game and without a doubt his comments are damaging for future generations of hoop fans. He knows little about the players he tries to diminish and lacks context for why they even played the way they played or put up the kind of stats they did. I try to address at least some of that in these videos. I don&rsquo;t even get into accolades, just showcasing how they played and why for anyone curious if those guys were any good.</p>

<p>Bob Cousy
<a href="https://youtu.be/20GAGSPRpdc" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/20GAGSPRpdc</a></p>

<p>Dolph Schayes
<a href="https://youtu.be/7DnKQPpDlrY" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/7DnKQPpDlrY</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s Cousy who he said was being guarded by plumbers and firemen (which was an indirect dig at West, and others Cousy played against). And it actually all started with Dolph Schayes. He claimed he could beat Dolph Schayes if he played in the past and then he&rsquo;d have been a 75 greatest player ever not Dolph.</p>
