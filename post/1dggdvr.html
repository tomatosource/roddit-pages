      <label for="l8pxb4l" class="commentText"><p>Great job by Dallas in pushing the pace early. Totally screwed up Boston&rsquo;s defense and would&rsquo;ve made me worried to put porzingis in for fear of his ankle exploding. If Dallas plays like this again he is desperately needed on both ends of the court. They really exploited Boston&rsquo;s lack of verticality on defense, and the offense looked stagnant and predictable. Shout-out to Lively he really was the one to shift the game.</p>

<p>One of the weaknesses in Boston&rsquo;s defense all season long is that guards can often end up having to box out bigs in the paint, Dallas figured out a way to exploit that while also preventing them from playing help defense in the paint, allowing for easy layups which eventually gave way to lobs and corner 3s. It was either scheming or Boston just stopped giving a shit early on, Tatum had zero defensive intensity all game</p>

<p>I wonder who the non horford bigs will be in game 5. Obviously the hope is porzingis but I have no idea what to expect. Tillman is incredible at moving his feet but the fact that he is undersized and has no jumping ability limits his abilities as a true center. Kornet could provide some rim protection and offensive boards, I worry about him being iso&rsquo;d at the top of the key but at the same time I imagine the defensive scheme for kornet or injured porzingis would be very similar, with heavy switching to prevent him being targeted. </p>

<p>First time this series it seemed that Boston missed shots due to Dallas defense, not just because. Jrue seemed afraid to shoot in the paint, and there also wasn&rsquo;t any cutting or high post looks. From the opening tip they just threw up mediocre 3s like they just expected them to fall instead of working for it. They need to find a way to re establish the drive and kick and come out aggressively. Every game it seems like they spend a few minutes just feeling out the defense before turning up the execution after several minutes, only this time they couldn&rsquo;t flip the switch and gave up before halftime </p>

      <label for="l8q4hmo" class="commentText"><p>Glad the Mavs didn&rsquo;t get swept.  They have had too good of a run to this point to go out that way.</p>

<p>Personally, this felt like an extention of the end of game 3.  Dallas down 21, goes on major run.  They cut the lead to 1 before Luka fouled out.  Boston needs to make an adjustment or two.  I&rsquo;m sure they will.</p>

<p>Still absolutely Boston&rsquo;s to lose.  And smart money says Celtics in 5.  But how big does the perverbial monkey on their back get if there is a game 6?</p>

<p>Edit- Dallas cut the lead back to 2 with 1:20 left.</p>

You’re gonna let up with a huge margin and knowing the friendly confines of Boston await you. They’ll deny that of course. But when they win the next game easy, come back and apologize to me.</p>

<p>If the Celtics close out game 5, the FMVP might be whoever has the better game. What do you guys think?</p>

      <label for="l8pzhw1" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, pretty much my thoughts as well. I think Tatum has the inside track given that he&rsquo;s clearly been the focus of Dallas&rsquo;s defense (seeing how fast they are to collapse on him basically every team he takes it to the paint) and has done more outside of scoring, so if he has a good scoring game with good efficiency, I think he gets it. That said, Brown&rsquo;s definitely right there as well.</p>

      <label for="l8qimx9" class="commentText"><p>That 49% from the field is doing a lot of heavy lifting for Brown right now. I thought he was outplaying Tatum but they stats are a closer then I thought. If Tatum was shooting 43% I think he would be a lock because he been the better overall player (Playmaking/Rebounding)</p>

      <label for="l8qlq9z" class="commentText"><p>I think you&rsquo;re right that this is how it is going to play out, however, I think Tatum deserves it. Brown has definitely been their best offensive player but Tatum does so much else while still producing similar to brown. And this is coming from a non-tatum fan. Sure, he has some silly moments and sometimes fizzles when needed, but the game is 4 quarters long not 1</p>

      <label for="l8pur6k" class="commentText"><p>At the end of the day, I’m having a hard time getting much out of yesterday’s game. It was over so quickly. Mavs shot 50%+and 40% from the field and 3, the energy was off from the start from the C, frustrating hit early, and then they gave up with 15 game minutes left. I am not necessarily worried about the crazy score because more than 25% of the game was done by guys like Hardaway and the very very end of the bench for the Cs (like Walsh who hasn’t played a second in weeks).</p>

<p>Anyway, as a Cs fan, I’m happy that this was game 4 vs game 3. I am not worried really about winning the title but I definitely didn’t want a loss like this.</p>

<p>I do think that the refs were pretty bad especially on drives to the basket, but no excuses, we didn’t have it last night.</p>

      <label for="l8q1ceu" class="commentText"><p>I think the indication is that the Dallas defense was more disciplined and specifically competent. Kyrie and Luka played closer to their man than they had any previous game in the series, and picking them on switches wasn&rsquo;t as effective. Additionally, there wasn&rsquo;t as much snap-collapsing with a player driving to the rim, so manufacturing wide open looks through ball movement didn&rsquo;t happen as often.</p>

      <label for="l8r4jag" class="commentText"><p>This was Kevin Malone (the office) dropping the pot of chili on the floor at the potluck.</p>

<p>Felt like Boston came in expecting to lose or get a half hearted effort from a defeated Mavs team. All the discourse was about “which J will get finals mvp??” They were locked in. Game was over early in the second, the guys had nothing. Shots were all missing.</p>

<p>Celtics do play better with a chip On their shoulder. It’d hard to see what you can learn from an epic failure they was over so early.</p>

      <label for="l8qqxjm" class="commentText"><p>Dallas&rsquo; rotations looked so much more connected and disciplined in this game. Luka and Kyrie did a better job guarding the ball, but even when they did get beat, the back line collapsed hard and everyone made the rotations they needed to make to cover shooters. I think the Celtics will be sharper offensively in game 5, but they did not look prepared for this kind of defensive effort, because frankly it hadn&rsquo;t consistently been there for the Mavs over the first 3 games. I think the Mavs learned a lot in this game about what they need to do to bother the Celtics&rsquo; offense. If they guard the same way for the rest of the series, the Celtics are going to have to work hard for another win. They have three more chances so they&rsquo;ll probably do it, but I don&rsquo;t think this is going to be as easy for them as a lot of people thought or perhaps still think.</p>

<p>Dallas&rsquo; pace and rebounding were two other huge highlights for them in this game. As another commenter already pointed out, the Celtics switches, while usually very effective, can sometimes leave guards with box out responsibilities in the paint, and the Mavs biggest and most athletic players aggressively hunted those opportunities for a massive rebounding advantage. Preventing the Celtics from getting multiple scoring chances and getting their roleplayers out in transition gave them a ton of advantages. Exum did a great job pushing the ball off the bench.</p>

<p>Dallas played very well and weren&rsquo;t all that reliant on three point shooting (their percentage was not great before the benches were emptied), which is a bit scary for Boston, because they almost never lost this year without their opponent catching fire from three. The things Dallas did well (very sharp rotations, dominant paint defense and rebounding, sprinting in transition) are at least partly or mostly replicable in game 5. I expect them to be very competitive again, should be a good game.</p>

      <label for="l8rfagf" class="commentText"><p>So this seems like a mix of two cases, where Mavericks found the right adjustments to defeat the Celtics and Celtics gave up. IMO at the moment Exum&rsquo;s 3 pointer called off and he made another, the Celtics called it quits. Exum is not primarily a shooter, see his form. That&rsquo;s not a primary shooter form. He didn&rsquo;t step into league as a shooting two-guard, anyway.</p>

<p>This is not the first time that a reverse blowout occured at a close out game and won&rsquo;t be the last. Credit to Kidd, Lively and the role players - they stepped up today.</p>

<p>If Celtics can&rsquo;t find a way to respond to Mavs&rsquo; adjustments (aggressive on rebounds, activating bigs properly etc.) for the next 3 games&hellip; this would be the worst embarrassment for a basketball team I have ever seen since following this sport in 2006; NBA, national teams and Euroleague combined.</p>

      <label for="l8rofoz" class="commentText"><p>I mean the biggest thing is the most efficient offense in NBA history shot 36% from FG% and Mavs shooting like 50% FG. This loss is similar to Miami Game 2 and Cavs Game 2 where Celtics had a horrendous shooting night</p>

      <label for="l8qpwt0" class="commentText"><p>When Twolves beat Mavs in game 4, it reminded me just how good they can be if they all click.  I don’t think Dallas comes out on top every time in a round robin tourney with Dallas, OKc, Nugs or Twolves, and clearly there are better matchups against Boston than what Dallas can put on the court.</p>

<p>But, last night was embarrassing, Boston could have won a damn championship last night and instead caved like meek, feeble old ladies. That was so ridiculous and it’s very easy to say “well Dallas is motivated and Boston can get them back home”.  This is the finals and everyone should be motivated which is why I have been so frustrated with Kidd this series not putting our guys in the best position to win.</p>

<p>For a team with the stack of players Boston has, it was one of the worst, sorry performances I have ever seen.</p>

<p>That wasn’t just “oh well take the was L”, that was complete destruction.</p>

<p>I’m not saying Dallas is about to win 3 straight, odds are Boston secures it Monday or game 6 but good god that was disgraceful.</p>

<p>Also I don’t get your point at thinking his rebounding isn’t important when it’s the number 1 reason they don’t have to play drop coverage against Luka.</p>
