<p>If the Celtics close out game 5, the FMVP might be whoever has the better game. What do you guys think?</p>

      <label for="l8pzhw1" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, pretty much my thoughts as well. I think Tatum has the inside track given that he&rsquo;s clearly been the focus of Dallas&rsquo;s defense (seeing how fast they are to collapse on him basically every team he takes it to the paint) and has done more outside of scoring, so if he has a good scoring game with good efficiency, I think he gets it. That said, Brown&rsquo;s definitely right there as well.</p>

      <label for="l8pur6k" class="commentText"><p>At the end of the day, I’m having a hard time getting much out of yesterday’s game. It was over so quickly. Mavs shot 50%+and 40% from the field and 3, the energy was off from the start from the C, frustrating hit early, and then they gave up with 15 game minutes left. I am not necessarily worried about the crazy score because more than 25% of the game was done by guys like Hardaway and the very very end of the bench for the Cs (like Walsh who hasn’t played a second in weeks).</p>

<p>Anyway, as a Cs fan, I’m happy that this was game 4 vs game 3. I am not worried really about winning the title but I definitely didn’t want a loss like this.</p>

<p>I do think that the refs were pretty bad especially on drives to the basket, but no excuses, we didn’t have it last night.</p>

      <label for="l8pwxix" class="commentText"><p>I am not necessarily saying the %s are the reason they won at all. If the C shot better, if they got a few more boards, etc etc the Cs still would have lost IMO.</p>

<p>I do think that it’s hard to get a lot from the terrible looking score though and game that was done by everyone so early. More than 25% of the game was done by the non-starters on both sides and the bench Mavs were knocking down 3s and putting up points.</p>

<p>In summary, the score is embarrassing but I am having a hard time getting like talking points or theories because the Cs were bad across the board and the Mavs played well, but also because the Jays “only” played 27 minutes.</p>

      <label for="l8pxb4l" class="commentText"><p>Great job by Dallas in pushing the pace early. Totally screwed up Boston&rsquo;s defense and would&rsquo;ve made me worried to put porzingis in for fear of his ankle exploding. If Dallas plays like this again he is desperately needed on both ends of the court. They really exploited Boston&rsquo;s lack of verticality on defense, and the offense looked stagnant and predictable. Shout-out to Lively he really was the one to shift the game.</p>

<p>One of the weaknesses in Boston&rsquo;s defense all season long is that guards can often end up having to box out bigs in the paint, Dallas figured out a way to exploit that while also preventing them from playing help defense in the paint, allowing for easy layups which eventually gave way to lobs and corner 3s. It was either scheming or Boston just stopped giving a shit early on, Tatum had zero defensive intensity all game</p>

<p>I wonder who the non horford bigs will be in game 5. Obviously the hope is porzingis but I have no idea what to expect. Tillman is incredible at moving his feet but the fact that he is undersized and has no jumping ability limits his abilities as a true center. Kornet could provide some rim protection and offensive boards, I worry about him being iso&rsquo;d at the top of the key but at the same time I imagine the defensive scheme for kornet or injured porzingis would be very similar, with heavy switching to prevent him being targeted. </p>

<p>First time this series it seemed that Boston missed shots due to Dallas defense, not just because. Jrue seemed afraid to shoot in the paint, and there also wasn&rsquo;t any cutting or high post looks. From the opening tip they just threw up mediocre 3s like they just expected them to fall instead of working for it. They need to find a way to re establish the drive and kick and come out aggressively. Every game it seems like they spend a few minutes just feeling out the defense before turning up the execution after several minutes, only this time they couldn&rsquo;t flip the switch and gave up before halftime </p>
