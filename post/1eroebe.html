      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1eroebe/is_there_a_bigger_gap_in_ability_between_steph/"><p>Is there a bigger gap in ability between Steph and the next best shooter or Magic and the next best passer?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I think it&rsquo;s almost unanimous that Steph is the greatest shooter of all time and Magic is the greatest passer of all time. My question is, who has a wider gap between them and #2 + the rest of the pack?</p>

<p>Also, stats are important, but not the end all be all here. For instance, Klay might actually be a slightly better catch-and-shoot 3pt maker than Steph, but Steph is so far and away better at creating his own shot it&rsquo;s why he is clearly the best shooter of all time. And Magic may not hold the assist record, but you would be hard-pressed by most fans and players if you said Stockton had a similar passing ability to Magic.</p>

<p>if 3 pointers is what determines the best shooter, than wouldn’t KAT be a better shooter than Dirk?</p>

<p>who wants to live in that world?</p>

<p>furthermore, would the best shooter of all time get locked up by Kevin Love with the game on the line?</p>

<p>do mid range and post fades mean nothing?</p>

<p>and that is why Dion Waiters is the best shooter of all time</p>

<p>Tbf, part of that is because of recency bias and most people here being 2000s born kids. All the people who unironically claim that Jokic or LeBron are better passers than Magic need to share what they&rsquo;re smoking</p>

<p>Larry bird was the best player in the 80s and i say that as a laker fan. (okay maybe magic was better, but its close)</p>

<p>The lakers were a better team, but Bird was unreal. He was the celtics best rebounder, scorer, passer (imo),  and defender on a team that won 3 titles and later in his career his back didnt exist.</p>

<p>After LBJ, Bird is the greatest SF ever, by a margin imo.</p>

<p>Bird is the better passer(significantly), rebounder and defender.</p>

<p>I value passing rebounding and defending over shooting.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t to say KD is a bum in those categories.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s a good to great defender, an above average rebounder, and a good enough passer.</p>

<p>Honestly, I probably should give KD more credit, I just don&rsquo;t think he measures up to &ldquo;The hick from french lick&rdquo;</p>

<p>And for those who say Pistol Pete, Magic could do everything PIstole Pete could and stuff Pistol couldn&rsquo;t do due to him being 6&rsquo;9&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Magic to me was the &ldquo;Perfect&rdquo; passer, like Steph is the &ldquo;Perfect&rdquo; shooter.</p>

      <label for="li0h1nl" class="commentText"><p>I think with Stockton it was largely due to that his passing was kind of vanilla due to being in a heavy PnR offense. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, being able to quickly identify the open man and giving him a solid pass in the sweet spot is extremely important, I just think a lot of people believe you could put any elite PG in his situation (specifically with a swingman like Malone) and they would be putting up the same gawdy numbers up. Stockton&rsquo;s passing was like Duncan&rsquo;s post game, no flash and all fundamentals.</p>

<p>To me, I just don&rsquo;t see Stockton having near the same success and orchestrating the Showtime offense like Magic, but I can see Magic running the PnR offense with Malone with 0 issue (especially since he already did to some degree with Worthy a bit in the late 80s and early 90s).</p>

<p>What do you mean? Dame and Trae both have his range.</p>

<p>Steph just eats their lunch on 3s around 24-25 feet. He’s not elite because of what he does at 35, he’s elite because of what he does at 25.</p>

      <label for="li0bp1u" class="commentText"><p>I mean maybe? But definitely not the accuracy. Trae is a 35.5% career 3pt shooter and Dame is 37.1%. Dame might have that &ldquo;clutch&rdquo; factor you can argue. But steph is at 42.6% on almost 2 more attempts per game game than Dame and almost 2.5 more attempts per game than Trae. So saying they have similar range as Steph but aren&rsquo;t close in percentage at lower volumes, I think is a tad generous.</p>

<p>30 feet and out fg% (from the video - which is 11 months old):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Trae Young (33%) - 536 fga</p></li>

<li><p>Damian Lillard (31.6%) - 639 fga</p></li>

<li><p>Stephen Curry (27.2%) - 640 fga</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So Trae and Dame are actually more accurate than Steph from 30+ feet.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m actually kind of surprised people don&rsquo;t think Magic sits in a tier far and away from the rest of the pack (not saying that&rsquo;s who I would pick in my scenario, in all honesty I think I lean towards Steph).</p>

<p>Magic literally makes passes none of those guys can make. Full-court one-handed bounce passes, the consistency of his no-look passes (the other guys could do it, but it was rare when with Magic it was a common occurrence).</p>

<p>Just out of curiosity, why do you think those guys listed are in the same tier as Magic in terms of passing?</p>

      <label for="li0d22x" class="commentText"><p>That’s because you’re a Lakers fan.  Magic was a good, efficient scorer and pulled constant doubles which made passing easier.  Stockton pulled bigger passing numbers (aside from career, which is largely because Magic retired at the exact end of his prime and Stock played until he qualified for AARP) without nearly the scoring threat and certainly was never double teamed.  Nash and Kidd may not be on Magic’s level, but Stockton is arguably a greater passer, just not as flashy.  The difference between Steph and the next best shooter is the difference between Magic and Steph’s passing.</p>

      <label for="li0a54j" class="commentText"><p>I don’t only think they’re in the same tier, I think a couple of them are better passers than Magic. I’d also consider throwing Jokic into that category too.</p>

<p>I don’t think Magic is a generational passer. Jason Kidd did everything you described Magic doing in spades. Stockton averaged 14.5 assists per game for his career. Jokic is able to make the passes he does, even at his height and size.</p>

      <label for="li0882o" class="commentText"><p>People kind of double count when dismissing Stockton by arguing that Magic had a slightly higher APG (less than 1 apg delta), but Stockton racked up the higher career total by not having HIV prematurely end it.</p>

<p>That counts Stocktons declining years against his APG without giving him credit for the longevity. Stockton had 4 of the top 5 highest APG seasons, and the lone exception was Isiah Thomas, not Magic.</p>

<p>I will say, though, that because Magic scored himself significantly more, his passes were more often at a higher difficulty level and a lot more impressive to watch.</p>

<p>However, as good as Karl Malone was, those Jazz teams never had the kind of depth of scoring options as the Showtime Lakers and teammates&rsquo; finishing ability hugely impacted their relative assist numbers.</p>

<p>To me, Stockton is kind of the Tim Duncan of point guards. So good at the fundamentals and finding the right passes that seem easy and obvious that you could miss that he&rsquo;s one of the greatest to ever play his position. While Magic had size and athleticism at the point unlike anyone that big until, arguably, LeBron James in his point forward era. And no one, not even LeBron could pull off the kind of eye-popping circus passes that gave Magic and Showtime their nick names.</p>

<p>I take Magic as the better overall player in his prime because he offered more versatility, but Stockton as the best pure passing point guard.</p>

      <label for="li0k5sm" class="commentText"><p>I like how you said the Tim Duncan of passing because I made that exact comparison as well somewhere in this thread.</p>

<p>I think the thing I look at with Magic is, do you think he could have done what Stockton did in that offense and do you think Stockton could do what Magic did in his offense? I think the answer is yes and no. Magic wasn&rsquo;t only flash and no substance. He was fantastic at entry passes and honestly I think he could have gotten Malone an extra 2-4ppg if they played together.</p>

<p>Again, not to take away from Stockton, I just feel like while he did master the fundamentals and probably had even better decision making than some other greats in terms of passing, I just don&rsquo;t see why other great passers in his situation couldn&rsquo;t put up those same gawdy assist numbers.</p>

<p>Like you couldn&rsquo;t have Showtime without Magic, but I just don&rsquo;t know if you can say the same about the Utah Jazz&rsquo;s offense. I&rsquo;m not even sure if Nash really could run the showtime offense as effectively even though that&rsquo;s kind of the closest style of offense we&rsquo;ve seen since Showtime.</p>

<p>Like honestly, Magic passes just like Jokic out of the post, but can also run a fastbreak better than CP3, Nash, or Lebron.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdHRCL0kM7M" target="_blank">How much Magic have you watched? </a></p>

<p>Also, for the record, I do think Steph is a better shooter than Magic is a passer, I&rsquo;m just kind of surprised think players like Lebron and Jokic are in the same league as Magic in terms of playmaking ability.</p>

He finished with a career 42.8% from 3, which is actually higher than Curry (42.6%). But of course, Nash was shooting like 3 and Curry shoots like 11 per game. Nash narrowly missed five consecutive 50–40–90 seasons by shooting at 89.9% from the free throw line during the 2006–07 season, one made free throw short of the 90% mark. I ain’t saying he’s in Curry’s league but his name is often forgotten when talking about great shooters.</p>

<p>Steph&rsquo;s 402 threes in a season is not gonna be broken anytime soon. No one is even close when it comes to efficiency at a high volume.</p>

<p>Although his all time three point record might be broken, but its probably cause the newer generation is chucking more threes now, and conceivably someone who plays 20+ season shooting 200-300 threes could pass him. Maybe Luka, but very unlikely still.</p>

<p>As for Magic, I don’t think he needs any asterisk. For all we know the average could’ve been higher! He got robbed of some great years and he probably would have aged like a fine wine with his size and skillset offering so much versatility.

<p>LeBron is #2 right now about 300 behind magic (with like 100 extra games played), so he’d need the equivalent of two more trips to the finals averaging 8 assists per game to catch magic. So it’s at least theoretically possible for him to do it but almost definitely won’t.</p>

<p>3rd is Stockton who is 500 back of Magic. Nobody else is within 1,000.</p>

<p>I really doubt it. Magic played 190 playoff games, which is 13th most all time, and <em>averaged</em> over 12 assists per game, which is more than two over Stockton at number two (and Stockton is the only other player to average over 10).</p>

<p>Luka had 178 assists this past postseason, which led the playoffs. Magic <em>averaged</em> 180 across 13 playoff runs (and that’s including first round exits in ‘81 and ‘96). He had fucking 303 assists in 1988, and had five other postseasons with over 200 assists plus another with 192.</p>

<p>To catch magic Luka would have to replicate last year’s playoff run 12 more times. And Luka is the non-Lebron active player with the most realistic shot at catching magic.</p>

      <label for="li0dtea" class="commentText"><p><a href="https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/most-assists-per-game-in-playoffs-in-one-season" target="_blank">Of the top 20 single Post-Season Assists Per Game, Magic does own 8 of them</a>, with the fewest games played in one of those post-season runs being 9 games (5 post-season runs, 2 of which are from Stockton, are from 5 games or less, meaning they didn&rsquo;t even advance to the 2nd round and one outlier performance can inflate their assist numbers in such a small sample size).</p>

<p>He also has 2 Post Season runs where he averaged above 15 assists per game. For total assists in the playoffs, Magic owns spots 1-4, 6, 7-8 in the top 10 (7 out of the 10 spots). His total of 303 assists in a single post-season is likely to never be broken (next non-Magic total in assists is Rondo at 227, that&rsquo;s 13 fewer than Magic&rsquo;s 4th highest total of 240).</p>

<p>Magic&rsquo;s post-season passing numbers are prolific and while Stockton&rsquo;s APG are in shouting distance, only 2 of those 5 in the top 20 came from post-season runs with 10+ games.</p>

<p>Additionally, while Stockton is a phenomenal passer, he did run an offense that heavily relied on the PnR with Malone, which naturally resulted in low-difficulty passes turning into assists fairly frequently (just the nature of a heavy PnR offense). Obviously I&rsquo;m not trying to call Stockton a PnR merchant, but when you watch the two offenses it&rsquo;s pretty clear one offense was built around having a player that could make high difficulty passes and the other was around a player that had excellent judgment, quick release, and was a master of simple passes.</p>

Steph&rsquo;s single season three point record of 402 is just 6.3% better than the #2 all time. He shares the post season record with Klay.<br>
Magic&rsquo;s post season APG record is a whopping 22.4% better than the next best.</p>

      <label for="li08yy7" class="commentText"><p>Nobody comes close to Steph as an overall shooter. Klay and Ray are close as catch-and-shoot 3-pointers. But when you combine the range (mid range to way out past the arc), his ability to create space and pull up, and his ability to make shots under heavy duress, there’s nobody even close.</p>

      <label for="li0cq9o" class="commentText"><p>Steph is 1 of 1 and his off ball movement along with his gravity is another Avenue that makes him the GOAT shooter. Being 6&rsquo;3&rdquo; and dominating in the leagues of big, I guess there ain&rsquo;t gonna be anyone even close to him ever. He did it all off a bad ankle..</p>

<p>Magic passing skills are elite but we have seen some really jaw dropping passes in the last decade or 2 itself. Not as often as how fancy Magic was but passing skills can be copied by high IQ players and  the shooting mechanics can&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>The gap between Steph and no one else is massive compared to passing skills between Magic and most of the players who drop dimes imitiating Magic</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching basketball for 30+ years, and you always see glimpses of a player that make you say &ldquo;man, he&rsquo;s so good, he reminds me of player X&rdquo;.</p>

<p>But when Steph really started going off, there was literally no comparison I could think of that would do his shot justice. And it&rsquo;s not just the stroke. That&rsquo;s easy to find comparisons to.</p>

<p>How little space and time he needs, the audacity of some of his shots&hellip;never seen before. Prior to Steph, a good number of shot attempts like his, would result in the coach immediately taking you out of the game, and subjected to ridicule from fans and media.</p>

<p>He might be the only player in history to take a 40-foot 3 pointer with 18 seconds left on the shot clock, and you immediately think &ldquo;well, it&rsquo;s Curry, so it&rsquo;s not a bad shot&rdquo;.</p>

      <label for="li0nghd" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m as big of a Steph fan as they come, but I actually think Steve Nash is worth debating here (on much lower volume obviously).</p>

<p>Steph has (somehow) only had ONE 50/40/90 season - 2015-2016.</p>

<p>Nash had SIX consecutive 50/40/90 seasons from 2004-2010, and averaged 51/45/91 during this 6 year stretch. He also averaged 11 assists per game during this stretch.</p>

<p>Nash peaked at 47% from 3 in the 2007-2008 season, which is higher than Steph has ever averaged. Again very different volume.</p>

<p>Career shooting numbers:
Steph - 47/43/91
Nash - 49/43/90</p>

<p>Steph is unquestionably the GOAT shooter, but I think Nash is debatable.</p>

      <label for="li07hcp" class="commentText"><p>Stephs shooting tbh.</p>

<p>There are a couple of guys that are comparable to Magic.</p>

<p>Whether its Stockton (who is a comparable passer imo), Nash or CP3.</p>

<p>And then you have guys like Lebron or Jokic, who will score a ton and pass. As passers they are great because thwy can also score well.</p>

<p>Id still say Magic is the best ever, but Steph is by far the best 3 point shooter ever.</p>

<p>This isnt me saying that Steph is better than Magic, but that Steph is incomparably better than the next best shooter just by the nature of the type of shooter he is.</p>

<p>A 3 point specialist wasnt something that was common before Steph came to the scene and since then, there hasnt been a guy comparable to him.</p>

      <label for="li0ah1b" class="commentText"><p>I’m going to counter the tide here and say Magic. Steph is the greatest shooter, but a lot of that is due to sheer volume of makes and his overall game.</p>

<p>How that compares to Magics assist numbers I don’t know, but I think if you compare Steph’s 25 or 100 best shots I don’t think it compares to Magics 25 or 100 best passes. Most of the best passers of all time are relatively stiff and one dimensional compared to Magic. I think Dame or Klay emulate a lot more of Steph’s shooting than Chris Paul or LeBron emulate of Magic.</p>

      <label for="li0mq25" class="commentText"><p>And people saying Jokic is better don&rsquo;t realize that Magic was making the passes Jokic does out of the post as well (he was 6&rsquo;9&rdquo;, so he would often post-up around the paint to make passes to slashers or Kareem. Those no-look behind the back passes Jokic makes out of the post, Magic already did them).</p>

<p>Also as I&rsquo;m going back and watching some more Magic film to refresh myself (seriously, I feel like I&rsquo;m taking crazy-pills with people saying Magic isn&rsquo;t the definitive best passer of all time - and I say that as someone who thinks Steph is probably a better shooter than Magic was a passer), I&rsquo;m starting to realize that a lot of his passes are kind of like hockey assists. He hits the guy in stride perfectly to shovel it to someone else. Kind of wonder what his assist tally would be if we counted hockey assists.</p>

I think u underestimating steph wow factor on his shooting. Um Bron and jokic made some alltime great passes comparable to magic if u gonna use Dame. Klay no.

No one even comes close to replicating Curry. Curry is like the next two best shooters (Dame and Reggie?) combined if you merged their best attributes</p>

He was a very gifted point guard who had excellent vision, but that can be said for a lot of the players others have already mentioned in this thread. The OP is basing an entire argument on a flawed assumption. Curry is the greatest pure shooter of all time from the 3 point line and revolutionized the game; however, there are better shooters from midrange and in the paint.</p>

      <label for="li0bfdb" class="commentText"><p>It’s Magic. Every season, the gap between Steph and every other shooter is lessened. Nobody is close to Magic and it’s been like 30 years.</p>

<p>Let’s look at last season. Steph was 32 in 3pt % (down year too lol, at 40.8%) and number 1 in 3 attempts per game (11.8). Luka shot 38% on 10.6 3PA.</p>

<p>McCollum was 8.5 3PA on 42.9%. Steph is the goat shooter, but the league is catching up fast.</p>

<p>Magic has 11.2 APG on his career. Stockton is a full assist behind and he’s up there as a goat. The increase in pace and the decrease in pure pass first guards is going to damper that. Maybe Luka again can take it eventually.</p>

<p>It isnt the end all metric, but it is an indication of who is making the passes that lead to scoring.</p>

<p>Unless there exists an advanced analytics that is like “correct pass leading to score minus missed correct pass”, the eye test is going to be overvalued. And as someone who watched Magic Johnson, nobody has come close.</p>

<p>And, that doesn’t change the fact that Steph’s greatest accomplishment is how he changed the game due to the frequency of 3PA. And the league is catching up.</p>

I think his charisma and energy literally brought everyone to a higher level.
With that being said: Steph has changed the sport.
We literally look forward to The Three point Competition over The Dunk Contest. The Warriors broke the mold. An undersized team with jump shooters in perpetual motion. Steph has changed the game.
As far as charisma and from a marketing standpoint not sure anyone has ever did as much as Magic. He and Larry brought the league from The Dark Ages to the mainstream.</p>

<p>Steph routinely turns around and starts celebrating before the ball goes in. His shooting skills are in a league of their own</p>

      <label for="li05h49" class="commentText"><p>Magic was a more entertaining passer but Stockton has far more assists.</p>

<p>Personally I would put Bird, Magic, Stockton, Jokic, Nash, Kidd all on the same level with Lebron not far behind. That behind the back pass to Booker was insane.</p>

      <label for="li07c66" class="commentText"><p>Bird &amp; Kidd are a tier down for me</p>

<p>Jokic &amp;gt;= Magic &amp;gt; Nash &amp;gt; Stockton for top tier IMO</p>

      <label for="li0bhnr" class="commentText"><p>For me watching Bird&rsquo;s highlights the part that stands out the most is his passing. He could do the behind the back, no look, between the legs, lobs, etc&hellip; I think that&rsquo;s part of the reason Bird and Magic are so linked. They both had insanely high BBIQ.</p>
