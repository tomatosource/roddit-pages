      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1eroebe/is_there_a_bigger_gap_in_ability_between_steph/"><p>Is there a bigger gap in ability between Steph and the next best shooter or Magic and the next best passer?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I think it&rsquo;s almost unanimous that Steph is the greatest shooter of all time and Magic is the greatest passer of all time. My question is, who has a wider gap between them and #2 + the rest of the pack?</p>

<p>Also, stats are important, but not the end all be all here. For instance, Klay might actually be a slightly better catch-and-shoot 3pt maker than Steph, but Steph is so far and away better at creating his own shot it&rsquo;s why he is clearly the best shooter of all time. And Magic may not hold the assist record, but you would be hard-pressed by most fans and players if you said Stockton had a similar passing ability to Magic.</p>

<p>“He was taking shots that &ndash; in my basketball blood &ndash; every coach I ever had would have a heart attack watching those shots. I had to get over what was instilled in my brain about what was a good shot and what was a bad shot. With Steph, you have to understand, part of what makes him so powerful is that he’s going to steal the ball at midcourt and pull up from 40 feet,&ldquo; Kerr once said.</p>

      <label for="li1x9xp" class="commentText"><p>I can&rsquo;t speak on the statistics, but one of the arguments of this page is pretty astounding: that Rodman was not just a truly generational rebounder (somebody you could expect to appear once in a generation), he was an epochal rebounder (somebody you could expect to appear once every 400 years). The argument is heavily caveated, but it&rsquo;s still a pretty wild idea. &ldquo;Generational&rdquo; is one of highest complimentary adjectives we have to describe somebody, and Rodman may have been something far beyond generational. Time will tell, I suppose.</p>

      <label for="li1cl4u" class="commentText"><p>I can&rsquo;t find the original blog post from like 2011, think it was on Wages of Wins or something, but the gist of the argument was that Rodman was one of the most valuable players of all time and rebounding, in particular offensive rebounding is a massively massively underrated skill.</p>

<p>They basically postulated that Rodman was so so much better at rebounding than anyone else and didn&rsquo;t really hurt his team elsewhere (as long as his mentality was OK) while being elite defensively that nobody else in the NBA came close to matching what he offered, and what he offered was extremely valuable, ergo he was the most valuable player due to having the most unique useful skillset. They had him over Jordan . FWIW to the other person somewhere else who mentioned Moses, Moses also came off brilliantly in this model</p>

His handle isn&rsquo;t as tight as some of the other great ball handlers and he also doesn&rsquo;t have a wide variety of dribble combinations combined with footwork. Jason Williams, Steph, Kemba, CP3 are others I would put above AI in ball handling. Honorable mention to PG13 who is the best wing ball handler ever IMO</p>

      <label for="li26nn5" class="commentText"><p>I agree.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that AI wasn&rsquo;t a good ballhandler. He just wasn&rsquo;t really that great. Kyrie has combos on top of combos. AI had a crossover which honestly was only great because he might be the quickest person I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>

<p>AI&rsquo;s crossover was so effective because his first step was ridiculous. He didn&rsquo;t even need to make dribble moves to beat most defenders. He could just accelerate past them before they could react. In order to have a prayer of staying in front of him, defenders kind of had to guess which way he was going. So when he hung his dribble and feinted one way, defenders had to bite on it or he&rsquo;d blow right by them.</p>

<p>Then he was so freaking nimble in the lane. Forget about a deceleration step. AI would be going full speed in one direction, and then just instantly change to going full speed in a different direction. He&rsquo;d hop between multiple defenders to make space. You just couldn&rsquo;t catch him. He was like a cat.</p>

      <label for="li0sxo2" class="commentText"><p>The argument against Rodman would be that rebounding and defense were the only things he had to really worry about.  He could focus all his effort on those areas which a lot of other players didn&rsquo;t have to do.  In addition, there are instances of Rodman abandoning his defensive position to chase rebounds (one of the Rockets/Spurs game in one of the last possessions has Rodman chase a rebound, leaving Hakeem open to get a put-back shot).  Then, from a raw numbers perspecyive, while the pace was much higher, Wilt and Russel still blow everyone out of the water, and were magnitudes better than the other best rebounders in their era.</p>

<p>With Curry for example, he&rsquo;s not the best shooter because of his percentage, he&rsquo;s the best shooter because he&rsquo;s the 1A guy teams gameplan around, who still hits a super high percentage of his shots, including incredibly difficult shots.  Kyle Korver might have better percentages, but he&rsquo;s not having to do nearly as much as Curry, so Curry gets the nod.</p>

<p>rodman was way way way better than his peers compared to Wilt and Russell.  There were also many more missed shots available to rebound in wilt and russell’s era.</p>

So, any metric would have to be based on the eye test which is inherently not a great way to distinguish players when there are tons of variables.</p>

<p>if 3 pointers is what determines the best shooter, than wouldn’t KAT be a better shooter than Dirk?</p>

<p>who wants to live in that world?</p>

<p>furthermore, would the best shooter of all time get locked up by Kevin Love with the game on the line?</p>

<p>do mid range and post fades mean nothing?</p>

<p>and that is why Dion Waiters is the best shooter of all time</p>

<p>Dirk gotta be a top 3 shooter all time</p>

<p>I’d say Steph/Bird/Dork once you account for all types of shooting are my top 3.</p>

<p>you can easily and KD, Jordan, and even Kyrie in there if you want.</p>

<p>Kyrie is a career 40% shooter on high volume, that little elbow pull-up off the PnR is basically a bucket every time, and he has the best post fade of any dude under 6’6 in NBA history. the man is crazy but his game is 👨‍🍳💋</p>

<p>also Mark Price needs a mention at least. man was all-NBA over prime Stockton</p>

      <label for="li34fud" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s insane to me how his super efficient, elite finishing drives (even amongst the greatest PGs) is like just 10% of his legacy because his 3pt shotmaking and ability to stretch the defense through off ball movement is GOAT level.</p>

<p>Now this made me wonder, if we nerf his 3pt shot and ball movement to mortal levels but keep his ball handling and efficincy in finishing (and ft), which player is most similar to that?</p>

<p>I think Steph is the best by miles, but I also think there are now players with his very same range and similar off dribble ability. I would put Dame in that range, or at least vicinity. But Steph is much better off ball. And in general Steph had higher % too.</p>

<p>But you are talking with one that have Curry among the all time greats in general in basketball, not only as a shooter. And just a few missed opportunities took him from really being entering in GOAT conversation, imho.</p>

If Curry didn&rsquo;t have his handles and had to play as a catch and shoot guy, his average three point attempt would be way, way further than it is now and we&rsquo;d all be talking about how he&rsquo;s the greatest shooter ever and how he&rsquo;d be in the goat conversation if he could dribble.</p>

      <label for="li27w3h" class="commentText"><p>Klay Thompson is close to Curry on catch and shoot attempts&hellip; statistically.</p>

<p>But yeah&hellip; If Curry spent his whole career just shooting the types of threes that regular good three point shooters do, he&rsquo;s probably better shooting 45-46% for his career. Like, if Curry had the same shot profile as Steve Kerr, he&rsquo;d have shot close to 50%.</p>

<p>His first few seasons in the league were all close to 45% from three because he wasn&rsquo;t taking the ridiculous threes he does now. He didn&rsquo;t become a worse shooter. His threes are just harder to get off now. The fact that he&rsquo;s increased his volume while facing defenses designed to take away his shooting and still shoots consistently over 40% is just insane.</p>

Harden likes creating all the offense. Also Harden is a good catch and 3 shooter but when he first got to the Clippers he had an issue where he was unwilling to let it fly immediately. I think he&rsquo;s started to get over it though</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching basketball for 30+ years, and you always see glimpses of a player that make you say &ldquo;man, he&rsquo;s so good, he reminds me of player X&rdquo;.</p>

<p>But when Steph really started going off, there was literally no comparison I could think of that would do his shot justice. And it&rsquo;s not just the stroke. That&rsquo;s easy to find comparisons to.</p>

<p>How little space and time he needs, the audacity of some of his shots&hellip;never seen before. Prior to Steph, a good number of shot attempts like his, would result in the coach immediately taking you out of the game, and subjected to ridicule from fans and media.</p>

<p>He might be the only player in history to take a 40-foot 3 pointer with 18 seconds left on the shot clock, and you immediately think &ldquo;well, it&rsquo;s Curry, so it&rsquo;s not a bad shot&rdquo;.</p>

<p>But not for Steph. He is the clear cut GOAT shooter. Period. Others aren&rsquo;t even close.</p>

      <label for="li0882o" class="commentText"><p>People kind of double count when dismissing Stockton by arguing that Magic had a slightly higher APG (less than 1 apg delta), but Stockton racked up the higher career total by not having HIV prematurely end it.</p>

<p>That counts Stocktons declining years against his APG without giving him credit for the longevity. Stockton had 4 of the top 5 highest APG seasons, and the lone exception was Isiah Thomas, not Magic.</p>

<p>I will say, though, that because Magic scored himself significantly more, his passes were more often at a higher difficulty level and a lot more impressive to watch.</p>

<p>However, as good as Karl Malone was, those Jazz teams never had the kind of depth of scoring options as the Showtime Lakers and teammates&rsquo; finishing ability hugely impacted their relative assist numbers.</p>

<p>To me, Stockton is kind of the Tim Duncan of point guards. So good at the fundamentals and finding the right passes that seem easy and obvious that you could miss that he&rsquo;s one of the greatest to ever play his position. While Magic had size and athleticism at the point unlike anyone that big until, arguably, LeBron James in his point forward era. And no one, not even LeBron could pull off the kind of eye-popping circus passes that gave Magic and Showtime their nick names.</p>

<p>I take Magic as the better overall player in his prime because he offered more versatility, but Stockton as the best pure passing point guard.</p>

      <label for="li1tfqs" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s saying that Stockton is the better floor general and Magic is the flashier passer. It depends on your interpretation of the term &ldquo;better passer&rdquo;. There are multiple facets to passing, and clearly flashy passing isn&rsquo;t the only thing that matters, otherwise Jason Williams would be a HoFer and most would consider him better than Stockton, but it&rsquo;s OK to put some stock in it, so some people will say Magic was the better passer and some will say Stockton, and they&rsquo;ll both be right because they just interpret the term differently.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just like with the term &ldquo;greatest player in NBA history&rdquo;. There are certainly wrong answers, but Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Wilt Chamberlain, and even Bill Russell could all be valid answers depending on how someone chooses to interpret it. You really have to define your standards to have a meaningful conversation because someone who says Lebron and someone who says Russell are clearly disagreeing heavily on some fundamental criteria.</p>

      <label for="li0k5sm" class="commentText"><p>I like how you said the Tim Duncan of passing because I made that exact comparison as well somewhere in this thread.</p>

<p>I think the thing I look at with Magic is, do you think he could have done what Stockton did in that offense and do you think Stockton could do what Magic did in his offense? I think the answer is yes and no. Magic wasn&rsquo;t only flash and no substance. He was fantastic at entry passes and honestly I think he could have gotten Malone an extra 2-4ppg if they played together.</p>

<p>Again, not to take away from Stockton, I just feel like while he did master the fundamentals and probably had even better decision making than some other greats in terms of passing, I just don&rsquo;t see why other great passers in his situation couldn&rsquo;t put up those same gawdy assist numbers.</p>

<p>Like you couldn&rsquo;t have Showtime without Magic, but I just don&rsquo;t know if you can say the same about the Utah Jazz&rsquo;s offense. I&rsquo;m not even sure if Nash really could run the showtime offense as effectively even though that&rsquo;s kind of the closest style of offense we&rsquo;ve seen since Showtime.</p>

      <label for="li1z78z" class="commentText"><p>What is interesting is Nash, in addition to be talked about as one of the great passers, is also in the discussion  for second best shooter. He had four 50-40-90 seasons and missed a fifth by .1% from the line. The rest of the NBA combined has 14 of those seasons. Obviously the volume was nowhere near the same as Steph, but you have to wonder what he would’ve done in today’s NBA where the shooting PG was more of an emphasis. He has the scoring ability, for sure. Steph is #1 without dispute, but I don’t think the chasm between him and Nash is quite as wide as people think.</p>

      <label for="li2dwig" class="commentText"><p>Stockton is not competing for “greatest passer of all time”. He was a floor general, game manager passer and was arguably the best at that, but didn’t consistently make the difficult passes the other players above him did/do. That wasn’t his game, but if you don’t so it, you don’t get a bonus for it from me.</p>

<p>When people talk about best passers, they usually try to conflate it with “person that gets the most assists” when that isn’t what it means. Also AST/TO ratio doesn’t always mean someone was a more efficient passer than someone else without looking at usage rate and how they get those turnovers, if someone else, like Chris Paul, has way more dribbling and driving responsibilities and has tougher reads to make when passing the ball.</p>

<p>The ability to pass the ball, i.e. fitting it through tight windows, across the court, over defenders, under defenders, moving them around with fakes, alley-oop passes, flashy passes, etc. These all are what I really look at when trying to decide how good of a passer someone is. And Stockton does not fit enough of these for me, to be in the conversation for “best passer of all time”.</p>

He finished with a career 42.8% from 3, which is actually higher than Curry (42.6%). But of course, Nash was shooting like 3 and Curry shoots like 11 per game. Nash narrowly missed five consecutive 50–40–90 seasons by shooting at 89.9% from the free throw line during the 2006–07 season, one made free throw short of the 90% mark. I ain’t saying he’s in Curry’s league but his name is often forgotten when talking about great shooters.</p>

      <label for="li0cq9o" class="commentText"><p>Steph is 1 of 1 and his off ball movement along with his gravity is another Avenue that makes him the GOAT shooter. Being 6&rsquo;3&rdquo; and dominating in the leagues of big, I guess there ain&rsquo;t gonna be anyone even close to him ever. He did it all off a bad ankle..</p>

<p>Magic passing skills are elite but we have seen some really jaw dropping passes in the last decade or 2 itself. Not as often as how fancy Magic was but passing skills can be copied by high IQ players and  the shooting mechanics can&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>The gap between Steph and no one else is massive compared to passing skills between Magic and most of the players who drop dimes imitiating Magic</p>

      <label for="li1ct3h" class="commentText"><p>Long time lurker posting here. This happens to be a topic I very much enjoy, so thanks for asking and got me really thinking. My $0.02 is there are two ways to make this comparison objectively. First is look at players respective peaks, Steph and Magic vs the next guy. Second is their entire body of work vs the next guy. You may say numbers don’t tell the full truth of how “good/flashy/accurate” a passer is, but I would argue that being the best passer should also mean they are consistent, and have the ability to make the right pass at the right time over and over and over again, even if it’s a simple pass. Otherwise, this is just a popularity contest with recency bias (someone could easily be influenced by seeing more Lebron/Jokic passing highlights on YT)</p>

<p>So the numbers. For Curry’s peak, 15-16 season, he shot 45.4%(50/40/90 split) on 3s with 402 make, an all time record. The next best is Harden in 18-19, 378 3s at 36.8%. That’s 6.3% more 3s, and 23% higher efficiency.</p>

<p>Curry’s career total 3s at 3747 and counting, at 42.6%. The next best is Ray Allen with 2973 3s at 40%. That’s 21% more 3s and 26% higher efficiency. The career 3 number for Steph will no doubt increase, so assuming he plays 2 more seasons at slightly lower level would still means at least 500 more 3s, bringing his total to 4247 when it’s all said and one. That makes his career 3s comparison to Ray Allen’s total 3s 42.9% more! Those are incredible numbers however you slice them.</p>

<p>For assists, as someone who started watching NBA in LA in 90-91, I LOVE Magic and subjectively thinks he’s the best passer. But given John Stockton has the all time assist record, I would argue he should be the reference point for best passer. Stockton’s peak season was 89-90, at 1164. The next highest per season average is actually Isiah Thomas at 1123 during 84-85 season. Magic’s best passing season was 90-91 at 989. So Stockton’s peak is only 3.7% more than the next guy (Zeke). Lebron and Jokic comes no where close on per season averages, so sure they may be more entertaining, but I argue they are not more accurate and effective passer than Stockton/Magic.</p>

<p>For total assists, it gets trickier due to Magic’s tragically shortened career. For funsies, let’s extrapolate to see how he compares. Stockton’s assist record stands at 15806. Magic is at 10141 for 13 seasons (counting his last season, since it’s comparable to other greats late career seasons). He missed 4 seasons due to his HIV status, and his career apg is 11.2. Let’s say that drops due to age and other factors (god knows those early 90s Lakers weren’t close to showtime Lakers) yet he stilled averaged 6.9 apg during 95-96, so we take the average between 11.2 and 6.9 which is 9.1. Let’s pretend he would play 65 regular season + playoff games per season (One little talked about fact about Magic is his durability aside from 2 seasons, almost mirroring Lebron, the records Magic could have, sigh). That’s 9.1 apg x 65 games per season x 4 seasons = 2366. That brings his total to 12507 conservatively, easily beating current number 2 Jason Kidd at 12091. Stockton would be 26% better than hypothetical Magic or 30% better than Kidd for career totals.</p>

<p>So to recap, Curry is 6.3% more 3s at peak (23% more efficient) and 21% more total 3s (26% more efficient) now, but likely (very conservative) 42% more total 3s when he hangs it up. While Stockton, my proposed assist reference point is 3.7% more assists at peak, and 26% more (or 30%) for total assists.</p>

<p>Putting aside who is the best passer, because it doesn’t really matter given Curry’s gap with the next best shooter, it’s clear that Curry is further ahead as a shooter.</p>

But when you combine the range (mid range to way out past the arc), his ability to create space and pull up, and his ability to make shots under heavy duress, there’s nobody even close.</p>

      <label for="li12wav" class="commentText"><p>The fact that Steph’s teammate is in the conversation for second best speaks about his skill.  You got a good shooter in the same system, and Steph is clearly better.  Unfortunately for us Klay has suffer numerous injuries in his career and simply doesn’t play at the same level anymore, but makes you wonder if Klay would still be in the conversation for second best if he wasn’t playing next to Curry.  He was my favorite warrior during that era, sucks to see him go but I hope he finds the right role and prove that he is the second best shooter to play the game.</p>

<p>Steph&rsquo;s 402 threes in a season is not gonna be broken anytime soon. No one is even close when it comes to efficiency at a high volume.</p>

<p>Although his all time three point record might be broken, but its probably cause the newer generation is chucking more threes now, and conceivably someone who plays 20+ season shooting 200-300 threes could pass him. Maybe Luka, but very unlikely still.</p>

      <label for="li09167" class="commentText"><p>True. When Steph made 402 threes, he did it on a godly 45.4% efficiency. When Harden made 378 three&rsquo;s 3 years later, he did it on 36.8% 3P%.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s how someone is going to beat Steph. Not by being hyper efficient at crazy high volume. But by being good at crazy high volume.</p>

      <label for="li07bb2" class="commentText"><p>I mean…Magic’s APG record is definitely lasting longer than Steph’s single season 3s record.</p>

<p>I do think the answer to the question is Steph though. Just not good logic.</p>

      <label for="li095y1" class="commentText"><p>Who do you think will break his record? Harden and Klay only managed to cross 300 once.</p>

<p>Magic&rsquo;s APG is kind of inflated he never played in 30s (not his fault) like Stocked played till his 40, and naturally had a decline in production.</p>

      <label for="li07bli" class="commentText"><p>Magic’s postseason assist record is pretty untouchable.</p>

<p>LeBron is #2 right now about 300 behind magic (with like 100 extra games played), so he’d need the equivalent of two more trips to the finals averaging 8 assists per game to catch magic. So it’s at least theoretically possible for him to do it but almost definitely won’t.</p>

<p>3rd is Stockton who is 500 back of Magic. Nobody else is within 1,000.</p>
