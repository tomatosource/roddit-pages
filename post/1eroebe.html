      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1eroebe/is_there_a_bigger_gap_in_ability_between_steph/"><p>Is there a bigger gap in ability between Steph and the next best shooter or Magic and the next best passer?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I think it&rsquo;s almost unanimous that Steph is the greatest shooter of all time and Magic is the greatest passer of all time. My question is, who has a wider gap between them and #2 + the rest of the pack?</p>

<p>Also, stats are important, but not the end all be all here. For instance, Klay might actually be a slightly better catch-and-shoot 3pt maker than Steph, but Steph is so far and away better at creating his own shot it&rsquo;s why he is clearly the best shooter of all time. And Magic may not hold the assist record, but you would be hard-pressed by most fans and players if you said Stockton had a similar passing ability to Magic.</p>

<p>if 3 pointers is what determines the best shooter, than wouldn‚Äôt KAT be a better shooter than Dirk?</p>

<p>who wants to live in that world?</p>

<p>furthermore, would the best shooter of all time get locked up by Kevin Love with the game on the line?</p>

<p>do mid range and post fades mean nothing?</p>

<p>and that is why Dion Waiters is the best shooter of all time</p>

<p>Dirk gotta be a top 3 shooter all time</p>

<p>I‚Äôd say Steph/Bird/Dork once you account for all types of shooting are my top 3.</p>

<p>you can easily and KD, Jordan, and even Kyrie in there if you want.</p>

<p>Kyrie is a career 40% shooter on high volume, that little elbow pull-up off the PnR is basically a bucket every time, and he has the best post fade of any dude under 6‚Äô6 in NBA history. the man is crazy but his game is üë®‚Äçüç≥üíã</p>

<p>also Mark Price needs a mention at least. man was all-NBA over prime Stockton</p>

So, any metric would have to be based on the eye test which is inherently not a great way to distinguish players when there are tons of variables.</p>

<p>Tbf, part of that is because of recency bias and most people here being 2000s born kids. All the people who unironically claim that Jokic or LeBron are better passers than Magic need to share what they&rsquo;re smoking</p>

<p>Larry bird was the best player in the 80s and i say that as a laker fan. (okay maybe magic was better, but its close)</p>

<p>The lakers were a better team, but Bird was unreal. He was the celtics best rebounder, scorer, passer (imo),  and defender on a team that won 3 titles and later in his career his back didnt exist.</p>

<p>After LBJ, Bird is the greatest SF ever, by a margin imo.</p>

<p>Bird is the better passer(significantly), rebounder and defender.</p>

<p>I value passing rebounding and defending over shooting.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t to say KD is a bum in those categories.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s a good to great defender, an above average rebounder, and a good enough passer.</p>

<p>Honestly, I probably should give KD more credit, I just don&rsquo;t think he measures up to &ldquo;The hick from french lick&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ultimately i think Larry is closer to Lebron than KD is to Bird. That&rsquo;s how good he was.</p>

      <label for="li0w21a" class="commentText"><p>Not sure if you can say so &ldquo;matter of fact&rdquo; that the lakers were a better team. I think the eastern conference was the better conference in the 80s with the 76ers early in the decade and the pistons later making it harder for Boston to consistently make it to the finals like L.A. did in the easy west. Head to head they split the first 2 series in &lsquo;84 and &lsquo;85 and in &lsquo;87 Boston had huge injury problems with McHale and Parish both limited with ankle injuries and Walton not even playing. And that series still basically came down to game 4&rsquo;s buzzer beating shot by Magic. I think the best single season team of that decade was the &lsquo;86 celtics by far. Followed by the &lsquo;83 sixers and the &lsquo;89 pistons.</p>

      <label for="li0sxo2" class="commentText"><p>The argument against Rodman would be that rebounding and defense were the only things he had to really worry about.  He could focus all his effort on those areas which a lot of other players didn&rsquo;t have to do.  In addition, there are instances of Rodman abandoning his defensive position to chase rebounds (one of the Rockets/Spurs game in one of the last possessions has Rodman chase a rebound, leaving Hakeem open to get a put-back shot).  Then, from a raw numbers perspecyive, while the pace was much higher, Wilt and Russel still blow everyone out of the water, and were magnitudes better than the other best rebounders in their era.</p>

<p>With Curry for example, he&rsquo;s not the best shooter because of his percentage, he&rsquo;s the best shooter because he&rsquo;s the 1A guy teams gameplan around, who still hits a super high percentage of his shots, including incredibly difficult shots.  Kyle Korver might have better percentages, but he&rsquo;s not having to do nearly as much as Curry, so Curry gets the nod.</p>

<p>That counts Stocktons declining years against his APG without giving him credit for the longevity. Stockton had 4 of the top 5 highest APG seasons, and the lone exception was Isiah Thomas, not Magic.</p>

<p>I will say, though, that because Magic scored himself significantly more, his passes were more often at a higher difficulty level and a lot more impressive to watch.</p>

<p>However, as good as Karl Malone was, those Jazz teams never had the kind of depth of scoring options as the Showtime Lakers and teammates&rsquo; finishing ability hugely impacted their relative assist numbers.</p>

<p>To me, Stockton is kind of the Tim Duncan of point guards. So good at the fundamentals and finding the right passes that seem easy and obvious that you could miss that he&rsquo;s one of the greatest to ever play his position. While Magic had size and athleticism at the point unlike anyone that big until, arguably, LeBron James in his point forward era. And no one, not even LeBron could pull off the kind of eye-popping circus passes that gave Magic and Showtime their nick names.</p>

<p>I take Magic as the better overall player in his prime because he offered more versatility, but Stockton as the best pure passing point guard.</p>

      <label for="li0k5sm" class="commentText"><p>I like how you said the Tim Duncan of passing because I made that exact comparison as well somewhere in this thread.</p>

<p>I think the thing I look at with Magic is, do you think he could have done what Stockton did in that offense and do you think Stockton could do what Magic did in his offense? I think the answer is yes and no. Magic wasn&rsquo;t only flash and no substance. He was fantastic at entry passes and honestly I think he could have gotten Malone an extra 2-4ppg if they played together.</p>

<p>Again, not to take away from Stockton, I just feel like while he did master the fundamentals and probably had even better decision making than some other greats in terms of passing, I just don&rsquo;t see why other great passers in his situation couldn&rsquo;t put up those same gawdy assist numbers.</p>

<p>Like you couldn&rsquo;t have Showtime without Magic, but I just don&rsquo;t know if you can say the same about the Utah Jazz&rsquo;s offense. I&rsquo;m not even sure if Nash really could run the showtime offense as effectively even though that&rsquo;s kind of the closest style of offense we&rsquo;ve seen since Showtime.</p>

He finished with a career 42.8% from 3, which is actually higher than Curry (42.6%). But of course, Nash was shooting like 3 and Curry shoots like 11 per game. Nash narrowly missed five consecutive 50‚Äì40‚Äì90 seasons by shooting at 89.9% from the free throw line during the 2006‚Äì07 season, one made free throw short of the 90% mark. I ain‚Äôt saying he‚Äôs in Curry‚Äôs league but his name is often forgotten when talking about great shooters.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching basketball for 30+ years, and you always see glimpses of a player that make you say &ldquo;man, he&rsquo;s so good, he reminds me of player X&rdquo;.</p>

<p>But when Steph really started going off, there was literally no comparison I could think of that would do his shot justice. And it&rsquo;s not just the stroke. That&rsquo;s easy to find comparisons to.</p>

<p>How little space and time he needs, the audacity of some of his shots&hellip;never seen before. Prior to Steph, a good number of shot attempts like his, would result in the coach immediately taking you out of the game, and subjected to ridicule from fans and media.</p>

<p>He might be the only player in history to take a 40-foot 3 pointer with 18 seconds left on the shot clock, and you immediately think &ldquo;well, it&rsquo;s Curry, so it&rsquo;s not a bad shot&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Magic passing skills are elite but we have seen some really jaw dropping passes in the last decade or 2 itself. Not as often as how fancy Magic was but passing skills can be copied by high IQ players and  the shooting mechanics can&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>The gap between Steph and no one else is massive compared to passing skills between Magic and most of the players who drop dimes imitiating Magic</p>

<p>Steph&rsquo;s 402 threes in a season is not gonna be broken anytime soon. No one is even close when it comes to efficiency at a high volume.</p>

<p>Although his all time three point record might be broken, but its probably cause the newer generation is chucking more threes now, and conceivably someone who plays 20+ season shooting 200-300 threes could pass him. Maybe Luka, but very unlikely still.</p>

      <label for="li09167" class="commentText"><p>True. When Steph made 402 threes, he did it on a godly 45.4% efficiency. When Harden made 378 three&rsquo;s 3 years later, he did it on 36.8% 3P%.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s how someone is going to beat Steph. Not by being hyper efficient at crazy high volume. But by being good at crazy high volume.</p>

To put that in to perspective steph never shot over 900 3s in a season. So to be 25 less while shooting about 150 more 3s and being the only player to shoot over 1000 3s at league efficiency u have to have harden volume all time in that specific yr with at worst ray Allen efficiency to beat steph record</p>

<p>I really doubt it. Magic played 190 playoff games, which is 13th most all time, and <em>averaged</em> over 12 assists per game, which is more than two over Stockton at number two (and Stockton is the only other player to average over 10).</p>

<p>Luka had 178 assists this past postseason, which led the playoffs. Magic <em>averaged</em> 180 across 13 playoff runs (and that‚Äôs including first round exits in ‚Äò81 and ‚Äò96). He had fucking 303 assists in 1988, and had five other postseasons with over 200 assists plus another with 192.</p>

<p>To catch magic Luka would have to replicate last year‚Äôs playoff run 12 more times. And Luka is the non-Lebron active player with the most realistic shot at catching magic.</p>

      <label for="li0dtea" class="commentText"><p><a href="https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/most-assists-per-game-in-playoffs-in-one-season" target="_blank">Of the top 20 single Post-Season Assists Per Game, Magic does own 8 of them</a>, with the fewest games played in one of those post-season runs being 9 games (5 post-season runs, 2 of which are from Stockton, are from 5 games or less, meaning they didn&rsquo;t even advance to the 2nd round and one outlier performance can inflate their assist numbers in such a small sample size).</p>

<p>He also has 2 Post Season runs where he averaged above 15 assists per game. For total assists in the playoffs, Magic owns spots 1-4, 6, 7-8 in the top 10 (7 out of the 10 spots). His total of 303 assists in a single post-season is likely to never be broken (next non-Magic total in assists is Rondo at 227, that&rsquo;s 13 fewer than Magic&rsquo;s 4th highest total of 240).</p>

<p>Magic&rsquo;s post-season passing numbers are prolific and while Stockton&rsquo;s APG are in shouting distance, only 2 of those 5 in the top 20 came from post-season runs with 10+ games.</p>

<p>Additionally, while Stockton is a phenomenal passer, he did run an offense that heavily relied on the PnR with Malone, which naturally resulted in low-difficulty passes turning into assists fairly frequently (just the nature of a heavy PnR offense). Obviously I&rsquo;m not trying to call Stockton a PnR merchant, but when you watch the two offenses it&rsquo;s pretty clear one offense was built around having a player that could make high difficulty passes and the other was around a player that had excellent judgment, quick release, and was a master of simple passes.</p>

      <label for="li0rmjo" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m going to disagree.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Magic was an excellent passer out of the post and many of the passes people use to show Jokic&rsquo;s brilliance out of the post are passes that Magic himself have made (Yes, he passed out of the post, he posted people up a ton due to be 6&rsquo;9&rdquo;).</p></li>

<li><p>Jokic is limited to passing out of the post and half-court set. He doesn&rsquo;t push fast breaks, doesn&rsquo;t bring the ball up, nor is he dropping dimes outside of the 3point line (very rarely he does that). Magic&rsquo;s passing can encompass every facet of the game unlike Jokic, which to me gives him the edge (and why a post player can only be so high in terms of passing ability).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The only thing I think Jokic does better than Magic in terms of passing are his touch passes and that&rsquo;s largely due to Magic really just not using them (he preferred whipping it in or using backspin on a bounce pass to achieve a similar effect as a lob in terms of leading a cutter).</p>

      <label for="li0oykm" class="commentText"><p>I used to think Magic was the best. About 3 years ago my friend pulled up Magic passing highlight videos on YT. We watched for 20 mins. Then we did the same with James. And just off my eye test, I had to go with LeBron. Magic definitely did flasher moves. But so many of LeBron passes were perfect. As in, his ability to know precisely where to put the ball so only his teammate could receive it. To threading bounces in between defenders. Just the total suite of passing ability.¬†</p>

<p>Jokic is very similar except his height allows him angles that 98% of other players don&rsquo;t have. Jokic is imo the de facto best &ldquo;touch passer&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Sometimes he barely touches the ball and simply guides/glides it in a new direction.¬†</p>

<p>Magic is in the same tier/level, don&rsquo;t get me wrong. It&rsquo;s simply that I&rsquo;ve seen James/Jokic consistently blow my mind with their work.¬†</p>

      <label for="li0qhfl" class="commentText"><p>Just out of curiosity, did you not watch highlights of Magic threading bounce passes to teammates through defenders (I think I&rsquo;ve seen Lebron throw a bullet between defenders like 4-5 times throughout his career, while Magic might do that in a single game)? Or how he would hit guys perfectly in stride? Or made the hockey assist by not holding onto the ball too long?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying you&rsquo;re wrong in terms of LeBron&rsquo;s and Jokic&rsquo;s ability (I actually might give Jokic touch passes only because that&rsquo;s not something Magic really used, kind of just whipped it in instead or would put back spin on a bounce pass so it died in front of the teammate), I guess I&rsquo;m just wondering how you didn&rsquo;t see Magic do everything LeBron has done.</p>

<p>I love LeBron, but there&rsquo;s not a single pass I&rsquo;ve seen him make that makes me think Magic couldn&rsquo;t have done it or hadn&rsquo;t done something like that already.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/bdHRCL0kM7M?t=171" target="_blank">I think the next few passes here are perfect examples of Magic&rsquo;s pinpoint accuracy and ability to thread the needle. </a></p>

      <label for="li07hcp" class="commentText"><p>Stephs shooting tbh.</p>

<p>There are a couple of guys that are comparable to Magic.</p>

<p>Whether its Stockton (who is a comparable passer imo), Nash or CP3.</p>

<p>And then you have guys like Lebron or Jokic, who will score a ton and pass. As passers they are great because thwy can also score well.</p>

<p>Id still say Magic is the best ever, but Steph is by far the best 3 point shooter ever.</p>

<p>This isnt me saying that Steph is better than Magic, but that Steph is incomparably better than the next best shooter just by the nature of the type of shooter he is.</p>

<p>A 3 point specialist wasnt something that was common before Steph came to the scene and since then, there hasnt been a guy comparable to him.</p>

      <label for="li0ah1b" class="commentText"><p>I‚Äôm going to counter the tide here and say Magic. Steph is the greatest shooter, but a lot of that is due to sheer volume of makes and his overall game.</p>

<p>How that compares to Magics assist numbers I don‚Äôt know, but I think if you compare Steph‚Äôs 25 or 100 best shots I don‚Äôt think it compares to Magics 25 or 100 best passes. Most of the best passers of all time are relatively stiff and one dimensional compared to Magic. I think Dame or Klay emulate a lot more of Steph‚Äôs shooting than Chris Paul or LeBron emulate of Magic.</p>

I&rsquo;m sorry I need a magic highlight that wowed u as much as steph shot vs okc. Steph half court shots. Steph Olympic 3 over 2 defenders. Steph moonshot over love. I think u underestimating steph wow factor on his shooting. Um Bron and jokic made some alltime great passes comparable to magic if u gonna use Dame. Klay no. He&rsquo;s not shot creating in to these shots.</p>

      <label for="li0mq25" class="commentText"><p>And people saying Jokic is better don&rsquo;t realize that Magic was making the passes Jokic does out of the post as well (he was 6&rsquo;9&rdquo;, so he would often post-up around the paint to make passes to slashers or Kareem. Those no-look behind the back passes Jokic makes out of the post, Magic already did them).</p>

<p>Also as I&rsquo;m going back and watching some more Magic film to refresh myself (seriously, I feel like I&rsquo;m taking crazy-pills with people saying Magic isn&rsquo;t the definitive best passer of all time - and I say that as someone who thinks Steph is probably a better shooter than Magic was a passer), I&rsquo;m starting to realize that a lot of his passes are kind of like hockey assists. He hits the guy in stride perfectly to shovel it to someone else. Kind of wonder what his assist tally would be if we counted hockey assists.</p>

Not the better pg or player but purely passing. I think if you put LeBron or jkidd or cp3 or several others on those Lakers they are every bit the same show time. No one even comes close to replicating Curry. Curry is like the next two best shooters (Dame and Reggie?) combined if you merged their best attributes</p>

<p>Like I&rsquo;m sorry, Kidd and LeBron DO NOT have Magic&rsquo;s passing ability. Maybe Jokic does, but since it&rsquo;s limited to the post (and Magic was excellent passing out of the post as well), he really can&rsquo;t be in the conversation given his passing is limited to the post while Magic&rsquo;s passing was all over the court from every type of position.</p>

<p>Steph has (somehow) only had ONE 50/40/90 season - 2015-2016.</p>

<p>Nash had SIX consecutive 50/40/90 seasons from 2004-2010, and averaged 51/45/91 during this 6 year stretch. He also averaged 11 assists per game during this stretch.</p>

<p>Nash peaked at 47% from 3 in the 2007-2008 season, which is higher than Steph has ever averaged. Again very different volume.</p>

<p>Career shooting numbers:
Steph - 47/43/91
Nash - 49/43/90</p>

<p>Steph is unquestionably the GOAT shooter, but I think Nash is debatable.</p>

<p>I mean players usually aren&rsquo;t attempting layups from 20ft lol. &ldquo;Shooting&rdquo; discussions have always factored in mid-range until Curry, obviously because he falls short there.</p>

      <label for="li0qosq" class="commentText"><p>Nash is not debatable against Steph</p>

<p>Steph shooting led to creating the most dominant team in the World + changing how the game was played. Nash didn&rsquo;t have this type an impact, he is in fact very far from it.</p>

<ul>
<li>you mention 50/40/90</li>
</ul>

<p>Steph did it one time at 50/45/90 with 30 PPG on 12 threes against better defenses . Nash had 18 PPG with 4 threes</p>

<p>If Steph wanted, he could be 50/40/90 a lot more often but why do it on 10 less points?</p>

<p>Also you need to account the difficulty of the shots. Night and day difference.</p>

<p>In any case it&rsquo;s always tough comparing eras since nobody was jacking up 12 threes a game 20 years ago - hard to imagine Steph would have had the career he had if he entered the league in the 90s when it was a lot slower and more physical.</p>

<p>It is interesting how Nash was a player development consultant on the Warriors during the 15-18 dynasty years.</p>

With shooting at least you have metrics like distance and if it went through or not or even how difficult the shot was etc. But how do you quantify passes? There&rsquo;s no pass info in box scores and just no way to collate the data into some comparable number. So everything is eye test and completely subjective.</p>

He was a very gifted point guard who had excellent vision, but that can be said for a lot of the players others have already mentioned in this thread. The OP is basing an entire argument on a flawed assumption. Curry is the greatest pure shooter of all time from the 3 point line and revolutionized the game; however, there are better shooters from midrange and in the paint.</p>

In terms of pure passing skills, you can make the claim that all these guys can compete with Magic as several are ahead of him in the assists leaderboard. I do understand that Magic‚Äôs career was cut short due to HIV, and he would likely be up there higher on the assists list, but unfortunately that didn‚Äôt happen.</p>

      <label for="li0tkga" class="commentText"><p>I guess I just disagree. Bird showed flashes, but he wasn&rsquo;t passing enough to compete with Magic&rsquo;s consistent volume of work. Nash simply didn&rsquo;t have the strength to make half the passes Magic could, Stockton was a meat and potatoes passer (still very good) that did benefit a lot from the heavy PnR offense he ran that allowed him to pretty much always be the final pass before a shot went up (Magic often would be the 2nd to last pass, if only we tracked hockey assists&hellip;), CP3 isn&rsquo;t as good of a bounce passer or threading the needle (largely due to his height), Luka doesn&rsquo;t have Magic&rsquo;s fastbreak playmaking ability (though I do think he&rsquo;s very close in terms of half-court playmaking like Bron), I can&rsquo;t speak to Oscar as there&rsquo;s just not enough film of him.</p>

<p>I would say his playoff assist accomplishments are enough to solidify him ahead of anyone else.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/most-assists-per-game-in-playoffs-in-one-season" target="_blank">Of the top 20 single Post-Season Assists Per Game, Magic does own 8 of them</a>, with the fewest games played in one of those post-season runs being 9 games (5 post-season runs, 2 of which are from Stockton, are from 5 games or less, meaning they didn&rsquo;t even advance to the 2nd round and one outlier performance can inflate their assist numbers in such a small sample size).</p>

<p>He also has 2 Post Season runs where he averaged above 15 assists per game. For total assists in the playoffs, Magic owns spots 1-4, 6, 7-8 in the top 10 (7 out of the 10 spots). His total of 303 assists in a single post-season is likely to never be broken (next non-Magic total in assists is Rondo at 227, that&rsquo;s 13 fewer than Magic&rsquo;s 4th highest total of 240).</p>

<p>Magic&rsquo;s post-season passing numbers are prolific and while Stockton&rsquo;s APG are in shouting distance, only 2 of those 5 in the top 20 came from post-season runs with 10+ games.</p>

      <label for="li0ta1m" class="commentText"><p>Definitely not. Magic was a great passer so this isn&rsquo;t to diminish what he was. But Luka consistently makes outlandish passes in the perfect spot, and Jokic has angles Magic never did due to his size.</p>

<p>Use Luka&rsquo;s lob pass as an example. He gets in a perfect position after a pnr with a guy on his hip, and his timing &amp; accuracy on those to rim runners is incredible. He <em>never</em> misses those passes and those are some of the toughest in the game.</p>

<p>Long distance bounce passes that go between defenders legs. Diagonal swings to skip a pass to wide open guys in the corners that literally no one on the court besides him notice. Honestly I think the only pass the Magic was better at was a fast break no look, Magic was great at those.</p>

      <label for="li0g3wt" class="commentText"><p>People massively under rating Magic&rsquo;s passing. They don&rsquo;t call Steph &lsquo;Shooter Curry&rsquo; but they call Earvin &lsquo;Magic&rsquo; because of how insane his passing ability was, like watching a magician. Having said that, it&rsquo;s really hard to say whether the gap between either and the next best is bigger for one or the other. It&rsquo;s just big for both.</p>

      <label for="li0bfdb" class="commentText"><p>It‚Äôs Magic. Every season, the gap between Steph and every other shooter is lessened. Nobody is close to Magic and it‚Äôs been like 30 years.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs look at last season. Steph was 32 in 3pt % (down year too lol, at 40.8%) and number 1 in 3 attempts per game (11.8). Luka shot 38% on 10.6 3PA.</p>

<p>McCollum was 8.5 3PA on 42.9%. Steph is the goat shooter, but the league is catching up fast.</p>

<p>Magic has 11.2 APG on his career. Stockton is a full assist behind and he‚Äôs up there as a goat. The increase in pace and the decrease in pure pass first guards is going to damper that. Maybe Luka again can take it eventually.</p>

      <label for="li0l4zk" class="commentText"><p>Last season, the average number of assists per game finally eclipsed the 80s. The era where Magic was the best passer. Haliburton (the assist leader) averaged less than magics entire career.</p>

<p>It isnt the end all metric, but it is an indication of who is making the passes that lead to scoring.</p>

<p>Unless there exists an advanced analytics that is like ‚Äúcorrect pass leading to score minus missed correct pass‚Äù, the eye test is going to be overvalued. And as someone who watched Magic Johnson, nobody has come close.</p>

<p>And, that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Steph‚Äôs greatest accomplishment is how he changed the game due to the frequency of 3PA. And the league is catching up.</p>

<p>And as someone who has, people have come close.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Agree, but it&rsquo;s because nobody has been able to replicate the absurdity of some of the shots he takes, and makes. Yes, league-wide 3PA has increased, and coaches are now more cognizant of the 3PT threat. People are running sets for 3s, picking up shooters from half court, passing to a wide open shooter instead of settle for the midrange, but no player is able to make circus shots like Steph and make them as consistently.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Which isn&rsquo;t even close as an indicator. I&rsquo;ll use one tiny reason (out of probably 10) as to why using Magic&rsquo;s APG isn&rsquo;t a good indicator. You&rsquo;re essentially penalising players for having long careers. Magic had a shortened career and so he never really played extensively when he was way past his peak. Guys like CP3, Nash, who have had very high assist numbers in their prime/peak, slowly started to fall off (because of age), and so their numbers go down, bringing their career apg down. If magic played the same number of years as other players, and experienced the physical decline like everyone else, his average would be lower than 11.2 too.</p>

      <label for="li0mzh2" class="commentText"><p>So cj is shooting steph efficiency at 2.5 less 3s per game while not being guarded like steph gotcha. U can&rsquo;t compare percentages with steph while not including the amount of attention steph commands. Steph never led the league in 3pt% but we aren&rsquo;t saying that Luke Kennard or Grayson Allen are the best shooters convo shooting 47%-50% on 3s cus their volume is low and neither commands steph level of attention.</p>

      <label for="li0tyez" class="commentText"><p>I‚Äôm not saying CJ is shooting exactly as good as Steph. I‚Äôm saying players like CJ are catching up.</p>

<p>Luka is shooting almost at Steph efficiency, at almost the same volume, while commanding the same amount of an attention. And being able to down to an open man for an assist when he gets the double more often.</p>

      <label for="li0u99l" class="commentText"><p>No he&rsquo;s not he shot less in attempts and less % than what we say a declining steph. So if u think peak Luka is up to declining steph while still shooting worse percentages how is he going to beat prime steph record at prime efficiency? U understand that nephew?</p>

<p>The OP is talking about the gap between Steph and the other shooters on the league vs the gap between Magic and the other passers. The closest analogous players would be someone like Haliburton (pass first pg) who isn‚Äôt even close.</p>

      <label for="li0k6s0" class="commentText"><p>Magic‚Äôs SIZE and FLARE is the key factor in his passing legacy.
I think his charisma and energy literally brought everyone to a higher level.
With that being said: Steph has changed the sport.
We literally look forward to The Three point Competition over The Dunk Contest. The Warriors broke the mold. An undersized team with jump shooters in perpetual motion. Steph has changed the game.
As far as charisma and from a marketing standpoint not sure anyone has ever did as much as Magic. He and Larry brought the league from The Dark Ages to the mainstream.</p>

<p>Steph routinely turns around and starts celebrating before the ball goes in. His shooting skills are in a league of their own</p>
