      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1eroebe/is_there_a_bigger_gap_in_ability_between_steph/"><p>Is there a bigger gap in ability between Steph and the next best shooter or Magic and the next best passer?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I think it&rsquo;s almost unanimous that Steph is the greatest shooter of all time and Magic is the greatest passer of all time. My question is, who has a wider gap between them and #2 + the rest of the pack?</p>

<p>Also, stats are important, but not the end all be all here. For instance, Klay might actually be a slightly better catch-and-shoot 3pt maker than Steph, but Steph is so far and away better at creating his own shot it&rsquo;s why he is clearly the best shooter of all time. And Magic may not hold the assist record, but you would be hard-pressed by most fans and players if you said Stockton had a similar passing ability to Magic.</p>

      <label for="li0wga3" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s one of those things that&rsquo;s nearly impossible to track statistically since teammate quality, the percentage they shoot, and the position they play drastically change the volume of passes that a player has performed over their career. So, any metric would have to be based on the eye test which is inherently not a great way to distinguish players when there are tons of variables.</p>

Jason Williams was the greatest passer because he made &ldquo;crazier/better&rdquo; passes. Nevermind that he was not effective or consistent.</p>

<p>if 3 pointers is what determines the best shooter, than wouldn‚Äôt KAT be a better shooter than Dirk?</p>

<p>who wants to live in that world?</p>

<p>furthermore, would the best shooter of all time get locked up by Kevin Love with the game on the line?</p>

<p>do mid range and post fades mean nothing?</p>

<p>and that is why Dion Waiters is the best shooter of all time</p>

<p>Dirk gotta be a top 3 shooter all time</p>

<p>I‚Äôd say Steph/Bird/Dork once you account for all types of shooting are my top 3.</p>

<p>you can easily and KD, Jordan, and even Kyrie in there if you want.</p>

<p>Kyrie is a career 40% shooter on high volume, that little elbow pull-up off the PnR is basically a bucket every time, and he has the best post fade of any dude under 6‚Äô6 in NBA history. the man is crazy but his game is üë®‚Äçüç≥üíã</p>

<p>also Mark Price needs a mention at least. man was all-NBA over prime Stockton</p>

      <label for="li0bko8" class="commentText"><p>i think the issue here is that steph is a current player, so his skills are up to par for the current era. magic played 40 years ago so you have to adjust for era with his skillset. i watched an entire espn classic lakers finals game the other day and those guys are clearly nowhere near as skilled, but one guy looked like a modern player- i&rsquo;m sure you can guess who</p>

      <label for="li0hfu5" class="commentText"><p>lots of people don&rsquo;t realize how good Magic and Bird were.</p>

<p>Larry bird was the best player in the 80s and i say that as a laker fan. (okay maybe magic was better, but its close)</p>

<p>The lakers were a better team, but Bird was unreal. He was the celtics best rebounder, scorer, passer (imo),  and defender on a team that won 3 titles and later in his career his back didnt exist.</p>

<p>After LBJ, Bird is the greatest SF ever, by a margin imo.</p>

<p>They basically postulated that Rodman was so so much better at rebounding than anyone else and didn&rsquo;t really hurt his team elsewhere (as long as his mentality was OK) while being elite defensively that nobody else in the NBA came close to matching what he offered, and what he offered was extremely valuable, ergo he was the most valuable player due to having the most unique useful skillset</p>

<p><a href="https://skepticalsports.com/the-case-for-dennis-rodman-guide/" target="_blank">I don&rsquo;t think this is the original article</a> but it&rsquo;s very very similar.</p>

<p>Easily the most interesting statistical case I&rsquo;ve ever read in basketball, gave me hope at the time K. Love was about to dominate everyone</p>

      <label for="li0sxo2" class="commentText"><p>The argument against Rodman would be that rebounding and defense were the only things he had to really worry about.  He could focus all his effort on those areas which a lot of other players didn&rsquo;t have to do.  In addition, there are instances of Rodman abandoning his defensive position to chase rebounds (one of the Rockets/Spurs game in one of the last possessions has Rodman chase a rebound, leaving Hakeem open to get a put-back shot).  Then, from a raw numbers perspecyive, while the pace was much higher, Wilt and Russel still blow everyone out of the water, and were magnitudes better than the other best rebounders in their era.</p>

<p>With Curry for example, he&rsquo;s not the best shooter because of his percentage, he&rsquo;s the best shooter because he&rsquo;s the 1A guy teams gameplan around, who still hits a super high percentage of his shots, including incredibly difficult shots.  Kyle Korver might have better percentages, but he&rsquo;s not having to do nearly as much as Curry, so Curry gets the nod.</p>

<p>rodman was way way way better than his peers compared to Wilt and Russell.  There were also many more missed shots available to rebound in wilt and russell‚Äôs era.</p>

If Curry didn&rsquo;t have his handles and had to play as a catch and shoot guy, his average three point attempt would be way, way further than it is now and we&rsquo;d all be talking about how he&rsquo;s the greatest shooter ever and how he&rsquo;d be in the goat conversation if he could dribble.</p>

<p>I think Steph is the best by miles, but I also think there are now players with his very same range and similar off dribble ability. I would put Dame in that range, or at least vicinity. But Steph is much better off ball. And in general Steph had higher % too.</p>

      <label for="li0882o" class="commentText"><p>People kind of double count when dismissing Stockton by arguing that Magic had a slightly higher APG (less than 1 apg delta), but Stockton racked up the higher career total by not having HIV prematurely end it.</p>

<p>That counts Stocktons declining years against his APG without giving him credit for the longevity. Stockton had 4 of the top 5 highest APG seasons, and the lone exception was Isiah Thomas, not Magic.</p>

<p>I will say, though, that because Magic scored himself significantly more, his passes were more often at a higher difficulty level and a lot more impressive to watch.</p>

<p>However, as good as Karl Malone was, those Jazz teams never had the kind of depth of scoring options as the Showtime Lakers and teammates&rsquo; finishing ability hugely impacted their relative assist numbers.</p>

<p>To me, Stockton is kind of the Tim Duncan of point guards. So good at the fundamentals and finding the right passes that seem easy and obvious that you could miss that he&rsquo;s one of the greatest to ever play his position. While Magic had size and athleticism at the point unlike anyone that big until, arguably, LeBron James in his point forward era. And no one, not even LeBron could pull off the kind of eye-popping circus passes that gave Magic and Showtime their nick names.</p>

<p>I take Magic as the better overall player in his prime because he offered more versatility, but Stockton as the best pure passing point guard.</p>

      <label for="li0k5sm" class="commentText"><p>I like how you said the Tim Duncan of passing because I made that exact comparison as well somewhere in this thread.</p>

<p>I think the thing I look at with Magic is, do you think he could have done what Stockton did in that offense and do you think Stockton could do what Magic did in his offense? I think the answer is yes and no. Magic wasn&rsquo;t only flash and no substance. He was fantastic at entry passes and honestly I think he could have gotten Malone an extra 2-4ppg if they played together.</p>

<p>Again, not to take away from Stockton, I just feel like while he did master the fundamentals and probably had even better decision making than some other greats in terms of passing, I just don&rsquo;t see why other great passers in his situation couldn&rsquo;t put up those same gawdy assist numbers.</p>

<p>Like you couldn&rsquo;t have Showtime without Magic, but I just don&rsquo;t know if you can say the same about the Utah Jazz&rsquo;s offense. I&rsquo;m not even sure if Nash really could run the showtime offense as effectively even though that&rsquo;s kind of the closest style of offense we&rsquo;ve seen since Showtime.</p>

<p>But when Steph really started going off, there was literally no comparison I could think of that would do his shot justice. And it&rsquo;s not just the stroke. That&rsquo;s easy to find comparisons to.</p>

<p>How little space and time he needs, the audacity of some of his shots&hellip;never seen before. Prior to Steph, a good number of shot attempts like his, would result in the coach immediately taking you out of the game, and subjected to ridicule from fans and media.</p>

<p>He might be the only player in history to take a 40-foot 3 pointer with 18 seconds left on the shot clock, and you immediately think &ldquo;well, it&rsquo;s Curry, so it&rsquo;s not a bad shot&rdquo;.</p>

I mean, can you name a 6&rsquo;9 point guard before Magic? Before him, players at his height would be planted down low and not handling the ball full court.</p>

He finished with a career 42.8% from 3, which is actually higher than Curry (42.6%). But of course, Nash was shooting like 3 and Curry shoots like 11 per game. Nash narrowly missed five consecutive 50‚Äì40‚Äì90 seasons by shooting at 89.9% from the free throw line during the 2006‚Äì07 season, one made free throw short of the 90% mark. I ain‚Äôt saying he‚Äôs in Curry‚Äôs league but his name is often forgotten when talking about great shooters.</p>

      <label for="li0oykm" class="commentText"><p>I used to think Magic was the best. About 3 years ago my friend pulled up Magic passing highlight videos on YT. We watched for 20 mins. Then we did the same with James. And just off my eye test, I had to go with LeBron. Magic definitely did flasher moves. But so many of LeBron passes were perfect. As in, his ability to know precisely where to put the ball so only his teammate could receive it. To threading bounces in between defenders. Just the total suite of passing ability.¬†</p>

<p>Jokic is very similar except his height allows him angles that 98% of other players don&rsquo;t have. Jokic is imo the de facto best &ldquo;touch passer&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Sometimes he barely touches the ball and simply guides/glides it in a new direction.¬†</p>

<p>Magic is in the same tier/level, don&rsquo;t get me wrong. It&rsquo;s simply that I&rsquo;ve seen James/Jokic consistently blow my mind with their work.¬†</p>

<p>Magic passing skills are elite but we have seen some really jaw dropping passes in the last decade or 2 itself. Not as often as how fancy Magic was but passing skills can be copied by high IQ players and  the shooting mechanics can&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>The gap between Steph and no one else is massive compared to passing skills between Magic and most of the players who drop dimes imitiating Magic</p>

      <label for="li04wpp" class="commentText"><p>Does Magic hold a unbreakable record in assists or something?</p>

<p>Steph&rsquo;s 402 threes in a season is not gonna be broken anytime soon. No one is even close when it comes to efficiency at a high volume.</p>

<p>Although his all time three point record might be broken, but its probably cause the newer generation is chucking more threes now, and conceivably someone who plays 20+ season shooting 200-300 threes could pass him. Maybe Luka, but very unlikely still.</p>

      <label for="li09167" class="commentText"><p>True. When Steph made 402 threes, he did it on a godly 45.4% efficiency. When Harden made 378 three&rsquo;s 3 years later, he did it on 36.8% 3P%.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s how someone is going to beat Steph. Not by being hyper efficient at crazy high volume. But by being good at crazy high volume.</p>

<p>As for Magic, I don‚Äôt think he needs any asterisk. For all we know the average could‚Äôve been higher! He got robbed of some great years and he probably would have aged like a fine wine with his size and skillset offering so much versatility.

<p>LeBron is #2 right now about 300 behind magic (with like 100 extra games played), so he‚Äôd need the equivalent of two more trips to the finals averaging 8 assists per game to catch magic. So it‚Äôs at least theoretically possible for him to do it but almost definitely won‚Äôt.</p>

<p>3rd is Stockton who is 500 back of Magic. Nobody else is within 1,000.</p>

      <label for="li0dtea" class="commentText"><p><a href="https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/most-assists-per-game-in-playoffs-in-one-season" target="_blank">Of the top 20 single Post-Season Assists Per Game, Magic does own 8 of them</a>, with the fewest games played in one of those post-season runs being 9 games (5 post-season runs, 2 of which are from Stockton, are from 5 games or less, meaning they didn&rsquo;t even advance to the 2nd round and one outlier performance can inflate their assist numbers in such a small sample size).</p>

<p>He also has 2 Post Season runs where he averaged above 15 assists per game. For total assists in the playoffs, Magic owns spots 1-4, 6, 7-8 in the top 10 (7 out of the 10 spots). His total of 303 assists in a single post-season is likely to never be broken (next non-Magic total in assists is Rondo at 227, that&rsquo;s 13 fewer than Magic&rsquo;s 4th highest total of 240).</p>

<p>Magic&rsquo;s post-season passing numbers are prolific and while Stockton&rsquo;s APG are in shouting distance, only 2 of those 5 in the top 20 came from post-season runs with 10+ games.</p>

<p>Additionally, while Stockton is a phenomenal passer, he did run an offense that heavily relied on the PnR with Malone, which naturally resulted in low-difficulty passes turning into assists fairly frequently (just the nature of a heavy PnR offense). Obviously I&rsquo;m not trying to call Stockton a PnR merchant, but when you watch the two offenses it&rsquo;s pretty clear one offense was built around having a player that could make high difficulty passes and the other was around a player that had excellent judgment, quick release, and was a master of simple passes.</p>

Unfortunately for us Klay has suffer numerous injuries in his career and simply doesn‚Äôt play at the same level anymore, but makes you wonder if Klay would still be in the conversation for second best if he wasn‚Äôt playing next to Curry.  He was my favorite warrior during that era, sucks to see him go but I hope he finds the right role and prove that he is the second best shooter to play the game.</p>

My $0.02 is there are two ways to make this comparison objectively. First is look at players respective peaks, Steph and Magic vs the next guy. Second is their entire body of work vs the next guy. You may say numbers don‚Äôt tell the full truth of how ‚Äúgood/flashy/accurate‚Äù a passer is, but I would argue that being the best passer should also mean they are consistent, and have the ability to make the right pass at the right time over and over and over again, even if it‚Äôs a simple pass. Otherwise, this is just a popularity contest with recency bias (someone could easily be influenced by seeing more Lebron/Jokic passing highlights on YT)</p>

<p>So the numbers. For Curry‚Äôs peak, 15-16 season, he shot 45.4%(50/40/90 split) on 3s with 402 make, an all time record. The next best is Harden in 18-19, 378 3s at 36.8%. That‚Äôs 6.3% more 3s, and 23% higher efficiency.</p>

<p>Curry‚Äôs career total 3s at 3747 and counting, at 42.6%. The next best is Ray Allen with 2973 3s at 40%. That‚Äôs 21% more 3s and 26% higher efficiency. The career 3 number for Steph will no doubt increase, so assuming he plays 2 more seasons at slightly lower level would still means at least 500 more 3s, bringing his total to 4247 when it‚Äôs all said and one. That makes his career 3s comparison to Ray Allen‚Äôs total 3s 42.9% more! Those are incredible numbers however you slice them.</p>

<p>For assists, as someone who started watching NBA in LA in 90-91, I LOVE Magic and subjectively thinks he‚Äôs the best passer. But given John Stockton has the all time assist record, I would argue he should be the reference point for best passer. Stockton‚Äôs peak season was 89-90, at 1164. The next highest per season average is actually Isiah Thomas at 1123 during 84-85 season. Magic‚Äôs best passing season was 90-91 at 989. So Stockton‚Äôs peak is only 3.7% more than the next guy (Zeke). Lebron and Jokic comes no where close on per season averages, so sure they may be more entertaining, but I argue they are not more accurate and effective passer than Stockton/Magic.</p>

<p>For total assists, it gets trickier due to Magic‚Äôs tragically shortened career. For funsies, let‚Äôs extrapolate to see how he compares. Stockton‚Äôs assist record stands at 15806. Magic is at 10141 for 13 seasons (counting his last season, since it‚Äôs comparable to other greats late career seasons). He missed 4 seasons due to his HIV status, and his career apg is 11.2. Let‚Äôs say that drops due to age and other factors (god knows those early 90s Lakers weren‚Äôt close to showtime Lakers) yet he stilled averaged 6.9 apg during 95-96, so we take the average between 11.2 and 6.9 which is 9.1. Let‚Äôs pretend he would play 65 regular season + playoff games per season (One little talked about fact about Magic is his durability aside from 2 seasons, almost mirroring Lebron, the records Magic could have, sigh). That‚Äôs 9.1 apg x 65 games per season x 4 seasons = 2366. That brings his total to 12507 conservatively, easily beating current number 2 Jason Kidd at 12091. Stockton would be 26% better than hypothetical Magic or 30% better than Kidd for career totals.</p>

<p>So to recap, Curry is 6.3% more 3s at peak (23% more efficient) and 21% more total 3s (26% more efficient) now, but likely (very conservative) 42% more total 3s when he hangs it up. While Stockton, my proposed assist reference point is 3.7% more assists at peak, and 26% more (or 30%) for total assists.</p>

<p>Putting aside who is the best passer, because it doesn‚Äôt really matter given Curry‚Äôs gap with the next best shooter, it‚Äôs clear that Curry is further ahead as a shooter.</p>

      <label for="li07hcp" class="commentText"><p>Stephs shooting tbh.</p>

<p>There are a couple of guys that are comparable to Magic.</p>

<p>Whether its Stockton (who is a comparable passer imo), Nash or CP3.</p>

<p>And then you have guys like Lebron or Jokic, who will score a ton and pass. As passers they are great because thwy can also score well.</p>

<p>Id still say Magic is the best ever, but Steph is by far the best 3 point shooter ever.</p>

<p>This isnt me saying that Steph is better than Magic, but that Steph is incomparably better than the next best shooter just by the nature of the type of shooter he is.</p>

<p>A 3 point specialist wasnt something that was common before Steph came to the scene and since then, there hasnt been a guy comparable to him.</p>

      <label for="li0nghd" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m as big of a Steph fan as they come, but I actually think Steve Nash is worth debating here (on much lower volume obviously).</p>

<p>Steph has (somehow) only had ONE 50/40/90 season - 2015-2016.</p>

<p>Nash had SIX consecutive 50/40/90 seasons from 2004-2010, and averaged 51/45/91 during this 6 year stretch. He also averaged 11 assists per game during this stretch.</p>

<p>Nash peaked at 47% from 3 in the 2007-2008 season, which is higher than Steph has ever averaged. Again very different volume.</p>

<p>Career shooting numbers:
Steph - 47/43/91
Nash - 49/43/90</p>

<p>Steph is unquestionably the GOAT shooter, but I think Nash is debatable.</p>

      <label for="li11jws" class="commentText"><p>Passing has been the premier component of winning basketball since the 50s in basketball. It&rsquo;s gotten an insane amount of development vs. outside shooting. Ast/TO ratio, AST per game, AST per game in playoff series all are much closer and some better than Magic for stretches than Steph and the next best shooter of all time.</p>

<p>Ray Allen has 12 seasons of 5 or more 3PA per game in his career, Steph had 12 seasons of 7.7 or more 3PA already. It&rsquo;s just too soon to say Steph has anyone near him when it comes to 3P shooting volume.</p>

      <label for="li12uc2" class="commentText"><p>Pure passing ability, Jokic and LeBron are just as good as Magic‚Ä¶even if they pass less due to more scoring responsibility. Shooting wise‚Ä¶maybe Dame is closest to Curry (in terms of hitting long threes) but the gap is larger than in passing</p>

      <label for="li15oof" class="commentText"><p>I never watched Magic play, but I watched Jason Williams play and he was the best passer i‚Äôve ever seen. Apparently he even went as far as lining up the seams for shooters when they would catch his passes on top of all the flashy things he‚Äôd do.</p>

      <label for="li166v4" class="commentText"><p>Passing&rsquo;s harder to quantify.</p>

<p>Trae Young passes immaculate dimes, but has Clint Capela on the team who barely can finish most nights. His turnover rate is more indicative of the types of passes he frequents (usually backdoor lobs and cross passes) and the assist numbers are <em>only</em> at an average of 10APG for the last 3 years because half the team can&rsquo;t buy a bucket.</p>

<p>Jason Willams has a home in every kid&rsquo;s heart who grew up on NBA Street and AND1 mixtapes, but you don&rsquo;t hear him in that same general converation as Magic. Flashy and difficult passes don&rsquo;t satisfy the analytics nerds because &ldquo;tHeYrE nOt EfFiCiEnT&rdquo;.</p>

<p>CP3 is the gold standard for the (what is now) undersized point guard. Passes well, reads the floor, makes the &lsquo;right&rsquo; decisions and plays annoying defense &ndash; but the lack of hardware means casual fans assume he&rsquo;s not as good as his reputation because ring culture is bullshit yet we keep pushing it.</p>

<p>But shooting? It&rsquo;s such an undeniable skill that immediately translates to tangible results. Passing is <em>preparing</em> a play while scoring <em>is</em> that play. Steph shattered Ray Allen&rsquo;s record for made threes and made the entire league change how they ran offenses just to match GS&rsquo;s offensive onslaught during the Death Lineup years. You can&rsquo;t break it down like you can do passing because it is a stat that depends solely on your <em>own ability to make a shot</em>. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if your teammate can&rsquo;t catch, if you&rsquo;re taking statistically improbable shots no one can comprehend, or if you don&rsquo;t have championships. Points scored divided by shot attempts is all that matters and everything else is window dressing.</p>

      <label for="li17t3e" class="commentText"><p>Just like I doubt Steph Curry&rsquo;s all time made 3&rsquo;s will ever be broken, John Stockton&rsquo;s all time assists will also never be broken. So what I&rsquo;m trying to say is Stockton was actually the best passer of all time.</p>
