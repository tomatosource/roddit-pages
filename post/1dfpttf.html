      <label for="l8lp0yp" class="commentText"><p>Embiid’s not even that bad s a playoff performer. For all the shit he gets more often than not the Sixers just have the worse team when they lose.</p>

<p>2018: 2nd year playing in the league with rookie Simmons as the 2nd best player, very very competitive series vs Boston (with best version of Al Horford) despite losing in 5. Had a broken face that made him miss playoff games. Also Bruce Brown lol (ditto thru 2020)</p>

<p>2019: miracle Kawhi shot away from OT in Game 7 against the team that won the title that year. Also had a hurt knee that made him miss end of regular season.</p>

<p>2020: Simmons injured, JRich was their 2nd leading scorer lol. Ran into a very talented Boston team that had to time to get (temporarily) fully healthy during the COVID break.</p>

<p>2021: Simmons losing all confidence in being an NBA player. Also had a knee injury that made him miss the end of the 1st round. Also Glenn Rivers (ditto through 2023)</p>

<p>2022: Had a hurt hand that made him miss games against the 1 seed Heat. Philly was 2-2 in the series when he played. Not that it’s much of an excuse but Harden was a deadline pickup too.</p>

<p>2023: hurt knee so he missed games in series against Boston. Tatum also went absolutely crazy at the end of Game 6 and then had a game 7 record. Embiid wasn’t great but Harden choked worse.</p>

<p>2024: hurt knee again, played well in spite of it. Sixers were kinda ass around him. At least he had an NBA caliber coach this time around tho.</p>

<p>Like criticize him for being injury prone I guess, but he always plays through shit and has a playoff average of <sup>25</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> on efficient scoring despite it. He deserves way less criticism than he gets.</p>

      <label for="l8lyxmf" class="commentText"><p>When you’re criticizing a guys performance when he missed the beginning of a series for injury and then a guy on the opposing team (who were better to begin with) drops an all time great 5 quarter stretch to win a series in 7… I think you’re splitting hairs a bit. He still had <sup>25</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub> with 3 blocks a game despite being very visibly hurt and facing the worst matchup in the league for him. Like yea he could’ve been better, but when <em>that’s</em> the shit series it shows where the bar is.</p>

      <label for="l8n82f4" class="commentText"><p>He had 15 points on <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>18</sub> shooting in that game. Basically didn’t score in the fourth quarter. That’s probably the worst performance by an MVP winner in an elimination game ever. How is that an unfair criticism? Remember, the Sixers won game 1 without him. I believe they won the only game he missed.</p>

<p>I would be interested to see the Vegas odds ahead of every series he lost. I feel like he’s always favored in those series. 2018 comes to mind - he was supposed to beat the Celtics without Kyrie and Hayward but lost in 5.</p>

<p>So when he you see him flopping and tripping from a slight breeze, the contrast in playstyle just ruins the moon.</p>

<p>Embiid is so big and strong, he has to overact to get the call or whistles will be silent. It’s an NBA problem</p>

      <label for="l8lhre6" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not so black and white. Yes it&rsquo;s an NBA problem that encourages foul baiting especially against bigger and stronger guys. At the same time Embiid has one of the softest whistles in the game and he abuses the fuck out of it.</p>

<p>We could waste hours talking about who&rsquo;s at fault, but it doesn&rsquo;t change the simple fact that there&rsquo;s this incredibly skilled 7ft player who gets pushed over by a gentle breeze.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t blindly hate him, but it&rsquo;s hard to respect him. The Embiid experience is being amazed for a couple of skilled games, frustrated for majority of games, mindblown by the insane statlines, then disappointment every playoff experience.</p>

      <label for="l8m0ceu" class="commentText"><p>To be honest, it&rsquo;s partially the teammates.</p>

<p>Whenever a player&rsquo;s production drops in the playoffs, it can be partially attributed to the load that a star/superstar has to carry. When the role players cannot pull their weight, defensive attention naturally shifts to the actually dangerous players. We saw this with the TWolves (Ant and KAT having a terrible series against the Mavs and their shorter, more athletic lineups) and now the Mavs (Luka is injured, but also everyone on the Celtics can hound him because Kyrie&rsquo;s struggling and no one else can create), among others.</p>

<p>The 76ers roster underwent a systematic destruction at the hand of the Colangelos and Elton Brand. They should have been a dominant franchise for a long time, but a combination of bad post-draft moves (not offloading Noel or Okafor while they had salvageable value), terrible trades (Zhaire Smith for Mikal Bridges) and signings (Tobias Harris over me???, the Horford signing), weird things happening that might have been out of their control (Fultz&rsquo;s thoracic outlet syndrome), and the whole Ben Simmons saga really screwed the franchise over.</p>

<p>In spite of that, they have made 7 straight playoffs appearances and won 5 series. Every season except for the bubble season, they played exactly to their record, i.e., they consistently lost as the 3rd seed in the 2 v 3 matchup, and their first round exits were also as the lower seed. That bubble season is probably the big stain on their track record, but it&rsquo;s also a huge asterisk because of the weird conditions that year.</p>

      <label for="l8libtn" class="commentText"><p>I know people like to lump it in with health, but I think conditioning is an entirely separate issue that he deserves a ton of flak for. Injuries happen to you, while poor conditioning is something you do to yourself. Poor conditioning also contributes to injuries.</p>

<p>There have been multiple Boston-Philadelphia series where Boston&rsquo;s successful approach was to let Embiid get his early, make him work for everything, and by the time the 4th rolls around he&rsquo;ll be too tired to be effective. And it works.</p>

<p>Good news for Doncic, no other team has figured out to do this to Embiid so maybe no other team will attack Doncic the way Boston has either.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what happens when you are not only the #1 option on offense but also the main guy on defense. He is #1 in usage while also holding the fort on defense at a DPOY level. I bet you can&rsquo;t name more than 2 players with that kind of workload.</p>

      <label for="l8l5jx7" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t see many people judge Embiid in such a black and white fashion. Most aren&rsquo;t saying &ldquo;wheres the rings&rdquo; it&rsquo;s more &ldquo;he&rsquo;s the only MVP in NBA history to never make it past the 2nd round&rdquo;. Which I think is a fair discussion point. Can you make a deep run with him as your #1 option? And that factors in many things like health and play style.</p>

<p>Brunson is right that he gets some unfair criticism, but he also gets a lot of fair speculation. Brunson is looking out for a player, but fans are just discussing the best path to a deep run. Both can be true.</p>

      <label for="l8l0ws6" class="commentText"><p>I mean there&rsquo;s a lot of good players in the league right? There&rsquo;s also a lot of teams lmao. There are 30 teams in the league and only 1 of them can win every year. And sometimes there are teams like the current Celtics or the 2010s LeBron&rsquo;s that make it close to impossible for any other teams to even make the finals and yet fans will still immediately blame players for not being good enough. I mean shit LeBron essentially gatekept the finals for the east through almost the entirety of the 2010s. And there&rsquo;s no fault for the teams/players who couldn&rsquo;t beat him, because they weren&rsquo;t supposed to. Sometimes things happen the way they are supposed to.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if Haliburton got much crap for being swept, but the Celtics were just that much better lmao. Maybe the Knicks would have picked up a game or two, but they wouldn&rsquo;t have won. The Celtics are just better, plain and simple. If your team isn&rsquo;t favored to win a series I don&rsquo;t understand how a single player can be berated for not getting to the next round.</p>

      <label for="l8m40sd" class="commentText"><p>So you understand that I&rsquo;m defending Haliburton in that statement, right? Nowhere in my reply did I even mention Embiid lmao. Please refer to the comment I replied to and you might understand where I&rsquo;m getting at</p>

<p>But if you wanna go there, yeah you are right. And Embiid has played poorly in the playoffs before. Still doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that it&rsquo;s a team game, and generally if one team is favored to win they will likely win - regardless of the accolades that a player on the other team possesses. Since 2020 I would say the only playoff series loss that can really be put on Embiid is the loss to Miami. But even then he only played 4 out of 6 games and our 2 wins came when he was on the court. His health has been what&rsquo;s killed his playoff reputation more than his play, because he has played well in some series losses.</p>

<p>One dude beating their man on every possession no matter who’s guarding him leaves an impression on the team they’re doing it to.</p>

I think it’s because players are more aware of the importance of scheme and the scope of what they control (in addition to professional camaraderie).

Losing in the 1st round as a 67 win team to an 8 seed as the regular season MVP is “worse” than anything Embiid has done from a single playoffs perspective. And this happened in back to back postseasons too. The social media slander would’ve been absurd (and it generally was in the pre-social media news cycle)</p>

<p>Embiid deserves blame but hard to blame Embiid for the team drafting Fultz and Simmons and fucking both those things up.  Trading for Tobias and then paying him max and at the same time letting Jimmy leave.  Fucking up the Harden situation.  Drafting Mikal who would have been a perfect fit for the team and city and immediately trading him.</p>

<p>While the Celtics pillage other good teams and bad teams, the Sixers pillage themselves.  Basically the only good things they’ve done during the process era were draft Embiid and Maxey.  They developed and then traded a few guys like Roco but for the most part the org has failed Embiid.  Has he failed himself at times, sure but at the top it’s been awful since the day Hinkie left.  Morey has done okay but he was basically put into a shit storm especially with the Simmons situation.</p>

<p>But some damage has already been done. Colangelo had given away assets to draft Fultz who had developed a mysterious injury already.</p>

<p>The Sixers only improved on this win total once since. Despite having so many assets and so much cap space lol. They give it all away for one year of Butler, Al Horford and Tobias Harris maxes(including a trade for the latter) and with the assets left, drafted only duds. Colangelo had 9 picks and didn’t select a single good NBA player.</p>

      <label for="l8l84qo" class="commentText"><p>Simmons yes, Fultz was a bad pick and we need to accept that. He was the so-called consensus #1 but the Celtics and Lakers wanted nothing to do with him and we still traded up for him before we even brought him in for the workout. Celtics were the only team that saw him in a private workout before the trade… this feels like a big detail that people miss…</p>

<p>On top of that, the trade-up locked up our two most valuable trade chips with the Lakers and Kings picks. Went all in on a guard that <em>decided to rework his shooting form</em> before the draft?? And that didn’t raise any alarm??</p>

<p>Conditioning Leadership</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You say this shit on every thread with Embiid lol. Your who Brunson is talking about! You said hes barely a top 10 player to me before. In your words “10-15”.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You aren’t in the locker room to talk about “leadership”. Embiids teammates have never said he’s a poor leader, therefore we cannot assume this. People do this in every sport lol, Herbert got this criticism at Oregon.</p></li>

<li><p>If his conditioning is bad, what does that make 99% of players in the league who can’t produce like him night in and night out? An MVP including two 2nd places. Huge burden on offense and defense. Philly went 31-8 with Embiid, 16-27 without. That lift in the win column hasn’t been seen since the Cavs first stint with Bron or the Wolves with KG.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>His two most significant injuries of his career were both contact injuries. Siakam elbowed him for his orbital and Kuminga fell on his leg to tear the meniscus partially this season. He is injury prone, particularly in his lower body like his foot and knees, but that’s true for everybody his size. The things that have derailed his playoff runs have been outside of his control.</p>

<p>I’m not even going to address foul baiting, because that’s just a common part of every great scorers game at this point. MJ, Dwade, Harden, Karl Malone, Lebron all drew fouls at an extremely high rate. How they get them doesn’t matter. It’s more understandable for a walking mismatch to get them anyway.</p>

He leads the league in usage and he also anchors the Sixers defense. That&rsquo;s too much responsibilities for a guy his size and with his injury history. How many players right now are their team&rsquo;s number 1 offensive option while also the anchor of their defense? Probably just him.</p>

His efficiency plummeted and his D wasn&rsquo;t bad but it wasn&rsquo;t elite like last year. I look forward to him going back to being 3rd option so he can focus on D again, being the anchor and number 1 option was just too big of an ask for him.</p>

<p>Then the 1st first quarter of game 1 happens and Embiid had like 14 points in 12 minutes. Right then I literally thought the series was over, we couldn’t stop him.</p>

<p>When he is at his best Embiid is the most unstoppable player in the NBA right now. The problem with him is getting him to play at his peak for 40 minutes a game for 16 wins in the playoffs</p>

      <label for="l8m3htt" class="commentText"><p>I don’t know how fair this question is. If the Sixers are consistently worse than the opponents, why is Embiid separated from the fact that the Sixers are consistently the worse team? It simultaneously gives him kudos for ultimately being unsuccessful, while blaming his teammates for the same failures</p>

<p>I know he’s head and shoulders above his teammates and an elite+ player, but this seems like a kid-gloves treatment of an MVP that many other stars don’t get</p>

I guess you can see it Like if you were to remove Embiid from the sixers, and the other best player from other teams. The sixers would be a worse team relative to other playoff teams without their number 1. Like you a Celtics fan, idk who u think is better but either one or Tatum of brown sits yall would still kill the embidless sixers.</p>

<p>No one can deny his talent/skill/dominance but his health has become a serious concern. Can anyone really see him making it through a full playoffs-finals run? That sparks some of the more wild convos about him (trading him, focusing on maxey, etc) that people perceive as unfair.</p>

The way he <em>can</em> play is entertaining/impressive but the way he wins isn’t entertaining or fun to watch. It’s especially not fun for someone simply spectating. I think for players, they’re a bit less critical because I’m sure there’s still some sort of challenge trying to play around the foul baiting (and they all foul bait to an extent).</p>

      <label for="l8m1zan" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s trying to stick up for Embiid, but really just underlined why he gets criticised. Embiid has a bunch of individual accolades, but hasn&rsquo;t won when it matters. Obviously he&rsquo;s an impressive dude by the numbers, and even watching him on the floor when he&rsquo;s healthy, but that doesn&rsquo;t counterbalance not winning in the playoffs. That&rsquo;s the whole point of the criticism (similar to Harden): you don&rsquo;t get as much credit for your individual stuff if it doesn&rsquo;t elevate the team.</p>

      <label for="l8mhmhn" class="commentText"><p>Joel is a great player no doubts about that but his game is just not fun to watch. Constant foul baiting, free throws on every possession. It’s not his fault but it’s not helping him either</p>

      <label for="l8n03q0" class="commentText"><p>As a knicks fan, I won&rsquo;t deny Embiid was visibly dominant in that playoff series. There was literally nothing we could do to stop him. And if the right things click he will no doubt make a run at a championship. I don&rsquo;t even hold it against him that he hasn&rsquo;t made it passed the first round, winning is hard in the NBA.</p>

<p>However, he injured himself on an insane windmill dunk attempt for no reason. Tried to end Mitchell Robinsons season out of frustration of a no call. Foul baited in the wrong moments and settled for jumpers in the others. It was a mess and frustrating as hell to watch as an basketball fan. This is why I think people don&rsquo;t give him the credit he probably deserves.</p>
