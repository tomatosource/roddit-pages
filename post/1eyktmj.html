      <label for="ljechlm" class="commentText"><p>Who on the young core was unfocused? From all accounts to my knowledge, Kobe was cool with Randle, Lance, Clarkson, heck even legend Robert Sacre. They weren’t amazing players by any means especially at the time, but they put in the effort.</p>

<p>The only player really was D’lo, who later admitted himself that he didn’t take his rookie year seriously at all and that he wasn’t used to the vet type style of scheduling your own workouts, and that it wasn’t until he was traded to the young Nets who had a more college style structured practice, that he started taking practices and workouts more seriously. I think assistant coach Brian Shaw was caught on a hot mic saying D’lo isn’t serious.</p>

<p>Probably too late against the hate thread but Kobe didn’t hate players because they were bad, but because he felt that they didn’t put in the effort or time to improve. Weird how this sub always badmouths players who put in the minimum effort to get their paycheck, but then used Smush fucking Parker as the lead of their cause lol</p>

      <label for="lje9u4i" class="commentText"><p>Tbf this is a slander thread so the narrative is that Kobe is a confidence killer, but the house knows Kobe outworked everyone in the gym.  I used to hate Kobe but his work ethics were second to none.</p>

<p>If anything it&rsquo;s also possible that after watching Kobes dedication to the game, maybe that&rsquo;s what transformed their ethics and game.  Sometimes you need a vet to do the work to think &ldquo;oh shit, we gotta do more than practice. It&rsquo;s a 24 hour gig from food intake to sleep.&rdquo; Think about all the wasted talent that could have been, has they studied and embraced the game the way Kobe did.</p>

<p>Certainly Kobe isn&rsquo;t celebrating a win on tv after a 8 game losing streak. Why should you?</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s probably the vet you need. You don&rsquo;t love him, and unfortunately he&rsquo;s an asshole about it, but some young hardheads probably needed some military molding, and its effective (imo) when they are a leader by example.</p>

You can lead by example work hard and challenge others respectfully if you don&rsquo;t think they are working hard enough. But all this other nonsense is straight up bullying and if we can&rsquo;t point that out then all we&rsquo;re doing is justifying childish behavior and making excuses for the guy.</p>

<p>Kobe/Mj&rsquo;s way of dealing with people show incredible emotional immaturity. As great as they were as players they were fundamentally weak in this regard and were clearly lacking empathy. There is more than one way to lead.</p>

<p>Steph Curry and Tim Duncan have proved that you can be a great player, the hardest worker and still be emotionally intelligent enough to elevate everyone around you through positive reinforcement. Have you ever heard of stories like this about them?</p>

It&rsquo;s well-documented that Kobe was an exceptionally hard worker who also felt the best way to be a &lsquo;leader&rsquo; was to frequently be a mean and ruthless dick to his teammates. Obviously it worked to a point&ndash; Kobe&rsquo;s one of the most successful players of all time and his &lsquo;mamba mentality&rsquo; is still glamourised years after his unfortunate passing&ndash; but his Hollywood brand rehabilitation was cut short due to his untimely death and this is just where we&rsquo;re gonna be now&hellip; in a spot where we&rsquo;re always gonna have to weigh the glory of his accomplishments against a lot of anecdotes about the fact that despite charming post-career interviews and media appearances Kobe was all too often kind of an unlikeable turd.</p>

      <label for="ljehzpl" class="commentText"><p>Sure, but the narrative that people spin is that Kobe literally had no chance to win those first 2 without Shaq. I’d argue there are several players who’d be in the same boat. Steph was great but without Iggy’s defense they probably lose to an already depleted Cavs team in 2015. But in both cases, people don’t look past the surface</p>

<p>Players wanting to workout with him isnt the same as him not being a great vet in the locker room..</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think more than anything it depends on the player in question. Someone that meshes well with Kobes no nonsense, win at all costs mentality might work. But guys that arent super hardcore like Shaq or Dwight (for instance) dont work well.</p>

<p>He holds people to the same standards as himself and though it sounds good, keep in mind this is the same man that cut the amount of hours he sleeps so he could train more and trained more than anyone else, even though most profesionals would tell you that isnt healthy or gonna help.</p>

<p>On the technical side of things though, Kobe is elite. Hell maybe even one of the best vets out there. But just not gonna fit with a lot of guys.</p>

With the Bulls he seemed to go out of his way to make sure the young guys felt welcome. He traveled with Ayo Dosunmu when he was a rookie to see his college jersey retirement, he was always buddying up with Dalen Terry on the road, etc.</p>

<p>So I think a guy like Derozan learned some things from Kobe like the importance of a strong work ethic (which Demar himself credits Kobe for) but decided the dickhead type stuff that Kobe would do wasn&rsquo;t really necessary.</p>

<p>The problem is that the player he idolized most was MJ, who was also a Grade A asshole and was lionized for it in part due to the era, so Kobe wanted to be like him and expected to be revered for it, and largely was because like MJ, he was really fucking good at basketball. He did not have MJ&rsquo;s charisma though, not even close. He was much more of a loner and isolated himself which is why he had trouble with teammates for most of his career because he did his own thing, but consistently acted like he was above everybody else.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not really great when it comes to bonding with your teammates, players respected Kobe, especially they respected how hard he worked, but I doubt many of them ever wanted to hang with him.</p>

<p>May be an unpopular opinion, but I think we&rsquo;ve seen a bit of a paradigm shift over the last 20 years in terms of the way people are motivated, in the old days it used to be your superiors would motivate you through fear and intimidation, but I think that has changed because now all that does in this current world is breed apathy. Positive reinforcement and uplifting does far more in terms of trying to reach the individual and get them going in the direction you&rsquo;d like.</p>

      <label for="ljehcuz" class="commentText"><p>Honestly it was partly due to the (relative) lack of charisma, but a bigger part of it was just the way the internet, sports technology, and sports reporting evolved. It was a bit easier for the reality of Jordan as a person&ndash; that he&rsquo;s generally a miserable piece of shit&ndash; to be hidden for much of his earlier career than it ever was for Kobe in a period of twenty-four hour access, YouTube, social media, and sports reporting that comments on his behaviors every hour of every day. Like, think of the recent story that came out about how Jordan colluded with the Bulls&rsquo; statkeeper to falsify his defensive stats so he could win DPOY. That wouldn&rsquo;t have even been <em>possible</em> during Kobe&rsquo;s career. It&rsquo;s like going from the NBA being a job you could kinda go home from at the end of the day to playing in a bubble against the eye of Sauron.</p>

He heard all the chatter, probably saw some truth in them, and was insightful enough to understand what was fair, why they were said, and realized at the end of the day they’re both human and can work it out.</p>

<p>Kobe just doesn’t suffer fools and lazy people. In the later years when coaching, personel, and his own limitations were worse off, he was definitely frustrated again</p>

      <label for="ljefkad" class="commentText"><p>You could also say he pushed Shaq and got the best out of him. Without Kobe and his mentality there&rsquo;s a huge chance shaq ends up ringless and forgotten. Shaq was overweight and consistently struggled with his work ethic. Shaq was a 7&rsquo;2 Zion Williamson until Kobe came around.</p>

<p>Honestly ask yourself if Kobe would benefit Zions career had they been teammates. It&rsquo;s either Zion would max out his potential or flame out completely. Instead he&rsquo;s had weight issues, hasn&rsquo;t won anything and is a strip club legend. Kobe would be the perfect teammate for Zions career, and the worst friend for Zion, just like Shaq.</p>

<p>But the bar for a civil trial is quite a bit lower than that of a criminal trial. That doesn’t mean to throw out the result as your burden of belief, just that there is an area between “Kobe is completely innocent” and “Kobe is a violent rapist” that this could definitely fall into where she still absolutely deserves that judgement awarded.</p>

<p>We could also say that the bar for criminal proceedings is quite a bit higher, and frame it as &ldquo;kobe is somewhere between likely a rapist and definitely a rapist&rdquo;. Him being &ldquo;completely innocent&rdquo; is nowhere on the table, lol.</p>

<p>Not speaking to teammates at all and ghosting them for no reason is just childish.</p>

<p>And maybe the younger were soft like charmin but as the captain its your job to build them up and instill confidence in them and not let them get big headed.</p>

<p>Roy Keane could be an asshole to players but only if they weren&rsquo;t performing up to standards or they weren&rsquo;t focused. If you were putting the work in he would treat you fairly.</p>

      <label for="ljegek4" class="commentText"><p>These days, with highlights and everything going on with sports (especially with the NBA) it&rsquo;s our duty to not forget how awful Kobe was as a person.</p>

<p>Especially the whole Mamba Mentality thing: very good for basketball, awful for almost everything else in life.</p>
