      <label for="l98zr6a" class="commentText"><p>Yes, OP going on about narrative but Jaylen has gotten demonstrably better. He was decisive on offense, looked better on defense consistently than we’ve ever seen from him in the playoffs. Of course the discourse around his play is going to change. Narrative would be if he was static from last year to this year and people changed their tune. Instead he played better and gets better press</p>

      <label for="l990pyl" class="commentText"><p>It’s also a team game and the team got a lot better. Last season opponents would put <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> on Tatum and then 1.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> on Brown. On this team you really can’t double both of them anytime. Celts couldn’t win last night with Brown being finals MVP and only putting up 20. This year they could blow out the Mavs. He had to do less this year, but did better at the fewer things he had to do.</p>

      <label for="l98yofd" class="commentText"><p>thats what happens when you&rsquo;re on the better team, you tend to win. Boston drafted high character guys and made good teams. This shows drafting high character people is the most important and not immature dumb dumbs like most of em. my 76ers taking Ben Simmons and Chick Fil A Fultz, and Evan Turner, and just about everyone we drafted was all terrible character draft picks..it matters.</p>

<p>couldn’t be happier that he had the postseason he had. dude works as hard as anyone in the league and the way he played this season is proof that he spent all of last summer locked in the gym getting better after that Miami series</p>

      <label for="l990slj" class="commentText"><p>People are prisoners of the moment, to be sure. He definitely deserves to have his defensive rep raised, but he didn’t prove much more on offense. The Celtics had to pay him, given their situation, but he hasn’t shown himself to be worth that much to other teams. He averaged 21, 5, and 5 on bad-to-mediocre efficiency and great defense in the finals. If the Celtics as a whole weren’t so much better than the Mavericks, people wouldn’t say he’s a &amp;gt;$55 million/year player. If you watched them during the regular season, you know White and Porzingis were more important, on a per-game basis.</p>

      <label for="l98y6su" class="commentText"><p>JB is so fun to have on your team bc you know he’ll constantly get slandered and constantly prove it wrong. He was slandered as a pick saying drafted too high, then he was slandered on his <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>104</sub> saying he’s a glorified role player not worth 25m, then he was slandered on his super max saying he’s overpaid and doesn’t deserve it. Every single time he’s come out and absolutely destroyed the narrative. He’s an all-nba caliber, clutch, two way player. I will not doubt anything contractual ever in his career, it seems like a guaranteed way to look dumb.</p>

For game-watchers, the Celtics didn’t average some huge blowout. The Mavericks had an unusually-bad distribution of good play.   
For a game-watcher, he was about as good as expected, but worse than his Reddit/ESPN reputation. The Celtics have a lot of good players and the Mavs played really bad in most games.  </p>
