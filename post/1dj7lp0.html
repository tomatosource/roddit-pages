      <label for="l98zr6a" class="commentText"><p>Yes, OP going on about narrative but Jaylen has gotten demonstrably better. He was decisive on offense, looked better on defense consistently than we’ve ever seen from him in the playoffs. Of course the discourse around his play is going to change. Narrative would be if he was static from last year to this year and people changed their tune. Instead he played better and gets better press</p>

      <label for="l990pyl" class="commentText"><p>It’s also a team game and the team got a lot better. Last season opponents would put <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> on Tatum and then 1.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> on Brown. On this team you really can’t double both of them anytime. Celts couldn’t win last night with Brown being finals MVP and only putting up 20. This year they could blow out the Mavs. He had to do less this year, but did better at the fewer things he had to do.</p>

      <label for="l996aw0" class="commentText"><p>This is true. But the trajectory was clear, especially to Brad Stevens, who had coached him. Every year he&rsquo;s gotten better. Every year he needed to improve on x aspect of his game. And every off-season he put in the work to do just that. Dude is willing and able to put in the work, and I don&rsquo;t see a problem with rewarding that</p>

      <label for="l990slj" class="commentText"><p>People are prisoners of the moment, to be sure. He definitely deserves to have his defensive rep raised, but he didn’t prove much more on offense. The Celtics had to pay him, given their situation, but he hasn’t shown himself to be worth that much to other teams. He averaged 21, 5, and 5 on bad-to-mediocre efficiency and great defense in the finals. If the Celtics as a whole weren’t so much better than the Mavericks, people wouldn’t say he’s a &amp;gt;$55 million/year player. If you watched them during the regular season, you know White and Porzingis were more important, on a per-game basis.</p>

      <label for="l99gn4u" class="commentText"><p>First off he got paid exactly what he HAS to get paid after making the all nba team the prior season. Any team in the league with supermax cap space on the market for a superstar would have scooped and paid him the same supermax happily. Going by averages, in the 5 game championship winning series is a casual uneducated evaluation of a player who just gave max effort on both ends and played well enough on both ends to win a fucking championship. Point totals go down in the finals damn near every season and the Celtics have 5 starters who are all elite scorers. Winning takes sacrifice chief where the only goal in each players mind needs to be to win. Jaylen just accomplished that feat and earned the finals mvp. That is the pinnacle of this sport.</p>

      <label for="l99gc7n" class="commentText"><p>Jaylen Brown seems like he just got better and his strengths were more apparent with the addition of very good role players that improved Boston&rsquo;s offensive flow without hurting their team defense.</p>

<p>But, his decision-making on offense seems like it improved and his defense got better even after already being really good.</p>

<p>His finishing was unlocked to a greater extent as well. Boston had a roster with near-perfect spacing from adding better/more 2-way guys that can shoot and score off-ball without sacrificing anything on the other end.</p>

<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ll give him credit. Team&rsquo;s couldn&rsquo;t just take him out of his game by forcing him left. I know he also had injuries last year that impacted that. But, still, teams couldn&rsquo;t just swarm him when he was forced to that side of the court and hope to take him out of his offense with a turnover or a bad shot, which he also did do at times when he wasn&rsquo;t dribbling off someone&rsquo;s foot.</p>

<p>Where his improvements end and the team&rsquo;s overall improvements begin makes these finals kind of interesting.</p>

<p>Neither Brown or Tatum put up ridiculous numbers on fantastic efficiency in the finals. They played their roles as well as they could by being the focal points of the offense and setting everyone else up, without being huge liabilities with the ball when their offense wasn&rsquo;t exactly great. And sometimes that&rsquo;s all it takes: limiting your mistakes and making sure other players stay involved and get good looks when teams rotate because of your game with the ball in your hands.</p>

<p>It also just goes to show that you don&rsquo;t need an insanely good offense from your top guys if your defense is effective and your role players can keep the offense from getting stagnant. Tatum and Brown benefitted from everyone else the Celtic&rsquo;s added just as much as those guys benefitted from Brown and Tatum drawing defensive attention.</p>

      <label for="l994ca4" class="commentText"><p>He had a great series defensively. He also played 38.6 mpg. Him not scoring a super high amount was because he shot very poorly. For game-watchers, the Celtics didn’t average some huge blowout. The Mavericks had an unusually-bad distribution of good play.   
For a game-watcher, he was about as good as expected, but worse than his Reddit/ESPN reputation. The Celtics have a lot of good players and the Mavs played really bad in most games.  </p>

      <label for="l98y6su" class="commentText"><p>JB is so fun to have on your team bc you know he’ll constantly get slandered and constantly prove it wrong. He was slandered as a pick saying drafted too high, then he was slandered on his <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>104</sub> saying he’s a glorified role player not worth 25m, then he was slandered on his super max saying he’s overpaid and doesn’t deserve it. Every single time he’s come out and absolutely destroyed the narrative. He’s an all-nba caliber, clutch, two way player. I will not doubt anything contractual ever in his career, it seems like a guaranteed way to look dumb.</p>
