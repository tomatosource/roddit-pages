      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1diuj5z/the_2024_boston_celtics_joined_the_1996_bulls_and/"><p>The 2024 Boston Celtics joined the 1996 Bulls and 2017 Warriors as the only teams to finish top 5 all time in both Net Rating and Simple Rating System (SRS). All 3 won championships.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Cool nugget I found.</p>

<p>SRS takes into account point differential <em>and</em> strength of schedule, while Net Rating is just how many points you outscore (or are outscored by) your opponent per 100 possessions. They are both considered to be good indicators of who&rsquo;s a real contender.</p>

<p>The 1996 Bulls are 1st all time in Net Rating (+13.4) and 2nd all time in SRS (11.80) behind the 1971 Bucks.</p>

<p>The 2017 Warriors are 3rd all time in Net Rating (+11.6) behind the 1997 Bulls and 4th all time in SRS (11.35) behind the 1972 Lakers.</p>

<p>The 2024 Celtics are 4th all time in Net Rating (+11.6) just behind the 2017 Warriors and 5th all time in SRS (10.75) also behind the 2017 Warriors.</p>

<p>By all statistics they are an all time great team.</p>

Shai is a well-liked exciting player. My point had nothing to do with the Thunder and just to do with people not liking the Celtics or the city of Boston. The Orlando Magic with this exact roster is not getting as much &ldquo;hate&rdquo; or discredit.</p>

<p>Perhaps that comment by Jason Kidd <em>did</em> bother Jayson Tatum and the Celtics just have better opsec. ü§î</p>

      <label for="l969lpx" class="commentText"><p>I feel like this formula is flawed. For instance, it doesn&rsquo;t factor in half court shots and broken teeth, which should easily be rewarded additional points. (This is sarcasm.)</p>

      <label for="l96g82i" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s funny how all the stats said this team would romp through the playoffs, and many fans and pundits still doubted them. Didn&rsquo;t 9 out of 17 ESPN pundits pick the Mavs in the Finals? <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/40279206/2024-nba-finals-predictions-celtics-mavericks-series-mvp" target="_blank">(Yes, they did.)</a></p>

<p>Ten possible reasons people doubted the Celtics despite the stats:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Celtics didn&rsquo;t have a top three MVP candidate.</li>
<li>The Celtics came up short many times in recent years, including getting upset by the 8 seed Heat just last year. They had a reputation as chokers.</li>
<li>The East seemed like the easier conference during the regular season so people discounted the Celtics&rsquo; historically-great regular season stats.</li>
<li>The Celtics&rsquo; Eastern Conference opponents suffered key injuries during the playoffs, so people discounted the Celtics&rsquo; relatively easy victories on the road to the Finals.</li>
<li>Porzingis was injured, as usual. Even if he returned, people thought he would be rusty and likely to get injured again. (And in fact he did get injured again and it didn&rsquo;t matter.)</li>
<li>People were deceived by the Mavs&rsquo; success in the West, which was supposed to be the more competitive conference. In particular, in the Western Conference Finals the Timberwolves, who¬†had the best¬†defensive rating¬†by a team this season, seemed helpless against the Mavs&rsquo; offense.</li>
<li>People didn&rsquo;t realize Luke Doncic&rsquo;s calf strain would hobble him throughout the playoffs. (To his credit, Doncic has not used this as an excuse.)</li>
<li>Because the Celtics share scoring duties, their individual players look less dominant than they are. Similarly, because they are all good defenders, they didn&rsquo;t have a top three Defensive Player of the Year candidate.</li>
<li>Wishful thinking by fans and pundits who hate the Celtics or their fans.</li>
<li>Wishful thinking by neutral fans and pundits who wanted a competitive Finals. (This is my excuse.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Can you think of any others reasons?</p>

<p>This was a real factor and could have become a problem. Doesn&rsquo;t fit with a lot of your narrative reasons listed and was not &lsquo;despite the stats&rsquo;.</p>

      <label for="l96lqff" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s true that even noted Boston Celtics homer Bill Simmons expressed worry about how the Celtics would play in the Finals if Porzingis was injured. So yes, it was a reasonable concern.</p>

      <label for="l96d7jk" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s fine man, there&rsquo;s nothing that I could say to convince you otherwise.</p>

<p>My case is simply the win total, the net rating, the SRS and going 16-3 in the playoffs while missing their 2nd or 3rd best player for 3/4ths of the playoffs.</p>

<p>Only 3 teams ever finished top 5 in net rating and SRS. They&rsquo;re one of them.</p>

<p>They completely dogwalked a Mavericks team that made the team that beat the defending champs look like the Wizards.</p>

<p>A Mavericks team that post deadline played at a 67 win pace when accounting for opponent quality, 2nd to only the Celtics who played at a 71 pace during that time.</p>

<p>Sure they got blown out before their closeout win, but so did other all time teams like the 96 Bulls and 00 Lakers.</p>

<p>But again, I know there&rsquo;s nothing I could say that would change your mind even with all statistical evidence.</p>

<p>Are they as good as the ‚Äò96 Bulls or ‚Äò17 Warriors? No. But its not a crazy take to call them a top 10-15ish team ever.</p>
