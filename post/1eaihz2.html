</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>As the title says.</p>

<p>Lebron is looking amazing as ever, but perhaps the exhibition games for the Olympics got everyone looking at Lebron at a whole different perspective. He doesn’t have to exert as much energy with a loaded roster and is now able to put team USA on his back.</p>

<p>For the whole regular season, I would take Jokic, Luka, and Giannis over Lebron for their age and ability to play more minutes. For the playoffs only, I would take Jokic, everyone else is debatable to me.</p>

<p>What do yall think?</p>

      <label for="lelz7to" class="commentText"><p>another way to approach this question would be to ask: “on how many teams would LeBron be the number one option, especially in the playoffs&rdquo;?</p>

<p>it’s similar to asking, a couple years ago, on how many NFL teams with Tom Brady have been the undisputed QB1 option?</p>

<p>In both cases, I think the answer would be “most of them&rdquo; but figuring out out the cut off is what makes these questions fun to contemplate.</p>

<p>If you had Lebron on rosters like say, the Celtics, are you really taking the ball out of his hands?</p>

<p>The Nuggets have Jokic, but Lebron would work so well off of him he still likely is the top scoring option.</p>

<p>He is not averaging more points and getting more looks than Steph, Luka, KD, Giannis, and probably not Shai, maybe not Ant, and maybe not Jokic.
Even on his current team he’s not always the #1 scoring option. AD is within 1 ppg.</p>

      <label for="lem6q4m" class="commentText"><p>It’s kind of a hard question to answer for some teams because their makeup changes so radically. Like on the Bucks he’d clearly be behind Giannis as a scoring option, but he might also take fewer shots than Lillard on our team depending on the system we run. But at the same a Lillard/LeBron/Giannis fit is <em>weird</em> and if Lillard’s still got value I could see him being traded away in that scenario. Certainly well before we looked at moving either of the other two.</p>

<p>I don’t see lebron being especially good for any roster right now as he has never really been thr great “player coach” he insists on playing, and his head is in too many places. Like when he was without a doubt the best active player in the nba it was a no brainer as he could carry a team to a championship on his own. Now he’s struggling to carry a team to the playoffs.</p>

<p>Most of them maybe. Out of 29 other teams I will easily say there are 15 or more that you would rather have Bron than other stars. But just looking at basketball wise you didn&rsquo;t want Lebron as 1st option if you want to win a chip. I think that window completely closed after the bubble, which indeed was already an exceptional feature, also because that team was loaded (and with AD being another top 5 player out there).</p>

Like you can make arguments for almost everyone else, but he&rsquo;s the guy with the experience and if placed on random teams he can be the difference between chip or bust.

This year it&rsquo;s because he and Brown sacrificed their numbers so that KP, Jrue and even White, could get more touches. I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s a slam dunk to have him over LeBron, but it&rsquo;s close.</p>

<p>Tatum #s from 3rd season in the league to last year in playoffs: 27/9/6 on 44/37/84 splits. 58% TS. Those are pretty good numbers.</p>

<p>LeBron&rsquo;s numbers in those same seasons in playoffs: 26/10/8 on 53/33/73 splits. 59% TS. Equally great numbers.</p>

<p>Like I said, not crazy to pick him.</p>

<p>For the playoffs, my top 3 is Jokic / Luka / Lebron.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t this a bit too biased considered Bron really didn&rsquo;t do anything exceptional past 3 playoffs run he had? I mean he was good for sure, but not on same level as other all nba guys, not better than Luka, Giannis, Jokic, Curry, KD, Tatum, Butler, Brunson, SGA, maybe AD and PG (even if last playoffs&hellip;) too.</p>

<p>So don&rsquo;t see this huge taking Lebron over someone else for the playoffs for the future for sure.</p>

<p>That said, the context is important:</p>

<p>In 2023, he was coming off a torn foot tendon that he probably shouldn’t have played on</p>

<p>In 2021, he had the worst injury to date -&amp;gt; Solomon hill high ankle sprain</p>

<p>I thought he was exceptional this playoffs, albeit a sample size of 5 games. I think his 24 playoffs are looked at poorly because of AG dunks and what not which lebron definitely had a role in not arguing that</p>

<p>The brief playoff performances we’ve gotten against the Nuggets have been elite, but they’ve been just that, brief. Hes still one of the 5 best offensive players i’d say.</p>

<p>There is much more that goes into basketball thab only stats. There is almost infinitely huge gap in maturity and leadership between Doncic and Lebron. Otherwise I would also pick Doncic first. Maybe in a few years compared to this year Lebron. Hopefully.</p>

      <label for="lem227f" class="commentText"><p>My god. He has been in the playoffs for four straight seasons and has lost in the first round 3 times and was swept in the conference finals once. He plays with second team All NBA AD you guys picking no one or less than 3-5 people are out of your damned minds. He’s incredible for his age but he is not best player on a title team anymore unless there is no regular season or 7 game series and it’s a one game winner take and then yeah maybe…</p>

<p>Outside of that dude is just an incredible guy for his age with unreal longevity.</p>

<p>AD is the best player on the lakers now and the lakers won 2 playoff series in the last 4 years lmao.</p>

<p>for the playoffs, i can argue 10 more fringe players, but at a minimum, there&rsquo;s absolutely no way you take lebron over jokic or luka.</p>

      <label for="lem10wt" class="commentText"><p>AD is better most of the time. And I think that Luka and Jokic win out almost every time vs Lebron at this stage of his career, but to see him win one more as an underdog would be too sweet to pass up.</p>
