</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>The Bucks and Celtics made moves to improve their roster after both lost to the Heat in the playoffs, the Bucks won the title the very next year, and the Celtics are 1 game away from winning the title this year. Meanwhile the Heat ran it back after deep runs in 2020, 2022 and 2023. The result is now the Heat going ringless in the Butler/Bam era and now they might trade Butler. Just shows the difference in between being non-complacent like the Bucks and Celtics which results in a title and being complacent like the Heat which results in going ringless with your 2 stars.</p>

<p>Now Jimmy is gonna be a year older. He already doesn&rsquo;t give a fuck about the regular season, putting them in contention for the play in every year. And he already seemed to fall off a little bit.</p>

<p>While Donovan Mitchell looks like he&rsquo;s gonna re-sign in Cleveland. As of now they have no options to get them over the hump.</p>

      <label for="l8go4ch" class="commentText"><p>the biggest move they made was going into the 2022 season after adding Lowry and PJ Tucker, and hoping Oladipo would recover from injury. The 2022 team ended up getting the 1 seed and if Jimmy hits that 3 vs Boston, I think they matched up well against GS and who knows what would have happened, but that&rsquo;s not how things played out so it&rsquo;s seen as a failure.</p>

<p>It’s not a dig to the teams who won because they don’t get to choose who they play. The Celtics beat the Heat without their star just the Heat beat the Bucks without their star.</p>

<p>You don’t see anyone bragging about how this years victory over the Heat proves anything, just like the comment I responded to is dumb for saying the Heat embarrassed the bucks as proof the Heat were better like there wasnt a giant injury that changed the series.</p>

      <label for="l8gii2m" class="commentText"><p>Obviously still hurt, if Celtics fans can hold a 28pt game form Jimmy to say his ankle wasn’t fucked, then I think Giannis back was fine considering he dropped 40 &amp; 20 and they still lost. Would he have scored 100 with a good back? They won the 1 game he missed and sat him another game thinking they didn’t need him. It’s not my fault they got caught with their hand in the cookie jar.</p>

<p>And it was a 5 game series, a 60 win team bounced by the 8th seed. That’s embarrassing, I don’t care what context you try to provide, especially forced ones as if the Heat were 100% healthy too. Got beat by an 8th seed missing its 3rd best player and it’s 6th man</p>

Crazy shooting against an injured bucks team, then getting to play the Knicks (lol), then crazy shooting against Boston and Tatum getting injured in game 7.

With no Jimmy, Injured Mitchell out, No Jarrett Allen, Levert missing game only had to focus on Garland then. Then Haliburton out.

<p>The Bucks built around the homegrown Giannis and Middleton.  The Celtics built around the homegrown Tatum and Brown.  Both teams had many years to work out what needed to be done.  Giannis won a ring in his 8th season.  If the Celtics finish the job, Tatum will get it in his 7th season.</p>

<p>Jimmy Butler was brought in as a free agent at age 30.  The Heat never had the luxury of figuring out how to optimally build around Butler, they just immediately had to make do with what they have or could get on short notice.</p>

<p>The Heat also clearly realized last offseason that they weren&rsquo;t good enough to win it all.  They just made the mistake of betting all their chips on Lillard.  When Lillard fell through, they had no Plan B.</p>

      <label for="l8gnv2b" class="commentText"><p>Jimmy phoning it in during the regular season is what led them to having to play in the Play-ins which led to him getting hurt because for whatever reason he decided to pumpfake/foulbait instead of going up for a layup or dunk where he was literally wide open. It’s actually karma that him phoning it in during the regular season AND foulbaiting led to him getting injured.</p>

<p>For the record, his Round 1 series against the Bucks is the biggest fluke ever lmao. Outside of that series, this guy is the definition of inconsistent and is insanely overrated</p>

Maybe they could&rsquo;ve got one. They&rsquo;ve always had good depth when they made the finals they basically lost to Jokic and Bron which are generational talents. Jimmy just isn&rsquo;t quite on their level.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lakers without Bam and Dragic.</p></li>

<li><p>Nuggets with the corpse of Jimmy and no Herro.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Heat rely on a gamestyle that forces them to push way too hard all year round. It’s not a coincidence that Miami crumbles towards the postseason or just can’t play all the way through. If they had a little bit more talent, and less D league « diamond in the roughs » who get overvalued in the offseason.</p>

All the credit in the world for what they were able to accomplish last year, but you aren&rsquo;t putting yourself in the best position to succeed if you are playing from the 8 spot every year. Plus, the Celtics were a 64-win team and were healthy entering the playoffs - it just wasn&rsquo;t happening this time around</p>

      <label for="l8gd145" class="commentText"><p>Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo duo are 2-1 vs the Bucks and 2-1 vs the Celtics (tho Heat would have lost this year with or without Jimmy). They fumbled Dame and then their two biggest rival teams both got better.</p>

<p>And both the Bucks and Celtics (presumably) will get rings before them.</p>

<p>I love it.</p>

<p>Embiid still hasn&rsquo;t gotten out of the 2nd round.</p>

<p>I hope the Celtics and Bucks face off the ECF next year. We&rsquo;ve never faced Giannis in the Conference Finals. Fully healthy, this matchup is gonna be fire. Though a healthy Knicks and Pacers are gonna be very good too.</p>
