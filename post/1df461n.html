</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>The Bucks and Celtics made moves to improve their roster after both lost to the Heat in the playoffs, the Bucks won the title the very next year, and the Celtics are 1 game away from winning the title this year. Meanwhile the Heat ran it back after deep runs in 2020, 2022 and 2023. The result is now the Heat going ringless in the Butler/Bam era and now they might trade Butler. Just shows the difference in between being non-complacent like the Bucks and Celtics which results in a title and being complacent like the Heat which results in going ringless with your 2 stars.</p>

<p>I hated it, but you guys won, and therefore deserved it. It was a Cinderella story for sure and you were punching up It was likely to end sooner than it did, but you guys got there by fighting hard and above your weight class. Talent wise I would say the heat shouldn&rsquo;t have been there, but the Heat certainly deserved to be there with how they fought.</p>

<p>That said, fuck pat Riley, and I too hope the heat are not relevant for the next 15 years, and that Tyler Herros wardrobe evolves to full on clown suits.</p>

<p>Now Jimmy is gonna be a year older. He already doesn&rsquo;t give a fuck about the regular season, putting them in contention for the play in every year. And he already seemed to fall off a little bit.</p>

<p>While Donovan Mitchell looks like he&rsquo;s gonna re-sign in Cleveland. As of now they have no options to get them over the hump.</p>

The 2022 team ended up getting the 1 seed and if Jimmy hits that 3 vs Boston, I think they matched up well against GS and who knows what would have happened, but that&rsquo;s not how things played out so it&rsquo;s seen as a failure.</p>

2023 finals herro injured, oladipo injured and jimmy playing on a fucked up ankle since the first game in the second round… we weren‘t very good in the regular season because jimmy likes to coast and miss games and we were also the team whose starters missed the most time during the season</p>

<p>Injuries are a part of the game but if the lakers and nuggets had those injuries and the heat were fully healthy there is a really good chance those finals have a different outcome</p>

<p>It’s not a dig to the teams who won because they don’t get to choose who they play. The Celtics beat the Heat without their star just the Heat beat the Bucks without their star.</p>

<p>You don’t see anyone bragging about how this years victory over the Heat proves anything, just like the comment I responded to is dumb for saying the Heat embarrassed the bucks as proof the Heat were better like there wasnt a giant injury that changed the series.</p>

<p>I’m not trying to take away from the Heat’s win, just the defense that the Heat “embarrassed the bucks” like there wasn’t an another obvious subplot.</p>

      <label for="l8gii2m" class="commentText"><p>Obviously still hurt, if Celtics fans can hold a 28pt game form Jimmy to say his ankle wasn’t fucked, then I think Giannis back was fine considering he dropped 40 &amp; 20 and they still lost. Would he have scored 100 with a good back? They won the 1 game he missed and sat him another game thinking they didn’t need him. It’s not my fault they got caught with their hand in the cookie jar.</p>

<p>And it was a 5 game series, a 60 win team bounced by the 8th seed. That’s embarrassing, I don’t care what context you try to provide, especially forced ones as if the Heat were 100% healthy too. Got beat by an 8th seed missing its 3rd best player and it’s 6th man</p>

      <label for="l8gq7il" class="commentText"><p>Caring about context is only important if you want your comments to be relevant to the discussion. the literal post I was responding was “Can you really say they got lucky..?” Yes, it not that hard to say the Heat got at least a little lucky when the Bucks #1 player gets hurts game in game #1.</p>

<p>No one is even saying the Heat wouldn’t have still won the series if Giannis was healthy or that the Heat didn’t have injuries themselves but to say the Heat didn’t get even a little lucky by Giannis getting hurt is ridiculous.</p>

<p>You have no frame of reference Donnie. You’re like a child who wandered into a movie</p>

Lebron won a title with the Cavs and Lakers, 2 horribly run organizations.  So, it’s not a sign of great organization that you can win with Lebron.  Pat Riley has been getting high off Heat Culture fumes for years.  The Warriors have a stronger argument for Warriors culture (maybe not so much post Darymond punch) but they never put Dubs Culture on the uniforms.  The Heat view themselves as one of the blue bloods of the NBA, but they still need to wins title with Jimmy for that to be true</p>

<p>The Bucks built around the homegrown Giannis and Middleton.  The Celtics built around the homegrown Tatum and Brown.  Both teams had many years to work out what needed to be done.  Giannis won a ring in his 8th season.  If the Celtics finish the job, Tatum will get it in his 7th season.</p>

<p>Jimmy Butler was brought in as a free agent at age 30.  The Heat never had the luxury of figuring out how to optimally build around Butler, they just immediately had to make do with what they have or could get on short notice.</p>

<p>The Heat also clearly realized last offseason that they weren&rsquo;t good enough to win it all.  They just made the mistake of betting all their chips on Lillard.  When Lillard fell through, they had no Plan B.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s something to be said for stability and there&rsquo;s also such thing as too much change (see Philly).</p>

<p>Adapting is good but the moves need to be carefully planned</p>

      <label for="l8gtkuy" class="commentText"><p>I think multiple things can be true. I think the heat, when fully healthy, are one of the most well coached teams in the league and can play with anyone. But I also think 2023 was a lucky run especially in the ECF- mainly because of the Ime Udoka situation. People forget, Joe mazzula was thrusted into the head coaching job with no real assistants 2 weeks before the season started. Predictably Spo coached circles around Mazz the first 3 games of that series. </p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no guarantee that making a move would&rsquo;ve been the thing that pushed the Heat over the edge.</p>

<p>They were extremely successful for half a decade and just didn&rsquo;t get the trophy.</p>

      <label for="l8gd145" class="commentText"><p>Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo duo are 2-1 vs the Bucks and 2-1 vs the Celtics (tho Heat would have lost this year with or without Jimmy). They fumbled Dame and then their two biggest rival teams both got better.</p>

<p>And both the Bucks and Celtics (presumably) will get rings before them.</p>

<p>I love it.</p>

<p>Embiid still hasn&rsquo;t gotten out of the 2nd round.</p>

<p>I hope the Celtics and Bucks face off the ECF next year. We&rsquo;ve never faced Giannis in the Conference Finals. Fully healthy, this matchup is gonna be fire. Though a healthy Knicks and Pacers are gonna be very good too.</p>
