      <label for="lb07lbv" class="commentText"><p>To be fair it’s only because the super teams got injured. Do the Warriors lose in 2019 if they’re healthy? Do the Nets lose in 2021 if they’re healthy?</p>

<p>This CBA was agreed upon last year, we were only 2 years removed from the Nets having KD, Kyrie and Harden, and the only thing that would stop another team like that forming again was if they changed the rules.</p>

<p>There was really nothing stopping the Knicks from doing the trade they did, keeping McBride instead of worrying about an apron, re-signing Hartenstein, and still having the partial MLE available for whatever free agent wanted to come to big market NY for a chance at a ring. They’re not a super team but suddenly they have way more assets to flip in a trade for a disgruntled star and form one.</p>

<p>The CBA is proactive and doesn’t like the scenarios of teams getting 2 really good players and then getting a 3rd because players had so much control over trades and free agency. Now that there’s more restrictions, players kind of have to be content with the situation they’re in, which feels unfair to them and too much for owners, but it evens the field for small market teams because what was in place to stop someone like Zion from holding out and playing up an injury (like we’ve seen so many stars do, LaVine basically did this last year, AD forced his way to LA, Dame forced a trade, KD forced a trade) and force his way to NY in a Randle + role players trade? If the owner does him dirty and deals him to another team, it makes less players trust New Orleans front office having their best interest and nobody signs there and it’s impossible to build a competitive team trying to draft for years in a small market with no star free agents and hoping you land a generational player.</p>

<p>These rules are much better if you’re invested in a small market team and don’t want to worry about your franchise player being a flight risk. It’s building around them and loading up on other talent that is the tricky part, but if every team has this problem, that’s a way to create parity.</p>

<p>Having the cap floor and encouraging teams to be below the 2nd apron also makes every team spend close to the same amount and prevents tanking of any kind since this makes it really hard to open up 2 max slots like the Nets did a few years ago for KD and Kyrie. It’s just less player movement so we’re less used to it.</p>

<p>No.  Ring culture being a problem is only at the discussion of a player&rsquo;s career.  Winning the championship should be and is the goal of every team.</p>

<p>To be fair, that&rsquo;s true.</p>

<p>Zweite Bundesliga, the second german league, recorded a record of 29000+ average attendance. They have been the 4th most attended league in the world, in front of La Liga (2nd biggest league in the world by coefficient) and Ligue 1 (5th biggest).</p>

<p>This is due to the fact that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Soccer culture in Germany is huge af.</li>
<li>A lot of historical teams of the past (or sometimes present) got relegated and thus the league is full with famous teams, with a fuck ton of loyal fans.</li>
</ol>

<p>They are not even in relegation zone, they are relegated and still holds some of the most faithful and loud fanbases in the world.</p>

<p>The top 6 for attendance was: Bundesliga, Premier league, Serie A, 2.Bundesliga, La Liga and Ligue 1.</p>

      <label for="lb03uy8" class="commentText"><p>It could be. Largely my ussumption is that teams will be stingier with handing maxes out, but the increase in the mid level salaries and players who make between mid and max will both increase and go up. It&rsquo;s great for the players across the board.</p>

<p>You can also still spend as much as you want, you just have finite penalties beyond owners paying extra in tax now. Which I think is more fair to have basketball related punishments to extending over the 2nd apron. Teams will adjust and get creative and I&rsquo;m interested in seeing that change.</p>

      <label for="lb09xpk" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think the hard cap is intended to help with parity as its primary consequence. I think it&rsquo;s one of the other consequences but it&rsquo;s very arguable. I feel this new cap guts a lot of player power and moves it back to the team. If parity is what the actual intention is, then we should look at the existing cases where a team is completely off balanced and analyze and root cause those issues appropriately. For example, the KD GSW: that is more a consequence of cap smoothing than an actual hard cap problem. It was an avoidable situation too.</p>

<p>The fact is this: the majority of NBA teams are owned by losers who don&rsquo;t know how to manage their team. So, giving every team a financial budget doesn&rsquo;t really fix their loser attitude; just like giving hand outs to people wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily solve their issues (and again it requires deep analysis to understand the underlying problems).</p>

<p>There isn&rsquo;t really evidence that the NFL middle class was killed.  It&rsquo;s more that some money shifted to the top players at key positions (QB, OL, DL).</p>

<p>Case in point, the top QB in 2011 was 14.95%, it&rsquo;s now 24.47%.  However there are offsets, like less money going to RBs.  Plenty of players are still making those mid-range contracts.</p>

      <label for="layxt01" class="commentText"><p>I stand corrected. There can be a hard-cap.</p>

<p>If a team is in the luxury tax and decides to use an exception or any of the triggering actions, a team becomes hard-capped at the next apron level.</p>

<p>The restrictions of a hard-cap is that it&rsquo;s literally a hard-cap and not the soft-cap that places a team into the luxury tax.</p>

<p>Meaning a team cannot re-sign their own players or sign draft picks if it would mean it places the team over the limit.</p>

<p>So essentially, a team can spend as much as they like as long as it&rsquo;s on their own players. But the moment they use exceptions or sign and trades or any other triggering action, they&rsquo;re capped.</p>

<p>Furthermore, teams that are in the luxury tax for repeated seasons can face some harsh repeater penalties such as having a worse position in the NBA Draft.</p>

<p>So, this essentially puts a free-agency choke on playoff contenders, or any horribly ran front-office. But even then, the cost of having a contender for repeated seasons is also steep.</p>

The restrictions are for the entire season and the reason for the hard capping rules is to avoid circumvention by teams who organize the transactions in a way to make use of all benefits and then still end up over the aprons.</p>

<p>So you can&rsquo;t use these exceptions if you are over the apron, and you can&rsquo;t use the exceptions first and then go over the apron using other deals.</p>

<p>Meaning the moment a team uses an exception, they capped themselves. Meaning the order of operations does matter if the concern is having enough room to pay everyone while adding talent.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s what the graphic is missing. If a team is hard-capped, they can&rsquo;t do anything if it means adding salary that puts them over.</p>

      <label for="lazcihz" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, but the hard cap only exists to avoid circumvention.</p>

<p>Say you weren&rsquo;t hard-capped to the Apron by using the MLE. Then teams would simply use the MLE first, and then re-sign all their players to Bird Rights extensions and exceed the Apron. So they would have used the MLE and exceeded the Apron in the same season. You can use the MLE and are free to go way over the Apron next season. So the cap has to be triggered and is only temporary, which IMO doesn&rsquo;t make it a true hard cap.</p>

<p>A team would need to do the reverse. Meaning, they re-sign all of their players then use the MLE. But the moment they use an exception, they&rsquo;re hard-capped regardless.</p>

<p>But yes, it&rsquo;s only for the season and not a permanent hard-cap. But that&rsquo;s where the repeater offenses begin to creep in.</p>

<p>A team in the luxury tax is free to re-sign their own players and then use an exception. But after that exception is used, they trigger the hard-cap.</p>

<p>The opposite process could be possible as long as the team stays under the hard cap they&rsquo;ve imposed on themselves by using the MLE before attempting to re-sign their own players.</p>

<p>If you resign players first and go from a non-apron team to a first apron team, you are allowed to use the taxpayer MLE, but not the NTMLE portion.</p>

<p>In short, a luxury tax team is heavily penalized by prioritizing external free-agents before their own free-agents. But not the other way around. Bird rights first, exceptions and complex transactions second.</p>

<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t even be able to sign their draft picks if a team elected to hard-cap themselves and not have space before having the opportunity to sign them. Which would be a monumental noob move.</p>

<p>But I think the only ways to trigger a hard-cap before free-agency would be virtually impossible to pull off. But It&rsquo;s possible a team doesn&rsquo;t immediately sign their rookies and hard-capped themselves before trying to do so. Again, that would be a noob move worthy of a firing.</p>

<p>The rule is sign your own players first, then go after free agents or swing a complex trade second (if the team is already in the luxury tax).</p>

<p>Minimum salary players and rookie scale contracts are always subject to exceptions to the cap (otherwise you&rsquo;d risk teams playing with less than a full roster). It&rsquo;s true that second round draft picks don&rsquo;t get a rookie exception to avoid the cap, but they DO qualify as a minimum salary player (and of course all second round picks inevitably sign for the minimum anyway).</p>

<p>But find a luxury tax team who willingly signs free agents before attempting to sign their own draft pick. It&rsquo;s a theoretical situation that would very rarely come up, if ever. There&rsquo;s no tangible benefit for a team to do that.</p>

<p>But a team can always, always, always sign its own draft picks because rookie scale contracts are an exception for over the cap teams. It may be that signing your own draft picks can create problems for a team, so that it&rsquo;s <em>disadvantageous</em> to do so (eg. triggering the luxury tax or the first or second apron restrictions), but that&rsquo;s different than being <em>unable</em> to. And at risk of repeating myself, as soon as a player is drafted in the first round, they are assigned a cap hold.</p>

<p>That was true before this CBA as well though. That ended the day that they invented the Supermax. The only difference now is that teams aren’t also gonna hang on the players that aren’t clearly worth the Supermax.</p>

<p>Those days also only benefited 3-4 cities, like Miami, LA, NY, and San Francisco. It wasn’t good for 90% of the league.</p>

      <label for="lazj3ea" class="commentText"><p>I’m saying that the Supermax (last CBA) already killed the chance of someone like LeBron, Kawhi, or KD becoming available in free agency. That’s why the Nets had to trade a bunch of picks for Harden and the Suns had to trade a bunch of picks for KD. Neither guy was willing to give up the Supermax money in order to go to a better team.</p>

<p>The new CBA hasn’t completely reverted that (Guys who 100% deserve the Supermax still aren’t gonna just walk), but it’s at least made teams think before giving <em>everyone</em> a Supermax deal. Ingram is an example of a player who’s available in the curre CBA, that wouldn’t have been available under the old CBA.</p>

<p>The new CBA hasn’t stopped players from entering free agency. It’s just forced teams to think before they offer all their available picks and money for a player that’s not absolutely worth it.</p>

Now with this CBA, there might be 4-6 teams with a true chance. And this restricts the trade market so much. And trades are a huge part of this league. Dynasties are also a huge part of this league and usually when there’s a dynasty, is when they have the best playoff ratings. So fans talk about parity being good for the league, but the ratings don’t reflect that. And ratings bring in more tv money which in turn makes the cap jump.  </p>

The NBA should build on what Bird and Magic brought. NBA fans either love or hate a dynasty. Those bring ratings. Teams are inportant, but it’s been about the players. </p>

      <label for="lazffm1" class="commentText"><p>That’s how it’s been in the past, but it doesn’t really work as well for today’s league.</p>

<p>The NBA is just way too deep. Guys like MJ, Bird, and Magic were <em>so</em> much better than the average player that they could support those kind of dynasties. Today’s league has shown that a single superstar isn’t enough to win a title anymore. There are just too many good players.</p>

<p>Whether they want to embrace it or not, the NBA is moving away from a model where a single player is enough to win a title. The League either needs to embrace that change or fail.</p>

<p>Sunday Night Football is presented so well. It makes even a shitty matchup feel like the Super Bowl, and football fans of all stripes want to tune in.</p>

<p>The NBA currently has almost the opposite problem. Watching the NBA Finals felt like I was watching some random regular season game on ESPN in November - the same shitty halftime show, the same graphics package, etc</p>

      <label for="lb066ci" class="commentText"><p>I think the real instigator will be the demise of the previous generation of Stars. LeBron, Steph, KD, and Kawhi are all reaching the ends of their career, and none of them are currently good enough to will themselves to a Championship.</p>

<p>There is obviously a newer crop of Stars, in Jokic, Luka, Embiid, Giannis, Wemby, Ant, and the others, but those guys still aren’t quite at the level of fame as LeBron, Steph, and KD. They don’t have the same level of personalities, for the most part they aren’t American (which does kinda make a difference), and the league is just too deep for them to dominate single-handedly.</p>

<p>ESPN and Co have already shown that they struggle to market Giannis or Jokic to the same degree as the previous generation, and I think the current level of parity is just gonna continue that trend. The media and league will be forced to adapt or die.</p>

<p>This should actually make free agent movement more common in the future, cause it’ll cause Contenders to prove that they can keep re-tooling on the fly. Heck, we’re already seeing it with PG and Klay. Those guys never would have been testing free agency if this new CBA didn’t exist.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you use the Bi-Annual Exception then you get hard-capped.  But when hard-capped you can&rsquo;t use the Non-Taxpayer MLE.  You can&rsquo;t use both.  This would essentially kill the Bi-Annual.<br>
</li>
<li>What happens if you only use a portion of the NTMLE in one contract.  Say you sign a player for <span class="math inline">\(6M.  Does the the hard-cap only trigger if you use 100% of the NTMLE?  Can you still use the remaining \)</span>6.8?  Or does this essentially kill splitting that between multiple players?<br>
</li>
<li>You can&rsquo;t use a bi-annual exception and also receive a player from a sign&amp;trade.    This &ldquo;you can only do one of these things&rdquo; seems unnecessarily restrictive.  Especially when two of those moves could hard-cap a cap-space team at the second apron.  Then it isn&rsquo;t doing the job it&rsquo;s supposed to be.  It&rsquo;s also making life harder for those cap-compliant teams.<br>
</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense that it restricts the use of Traded-Player Exceptions created from the same exact trade that made the TPE.  Or that it makes it so you can essentially only use one.  When most NBA teams already have multiple TPEs they&rsquo;ll now never get to use.</li>

If you&rsquo;re over the salary cap but under the first apron, you have access to both the full non-taxpayer and the bi-annual exception. BUT if you use either the bi-annual or if your non-taxpayer exception exceeds the taxpayer exception (~5M), then you CANNOT go over the first apron i.e. hardcapped.</p>

      <label for="lazu244" class="commentText"><p>It sounds like you’re interpreting this as meaning that once you do one thing (like adding a player via the BAE), not only are you hard-capped but you also get all of those additional restrictions (like no NTMLE and no sign-and-trade) applied. But that’s not how it works. You’re free to do all of those things, as long as none of them take you over the apron.</p>

<p>In other words, being hard-capped at the first apron doesn’t make you a first-apron team. Infact it ensures that you won’t be (for the current year).</p>

<p>The way it&rsquo;s phrased sounds like one action hard-caps you and once you are hard-capped you can&rsquo;t do the other action.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just a guy on reddit, what do I know. I could be completely wrong. But that&rsquo;s just the way it reads to me.</p>

<p>All the hard-cap does is make sure that a team doesn&rsquo;t circumvent the apron by doing things in a certain order&hellip; for example doing apron-prohibited actions first, and then making moves that take the team over the apron.</p>

<p>Looks like you have to DRAFT those guys &ndash; unless you own a team in Miami.</p>

<p>Other than that, you can do sign and trades.  I think teams SHOULD have tried to pull off sign/trades during the second night of the draft.  Flyover Land teams should treat the second night of the draft (essentially) as their ENTIRE off-season/free agency.</p>

<p>I also think that teams will be more willing to package 3 or 4 first round picks either to move UP in the draft OR to go ALL IN on a Missing Piece&rdquo; such as the Knicks did with Mikal Bridges.  &hellip; maybe some team goes ALL in on a Draft/Lotto &ldquo;Fab Five&rdquo;.  So you get all your top guys (prospects) on the SAME TIME LINE.</p>

<p>P.S.  At some point, even the &ldquo;good&rdquo; teams will have to worry about any upcoming expansion draft &ndash; which 8 players should a contender protect?  Then maybe they trade their deep bench players for future second round picks/cash considerations.</p>

<p>P.P.S.  Teams on the clock at the top of the board in &lsquo;24 &ndash; man, they probably should have had their big board (and done their scouting/analytics) for the NEXT draft.  This could be the 24/7/365/DECADE/GENERATION Perpetual Fantasy Basketball Draft/Season/Dynasty League era.</p>
