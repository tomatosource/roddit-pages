      <label for="lhbd9x3" class="commentText"><p>I keep seeing people talking about how awesome the game was but I can’t agree with that unless I’m only taking into account the fourth quarter heroics which is what I’m assuming you are all talking about. USA played awful in the first half and made a bunch of stupid mistakes and seemed to lack effort or intensity.
I’m glad that we won that game but for the USA that wasn’t a great game. We were out coached for much of the game and needed guys to go nuclear just to have a chance to win. Some of the lineups in these Olympics have been questionable at best.
On the bright side we have had some players who have been rock solid throughout these games. Even though I’m not a fan of either one of these players Lebron and Embiid have been very good.</p>

      <label for="lhasedu" class="commentText"><p>I don’t see it mentioned, so I’ll say I think the actual most important reasons are the following: it’s FIBA basketball, which has different rules and most of the non-NBA players are FIBA players who are used to that game (FIBA is a lot more defense oriented). 2) A lot of the other national teams play together a lot and have a lot of chemistry and are still comprised of fairly elite players; the USA has a line up of the best players in the world by far, but is still kind of a patchwork of “star” players that gel together better some years than others</p>

      <label for="lhazyhr" class="commentText"><p>I meant like entire line-up wise - also maybe “by far” is a stretch if you consider how NBA heavy Canada was. But Serbia after Jokic and Bogdan wasn’t that loaded, same with France after a few big names. But their FIBA players are still really good and playing a game they know well.</p>

      <label for="lhbb4uw" class="commentText"><p>Well I see your point but two things. I meant that the non NBA players that are part of rosters are better than you’d think because they are familiar with the game, so having non-NBA players isn’t as big of a disadvantage. Another thing is that a lot of international NBA players grow up under FIBA and reunite with their national team to play under those rules more often, so they also are arguably more familiar with FIBA. This is partly why sometimes international NBA players are better on the world stage (that and more opportunity/expanded playing time of course). For a total superstar such as Jokic or Yanis the extra returns over how good they already are in the NBA are possibly fairly marginal tho ya..</p>

      <label for="lhbcdzo" class="commentText"><p>I agree with everything you&rsquo;re saying but I still don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as big as an advantage as you do. What I think is actually happening is that these other players from other countries are playing at 150% while our team is playing at 75% unless we have to. It&rsquo;s like when the Lakers play without LeBron and AD and still manage to beat the Celtics in the regular season.</p>

      <label for="lha84bh" class="commentText"><p>Team USA already blew them out twice. This was the third time they had played so Serbia was eventually going to adjust. The rest of the world is certainly catching up, but the challenge they are going to have is compiling the depth the US has. Jokic played 37 of the 40 minutes. I think the rest of the starters played similar minutes. I think that’s why you saw them fade in the 4th quarter. In terms of starting 5, with the chemistry that some teams have, you’ll see them make up for the lack of difference in talent.</p>

<p>Plus you gotta remember The world is better now, I think about a quarter of the NBA is foreign outside talent..So the USA isn’t playing the D leaguers  from 30 years ago&hellip;you’re not gonna have these blowouts in a lot of these games, still some, but not as many.</p>

But in basketball any team can get hot and beat another team so for just a one and done tourney, no you really shouldn&rsquo;t expect them to run away with every game these days.</p>

<p>Serbia in particular has Jokic who is probably the best player in the world and they had 3 other guys go crazy from the 3 point line for the first 3 quarters. Put all that together and the US understandably had to dig deep to get out of this one.</p>

<p>Redditors should have some more respect to the game and the players around the world. jokic and bogdan  really pulled their team into a huge lead and kept it in. Jokic was very lebron like during those warriors/cavs run. Siberia played their heart out</p>

Imagine just team I mentioned above. Current USA team would need to piss blood to win over this team.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, USA is great, but blowout is possible because other countries have one-two stars versus USA and their 12 man team with superstars.</p>

      <label for="lhb1sx6" class="commentText"><p>Yes I was talking about Jokic. The last two number 1 overall picks were international players. In 92 there was some great international talent but nothing like today.  The world is better at basketball. Making it hard to compare the two squads.</p>

<p>I probably would say the Dream Team is better overall. But look at that last group the US had on the court. Arguably 3 of the top ten players of all time (maybe a little past their prime but still pretty dang good).</p>

      <label for="lh9j9ts" class="commentText"><p>It’s more than just Jokic. The entire world is just better at basketball than it was in ‘92. Of course the dream team was better; a much higher % of NBA stars were American.</p>

<p>Think of how many overseas players dominate now. You also have Shai, Giannis, Doncic, etc.—not to mention the countless other guys who maybe aren’t stars, but they’re still solid starters</p>

So you say you are talking about not playing Booker in the &ldquo;Serbia game&rdquo;. Booker had the 2nd best  +/- out of all our players that game and up until that game he still had one of the best +/-. He shot 50% from the 3 point and FG yesterday. WTF are you on about? If anything, your boy White should of sat next to your prima donna over-paid boyfriend on the bench. He had a -16 +/- and shot 0%. Please tell me why Booker should not of played again ? and please actually have an argument and not some 6th grade response</p>

      <label for="lh93ori" class="commentText"><p>This was a lucky win for the USA. All of the momentum came from that weird 6pt series otherwise they were dead in the water. They had started going hero-ball. They got outworked on the boards by a bunch non-nba players towards the end of the game. Pitiful showing for them with 4 MVPs on the floor, other than Steph. Can&rsquo;t wait to see embiid choke like usual get outplayed by Gobert and Wemby.</p>

<p>Did you also see the 70 second span in the 4th where he scored 7 straight points (and had a block) which tied the game?</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t say Embiid was perfect, I&rsquo;m disagreeing with someone who said he was pathetic.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not denying he had bad stretches/plays, I&rsquo;m saying overall he had a good game.</p>

<p>You have to be an Embiid hater to deny that</p>

<p>Also idk if you understand defensive schemes but Jokic initiates offense near the top of the key</p>

<p>They put Lebron on Jokic so Embiid could stay in the paint where he was a complete vortex altering countless shots in the 4th.</p>

<p>There are legit things to criticize about Embiid&rsquo;s game but his defense? Lmao bro you are clearly a hater</p>

<p>USA still wins. Possibly in dominant fashion given the euro national teams they face now have trained together forever (aside from the NBA players on those teams) whereas team USA is a mish mash of the best just thrown together. The Euro team would have to deal with the same cohesiveness issues that the USA does plus they would have no history whereas team USA began building a solid program from at least 2008 and on.</p>

<p>If this was a 7 game series I&rsquo;m betting the house on the USA. One game? The USA still wins but obviously randomness can impact that.</p>

      <label for="lh91txg" class="commentText"><p>Doncic - Bogdanovic - Lauri - Giannis - Jokic, that&rsquo;s not a team that you blow out. You are talking about cohesiveness issues but i think European players have more experience with team oriented offense/defence where usa players excel in iso play. It will therefore be easier for European players to reach cohesiveness. I really think it&rsquo;s much closer than you think.</p>
