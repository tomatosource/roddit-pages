      <p>(English isn’t my first language so I apologize if I end up making mistakes)</p>

<p>Of all the traditional Box Score stats (PTS, REB, AST, BLK, STL and FG%), which one would you say is the most important in terms of winning or team impact?</p>

<p>Of course, every aspect of a basketball player is equally important at the end of the day, but still, me personally if I have to choose, I’m going for assists. Simply because I believe playmaking/passing to be the most fundamental aspect in team basketball. At the end of the day, EVERY team needs to have good ball movement in order to win and a player’s individual playmaking ability adds a lot to that. There’s a reason for why every player’s favourite teammate is usually a “pass first” kind of player.</p>

That’s why Stockton type players are so valuable, it’s not just a situation of “give me the ball, I’m gonna 1v1 and your pass will be meaningless”, he was a guy that made thing easier for guys to score. It’s like when shaq said that penny was one of his favourite teammates because of how many easy points he created for shaq.</p>

      <label for="ljis7hv" class="commentText"><p>Would you say Malone would not score without Stockon? Or is it that he just made it easier for him to score.</p>

<p>Good passing increases your chances of making a basket.</p>

<p>It still requires the player to make th basket. Not all the passes Stockton made were for wide open lay ups. They just made it easier for Malone to score.</p>

<p>Also, being able to score makes it easier to make this passes.</p>

<p>Players like Ben Simmons and Kyle Anderson are great passers but don&rsquo;t rack up assists because defenses don&rsquo;t respect their scoring ability. So they cannot get their teammates open shots because they themselves are not a scoring threat.</p>

<p>The reason I said the last comment was different, is that setting different stats to 0 changes a lot compared to normal NBA basketball.</p>

<p>A 0 assist requirement means that if you steal it, and see your teammate wide open for a layup, you’re not allowed to pass it to him. Lol. Not to mention the other 80 or so possessions of regular offense, where you didn’t get the 20 steals. But you still can’t assist anybody.</p>

<p>Assists mean your team scored.  That&rsquo;s a positive point differential.  Steals ONLY mean the opponent doesn&rsquo;t score, not that your team does.  It&rsquo;s at either a positive point differential or neutral point differential.  That&rsquo;s worse than a guaranteed positive one.</p>

      <label for="ljit3zd" class="commentText"><p>What the stats do:</p>

<p>Points- ends a possession in a positive way. +2-3 points</p>

<p>Rebounds - defensive rebounds end an opponent possession. Offensive rebounds grants another possession.</p>

<p>Steals - ends an opponent possession. The opponent doesnt score.</p>

<p>Blocks - stops a scoring attempt. Can result in a change of possession.</p>

<p>Assists - doesnt end an possession. Doesnt lead to a change in possession. Its an in between stat. An assist is not necessarily needed for a score. Its beneficial, but not consequential.</p>

<p>Turnover - ends your possession and leads to a change in possession.</p>

<p>Assists are the least valuable stat. They are beneficial, but not consequential!
Overvalued stat</p>

      <label for="ljii9a0" class="commentText"><p>If we just go by league average team stats and order the basic box score stats from fewest per game to most per game, the order would be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Blocks - 5.1 per team per game</li>
<li>Steals - 7.5 per team per game</li>
<li>ORB - 10.6 per team per game</li>
<li>3PM - 12.8 per team per game</li>
<li>TOV - 13.6 per team per game</li>
<li>FTM - 17.0 per team per game</li>
<li>PF - 18.7 per team per game</li>
<li>FTA - 21.7 per team per game</li>
<li>AST - 26.7 per team per game</li>
<li>DRB - 33.0 per team per game</li>
<li>3PA - 35.1 per team per game</li>
<li>REB - 43.5 per team per game</li>
<li>FGA - 88.9 per team per game</li>
<li>PTS - 114.2 per team per game</li>
</ol>

<p>Definitely not a perfect way to determine the &ldquo;value&rdquo; of one unit of any of these stats but it does show how rarely or commonly these things are happening in a game which gives us an indication of their value. Since ORBs are the rarest offensive box score stat and the 3rd rarest overall you can probably say that one ORB is pretty valuable compared to one of everything else</p>

      <label for="ljidsfl" class="commentText"><p>I disagree but I still see your point. There has been games that were won literally because of steals, and it’s true that 1 steal = 1 extra possession. But I still wouldn’t call it the most important in a constant 48 minute game for a lot of reasons but mainly because of inconsistency. You can’t just be stealing every possession constantly.</p>

Mainly due to the fact that the scorers will be fighting for every single possession and if they’re unlucky and one guy decides that he’s gonna shoot at every minimal opportunity they will have a team FG% of 20%. Assists/Good passing have a proven correlation with high FG% which means more wins, even if “they aren’t trained to score”, just because they will be creating open plays and easy open layups whereas the other guys will be playing 1v1 ISO every time.</p>

<p>Points is the only stat that decides the winner. You can get your scoring oportunities by being better at steals, assists, rebounds, but in the end it&rsquo;s the team with most poinst that wins.</p>

<p>There is no assist if the player you passed to didn&rsquo;t score. Rebounds and steals don&rsquo;t mean much if you don&rsquo;t turno those extra possesions into points. FG% is just a stat that shows how effective you are at scoring points.</p>

<p>You can only make an argument that 1 steal or rebound is more important than 1 point. That&rsquo;s correct, but in the end those things are important because they lead to your team scoring more points or the opposing team scoring less points.</p>

      <label for="ljih3z7" class="commentText"><p>I agree that the goal of the GAME is to score more than the opponent, that is true. But that’s not the only goal of the team or the player itself. And I think it’s very simplistic to view in that way of “more points, more wins, the end.” Everything has a context and an explanation behind it. So while I do think what you’re saying is partially true I don’t think the team’s goal is just “put the ball on the hoop”, there’s more to it than that. And like I said, Even if we view it like that, in order to score points you have to move the ball through the team, you have to make tactical plays etc etc, which of all them also include ball movement.</p>

<p>Your main argument is that ball passing leads to critical spots and time that open up shots or layups, and there is no stat for ball movement unfortunately and assists also only tells you of the good/bad passes that lead to completion</p>

      <label for="ljiittp" class="commentText"><p>Points, steals, Blocks. Those stats are more based on individual skill than assists and rebounds. </p>

<p>Assists always also rely heavily on the receivers ability to actually score. If the receiver cant hit anything, the best passes are useless.  </p>

<p> Same for rebounds. Teammates often need to help with boxing out for someone to secure a rebound.  </p>

<p> Offensive rebounds are more valuable than defense rebounds and more based on individual skill than defensive rebounds. </p>

<p>Offensive rebounds keep possessions alive and often offer direct scoring opportunities. </p>

      <label for="ljin8j5" class="commentText"><p>I don’t agree at all. You have to be HIGHLY skilled to have 10+ assists or 13+ rebounds. Ofc you Can get 1 lucky assist thanks to a 3 pointer made by your best shooter but that isn’t the realistic case I’m talking about. To have a huge amount of assists you have to Have a high BBIQ, and great sense of positioning, timing etc, it’s not just “my teammate has to score my easy pass”. Because in that case, everyone would have 10+ assists on average and the reality is that that’s only reserved for the best playmakers of all time, some of the most intelligent basketball players we’ve ever seen. It takes different kinds of skills to be good at different aspects of the game but there’s no aspect that takes “more skill” than the other. Are you truly saying that Carmelo Anthony has more skill than say, Steve Nash?</p>

      <label for="ljiqkkw" class="commentText"><p>What I am saying is that assists rely on two guys having skill. The passer and the receiver. </p>

<p>Passing is a valuable skill. Skilled passers are highly skilled. But that was not the question. If Nash played with 4 unskilled guys who cant shoot or make a layup off his great passes, how many Assists would he have? That takes nothing away from his skill as a passer. But even the best passer depends on the skill of his receiver to convert his passes. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why Assists as a stat are overvalued. </p>

<p>On top - often times the ball movement before the Initial assist pass are as crucial or even more crucial. Only the last in line gets credited an assist. We dont track Hockey assists. </p>

<p>Assists as a stat just tells you who made the last pass that lead to a score.
It doesnt tell you anything about the quality of the pass or the passes and their quality that happened before the last pass. </p>

<p>A guy that averages 10 assist has not the same value as a guy who averages 30 points. The game is decided by who scores the most points not who had the most Assists. The great scorers can score without the need to Set them up. That&rsquo;s more valuable. </p>

<p>Points/g is more valuable than assists/g.</p>

<p>Another Problem with Assists the way the rule is applied. The Rule is not very precisely worded. They suspicable to bias and are granted more generous now than in previous eras. </p>

<p>This is not meant as a discredit to Lebron but this vid shows how bogus and misleading Assists as a stat can be. This is true for everyone though, not just Lebron.</p>

      <label for="ljik6lv" class="commentText"><p>Scoring is the best skill so points on good efficiency,</p>

<p>For example kwahi Lennard isn&rsquo;t that great of a passer average like around 3.5 a game and he is like slightly below average at rebounding at 6 for his position, but he knows how to score in so many different ways that he elveats and carries his team to the point that if healthy you can bet they can beat anyone. Luka is very similar to this, and Kobe was like this ( his efficiency compared to the volume he was shooting  was very good in his era)</p>

<p>Contrast this to players like Russel Westbrook, an unbelievable player who averaged extremely high assists and rebounds and averaged like 30 a game ( but his efficiency and the way he scored were not effective and pretty one dimensional which allowed teams to shut his scoring down when it mattered )</p>

<p>Points and how you score those points in my opinion are the most important stat and skill.</p>

<p>2 points ain&rsquo;t just 2 points. It will also</p>

      <label for="ljiolpm" class="commentText"><p>I agree on your Leonard point in the sense that it’s true that he can be a great resource whenever he’s in a good team because of his versatility, even though I would say there has been a million players more versatile than him that lost because of their bad teams and not because they aren’t as efficient as him. Also, Luka is not a good example cause he’s a playmaker as well. For example Kobe lost a bunch of years in which he was Exactly like Westbrook. The only reason Kobe has 5 and Westbrook 0 is because of their teams. Players don’t win championships, teams do. That’s beyond our own subjective opinion of Who was better between Kobe or Russ. So putting OKC defeats on Russ’s playstyle is incorrect. Russ was inefficient, yeah, true but he added so much more to the table than just scoring that it outweighed the inefficiency.</p>

      <label for="ljim22o" class="commentText"><p>Based on the comments you are talking about individual box score stats. Its pretty hard to say since you can be impactful in many different archetypes e.g curry (PTS + AST), shaq (PTS + REB + BLK), mutombo (BLK and REB) etc. there is the common denominator that high fg is a valuable stat, but it needs to come with volume. Overall, id say points ( especially looking historically with the best player on the championship team ), but this question is basically asking “what is the most important feature of a car” - where you kinda need most of a cars composition (driving wheel, wheel, body etc)</p>
