    </h2>

      <p>(English isn’t my first language so I apologize if I end up making mistakes)</p>

<p>Of all the traditional Box Score stats (PTS, REB, AST, BLK, STL and FG%), which one would you say is the most important in terms of winning or team impact?</p>

<p>Of course, every aspect of a basketball player is equally important at the end of the day, but still, me personally if I have to choose, I’m going for assists. Simply because I believe playmaking/passing to be the most fundamental aspect in team basketball. At the end of the day, EVERY team needs to have good ball movement in order to win and a player’s individual playmaking ability adds a lot to that. There’s a reason for why every player’s favourite teammate is usually a “pass first” kind of player.</p>

<p>Assists mean your team scored.  That&rsquo;s a positive point differential.  Steals ONLY mean the opponent doesn&rsquo;t score, not that your team does.  It&rsquo;s at either a positive point differential or neutral point differential.  That&rsquo;s worse than a guaranteed positive one.</p>

      <label for="ljidsfl" class="commentText"><p>I disagree but I still see your point. There has been games that were won literally because of steals, and it’s true that 1 steal = 1 extra possession. But I still wouldn’t call it the most important in a constant 48 minute game for a lot of reasons but mainly because of inconsistency. You can’t just be stealing every possession constantly.</p>

      <label for="ljii9a0" class="commentText"><p>If we just go by league average team stats and order the basic box score stats from fewest per game to most per game, the order would be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Blocks - 5.1 per team per game</li>
<li>Steals - 7.5 per team per game</li>
<li>ORB - 10.6 per team per game</li>
<li>3PM - 12.8 per team per game</li>
<li>TOV - 13.6 per team per game</li>
<li>FTM - 17.0 per team per game</li>
<li>PF - 18.7 per team per game</li>
<li>FTA - 21.7 per team per game</li>
<li>AST - 26.7 per team per game</li>
<li>DRB - 33.0 per team per game</li>
<li>3PA - 35.1 per team per game</li>
<li>REB - 43.5 per team per game</li>
<li>FGA - 88.9 per team per game</li>
<li>PTS - 114.2 per team per game</li>
</ol>

<p>Definitely not a perfect way to determine the &ldquo;value&rdquo; of one unit of any of these stats but it does show how rarely or commonly these things are happening in a game which gives us an indication of their value. Since ORBs are the rarest offensive box score stat and the 3rd rarest overall you can probably say that one ORB is pretty valuable compared to one of everything else</p>

Doncic because of his ability to score</p>

      <label for="ljigf0h" class="commentText"><p>Well, on one hand I think that’s a good question and I do agree that Luka would win that game but I also think it’s a bit unfair since Luka is already a great playmaker as well. I think it would be more fair to ask something like 5 Kidds vs 5 Iversons or something like that.</p>

Put it like this train random 5 person that never play basketball in their life to pass the basketball and others 5 to shoot and make lays up.

      <label for="ljiitk0" class="commentText"><p>The guys that were trained to pass the ball and to create open shots. Mainly due to the fact that the scorers will be fighting for every single possession and if they’re unlucky and one guy decides that he’s gonna shoot at every minimal opportunity they will have a team FG% of 20%. Assists/Good passing have a proven correlation with high FG% which means more wins, even if “they aren’t trained to score”, just because they will be creating open plays and easy open layups whereas the other guys will be playing 1v1 ISO every time.</p>

You have to consider defensive assets also the ability to deny scoring throught invisible stats like contest shot, on ball defense etc&hellip;

<p>Assists always also rely heavily on the receivers ability to actually score. If the receiver cant hit anything, the best passes are useless.  </p>

<p> Same for rebounds. Teammates often need to help with boxing out for someone to secure a rebound.  </p>

      <label for="ljin8j5" class="commentText"><p>I don’t agree at all. You have to be HIGHLY skilled to have 10+ assists or 13+ rebounds. Ofc you Can get 1 lucky assist thanks to a 3 pointer made by your best shooter but that isn’t the realistic case I’m talking about. To have a huge amount of assists you have to Have a high BBIQ, and great sense of positioning, timing etc, it’s not just “my teammate has to score my easy pass”. Because in that case, everyone would have 10+ assists on average and the reality is that that’s only reserved for the best playmakers of all time, some of the most intelligent basketball players we’ve ever seen. It takes different kinds of skills to be good at different aspects of the game but there’s no aspect that takes “more skill” than the other. Are you truly saying that Carmelo Anthony has more skill than say, Steve Nash?</p>

      <label for="ljik6lv" class="commentText"><p>Scoring is the best skill so points on good efficiency,</p>

<p>For example kwahi Lennard isn&rsquo;t that great of a passer average like around 3.5 a game and he is like slightly below average at rebounding at 6 for his position, but he knows how to score in so many different ways that he elveats and carries his team to the point that if healthy you can bet they can beat anyone. Luka is very similar to this, and Kobe was like this ( his efficiency compared to the volume he was shooting  was very good in his era)</p>

<p>Contrast this to players like Russel Westbrook, an unbelievable player who averaged extremely high assists and rebounds and averaged like 30 a game ( but his efficiency and the way he scored were not effective and pretty one dimensional which allowed teams to shut his scoring down when it mattered )</p>

<p>Points and how you score those points in my opinion are the most important stat and skill.</p>

<p>2 points ain&rsquo;t just 2 points. It will also</p>

      <label for="ljiolpm" class="commentText"><p>I agree on your Leonard point in the sense that it’s true that he can be a great resource whenever he’s in a good team because of his versatility, even though I would say there has been a million players more versatile than him that lost because of their bad teams and not because they aren’t as efficient as him. Also, Luka is not a good example cause he’s a playmaker as well. For example Kobe lost a bunch of years in which he was Exactly like Westbrook. The only reason Kobe has 5 and Westbrook 0 is because of their teams. Players don’t win championships, teams do. That’s beyond our own subjective opinion of Who was better between Kobe or Russ. So putting OKC defeats on Russ’s playstyle is incorrect. Russ was inefficient, yeah, true but he added so much more to the table than just scoring that it outweighed the inefficiency.</p>

      <label for="ljim22o" class="commentText"><p>Based on the comments you are talking about individual box score stats. Its pretty hard to say since you can be impactful in many different archetypes e.g curry (PTS + AST), shaq (PTS + REB + BLK), mutombo (BLK and REB) etc. there is the common denominator that high fg is a valuable stat, but it needs to come with volume. Overall, id say points ( especially looking historically with the best player on the championship team ), but this question is basically asking “what is the most important feature of a car” - where you kinda need most of a cars composition (driving wheel, wheel, body etc)</p>

<p>Points is the only stat that decides the winner. You can get your scoring oportunities by being better at steals, assists, rebounds, but in the end it&rsquo;s the team with most poinst that wins.</p>

<p>There is no assist if the player you passed to didn&rsquo;t score. Rebounds and steals don&rsquo;t mean much if you don&rsquo;t turno those extra possesions into points. FG% is just a stat that shows how effective you are at scoring points.</p>

<p>You can only make an argument that 1 steal or rebound is more important than 1 point. That&rsquo;s correct, but in the end those things are important because they lead to your team scoring more points or the opposing team scoring less points.</p>

      <label for="ljih3z7" class="commentText"><p>I agree that the goal of the GAME is to score more than the opponent, that is true. But that’s not the only goal of the team or the player itself. And I think it’s very simplistic to view in that way of “more points, more wins, the end.” Everything has a context and an explanation behind it. So while I do think what you’re saying is partially true I don’t think the team’s goal is just “put the ball on the hoop”, there’s more to it than that. And like I said, Even if we view it like that, in order to score points you have to move the ball through the team, you have to make tactical plays etc etc, which of all them also include ball movement.</p>

<p>Your main argument is that ball passing leads to critical spots and time that open up shots or layups, and there is no stat for ball movement unfortunately and assists also only tells you of the good/bad passes that lead to completion</p>
