      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ffvdfa/most_speculative_rookie_max_extension_ever/"><p>most speculative rookie max extension ever?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I&rsquo;m curious about this. I don&rsquo;t mean, like, who was the WORST player to get a rookie max extension, this isn&rsquo;t intended to be a question that denigrates a player by saying he didn&rsquo;t deserve it or was a bad investment. I mean who is the player that <em>had shown the least at the time they were offered it?</em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s tough to find a list of offerees that goes back more than like 5 years.</p>

<p>Was it Jamal Murray in summer 2019? He had been starting, playing 30 min a night, and scoring 20 pts or so for a couple of seasons. Or, similarly, Franz Wagner this past summer?</p>

<p>Was it Andrew Wiggins in 2017, who had played like 9,000 minutes of bad basketball?</p>

<p>This is motivated by the Kuminga talk. If someone offered him the max, he would be the answer, right?</p>

<p>His numbers in that year were pretty phenomenal, though. I think any player that does that in his second year on the court definitely gets the max extension offer unless he is a huge health risk&hellip;</p>

<p>Was that his rookie extension? I don&rsquo;t really know what exactly &ldquo;rookie extension&rdquo; entails, he&rsquo;s going into his 9th season now and is under contract until 2029.</p>

<p>I remember it being talked about at the time but most people were of the opinion that Boston absolutely had to do it. The contract is looking good right now.</p>

      <label for="lmxr54i" class="commentText"><p>Yes, they are two different contracts. This is his third contract: <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>286</sub>, the Designated Veteran variety that allows him to take home more than 30% of the cap before accruing 10 years of service. Tatum also signed this earlier this summer and it kicks in 2025-26.</p>

<p>You will often hear contracts described in certain ways based on the player’s YoE when signing them.</p>

<p>Actually Embiid might be the answer. He played 31 games in 3 years prior to getting his max extension. Granted he was really really good in those 31 games, and it was clear he was going to be an all-star level player, but that&rsquo;s gotta be the least anyone&rsquo;s played to receive $30M/year.</p>

<p>Also he&rsquo;s a borderline terrible rebounder for a forward and his shot creation is not that great when you consider the amount he had the ball in his hands bc Orlando don&rsquo;t have better players on offense.</p>

<p>Was it Andrew Wiggins in 2017, who had played like 9,000 minutes of bad basketball?</p>

<p>Wiggins had not played bad basketball. He wasn&rsquo;t a star or anything, but he looked like a good player ready to make a leap.</p>

      <label for="lmxpb7j" class="commentText"><p>Maybe I&rsquo;m a hater, and I haven&rsquo;t watched basically any pistons games, but Cade Cunningham got a max rookie extension while being a profoundly inefficient scorer and passer. Not to say he&rsquo;s bad or anything, but getting a 9-figure contract when you score 20PPG on high usage at a 45% FG percentage (and a 2:1 AST:TO ratio as the primary ball handler for your team) is not exactly great.</p>
