      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ffvdfa/most_speculative_rookie_max_extension_ever/"><p>most speculative rookie max extension ever?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I&rsquo;m curious about this. I don&rsquo;t mean, like, who was the WORST player to get a rookie max extension, this isn&rsquo;t intended to be a question that denigrates a player by saying he didn&rsquo;t deserve it or was a bad investment. I mean who is the player that <em>had shown the least at the time they were offered it?</em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s tough to find a list of offerees that goes back more than like 5 years.</p>

<p>Was it Jamal Murray in summer 2019? He had been starting, playing 30 min a night, and scoring 20 pts or so for a couple of seasons. Or, similarly, Franz Wagner this past summer?</p>

<p>Was it Andrew Wiggins in 2017, who had played like 9,000 minutes of bad basketball?</p>

<p>This is motivated by the Kuminga talk. If someone offered him the max, he would be the answer, right?</p>

      <label for="lmxhtp6" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t remember if Jaylen Brown got the max, (i don&rsquo;t think it was), but he got paid a lot for someone who had very low stats. At the time, his contract was seen as a massive overpay and a clear bet on his potential vs. production.</p>

      <label for="lmxhdzb" class="commentText"><p>Probably MPJ?  His 3rd year was really good, but it&rsquo;s extremely debatable if it was max worthy (most people would probably say no imo), but I think it&rsquo;s proven he wasn&rsquo;t worth contract since then.</p>

      <label for="lmxjhde" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s a good candidate.</p>

<p>His numbers in that year were pretty phenomenal, though. I think any player that does that in his second year on the court definitely gets the max extension offer unless he is a huge health risk&hellip;</p>

      <label for="lmxi0k4" class="commentText"><p>Franz Wagner for sure. Capable starter, but the Magic have to be banking on some massive improvements to be handing him all that</p>

<p>Actually Embiid might be the answer. He played 31 games in 3 years prior to getting his max extension. Granted he was really really good in those 31 games, and it was clear he was going to be an all-star level player, but that&rsquo;s gotta be the least anyone&rsquo;s played to receive $30M/year.</p>

      <label for="lmxjt5u" class="commentText"><p>If his shot starts falling, Wagner is a fringe All-Star. He has very little weaknesses and if he wasn&rsquo;t given the max by the Magic, someone else would&rsquo;ve offered it.</p>
