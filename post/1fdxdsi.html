      <label for="lmj24u2" class="commentText"><p>They don’t really reward versatile defenders too much. </p>

<p>AD never won DPOY. </p>

<p>Scottie Pippen also never won DPOY.</p>

<p>Bobby Jones, probably the first versatile defender in NBA history who could guard 2-4 and some 1 and 5, is mostly forgotten today in all time discussion.</p>

<p>Marion never made a single All Defensive team (which is ridiculous). </p>

<p>Kirilenko was often undervalued as a defender when he played, although analytics has helped him out after the fact. </p>

<p>Now there’s Bam. </p>

<p>Occasionally, some versatile defenders like Pistons Dennis Rodman was recognized, but even for him, so you remember that version or the Bulls version? Because the Pistons version was a better player. </p>

      <label for="lmlqwz9" class="commentText"><p>Yeah but Duncan was still a top 5 defender long after Bowen retired and he still didn’t win one. Fucking Marc Gasol got DPOY over Duncan. It’s just bias against the Spurs. Many people still think Kawhi’s most dominant season was 2019 in Toronto. It wasn’t. His best season was his last one with the Spurs, but nobody watched him then. Spurs players are almost always slow to get the recognition they deserve, if they ever get it.</p>

As soon as that happened, the energy shifted and all the basketball bloggers and media analysts suddenly started heavily pushing for Smart as DPoTY, under the merit of “a guard hasn’t won the award in forever, wouldn’t that be neat.”</p>

<p>He had the narrative behind him, that’s all there is to it. And now that he’s no longer the “heart and soul of the Celtics” and Boston fans are now instead head over heels for Derrick White, nobody has a motive anymore to maintain Smart’s DPoTY was anything other than a complete farce.</p>

Then it became battle royals for a bunch of undeserving candidates. There was very little noise for timelord as well, it lasted about as long as Liz Truss, because him and Smart’s campaign only coincided with Celtics red hot form post all star break and he went down pretty early.

      <label for="lmlx9oy" class="commentText"><p>Yeah this is just Miami fans knowing as little about other teams as they know about their own.</p>

<p>Smart was the consensus pick for Celtics fans, media and players&hellip; well before Robert Williams got hurt. In Celtic polls he was winning pretty comfortably with 70-80% of the vote.</p>

<p>Smart was the foundation of that defence. When we used to talk about Ime using advanced switching schemes to hide Robert Williams on the weakside so he could ambush scorers, it was Smart who grounded and led those advanced switching schemes, same way he used to be the primary guy Brad Stevens would use to hide Isaiah, Kyrie and Kemba.</p>

<p>Rob was a fantastic defender for us but Smart was the structural core of how that defence functioned.</p>

<p>r/nba however loved Robert Williams because he had better highlights and they&rsquo;re not watching full games.</p>

<hr>

<p>Meanwhile Miami fans are upset because Bam didn&rsquo;t win that year&hellip; despite the fact Bam only played 56 games and Miami was only ranked 5th defensively.</p>

<p>9 of the past 10 DPOYs have been on teams that rank 1st or 2nd. The 10th DPOY led a team ranked 4th. It&rsquo;s also tough to win major awards when you&rsquo;re missing 30% of the season.</p>

<p>Bam is a DPOY calibre player, he just hasn&rsquo;t had a DPOY calibre season.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right that Bam <strong>should have</strong> won that 2022 DPOY, but he needed to actually turn up and win that award.</p>

<p>Instead of crying in the off season, Miami should try putting in the work in the regular season. This is a team that screws around for 82 games and then gets upset that they&rsquo;re not winning regular season awards or being given a good playoff seeding.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;hardest-working, best conditioned, most professional, unselfish, toughest, meanest, nastiest team in the NBA&rdquo; gets routinely outworked by the rest of the league.</p>

      <label for="lmkg32u" class="commentText"><p>The coaches that have selected him as an all star three times for starters. And his own yes. Spoelstra has also  gone out of his way to praise Rudy.</p>

<p>Did you watch either of Gobert’s series against the Mavs ? His series with Utah he was great for the most part. His defence single handedly won them one of those games. With the wolves he wasn’t ideal, but it’s Kyrie Irving and Luka Doncic targeting him… 90% of wings and guards are losing that battle, let alone bigs. And they were still significantly better in those minutes than the non Rudy minutes cause he held up much better than Naz or Kat did. And the clippers series was an obvious issue of overextending him. He was asked to defend a stretch 5 and play help D on every other possession because the Jazz perimeter d was abysmal. No big is succeeding in that position.</p>

<p>Also it just makes sense to pull an elite paint protector out onto the perimeter whenever possible… even if they hold up, removing them from the paint opens things up for the rest of the team. That’s a common sense strategy.</p>

<p>besides, he hasn&rsquo;t even been an All-Star the past 2 years despite yall saying he&rsquo;d explode without Mitchell holding him back in Utah anymore</p>

<p>uhh yes I did. I watched Jazz go small with Paschall at center and erase a 17-point deficit vs. Mavs in playoffs</p>

<p>teams would use that same strategy with Cody Zeller too. nobody is doing it cause they think Zeller is an elite rim protector. if your defense can be completely nullified with a simple high screen, you can&rsquo;t be the best defender</p>

      <label for="lmki0ms" class="commentText"><p>And he was selected for all star, by the coaches, because of that defence. Or do you think he was picked for what he brings offensively ?</p>

<p>Just gonna ignore the weird strawman w/ Mitchell.</p>

<p>Paschal played 24 minutes total in that series… what exactly is the relevant of one adjustment in one game ? Gobert was an overall net positive in that series and had a defensive masterclass in game 1 that lead to a win.</p>

<p>Teams use the same strategy with everybody, because it works. Again even if the rim protector holds up, removing them from the paint is hugely beneficial for everyone else. Broadly speaking Gobert just hasn’t had the defensive help to compensate. The way AD for example has with the lakers. Hes finally had some legit defensive help with the wolves and he’s held up for the most part. Only struggles were in the Mavs series, and again Naz and Kat were worse, and again it was Luka and Kyrie, two of the best iso guards in the league.</p>

<p>not a strawman at all. Gobert fans always blamed Mitchell</p>

<p>because it shows the importance of defensive versatility in playoffs. G1 is G1&hellip;series hasn&rsquo;t even started yet. deeper into the series, you need to to adjust and Gobert can&rsquo;t do that</p>

<p>when did AD on Lakers have as good defensive help as Gobert on Wolves? and you can&rsquo;t just brush off Luka/Kyrie when that&rsquo;s what happens in playoffs&hellip;you&rsquo;re gonna face elite wings eventually and you can;t hide Gobert from them</p>

<p>You really need to be 1st or 2nd defensively to be in the conversation. 9 of the past 10 DPOYs finished 1st or 2nd, the 10th finished 4th and that was because Rudy was freakish that year.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right Bam should have won it over Smart, but he didn&rsquo;t because Bam didn&rsquo;t turn up that season&hellip; Which is exactly u/Agnk1765342&rsquo;s point.</p>

<p>Smart won in a weak year and it was a weak year because guys like Bam disappointed.</p>

<p>Bam is undeniably one of the best defenders in the league but then you go year by year and he loses out legitimately every single time.</p>

      <label for="lmkeo14" class="commentText"><p>I feel like it’s hard to give him the nod regardless of the criteria for last year. Like if the argument is just awarding defensive success then Gobert was the anchor and captain of the best defence in the league by a comfortable margin. If the argument is about elevating bad defences to much better levels than they had any right being, wemby was essentially single handedly keeping the spurs afloat at that end. They finished #21 but were dead last without him and #14 with him, despite an abysmal defensive supporting cast.</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t understand why this year you can&rsquo;t make the case that he did not have the best case?</p>

<p>Wolves had the best defense in the league with Rudy on the floor</p>

<p>in 1400 mins, you know what their defense ranked without Rudy? best in the league still</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t really have a problem with Rudy winning it, even tho i thought eye test it was pretty clearly Wemby, but it is subjective, and you could make the best case for Wemby, Bam, Rudy</p>

<p>as great as AD is, and however unfortunate the 3point shooting luck was, 15th just is too much to overcome</p>

      <label for="lmjvei0" class="commentText"><p>And based off what I’ve read from people who watch the heat, Caleb was not very good on defense in his last year or so in Miami</p>

<p>Also Miami plays so small all the time, I think bam has a serious argument every year. His quote about why he should win it is true. The lineups Miami puts out there are kinda ridiculous with the height disadvantage</p>

<p>Bam is also undersized as a center which makes it even more surprising Miami maintains a good defense</p>

<p>And finally jimmy butler is aging and so you know his defense is gonna be the first thing to go. I just think what Miami asks of bam is kinda absurd. It’s a huge workload defensively. Anthony Davis is in a similar situation.</p>

<p>Paul George, Horford and Draymond rounded out the top 6, but none of them had very remarkable defensive years.</p>

<p>Gobert was a defensive beast that year. Utah had the 2nd best defense and by far the #1 defense with Gobert on the court. That plus not very strong cases from the other players let him win despite playing only 56 games.</p>

<p>Bam did not have as dominant a defensive season in his 56 games in 2022 and other players had better cases.</p>

      <label for="lmjmj01" class="commentText"><p>One thing I really hate about stuff like this is the “it’s a travesty he never even won once!” takes. There are a lot of DPOY (and every award) caliber players every year. The stars aren’t going to align perfectly for every one of those guys at least one time in their entire careers. Unless you want to start advocating for some crazy “you can only win each award once” nonsense, this stuff is always going to happen to <em>somebody.</em></p>

His year was actually 2021-22 in my opinion, but he got injured and didn&rsquo;t play enough games to win it.</p>

That’s shown by the metrics, and just using logic it’s clear why a player who defends a zone on the floor, rather than an individual player, and a zone where teams take and convert on the most shots at that, would be most impactful. Meanwhile for MVP, playmaking is often more impactful/important  than scoring, let alone getting defence</p>

      <label for="lmjsxwv" class="commentText"><p>I do think Bam&rsquo;s excellence on defense isn&rsquo;t really fully appreciated. He&rsquo;s as indispensable as the hub enabling one of the most ambitious and interesting defensive schemes in the NBA, one that regularly outperforms the individual defensive talents of it&rsquo;s players. He&rsquo;s the back line, the general, the thing that makes it all go.</p>

<p>AD is a more ferocious rim protector while still being pretty versatile, so he has gotten a little more shine than Bam the last few seasons, but I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any reason to think AD is a better defender overall. I&rsquo;d take either of them over Gobert.</p>

Yes Bam can switch very efficiently one through five but he gives up a lot of size on fives and can get pushed around by the true giants of the league. He doesn’t rack up a lot of blocks and I know that Isn’t the best way of determining how good a rim protector someone is but it does show he isn’t erasing a bunch of shots at the rim unlike some other great defensive bigs.</p>

<p>Now that there’s a narrative, maybe Bam will have a chance but versatility is one of those things where even analytics has issues properly measuring. </p>
