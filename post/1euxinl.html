</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Now this is rather a controversial but necessary post as I am excited for this upcoming season</p>

<p>Every year there are surprised teams, then there are teams that disappoint. The metric I use is based on the offseason acquisitions, potential injuries as well as expectations from the past</p>

<p>Teams that will surprise people:</p>

<p>• Charlotte Hornets: despite them struggling the last two years, I see them surprising some people. Between the injury of Lamelo to the suspension of bridges, I believe external circumstances played a part in their record. With Brandon Miller continuing to develop, as well as Bridges playing a full season, Melo staying healthy, role players on the team, they will surprise people. I see them being the 7th or 8th seed, making it to the playoffs</p>

<p>• Toronto Raptors: Raptors were 3-0 with Quickley, Barrett, Scottie and Poeltl in the lineup. I believe with the continuous development of Barnes, as well as another year of Barrett, I see them making some noise. 7th or 8th seed is a realistic goal, maybe even a chance at the 6th spot. They will make the playoffs, be a tough out</p>

<p>• Milwaukee Bucks: Another year of Dame and Giannis, I believe this time it will be different. Last year was an anomaly as between the coaching situation, turmoil, injuries, Giannis and Dame never developed proper chemistry. I see them making it to the conference finals, being the 2nd seed, Giannis playing a full season</p>

<p>• Denver Nuggets: with the acquisition of Russell Westbrook in the offseason, as well as losing KCP to Orlando, a lot of people are writing off Denver as contenders. Not so quick as they still have Jokic and Murray. In 2022, Jokic lead the Nuggets to the 6th seed despite Murray missing the entire season and MPJ playing in only 9 games. I believe the acquisition of Russell Westbrook will do wonders for them as it’s a terrific bench player who’s also unselfish. He’s also someone who is a great mentor to Payton Watson and Christian Braun, two young guys who will emerge. I see Denver being a top 3 seed, making a deep playoff run, Jokic continuing to dominate. As long as they are healthy, I believe they are still firmly in the race of contenders</p>

<p>Teams that will disappoint/ take a step back:</p>

<p>• New York Knicks: when healthy they are one of the best teams in the east but health has always being a concern. Between OG, Randle and Mitchell Robinson, as well as Thibs, they are simply a what if, a team that’s hopeful of achieving the goal. Losing Hartenstein is big and I believe they will feel the impact</p>

<p>• Minnesota Timberwolves: fresh off a conference finals appearance, the roster has remained intact, with Kyle Anderson going to the Warriors. Despite the fact that they retained the core, I feel like they will take a step back. Combined with the fact that the western conference got a lot better as well as the turmoil between Alex Rodriguez and Glen Taylor, I feel like it will impact them. No longer will they make it to the conference finals, instead I see them losing in the first or maybe second round. Their young guys also hasn’t develop so that’s a problem as well</p>

<p>Teams that are on the fence:</p>

<p>• New Orleans Pelicans: my Pels, where do I begin. With the center situation still being a problem as the situation with BI, I see this season being a wildcard for us. We can either surprise some people by being top 4 in the conference or fall all the way down to the 10th seed, maybe even missing the playoffs. While Zion and DeJounte will still perform as usual, as with Herb and Trey, the center problem is something that will haunt us throughout the year</p>

<p>Comment down below what are some of your surprised teams as well as teams you think that will disappoint. To be fair, I don’t have expectations for most of them as bad teams will remain bad, some teams I’m not familiar with. As for the Clippers and Sixers, well, they are who they are</p>

      <label for="linig8h" class="commentText"><p>Knicks won’t be an upset. They are better than they were last year. IHart loss was tough, but it’s not like he was putting up 20-10…his passing versatility as a big will be missed but Randle small ball 5 minutes will equal that PLUS some. This team isn’t a FINALS lock but they ARE better once they figure it out.</p>

      <label for="linij4o" class="commentText"><p>Bucks are done for. Don&rsquo;t put an old star around Giannis. Either surround him with top teir role players or get him a legit star to help take off the load. I get the Bucks are by definition, a &ldquo;small market&rdquo; team. But it&rsquo;s still possible. The raptors did it with the Kawhi via trade.</p>

<p>Ant made all nba, McDaniels made all defense, and Naz Reid was 6th man of the year. All 25 or younger.</p>

      <label for="link1at" class="commentText"><p>Everyone who went to the Olympics got less rest than they&rsquo;re used to, some of them really need it. Especially the old guys are going to have a very slow start to the season. People are valuing LeBron, Steph and KD too high right now. The guys who are injury prone like Embiid also needed the rest.</p>

<p>I dont think Lakers are making the playoffs, neither is GSW. Those old timers are great in spurts but the regular season is a marathon.</p>
