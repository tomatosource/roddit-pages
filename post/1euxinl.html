</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Now this is rather a controversial but necessary post as I am excited for this upcoming season</p>

<p>Every year there are surprised teams, then there are teams that disappoint. The metric I use is based on the offseason acquisitions, potential injuries as well as expectations from the past</p>

<p>Teams that will surprise people:</p>

<p>• Charlotte Hornets: despite them struggling the last two years, I see them surprising some people. Between the injury of Lamelo to the suspension of bridges, I believe external circumstances played a part in their record. With Brandon Miller continuing to develop, as well as Bridges playing a full season, Melo staying healthy, role players on the team, they will surprise people. I see them being the 7th or 8th seed, making it to the playoffs</p>

<p>• Toronto Raptors: Raptors were 3-0 with Quickley, Barrett, Scottie and Poeltl in the lineup. I believe with the continuous development of Barnes, as well as another year of Barrett, I see them making some noise. 7th or 8th seed is a realistic goal, maybe even a chance at the 6th spot. They will make the playoffs, be a tough out</p>

<p>• Milwaukee Bucks: Another year of Dame and Giannis, I believe this time it will be different. Last year was an anomaly as between the coaching situation, turmoil, injuries, Giannis and Dame never developed proper chemistry. I see them making it to the conference finals, being the 2nd seed, Giannis playing a full season</p>

<p>• Denver Nuggets: with the acquisition of Russell Westbrook in the offseason, as well as losing KCP to Orlando, a lot of people are writing off Denver as contenders. Not so quick as they still have Jokic and Murray. In 2022, Jokic lead the Nuggets to the 6th seed despite Murray missing the entire season and MPJ playing in only 9 games. I believe the acquisition of Russell Westbrook will do wonders for them as it’s a terrific bench player who’s also unselfish. He’s also someone who is a great mentor to Payton Watson and Christian Braun, two young guys who will emerge. I see Denver being a top 3 seed, making a deep playoff run, Jokic continuing to dominate. As long as they are healthy, I believe they are still firmly in the race of contenders</p>

<p>Teams that will disappoint/ take a step back:</p>

<p>• New York Knicks: when healthy they are one of the best teams in the east but health has always being a concern. Between OG, Randle and Mitchell Robinson, as well as Thibs, they are simply a what if, a team that’s hopeful of achieving the goal. Losing Hartenstein is big and I believe they will feel the impact</p>

<p>• Minnesota Timberwolves: fresh off a conference finals appearance, the roster has remained intact, with Kyle Anderson going to the Warriors. Despite the fact that they retained the core, I feel like they will take a step back. Combined with the fact that the western conference got a lot better as well as the turmoil between Alex Rodriguez and Glen Taylor, I feel like it will impact them. No longer will they make it to the conference finals, instead I see them losing in the first or maybe second round. Their young guys also hasn’t develop so that’s a problem as well</p>

<p>Teams that are on the fence:</p>

<p>• New Orleans Pelicans: my Pels, where do I begin. With the center situation still being a problem as the situation with BI, I see this season being a wildcard for us. We can either surprise some people by being top 4 in the conference or fall all the way down to the 10th seed, maybe even missing the playoffs. While Zion and DeJounte will still perform as usual, as with Herb and Trey, the center problem is something that will haunt us throughout the year</p>

<p>Comment down below what are some of your surprised teams as well as teams you think that will disappoint. To be fair, I don’t have expectations for most of them as bad teams will remain bad, some teams I’m not familiar with. As for the Clippers and Sixers, well, they are who they are</p>

<p>It felt like alot of people were just concern trolling about how the jazz will be too good to tank so they need to trade lauri. Like no it’s not that hard to tank in the west when your best players are lauri markkannen, Colin sexton, John Collins and Walker Kessler.</p>

<p>West should be tough. As a Pels fan, I have no expectation for us as we can either do good or bad, depending on injuries as well as coaching</p>

      <label for="link1at" class="commentText"><p>Everyone who went to the Olympics got less rest than they&rsquo;re used to, some of them really need it. Especially the old guys are going to have a very slow start to the season. People are valuing LeBron, Steph and KD too high right now. The guys who are injury prone like Embiid also needed the rest.</p>

<p>I dont think Lakers are making the playoffs, neither is GSW. Those old timers are great in spurts but the regular season is a marathon.</p>

      <label for="lio6uwk" class="commentText"><p>GSW and Lakers being bad has nothing to do with Steph or LeBron. The rest of the squad around them sucks. Olympics is barely 20mins a night for two weeks for these guys and KD literally plays more intense pick up games during the off season. Unless they got injured in the games already it won’t have any bearing on their recovery.</p>

<p>And yes, it does have something to do with them being old as well, they can&rsquo;t carry for 35mins/game at the same level they could previously.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s delusional thinking it wouldn&rsquo;t play a big part, we have this discussion every year there is a big off-season tournament and not just in basketball.</p>

And OG Anunoby and Mitchell Robinson are definitely injury concerns especially since the knicks lost Hartenstein so they have no good back up centre and OG just got a 212 million dollar contract</p>

      <label for="linxtz9" class="commentText"><p>Even if all Smart is for the Grizzlies is a better version of Brooks the fit will be fine.</p>

<p>In the grizzlies best years with this core, they played a lot of lineups with two ball handlers (Ja and Tyus). Those lineups worker and Smart allows them to happen with better defense and size without sacrificing shooting (which they had to do with Tyus).</p>

<p>They can also stagger a lot of looks depending on matchup with Smart’s passing and JJJ learning to run the offense a little bit last year.</p>

<p>Plus, VWJ, GG, and Pippen Jr saw good developmental minutes.</p>

<p>The bigger concern from the Grizzlies is not the 2/3…It’s the 5.</p>

      <label for="lioblo1" class="commentText"><p>My point being that defense is near irrelevant with how potent of an offense they have.  Their defensive troubles come from turning every game into a track meet which gives opponents more shots relative to other opponents and a young team that gets in foul trouble early giving up -6.7fta/game.</p>

<p>Youngest team since the 2011 thunder to make the conference finals.</p>

<p>Anyone that believes they’re a fluke can talk to my boy Roy</p>

<p>I’d be more optimistic if they were ranked like 15th or better but 22nd? Lol no way.</p>

<p>The most strongly correlated stat to championship teams over the last 25 years is net field goals.  20 of the top 21 post season teams for net field goals have made the finals since the 1999-00 season and 16 of those won championships.</p>

<p>Health is also part of the equation so who tf knows if they lose to a healthy bucks/knicks because it didn’t happen.</p>

Kris middleton looked really good for a guy coming off injury and going pretty cold into the playoffs. Dame is coming off a down year, it’s not enough to say he’s really in decline significantly. He has had a bad year and then bounced back in Portland. Giannis is too good even if dame is partly washed to not do something with this core.</p>

<p>They replaced crowder and Beverly with Prince and Wright, who aren’t world beaters but will atleast be playable in the playoffs and aren’t washed.</p>

<p>But yes, the starting 5 has the best defensive rating and net rating, but I’m pretty sure the bench was bottom 5 atleast, although Portis and Connaughton did play better once doc came</p>

<p>The stars and coach finally have some stability and a year playing together as well. If healthy they will be in the conference finals. The key I think will be dominating regular season games early so guys can play less minutes like they did under Bud. Last year was terrible Griffin and Doc burned them up because they had no cushion for seeding.</p>

Don&rsquo;t know why Knicks are obsessed with Kessler recently he&rsquo;s not that good and Jazz fans are upset he seems to have regressed.</p>

<p>PJ Washington played well after the trade. Maybe Kessler is on a bad team, who knows</p>

The point of Bridge&rsquo;s defense is to harass and make his life harder. Same with OG, you hope those two can slow/harass the best teams player but they aren&rsquo;t going to stop superstars from scoring.</p>

      <label for="lio8le4" class="commentText"><p>I’m a Cavs fan so I’m obviously biased, but I do think the Cavs could surprise some people this year. I’ve been surprised by how little they’re talked about (including in this thread). Cavs had a really weird year last year with Mobley and Garland missing time and Garland never looking quite right under a coach that it sure looked like the team was on the outs with while the uncertainty of Mitchell’s contract situation hung over everything. Even with all that, Cavs gave Boston either their first or second most competitive series while missing Allen for the whole series and Mitchell for part of it. I get that the turnoff for many is that the positional redundancy in talent remains.</p>

<p>But all of the big four other than Mitchell are now locked up for like five years, and Mitchell is under contract for three. Cavs have a new coach who is likely to be much better at coaching offense while the D should remain elite. There’s evidence Mobley is learning to shoot and if he can even be passable on low to mid volume it resolves basically all the offensive fit questions around the team. Dudes are mostly all young. Even with all the ups and downs of the last two years, they’ve been the four seed both years and around 50 wins. Think there’s a lot of reasons to believe they can improve upon that.</p>

<p>Literally everybody expects to Giannis and Dame to have better chemistry in Year 2. The Bucks were the second-best team in the East. Finished third (by a game) since their regular season unraveled.</p>

<p>Only the Celtics had a better record than the Nuggets last season. Losing KCP isn&rsquo;t ideal. Sure. I&rsquo;m not falling for some bullshit narrative though. The Nuggets roster has already won a title and have their four best players returning - including a 3x MVP that is still in his 20s!!!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d be surprised if they go 82-0. Or 74-8. But, would I be remotely surprised if they finish with the #1 seed in the West? Fuck no.</p>

They lost real NBA players last season in Hayward, Rozier, PJ Washington. They have several young guys that project to be significant parts of the rotation and don&rsquo;t have a lot of vets. You look at other teams that were around the Hornets level last year and a lot had way more significant signings in the offseason. Unless LaMelo is healthy the whole season and Miller takes a big jump I don&rsquo;t think they have any chance at the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="lio56ah" class="commentText"><p>Yet they were the only team that gave Boston a scare in the entire playoffs. Hali got injured too and didn&rsquo;t play for the entire series. People see the end result and just view it as them being swept, but the actual games were close with them leading for the majority of them and Boston just squeezing past in the 4th quarters.</p>

<p>Every game could&rsquo;ve gone either way and it wasn&rsquo;t just their offense that kept them close. It was their defense too. Like I said, they don&rsquo;t play hero ball, where they depend on one player to carry them offensively. They play team ball and know how to play a defensive game.</p>

<p>I think we just view things differently because against Boston it didn&rsquo;t feel like a total mismatch looking at individual players and how they contributed on the court, as opposed to other teams. They matched up well against Boston.</p>

<p>Also injuries are part of the game. Can&rsquo;t stay healthy and lack the depth to counter injuries that&rsquo;s on those teams. Pacers earned their spot.</p>

      <label for="lio7wac" class="commentText"><p>No shit they were the only team to give Boston problems, because every other team had significant injuries. I can’t deny the pacers are probably the deepest in the league though so when Haliburton went down it wasn’t as big of a blow as it was for Heat and Cavs.</p>

<p>Their defense is ass, no matter how bad you wanna try to gas it up to make the Celtics look better. They were ranked 13 out of 15 in defensive rating.</p>

<p>The fact the games were so close was because of Celtics, the second they locked in, the pacers looked lost.</p>

<p>If they were truly that good, they would’ve swept the bucks and beat the Knicks in at most 5 games. But no, they were struggling against Middleton and Beverley and got blown out by 30 twice. Thens struggled to beat Knicks missing half their rotation.</p>

<p>There’s never been a bottom 10 defense team to win a championship and it’s not going to start with the Pacers.</p>

<p>yea center spot remains a concern but getting Dejounte still addressed a big hole and shifts CJ back to his natural SG spot</p>
