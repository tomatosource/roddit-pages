</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Now this is rather a controversial but necessary post as I am excited for this upcoming season</p>

<p>Every year there are surprised teams, then there are teams that disappoint. The metric I use is based on the offseason acquisitions, potential injuries as well as expectations from the past</p>

<p>Teams that will surprise people:</p>

<p>• Charlotte Hornets: despite them struggling the last two years, I see them surprising some people. Between the injury of Lamelo to the suspension of bridges, I believe external circumstances played a part in their record. With Brandon Miller continuing to develop, as well as Bridges playing a full season, Melo staying healthy, role players on the team, they will surprise people. I see them being the 7th or 8th seed, making it to the playoffs</p>

<p>• Toronto Raptors: Raptors were 3-0 with Quickley, Barrett, Scottie and Poeltl in the lineup. I believe with the continuous development of Barnes, as well as another year of Barrett, I see them making some noise. 7th or 8th seed is a realistic goal, maybe even a chance at the 6th spot. They will make the playoffs, be a tough out</p>

<p>• Milwaukee Bucks: Another year of Dame and Giannis, I believe this time it will be different. Last year was an anomaly as between the coaching situation, turmoil, injuries, Giannis and Dame never developed proper chemistry. I see them making it to the conference finals, being the 2nd seed, Giannis playing a full season</p>

<p>• Denver Nuggets: with the acquisition of Russell Westbrook in the offseason, as well as losing KCP to Orlando, a lot of people are writing off Denver as contenders. Not so quick as they still have Jokic and Murray. In 2022, Jokic lead the Nuggets to the 6th seed despite Murray missing the entire season and MPJ playing in only 9 games. I believe the acquisition of Russell Westbrook will do wonders for them as it’s a terrific bench player who’s also unselfish. He’s also someone who is a great mentor to Payton Watson and Christian Braun, two young guys who will emerge. I see Denver being a top 3 seed, making a deep playoff run, Jokic continuing to dominate. As long as they are healthy, I believe they are still firmly in the race of contenders</p>

<p>Teams that will disappoint/ take a step back:</p>

<p>• New York Knicks: when healthy they are one of the best teams in the east but health has always being a concern. Between OG, Randle and Mitchell Robinson, as well as Thibs, they are simply a what if, a team that’s hopeful of achieving the goal. Losing Hartenstein is big and I believe they will feel the impact</p>

<p>• Minnesota Timberwolves: fresh off a conference finals appearance, the roster has remained intact, with Kyle Anderson going to the Warriors. Despite the fact that they retained the core, I feel like they will take a step back. Combined with the fact that the western conference got a lot better as well as the turmoil between Alex Rodriguez and Glen Taylor, I feel like it will impact them. No longer will they make it to the conference finals, instead I see them losing in the first or maybe second round. Their young guys also hasn’t develop so that’s a problem as well</p>

<p>Teams that are on the fence:</p>

<p>• New Orleans Pelicans: my Pels, where do I begin. With the center situation still being a problem as the situation with BI, I see this season being a wildcard for us. We can either surprise some people by being top 4 in the conference or fall all the way down to the 10th seed, maybe even missing the playoffs. While Zion and DeJounte will still perform as usual, as with Herb and Trey, the center problem is something that will haunt us throughout the year</p>

<p>Comment down below what are some of your surprised teams as well as teams you think that will disappoint. To be fair, I don’t have expectations for most of them as bad teams will remain bad, some teams I’m not familiar with. As for the Clippers and Sixers, well, they are who they are</p>

<p>It felt like alot of people were just concern trolling about how the jazz will be too good to tank so they need to trade lauri. Like no it’s not that hard to tank in the west when your best players are lauri markkannen, Colin sexton, John Collins and Walker Kessler.</p>

Especially the old guys are going to have a very slow start to the season. People are valuing LeBron, Steph and KD too high right now. The guys who are injury prone like Embiid also needed the rest.</p>

<p>I dont think Lakers are making the playoffs, neither is GSW. Those old timers are great in spurts but the regular season is a marathon.</p>

      <label for="linxtz9" class="commentText"><p>Even if all Smart is for the Grizzlies is a better version of Brooks the fit will be fine.</p>

<p>In the grizzlies best years with this core, they played a lot of lineups with two ball handlers (Ja and Tyus). Those lineups worker and Smart allows them to happen with better defense and size without sacrificing shooting (which they had to do with Tyus).</p>

<p>They can also stagger a lot of looks depending on matchup with Smart’s passing and JJJ learning to run the offense a little bit last year.</p>

<p>Plus, VWJ, GG, and Pippen Jr saw good developmental minutes.</p>

<p>The bigger concern from the Grizzlies is not the 2/3…It’s the 5.</p>

Kris middleton looked really good for a guy coming off injury and going pretty cold into the playoffs. Dame is coming off a down year, it’s not enough to say he’s really in decline significantly. He has had a bad year and then bounced back in Portland. Giannis is too good even if dame is partly washed to not do something with this core.</p>

IHart loss was tough, but it’s not like he was putting up 20-10…his passing versatility as a big will be missed but Randle small ball 5 minutes will equal that PLUS some.

      <label for="linmozq" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t see the logic of the Hornets making the playoffs. They did almost nothing in the offseason signing Seth Curry and Taj Gibson. They lost real NBA players last season in Hayward, Rozier, PJ Washington. They have several young guys that project to be significant parts of the rotation and don&rsquo;t have a lot of vets. You look at other teams that were around the Hornets level last year and a lot had way more significant signings in the offseason. Unless LaMelo is healthy the whole season and Miller takes a big jump I don&rsquo;t think they have any chance at the playoffs.</p>

<p>Mitchell Robinson is good but injury prone. What happens if he goes down? Can’t trust Sims. Who else do they have?</p>

      <label for="linw0e1" class="commentText"><p>The center issue is definitely gonna get addressed by Leon somehow by the trade deadline to my annoyance.  Still unless Leon performs black magic or trades Randle it won&rsquo;t be a huge needle mover like Nic Claxton. Don&rsquo;t know why Knicks are obsessed with Kessler recently he&rsquo;s not that good and Jazz fans are upset he seems to have regressed.</p>

      <label for="linwc16" class="commentText"><p>Kessler is a disappointment but I don’t know if it’s because of the situation in Utah or because he’s just not that good</p>

<p>PJ Washington played well after the trade. Maybe Kessler is on a bad team, who knows</p>

<p>yea center spot remains a concern but getting Dejounte still addressed a big hole and shifts CJ back to his natural SG spot</p>
