</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Now this is rather a controversial but necessary post as I am excited for this upcoming season</p>

<p>Every year there are surprised teams, then there are teams that disappoint. The metric I use is based on the offseason acquisitions, potential injuries as well as expectations from the past</p>

<p>Teams that will surprise people:</p>

<p>• Charlotte Hornets: despite them struggling the last two years, I see them surprising some people. Between the injury of Lamelo to the suspension of bridges, I believe external circumstances played a part in their record. With Brandon Miller continuing to develop, as well as Bridges playing a full season, Melo staying healthy, role players on the team, they will surprise people. I see them being the 7th or 8th seed, making it to the playoffs</p>

<p>• Toronto Raptors: Raptors were 3-0 with Quickley, Barrett, Scottie and Poeltl in the lineup. I believe with the continuous development of Barnes, as well as another year of Barrett, I see them making some noise. 7th or 8th seed is a realistic goal, maybe even a chance at the 6th spot. They will make the playoffs, be a tough out</p>

<p>• Milwaukee Bucks: Another year of Dame and Giannis, I believe this time it will be different. Last year was an anomaly as between the coaching situation, turmoil, injuries, Giannis and Dame never developed proper chemistry. I see them making it to the conference finals, being the 2nd seed, Giannis playing a full season</p>

<p>• Denver Nuggets: with the acquisition of Russell Westbrook in the offseason, as well as losing KCP to Orlando, a lot of people are writing off Denver as contenders. Not so quick as they still have Jokic and Murray. In 2022, Jokic lead the Nuggets to the 6th seed despite Murray missing the entire season and MPJ playing in only 9 games. I believe the acquisition of Russell Westbrook will do wonders for them as it’s a terrific bench player who’s also unselfish. He’s also someone who is a great mentor to Payton Watson and Christian Braun, two young guys who will emerge. I see Denver being a top 3 seed, making a deep playoff run, Jokic continuing to dominate. As long as they are healthy, I believe they are still firmly in the race of contenders</p>

<p>Teams that will disappoint/ take a step back:</p>

<p>• New York Knicks: when healthy they are one of the best teams in the east but health has always being a concern. Between OG, Randle and Mitchell Robinson, as well as Thibs, they are simply a what if, a team that’s hopeful of achieving the goal. Losing Hartenstein is big and I believe they will feel the impact</p>

<p>• Minnesota Timberwolves: fresh off a conference finals appearance, the roster has remained intact, with Kyle Anderson going to the Warriors. Despite the fact that they retained the core, I feel like they will take a step back. Combined with the fact that the western conference got a lot better as well as the turmoil between Alex Rodriguez and Glen Taylor, I feel like it will impact them. No longer will they make it to the conference finals, instead I see them losing in the first or maybe second round. Their young guys also hasn’t develop so that’s a problem as well</p>

<p>Teams that are on the fence:</p>

<p>• New Orleans Pelicans: my Pels, where do I begin. With the center situation still being a problem as the situation with BI, I see this season being a wildcard for us. We can either surprise some people by being top 4 in the conference or fall all the way down to the 10th seed, maybe even missing the playoffs. While Zion and DeJounte will still perform as usual, as with Herb and Trey, the center problem is something that will haunt us throughout the year</p>

<p>Comment down below what are some of your surprised teams as well as teams you think that will disappoint. To be fair, I don’t have expectations for most of them as bad teams will remain bad, some teams I’m not familiar with. As for the Clippers and Sixers, well, they are who they are</p>

Especially the old guys are going to have a very slow start to the season. People are valuing LeBron, Steph and KD too high right now. The guys who are injury prone like Embiid also needed the rest.</p>

<p>I dont think Lakers are making the playoffs, neither is GSW. Those old timers are great in spurts but the regular season is a marathon.</p>

      <label for="linr2d8" class="commentText"><p>The Raptors next season are in this weird place where I think it’s almost the popular opinion that “they could surprise the league”, and they’re going to end up just being this borderline play-in team again.</p>

<p>The starting lineup is interesting, but we still have terrible depth.</p>

      <label for="lins6bi" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m really curious about the Bucks they had a perfect as possible off-season with the little amount of assets they had but chemistry won&rsquo;t change the fact that Dame is 34 years old father time is undefeated. LeBron doesn&rsquo;t count he&rsquo;s still putting up nice stats but no serious title contender is scared of him at this stage.</p>

      <label for="linscuh" class="commentText"><p>I love that I’ve seen multiple “Randle is injury prone” type posts this offseason after a freak accident from a dirty Heat play took him out last season. Prior to said injury, he was known as a marathon man, especially since joining the Knicks, as he barely missed time. But okay</p>

<p>Pels will be a playoff team</p>

<p>Wolves will regress in playoffs</p>

      <label for="linnlzi" class="commentText"><p>I mean they did just make playoffs last season. them not having more playoff appearances has always been due to health, not lack of talent</p>

<p>yea center spot remains a concern but getting Dejounte still addressed a big hole and shifts CJ back to his natural SG spot</p>

      <label for="linmozq" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t see the logic of the Hornets making the playoffs. They did almost nothing in the offseason signing Seth Curry and Taj Gibson. They lost real NBA players last season in Hayward, Rozier, PJ Washington. They have several young guys that project to be significant parts of the rotation and don&rsquo;t have a lot of vets. You look at other teams that were around the Hornets level last year and a lot had way more significant signings in the offseason. Unless LaMelo is healthy the whole season and Miller takes a big jump I don&rsquo;t think they have any chance at the playoffs.</p>
