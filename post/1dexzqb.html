      <label for="l8f3bfq" class="commentText"><p>YouTuber 70sfan I have to give credit to of course for a lot of the high quality new stuff the past few years - I started out hunting for rare footage over a decade ago but the past few years he has hunted down even more. I am getting back into the swing of things lately and will continue to do so but I want to give him a shoutout as well. Gives us fans a chance to really catch a glimpse at some of these players doing their thing. Some of the quality is higher than a lot of early 80&rsquo;s, 90&rsquo;s and early &lsquo;00&rsquo;s stuff since it&rsquo;s 16mm film transfers instead of VHS transfers</p>

      <label for="l8fd4mh" class="commentText"><p>Great video. Something I think is really impressive about Jerry and other guys who played in the old days, is how elite they were at still getting off their shots without being able to do any sort of fancy dribbling to create space. That is a skill within itself, that I think many modern players would really struggle to do if they tried.</p>

      <label for="l8ffhl9" class="commentText"><p>You hit the nail on the head. With the rules, what people often completely fail to understand if they aren&rsquo;t familiar with that era is that you couldn&rsquo;t hesitate your dribble, put your hand on the bottom half of the ball at all, gather steps were interpreted super early not super late (2 step travels were common in that era), and charging calls were ridiculously sensitive to the degree defenders could be on the move or undercut you but if you even nudged them with your off arm it was likely going to get you a charge call.</p>

<p>So how does a great offensive player combat that? Well, a variety of ways but one of the best ever was Jerry West&rsquo;s solution on display right here. This is a SKILL that no player today has, created by a master at the craft of yesteryears game. Because everything was a palms-down tap style dribble, he came up with doing his final dribble extra hard to basically propel it up into his shooting motion. The level of precision that requires to even do that stationary is insane, let alone dynamically during a game. Which is why the testimony mentions Jerry West never wasted time &ldquo;catching&rdquo; and gathering the ball. Watch the tape. It&rsquo;s incredible to watch if you&rsquo;re a hooper. That is some seriously blazing fast shooting because there is zero setup time. When West wanted to shoot if you blinked as the defender you&rsquo;d miss it. Today players obviously are great and as skilled as ever but they are skilled with an array of tools that make sense to today&rsquo;s game. With all the hesitations and other things allowed, this specific skill went extinct. Jerry was the best ever at it.</p>

      <label for="l8fhd02" class="commentText"><p>what is so fun too is that you can trace this exact move through so many elite guards. Pistol Pete directly copied and mastered this move from West. MJ and then Kobe too, even steph had a version of it, nash had a nasty one.</p>

      <label for="l8fhndi" class="commentText"><p>Excellent video. The thing I love about basketball is how you can literally see the development of the game through the greats. Watch Jerry then watch Pete, then watch Nash and then watch Curry. You’ll see the similarities in the way they navigate bodies and negotiate to the rim. You can see the same “oh shit” fear of the jumper. You will never convince me that the greats wouldn’t figure it out if they played in the modern era.</p>

      <label for="l8fkx7w" class="commentText"><p>Super quick! West wasn&rsquo;t even trying to shoot deep as there was little point in shooting deep in that era short of creating driving space if you needed it (ala Dolph Schayes used to do this). Close was actually best so long as you had enough room to drive from your favorite shooting spots! Had he played in a 3 point era he&rsquo;d have practiced the standards for range accordingly and thus had more of it naturally. Seeing that pull up even as he&rsquo;s playing 1 on 1 really makes it easy to see what a great shooter he was</p>
