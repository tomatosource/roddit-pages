<p>I think Melo needed a true PG to succeed, which is why his best season came with Billups running the offense.</p>

      <label for="l9bk5ep" class="commentText"><p>Boozer was getting paid 15mil a year (a lot back then) and often sat in the 4th because he was such a liability on defense. His style was largely obsolete by time his contract expired.</p>

<p>Deng was maybe slightly underrated but he was a fringe all star, off ball wing. A great #3 option but he just didn&rsquo;t have the offensive talent to be a reliable #2.</p>

<p>Jimmy Butler was a steal and if he was the player he became in Philly/Miami I think they had a chance in 2015. I mentioned in my other comment, they drafted well but they just consistently fell short in FA to get that win now talent.</p>

      <label for="l9bgokx" class="commentText"><p>Nah I refuse that . Boozer n ither coukd svore a bit and while that Chicago team didn’t have a secondary high lvl scorer they didn’t need one they were a defensive first team and there amazing defence was why they got the n1 seed. Getting rose more offensive talent at cost of defence woukd reduce rose value and that team already played well when he sat anyway ( compare Miami Lebron off vs Chicago rose off).</p>

<p>I think those bulls teams were pretty well built , that and Thibs cosching . They got rolled in 2011 conference finals because Lebron ( and Wade ) started hitting everything and Lebron defensively was a monster n huge issue for Chicago. But they were a 62 win team . And n1 seed over Miami . And those games were close.</p>

<p>One thing I hate is that cos if Dallas finals people ignore yhe ECF being great with close games and Lebron coming through , and Wade tho he obv had a good finaks too .</p>

<p>If I have a Luka , an AI or harden I’m surrounding those guys with defensive players first. People ignore this but Dirk n nash didn’t fit together that well . They were better apart but people meme Dallas letting him go. I think the bulls had enough offensive talent too tbh. And guys that grew had rose stayed healthy</p>

      <label for="l9biz8u" class="commentText"><p>You can refuse it all you want but the results are there for you. I hated the 1 seed discourse then, I hate it now. The goal isn&rsquo;t to get a 1 seed, it&rsquo;s to win a championship. Everything you listed is why they were a great regular season team, but couldn&rsquo;t get over the hump in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Jordan needed a Pippen, Lebron needed a Kyrie/AD/Wade/Bosh, Jokic needed a Murray, Kobe needed a Shaq/Gasol. There&rsquo;s only really one example of a #1 player not having a clear #2 in the past 20 years and that&rsquo;s Dirk.</p>

<p>To say they didn&rsquo;t need a second scorer means you did not watch that Chi/Mia ECF. They focused their entire defensive energy on Rose after game 1 and held him to well under 40% shooting on the way to a gentlemen&rsquo;s sweep.</p>

<p>I do think Pax era drafted pretty well. They weren&rsquo;t entirely incompetent, but they just couldn&rsquo;t make much noise in FA in an era where FA was most important.</p>

<p>Everybody idolizes Jordan and makes it seem like a no brainer that regardless of where he went he would win, but in reality there are plenty of ways a team could have fucked it up. The bulls aren’t simply lucky to land him. They executed to perfection the team building around him.</p>

<p>They are both lucky to have landed on each other when they did.</p>

      <label for="l9bhdvp" class="commentText"><p>Which really doesn’t mean… anything.</p>

<p>It takes a perfect scenario to play out with teams to win a title. You can land on KD, Russ, Harden and Ibaka and come away with one finals appearance. Had they made that run a different year, against a different team out East, who knows. Meanwhile the Warriors were able to walk away with 4 rings, and 3 of them came from in part the good fortune of playing against an injury decimated team in the finals for one, and an unprecedented cap spike aligning with the free agency of an all time great player for the other 2. Different circumstances could see that team win just one, or zero. Impossible to know because it never happened that way because they found a perfect window and capitalized.</p>

<p>Hell the bulls had D Rose and he got injured as well as run into a historically great team. Do I believe he wins a ring if he stays healthy? Personally no, but who knows. It depends on what the rest of the league does and all sorts of things playing out perfectly.</p>

<p>Jordan could have landed on a team with no vision to properly build around him. Rodman could have no wound up available the very year they needed to plug somebody into his position.</p>

<p>I could go on and on, but their success without him is literally completely irrelevant. It’s hard to win in the nba</p>

There are teams that have been much worse . Add in you’d always expect 5years or so post mj dynasty for rebuilding . Plenty of teams never been contenders like 11 bulls n 62 wins over Miami heatles . Also during mj time they made a lot of really great moves n great building of the team with forward thinking</p>

Hired Phil and essentially saved his career, personally scouted Scottie and recognized his ability before a lot of other GMs and got Horace in the same draft, retooled the Bulls during MJ&rsquo;s retirement, got Rodman for scraps. He got a lot of shit for saying orgs win chips but he did almost everything right those years, and so I can&rsquo;t say he was wrong.</p>

<p>When Pippen and Horace joined, Horace was seen as the better of the two and even then their averages were not good. They were serviceable at best.</p>

<p>What many people fail to realize is that because Michael Jordan had set a standard for himself and his team, everyone else had to be on board with that level of maniacal practice and work ethic, or you just weren’t gonna cut it. He deserves every bit of credit.</p>
