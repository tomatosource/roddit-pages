      <label for="l9d0nqh" class="commentText"><p>Melo is maybe one of the best one-on-one players ever. He was (and probably still is) unstoppable out of triple threat. Best jap, strong, could drive well either direction, soft jumper. There is a reason most pros look at Melo with complete respect. He is better than almost all of them at some of the most fundamental skills in basketball.</p>

<p>But he is a rube. If he just played a more passive game he could have dominated. Picture Melo with a player like Tyrese Haliburton or Stockton for instance. It was all about Melo, though, which ultimately hurt his career because it&rsquo;s boring as fuck to play with a blackhole like that. Which is why he was, is, and will always be overrated. He deserves it.</p>

      <label for="l9cg6ar" class="commentText"><p>When in history does a star player not have to face adversity?</p>

<p>Duncan and the Spurs had to fight Kobe and Shaq, Dirk and the Mavs, Nash and the Suns, and vice versa for all of them, Lebron literally had to fight the big 3 of the Celtics before making his own, then beat those Pacers with PG13 and Roy Hibbert in his allstar days, and the Bulls with D Rose, Boozer, Noah and Deng, and it’s not like Melo was out there alone he had allstar Amare Stoudemire who was quite frankly doing more than him for a long stretch, let’s not forget Linsanity only happened because Melo got hurt when the Knicks were playing bad and when he was out Jeremy Lin led them on a winning streak with Amare, they were actually playing better without him</p>

<p>You can make excuses for Melo all you want but he never got it done and even in losing played like shit, no one in recent NBA history could go 31-51 and then 32-50 back to back seasons in their prime and still be talked about like he&rsquo;s one of the best ever lmao</p>

<p>Melo was and is still overrated</p>

<p>The Wolves went 33-49 and 32-50 in back to back seasons with KG 2 years after his MVP season.</p>

<p>Though I suppose people who talk about KG are well aware of how horrendous those rosters were.</p>

They had bad perimeter scoring, they did not have a go to isolation player, and they could not spread the court well so defenses could collapse on Rose. Melo would&rsquo;ve fixed all those problems.</p>

<p>Those Bulls teams were elite on defense already with Joakim Noah holding down the paint and Jimmy butler guarding the best perimeter player.</p>

      <label for="l9ci8sh" class="commentText"><p>Boozer was really good when he was the lead option on offense (like in Utah) and could basically score 20-25 to offset his defense. The less he was used on offense, the more of a liability he became.</p>

<p>He was starting to decline a little even before he left Utah and it was just a bad fit signing, IMO.</p>

<p>(their biggest mistake at that point was getting rid of korver to bring back hinrich. they tried to offset the loss with dunleavy a season later, and with getting mirotić and mcdermott, but no-one could stretch the floor like korver did)</p>

      <label for="l9detki" class="commentText"><p>Krause was lucky too. He had some home runs early but his drafting for most of the 90s was horrible and most those guys flamed out of the league. Kukoc was kind of a no brained pick that teams just weren’t as fortunate to risk a stash as Chicago was</p>

<p>Not even going to mention how bad he did after drafting Brand and inexplicably trading him for his next great idea (Eddy Curry/Chandler pairing)</p>

<p>Krause was just as lucky as anyone else. I’d put him a tier or 2 below the best GMs. I only say 2 tiers because we cannot discount the fact his personality and ego played a massive part in destroying a dynasty. Just like with coaches, you have to be able to have good relationships with your players and peers</p>

      <label for="l9e1jv2" class="commentText"><p>If you go way back to the beginning, they lucked into Jerry Sloan, too.</p>

<p>Sloan was a rookie on the Bullets and had been picked #4 overall the previous season. When the Bulls were founded in 67 and there was an expansion draft. Each team could protect seven players and the Bullets planned on protecting Sloan. But the Bulls hinted that they were going to take centers from them, so they left Sloan unprotected to protect their two younger centers.</p>

<p>The Bulls then picked a center (Red Kerr, who was ready to retire) and Jerry Sloan. Kerr would retire and go on to coach the Bulls, and Sloan - the first picked player from the expansion draft - became known as &ldquo;The Original Bull&rdquo; and would have a long career in Chicago, making a couple All Star Games and being named to the All Defensive team six times.</p>

<p>Everybody idolizes Jordan and makes it seem like a no brainer that regardless of where he went he would win, but in reality there are plenty of ways a team could have fucked it up. The bulls aren’t simply lucky to land him. They executed to perfection the team building around him.</p>

<p>Foot injuries have pretty famously derailed a lot of careers. Even though it’s not quite as outlandish as Mark Jackson, they explicitly did not follow the advice of the medical staff and Jordan luckily did not further his injury.</p>

Scottie fit into the second banana role perfectly because of Jordan’s expectations. There’s another realm in which Scottie is just some athletic scorer who never wins a ring.

      <label for="l9de0n6" class="commentText"><p>The thing is this all has to do with MJ though</p>

<p>LeBron, especially earlier in his career, didn’t really adjust his game much to play into a system. The reason a team like Chicago could still play decently even in his absence was because those players were brought in to fit the system, and not a specific players skillset. Most of LeBrons teams the exact opposite was true - his teams were built to fit his skillset, and were dependent on him (Ben Taylor mentioned this in his Backpicks profile on LeBron). LeBron supercharged dependent talent like no one in history, but because his impact is so greatly diminished when he’s NOT your teams system, his teams peaks weren’t as high as MJs, who adjusted his game to allow Scottie and others to thrive. MJ very easily could’ve been both the primary facilitator and scorer for his team, he did it plenty and it even worked on the biggest stage (See 91 Finals), but that style of play limited Pippens own ability to contribute </p>

<p>San Antonio saw a similar thing. Their core aged out yet they could still be a pretty decent team due to the players fitting their system and not necessarily just their star. It worked up until they blew the whole team up</p>

<p>The only team today that you could see something similar with would be Boston. I don’t say that because of how deep they are, but because of how consistently they’ve been successful with their core that’s still in its prime. That MJ h championship experience matters greatly, as it means the role players are all buying in to the system because they know it works, they trust their coach and each other. </p>

      <label for="l9bhdvp" class="commentText"><p>Which really doesn’t mean… anything.</p>

<p>It takes a perfect scenario to play out with teams to win a title. You can land on KD, Russ, Harden and Ibaka and come away with one finals appearance. Had they made that run a different year, against a different team out East, who knows. Meanwhile the Warriors were able to walk away with 4 rings, and 3 of them came from in part the good fortune of playing against an injury decimated team in the finals for one, and an unprecedented cap spike aligning with the free agency of an all time great player for the other 2. Different circumstances could see that team win just one, or zero. Impossible to know because it never happened that way because they found a perfect window and capitalized.</p>

<p>Hell the bulls had D Rose and he got injured as well as run into a historically great team. Do I believe he wins a ring if he stays healthy? Personally no, but who knows. It depends on what the rest of the league does and all sorts of things playing out perfectly.</p>

<p>Jordan could have landed on a team with no vision to properly build around him. Rodman could have no wound up available the very year they needed to plug somebody into his position.</p>

<p>I could go on and on, but their success without him is literally completely irrelevant. It’s hard to win in the nba</p>

      <label for="l9cccqk" class="commentText"><p>Okay sure so let’s use Conference Finals appearances as a rough gauge. Even without MJ and assuming the Bulls don’t make one from ‘89-‘98, that gives them 3. That’s still more than 8 teams on the list. Take Curry away from the Warriors and they’d have 3. Take Duncan away from the Spurs and they’re at 5. The Cavs are at 2 without LeBron. The Rockets without Hakeem? 3. The Jazz without Malone or Stockton? 2.</p>

There are teams that have been much worse . Add in you’d always expect 5years or so post mj dynasty for rebuilding . Plenty of teams never been contenders like 11 bulls n 62 wins over Miami heatles . Also during mj time they made a lot of really great moves n great building of the team with forward thinking</p>

      <label for="l9bk14i" class="commentText"><p>Jordan joined a team that was almost last in the conference. His rookie year he gave them another 11 wins, being the only weapon, and got them to the playoffs to face Bird’s Celtics and Magic’s Lakers, as a ROOKIE.</p>

<p>When Pippen and Horace joined, Horace was seen as the better of the two and even then their averages were not good. They were serviceable at best.</p>

<p>What many people fail to realize is that because Michael Jordan had set a standard for himself and his team, everyone else had to be on board with that level of maniacal practice and work ethic, or you just weren’t gonna cut it. He deserves every bit of credit.</p>

<p>This is such a bizarre take on what I just said. I didn’t say Jordan wasn’t involved with winning titles. They built teams around him because they had him… that’s… what you’re supposed to do?</p>

<p>And do you know how many all time great players would KILL for a team that could top out at 55 wins without them? That is NOT common.</p>

      <label for="l9bn0lk" class="commentText"><p>People for years looked at the Bowie selection and said, &ldquo;Well, they had Clyde Drexler&rdquo; as if his 7.7 PPG rookie year somehow made drafting Jordan inconceivable. Drexler was a mid-1st who had a middling college career. So if you&rsquo;re making that argument, it never made any sense.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re handwaving that away, assuming they knew his potential, I mean&hellip;by 1987-88, they averaged a combined 62/12/12/6 steals.  Like you couldn&rsquo;t possibly play those two guys together.  It would&hellip;uh&hellip;not have enough&hellip;uh&hellip;</p>

<p>MVP-1, MVP-5. DPOY-1, DPOY-8. Yeah, you&rsquo;d hate to have that duo.</p>

<p>Obviously hindsight is <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub>, but it&rsquo;s not like the idea of having the SG and SF be similar sorts of players was some kind of completely absurd futuristic concept.</p>

<p>Though it is a bit silly because Magic and Bird had been dominating the league for several years by then. Not a super forward-thinking franchise at the time</p>

      <label for="l9cpayt" class="commentText"><p>We’re still looking at the first 4 seasons of Bird and Magic (and Dr J from ABA?) vs 3 decades of dominating centers though. It’s a major gamble at the time. </p>

<p>Cousy and Robertson were the only non-Center/PF to win MVP before 1980. </p>

<p>If there’s ever an argument for MJ as the GOAT; for those don’t consider him as the GOAT. This is it. He changed the game from inside/paint to perimeter/wing. </p>

<p>&ldquo;We wish he were seven feet, but he isn’t,&rdquo; said Bulls general manager Rod Thorn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There just wasn’t a center available,” said Thorn. “What can you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We picked him because you can’t pass up a great player. If we were a great team, we could have drafted for need. We need a center; we’re going to have to get one. There just wasn’t one there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>EDIT: just realized I messed up and the blazers were trading away their pick, so I guess the rockets <em>could</em> have done this. I guess everyone always giving the blazers a bad time for drafting Bowie over MJ should really be giving the rockets the hard time. They chose sampson over drexler and MJ.</p>

<p>But I think back then they were really going for size. Today small ball is popular, back then it&rsquo;s big-ball where size really mattered, which is funny to say because NO ONE since Wilt Chamberlain era has really seen what size really is until Shaq came around.</p>

<p>That was also in an era where there was an arms race at center.  Everyone still felt like you had to have an all star at center to compete for titles.  Pistons and Bulls kinda changed that notion in the late 80s/early 90s.</p>

      <label for="l9bz1q2" class="commentText"><p>The article doesn&rsquo;t go into why they weren&rsquo;t able to trade out.</p>

<p>In &lsquo;84, the first overall pick was still decided by a coin flip between the worst team in either conference.  That would have been the Pacers and Rockets, but because the Blazers had the Pacers pick, the coin flip was between Portland and Houston.</p>

<p>Both teams wanted Olajuwon, but only the Blazers were interested in Bowie at #2.  The Rockets were concerned with his injury history.  This meant that if the Rockets won the coin toss, the draft would go Olajuwon-Bowie-unknown #3, but if the Blazers won the toss, the draft would go Olajuwon-unknown #2-Bowie.</p>

<p>The Bulls made a deal with the Sonics to send the #3 overall pick in exchange for Jack Sikma.  The trade was contingent, however, on Bowie being available at #3, and thus on the Blazers winning the toss.  When Houston won the toss, Seattle could no longer get Bowie at #3, so the trade was never consummated.</p>

<p>Like he averaged 28ppg his rookie season on 51% shooting in the 80’s. How the hell did the first and second teams not know he was going to be worth it??</p>

<p>Edit: ok Hakeem was drafted first overall, I give the rockets a pass. If you’re drafting between a 21 year old Hakeem and MJ, I can’t fault you for taking Hakeem… But the blazers. Really??</p>
