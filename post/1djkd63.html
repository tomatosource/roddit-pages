<p>I think Melo needed a true PG to succeed, which is why his best season came with Billups running the offense.</p>

      <label for="l9bvec8" class="commentText"><p>Maybe, but I think he&rsquo;s trending towards underrated now. Not sure where all the recent hate has come from.</p>

<p>He was in a very tough conference. If you look at the teams he lost to in his prime as the guy: Prime Spurs, Prime Kobe/Gasol lakers (2x), Dwill/Boozer Jazz.</p>

<p>He went to the east just in time to lose to the Celtics big 3, the Heatles, and then lost to the PG pacers with Raymond Felton as his #2.</p>

<p>The only non-championship caliber team in that bunch are the Jazz but they were stacked. Prime D-will was a top 3 point guard, Boozer was a great compliment to him, AK47 was an absolute nightmare on defense and they had great depth.</p>

      <label for="l9cg6ar" class="commentText"><p>When in history does a star player not have to face adversity?</p>

<p>Duncan and the Spurs had to fight Kobe and Shaq, Dirk and the Mavs, Nash and the Suns, and vice versa for all of them, Lebron literally had to fight the big 3 of the Celtics before making his own, then beat those Pacers with PG13 and Roy Hibbert in his allstar days, and the Bulls with D Rose, Boozer, Noah and Deng, and it’s not like Melo was out there alone he had allstar Amare Stoudemire who was quite frankly doing more than him for a long stretch</p>

<p>You can make excuses for Melo all you want but he never got it done and even in losing played like shit, no one in recent NBA history could go 31-51 and then 32-50 back to back seasons in their prime and still be talked about like he&rsquo;s one of the best ever lmao</p>

<p>Melo was and is still overrated</p>

      <label for="l9bnwvm" class="commentText"><p>I disagree, i think Melo is exactly what those Bulls teams needed. They had bad perimeter scoring, they did not have a go to isolation player, and they could not spread the court well so defenses could collapse on Rose. Melo would&rsquo;ve fixed all those problems.</p>

<p>Those Bulls teams were elite on defense already with Joakim Noah holding down the paint and Jimmy butler guarding the best perimeter player.</p>

      <label for="l9bk5ep" class="commentText"><p>Boozer was getting paid 15mil a year (a lot back then) and often sat in the 4th because he was such a liability on defense. His style was largely obsolete by time his contract expired.</p>

<p>Deng was maybe slightly underrated but he was a fringe all star, off ball wing. A great #3 option but he just didn&rsquo;t have the offensive talent to be a reliable #2.</p>

<p>Jimmy Butler was a steal and if he was the player he became in Philly/Miami I think they had a chance in 2015. I mentioned in my other comment, they drafted well but they just consistently fell short in FA to get that win now talent.</p>

I don’t follow the Knick’s so maybe he’s better now, but all the playoff injuries just seems like the old Tom Thibodeau special to me. He absolutely ran guys like Deng and Butler into the ground during his tenure.</p>

      <label for="l9bnmzr" class="commentText"><p>If you watched Rose, it was a matter of time. He was one of the most explosive players of all time and landed as recklessly as a drunk pilot.</p>

<p>He definitely shouldn&rsquo;t have been playing in that exact moment but it&rsquo;s low hanging fruit to blame Thibs. Rose only played 35mpg the season he got hurt.</p>

<p>If anything you should blame the league for how they handled the shortened season. Teams were playing back to back to back and load management wasn&rsquo;t really a thing at that point.</p>

      <label for="l9caoeg" class="commentText"><p>No disrespect but I&rsquo;m getting a bit tired of Cavs fans being experts on the 2010s Bulls lol.</p>

<p>Deng nor Boozer were reliable #2 scorers, let alone from the perimeter. It doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re not good players.</p>

<p>If you actually watched the team, you&rsquo;d know why. Boozer was largely a product of his time and that Utah Jazz offensive scheme. His production noticeable dropped when he wasn&rsquo;t with DWill and he wasn&rsquo;t playing much in the 4th between his foul trouble and/or general lack of defense. Its hard to be a #2 when you aren&rsquo;t on the court in important moments. In their ECF run, he averaged a whopping 12.6ppg on 43%, which was a steep drop from his regular season performance. Also for a low usage big man, he was fairly turnover prone. Your only justification is that he was a 2x all star, 2 years before he joined the bulls?</p>

<p>Deng was a very important piece, but on a champ team would never be more than a #3 option on offense. His two way title was 60% defense / 40% offense. His offensive bag was slashing and catch and shoot (mostly corner) 3s which meant he struggled if the defense every keyed in on him. As the #2 option in 2011, he put up 16.9ppg. but struggled from 3 which allowed defenses to collapse on Rose easier.</p>

<p>So back to my original critique of needing a perimeter #2, neither of these guys fit that mold even remotely.</p>

<p>westbrook and Manu? if you need somebody of that caliber to propel you, i don’t think you can blame the secondary perimeter scorer</p>

<p>i just think if Boozer is dog shit bc he doesn’t have Williams, that says more about D Rose as a facilitator and if two 15-18ppg (when that meant something) isn’t enough, it’s your probably number 1 guy</p>

<p>maybe Boozer would be better inside if his point guard could shoot past the free throw line</p>

<p>This is by far the worst take I&rsquo;ve seen today. Most championships have a #2 of that caliber or better lmao. I&rsquo;m not gonna pretend Rose was the player that Steph or Dirk is either.</p>

<p>Even LeBron needs a certain team makeup for him to succeed and he&rsquo;s arguably the GOAT. He needs shooters around him&hellip;sound familiar? AD in 2020 was a better perimeter threat than Deng, on top of being a much better overall player.</p>

<p>Rose was in his 3rd year, so yeah he still had a ton of flaws. His lack of shooting definitely held him back and he relied on his athleticism too much which led to a lot recklessness. This doesn&rsquo;t let the FO off the hook for not surrounding him with talent that fits to his skillset as the #1 option.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t say Boozer was dogshit but he definitely was better in Utah. They had shooters at every position before it was cool, which opened up the pick and roll. Deron Williams was more of a pass first PG than Rose. And guess what, with him a #2 option there they still didn&rsquo;t make a finals.</p>

<p>If you wanna just discredit Rose, do you. But don&rsquo;t act like you know about a team you clearly didn&rsquo;t watch enough of.</p>

      <label for="l9brxe5" class="commentText"><p>He clearly had good scouting abilities, but you wonder how much of it works without Jordan? Scottie fit into the second banana role perfectly because of Jordan’s expectations. There’s another realm in which Scottie is just some athletic scorer who never wins a ring. Rodman actually played and focused with Jordan, unlike his out-of-control Spurs days. Phil deserves credit too, but even he owes a lot to Michael.</p>

      <label for="l9bhdvp" class="commentText"><p>Which really doesn’t mean… anything.</p>

<p>It takes a perfect scenario to play out with teams to win a title. You can land on KD, Russ, Harden and Ibaka and come away with one finals appearance. Had they made that run a different year, against a different team out East, who knows. Meanwhile the Warriors were able to walk away with 4 rings, and 3 of them came from in part the good fortune of playing against an injury decimated team in the finals for one, and an unprecedented cap spike aligning with the free agency of an all time great player for the other 2. Different circumstances could see that team win just one, or zero. Impossible to know because it never happened that way because they found a perfect window and capitalized.</p>

<p>Hell the bulls had D Rose and he got injured as well as run into a historically great team. Do I believe he wins a ring if he stays healthy? Personally no, but who knows. It depends on what the rest of the league does and all sorts of things playing out perfectly.</p>

<p>Jordan could have landed on a team with no vision to properly build around him. Rodman could have no wound up available the very year they needed to plug somebody into his position.</p>

<p>I could go on and on, but their success without him is literally completely irrelevant. It’s hard to win in the nba</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t common for the Bulls either. They were 34-31 in 1995 when Jordan came back, a 43 win pace. Pippen was at his absolute best around this time. Thinking basketball looked at the Bulls&rsquo; playoff +/- with and without Jordan: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGDLV-do9c&amp;t=2s" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGDLV-do9c&amp;t=2s</a> and although they were clearly good in a few seasons and improved substantially leading up to the first 3peat, they weren&rsquo;t an all-time supporting cast, and were negative for 4 of the championship runs. (This metric is very noisy&ndash;I wouldn&rsquo;t overinterpret it, but the numbers are indicative, especially when you combine multiple seasons).</p>

<p>I’m not exactly sure the point you are making.</p>

<p>I never argued that Jordan was carried, rather that the team successfully built around him which is the task. They were successful.</p>

<p>Jokic is a great player, the Nuggets were successful in putting pieces around him to win a title. They were successful.</p>

<p>The Cavs meanwhile were not successful in building around Lebron. They let boozer walk, they failed to bring a suitable replacement and made repeated efforts to fix things but they all flamed out, or the Cavs would be reluctant to give up a JJ hickson to make the move happen. There is a clear difference in the moves these franchises made once they got the guy. That’s the point.</p>

<p>Not really sure where the misinterpretation is coming in where people think I’ve implied the Bulls were good when he got there. They obviously wouldn’t be picking so high in the draft if they were good.</p>

<p>I was mainly responding to this point. Not intending to compare to other stars.</p>

<p>I agree that complementing your star player is important.</p>

      <label for="l9bxu37" class="commentText"><blockquote>
<p>Let’s not pretend they were the Cavs in Lebrons first stint</p>
</blockquote>

<p>you&rsquo;re right early MJ bulls were worse than first stint lebron cavs by a long shot. that cavs team are strangely hated on this sub, when it wasn&rsquo;t the case at the time, they had 2 60+ win seasons, coach of the year in 08, a finals appearance in 07, a great defensive team, in the 08 playoffs they had the best defensive rating rating in playoffs for example, and was 4th in league in 2007. lebron was surrounded by great rebounding, rim protection (which was highly favoured back then and the meta), and good shooters to compliment lebrons driving and passing.</p>

<p>They were finals contenders, and were favored to win it all in 09 but lost to magic who they were expected to beat and same thing the next year against the celtics.</p>

<p>This narrative that lebron had terrible teams in his first cavs stint tells me people didn&rsquo;t watch and just regurgitate the same &ldquo;he only had mo williams hurr durr&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reality is that at the time no big star wanted to play with lebron in  Cleveland which is why he left for miami. That team was 1 piece away from multiple championships if lebron had a co-star.</p>

      <label for="l9c3qv0" class="commentText"><p>Lebron DID have a co star that the Cavs let walk for nothing. I’m not comparing their collective talent level, rather their actual competence building a team around a star.</p>

<p>The Bulls did an incredible job surrounding Jordan with the pieces, the Cavs did not. The Bulls were able to maintain the flexibility to improve the team, didn’t burn through their assets, retained key players, so on and so forth. It wasn’t outright organizational failure top to bottom in the front office in the same manner</p>

      <label for="l9bn0lk" class="commentText"><p>People for years looked at the Bowie selection and said, &ldquo;Well, they had Clyde Drexler&rdquo; as if his 7.7 PPG rookie year somehow made drafting Jordan inconceivable. Drexler was a mid-1st who had a middling college career. So if you&rsquo;re making that argument, it never made any sense.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re handwaving that away, assuming they knew his potential, I mean&hellip;by 1987-88, they averaged a combined 62/12/12/6 steals.  Like you couldn&rsquo;t possibly play those two guys together.  It would&hellip;uh&hellip;not have enough&hellip;uh&hellip;</p>

<p>MVP-1, MVP-5. DPOY-1, DPOY-8. Yeah, you&rsquo;d hate to have that duo.</p>

<p>Obviously hindsight is <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub>, but it&rsquo;s not like the idea of having the SG and SF be similar sorts of players was some kind of completely absurd futuristic concept.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m <em>still</em> pissed the Rockets took Rodney McCray at 3 instead of Glide.</p>

<p>Not saying the Rockets would have won the Finals over possibly the greatest team of all time with Clyde on the team but we probably wouldn&rsquo;t have lost in 6 and definitely wouldn&rsquo;t have wasted so many years of Dream&rsquo;s prime.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There just wasn’t a center available,” said Thorn. “What can you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We picked him because you can’t pass up a great player. If we were a great team, we could have drafted for need. We need a center; we’re going to have to get one. There just wasn’t one there.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l9bz1q2" class="commentText"><p>The article doesn&rsquo;t go into why they weren&rsquo;t able to trade out.</p>

<p>In &lsquo;84, the first overall pick was still decided by a coin flip between the worst team in either conference.  That would have been the Pacers and Rockets, but because the Blazers had the Pacers pick, the coin flip was between Portland and Houston.</p>

<p>Both teams wanted Olajuwon, but only the Blazers were interested in Bowie at #2.  The Rockets were concerned with his injury history.  This meant that if the Rockets won the coin toss, the draft would go Olajuwon-Bowie-unknown #3, but if the Blazers won the toss, the draft would go Olajuwon-unknown #2-Bowie.</p>

<p>The Bulls made a deal with the Sonics to send the #3 overall pick in exchange for Jack Sikma.  The trade was contingent, however, on Bowie being available at #3, and thus on the Blazers winning the toss.  When Houston won the toss, Seattle could no longer get Bowie at #3, so the trade was never consummated.</p>

MJ broke the mold, he was the first ball dominant, scoring dominant guard to lead a championship team (technically West too but he played alongside Wilt)</p>

<p>I imagine that they tried to trade for Bowie, which meant Portland could&rsquo;ve landed MJ and paired him with Clyde 👀</p>

<p>In fairness, it&rsquo;s hard to guess that somebody is going to be a generational player who changes the game, and it&rsquo;s not like the Rockets didn&rsquo;t pick a 2-time NBA champion/FMVP/MVP/DPOY ahead of him.</p>

<p>And Curry was picked, what&hellip;. 7th? One MVP a head of him, two ROY (oddly enough, that draft provided more ROYs than almost any other draft) and NO NBA champions.</p>
