<p>I think Melo needed a true PG to succeed, which is why his best season came with Billups running the offense.</p>

      <label for="l9bvec8" class="commentText"><p>Maybe, but I think he&rsquo;s trending towards underrated now. Not sure where all the recent hate has come from.</p>

<p>He was in a very tough conference. If you look at the teams he lost to in his prime as the guy: Prime Spurs, Prime Kobe/Gasol lakers (2x), Dwill/Boozer Jazz.</p>

<p>He went to the east just in time to lose to the Celtics big 3, the Heatles, and then lost to the PG pacers with Raymond Felton as his #2.</p>

<p>The only non-championship caliber team in that bunch are the Jazz but they were stacked. Prime D-will was a top 3 point guard, Boozer was a great compliment to him, AK47 was an absolute nightmare on defense and they had great depth.</p>

      <label for="l9bnwvm" class="commentText"><p>I disagree, i think Melo is exactly what those Bulls teams needed. They had bad perimeter scoring, they did not have a go to isolation player, and they could not spread the court well so defenses could collapse on Rose. Melo would&rsquo;ve fixed all those problems.</p>

<p>Those Bulls teams were elite on defense already with Joakim Noah holding down the paint and Jimmy butler guarding the best perimeter player.</p>

      <label for="l9bk5ep" class="commentText"><p>Boozer was getting paid 15mil a year (a lot back then) and often sat in the 4th because he was such a liability on defense. His style was largely obsolete by time his contract expired.</p>

<p>Deng was maybe slightly underrated but he was a fringe all star, off ball wing. A great #3 option but he just didn&rsquo;t have the offensive talent to be a reliable #2.</p>

<p>Jimmy Butler was a steal and if he was the player he became in Philly/Miami I think they had a chance in 2015. I mentioned in my other comment, they drafted well but they just consistently fell short in FA to get that win now talent.</p>

I don’t follow the Knick’s so maybe he’s better now, but all the playoff injuries just seems like the old Tom Thibodeau special to me.

<p>He definitely shouldn&rsquo;t have been playing in that exact moment but it&rsquo;s low hanging fruit to blame Thibs. Rose only played 35mpg the season he got hurt.</p>

<p>If anything you should blame the league for how they handled the shortened season. Teams were playing back to back to back and load management wasn&rsquo;t really a thing at that point.</p>

      <label for="l9bgokx" class="commentText"><p>Nah I refuse that . Boozer n ither coukd svore a bit and while that Chicago team didn’t have a secondary high lvl scorer they didn’t need one they were a defensive first team and there amazing defence was why they got the n1 seed. Getting rose more offensive talent at cost of defence woukd reduce rose value and that team already played well when he sat anyway ( compare Miami Lebron off vs Chicago rose off).</p>

<p>I think those bulls teams were pretty well built , that and Thibs cosching . They got rolled in 2011 conference finals because Lebron ( and Wade ) started hitting everything and Lebron defensively was a monster n huge issue for Chicago. But they were a 62 win team . And n1 seed over Miami . And those games were close.</p>

<p>One thing I hate is that cos if Dallas finals people ignore yhe ECF being great with close games and Lebron coming through , and Wade tho he obv had a good finaks too .</p>

<p>If I have a Luka , an AI or harden I’m surrounding those guys with defensive players first. People ignore this but Dirk n nash didn’t fit together that well . They were better apart but people meme Dallas letting him go. I think the bulls had enough offensive talent too tbh. And guys that grew had rose stayed healthy</p>

      <label for="l9biz8u" class="commentText"><p>You can refuse it all you want but the results are there for you. I hated the 1 seed discourse then, I hate it now. The goal isn&rsquo;t to get a 1 seed, it&rsquo;s to win a championship. Everything you listed is why they were a great regular season team, but couldn&rsquo;t get over the hump in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Jordan needed a Pippen, Lebron needed a Kyrie/AD/Wade/Bosh, Jokic needed a Murray, Kobe needed a Shaq/Gasol. There&rsquo;s only really one example of a #1 player not having a clear #2 in the past 20 years and that&rsquo;s Dirk.</p>

<p>To say they didn&rsquo;t need a second scorer means you did not watch that Chi/Mia ECF. They focused their entire defensive energy on Rose after game 1 and held him to well under 40% shooting on the way to a gentlemen&rsquo;s sweep.</p>

<p>I do think Pax era drafted pretty well. They weren&rsquo;t entirely incompetent, but they just couldn&rsquo;t make much noise in FA in an era where FA was most important.</p>

      <label for="l9bcbf0" class="commentText"><p>Let’s not pretend they were the Cavs in Lebrons first stint. They made mistakes but they also surrounded Jordan with the talent needed to succeed.</p>

<p>Everybody idolizes Jordan and makes it seem like a no brainer that regardless of where he went he would win, but in reality there are plenty of ways a team could have fucked it up. The bulls aren’t simply lucky to land him. They executed to perfection the team building around him.</p>

<p>They are both lucky to have landed on each other when they did.</p>

Hired Phil and essentially saved his career, personally scouted Scottie and recognized his ability before a lot of other GMs and got Horace in the same draft, retooled the Bulls during MJ&rsquo;s retirement, got Rodman for scraps. He got a lot of shit for saying orgs win chips but he did almost everything right those years, and so I can&rsquo;t say he was wrong.</p>

Scottie fit into the second banana role perfectly because of Jordan’s expectations. There’s another realm in which Scottie is just some athletic scorer who never wins a ring. Rodman actually played and focused with Jordan, unlike his out-of-control Spurs days. Phil deserves credit too, but even he owes a lot to Michael.</p>

      <label for="l9bhdvp" class="commentText"><p>Which really doesn’t mean… anything.</p>

<p>It takes a perfect scenario to play out with teams to win a title. You can land on KD, Russ, Harden and Ibaka and come away with one finals appearance. Had they made that run a different year, against a different team out East, who knows. Meanwhile the Warriors were able to walk away with 4 rings, and 3 of them came from in part the good fortune of playing against an injury decimated team in the finals for one, and an unprecedented cap spike aligning with the free agency of an all time great player for the other 2. Different circumstances could see that team win just one, or zero. Impossible to know because it never happened that way because they found a perfect window and capitalized.</p>

<p>Hell the bulls had D Rose and he got injured as well as run into a historically great team. Do I believe he wins a ring if he stays healthy? Personally no, but who knows. It depends on what the rest of the league does and all sorts of things playing out perfectly.</p>

<p>Jordan could have landed on a team with no vision to properly build around him. Rodman could have no wound up available the very year they needed to plug somebody into his position.</p>

<p>I could go on and on, but their success without him is literally completely irrelevant. It’s hard to win in the nba</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re saying the Bulls are bad without Jordan then literally every franchise is bad except for the Celtics and Lakers</p>

<p>The Heat are bad without Riley/Wade</p>

<p>The Spurs are bad without Pop/Duncan</p>

<p>The Warriors are bad without Kerr/Curry</p>

<p>Every other team if you take away rings won by their best player/dynatsy has like 1-2 rings max. Celtics and Lakers alone have had multiple periods of consistent success. It&rsquo;s a silly metric&hellip;</p>

There are teams that have been much worse . Add in you’d always expect 5years or so post mj dynasty for rebuilding . Plenty of teams never been contenders like 11 bulls n 62 wins over Miami heatles . Also during mj time they made a lot of really great moves n great building of the team with forward thinking</p>

<p>When Pippen and Horace joined, Horace was seen as the better of the two and even then their averages were not good. They were serviceable at best.</p>

<p>What many people fail to realize is that because Michael Jordan had set a standard for himself and his team, everyone else had to be on board with that level of maniacal practice and work ethic, or you just weren’t gonna cut it. He deserves every bit of credit.</p>

<p>Rodman is Rodman. No one is controlling that man fully.</p>

<p>Pippen and Horace Grant were not at the level required to win immediately. It took time. Michael learned he couldn’t do it all himself but that doesn’t mean Pippen came in guns blazing. Do you even know any of the history of this team?</p>

<p>Their first playoff series together in 1988, Jordan averaged 45 ppg and Pippen and Grant combined for 19.2 ppg.</p>

<p>Michael Jordan is literally the reason everyone else on that team got off the ground.</p>

<p>You were definitely not alive if you don’t understand this.</p>

<p>So many of you nephews somehow think Michael Jordan walked into a 6 ring team.</p>

<p>He MADE the 6 ring team.</p>

<p>This is the definition of a straw man.</p>

<p>You’re talking about years Jordan wasn’t making it out of the first round, which cool I guess? But that has nothing to do with the GM building a successful team around him in the same exact window that other teams have successfully built around their star players.</p>

<p>Young players get better dude. The implication that ANYBODY would have rose to the level of Pippen because Jordan would will it in existence isn’t just glazing but it’s also fucking dumb bro.</p>

<p>E: this guy is inventing his own argument so I’m not sure how I’m the one getting downvoted. The difference between the Bulls and the Cavs isn’t that one team was ready to go day one, I didn’t say that. Their process in building around the player is the difference between the two.</p>

<p>He sure had a lot to do with it. That’s the point.</p>

<p>And while Jordan had Pippen and Grant on his team he STILL had to do things like average 45 ppg early on because they were not good enough, yet.</p>

<p>We know that isn’t true. We saw Jordan not win early. We saw him lose after retirement because his team didn’t have enough despite HIS NUMBERS being as good or better than every other playoff run.</p>

      <label for="l9bw2sw" class="commentText"><p>When he was on the Spurs he actively refused to guard Hakeem in a critical series and didn’t play defense often. He just focused on his own rebounding. He walked off the court mid-game at one point and just refused to play.</p>

<p>With the Bulls he never missed a critical game, took on many really difficult defensive assignments and played incredibly hard (notably guarding Karl Malone and giving him tons of issues).</p>

<p>He was always getting fined and suspended for acting out and doing/saying dumb shit, but the difference was in his commitment to the team actually on the court.</p>

They got a great supporting cast and coach around him after several years but Jordan elevated them into a title team. Without him they peak as a 55-win team that can’t make the finals.</p>

<p>This is such a bizarre take on what I just said. I didn’t say Jordan wasn’t involved with winning titles. They built teams around him because they had him… that’s… what you’re supposed to do?</p>

<p>And do you know how many all time great players would KILL for a team that could top out at 55 wins without them? That is NOT common.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t common for the Bulls either. They were 34-31 in 1995 when Jordan came back, a 43 win pace. Pippen was at his absolute best around this time. Thinking basketball looked at the Bulls&rsquo; playoff +/- with and without Jordan: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGDLV-do9c&amp;t=2s" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqGDLV-do9c&amp;t=2s</a> and although they were clearly good in a few seasons and improved substantially leading up to the first 3peat, they weren&rsquo;t an all-time supporting cast, and were negative for 4 of the championship runs. (This metric is very noisy&ndash;I wouldn&rsquo;t overinterpret it, but the numbers are indicative, especially when you combine multiple seasons).</p>

      <label for="l9c4ksx" class="commentText"><p>Right.</p>

<p>I’m not exactly sure the point you are making.</p>

<p>I never argued that Jordan was carried, rather that the team successfully built around him which is the task. They were successful.</p>

<p>Jokic is a great player, the Nuggets were successful in putting pieces around him to win a title. They were successful.</p>

<p>The Cavs meanwhile were not successful in building around Lebron. They let boozer walk, they failed to bring a suitable replacement and made repeated efforts to fix things but they all flamed out, or the Cavs would be reluctant to give up a JJ hickson to make the move happen. There is a clear difference in the moves these franchises made once they got the guy. That’s the point.</p>

<p>Not really sure where the misinterpretation is coming in where people think I’ve implied the Bulls were good when he got there. They obviously wouldn’t be picking so high in the draft if they were good.</p>

<p>Let’s not pretend they were the Cavs in Lebrons first stint</p>
</blockquote>

<p>you&rsquo;re right early MJ bulls were worse than first stint lebron cavs by a long shot. that cavs team are strangely hated on this sub, when it wasn&rsquo;t the case at the time, they had 2 60+ win seasons, coach of the year in 08, a finals appearance in 07, a great defensive team, in the 08 playoffs they had the best defensive rating rating in playoffs for example, and was 4th in league in 2007. lebron was surrounded by great rebounding, rim protection (which was highly favoured back then and the meta), and good shooters to compliment lebrons driving and passing.</p>

<p>They were finals contenders, and were favored to win it all in 09 but lost to magic who they were expected to beat and same thing the next year against the celtics.</p>

<p>This narrative that lebron had terrible teams in his first cavs stint tells me people didn&rsquo;t watch and just regurgitate the same &ldquo;he only had mo williams hurr durr&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reality is that at the time no big star wanted to play with lebron in  Cleveland which is why he left for miami. That team was 1 piece away from multiple championships if lebron had a co-star.</p>

<p>The Bulls did an incredible job surrounding Jordan with the pieces, the Cavs did not. The Bulls were able to maintain the flexibility to improve the team, didn’t burn through their assets, retained key players, so on and so forth. It wasn’t outright organizational failure top to bottom in the front office in the same manner</p>

He had trouble with the rockets franchise and with teammates. He became much more mellow after converting to islam. Who knows if he would have gotten along with Jordan.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a story about him slapping vernon maxwell and police coming into the locker room with guns drawn.</p>

      <label for="l9bn0lk" class="commentText"><p>People for years looked at the Bowie selection and said, &ldquo;Well, they had Clyde Drexler&rdquo; as if his 7.7 PPG rookie year somehow made drafting Jordan inconceivable. Drexler was a mid-1st who had a middling college career. So if you&rsquo;re making that argument, it never made any sense.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re handwaving that away, assuming they knew his potential, I mean&hellip;by 1987-88, they averaged a combined 62/12/12/6 steals.  Like you couldn&rsquo;t possibly play those two guys together.  It would&hellip;uh&hellip;not have enough&hellip;uh&hellip;</p>

<p>MVP-1, MVP-5. DPOY-1, DPOY-8. Yeah, you&rsquo;d hate to have that duo.</p>

<p>Obviously hindsight is <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub>, but it&rsquo;s not like the idea of having the SG and SF be similar sorts of players was some kind of completely absurd futuristic concept.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We picked him because you can’t pass up a great player. If we were a great team, we could have drafted for need. We need a center; we’re going to have to get one. There just wasn’t one there.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l9bz1q2" class="commentText"><p>The article doesn&rsquo;t go into why they weren&rsquo;t able to trade out.</p>

<p>In &lsquo;84, the first overall pick was still decided by a coin flip between the worst team in either conference.  That would have been the Pacers and Rockets, but because the Blazers had the Pacers pick, the coin flip was between Portland and Houston.</p>

<p>Both teams wanted Olajuwon, but only the Blazers were interested in Bowie at #2.  The Rockets were concerned with his injury history.  This meant that if the Rockets won the coin toss, the draft would go Olajuwon-Bowie-unknown #3, but if the Blazers won the toss, the draft would go Olajuwon-unknown #2-Bowie.</p>

<p>The Bulls made a deal with the Sonics to send the #3 overall pick in exchange for Jack Sikma.  The trade was contingent, however, on Bowie being available at #3, and thus on the Blazers winning the toss.  When Houston won the toss, Seattle could no longer get Bowie at #3, so the trade was never consummated.</p>
