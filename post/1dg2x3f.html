</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <blockquote>
<p>STORRS, Conn. — A night before finalizing the most significant choice of his career, Dan Hurley, who was weighing a massive contract extension from Connecticut against the &ldquo;once-in-a-lifetime&rdquo; opportunity to lead the Los Angeles Lakers, engaged in a 21st-century thought experiment with his wife. He and Andrea Hurley, to whom he&rsquo;s been married for more than two decades, agreed to text each other simultaneously, on the count of three, with either the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; or the word &ldquo;stay&rdquo; in reference to the quandary their family faced. </p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>One, two, three, send it</em>,&rdquo; Hurley recalled during a media session on Thursday afternoon, his first since being catapulted into the news cycle last week. &ldquo;And we both got it. And it was both ‘stay.&rsquo; I said, ‘Let&rsquo;s do the same thing in the morning.&lsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their answers matched again the following morning, and then a third time later that afternoon when Hurley cast a furtive glance in Andrea&rsquo;s direction before leaving their home in Glastonbury, Connecticut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just kind of looked at each other like, ‘Do you feel good about this?&rsquo; Hurley said. Because by then, the only thing separating Hurley from a scheduled and rescheduled meeting with his players, his assistants and his support staff — all of whom were still in the dark about what he planned to do — was a 25-mile drive to campus.</p>

<p>Hurley called UConn&rsquo;s athletic director, David Benedict, and informed him of the decision to stay and chase a third consecutive national championship. Hurley&rsquo;s agent, Bret Just, explained to the Lakers that his client was declining the six-year, $70 million contract they&rsquo;d offered. From there, word of Hurley&rsquo;s choice rattled across social media platforms and reverberated off the walls of the Werth Family Champions Center in Storrs. As he entered the Huskies&rsquo; locker room, where nobody had a cell phone, the only people who didn&rsquo;t know what Hurley had decided were his players. </p>

<p>&ldquo;I used it to my advantage as a coach in terms of asking them for a heavy commitment,&rdquo; Hurley said. &ldquo;I had made my decision before I went in there, but I kinda demanded a commitment of excellence from them in there, and they didn&rsquo;t really know what I was doing when I went in. So it was almost like, ‘Whatever you guys say and commit to is going to be the deciding factor,&rsquo; which was a lie. I already had <strong>decided.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I like coaching guys this age. They&rsquo;re dumber than NBA players. I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to pull that stuff off [in the pros]. But I got a great commitment from the group and I told them.&rdquo;</strong></p>

      <label for="l8ncngy" class="commentText"><p>Bruh, how is this news still ongoing? His wife is crazy and clearly has a strong opinion on moving. Also, I have no idea why he’d call his players dumb. There are many different ways to convey that point across. Most likely meant to use the word “malleable” or something close to it</p>
