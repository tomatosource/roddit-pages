There’s a much more probable chance he has strayed from the path once, twice or a thousand times. Good chance he’s got an agreement with the missus honestly. It’s hilarious seeing ppl in here earnestly saying there’s no way a billionaire could get away with cheating tho. That is rich lol.</p>

<li>The situation at the time that people were upset about with China was the Hong Kong democracy protest, not the genocide of Uygurs. You are conflating two different situations. If you want to get technical there are 2 issues with Lebron and China.</li>
</ol>

<p>The criticism surround Lebron was about his publicly distancing and separating Morey from everyone else in the NBA.  The reason Lebron go the brunt of the blame is primary because of his advocacy for voting and democracy at the same time. Lebron has been very vocal about his views on the democratic process and voting rights. No sport besides the NBA, nor no athlete in the US had tied themselves to the voting rights and &ldquo;get out to vote&rdquo; efforts extolling the powers in democratic values.</p>

<ol>
<li>Lebron said that Morey was &ldquo;misinformed about the situation&rdquo;, when <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hong-kong-freedoms-democracy-protests-china-crackdown" target="_blank">since 2019, China has taken even more freedoms and liberties away from the population in Hong Kong. </a></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>Beijing took its most assertive action yet on June 30, 2020, when it bypassed the Hong Kong legislature and imposed a <a href="https://www.gld.gov.hk/egazette/pdf/20202448e/egn2020244872.pdf" target="_blank">national security law</a>. The legislation effectively criminalizes any dissent and adopts extremely broad definitions for crimes such as terrorism, subversion, secession, and collusion with foreign powers. It also allows Beijing to establish a security force in Hong Kong and influence the selection of judges who hear national security cases.</p>

<p>In March 2024, Hong Kong lawmakers unanimously passed another sweeping security law aimed at plugging supposed loopholes in the 2020 law. Known as <a href="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gld.gov.hk%2Fegazette%2Fpdf%2F20242811e%2Fes3202428112.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7CCFong%40cfr.org%7Cf68a591b1ac847a2a62e08dc482c68d8%7C146cc3db32f24b3c815625bcc3553464%7C0%7C0%7C638464602784771172%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=003cwSuxYA5B3bWPJ8MEXV1A0qBdbD8uszMrFcJ6UDw%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">Article 23</a> [PDF], the bill was first proposed in 2002 but was met with a series of protests and failed to garner sufficient support.</p>

<p>The current legislation broadens the scope and definition of political crimes, targets “external interference” and theft of state secrets, and prohibits foreign political organizations or bodies from conducting political activities in Hong Kong, among other provisions. Analyst say the new law could have even further <a href="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2024%2F03%2F19%2Fworld%2Fasia%2Fhong-kong-security-law-article-23.html&amp;data=05%7C02%7CCFong%40cfr.org%7Cf68a591b1ac847a2a62e08dc482c68d8%7C146cc3db32f24b3c815625bcc3553464%7C0%7C0%7C638464602784785172%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=aEV3G1xZOXqz9Mikviij25kTkdj9y1gLS3AuPPgjJa8%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">chilling effects</a> on a wide range of international businesses and professionals, including civil servants, diplomats, journalists, and academics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many of the fears of that people in the US have about Project 2025 (specifically the broad laws that are up to the government to see who gets persecuted, and the overhaul of the judicial system), have already been rolled out in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Even if you assume that Lebron was imply that Morey shouldn&rsquo;t say anything while players are in China, that would only prove Morey and the protesters point more. If the government of China is going to kidnap NBA players because of a single tweet, doesn&rsquo;t that kinda prove that China is an authoritative regime, that shouldn&rsquo;t be tolerated?</p>

<p>Lebron got the blame and the criticism he did because he was doing thing like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFxMzDW5k3I" target="_blank">this video</a>. Lebron gets asked about the situation in China because he inserted himself into this leader persona. The same way Tim Cook does, The same way Mike Bloomberg does. You dont get to talk about yourself as a leader and advocacy of the democratic process, and then shirk away from the responsibility when an democratic protest sparks international outcry, and you are in the region that the situation is occurring in.</p>

      <label for="lfd0369" class="commentText"><p>Woah woah woah, first of all, I’m not conflating the two. I’m saying that the Uyghurs have nothing to do with the stance Lebron took, which is regularly mixed into one thing when discussing Lebron and his comments.</p>

<p>Secondly, I think you would find that Hong Kong overwhelmingly preferred to stay in the system that already existed, they just wanted it to not be overstepped. The idea of completely departing the traditional system they operate under was a very niche view.</p>

<p>Third, and let’s be completely real about this, the reason for the criticism is because he is Lebron James, and people can just state he supports genocide and others know so little about the situation they will take those false statements at face value. You’re welcome to have a complex view on the situation, but let’s just be real, that is not why people still bandy that shit about.</p>

<p>Tweeting support about a country separating off of their government is a scorching hot take that WAS wildly offensive to a huge portion of the population in both mainland China and Hong Kong. As far as what they may do regarding Morey’s tweet, I think when a person in their own home talks about the fears they had, it’s more than fair to suggest the person physically there may have had his own fears.</p>

<p>Basically, fat fucking chance anybody in this thread handles it much different when you’re suddenly thrust into a complicated geo political situation because a co worker sent out a tweet while at home in the US. It was peak slacktivism and he himself wasn’t willing to keep it up and stand behind it once he felt pressure regarding it. Why should Lebron have to stand on what Morey said but not Morey?</p>

      <label for="lfd901r" class="commentText"><p>Your hearts in the right place but you&rsquo;re twisting the lebron statement to the extreme in order to make it make sense. Lebron saying morey was &lsquo;misinformed about the situation&rsquo; is pretty open ended and people run with it to mean a nuanced geopolitical opinion about Hong Kong from Lebron where in reality all signs point to it just being about assuming morey didn&rsquo;t know how fucked up it was to be in the nba players positions and tweet something off like that at that time.  We know this to not be true with moreys history with yao at the time so it&rsquo;s just lebron calling morey a dumbfuck in the most p.c. way possible at the time.  Nothing to do with china/Hong Kong relations.  It&rsquo;s always just been about lebron and morey and the nba players/teams stuck in China.  It just depends on what you assume his comments were referring to.  I&rsquo;ll never understand why some people assume lebron has a passion about china&rsquo;s geopolitical positions over nba brotherhood. It just doesn&rsquo;t make any sense for that to be what he&rsquo;s referring to.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the implication. The idea is that LeBron knows pissing off China means the NBA gets less total money. And since LeBron is a super star with endorsements and an open desire to own a team one day, he stands to earn a large slice of the profit pie.</p>

      <label for="lfdgxfc" class="commentText"><p>But on the flip side, why would you jeopardize millions of dollars for the entire league, as well as upset the community around you, because a dude who is kind of a co worker decided to fire off a tweet without much thought to it?</p>

<p>It’s about more than money, but even just from that perspective, if you have a coworker suddenly put you and the rest of your coworkers into a spot where you lose a huge portion of your companies income, because of a tweet that they won’t even stand by, you’re really going to rock that boat?</p>

<p>Morey wasn’t willing to leave it up and take the heat when it effected him personally and he made the choice to tweet it. Why do we expect people who didn’t have choice in the matter to insert themselves into a massive geopolitical issue that doesn’t directly relate to them when their words carry serious implications for everybody else around them?</p>

<p>What in the hell did Lebron do to make my dad hate him so bad? My dad likes Kobe and Jordan. I assume something on Fox News melted his brain but he has a serious disdain for Lebron and it pisses me off.</p>

<p>Maybe this question is inappropriate for this sub and apologize to the Mods. But I’m seriously curious what the hell happened and why he feels this way. I asked him and he can’t even give me a good answer.</p>

      <label for="lfd4fe0" class="commentText"><p>I want to throw it out there that a lot of people who love both MJ and Kobe also love Melo and iso ball. Tons of my old friends as well as their fathers growing up loved iso scores and bad basketball and would in turn rank who was &ldquo;better&rdquo; based on pure scoring and &ldquo;mentality&rdquo;. </p>

<p>LeBron always making the best basketball decision early on instead of hero ball rubbed a lot of old heads the wrong way. As LeBron&rsquo;s accomplishments grew and folks started to rank him ahead of Kobe that in turn also grew the resentment from people that thought he played basketball the &ldquo;wrong way&rdquo;  because of said ISO ball love.  I did grow up in LA so the folks I interacted did certainly have a bias but still that&rsquo;s my take on it. </p>

      <label for="lfdc9w1" class="commentText"><p>I think lebron was an exact antithesis for a lot of players from that era: it was more toxic masculinity, more hating the shit out of your opponent, more physical basketball. Then here comes lebron being a friendly guy, not a lot of real world controversies, being friends with half the league. He was never concerned with taking the last shot and had the mentality that he’d look for the best basketball play where MJ &amp; Kobe would take the last shot no matter who guarded them in whatever position (iso). A lot of fans didn’t like it lol and still hate lebron for it. I’m sure lebrons political views is alright but doubt a lot of nba fans give af about politics like nfl fans do. The league as a whole is more social justice oriented so if you hate democratic politics, nba probably isn’t the league for you lol</p>

      <label for="lfd7anh" class="commentText"><p>I have a theory on this. Lebron is a more outspoken liberal, sure, but he’s never really said anything radical or inflammatory enough to garner the hate he gets from Fox News types. My theory is that “Michael Jordan” has been elevated in American culture from an (exceptional) athlete to a mythological figure of sorts. He’s become more of an idea than a man, a symbol of American dominance. Jordan’s status as the GOAT is widely accepted by people who never even watched him play. It’s become part of the cultural narrative. And like many other American cultural narratives/myths, people tend to get pissed off whenever they are challenged. Try telling the Fox News types that the founding fathers were not patriots fighting for freedom and liberty, but rather wealthy slave owners who simply wanted to cut out the crown and hoard the colonies’ resources for themselves. Try telling them that the American military isn’t nobly fighting to protect our freedom overseas, but is rather the most powerful force of imperialistic gangsters in history terrorizing other weaker nations at will for the sole purpose of getting the rich richer. Try telling them…..that Michael Jordan isn’t the GOAT. You will get similar red faced responses to all these. Other factors to consider:</p>

<p>-MJ being mostly an unthinking, unfeeling, unpolitical basketball robot gives them a blank slate to project onto. In fact, his one dominant personality trait (a spiteful asshole) is something these guys can identify with.</p>

<p>-Michael’s more selfish style of play that led him to scoring way more points than anyone else on his teams can be used to suggest that he solo carried the Bulls to their dominance, and that he would have done the same for any team he played for. This lines up perfectly with the American individualistic culture and mindset, which frequently likes to ascribe success to a single individual while minimizing the many important contributions from others, of whom success could not have been possible without.</p>

<p>Mix all that in with the turn-of-the-century transition to 24 hour news cycle, which drove everything including sports news into sensationalist hot take factories that COOKED people’s brains and led to Skip Bayless almost single handedly derailing the cultural consensus on Lebron once he began challenging the idea of Michael Jordan as the GOAT, and here we are.</p>

But there plenty of people of color, players even, who have said more critical things of the US and Trump that don’t draw the ire that Lebron does.

<p>Jordan has just hit another buzzer-beater to sink the Cavaliers, but another game is afoot. A spectacularly gifted 6&rsquo;7&rdquo;, 225-pound guard who averages 29.6 points, 8.3 rebounds and 5.9 assists for St. Vincent-St. Mary High in Akron, LeBron is thought to possess all the elements necessary to do for some apparel company what Jordan did for Nike. Not only does he have the requisite high-flying game and an Iversonian street cred that Jordan himself lacked, but he can also turn on the charm when necessary. It&rsquo;s why LeBron is a year from signing what&rsquo;s expected to be the most lucrative shoe deal in history for an NBA rookie, estimated at $20 million over five years, and why Jordan, who represents his own division of Nike athletic wear, would want LeBron in the Swoosh</p>

      <label for="lfcped9" class="commentText"><p>There have been a ton of very hyped athletes (Freddy Adu, Bryce Harper, Stephen Strasburg, Michelle Wie, etc.) but NO ONE has in the history of American sports has ever had more hype than LeBron James. The combination of talent + time period (just enough internet/media to spread his name/news everywhere but also not enough accessible content for people to easily avoid his story). I don’t really care much about LeBron but it’s truly amazing that he’s lived up to it all.</p>

      <label for="lfc9f3k" class="commentText"><p>My cousin came to do his residency after doing all of his schooling in Asia.  He visited elite schools across the country but did so on greyhound.  He would frequently share how the experience was at - say - Duke while telling us the stuff that really had him interested is “WHO IS THIS KING GUY EVERYONE’s TALKING ABOUT ON THE BUS?!?!”  “IS HE BETTER THAN JORDAN?”</p>

<p>Lebron was hardly 17 and had grown ass strangers across the country raving about him in this kind of way.  Way before socials, way before everything on video, way before you could get famous overnight.</p>

<p>To navigate that should be his legacy as a person.</p>

      <label for="lfctr3y" class="commentText"><p>Yea I really think it&rsquo;s impossible for anybody to be as big as him ever again. Like it&rsquo;s kinda hard to comprehend without the internet as prevalent as it is now, Lebron was genuinely a household name as a junior in high school. St. Vincent-St. Mary was traveling the country and selling out arenas. I remember not being able to get tickets when they came to the Palestra in the Philly to play Strawberry Mansion. And talking about it in school to friends as a 10 year old.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s where I fell in love with Amare Stoudemire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHLrRP9ukUc" target="_blank">My god for a big man</a> (Also spot all the futures in that video)</p>

<p>Then on Phoenix he literally was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3XUz6L9JLA" target="_blank">an early Blake Griffin</a> just putting everyone on a poster. Hell, he had some craziness on the Knicks too. If the Knicks had their current lineup + that Amare, the league would be in trouble.</p>

<p>No stories of him being particularly nice or mean or anything just basically said he was pretty much a normal kid. Other than the fact that he pretty much lived and breathed basketball lol.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s other stories that float around here too, I&rsquo;ve heard from wait staff that say he gave them like a 500 dollar tip, I&rsquo;ve also heard (exclusively from older men who dislike him) that he never tipped and was rude. So I doubt that one but who knows no one is perfect.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s crazy how much hate this dude gets for really no reason lol.</p>

<p>Oh and several years ago he paid to have the basketball courts at Patterson Park fixed up really nice and that was cool since I grew up playing ball there.</p>

<p>A sort of unrelated but fun fact is that when I was in 8th grade, I played CYO basketball for IHM (a Catholic school in Cuyahoga Falls) and we played St. Vincent/St. Mary&rsquo;s 6th and 7th grade team and they beat us 88 to 20 lol.</p>

Like the amount of respect I gained for him was endless at that point. We got to enjoy him while he still puts up incredible numbers .</p>

<p>No chance he doesn&rsquo;t go pro in some sport.</p>

<p>Mugsy Bogues is a fairy tale.</p>
