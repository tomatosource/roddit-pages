      <label for="l92j4uj" class="commentText"><p>Their strategy wasn&rsquo;t really built around stopping Curry at all though, they were trying to shut down everyone else other than game 5 they shut Curry down but still lost lol. Wiggins and GPII had a legacy game and Klay and Poole were really good. But they made a point to not overreact to Curry&rsquo;s offball movements and weren&rsquo;t really sending doubles for most of the series.</p>

<p>It kinda worked in the sense that they held them to a 110 offensive rating, which was significantly lower than any other series for them. The Warriors had a 123 ORTG vs Denver and 124 vs Dallas for comparison.</p>

<p>The Boston offense just cratered.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t think either performance was particularly good due to the turnovers and 4th quarter collapses though.</p>

<p>My overall point was that Boston team shuts down big men superstars. Even Bam went as far as saying that no one dominated them like Jokic, and that Jokic was definitely the hardest individual matchup.</p>

<p>You can say the Celtics are the best defense that year, but that doesnt tell the whole story here now does it.</p>

<p>That said Curries finals performance is more memorable. Jokices whole playoff run as a whole is superior to Curries, but the finals for the Nuggets was a slightly boring venture.</p>

<p>By all right the Celtics were the better squad that lost to the Warriors. The Nuggets on the othwr hand were the better team in that finals and it more felt like finishing the job.</p>

<p>So honestly you can have any opinion and it wouldnt be wrong here.</p>

      <label for="l92jx8m" class="commentText"><p>Jokic&rsquo;s performance was &ldquo;better&rdquo; Steph&rsquo;s performance was more impactful. If Jokic had a B/B- level finals, Denver probably wins in 6 games instead of 5. If Steph had a B/B- level finals, Boston almost certainly wins that series.</p>

      <label for="l92hm3s" class="commentText"><p>There is a very strong case that Curry had the best finals performance in recent years perhaps only behind Giannis.</p>

<p>But, Jokic definitely had the best playoff run among any player I remember since Lebron he averaged 30/14/10 on 55/46/80. He also went up against AD, Gobert, Ayton, and Bam. That&rsquo;s some of the best big men defenders in the NBA.</p>

<p>IMO 2022 Celtics were a better team than the warriors despite Warriors having a better record. Steph is the reason they won the series.</p>

<p>Even though Jokic had better stats the context matters</p>
