      <p>Let’s play some what-if’s.</p>

<p>I’m not talking about Ben Simmons finding a shot because he never found one. I’m talking about cases like Brook Lopez becoming one of the better three point shooters. Essentially taking an improvement that comes from the latter part of a player’s career and attaching to their skillsets earlier on.</p>

      <label for="liejto7" class="commentText"><p>That is so many careers omg</p>

<p>Stephen curry took 27% of his shots from 16feet-the 3 pt like through the first 5 years of his career. you can see the year Kerr takes over cuz that percent cuts to 16 in year 1 and 9 in the 73-9 year</p>

<p>It’s like Mark Jackson Curry 46.5% of his shots were from 3feet-3pt line. First 2 years of Kerr he cuts that number to 27.2% essentially meaning 19% of his shots started being 45% more efficient. Essentially you can say his TS% just due to shot selection went up about 3-4% (which is about how much it went up that first year, literally the best thing Steve Kerr ever did was tell curry to either take 1 step forward or 1 step back)</p>

<p>The difference between curry being an all time great and a very high level player is 1 step back</p>

<p>KG took like 30% of his shots from 16ft+ but never took a 3pter</p>

<p>Imagine if he took one step back</p>

      <label for="lif1tsr" class="commentText"><p>Yeah and Brook Lopez shot 9.7% until he started taking them</p>

<p>He started taking them in 2016 and immediately went from 9.7% on 31 attempts to 35% on close to 400 attempts</p>

<p>Horford was <sup>21</sup>&frasl;<sub>65</sub> through his first 8 years, in that time he shot 46% from 16-3, very similar to KG through his career once he started taking threes his averages went up to about 38% from 3</p>

<p>You can even see this in players like Dante Cunningham who in his first 6 seasons took 1.5% of his shots from 3  at a 5.3% (<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>38</sub>) clip, 51.7% of his shots from 16-3 at a 41.1% clip. In 2015-2016 he was told to take a step back and never took more than 20% of his shots from that range again. For the rest of his career he took 10.4% from 16-3 and 45.5% of his shots from 3 and his 3 pt% was a respectable 36.4%. His EFG in his first 6 years 47.3%, in his last 4 54.6% all because he took a step back.</p>

<p>KG only took like 30 3PA per season but he was a 45% shooter drim 16-3pt and that’s where 30% of his shots came from</p>

<p>Even if you assume a crazy high drop off like 10% that still makes him a 35% 3pt shooter</p>

<p>KG went up against Dirk for most of his career, do people really think that the thought of extending his range to the 3 never occurred to him?</p>

<p>A lot of players were killers from mid but weren’t great from 3. Kobe is one of those players - him taking more 3s would actually hurt his game more.</p>

      <label for="lidgabz" class="commentText"><p>The playmaking was okay, I mean it improved due to increased responsibility during his time with the Pistons. However, I’m more impressed with his increased 3 pts shooting, which is definitely an enhanced skill set, as you pointed out.</p>

      <label for="lifwmq5" class="commentText"><p>I strongly disagree with this answer because his 3pt shooting wasn&rsquo;t something he could&rsquo;ve figured out any earlier in his career.  In fact, he did figure out early in his career that he needed to work on his jumpshot and extend his range.  It just took him 5 years of consistently improving his shot until he could make enough of them from 3.</p>

<p>It was apparent if you watched him from 2013 to 2018 but even if you didn&rsquo;t watch him during those year, you can see it on his shot profile.  More and more of his attempts moved out to the 20 feet range from 2013 to 2016.  It took until 2017 for him to be able to push his range out to the 3 point line, and it took until 2018 for it to become a legitimate weapon.</p>

      <label for="lif5gwd" class="commentText"><p>Bron always took jump shots and 3s. It wasn&rsquo;t due to a lack of trying, it just took him years to get his form down.</p>

<p>It might even be related due to his decline in athleticism that allowed him to shoot more consistently. If you watch him in his original cavs stint he gets a lot of air on his jumpers, which is similar to westbrook jumpers/layup always coming at too much speed.</p>

<p>Same might even be true for Jason kidd and Vince Carter as they both progressed massive as 3 point shooters once their athleticism declined. That may be more related to them having to branch out their game as they could no longer rely on their athletics.</p>

<p>Lebron&rsquo;s 3 is still wildly inconsistent even in recent years, but if you take his peak year(this past year), then he would have been unstoppable in his prime lol. There would be no GOAT debate.</p>

<p> Yes, Ray deserves a shout as well—though I literally can’t recall a single midrange shot from him—absolute god from deep and a nasty finisher at the rim, but I digress.</p>

<p>And Dirk, I suppose, with his comically unstoppable midrange and remarkably efficient spacing. </p>

      <label for="liggxew" class="commentText"><p>Miller was a shooting guard. Curry is better as a pass first combo guard, and was considered too short to play SG coming out of college, especially in an era where Kobe, Dwyane, PP, and Joe Johnson were tearing it up as ball dominant taller combo guards.</p>

<p>AI was a horrible comp for Steph, and other than him it was Nash and CP3. Nash is a better comp because his run and gun style matched what Steph did best in college, whereas CP3&rsquo;s meticulous PnR half court style was not a great fit.</p>

<p>Ironically, he spend much of his early career playing more of a CP3 style with more shooting until Kerr came along, where he started moving more off ball and doing catch and shoots rather than PnR pull ups in the lane a la CP3.</p>

      <label for="lifs2js" class="commentText"><p>Surprised this is this far down. Nash&rsquo;s career was great, but&hellip; 42.8% 3p shooter for his career on 3.2 attempts per game, at his peak he would attempt almost 5 threes per game.</p>

<p>He could easily have had 12 attempts per game and been efficient. I think it would have set up his career to be Steph Curry before Steph Curry. Maybe with slightly worse shooting and finishing and slightly better playmaking, but Nash is already the prototype for what Curry became, he just didn&rsquo;t know how far to push it.</p>

Hell in 2011 37% of his FGA were from 16ft to the 3pt line (which he hit at a great 53%), compared to only 23% coming inside 3 feet. He only took four actual 3s on the season, of even a third of his long 2s became 3s instead, even with an expected drop off in percentage, it could’ve helped out a lot</p>

      <label for="liehsw1" class="commentText"><p>The way you can usually tell if it’s a player problem or a usage problem is by looking at the shot data</p>

<p>Lopez took around 28-30% of his shots from 10 feet - 3pt line now that number is closer to 10%, but he shot 42% from 10-16 feet and 39.5 from 16-3p, so it’s fair to say he could very easily be a 36% 3pt shooter</p>

<p>Horford is in the same boat 42% of his shots from 10-3pt, which cut in half when he started taking 3s. But he shot 45% from 10-16 and 46% from 16-3. Which again means that a 40% 3pt shooter feels very possible.</p>

<p>There isn’t great data for this but Hakeem and Ewing are probably shooting very similar stats from 10 feet - 3 pt line over their primes and most of their inefficiency is due to high percentage of mid range shots.</p>

<p>I think that’s why when ever people ask if new team would beat old team I ask them does old team get time to learn modern tactics, if yes then it’ll be close, if no old team will get stomped</p>

      <label for="liexu0t" class="commentText"><p>But on the other side, players like Anthony Davis and KG never really were able to make that a reliable part of their arsenal. I don’t think just because it happens for some players, you can say others would be able to do it as well. And even if it did, there’s no telling the portion of their career when it would happen. It doesn’t necessarily mean they get to figure it out in their athletic primes which would have made them even more terrifying forces on the floor, but it might have let them extend their career as role players like a Lopez or horford.</p>

Post MVP Westbrook’s free throw line elbow jumper fell in at about 36% the last time I looked at the numbers. Before that, it went in at about 41%. Even then, it wasn’t the greatest shot; it was just respectable enough that defenders actually had to guard it.</p>

<p>Embiid post 2021 effectively had to relearn how to play within a normal offense, because passing out to an open PG on the perimeter should be the right play.  But when your PG is Ben Simmons, it changed the calculus drastically.</p>

<p>Demar Derozen on the Spurs showed he was a much better playmaker than he got credit for. He gets thought of as just a scorer but I think he could have been more.</p>

<p>I also wonder if early career Jrue was miscast as a first option and point guard and when he decided to become a defense first destroyer he really went up a level</p>

      <label for="lieblmm" class="commentText"><p>For me, it&rsquo;s Andre Drummond if he realized what he wasn&rsquo;t. Literally all he had to do was less. Stop shooting threes, stopping trying to cross people over, stop with the leaning &amp; contested 13-foot running floaters, and stop trying to thread backboard bounce passes through traffic.</p>

<p>If he&rsquo;d have just stuck to the things for which he was exceptional—rebounding, blocking some shots, dunking alley-oops, tipping in missed shots—he would have been a wonderful asset, even with the poor free throw shooting. Instead, his prime is defined by how he nullified every positive action on the court with something terrible.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s why I think the first couple years of his career are probably his best, just because he didn&rsquo;t have the gall to start wiling out like he did just yet. He was basically an energy guy out there at the time, eating rebounds and dunking shots, the end.</p>

He needed a few years to develop physically enough to endure the punishment of the late 80s game, but I think the better attitude he achieved towards playing for the benefit of his teammates might have given him a couple more titles in the late 80s. The Pistons little mini dynasty was a regrettable period for the league. It was the worst type of basketball.</p>

      <label for="lif6zwk" class="commentText"><p>Blake Griffin, Al Horford, and Brook Lopez were instances of players changing their game along with how the game was played. They already did it right by playing the style of basketball they used to. Even if they had skills for the 3&rsquo;s earlier in their career, it would&rsquo;ve been underutilized because of how good were in the interior already, and basketball back then valued that skillset for them.</p>

      <label for="ligcx7n" class="commentText"><p>I can’t help but think just how incomprehensibly good Kobe would’ve been if he got his ego in check at least a little.</p>

<p>His ego fuelled a lot of his greatness, no doubt, but it also annihilated chemistry between him and many of his teammates. Additionally, if he dialled down his shot tendency and actually tapped into his passing game (which was phenomenal when he used it) he could’ve been a pretty much unstoppable offensive powerhouse. The problem with being so triggerhappy is it makes your late game offence exceptionally predictable. Not knowing who will take the final shot is a massive advantage to allow yourself to squander, but Kobe squandered it time and time again because the defence ALWAYS knew he was the one that was gonna shoot. I cannot even begin to count the number of games where, down the stretch, they would throw double or even triple teams at Kobe and he’d just chuck up some bullshit with 1-2 guys completely unguarded on the perimeter.</p>
