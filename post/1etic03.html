      <p>Let’s play some what-if’s.</p>

<p>I’m not talking about Ben Simmons finding a shot because he never found one. I’m talking about cases like Brook Lopez becoming one of the better three point shooters. Essentially taking an improvement that comes from the latter part of a player’s career and attaching to their skillsets earlier on.</p>

      <label for="liejto7" class="commentText"><p>That is so many careers omg</p>

<p>Stephen curry took 27% of his shots from 16feet-the 3 pt like through the first 5 years of his career. you can see the year Kerr takes over cuz that percent cuts to 16 in year 1 and 9 in the 73-9 year</p>

<p>It’s like Mark Jackson Curry 46.5% of his shots were from 3feet-3pt line. First 2 years of Kerr he cuts that number to 27.2% essentially meaning 19% of his shots started being 45% more efficient. Essentially you can say his TS% just due to shot selection went up about 3-4% (which is about how much it went up that first year, literally the best thing Steve Kerr ever did was tell curry to either take 1 step forward or 1 step back)</p>

<p>The difference between curry being an all time great and a very high level player is 1 step back</p>

<p>KG took like 30% of his shots from 16ft+ but never took a 3pter</p>

<p>Imagine if he took one step back</p>

      <label for="lif1tsr" class="commentText"><p>Yeah and Brook Lopez shot 9.7% until he started taking them</p>

<p>He started taking them in 2016 and immediately went from 9.7% on 31 attempts to 35% on close to 400 attempts</p>

<p>Horford was <sup>21</sup>&frasl;<sub>65</sub> through his first 8 years, in that time he shot 46% from 16-3, very similar to KG through his career once he started taking threes his averages went up to about 38% from 3</p>

<p>You can even see this in players like Dante Cunningham who in his first 6 seasons took 1.5% of his shots from 3  at a 5.3% (<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>38</sub>) clip, 51.7% of his shots from 16-3 at a 41.1% clip. In 2015-2016 he was told to take a step back and never took more than 20% of his shots from that range again. For the rest of his career he took 10.4% from 16-3 and 45.5% of his shots from 3 and his 3 pt% was a respectable 36.4%. His EFG in his first 6 years 47.3%, in his last 4 54.6% all because he took a step back.</p>

<p>KG only took like 30 3PA per season but he was a 45% shooter drim 16-3pt and that’s where 30% of his shots came from</p>

<p>Even if you assume a crazy high drop off like 10% that still makes him a 35% 3pt shooter</p>

      <label for="lifdh5q" class="commentText"><p>Anthony Davis is a career 37.8% shooter from 16-3 , 8% worse than KG, worse than Brook Lopez also</p>

<p>Tim Duncan never played in the 3pt era and never took 3s so we don’t know how he would have done. Also Tim Duncan was had worse efficiency than KG from 16-3 and half the volume so again not even compatible.</p>

<p>Demar Derozan also only shoots 40% from 16-3 on his career and and has always been more effective in the short mid range (this one is the best example given though)</p>

<p>If you want to find examples of players find players who efficiently took long range 2s and then started shooting 3s instead and all of them were able to do it effectively</p>

<p>Examples:
LMA in seasons he took 50+ 3pt shots he was a 36.5% shooter (<sup>179</sup>&frasl;<sub>490</sub>)(5 seasons)</p>

<p>In seasons where he was shooting less he was a 21.8% shooter (<sup>48</sup>&frasl;<sub>220</sub>)(11 seasons) Long 2-&amp;gt;3 (42.8-&amp;gt;36.5)</p>

<p>Brook Lopez same restrictions
9.7% (<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>31</sub> 8 seasons) -&amp;gt; 35.2% (<sup>933</sup>&frasl;<sub>2651</sub> 8 seasons) long 2-&amp;gt;3 (39.5-&amp;gt;35.2)</p>

<p>Al Horford 32.3% (<sup>21</sup>&frasl;<sub>65</sub>, 8 seasons) -&amp;gt; 38.1% (<sup>841</sup>&frasl;<sub>2210</sub> 9 seasons) long 2-&amp;gt;3 (46.4-&amp;gt;38.1)</p>

<p>Dante Cunningham 5.3% (<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>38</sub> 6 seasons) -&amp;gt; 36.4% (<sup>214</sup>&frasl;<sub>588</sub> 3 seasons) long 2-&amp;gt;3 (41.1-&amp;gt;36.4)</p>

<p>Luis Scola 16.7% (<sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>60</sub>, 8 seasons) -&amp;gt; 38.9% (<sup>82</sup>&frasl;<sub>211</sub> 2 seasons) (44.8-&amp;gt;38.9)</p>

<p>Khris Humphries 7.7% (<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>26</sub>, 11 seasons) -&amp;gt; 32.7% (<sup>53</sup>&frasl;<sub>162</sub> 2 seasons) (40.9-&amp;gt;32.7)</p>

<p>Maurice Speights 24.1 (<sup>19</sup>&frasl;<sub>79</sub> 7 seasons) -&amp;gt; 37.2% (<sup>213</sup>&frasl;<sub>572</sub>, 3 seasons) (43.2-37.2)</p>

<p>Blake Griffin 27.1% (<sup>42</sup>&frasl;<sub>155</sub>, 6 seasons) -&amp;gt; 33.4% (<sup>496</sup>&frasl;<sub>1484</sub> 7 seasons) (37.5-&amp;gt;33.4)</p>

<p>BTW these aren’t just people who improved 3pt percentage this is Every player that shot 25% of their shots from 16-3 for the 2013-2014 season but less than 5% of their shots from 3 AND took 50 3Pa or more for a good chunk of their career after 2013-2014 as you can see EVERY player who met these rules had there 3pt % go up and the aberage drop off from there long 2% to there 3pt % was 6% with the biggest being 8.2% (ADs difference between long 2 and 3 is 8.1% btw)</p>

<p>If we assume KG has literally the biggest drop off of all comparable players that’s still makes him a 37% 3pt shooter which is really good.</p>

      <label for="lif9b9o" class="commentText"><p>I think his argument relies more of the fact that Lopez amongst many others became elite shooters because they focused on it. It’s not unreasonable to say that those three could be 36% or so three point shooters if they tried. Frankly if you’re a professional basketball player, you should be able to hit a three at a decent rate. At least in AD and Duncan’s cases, they’re bigs who don’t see the arc much. DeRozan I think is just a guy who doesn’t want to get with the times. He likes his midrange.</p>

<p>Not everyone can be Steph. But everyone can be a good shooter. If you focus on shooting threes, you’ll get good at shooting threes.</p>

<p>LeBron might be the best example of a non-shooter becoming a shooter. Poor midrange shot and three point shot for most of his career. Focused on shooting as his athleticism has declined. Career high 41.0% from three in year 21. If “LeBrick” can become a good three point shooter, anyone can.</p>

<p>KG went up against Dirk for most of his career, do people really think that the thought of extending his range to the 3 never occurred to him?</p>

<p>A lot of players were killers from mid but weren’t great from 3. Kobe is one of those players - him taking more 3s would actually hurt his game more.</p>

      <label for="lifp27z" class="commentText"><p>I said on here the other day that I think Blake and Durant both have better careers if CP3 and Westbrook switch places. Prime Durant and CP3 is basically a perfect combo, and Westbrook would&rsquo;ve gotten along way better with the Clippers team than CP3 did, plus he wasn&rsquo;t as bad of a spacing liability in his prime as he is now.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d consider an elite player to be the type who can lead a good team to a championship and be top 3 in the league consistently. If Blake had his jumper and 3-point shot earlier in his career, he could&rsquo;ve been at that level.</p>

      <label for="lif5gwd" class="commentText"><p>Bron always took jump shots and 3s. It wasn&rsquo;t due to a lack of trying, it just took him years to get his form down.</p>

<p>It might even be related due to his decline in athleticism that allowed him to shoot more consistently. If you watch him in his original cavs stint he gets a lot of air on his jumpers, which is similar to westbrook jumpers/layup always coming at too much speed.</p>

<p>Same might even be true for Jason kidd and Vince Carter as they both progressed massive as 3 point shooters once their athleticism declined. That may be more related to them having to branch out their game as they could no longer rely on their athletics.</p>

<p>Nash was probably the best shooter ever before Steph, imo. His efficiency was incredible, especially for his size, and he was insane at all 3 levels.</p>

<p> Yes, Ray deserves a shout as well—though I literally can’t recall a single midrange shot from him—absolute god from deep and a nasty finisher at the rim, but I digress.</p>

<p>And Dirk, I suppose, with his comically unstoppable midrange and remarkably efficient spacing. </p>

<p>Bird obviously gets a mention too….</p>

<p>But Steph, wow.</p>

Hell in 2011 37% of his FGA were from 16ft to the 3pt line (which he hit at a great 53%), compared to only 23% coming inside 3 feet. He only took four actual 3s on the season, of even a third of his long 2s became 3s instead, even with an expected drop off in percentage, it could’ve helped out a lot</p>

      <label for="liehsw1" class="commentText"><p>The way you can usually tell if it’s a player problem or a usage problem is by looking at the shot data</p>

<p>Lopez took around 28-30% of his shots from 10 feet - 3pt line now that number is closer to 10%, but he shot 42% from 10-16 feet and 39.5 from 16-3p, so it’s fair to say he could very easily be a 36% 3pt shooter</p>

<p>Horford is in the same boat 42% of his shots from 10-3pt, which cut in half when he started taking 3s. But he shot 45% from 10-16 and 46% from 16-3. Which again means that a 40% 3pt shooter feels very possible.</p>

<p>There isn’t great data for this but Hakeem and Ewing are probably shooting very similar stats from 10 feet - 3 pt line over their primes and most of their inefficiency is due to high percentage of mid range shots.</p>

<p>I think that’s why when ever people ask if new team would beat old team I ask them does old team get time to learn modern tactics, if yes then it’ll be close, if no old team will get stomped</p>

My guess is if he played now that would prob be about 3.5 (Gobert btw is 2.2)</p>

(Note: “FG% by distance” only goes back to ‘96 -‘97 season, so this was after his prime years)  Despite that we see similar trends when compared to Horford. So he easily could’ve been a 34 to 38% 3pt shooter.</p>

      <label for="lifnaxy" class="commentText"><p>Yeah In this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/s/QGjUfJmwss" target="_blank">comment</a> I talk about every single player who took 25% of their shots from long 2 and less than 5% of their shots from 3 in 2013-2014 and then shot at least 50 shots from 3 for every year after they started shooting 3s (essentially every player that never took 3s but took a lot of long 2s and then realized it was dumb)</p>

<p>And the average was people shot about 6% worse from 3 than they did when they were shooting long 2s. Sadly for Hakeem that data really isn’t there until he turned 34 which is his last all star season but I’m sure he would have at least been Brook Lopez functional from 3.</p>

<p>There are a lot of players who took so many long 2s and I would love to see what they could have done in this era.</p>

I don’t think just because it happens for some players, you can say others would be able to do it as well. And even if it did, there’s no telling the portion of their career when it would happen. It doesn’t necessarily mean they get to figure it out in their athletic primes which would have made them even more terrifying forces on the floor, but it might have let them extend their career as role players like a Lopez or horford.</p>

Post MVP Westbrook’s free throw line elbow jumper fell in at about 36% the last time I looked at the numbers. Before that, it went in at about 41%. Even then, it wasn’t the greatest shot; it was just respectable enough that defenders actually had to guard it.</p>

Similar block numbers don&rsquo;t mean similar defensive player. He had high block numbers because he wasn&rsquo;t disciplined and chased blocks that led to easy baskets. Maybe it was poor coaching or early career injuries but it wasn&rsquo;t until Milwaukee where coach bud unlocked the defensive beast in Lopez.</p>

Both players are absolutely notorious for how unstoppable on the drive they are so it&rsquo;s very rare for centers to not be sagging off of him meaning when he makes the catch he&rsquo;s usually got a good 15 ft of space to shoot.

<p>Embiid post 2021 effectively had to relearn how to play within a normal offense, because passing out to an open PG on the perimeter should be the right play.  But when your PG is Ben Simmons, it changed the calculus drastically.</p>

<p>Part of it is constant health issues in the playoffs, and part of it is historically he&rsquo;s not as dominant in seven game series when teams actually gameplan around him and defend hard (vs. the regular season).</p>

<p>Listen I love Embiid as much as anyone else, but can we stop making excuses already? Now he&rsquo;s got PG + Maxey, what&rsquo;s the next excuse going to be? We need to see that Serbia game Embiid in the playoffs regularly for him to really make an impact deep into the playoffs.</p>

Imagine that kind of play on two legs instead of one&hellip;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s really my whole point, the version of Embiid against the Knicks would&rsquo;ve been really nice earlier in his career, but I think he&rsquo;s finally figure it out. Better late than never.</p>

<p>Steph taught people that an open shot anywhere can be a good shot if you’re that good.  When LeBron took off in the 2000s, he taught me you can just run through the guy trying to defend you at lightning speed and it’s gonna work.</p>

      <label for="lieblmm" class="commentText"><p>For me, it&rsquo;s Andre Drummond if he realized what he wasn&rsquo;t. Literally all he had to do was less. Stop shooting threes, stopping trying to cross people over, stop with the leaning &amp; contested 13-foot running floaters, and stop trying to thread backboard bounce passes through traffic.</p>

<p>If he&rsquo;d have just stuck to the things for which he was exceptional—rebounding, blocking some shots, dunking alley-oops, tipping in missed shots—he would have been a wonderful asset, even with the poor free throw shooting. Instead, his prime is defined by how he nullified every positive action on the court with something terrible.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s why I think the first couple years of his career are probably his best, just because he didn&rsquo;t have the gall to start wiling out like he did just yet. He was basically an energy guy out there at the time, eating rebounds and dunking shots, the end.</p>

      <label for="lieqpod" class="commentText"><p>Well&hellip;every one of them&hellip;but I&rsquo;m always intrigued by what might have happened if you put Jordan&rsquo;s &lsquo;93 mind and attitude in &lsquo;86 Jordan&rsquo;s body. He needed a few years to develop physically enough to endure the punishment of the late 80s game, but I think the better attitude he achieved towards playing for the benefit of his teammates might have given him a couple more titles in the late 80s. The Pistons little mini dynasty was a regrettable period for the league. It was the worst type of basketball.</p>

      <label for="lif6zwk" class="commentText"><p>Blake Griffin, Al Horford, and Brook Lopez were instances of players changing their game along with how the game was played. They already did it right by playing the style of basketball they used to. Even if they had skills for the 3&rsquo;s earlier in their career, it would&rsquo;ve been underutilized because of how good were in the interior already, and basketball back then valued that skillset for them.</p>

He stopped taking threes completely for one season in ATL and it unsurprisingly was his most efficient one. However, Josh being Josh, he went back to shooting threes and he continously increased his volume the older he got. He figured it out and then threw it away.</p>

<p>He could easily have had 12 attempts per game and been pretty efficient. I think it would have set up his career for being before Steph Curry before Steph Curry. Maybe with slightly worse shooting and finishing and slightly better playmaking, but Nash was already the prototype for what Curry became, he just didn&rsquo;t know how far to push it.</p>
