      <p>Let’s play some what-if’s.</p>

<p>I’m not talking about Ben Simmons finding a shot because he never found one. I’m talking about cases like Brook Lopez becoming one of the better three point shooters. Essentially taking an improvement that comes from the latter part of a player’s career and attaching to their skillsets earlier on.</p>

      <label for="liejto7" class="commentText"><p>That is so many careers omg</p>

<p>Stephen curry took 27% of his shots from 16feet-the 3 pt like through the first 5 years of his career. you can see the year Kerr takes over cuz that percent cuts to 16 in year 1 and 9 in the 73-9 year</p>

<p>It’s like Mark Jackson Curry 46.5% of his shots were from 3feet-3pt line. First 2 years of Kerr he cuts that number to 27.2% essentially meaning 19% of his shots started being 45% more efficient. Essentially you can say his TS% just due to shot selection went up about 3-4% (which is about how much it went up that first year, literally the best thing Steve Kerr ever did was tell curry to either take 1 step forward or 1 step back)</p>

<p>The difference between curry being an all time great and a very high level player is 1 step back</p>

<p>KG took like 30% of his shots from 16ft+ but never took a 3pter</p>

<p>Imagine if he took one step back</p>

      <label for="lif1tsr" class="commentText"><p>Yeah and Brook Lopez shot 9.7% until he started taking them</p>

<p>He started taking them in 2016 and immediately went from 9.7% on 31 attempts to 35% on close to 400 attempts</p>

<p>Horford was <sup>21</sup>&frasl;<sub>65</sub> through his first 8 years, in that time he shot 46% from 16-3, very similar to KG through his career once he started taking threes his averages went up to about 38% from 3</p>

<p>You can even see this in players like Dante Cunningham who in his first 6 seasons took 1.5% of his shots from 3  at a 5.3% (<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>38</sub>) clip, 51.7% of his shots from 16-3 at a 41.1% clip. In 2015-2016 he was told to take a step back and never took more than 20% of his shots from that range again. For the rest of his career he took 10.4% from 16-3 and 45.5% of his shots from 3 and his 3 pt% was a respectable 36.4%. His EFG in his first 6 years 47.3%, in his last 4 54.6% all because he took a step back.</p>

<p>KG only took like 30 3PA per season but he was a 45% shooter drim 16-3pt and that’s where 30% of his shots came from</p>

<p>Even if you assume a crazy high drop off like 10% that still makes him a 35% 3pt shooter</p>

      <label for="liddjf7" class="commentText"><p>Good shout.</p>

<p>Nash was probably the best shooter ever before Steph, imo. His efficiency was incredible, especially for his size, and he was insane at all 3 levels.</p>

<p> Yes, Ray deserves a shout as well—though I literally can’t recall a single midrange shot from him—absolute god from deep and a nasty finisher at the rim, but I digress.</p>

<p>And Dirk, I suppose, with his comically unstoppable midrange and remarkably efficient spacing. </p>

<p>Bird obviously gets a mention too….</p>

<p>But Steph, wow.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d consider an elite player to be the type who can lead a good team to a championship and be top 3 in the league consistently. If Blake had his jumper and 3-point shot earlier in his career, he could&rsquo;ve been at that level.</p>

      <label for="liehsw1" class="commentText"><p>The way you can usually tell if it’s a player problem or a usage problem is by looking at the shot data</p>

<p>Lopez took around 28-30% of his shots from 10 feet - 3pt line now that number is closer to 10%, but he shot 42% from 10-16 feet and 39.5 from 16-3p, so it’s fair to say he could very easily be a 36% 3pt shooter</p>

<p>Horford is in the same boat 42% of his shots from 10-3pt, which cut in half when he started taking 3s. But he shot 45% from 10-16 and 46% from 16-3. Which again means that a 40% 3pt shooter feels very possible.</p>

<p>There isn’t great data for this but Hakeem and Ewing are probably shooting very similar stats from 10 feet - 3 pt line over their primes and most of their inefficiency is due to high percentage of mid range shots.</p>

<p>I think that’s why when ever people ask if new team would beat old team I ask them does old team get time to learn modern tactics, if yes then it’ll be close, if no old team will get stomped</p>

      <label for="liexu0t" class="commentText"><p>But on the other side, players like Anthony Davis and KG never really were able to make that a reliable part of their arsenal. I don’t think just because it happens for some players, you can say others would be able to do it as well. And even if it did, there’s no telling the portion of their career when it would happen. It also doesn’t necessarily mean they get to figure it out in their athletic primes which would have made them even more terrifying forces on the floor, but it might have let them extend their career as role players like a Lopez or horford.</p>

      <label for="lidztz1" class="commentText"><p>He didn’t just stop. The shot stopped going in. Post MVP Westbrook’s free throw line elbow jumper fell in at about 36% the last time I looked at the numbers. Before that, it went in at about 41%. Even then, it wasn’t the greatest shot; it was just respectable enough that defenders actually had to guard it.</p>

Similar block numbers don&rsquo;t mean similar defensive player. He had high block numbers because he wasn&rsquo;t disciplined and chased blocks that led to easy baskets. Maybe it was poor coaching or early career injuries but it wasn&rsquo;t until Milwaukee where coach bud unlocked the defensive beast in Lopez.</p>

Both players are absolutely notorious for how unstoppable on the drive they are so it&rsquo;s very rare for centers to not be sagging off of him meaning when he makes the catch he&rsquo;s usually got a good 15 ft of space to shoot. Him becoming a better shooter has been remarkable for his career. But It&rsquo;s also played out at the most beneficial time of his career that it could have</p>

<p>Embiid post 2021 effectively had to relearn how to play within a normal offense, because passing out to an open PG on the perimeter should be the right play.  But when your PG is Ben Simmons, it changed the calculus drastically.</p>

<p>Part of it is constant health issues in the playoffs, and part of it is historically he&rsquo;s not as dominant in seven game series when teams actually gameplan around him and defend hard (vs. the regular season).</p>

<p>Listen I love Embiid as much as anyone else, but can we stop making excuses already? Now he&rsquo;s got PG + Maxey, what&rsquo;s the next excuse going to be? We need to see that Serbia game Embiid in the playoffs regularly for him to really make an impact deep into the playoffs.</p>

Imagine that kind of play on two legs instead of one&hellip;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s really my whole point, the version of Embiid against the Knicks would&rsquo;ve been really nice earlier in his career, but I think he&rsquo;s finally figure it out. Better late than never.</p>

      <label for="lieblmm" class="commentText"><p>For me, it&rsquo;s Andre Drummond if he realized what he wasn&rsquo;t. Literally all he had to do was less. Stop shooting threes, stopping trying to cross people over, stop with the leaning &amp; contested 13-foot running floaters, and stop trying to thread backboard bounce passes through traffic.</p>

<p>If he&rsquo;d have just stuck to the things for which he was exceptional—rebounding, blocking some shots, dunking alley-oops, tipping in missed shots—he would have been a wonderful asset, even with the poor free throw shooting. Instead, his prime is defined by how he nullified every positive action on the court with something terrible.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s why I think the first couple years of his career are probably his best, just because he didn&rsquo;t have the gall to start wiling out like he did just yet. He was basically an energy guy out there at the time, eating rebounds and dunking shots, the end.</p>

      <label for="lieqpod" class="commentText"><p>Well&hellip;every one of them&hellip;but I&rsquo;m always intrigued by what might have happened if you put Jordan&rsquo;s &lsquo;93 mind and attitude in &lsquo;86 Jordan&rsquo;s body. He needed a few years to develop physically enough to endure the punishment of the late 80s game, but I think the better attitude he achieved towards playing for the benefit of his teammates might have given him a couple more titles in the late 80s. The Pistons little mini dynasty was a regrettable period for the league. It was the worst type of basketball.</p>

      <label for="liesclp" class="commentText"><p>What if&hellip;. Brandon Roy was born with knees? He was soooo good even partially healthy and he came in the league when Point Guards were the strongest in the last 40 or 50 years (around the same time as Deron Williams, Monte Ellis, Chris Paul on the eve of players like Baron Davis, Stephon Marbury and Stevie Francis).</p>

<p>Talk about a what if&hellip;</p>

      <label for="liev638" class="commentText"><p>Gonna twist this a bit.</p>

<p>If the Raptors realized they could play Bargnani at the 3 alongside Bosh and a defensive center, who knows where that franchise would&rsquo;ve ended up.</p>

<p>They tried it once or twice but should&rsquo;ve committed to the bit. He wasn&rsquo;t going to rebound anyway, let him spot up the way he wanted to.</p>
