      <p>James Harden in the two seasons from 18-19 and 19-20 averaged 35/7/8 across 146 games. He led the league in winshares during the span with 28.3.</p>

<p>While often labelled as a playoff under-performer, he also averaged 31/7/6 on 60% TS in the playoffs during this span.</p>

<p>His peak was truly remarkable and it&rsquo;s a shame he only won a single MVP during his offensive prime.</p>

<p>Just to put things in perspective, Giannis who won two MVPs averaged 28/13/6 on 63% TS in the regular season during that span and 26/13/5 in the playoffs on 58% TS.</p>

<p>Theres a reason he isnt (currently) remembered as a historic player despite the historic box scores. Deserved or not hes THE poster child for foul baiting</p>

<p>The sentiment will fade over time but starting ~2015 the Harden rockets were one of, if not the first team to truly commit to 3 pts &amp; drawing fouls as an offense, completely dropping the mid range and ushering in a new era to the NBA</p>

<p>In his Thunder days, 14.91% of his total FGA came in that range, and he coincidentally also shot .397 on those attempts.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s really never been more than a decent mid-range shooter, so his de-emphasis of those shots does make sense.</p>

      <label for="le1kx8n" class="commentText"><p>I like Harden but he ever had it in him to be a mid range savant. He has a good shooting stroke but doesn’t have the size or touch of someone like Durant, nor did have the post footwork or elevation on his shot to consistently get shots off like a Kobe or Derozan. It’s the only real weakness in his game where he’s completely reliant on getting separation to get his shot off. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him take a turnaround jumper. Compare that to guys like Kyrie or Luka who can create shots in crafty ways from different angles despite being off balance.</p>

<p>It’s the reason his scoring has dropped off so drastically compared to other aging scoring superstar guards. I know his assist numbers are up and that’s pretty impressive, but to go from 36ppg to 16 or whatever it is in just a few years is a pretty big drop off and shows how reliant he was on his quick first step and using that to create separation on the step-back.</p>

<p>I think it’s an underrated skill that becomes super valuable in the playoffs. Kawhi is incredible at getting mid range jumpers off in tight spaces and is one of the best playoff performers as a result. I think this will hold back someone like Tyrese Halliburton. He’s a great player, brilliant passer and accurate shooter, but because of his weird stroke I don’t see him being able to get jump shots off without getting a lot of separation so he’ll never become the dominant scorer needed to become a mega star.</p>

<p>It’s a testament to Harden that he was able to become one of the best scorers ever without having that in his arsenal. His incredible footwork on the perimeter, dancing around and using the stepback for separation, and incredible first-step and slashing ability combined with sublime passing. If he had a little more Kobe/Kyrie in his game he would surely have become an even more absurd scorer and would probably still be able to put up 27-28 today.</p>

      <label for="le1qlqj" class="commentText"><p>this is a fantastic comment and actually changed the way i view harden’s game.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>one thing i’ll say is that it’s not only about separation but also him being in a rhythm — he’d forego a clean, catch-and-shoot open look to instead take the time to gather and spin the ball in his hand and then hit the contested shot.</p>

<p>in a weird way i think his space creation was less about the defender’s position &amp; lack of leverage and moreso about giving harden the time he needs to gather / rhythm dribble and shoot comfortably.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Compare that to guys like Kyrie or Luka who can create shots in crafty ways from different angles despite being off balance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>damn you’re completely right. this changed my perspective.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>see this is the most curious thing to me. because while i agree with you about the first step disadvantage, i’m not sold on this alone being the difference between 36ppg to 16ppg — i feel like a lot of it is in his head.</p>

<p>there’s a lack of confidence where it’s made him more passive and role-oriented and he masks that with “playing the right way” and “i dont need to be the harden of 2018” type beat. i just don’t buy it.</p>

He became a better scorer than kd while also being an all time great floor general. Outside of joining a 73 win team to get a ring if you actually look at those years harden managed to squeeze in just as many accolades as kd has had his entire career, if not more, into just those seasons.</p>

<p>By comparison SGA in 2022 averaged more free throw attempts than Harden did in his MVP season but no one was calling him a foul baiter and saying he only scored with free throws yet, because casual fans only go by narratives</p>

When he averaged 36 ppg the second leading scorer was at 28 ppg. Now basically every playoff team has someone averaging 28+.</p>

<p>He then proceeded to average 35 against the kd warriors while clearly outplaying Steph while his second option was “worst contract in the league” Cp3, and took two games off the kd warriors, more than lebron ever did in total.</p>

<p>Have you ever noticed how every argument against harden is solely based on specific bad playoff games he’s had, games that every superstar has had? It’s because any actual fact or metric has prime harden as one of the greatest playoff performers ever as well as one of the greatest clutch playoff scorers ever and any objective argument would show he’s easily a top 20 player of all time, you guys just don’t like him.</p>

      <label for="le1kdy1" class="commentText"><p>wtf lmao? Now we’re knocking him for scoring on such a huge volume so efficiently? If it’s so easy why had no one done it in 30 years and why has no one done it since when it’s way easier to score now? They just don’t want to win.</p>

<p>In 2019 Houston had a terrible roster, harden took 719 isos, second was at 297. Not only was he the most efficient iso player by far, it was the most efficient play in basketball. Why would you not utilize it?</p>

<p>Maybe you didn’t like watching his play style (I’m sure you’re a huge Luka fan though lmao), but that’s not hardens fault it’s moreys. It was literally the best offensive play they could run and was incredibly effective. Harden was pretty open about how he hated having to play like that, but given his supporting cast he had no choice.</p>

<p>If it was such a bad way to play why did the rockets finish ahead of teams with vastly superior rosters and why did harden basically singlehandedly take the kd warriors to six, while clearly outplaying Steph, and win more games against them in one season than lebron ever did in his career?</p>

And then how come he was able to go to the nets and instantly be just as dominant, but take a backseat in scoring so Kyrie could shoot 50/40/90 and kd could light it up, despite harden being a better scorer in Houston?</p>

<p>The context behind his big numbers is that he became the best scorer since young mj while playing with shitty supporting casts every year.</p>

<p>Dude just say you hate harden and will no matter what facts are presented to you. It’s so much more tolerable than this blatant hypocrisy and mental gymnastics you’re doing all over this thread.</p>

Also a lot of his foul baiting is way overblown, he did foul bait on the perimeter but it’s not like he was tricking the refs, they were fouls, defenders just had no idea how to guard him. Like teams would have a defender behind him while help shaded over to stop his drive because they were so afraid of his stepback, plus being able to blow by anyone to the rim. A huge portion of his fts were just because he was built like a 6’5 linebacker playing pg and had an insane amount of drives.</p>

<p>Embiid, Giannis, dwade, butler, etc were/are just as bad if not worse with the foul baiting. They literally changed the rules because of KDs rip through move.</p>

<p>And this is with facing insane bias against him from the voters, like not making a single all nba team in 2016 while averaging like 28/6/8, or coming in second in mvp in 2017 and 2019 when he obviously should have won.</p>

<p>he was awful vs russ less okc in 2013</p>

<p>awful vs portland in 2014, 4th best player in that series</p>

<p>2015 benched vs clippers, and had a miserable final game with like 13 turnovers and like 11 points</p>

<p>2016 he was ok vs warriors with no steph</p>

<p>2017 another <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub></p>

<p>2018 idk why he gets credit for this, it&rsquo;s no shame losing to the warriors, but he was awful in that series</p>

<p>i feel bad for him because he did seem to get more comfortable after that, was great in 2019, good in 2020, and looked great in 2021 before the hamstring</p>

<p>but this retelling of his career is just untrue</p>

      <label for="le0ta4k" class="commentText"><p>They needed a secondary POA defender who was elite on the wing. Harden&rsquo;s stinkers notwithstanding, there were notable holes in that roster that &ldquo;Moreyball&rdquo; just wasn&rsquo;t going to fix. Just look at Tatum&rsquo;s postseason run this year. The splits were ugly, but he had the personnel to shift to a playmaking role and let his team pitch in.</p>

<p>I bet Harden&rsquo;s career is talked about differently if those rosters are more rounded out. I&rsquo;m not a Harden guy, but it&rsquo;s hard to deny what  force he was offensively, even with all of his notable flaws as a player.</p>

      <label for="le18ow6" class="commentText"><p>65 wins in the regular season doesn&rsquo;t guarantee a title. The game is played completely differently in the playoffs, and that team showed wildly inconsistent effort throughout the year. They were by no means perfect. Their defensive rating was ranked 26th pre-ASB.</p>

<p>They were optimized to play fast paced offense around Harden, built to generate open looks from 3. Chris Paul was an effective counterweight to that as a floor general who had an in-between game, but could also fit into D&rsquo;Antoni&rsquo;s offensive scheme at large. Once he went out and was limited, the Rockets became incredibly predictable, and Harden played like shit, to make matters worse. Gordon, Tucker, and Ariza choked. Big time.</p>

<p>How is this hard to understand, let alone be ridiculed? Everyone knew that Rockets team was top heavy. Morey trading for Iman Shumpert mid-season wasn&rsquo;t giving them necessary depth in the playoffs. Something the Warriors had in spades, which allowed them to overcome KD&rsquo;s injury issues.</p>

<p>his shooting splits were bad in 2018 against GSW but he was still the best player on the Warriors and was entirely responsible for how the Rockets were able to field the switchable defenders they did. it&rsquo;s like egregious silly to think roleplayers took the Warriors 7 lol</p>

<p>you&rsquo;re like using shooting splits from single games to invalidate what he had to carry all season and post season long. It&rsquo;s weird.</p>

<p>he was not a good playoff performer from 2013-2019, sure he had a couple games here and there, but he clearly was not close to his dominant RS self</p>

<p>2019-2021, he was pretty close to it, but got injured</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re calling a guy who averaged 28/7/8 on 59% TS in that stretch you&rsquo;re talking about &ldquo;not a good playoff performer&rdquo;</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re exaggerating the frequency of bad performances and completely skipping over the good ones. He had bad performances ofc. But almost always because of fatigue after a massive carryjob cuz he never had help until 2018, where he was the best player on a team that took the greatest team of all time 7 games.</p>

      <label for="le1p22r" class="commentText"><p>It’s not a small sample size though, because in <sup>15</sup>&frasl;<sub>15</sub> playoff series in Houston he averaged at least 25 ppg. Do you bring up Lebron scoring 11 in the finals? Do you bring up the countless awful games and series jimmy butler has had?</p>

<p>This sub treats jimmy butler like the exact opposite of harden in the playoffs. Jimmy will have like one amazing game and then average 15 the rest of the series and you all act like he turns into mj in the playoffs.</p>

<p>The difference with harden and other superstars in the playoffs is that he hard carried those teams more than anyone since first cavs stint lebron. If he had a bad game it was usually an automatic loss. Given he probably had the toughest 7 year stretch of playoff opponents in historic he never had a team that could bail him out.</p>

<p>I’m gonna say some things that are just facts.</p>

<p>In the last 25 years harden is tenth in eFG% for clutch playoff scoring. Ahead of Durant, and way ahead of guys like Kobe or dirk.</p>

<p>In the last 15 years he has the fourth most clutch playoff points, and is more efficient on them than guys like Lebron, kd, and jokic.</p>

<p>His elimination game numbers are better than Kobe’s.</p>

He still went 29/6/6 on 54%TS (around average for playoffs) which isn’t great but still is very good. Just happens that he didn’t score 36 of like he does in the regular season. If someone like Brunson averaged those numbers we would say it was a good series from him.</p>

      <label for="le1jbeu" class="commentText"><p>Have you ever noticed arguments about harden being bad in the playoffs are entirely based on specific bad games he’s had? Games that literally every star has had. Lebron scored 11 points in a finals game ffs. Like jimmy butler is the exact opposite, he’ll have one incredible game and then average like 15 for the rest of the series and you guys act like he’s mj in the playoffs. He’s probably had more awful playoff games and series than any other star, unless you count Russ obviously, which I don’t because he’s had maybe one season in his career where you could argue he was a net positive.</p>

<p>Just as an aside I can’t believe people still think Westbrook was anywhere near an mvp caliber player. As far back as 2012 the thunder absolutely tore through the west in the playoffs with kd, harden, and russ, to the point where they were favorites in the finals. Then the heat came up with the perfect strategy to defend Russ in the playoffs (ie dont) and won pretty easily with Russ taking more shots than kd on like half the ts% with barely anyone guarding him. The heat admitted their entire defensive strategy was to shut down harden and get the ball out of his hands (so Russ would have it). The thunder never came close to the level they were that year (they absolutely obliterated the west) despite them all being like 22.</p>

<p>I don’t see how you’re a superstar when you’ve never even come close to making it out of the first round as the first option, and every year you were the second option your team would’ve been so much better off with just an average starting pg who wasn’t going to do their best Kobe impression while missing every shot.</p>

<p>Also what basketball skills has Russ ever been elite at? There really aren’t any, in his prime offensively he was basically just a shorter Ben Simmons with the complete opposite mindset. He was athletic enough to explode to the rim, but even in his prime he was never good at actually finishing at the rim. People bring up the turnovers but don’t understand it’s not just that, Russ actively wastes half your offensive possessions every time he’s on the floor by taking the most shots on the team on like low 30s ts%, which is effectively a shitload of Russ turnovers that don’t show up on the stat sheet. His highest ts% in the playoffs for a season by far was 54% ts, outside of that you were lucky if he broke 50% for a couple years and then has just been in the 40s and 30s the rest of his career.</p>

<p>Because any actual objective argument would show him as an all time great playoff performer, and you guys will bend over backwards to not face reality on that.</p>

      <label for="le1gg3i" class="commentText"><p>And then as soon as they broke up he had to face the lebron and AD lakers with fucking Russ as his second option. Harden was absolutely insane in the 2020 playoffs, by the numbers and the fact that he was getting doubled every time he crossed half court to make Russ have the ball more. No player in history could have made up for Russ taking more shots on like 30% ts while wide open. Harden averaged 64% ts in those playoffs and 29 ppg against that lakers defense while being constantly doubled by a great defensive team.</p>

<p>I legit felt bad for him that playoffs, imo his 2020 playoff were his second best in his career after 2019, even though they didn’t make it that far. He played pretty much as well as anyone has in modern basketball but you can only get so far with Russ on your team.</p>

<p>Harden and kd are the only players ever to drag Russ out of the first round, and they both had to play at an mvp level to do it. Russ was always bad in the playoffs and I def sympathize with kd but harden got the version that was somehow significantly worse. He had to win the scoring title for the third year in a row just to make that team not a bottom seed.</p>

<p>As soon as he hit his prime harden had to play the warriors, spurs, kd warriors, kd warriors, championship lakers in the playoffs and the best sidekick he ever had was half a season of healthy Chris Paul in 2018.</p>

<p>The 2015 (and 2020) Rockets is when Harden performed great carry jobs in the playoffs, but that&rsquo;s also when he had one of his biggest elimination game meltdowns. I don&rsquo;t hold it against him, but if we start comparing to Lebron there are so many levels in between their carry jobs.</p>

<p>While often labelled as a playoff under-performer, he also averaged 31/7/6 on 60% TS in the playoffs during this span.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you state shit like this, you completely miss why Harden  was labeled as a playoff underperformer.</p>

<p>He has always been a volatile player come playoff time. Dominant highs and pathetic lows.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s still the only superstar I&rsquo;ve ever seen that got benched in a 4th quarter of an elimination game. He has many, many big chokes in key moments that stand out in his career. And unfortunately for him, his low points outshine his high points.</p>

<p>Harden is a generational offensive talent, but his incompetent and low-effort defense, and numerous low points in his playoff career tarnish what should be considered as one of the legendary careers of the modern game.</p>

<p>And frankly, he&rsquo;s changed his game in his twilight after losing his speed/athleticism to continue being an effective point guard (unlike Russ, whose career predictably fell of a cliff after his athleticism waned).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really too bad that he never won a ring (and likely won&rsquo;t). He&rsquo;s been an amazing player, though I always disliked his style of play on offense (constantly foul baiting, step back 3s with flailing legs). But his passing was on the level of the greats.</p>

      <label for="le0m9oh" class="commentText"><p>His volatility like always came because of fatigue later in series though. It&rsquo;s painfully obvious when you look at it objectively. He rarely ever had anywhere near the rosters as the teams he would lose to early in his career.</p>

<p>He would carry his team to like +10 more wins than their projection and get them deeper than expected and then be gassed because he was doing so much 1v5ing.</p>

<p>Even when he had a disastrous game in the playoffs like in the WCF in 2015, it would come like right after an insane performance where he had to use everything in the tank.</p>

<p>Nobody he went against was carrying rosters like he was</p>

      <label for="le0u8pt" class="commentText"><p>Yeah his usage was insanely high, a lot of iso, and a lot of dribbling. Of course you can argue it’s his fault for having such a draining playstyle but when you look at like game 6 and 7 against the warriors I think it’s unfair to blame him for those loses. He played great in the first half of both but clearly ran out of gas in the second half of both games, which isn’t shocking when your sole costar gets injured and you’re expected to carry the offensive burden against a team like golden state.</p>

<p>Still almost won game 7 despite no cp, all around shit performance and horrible reffing. Think that was a series that if they were healthy they definitely would’ve won, and would’ve won the finals which would’ve been massive for hardens legacy. I mean he still choked a number of times but having a ring one against that warriors team no less would’ve made his greatness undeniable.</p>

He also famously wasn&rsquo;t a fan of load management so he really was out there carrying night in-night out.</p>

<p>Got nothing but respect for him despite the &ldquo;choking&rdquo;. Dude just caught some bad breaks in his career but still accomplished more than most stars in his career.</p>

<p>Bro what are people saying all this dumb shit for. Obviously if a roster is significantly worse than their opponents you can&rsquo;t just &ldquo;GET THE OTHERS INVOLVED&rdquo; your way to a win. Harden is absolutely known for getting shitty players bags because of how good he made them look</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean they can beat teams significantly better built than them. Go look at some of those rosters man.</p>

<p>This shit just doesn&rsquo;t happen lol. Obviously it worked out, but I cannot recall ever seeing this happen to another superstar.</p>

<p>Harden was <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> from the field, playing zero defense and was a -21 in 3 quarters. i.e. he was baked ass cheeks.</p>

<p>And hell, Josh Smith later came out and said he thinks McHale got fired early next season because of this benching. And that Rockets FO told McHale to put Harden back in and McHale refused.</p>

<p>Of course that could still mean that Harden was the better player, because as you said, individual offense is more valuable than individual defense, but framing it as purely &ldquo;offensive player vs defensive player&rdquo; is dismissive of Giannis&rsquo; two-way ability.</p>

      <label for="le1am8t" class="commentText"><p>THAT’S my exact beef with the Harden hate. People never expected him to do shit. Then hold it against him when he doesn’t. He always overachieved general expectations.. People don’t even talk about 2014 year when Ariza was the 2nd best player on the team and he someone got them in the playoffs. In fact it was an indictment at the time. Every year Harden would destroy win projections. No one even thought the CP/Harden pairing would work.</p>

<p>I will admit, in the playoffs Harden would fall out of the top 5 as a SCORER. The way he carried the team though as an elite playmaker was truly.. only LeBron does that shit. But yeah I always felt if Harden just had one closer with him In his prime, he would win it all. But still, the way he controlled games was so underrated man.</p>

<p>2018</p>

<p>2019</p>

<p>2021.</p>

<p>I really feel like he just got extremely unlucky those years. Those years were his. It takes luck too, all the people who know their shit say it.</p>

      <label for="le1jro4" class="commentText"><p>His playoff perception will always be so interesting to me. Like yes on the one hand the counting stats and efficiency dropped (which to be fair it&rsquo;s also unreasonable to expect someone to maintain his otherworldly regular season numbers in a playoff setting) but he always to me seemed to disappear in moments rather than runs. The unlucky aspect of that I feel like his stinkers also pretty much always coincided with losses - especially crucial losses, so he&rsquo;ll forever be remembered unfavorably as a result.</p>

<p>Honestly I think all of these are irrelevant given his TS% was well above league average. Saying he took x number of shots but &ldquo;under&rdquo; a percentage seems to be making the argument that he was inefficient.</p>

In 2018-19 there were only <strong>5 teams</strong> that shot better from 3 than Harden. Also idk f you got your stats wrong or youre just really bad at math, but Harden shot 36.8% from 3 in 2018-19. If he passes the ball to a 37% shooter, that means over 1000 three point attempts the Rocket would&rsquo;ve made 370 threes instead of 368 threes. A whopping 6 extra points over 1000 attempts.</p>

<p>Harden carried tons of bums. Those rockets players he played with werent good at all. Lou will his costar. Injured dwight. Injured cp3. Then guys with no offensive talent like tucker capela ariza pbev lol. Random 3 and d guys who werent nba lvl.  He hard carried like no one tbh.</p>

<p>Even on the nets he hard carried them to a top seed while kd missed the entire season. The cast around harden and kyrie were bums but harden elevated bums like no one else. Its why those bums sucked ass once harden got hurt the bucks series</p>

<p>The next year Capella got injured and was essentially never the same, Luc left and their old wings got even older. Oh yeah, CP3 regressed heavily that following year too, to the point where people consider the OKC stint later revitalized his career.</p>

      <label for="le1umxm" class="commentText"><p>Prime Harden should have won two MVPs, but the media gave MVP to Steph in 2015 based on his team&rsquo;s record, just an example of voters always moving the goal posts, sometimes they give it to the best player on the best team and sometimes they give it to the best player in the league despite their record, like how Jokic won MVP in 2020 despite the Nuggets being 3rd in the west and having the league&rsquo;s 5th best record</p>

<p>Harden didn&rsquo;t win MVP in 2015 despite his insane season but <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/13298307/james-harden-named-mvp-nbpa-first-annual-players-awards" target="_blank">he won the first ever MVP decided by players only</a>, the players in the league knew Harden was carrying his team more than Steph, must have been at least a little bit of consolation for Harden to know the guys he played against thought he was MVP</p>

      <label for="le17xr0" class="commentText"><p>2018-19 Harden wasn’t super entertaining but it was insane as a basketball experiment. Common sense says no player should be able to take that big an offensive workload without their efficiency declining, but he just stayed right around that .620 mark. I really wonder what it would have looked like if the Rockets just leaned <em>even more</em> into the heliocentricism and just tried to fill out the rest of the roster with guys who were only there for defense.</p>

      <label for="le0uue8" class="commentText"><p>the fuck are you talking about off ball lmao. Who did you want handling the ball???</p>

<p>and also, when he had other actually good playmakers on the team he was fine giving the ball up. But what u wanted Patrick Beverly running the show for him?</p>

<p>A lot of those teams were designed with Harden being the primary ball handler and he didn’t really have a second in command until CP3 came in</p>

<p>And the 2018 Rockets were one of the best teams to not win a ring lol</p>

      <label for="le0vm0d" class="commentText"><p>im not saying there isn’t any truth to your statement, but it takes a <em>very</em> special talent to be able to run a heliocentric offense.</p>

<p>harden, luka, lebron, jokic (kinda)…</p>

<p>it’s pretty impressive and unique for any player who can pull this off.</p>

      <label for="le149gq" class="commentText"><p>Exactly. They don’t move the ball and get their team involved and then everyone laments why they don’t have better players. Can’t ask a guy to do much if his job is to just stand around an watch you.</p>

      <label for="le1gw9c" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of moving the ball but not every team is built to play that way and honestly, its more on the coach to instill that style of play. Watching PJ Washington and DJJ bring the ball up the court in the Finals because they Mavs knew they needed to mix things up was hard to watch.</p>

<p>Granted they&rsquo;d be more comfortable with it had the team been playing like that all year, but it was case in point why these heliocentric teams play the way they do. PJ was getting ripped and throwing the ball at half court multiple times.</p>

      <label for="le1jdqm" class="commentText"><p>I think that’s fair, and Harden + Morey was the perfect storm to go totally overboard with a philosophy.</p>

<p>There’s nothing wrong with Harden, per se, but people need to realize he was a product of a very specific style of play, he wasn’t some all-time great who could just rain points at will however he wanted like most who put up similar numbers.</p>

      <label for="le22twu" class="commentText"><p>Other areas of the game don&rsquo;t help as much as breaking down a defense 1v5 over and over again does. If a player  has the ability and only has a certain amount of energy it is wise to maximize their heliocentric impact. It&rsquo;s the hardest ability to find and the most valuable ability for a team looking for an advantage.</p>
