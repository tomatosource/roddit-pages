      <p>James Harden in the two seasons from 18-19 and 19-20 averaged 35/7/8 across 146 games. He led the league in winshares during the span with 28.3.</p>

<p>While often labelled as a playoff under-performer, he also averaged 31/7/6 on 60% TS in the playoffs during this span.</p>

<p>His peak was truly remarkable and it&rsquo;s a shame he only won a single MVP during his offensive prime.</p>

<p>Just to put things in perspective, Giannis who won two MVPs averaged 28/13/6 on 63% TS in the regular season during that span and 26/13/5 in the playoffs on 58% TS.</p>

<p>Theres a reason he isnt (currently) remembered as a historic player despite the historic box scores. Deserved or not hes THE poster child for foul baiting</p>

<p>The sentiment will fade over time but starting ~2015 the Harden rockets were one of, if not the first team to truly commit to 3 pts &amp; drawing fouls as an offense, completely dropping the mid range and ushering in a new era to the NBA</p>

<p>In his Thunder days, 14.91% of his total FGA came in that range, and he coincidentally also shot .397 on those attempts.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s really never been more than a decent mid-range shooter, so his de-emphasis of those shots does make sense.</p>

No other player that age is expected to peak at that age and never have a bad playoff game. Harden was just so good he was the only player since young Lebron to be expected to do that.</p>

<p>And he still came in third in mvp in 2014 and second (while winning the players vote) in 2015.</p>

      <label for="le1kx8n" class="commentText"><p>I like Harden but he ever had it in him to be a mid range savant. He has a good shooting stroke but doesn’t have the size or touch of someone like Durant, nor did have the post footwork or elevation on his shot to consistently get shots off like a Kobe or Derozan. It’s the only real weakness in his game where he’s completely reliant on getting separation to get his shot off. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him take a turnaround jumper. Compare that to guys like Kyrie or Luka who can create shots in crafty ways from different angles despite being off balance.</p>

<p>It’s the reason his scoring has dropped off so drastically compared to other aging scoring superstar guards. I know his assist numbers are up and that’s pretty impressive, but to go from 36ppg to 16 or whatever it is in just a few years is a pretty big drop off and shows how reliant he was on his quick first step and using that to create separation on the step-back.</p>

<p>I think it’s an underrated skill that becomes super valuable in the playoffs. Kawhi is incredible at getting mid range jumpers off in tight spaces and is one of the best playoff performers as a result. I think this will hold back someone like Tyrese Halliburton. He’s a great player, brilliant passer and accurate shooter, but because of his weird stroke I don’t see him being able to get jump shots off without getting a lot of separation so he’ll never become the dominant scorer needed to become a mega star.</p>

<p>It’s a testament to Harden that he was able to become one of the best scorers ever without having that in his arsenal. His incredible footwork on the perimeter, dancing around and using the stepback for separation, and incredible first-step and slashing ability combined with sublime passing. If he had a little more Kobe/Kyrie in his game he would surely have become an even more absurd scorer and would probably still be able to put up 27-28 today.</p>

      <label for="le1qlqj" class="commentText"><p>this is a fantastic comment and actually changed the way i view harden’s game.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>one thing i’ll say is that it’s not only about separation but also him being in a rhythm — he’d forego a clean, catch-and-shoot open look to instead take the time to gather and spin the ball in his hand and then hit the contested shot.</p>

<p>in a weird way i think his space creation was less about the defender’s position &amp; lack of leverage and moreso about giving harden the time he needs to gather / rhythm dribble and shoot comfortably.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Compare that to guys like Kyrie or Luka who can create shots in crafty ways from different angles despite being off balance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>damn you’re completely right. this changed my perspective.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>see this is the most curious thing to me. because while i agree with you about the first step disadvantage, i’m not sold on this alone being the difference between 36ppg to 16ppg — i feel like a lot of it is in his head.</p>

<p>there’s a lack of confidence where it’s made him more passive and role-oriented and he masks that with “playing the right way” and “i dont need to be the harden of 2018” type beat. i just don’t buy it.</p>

<p>You actually just said that with a straight face about prime harden lmao. I’m comparing and neither of them have ever been at his level for that.</p>

<p>The biggest reason his scoring has gone down is because he takes way less shots. He’s still shown he can drop multiple 40+ point games in the playoffs against the most stacked team in the league when his mvp and scoring leader team mate is shitting the bed.</p>

He became a better scorer than kd while also being an all time great floor general. Outside of joining a 73 win team to get a ring if you actually look at those years harden managed to squeeze in just as many accolades as kd has had his entire career, if not more, into just those seasons.</p>

      <label for="le41s5m" class="commentText"><p>It was the same thing though. He choked in some games yes, but so has every superstar that has to absolutely put the team on their back and drag them into playoff series against better teams.</p>

<p>Harden just got it worse because he was a should have been three time mvp, one second place, and one third place in the span of 7 seasons, his teams were worse than dirks, his competition was harder, and people just wanted to see him fail so bad. And given he was better than dirk any good playoff game he had people just moved the goalposts and were like “well it wasn’t to eliminate the greatest team ever in a game 7 so doesn’t count.”</p>

<p>Also a prime harden team that had a good enough supporting cast to get the one seed would never in a million years lose in the first round.</p>

<p>But dirk was never a “choker”, every big star has “choked” at some point, he was always good, people just instantly forget about it all if you get into a good enough situation where you can win a ring. Or if you’re jimmy butler.</p>

When he averaged 36 ppg the second leading scorer was at 28 ppg. Now basically every playoff team has someone averaging 28+.</p>

<p>He then proceeded to average 35 against the kd warriors while clearly outplaying Steph while his second option was “worst contract in the league” Cp3, and took two games off the kd warriors, more than lebron ever did in total.</p>

<p>Have you ever noticed how every argument against harden is solely based on specific bad playoff games he’s had, games that every superstar has had? It’s because any actual fact or metric has prime harden as one of the greatest playoff performers ever as well as one of the greatest clutch playoff scorers ever and any objective argument would show he’s easily a top 20 player of all time, you guys just don’t like him.</p>

<p>And this is with facing insane bias against him from the voters, like not making a single all nba team in 2016 while averaging like 28/6/8, or coming in second in mvp in 2017 and 2019 when he obviously should have won.</p>

      <label for="le465ah" class="commentText"><p>Can we stop prefacing it with “offensive”? At his peak he was probably a top 5 player in modern basketball. His supporting casts just sucked.</p>

<p>I know this is not something this sub will ever accept, but by 2015 harden was an above average defender at worst. He was a quick, 6’5 linebacker playing pg, and I’m not saying he was all defense levels on 1-3 the rockets could just switch him onto bigs whenever and he’d do a phenomenal job because he just could not be moved down low. He had a season where he defended the most post ups in the league and held opponents to the lowest percentage.</p>

<p>And not that this is a great way to evaluate defense but to some of the idiots on here it is, he has a season where he led the league in steals and 7 other seasons in the top 20.</p>

<p>Harden was also so good people forget how young he was when he was expected to be a star. He was handed a shitty rockets team when he was 23 and basically told “have at it”. That’s a year older than ant. And in his second year there he came in third in mvp. His third year he came in second while winning the players mvp. No other superstars have cruised to a championship at that age. They all had bad playoff games at that age.</p>

<p>Harden was just like the only star good enough to be handed a shitty team at such a young age and expected to win with no help since young Lebron.</p>

      <label for="le1gg3i" class="commentText"><p>And then as soon as they broke up he had to face the lebron and AD lakers with fucking Russ as his second option. Harden was absolutely insane in the 2020 playoffs, by the numbers and the fact that he was getting doubled every time he crossed half court to make Russ have the ball more. No player in history could have made up for Russ taking more shots on like 30% ts while wide open. Harden averaged 64% ts in those playoffs and 29 ppg against that lakers defense while being constantly doubled by a great defensive team.</p>

<p>I legit felt bad for him that playoffs, imo his 2020 playoff were his second best in his career after 2019, even though they didn’t make it that far. He played pretty much as well as anyone has in modern basketball but you can only get so far with Russ on your team.</p>

<p>Harden and kd are the only players ever to drag Russ out of the first round, and they both had to play at an mvp level to do it. Russ was always bad in the playoffs and I def sympathize with kd but harden got the version that was somehow significantly worse. He had to win the scoring title for the third year in a row just to make that team not a bottom seed.</p>

<p>As soon as he hit his prime harden had to play the warriors, spurs, kd warriors, kd warriors, championship lakers in the playoffs and the best sidekick he ever had was half a season of healthy Chris Paul in 2018.</p>

<p>2015 benched vs clippers, and had a miserable final game with like 13 turnovers and like 11 points</p>

<p>2018 idk why he gets credit for this, it&rsquo;s no shame losing to the warriors, but he was awful in that series</p>

<p>i feel bad for him because he did seem to get more comfortable after that, was great in 2019, good in 2020, and looked great in 2021 before the hamstring</p>

Harden&rsquo;s stinkers notwithstanding, there were notable holes in that roster that &ldquo;Moreyball&rdquo; just wasn&rsquo;t going to fix. Just look at Tatum&rsquo;s postseason run this year. The splits were ugly, but he had the personnel to shift to a playmaking role and let his team pitch in.</p>

<p>I bet Harden&rsquo;s career is talked about differently if those rosters are more rounded out. I&rsquo;m not a Harden guy, but it&rsquo;s hard to deny what  force he was offensively, even with all of his notable flaws as a player.</p>

<p>his shooting splits were bad in 2018 against GSW but he was still the best player on the Warriors and was entirely responsible for how the Rockets were able to field the switchable defenders they did. it&rsquo;s like egregious silly to think roleplayers took the Warriors 7 lol</p>

<p>you&rsquo;re like using shooting splits from single games to invalidate what he had to carry all season and post season long. It&rsquo;s weird.</p>

<p>he was not a good playoff performer from 2013-2019, sure he had a couple games here and there, but he clearly was not close to his dominant RS self</p>

<p>2019-2021, he was pretty close to it, but got injured</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re calling a guy who averaged 28/7/8 on 59% TS in that stretch you&rsquo;re talking about &ldquo;not a good playoff performer&rdquo;</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re exaggerating the frequency of bad performances and completely skipping over the good ones. He had bad performances ofc. But almost always because of fatigue after a massive carryjob cuz he never had help until 2018, where he was the best player on a team that took the greatest team of all time 7 games.</p>

He still went 29/6/6 on 54%TS (around average for playoffs) which isn’t great but still is very good. Just happens that he didn’t score 36 of like he does in the regular season. If someone like Brunson averaged those numbers we would say it was a good series from him.</p>

<p>It’s important to pick out any lowlight games, but hey, let’s ignore how he went into OKC and scored 31 on 66% to send the series to Game 6. Or the 31 in Game 7 against the Clippers, or averaging 33-10-9 on 58 FG% on the road in those first two games against the Warriors.</p>

      <label for="le1jbeu" class="commentText"><p>Have you ever noticed arguments about harden being bad in the playoffs are entirely based on specific bad games he’s had? Games that literally every star has had. Lebron scored 11 points in a finals game ffs. Like jimmy butler is the exact opposite, he’ll have one incredible game and then average like 15 for the rest of the series and you guys act like he’s mj in the playoffs. He’s probably had more awful playoff games and series than any other star, unless you count Russ obviously, which I don’t because he’s had maybe one season in his career where you could argue he was a net positive.</p>

<p>Just as an aside I can’t believe people still think Westbrook was anywhere near an mvp caliber player. As far back as 2012 the thunder absolutely tore through the west in the playoffs with kd, harden, and russ, to the point where they were favorites in the finals. Then the heat came up with the perfect strategy to defend Russ in the playoffs (ie dont) and won pretty easily with Russ taking more shots than kd on like half the ts% with barely anyone guarding him. The heat admitted their entire defensive strategy was to shut down harden and get the ball out of his hands (so Russ would have it). The thunder never came close to the level they were that year (they absolutely obliterated the west) despite them all being like 22.</p>

<p>I don’t see how you’re a superstar when you’ve never even come close to making it out of the first round as the first option, and every year you were the second option your team would’ve been so much better off with just an average starting pg who wasn’t going to do their best Kobe impression while missing every shot.</p>

<p>Also what basketball skills has Russ ever been elite at? There really aren’t any, in his prime offensively he was basically just a shorter Ben Simmons with the complete opposite mindset. He was athletic enough to explode to the rim, but even in his prime he was never good at actually finishing at the rim. People bring up the turnovers but don’t understand it’s not just that, Russ actively wastes half your offensive possessions every time he’s on the floor by taking the most shots on the team on like low 30s ts%, which is effectively a shitload of Russ turnovers that don’t show up on the stat sheet. His highest ts% in the playoffs for a season by far was 54% ts, outside of that you were lucky if he broke 50% for a couple years and then has just been in the 40s and 30s the rest of his career.</p>

<p>Because any actual objective argument would show him as an all time great playoff performer, and you guys will bend over backwards to not face reality on that.</p>

<p>The 2015 (and 2020) Rockets is when Harden performed great carry jobs in the playoffs, but that&rsquo;s also when he had one of his biggest elimination game meltdowns. I don&rsquo;t hold it against him, but if we start comparing to Lebron there are so many levels in between their carry jobs.</p>

      <label for="le3jfp5" class="commentText"><p>Watch the game again. When you can count 9-10 possessions that were blatant ref blunders in favor of the Warriors and they still lost by two possessions?</p>

<p>In regards to missing the threes, again, the Warriors were allowed to put their feet under rockets shooters. They were allowed to play into them as much as they wanted. Harden had a brilliant strategy of reversing his step back (that everyone was training to defend) and made it into a jump “forward” to draw a foul…not a single one was called. But the Warriors got ticky-tack fouls all game. Did you see the Eric Gordon layup where he was literally tackled and his arms were held against his body and they still refused to call the foul?</p>

<p>Two possessions homie.</p>

<p>While often labelled as a playoff under-performer, he also averaged 31/7/6 on 60% TS in the playoffs during this span.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you state shit like this, you completely miss why Harden  was labeled as a playoff underperformer.</p>

<p>He has always been a volatile player come playoff time. Dominant highs and pathetic lows.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s still the only superstar I&rsquo;ve ever seen that got benched in a 4th quarter of an elimination game. He has many, many big chokes in key moments that stand out in his career. And unfortunately for him, his low points outshine his high points.</p>

<p>Harden is a generational offensive talent, but his incompetent and low-effort defense, and numerous low points in his playoff career tarnish what should be considered as one of the legendary careers of the modern game.</p>

<p>And frankly, he&rsquo;s changed his game in his twilight after losing his speed/athleticism to continue being an effective point guard (unlike Russ, whose career predictably fell of a cliff after his athleticism waned).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really too bad that he never won a ring (and likely won&rsquo;t). He&rsquo;s been an amazing player, though I always disliked his style of play on offense (constantly foul baiting, step back 3s with flailing legs). But his passing was on the level of the greats.</p>

      <label for="le0m9oh" class="commentText"><p>His volatility like always came because of fatigue later in series though. It&rsquo;s painfully obvious when you look at it objectively. He rarely ever had anywhere near the rosters as the teams he would lose to early in his career.</p>

<p>He would carry his team to like +10 more wins than their projection and get them deeper than expected and then be gassed because he was doing so much 1v5ing.</p>

<p>Even when he had a disastrous game in the playoffs like in the WCF in 2015, it would come like right after an insane performance where he had to use everything in the tank.</p>

<p>Nobody he went against was carrying rosters like he was</p>

      <label for="le0u8pt" class="commentText"><p>Yeah his usage was insanely high, a lot of iso, and a lot of dribbling. Of course you can argue it’s his fault for having such a draining playstyle but when you look at like game 6 and 7 against the warriors I think it’s unfair to blame him for those loses. He played great in the first half of both but clearly ran out of gas in the second half of both games, which isn’t shocking when your sole costar gets injured and you’re expected to carry the offensive burden against a team like golden state.</p>

<p>Still almost won game 7 despite no cp, all around shit performance and horrible reffing. Think that was a series that if they were healthy they definitely would’ve won, and would’ve won the finals which would’ve been massive for hardens legacy. I mean he still choked a number of times but having a ring one against that warriors team no less would’ve made his greatness undeniable.</p>

<p>Bro what are people saying all this dumb shit for. Obviously if a roster is significantly worse than their opponents you can&rsquo;t just &ldquo;GET THE OTHERS INVOLVED&rdquo; your way to a win. Harden is absolutely known for getting shitty players bags because of how good he made them look</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean they can beat teams significantly better built than them. Go look at some of those rosters man.</p>

      <label for="le1ee0n" class="commentText"><p>I think you are grossly overrating how great Smith and Brewer were playing and grossly underrating just how dogshit Harden was. They didn&rsquo;t just all of a sudden drop 40 burgers out of nowhere; they had 19 pts each on <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub> and <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub> shooting &hellip;.</p>

<p>Difference was that they were exerting effort on defense and playing team basketball.</p>

<p>Coaches don&rsquo;t bench superstars and blame it on role players playing better.</p>

<p>He got benched because he was shitting the bed in the biggest game of the season, and McHale went to other players to try and win the game.</p>

      <label for="le4azex" class="commentText"><p>He got handed a shitty rockets team at 23 years old. No player since young lebron has had to hard carry as much, and every other star has had bad playoff games, especially at that age.</p>

<p>This leads more to my point though, every single argument about harden being bad in the playoffs is entirely based on specific games, and people just move the goalposts every time. Like you’re literally shitting on him for winning a playoff game lol.</p>

<p>Meanwhile jimmy butler can have countless horrific playoff games or entire series and literally all people remember the one amazing game he had, not him averaging like 15 ppg the rest of the series.</p>

<p>The only reason harden ever had the opportunity to “choke” is because he was good enough to hard carry shitty teams into big playoff series against way better rosters. It’s like the people who use Lebron losing in a finals a knock, as if it would be better to lose earlier.</p>

<p>Like lillard is considered clutch basically because he made one shot, then never had the opportunity to “choke” because he would just lose in the first round or get absolutely spanked the first time he went up against a good team</p>

      <label for="le1x7za" class="commentText"><p>But you also have to factor in that Giannis was also an elite offensive player and Harden was a bad defender.</p>

<p>Of course that could still mean that Harden was the better player, because as you said, individual offense is more valuable than individual defense, but framing it as purely &ldquo;offensive player vs defensive player&rdquo; is dismissive of Giannis&rsquo; two-way ability.</p>

      <label for="le1am8t" class="commentText"><p>THAT’S my exact beef with the Harden hate. People never expected him to do shit. Then hold it against him when he doesn’t. He always overachieved general expectations.. People don’t even talk about 2014 year when Ariza was the 2nd best player on the team and he someone got them in the playoffs. In fact it was an indictment at the time. Every year Harden would destroy win projections. No one even thought the CP/Harden pairing would work.</p>

<p>I will admit, in the playoffs Harden would fall out of the top 5 as a SCORER. The way he carried the team though as an elite playmaker was truly.. only LeBron does that shit. But yeah I always felt if Harden just had one closer with him In his prime, he would win it all. But still, the way he controlled games was so underrated man.</p>

<p>2018</p>

<p>2019</p>

<p>2021.</p>

<p>I really feel like he just got extremely unlucky those years. Those years were his. It takes luck too, all the people who know their shit say it.</p>

Like yes on the one hand the counting stats and efficiency dropped (which to be fair it&rsquo;s also unreasonable to expect someone to maintain his otherworldly regular season numbers in a playoff setting) but he always to me seemed to disappear in moments rather than runs. The unlucky aspect of that I feel like his stinkers also pretty much always coincided with losses - especially crucial losses, so he&rsquo;ll forever be remembered unfavorably as a result.</p>

      <label for="le1i197" class="commentText"><p>Well, he also has more total All-NBA selections, All-Defensive selections, more All-Star appearances, more championships, and didn’t shit the bed in the big stage. Also just using the eye test and no stats involved, Wade was clearly the better defender than Harden, and offensively he has a higher career FG% than him. Don’t get me wrong Harden is a top 5 shooting guard of all time, but I wouldn’t put him over Wade</p>

<p>Honestly I think all of these are irrelevant given his TS% was well above league average. Saying he took x number of shots but &ldquo;under&rdquo; a percentage seems to be making the argument that he was inefficient.</p>

<p>The point on turnovers is fair though</p>

<p>Harden carried tons of bums. Those rockets players he played with werent good at all. Lou will his costar. Injured dwight. Injured cp3. Then guys with no offensive talent like tucker capela ariza pbev lol. Random 3 and d guys who werent nba lvl.  He hard carried like no one tbh.</p>

<p>Even on the nets he hard carried them to a top seed while kd missed the entire season. The cast around harden and kyrie were bums but harden elevated bums like no one else. Its why those bums sucked ass once harden got hurt the bucks series</p>

<p>The next year Capella got injured and was essentially never the same, Luc left and their old wings got even older. Oh yeah, CP3 regressed heavily that following year too, to the point where people consider the OKC stint later revitalized his career.</p>

<p>Harden didn&rsquo;t win MVP in 2015 despite his insane season but <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/13298307/james-harden-named-mvp-nbpa-first-annual-players-awards" target="_blank">he won the first ever MVP decided by players only</a>, the players in the league knew Harden was carrying his team more than Steph, must have been at least a little bit of consolation for Harden to know the guys he played against thought he was MVP</p>

      <label for="le2aaqr" class="commentText"><p>They always used to favor the best team for MVP, that only changed with the Westbrook MVP and since. But 2015 Steph beat out Harden in most advanced stats while also having comparable per-36 counting stats (remember, the 14-15 Warriors were blowing teams out with regularity, Steph sat a lot of 4th quarters and only played 32 mpg vs Harden’s nearly 37. It’s not like Harden got snubbed.</p>

<p>He should have won over Westbrook in my opinion, though. Better record, similar stats on better efficiency, largely outperformed preseason expectations with a surrounding cast that wasn’t much better than what Russ had.</p>

<p>Also, when talking about player-voted MVP, you have to realize a lot of players back then did not think Steph was all that, including Harden himself (“they ain’t even that good”). Nowadays he gets his flowers but back then, especially before 2015–16, players didn’t respect him as much as great players with more traditional playstyles.</p>

Harden, Westbrook in his prime, Luka - they all have amazing individual stats, MVPs (Luka will get one soon I’m sure), and top tier recognition, but their style of play will not win a championship.  So while everyone praises them constantly when they’re pumping out wild stats, I personally would not want any of them on my team because I want my team to win championships.  Otherwise, what are we fans for?  To watch a player get an individual award and make tons of money?  That’s just stanning a player who will never win the actual prize they’re supposed to be playing for.</p>

      <label for="le17xr0" class="commentText"><p>2018-19 Harden wasn’t super entertaining but it was insane as a basketball experiment. Common sense says no player should be able to take that big an offensive workload without their efficiency declining, but he just stayed right around that .620 mark. I really wonder what it would have looked like if the Rockets just leaned <em>even more</em> into the heliocentricism and just tried to fill out the rest of the roster with guys who were only there for defense.</p>

      <label for="le42wxn" class="commentText"><p>To me Harden is the perfect example of floor vs ceiling raiser. He might be one of the best floor raisers ever right up there with Lebron but his inability to play solid defense, heliocentric offensive style, and volatile playoff performance constantly let him down even when he was on better teams.</p>

      <label for="le45sw9" class="commentText"><p>my favorite aspect of all the harden-glazing is that they all act like the defensive, leadership, and clutch aspects of basketball don&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p>giannis won a championship in large part due to his defensive talents and being a monster on both sides of the court. harden has never been the best player on the court in a single post season series he&rsquo;s been involved in.</p>

<p>another way to say the &ldquo;wild harden didn&rsquo;t win more mvps&rdquo; nonsense is this: it&rsquo;s downright kind of the voters to give an mvp award to harden while curry, lebron and giannis played</p>
