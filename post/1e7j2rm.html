      <p>James Harden in the two seasons from 18-19 and 19-20 averaged 35/7/8 across 146 games. He led the league in winshares during the span with 28.3.</p>

<p>While often labelled as a playoff under-performer, he also averaged 31/7/6 on 60% TS in the playoffs during this span.</p>

<p>His peak was truly remarkable and it&rsquo;s a shame he only won a single MVP during his offensive prime.</p>

<p>Just to put things in perspective, Giannis who won two MVPs averaged 28/13/6 on 63% TS in the regular season during that span and 26/13/5 in the playoffs on 58% TS.</p>

<p>Theres a reason he isnt (currently) remembered as a historic player despite the historic box scores. Deserved or not hes THE poster child for foul baiting</p>

<p>The sentiment will fade over time but starting ~2015 the Harden rockets were one of, if not the first team to truly commit to 3 pts &amp; drawing fouls as an offense, completely dropping the mid range and ushering in a new era to the NBA</p>

<p>2015 benched vs clippers, and had a miserable final game with like 13 turnovers and like 11 points</p>

<p>2018 idk why he gets credit for this, it&rsquo;s no shame losing to the warriors, but he was awful in that series</p>

<p>i feel bad for him because he did seem to get more comfortable after that, was great in 2019, good in 2020, and looked great in 2021 before the hamstring</p>

</blockquote>

<p>When you state shit like this, you completely miss why Harden  was labeled as a playoff underperformer.</p>

<p>He has always been a volatile player come playoff time. Dominant highs and pathetic lows.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s still the only superstar I&rsquo;ve ever seen that got benched in a 4th quarter of an elimination game. He has many, many big chokes in key moments that stand out in his career. And unfortunately for him, his low points outshine his high points.</p>

<p>Harden is a generational offensive talent, but his incompetent and low-effort defense, and numerous low points in his playoff career tarnish what should be considered as one of the legendary careers of the modern game.</p>

<p>And frankly, he&rsquo;s changed his game in his twilight after losing his speed/athleticism to continue being an effective point guard (unlike Russ, whose career predictably fell of a cliff after his athleticism waned).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really too bad that he never won a ring (and likely won&rsquo;t). He&rsquo;s been an amazing player, though I always disliked his style of play on offense (constantly foul baiting, step back 3s with flailing legs). But his passing was on the level of the greats.</p>

<p>He would carry his team to like +10 more wins than their projection and get them deeper than expected and then be gassed because he was doing so much 1v5ing.</p>

<p>Even when he had a disastrous game in the playoffs like in the WCF in 2015, it would come like right after an insane performance where he had to use everything in the tank.</p>

      <label for="le0mcxq" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t doubt he&rsquo;s an underperformer compared to his very high levels. Not to mention, he either went nuclear or went cold. It&rsquo;s just putting things in perspective that even while &ldquo;underperforming&rdquo;, he was still putting up insane numbers.</p>

      <label for="le0p5f1" class="commentText"><p>Robbed in 2016-2017, had win against a game 7 Scott Foster in 2018, robbed by Giannis because except prime Lebron/Jordan no one would be able to carry those Rockets team to where they finished in 2019. Poster boy of the moving the goalpost when he comes to him.</p>

<p>Being labeled as a player choker because he always overperformed in regular season and didn’t win series as an underdog while he carried teams that were never ever supposed to finish where they ended and always had an injury or one of his important teammates  injured during all his playoff runs.</p>

      <label for="le0qq8w" class="commentText"><p>Don&rsquo;t be fooled by extreme heliocentrism. Guys like Harden and Luka who monopolize the offense and do literally nothing off-ball or on defense are not as good as their stats. They&rsquo;re still all-time greats, obviously, but their productivity needs to be understood in the proper context.</p>

      <label for="le0pbek" class="commentText"><p>People seem to have a really hard time calculating Harden&rsquo;s playoff numbers because they never remember to adjust his time as a 6th man Lol</p>

<p>When you tell people that from his first playoff game as a rocket through til the Bucks injury he averaged 28/7/8 on 59% TS and it barely changes in elimination games people all of a sudden are all surprised.</p>
