      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1e7j2rm/james_harden_averaged_3578_on_62_true_shooting/"><p>James Harden averaged 35/7/8 on 62% true shooting through 2018-19 and 2019-20 seasons.  He also led the league in winshares (28.3) during that span with Giannis trailing behind (25.5).</p>

      <p>James Harden in the two seasons from 18-19 and 19-20 averaged 35/7/8 across 146 games. He led the league in winshares during the span with 28.3.</p>

<p>While often labelled as a playoff under-performer, he also averaged 31/7/6 on 60% TS in the playoffs during this span.</p>

<p>His peak was truly remarkable and it&rsquo;s a shame he only won a single MVP during his offensive prime.</p>

<p>Just to put things in perspective, Giannis who won two MVPs averaged 28/13/6 on 63% TS in the regular season during that span and 26/13/5 in the playoffs on 58% TS.</p>

<p>Theres a reason he isnt (currently) remembered as a historic player despite the historic box scores. Deserved or not hes THE poster child for foul baiting</p>

<p>The sentiment will fade over time but starting ~2015 the Harden rockets were one of, if not the first team to truly commit to 3 pts &amp; drawing fouls as an offense, completely dropping the mid range and ushering in a new era to the NBA</p>

      <label for="le1105x" class="commentText"><p>If you consider Harden&rsquo;s entire Houston run to be his peak/prime, 13.69% of his total FGA during that time came from between 10FT-3PT, and he shot .397 on those attempts.</p>

<p>In his Thunder days, 14.91% of his total FGA came in that range, and he coincidentally also shot .397 on those attempts.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s really never been more than a decent mid-range shooter, so his de-emphasis of those shots does make sense.</p>

<p>Also.. He&rsquo;s taking more 3s than Jaylen while having better %, while averaging like 6 more assists. While Tatum is only taking 1 more shot than Harden at worse %, and having significantly fewer assisits.</p>

<p>By your own assessment, Brown &amp; Tatum  are ass shooters who needs to be passing more.</p>

<p>Shooting at that rate won’t even match the top five teams in the league. And in the playoffs when D tightens up and whistles don’t come as easy, you’re in trouble. Harden was not a fluid enough player to adapt his games in those situations, he was just a moving algorithm.</p>

He’s made 378 threes in a season, the only person to ever come close to Steph’s 400 threes season.

      <label for="le0x0wy" class="commentText"><p>If KD wasn’t a bitch that joined Golden State people would probably be discussing Harden in a much different tone. And even then, it took the Rockets  missing 27 straight three pointers on top of that to keep him from making the finals. One of the craziest things I’ve ever seen in the nba</p>

He became a better scorer than kd while also being an all time great floor general. Outside of joining a 73 win team to get a ring if you actually look at those years harden managed to squeeze in just as many accolades as kd has had his entire career, if not more, into just those seasons.</p>

      <label for="le1cbon" class="commentText"><p>Anyone who actually watched basketball when he was in Houston remembers him as a historic player lol. Also a lot of his foul baiting is way overblown, he did foul bait on the perimeter but it’s not like he was tricking the refs, they were fouls, defenders just had no idea how to guard him. Like teams would have a defender behind him while help shaded over to stop his drive because they were so afraid of his stepback, plus being able to blow by anyone to the rim. A huge portion of his fts were just because he was built like a 6’5 linebacker playing pg and had an insane amount of drives.</p>

<p>Embiid, Giannis, dwade, butler, etc were/are just as bad if not worse with the foul baiting. They literally changed the rules because of KDs rip through move.</p>

<p>And this is with facing insane bias against him from the voters, like not making a single all nba team in 2016 while averaging like 28/6/8, or coming in second in mvp in 2017 and 2019 when he obviously should have won.</p>

<p>awful vs portland in 2014, 4th best player in that series</p>

<p>2015 benched vs clippers, and had a miserable final game with like 13 turnovers and like 11 points</p>

<p>2016 he was ok vs warriors with no steph</p>

<p>2017 another <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub></p>

<p>2018 idk why he gets credit for this, it&rsquo;s no shame losing to the warriors, but he was awful in that series</p>

<p>i feel bad for him because he did seem to get more comfortable after that, was great in 2019, good in 2020, and looked great in 2021 before the hamstring</p>

Harden&rsquo;s stinkers notwithstanding, there were notable holes in that roster that &ldquo;Moreyball&rdquo; just wasn&rsquo;t going to fix. Just look at Tatum&rsquo;s postseason run this year. The splits were ugly, but he had the personnel to shift to a playmaking role and let his team pitch in.</p>

<p>I bet Harden&rsquo;s career is talked about differently if those rosters are more rounded out. I&rsquo;m not a Harden guy, but it&rsquo;s hard to deny what  force he was offensively, even with all of his notable flaws as a player.</p>

      <label for="le18ow6" class="commentText"><p>65 wins in the regular season doesn&rsquo;t guarantee a title. The game is played completely differently in the playoffs, and that team showed wildly inconsistent effort throughout the year. They were by no means perfect. Their defensive rating was ranked 26th pre-ASB.</p>

<p>They were optimized to play fast paced offense around Harden, built to generate open looks from 3. Chris Paul was an effective counterweight to that as a floor general who had an in-between game, but could also fit into D&rsquo;Antoni&rsquo;s offensive scheme at large. Once he went out and was limited, the Rockets became incredibly predictable, and Harden played like shit, to make matters worse. Gordon, Tucker, and Ariza choked. Big time.</p>

<p>How is this hard to understand, let alone be ridiculed? Everyone knew that Rockets team was top heavy. Morey trading for Iman Shumpert mid-season wasn&rsquo;t giving them necessary depth in the playoffs. Something the Warriors had in spades, which allowed them to overcome KD&rsquo;s injury issues.</p>

<p>he just wasn&rsquo;t that in the playoffs, and i guess people feel bad for him now for some reason so it&rsquo;s become a thing to say well he just always lost to the warriors and no one else and actually he was pretty good in the playoffs!</p>

<p>but every one at the time was not saying that</p>

<p>2019-2021, it felt like he was his rs more in the playoffs, but unfortunately he got injured and was never the same</p>

<p>but 2013-19, he was just not close to his rs self</p>

      <label for="le0upku" class="commentText"><p>Yep. My argument is more that heliocentric star players sometimes play abysmally in the playoffs. If Tatum didn&rsquo;t win the chip this year, you best believe this sub would be filled with his shooting splits and mocking him as a choker. There&rsquo;s a very thin line in NBA discourse.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to win a championship, and it requires a well-built team to do it. Morey was very arrogant for thinking Harden could work as his own system.</p>

<p>Unrelated, but I was privileged enough to have courtside seats to watch Harden play during the 18-19 season. Easily the best basketball player (offensively) I have ever seen. Crazy how much can change in just a few years.</p>

      <label for="le16w2k" class="commentText"><p>I completely and totally agree. If the Celtics lost, however, the nuance of that argument would be completely lost in NBA discourse. His shooting splits would be brought up relentlessly, and the narrative of the Celtics &ldquo;choking&rdquo; would be revived. The narrative would be completely different.</p>

<p>Similarly, if Harden won, you&rsquo;d hear a lot about his savant-like passing carrying his team during his bad shooting nights. The reputations of these guys are often carried by team success.</p>

      <label for="le1dgmt" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re making a point that&rsquo;s different from what I&rsquo;m already saying. Do you think the Celtics would have sustained Tatum&rsquo;s poor shooting if not for the contributions of his supporting cast? Yeah, he passed the ball well. He was also a huge beneficiary of how essentially every Celtics starter could hit 3s AND attack late closeouts off the dribble. It&rsquo;s a testament to the acquisitions Stevens has made over the years. Something Morey failed to do by vaguely groping at &ldquo;star power&rdquo; (Westbrook, CP3, Howard), which objectively did not work. Some of the fits between Harden&rsquo;s co-stars didn&rsquo;t even make sense. The Celtics fit seamlessly with one another.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m not even a Harden apologist lol</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t care that he lost to the warriors, but he was not good, and it&rsquo;s not unfair to hold that against him</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t hold 2019 vs warriors against him, because he was tremendous</p>

<p>his shooting splits were bad in 2018 against GSW but he was still the best player on the Warriors and was entirely responsible for how the Rockets were able to field the switchable defenders they did. it&rsquo;s like egregious silly to think roleplayers took the Warriors 7 lol</p>

<p>you&rsquo;re like using shooting splits from single games to invalidate what he had to carry all season and post season long. It&rsquo;s weird.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re exaggerating the frequency of bad performances and completely skipping over the good ones. He had bad performances ofc.

<p>Look how bad the 76ers were without Embid last year - they were at bottom-5 team. The year before with Harden and no Embid they were like 14-8</p>

<p>While often labelled as a playoff under-performer, he also averaged 31/7/6 on 60% TS in the playoffs during this span.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you state shit like this, you completely miss why Harden  was labeled as a playoff underperformer.</p>

<p>He has always been a volatile player come playoff time. Dominant highs and pathetic lows.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s still the only superstar I&rsquo;ve ever seen that got benched in a 4th quarter of an elimination game. He has many, many big chokes in key moments that stand out in his career. And unfortunately for him, his low points outshine his high points.</p>

<p>Harden is a generational offensive talent, but his incompetent and low-effort defense, and numerous low points in his playoff career tarnish what should be considered as one of the legendary careers of the modern game.</p>

<p>And frankly, he&rsquo;s changed his game in his twilight after losing his speed/athleticism to continue being an effective point guard (unlike Russ, whose career predictably fell of a cliff after his athleticism waned).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really too bad that he never won a ring (and likely won&rsquo;t). He&rsquo;s been an amazing player, though I always disliked his style of play on offense (constantly foul baiting, step back 3s with flailing legs). But his passing was on the level of the greats.</p>

      <label for="le0m9oh" class="commentText"><p>His volatility like always came because of fatigue later in series though. It&rsquo;s painfully obvious when you look at it objectively. He rarely ever had anywhere near the rosters as the teams he would lose to early in his career.</p>

<p>He would carry his team to like +10 more wins than their projection and get them deeper than expected and then be gassed because he was doing so much 1v5ing.</p>

<p>Even when he had a disastrous game in the playoffs like in the WCF in 2015, it would come like right after an insane performance where he had to use everything in the tank.</p>

<p>Nobody he went against was carrying rosters like he was</p>

      <label for="le0u8pt" class="commentText"><p>Yeah his usage was insanely high, a lot of iso, and a lot of dribbling. Of course you can argue it’s his fault for having such a draining playstyle but when you look at like game 6 and 7 against the warriors I think it’s unfair to blame him for those loses. He played great in the first half of both but clearly ran out of gas in the second half of both games, which isn’t shocking when your sole costar gets injured and you’re expected to carry the offensive burden against a team like golden state.</p>

<p>Still almost won game 7 despite no cp, all around shit performance and horrible reffing. Think that was a series that if they were healthy they definitely would’ve won, and would’ve won the finals which would’ve been massive for hardens legacy. I mean he still choked a number of times but having a ring one against that warriors team no less would’ve made his greatness undeniable.</p>

<p>Bro what are people saying all this dumb shit for. Obviously if a roster is significantly worse than their opponents you can&rsquo;t just &ldquo;GET THE OTHERS INVOLVED&rdquo; your way to a win. Harden is absolutely known for getting shitty players bags because of how good he made them look</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean they can beat teams significantly better built than them. Go look at some of those rosters man.</p>

<p>Harden was <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> from the field, playing zero defense and was a -21 in 3 quarters. i.e. he was baked ass cheeks.</p>

<p>And hell, Josh Smith later came out and said he thinks McHale got fired early next season because of this benching. And that Rockets FO told McHale to put Harden back in and McHale refused.</p>

      <label for="le1am8t" class="commentText"><p>THAT’S my exact beef with the Harden hate. People never expected him to do shit. Then hold it against him when he doesn’t. He always overachieved general expectations.. People don’t even talk about 2014 year when Ariza was the 2nd best player on the team and he someone got them in the playoffs. In fact it was an indictment at the time. Every year Harden would destroy win projections. No one even thought the CP/Harden pairing would work.</p>

<p>I will admit, in the playoffs Harden would fall out of the top 5 as a SCORER. The way he carried the team though as an elite playmaker was truly.. only LeBron does that shit. But yeah I always felt if Harden just had one closer with him In his prime, he would win it all. But still, the way he controlled games was so underrated man.</p>

<p>2018</p>

<p>2019</p>

<p>2021.</p>

<p>I really feel like he just got extremely unlucky those years. Those years were his. It takes luck too, all the people who know their shit say it.</p>

      <label for="le0v8zc" class="commentText"><p>Harden and kawhi for a bit eere the only guys to put fear into kd warriors. Harden shouldve won 2018. Its kinda sad warriors with that talent needed 7 games and for g7 to have been terrible reffing. Harden gor robbed of 2019 mvp as well.</p>

<p>Harden carried tons of bums. Those rockets players he played with werent good at all. Lou will his costar. Injured dwight. Injured cp3. Then guys with no offensive talent like tucker capela ariza pbev lol. Random 3 and d guys who werent nba lvl.  He hard carried like no one tbh.</p>

<p>Even on the nets he hard carried them to a top seed while kd missed the entire season. The cast around harden and kyrie were bums but harden elevated bums like no one else. Its why those bums sucked ass once harden got hurt the bucks series</p>

      <label for="le1c7ei" class="commentText"><p>Only the 2018 team was a threat; Capella was a monster at the rim pre-injury and before he got his deal done, and that team theoretically had enough capable wings (Ariza, Luc, Tucker) to anchor the defensive scheme.</p>

<p>The next year Capella got injured and was essentially never the same, Luc left and their old wings got even older. Oh yeah, CP3 regressed heavily that following year too, to the point where people consider the OKC stint later revitalized his career.</p>

      <label for="le17xr0" class="commentText"><p>2018-19 Harden wasn’t super entertaining but it was insane as a basketball experiment. Common sense says no player should be able to take that big an offensive workload without their efficiency declining, but he just stayed right around that .620 mark. I really wonder what it would have looked like if the Rockets just leaned <em>even more</em> into the heliocentricism and just tried to fill out the rest of the roster with guys who were only there for defense.</p>
