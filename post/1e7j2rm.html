      <p>James Harden in the two seasons from 18-19 and 19-20 averaged 35/7/8 across 146 games. He led the league in winshares during the span with 28.3.</p>

<p>While often labelled as a playoff under-performer, he also averaged 31/7/6 on 60% TS in the playoffs during this span.</p>

<p>His peak was truly remarkable and it&rsquo;s a shame he only won a single MVP during his offensive prime.</p>

<p>Just to put things in perspective, Giannis who won two MVPs averaged 28/13/6 on 63% TS in the regular season during that span and 26/13/5 in the playoffs on 58% TS.</p>

<p>Theres a reason he isnt (currently) remembered as a historic player despite the historic box scores. Deserved or not hes THE poster child for foul baiting</p>

<p>The sentiment will fade over time but starting ~2015 the Harden rockets were one of, if not the first team to truly commit to 3 pts &amp; drawing fouls as an offense, completely dropping the mid range and ushering in a new era to the NBA</p>

      <label for="le1105x" class="commentText"><p>If you consider Harden&rsquo;s entire Houston run to be his peak/prime, 13.69% of his total FGA during that time came from between 10FT-3PT, and he shot .397 on those attempts.</p>

<p>In his Thunder days, 14.91% of his total FGA came in that range, and he coincidentally also shot .397 on those attempts.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s really never been more than a decent mid-range shooter, so his de-emphasis of those shots does make sense.</p>

<p>he was awful vs russ less okc in 2013</p>

<p>awful vs portland in 2014, 4th best player in that series</p>

<p>2015 benched vs clippers, and had a miserable final game with like 13 turnovers and like 11 points</p>

<p>2016 he was ok vs warriors with no steph</p>

<p>2017 another <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub></p>

<p>2018 idk why he gets credit for this, it&rsquo;s no shame losing to the warriors, but he was awful in that series</p>

<p>i feel bad for him because he did seem to get more comfortable after that, was great in 2019, good in 2020, and looked great in 2021 before the hamstring</p>

<p>but this retelling of his career is just untrue</p>

      <label for="le0ta4k" class="commentText"><p>They needed a secondary POA defender who was elite on the wing. Harden&rsquo;s stinkers notwithstanding, there were notable holes in that roster that &ldquo;Moreyball&rdquo; just wasn&rsquo;t going to fix. Just look at Tatum&rsquo;s postseason run this year. The splits were ugly, but he had the personnel to shift to a playmaking role and let his team pitch in.</p>

<p>I bet Harden&rsquo;s career is talked about differently if those rosters are more rounded out. I&rsquo;m not a Harden guy, but it&rsquo;s hard to deny what  force he was offensively, even with all of his notable flaws as a player.</p>

<p>he just wasn&rsquo;t that in the playoffs, and i guess people feel bad for him now for some reason so it&rsquo;s become a thing to say well he just always lost to the warriors and no one else and actually he was pretty good in the playoffs!</p>

<p>but every one at the time was not saying that</p>

<p>2019-2021, it felt like he was his rs more in the playoffs, but unfortunately he got injured and was never the same</p>

<p>but 2013-19, he was just not close to his rs self</p>

      <label for="le0upku" class="commentText"><p>Yep. My argument is more that heliocentric star players sometimes play abysmally in the playoffs. If Tatum didn&rsquo;t win the chip this year, you best believe this sub would be filled with his shooting splits and mocking him as a choker. There&rsquo;s a very thin line in NBA discourse.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to win a championship, and it requires a well-built team to do it. Morey was very arrogant for thinking Harden could work as his own system.</p>

<p>Unrelated, but I was privileged enough to have courtside seats to watch Harden play during the 18-19 season. Easily the best basketball player (offensively) I have ever seen. Crazy how much can change in just a few years.</p>

      <label for="le0vhao" class="commentText"><p>i&rsquo;d like to compare the solo stars to Harden, because i&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s accurate, the example rn is Luka, who&rsquo;s like 30/10/10 in the playoffs, this was his bad playoffs and everyone watched it and was still like yeah it wasn&rsquo;t amazing but it was alright, and that&rsquo;s his worse playoffs so far</p>

      <label for="le0wstd" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think it’s fair to say he was awful in the series. He still went 29/6/6 on 54%TS (around average for playoffs) which isn’t great but still is very good. Just happens that he didn’t score 36 of like he does in the regular season. If someone like Brunson averaged those numbers we would say it was a good series from him.</p>

<p>he had one great game to start the series</p>

<p>his last 6 games in that series he was 27/6/6 on <sup>39</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> splits, and he averaged like 6 turnovers a game</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t care that he lost to the warriors, but he was not good, and it&rsquo;s not unfair to hold that against him</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t hold 2019 vs warriors against him, because he was tremendous</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t hold luka losing to the clippers back to back years against him, because he was great</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t hold giannis losing to the celtics against him, he was great</p>

<p>you know how nobody ever brings up how bad Tatum was in like game 5 against the 76ers? It&rsquo;s cuz he closed out game 7. What are we doing.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re just over emphasizing bad performances for Harden that you don&rsquo;t also over emphasize for the guys he&rsquo;s compared to. Be more objective.</p>

<p>his shooting splits were bad in 2018 against GSW but he was still the best player on the Warriors and was entirely responsible for how the Rockets were able to field the switchable defenders they did. it&rsquo;s like egregious silly to think roleplayers took the Warriors 7 lol</p>

<p>you&rsquo;re like using shooting splits from single games to invalidate what he had to carry all season and post season long. It&rsquo;s weird.</p>

<p>everyone at the time was saying this cause we all watched it</p>

<p>he was not a good playoff performer from 2013-2019, sure he had a couple games here and there, but he clearly was not close to his dominant RS self</p>

<p>2019-2021, he was pretty close to it, but got injured</p>

<p>there&rsquo;s no shame in losing to the warriors, but he was awful in 2018</p>

<p>in 2019? he was FANTASTIC it&rsquo;s why no one ever criticizes him for it</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re calling a guy who averaged 28/7/8 on 59% TS in that stretch you&rsquo;re talking about &ldquo;not a good playoff performer&rdquo;</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re exaggerating the frequency of bad performances and completely skipping over the good ones. He had bad performances ofc. But almost always because of fatigue after a massive carryjob cuz he never had help until 2018, where he was the best player on a team that took the greatest team of all time 7 games.</p>

<p>While often labelled as a playoff under-performer, he also averaged 31/7/6 on 60% TS in the playoffs during this span.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you state shit like this, you completely miss why Harden  was labeled as a playoff underperformer.</p>

<p>He has always been a volatile player come playoff time. Dominant highs and pathetic lows.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s still the only superstar I&rsquo;ve ever seen that got benched in a 4th quarter of an elimination game. He has many, many big chokes in key moments that stand out in his career. And unfortunately for him, his low points outshine his high points.</p>

<p>Harden is a generational offensive talent, but his incompetent and low-effort defense, and numerous low points in his playoff career tarnish what should be considered as one of the legendary careers of the modern game.</p>

<p>And frankly, he&rsquo;s changed his game in his twilight after losing his speed/athleticism to continue being an effective point guard (unlike Russ, whose career predictably fell of a cliff after his athleticism waned).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really too bad that he never won a ring (and likely won&rsquo;t). He&rsquo;s been an amazing player, though I always disliked his style of play on offense (constantly foul baiting, step back 3s with flailing legs). But his passing was on the level of the greats.</p>

<p>He would carry his team to like +10 more wins than their projection and get them deeper than expected and then be gassed because he was doing so much 1v5ing.</p>

<p>Even when he had a disastrous game in the playoffs like in the WCF in 2015, it would come like right after an insane performance where he had to use everything in the tank.</p>

Of course you can argue it’s his fault for having such a draining playstyle but when you look at like game 6 and 7 against the warriors I think it’s unfair to blame him for those loses. He played great in the first half of both but clearly ran out of gas in the second half of both games, which isn’t shocking when your sole costar gets injured and you’re expected to carry the offensive burden against a team like golden state.</p>

<p>Still almost won game 7 despite no cp, all around shit performance and horrible reffing. Think that was a series that if they were healthy they definitely would’ve won, and would’ve won the finals which would’ve been massive for hardens legacy. I mean he still choked a number of times but having a ring one against that warriors team no less would’ve made his greatness undeniable.</p>

<p>Plenty of players don&rsquo;t do that. You build your strategy around what your players are good at - not forcing them to do shit that won&rsquo;t be as good to appease weirdo fans</p>

<p>Harden was a generationally talented on ball creator. On what planet are you wanting him to cut to the hoop lmao</p>

<p>Harden carried tons of bums. Those rockets players he played with werent good at all. Lou will his costar. Injured dwight. Injured cp3. Then guys with no offensive talent like tucker capela ariza pbev lol. Random 3 and d guys who werent nba lvl.  He hard carried like no one tbh.</p>

<p>Even on the nets he hard carried them to a top seed while kd missed the entire season. The cast around harden and kyrie were bums but harden elevated bums like no one else. Its why those bums sucked ass once harden got hurt the bucks series</p>
