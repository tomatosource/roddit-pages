      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1f3n7z7/slater_steve_kerr_and_the_warriors_want_sophomore/"><p>[Slater] Steve Kerr and the Warriors want sophomore guard Brandin Podziemski to take 8-10 Three Pointers per game next season</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5705669/2024/08/28/brandin-podziemski-warriors-lauri-markkanen/?source=user_shared_article" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“A big focus for them was me shooting more 3s,” Podziemski said. “I don’t know what I shot, but I shot a pretty good percentage. I just didn’t get up enough attempts.”</p>

<p>Podziemski made 38.5 percent of his 3s, but he only took 3.2 per game.<br>
“They want me to take anywhere (from) eight to 10 per game. That’s what they told me,” Podziemski said. “All different types: off dribble handoffs, off ball screens, catch-and-shoot.”</p>

<p>The jump from 3.2 attempts per game to roughly 10 appears overly ambitious. Only 10 players in the league averaged eight or more per game last season. Curry, Dončić and Thompson were the only three to get up more than nine per game.</p>

<p>“I think I can get to that amount,” Podziemski said. “The reason they said that is because I’d be watching film last season after every game, and it’s always on there: Missed 3-point opportunity that I didn’t take. There were a good two to four each game that I passed up. If you look at that, it’s a good five to seven per game I could’ve got up.</p>

<p>“Now with Klay being gone, Chris (Paul) being gone, someone is going to have to handle the ball a little bit more. I think I’m more than capable of doing that. Given that, I think it leads me to have more 3s.”</p>

<p>However, I can see a scenario where Kerr decides this team isn&rsquo;t built for defense and decide to go more offensively.</p>

<p>Curry has been on ball about the same as ever, or did you not notice we had Chris Paul last year?  Podz, CP3, and Dray all played on ball a lot last year.  We need Podz and Hield shooting more 3’s because Kuminga and TJD are negative spacing and we want to play them at the same time.  All of this has very little to do with Steph.</p>

      <label for="lkg9kc7" class="commentText"><p>Is this a viable strategy? In a 48 minute game, a team would have to put up a three point attempt every 14.4 seconds to reach 200 3PAs. If a team can consistently hit 20% of those shots, that is 120 points. Steve Kerr can pioneer the new, potentially game changing strategy of only having one defender getting ready to either rebound or inbound the ball back to the four scorers that just stand at the three point line all game while allowing the opposing team open buckets to insure the team is able to get the 200 3PAs in 14.4 seconds. On a team with Stephen Curry, I am confident the Warriors can get that efficiency to 30% and ideally, the 3PAs have to be around 300 to truly secure a victory. Call me Dunleavy. I got more championship level strategies for you to utilize</p>

      <label for="lkfvjgl" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s as simple as what he looks for first. Curry always shoots first. Brandon probably felt like passing to Steph Klay etc. was the best option, and that being a ball hog shooter would be bad for the system, so he didn&rsquo;t want to break plays by shooting.</p>

<p>If he can rewrite his habits to be willing to break a play for a shot and the team is cool with it, that might be all he needs to do ( but he&rsquo;ll probably never be as green light shoot happy as a Curry or JR).</p>

<p>Unfortunately it doesn&rsquo;t look like they have the pieces to execute the amazing defense part of the plan but maybe appreciably better shooting can give them more leeway. Will be interesting to see if they can get there on the 3PAs</p>

      <label for="lkgt2er" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s a really weird claim. He had an awful season in 2022 and people used that same logic to make the case that he was declining. Then he ran through the playoffs, lit the Celtics on fire, and put up a vintage Steph season the following year.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re assuming it&rsquo;s decline when it could very well be normal variance for some taking 12 threes per game. I personally haven&rsquo;t really seen much slippage in his offensive game.</p>

<p>I always thought Lebron was gonna wear down in his mid-30s lol, I&rsquo;m done trying to time the market on these guys.</p>

Idk what you watch- Steph&rsquo;s on ball game has declined noticeably and he barely attacks the rim now. He&rsquo;s also avg 0.7 steals compared to 1.5 through his career.</p>

      <label for="lkh2px1" class="commentText"><p>What I watched was every single Warriors game last year on Mexican League Pass. And what you&rsquo;re saying isn&rsquo;t true lol.</p>

<p>Steph&rsquo;s shot profile looks pretty much the same as it always does. He took a quarter of his shots in the paint last year. The only thing that changed with his paint shots compared to 2022 (I skipped over 2023 because that was his career best year in paint efficiency, which even further undermines your claim) is that he took .9 fewer shots per game in the restricted area, but .8 MORE shots per game in the paint outside the RA. In other words trading less than one layup for less than one floater per game. His efficiency in both types of shot increased from 2022 (going up 3.1% in the RA, and 1.3% in the non-RA paint).</p>

<p>The number of threes he took as a percentage of total shots were at the higher end of the range he&rsquo;s maintained for a decade, but essentially the same as his prior peak in 2021. Those threes have always been at the expense of his midrange looks, not his paint shots (his midrange looks started plummeting in 2014 but have been stable ever since.) His distance traveled offensively per game is also the same as its been for more than a decade. Maybe the only difference the last couple years is a bigger reliance on pull-ups and stepbacks and a decrease in catch-and-shoot opportunities. He&rsquo;s also finishing with more finger rolls and reverse layups than in years past. While it&rsquo;s true that he had a down shooting year from his normal lofty standards, you&rsquo;re simply wrong to say he barely attacks the rim.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s also not ignore that Draymond couldn&rsquo;t stay on the court last year. That two man game really helps Steph be the best version of himself.</p>

<p>If you ever watched Monta Ellis you know how little steals have to do with defense, but I agree there has been defensive slippage with Steph (across the entire Warriors roster, really). That&rsquo;s why I specified that I haven&rsquo;t noticed any slippage in his OFFENSIVE game.</p>

<p>Nah look at Steph’s stats from 2021-2024 and you will understand it’s just variance across seasons. People swear 2022 (at 34) he was in decline because of shooting slumps and then he wins the title and comes back with 2023. I can see him doing the same this season.</p>

<p>I’ve seen some warriors fans wanting to keep Podz over Kuminga which again doesn’t make sense to me. I simply don’t get the obsession with Podz other than he has potential to be a nice role player like Payton Pritchard or Cole Anthony. Maybe Brogdon at his peak</p>

      <label for="lkh31x4" class="commentText"><p>Fuck it, call me a homer, but Podz was a better player than both Cole Anthony and Payton Pritchard <em>last season</em>, and both the Celtics and Magic would rather have Podz than either of those guys because he has a way higher ceiling than they do at this point in their careers.</p>

<p>I went ahead and compared Podz to Pritchard/Anthony on 3stepbasket.com.</p>

<p>Podz outdid Pritchard on Overall/Teamwork/Ball Handling/Defense/Rebounding and tied him on Scoring. Pritchard did not win any categories.</p>

<p>Podz outdid Anthony on Overall/Teamwork/Ball Handling/Rebounding. Anthony outdid Podz on Scoring/Defense.</p>

<p>I peeked at their metrics, looks like they use pretty basic stats for their comparisons like REB% and AST%, as well as counting stats.</p>

<p>I didn’t watch either of Anthony or Pritchard. I’m not gonna pretend like I have a deep understanding of their games. But you didn’t watch Podz, either. I’m not sure he has the capability to become an all-star level <em>scorer</em>, but all of his other skills have the potential to be elite. He’s already above average at most skills in basketball. So let’s give him a chance to improve his shooting in his sophomore year before we write off his ceiling as <em>Payton Pritchard or Cole Anthony.</em></p>

      <label for="lkhcmbk" class="commentText"><p>I watched podz. A lot of him. Still don’t see how you can say all his skills have potential to be elite besides scoring. Hes not quick enough to drive and will often try to go to the basket and pick up his dribble then get stuck. Looks afraid to take the best available shot at times and that turns into him taking contested shots. His defense isn’t anything special. He works hard, that’s about it. Don’t see elite passing potential. He’s a decent passer, decent at decision making. I don’t see elite potential.</p>

<p>I just don’t see anything special beyond a good role player. I think he fits in the warriors system and knows how to play Steve Kerr basketball which is a compliment.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s wrong to compare him to Pritchard and Cole Anthony but my main point is he’s a role player at his ceiling. Never said he can’t be better than them or isn’t better than them already in a vacuum but he’ll have a similar role as the 6th/7th guy on a good team as them. Thats why I don’t think he should be off limits for trades and it’s just stupid. You guys talk about him like he can be an all star.</p>

<p>He was third on the team in minutes and first in plus/minus last year as a 20-yr old rookie, has the respect of Steph, Draymond, and Kerr, and is under contract for 3.5m, 3.6m, and 5.4m over the next three years.</p>

<p>That makes him extremely valuable to the Warriors. Would the Warriors be willing to trade him for Devin Booker? Sure. But for all practical purposes he&rsquo;s untradeable because he has more value to the Warriors than he does for anyone else.</p>

<p>Podz has the shooting talent for it but it is a huge adjustment and responsibility. The bigger question is really with Kuminga. One of he or Wiggins has to be passable from 3, or there&rsquo;s just not enough spacing.</p>

      <label for="lkfdsgf" class="commentText"><p>this is the correct big swing.</p>

<p>Podz was one of the best 3p shooters in his class (44% on 6+ attempts), but he did a huge amount of that shooting off-the-dribble (compared to guys like Hawkins or Dick, who were more classic movement c&amp;s shooters). As a rookie he wasn&rsquo;t really confident taking a lot of those pull-up 3&rsquo;s and wasn&rsquo;t as used to taking pure catch &amp; shoot attempts (he&rsquo;d hesitate and lose his window to shoot and then would look to playmake from there). Even given that, from Feb 1st through the end of the year (36 games) he shot 39% from outside.</p>

<p>no one quite knows yet what Podz&rsquo;s ceiling is, because he&rsquo;s so uncommonly good at so many little things that typically guys start doing in their 4th or 5th year (if ever), but you don&rsquo;t know what his main value driver will wind up being. if he can be the type of shooter he was at Santa Clara, it&rsquo;ll open up his entire offensive game and he&rsquo;ll be able to use that anticipation and floor reading so much more because of the space and reaction the defense has to him on the perimeter. it&rsquo;ll completely transform him as an offensive player.</p>

<p>no idea where his ceiling as a shooter is. you&rsquo;d like to think that there&rsquo;s some possibility of a Donte DiVincenzo quality shooter (~40% on 8+ attempts), but even that might be hopeful thinking.</p>

<p>no one is Steph, the Warriors just need more guys who are willing and able to take shots outside.</p>

<p>Last year there were games when Klay was absolutely on and hit 3s at his old clip. There were also games where he literally shot us out of the game because he kept jacking up shots and each miss affected him on the defensive end as well because he&rsquo;d drag his feet back on D.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Source? His defensive stats are not appreciably worse in games he shot under 40%. Nor are his rebounding numbers any lower, they&rsquo;re right around his career average of 3.5-4.</p>

<p>There was also games that Steph shot us out of last year too when he was dealing with his ankle and other ailments. There&rsquo;s no evidence that Klay was any more inconsistent than he&rsquo;s always been. And hoping Podz turns into the guy who made the 4th most threes last year and led the league in threes at over 300 last year is not fair to him either. The fact that they&rsquo;re putting him on this pedestal is setting him up for failure.</p>

<ul>
<li>Splits as a starter: 43/33/73 (3.7 3PAs per game; 28 game sample size)<br>

<p>Who needs Klay’s 39% on 9 attempts a game when you can have 8-10 attempts on 33%?? 🙃</p>

<p>Oh and for the cherry on top, Moody is a career 43% from 3 shooter as a starter (23 game sample size). 💔</p>

<p>Oh yeah, Moody coming up huge and saving the team when they’re teetering either trying to make it into the playoffs or within a series during the playoffs is an annual tradition for Moody since his rookie season. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/warriors/s/DoaJXgUQZ0" target="_blank">Literally</a>. By the time the next season starts, however, all of the ways he came up big (when no other young player or bench rotation piece could, mind you!) for the team gets memory-holed and he starts back from scratch trying to fight his way off the end of the bench. Every. Single. Year. I genuinely don’t know how he’s stayed so sane, I really don’t. 😭</p>

      <label for="lkg4xvn" class="commentText"><p>Speaking of those lol I did a little digging to see if I could figure out when the hell the franchise’s decision making became dictated top to bottom by some mythical internal model (the same one that said we had no shot at winning the 21-22 championship mind you lol so real great track record), and I almost wish I hadn’t lol.</p>

<p>This mythical model has existed since, at the earliest, the 20-21 season and it was created by one guy (Pabail Sidhu, our head stat guy as Kerr likes to call him) from scratch, which means there’s next to no serious track record of testing or independent vetting of it, etc. and they’re literally using it to make decisions across every department - from free agency decisions to lineup combinations to in-game decision making, etc. It’s the kind of thing that makes you laugh then cry then realize the shit show from a basketball product standpoint over the last few years makes a lot more sense now. 😭</p>

<p>From 2020:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since people now can monitor metrics aligned to team goals without asking Sidhu to create a report, he will have more time to spend building machine learning models to explore specific challenges—like what combination of players provides the toughest defense against a strong three-point shooting team.</p>

<p>“That’s where I start putting on my innovation hat,” he says. “I can spend that time now to dig deeper and build out new models, find other creative ways to analyze and display the data. That’s what I’m excited about.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s a fun (/s) story about his model in practice during the Wiseman experiment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Warriors head coach Steve Kerr has long resisted embracing the NBA’s most popular play, the pick-and-roll, for a simple reason: He believes the best offenses are unpredictable, and worries that a steady drumbeat of high screens would be easy for defenses to dissect.</p>

<p>But after watching Golden State lose seven of eight games as rookie center James Wiseman struggled to find open looks, Kerr was desperate for something — anything — to help his team. <strong>Pabail Sidhu, the Warriors’ director of analytics and innovation, showed Kerr numbers reinforcing that Wiseman was at his best in pick-and-rolls with guard Stephen Curry.</strong></p>

<p>This was a significant concession for Kerr, who had spent much of the previous 3 ½ months making only tweaks to his movement-heavy offense despite the fact that it called for a passing big man, and Wiseman is more of a lob threat. <strong>Sidhu’s numbers convinced Kerr that, even though a heavy dose of pick-and-rolls might not be as aesthetically pleasing as Kerr’s motion system, it was what the Warriors needed.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wiseman’s pts per possession in the PnR that season? 1.12 PPP, in the 49th percentile, and worse than everyone on the roster that season except JTA. But hey, Sidhu’s numbers/model said that’s what was best for Wiseman and therefore what the Warriors needed! So to the bench went Loon and the Warriors’ 67.6% win rate (23-11 record) when Loon started that season with him, and hello to the 40.7% win rate with Wiseman as a starter (11-16 record).</p>

<p>Not to be deterred by that laughably disastrous failure or his numbers/model indicating we didn’t have a chance at all to win the 21-22 championship, only for us to win it (lol whoosies!) though, Kirk Lacob and Dunleavy have, since those failures (among god knows how many others), made Sidhu and his model as big of a driver in everyone’s decision making as ever!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Pabail Sidhu leads the refurbished analytics department. Mike Dunleavy Jr. and Kirk Lacob have been at the forefront of platforming Sidhu and better integrating his work into the organization’s decision-making. They’ve let him hire a bigger department and plan to let him expand it further. Sidhu has created his own formula that is used by several departments.”</p>

      <label for="lkh1cgf" class="commentText"><p>So Steph takes like 11 a game, Buddy at minimum takes 7-8 depending on playing time, Kuminga, Draymond, Wiggins and Moody each take between 2-3 and they add Melton who&rsquo;d probably shoot 2 a game. Lets add like 4 attempts from the rest of the roster. So if BP takes 10 threes they&rsquo;d be around 45-46 3pa a game. It&rsquo;s an all time high but not crazy. I think 7 is a bit more reasonable because he is a very good pull up 3 point shooter (42%).</p>

      <label for="lkhlnpc" class="commentText"><p>The Celtics winning with the Warriors “strength” means GSW is absolutely going to shoot nothing but 3s. Steph might average 15 attempts a game because the math says it’s a good play.</p>

<p>Teams in general are going to shoot more 3s this year and I won’t be surprised if several attempt record are broken.</p>

      <label for="lkhnjx8" class="commentText"><p>It doesn&rsquo;t really work that way. You can&rsquo;t just say you&rsquo;ll shoot 60 threes because it&rsquo;s good math since a team can shoot down attempts and the rise in attempts could eventually mean a decrease in %. It has to be a diet of many good shots. That&rsquo;s created by the threat of high level finishing at the rim. A 65-70% finisher at the rim is just as dangerous as a 43% shooter from 3. Getting to the line as a good FT shooter is the same.</p>

<p>The Warriors got many of their threes by defenders needing to gamble whether the hard cut off a screen is to the 3 point line or straight to the basket. If a player like Kuminga puts pressure on the rim then the 3 opens up. If they overrun the player to the three point line, then drivers like Draymond and Kuminga can fake the hand-off and crash the open lane. The Celtics became dangerous because the lanes were open 1-5 because they can all shoot. So teams had to help and contain drivers so when that happened, swing-swing-open three.</p>

<p>Looks like Steph took 19.5 shots last season, Klay took almost 15 (9 of which were 3s),  Kuminga had ~11.5, Wiggins had 11, Podz and CP3 both had ~8</p>

<p>With Klay and CP3 leaving, that&rsquo;s 23 shots per game off the team. I would imagine that&rsquo;s enough to get sizable bumps for Kuminga and Podz as well as new guys like Hield.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t think Kerr&rsquo;s going to bench him if he doesn&rsquo;t get up 10 threes a game, just that he has the green light from three and should shoot it more. If he goes from averaging 3 three attempts per game to 6 and the occational heater going out to 10 threes, I think that&rsquo;s success in Kerr&rsquo;s book.</p>

<p>No, they shouldn&rsquo;t have been delusional and got Steph a polished 2nd star who can shoulder a large offensive load like Lauri. Instead of praying that Podzemski or Kuminga can replicate that production</p>

      <label for="lkifh6g" class="commentText"><p>Utah got Danny AInge as the GM, their asking price was way too high. If they traded for Lauri, they&rsquo;d have a 2 year window and absolutely no assets for the next 4. They&rsquo;ll be patient and someone&rsquo;s going to be slower than expected out of the gate and get someone good for a more reasonable price</p>
