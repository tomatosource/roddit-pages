</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5705669/2024/08/28/brandin-podziemski-warriors-lauri-markkanen/?source=user_shared_article" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“A big focus for them was me shooting more 3s,” Podziemski said. “I don’t know what I shot, but I shot a pretty good percentage. I just didn’t get up enough attempts.”</p>

<p>Podziemski made 38.5 percent of his 3s, but he only took 3.2 per game.<br>
“They want me to take anywhere (from) eight to 10 per game. That’s what they told me,” Podziemski said. “All different types: off dribble handoffs, off ball screens, catch-and-shoot.”</p>

<p>The jump from 3.2 attempts per game to roughly 10 appears overly ambitious. Only 10 players in the league averaged eight or more per game last season. Curry, Dončić and Thompson were the only three to get up more than nine per game.</p>

<p>“I think I can get to that amount,” Podziemski said. “The reason they said that is because I’d be watching film last season after every game, and it’s always on there: Missed 3-point opportunity that I didn’t take. There were a good two to four each game that I passed up. If you look at that, it’s a good five to seven per game I could’ve got up.</p>

<p>“Now with Klay being gone, Chris (Paul) being gone, someone is going to have to handle the ball a little bit more. I think I’m more than capable of doing that. Given that, I think it leads me to have more 3s.”</p>

<p>Curry has been on ball about the same as ever, or did you not notice we had Chris Paul last year?  Podz, CP3, and Dray all played on ball a lot last year.  We need Podz and Hield shooting more 3’s because Kuminga and TJD are negative spacing and we want to play them at the same time.  All of this has very little to do with Steph.</p>

      <label for="lkg9kc7" class="commentText"><p>Is this a viable strategy? In a 48 minute game, a team would have to put up a three point attempt every 14.4 seconds to reach 200 3PAs. If a team can consistently hit 20% of those shots, that is 120 points. Steve Kerr can pioneer the new, potentially game changing strategy of only having one defender getting ready to either rebound or inbound the ball back to the four scorers that just stand at the three point line all game while allowing the opposing team open buckets to insure the team is able to get the 200 3PAs in 14.4 seconds. On a team with Stephen Curry, I am confident the Warriors can get that efficiency to 30% and ideally, the 3PAs have to be around 300 to truly secure a victory. Call me Dunleavy. I got more championship level strategies for you to utilize</p>

      <label for="lkfvjgl" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s as simple as what he looks for first. Curry always shoots first. Brandon probably felt like passing to Steph Klay etc. was the best option, and that being a ball hog shooter would be bad for the system, so he didn&rsquo;t want to break plays by shooting.</p>

<p>If he can rewrite his habits to be willing to break a play for a shot and the team is cool with it, that might be all he needs to do ( but he&rsquo;ll probably never be as green light shoot happy as a Curry or JR).</p>

<p>Unfortunately it doesn&rsquo;t look like they have the pieces to execute the amazing defense part of the plan but maybe appreciably better shooting can give them more leeway. Will be interesting to see if they can get there on the 3PAs</p>

<p>Boston not only takes a ton of threes they generate good ones by having so many advantages created while also spacing the court the best we’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>Not to mention they turned White into a great 3 point shooter when that was his only weakness</p>

<p>I’ve seen some warriors fans wanting to keep Podz over Kuminga which again doesn’t make sense to me. I simply don’t get the obsession with Podz other than he has potential to be a nice role player like Payton Pritchard or Cole Anthony. Maybe Brogdon at his peak</p>

      <label for="lkfdsgf" class="commentText"><p>this is the correct big swing.</p>

<p>Podz was one of the best 3p shooters in his class (44% on 6+ attempts), but he did a huge amount of that shooting off-the-dribble (compared to guys like Hawkins or Dick, who were more classic movement c&amp;s shooters). As a rookie he wasn&rsquo;t really confident taking a lot of those pull-up 3&rsquo;s and wasn&rsquo;t as used to taking pure catch &amp; shoot attempts (he&rsquo;d hesitate and lose his window to shoot and then would look to playmake from there). Even given that, from Feb 1st through the end of the year (36 games) he shot 39% from outside.</p>

<p>no one quite knows yet what Podz&rsquo;s ceiling is, because he&rsquo;s so uncommonly good at so many little things that typically guys start doing in their 4th or 5th year (if ever), but you don&rsquo;t know what his main value driver will wind up being. if he can be the type of shooter he was at Santa Clara, it&rsquo;ll open up his entire offensive game and he&rsquo;ll be able to use that anticipation and floor reading so much more because of the space and reaction the defense has to him on the perimeter. it&rsquo;ll completely transform him as an offensive player.</p>

<p>no idea where his ceiling as a shooter is. you&rsquo;d like to think that there&rsquo;s some possibility of a Donte DiVincenzo quality shooter (~40% on 8+ attempts), but even that might be hopeful thinking.</p>

<p>no one is Steph, the Warriors just need more guys who are willing and able to take shots outside.</p>

<p>Podz has the shooting talent for it but it is a huge adjustment and responsibility. The bigger question is really with Kuminga. One of he or Wiggins has to be passable from 3, or there&rsquo;s just not enough spacing.</p>

<p>Looks like Steph took 19.5 shots last season, Klay took almost 15 (9 of which were 3s),  Kuminga had ~11.5, Wiggins had 11, Podz and CP3 both had ~8</p>

<p>With Klay and CP3 leaving, that&rsquo;s 23 shots per game off the team. I would imagine that&rsquo;s enough to get sizable bumps for Kuminga and Podz as well as new guys like Hield.</p>

<p>Last year there were games when Klay was absolutely on and hit 3s at his old clip. There were also games where he literally shot us out of the game because he kept jacking up shots and each miss affected him on the defensive end as well because he&rsquo;d drag his feet back on D.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Source? His defensive stats are not appreciably worse in games he shot under 40%. Nor are his rebounding numbers any lower, they&rsquo;re right around his career average of 3.5-4.</p>

<p>There was also games that Steph shot us out of last year too when he was dealing with his ankle and other ailments. There&rsquo;s no evidence that Klay was any more inconsistent than he&rsquo;s always been. And hoping Podz turns into the guy who made the 4th most threes last year and led the league in threes at over 300 last year is not fair to him either. The fact that they&rsquo;re putting him on this pedestal is setting him up for failure.</p>

<ul>
<li>Splits as a starter: 43/33/73 (3.7 3PAs per game; 28 game sample size)<br>
</li>
<li>Splits off the bench: 47/42/57 (2.8 3PAs per game)<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Who needs Klay’s 39% on 9 attempts a game when you can have 8-10 attempts on 33%?? 🙃</p>

<p>Oh and for the cherry on top, Moody is a career 43% from 3 shooter as a starter (23 game sample size). 💔</p>

      <label for="lkg4xvn" class="commentText"><p>Speaking of those lol I did a little digging to see if I could figure out when the hell the franchise’s decision making became dictated top to bottom by some mythical internal model (the same one that said we had no shot at winning the 21-22 championship mind you lol so real great track record), and I almost wish I hadn’t lol.</p>

<p>This mythical model has existed since, at the earliest, the 20-21 season and it was created by one guy (Pabail Sidhu, our head stat guy as Kerr likes to call him) from scratch, which means there’s next to no serious track record of testing or independent vetting of it, etc. and they’re literally using it to make decisions across every department - from free agency decisions to lineup combinations to in-game decision making, etc. It’s the kind of thing that makes you laugh then cry then realize the shit show from a basketball product standpoint over the last few years makes a lot more sense now. 😭</p>

<p>From 2020:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since people now can monitor metrics aligned to team goals without asking Sidhu to create a report, he will have more time to spend building machine learning models to explore specific challenges—like what combination of players provides the toughest defense against a strong three-point shooting team.</p>

<p>“That’s where I start putting on my innovation hat,” he says. “I can spend that time now to dig deeper and build out new models, find other creative ways to analyze and display the data. That’s what I’m excited about.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s a fun (/s) story about his model in practice during the Wiseman experiment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Warriors head coach Steve Kerr has long resisted embracing the NBA’s most popular play, the pick-and-roll, for a simple reason: He believes the best offenses are unpredictable, and worries that a steady drumbeat of high screens would be easy for defenses to dissect.</p>

<p>But after watching Golden State lose seven of eight games as rookie center James Wiseman struggled to find open looks, Kerr was desperate for something — anything — to help his team. <strong>Pabail Sidhu, the Warriors’ director of analytics and innovation, showed Kerr numbers reinforcing that Wiseman was at his best in pick-and-rolls with guard Stephen Curry.</strong></p>

<p>This was a significant concession for Kerr, who had spent much of the previous 3 ½ months making only tweaks to his movement-heavy offense despite the fact that it called for a passing big man, and Wiseman is more of a lob threat. <strong>Sidhu’s numbers convinced Kerr that, even though a heavy dose of pick-and-rolls might not be as aesthetically pleasing as Kerr’s motion system, it was what the Warriors needed.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wiseman’s pts per possession in the PnR that season? 1.12 PPP, in the 49th percentile, and worse than everyone on the roster that season except JTA. But hey, Sidhu’s numbers/model said that’s what was best for Wiseman and therefore what the Warriors needed! So to the bench went Loon and the Warriors’ 67.6% win rate (23-11 record) when Loon started that season with him, and hello to the 40.7% win rate with Wiseman as a starter (11-16 record).</p>

<p>Not to be deterred by that laughably disastrous failure or his numbers/model indicating we didn’t have a chance at all to win the 21-22 championship, only for us to win it (lol whoosies!) though, Kirk Lacob and Dunleavy have, since those failures (among god knows how many others), made Sidhu and his model as big of a driver in everyone’s decision making as ever!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Pabail Sidhu leads the refurbished analytics department. Mike Dunleavy Jr. and Kirk Lacob have been at the forefront of platforming Sidhu and better integrating his work into the organization’s decision-making. They’ve let him hire a bigger department and plan to let him expand it further. Sidhu has created his own formula that is used by several departments.”</p>
