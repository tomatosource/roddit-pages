    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>From episode 10 of Starting 5.</p>

<p>Full quote (quote is intercut with clips of media members picking Mavs in the series or questioning Tatum):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know if, for lack of better terms, they were like, trolling.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Slightly disrespectful takes about me or about what I&rsquo;ve accomplished or what they think I can or can&rsquo;t do.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Or they really thought the Mavs were gonna beat us.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>It was just &lsquo;Jayson Tatum Jayson Tatum, Jayson Tatum&rsquo; every day. But I guess it felt good to be the underdog. First time in a while.</p>

      <label for="lr63dyv" class="commentText"><p>As a Celtics fan I was overjoyed when the Mavs won. Not because Dallas isnt good but because we were perfectly suited to beat them. We had arguably the two best guard defenders in the NBA and Brown and Tatum are both very capable defenders and we had size as well. The Mavs relied HEAVILY on their two guards producing all the offense and having alley-oops be a key part of their offense was reliant on not giving up too much size.</p>

<p>Just from Individual match ups alone we had a massive advantage not to mention we had FAR more playoffs experience than anyone in Dallas aside from Kyrie.</p>

Everybody knew the Celtics were actually the better team but some neutral fans were genuinely disappointed just because they hate the Celtics that bad and this is the reason why so many of them wanted Dallas to win.</p>

      <label for="lr640fv" class="commentText"><p>To be fair, I also think part of that was the way in which the loss happened. Even most of the people who thought the Celtics would win thought it would go 6-7 games I think.</p>

<p>Kyrie completely collapsed at the worst time and Luka unfortunately had his worst tendencies shown on a national stage which tbh I think could be a very good learning experience for him in the way it was for Tatum and Brown when we lost to the Warriors but him not getting back because he was yelling at the refs is something fans can&rsquo;t stand.</p>

      <label for="lr5vrbc" class="commentText"><p>It was the biggest disconnect between Vegas odds and public perception I’ve ever seen in a Finals series</p>

<p>Vegas odds said that the Celtics were significant favorites. The best prediction tool we have available.</p>

<p>But the public was very clearly slanted towards Dallas, as was the media even (ex: espn analysts went 9-8 for Mavs). There were public polls that I saw on reddit, twitter, and youtube, and every single one had the Mavs winning.</p>

<p>Luka/Kyrie effect, criticism of the Celtics’ easy playoff path, and Tatum hate all played a role I’m guessing.</p>

You beat so-so teams, you must not be good. Doesn’t matter that there weren’t any good teams to beat. Honestly think you’d have been rated higher if you’d barely squeaked out wins against a fully healthy Bucks and Knicks instead of demolishing the shit out of the Pacers and Cavs.</p>

<p>Phil Jackson’s definition of a contender is ‘40 before 20’.</p>

<p>In 2023, there were 3 teams who fit this bill (Milwaukee, Boston, Denver) and Miami eliminated two of them before getting curb stomped by Denver.</p>

<p>In 2024, there were 4 teams who fit this bill (Boston, OKC, Minnesota, Denver), and Dallas eliminated two of them before getting soundly beaten by Boston.</p>

<p>Feels like Miami and Dallas’s purpose was to take out the eventual champions hardest matchups.</p>

<p>And when a comment rightfully pulls in Shai to the MVP conversation, they get toxic rebutted or downvoted to oblivion eventho he&rsquo;s No. 1 seed, plays much better defense than Luka and carried OKC with 0 AllStars all the way to the top when Vegas and nobody else had them even making playoffs.</p>

<p>Ends up Jokic has 3x the votes of Luka so it ain&rsquo;t even close, and people are actually shocked Shai finishes ahead as well while Luka gets an anti-climatic 3rd. That&rsquo;s when the posts and narratives stopped.</p>

<p>it wasn’t just hot take artists pushing the Mavs, guys like Tim Legler and Steve Jones who I respect quite a bit as basketball minds were also picking against the Celtics</p>

<p>plain and simple everyone underestimated Boston bc of their history and how tight the Indiana series was, and they didn’t pay any mind to the fact that the Celtics were basically the worst possible matchup in the league for Dallas. I was ecstatic when the Mavs ended up being our Finals opponent bc there wasn’t a team in the West we matched up better with</p>

<p>the only people who correctly predicted how the series would go were Ben Taylor and Celtics fans.</p>

<p>Before the finals, sooooo many analysts genuinely thought this too.</p>

      <label for="lr676ui" class="commentText"><p>Okc could have. But kyrie Irving is fucking kyrie Irving.</p>

<p>Denver was our only competition. And the head coach over at Minnesota made a team whose whole goal is to beat Denver. It was doomed from the start.</p>

<p>Currently? I think sixers, nuggets, okc, and mavs again. Are our main comp. At least until Knicks/wolves trade proves to be a bust or not.</p>

<p>Celtics have been a nightmare vs the Mavs for years, but particularly last year. Big focus on 3-point shooting, which is the weakest link in our defense. Jaylen Brown always plays like 75% better against us than anyone else. Stretch centers galore.</p>

      <label for="lr5ydrw" class="commentText"><p>I felt like a lot of the media members that picked the Mavs were kind of forced into it by how highly they rated any of (a) LeBron, (b) Jokic,  and &copy; Ant Edwards last year - especially the latter two. The Mavs beat team c, who beat team b, who beat team a, so how can anyone in the east be better than a team that did all that? In similar vein, they also beat the no2 in MVP votes (Shai) along the way&hellip; so surely they can dispose of a Boston. That&rsquo;s the logic these media members are trapping themselves in - take &lsquo;integrity&rsquo; demands that you admit you were perhaps slightly overestimating a, b, c and/or d if you suddenly pick Boston over the Mavs, when most of them had Denver, Minnesota or OKC winning the title at the start of the playoffs.</p>

<p>Best offensive rating in NBA history, 5th best point differential of all time, 16-3 in the playoffs. Historic team by all accounts.</p>

When did Tatum choke? When he couldn’t lead his team past the greatest shooter of all time at 22 years old with a shoulder and wrist injury? Or when he rolled his ankle on the first play in game 7 and couldn’t preform well because of it?</p>

<p>Sometimes you just aren’t good enough. Doesn’t mean you choked.</p>

      <label for="lr5zby0" class="commentText"><p>I mean what did he want, 100% of analysts to pick his team? Its basketball anyone can win any game, is it that hard to believe that Luka could get super hot and win 4 basketball games? This just comes off as super arrogant. His team was rightfully favored and they won. Just enjoy that, him saying all this comes off as salty which is the last thing he should be as the reigning NBA champion</p>
