      <p>Was thinking about KD and this occurred to me.

Lebron from not winning in Cleveland to Miami, back to Cleveland, over to LA kinda killed leadership/clutch appeal.  3-10 hurt the legacy.

      <label for="l85pv9g" class="commentText"><p>Tbh you can tell how young people here are because people don’t mention Lebron. He was really liked in the 2000s. He was funny, childlike, high flying and kinda like the golden child. He was like The Rock in WWE during the late 90s/very early 2000s</p>

<p>Then he went to Miami and he became the villain. Everyone (including me) wanted to see him lose.</p>

<p>Then he went back to Cleveland and suddenly it’s like he became the good guy again. I was rooting for him and happy to see him win a championship for Cleveland (he played his ass off in that last game where they win against GSW). It was like he was the good guy.</p>

<p>Then he went to LA and tbh no one really cared too much at that point. He’s kinda in the middle now. Not a hero in the league but not a villain either. He’s in his MJ Wizards era (he’s way more dominant that MJ was at the end of his career, but you get the point)</p>

      <label for="l86v279" class="commentText"><p>He also had a lot of criticism around his child-like approach to the game. I&rsquo;m sure most have forgotten or aren&rsquo;t even aware of the narratives that surrounded him prior to his first chip. During those ringless 8 years, he was considered unserious, unclutch, passive, no post game, and a broken jumpshot. He&rsquo;s pretty much the exact opposite of that now.</p>

<p>And comparing LeBron now to Wizards MJ is absurd.  LeBron won a championship in LA, he’s still an All-NBA player, he’s still the leading vote getter in his conference, and he’s the still most popular American athlete in the world.  That is definitely not Wizards era MJ, where fat MJ sucked, the Wizards sucked and never made the playoffs, and fat MJ was not All-NBA selection nor the leading all star vote getter for his conference.</p>

For Jimmy to stay, he wanted Ben Simmons and Brett Brown gone, which nobody was ready to do at that point.  Tobias Harris was the desperation play, but nobody chose him over Jimmy Butler.

He could get paid immediately but we would have to trade people. Wiggins was already extended before Jimmy even came here, and there was a 0% chance the wolves would trade KAT.</p>

<p>Realistically he just wanted to play for Miami but to get out he threw 2 of our players under the bus.</p>

<p>Melo did a similar thing when he was traded to the Knicks, mainly because he wanted to sign a new deal before the new CBA</p>

<p>Like I could understand people maybe saying he needs to get a mean streak or needs to stop smiling so much, but if he continues to play as hard as he does on every possession like he has been, it’ll be hard to hate on the dude</p>

      <label for="l86hyxr" class="commentText"><p>The problem with Dwight wasn&rsquo;t that he was always smiling and making him out to be fake, it&rsquo;s that he started to get a big ego and started demanding trades, led the league in technical fouls in 2011, and then got injured a lot and fell off a cliff after the failed LA Lakers experiement with Steve Nash.</p>

<p>Then his off court stuff started coming out, and his squeaky clean fun loving marketable persona clashed very harshly with the amount of baby momma drama he had out there.</p>

<p>If he reaches superstardom, this won’t matter to some people. Think about Curry for example, especially early in his career, there really wasn’t much ammo to use against him before the 2016 Finals. And he was similarly a guy who had goofy non-confrontational celebrations and always looked like he was having a good time. Still had plenty of haters.</p>

<p>Maxey up to this point has just stayed in his bubble and isn’t made out to be this generational player. He’s the leagues most improved player and sportsmanship award. Sixers have also been contenders every year for the past 5 years to the point it’s turned Embiid into arguably the most hated player in the league next to Draymond. So idk if the comparison is very apt in this case</p>

Laker fans hated him because of the constant LeBron-Kobe comparisons. Then after LeDecision everyone hated him (the shit he got after the 2011 finals). He returned to the Cavs and after the 2016 finals, everyone saw him as one of the GOATs (imo he is). Battling vs the KD-Warriors had everyone rooting for him, and when he signed with the Lakers, he turned a whole fanbase that hated him into loving him.</p>

<p>He and his reputation have had a lot of twists and pivots throughout his career (20+ years will do that), but I actually don’t think his reputation now is all that different than I would have predicted 20 years ago.</p>

<p>He’s effectively lived up the hype, putting himself legitimately in the GOAT conversation. He had the Miami decision that made a number of people angry, but his return to Cleveland and eventual title there salved much of that frustration. He has his haters and stans, but I feel like much of the conversation now is just about how great he has been and how much we should appreciate what he’s done/is doing.</p>

The massive media entourage supporting him has held him up reasonably well but that’ll go away eventually and I have a hard time believing LeBron and the large number of nba players using PEDs will get away with it in the long-term.  Eventually, maybe after they’re all retired, people will talk.  Then it’ll be open season with not media support he’s enjoying right now.</p>

But we need to throw longevity and anything related to it out the window when we discuss the greats of the game.  Pretty sure Kareem wasn’t taking EPO and HGH.  To mark down the greats of previous eras because they didn’t take illegal performance enhancing drugs or didn’t have a body or athletic ability that can only be created using illegal performance enhancing drugs is not ok.  Pretending they’re running around the court at 40 years old with a freak physique like they’re 25 and it’s all just because they’re that superior mutants is just bullshit.  It bastardizes the history of the game.</p>

After winning the 2011 MVP was asked on a scale of 1-10, with 1 being NBA players don’t know what PEDs are and a 10 being everyone is juicing, said it was a 7.  Said it was a major problem and the league needed to make it more fair.  Longtime great coach George Karl said that the league has a massive drug problem and it’s PEDs.  I think it is pretty commonly understood that these guys are juicing.</p>

<p>Additionally, what other major sport do you see athletes performing at 40 like they are 25?  Cycling?  Swimming?  Decathletes?  Olympians?  Tennis stars?  No.  We only see it one place: the NBA.  And that’s pretty telling.</p>

      <label for="l864xa9" class="commentText"><p>The NFL is absolutely juicing.  So, yes.  I’m sure that comes as a surprise to nobody.  That’s why you had 275 pound OL in the 80’s and early 90’s and now they’re all 325.  Cheating in this way hasn’t always been done.  I’m not exactly sure when exactly it started but probably in the early 2000’s.  As it became apparent that the NBA, unlike MLB, would allow it then it became more widespread and at this point you have to take them just to keep up with everyone else that’s doing them.</p>

That and strategically picking his teammates to spread the floor to leave rims unprotected helps a ton as well.  Someone that is strictly mediocre as a shooter needs the floor spacing.  Thats one thing he figured out correctly in putting his super teams together.</p>

<p>They SHARED belief at the time was that Draymond getting suspended hurt his team. We don’t know that Warriors win game 5 if he plays. But we do know Cavs win game 5 with him not playing. We’ll never know if Draymonds presence would’ve changed things because his antics robbed us of that possibility. He didn’t play, so now we can only wonder what if. If he plays and they still lose than you know you lost while at full strength. Instead the Warriors lost their DPOY and the Cavs have two players score 41 a pop.</p>

And I say this knowing I am not alone. All I have is the real result, and know that a pivotal players absence in one of 3 straight losses could’ve made a difference, and how Draymond has even blamed the series loss on himself anyway.</p>

<p>Remember, it costs $0 to not kick someone in the nuts. Yet Draymond did it anyway.</p>

The question is changed over time. If he went from most hated ever to even a little liked, that’s a drastic change and a huge net positive.</p>

<p>And even now, he’s very popular and more liked than he ever was. Sure he’s no longer in the league but you yourself wrote “recency bias” which implies you were thinking of his post NBA career even if the question specifically said “in the league”. So maybe question yourself about the interpretation of the question and not me</p>

      <label for="l86fxe0" class="commentText"><p>Yep. The fact that there was even much of a debate in 2004 (to my understanding, since I wasn&rsquo;t a huge NBA fan back then) between the Lakers keeping Kobe, then a 25-year-old star who had arguably the highest trade value in the league (when you consider his combination of potential, accomplishments, and proven ability - he averaged 30 ppg in 2002-03 - at the time), and keeping Shaq, a 32-year-old out-of-shape center with a lengthy injury history who wanted a massive contract, speaks to how controversial Kobe&rsquo;s style of play was (in addition to his off-the-court troubles).</p>

      <label for="l85ttrn" class="commentText"><p>I think it’s pretty clearly KD with Embiid as a close second. KD is by far the most jarring. He went from being the beloved young superstar seen as LeBron’s biggest challenger to being the most hated player in the league. People were unironically saying he ruined basketball and the flip was very instantaneous.</p>

<p>Embiid is a crazy one because I can’t really like point when he became so hated. I still remember when we used to feel bad for him because of Simmons and Tobias Harris and his injuries were seen as bad luck more so than used against him. The comment about “I don’t have two MVP’s” definitely hurt but that was 2022, and after they lost to the Heat, most of the Heat was on Harden for not stepping up when Embiid was injured withy he orbital fracture. Did that 2023 MVP race really yank his reputation that badly?</p>

<p>The latest “he’s calmed down and just focused on hoopin” narrative that’s come out from media this playoffs has been refreshing</p>

<p>I think he’s a very eclectic guy (maybe most in league) that has hall of fame level talent or even best to ever do it level talent in some areas (as a guard finishing inside, handles, etc), and it’s led to this wild ride of the player and the person merging as he has aged</p>

<p>Some of the KD hate is pretty unfair. People just enjoy hating on superstars. I have a pretty dim view of some of the media stuff and self-absorbed behavior from Lebron.</p>

      <label for="l85i7vj" class="commentText"><p>Embiid and KD. Also Tyrese Haliburton this year stepped into that.</p>

<p>Embiid for being a foul merchant flopped that doesn’t care if he hurts people even though he’s 7’0. KD cause he jumped ship and it’s never his fault.</p>

<p>Haliburton though man was the primary ball handler and they were down 2-0 to the Knicks and he looked so soft. They start playing through Siakim and start winning, then he’s all “these guys can’t guard me” as if he isn’t being carried as a complimentary piece that series vs a hobbled Knicks team. He hand gestures Miles McBride as small behind his back but when Miles turned around he made it seem like he was scratching his face. Like he was scared to be seen making fun of the dude. Then unlike Reggie or Trae who are actually dawgs and did their antics on the court, he waits until he gets to the post game conference and wears his little hoodie? Then gets swept in the ECF and blamed it on health? Idk dude just came off as the little kid that talks shit but then doesn’t back it up when face to face with who he is talking about - kind of like an internet warrior. Haliburton is mad corny.</p>

<p>Notice how he “is only itching his nose” when McBride turns his head towards him? Stand up say it with your chest like a man dude. Bush league shit to me. Dudes at the park have more balls than this guy. Just my opinion though.</p>
