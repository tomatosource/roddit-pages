      <p>Was thinking about KD and this occurred to me. He went from an almost universally-liked small market guy <a href="https://hot-town-images.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/kwtv/production/2013/January/3/kd-is-not-nice-according-to-nike.1357240541000-1.jpeg" target="_blank">(so much so that Nike created a whole press campaign parodying this idea)</a> to being perceived as a serial malcontent and lightning rod for haters.</p>

<p>Who else (positive or negative) has flipped their public perception the most?</p>

      <label for="l85gwue" class="commentText"><p>Interesting question. KD might be the best answer. His reputation during his MVP speech and his reputation after signing with Golden State are on complete opposites of the spectrum.</p>

<p>Kyrie&rsquo;s reputation has been a rollercoaster as well.</p>

Now nobody I know will watch Sixers games anymore because he&rsquo;s a mopey foul merchant that topples over when so much as breathed on. Just his body language alone takes all the fun out of the game.</p>

      <label for="l85i5lh" class="commentText"><p>LeBron should be up there. Hyped as the chosen one. I think a lot of people either liked him or mocked him. Laker fans hated him because of the constant LeBron-Kobe comparisons. Then after LeDecision everyone hated him (the shit he got after the 2011 finals). He returned to the Cavs and after the 2016 finals, everyone saw him as one of the GOATs (imo he is). Battling vs the KD-Warriors had everyone rooting for him, and when he signed with the Lakers, he turned a whole fanbase that hated him into loving him.</p>

      <label for="l85ilb0" class="commentText"><p>Nowadays, take your pick.</p>

<p>Fans and Media like the hot new thing. Ant Edwards, Tyrese (Maxey and Hali), Shai, hell even Wemby one day will have their perception shifted.</p>

<p>Just like Westbrook, Durant, Kyrie, Dame, Zion, LeBron (for a while).</p>

<p>The answer is whoever is over the &ldquo;hot new thing&rdquo; phase, but before the &ldquo;lovable vet&rdquo; phase.</p>

      <label for="l85jvu1" class="commentText"><p>Think it has to be Kyrie, if I listed out all the turns he’s had you could publish that post as a novel</p>

<p>The latest “he’s calmed down and just focused on hoopin” narrative that’s come out from media this playoffs has been refreshing</p>

<p>I think he’s a very eclectic guy (maybe most in league) that has hall of fame level talent or even best to ever do it level talent in some areas (as a guard finishing inside, handles, etc), and it’s led to this wild ride of the player and the person merging as he has aged</p>

      <label for="l85i7vj" class="commentText"><p>Embiid and KD. Also Tyrese Haliburton this year stepped into that.</p>

<p>Embiid for being a foul merchant flopped that doesn’t care if he hurts people even though he’s 7’0. KD cause he jumped ship and it’s never his fault.</p>

<p>Haliburton though man was the primary ball handler and they were down 2-0 to the Knicks and he looked so soft. They start playing through Siakim and start winning, then he’s all “these guys can’t guard me” as if he isn’t being carried as a complimentary piece that series vs a hobbled Knicks team. He hand gestures Miles McBride as small behind his back but when Miles turned around he made it seem like he was scratching his face. Like he was scared to be seen making fun of the dude. Then unlike Reggie or Trae who are actually dawgs and did their antics on the court, he waits until he gets to the post game conference and wears his little hoodie? Then gets swept in the ECF and blamed it on health? Idk dude just came off as the little kid that talks shit but then doesn’t back it up when face to face with who he is talking about - kind of like an internet warrior. Haliburton is mad corny.</p>
