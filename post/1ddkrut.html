      <p>Was thinking about KD and this occurred to me.

Laker fans hated him because of the constant LeBron-Kobe comparisons. Then after LeDecision everyone hated him (the shit he got after the 2011 finals). He returned to the Cavs and after the 2016 finals, everyone saw him as one of the GOATs (imo he is). Battling vs the KD-Warriors had everyone rooting for him, and when he signed with the Lakers, he turned a whole fanbase that hated him into loving him.</p>

<p>He and his reputation have had a lot of twists and pivots throughout his career (20+ years will do that), but I actually don‚Äôt think his reputation now is all that different than I would have predicted 20 years ago.</p>

<p>He‚Äôs effectively lived up the hype, putting himself legitimately in the GOAT conversation. He had the Miami decision that made a number of people angry, but his return to Cleveland and eventual title there salved much of that frustration. He has his haters and stans, but I feel like much of the conversation now is just about how great he has been and how much we should appreciate what he‚Äôs done/is doing.</p>

      <label for="l85l1dx" class="commentText"><p>I think the repeated ring chasing that‚Äôs been elongated by PEDs will eventually catch up with him.  The massive media entourage supporting him has held him up reasonably well but that‚Äôll go away eventually and I have a hard time believing LeBron and the large number of nba players using PEDs will get away with it in the long-term.  Eventually, maybe after they‚Äôre all retired, people will talk.  Then it‚Äôll be open season with not media support he‚Äôs enjoying right now.</p>

I would say there is much less respect for giving up so very early and young on staying in one place and building a team into a champion like the greats before him.  I think people view it as a cheap way for a guy who was proclaimed to be a goat candidate before entering the league to try to measure up after concluding he couldn‚Äôt do it the way the other goat candidates did it.</p>

      <label for="l85phj4" class="commentText"><p>And I am honestly fine with that if they come out and make that their policy.  There‚Äôs a lot to be said for it.  But we need to throw longevity and anything related to it out the window when we discuss the greats of the game.  Pretty sure Kareem wasn‚Äôt taking EPO and HGH.  To mark down the greats of previous eras because they didn‚Äôt take illegal performance enhancing drugs or didn‚Äôt have a body or athletic ability that can only be created using illegal performance enhancing drugs is not ok.  Pretending they‚Äôre running around the court at 40 years old with a freak physique like they‚Äôre 25 and it‚Äôs all just because they‚Äôre that superior mutants is just bullshit.  It bastardizes the history of the game.</p>

<p>I think he‚Äôs a very eclectic guy (maybe most in league) that has hall of fame level talent or even best to ever do it level talent in some areas (as a guard finishing inside, handles, etc), and it‚Äôs led to this wild ride of the player and the person merging as he has aged</p>

      <label for="l85pv9g" class="commentText"><p>Tbh you can tell how young people here are because people don‚Äôt mention Lebron. He was really liked in the 2000s. He was funny, childlike, high flying and kinda like the golden child. He was like The Rock in WWE during the late 90s/very early 2000s</p>

<p>Then he went to Miami and he became the villain. Everyone (including me) wanted to see him lose.</p>

<p>Then he went back to Cleveland and suddenly it‚Äôs like he became the good guy again. I was rooting for him and happy to see him win a championship for Cleveland (he played his ass off in that last game where they win against GSW). It was like he was the good guy.</p>

<p>Then he went to LA and tbh no one really cared too much at that point. He‚Äôs kinda in the middle now. Not a hero in the league but not a villain either. He‚Äôs in his MJ Wizards era (he‚Äôs way more dominant that MJ was at the end of his career, but you get the point)</p>

He was considered a unicorn&hellip;.a defensive savant who you could actually run an offense through.

Now he&rsquo;s a psychotic, nut kicking loudmouth who finds new and creative ways to cheap shot opponents and handicap his own team.</p>

<p>Embiid for being a foul merchant flopped that doesn‚Äôt care if he hurts people even though he‚Äôs 7‚Äô0. KD cause he jumped ship and it‚Äôs never his fault.</p>

<p>Haliburton though man was the primary ball handler and they were down 2-0 to the Knicks and he looked so soft. They start playing through Siakim and start winning, then he‚Äôs all ‚Äúthese guys can‚Äôt guard me‚Äù as if he isn‚Äôt being carried as a complimentary piece that series vs a hobbled Knicks team. He hand gestures Miles McBride as small behind his back but when Miles turned around he made it seem like he was scratching his face. Like he was scared to be seen making fun of the dude. Then unlike Reggie or Trae who are actually dawgs and did their antics on the court, he waits until he gets to the post game conference and wears his little hoodie? Then gets swept in the ECF and blamed it on health? Idk dude just came off as the little kid that talks shit but then doesn‚Äôt back it up when face to face with who he is talking about - kind of like an internet warrior. Haliburton is mad corny.</p>
