      <p>Was thinking about KD and this occurred to me. He went from an almost universally-liked small market guy <a href="https://hot-town-images.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/kwtv/production/2013/January/3/kd-is-not-nice-according-to-nike.1357240541000-1.jpeg" target="_blank">(so much so that Nike created a whole press campaign parodying this idea)</a> to being perceived as a serial malcontent and lightning rod for haters.</p>

<p>Who else (positive or negative) has flipped their public perception the most?</p>

It just showed he cared too much about what people say and that would cause more people to try and talk shit to get his attention and then he would respond and it becomes a vicious circle.

      <label for="l85pv9g" class="commentText"><p>Tbh you can tell how young people here are because people don’t mention Lebron. He was really liked in the 2000s. He was funny, childlike, high flying and kinda like the golden child. He was like The Rock in WWE during the late 90s/very early 2000s</p>

<p>Then he went to Miami and he became the villain. Everyone (including me) wanted to see him lose.</p>

<p>Then he went back to Cleveland and suddenly it’s like he became the good guy again. I was rooting for him and happy to see him win a championship for Cleveland (he played his ass off in that last game where they win against GSW). It was like he was the good guy.</p>

<p>Then he went to LA and tbh no one really cared too much at that point. He’s kinda in the middle now. Not a hero in the league but not a villain either. He’s in his MJ Wizards era (he’s way more dominant that MJ was at the end of his career, but you get the point)</p>

I&rsquo;m sure most have forgotten or aren&rsquo;t even aware of the narratives that surrounded him prior to his first chip. During those ringless 8 years, he was considered unserious, unclutch, passive, no post game, and a broken jumpshot. He&rsquo;s pretty much the exact opposite of that now.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people also liked the villain arc cause of how the cavs were fumbling in making a team around him.</p>

<p>This is the main difference with the KD move. KD&rsquo;s OKC was up 3-1 in the western conference against the Warriors.</p>

<p>And comparing LeBron now to Wizards MJ is absurd.  LeBron won a championship in LA, he was in the conference finals last season, he’s still an All-NBA selection, he’s still the leading All Star vote getter in his conference, and he’s the still most popular American athlete in the world.  That is definitely not Wizards era MJ, where fat MJ sucked, the Wizards sucked and never made the playoffs, and fat MJ was not All-NBA selection nor the leading all star vote getter for his conference.</p>

      <label for="l87ciqp" class="commentText"><p>Wizards MJ seemingly sucked in comparison to the MJ everybody was used to seeing but he came back after having not played pro sports for three seasons, on bum knees and broken ribs thanks to Ron Artest. It is about as bad a situation as you would ever hope to be in entering an NBA season.<br>
You really can&rsquo;t emphasise enough how difficult it is to come back to pro sports after several years of living a retired life of golf, whiskey and cigars let alone with everything else he was going through. Yet he dropped 30 in just his <em>second game back</em> and 40 in his 9th game. He had a 50 point game, at the time the oldest player to do that, and then followed it up with a 45 point game. A couple of weeks later he would have back to back 40 point games again. LeBron never had back to back 40 point games this season. MJ had the &lsquo;sucky&rsquo; Wizards in the top four or five in the East and was averaging 27+ at one stage. This on a team struggling to put up 90 a night. And he didn&rsquo;t have a dominant big man to help him like AD. But here you are glamourising LeBron for averaging 25 on a team pushing 120 a night in probably the most offense friendly era in league history.<br>
Once Jordan&rsquo;s knees gave up on him for good it limited him basically to being a mid range shooter almost exclusively yet he still did that at over 40%. LeBron shot 30% from midrange this season.<br>
Sure, nobody should pretend Jordan was a better player at that age but circumstances simply did not allow him to be. But to pretend he was some scrub and childishly refer to him as &lsquo;Fat MJ&rsquo; just makes you look like you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.</p>

Like the other guy said Lebron isn’t a hero or a villain right now, he’s kinda just an old guy (that’s still playing really well mind you) who everybody knows is gonna be retiring not too long from now.</p>

Nobody thought the Cavs were ready to fire JB Bickerstaff this year, but they did it anyway.</p>

<p>Then his off court stuff started coming out, and his squeaky clean fun loving marketable persona clashed very harshly with the amount of baby momma drama he had out there.</p>

<p>If he reaches superstardom, this won’t matter to some people. Think about Curry for example, especially early in his career, there really wasn’t much ammo to use against him before the 2016 Finals. And he was similarly a guy who had goofy non-confrontational celebrations and always looked like he was having a good time. Still had plenty of haters.</p>

      <label for="l85i5lh" class="commentText"><p>LeBron should be up there. Hyped as the chosen one. I think a lot of people either liked him or mocked him. Laker fans hated him because of the constant LeBron-Kobe comparisons. Then after LeDecision everyone hated him (the shit he got after the 2011 finals). He returned to the Cavs and after the 2016 finals, everyone saw him as one of the GOATs (imo he is). Battling vs the KD-Warriors had everyone rooting for him, and when he signed with the Lakers, he turned a whole fanbase that hated him into loving him.</p>

      <label for="l85lf1d" class="commentText"><p>LeBron is an interesting one.</p>

<p>He and his reputation have had a lot of twists and pivots throughout his career (20+ years will do that), but I actually don’t think his reputation now is all that different than I would have predicted 20 years ago.</p>

<p>He’s effectively lived up the hype, putting himself legitimately in the GOAT conversation. He had the Miami decision that made a number of people angry, but his return to Cleveland and eventual title there salved much of that frustration. He has his haters and stans, but I feel like much of the conversation now is just about how great he has been and how much we should appreciate what he’s done/is doing.</p>

<p>Aside from that,me and many others will see the 2016 NBA finals as the most legendary and revered finals in NBA history. I can&rsquo;t imagine any other matchup in sports that had so much legacy riding on the outcome. It was practically a fairytale.</p>

<p>as in, one speed, poor decision making, taking shots from kd and harden, horrible performances even when scoring 25+, inability to secure the ball, sticking out like a sorethumb among a team with players who knew exactly who they were (thabo harden durant serge collison). </p>

      <label for="l86fxe0" class="commentText"><p>Yep. The fact that there was even much of a debate in 2004 (to my understanding, since I wasn&rsquo;t a huge NBA fan back then) between the Lakers keeping Kobe, then a 25-year-old star who had arguably the highest trade value in the league (when you consider his combination of potential, accomplishments, and proven ability - he averaged 30 ppg in 2002-03 - at the time), and keeping Shaq, a 32-year-old out-of-shape center with a lengthy injury history who wanted a massive contract, speaks to how controversial Kobe&rsquo;s style of play was (in addition to his off-the-court troubles).</p>

      <label for="l85ttrn" class="commentText"><p>I think it’s pretty clearly KD with Embiid as a close second. KD is by far the most jarring. He went from being the beloved young superstar seen as LeBron’s biggest challenger to being the most hated player in the league. People were unironically saying he ruined basketball and the flip was very instantaneous.</p>

<p>Embiid is a crazy one because I can’t really like point when he became so hated. I still remember when we used to feel bad for him because of Simmons and Tobias Harris and his injuries were seen as bad luck more so than used against him. The comment about “I don’t have two MVP’s” definitely hurt but that was 2022, and after they lost to the Heat, most of the Heat was on Harden for not stepping up when Embiid was injured withy he orbital fracture. Did that 2023 MVP race really yank his reputation that badly?</p>

      <label for="l87ecxn" class="commentText"><p>Honestly, I&rsquo;d have to say Kobe&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>During the initial run, Kobe had bad series. He had times when he was slowed significantly.</p>

<ul>
<li>He shot .367 from the field in the 2000 finals with pretty much single coverage from an older Miller while the team focused on covering Shaq.</li>
<li>He shot a paltry .401 against Aarom McKie the next year in the finals</li>
<li>In 2003, he shot .430 in the first round and .434 when they got bounced in the second round.</li>
<li>In 04, he shot .386 in round one, .414 in the conference finals with and old Sprewell covering him, and a paltry .381 in the finals, and all the while kept hoisting up more shots that Shaq</li>
</ul>

<p>At that time, people would often point to Kobe ball hoggery, his failure (yes failure) to rise up to the big shots. One of the most famous shots in that part of his career for the Lakers was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iEF6JXeZqI" target="_blank">Horry&rsquo;s 3 pointer at the buzzer, which was only possible because Kobe first brick a shot.</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-u4pIQyjfE" target="_blank">Fisher hit another of the most famous shots from that Lakers era</a>.</p>

<p>There was a commonly held belief that Kobe was a ball hog, that he had an attitude problem, that he split up a dynasty because of ego, that he needed other people to hit big shots, and he came up short in big games.</p>

<p>And yes, that was all part of the narrative back then. A lot of people thought the Lakers chose wrong by sticking with Kobe instead of Shaq.</p>

<p>Yes, people were awed by his amazing individual performances in in 2006, but it wasn&rsquo;t until he finally returned to the finals and finally won a championship without Shaq that those views thawed.</p>

<p>Nobody was putting Kobe int he conversation as the GOAT, even then. He was seen as Jordan light. Every thing Kobe did Jordan did better. Kobe wasn&rsquo;t the best player on three of his championship teams. Kobe only had one three peat. Kobe was a great defender? Jordan was a DPOY. Kobe was an MVP. Jordan was a 5X MVP.</p>

<p>Now, since Kobe&rsquo;s passed, people suddenly start talking like he is in the GOAT conversation. Mean while, if LeBron hadn&rsquo;t won FMPV in his first two title run and had shot so poorly in multiple series, he&rsquo;d be shit on like you wouldn&rsquo;t believe. If you bring that up about Kobe now, you&rsquo;re a &lsquo;hater.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d have to say, that if perhaps the biggest turnaround in a player&rsquo;s reputation that I&rsquo;ve seen. I mean, Kobe was an absolute asshole to teammates, came up short a lot, was often bailed out by teammates, and EVERYBODY would concede to that in the summer of 2004. People talking like Kobe is int he GOAT conversation now when 10 years ago a lot of people wouldn&rsquo;t even have him in their top ten. Kareem, LeBron, Jordan get most people&rsquo;s top three in whatever order, then you have Bird, Magic, Russell, Wilt, Shaq, Duncan with people then deciding if that 10 spot should go to Kobe, Hakeem, Oscar, Robinson, Dr. J.</p>

<p>Now when you include KD, Curry, Jokic in the conversation as it moves forward, Kobe seems to be moving UP the list rather than being moved back.</p>

<p>The latest “he’s calmed down and just focused on hoopin” narrative that’s come out from media this playoffs has been refreshing</p>

<p>I think he’s a very eclectic guy (maybe most in league) that has hall of fame level talent or even best to ever do it level talent in some areas (as a guard finishing inside, handles, etc), and it’s led to this wild ride of the player and the person merging as he has aged</p>
