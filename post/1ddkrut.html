      <p>Was thinking about KD and this occurred to me. He went from an almost universally-liked small market guy <a href="https://hot-town-images.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/kwtv/production/2013/January/3/kd-is-not-nice-according-to-nike.1357240541000-1.jpeg" target="_blank">(so much so that Nike created a whole press campaign parodying this idea)</a> to being perceived as a serial malcontent and lightning rod for haters.</p>

<p>Who else (positive or negative) has flipped their public perception the most?</p>

<p>Kyrie&rsquo;s reputation has been a rollercoaster as well.</p>

      <label for="l85pv9g" class="commentText"><p>Tbh you can tell how young people here are because people don’t mention Lebron. He was really liked in the 2000s. He was funny, childlike, high flying and kinda like the golden child. He was like The Rock in WWE during the late 90s/very early 2000s</p>

<p>Then he went to Miami and he became the villain. Everyone (including me) wanted to see him lose.</p>

<p>Then he went back to Cleveland and suddenly it’s like he became the good guy again. I was rooting for him and happy to see him win a championship for Cleveland (he played his ass off in that last game where they win against GSW). It was like he was the good guy.</p>

<p>Then he went to LA and tbh no one really cared too much at that point. He’s kinda in the middle now. Not a hero in the league but not a villain either. He’s in his MJ Wizards era (he’s way more dominant that MJ was at the end of his career, but you get the point)</p>

I&rsquo;m sure most have forgotten or aren&rsquo;t even aware of the narratives that surrounded him prior to his first chip. During those ringless 8 years, he was considered unserious, unclutch, passive, no post game, and a broken jumpshot. He&rsquo;s pretty much the exact opposite of that now.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people also liked the villain arc cause of how the cavs were fumbling in making a team around a generational talent.</p>

<p>This is the main difference with the KD move.</p>

<p>KD&rsquo;s OKC was up 3-1 in the western conference against the Warriors.</p>

<p>Edit:<br>
Yes villain Lebron was still widely hated but its not as unanimous as KD&rsquo;s bitch move.</p>

<p>And comparing LeBron now to Wizards MJ is absurd.  LeBron won a championship in LA, he was in the conference finals last season, he’s still an All-NBA selection, he’s still the leading All Star vote getter in his conference, and he’s the still most popular American athlete in the world.  That is definitely not Wizards era MJ, where fat MJ sucked, the Wizards sucked and never made the playoffs, and fat MJ was not All-NBA selection nor the leading all star vote getter for his conference.</p>

      <label for="l87ciqp" class="commentText"><p>Wizards MJ seemingly sucked in comparison to the MJ everybody was used to seeing but he came back after having not played pro sports for three seasons, on bum knees and broken ribs thanks to Ron Artest. It is about as bad a situation as you would ever hope to be in entering an NBA season.<br>
You really can&rsquo;t emphasise enough how difficult it is to come back to pro sports after several years of living a retired life of golf, whiskey and cigars let alone with everything else he was going through. Yet he dropped 30 in just his <em>second game back</em> and 40 in his 9th game. He had a 50 point game, at the time the oldest player to do that, and then followed it up with a 45 point game. A couple of weeks later he would have back to back 40 point games again. LeBron never had back to back 40 point games this season. MJ had the &lsquo;sucky&rsquo; Wizards in the top four or five in the East and was averaging 27+ at one stage. This on a team struggling to put up 90 a night. And he didn&rsquo;t have a dominant big man to help him like AD. But here you are glamourising LeBron for averaging 25 on a team pushing 120 a night in probably the most offense friendly era in league history.<br>
Once Jordan&rsquo;s knees gave up on him for good it limited him basically to being a mid range shooter almost exclusively yet he still did that at over 40%. LeBron shot 30% from midrange this season.<br>
Sure, nobody should pretend Jordan was a better player at that age but circumstances simply did not allow him to be. But to pretend he was some scrub and childishly refer to him as &lsquo;Fat MJ&rsquo; just makes you look like you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.</p>

Like the other guy said Lebron isn’t a hero or a villain right now, he’s kinda just an old guy (that’s still playing really well mind you) who everybody knows is gonna be retiring not too long from now.</p>

Now nobody I know will watch Sixers games anymore because he&rsquo;s a mopey foul merchant that topples over when so much as breathed on.

For Jimmy to stay, he wanted Ben Simmons and Brett Brown gone, which nobody was ready to do at that point.  Tobias Harris was the desperation play, but nobody chose him over Jimmy Butler.

      <label for="l8865iz" class="commentText"><p>Yeah Russ was usually blamed for the Thunders short comings. The one time a reporter blamed KD for a loss basically everyone in Oklahoma wanted to kill that guy. I still remember when Mark Cuban called Russ “not a superstar” while he was still in his prime or when Magic Johnson said Russ was the worst PG to ever play in the finals or something to that effect. It’s just that Russ used to have talent to make people take back what they said about him, now that he’s older he can’t really do that.</p>

      <label for="l88v7t5" class="commentText"><p>Idk, I think because of his &ldquo;love&rdquo; bump during the KD to the warriors days, I think it sort of skews our perception of what Westbrook used to be considered as.</p>

<p>He was regularly criticized for making poor decisions, and being reckless and at time selfish. I mean, it&rsquo;s not like KD just decided one day that he didn&rsquo;t like Russ, he had to deal with his just bad decision making for years. </p>

<p>He&rsquo;s always been heavily criticized for playing reckless and that wasn&rsquo;t just post KD leaving. Dudes always been that way. It&rsquo;s why he was never considered the best PG in the league at any time, meanwhile averaging triple doubles. Because we all knew he wasn&rsquo;t and that as an actual true PG he was far too turnover/dead possession prone.</p>

      <label for="l894ko1" class="commentText"><p>&lsquo;Sheed Wallace is another example from those &ldquo;Jailblazers&rdquo; teams. Rasheed was among the smartest players in the league, really a professional. (He also had the best tattoo I&rsquo;ve seen: Akhenaton, on his shoulder.) But the guy drew technicals, and the team needed to be broken up, so he was the scapegoat.</p>

<p>Isaiah &ldquo;J.R.&rdquo; Rider should have been the poster boy for everything that was wrong in Portland: They went and got talent without taking into account &ldquo;chemistry&rdquo; or off court troubles, and it burned them. But Rasheed Wallace wasn&rsquo;t the problem, and his vindication in Detroit goes to that.</p>

<p>Then his off court stuff started coming out, and his squeaky clean fun loving marketable persona clashed very harshly with the amount of baby momma drama he had out there.</p>

<p>If he reaches superstardom, this won’t matter to some people. Think about Curry for example, especially early in his career, there really wasn’t much ammo to use against him before the 2016 Finals. And he was similarly a guy who had goofy non-confrontational celebrations and always looked like he was having a good time. Still had plenty of haters.</p>

      <label for="l85i5lh" class="commentText"><p>LeBron should be up there. Hyped as the chosen one. I think a lot of people either liked him or mocked him. Laker fans hated him because of the constant LeBron-Kobe comparisons. Then after LeDecision everyone hated him (the shit he got after the 2011 finals). He returned to the Cavs and after the 2016 finals, everyone saw him as one of the GOATs (imo he is). Battling vs the KD-Warriors had everyone rooting for him, and when he signed with the Lakers, he turned a whole fanbase that hated him into loving him.</p>

<p>He and his reputation have had a lot of twists and pivots throughout his career (20+ years will do that), but I actually don’t think his reputation now is all that different than I would have predicted 20 years ago.</p>

<p>He’s effectively lived up the hype, putting himself legitimately in the GOAT conversation. He had the Miami decision that made a number of people angry, but his return to Cleveland and eventual title there salved much of that frustration. He has his haters and stans, but I feel like much of the conversation now is just about how great he has been and how much we should appreciate what he’s done/is doing.</p>

      <label for="l86fxe0" class="commentText"><p>Yep. The fact that there was even much of a debate in 2004 (to my understanding, since I wasn&rsquo;t a huge NBA fan back then) between the Lakers keeping Kobe, then a 25-year-old star who had arguably the highest trade value in the league (when you consider his combination of potential, accomplishments, and proven ability - he averaged 30 ppg in 2002-03 - at the time), and keeping Shaq, a 32-year-old out-of-shape center with a lengthy injury history who wanted a massive contract, speaks to how controversial Kobe&rsquo;s style of play was (in addition to his off-the-court troubles).</p>

      <label for="l88bc1g" class="commentText"><p>To be fair, Kobe&rsquo;s death has done a lot of heavy lifting when it comes to his reputation outside the Lakers fan base.</p>

<p>NBA players revered him as their generation&rsquo;s MJ, but he was not liked by most fan bases and basketball fans.</p>

<p>His tragic death changed that. Hell, even Shaq is now calling Kobe the better player. And he never said that before that event.</p>

      <label for="l88fsyr" class="commentText"><p>Over the last few years of his career, when injuries took their toll and the Lakers descended into NBA purgatory, Kobe&rsquo;s reputation shifted, largely because (in my view) he made a calculated effort to turn his competitiveness into a reputational asset rather than what many observers (including myself) saw as the driving force behind his selfish and sometimes mean-spirited style of play.</p>

<p>When he dropped 60 in his last game, that was a bona fide cultural event. It was the same night as the Warriors breaking the regular season win record and yet Kobe&rsquo;s last hurrah became a global celebration of him and the Mamba mentality. The circumstances of his death magnified all of that and more.</p>

<p>I admire Kobe in many respects. But when you account for some of the thornier aspects of his persona and some holes in his basketball resume, I think the Kobe hagiography is circumspect. To me, it reflects some not-so-great aspects of American society (mainly the individualist, pull yourself up by your bootstraps mentality).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d argue for a player who basically had NO reputation (or even a negative one before he came to the league) -  Jokic.</p>

<p>Dude was absolutely unknown. Came into the league, barely spoken about. Got called slow, fat, lazy and uninterested. Couldn&rsquo;t score or defend.</p>

<p>Today? He is considered the best player in the world, one of the best conditioned athletes in the league (for his size), at top 25 guy all-time, one of the greatest passers of all-time, an elite scorer and solid defender.</p>

<p>Also, the greatest draft pick of all time.</p>

      <label for="l85ttrn" class="commentText"><p>I think it’s pretty clearly KD with Embiid as a close second. KD is by far the most jarring. He went from being the beloved young superstar seen as LeBron’s biggest challenger to being the most hated player in the league. People were unironically saying he ruined basketball and the flip was very instantaneous.</p>

<p>Embiid is a crazy one because I can’t really like point when he became so hated. I still remember when we used to feel bad for him because of Simmons and Tobias Harris and his injuries were seen as bad luck more so than used against him. The comment about “I don’t have two MVP’s” definitely hurt but that was 2022, and after they lost to the Heat, most of the Heat was on Harden for not stepping up when Embiid was injured withy he orbital fracture. Did that 2023 MVP race really yank his reputation that badly?</p>

<p>Kd was a good example of good to bad, whats the best bad to good? Not sure I can think of much, Ron Artest comes to mind. Loved watching the guys antics from the start. Definitely had an interesting story going from the malice in the palace to mellowing out some and advocating for world peace. </p>

      <label for="l87ecxn" class="commentText"><p>Honestly, I&rsquo;d have to say Kobe&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>During the initial run, Kobe had bad series. He had times when he was slowed significantly.</p>

<ul>
<li>He shot .367 from the field in the 2000 finals with pretty much single coverage from an older Miller while the team focused on covering Shaq.</li>
<li>He shot a paltry .401 against Aarom McKie the next year in the finals</li>
<li>In 2003, he shot .430 in the first round and .434 when they got bounced in the second round.</li>
<li>In 04, he shot .386 in round one, .414 in the conference finals with and old Sprewell covering him, and a paltry .381 in the finals, and all the while kept hoisting up more shots that Shaq</li>
</ul>

<p>At that time, people would often point to Kobe ball hoggery, his failure (yes failure) to rise up to the big shots. One of the most famous shots in that part of his career for the Lakers was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iEF6JXeZqI" target="_blank">Horry&rsquo;s 3 pointer at the buzzer, which was only possible because Kobe first brick a shot.</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-u4pIQyjfE" target="_blank">Fisher hit another of the most famous shots from that Lakers era</a>.</p>

<p>There was a commonly held belief that Kobe was a ball hog, that he had an attitude problem, that he split up a dynasty because of ego, that he needed other people to hit big shots, and he came up short in big games.</p>

<p>And yes, that was all part of the narrative back then. A lot of people thought the Lakers chose wrong by sticking with Kobe instead of Shaq.</p>

<p>Yes, people were awed by his amazing individual performances in in 2006, but it wasn&rsquo;t until he finally returned to the finals and finally won a championship without Shaq that those views thawed.</p>

<p>Nobody was putting Kobe int he conversation as the GOAT, even then. He was seen as Jordan light. Every thing Kobe did Jordan did better. Kobe wasn&rsquo;t the best player on three of his championship teams. Kobe only had one three peat. Kobe was a great defender? Jordan was a DPOY. Kobe was an MVP. Jordan was a 5X MVP.</p>

<p>Now, since Kobe&rsquo;s passed, people suddenly start talking like he is in the GOAT conversation. Mean while, if LeBron hadn&rsquo;t won FMPV in his first two title run and had shot so poorly in multiple series, he&rsquo;d be shit on like you wouldn&rsquo;t believe. If you bring that up about Kobe now, you&rsquo;re a &lsquo;hater.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d have to say, that if perhaps the biggest turnaround in a player&rsquo;s reputation that I&rsquo;ve seen. I mean, Kobe was an absolute asshole to teammates, came up short a lot, was often bailed out by teammates, and EVERYBODY would concede to that in the summer of 2004. People talking like Kobe is int he GOAT conversation now when 10 years ago a lot of people wouldn&rsquo;t even have him in their top ten. Kareem, LeBron, Jordan get most people&rsquo;s top three in whatever order, then you have Bird, Magic, Russell, Wilt, Shaq, Duncan with people then deciding if that 10 spot should go to Kobe, Hakeem, Oscar, Robinson, Dr. J.</p>

<p>Now when you include KD, Curry, Jokic in the conversation as it moves forward, Kobe seems to be moving UP the list rather than being moved back.</p>

      <label for="l89211c" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not that he was &lsquo;likely&rsquo; a rapist; he raped somebody. That&rsquo;s a fact.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like Kobe at all myself because he just always seemed like an arrogant ass. When that news came out, I was done with him.</p>

<p>But if I bring that up when assessing his basketball skill and resume, I just get flooded with comments from rape apologists who start lambasting the survivor of the assault and defending Kobe by saying it didn&rsquo;t happen, despite the fact that he released a statement that it did.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on board with what you said a 100%.</p>

      <label for="l85jvu1" class="commentText"><p>Think it has to be Kyrie, if I listed out all the turns he’s had you could publish that post as a novel</p>

<p>The latest “he’s calmed down and just focused on hoopin” narrative that’s come out from media this playoffs has been refreshing</p>

<p>I think he’s a very eclectic guy (maybe most in league) that has hall of fame level talent or even best to ever do it level talent in some areas (as a guard finishing inside, handles, etc), and it’s led to this wild ride of the player and the person merging as he has aged</p>
