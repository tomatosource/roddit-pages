</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>pbpstats.com offers exact possession counts and exact TS% calculations - sources like basketball reference estimate both figures. The nice thing about basketball reference is those estimates go back to the pre-play by play era, but in this case we&rsquo;ll just look at recent NBA history.</p>

<p>Using this data, I calculated the following metrics for each player&rsquo;s postseason career:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Points Per 75 Possessions</strong>: Simply the total points they scored divided by the total possessions they were on the court for, multiplied by 75 to give us a nice looking number. Why are we adjusting for possessions? Different teams play at different paces, different years had different average paces, players might get fewer minutes because of a blowout or because of an injury, etc&hellip; all this stuff impacts PPG. For this, I am interested in what happens at a posession level.</li>
<li><strong>Defense-Adjusted rTS%</strong>: Relative true shooting is typically calculated as a player&rsquo;s TS% minus league average TS%. This is practical for the regular season, but with limited opponents in the postseason, I think the TS% allowed by the teams you faced is more important. So for this study, we calculate rTS% as a player&rsquo;s TS% minus the TS% allowed by the opponent in the regular season. If you Player A plays a playoff series against an elite defense and Player B plays a playoff series against a trash defense, this should be accounted for.</li>
</ul>

<p>This was mostly automated but I had to pick players one-by-one to do the calculations for. Of the players I chose, here are those with <strong>at least 5000 possessions played</strong>, sorted by PP75.</p>

<p>Note that for older players like Kobe Bryant, full postseason careers are not included because the earliest season with this data is 2000-01. I excluded some great players like Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal because too much of their prime would&rsquo;ve been excluded for it to really be fair - I think everyone here has their prime fairly captured, though.</p>

      <label for="ll0gfy9" class="commentText"><p>thanks</p>

<p>I have a question, since you&rsquo;re someone who is interested enough in this type of data to go through all the trouble like I did haha</p>

<p>right now i show TS Add and TS Add per 100 starting at 0 rTS, but my intuition that starting at -1 rTS or -2 rTS is a more fair representation of value created (although maybe confusing for users).</p>

<p>what do you think makes sense?</p>

<p>30 points per 75 at 0 rTS almost always still has positive offensive value in a vacuum (because high usage stars are often creating the necessary unassisted shots a team takes which are lower efficiency than assisted ones), but would show up as 0 TS Add in my calculations here which seems wrong.</p>

<p>Then there are the positional concerns (which maybe I can just ignore) &ndash; feel pretty strongly that 30 pp75 on 0 rTS on a PG is better than 30 pp75 on 0 rTS on a Center, because typically centers have a higher rTS to begin with for a few reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>average center gets more putback opportunities which juice all center&rsquo;s scoring efficiency (relative to the league).  so 30 pp75 0 rTS on a center includes all those high efficiency putbacks whereas the 30pp75 0 rTS on a PG still has his center boosting the team efficiency through putback.</p></li>

<li><p>center&rsquo;s shots tend to be more assisted</p></li>

<li><p>offensive rebound rates can vary based on shot diet used to achieve 30 ppg.  (heavy midrange centers are worse than their value).  There&rsquo;s a lot more i could say about this but basically you can run heavy offensive rebounding lineups around a kobe/AI/jalen brunson type whereas it&rsquo;s really do that around Embiid.  30pp75 0 rTS in a heavy ORB% lineup is more value than 0 rTS in a low ORB% lineup.</p></li>

      <label for="ll0wxic" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I think all of these concerns are accurate and fair, I suppose the question is how much you want to account for (i.e. whether they’re in the scope of what you’re trying to measure) and what the best way to account for it is. Sometimes too many adjustments makes a metric less intuitive while not adding a whole lot of value.</p>

<p>Though the rTS level thing wouldn’t fall under that bucket. I think you could do an approach like VORP where a replacement level player is defined as -2.0 BPM. Comes down to what you want to count as replacement … a quick look at recent data makes it seem that about a third of the league has a rTS% &amp;lt;= -1%? Though that’s after I filtered out low minute guys which are arguably the replacement guys we’re concerned with to begin with … so should look deeper into it but point is that there ought to be justification for the value picked. I do agree that a nonzero value makes sense.</p>

<p>I was thinking about % of shots assisted as well. I thought about having a flexible model for expected TS% based on a regression on % of shots assisted (perhaps differentiating between 2pt shots assisted and 3pt shots assisted, or rim shots assisted).</p>

<p>The OREB stuff is certainly a good point … honestly pretty complicated one and I dunno how to best think about it lol. I think to address that you’d need to get some sort of xOREB% measure for players based on their shot diet. I mean I suppose you could just adjust it based on some binary positional variable(s), but I think an approach flexible to how players actually play would be useful in a league where position is increasingly flexible.</p>

<p>I dunno, I’m always unsure about this stuff bc on one level all the other considerations are like, correct, but I also don’t know if trying to adjust for that is in the scope of such a metric. Like do I want to adjust for these things or just have a measure of how many points players scored with their efficiency relative to the defense they faced?</p>

<p>Anyway this was a lot of rambling lol, your judgement is better than mine and I dunno how I’d want to handle it frankly.</p>

I thought about having a flexible model for expected TS% based on a regression on % of shots assisted (perhaps differentiating between 2pt shots assisted and 3pt shots assisted, or rim shots assisted).&rdquo;</p>

<p>A adjusted rTS based on a TS usage curve factoring assisted vs unassisted is definitely interesting to me, i&rsquo;ve thought about it quite a bit but haven&rsquo;t done any work on it.</p>

<p>I would just be hesitant to give too much credit to a player who scores well relative to their unassisted rate but is actively influencing the team to have less assisted shots (by either not creating enough assisted shots for his teammates relative to his on-ball % or just not finding the assisted shots for himself).</p>

<p>assisted shots are generally higher efficiency, which is why &lsquo;gunners&rsquo; tend to have lower orapm than their boxscore stats indicate.</p>

<p>basically the way i feel like you can account for this is to just put a ceiling on how much extra credit you will give a player for their shot diet being unassisted in a rTS calculation.  maybe this is out of scope but i&rsquo;m just hesitant to reward guys who produce lower shot quality than they need to. (are you a tough shot maker or a tough shot creator?)</p>

      <label for="ll1300m" class="commentText"><p>Yeah ultimately when you are trying to assign credit based on simple box score stats you run into the wall of (1) not having enough data to generate a proper usage model so most of the &ldquo;events&rdquo; you care about are invisible and can&rsquo;t be inferred, (2) not having a shot quality model either, (3) not even necessarily knowing what the player&rsquo;s intended role in the offense was and there being too much noise and multicollinearity to easily extract the player&rsquo;s contribution through more indirect means (if your job is to initiate the offense and there are four 40% three point shooters on your team, in a vacuum people are just going to be asking why you&rsquo;re taking so many shots&hellip;).  Honestly, it is <em>shocking</em> to me that RAPM works as well as it does with how noisy and limited the information that goes into it is (we know it does work pretty well because players usually <em>do</em> preserve their RAPM when they change teams).  I think it&rsquo;s because NBA coaching on the whole is pretty good and coaches tend to put their guys in similar roles and situations to succeed, so we never see the pathological cases for RAPM like an all center lineup or a guy having 50% possessions high usage / 50% low usage.</p>

      <label for="ll14nxi" class="commentText"><p>yeah on the same page there, not actually sure it’s something that should be considered.</p>

<p>example that comes to mind for me is harden v curry. harden’s % of fg ast’d in playoffs is 0.15 on 2s and 0.35 on 3s, while curry’s is 0.30 and 0.53 respectively. relatively significant difference … how much should we care about that? some might argue that neither of them could replicate the other’s playstyle so ultimately what matters is what they accomplish with the way they actually play. so perhaps it’s fine to compare them 1:1 without adjustment.</p>

      <label for="ll0wr44" class="commentText"><p>so i haven&rsquo;t done the four factor plus minus breakdown on this site yet so if you&rsquo;re looking at the 28 year tables or the FF rapm they are all the RA-FF percentages.  there is something in dev on the compare tab comparing plus minus FF values but it&rsquo;s not finished.</p>

<p>the 28 year ra-fourfactors don&rsquo;t predict the age adjusted 28 year rapm nearly as well as the non age adjusted 28 year rapm, because the four factors themselves are not age adjusted</p>

<p>but those four factors do predict a player&rsquo;s rapm with 0.95 r^2, which is pretty incredible considering we are using a EFG factor and not a TS factor.  the FTR factor is not going to be as predictive of rapm on offense because freethrow percentage is not incorporated at all.  so someone who averages 15 FTA per 100 at 90% FT% may have a high RA-FTR and ORAPM but the four factors wouldn&rsquo;t predict the ORAPM well for that player.</p>

<p>The weights make a lot of sense to me because they mostly match the expected ones you could come up with yourself doing some napkin math, 1% EFG = 1.6 points per 100, 1% TOV = ~1-1.1 point per 100 (depends on era, turnover value is going up as league average ortg increases), 1% ORB = ~.45 points per 100, 1 FTR = .1-.15 per 100.</p>

<p>to me it just provides an incredible framework for evaluating a player, because it allows you to audit the rapm further and see whats driving it.  additionally it gives you some good estimates of what a player&rsquo;s value can be worth in each area.  the four factor approach allows us to have a more nuanced discussion about player value.  ie, which of the areas is a player actually contributing and how much.  things like turnovers and rebounding can swing a player&rsquo;s value considerably.</p>

<p>for instance, i am very confident shai is reducing his teams turnover rate on offense by at least 2%, and i have a good idea of what that&rsquo;s worth in net rating (around +2).   there&rsquo;s a lot of evidence to support that in his boxscore and lineup data.  to me that&rsquo;s a lot more valuable than saying someone has a 13% turnover rate, or an 8% turnover rate.  those are just numbers.  they don&rsquo;t track to anything concrete about the scoreboard.</p>

<p>This actually doesn&rsquo;t surprise me, from what work I did do FTR&rsquo;s contribution is by far the hardest part to estimate, especially if you&rsquo;re trying to be predictive (since you don&rsquo;t want the &ldquo;real&rdquo; TS%, you definitely want it to be adjusted LA-RAPM style&ndash;but now you have to separately track FTs coming from you and from your teammates and it just gets a bit messy, though I&rsquo;m sure it would be easier if you&rsquo;re doing the RAPM calculation yourself).  Ultimately I do think it matters, but probably not as much as the other factors, and it takes way more work than correlating the other stuff to ppp, so I&rsquo;m not that surprised people have left it alone.  It&rsquo;s like trying to take non-two-shot FTA attempts into account &ldquo;properly&rdquo; rather than just fudging, it is definitely possible and matters a lot in the theoretical framework, but ultimately those are under 10% of FTAs or something&hellip; (I actually want to say under 5)</p>

<p>The main reason I don&rsquo;t just like using weights and blindly regressing is that (1) we should have a better model of how those things contribute to points scored than just guessing, at least on a team level (like we <em>do</em> know how possessions work&hellip;), and (2) those weights seem highly likely to change over time as the contributions of most of that stuff to ppp are not actually linear (let&rsquo;s ignore for the moment that ppp and RAPM themselves aren&rsquo;t really real random variables that can vary arbitrarily in either direction).  Are they nonlinear enough that they can&rsquo;t be approximated as linear within their actual range of values?  Maybe, maybe not, but the point is someone needs to actually do the math to find out&hellip; to me the fact that people can&rsquo;t seem to get them to age adjust properly and they work best within a few seasons is a pretty big red flag though.</p>

<p>Part of my concern here is that I do <em>not</em> think the four factors are uncorrelated in this way&hellip; reducing turnovers is always a good thing in a vacuum but many of the players who reduce TOV% a lot do so <em>because</em> they tend to end possessions by shooting a lot&ndash;a missed shot doesn&rsquo;t count as a turnover.  I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s necessarily the case with Shai and there is certainly value in creating a shot at all even if it&rsquo;s a bad one, but it creates problems blindly regressing like this.  See also the tradeoff between 3PAr and ORB% that you&rsquo;ve discussed a lot.</p>

      <label for="ll173ek" class="commentText"><p>right, the four factor values are not perfectly linear. also, this approach is just an estimate that provides us an estimate of the breakdown of what&rsquo;s contributing to the scoreboard moving.</p>

<p>1% tov is worth more high EFG and ORB environments.  ORB is worth less in high EFG environments.  EFG is worth more in low tov and high orb environments.  on the whole i dont think they are nonlinear enough to abandon the approach.</p>

<p>came across this link allowing you to see different values of four factors, haven&rsquo;t messed with it a ton but can sensitivity test things.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qkvMmpmpaRBHFzWfEa6DgJaTGw8dnP5vg8IaZ15mIds/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qkvMmpmpaRBHFzWfEa6DgJaTGw8dnP5vg8IaZ15mIds/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>

<p>Tyus Jones is a notable turnover reducer (also orb reducer). He&rsquo;s was in a low efg environment in Washington and a mid efg environment in Memphis.  Does a turnover reducer like him have more value in phoenix next to Booker and Durant (high EFG guys)?  Will he have less on-ball time in phoenix though?  turnover reduction tends to scale with load/on-ball time.</p>

<p>interesting questions to ask.  so actually we can think about how a player &lsquo;fits&rsquo; on certain teams by how their four factor profile may benefit the team relative to their old context (mathematically).</p>

<p>right, shai does shoot a lot.  he&rsquo;s a high rTS, low turnover offensive engine with a medium assist rate.  this is the michael jordan approach and to lesser extent kobe bryant approach.  it&rsquo;s one of the benefits of having a high usage player on your team.  it reduces team turnovers by quite a bit.  jordan has the best RA-oTOV of all time in his 4 years post 96.</p>

<p>what you&rsquo;re really getting at is that you may be reducing turnovers but also other positive things as well.  you average less bad pass turnovers but don&rsquo;t create as many rim assists or attempts. bad pass turnovers and rim assists are correlated yeah? perhaps Shai&rsquo;s playmaking value is weak, i think that&rsquo;s something we can analyze separate from his turnovers.</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t see why i can&rsquo;t separate that out for primary guys.  i can say that trae young provides more playmaking value which is evidenced by his high rim assists / alley oop assists but comes at a cost of turnovers.  i think we could actually compare shai and trae through the lens of (scoring value / playmaking value / turnover value) here and get some useful numbers.</p>

<p>the consistency between the value of a turnover in regressions like bpm, ra-four factors onto rapm, four factors onto ortg just gives me confidence that it&rsquo;s a fairly clean stat, similar to steals.  there&rsquo;s &lsquo;gambling&rsquo; for steals, but the losses of that gambling will show up in a players RA-EFG over time, so i don&rsquo;t see a need to be super worried about it, and yet, in nearly every regression steals are worth more than their direct value.  there&rsquo;s also some potential counterbalance where players who steal the ball are also threats on the court which may lower EFG in a passive way.</p>

<p>ORBs are much less clean i agree because of spacing concerns.</p>

<p>in any case nice chatting have to go now</p>

<p>At a team level turnovers are definitely a clean stat modulo the nonlinear effects you mentioned, but we can know that without doing any regression analysis since that&rsquo;s just how basketball works.  As for BPM and RA-4-factors having similar coefficients to each other&hellip; they are both linear RAPM estimators so it&rsquo;s not exactly a mystery why they would converge to the same values it is?  The question for me is how highly correlated TOV% is with the other factors, not whether it explains RAPM <em>in combination</em> with the other factors or whether different regressions tend to find similar coefficients (which just mean they&rsquo;re using similar regression methods&ndash;something that&rsquo;s virtually guaranteed, considering there are very active people online who will tell you you&rsquo;re doing it wrong if yoU even do something as innocuous as use a slightly different value of lambda to calculate RAPM).</p>

<p>(FWIW, I think you are dead on about steals&ndash;I think they are just highly valuable, and most of the players who are bad defenders with high steal rates would be even worse without the high steal rate.  But forced defensive turnovers are very different from offensive turnovers in this regard IMO).</p>

<p>I think my concerns come more from what you&rsquo;re getting at talking about Tyus (he&rsquo;s a turnover reducer when he has the ball a lot, but <em>should</em> he have it a lot on Phoenix?).  Thinking about things from first principles, TOV% impact must necessarily be so highly tied to time of possession that it should be almost impossible to even talk about it as a factor without talking about it relative to expected usage.  From a predictive standpoint, which is what I care about, I want to divide turnover impact (on offense at least) into three components: TOV%/time of possession (how good are you at avoiding turning the ball over <em>when you have it</em>?), &ldquo;time of possession impact&rdquo; (this is somewhere IMO you just cannot use linear regression since the total time of possession is very much bounded, so it will have to use a slightly different framework to talk about your impact on teammates&rsquo; time of possession or something), and impact on teammate TOV% (what things do you to prevent turnovers when you DON&rsquo;T have the ball?).  This sort of granular breakdown would IMO much more ideal for actually analyzing what&rsquo;s going on on the court and thinking about what happens when a player changes contexts&hellip; unfortunately I think computing this even semi accurately would probably require access to tracking data, but I&rsquo;m hoping someone has clever ideas to get around this.</p>

      <label for="ll1nucb" class="commentText"><p>Also.  IMO, I think this is a &ldquo;is this model useful or accurate&rdquo; thing in part.  Because to me, a model that thinks a player who jacks up a shot from halfcourt every time he rebounds the ball and misses virtually all of them (therefore is very obviously <em>not</em> creating value with their accompanying TOV% reduction) is really good, is a model that is obviously wrong&hellip; the question is just at what point the model breaks down rather than <em>whether</em> it breaks down.  If we could use a model that handled the obviously silly cases correctly (and I think it should be possible, especially since there are many fewer computational limitations than there were when RAPM and the four factors were first devised), it would give me much more confidence it was also handing real world stuff correctly.</p>

      <label for="ll1syhs" class="commentText"><p>this player is valuable in the turnover game
but massively negative in the efg game</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t really see the issue here.  i mean sure at some extreme where team efg is super low the benefit of the reduction of turnover will then be less.  (actually you could actually incorporate the efg of the lineup when calculating the &lsquo;value&rsquo; of the turnover reduction.)  30% efg lineups w/ 0% turnover rate is better than 30% on 15% turnover rate.  so in this extreme you can still adjust for that.  and i could come to apportioning of the value of causing your team to go from 50% efg to 30% efg and 15% tov to 0% tov.  will it be perfect? no but pretty reasonable.  maybe i should say it this way &ndash; you can be a positive in the turnover game and still be a negative player.  Frank Kaminsky for example.  check his 28 year.  microscopic boxscore turnover rate and great RA-oTOV center but one of the worst o-rebounders boxscore wise and RA-ORB wise in the league as a center.</p>

<p>in reality most teams are near league average ortg or better, i just don&rsquo;t think these types of scenarios are super relevant.</p>

<p>also related to your point about stepping across half court and launching, i wrote this the other day which is kinda relevant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;ok so i think the value of shots is a bit tricky, because there&rsquo;s transition, semi transition, and half court</p>

<p>The best ppp i&rsquo;ve seen for any star (for their lineup) for half court FIRST chance was 1.08.  This includes turnovers, so if your team is 60% TS in the half court (1.2ppp) but turn it over 10% of the time, your half court first chance offense will be (1.2 * 0.9) = 1.08 ppp</p>

<p>so imagine you just walk the ball up the court and pull up from 3 at 36%.. 54% efg/ts..  Doesn&rsquo;t seem that good does it?  i mean it&rsquo;s a -4 rTS shot..</p>

<p>The draw of launching pull up 3s is you reduce the turnover risk massively before the shot.  So if you can guarantee no turnovers and you can pull up from 3 at 36%, (3*.36 = 1.08 ppp)  you are matching the best first chance half court offense in nba history.  Now you are facing nba defenders so there will actually be turnover risk in most scenarios, its hard to hit 36% from 3, and i&rsquo;m oversimplifying here, but i think it demonstrates the value of the pull up 3.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This (and related things) are basically what I&rsquo;m asking for.  Not throwing out the information about turnovers because of random hypotheticals, just making the model being used a bit more precise by making it more coherent with the game of basketball.  RAPM already has woefully large error bounds for a variety of reasons, so I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re in a position to say there&rsquo;s no more work to be done on the base model just because you can predict RAPM well (and like I said I think a lot of the convergence between estimates comes down to what&rsquo;s possible in the space of &ldquo;linear regression on box score stats trying to predict PPP&rdquo; which is a lot narrower than the space of possible predictive models).</p>

      <label for="ll101wk" class="commentText"><p>I have a theory that the NBA game changed with LeBron and post hand checking where people started to use role players to maximize stars rather than vice versa. Like in the most extreme case, AI&rsquo;s teammates were trash on offense because AI being a one man army meant the offense was ok even with no talent around him. In 2008 next to Melo he was actually pretty efficient.</p>

<p>The thinking changed when the Cavs won 66 games with mediocre talent because they had shooters around the best player in the league which let LeBron do things like average 37-8-8 in the ECF (they still ran out of talent but still).</p>

<p>It feels to me like there&rsquo;s less of a negative correlation between volume and efficiency (minus Westbrook lol) relative to the past</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s gonna retire with fucktons of MVPs, maybe a few more chips and ppl in 30 years will still say he was underrated during his run as his stats are just wild.</p>

      <label for="ll3amy4" class="commentText"><p>Hey OP, do we have a dedicated sub or a discord channel where we can talk to others who does this kind of analysis with the data?
I work with data science as my daily job and have been getting into basketball since last year, would really like to spend some time to these analysis (kind of haven&rsquo;t started yet because I think I might require a little bit more knowledge about the game)</p>

      <label for="ll25j9d" class="commentText"><p>I honestly think these comparisons are gonna look silly in the future. Joker plays so much more efficiently and with so much less effort. his longevity, if he wants to keep going, will make sure he&rsquo;s still a top 3 player while Giannis&rsquo;s knees are self imploding after years of abuse</p>
