      <label for="lj8cvif" class="commentText"><p>For a while it felt like punching down and especially as his death was fresh, it wasn’t in good faith.</p>

<p>But the guy has an incredibly complicated legacy. Great basketball player. By all accounts, a great father.</p>

<p>He also did some terrible things, put one woman through hell and was a brutal teammate for most of his career.</p>

<p>We aren’t one part of our personality, we’re all of it. Kobe was who he was. Imperfect. His mistakes were there for the world to see. So were his successes.</p>

<p>It’s just hard to have any kind of discourse about him because people from either side will always go hard in the paint.</p>

Aspects which are not balanced out by the fact that he was a good father and good at a sport.</p>

<p>So yes, FWIW Kobe sucks, Jordan goat.</p>

<p>Basically, Bill Russell says Kobe was the player who took his thoughts on teamwork and leadership the more seriously than anyone else.</p>

      <label for="lj9bqwo" class="commentText"><p>Is it though? You have at worst 2 of the Top 4 players in the entire sport plus very serviceable role players in GP, Malone, Fisher and Rick Fox. Sure, it must have been a headache to deal with those egos, but the actual talent on the court sometimes was too much for other teams to deal with.</p>

<p>I remember when they played against the Spurs that year and man, at some point there&rsquo;s only so much you can do when you are playing against prime Kobe and Shaq, and the Spurs had a great defense.</p>

      <label for="lj9ga6y" class="commentText"><p>Yes. Malone was hobbled. Payton was pretty washed at that point and never fit in well with the offense. Crucially, the chemistry of the team was completely shattered. The Colorado thing hung over everything. At one point during the season Jackson hired a therapist as a consultant to advise on the team&rsquo;s psyche. Their talent obviously got them very far I can&rsquo;t think of any other coach who could have managed something like that as well as Jackson did.</p>

To kind go balance it all out - guys that you couldn&rsquo;t really push around, like Malone, GP, Horace fucking Grant, Rick Fox, Derek Fisher, Byron Russell.  So it wasn&rsquo;t like Shaq and Kobe had free rein, these other guys had a lot of voice and strength in the locker room too.</p>

      <label for="lj9tm3b" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, if you are a fan of the player you&rsquo;ll defend it.  Kobe was a great player, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean he was perfect.  It also doesn&rsquo;t believe his method always worked.  Those Smush Parker teams were pretty bad, but maybe Kobe could have gotten them a step further if he was less of a dick.</p>

      <label for="lj9p0xj" class="commentText"><p>There was a great interview back in 2015 with Chuck Klosterman where Kobe explained his mindset.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have &ldquo;like minds.&rdquo; You know, I&rsquo;ve been fortunate to play in Los Angeles, where there are a lot of people like me. Actors. Musicians. Businessmen. Obsessives. People who feel like God put them on earth to do whatever it is that they do. Now, do we have time to build great relationships? Do we have time to build great friendships? No. Do we have time to socialize and to hangout aimlessly? No. Do we want to do that? No. We want to work. I enjoy working.</p>

<p>I have friends. But being a &ldquo;great friend&rdquo; is something I will never be. I can be a &ldquo;good&rdquo; friend. But not a &ldquo;great&rdquo; friend. A great friend will call you every day and remember your birthday. I&rsquo;ll get so wrapped up in my s&ndash;t, I&rsquo;ll never remember that stuff. And the people who are my friends understand this, and they&rsquo;re usually the same way. You gravitate toward people who are like you. But the kind of relationships you see in movies—that&rsquo;s impossible for me. I have good relationships with players around the league. LeBron and I will text every now and then. KG and I will text every now and then. But in terms of having one of those great, bonding friendships—that&rsquo;s something I will probably never have. And it&rsquo;s not some smug thing. It&rsquo;s a weakness. &hellip; It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need friends because I&rsquo;m so strong.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a weakness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, Kobe was just so obsessive about winning that he thought that anyone else who wasn&rsquo;t also obsessive like him wasn&rsquo;t worth his time and he would actively distance himself through antisocial behavior so that he could focus on the things he cares about. It&rsquo;s definitely a fucked up mindset to have and frankly a huge testament to Pau that he was able to break through Kobe&rsquo;s toxic shell.</p>

      <label for="ljbul1t" class="commentText"><p>Most of it seems to have come from being an outcast as a black kid in Italy and then likely moving to America and being an outcast again for being the weird Italian kid, then being drafted at 18 and being an outcast for being a kid around a bunch of grown men who liked to party and bang groupies. Basketball was probably his only “friend” and so he got used to it and let it become a toxic part of his personality.</p>

      <label for="lj8ao84" class="commentText"><p>I think in terms of sports, he just let his competitiveness drive his ego but it’s a hard area to judge for sports, especially in retrospect. I’ve played with guys who are genuinely some of the best people I have known who are unbelievably dickish on the courts. I think it’s a “do what it takes to win” attitude masking severe control issues generally. But I needed it too in a lot of scenarios growing up in an ultra-competitive area for basketball, and I understood the reasons behind it. I think the focus on mental health is trying to drive that competitiveness without the extreme bullying.</p>

<p>The sexual assault side of him off the courts does make him a piece of shit, and if you want to refute that then the fact that he consistently cheated on his wife makes him a piece of shit. But his reputation as an entire generations basketball inspiration will always overshadow that unfortunately, and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t part of it cause he holds such a dear place in my heart as a basketball player.</p>

      <label for="lj8k5ib" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s fair. How much to separate someone&rsquo;s achievements from personality isn&rsquo;t a simple question and doesn&rsquo;t have one right answer.</p>

<p>My main issue there is when people gloss over the cheating on his wife and then trying to buy her forgiveness back, plus at best getting into a questionable consent issue that put someone else through the ringer and at worst sexually assaulting someone else, but then when his own daughter gets into basically he starts very publicly getting into women&rsquo;s basketball and suddenly people are acting like it makes him some shining beacon of feminism.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think a lot of times it&rsquo;s an ego thing. Wanting to be great, and wanting to be thought of by others as great. So you viciously attack anyone you feel is in the way of that greatness - which also has the helpful side effect of setting them up to get all the blame for falling short.</p>

<p>As another example of that, purposefully spending half of a playoff game not trying to score or even be a threat. Yeah they were probably going to lose anyway, and I understand being frustrated and feeling like you&rsquo;re doing your best but the team around you isn&rsquo;t good enough.  But it&rsquo;s rare to see someone so clearly and openly alter their game just to the point &ldquo;all these other guys are at fault here, not me&rdquo; and turn part of a playoff game into a personal research project of how he felt his teammates weren&rsquo;t good enough.</p>

Everyone acts like people didn’t absolutely hate Kobe from 04-08. He rehabbed his image once LA got back to the finals in 08 but between then and Shaq leaving he was one of the most criticized and over looked players in the league.</p>

      <label for="lja35as" class="commentText"><p>Kobe always held his work ethic as something that made him unapproachable and above everyone. Instead of bringing the other guys up to his level, he beat them down and judged them. It’s like no one really liked him early on, so he became the bully he thought everyone else was, but the truth was he was just unlikeable and a difficult teammate. It sounds like he softened up later in his career, and made time for those he deemed ‘worthy’, but man, he must have been exhausting.</p>

<p>He wanted to be Jordan so badly, but he never understood he didn’t have a Pippen with him to take care of I’ll the egos he hurt. Without the good cop next to you, you’re not bad cop, you’re just an asshole.</p>

      <label for="lj88501" class="commentText"><p>Kobe was a borderline autist (using this word liberally as we do online) and had no people skills. He:</p>

<ol>
<li>Had 0 tolerance for lazy and meek people.</li>
<li>Believed everyone should be motivated by challenges and criticism.</li>
<li>Had no desire to play with people that weren’t that way.</li>
</ol>

<p>Anyone that’s followed Kobe for some time knows all of this.</p>

<p>On his inability to socialize: He was a loner in the back of the bus during Shaq years. He was never social. They talk about this time and time again. Shaq, Bowen, Glove, etc. PJ writes about it in his books. Kobe writes about it in his books. Says he has no real friends. Says he finds his style of leadership lonely. Olympic team documentary.</p>

<p>On his philosophy of people needing to be motivated by challenges and criticism. When he gets ribbed for not being able to rap, he writes and memorizes a bunch of bars. When PJ said he was lesser than MJ because his hands were smaller, he brought grip trainers to his locker the next day. When he got cooked by AI, he asked PJ for the hardest guarding assignment every game. He has stated explicitly (paraphrasing) “I have nothing in common and want nothing to do with lazy people, and it is my job as a leader to push people’s buttons to make them excel beyond their abilities.” Videos of him elbowing Sasha in practice. Videos of him calling his team of Nick Young, J Lin, etc, soft as shit. Videos of him saying he intends on making practice more challenging and more uncomfortable than real playoff games. The “we practice so on our worst day we’re better than you on your best day” type of vibe. You got Lou Will coming out and saying the only players Kobe laid off were vets and people that stood up to him, and elevated / went to practice. It wasn’t even about being good — Kobe LOVED Adam Morrison and Robert Sacre. He LOVED Metta well past Metta’s expiration date as a player.</p>

<p>It’s a very clear and obvious theme about him, and maybe a flaw but w/e.</p>

<p>Going about it this way, he became one of the winningest players in NBA history, went to the finals 7 times, and was always competitive any time he had any semblance of a competent supporting cast, counting and efficiency metrics be damned. Pau Gasol is my 2nd all time favorite player. But his career, absolute best case, is Chris Bosh — and more likely K Love without that trade to LAL.</p>

      <label for="lj8g9ly" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, you go back to him playing as a kid in italy and you hear these stories of a kid always with a ball in his hand. Who used to be a ball boy and shoot the ball between breaks.  Who would bounce the ball all around the streets at all times of day, who would put up hundreds of shots as a kid.</p>

<p>He was definitely on the spectrum and didn&rsquo;t know how to relate to most people. He&rsquo;s got one or two friends from every stop he made in life and a bunch of people who said they knew nothing about him, but he was never the life of the party or the guy that everyone got along with.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t excuse him being a dick, but I think its more complicated than a guy just being a dick.</p>

      <label for="lj8zlq1" class="commentText"><p>Living in vastly different parts of the world in his early childhood likely influenced that. While children are very adaptable, it&rsquo;s highly likely he was shunned for being different and couldn&rsquo;t build those essential social skills early on. Then he put himself in his own box and just focused on basketball, which probably further exacerbated his other developmental skills.</p>

<p>Kobe was then drafted at 18. That&rsquo;s so incredibly young and from what we hear from other players, he was selfish, childish and undoubtedly talented. Which again, a recipe to get shunned again. Then he went from being shunned to superstardom; very little time for him to mature socially and by all means, he wouldn&rsquo;t believe he needed to, given all his success up to that point.</p>

<p>Kobe was incredibly talented but he probably didn&rsquo;t mature socially until his second title run with Gasol and co.</p>

      <label for="lj8wozi" class="commentText"><p>To add to your point about Kobe pushing peoples buttons to make them perform better, Smush Parker himself had his best years BY FAR playing with Kobe. The guy was straight up not an NBA level talent and yet he averaged 11/3/3 the 2 years he played with Kobe which is around double his stats of the years he wasn&rsquo;t playing with Kobe. He looked like a serviceable NBA player and got paid in Miami solely because of playing with Kobe and then continued to start just 4 more games after playing with Kobe before bouncing out of the league very quickly.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, a wide majority of his teammates have had their career best years playing with Kobe. Even D Fish had a career as a starter far past his shelf life primarily due to playing off of Kobe.</p>

      <label for="lj91f2y" class="commentText"><p>There likely are, but to that end I might not say that Steph Curry is a fair or accurate example of this.</p>

<p>Virtually all Warriors players, coaching staff, etc? have indicated that Draymond Green has historically played a lot of that role — and he is, by all accounts, an absolute “dick” far beyond any indication of Kobe.</p>

<p>People then cite Tim Duncan, but Gregg Poppovich has historically and notoriously been an absolute “dick” and hard ass.</p>

<p>I don’t disagree that that is the point of contention here, and much of the comment I made just discusses the thought process and motivation that has become evident and validated through multiple firsthand accounts, across books, interviews, and video evidence.</p>

<p>I mean I can get it, as someone ambitious and driven, you don&rsquo;t want anything to do with lazy habits / people. And why should you? It shouldn&rsquo;t be abnormal to just not want anything to do with people that are not driven or ambitious. It&rsquo;s a key part of growth, everyone says you&rsquo;re the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with. </p>

<p>Rich people often don&rsquo;t want anything to do with people that aren&rsquo;t, kinda like that, but a much nicer thing to attribute it to work ethic</p>

<p>Not taking his side completely, but if it worked for him, ain&rsquo;t nothing wrong with it. </p>

MJ hustling Pippen in a practical joke or punching Steve Kerr in a heated practice (and then apologizing) reflects a highly competitive person, while intense, was still centered around basketball/competition dynamics. Kobe&rsquo;s &ldquo;you need accolades to talk to me&rdquo; attitude seems more rooted in an elitist mentality.  It&rsquo;s annoying how often people stretch connections here to make some dumbass point.  I don&rsquo;t see how those stories are related.</p>

      <label for="lj9voap" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think Kobe was elitist or an egomaniac. I think he just wanted to win to an extreme and it’s all he cared about. He expected greatness from his teammates. So it was less of a “you’re not good enough to talk to me” and more of a “I want you to get better.” It was a form of motivation</p>

      <label for="lj8d085" class="commentText"><p>I was like right in the age-demo for the Kobe renaissance. I was just starting to play organized ball in 2000 when he really came on. He was an amazing player, and super-well respected and liked, but he was always hounded with stories of his diva behavior. I remember watching a little thing on ESPN about the Lakers and Shaq talking about how Kobe would pretend to listen to headphones during practice so he could hear what people were maybe saying about him. This is discounting the fact that he&rsquo;s a rapist, which is so awful it doesn&rsquo;t even bare discussion when discussing his numerous other character flaws.</p>

<p>Guy is a top 12 player at absolute worst. But the deification of him is really a result of amazing marketing and this strange capitalist grindset mentality. Mamba Mentality = Capitalism.  I think people who value hard work above all else look at the Kobe story and see what they hope it will give them.</p>

<p>There were stories of him waking up at 3AM to go to the gym. That&rsquo;s impressive dedication, but what did his wife think about this dude being so obviously addicted to his job.  This is also not to discount that he&rsquo;s not a rags to riches story with success solely predicated on hard work. He was born rich, to a professional basketball playing father, and was a physical marvel. He had advantages. Those aren&rsquo;t discussed because it doesn&rsquo;t fit the narrative.</p>

<p>People who watched back then take him for what he was &ndash; a TOP 3 player for much of his career, but seldom Top 1. At any point in his career there is probably someone you would take over him. That doesn&rsquo;t make him a bum &ndash; it makes him amazingly talented.</p>

<p>Edit: Kobe was never seen like Jordan/Lebron. In his early career, Shaq was seen as an obviously better player. When Shaq left and the Lakers petered out, Lebron and company took that mantle. Duncan was, at worst, as good as him his whole career. When Kobe got two more rings later on he was still an incredible player, but I think there were probably 10 or so guys you&rsquo;d take over him in a league redraft.</p>

      <label for="lj8dt6g" class="commentText"><p>Smush played with the lakers from 2005-2007. He got to see the first few years post-Shaq and it was not pretty. Kobe was one of, if not the most polarizing athlete in America at that time. He still is, just to a lesser extent.</p>

<p>It’s easy to forget just how many people <em>hated</em> Kobe. His image was horrible at this time. Two years removed from the Colorado case and his first year after the 2004 loss. Kobe was seen as a selfish, immature, and cancerous teammate.</p>

<p>Kobe changing his number to 24 marked a metaphorical and literal new chapter in his life. He was still Kobe on the court, and his style of play and what he demanded was absolutely not for everyone. When you are so good at something, you expect more from your teammates and have a hard time recognizing how much of it is them not working hard enough, versus how much is them just being physically incapable of doing what you want done. It’s why I think we rarely see all-time greats get into coaching/coach well.</p>

<p>Kobe spent the rest of his career cleaning up his image and becoming a more personable dude in life after basketball. Who Kobe was in 2020 was vastly different to who Kobe was from 2005-2007. He grew up a ton, which he desperately needed to do.</p>

<p>Jordan and Kobe’s “killer instinct” gets romanticized because we as fans only get to see what is shown on the court. MJ and Kobe’s competitiveness was second to none. They didn’t care if they stepped on peoples necks. They didn’t care if people didn’t like them. Their sole focus was winning, and both were incredible at it. Again, to reiterate an earlier point, that type of behavior is going to alienate <em>a lot</em> of people, they just didn’t care.</p>

<p>Edit: just to add on - im a lebron fan, my lakers flair is cuz of lebron. I was never a big kobe fan when he played nor was i a lakers fan. But Ive always enjoyed how he played (not how he treated teammates). Also cried when he died.</p>

<p>That shit is funny when you work in an office or whatever, not so funny when you&rsquo;re a pro athlete. Pretty much no one around the Lakers liked Smush in those days, this isn&rsquo;t just a Kobe thing.</p>

      <label for="lj88gva" class="commentText"><p>I’ve seen this clip before and also just saw the clip going around of Kobe being a complete asshole to Jeremy Lin during a practice. Kobe and his daughter dying was an absolute travesty, I cried when I heard the news, but people have gone a lil wild with the deification of him since his passing. Dude was a very flawed player and person, he seemed like he calmed down after retirement but everything I’ve heard about him as an actual teammate makes me surprised nobody ever tried to beat his ass</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that complicated and people that were around Kobe and the Lakers during his tenure have said this, as long as you worked your ass off, Kobe would respect you and treat you fine, but if he thought you were lazy, he was going at you regardless of who you were.</p>

That’s just a certain elitism that a whole bunch of people that are rich or in power get. It coming from someone like Kobe, no big deal…he’s a basketball player, but it’s a huge deal when it comes from those like politicians, law enforcement, or others involved in careers directly effecting people.</p>

The nail on the coffin for Kobe being a selfish asshat is when he decided to take the max money he can get instead of taking a paycut to still try to build a contender near the end of his career, but it seemed he was alright with losing then. The Kobe who loved to win died when he tore his Achilles in 2012.</p>

<p>It would be like me saying that i had an unpleasant experience with management when i worked at a place, but leave out the fact that during my time there i didn&rsquo;t do anything i was asked and missed a bunch of days.</p>

Jordan and Kobe played in different eras.  There is 0 chance that a Jordan or a Kobe type personality and behavior toward teammates would be accepted today.  During those days it was applauded!  People said the psycho mentality that Kobe had was what separated a guy like Kobe from a guy like TMac.  It was a desired trait and an accepted consequence of his brilliance.  As a society generally we have moved away from this &ldquo;old school&rdquo; tough love sort of stuff, but saying these guys are bad people based on the way they treated their teammates feels weak, when that behavior was rewarded and applauded at the time.</p>

<p>None of this changes Kobe&rsquo;s legacy because it was already part of his legacy.  He brutally pushed those around him to get to his level.  He wasn&rsquo;t the GOAT.  He is probably more appropriately discussed as being one of the Top 10 of all time, but that extra level of not giving a fuck about anyone is what pushed Kobe past guys like Dirk and Melo, for example.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that what held him back was having to play on a team that started Smush Parker, Kwame Brown and Chris Mihm, but maybe i&rsquo;m wrong.</p>

It’s just that I thought he hugged him when Smush stole the ball from steve nash to hit the game tying layup in the playoffs. Could you imagine how the locker room was after they won at the buzzer? I’d bet they talked for sure.</p>

      <label for="ljbjdg5" class="commentText"><p>So r/NBA is just a clusterfuck of hate posts regurgitating Kobe’s low points for karma now? Let’s post the same shit videos about Kobe but ignore the thousands of highlights, positive inspirational moments that he has left to an entire generation of basketball player (me included). Everyone knows Kobe was both an asshole and an amazing basketball player. Are we basketball fans or Christians looking at athletes as if they are saints or next coming of Jesus? Like everyone needs to grow the fuck up and move on. Let the man rest. If Kobe was in his prime today, he will destroy everyone’s favourite teams and tell all you haters to keep hating because there is nothing you can do about it. Kobe is the John Wick of basketball with imperfect personalities. He killed everyone on the court and didn’t play nice, he gave everything to basketball fans for the time he could play. To me, he was one of one and he approached winning through his methods. Every great needed a team to win, if he was such a bad team mate, no one would have shown up to watch him, to congratulate him at his retirement game, for Teams like Boston to honour him etc. The guy went to finals 3 times without Shaq, one of the few players to ever repeat as champ and did it his way. Say what you want but if Kobe was on your team, you would be a Stan too because he was a pure basketball player who didn’t accept mediocrity. This resonated with many fans around the world. r/NBA needs to get off the high horse and focus on basketball and not just shitting on present and past players (mostly Kobe lol) for karma and echo chambering. </p>
