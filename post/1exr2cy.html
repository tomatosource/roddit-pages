      <label for="lj8cvif" class="commentText"><p>For a while it felt like punching down and especially as his death was fresh, it wasn’t in good faith.</p>

<p>But the guy has an incredibly complicated legacy. Great basketball player. By all accounts, a great father.</p>

<p>He also did some terrible things, put one woman through hell and was a brutal teammate for most of his career.</p>

<p>We aren’t one part of our personality, we’re all of it. Kobe was who he was. Imperfect. His mistakes were there for the world to see. So were his successes.</p>

<p>It’s just hard to have any kind of discourse about him because people from either side will always go hard in the paint.</p>

      <label for="lj8ao84" class="commentText"><p>I think in terms of sports, he just let his competitiveness drive his ego but it’s a hard area to judge for sports, especially in retrospect. I’ve played with guys who are genuinely some of the best people I have known who are unbelievably dickish on the courts. I think it’s a “do what it takes to win” attitude masking severe control issues generally. But I needed it too in a lot of scenarios growing up in an ultra-competitive area for basketball, and I understood the reasons behind it. I think the focus on mental health is trying to drive that competitiveness without the extreme bullying.</p>

<p>The sexual assault side of him off the courts does make him a piece of shit, and if you want to refute that then the fact that he consistently cheated on his wife makes him a piece of shit. But his reputation as an entire generations basketball inspiration will always overshadow that unfortunately, and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t part of it cause he holds such a dear place in my heart as a basketball player.</p>

      <label for="lj8d085" class="commentText"><p>I was like right in the age-demo for the Kobe renaissance. I was just starting to play organized ball in 2000 when he really came on. He was an amazing player, and super-well respected and liked, but he was always hounded with stories of his diva behavior. I remember watching a little thing on ESPN about the Lakers and Shaq talking about how Kobe would pretend to listen to headphones during practice so he could hear what people were maybe saying about him. This is discounting the fact that he&rsquo;s a rapist, which is so awful it doesn&rsquo;t even bare discussion when discussing his numerous other character flaws.</p>

<p>Guy is a top 12 player at absolute worst. But the deification of him is really a result of amazing marketing and this strange capitalist grindset mentality. Mamba Mentality = Capitalism.  I think people who value hard work above all else look at the Kobe story and see what they hope it will give them.</p>

<p>There were stories of him waking up at 3AM to go to the gym. That&rsquo;s impressive dedication, but what did his wife think about this dude being so obviously addicted to his job.  This is also not to discount that he&rsquo;s not a rags to riches story with success solely predicated on hard work. He was born rich, to a professional basketball playing father, and was a physical marvel. He had advantages. Those aren&rsquo;t discussed because it doesn&rsquo;t fit the narrative.</p>

<p>People who watched back then take him for what he was &ndash; a TOP 3 player for much of his career, but seldom Top 1. At any point in his career there is probably someone you would take over him. That doesn&rsquo;t make him a bum &ndash; it makes him amazingly talented.</p>

<p>Edit: Kobe was never seen like Jordan/Lebron. In his early career, Shaq was seen as an obviously better player. When Shaq left and the Lakers petered out, Lebron and company took that mantle. Duncan was, at worst, as good as him his whole career. When Kobe got two more rings later on he was still an incredible player, but I think there were probably 10 or so guys you&rsquo;d take over him in a league redraft.</p>

      <label for="lj8dt6g" class="commentText"><p>Smush played with the lakers from 2005-2007. He got to see the first few years post-Shaq and it was not pretty. Kobe was one of, if not the most polarizing athlete in America at that time. He still is, just to a lesser extent.</p>

<p>It’s easy to forget just how many people <em>hated</em> Kobe. His image was horrible at this time. Two years removed from the Colorado case and his first year after the 2004 loss. Kobe was seen as a selfish, immature, and cancerous teammate.</p>

<p>Kobe changing his number to 24 marked a metaphorical and literal new chapter in his life. He was still Kobe on the court, and his style of play and what he demanded was absolutely not for everyone. When you are so good at something, you expect more from your teammates and have a hard time recognizing how much of it is them not working hard enough, versus how much is them just being physically incapable of doing what you want done. It’s why I think we rarely see all-time greats get into coaching/coach well.</p>

<p>Kobe spent the rest of his career cleaning up his image and becoming a more personable dude in life after basketball. Who Kobe was in 2020 was vastly different to who Kobe was from 2005-2007. He grew up a ton, which he desperately needed to do.</p>

<p>Jordan and Kobe’s “killer instinct” gets romanticized because we as fans only get to see what is shown on the court. MJ and Kobe’s competitiveness was second to none. They didn’t care if they stepped on peoples necks. They didn’t care if people didn’t like them. Their sole focus was winning, and both were incredible at it. Again, to reiterate an earlier point, that type of behavior is going to alienate <em>a lot</em> of people, they just didn’t care.</p>

      <label for="lj86udv" class="commentText"><p>Oh no, the egotistical rapist is an asshole. What a revelation. The nail on the coffin for Kobe being a selfish asshat is when he decided to take the max money he can get instead of taking a paycut to still try to build a contender near the end of his career, but it seemed he was alright with losing then. The Kobe who loved to win died when he tore his Achilles in 2012.</p>

      <label for="lj88501" class="commentText"><p>Kobe was a borderline autist (using this word liberally as we do online) and had no people skills. He:</p>

<ol>
<li>Had 0 tolerance for lazy and meek people.</li>
<li>Believed everyone should be motivated by challenges and criticism.</li>
<li>Had no desire to play with people that weren’t that way.</li>
</ol>

<p>Anyone that’s followed Kobe for some time knows all of this.</p>

<p>On his inability to socialize: He was a loner in the back of the bus during Shaq years. He was never social. They talk about this time and time again. Shaq, Bowen, Glove, etc. PJ writes about it in his books. Kobe writes about it in his books. Says he has no real friends. Says he finds his style of leadership lonely. Olympic team documentary.</p>

<p>On his philosophy of people needing to be motivated by challenges and criticism. When he gets ribbed for not being able to rap, he writes and memorizes a bunch of bars. When PJ said he was lesser than MJ because his hands were smaller, he brought grip trainers to his locker the next day. When he got cooked by AI, he asked PJ for the hardest guarding assignment every game. He has stated explicitly (paraphrasing) “I have nothing in common and want nothing to do with lazy people, and it is my job as a leader to push people’s buttons to make them excel beyond their abilities.” Videos of him elbowing Sasha in practice. Videos of him calling his team of Nick Young, J Lin, etc, soft as shit. Videos of him saying he intends on making practice more challenging and more uncomfortable than real playoff games. The “we practice so on our worst day we’re better than you on your best day” type of vibe. You got Lou Will coming out and saying the only players Kobe laid off were vets and people that stood up to him, and elevated / went to practice. It wasn’t even about being good — Kobe LOVED Adam Morrison and Robert Sacre. He LOVED Metta well past Metta’s expiration date as a player.</p>

<p>It’s a very clear and obvious theme about him, and maybe a flaw but w/e.</p>

<p>Going about it this way, he became one of the winningest players in NBA history, went to the finals 7 times, and was always competitive any time he had any semblance of a competent supporting cast, counting and efficiency metrics be damned. Pau Gasol is my 2nd all time favorite player. But his career, absolute best case, is Chris Bosh — and more likely K Love without that trade to LAL.</p>

Kobe and his daughter dying was an absolute travesty, I cried when I heard the news, but people have gone a lil wild with the deification of him since his passing. Dude was a very flawed player and person, he seemed like he calmed down after retirement but everything I’ve heard about him as an actual teammate makes me surprised nobody ever tried to beat his ass</p>

<p>Everyone else doesn’t like them, because he was a dick to them.</p>

<p>This makes perfect sense. Some people loving someone doesn’t mean they were cool. People love Trump.</p>
