<p>It was the most demoralizing series I&rsquo;ve ever watched as a fan (although the Wizards one hit hard, too).</p>

<p>Still, that series or the LeBron winner over OG doesn&rsquo;t hit me the same way the five missed game winners did in the one semis. Especially JV&rsquo;s multiple missed tips at the rim. That loss was so deflating that they could have just ended the series right then because the team just looked broken after that loss.</p>

<p>Yes.  LeBron shot <sup>13</sup>&frasl;<sub>27</sub> from the 3pt line in that series.  Korver drilled <sup>11</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> 3s.   Channing Frye <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub> 3s.

<p>But watching game 1 I felt like everything was going right for Toronto and they were barely keeping a double digit lead. I kept thinking &ldquo;Cavs just need to make one run.&rdquo; Once the cavs stole game 1 I knew the series was over.</p>

      <label for="lk7umzd" class="commentText"><p>Yeah you&rsquo;re right. Forgive my memory and let me rephrase it. I felt like in the first half in particular, they were playing really good basketball and were outplaying the cavs significantly. But&hellip; They couldn&rsquo;t put them away. Cavs got it close in the last couple of minutes going into half.</p>

<p>I felt like as I was watching (especially in the second half of game 1) with how hard Toronto was playing they needed to win convincingly to give themselves real confidence they could take the series. Clearly, they felt that pressure too and started cracking as the game progressed.</p>

<p>That was the only Raptors vs Lebron series i thought we had any chance. But it really just goes to show how weak the East was during Lebrons stint out here. There were no known playoff performers in the East during the 2010s. Things really changed with Giannis and Kawhi, and of course now with the Jays in Boston and Jimmy butler etc</p>

      <label for="lk8bzel" class="commentText"><p>Agreed. As the road team I felt the Cavs could afford to lose game 1, but given the prior two years, the raptors had to start well to prove to themselves that 2018 was a different year. I was far more worried in 18 than I was in 16 or 17 heading into the series, I felt a different result was on the table.</p>

<p>The East really was weak. I don&rsquo;t believe the East was particularly strong during Jordan&rsquo;s run, but teams like the Knicks and pacers were really difficult outs in the 90s with HOF players Whereas in the 2010s that doesn&rsquo;t appear to be the case. DRose got hurt, the Celtics while good were in-between in terms of HOF level players at their primes, Paul George has always been great but not a number 1, and Toronto didn&rsquo;t have a top ten player pre-Kawhi.</p>

<p>Part of that I give LeBron credit for - he was so dominant that it didn&rsquo;t matter who in the East he played and he&rsquo;s the only one besides guys like Jordan and Magic to have this much control over a conference. That said, he may get to 6 of 8 finals rather than 8 of 8 if the East is better.</p>

<p>Suggesting the NBA made sure the cavs won that series is an extremely subjective, difficult to objectively prove take. It&rsquo;s better to say the cavs struggled, and for much of the series the pacers were the better squad. there were points I certainly thought the cavs might be toast and lose in round 1.</p>

<p>no he doesnt, because it was a foul and a goaltend.</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s just the one obvious play, the entire series was called one sided.</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s not difficult to prove when you watch the game and you know the rules of the game. it&rsquo;s always in the non-calls and how teams are officiated differently - that&rsquo;s how they control the series and the games. that series had some pretty bad calls where lebron flops without being touched and gets called for it, but the entire series was called poorly</p>

<p>even in the celtics series, games 6 and 7 were called for the cavs. it was extremely lopsided</p>

      <label for="lk52wvx" class="commentText"><p>In 2018 the Cavs had a hard time because that team sucked. Lebron was holding that shit together. Jeff Green was the only one helping him out in the final 2 games of the ECF against the Celtics that season. 2017 was a fucking cakewalk for them. They only lost 1 game before the Finals and that&rsquo;s because Smart had one of his patented &ldquo;crazy shooting&rdquo; nights where he hit a ton of threes to bail them out. But, you can&rsquo;t really do that more than once.</p>

      <label for="lk60suz" class="commentText"><p>An underrated aspect of the Cavs Warriors matchup was that Kevin Love played like a third star against most teams&hellip; Not against the Warriors. He was often a net negative in every single game against them. Couldn&rsquo;t post up anyone on the roster, couldn&rsquo;t hit his threes, couldn&rsquo;t defend (sans that one play at the end of 2016 finals).</p>

      <label for="lk47vaw" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, but in the Indiana series (the series before this one) he at least looked vulnerable. Oladipo was playing out of his mind, but team-wise I felt that Toronto was much better than Indiana, and if Indiana could push the Cavs to 7, we would at least make Lebron sweat a bit.</p>

<p>Then game 1 happened and that was when I knew Lebron was in their heads and the series was over.</p>

I don’t remember exactly what the numbers were but that Cavs team had one of the best offensive ratings in playoff history, higher than a ton of teams who actually went on to win titles in other seasons. LeBron, Kyrie, Love plus a well rounded starting lineup and a good bench. They were a superteam who lost to a better superteam, but still a superteam nonetheless</p>

<p>Not really. Most teams from the West never bothered LeBron.   Only the Spurs dynasty with Duncan.  Then OKC with KD, Westbrook, Harden and Ibaka.  And then finally the Golden State Warriors.</p>

<p>And then the final boss just to beat LeBron in the Finals.. the 73-9 GSW WITH Kevin Durant, post 2016.   They also had Boogie Cousins at 5 before he got injured</p>

      <label for="lk3pcl9" class="commentText"><p>People hate to admit it for some reason, but Pierce was the first foe he had some legitimate battles with. Getting past him and the Celtics was a big step in his career arc. Curry, KD and Kawhi can probably be considered rivals to him as well. He just ran the east for so long, it&rsquo;s hard to consider anyone from there a rival from 2013 until he left for LA.</p>

His series’ against Detroit were early in his career and spectacular enough that any struggles held no weight. I assure you he didn’t lose as much sleep over losing in 2006 as he did in 2010.</p>

<p>This is also about individual player rivals, not teams. Nobody on that Pistons team had the sort of relationship Pierce had with Bron. Timing played a big part in that.</p>

      <label for="lk4afr8" class="commentText"><p>Okay, you’re actually trolling. How is a guy that made the hall of fame in 2021, as soon as he was eligible, not a guy that anyone puts in the hall of fame? You’re calling him an average player. Get the fuck out of here and delete your account while you’re at it. Just stupid.</p>

<p>And no, Boston had nothing to do with him returning to Cleveland, only leaving.</p>
