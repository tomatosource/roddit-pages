Tatum was willing to not be the main guy, he didn&rsquo;t take many shots when he was out there so he already was changing his role. Kerr just wasn&rsquo;t gonna play someone who wasn&rsquo;t hitting their shots and that&rsquo;s fine</p>

      <label for="lirrj2z" class="commentText"><p>Thats a bit much. Ant was a net negative a bunch of time out there and kept going. I get their roles dont match up thought to swap one for one&hellip;. just a counter point to your take. But at least when Tatum&rsquo;s shot isnt hitting, he has other skill sets that can be a net positive. We saw that in the playoff run. But seeing as you only seem to make negative comments on this sub, and particularly seem to hate the celtics&hellip; oh well.</p>

      <label for="lisislr" class="commentText"><p>thats cause when he tried to be the man, he ended up having career lows, and the lowest fg percentage in NBA finals history amongst volume shooters. breh kobe had a shit finals shooting where he resorted to grabbing 15 boards and passing ronron in crunch time in a game 7. that Stat alone dictates only player he plays over would be Embiid, ant and Haliburton. embiid got size and d, ant is ant. so the fuck else should Kerr play Tatum over?</p>

<p>He’s clearly shown a willingness to do whatever the team asks of him. He was just a worse fit for the role than Booker because he can’t hit a jumper and Booker shot damn near 50% from deep.</p>

      <label for="lisatyw" class="commentText"><p>I mean, he&rsquo;s gonna chuck it. He took 20 FGAs/game despite having the second lowest TS% of any Celtic to appear in all 5 games. DWhite was 59%TS, and Jrue, KP, Al, and Hauser were all 62%+. The latter 3 were all 67%+ - the other Celtics were amazing</p>

<p>That being said, his role was to chuck them up. He needs to keep the defense honest, and he launched himself up to 7apg.</p>

<p>If he clearly <em>stopped</em> chucking up shots, the opposing defense can totally change their scheme to cover those other guys.</p>

<p>I think Tatum should&rsquo;ve played in that Serbia game - his length on the perimeter definitely would&rsquo;ve deterred some role player 3s</p>

It&rsquo;s great to have on a regular team, but in the Olympics when you can have top level talent at each position it&rsquo;s not as needed. Why slot in Tatum at a position he&rsquo;s a B+ to A- in, when you can have other players who are A+ at their specific position that can have it covered all game.</p>

      <label for="lisbp47" class="commentText"><p>Agree with your point. I think Celtics fans, the ones who are mad at Kerr, don’t care about the Xs and Os. They want minutes for him, even if it means no guards or centers on the floor because they believe USA would have won regardless. Except Kerr is not that type of coach and I think Lebron had more of a say than the public knows. The plays they ran reminds of his system with the Cavs/Lakers then Kerr’s off ball motions.</p>

<p>playmaking does not necessarily need to be the heliocentric offence you see from harden and luka that is just one form. So yes, driving and kicking is a form of playmaking but besides that he is excellent in pick in rolls with brown and jrue and and is good at across the court passes he also passes well to other players in the interior He an excellent playmaker we just don&rsquo;t run the offence through him strictly the same way heliocentric offences do</p>

      <label for="lis1hbp" class="commentText"><p>on offense, imo part of the reason he doesn&rsquo;t have go-to is that they have him playing different roles in different lineups, match-ups, seasons.</p>

<p>this season for instance they had him posting up more than before&ndash;and the numbers were great&ndash;but in the playoffs and in bench lineups they often use him as the primary ball handler.</p>

<p>I think to a degree he does change his game to fit around a celtics roster that had a decent amount of turnover to get to where it is today + 3 different coaches with their own schemes. it got to a point where after the smart porzingis trade and before they got jrue, there was talk of having him play the point this season (although I don&rsquo;t buy that as much)</p>

<p>On offense he can initiate sets, create for himself in isolation, drive and kick, backdown smaller players in size mismatches in the post, cut off ball, spot up in the corner or above the break (until the playoffs at least) and score in transition.</p>

<p>On defense he can comfortably switch on the perimeter and onto some 5s, but more than that he can be a weakside rim protector, play up in the gaps in aggressive help schemes, can play physical and press up on ballhandlers or play off and use his length to contest. He&rsquo;s also an elite rebounder for his position.</p>

<p>Tatum was on a great team full of great players. There&rsquo;s nothing &ldquo;humbling&rdquo; about it considering he hasn&rsquo;t said a word and everyone on the outside are the ones projecting their feelings and trying to pass it off as fact. On 2028 he&rsquo;ll be in line to play a bigger role3, and life will go on.</p>

<p>Making this an every day discussion when this all came to an end a week ago is pointless. Especially when he&rsquo;s still one of the top guys playing for the defending champions. The Olympics plays zero factor in that, so who cares?</p>

      <label for="lisf6bv" class="commentText"><p>“There’s nothing humbling about it considering he hasn’t said a word”</p>

<p>Tatum literally said it was a humbling experience lmfao</p>

<p>Edit: exact quote from JT</p>

<p>“Definitely a humbling experience, right?” Tatum said of his benching against Serbia. “Win a championship, new contract, cover of (NBA) 2K and then you sit a whole game. Cover of Sports Illustrated. So it was definitely a humbling experience.”</p>

      <label for="lirqwdx" class="commentText"><p>Tatum played his role. He had some nice defensive possessions and barely shot the ball in the games he played. He just didn&rsquo;t hit shots, and with the Olympics and small sample size sometimes you ride the hot hand and they did, that simple. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s Booker bought into his role and Tatum didn&rsquo;t. There were times when Tatum started in the exhibition games where he had 2 touches in the entire half, he was fine sitting in the corner. Book just came in hot and Tatum cold.</p>

<p>Catch and shooting is an extremely valuable skill in basketball, especially when you play with other good players.</p>

<p>Tatum cannot do it at a high level, Booker can be a great spot up shooter.</p>

<p>People are trying to complicate it so much (adjusting roles, how to fit in),  but it seriously just comes down to one skill, catch and shoot.</p>

<p>Tatum has always been on teams with elite spacing so he’s had more open looks. There was a stretch of years where Booker was basically the only one who could create his own offence on the Suns.</p>

<p>Overall, I do think Booker is a better pure shooter than Tatum.</p>

<p>This is not Tatum hate, as I think Tatum is still the overall better player, and better #1 option.</p>

<p>Book is better at playing off the ball, he’s better at catch and shoot, and he’s better at moving the ball. He apparently is good at shot selection, though that isn’t observed as much in the nba. 😂😂</p>

And after Paul left Book became the main facilitator so I feel like his catch and shoot opportunities have been really bad outside of the CP3 years.

      <label for="lirsbxf" class="commentText"><p>I wonder why this &ldquo;skill&rdquo; of his didn&rsquo;t translate into the NBA. Or maybe it&rsquo;s because Carmelo was taking 3&rsquo;s that are midrange in the NBA while having 4 of the best basketball players in the world around him at all times, playing mostly guys that never make the NBA? Tatum surpassed Melo by year 3. There&rsquo;s a reason why Melo never came close to winning a ring, he never cared about playing team basketball.</p>

      <label for="lis0ngi" class="commentText"><p>Nah I disagree. Carmelo is what he was, a volume (not so efficient) scorer who couldn’t do much else. Liability on defence, above average rebounder for his size, and a ball stopper, no sense of vision.</p>

<p>He maximized his potential at what he was good at, but didn’t produce winning results. Still an incredible NBA player though.</p>

      <label for="lis6p28" class="commentText"><p>yeah buddy Melo was what he was. He didn&rsquo;t have success at winning in the NBA but he had success - you don&rsquo;t end up 10th most points in NBA history being &lsquo;unsuccessful&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Realize that Melo had the *exact* same career FG% and a considerably better 3PT% than Kobe Bryant with almost identical volume&hellip;.</p>

<p>But he never had talent at defense or facilitating. Even at Syracuse. but won a title there because the right team was around him that allowed him to just play his bully ball, highly offensive style.</p>

<p>But the front offices in NBA never built correctly around what he was. All his best teams were great but flawed teams that no one expected to truly contend.</p>

<p>Name one year that Melo *should have* lead his team to a title in the NBA&hellip;</p>

      <label for="lirz31y" class="commentText"><p>His contemporaries did more more with less. i.e. Bron and Wade (at least for the first half of their careers) + I&rsquo;d argue, Melo had better teammates in Denver than Bron had in Cleveland and DWade Pre - Big 3. A better argument would be it&rsquo;s because that he&rsquo;s in a tougher conference. But even then, Melo&rsquo;s play style as an NBA # 1 option isn&rsquo;t as portable as it is vs. Tatum&rsquo;s. And FYI, that Denver squad has had the talent to go far. They had AI earlier + Chauncey Billups (who was top 7 in MVP voting in 09 might I add) + great role players like Camby, KMart, young JR Smith, Nene, etc. I give u his time with the Knicks tho. They were pretty shit.</p>

<p>the first Miami team that Wade won a championship on was pretty talent heavy and had a crooked ref working in their favour.</p>

      <label for="lisc4e3" class="commentText"><p>Look, I love Melo, but he kind of was rolling in all-stars.  He played with Iverson, Billups, Stoudemire, and Chandler for years they were all stars, all in his first 8 seasons.  Tatum played with Kyrie, Al who were all stars his rookie year, and Brown.</p>

<p>Melo chose money over winning. He had an awesome career, hall of fame guy, but if he wanted to win he probably shouldn&rsquo;t have gone to New York the way he did.</p>

      <label for="lisgdpe" class="commentText"><p>Might be one of the more straight up wrong comments I read in a while.</p>

<p>He played with Iverson when he was old (31) and clearly past his prime. He was an all star because he was iverson but he wasn’t all star calibre anymore anyone knows that.</p>

<p>Billups he had for two years and the went to the conference finals and lost to the Lakers the year the won the championship. Billups was 32 and already in decline, despite still being good.</p>

<p>Wilson Chandler was not an all star at any point during his career, unless you mean Tyson Chandler at which point, I mean seriously?</p>

<p>Stoudemire had exactly one good season before his knees gave out.</p>

<p>He played with none of the above together.</p>

<p>Tatum has literally never had a season in which he has not had a least two all stars in their prime on his team. Carmelo didn’t have that at any point during his career.</p>

      <label for="lisjtz6" class="commentText"><p>It really is an awesome time to be a Celtic fan, not gonna lie.  Tatum has been part of some fun teams.  This is all in good fun, on my side anyway.</p>

<p>I will say though&hellip; People love Jrue, until it&rsquo;s time to vote for all-star.  Can&rsquo;t get enough Horford, unless he&rsquo;s playing next to Embiid. Remember when White was acquired for a pick swap half a decade later and a guy named Romeo?  If this were a thread about how awesome the Celtic roleplayers were, you would be bringing up all kinds of slander. Instead, you&rsquo;re here to tell me how awesome Kemba Walker was in 2020.  Which, OK.  He was fun for about 6 months.</p>

<p>Literally everything you can say about the stars Carmelo played with applies to Tatum, with the exception of Brown.</p>

<p>Also, Tyson Chandler was awesome- for a couple different teams.</p>

      <label for="lis460q" class="commentText"><p>This is about seeing roles, not FIBA vs NBA, obviously NBA is harder &hellip;</p>

<p>Melo knows and admits in hindsight that he wasn&rsquo;t always clear during his career about when and how to approach his roles.</p>

<p>That said, Melo never really had a team that *should have* won a title, besides at Syracuse.</p>

<p>Tatum on the other hand, has played 2nd/3rd fiddle for a cakewalk title with a dominant team playing injured teams, but has also lost with much better teams than Melo ever had.</p>

<p>jaylen brown goes off</p>

<p>celtics org kinda concerned</p>

<p>“dont play tatum”</p>

<p>stevens want good chemistry between tatum and brown</p>

<p>This is what happened:</p>

<p>One went mad.</p>

<p>One could not see the aura. She survived.</p>

      <label for="lirsctp" class="commentText"><p>People keep talking about Tatum not hitting his shots, but he also didn’t get to the rim, the line or passed it well. Like dude could barely dribble the ball without turning it over.</p>

<p>He was already in a shooting slump before the Olympics, especially his 3 ball has vanished, but he did everything else to perfection in the playoffs.</p>

<p>But he didn’t do any of those things at the Olympics. It looked like the Monstars had stolen his talent.</p>
