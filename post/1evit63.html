Tatum was willing to not be the main guy, he didn&rsquo;t take many shots when he was out there so he already was changing his role. Kerr just wasn&rsquo;t gonna play someone who wasn&rsquo;t hitting their shots and that&rsquo;s fine</p>

Embiid never showed any negative emotions for being being benched, DNPed, or getting less minutes then AD. People care about starting spots because usually starters play more minutes than the Bench unit but AD was regularly playing more minutes and closing games which Embiid didn&rsquo;t complain about and actually cheered for his teammates.</p>

      <label for="lit1s17" class="commentText"><p>The greater context of what melo said is booker had played that role in college so had the skillset to be the glue guy.</p>

<p>It’s not just a willingness thing. Being a role player is its own skill that tatum never had to work on. If he’s always had 15-20 shots to find his rhythm, no matter how little ego he has his shot being off might be not being able to shoot without the volume.</p>

      <label for="lisatyw" class="commentText"><p>I mean, he&rsquo;s gonna chuck it. He took 20 FGAs/game despite having the second lowest TS% of any Celtic to appear in all 5 games. DWhite was 59%TS, and Jrue, KP, Al, and Hauser were all 62%+. The latter 3 were all 67%+ - the other Celtics were amazing</p>

<p>That being said, his role was to chuck them up. He needs to keep the defense honest, and he launched himself up to 7apg.</p>

<p>If he clearly <em>stopped</em> chucking up shots, the opposing defense can totally change their scheme to cover those other guys.</p>

<p>I think Tatum should&rsquo;ve played in that Serbia game - his length on the perimeter definitely would&rsquo;ve deterred some role player 3s</p>

When D-Wade said that Booker is a good defender, I was still like.. “really?” After watching all the Olympics games I’ve become better informed about booker’s abilities. He did everything. Full court pressing, hounding multiple ball handlers, fighting through screens. Scrappy as hell. I was/am seriously impressed.</p>

      <label for="lit0w18" class="commentText"><p>He’s not a bad defender, but he’s also not a great defender. He’s not exactly an elite athlete nor does he have elite physical tools (like length), so people are less inclined to assume he’s good.</p>

<p>He’s solid when he commits (which most star players only do consistently in an attempt to save energy) and mediocre when he doesn’t.</p>

<p>He was good in the Olympics because the talent on the perimeter is significantly worse. Most of his  top defensive assignments were guys who were fringe NBA talents. The best guard/wing the US played was probably Bogdan Bogdanovic, an NBA backup with average athleticism. He’s quick enough to stay in front and solid enough not to get overpowered.</p>

<p>Booker didn’t really have to guard the types of guys who would challenge him. Like, he would likely struggle against top NBA players.</p>

It&rsquo;s great to have on a regular team, but in the Olympics when you can have top level talent at each position it&rsquo;s not as needed. Why slot in Tatum at a position he&rsquo;s a B+ to A- in, when you can have other players who are A+ at their specific position that can have it covered all game.</p>

      <label for="lisbp47" class="commentText"><p>Agree with your point. I think Celtics fans, the ones who are mad at Kerr, don’t care about the Xs and Os. They want minutes for him, even if it means no guards or centers on the floor because they believe USA would have won regardless. Except Kerr is not that type of coach and I think Lebron had more of a say than the public knows. The plays they ran reminds of his system with the Cavs/Lakers then Kerr’s off ball motions.</p>

      <label for="lit29jc" class="commentText"><p>I would largely agree with this if not for the fact that Tatum is better at a couple of things that were really hurting the team. Perimeter defense was a huge one - the lack of length burned the team bad on the perimeter against Serbia when they were shooting hot. And then rebounding and secondary playmaking - both were problems at times that Tatum is better than most of the team at.</p>

<p>I don’t think we’ll ever know the real reasons and people will debate it forever. It’s not really explicable in a vacuum so it just comes down to Kerr’s whim. Might be as simple as Tatum was shooting cold and Kerr values shooting above all else.</p>

      <label for="lis1ifp" class="commentText"><p>He has a broad skillset so Boston has him do a lot of different things depending on the matchup.</p>

<p>On offense he can initiate sets, create for himself in isolation, drive and kick, backdown smaller players in size mismatches in the post, cut off ball, spot up in the corner or above the break (until the playoffs at least) and score in transition.</p>

<p>On defense he can comfortably switch on the perimeter and onto some 5s, but more than that he can be a weakside rim protector, play up in the gaps in aggressive help schemes, can play physical and press up on ballhandlers or play off and use his length to contest. He&rsquo;s also an elite rebounder for his position.</p>

<p>playmaking does not necessarily need to be the heliocentric offence you see from harden and luka that is just one form. So yes, driving and kicking is a form of playmaking but besides that he is excellent in pick in rolls with brown and jrue and and is good at across the court passes he also passes well to other players in the interior He an excellent playmaker we just don&rsquo;t run the offence through him strictly the same way heliocentric offences do</p>

      <label for="lis1hbp" class="commentText"><p>on offense, imo part of the reason he doesn&rsquo;t have go-to is that they have him playing different roles in different lineups, match-ups, seasons.</p>

<p>this season for instance they had him posting up more than before&ndash;and the numbers were great&ndash;but in the playoffs and in bench lineups they often use him as the primary ball handler.</p>

<p>I think to a degree he does change his game to fit around a celtics roster that had a decent amount of turnover to get to where it is today + 3 different coaches with their own schemes. it got to a point where after the smart porzingis trade and before they got jrue, there was talk of having him play the point this season (although I don&rsquo;t buy that as much)</p>

<p>Tatum was on a great team full of great players. There&rsquo;s nothing &ldquo;humbling&rdquo; about it considering he hasn&rsquo;t said a word and everyone on the outside are the ones projecting their feelings and trying to pass it off as fact. On 2028 he&rsquo;ll be in line to play a bigger role3, and life will go on.</p>

<p>Making this an every day discussion when this all came to an end a week ago is pointless. Especially when he&rsquo;s still one of the top guys playing for the defending champions. The Olympics plays zero factor in that, so who cares?</p>

<p>Edit: exact quote from JT</p>

<p>“Definitely a humbling experience, right?” Tatum said of his benching against Serbia. “Win a championship, new contract, cover of (NBA) 2K and then you sit a whole game. Cover of Sports Illustrated. So it was definitely a humbling experience.”</p>

He got better as an offball guy later in his career too, and the Olympics probably helped with that revelation</p>

      <label for="lirqwdx" class="commentText"><p>Tatum played his role. He had some nice defensive possessions and barely shot the ball in the games he played. He just didn&rsquo;t hit shots, and with the Olympics and small sample size sometimes you ride the hot hand and they did, that simple. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s Booker bought into his role and Tatum didn&rsquo;t. There were times when Tatum started in the exhibition games where he had 2 touches in the entire half, he was fine sitting in the corner. Book just came in hot and Tatum cold.</p>

<p>Catch and shooting is an extremely valuable skill in basketball, especially when you play with other good players.</p>

<p>Tatum cannot do it at a high level, Booker can be a great spot up shooter.</p>

<p>People are trying to complicate it so much (adjusting roles, how to fit in),  but it seriously just comes down to one skill, catch and shoot.</p>

<p>Tatum has always been on teams with elite spacing so he’s had more open looks. There was a stretch of years where Booker was basically the only one who could create his own offence on the Suns.</p>

<p>Overall, I do think Booker is a better pure shooter than Tatum.</p>

<p>This is not Tatum hate, as I think Tatum is still the overall better player, and better #1 option.</p>

<p>Book is better at playing off the ball, he’s better at catch and shoot, and he’s better at moving the ball. He apparently is good at shot selection, though that isn’t observed as much in the nba. 😂😂</p>

      <label for="lisc4e3" class="commentText"><p>Look, I love Melo, but he kind of was rolling in all-stars.  He played with Iverson, Billups, Stoudemire, and Chandler for years they were all stars, all in his first 8 seasons.  Tatum played with Kyrie, Al who were all stars his rookie year, and Brown.</p>

<p>Melo chose money over winning. He had an awesome career, hall of fame guy, but if he wanted to win he probably shouldn&rsquo;t have gone to New York the way he did.</p>

      <label for="lirz31y" class="commentText"><p>His contemporaries did more more with less. i.e. Bron and Wade (at least for the first half of their careers) + I&rsquo;d argue, Melo had better teammates in Denver than Bron had in Cleveland and DWade Pre - Big 3. A better argument would be it&rsquo;s because that he&rsquo;s in a tougher conference. But even then, Melo&rsquo;s play style as an NBA # 1 option isn&rsquo;t as portable as it is vs. Tatum&rsquo;s. And FYI, that Denver squad has had the talent to go far. They had AI earlier + Chauncey Billups (who was top 7 in MVP voting in 09 might I add) + great role players like Camby, KMart, young JR Smith, Nene, etc. I give u his time with the Knicks tho. They were pretty shit.</p>

      <label for="lisdzci" class="commentText"><p>Lebron didn’t win a championship before he created a super team, and had the bonus of being in the east, which meant they mostly played bad teams even in the playoffs. Also Carmelo was the best player on that team in 09.</p>

<p>the first Miami team that Wade won a championship on was pretty talent heavy and had a crooked ref working in their favour.</p>

      <label for="lis460q" class="commentText"><p>This is about seeing roles, not FIBA vs NBA, obviously NBA is harder &hellip;</p>

<p>Melo knows and admits in hindsight that he wasn&rsquo;t always clear during his career about when and how to approach his roles.</p>

<p>That said, Melo never really had a team that *should have* won a title, besides at Syracuse.</p>

<p>Tatum on the other hand, has played 2nd/3rd fiddle for a cakewalk title with a dominant team playing injured teams, but has also lost with much better teams than Melo ever had.</p>

But, Lebron and KD were ahead of him at small forward, and Booker was a more reliable shooter for the other role.  It&rsquo;s not that deep, nor was it some personal slight.</p>

<p>I really hope people get over this and it&rsquo;s just because there&rsquo;s nothing going on people need something to obsess over.</p>

<p>He was already in a shooting slump before the Olympics, especially his 3 ball has vanished, but he did everything else to perfection in the playoffs.</p>

<p>But he didn’t do any of those things at the Olympics. It looked like the Monstars had stolen his talent.</p>

<p>I think Brown deserved both MVPs, but I don&rsquo;t think it would have been crazy if Tatum got one or both.  It was really close either way.</p>
