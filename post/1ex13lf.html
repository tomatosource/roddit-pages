</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>So, with the NBA TV deals getting done, the Association is going to be turning its focus to expansion with at least 2 more teams (between Vegas, Seattle, or Mexico City). While thinking about this I started envisioning how they would be added to the league, and I eventually spiraled into the below. Bear with me, but I want to see the league eventually add 10 more teams and expand to 40 teams. Half of those teams would be an entire European division, where all 5 teams would be located in Europe. I know you’re thinking the logistics would be crazy, but that’s why I added an entire division and not just one team. That way you could have a team or division do an entire road trip over there and have a few off days on the front and back end of the trips. I go into more detail below, let me know what you think. I know I have way too much time on my hands but you’re here reading this so we’re even lol.</p>

<p>New Expansion Locations and teams and color schemes</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Barcelona, Spain –Barcelona Bullfighters (Red/Yellow/Blue)</p></li>

<li><p>Kansas City, Missouri –Kansas City Stallions (Light Blue/Red/White)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>3)Las Vegas, Nevada – Las Vegas Vipers (bright green/Black/Grey)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>London, England – London Lions (Red/White/Blue)</p></li>

<li><p>Mexico City, Mexico – M.C. Alebrijes (Multicolored)</p></li>

<li><p>Milan, Italy – P.C. (Pallacanestro Club) Milan (Green/Red/White)</p></li>

<li><p>Munich, Germany –B.C. (Basketball Club) Munich (Red/Gold/Black)</p></li>

<li><p>Paris, France – Parisian Phantoms (Violet/Crème/Gray)</p></li>

<li><p>Seattle, Washington – Seattle SuperSonics (Green/Yellow/White)</p></li>

<li><p>Vancouver, B.C. – Vancouver Spirits (Crème/Red)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>New Divisions</p>

<p>Western Conference</p>

<p>Pacific
Clippers
Golden State
Lakers
Phoenix
Vegas</p>

<p>Northwest
Portland
Sacramento
Seattle
Utah
Vancouver</p>

<p>Southwest
Dallas
Houston
Mexico City
New Orleans
San Antonio</p>

<p>Midwest
Denver
Kansas City
Memphis
Minnesota
OKC</p>

<p>Eastern Conference
Central
Chicago
Cleveland
Detroit
Indiana
Milwaukee</p>

<p>Southeast
Atlanta
Charlotte
Miami
Orlando
Washington</p>

<p>Atlantic
Boston
Knicks
Nets
Philly
Toronto</p>

<p>Euro
Barcelona
London
Milan
Munich
Paris</p>

<p>The next issue would be the 82-game schedule….A team would
Play each conference opponent 3 times….19x3=57
Play an opposing conference division twice….5x2=10
Play remaining opposing conference teams once….15x1=15
57+10+15=82</p>

<p>Lastly, with 40 teams, I figured the Play-In Tournament should expand a bit as well to involve the 6-12 seeds. It would work as a 3-round tournament, similar to how the Olympics worked after group play, except the 7 and 8 seed would receive a first-round bye and the 6th seed would receive a double bye.
Round 1
9th seed vs 12th seed, 9th seed gets homecourt.
10th seed vs 11th seed, 10th seed gets homecourt.
Loser of each game is eliminated from playoff contention.</p>

<p>Round 2
7th seed vs 8th seed, 7th seed gets homecourt.
Winner of the 9v12 game vs Winner of the 10v11 game, highest seed gets homecourt, loser of this game is eliminated from playoff contention.</p>

<p>Round 3
6th seed vs winner of 7v8 game, 6th seed gets homecourt. Winner of this game gets the 6th seed; loser gets the 7th seed.
Loser of the 7v8 game vs winner of the 9-12 2nd round game, 7v8 loser gets homecourt. Winner of this game gets the 8th seed; loser is eliminated from playoff contention.</p>

<p>This is the future of the Association. The NFL has the US in a chokehold, but the NBA is a truly global game. Adding teams overseas gives the NBA more reach to different markets, allows our international players to have teams that they can play for that are closer to home, which could make for more intriguing free agency summers.
The Play-In Tournament has proven to keep teams and fans more engaged with the regular season, longer and minimize tanking so expanding it with more teams in the league makes perfect sense.
This needs to be done by 2045, so somebody send this to the Commissioner so he can get working on it. Mr. Silver…you’re on the clock.</p>

      <label for="lj2kspg" class="commentText"><p>i&rsquo;d be surprised if the league is larger than 32 by 2045. it&rsquo;s been 20 years since charlotte was added and even they were just a makeup team for the hornets relocation. the last time the league added multiple teams at once was in 1995, which was almost 30 years ago.</p>

<p>i actually wouldn&rsquo;t mind expansion to 40+, but that&rsquo;d require massive enough revenue growth that current owners are willing to dilute their shares of the pie. it&rsquo;s possible, but seems unlikely.</p>

      <label for="lj2lm5d" class="commentText"><p>They are talking about the Celtics being sold at a $6 billion valuation, the money will be there to add the teams, plus with there being teams overseas, you could theoretically have basketball games on for an entire day, morning to night, which means MASSIVE TV deals</p>

If you have a west coast team play on the east coast then fly out there for a week then get a few days off on the back end, it would be just like a long road trip now that teams do all the time.</p>
