      <p>In a hypothetical scenario, Sacramento should’ve taken Luka no matter the fit with De’Aaron Fox. I wanted to see if there were any other scenarios like this - maybe Steph Curry having friction with Monta Ellis when he was first drafted and blossomed into a starting role?</p>

<p>Rockets took Ralph Sampson the year before. Sampson was an All-Star, Rookie of the Year, and 3X National player of the year</p>

<p>As a defensive minded 7ft4inch Center, you’d think Hakeem would be redundant</p>

<p>But they made the Finals in 86 and both Sampson and Hakeem were All-Stars</p>

He was always intended as &ldquo;one for the future&rdquo;, but accelerated his own timeline considerably.</p>

They finally got rid of one, but grabbed a different one in Donovan Mitchell.  He’s better for sure, but he has made Sexton next to useless.  And it’s not even their only redundancy, they really need to get rid of one of the two centers they’re starting.</p>

He definitely played poorly in the last two games but he was their primary offensive threat and he held his own in their defensive scheme as well. 6’6” guards/wings with his kind of athleticism and feel for the game on offense almost always get picked highly in the lottery</p>

<p>Taking Embiid when you already had a top rated C prospect in Noel (though coming off knee surgery and hadn&rsquo;t yet played in the league) seemed odd but obviously worked out.</p>

<p>The flip side, was drafting Jahlil Okafor the next year despite still having both those guys. By 2015 it was kind of clear you couldn&rsquo;t even play 2 of those guys together, let alone all three.</p>

<p>And then you compound that by drafting a non-shooter in Ben Simmons the following year after all that. Spacing-wise using 4 consecutive top 6 picks on centers and a non-shooter wing was never ever going to work, but there was no passing up Ben Simmons in that draft.</p>

      <label for="lo9hfqy" class="commentText"><p>Well, that&rsquo;s a case where they *didn&rsquo;t ignore* positional fit.  I think OP is looking for cases where they did.</p>

<p>Also i&rsquo;m pretty sure the Pistons were just enamored with Darko, I wanna say Dumars flew to NY and met him for a midnight workout or something where he was said to have really wowed the staff.  I could be making stuff up though idk.</p>

      <label for="lo9ujnk" class="commentText"><p>Speaking of Fox, the Kings actually did draft the best player available regardless of position when they took Hali at 12 in the 2020 draft despite having a 22 y/o Fox at PG coming off a 21 and 7 season. A rare winning draft decision by the Kings!</p>

      <label for="lo9pvdq" class="commentText"><p>I personally think the reason &ldquo;drafting for fit&rdquo; is often times only an excuse for GMs and their scouting department  for misjudging talent.</p>

<p>Nobody would ever draft a fit, if you have a better talent available.</p>

<p>The thing is, the evaluation of talent is very clouded, thats why people then make the safe bet by drafting for fit, because they arent sure, which player has more potential.</p>

<p>If they knew player A is the more talented player, they would pick him no matter the fit.</p>

<p>Tim Duncan and David Robinson comes also in mind.</p>
