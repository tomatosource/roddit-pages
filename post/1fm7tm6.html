      <p>In a hypothetical scenario, Sacramento should’ve taken Luka no matter the fit with De’Aaron Fox. I wanted to see if there were any other scenarios like this - maybe Steph Curry having friction with Monta Ellis when he was first drafted and blossomed into a starting role?</p>

      <label for="lo8j86l" class="commentText"><p>Hakeem comes to mind.</p>

<p>Rockets took Ralph Sampson the year before. Sampson was an All-Star, Rookie of the Year, and 3X National player of the year</p>

<p>As a defensive minded 7ft4inch Center, you’d think Hakeem would be redundant</p>

<p>But they made the Finals in 86 and both Sampson and Hakeem were All-Stars</p>

It&rsquo;s actually rare to have just a single rookie be able to turn a franchise around in 1 season.</p>

      <label for="lo8vepp" class="commentText"><p>Philly taking center after center after center during the Process.</p>

<p>Taking Embiid when you already had a top rated C prospect in Noel (though coming off knee surgery and hadn&rsquo;t yet played in the league) seemed odd but obviously worked out.</p>

<p>The flip side, was drafting Jahlil Okafor the next year despite still having both those guys. By 2015 it was kind of clear you couldn&rsquo;t even play 2 of those guys together, let alone all three.</p>

<p>And then you compound that by drafting a non-shooter in Ben Simmons the following year after all that. Spacing-wise using 4 consecutive top 6 picks on centers and a non-shooter wing was never ever going to work, but there was no passing up Ben Simmons in that draft.</p>
