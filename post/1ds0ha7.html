      <label for="laz7zun" class="commentText"><p>This handcuffs franchise flexibility more than player paychecks. I think we’ll see more of a “middle class” of nba salaries pop up over unfettered max contracts being offered. After this Paul George contract I think fewer guys will get that 35% max contract which ultimately is good for the most number of guys in the players union.</p>

      <label for="lb0q0tp" class="commentText"><p>The league just agreed to a new TV deal that’s worth $7 billion annually and even though the finals ratings have been down the past 3 years and almost half of what they were in 2017 they seem motivated to establish a hard cap to stop continuity of those championship dynasties. Every new CBA comes in with the goal of closing the way the last super team was formed. There are certainly unintended consequences but if you look at the trends of these rules there is very much a pointed effort to limit how long each team is on top.</p>

<p>When the Warriors were in the middle of their dynasty the league implemented the harshest luxury tax penalties in history and Joe Lacob to his credit just accepted it and continued to write big checks to the league year after year. This new 2nd apron rules makes it an even harder to keep the same core of players all well paid together in an effort to disperse talent more evenly across the league. Only time will tell if it’s successful.</p>

Since the KD Warriors, there’s been pretty great parity and attempts at super teams have failed miserably.

<p>Prior to this span, we had the exact same Finals matchup for 4 consecutive years.</p>

<p>Owners can’t just pay the luxury tax and be okay with it. It is completely okay to bounce between the 1st and 2nd apron. But you stay in the 2nd too long and it gets bad for you really quickly.</p>

      <label for="layzs33" class="commentText"><p>Agreed, it seems like it is to enforce a new rotating group of contenders every couple years. Everyone can go into the 2nd apron for at most 2 out of every 5 years without very severe repercussions, so teams can take turns going into the 2nd apron and contending. AKA every contender can only do so for 2 years at a time, then they have to cool off for 3. It gives the smaller market teams a chance to get that revenue and popularity boost from contending while the main players cool off.</p>

      <label for="laz30y9" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m curious about the 2nd apron and the picks going to the back of the draft.  The exact wording from the CBA is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Draft Pick Penalty” means, for a Team’s first round draft
pick, that such draft pick shall be the final draft pick in the
first round of the applicable NBA Draft (regardless of the
position in the first round of the Draft at which the Team
otherwise would have selected pursuant to NBA rules
governing the order of selection by Teams in the Draft)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the Team is a Second Apron Team for two (2) or
more of such four (4) Salary Cap Years, then such
first round draft pick shall be subject to a Draft Pick
Penalty;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the Knicks keep Hartenstein at the ~17.2MM max they can offer and Dadiet&rsquo;s ~2.7MM, that will put them over the 2nd apron (with only 12 players signed, so still need to acquire 2 more to meet minimum roster requirements) in <sup>2024</sup>&frasl;<sub>2025</sub> (Year 1 of passing the 2nd apron).  Brunson will opt out of his contract in <sup>2025</sup>&frasl;<sub>2026</sub> and seek a max contract, and I think he&rsquo;d qualify for the 30% / 5 year max.  This would push them above the 2nd apron again (Year 2 in 4), and mean that they&rsquo;d be given a draft pick penalty.</p>

<p>For the Nets, who own the Knicks&rsquo; pick in 2025/2027/2029/2031, does this mean that they will be drafting at #30 each year?  Assuming no other 2nd apron repeaters.  That&rsquo;s my reading of the rules, but haven&rsquo;t seen anyone really discuss it.  Other teams that this situation would apply to would be OKC with the Clippers going over the 2nd apron, Houston with the Suns, Utah with the Timberwolves, and I&rsquo;m sure there are a few others.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>First, you can&rsquo;t trade picks more than 7 years into the future.</p>

<p>Second, when you hit apron 2, the pick 7 years into the  then future gets frozen for trade. The penalty is not immediate</p>

<p>Third when you repeat the 2nd apron, it&rsquo;s only then that the frozen pick (which used to be 7 years into the future ) gets dropped to end of round 1</p>

<p>So penalties for Knicks hitting apron 2 in 2024-5 is to get 2032 frp frozen. Then if they repeat, say in 2025-6 , then the 2032 pick gets droppped and the 2033 pick gets frozen</p>

<p>If they hit 2nd apron in 2024-5, avoid it in 2025-6 and repeat hitting 2nd apron in 2026-7, then the 2032 pick gers frozen (in 2025), the 2034 pick gets frozen and the 2032 pick gets dropped (which happensin 2027)</p>

<p>If they hit the 2nd apron in 2024-5 but stay out of it for 3 consecutive years, everything gets reset</p>

<p>If the Knicks remain above the second apron this year, their 2032 pick is frozen. This means they cannot trade it. This rule does not affect the picks they already traded.</p>

<p>Now the Knicks will be allowed to stay over the 2nd apron in 2025-2026, that’s year 2 of them being over the apron. They still can’t trade 2032, and now 2033 is also frozen since it’s year 1 where the 2033 pick is concerned.</p>

<p>Now the bullshit starts if they end year 2026-2027 over the second apron. Not only can they still not trade  2032 pick, but it is effectively locked into bottom of the first round. There now will be no way for that pick to trade hands and it’s a shit pick guaranteed. That’s how it works</p>

<p>Now on the other side, let’s say the Knicks are over the apron 2024-2025 and 2025-2026, and they say enough is enough. If they dip out of the 2nd apron for the next 3 years, (or any 3 out of the 4 years once the pick is frozen and untraceable), the pick reverts to normal. This is why you hear teams talking about 2 year windows, ie dip over the apron for 2 years, then stay out of it for 3 to maintain full pick flexibility, and of course avoid all the other penalties the 2nd apron provides.</p>

<p>Long story short, this doesn’t affect picks that are already traded</p>

And I think someone else said that it would only apply to your own pick and not if another team owns it (I can&rsquo;t find the source on this though).</p>

<p>Also, the Knicks wouldn&rsquo;t go over the second apron. They would be hardcapped under the second apron. Assuming we clear the first apron, we would need to aggregate multiple salaries to make the Mikal trade happen.. which would then hardcap us at the second apron.</p>

<p>Basically at the end of the 2024-2025 regular season if a team is hard-capped then their 2032 1st(which they would not be able to include in trades until the next NBA year begins) is now frozen and not allowed to be traded/swapped.</p>

<p>If that team remains hard-capped at the end of any of the next 3 years that frozen pick will be moved to the end of the first round.</p>

<p>So the only frozen picks are those that get frozen before they were ever able to be traded.</p>

<p>To me, that doesn&rsquo;t read as the frozen pick 7 years out but the pick on the in the draft after the 2nd year.  I&rsquo;d much rather it be the 7-year out frozen pick though, lol.</p>

The penalty is two fold - the last first round pick and as the years get closer to it, that pick becomes far less valuable to trade. I personally think that part of the rule is way to heavy handed, a team is gonna suck and draft 30th at some point. Like a 20 win team knowing they draft last. </p>

      <label for="lazb4zd" class="commentText"><p>The new cap structure will be good for the league eventually, but there will be serious growing pains until it becomes the “new normal”.</p>

<p>It should lead to more parity in the league, and more quality games being played on any given night. It exists to make sure more teams have an actual “star” player, without having to pay good-but-not-great players the max just to keep them from leaving.</p>

<p>It’s going to suck for fans of superteams, because the clock is ticking and they’ll have to cut talent eventually. But it should also lead to much better scouting and player development, because developing young players well is going to be vital in filling out a roster.</p>

<p>I think there are some other options they could have used that may have been better or helped with this solution, but I think it’s a good start if the end goal is parity.</p>

      <label for="laziwnw" class="commentText"><p>The nba has the worst cba. It’s unbelievably complicated and most of the fans will never fully understand it.. </p>

<p>Instead of just moving to a hard cap like they should they add more complications onto an already complicated cba and I’m guessing with in a few years almost every gm and owner in the nba will regret what they have done and before the time any of these “frozen picks” are used they will have changed the rules back. Just wait till the Knicks or lakers are horrible in the 31 season and are stuck with pick 32 in a draft with the next big thing. Things will change real quick. Or worse, when 15 teams have frozen picks and the team that wins the title in 31 is picking in the lottery. </p>

      <label for="lazrxoy" class="commentText"><p>wut?</p>

<p>This cba is what players of all the other leagues envy! Dafuq are you talking about?!</p>

<p>Small rosters with completely <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> revenue split.</p>

<p>Never in the history of the league have players benefitted more than with this cba.</p>

<p>Complicated? Sure. But none of that matters in comparison to the value they return.</p>
