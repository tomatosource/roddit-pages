Who knows, maybe if he had done different things to help his ankles or take more adequate rest, (not saying it’s his fault btw) then his ankles may have reacted better to the roll. Who knows if he’s been rolling it more recently but it’s gone unreported.</p>

      <label for="ldx4eup" class="commentText"><p>Injuries are complex and it&rsquo;s really difficult to say whether something did or didn&rsquo;t play a role, even for contact injuries. Some people have some heinous looking rolled ankles that they just walk off without any issues, while others will be out for months from something that looks innocuous.</p>

<p>How mobile and resilient a joint and its components are can play a huge role in how someone responds to unusual external stimulus like a potential contact injury. Proper recovery and training can do a lot for mobility and strength of the connective tissues.</p>

      <label for="ldw9zcj" class="commentText"><p>They have very different playstyles. Wemby is a wing in a bigs body. His offensive and defensive load is insane. Edey is a true slow big who isn&rsquo;t expected to be a part time ball-handler on offense and if for some reason he ever gets switched against a guard on the perimeter, he&rsquo;s expected to get cooked anyways while Wemby is still expected to keep up. Wemby is expected to do everything when he&rsquo;s out there, Edey just has to play his role of being a constant looming threat in the paint. Different expectations from these two to start with</p>

      <label for="ldvm0zc" class="commentText"><p>The difference is Edey has played two full seasons of college ball as an ironman playing 32 mpg with heavy usage. Maybe him being older will be a detriment coming into the league, but IMO his lack of injury history despite playing so much ball is a good sign. He’s also played hockey and baseball so he’s a decently well rounded athlete.</p>

If he was making more plays like this one, selling out off balance for blocks, I’m sure he would have dealt with more injuries.</p>

<p>Overall weight is a big factor in long term injury risk for bigs and lack of flexibility also increases the odds too, Wemby carries much less injury risk than Edey if we are comparing them.</p>

      <label for="ldyxd10" class="commentText"><p>Wemby actually was 19 when he entered the league, but in any case I’m not sure what you’re getting at in regards to their age difference factoring in to who would be more or less likely to be injured? If anything to me that points to the fact that Wemby was playing in a league against grown men as a teenager (and again, leading the league in minutes) while Edey’s track record is against less physically mature/strong/big opponents, in a slower paced college game. Wemby also came into the league with a training staff and a flexibility/mobility regimen that was the stuff of legend.</p>

<p>All that said, I actually am optimistic about Edey’s potential to have a healthy career (assuming reasonable minutes management which I would say the same for Wemby), I just don’t understand why one of these guy’s health would be doubted and not the other when the only basis for the criticism (rare size that has carried a historically poor track record of longevity) applies to both.</p>

      <label for="ldz2r0t" class="commentText"><p>When he was 19 and 190 pounds coming into the league? Yeah absolutely I think he had high injury risk as he would be playing harder and putting on more weight. Again, we are talking about their injury risk coming into the league, and Wemby was young and very skinny at that point, while Edey has played 2 years at basically his max weight without serious injury.</p>

<p>I think Wembys injury outlook going forward is basically as good as it can be, he’s putting on weight responsibly and he takes care of his body, but basically adding any weight to a 7’4 frame is going to add some injury risk.</p>

      <label for="ldvnsxa" class="commentText"><p>And Wemby has played a full NBA season at 30 mpg, Yao Ming played injury free in College and his first year in the NBA. That&rsquo;s not what matters for players this size. What matters is to keep your weight down and work as much as possible on flexibility and injury prevention like Kareem did. Edey has not done anything that makes me think he&rsquo;ll be different from all those 7&rsquo;3 players that got constantly injured.</p>

      <label for="ldvob87" class="commentText"><p>Meh. I’m not praying on the guys downfall, yeah it’s statistically against his favour, but he’s not super explosive and he’s been healthy so far. Also how is Wembys NBA season relevant? We are talking about how they look coming into the league. And nothing except for the history of big men points to Edey being injury prone.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The point was that even after playing healthy for a season, the big narrative question is whether he&rsquo;ll remain healthy or not, same for Chet even though that&rsquo;s a bit more understandable. Only Edey seems exempt of this, when he&rsquo;s probably among the biggest risk imo</p>

      <label for="ldvwqrs" class="commentText"><p>When had Edey ever been exempt from the injury risk questions lmao? Health is a question for pretty much any 7 footer unless they can spend multiple years in the league without injury, and even then even one injury can turn their career around.</p>

<p>But acting like Edey hasn’t had injury risk criticism is ridiculous lmao. He probably didn’t get as much as Wemby, but he also wasn’t the greatest prospect since lebron so he never got as much media attention anyways. And until recently the narrative was that he wouldn’t even be able to play in the league because he’s too slow, people weren’t even thinking about injuries because they were still saying he won’t even make the league and he’ll get played off the court.</p>

      <label for="ldx4esk" class="commentText"><p>WAY better than I thought he would be.  Every single time he gets the ball in the post it completely collapses the defense.  It usually doesn&rsquo;t matter and he still scores or just looks over everyone&rsquo;s head and passes to one of the several open people standing on the 3 point line.  I&rsquo;ve been most surprised by his defense though.  Looks like a completely different player than he was at Purdue.  He looks like a very good drop coverage big.  His box outs are excellent and he dominates the boards.  I wasn&rsquo;t very high on him coming out but I was dead wrong.  The big boy is awesome so far</p>

If you watch the early part of the champ game again vs UConn, that was him going all out (which I think gassed him a bit more than usual). He was killing it on defense early in that game.</p>
