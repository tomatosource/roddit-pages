<p>“I keep hearing that Paul, if he actually makes to free agency at some point, would draw interest from the Clippers as well as the Lakers. Paul&rsquo;s desire to play as close to his L.A.-based family as possible is well-known, but I&rsquo;m told interest in bringing him to the Lakers might not be unanimous within the organization despite Paul&rsquo;s well-chronicled friendship with LeBron James.”</p>

It wouldn&rsquo;t be too absurd for his parents to drive there from Palmdale on long home stays.</p>

<p>As for the Clippers, a CP homecoming would probably help sell tickets and then a young guy and some picks would be great giving our lack of assets</p>

      <label for="la0banf" class="commentText"><p>Morey also has a huge ego and thinks he’s always the smartest person in the room. It would make him look so dumb to refuse to pay harden, then lose in the first round by a combined point differential of 1, effectively wasting a year of embiids prime and his first star level series ever, only to give that max to hardens team mate, when harden was clearly better than him this year.</p>

<p>Especially since most of what’s been said has been that the clippers want to bring pg back, but they can live without him and it’s not as important as bringing harden back. You can make up for a decent scoring and defending wing in aggregate, you can’t replace an all time great floor general with hardens size/strength and ability to hit crazy shots short of like Luka demanding to go to the clippers lol</p>

<p>But the Clippers have no leverage in this situation. Paul George can opt out and leave them with nothing and it isn’t like the Clippers suddenly gain a lot of flexibility in their roster construction. They would still have Kawhi and a lot of other contracts as well as needing to retain Harden.</p>

<p>So Chris Paul + a pick or two and that is likely what the Clippers would get.</p>

<p>A trade for a guy who can leave in free agency is never going to be fair value. The more leverage the Clippers keep the better, but right now there doesn’t seem to be much.</p>

      <label for="la0j5hx" class="commentText"><p>Just because PG can become a full fa if he wants to doesn’t mean they don’t have a ton of leverage. This is his last chance at a max contract. He’s not opting out until the sign and trade has been fully worked out and he has his guaranteed contract signed. The clippers would also much rather send Paul George to the sixers for cheap than to gift him to the warriors while taking on the shit the warriors don’t want in return.</p>

<p>The Warriors could even offer something including Wiggins instead of Chris Paul and CP3’s non-guaranteed salary could be cut. (Allowing Paul to sign with them in free agency)</p>

      <label for="l9yikzd" class="commentText"><p>It would be very tough straight up because the Clippers are limited to 100% salary matching and the Warriors would be hardcapped at the first apron if they took PG in a sign&amp;trade.  I&rsquo;m presuming a 4 year max, starting at <span class="math inline">\(49.35M (35% of an estimated \)</span>141M cap) for PG.  The Warriors are only $3M under the first apron if Klay walks, and any excess players traded would be replaced by vet minimums, so a trade like CP3/GP2/Kuminga wouldn&rsquo;t work because the Warriors wouldn&rsquo;t be able to fill their roster under the hardcap.</p>

<p>It would have to be a 3 team trade, with CP3 going to one team and Wiggins to another.  Something like</p>

<p>Clippers get: Chris Paul, Jonathan Kuminga, DET SRP</p>

<p>Warriors get: Paul George</p>

<p>Pistons get: Andrew Wiggins, GSW FRP, LAC SRP</p>

<p>Clippers recoup some return instead of losing Paul George for nothing and save $60M at the same time, Warriors get Paul George while also shedding salary and getting under the luxury tax, Pistons get a first round pick in exchange for cap space they had to use anyway.</p>

He&rsquo;d get a little bit more money per year on a max deal due to the cap going up, at the risk of nobody being willing to give him a max because he starts declining, which is a real risk for 35 year olds.  He should want to maximize his guaranteed money.  If the Warriors wouldn&rsquo;t offer him a max 4 year deal and he doesn&rsquo;t want to go to Philly, he should just stay put in LA.</p>

      <label for="l9z6dkj" class="commentText"><p>I wouldn’t be skeptical about this trade due to the assets, just more about the extension George would be expecting. That puts him likely being on the Warriors without Steph unless Steph plays until he is like 40.</p>

<p>It is very possible the Warriors choose not to make any big moves and instead try to get off Wiggins, cut Chris Paul, and let Klay walk. While letting Kuminga progress and resumes his role as the second option, while giving Podz and Moody both bigger roles.</p>

<p>Steph, Moody, Kuminga, Draymond, Trayce</p>

<p>This could be the lineup that the team primarily uses if Kuminga is able to play the 3.</p>

<p>Podz could be the backup 1 and also play the 2. Moody could play the 3 and Kuminga could play the 4. Draymond could also be put in sometimes at the 5.</p>

<p>I hope that this isn’t the direction the team takes, but it seems like an actual possibility.. and I could understand it. (It would massively help the cap situation of the team and prepare the team for Moody and Kuminga’s extensions).</p>

      <label for="la0a0ae" class="commentText"><p>How do people even include them together? Harden and cp3 are some of the best playoff performers of all time by any actual fact or metric.</p>

<p>I don’t think Russ has ever been a net positive in a single playoffs. The defense ignores him completely, he has one season where he shot 54% ts in the playoffs, and then a couple where he just barely broke 50% ts. And the fact that he’s this inefficient in every playoffs while the defense doesn’t guard him at all yet still shoots as much as possible makes him such a net negative.</p>

<p>I honestly think even in his prime with kd they would’ve been better off if they had some average starting pg that could facilitate and shoot halfway decently, but didn’t try to be the star of the team and knew his role.</p>

<p>It’s not a coincidence that kd had his best season when Russ was out.</p>

<p>It’s not a coincidence that they absolutely destroyed the west in the playoffs while in their early 20s, then in the finals the heat literally said their entire defensive strategy was to stop harden and get the ball out of his hands (so Russ would have it more) and then Russ took more shots than kd on atrocious efficiency.</p>

<p>It would have been unthinkable at the time, because Russ was young and crazy athletic and already seen as a star, no one knew he would basically never really improve or develop and skills that weren’t entirely based on athleticism, but if okc traded Russ for a haul and paid harden the thunder probably have multiple rings and kd never leaves.</p>

      <label for="la0hdr4" class="commentText"><p>I still don’t think any team could win a ring with even prime Westbrook on it. It’s not a coincidence that in hardens like second season they absolutely tore through the west to the point they were the favorites against the heatles. Who finally were the ones to realize your entire defensive strategy should be to shut down harden and get the ball out of his hands (and into Westbrook’s) because Westbrook will always take as many shots as possible while the defense barely pretends to guard him on atrocious efficiency. Then the rest is history, every team always played him in the playoffs that way, it literally always worked, he never learned a single thing, then they didn’t have anyone who could facilitate like harden, and had to pay the max to a player who was always a net negative in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="l9yny84" class="commentText"><p>What is the reasoning with the Clippers? The only thing I could see is if George leaves and they want someone on an expiring deal to ride out with their old core, while also having him be an expiring to flip at the deadline or something. In terms of basketball fit, I don&rsquo;t understand the intent. Harden and Westbrook fit together poorly, and Paul fits poorly with both of them.he&rsquo;s old, misses games, is a traffic cone on defense, and is mostly reliant on controlling the game with the ball. He can&rsquo;t play next to Westbrook, and the Clippers would need a Minnesota-level defensive core to endure putting Harden and Paul on the floor together.</p>

      <label for="la0cvhi" class="commentText"><p>Almost no one can play well next to Westbrook. Kd and harden are the only players to get even close to winning a playoff series, and 2020 harden was incredible in the playoffs, even with being doubled every time he crossed half court because he was playing with Russ. He was probably the second best scorer in the playoffs that year, out of teams that won in the first round only Lebron and AD had a higher ts % and he was scoring more than AD while basically playing 4 v 5 on offense and all the defensive attention focused on him. I honestly felt bad for harden that year, he was playing so well, it was the first year post kd warriors, and then he has to play the championship lakers with Lebron and AD, was doubled at all times while they barely even looked at Russ, still put up an efficient 29, and Russ bricked them out of the series on like low 30s ts%.</p>

<p>I wonder if kd and harden ever commiserate over how much it sucks to have Russ as your second option. At least harden only had to do it once, but by then Russ didn’t have a prayer of shooting over 50% ts virtually unguarded. He also never learned a single thing, playoff defenses would play him the same way every year and every year he would just jack up so many shots his teams never had a chance.</p>

<p>Actually come to think of it what valuable skill has Russ ever had in his entire career? Even when he was in his prime he was never a good finisher at the rim, he was just athletic enough to explode for a dunk. He literally cannot score well from anywhere unless it’s a dunk. He was a bad defender, he just made himself look decent to casuals because he gambled for steals. Despite the narratives harden was basically an athletic 6’5 linebacker playing pg and constantly switched onto bigs while being one of the best post defenders in the league. He had a season where he defended the most post ups in the league and held opponents to the lowest percentage. Facilitating? Nope. He got his 10 assists but they were basically all from spamming drive and kicks and then throwing crap to a team mate on the perimeter or his big over and over until he hit ten. For every assist there were multiple plays where he forced a team mate into an extremely difficult shot and just wasted the possession. He’s never been able to shoot, yet his bbiq is so bad he will always take the most shots while shooting like 45% ts on a good day even when his team mate is one of the greatest scorers ever. It’s not a coincidence that Russ never even came close to getting out of the first round without harden or kd dragging him there, won a total of four playoff games in three years in okc post kd, then old cp3 came in and won three in one year, while facing Westbrook lol. It’s also not a coincidence that as soon as he lost his athleticism his “playmaking” sucked, while when cp3 and harden lost theirs they were still the best in the league. Rebounding maybe yeah he was above average but the fact that he would just ball watch instead of getting back to get those ten rebounds made it not even a positive.</p>

<p>This is turning into a way too long rant but it boggles my mind that there’s an mvp who never developed a single basketball skill in his career. He was just really athletic. Like he would’ve had the most impact on winning if he just played minor minutes with an all time great facilitator and just cut for dunks/lobs and let the team create wide open lanes to the rim for him.</p>

<p>Instead he was basically a much smaller Ben Simmons with none of the defense and if Ben was still unable to shoot but shot like 20 times a game. Idk what’s worse in the playoffs honestly, having everyone on both teams know you will never take a jump shot, or to having defenses basically beg you to shoot because they know you’ll jack up an absurd amount of shots on atrocious efficiency</p>
