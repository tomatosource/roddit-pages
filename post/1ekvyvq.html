If you mounted it the perfect distance from their face, put a video on repeat and just left it there, it would probably have a negative impact on them. But no one would ever do that, because even your laziest POS parent won&rsquo;t do it because it&rsquo;s functionally ineffective. Lazy parents give their kids an iPad because they don&rsquo;t want to parent them. You don&rsquo;t parent a 7 week old.</p>

<p>Both MJ and Dennis have been mobbed by media for close to 40 years or more. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a jab to acknowledge that their patience/attention span for partaking in interviews like this is critically low by now. But I also think it&rsquo;s reasonable to use some clever means to keep them engaged.</p>

Anyone who has one would immediately sniff the bullshit when he said &ldquo;trying to keep my 7 week old&rsquo;s attention.&rdquo; When you spend any substantial amount of time as a parent, you can immediately pick up on parenting cues. You can see people who have never held a baby in their life. It&rsquo;s just very visible. I would venture to far as to say anyone who has parented for a bit would never use that analogy because it&rsquo;s a dumb analogy. You don&rsquo;t &ldquo;keep the attention of your 7 week old.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lgo5vlx" class="commentText"><p>No I don’t have any children, but I don’t get it. Are you saying he’s lying about having a 7 week old or that he’s a terrible parent? Has it occurred to you that a first-time parent of a 7 week old might be new to parenting?</p>

<p>You’re also making stark conclusions on this guy’s parenting skills based on a single line in a basketball interview that was intended as an obvious joke - “it’s like dealing with a baby.” It was a joke.</p>

<p>Take a step back and ask yourself what you’re doing.</p>

      <label for="lgo6pco" class="commentText"><p>Sure, I&rsquo;ll explain clearer. I&rsquo;m saying that it&rsquo;s exceedingly likely that as a DIRECTOR and parent of a 7 week old, he hasn&rsquo;t seen that much of his kid and hasn&rsquo;t had an active hand in parenting them. If someone said that an actor or another workaholic had a nanny raise their kid, no one bats an eye, right? Between work, travel, and the media cycle, dude is probaby never home. Please note, I never said he&rsquo;s a shit parent. I said he probably hasn&rsquo;t had an active hand in the day-to-day of his 7 week old. That shit happens, bud. You&rsquo;ve got 80 hour work week, three job moms and dads that do the exact same thing.</p>

      <label for="lgo9d1i" class="commentText"><p>But that’s completely different. The comment here that we’re both replying to is conjecturing about how this guy supposedly gives his 2 month old an iPad just like with Rodman, but he never said that at all. And it’s pretty obviously intended as a shot at his parenting, based on very incomplete information.</p>

<p>I have no idea how much this guy is at home or not, and neither do you. Just because he’s a director it doesn’t mean he doesn’t spend substantial time with his family, especially since his documentary work if you look at his filmography doesn’t necessarily involve him spending 6 months in another country. So how could you possibly know that?</p>

My opinion is my own, and it&rsquo;s certainly not that he uses his iPad on his 7 week old. That makes no sense, and I said so in another post.</p>

<p>I may not know for sure (and I said as much in my original post, which is the parent of this thread), but I made an educated guess based on watching the video, listening to his verbiage, and my own experience as a parent. As an aside, if you&rsquo;re going to talk about his documentary work, he&rsquo;s currently working on a project on the 2024 Olympics basketball team. Which is happening right now. In another country.</p>

Anyone with kids is going to say “wtf lol” I’m sure it’s just an offhand comment he made and he may have even misspoke but it just reads weird as fuck.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t go far enough to say he hates his kid but that’s something that only someone who has never met a two month old baby would even think to say. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m Michael Jordan—a man who&rsquo;s been in the public eye and under the microscope for over 40 years—I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m interested in doing much of anything involving the media for any reason. And if I do agree to an interview, I&rsquo;d probably have a short leash for whoever&rsquo;s trying to get something out of me.</p>

<p>In that case, if you&rsquo;re an interviewer and you know you&rsquo;ve got a marathon interview session coming up with Michael Jordan, I&rsquo;m guessing you&rsquo;re going to try to do whatever you can to ensure he remains a willing participant, since I&rsquo;m guessing this was more a situation of MJ doing them a favor rather than the opposite.</p>

<p>As such, yeah, cigar, liquor, iPad, I say provide what needed to be provided to make things work for both parties.</p>

<p>Analogizing grown men (who this director is clearly  significantly younger than) to newborn babies and 6 year olds at church feels like a poor way to communicate this. Especially when you consider he is using their platform and achievements as the basis of his piece.</p>

<p>So I guess I would say I agree with the point/idea of what he is saying, but the way it’s being communicated comes across as disrespectful.</p>

<p>And perhaps I&rsquo;m giving him too much credit or leeway. I just know how sometimes when you&rsquo;re being interviewed or in an otherwise live &amp; recorded conversation, some things don&rsquo;t necessarily come out the way you intend. It also seemed his broader point was just to say that the use of the iPads (a topic broached by Pablo Torres) was more a matter of function rather than an arbitrary artistic decision on his own behalf.</p>

<p>I imagine keeping notable media darlings Michael Jordan and Dennis fucking Rodman engaged for an extended interview session going over moments they had already talked about 1000 times before, for 20 plus years, while looking and sounding good for film, was probably really difficult. This isn&rsquo;t a phone call, it&rsquo;s a core piece of the series and it has to be good.</p>

<p>empathizing with parents regarding the time and energy demands of child rearing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t disagree with your opinions at large but it’s weird to me how it’s consistently framed as this binary “either the kids are watched by the parents or they need a screen when the parents are tired.”</p>

<p>Why not… let them just play with blocks or some shit by themselves? I’m showing my age but I was a latchkey kid, I think helicopter parents are bad but even at age 4-5 I’d just play imagination with my Thomas the Tank toys for hours at a time. It’s weird when the choices feel like only: Parental supervision or a screen.</p>

      <label for="lgoa8n5" class="commentText"><p>Oh for sure, I&rsquo;m quite fond of nuance so I&rsquo;m with you here. Rarely is anything a matter of all or nothing in reality.</p>

<p>I think I had a relatively normal upbringing and I spent my fair share of time playing Ninja Turtles &amp; He-Man or pretending my bed was a car and I was the mechanic in charge of fixing it, but I also remember watching Reading Rainbow &amp; Sesame Street before I turned six. And The Flight of the Navigator. And cartoons. It seemed like my parents balanced things out relatively well.</p>

<p>Now, as for why some parents fall into giving their kids a screen at certain times? I&rsquo;m not a parent so it&rsquo;s probably not fair for me to answer but here I go anyway. In some cases I assumed it was just the path of least resistance. Some kids can be reliably occupied by blocks or toys for hours, others can be a bit more finnicky about it (some days they&rsquo;ll play with blocks for hours, other days for 10 minutes).</p>

<p>However, I think the draw (and simultaneously the danger) of screens is how reliable they are for parents and kids alike. It generally plops the kid in a single spot and holds their attention, maybe allowing for a parent to get some rest or take care of some chores (best case scenario) or just neglect their child altogether (worst case scenario).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve kind of seen the same thing when it comes to taking children on roadtrips/vacation. I grew up in the era when the extent of our roadtrip time occupiers were outside observation or those Tiger brand handheld video games. After those two things wore out their welcome, yeah, I bet a lot of my fellow kids in that era could become a bit bored and annoying during roadtrips.</p>

<p>But then the in-car DVD screen showed up and suddenly kids turned into quiet zombies. No more fighting between siblings, no more cries of boredom. Just movies. And of course, it&rsquo;s easy to see the inherent risks of that sort of parental decision. But I bet there&rsquo;s a lot of guilty parties out there who admit they do take solace in the peace and quiet.</p>

      <label for="lgo4z6k" class="commentText"><p>&ldquo;Shit even a ton of the well-educated parents try defending it by saying it’s only educational videos.</p>

<p>I mean yeah those videos are better than worldstar but it still feels bad IMO to put a screen in front of any kid until they’re at least like 4-5, hell 6. Boomer take probably but read some fuckin’ books to your kids lol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Realistically, maybe 1% of parents would completely withhold a screen till a kid is 6. That&rsquo;s totally unrealistic. I am super strict about no screen time during the week, but hell, when you have to make dinner or get an emergency work thing, a screen is an absolutely necessary tool in small doses.</p>

I think he was just saying he needed to use some tricks to hold the attention of both and in Dennis&rsquo; case, it was an iPad that did the job.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t even think he meant it in a particularly disrespectful way. Rather, those sorts of interview sessions for documentaries can be long and laborious and when you&rsquo;ve got a couple guys who&rsquo;ve seen it all from the media front and are at times extremely reluctant to partake, it probably takes some maneuvering to ensure they stay keyed in for the full session without either burning out or becoming disinterested.</p>

<p>He basically claims MJ and his team were at first disinterested in doing a sit down interview for the documentary; since MJ has done countless interviews in general and about that period of his life specifically, they felt he had said all there was to say already, and didn’t think it was necessary to make MJ sit through another.</p>

<p>Having him comment on highlights and respond to clips of his peers differed from the standard interview process enough that MJ (presumably) didn’t feel like he was wasting his time doing something he’d done countless times before. Personally I think it also made it more entertaining.</p>

They got approval for that with the condition that Jordan would have full control over the documentary.    Jordan didn&rsquo;t particularly want to do it and kept rejecting it until he decided to finally green light it after 20 years on (no joke) the same frickin day the Cavs had their victory parade after winning in 2016.</p>

      <label for="lgnr3n9" class="commentText"><p>Sounds like an irrelevant douché trying to find any relevance, he had his 5 minutes after everyone watched the series and some memes came out. People have used iPads for highlights and clips in interviews since iPads were invented, before it was a vcr and tv. Sounds extra salty about the baby remark, wonder what happened.</p>

I use my phone and pad for distractions all the time. I have seen TLD a few times, love it, I couldn’t tell you this guys name before, but no jab at his other work, just these comments of his are nonsense and makes him sound like a douché.</p>

<p>Technically, yes, but their relationship is a touch strained last I saw - <a href="https://justwomenssports.com/reads/trinity-rodman-dennis-family-relationship-uswnt-world-cup-2023/" target="_blank">https://justwomenssports.com/reads/trinity-rodman-dennis-family-relationship-uswnt-world-cup-2023/</a></p>

      <label for="lgnj6rt" class="commentText"><p>Yea it is. They asked Trinity about it after she scored a goal this Olympics, something like “did your dad text you” and it was super awkward. She handled it well. She said no but my mom hugged me (great answer to a bad question), but you can tell the interview got a bit weird. </p>

      <label for="lgobsef" class="commentText"><p>Does untreated mental illness make someone a great personality? Rodman is really just Draymond with the benefit of nostalgia. He doesn&rsquo;t even have one of the greatest personalities in Power Forward history. Chuck, KG, Durant, John Salley, Blake Griffin. There&rsquo;s a lot of options.</p>

It comes off as disrespectful because he’s trying to throw shade and get a headline. Wack interview in my opinion and i’d love for him to rephrase because he’s actually providing some interesting insight into what goes on behind the cameras but no one is going to read past the quote anyways.</p>
