If you mounted it the perfect distance from their face, put a video on repeat and just left it there, it would probably have a negative impact on them. But no one would ever do that, because even your laziest POS parent won&rsquo;t do it because it&rsquo;s functionally ineffective. Lazy parents give their kids an iPad because they don&rsquo;t want to parent them. You don&rsquo;t parent a 7 week old.</p>

<p>I first tried to say that she will need glasses if she stands so close. But the issue is her older brother who has CP and is non verbal needs glasses- so I can’t diminish glasses as a negative to her. Then he will not want to wear them. He seems to understand things I’m new to this.</p>

<p>So what do I do with her? Her father really yells at her and isn’t the most nurturing. I’m looking just for tips as a day sitter. </p>

      <label for="lgs8qxf" class="commentText"><p>Agreed with the other person who said a 3 year old shouldn&rsquo;t have a tablet, but for what it&rsquo;s worth there was an article posted in r/ScienceBasedParenting awhile back that screen <em>proximity</em> actually has no impact on vision. Apparently sitting close to the screen is far more likely a symptom of vision problems (i.e. the screen is blurry and the kid doesn&rsquo;t know how to say that) than a cause.</p>

<p>Both MJ and Dennis have been mobbed by media for close to 40 years or more. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a jab to acknowledge that their patience/attention span for partaking in interviews like this is critically low by now. But I also think it&rsquo;s reasonable to use some clever means to keep them engaged.</p>

<p>You did read his intent &ldquo;correctly&rdquo;&hellip; it&rsquo;s just that a 7 week old is NOT a toddler. And no one who has taken care of a 7 week old baby would <em>ever</em> use them to represent an actual toddler (i.e. a child 2-4 years old) or call them a toddler.  They would just say &ldquo;like a toddler&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The fact that you also use &ldquo;toddler&rdquo; when a 7 week old is not one, also kinda says the same thing:  that you&rsquo;ve not taken care of an actual 7 week old. A 7 week old baby can barely hold they head up and just lays there literally doing nothing.</p>

Anyone who has one would immediately sniff the bullshit when he said &ldquo;trying to keep my 7 week old&rsquo;s attention.&rdquo; When you spend any substantial amount of time as a parent, you can immediately pick up on parenting cues. You can see people who have never held a baby in their life. It&rsquo;s just very visible. I would venture to far as to say anyone who has parented for a bit would never use that analogy because it&rsquo;s a dumb analogy. You don&rsquo;t &ldquo;keep the attention of your 7 week old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You’re also making stark conclusions on this guy’s parenting skills based on a single line in a basketball interview that was intended as an obvious joke - “it’s like dealing with a baby.” It was a joke.</p>

      <label for="lgo6pco" class="commentText"><p>Sure, I&rsquo;ll explain clearer. I&rsquo;m saying that it&rsquo;s exceedingly likely that as a DIRECTOR and parent of a 7 week old, he hasn&rsquo;t seen that much of his kid and hasn&rsquo;t had an active hand in parenting them. If someone said that an actor or another workaholic had a nanny raise their kid, no one bats an eye, right? Between work, travel, and the media cycle, dude is probaby never home. Please note, I never said he&rsquo;s a shit parent. I said he probably hasn&rsquo;t had an active hand in the day-to-day of his 7 week old. That shit happens, bud. You&rsquo;ve got 80 hour work week, three job moms and dads that do the exact same thing.</p>

      <label for="lgo9d1i" class="commentText"><p>But that’s completely different. The comment here that we’re both replying to is conjecturing about how this guy supposedly gives his 2 month old an iPad just like with Rodman, but he never said that at all. And it’s pretty obviously intended as a shot at his parenting, based on very incomplete information.</p>

<p>I have no idea how much this guy is at home or not, and neither do you. Just because he’s a director it doesn’t mean he doesn’t spend substantial time with his family, especially since his documentary work if you look at his filmography doesn’t necessarily involve him spending 6 months in another country. So how could you possibly know that?</p>

My opinion is my own, and it&rsquo;s certainly not that he uses his iPad on his 7 week old. That makes no sense, and I said so in another post.</p>

<p>I may not know for sure (and I said as much in my original post, which is the parent of this thread), but I made an educated guess based on watching the video, listening to his verbiage, and my own experience as a parent. As an aside, if you&rsquo;re going to talk about his documentary work, he&rsquo;s currently working on a project on the 2024 Olympics basketball team. Which is happening right now. In another country.</p>

<p>The iPad would be for the bored parent more than anything.</p>

<p>If it sounds like he has no participation, it’s not because he’s using it to babysit. It’s because if he participated he’d know he wouldn’t even need one. It’s sleep, poop, and boob at that stage.</p>

      <label for="lgo12df" class="commentText"><p>I might be on the wrong side of this but the clip didn&rsquo;t really hit me like that. I thought he was just saying that it was a tool to help some interview subjects remain engaged, which I find to be an understandable concept on both sides.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m Michael Jordan—a man who&rsquo;s been in the public eye and under the microscope for over 40 years—I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m interested in doing much of anything involving the media for any reason. And if I do agree to an interview, I&rsquo;d probably have a short leash for whoever&rsquo;s trying to get something out of me.</p>

<p>In that case, if you&rsquo;re an interviewer and you know you&rsquo;ve got a marathon interview session coming up with Michael Jordan, I&rsquo;m guessing you&rsquo;re going to try to do whatever you can to ensure he remains a willing participant, since I&rsquo;m guessing this was more a situation of MJ doing them a favor rather than the opposite.</p>

<p>As such, yeah, cigar, liquor, iPad, I say provide what needed to be provided to make things work for both parties.</p>

<p>Analogizing grown men (who this director is clearly  significantly younger than) to newborn babies and 6 year olds at church feels like a poor way to communicate this. Especially when you consider he is using their platform and achievements as the basis of his piece.</p>

<p>So I guess I would say I agree with the point/idea of what he is saying, but the way it’s being communicated comes across as disrespectful.</p>

<p>And perhaps I&rsquo;m giving him too much credit or leeway. I just know how sometimes when you&rsquo;re being interviewed or in an otherwise live &amp; recorded conversation, some things don&rsquo;t necessarily come out the way you intend. It also seemed his broader point was just to say that the use of the iPads (a topic broached by Pablo Torres) was more a matter of function rather than an arbitrary artistic decision on his own behalf.</p>

<p>I imagine keeping notable media darlings Michael Jordan and Dennis fucking Rodman engaged for an extended interview session going over moments they had already talked about 1000 times before, for 20 plus years, while looking and sounding good for film, was probably really difficult. This isn&rsquo;t a phone call, it&rsquo;s a core piece of the series and it has to be good.</p>

I think he was just saying he needed to use some tricks to hold the attention of both and in Dennis&rsquo; case, it was an iPad that did the job.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t even think he meant it in a particularly disrespectful way. Rather, those sorts of interview sessions for documentaries can be long and laborious and when you&rsquo;ve got a couple guys who&rsquo;ve seen it all from the media front and are at times extremely reluctant to partake, it probably takes some maneuvering to ensure they stay keyed in for the full session without either burning out or becoming disinterested.</p>

<p>I don’t disagree with your opinions at large but it’s weird to me how it’s consistently framed as this binary “either the kids are watched by the parents or they need a screen when the parents are tired.”</p>

<p>Why not… let them just play with blocks or some shit by themselves? I’m showing my age but I was a latchkey kid, I think helicopter parents are bad but even at age 4-5 I’d just play imagination with my Thomas the Tank toys for hours at a time. It’s weird when the choices feel like only: Parental supervision or a screen.</p>

      <label for="lgoa8n5" class="commentText"><p>Oh for sure, I&rsquo;m quite fond of nuance so I&rsquo;m with you here. Rarely is anything a matter of all or nothing in reality.</p>

<p>I think I had a relatively normal upbringing and I spent my fair share of time playing Ninja Turtles &amp; He-Man or pretending my bed was a car and I was the mechanic in charge of fixing it, but I also remember watching Reading Rainbow &amp; Sesame Street before I turned six. And The Flight of the Navigator. And cartoons. It seemed like my parents balanced things out relatively well.</p>

<p>Now, as for why some parents fall into giving their kids a screen at certain times? I&rsquo;m not a parent so it&rsquo;s probably not fair for me to answer but here I go anyway. In some cases I assumed it was just the path of least resistance. Some kids can be reliably occupied by blocks or toys for hours, others can be a bit more finnicky about it (some days they&rsquo;ll play with blocks for hours, other days for 10 minutes).</p>

<p>However, I think the draw (and simultaneously the danger) of screens is how reliable they are for parents and kids alike. It generally plops the kid in a single spot and holds their attention, maybe allowing for a parent to get some rest or take care of some chores (best case scenario) or just neglect their child altogether (worst case scenario).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve kind of seen the same thing when it comes to taking children on roadtrips/vacation. I grew up in the era when the extent of our roadtrip time occupiers were outside observation or those Tiger brand handheld video games. After those two things wore out their welcome, yeah, I bet a lot of my fellow kids in that era could become a bit bored and annoying during roadtrips.</p>

<p>But then the in-car DVD screen showed up and suddenly kids turned into quiet zombies. No more fighting between siblings, no more cries of boredom. Just movies. And of course, it&rsquo;s easy to see the inherent risks of that sort of parental decision. But I bet there&rsquo;s a lot of guilty parties out there who admit they do take solace in the peace and quiet.</p>

<p>Realistically, maybe 1% of parents would completely withhold a screen till a kid is 6. That&rsquo;s totally unrealistic. I am super strict about no screen time during the week, but hell, when you have to make dinner or get an emergency work thing, a screen is an absolutely necessary tool in small doses.</p>

<p>A 7 week old can’t even see past 12 inches - it alternates solely between sleeping and eating. In what scenario would you ever need to keep its attention, it barely reacts to outside stimulus lmao.</p>

      <label for="lgo10er" class="commentText"><p>Comparing them to children is definitely condescending, but I think his larger point is actually interesting and inoffensive.</p>

<p>He basically claims MJ and his team were at first disinterested in doing a sit down interview for the documentary; since MJ has done countless interviews in general and about that period of his life specifically, they felt he had said all there was to say already, and didn’t think it was necessary to make MJ sit through another.</p>

<p>Having him comment on highlights and respond to clips of his peers differed from the standard interview process enough that MJ (presumably) didn’t feel like he was wasting his time doing something he’d done countless times before. Personally I think it also made it more entertaining.</p>

They got approval for that with the condition that Jordan would have full control over the documentary.    Jordan didn&rsquo;t particularly want to do it and kept rejecting it until he decided to finally green light it after 20 years on (no joke) the same frickin day the Cavs had their victory parade after winning in 2016.</p>

      <label for="lgpkxm0" class="commentText"><p>It was definitely not Jordan&rsquo;s idea lol. Honestly doing a documentary about himself feels like the type of thing he hates most at this point of his life.</p>

<p>As others have said, the behind the scenes footage was approved by the Bulls and the NBA during the 1998 season. Most of it hadn&rsquo;t been used and they were basically just sitting on the footage waiting for Jordan and the other Bulls to do a full Documentary with it. ESPN and the NBA always planned on making the documentary with that footage one day, but Jordan apparently never wanted to do it. </p>

<p>The rumor that it was Jordan&rsquo;s idea likely comes from the joke that it went into Production right after the Warriors 73-9 Season. So some people speculated that Jordan approved the documentary because at the time it was possible that the 1996 Bulls season would be topped. He ended up greenlighting it right after that season ended and the Warriors lost, which while amusing, was likely a complete coincidence.  </p>

      <label for="lgnj6rt" class="commentText"><p>Yea it is. They asked Trinity about it after she scored a goal this Olympics, something like “did your dad text you” and it was super awkward. She handled it well. She said no but my mom hugged me (great answer to a bad question), but you can tell the interview got a bit weird. </p>

      <label for="lgobsef" class="commentText"><p>Does untreated mental illness make someone a great personality? Rodman is really just Draymond with the benefit of nostalgia. He doesn&rsquo;t even have one of the greatest personalities in Power Forward history. Chuck, KG, Durant, John Salley, Blake Griffin. There&rsquo;s a lot of options.</p>

It comes off as disrespectful because he’s trying to throw shade and get a headline. Wack interview in my opinion and i’d love for him to rephrase because he’s actually providing some interesting insight into what goes on behind the cameras but no one is going to read past the quote anyways.</p>
