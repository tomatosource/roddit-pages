If you mounted it the perfect distance from their face, put a video on repeat and just left it there, it would probably have a negative impact on them. But no one would ever do that, because even your laziest POS parent won&rsquo;t do it because it&rsquo;s functionally ineffective. Lazy parents give their kids an iPad because they don&rsquo;t want to parent them. You don&rsquo;t parent a 7 week old.</p>

      <label for="lgo3adb" class="commentText"><p>I concur. I&rsquo;ll even take it one step further and say it may have not even necessarily been a jab at MJ and Dennis as much as just the fact of the matter.</p>

<p>Both MJ and Dennis have been mobbed by media for close to 40 years or more. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a jab to acknowledge that their patience/attention span for partaking in interviews like this is critically low by now. But I also think it&rsquo;s reasonable to use some clever means to keep them engaged.</p>

Anyone who has one would immediately sniff the bullshit when he said &ldquo;trying to keep my 7 week old&rsquo;s attention.&rdquo; When you spend any substantial amount of time as a parent, you can immediately pick up on parenting cues. You can see people who have never held a baby in their life. It&rsquo;s just very visible. I would venture to far as to say anyone who has parented for a bit would never use that analogy because it&rsquo;s a dumb analogy. You don&rsquo;t &ldquo;keep the attention of your 7 week old.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lgo6pco" class="commentText"><p>Sure, I&rsquo;ll explain clearer. I&rsquo;m saying that it&rsquo;s exceedingly likely that as a DIRECTOR and parent of a 7 week old, he hasn&rsquo;t seen that much of his kid and hasn&rsquo;t had an active hand in parenting them. If someone said that an actor or another workaholic had a nanny raise their kid, no one bats an eye, right? Between work, travel, and the media cycle, dude is probaby never home. Please note, I never said he&rsquo;s a shit parent. I said he probably hasn&rsquo;t had an active hand in the day-to-day of his 7 week old. That shit happens, bud. You&rsquo;ve got 80 hour work week, three job moms and dads that do the exact same thing.</p>

      <label for="lgo12df" class="commentText"><p>I might be on the wrong side of this but the clip didn&rsquo;t really hit me like that. I thought he was just saying that it was a tool to help some interview subjects remain engaged, which I find to be an understandable concept on both sides.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m Michael Jordan‚Äîa man who&rsquo;s been in the public eye and under the microscope for over 40 years‚ÄîI&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m interested in doing much of anything involving the media for any reason. And if I do agree to an interview, I&rsquo;d probably have a short leash for whoever&rsquo;s trying to get something out of me.</p>

<p>In that case, if you&rsquo;re an interviewer and you know you&rsquo;ve got a marathon interview session coming up with Michael Jordan, I&rsquo;m guessing you&rsquo;re going to try to do whatever you can to ensure he remains a willing participant, since I&rsquo;m guessing this was more a situation of MJ doing them a favor rather than the opposite.</p>

<p>As such, yeah, cigar, liquor, iPad, I say provide what needed to be provided to make things work for both parties.</p>

<p>I imagine keeping notable media darlings Michael Jordan and Dennis fucking Rodman engaged for an extended interview session going over moments they had already talked about 1000 times before, for 20 plus years, while looking and sounding good for film, was probably really difficult. This isn&rsquo;t a phone call, it&rsquo;s a core piece of the series and it has to be good.</p>

<p>This sub just wants to hissy fit over nothing all the time. Yall are the babies.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt disagree with your opinions at large but it‚Äôs weird to me how it‚Äôs consistently framed as this binary ‚Äúeither the kids are watched by the parents or they need a screen when the parents are tired.‚Äù</p>

<p>Why not‚Ä¶ let them just play with blocks or some shit by themselves? I‚Äôm showing my age but I was a latchkey kid, I think helicopter parents are bad but even at age 4-5 I‚Äôd just play imagination with my Thomas the Tank toys for hours at a time. It‚Äôs weird when the choices feel like only: Parental supervision or a screen.</p>

<p>Realistically, maybe 1% of parents would completely withhold a screen till a kid is 6. That&rsquo;s totally unrealistic. I am super strict about no screen time during the week, but hell, when you have to make dinner or get an emergency work thing, a screen is an absolutely necessary tool in small doses.</p>

      <label for="lgnzmv8" class="commentText"><p>After watching the clip, I could be wrong but I&rsquo;m not sure he&rsquo;s saying he gives his seven-week-old an iPad. I think he was just saying he needed to use some tricks to hold the attention of both and in Dennis&rsquo; case, it was an iPad that did the job.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t even think he meant it in a particularly disrespectful way. Rather, those sorts of interview sessions for documentaries can be long and laborious and when you&rsquo;ve got a couple guys who&rsquo;ve seen it all from the media front and are at times extremely reluctant to partake, it probably takes some maneuvering to ensure they stay keyed in for the full session without either burning out or becoming disinterested.</p>

      <label for="lgo10er" class="commentText"><p>Comparing them to children is definitely condescending, but I think his larger point is actually interesting and inoffensive.</p>

<p>He basically claims MJ and his team were at first disinterested in doing a sit down interview for the documentary; since MJ has done countless interviews in general and about that period of his life specifically, they felt he had said all there was to say already, and didn‚Äôt think it was necessary to make MJ sit through another.</p>

<p>Having him comment on highlights and respond to clips of his peers differed from the standard interview process enough that MJ (presumably) didn‚Äôt feel like he was wasting his time doing something he‚Äôd done countless times before. Personally I think it also made it more entertaining.</p>
