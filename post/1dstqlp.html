      <p>Coming off a bronze medal at last year’s FIBA World Cup, where they stunned USA in the third-place game… Canada has their best roster ever and is widely viewed as having a golden opportunity to claim their first ever Olympic medal in basketball.</p>

<p>But the blows are coming as first the Warriors refused to allow Wiggins to play (despite allowing Steph to play for USA). And now the loss of top 10 pick, Edey, thins their frontline significantly.</p>

      <label for="lb4rymt" class="commentText"><p>From most reports it looks like Wiggins really wanted to play (become an Olympian like his mother) and the Warriors pushed heavy on him not to play.

      <label for="lb4t42e" class="commentText"><p>Yes, that is what the reports have looked like.</p>

<p>Also Edey got less than 3 minutes per game at the FIBA World Cup less than a year ago. It&rsquo;s not completely impossible that he just wants to be in an environment where he&rsquo;ll get actual playing time. Dwight Powell and Kelly Olynyk took all the minutes last time. They&rsquo;re both on the roster again, Olynyk is the captain, and they added 2 new big men to the roster (Birch and Kagenbele). Who knows how many minutes would be available for Edey?</p>

      <label for="lb4uv12" class="commentText"><p>I can&rsquo;t really buy this as an Edey decision because he said he wanted to play team Canada before getting drafted. I don&rsquo;t think you understand how big of an honour it is for these guys to play in the Olympics for their country and it&rsquo;s not certain that they&rsquo;ll have a chance later in their careers.</p>

<p>I could have seen Edey still play a significant role for us in the Olympics, our centre rotation is pretty dreadful (like Powell will get minutes) and he could have at least gotten some more international experience.</p>

<p>Memphis is ready to make him the starting C and they plan on contending. Grizzlies young stars will also not be playing so he will have a huge opportunity to build chemistry this summer so next season doesn&rsquo;t get off to an awkward start.</p>

<p>Olympics in Paris is a big deal an l doubt this was easy to pass up.</p>

<li><p>For Edey&rsquo;s development: He has made massive strides at the College level, however the NBA is a different ball game. The Grizzlies will certainly have a development plan in place for him to start working from day one. That includes getting acclimated to the NBA level, and identifying and working on deficiencies. He will not get this level of personal attention or development at the Olympics.</p></li>

<li><p>For his health: the Grizzlies just came off their most injury-ridden season in history, and lost 1.5 years of potential contention due to injury/suspension. They will 100% want to keep their new rookie starlet bubble-wrapped until next season starts. Don&rsquo;t expect him to play a whole lot of Summer League.</p></li>

<li><p>For the Grizzlies: Grizzlies are in a win-now window. They have Ja, Bane, and JJJ under contract for the next two years. Edey is projected to be the starting center, and they need him to be acclimated early to contribute to winning off the jump. This depends on both points (1) and (2).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure they discussed this at length with Edey and he sees the long-term plan and likely agrees. Although of course it will still hurt to turn down an opportunity like the Olympics.</p>

      <label for="lb51ewt" class="commentText"><p>Those are all fair points. I guess I’m just a huge proponent of the Olympics as a way to get a player attuned to the highest level of competition, especially going against the US and on a team with a real shot at gold if Wiggins also was allowed to play.</p>

<p>The injury one is extra poignant to me as we were the second most injured team after the Grizzlies but injury risk will always be part of competition and training.</p>

<p>Edey projected as the starting center would just make me want to accelerate his acclimation via Olympic competition but protecting him from injury is also valid.</p>
