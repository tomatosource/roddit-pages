</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Hi! longtime NBA fan, former collegiate volleyball player, and current local open level beach volleyball player. Here to share some context on what makes Chase so unique. I try to be as factual as I can but there is some editorializing and some foggy memory.</p>

<p>Chase Budinger was a <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/budinch01.html" target="_blank">7 year NBA veteran</a> who was an McDonalds AA and played 3 seasons for Arizona, plus one season in Spain before retiring from basketball. The NBA fanhood will remember him for being co-MVP of the McDonalds game with KD in 06, as a dunking/3pt shooting 2-guard, and his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Cu7UUP-Gt0" target="_blank">dunk contest performance</a>.</p>

<p>In HS he was also the #1 volleyball recruit in the nation. I&rsquo;m 3 years younger than him, and his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_wWjM5lAfk" target="_blank">high school highlight tape</a> was one of the first viral volleyball videos. his size is common in high level volleyball - that tape is from a high school team, not a travel/club team. but his fluidity and ball control combined with his size and hops made him a clear national team prospect. For high level indoor volleyball, we&rsquo;re talking 6&rsquo;4&rdquo;-7&rsquo; and touches at least 11&rsquo; at every position, with the exception of libero who only plays defense.</p>

<p>Obviously he made the financially responsible decision and pursued basketball in college and made over <span class="math inline">\(18 million in his NBA career. Top level indoor volleyball pros in Russia, Germany, France, Poland, and Italy can make hundreds of thousands per season with the best of the best occasionally cracking \)</span>1mil/season contracts.</p>

<p>If Chase had pursued volleyball, he absolutely would have been able to reach the top level and maybe could be starting on our indoor team with Matt Anderson as the old heads. But there is no way that he could have done the NBA thing and attained the skill to play at the highest level indoors.</p>

<p>When Chase went to play beach volleyball in 2018 he was picked up by Sean Rosenthal (olympian in 08 and 12), and Rosenthal was a mentor &amp; networker for Chase. His next partner was Casey Patterson (16 Olympian), so there was this trend of veterans whose careers were winding down playing with Chase to help catch him up to speed and guide him.</p>

<p>Chase then played with Troy Field, who is a fun, explosive, fan-favorite, and they were the most physical team on the AVP, but Troy didn&rsquo;t improve over his time with Chase and was just generally more immature. During this time, Chase went from being a low-tier blocker with high upside to being comfortably one of the top few blockers in the US. Problem is the elite players are pretty clique-y (and imo, unprofessional) and have all known each other from youth ball in CA and HI, so they kind of squeezed him out. He picked up Miles Evans in 2022, who was mid-career, solid, middle of the pack, AVP defender, and they committed to making the run to Paris. Even right now, I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d say Evans is a top 3 US defender (Partain, the Crabb brothers, maybe even Hagen Smith?), but Evans has improved to the point where it&rsquo;s a conversation.</p>

<p>They were like 7th in the US ranking for Olympic qualification in 2022, and absolutely grinded. Miles, over the past year or so, has played the best volleyball of his career, and Chase brought more structure and planning (in addition to his skills + physical gifts) than most BVB teams have. It&rsquo;s basically a semi-pro sport, the top players survive on sponsorships not winnings, and the low-tier pros have day jobs. So Chase&rsquo;s NBA $ and professionalism helped them make up ground and going into the LAST qualification tournament for the Olympic cycle they outperformed their US competition by one round to clinch the 2nd Team USA slot.</p>

<p>Chase and Miles are NOT medal contenders, but its awesome and crazy that they qualified. in the Road Trippin podcast they mentioned they played 11 tournaments in 14 weekends, all in different countries. Nobody else in the world did that, and thats part of how they qualified (plus they had to play well!).</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s some clips of basketball players playing volleyball, just so you have a sense of how well the athleticism alone transfers: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ui5N0Cctlc8" target="_blank">beginner</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cf_xM03EIqA&amp;t=17s" target="_blank">Early BVB Chase w/richard jefferson + Luke Walton vs AVP Pros</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yGSuoNPEIo" target="_blank">Steph and Embiid peppering at an all-start game</a>. Jermain O&rsquo;Neal&rsquo;s daughter was (is?) a D1 player, Steph&rsquo;s mom and sisters were d1 volleyball players, and i think thats a pretty common thing in NBA families.</p>

<p>If you want to hear more from Chase and Miles own mouths, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C96yuZU9G4Q" target="_blank">Road Trippin ft Chase and Miles</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioD4xFl8A6I&amp;t=2612s" target="_blank">Sandcast Podcast</a> (low-tier AVP guy turned VB journalist + very good AVP player).</p>

      <label for="lg0j1q1" class="commentText"><p>indoor question&ndash;i, and like a few other redditors seemingly always commenting on the Budinger threads (must be a bunch of us mid-2000s socal/san diego county heads on reddit) played against him in high school. was/is TJ DeFalco a better prospect than Chase was at his high school peak?</p>

<p>another anecdote: I remember our high school team hanging with their La Costa Canyon high school team for the first set then they stopped playing around and turned on a switch. then Budinger just started hitting back row like it was nothing (nothing we ever seen during the high school boys volleyball circuit those days). and to add all that on top of the basketball accomplishments. dude has to be the best athlete to come out of San Diego aside from Bill Walton</p>

      <label for="lg0nhwl" class="commentText"><p>My guess would be yes? Chase is several inches taller with a better vertical. Now if you asked me if TJ was a better player at the u18s level than Chase was&hellip; i have no idea.</p>

<p>Chase was Volleyball Mag&rsquo;s #1 on their Fab 50 list when I was a freshman in HS. He was drafted into the NBA my senior year, so everyone was talking about him throughout my college years.</p>

<p>TJ is 6 years younger than me and i can only find that he was a &ldquo;consensus top 2 recuit&rdquo; with Tuaniga: <a href="https://www.presstelegram.com/2016/01/10/long-beach-state-mens-volleyball-enters-year-with-title-hopes/" target="_blank">https://www.presstelegram.com/2016/01/10/long-beach-state-mens-volleyball-enters-year-with-title-hopes/</a></p>

<p>A rumor I heard is that bc Chase was on the youth national team and then bailed on volleyball, the USAV pipeline started having players sign some type of contract with a multi-year commitment.</p>

      <label for="lg1dggz" class="commentText"><p>Speaking as someone that played California high school volleyball against TJ, but was not conscious for the Chase discourse, I would imagine that Chase was probably a better prospect in terms of physical tools, but TJ was the better U18 player. TJ was definitely the top recruit in the country (just google &ldquo;TJ DeFalco top recruit&rdquo; and there are a few articles about it), and he was an alternate for the Rio 2016 Olympic squad as an 18 year old. His high school team won <em>undefeated</em> back to back national championships his junior and senior year. Again, never watched Chase in person and wasn&rsquo;t around for the discourse, but I would be very surprised if he was more impactful on the court than TJ was. More athletic? Definitely.</p>

<p>I can assure you in saying that while the way the games are played is virtually night and day from the time period they both played, Chase was a better prospect.</p>

<p>Had chase been trained and competed in the same manner and systems that TJ learned and thrived in, we might be having a conversation if he was the best domestic indoor player ever, and at the very least on the same exact level as Matt Anderson.</p>

<p>TJ is great, but chase was on another level. Not to mention he had ball control and was doing everything else with the old ball.</p>

      <label for="lg0pki6" class="commentText"><p>Problem is the US Men have only been good since the 00s because of our blockers (Dalhausser is a GOAT contender and Jake Gibb was incredible for over a decade). our defenders have done enough to get carried to medals.</p>

<p>Id say Chase is middle of the pack as a blocker in the Olympics. a few guys definitively better, a few definitively worse.</p>

<p>our #1s, Partain and Benesh had a great 2023, winning a few tournaments including beating Norway (arguably best duo ever) twice in one event. But they&rsquo;ve had a bad 2024 and an awful start to the Olympic.</p>

<p>Partain is considered the best US defender by a pretty solid margin because of his &ldquo;Swedish&rdquo; style of play, which Chase and Miles try to do but aren&rsquo;t able to execute as consistently. Benesh is a better blocker than Chase but not as good a setter/server/hitter. So&hellip; Chase + Partain would be dark horse medal contenders? but not favorites.</p>

<p>If you didn&rsquo;t have to do national pairs, i&rsquo;d love to see Adrian Carambula from Italy #2 with Chase. Adrian is a wizard and fiery, and Chase would be the best partner Adrian&rsquo;s ever played with. For Chase it would give him a wildcard partner that could add some crazy to the gameplay. It probably wouldn&rsquo;t work though, bc Chase is so controlled.</p>

      <label for="lg1lvtx" class="commentText"><p>traditionally beach doubles is played in the middle third of the court, high pass, high set, with the blocker normally protecting the line and the defender in the crosscourt angle. other offensive technicques are hitting the option (instead of setting the 2nd ball to your partner you attack it), running the hitting route behind the setter, running the hitting route to the outside pin.</p>

<p>Motion offense (the latter two) have been used historically by small, crafty players who cant win the physicality battle in the middle of the court but can scramble the defense either by surprise or being quicker than the blocker.</p>

<p>Option offense depends on the passer putting up a ball that is high and tight so it is hittable, but not so tight that it is an overpass or impossible to set.</p>

<p>The Swedish duo are in their early 20s and have skyrocketed to #1 in the world by basing their entire offense around these concepts, not as wrinkles or tricks, but as the bedrock of what they do. basically everyone else in the world is playing catchup, trying to add more misdirection, options, and tempo to their offense, stretching the court more.</p>

      <label for="lg1bz0d" class="commentText"><p>Not to be a hater, but saying &ldquo;he would probably be starting on the USMNT&rdquo; is a pure guess. Yes, he was the top recruit in the class, but only one #1 recruit has made the USMNT in the last decade. I just don&rsquo;t want how impossibly difficult it is to make the indoor national team to be trivialized. It&rsquo;s very possible he would have, but it was not even close to being a guarantee</p>

      <label for="lg24vib" class="commentText"><p>Yeah and I didn&rsquo;t mean my comment in a mean way, I just see a lot of people not in volleyball circles who are flippant about how difficult volleyball is and assume that any reasonably big and athletic person from the NBA would be a GOAT-level volleyball player. If Chase locked in on volleyball, yeah he would have a good chance to be on the USMNT, but we also see that a ton in every sport, someone like Andrew Wiggins or KAT come along and you&rsquo;re just sitting back like &ldquo;Wow this guy has every tool to be a hall of famer&rdquo; and they end up being good at the next level, but never quite as good as you thought</p>

      <label for="lg27sgc" class="commentText"><p>Totally. Part of the reason I wrote this up was to show that chase didn&rsquo;t become an Olympian just because he was an NBA athlete, but because he was really fucking good at volleyball, and nba athlete, and then worked really fucking hard.</p>

      <label for="lg1qbt2" class="commentText"><p>He was unlikely this cycle! Thats why it&rsquo;s so cool he and miles made it.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s 36 now and will be 40 in LA &lsquo;28. It&rsquo;s not unheard of to be 40 and kicking ass in bvb. But will he have the fire to travel around the world to qualify? Will he be able to pick up a younger, better partner to offset some of his inevitable physical decline?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like there are clear heir-apparents waiting in the wing. Our mens scene is pretty mediocre right now.</p>

<p>other beach only players might be Anders Mol of Norway (current best player in the world, and has been for 8ish years?), Phil Dalhausser of the USA (kinda like Shaq where he just didn&rsquo;t care enough to be the GOAT), and maybe Alison from Brazil?</p>

<p>but I&rsquo;m not the best person to ask this. I&rsquo;ve been following BVB for about a decade and there aren&rsquo;t many resources on the internet for research.</p>
