</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Hi! longtime NBA fan, former collegiate volleyball player, and current local open level beach volleyball player. Here to share some context on what makes Chase so unique. I try to be as factual as I can but there is some editorializing and some foggy memory.</p>

<p>Chase Budinger was a <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/budinch01.html" target="_blank">7 year NBA veteran</a> who was an McDonalds AA and played 3 seasons for Arizona, plus one season in Spain before retiring from basketball. The NBA fanhood will remember him for being co-MVP of the McDonalds game with KD in 06, as a dunking/3pt shooting 2-guard, and his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Cu7UUP-Gt0" target="_blank">dunk contest performance</a>.</p>

<p>In HS he was also the #1 volleyball recruit in the nation. I&rsquo;m 3 years younger than him, and his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_wWjM5lAfk" target="_blank">high school highlight tape</a> was one of the first viral volleyball videos. his size is common in high level volleyball - that tape is from a high school team, not a travel/club team. but his fluidity and ball control combined with his size and hops made him a clear national team prospect. For high level indoor volleyball, we&rsquo;re talking 6&rsquo;4&rdquo;-7&rsquo; and touches at least 11&rsquo; at every position, with the exception of libero who only plays defense.</p>

<p>Obviously he made the financially responsible decision and pursued basketball in college and made over <span class="math inline">\(18 million in his NBA career. Top level indoor volleyball pros in Russia, Germany, France, Poland, and Italy can make hundreds of thousands per season with the best of the best occasionally cracking \)</span>1mil/season contracts.</p>

<p>If Chase had pursued volleyball, he absolutely would have been able to reach the top level and would probably be starting on our indoor team with Matt Anderson as the old heads. But there is no way that he could have done the NBA thing and attained the skill to play at the highest level indoors.</p>

<p>When Chase went to play beach volleyball in 2018 he was picked up by Sean Rosenthal (olympian in 08 and 12), and Rosenthal was a mentor &amp; networker for Chase. His next partner was Casey Patterson (16 Olympian), so there was this trend of veterans whose careers were winding down playing with Chase to help catch him up to speed and guide him.</p>

<p>Chase then played with Troy Field, who is a fun, explosive, fan-favorite, and they were the most physical team on the AVP, but Troy didn&rsquo;t improve over his time with Chase and was just generally more immature. During this time, Chase went from being a low-tier blocker with high upside to being comfortably one of the top few blockers in the US. Problem is the elite players are pretty clique-y (and imo, unprofessional) and have all known each other from youth ball in CA and HI, so they kind of squeezed him out. He picked up Miles Evans in 2022, who was mid-career, solid, middle of the pack, AVP defender, and they committed to making the run to Paris. Even right now, I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d say Evans is a top 3 US defender (Partain, the Crabb brothers, maybe even Hagen Smith?), but Evans has improved to the point where it&rsquo;s a conversation.</p>

<p>They were like 7th in the US ranking for Olympic qualification in 2022, and absolutely grinded. Miles, over the past year or so, has played the best volleyball of his career, and Chase brought more structure and planning (in addition to his skills + physical gifts) than most BVB teams have. It&rsquo;s basically a semi-pro sport, the top players survive on sponsorships not winnings, and the low-tier pros have day jobs. So Chase&rsquo;s NBA $ and professionalism helped them make up ground and going into the LAST qualification tournament for the Olympic cycle they outperformed their US competition by one round to clinch the 2nd Team USA slot.</p>

<p>Chase and Miles are NOT medal contenders, but its awesome and crazy that they qualified. in the Road Trippin podcast they mentioned they played 11 tournaments in 14 weekends, all in different countries. Nobody else in the world did that, and thats part of how they qualified (plus they had to play well!).</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s some clips of basketball players playing volleyball, just so you have a sense of how well the athleticism alone transfers: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ui5N0Cctlc8" target="_blank">beginner</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cf_xM03EIqA&amp;t=17s" target="_blank">Early BVB Chase w/richard jefferson + Luke Walton vs AVP Pros</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yGSuoNPEIo" target="_blank">Steph and Embiid peppering at an all-start game</a>. Jermain O&rsquo;Neal&rsquo;s daughter was (is?) a D1 player, Steph&rsquo;s mom and sisters were d1 volleyball players, and i think thats a pretty common thing in NBA families.</p>

<p>If you want to hear more from Chase and Miles own mouths, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C96yuZU9G4Q" target="_blank">Road Trippin ft Chase and Miles</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioD4xFl8A6I&amp;t=2612s" target="_blank">Sandcast Podcast</a> (low-tier AVP guy turned VB journalist + very good AVP player).</p>
