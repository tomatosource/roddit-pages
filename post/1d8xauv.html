Didn&rsquo;t feel like much development was happening despite all the young talent on the team with the exception of Sengun. They looked better as the season progressed, and are in a good position with the draft this year so there is room for growth.</p>

<p>Jabari Smith wants to improve, which is the first step. At his age he will improve his craft plus he has another year of experience that he can refer to as well.</p>

<p>The Western Conference is fucking insane.</p>

<p>Though, it&rsquo;s practically unheard of that a player becomes a good handler while possessing such limited ball handling to begin with.</p>

<p>But if he becomes a 20ppg/7rpg forward with good FG% and passable defense, that&rsquo;s a strong contributor to a championship contender like Lewis was or MPJ currently is.</p>

Those are attributes that are typically considered highly transferable and fitting for any system. For that reason, he was touted as a safe, high floor, immediate impact player. Look through the history of the NBA&hellip;no one who is considered raw or a project gets mocked as the consensus #1 pick leading up to draft night. You get mocked #1 because you&rsquo;re expected to change a franchise&rsquo;s trajectory immediately.</p>

      <label for="l7btjpe" class="commentText"><p>Sorry, should&rsquo;ve phrased that better. He wasn&rsquo;t a raw player in the sense of being a long-term project— the defense and shooting were already NBA-ready, which is why he was such a highly touted prospect, but he was specifically pretty raw as a <em>shot creator,</em> in the sense that he has the physical tools and shooting ability to be able to create his own shot at a high level, but not the requisite ball skills. The way I remember it, he was seen as a guy who could be a very productive role player basically from day one, but who also had star-level upside that would probably take longer to develop. From that perspective, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s been a disappointment at all— his rookie season was a little rocky, but overall the stuff we thought would translate right away has translated, and the stuff that wasn&rsquo;t there yet still isn&rsquo;t there yet (but it&rsquo;s still too early to tell whether or not it&rsquo;ll come along).</p>

      <label for="l79ria7" class="commentText"><p>He honestly was overall a better player than Jalen Green. He looked like the 2nd best player on the team behind Sengun for most of the year. If Jabari keeps improving and Jalen finally transcends into superstar status like we saw at the end of the season the Rockets would be the next OKC but with an even more well rounder core. Im excited *cross my fingers</p>

      <label for="l7bu5t5" class="commentText"><p>Think it&rsquo;s easy to look that way cause Sengun + FVV have the offense and stats. FVV is also a POA defender, but so much of the glue of what HOU is able to do is off the back of Bari&rsquo;s (+ Tari, but was out this year, + Amen in the future) ability to switch onto anyone defensively.</p>

<p>Bari gets overlooked to the other young guys, but HOU won games last year because they had a top 10 defense, and a lot of that came from Bari. Not going to argue truly top 2, but just saying his impact should not be slept on and I won&rsquo;t argue against people who do put him up there.</p>

<p>Still, not all rookies develop the same. As someone who watched Jaylen and Jayson from the start, Jayson was ready to go out of the box but Jaylen took a lot of time to develop. Not saying Jabari is Jaylen but I liked what I saw of him his rookie year and believe he’ll pan out into a very good player. On the other hand, I’ve been super low on Jalen Green. I’m very curious what his future holds after his end of season pop.</p>

<p>For athletes, it’s never good enough. It’s nearly everyone in here misinterpreting this. There is always pressure, there is always the feeling that you need to continue to develop your strengths and train your weaknesses, add to your game.</p>

<p>Athletes also hide their weakness well, which is probably why you don’t hear anyone sounding this vulnerable. It’s not sad, it’s the reality of high level sports and the NBA is the best league on the planet in any sport.</p>

Jabari&rsquo;s fine.  He improved tremendously from year 1 to year 2.  Seems like not going #1 overall after all the rumors that Orlando would take him still weighs him down a bit.</p>

He doesn’t profile to be a lead ball handler or a guy who creates offense which Paolo already does at a high level and Chet has such a unique and valuable skill set at his position. Im not trying to Shit on Jabari or indicate he’s bad but I think it’s. A little disingenuous to say he could easily catch up to them, it’s gonna be very hard at this point unless Chet and Paolo seriously fall off or Jabari starts to develop at a crazy rate.</p>

      <label for="l7b23pg" class="commentText"><p>Yeah anything can happen, but I’ve seen a decent amount  of Jabari and it’s pretty apparent he has a specific role atm on a decent team, I think the rockets see that as well. I think if there was a confidence and belief within the rockets that he can be/develop into a lead ball handler type they would give him more reps at it. As of now he’s behind Sengun, Thompson, green, and FVV on that list. I feel like it’s clear Jabari likely won’t develop into a guy who really creates his own offense or for others. There seems to be a pretty clear role that Jabari could be good at and I think it’s fine for him. Obviously he’s young but based on what we’ve seen I don’t think he has a good chance at necessarily becoming what Chet and Paolo are.</p>

Look at Brunson, or Jokic even. Plenty of big time players breakout 3rd-4th season.</p>

<p>If he had never shown his potential or was older or had three seasons instead of two then I would say he&rsquo;s as destined to be a co-star as you think he is but if he were gonna break out it&rsquo;s next year that it would happen.</p>

      <label for="l7b1e5z" class="commentText"><p>I’m sorry man, but Jabari isn’t a creator offensively and that will always limit him. Unless he becomes quite literally a completely different player I just  don’t see it happening. Jokic and Brunson are both guys who can be the lead guys for an offense where Jabari can’t really even with bench units.</p>

<p>Like I said he’s a really good player, but he projects heavily as a good 3&amp;d player who can attack close outs. He doesn’t seem privy to creating offense for himself or others. Like for him to just randomly develop that now would be one of the biggest developments in modern nba  history.</p>

Now he’s got a chip on his shoulder which is great, but even if he can’t live up to it he’s still an excellent talent and someone I would’ve been happy to have on Orlando, just not a Paolo.</p>

<p>It’s a tough spot to be in as a young 20 year old, and I think he’s handled it really well. I hope he has a great career.</p>

      <label for="l7a2gwo" class="commentText"><p>Jabari hasn&rsquo;t played his age 21 season yet.  In fact Smith&rsquo;s stats in his second season (age 20 season) are pretty comparable to Tatum&rsquo;s stats in Tatum&rsquo;s second season (age 20 season).  Tatum had a couple more PPG at lower efficiency, the rest is basically a wash in totality.</p>

<p>That said, Tatum had a huge year 3 leap.  I don&rsquo;t expect that from Jabari.  16-17 ppg on 60% TS (or close) would be great for him.</p>

      <label for="l7ah5lq" class="commentText"><p>The big thing about JT&rsquo;s year two stats being similar and then the leap in year 3 was team construction. Year two we had a logjam of players needing the ball. Year 3 was the moment our front office shifted towards building around the Jays vs. contending now with Kyrie. So I&rsquo;d say the stats comparison lies a little bit. Jabari will almost certainly take a bit longer to blossom than Tatum&hellip; <em>and that&rsquo;s ok.</em> Guys don&rsquo;t usually develop as quickly as Tatum and Jabari was a lot more raw coming into the league. If he starts making all star teams on his second contract the pick is a success.</p>

His age 19 and 20 years had him off ball as a 4th option taking 11.8 shots a game on 46-40-84 splits for 2 years until Kyrie, Morris and Horford split.</p>

<p>He and Jaylen weren’t seen as disappointments or asked to do anything more than they did, on those teams.</p>

Defensively he’s one of our best options who can guard multiple positions, and his three-point shooting has been a lot better in comparison to the first year. He still has much more to work on and grow into which is why I get some of the self-criticism but he shouldn’t be so hard on himself lol</p>

Everyone thought this guy would be top pick and it didn’t happen so I feel like ppl were expecting him to have superstar upside which may still be true, but right now he looks like he can become a really solid NBA wing which due to prior expectations is considered “disappointing”.</p>

      <label for="l79dv9p" class="commentText"><p>yeah i dont think he&rsquo;s really been a disappointment &ndash; it was clear during the draft that his most likely outcome was a SUPER high end role player. A 6&rsquo;10&rdquo; versatile defender and knock down shooter is a player that literally every team in the NBA could use.</p>

<p>He should absolutely working to be improving his overall game, but he already has shown flashes of elite defense and shooting &ndash; if he can be consistently elite in those two areas, he should really lean into that. But it&rsquo;s great that he wants to improve.</p>

A stretch big that put up 13 points and 8 rebounds a game on good effeciency as the fourth option who&rsquo;s also a good defender? Hell yeah. It&rsquo;s not his fault he&rsquo;s playing behind guys like Şengün, Nov/Dec/March Green and former All-Star VanVleet. I&rsquo;d be nice if he broke out in a huge way but he&rsquo;s far from a disappointment in my eyes. </p>

      <label for="l7b13cs" class="commentText"><p>Jabari&rsquo;s had moments of absolute brilliance. Not sure he&rsquo;ll ever reach any kind of star level but he&rsquo;s going to be a really good piece to a really good team in the future. Just needs a little more time to figure out the NBA and hone his game.</p>

      <label for="l7bcog8" class="commentText"><p>Rooting for Jabari now. Hoping it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;I want to get better and reach my potential&rdquo; situation, and not a &ldquo;oh shit oh shit oh shit I&rsquo;m a fraud&rdquo; situation. As someone with extensive experience of the latter mindset, it&rsquo;s no fun, and I don&rsquo;t have that many people watching me every day.</p>

He’s a not supposed to be a #1 guy, he’s supposed to be a really good #3, #4 guy who’s knocks down 3s, gets some boards, and play good defense. All of which, he’s done serviceably so far.</p>
