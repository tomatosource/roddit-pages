</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>No other rivalry actually comes close to matching Magic vs Bird imo.</p>

<p>It was a rivalry that was truly competitive and yet extremely cordial and respectful.</p>

<p>And it warms the cockles of everyone&rsquo;s hearts when they wore each other&rsquo;s jersey/numbers.</p>

<p>I cannot be wrong.</p>

      <label for="l9wx6tn" class="commentText"><p>The greatness to their rivalry has everything to do with them being college rivals before they were NBA rivals AND THEN going to franchises that were already league rivals AND THEN having both those teams actually be close to dominant in their conferences for a decade.</p>

<p>That shit has not happened since, for various factors. The Bulls were so dominant it was hard to have rivals. Same with Lakers 00-03.</p>

<p>The closest we’ve come is basically to get about 5 years of Steph/GSW-Bron rivalry.</p>

<p>It could happen again though, especially among the recent young guys. Maybe Shai-Ant will become some sort of classic rivalry. Or Shai-Ja. It just seems harder because of the dilution of talent at the college and NBA level. There are 7 more NBA teams since the majority of the Bird/Magic years.</p>

      <label for="l9x666r" class="commentText"><p>I was younger than 10 for most of their rivalry and living in a place without an NBA team, so I didn’t observe any of that myself, so it’s hard for me to understand what that was actually like for viewers/fans themselves. It’s especially hard for me to understand why white people felt they needed a “great white hope” like Larry. That’s absolutely racist-ass shit that I have never, never understood or been a part of, and I never will be.</p>

<p>I know it’s been written about, but I think it’s hard to talk about it if you couldn’t actually see/encounter it in the culture.</p>

<p>And of course the whole glamour vs lunchpail thing and even East vs West coast thing is kinda weird, since both guys were working glass midwesterners.</p>

<p>For white people, when they are usually into a “great white hype” it is absolutely about “We used to dominate this sport, but now we have all these minorities in it and I can’t relate to it unless there’s a white super star in it.”</p>

<p>That’s the thing I’ll never understand. But I grew up in a time when 3 of the major sports were fairly integrated already, so it didn’t seem like a thing to me. I also didn’t have <em>too many</em> racist relatives trying to tell me about the good old days. The ones who did, I just ignored.</p>

      <label for="l9xlm55" class="commentText"><p>Also the NBA absolutely needed something to improve its reputation back then. Obviously to have a good rivalry, you need two great players and a few other ingredients but the impact it&rsquo;ll have totally depends on the needs of the whole medias and organization.</p>

<p>After Bird-Magic, Jordan was above everyone and the main and biggest meatic image of the league. But the current NBA doesn&rsquo;t really need a had-to-head rivalry, maybe between two teams but not between two players because I feel like the main focus of the league right now is to make sure each franchise has at least one charismatic star.</p>

<p>The Celtics and Lakers were pretty even with regards to supporting casts, on the whole. The ‘84-‘87 Celtics in particular had one of the deepest and best casts ever.</p>

<p>The Warriors on the other hand had a pretty huge edge in supporting casts in at least 3 of the 4 series (‘16 wasn’t huge, only because so many of the Dubs players were injured or dog-tired from chasing 73…but that’s the only year there wasn’t a gargantuan discrepancy by the time the finals rolled around).</p>

      <label for="l9xkinr" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I’ve always thought that Magic had the better team but Bird was the better player. Was the case in college and the pros. Parish and McHale were great, but they weren’t Kareem and Worthy.</p>

<p>The main thing Magic has on Bird is that his peak lasted a little bit longer since Larry’s back was kind of cooked after the 87 Finals. But Larry was also much better when they first came into the league so IMO it evens out.</p>

<p>Peak for Peak though, Bird had one of the greatest peaks ever in those four seasons from 84-87 winning 3 straight MVPs, 2 Finals MVPs, and making the Finals all four years. He’s in the conversation with LeBron and MJ for GOAT peak.</p>

<p>Magic’s peak arguably came when the Lakers were on their decline. He was only inarguably the best player on the team for their last two titles. That’s not a diss on Magic though, we’re comparing two top 5-10 players ever. I also think he might have gotten another one if not for HIV but we’ll never know.</p>

<p>  Bron cruised the reg season then amped it up in the post season . 2015 he scored 10ppg more, 2016 it was close to 8ppg, 2017 it was 7.</p>

      <label for="l9xc3zt" class="commentText"><p>Absolutely agree with you that Bron was better than Curry, but it&rsquo;s not because Bron was an offensive engine and Curry wasn&rsquo;t. Curry has always been an offensive engine; the team offence numbers, ts% of teammates, open looks generated etc. when Curry is on/off are all absolutely all-time elite.</p>

<p>Curry&rsquo;s offensive impact on his team is colossal, in addition to his own individual hyper-efficient volume scoring.</p>

<p>LeBron is just overall a better/more impactful player.</p>

<p>But yeah obviously the big issue is them nor playing each other in big games.</p>

<p>Maybe we get an IST finals between the 76ers and Nuggets in the next couple of years.</p>

<p>That would be good.</p>

<p>But yeah its an issue to create rivalries like Brids and Magic when you dont have  dynasties duking it out every year and the medias advertisment being what it is.</p>

<p>There are plenty of guys who have faced off in the playoffs multiple times in recent years. Any of those are more legitimate than Jokic and Embiid.</p>

<p>The Celtics and Heat have played 4 playoff series in 5 years, surely Butler vs Tatum is a better rivalry than Embiid vs a guy he&rsquo;s never played a playoff game against.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d argue Embiid vs Tatum is more real than Embiid vs Jokic too.</p>

<p>Bird and Magic played against each other in the NCAA finals (most watched BASKETBALL game of all time), got drafted to the two greatest franchises with an already huge rivalry, were in different conferences so they could meet in the finals, AND had the good fortune of the remaining teams at their peak being relatively weak so they could keep running into each other after beating everyone else.</p>

<p>Embiid hasn&rsquo;t made it out of the 2nd round, even Jokic has only made one finals so far and will be 30 soon.</p>

<p>Luka and Booker can&rsquo;t meet in the finals, not to mention that the gap between them as players is too big.</p>

<p>Only LeBron vs Curry came close and even that had the caveat of LeBron just clearly being the better player.</p>

<p>It may seem hard to believe given they were in the league at the same time for a while, but the primes of Kobe and LeBron never actually coincided. By the time LeBron hit his true peak in Miami, Kobe was already on the downside of his career.</p>

      <label for="l9ww770" class="commentText"><p>Has nothing to do with marketing. That shit was organic and started in the 78-79 NCAA season. This is literally about the men, and not the nascent marketing departments of the pre-Stern/Stern NBA.</p>

<p>Because if you think the marketing sucks now, realize that they’re trying based on current market research and actual engagement statistics. In the 80s I guarantee you they had no idea what they were doing and were just throwing shit at the wall to see what actually worked.</p>

<p>With the Finals on what do they discuss?</p>

<p>Why LeBron James unfollowed Perkins.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t tell me this is good marketing, how many past finals have we heard about Bron/Lakers even though they aren&rsquo;t in there? They just don&rsquo;t know how to market anybody who isn&rsquo;t LeBron.</p>

      <label for="l9x3957" class="commentText"><p>I personally do not believe that the NBA is telling ESPN to focus on the dumbass narratives that ESPN focuses on.</p>

<p>I think the league probably <em>does not</em> want that. Because they also see how much it pisses people off.</p>

<p>I do believe that John Skipper and James Pitaro are/have been absolute idiots when it comes to building up sports. They just chase after cheap ratings.</p>

<p>The fact that the Pat McAfee show exists is proof of that to me. No league wants their broadcast partners to have a show where the host is willing to entertain totally speculative and serious criminal allegations that turn out to not be true. They dragged Alan Williams name through the mud.</p>

      <label for="l9x5p5e" class="commentText"><p>I view them as an extension of NBA marketing. I understand it would be hard for the NBA to constantly run ads so those &ldquo;talk/debate&rdquo; shows serve as soft marketing. So them not telling ESPN to focus on the Finals is to me a failure in marketing.</p>

      <label for="l9x8m3k" class="commentText"><p>I can see that. But I also I don’t think it’s that simple. ESPN is looking at various things besides hyping the Finals.</p>

<p>For example, the guy running ESPN (Pitaro) and the guy running ABC (Erwich) are not the same guy.</p>

<p>Even they could have differences of opinion on what ESPN was doing. Erwich oversaw the platforms where the Finals were broadcast, responsible for viewership on those platforms. Pitaro would be partially responsible for the ratings of the Finals, but also entirely for ESPN.</p>

<p>Erwich could’ve said “You’ve got to hype the finals more” and Pitaro could’ve said “Listen, the numbers for the finals will be there, but I have to care about getting people to watch a daily basketball show from Noon to 1PM when there’s only 1 basketball game played once every 2-3 days. There’s only so much we can talk about the Finals.”</p>

<p>So, if there’s a chance that even a guy in the same company <em>might not</em> be able to convince Pitaro to switch up ESPN’s, I feel that  there’s even less of a chance the NBA would have to change his mind. After all, ESPN was already part of the next contract.</p>

<p>Again, that’s how I view it, and I could be totally wrong.</p>

Heck, the reason the two became real friends was because Magic travelled to French Lick to film a shoe commercial with Larry.

      <label for="l9x6lp0" class="commentText"><p>Yes, but that was <em>shoe</em> marketing, not NBA marketing. The commenter above was saying “NBA marketing sucks.”</p>

<p>And certainly with them both being on the same shoe company roster, <em>that</em> company has an interest in promoting a friendly rivalry between the two, because it sells more shoes.</p>

<p>I also contend that actual product companies probably understood sales and marketing better than the mid-80s NBA did.</p>

      <label for="l9xhtaq" class="commentText"><p>Literally the money the league spends on marketing. The NBA 75 stuff. The champagne ad from the playoffs. The “Playoff ___ is not a thing” ad. They partner with the teams and Nike’s uniform division as well for marketing around the special jerseys.</p>

<p>What Converse did in the 80s had absolutely nothing to do with the league and you can tell, because they didn’t use their actual jerseys.</p>

<p>Anything that uses team logos is NBA endorsed. Anything that does not, is not NBA marketing. (Sports drink commercials, etc).</p>

But if they were rivals, it just would’ve actually been talked about. Like Kobe destroyed Duncan in 2008 and if they were rivals that would’ve been a huge slight to Duncan but it really wasn’t. If Bird or Magic wrecked the other like that we’d never hear the end of it</p>

      <label for="l9x7zir" class="commentText"><p>They werent really rivals, like other than being two of the marquee players of their generation the honor of rival probably goes to Shaq with Timmy since they were both bigs and it was a classic style vs substance.  Their peaks matched up better from late 90s to mid 2000s</p>

      <label for="l9x3gkx" class="commentText"><p>Russell vs Chamberlain was just as good, but most of the people on this site are just too young to have seen those games. I am over 70 and was fortunate enough to watch. Sadly no games were preserve and you only see snippets on YouTube. Chamberlain vs Russell was epic. In the late 60&rsquo;s  and early 70&rsquo;s, Walt Frazer vs Earl Monroe had classic matchups and they are both in the HOF. Bird vs Magic ranks right up there, but to say one was #1, the is a very difficult statement to make. I have been watching since 1965. Oscar Robertson vs Jerry West was a great rivalry but not in the playoffs.  Back in the day with less teams they met more frequently during the regular season.</p>

      <label for="l9x64rg" class="commentText"><p>I think it’s safe to say if Bird and Magic aren’t #1, it’s definitely Bill and Wilt. After that there’s a few contenders (Isiah and MJ, Steph and Lebron, Oscar and Jerry, Reggie vs the Knicks) and a couple that just needed more years of overlap between the player’s careers (like Kareem vs Wilt or a healthy Walton) but it’s hard to put any of them at the same level as those top 2.</p>

      <label for="l9xasj3" class="commentText"><p>Shaq vs Duncan should be the obvious one. No hype ever materialized behind Duncan but there&rsquo;s two guys that are near each other on all time great lists, who guarded each other, and whose peaks overlapped. Wild that there isn&rsquo;t more about them two.</p>

<p>Besides that, the big rivalry narratives the NBA got behind became group categories; 90s centers and early 2000&rsquo;s power Forwards.</p>

      <label for="l9x72hc" class="commentText"><p>I would go further and say the only rivalry in sport that compares is Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Both have had titanic battles that will never be forgotten. Both have contrasting styles, and yet they took turns dominating for close to 15 years. Both love each other in the most wholesome manner. And as much their individual rivalries with Djokovic is right up there, in the public conciousness at large, Roger vs Rafa is the pinnacle. Rafa cried when Roger retired, and I&rsquo;d wager Bird was upset/heart broken when Magic announced that he was HIV positive.</p>

Not exactly earth shattering or dramatic or anything but a really great heartwarming look at what it feels like for an all-time great to retire. Loads of stuff in there about the Fed-Nadal-Djokovic rivalries, including some pretty touching reflection from Nadal about how much Federer meant to him, as a player and person, etc. etc.</p>

<p>Nadal was one of the first people Federer told about his impending retirement and Nadal talks about hanging up the phone and bursting into tears. He said something to the effect of &ldquo;Playing him was unlike anything I ever experienced in my life and I knew in that moment I would never feel that feeling again.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l9xquz6" class="commentText"><p>Magic v Bird was like that because it was Lakers v Celtics too. Player rivalries are fun when there’s two cities history behind them. Since the Heatles this league isn’t about where you play, it’s who you play with.</p>

<p>Stars don’t stay on the same team anymore and they’re all friends now. The closest we had recently was Kobe. That “I’m a Laker and fuck everyone who isn’t” doesn’t happen anymore.</p>

<p>Magic v Bird is what happens when you have a Kobe on each coast spend their whole career playing for their city. On top of that both teams were good for the whole run. No player rivalry will ever be as good. Not in the super team era</p>

Not really anyone I see right now with personal rivalry type story lines.</p>
