    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>No other rivalry actually comes close to matching Magic vs Bird imo.</p>

<p>It was a rivalry that was truly competitive and yet extremely cordial and respectful.</p>

<p>And it warms the cockles of everyone&rsquo;s hearts when they wore each other&rsquo;s jersey/numbers.</p>

<p>I cannot be wrong.</p>

      <label for="l9xtoj7" class="commentText"><p>Player movement was a response from players in stagnant franchises. I think in the modern NBA with analytics and lessons from past successes, team FO&rsquo;s are a lot more saavy and gives the top stars more reasons to stay, like the J&rsquo;s in Boston, Jokic in Denver, and hopefully Giannis in Milwaukee. Add to that the new parity that makes most teams feel like they can go on a run and win it all unlike ever before.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Messi and Ronaldo have left a vacumn behind where it could be years before we see anyone even come close to them.</p>

<p>That shit has not happened since, for various factors. The Bulls were so dominant it was hard to have rivals. Same with Lakers 00-03.</p>

<p>The closest we’ve come is basically to get about 5 years of Steph/GSW-Bron rivalry.</p>

<p>It could happen again though, especially among the recent young guys. Maybe Shai-Ant will become some sort of classic rivalry. Or Shai-Ja. It just seems harder because of the dilution of talent at the college and NBA level. There are 7 more NBA teams since the majority of the Bird/Magic years.</p>

The NBA Finals wasn&rsquo;t broadcast live until 3 years after Magic was drafted. People became fans of the NBA because they were fans of Magic and Bird; that&rsquo;s never going to happen on the same scale ever again.</p>

The ENTIRE marketing strategy of the NBA at the time was to feed the audience as much Magic-Bird as possible.  The weekend line up was ALWAYS Celtics for game 1, Lakers for game 2.  And they delivered too, every finals in the 80&rsquo;s had either the Lakers or Celtics, and 3 times a Lakers-Celtics matchup.</p>

It’s especially hard for me to understand why white people felt they needed a “great white hope” like Larry. That’s absolutely racist-ass shit that I have never, never understood or been a part of, and I never will be.</p>

<p>I know it’s been written about, but I think it’s hard to talk about it if you couldn’t actually see/encounter it in the culture.</p>

<p>And of course the whole glamour vs lunchpail thing and even East vs West coast thing is kinda weird, since both guys were working glass midwesterners.</p>

<p>For white people, when they are usually into a “great white hype” it is absolutely about “We used to dominate this sport, but now we have all these minorities in it and I can’t relate to it unless there’s a white super star in it.”</p>

<p>That’s the thing I’ll never understand. But I grew up in a time when 3 of the major sports were fairly integrated already, so it didn’t seem like a thing to me. I also didn’t have <em>too many</em> racist relatives trying to tell me about the good old days. The ones who did, I just ignored.</p>

      <label for="l9yhil9" class="commentText"><p>I mean, late 70s and 80s America was still racist as hell. Interracial marriage didn’t even gain 50% approval in this country until the late 90s. Yeah, it was illegal to put up “Whites Only” signs but we weren’t that far removed from Jim Crow.</p>

<p>And that was a huge thing with the NBA in the late 70s. The league was perceived as being “too black” and white people were turning away because of that. Hence Larry Bird being the Great White Hope. Funny thing was, Bird <em>hated</em> that stuff. He tried to run away from it every time someone brought it up.</p>

Obviously to have a good rivalry, you need two great players and a few other ingredients but the impact it&rsquo;ll have totally depends on the needs of the whole medias and organization.</p>

<p>After Bird-Magic, Jordan was above everyone and the main and biggest meatic image of the league. But the current NBA doesn&rsquo;t really need a had-to-head rivalry, maybe between two teams but not between two players because I feel like the main focus of the league right now is to make sure each franchise has at least one charismatic star.</p>

<p>The Celtics and Lakers were pretty even with regards to supporting casts, on the whole. The ‘84-‘87 Celtics in particular had one of the deepest and best casts ever.</p>

<p>The Warriors on the other hand had a huge edge in supporting casts in at least 3 of the 4 series (‘16 wasn’t huge, only because so many of the Dubs players were injured or dog-tired from chasing 73…but that’s the only year there wasn’t a gargantuan discrepancy by the time the finals rolled around).</p>

      <label for="l9xkinr" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I’ve always thought that Magic had the better team but Bird was the better player. Was the case in college and the pros. Parish and McHale were great, but they weren’t Kareem and Worthy.</p>

<p>The main thing Magic has on Bird is that his peak lasted a little bit longer since Larry’s back was kind of cooked after the 87 Finals. But Larry was also much better when they first came into the league so IMO it evens out.</p>

<p>Peak for Peak though, Bird had one of the greatest peaks ever in those four seasons from 84-87 winning 3 straight MVPs, 2 Finals MVPs, and making the Finals all four years. He’s in the conversation with LeBron and MJ for GOAT peak.</p>

<p>Magic’s peak arguably came when the Lakers were on their decline. He was only inarguably the best player on the team for their last two titles. That’s not a diss on Magic though, we’re comparing two top 5-10 players ever. I also think he might have gotten another one if not for HIV but we’ll never know.</p>

It&rsquo;s not the NBA that really created it, pushed it to the next level for sure, but they didn&rsquo;t create it.  Hard to have anything like that today with how diverse, global and balanced the league is.</p>

      <label for="l9wsii5" class="commentText"><p>Cause its tough to create such a rivalry and the media isnt doing much to help.</p>

<p>Best we have rn is Jokic vs Embid or Luka vs Booker.</p>

<p>Though of course Cavs vs Warriors was dam iconic.</p>

<p>Still trying to beat out an all time rivalry like Bird vs Magic is near impossible.</p>

      <label for="l9wufam" class="commentText"><p>Thats why they are just the best we have rn. Their rivalry is more on an individual level as the 2 top centers in the league.</p>

<p>But yeah obviously the big issue is them nor playing each other in big games.</p>

<p>Maybe we get an IST finals between the 76ers and Nuggets in the next couple of years.</p>

<p>That would be good.</p>

<p>But yeah its an issue to create rivalries like Brids and Magic when you dont have  dynasties duking it out every year and the medias advertisment being what it is.</p>

      <label for="l9wwz7d" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I guess I just don&rsquo;t agree that they&rsquo;re the best we have at all. Jokic clears Embiid by every metric. It&rsquo;s hardly a rivalry.</p>

<p>There are plenty of guys who have faced off in the playoffs multiple times in recent years. Any of those are more legitimate than Jokic and Embiid.</p>

<p>The Celtics and Heat have played 4 playoff series in 5 years, surely Butler vs Tatum is a better rivalry than Embiid vs a guy he&rsquo;s never played a playoff game against.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d argue Embiid vs Tatum is more real than Embiid vs Jokic too.</p>

      <label for="l9xrbdj" class="commentText"><p>The media can&rsquo;t create something out of nothing.</p>

<p>Bird and Magic played against each other in the NCAA finals (most watched BASKETBALL game of all time), got drafted to the two greatest franchises with an already huge rivalry, were in different conferences so they could meet in the finals, AND had the good fortune of the remaining teams at their peak being relatively weak so they could keep running into each other after beating everyone else.</p>

<p>Embiid hasn&rsquo;t made it out of the 2nd round, even Jokic has only made one finals so far and will be 30 soon.</p>

<p>Luka and Booker can&rsquo;t meet in the finals, not to mention that the gap between them as players is too big.</p>

<p>Only LeBron vs Curry came close and even that had the caveat of LeBron just clearly being the better player.</p>

      <label for="l9x64rg" class="commentText"><p>I think it’s safe to say if Bird and Magic aren’t #1, it’s definitely Bill and Wilt. After that there’s a few contenders (Isiah and MJ, Steph and Lebron, Oscar and Jerry, Reggie vs the Knicks) and a couple that just needed more years of overlap between the player’s careers (like Kareem vs Wilt or a healthy Walton) but it’s hard to put any of them at the same level as those top 2.</p>

      <label for="l9yjcph" class="commentText"><p>My only thing with that rivalry is that the Celtics beat Wilt’s team pretty much every time it mattered. The lone exception was the 67 ECF, Wilt’s best team in that era (arguably the 67 Sixers are the best team in NBA history - they’re at least in the top 5) and Russell’s first season as player-coach. So Wilt would put up crazy stats, but Russell would win the title.</p>

<p>Bird vs Magic, Bill vs Wilt wasn’t a player rivalry imo.  The teams were so well formed and coached that the marketing took over. Without the supporting cast, there probably wasn’t a rivalry at all.</p>

<p>The Bulls never has a real rival but without the Horace Grants, Bill Cartwrights, Dennis Rodmans, Jim Paxton’s, bj Armstrongs obviously Scottie, I’m not sure how many championships they would have won.</p>

<p>It may seem hard to believe given they were in the league at the same time for a while, but the primes of Kobe and LeBron never actually coincided. By the time LeBron hit his true peak in Miami, Kobe was already on the downside of his career.</p>

      <label for="l9ww770" class="commentText"><p>Has nothing to do with marketing. That shit was organic and started in the 78-79 NCAA season. This is literally about the men, and not the nascent marketing departments of the pre-Stern/Stern NBA.</p>

<p>Because if you think the marketing sucks now, realize that they’re trying based on current market research and actual engagement statistics. In the 80s I guarantee you they had no idea what they were doing and were just throwing shit at the wall to see what actually worked.</p>

Heck, the reason the two became real friends was because Magic travelled to French Lick to film a shoe commercial with Larry.

      <label for="l9x6lp0" class="commentText"><p>Yes, but that was <em>shoe</em> marketing, not NBA marketing. The commenter above was saying “NBA marketing sucks.”</p>

<p>And certainly with them both being on the same shoe company roster, <em>that</em> company has an interest in promoting a friendly rivalry between the two, because it sells more shoes.</p>

<p>I also contend that actual product companies probably understood sales and marketing better than the mid-80s NBA did.</p>

The NBA has problems but marketing individual players is not one of them and I would say they are the best at it and it might be a PROBLEM because now fans follow players as opposed to the NFL where they market teams and team and division rivals</p>

But if they were rivals, it just would’ve actually been talked about. Like Kobe destroyed Duncan in 2008 and if they were rivals that would’ve been a huge slight to Duncan but it really wasn’t. If Bird or Magic wrecked the other like that we’d never hear the end of it</p>

<p>Russell and Chamberlain played more playoff games against one another (49) than Bird and Magic played total games vs each other (37 games).</p>

<p>Altogether Russell and Chamberlain contested each other 143 times in the NBA (94 regular season, 49 playoffs), almost 4x as many games as Bird and Magic did against one another in their NBA careers.  Russell’s teams won 60.6% of their regular season games and 59.2% of their playoff games, or 60.1% of their overall games (86-57).  This is comparable to the percentage of games won by Magic’s teams over Bird’s teams overall (59.5%, 22-15).  (The regular season and playoff win percentages are also similar.)</p>

      <label for="l9xasj3" class="commentText"><p>Shaq vs Duncan should be the obvious one. No hype ever materialized behind Duncan but there&rsquo;s two guys that are near each other on all time great lists, who guarded each other, and whose peaks overlapped. Wild that there isn&rsquo;t more about them two.</p>

<p>Besides that, the big rivalry narratives the NBA got behind became group categories; 90s centers and early 2000&rsquo;s power Forwards.</p>

      <label for="l9x72hc" class="commentText"><p>I would go further and say the only rivalry in sport that compares is Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Both have had titanic battles that will never be forgotten. Both have contrasting styles, and yet they took turns dominating for close to 15 years. Both love each other in the most wholesome manner. And as much their individual rivalries with Djokovic is right up there, in the public conciousness at large, Roger vs Rafa is the pinnacle. Rafa cried when Roger retired, and I&rsquo;d wager Bird was upset/heart broken when Magic announced that he was HIV positive.</p>

      <label for="l9xful7" class="commentText"><p>I just watched the Federer documentary on Amazon Prime following the last days of his career. Would definitely recommend! Not exactly earth shattering or dramatic or anything but a really great heartwarming look at what it feels like for an all-time great to retire. Loads of stuff in there about the Fed-Nadal-Djokovic rivalries, including some pretty touching reflection from Nadal about how much Federer meant to him, as a player and person, etc. etc.</p>

<p>Nadal was one of the first people Federer told about his impending retirement and Nadal talks about hanging up the phone and bursting into tears. He said something to the effect of &ldquo;Playing him was unlike anything I ever experienced in my life and I knew in that moment I would never feel that feeling again.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l9xquz6" class="commentText"><p>Magic v Bird was like that because it was Lakers v Celtics too. Player rivalries are fun when there’s two cities history behind them. Since the Heatles this league isn’t about where you play, it’s who you play with.</p>

<p>Stars don’t stay on the same team anymore and they’re all friends now. The closest we had recently was Kobe. That “I’m a Laker and fuck everyone who isn’t” doesn’t happen anymore.</p>

<p>Magic v Bird is what happens when you have a Kobe on each coast spend their whole career playing for their city. On top of that both teams were good for the whole run. No player rivalry will ever be as good. Not in the super team era</p>

      <label for="l9yity3" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s hard since no other top tier talent had careers coinciding the way they did. Kobe and Duncan is the closest we had to that, but they were in the same conference and it was pretty much Kobe has a good team - wins it all. Kobe doesn&rsquo;t have a good team - Spurs win it all. They had 1 maybe 2 years that actually overlapped when both had good teams. Magic and Bird overlapped great teams in opposing conferences to meet in the finals to give it that extra boost. LeBron&rsquo;s prime years he just rolled the league although they managed to somehow fall short still multiple times. As he was leaving his prime the Warriors became real threats and they had great finals battles. Just not the same since Curry isn&rsquo;t at LeBron&rsquo;s level and Bron was a little past his prime to water it down some. Timing of their careers just don&rsquo;t line up. Bron was part of an era before Curry was even drafted. KD could&rsquo;ve been a great rival, but KD never had a healthy team to compete and when he joined the Warriors it was just a stomp.</p>

<p>Them being 2 of the biggest franchises was a big deal. Black vs white played a massive part of it too that just doesn&rsquo;t exist today and hasn&rsquo;t existed the past 2 decades. You&rsquo;d need Luka or Jokic to go to the Celtics and Tatum to the Lakers to replace Bron or something to mimic that.</p>

Both of them are unlikely to be equaled much less eclipsed by another high-profile rivalry in their respective sports. But if I have to bet, it is more likely in soccer because of the insane pull of Real Madrid and Barcelona <em>plus</em> the freedom of players of choosing their clubs. In the NBA, players could not simply choose where to go unless they are  already UFAs. And if they do, they&rsquo;ll lose money.</p>

<p>In other words, it is more probable to have the two best players in Real Madrid &amp; Barcelona soon than to see the two best players in Lakers and Celtics uniforms.</p>
