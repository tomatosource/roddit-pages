    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>No other rivalry actually comes close to matching Magic vs Bird imo.</p>

<p>It was a rivalry that was truly competitive and yet extremely cordial and respectful.</p>

<p>And it warms the cockles of everyone&rsquo;s hearts when they wore each other&rsquo;s jersey/numbers.</p>

<p>I cannot be wrong.</p>

<p> During  2015-2017 Steph was a defensive liability, he was actively hunted.</p>

<p>  Bron cruised the reg season then amped it up in the post season . 2015 he scored 10ppg more, 2016 it was close to 8ppg, 2017 it was 7.</p>

<p> No need to mention rebounds or playmaking. Peak Steph wasn’t close to Bron.</p>

<p>But yeah obviously the big issue is them nor playing each other in big games.</p>

<p>Maybe we get an IST finals between the 76ers and Nuggets in the next couple of years.</p>

<p>That would be good.</p>

<p>But yeah its an issue to create rivalries like Brids and Magic when you dont have  dynasties duking it out every year and the medias advertisment being what it is.</p>

<p>There are plenty of guys who have faced off in the playoffs multiple times in recent years. Any of those are more legitimate than Jokic and Embiid.</p>

<p>The Celtics and Heat have played 4 playoff series in 5 years, surely Butler vs Tatum is a better rivalry than Embiid vs a guy he&rsquo;s never played a playoff game against.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d argue Embiid vs Tatum is more real than Embiid vs Jokic too.</p>

<p>It may seem hard to believe given they were in the league at the same time for a while, but the primes of Kobe and LeBron never actually coincided. By the time LeBron hit his true peak in Miami, Kobe was already on the downside of his career.</p>

<p>Because if you think the marketing sucks now, realize that they’re trying based on current market research and actual engagement statistics. In the 80s I guarantee you they had no idea what they were doing and were just throwing shit at the wall to see what actually worked.</p>

<p>Why LeBron James unfollowed Perkins.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t tell me this is good marketing, how many past finals have we heard about Bron/Lakers even though they aren&rsquo;t in there? They just don&rsquo;t know how to market anybody who isn&rsquo;t LeBron.</p>

      <label for="l9x3957" class="commentText"><p>I personally do not believe that the NBA is telling ESPN to focus on the dumbass narratives that ESPN focuses on.</p>

<p>I think the league probably <em>does not</em> want that. Because they also see how much it pisses people off.</p>

<p>I do believe that John Skipper and James Pitaro are/have been absolute idiots when it comes to building up sports. They just chase after cheap ratings.</p>

<p>The fact that the Pat McAfee show exists is proof of that to me. No league wants their broadcast partners to have a show where the host is willing to entertain totally speculative and serious criminal allegations that turn out to not be true. They dragged Alan Williams name through the mud.</p>

<p>And certainly with them both being on the same shoe company roster, <em>that</em> company has an interest in promoting a friendly rivalry between the two, because it sells more shoes.</p>

<p>I also contend that actual product companies probably understood sales and marketing better than the mid-80s NBA did.</p>

      <label for="l9wx6tn" class="commentText"><p>The greatness to their rivalry has everything to do with them being college rivals before they were NBA rivals AND THEN going to franchises that were already league rivals AND THEN having both those teams actually be close to dominant in their conferences for a decade.</p>

<p>That shit has not happened since, for various factors. The Bulls were so dominant it was hard to have rivals. Same with Lakers 00-03.</p>

<p>The closest we’ve come is basically to get about 5 years of Steph/GSW-Bron rivalry.</p>

<p>It could happen again though, especially among the recent young guys. Maybe Shai-Ant will become some sort of classic rivalry. Or Shai-Ja. It just seems harder because of the dilution of talent at the college and NBA level. There are 7 more NBA teams since the majority of the Bird/Magic years.</p>

That’s absolutely racist-ass shit that I have never, never understood or been a part of, and I never will be.</p>

<p>I know it’s been written about, but I think it’s hard to talk about it if you couldn’t actually see/encounter it in the culture.</p>

      <label for="l9wulnz" class="commentText"><p>They definitely did, and see why people make it the argument, it just seems like more of a thing people call a rivalry later because of how close their accolades are. But if they were rivals, it just would’ve actually been talked about. Like Kobe destroyed Duncan in 2008 and if they were rivals that would’ve been a huge slight to Duncan but it really wasn’t. If Bird or Magic wrecked the other like that we’d never hear the end of it</p>

      <label for="l9x3gkx" class="commentText"><p>Russell vs Chamberlain was just as good, but most of the people on this site are just too young to have seen those games. I am over 70 and was fortunate enough to watch. Sadly no games were preserve and you only see snippets on YouTube. Chamberlain vs Russell was epic. In the late 60&rsquo;s  and early 70&rsquo;s, Walt Frazer vs Earl Monroe had classic matchups and they are both in the HOF. Bird vs Magic ranks right up there, but to say one was #1, the is a very difficult statement to make. I have been watching since 1965. Oscar Robertson vs Jerry West was a great rivalry but not in the playoffs.  Back in the day with less teams they met more frequently during the regular season.</p>

      <label for="l9x64rg" class="commentText"><p>I think it’s safe to say if Bird and Magic aren’t #1, it’s definitely Bill and Wilt. After that there’s a few contenders (Isiah and MJ, Steph and Lebron, Oscar and Jerry, Reggie vs the Knicks) and a couple that just needed more years of overlap between the player’s careers (like Kareem vs Wilt or a healthy Walton) but it’s hard to put any of them at the same level as those top 2.</p>

<p>*Russell and Chamberlain played the same position and often guarded one another.  Bird and Magic did not.</p>

<p>*Russell and Chamberlain played many more regular season games against one another than Bird and Magic did.</p>

<p>*Russell and Chamberlain played many more playoff series against one another than Bird and Magic did.</p>

Both have had titanic battles that will never be forgotten. Both love each other in the most wholesome manner. And as much their individual rivalries with Djokovic is right up there, in the public conciousness at large, Roger vs Rafa is the pinnacle. Rafa cried when Roger retired, and I&rsquo;d wager Bird was upset/heart broken when Magic announced that he was HIV positive.</p>

      <label for="l9x7cq0" class="commentText"><p>I’m gonna argue KD v LeBron during the 2010s. Their rivalry is the most important rivalry that we’ve probably seen since Bird &amp; Magic.</p>

<p>Going into 2011 conference finals, people were ready for Miami v Thunder NBA Finals, but Dallas interrupted it (also very important is that they swept Lakers, and this was the end of the Kobe era).</p>

<p>Summer 2011, we had KD &amp; LeBron workouts and football games which made the media crucifying them for their friendship. One of the two were gonna become face of the league and both guys were Nike guys. We had lockout games where they both went at each other, then the MVP chase all season and finally the finals.</p>

<p>We all know LeBron won, got FMVP and then won gold at Olympics. How different would the league be had KD won instead? 2010s would’ve been his decade, he’d also be the face of Nike, undoubtedly have more MVPs, Miami big 3 dismantled, Harden probably stays in OKC and he doesn’t go to GS. KD would’ve been 23 with 3 scoring titles, a FMVP and an Olympic gold.</p>
