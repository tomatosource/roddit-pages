    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>No other rivalry actually comes close to matching Magic vs Bird imo.</p>

<p>It was a rivalry that was truly competitive and yet extremely cordial and respectful.</p>

<p>And it warms the cockles of everyone&rsquo;s hearts when they wore each other&rsquo;s jersey/numbers.</p>

<p>I cannot be wrong.</p>

<p>Who played for the two most storied franchises in the sport, who already had a bloody, long-standing rivalry.</p>

<p>And whose rivalry began with the most-watched college game of all-time.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just a wild confluence of events. Hard to imagine something like it happening again.</p>

      <label for="l9xtoj7" class="commentText"><p>Player movement was a response from players in stagnant franchises. I think in the modern NBA with analytics and lessons from past successes, team FO&rsquo;s are a lot more saavy and gives the top stars more reasons to stay, like the J&rsquo;s in Boston, Jokic in Denver, and hopefully Giannis in Milwaukee. Add to that the new parity that makes most teams feel like they can go on a run and win it all unlike ever before.</p>

      <label for="l9wx6tn" class="commentText"><p>The greatness to their rivalry has everything to do with them being college rivals before they were NBA rivals AND THEN going to franchises that were already league rivals AND THEN having both those teams actually be close to dominant in their conferences for a decade.</p>

<p>That shit has not happened since, for various factors. The Bulls were so dominant it was hard to have rivals. Same with Lakers 00-03.</p>

<p>The closest we’ve come is basically to get about 5 years of Steph/GSW-Bron rivalry.</p>

<p>It could happen again though, especially among the recent young guys. Maybe Shai-Ant will become some sort of classic rivalry. Or Shai-Ja. It just seems harder because of the dilution of talent at the college and NBA level. There are 7 more NBA teams since the majority of the Bird/Magic years.</p>

<p>For white people, when they are usually into a “great white hype” it is absolutely about “We used to dominate this sport, but now we have all these minorities in it and I can’t relate to it unless there’s a white super star in it.”</p>

<p>That’s the thing I’ll never understand. But I grew up in a time when 3 of the major sports were fairly integrated already, so it didn’t seem like a thing to me. I also didn’t have <em>too many</em> racist relatives trying to tell me about the good old days. The ones who did, I just ignored.</p>

Obviously to have a good rivalry, you need two great players and a few other ingredients but the impact it&rsquo;ll have totally depends on the needs of the whole medias and organization.</p>

<p>After Bird-Magic, Jordan was above everyone and the main and biggest meatic image of the league. But the current NBA doesn&rsquo;t really need a had-to-head rivalry, maybe between two teams but not between two players because I feel like the main focus of the league right now is to make sure each franchise has at least one charismatic star.</p>

      <label for="l9xkinr" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I’ve always thought that Magic had the better team but Bird was the better player. Was the case in college and the pros. Parish and McHale were great, but they weren’t Kareem and Worthy.</p>

<p>The main thing Magic has on Bird is that his peak lasted a little bit longer since Larry’s back was kind of cooked after the 87 Finals. But Larry was also much better when they first came into the league so IMO it evens out.</p>

<p>Peak for Peak though, Bird had one of the greatest peaks ever in those four seasons from 84-87 winning 3 straight MVPs, 2 Finals MVPs, and making the Finals all four years. He’s in the conversation with LeBron and MJ for GOAT peak.</p>

<p>Magic’s peak arguably came when the Lakers were on their decline. He was only inarguably the best player on the team for their last two titles. That’s not a diss on Magic though, we’re comparing two top 5-10 players ever. I also think he might have gotten another one if not for HIV but we’ll never know.</p>

I’d argue he was at worst, the 3rd best defensive player in that series. 2017, he averaged a 33pt triple double in the finals. Steph is the goat pg imo, but there’s levels to this.</p>

      <label for="l9wufam" class="commentText"><p>Thats why they are just the best we have rn. Their rivalry is more on an individual level as the 2 top centers in the league.</p>

<p>But yeah obviously the big issue is them nor playing each other in big games.</p>

<p>Maybe we get an IST finals between the 76ers and Nuggets in the next couple of years.</p>

<p>That would be good.</p>

<p>But yeah its an issue to create rivalries like Brids and Magic when you dont have  dynasties duking it out every year and the medias advertisment being what it is.</p>

<p>There are plenty of guys who have faced off in the playoffs multiple times in recent years. Any of those are more legitimate than Jokic and Embiid.</p>

<p>The Celtics and Heat have played 4 playoff series in 5 years, surely Butler vs Tatum is a better rivalry than Embiid vs a guy he&rsquo;s never played a playoff game against.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d argue Embiid vs Tatum is more real than Embiid vs Jokic too.</p>

<p>Bird and Magic played against each other in the NCAA finals (most watched BASKETBALL game of all time), got drafted to the two greatest franchises with an already huge rivalry, were in different conferences so they could meet in the finals, AND had the good fortune of the remaining teams at their peak being relatively weak so they could keep running into each other after beating everyone else.</p>

<p>Embiid hasn&rsquo;t made it out of the 2nd round, even Jokic has only made one finals so far and will be 30 soon.</p>

<p>Luka and Booker can&rsquo;t meet in the finals, not to mention that the gap between them as players is too big.</p>

<p>Only LeBron vs Curry came close and even that had the caveat of LeBron just clearly being the better player.</p>

I am over 70 and was fortunate enough to watch. Sadly no games were preserve and you only see snippets on YouTube. Chamberlain vs Russell was epic. In the late 60&rsquo;s  and early 70&rsquo;s, Walt Frazer vs Earl Monroe had classic matchups and they are both in the HOF. Bird vs Magic ranks right up there, but to say one was #1, the is a very difficult statement to make. I have been watching since 1965. Oscar Robertson vs Jerry West was a great rivalry but not in the playoffs.  Back in the day with less teams they met more frequently during the regular season.</p>

After that there’s a few contenders (Isiah and MJ, Steph and Lebron, Oscar and Jerry, Reggie vs the Knicks) and a couple that just needed more years of overlap between the player’s careers (like Kareem vs Wilt or a healthy Walton) but it’s hard to put any of them at the same level as those top 2.</p>

<p>Bird vs Magic, Bill vs Wilt wasn’t a player rivalry imo.  The teams were so well formed and coached that the marketing took over. Without the supporting cast, there probably wasn’t a rivalry at all.</p>

<p>The Bulls never has a real rival but without the Horace Grants, Bill Cartwrights, Dennis Rodmans, Jim Paxton’s, bj Armstrongs obviously Scottie, I’m not sure how many championships they would have won.</p>

The lone exception was the 67 ECF, Wilt’s best team in that era (arguably the 67 Sixers are the best team in NBA history - they’re at least in the top 5) and Russell’s first season as player-coach. So Wilt would put up crazy stats, but Russell would win the title.</p>

<p>It may seem hard to believe given they were in the league at the same time for a while, but the primes of Kobe and LeBron never actually coincided. By the time LeBron hit his true peak in Miami, Kobe was already on the downside of his career.</p>

<p>Because if you think the marketing sucks now, realize that they’re trying based on current market research and actual engagement statistics. In the 80s I guarantee you they had no idea what they were doing and were just throwing shit at the wall to see what actually worked.</p>

<p>With the Finals on what do they discuss?</p>

<p>Why LeBron James unfollowed Perkins.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t tell me this is good marketing, how many past finals have we heard about Bron/Lakers even though they aren&rsquo;t in there? They just don&rsquo;t know how to market anybody who isn&rsquo;t LeBron.</p>

The NBA has problems but marketing individual players is not one of them and I would say they are the best at it and it might be a PROBLEM because now fans follow players as opposed to the NFL where they market teams and team and division rivals</p>

But if they were rivals, it just would’ve actually been talked about. Like Kobe destroyed Duncan in 2008 and if they were rivals that would’ve been a huge slight to Duncan but it really wasn’t. If Bird or Magic wrecked the other like that we’d never hear the end of it</p>

      <label for="l9x72hc" class="commentText"><p>I would go further and say the only rivalry in sport that compares is Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Both have had titanic battles that will never be forgotten. Both have contrasting styles, and yet they took turns dominating for close to 15 years. Both love each other in the most wholesome manner. And as much their individual rivalries with Djokovic is right up there, in the public conciousness at large, Roger vs Rafa is the pinnacle. Rafa cried when Roger retired, and I&rsquo;d wager Bird was upset/heart broken when Magic announced that he was HIV positive.</p>

      <label for="l9xful7" class="commentText"><p>I just watched the Federer documentary on Amazon Prime following the last days of his career. Would definitely recommend! Not exactly earth shattering or dramatic or anything but a really great heartwarming look at what it feels like for an all-time great to retire. Loads of stuff in there about the Fed-Nadal-Djokovic rivalries, including some pretty touching reflection from Nadal about how much Federer meant to him, as a player and person, etc. etc.</p>

<p>Nadal was one of the first people Federer told about his impending retirement and Nadal talks about hanging up the phone and bursting into tears. He said something to the effect of &ldquo;Playing him was unlike anything I ever experienced in my life and I knew in that moment I would never feel that feeling again.&rdquo;</p>

No hype ever materialized behind Duncan but there&rsquo;s two guys that are near each other on all time great lists, who guarded each other, and whose peaks overlapped. Wild that there isn&rsquo;t more about them two.</p>

<p>Besides that, the big rivalry narratives the NBA got behind became group categories; 90s centers and early 2000&rsquo;s power Forwards.</p>

      <label for="l9xquz6" class="commentText"><p>Magic v Bird was like that because it was Lakers v Celtics too. Player rivalries are fun when there’s two cities history behind them. Since the Heatles this league isn’t about where you play, it’s who you play with.</p>

<p>Stars don’t stay on the same team anymore and they’re all friends now. The closest we had recently was Kobe. That “I’m a Laker and fuck everyone who isn’t” doesn’t happen anymore.</p>

<p>Magic v Bird is what happens when you have a Kobe on each coast spend their whole career playing for their city. On top of that both teams were good for the whole run. No player rivalry will ever be as good. Not in the super team era</p>

<p>Leading scorer ever. Best shooter ever.</p>

<p>The two faces of the league for at least, what, a decade? They still are!</p>

<p>The only real reason to say Magic and Bird is because they happened when you were growing up. Well, that&rsquo;s not even a real reason. Should have said the most plausible explanation.</p>

      <label for="l9y1u17" class="commentText"><p>I think, in terms of long-standing, media-friendly, casual-fan framework, then yes, Bird v Magic is perhaps not only the greatest rivalry in NBA history but very likely all of sports.</p>

<p>That said, is we are talking straight up hatred for your enemy, I can think of a few intense ones, not the last of which was the Pistons v Celtics and then the Pistons v Bulls.</p>

<p>The Pistons lost to the Celtics 2 out of three years before finally beating them when playing them for the 4th time in three years. Then beat them three times in 4 years.</p>

<p>Mean while, the Pistons also got hot with Chicago. Isiah Thomas was a Chicago native, Jordan took over his city, and Isiah beat him THREE years in a row in the playoffs, while Jordan only beat them once.</p>

<p>That was a HOT feud. So hot. I&rsquo;d say the level of hatred between those teams (Detroit and Boston as well as Detroit and Chicago) was at least as hot and likely hotter than Celtics/Lakers, though it&rsquo;s a hard thing to measure.</p>

<p>But the thing was, Isiah was never as big a star as Magic, Bird, or Jordan, so from a media perspective, it wasn&rsquo;t as big of a deal.</p>

<p>The Knicks and Bull has some real heat too. And the Bulls/Pacers and later in the 00s the Pistons and Pacers.</p>

<p>But yeah&hellip; Magic and Bird? They were just so well cast as rivals. You couldn&rsquo;t write one better than that.</p>

      <label for="l9y5u5p" class="commentText"><p>If anyone seen the Magic vs. Bird doc on HBO the timeline illustrates perfectly the rivalry between them.  Magic beats Bird in college. Both men take tams to their respective conference championship game their rookie years.  Bid wins rookie of the year in a landslide and Magic admits he was upset about that. That same day was his famous game 6 performance against the Sixers with Kareem injured.  They finally meet on 1984 and Bird wins evening the score with him admitting &ldquo;I got him&rdquo;. Magic admits he got depressed because he didn&rsquo;t play well. Also didn&rsquo;t like the media claiming Bird was better than him in the mid 80&rsquo;s. Magic then gets the best of him the next year finally giving the Lakers a victory over the Celtics in the finals for the first time.  Bird admits he should have retired earlier because of his back but wanted that one last finals matchup which never came.  They both respected each other but didn&rsquo;t like each other because they were competition to each other.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have that deep competitive rivalry anymore.  Everyone is just too friendly and players want to minimize all tension for some reason and fans are the same calling players clowns for getting in players faces ect&hellip;</p>

      <label for="l9yity3" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s hard since no other top tier talent had careers coinciding the way they did. Kobe and Duncan is the closest we had to that, but they were in the same conference and it was pretty much Kobe has a good team - wins it all. Kobe doesn&rsquo;t have a good team - Spurs win it all. They had 1 maybe 2 years that actually overlapped when both had good teams. Magic and Bird overlapped great teams in opposing conferences to meet in the finals to give it that extra boost. LeBron&rsquo;s prime years he just rolled the league although they managed to somehow fall short still multiple times. As he was leaving his prime the Warriors became real threats and they had great finals battles. Just not the same since Curry isn&rsquo;t at LeBron&rsquo;s level and Bron was a little past his prime to water it down some. Timing of their careers just don&rsquo;t line up. Bron was part of an era before Curry was even drafted. KD could&rsquo;ve been a great rival, but KD never had a healthy team to compete and when he joined the Warriors it was just a stomp.</p>

<p>Them being 2 of the biggest franchises was a big deal. Black vs white played a massive part of it too that just doesn&rsquo;t exist today and hasn&rsquo;t existed the past 2 decades. You&rsquo;d need Luka or Jokic to go to the Celtics and Tatum to the Lakers to replace Bron or something to mimic that.</p>
