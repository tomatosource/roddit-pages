<p>He was unbelievably quick. Not for a big man, I mean period. He put the ball in the basket which is what centers are supposed to do on offense. But it wasn’t pretty</p>

<li><p>Reese: 13.6 PPG, 5.1 ORPG, <strong>39.1%</strong> FG, <strong>49.8%</strong> 0-3 feet from the rim</p></li>

<li><p>Moses: 20.3 PPG, 5.1 ORPG, 49.5% FG, no data available 0-3 feet from the rim</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Moses was probably pretty similar style-wise to Drummond, albeit much better at everything.</p>

<p>Reese is just a rookie, so maybe she&rsquo;ll improve. But that was one of the worst scoring seasons in the history of professional basketball.</p>

<p>She shot sub-40% from the field as a center who takes over half her shots right around the rim (and 85% of her shots inside 10 feet). She made Drummond look like Jokic. She made layups look like Westbrick jumpshots.</p>

      <label for="ln985cz" class="commentText"><p>I just don’t think so. I know it may seem that way but he’s not playing against scrubs. There’s no guarantee he’s gonna get the rebound if he misses and even if he does that next shot might be even harder because there are usually more defenders nearby,</p>

<p>I just don’t think many NBA pros “stat pad” in that way.  I would love to see some proof of that. If he shot 40% from the field, and didn’t average many points, maybe.</p>

<p>I just looked and he shot worse from the field in the playoffs than he did in the regular season. Surely he wasn’t intentionally missing shots in the playoffs?</p>

<p>Even if he did, what … that would add a rebound or two per game at most.</p>

      <label for="ln9zmvz" class="commentText"><p>Not the OP you are responding to but his wording is a bit weird. I guess I’ve used it too but it’s not in the literal sense of intentionally missing to get your offense rebound. </p>

<p>Malone invented the famous backboard tap, which he knew he could perfect because he was so much stronger than all the other Cs not named Artis Gilmore. Guys like Kareem, Jack Sikma, young Hakeem, McAdoo, Walton, etc. have been on record telling people how strong Malone was. </p>

<p>So when he got an offense rebounding chance, Malone would tap at the ball to try and tap it in. If it went in, great. If it didn’t, he had a really high chance at getting the next rebound. So that’s how he got 1-2 offense rebounds on some possessions. Now he didn’t do it every time. And that wasn’t the majority of his offense rebounds either. But he did it enough to make it matter statistically over the long run. It probably dropped his overall FG% a few points and increased his overall offense rebounding by 1 a game. So not much but not nothing either. </p>

<p>The other thing was sometimes he got credited with an offense rebound this way without getting credit for the miss. That shouldn’t happen but stats were not greatly tracked then which is how you had games where players got more steals than other team turnovers.</p>

<p>Anyways I’m surprised people just didn’t pull up an old Moses Malone game. You sometimes can find like old Finals games (1983 vs Lakers and Kareem) with the majority of the clips. You’ll see Malone was just an incredible offense rebounder who in addition did this tap occasionally. I believe he had 27 offense rebounds in that 1983 Finals and Kareem had 30 total rebounds. That’s incredible. </p>

      <label for="ln7qydv" class="commentText"><p>NBA was a very different league back then. The Buffalo Braves were desperate to save their franchise and sell part of it so they had to basically trade McAdoo and Malone away for whatever they could get to make it more attractive. They ended up swapping with the Celtics owner and moving to California soon afterwards (where it became the San Diego and eventually LA Clippers) so it didn’t actually matter in the long run but at that time, players like McAdoo held important franchise equity value. </p>

<p>An interesting side note is Jack Ramsey was its coach. He quit since he didn’t want to be part of the mess. He joined Portland and they won a championship in 1977, his very first season after leaving Buffalo. </p>

      <label for="ln9y8tm" class="commentText"><p>Interestingly to me, that was a good trade even though Malone turned out to be better. Portland need Maurice Lucas specifically to win in 1977. Even the great Bill Walton, who named his son Luke, would tell you they don’t win without Lucas that year. But later on of course Malone became the way better player. So I guess they got a ring out of it but traded a better long term player. </p>

<p>EDIT: And of course I’m wrong here after rereading the facts. I thought he was traded for Lucas in the draft but it turned out Portland drafted both Lucas and Malone but just kept Lucas since he thought he was the better fit. So I guess I’m partially right they chose the better fit for 1977 but wrong that they traded Malone for him. They traded Malone for very little, which in retrospect I guess they could have kept him as a backup C for Walton’s injuries. </p>

      <label for="lnaimgv" class="commentText"><p>Oh wow…thanks for your research and getting to the real facts! So true that Malone would have been a great replacement for an injured Walton. However I’m thinking that at that point and time he wouldn’t have been happy being a backup. Amazing that Portland was able to get two stars like Malone and Lucas from the ABA dispersal draft! There will never ever be another draft like that one!</p>

<p>Moses has the unfortunate timing of playing before the real nba explosion. He still was part of the pre magic and bird era, aka the coke era. He also was part of the 75th team, so it wasn’t like he wasn’t rated at all. It’s just there are better big men who always get mentioned ahead of him.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t pick him on your team over shaq, Hakeem, and Duncan.</p>

Guys like Kobe, Steph, KD, and even the young guys like jokic and Giannis are starting to have a say in being ranked higher than Moses.</p>

      <label for="ln6oe2b" class="commentText"><p>This is just a copy a paste of a response I made to a post asking why Moses 3 MVPs aren’t viewed the same as Bird and Magic’s.. but I think it also fits the context of this question too, so I’ll paste below.</p>

<p>Part of it is an actual MVP award doesn’t mean all that much in the grand scheme of things. You can play at an MVP level and finish 2nd, or 3rd, most years it just comes down to how the votes fall and ultimately the winner isn’t always “better” than those who didn’t. It’s sorta like the ring argument to an extent. You need more context than just “2 rings” or just “3 MVPs”. Even with winning the award 3 times Malone is still 17th All-Time in MVP shares. Bird and Magic rank 4th and 5th. Those are players who every single year of their career were in the running for the award, where Moses only has two other instances of a top 5 finish. Bird has 9 (nearly double), Magic also 9.</p>

<p>I don’t think anyone tries to dispute the fact that he won, but it’s just that when you ask why isn’t it viewed the same it’s because the only other players with 3 are Magic and Bird. I think most people view them as having better peaks, primes, etc but also just that when you view it as a bigger picture than literally just “winning 3 MVPs” it’s more like 9 MVP-level years, to 5 MVP-level years.</p>

<p>Big picture for Malone is he’s viewed as a solid but not elite defender, his offensive game was heavily reliant on his offensive rebounding. There isn’t anything wrong with that but most of his scoring comes from put-backs, free throws, isolation, things that don’t typically boost the team overall value because it’s not creating much for those around him. Cleaning up their misses has value, but most impact metrics, advanced stats, don’t view him as having nearly the same value as more traditional offensive engines.</p>

<p>Some call him a “black hole”, I’m not sure that’s entirely fair because if so much of your offense comes from the offensive glass it makes sense to go back up with the ball under the rim because it’s a high chance of scoring or getting fouled. But at the same time most 30ppg bigs are getting the ball within the offense, forcing doubles, which creates openings and high value shots for teammates. Not saying Malone didn’t have that at all, just not nearly to the degree his scoring average would suggest.</p>

<p>16 times in league history (actually ‘73-now because of bball ref) a player has averaged 20+ pp/75 and 15+ ORB%. And Malone is literally half of those. The only other player to do it more than once is Enas Kanter (3 times), and ranking those 16 years by scoring his 2016 season is the most Malone-like year in NBA history. I’m fact if you bump those points to 22+ instead of 20+ Moses and Kanter are the only two players to hit that mark. He’s not a 40 minute a night star, so take the actual stat with a grain of salt, I’m just pointing out that how different Malone is from what you typically see from other scoring bigs. Barkley has a year in there with Philly before he was a focal point, Hakeem as a rookie next to Sampson before he became a focal point. It’s just an odd way to repeatedly be an effective scorer because typically if you’re the one scoring then you’re the one shooting, so you offensive rebound rates aren’t super high because 1.) good scorers have good make percentages and 2.) if you’re the one shooting rarely does the ball bounce right back to you anyways.</p>

<p>Malone’s arrival to all his different teams didn’t really promote massively better upgrades. And while Philly won a ring with his arrival this was a group that had already made two finals. Needing him to be so slightly better than Jones to push them over the top is sorta like Golden State needing someone slightly better than Barnes to push them over. Of course guys like Moses and KD can fill those shoes. And while I do believe he should get lots of credit for fitting in with an already good team and pushing them to a great one, you’ll never win rings if you can’t fit next to other great players, Magic and Bird basically spent their entire careers showcasing that ability.. hence why they are viewed the way they are.</p>

      <label for="ln6viye" class="commentText"><p>The beauty of Moses Malones game was that he would outwork out hustle and out sweat any player on the court…especially the bigs who dared challenge his dominant work ethic! I met him once. He was also a down home funny guy saying ‘Don’t make me look bad out here’ to me and two other guys who played him 3 on one in a ‘show off game at basketball camp. And I know he was wrong for saying he could take 4 of his homeboys from Petersburg, Virginia and beat Larry  Bird’s Boston Celtics in their championship match but he probably really believed it. Moses Malone was easily the greatest offensive rebounder ever to play the game! In his case I’m certain hard work equaled the promise land…RIP Moses!</p>

Dude was a centre who never shot above 55% and has a lot of seasons at 51 or lower and for a big that’s not amazing. He made his living get offensive rebounds and putting them back up until they went in.</p>

<p>Pointing out his weakness on defense compared to the ATG dudes he was lining up against is fair, though it&rsquo;s overstated.   He was better on that end than Jokic or Dirk and was about equivalent to McAdoo when he was putting in work..</p>

All traded for or signed him thinking he was a missing piece and the teams generally didn&rsquo;t improve (or actually got worse) with him on the roster. He&rsquo;d put up numbers until about 1990 but shot poorly for a starting NBA center (under 50%) in the process.</p>

<p>He was elite for Houston and the first couple of years in Philly. He pretty much peaked at 26 and 27 and had a slow decline after that.</p>

      <label for="ln6yc5n" class="commentText"><p>Honestly there&rsquo;s a lot of ball players who have basketball skills that are elevated in major discussions if they have better off the court personalities or played for one of the &ldquo;big market&rdquo; teams like the Lakers.  Rebounders aren&rsquo;t really appreciated much in Top list discussions either since most people think it&rsquo;s a function of being tall and what position you play.  Lots of the overlooked guys tend to be crazy good rebounders.</p>

But it&rsquo;s clear he&rsquo;s a step behind the top 13 guys so I feel the 13-25 range is a good spot for him.</p>

<p>The stats don&rsquo;t tell the story, you have to watch games and see it. Its just not good basketball.</p>

      <label for="ln6rxow" class="commentText"><p>This is beside the point of the original post, but anyone who says Harden was a black hole on offense either isn’t using the term correctly or just doesn’t understand how those Rockets teams were constructed. Being a ball-dominant player does not always equate to being a black hole on offense.</p>

<p>Harden averaged 8.8 assists in the 4 season stretch between 2016 and 2020. He was, and still is, a maestro in the pick and roll and kicking out to shooters on his drives. The Rockets were constructed around Harden’s otherworldly shot creation and playmaking ability.</p>

<p>A real black hole on offense would be someone like Jordan Clarkson, a player who has the ball in his hands a lot and puts up shots while providing little to no playmaking value. I never watched Moses Malone so I can’t testify to that, but it seems that he does have a reputation for being a black hole.</p>

      <label for="ln700ft" class="commentText"><p>Moses Malone was a great player, but he suffers the misfortune of the game having moved away from what he was great at in the intervening decades. He was a center when the world revolved around them and was a dominant post player and rebounder. He was a decent but not amazing defender and didn&rsquo;t pass; he was just kind of a one man wrecking ball but didn&rsquo;t make anyone else better. His game wasn&rsquo;t particularly pretty, but it was effective.</p>

<p>When there was no three ball and the paint was everything, that was a tentpole player. In today&rsquo;s pace and space league he seems like a dinosaur. Backpicks had him 24th best player in 2018, which seems about right, but reputationally it makes sense he&rsquo;s lost his luster with how the game has changed.</p>

<p>I think the main problem for Malone was that he never played in a time when Kareem wasn&rsquo;t in the league. That is to say that Dr. J was the best SF of the 70s and there was never a time where Malone was the best center</p>

      <label for="ln6tuh1" class="commentText"><p>His game wasn&rsquo;t sexy. He scored a lot off dump offs, put backs, and the occasional post up iso (which if he missed, he&rsquo;d get the o-board, leading to a putback), things traditionally associated with role playing bigs, not superstar bigs.</p>

<p>Also, even though he was truly historically great at it, he was known to stat pad offensive rebounds, which, according to current discourse, is the 8th deadly sin.</p>

<p>2 points is 2 points, imo, but people really don&rsquo;t appreciate offensive rebounds and putbacks unless it&rsquo;s from undersized players/ guards.</p>

Jokic has passed them but where is Moses mentioned in all-time great talks that is unfair for him? Looking across other positions I guess if you have issue with guys like Giannis, KG, Dirk, Karl, and Charles being ranked above him I can see an argument for him above them. But he’s behind the KD, Oscar, West group imo.</p>

      <label for="ln7qpke" class="commentText"><p>He was an elite center who played hard didn’t generate highlight plays. Great scorer and rebounder but pretty poor playmaker. Wasn’t particularly media savvy or charismatic on camera either.</p>

<p>It’s hard to argue against his impact though. One of only nine players to have 3 MVPs and he dominated prime Kareem in the 1983 finals.  Also carried a trash Rockets team with a losing record to the finals a couple years before. He’s firmly top 20 IMO, but there’s 5-6 centers ahead of him on the all time rankings which dilutes his recognition.</p>

<p>Edit: It also doesn’t help that he played most of his career with the Rockets and they drafted Hakeem just a few years after he left. Hard to top everything after that.</p>

      <label for="ln6wb0u" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s not disrespected at all.</p>

<p>Because when you start comparing him to the true top guys,, those career achievements don&rsquo;t look as impressive. Using AllNBA as an example:</p>

<p>Other &ldquo;bigs&rdquo; with 4 All NBA 1st team: KG, Dirk and Robinson. (Moses is consistently rated above these guys).</p>

<p>Guys with more:  Barkley, Howard (5), Giannis, Hakeem Mikan (6), Wilt (7), Shaq (8), Duncan Kareem and Pettit (10) and Karl (11). (And this is not including Bill Russell who only had 3 first team, usually coming second to Wilt there, but who is a good argument as the 2nd best C of all time).</p>

<p>And there&rsquo;s a number of guys above him in All NBA (including Karl), who Moses is consistently rated ahead of.</p>

<p>Moses was great, even an &ldquo;all-time great&rdquo;, but he is very fairly not considered in the top 12-13 guys, and a list that probably becomes top 15 after the current guys play out their careers.</p>

<p>Instead he is firmly in that next tier, that could probably stretch anywhere from 14-30. He is obviously near the top of this tier, hell even happily put him 14 right now if you want (though O probably has a better case as the gatekeeper between tiers), but I don&rsquo;t think there is any argument to put him in the tier above.</p>

<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t pay too much attention to MVP numbers. It is too small sample sizes, when there are too many contextual things that can impact voting. Malone just happened to peak at probably one of the weakest historical points of the NBA. After Kareem, and before Magic, Bird, and then Jordan. If he was either 10 years older, or 10 years younger, I don&rsquo;t think he gets more than 1.</p>

      <label for="ln6wf9o" class="commentText"><p>Moses Malone is by far the most discussed &ldquo;underrated&rdquo; player ever. You all have this exact same discussion about him on a weekly basis. Lol you all call him underrated, yet none of you actually rank him where you pretend you think he belongs. It&rsquo;s like Malone doesn&rsquo;t exist unless someone says the word &ldquo;underrated&rdquo;. He&rsquo;s the fucking Beetlejuice of the NBA I swear to God.</p>

<p>At worst, Malone is generally ranked like 5-10 spots lower than he arguably should be, yet you all treat that like that makes him the most underappreciated player ever. Meanwhile, actually underrated players get zero love. Let&rsquo;s talk about Antawn Jamison or Dan Issel. Legit underrated players. And if you wanna talk about all time greats, then guys like Willis Reed, Elgin Baylor, and Walt Bellamy are way more slept on than Moses.</p>

      <label for="ln6wh9w" class="commentText"><p>I think part of it is that he had his best run, as the best player in the league during the late seventies and he gets lost in the magic and bird era, and once those two started playing each other in the finals the sixers were kind of done afterwards.</p>

<p>His game isn&rsquo;t the most pleasing to watch, he played for way too long, Dr. J is a more famous player and he teamed up with him to win his only championship, and not to mention I think what really hurts him is that he doesn&rsquo;t really have a team that is his &ldquo;home&rdquo; per say, he&rsquo;s one of the better short-term players of all time on a couple franchises but when you think of the rockets you think of Hakeem if you think of the 76ers people think of barkley, Iverson, the doctor and maybe even Wilt before Moses</p>

He had an ugly shot and made his mark cleaning up boards and put backs.  You know in pick up ball that one big dude who just bullies everyone in the paint and out hustles everyone getting rebounds and fighting to get a put back into the basket - that was Moses Malone.  In that era without threes you absolutely needed someone like that, and he was the best at that.  He was also kind of a ballhog, and again that’s a product of the era.  There was no kick option for a three pointer, it was better to take a higher probability shot inside.  </p></li>

      <label for="ln90law" class="commentText"><p>Offensive rebounding numbers get inflated by intentionally missing his own shots to get the board in a better position… not saying this isn’t incredibly cerebral and impressive, but it does inflate the numbers. He also got a KD ring which people will always respect less.</p>
