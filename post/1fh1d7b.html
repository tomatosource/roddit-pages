<p>This is total bullshit.</p>

<p>He averaged 0.1/g over Kareem and 0.4/g over Jordan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>lazy on defense etc</p>

<p>Pointing out his weakness on defense compared to the ATG dudes he was lining up against is fair, though it&rsquo;s overstated.   He was better on that end than Jokic or Dirk and was about equivalent to McAdoo when he was putting in work..</p>

      <label for="ln6rxow" class="commentText"><p>This is beside the point of the original post, but anyone who says Harden was a black hole on offense either isn‚Äôt using the term correctly or just doesn‚Äôt understand how those Rockets teams were constructed. Being a ball-dominant player does not always equate to being a black hole on offense.</p>

<p>Harden averaged 8.8 assists in the 4 season stretch between 2016 and 2020. He was, and still is, a maestro in the pick and roll and kicking out to shooters on his drives. The Rockets were constructed around Harden‚Äôs otherworldly shot creation and playmaking ability.</p>

<p>A real black hole on offense would be someone like Jordan Clarkson, a player who has the ball in his hands a lot and puts up shots while providing little to no playmaking value. I never watched Moses Malone so I can‚Äôt testify to that, but it seems that he does have a reputation for being a black hole.</p>

      <label for="ln6oe2b" class="commentText"><p>This is just a copy a paste of a response I made to a post asking why Moses 3 MVPs aren‚Äôt viewed the same as Bird and Magic‚Äôs.. but I think it also fits the context of this question too, so I‚Äôll paste below.</p>

<p>Part of it is an actual MVP award doesn‚Äôt mean all that much in the grand scheme of things. You can play at an MVP level and finish 2nd, or 3rd, most years it just comes down to how the votes fall and ultimately the winner isn‚Äôt always ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than those who didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs sorta like the ring argument to an extent. You need more context than just ‚Äú2 rings‚Äù or just ‚Äú3 MVPs‚Äù. Even with winning the award 3 times Malone is still 17th All-Time in MVP shares. Bird and Magic rank 4th and 5th. Those are players who every single year of their career were in the running for the award, where Moses only has two other instances of a top 5 finish. Bird has 9 (nearly double), Magic also 9.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt think anyone tries to dispute the fact that he won, but it‚Äôs just that when you ask why isn‚Äôt it viewed the same it‚Äôs because the only other players with 3 are Magic and Bird. I think most people view them as having better peaks, primes, etc but also just that when you view it as a bigger picture than literally just ‚Äúwinning 3 MVPs‚Äù it‚Äôs more like 9 MVP-level years, to 5 MVP-level years.</p>

<p>Big picture for Malone is he‚Äôs viewed as a solid but not elite defender, his offensive game was heavily reliant on his offensive rebounding. There isn‚Äôt anything wrong with that but most of his scoring comes from put-backs, free throws, isolation, things that don‚Äôt typically boost the team overall value because it‚Äôs not creating much for those around him. Cleaning up their misses has value, but most impact metrics, advanced stats, don‚Äôt view him as having nearly the same value as more traditional offensive engines.</p>

<p>Some call him a ‚Äúblack hole‚Äù, I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs entirely fair because if so much of your offense comes from the offensive glass it makes sense to go back up with the ball under the rim because it‚Äôs a high chance of scoring or getting fouled. But at the same time most 30ppg bigs are getting the ball within the offense, forcing doubles, which creates openings and high value shots for teammates. Not saying Malone didn‚Äôt have that at all, just not nearly to the degree his scoring average would suggest.</p>

<p>16 times in league history (actually ‚Äò73-now because of bball ref) a player has averaged 20+ pp/75 and 15+ ORB%. And Malone is literally half of those. The only other player to do it more than once is Enas Kanter (3 times), and ranking those 16 years by scoring his 2016 season is the most Malone-like year in NBA history. I‚Äôm fact if you bump those points to 22+ instead of 20+ Moses and Kanter are the only two players to hit that mark. He‚Äôs not a 40 minute a night star, so take the actual stat with a grain of salt, I‚Äôm just pointing out that how different Malone is from what you typically see from other scoring bigs. Barkley has a year in there with Philly before he was a focal point, Hakeem as a rookie next to Sampson before he became a focal point. It‚Äôs just an odd way to repeatedly be an effective scorer because typically if you‚Äôre the one scoring then you‚Äôre the one shooting, so you offensive rebound rates aren‚Äôt super high because 1.) good scorers have good make percentages and 2.) if you‚Äôre the one shooting rarely does the ball bounce right back to you anyways.</p>

<p>Malone‚Äôs arrival to all his different teams didn‚Äôt really promote massively better upgrades. And while Philly won a ring with his arrival this was a group that had already made two finals. Needing him to be so slightly better than Jones to push them over the top is sorta like Golden State needing someone slightly better than Barnes to push them over. Of course guys like Moses and KD can fill those shoes. And while I do believe he should get lots of credit for fitting in with an already good team and pushing them to a great one, you‚Äôll never win rings if you can‚Äôt fit next to other great players, Magic and Bird basically spent their entire careers showcasing that ability.. hence why they are viewed the way they are.</p>

      <label for="ln6tuh1" class="commentText"><p>His game wasn&rsquo;t sexy. He scored a lot off dump offs, put backs, and the occasional post up iso (which if he missed, he&rsquo;d get the o-board, leading to a putback), things traditionally associated with role playing bigs, not superstar bigs.</p>

<p>Also, even though he was truly historically great at it, he was known to stat pad offensive rebounds, which, according to current discourse, is the 8th deadly sin.</p>

<p>2 points is 2 points, imo, but people really don&rsquo;t appreciate offensive rebounds and putbacks unless it&rsquo;s from undersized players/ guards.</p>

<p>He was unbelievably quick. Not for a big man, I mean period. He put the ball in the basket which is what centers are supposed to do on offense. But it wasn‚Äôt pretty</p>

I met him once. He was also a down home funny guy saying ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt make me look bad out here‚Äô to me and two other guys who played him 3 on one in a ‚Äòshow off game at basketball camp. And I know he was wrong for saying he could take 4 of his homeboys from Petersburg, Virginia and beat Larry  Bird‚Äôs Boston Celtics in their championship match but he probably really believed it. Moses Malone was easily the greatest offensive rebounder ever to play the game! In his case I‚Äôm certain hard work equaled the promise land‚Ä¶RIP Moses!</p>
