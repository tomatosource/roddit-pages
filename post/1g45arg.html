</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>As a key player in soft power, the UAE has engaged in various fields to boost its international influence. The Emirates’ soft power majorly reflects in its strategic engagement in global sports events. In its pattern of investing heavily in high-profile sport tournaments and teams, the UAE has become the hub for the National Basketball Association (NBA) in the Middle East.</p>

<p>The league marked its third trip to Abu Dhabi for the preseason games, in October 2024. The event started with the Boston Celtics’ Jaylen Brown greeting the Etihad Arena in Arabic. Despite the festive atmosphere, many noticed the UAE’s superficial display of modernization and tolerance. There have been ethical concerns regarding human rights violations under the UAE&rsquo;s authoritarian regime.</p>

<p>NBA previously faced scrutiny for its partnerships with repressive regimes, including China and Rwanda. The league was now facing questions for choosing the UAE, a government that limits freedom of speech. Critics argued that NBA became another high-profile sports event to act as the UAE’s sportswashing tool, diverting attention from the Emirates’ controversial actions and enhancing its international reputation.</p>

      <label for="ls0xxih" class="commentText"><p>The international chess organization (FIDE) was so hypnotized by money over morals that they agreed to host the 2017 Women&rsquo;s Chess Championships (blitz, rapid, and classical) in Saudi Arabia and Iran, where all the players had to wear Muslim headscarves and be accompanied by men when outside. Several women rightfully refused to participate and FIDE just ran it without them.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s just insane to me. And Iran didn&rsquo;t pay up afterward.</p>

      <label for="ls168z1" class="commentText"><p>I don’t condone what the UAE has done with trapping migrants and the other horrible stuff they did but we only seem to talk about sports washing in the context of Arab nations. Every preseason an NBA team plays Macabi Tel-Aviv and I don’t see anybody complaining about sports washing despite that country being accused of numerous war crimes by virtually all the Human rights orgs AND the ICC.</p>

<p>We should acknowledge sport washing for everyone not just limited to Arab countries.</p>

<p>I never like to defend the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other such GCC countries but this outrage seemingly only pops up when you talk about them and not really with other countries. I suspect it&rsquo;s largely because of them having Islam as a major part of the culture and government.</p>

<p>If you want to champion human rights there, please also ask the same standard in the rest of the world too</p>

      <label for="ls1e0cq" class="commentText"><p>There’s been pretty good sportswashing journalism covering Gazprom and its sponsorship of the Champions League (top European football tournament) in Europe.</p>

<p>There are other cases, but the UAE and Saudi are doing it on a scale that is incomparable. Building multi-club ownership models, hosting every sport that has coverage, flying out teams, hosting Spanish football cup games etc.</p>

<p>Once they’re in it’s hard to go back, now we’re seeing Manchester City in a massive court case, facing 115 charges of breaching financial rules and failing to comply with investigations. This is after a decade of league dominance. NBA be warned</p>

<p>Good piece on Russia’s sports-washing efforts:</p>

I get people are against Israel because of this but the 2 are not even close to being the same. Also, I see nowhere in your comment history you demanding the release of hostages anywhere which clearly shows you only jumped on this anti Israel bandwagon after October 7th and probably only have done so because Tik tok told you to.</p>

<p>If you care about crimes you have to been fuming about Palestine your whole life, but since I haven&rsquo;t heard a word from you over the last ten years about child marriage or child soldiers in Gaza, I don&rsquo;t trust your concerns. Or the 10 thousands of rockets that have been randomly fired from Gaza or Libanon over the 10 years.</p>

<p>All the Palestinians have to do is become a normal secular society that doesnt have the Jihad against us all in their constitution and doesnt kill gay people, but no, their PR game set the worlds perspective on this conflict back another ten years and teenagers from all over the world secured Palestinians in their believe that they are true humanists.</p>

<p>My country has never done shit to Palestine, we gave billions in aid and sheltered their refugees. In return they attacked the fucking olympics on our soil and 10 of our hostages are still rotting in the tunnels.</p>

<p>“Never done shit”, if you want to believe all the hospitals and schools and refugee camps deserved to be bombed because they all had hamas in it then be my guest. But you’re not gonna wash away the illegal settlements, the nakba, the killing of aid organizations. The denial of aid from aid organizations to Gaza. But yeah everything is a lie, UNWRA which is a UN aid organization is khamas that’s why they can’t enter Gaza.</p>

<p>I’m really not tryna debate you in the r/nba subreddit so this is the last time I’ll respond to you but the ICJ and the ICC can’t be fabricating all this evidence because they are khamas too. Everyone who is agaisnt your war isn’t a khamas supporter</p>

Do you think what Palestine does within their autonomy will ever be accepted? If Israel vanished tomorrow, Palestine would be considered a bigger hellhole than Syria. Islamism and fascism over there are a reality mate.</p>

<p>Settlers are a minor problem Israel has solved before in the past, the Nakba isn&rsquo;t what it is under the context of 1947 and I don&rsquo;t trust aid organizations in Gaza as long as they dont let journalists from my country work there freely. UNRWA has 30.000 employees, UNHCR has 20.000. Thats all you need to know about this institution. Lazzarini should be in prison.</p>

<p>You give the UN the absolute value, in reality all the arabic and western gouvernments side with Israel. Everyone who is against this war ignores islamism and gaslights himself into believing the Palestine society is a beacon of freedom and humanism. Its not.</p>

      <label for="ls0tle6" class="commentText"><p>I would say that the NBA&rsquo;s decision to host preseason games in the UAE raises valid concerns about sportswashing. While sports can be a powerful force for unity and positive change, it&rsquo;s important to be mindful of the political and social context in which these events take place. The UAE&rsquo;s human rights record, including restrictions on freedom of speech and the treatment of migrant workers, should be considered. It&rsquo;s a complex issue with no easy answers, but it&rsquo;s worth discussing openly and honestly.</p>
