      <label for="lk7lirz" class="commentText"><p>Yeah. As I remember it, Ayton was the consensus #1 pick. “David Robinson with a 3 pointer.”</p>

<p>Luka was the euro who most people said could be the best player in the draft. Everyone was concerned though, because he played in Madrid and not Tucson.</p>

<p>Bagley could jump two times in a row. Like really, really, really good.</p>

<p>JJJ had the defense and the makings of a 3 point shot. Bamba was the same, but with stretch Armstrong arms.</p>

<p>And Trae Young was the “next Steph.”</p>

<p>As a Mavs fan, I was mentally prepared to cheer for Mo Bamba and Dennis Smith Jr.</p>

      <label for="lk86ugv" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t blame anyone taking Ayton at 1 at the time. It&rsquo;s that Greg Oden thing. If you have a chance to draft a 7ft defensive anchor whose gonna pull down 12 a night and give you an efficient 20, you take it. I thinkt the disappointment with Ayton is that he doesn&rsquo;t really seem like he&rsquo;s a franchise centrepiece. He&rsquo;s only ever gonna be a second or third guy. And then you add to the fact that you could have had Luca.</p>

The late mocks with Ayton and Bagley <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> were predictions of what might happen based on rumors, not reflections of their opinions on who should go in what order. There were draft analysts like the Stepien who rightly identified that Luka was a tier above everyone else at the top of that draft and better than most #1 overall picks.</p>

      <label for="lk7ppoy" class="commentText"><p>Its absolute malpractice that ANY player was taken over him. It&rsquo;s a perfect example of groupthink and herd mentality. He could have been 6 inches shorter and he still would have been a surefire NBA rotation player. At 6&rsquo;8 his worst-case outcome was all-star level player. The fact that an NBA GM making millions of dollars picked Bagley over him is completely ludicrous (and I said that at the time for the record).</p>

Like any 6&rsquo;8 primary ballhandler who is the best player in the Euroleague as a child has an absurdly high ceiling. I&rsquo;m not even a big draft guy but it seemed obvious to me at the time that a player with that kind of skill level was worlds ahead of Ayton and Bagley both in terms of immediate impact and long term potential.</p>

      <label for="lk82hyc" class="commentText"><p>even without going in the route of injuries (which imo has merit), bad luck and just not as insane as doncic at all at this age, the real reason for rubio&rsquo;s relative failure at the NBA level is very easily identifiable</p>

<p>rubio couldn&rsquo;t score, like at all (we&rsquo;re talking like 3X% at the rim, and has a career FG% of 38 lmao and 50%TS) so their game are very different, for reference luka has seasons of 70+% at the rim</p>

<p>almost everything else in his game was truly elite and he was genuinely insanely talented player but what kept him at &ldquo;only&rdquo; a very good NBA player was a flaw that was NOT present at all in luka&rsquo;s game</p>

<p>well honestly its because he didnt look fast or athletic, so he was seen as a generational passing talent who might not be able to make the leap to be a scorer too in the NBA</p>

<p>and yes it was dumb in hindsight but i think people underestimate (or forget) that the &ldquo;overrated Euro&rdquo; thing has been very real in the past. like a high skilled Euro player whose game doesnt translate to the NBA in the same way</p>

<p>so i think it was totally fair for the general NBA fans and pundits to have some reservations. i think any GMs/scouts who didnt have him #1 (or tied with Ayton) are the ones who deserve criticism</p>

      <label for="lk79kkx" class="commentText"><p>His hype was different because for JJJ and other top ranked players at that time, they all knew each other or at least have heard of each other from other players, camps, AAU, etc. Luka was the first overseas player for their generation to be highly ranked and highly touted despite not coming up and developing in the American system like they did, so they didn’t believe in how good he was compared to other top guys in that class like JJJ himself, MPJ, Bagley etc</p>

Most of the top American/Canadian picks have been playing against each since 12 years old if not younger. No one saw Luka till he got there because he was in a different country</p>

<p>I mean all the american draftees grew up with each other playing in the same camps and stuff and then hear talks about some white european kid coming to fuck shit up</p>
