      <label for="lk7lirz" class="commentText"><p>Yeah. As I remember it, Ayton was the consensus #1 pick. “David Robinson with a 3 pointer.”</p>

<p>Luka was the euro who most people said could be the best player in the draft. Everyone was concerned though, because he played in Madrid and not Tucson.</p>

<p>Bagley could jump two times in a row. Like really, really, really good.</p>

<p>JJJ had the defense and the makings of a 3 point shot. Bamba was the same, but with stretch Armstrong arms.</p>

<p>And Trae Young was the “next Steph.”</p>

<p>As a Mavs fan, I was mentally prepared to cheer for Mo Bamba and Dennis Smith Jr.</p>

<p>I love Trae and I&rsquo;m a firm believer of him being an underrated player in today&rsquo;s league. But trying to hold even a semblance of discussion between Luka and Trae even this early in their careers is borderline blasphemous.</p>

Bam is very disciplined and coachable with an insane work ethic. It seems Ayton doesn’t have those qualities. Bam is shooting game winning threes now lol. Bam started as nothing but a hard nosed defender and a decent passer. He’s gotten better at what he does plus added more. Ayton started out more talented than Bam but has somehow been static?</p>

If you have a chance to draft a 7ft defensive anchor whose gonna pull down 12 a night and give you an efficient 20, you take it. I thinkt the disappointment with Ayton is that he doesn&rsquo;t really seem like he&rsquo;s a franchise centrepiece. He&rsquo;s only ever gonna be a second or third guy. And then you add to the fact that you could have had Luca.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>No, ppl dont realize how special Greg Oden was. Oden just was never healthy, but even the bit that he did play after missing his rookie year, he looked like he was worth the pick. Honest to god, he&rsquo;s the closest thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen to Shaq, but he was going to be a defensive version that needed to grow into his offensive game.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s analysts that maintain that had he stayed healthy he would still go #1 even with hindsight of how Durant turned out. Deandre Ayton is just an unmotivated, soft big. Coming out of college he wasn&rsquo;t even expected to be a defensive anchor, he had bad instincts on that end and got torched by Buffalo in the NCAA tournament.</p>

<p>Oden was probably a top 10ish prospect since the turn of the century.</p>

      <label for="lka65q0" class="commentText"><p>Yeah if they had the pleasure of watching Oden at OSU they’d know he was a generational level prospect. He gave two borderline hall of famers Noah and Horford 25-12 and 4 blocks in the championship game with his still recovering wrist. While there were questions to if Ayton even loved the game before he left Zona. It’s true that a lot of times GM’s just fall in love with the big guy but in Odens case it was warranted.</p>

He wasn&rsquo;t a total bust or anything but he has had a disappointing career especially as a number 1 pick in a very important draft.</p>

<p>Had any of those 3 guys been healthy I&rsquo;m not so sure we would have been able to make that run. It was a weak postseason for the West.</p>

<p>This is fucking key. I remember seeing comments from American sceptics, comparing Luka to Rubio, Darko. Neither of which were NEARLY as good as Luka was in Europe. Darko to Luka is like Scalabrine to LeBron. And a lot of Americans that don&rsquo;t watch euro basketball was unironically making that comparison &ldquo;what about Darko though?&rdquo;</p>

Not sure how much influence the Suns coach had over the pick since he was a first-year head coach and Ayton was a pretty elite hometown prospect, but people hated the Kings pick immediately</p>

      <label for="lkeypjn" class="commentText"><p>Also many draft analysts and (presumably) other GMs had him at #1. Its hard to know for sure because in hindsight, the 26 teams that didn&rsquo;t pass on him all swear they would have taken him. Just like all the teams that swear now they desperately wanted Giannis.</p>

<p>Ayton was a pick by the owner because they went to the same school. We have no idea what the GMs actual opinion was.</p>

<p>The Kings&hellip; who knows. Divac is pretty infamously one of the worst GMs of recent history though. I remember when it became apparent Ayton was going #1, everyone just assumed Doncic was going 2 because of the Balkan connection. Then there were reports or comments from Divac about Luka being overrated and we were all confused.</p>

<p>Hawks honestly is more defensible. In retrospect they lost the trade, but its closer than people like to think. Trae is very good and that pick could have been as high as #6 in either of the following years and made it even closer.</p>

<p>Also, for what its worth Cuban told reporters no deal was getting done and he personally called the hawks owner during the draft and got him to agree to it without GMs involved. No idea how true that is but its at least possible Schlenk wanted Luka as well.</p>

      <label for="lk7ppoy" class="commentText"><p>Its absolute malpractice that ANY player was taken over him. It&rsquo;s a perfect example of groupthink and herd mentality. He could have been 6 inches shorter and he still would have been a surefire NBA rotation player. At 6&rsquo;8 his worst-case outcome was all-star level player. The fact that an NBA GM making millions of dollars picked Bagley over him is completely ludicrous (and I said that at the time for the record).</p>

Like any 6&rsquo;8 primary ballhandler who is the best player in the Euroleague as a child has an absurdly high ceiling. I&rsquo;m not even a big draft guy but it seemed obvious to me at the time that a player with that kind of skill level was worlds ahead of Ayton and Bagley both in terms of immediate impact and long term potential.</p>

Ricky Rubio still was very good in the Spanish league. He was all ACB team as a 17 yr old and 18 yr old, the second most competitive league in the world. He had a silver medal and contributed at 17 yrs old on a stacked Spanish team. Before Luka this was the most decorated overseas youngster and he turned out to be a quality starter.</p>

Just saying that he was playing well as a euroleague player when he was 16-19 (not on Doncic’s level but still one of the top players) and didn’t become all-world</p>

<p>rubio couldn&rsquo;t score, like at all (we&rsquo;re talking like 3X% at the rim, and has a career FG% of 38 lmao and 50%TS) so their game are very different, for reference luka has seasons of 70+% at the rim</p>

<p>almost everything else in his game was truly elite and he was genuinely insanely talented player but what kept him at &ldquo;only&rdquo; a very good NBA player was a flaw that was NOT present at all in luka&rsquo;s game</p>

      <label for="lk976yo" class="commentText"><p>Ricky Rubio would have been an All-Star at least a couple times in his career if he played in an earlier era.</p>

<p>He was a truly elite passer and playmaker, and a really good defender as well, all that transfered to the NBA level really well.</p>

<p>There are tons of point guards who were bad scorers, but good playmakers and defenders, so they managed to stick around the league for a long time and have significant success due to the fact that the league wasn&rsquo;t as offensive oriented and even solid three point shooting wasn&rsquo;t seen as a must have for a guard, like it is today.</p>

<p>Rubio started his career in the 2010s, when his glaring offensive weaknesses (which were evident when he was playing in the Euroleague as well) were a much bigger problem now, so pass first point guards slowly started going extinct.</p>

<p>He averaged 6 PPG and had a 50% TS his last season in the Euroleague before going to the NBA and shot 22% from three.</p>

<p>He averaged 4 PPG and shot a 35% TS in the second phase of the Euroleague, and 7 PPG and 49% TS in the quarter-finals series which Barcelona lost in the end.</p>

<p>His scoring and three point shooting was awful, but he was amazing at everything else, so they were banking on him figuring it out.</p>

<p>Doncic was the Euroleague MVP, the Euroleague champion, the Euroleague Final Four MVP, the Spanish league MVP and the Spanish league champion the season prior to him being drafted, as well as the EuroBasket champion with Slovenia the year prior, as the second best player on the team.</p>

<p>He achieved all this as a 19-year-old.</p>

<p>If anyone replicated Luka’s success in the European league while being 18 years old he would be undeniably the best prospect in the world.</p>

<p>Idk what revisionist history is happening now but anyone who watched Luka play knew he was the best player in the draft. I have watched (nearly) every single Mavs game since Luka’s rookie year because I knew I was watching a special all-time player. It’s like with MJ or Kobe, you wanted to watch every game you could</p>

      <label for="lkf38u5" class="commentText"><p>The big question (at the time) was is he athletic enough to do those things at an NBA level. He did (and still does) rely on his ability to get to and score around the basket a lot. Because of his lack of traditional measurable athleticism, there were questions if he could do that against NBA defenders. It turns out his skill level makes it irrelevant, and most people realized that but it was impossible to know for sure at the time.</p>

<p>His shot was also a question. He took a lot of off the dribble difficult 3s and didn&rsquo;t make them at a great clip against Euroleague defenders. So if he couldn&rsquo;t get to the rim as well and relied on a streaky outside shot in addition to the defensive concerns&hellip;</p>

<p>Also, its a bit misleading to talk about the Euroleague MVP like it means the same as an NBA MVP. He only started 17 of 35 games and played like 20 minutes per game - Euroleague in general is much more team/depth oriented.</p>

<p>For what its worth, I (and most of the people i listened to at the time) had him clearly #1. Most of the analytics guys had him as a generational type prospect. This is just to give some context to the discussion leading up to the draft and why it wasn&rsquo;t as obvious as some people think.</p>

<p>well honestly its because he didnt look fast or athletic, so he was seen as a generational passing talent who might not be able to make the leap to be a scorer too in the NBA</p>

<p>and yes it was dumb in hindsight but i think people underestimate (or forget) that the &ldquo;overrated Euro&rdquo; thing has been very real in the past. like a high skilled Euro player whose game doesnt translate to the NBA in the same way</p>

<p>so i think it was totally fair for the general NBA fans and pundits to have some reservations. i think any GMs/scouts who didnt have him #1 (or tied with Ayton) are the ones who deserve criticism</p>

<p>I mean all the american draftees grew up with each other playing in the same camps and stuff and then hear talks about some white european kid coming to fuck shit up</p>

Then some time after the draft, when he first saw Luka play against other NBA talent, JJJ realised the hype was real because of Luka&rsquo;s seamless transition into the NBA (he looked like he had the experience of a player that had played a 100 years in the league).</p>
