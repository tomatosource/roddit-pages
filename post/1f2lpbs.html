      <label for="lk7lirz" class="commentText"><p>Yeah. As I remember it, Ayton was the consensus #1 pick. “David Robinson with a 3 pointer.”</p>

<p>Luka was the euro who most people said could be the best player in the draft. Everyone was concerned though, because he played in Madrid and not Tucson.</p>

<p>Bagley could jump two times in a row. Like really, really, really good.</p>

<p>JJJ had the defense and the makings of a 3 point shot. Bamba was the same, but with stretch Armstrong arms.</p>

<p>And Trae Young was the “next Steph.”</p>

<p>As a Mavs fan, I was mentally prepared to cheer for Mo Bamba and Dennis Smith Jr.</p>

      <label for="lk86ugv" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t blame anyone taking Ayton at 1 at the time. It&rsquo;s that Greg Oden thing. If you have a chance to draft a 7ft defensive anchor whose gonna pull down 12 a night and give you an efficient 20, you take it. I thinkt the disappointment with Ayton is that he doesn&rsquo;t really seem like he&rsquo;s a franchise centrepiece. He&rsquo;s only ever gonna be a second or third guy. And then you add to the fact that you could have had Luca.</p>

The late mocks with Ayton and Bagley <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> were predictions of what might happen based on rumors, not reflections of their opinions on who should go in what order. There were draft analysts like the Stepien who rightly identified that Luka was a tier above everyone else at the top of that draft and better than most #1 overall picks.</p>

Plus the coach of the team that drafted first was literally his national team coach when they won Eurobasket the year before, and the GM of the team with the second pick was a Serbian guy who knew Luka&rsquo;s dad. Not sure how much influence the Suns coach had over the pick since he was a first-year head coach and Ayton was a pretty elite hometown prospect, but people hated the Kings pick immediately</p>

<p>This is fucking key. I remember seeing comments from American sceptics, comparing Luka to Rubio, Darko. Neither of which were NEARLY as good as Luka was in Europe. Darko to Luka is like Scalabrine to LeBron. And a lot of Americans that don&rsquo;t watch euro basketball was unironically making that comparison &ldquo;what about Darko though?&rdquo;</p>

He could have been 6 inches shorter and he still would have been a surefire NBA rotation player. At 6&rsquo;8 his worst-case outcome was all-star level player. The fact that an NBA GM making millions of dollars picked Bagley over him is completely ludicrous (and I said that at the time for the record).</p>

      <label for="lk880o2" class="commentText"><p><em>I completely agree, Suns, Kings and Hawks GM&rsquo;s should have been fired immediately. Ayton and Bagley are not even that amazing as picks to not miss. It&rsquo;s not Hakeem/Jordan scenario or even Zion type of player. And in a League dominated by GSW and the 3 ball - taking a center as number 1 pick is just insane. He will almost never shoot enough 3&rsquo;s to justify his supermax slot.</em></p>

      <label for="lk7oqmm" class="commentText"><p>I just don&rsquo;t understand what wasn&rsquo;t high ceiling about a guy who at 18 years old was as dominant as he was in Europe, especially with his massive frame. Like any 6&rsquo;8 primary ballhandler who is the best player in the Euroleague as a child has an absurdly high ceiling. I&rsquo;m not even a big draft guy but it seemed obvious to me at the time that a player with that kind of skill level was worlds ahead of Ayton and Bagley both in terms of immediate impact and long term potential.</p>

      <label for="lk8hu9r" class="commentText"><p>I’m not saying there is the same amount of hype, I’m just saying that in hindsight it’s easier when the result is in hand. Ricky Rubio still was very good in the Spanish league. He was all ACB team as a 17 yr old and 18 yr old, the second most competitive league in the world. He had a silver medal and contributed at 17 yrs old on a stacked Spanish team. Before Luka this was the most decorated overseas youngster and he turned out to be a quality starter.</p>

<p>rubio couldn&rsquo;t score, like at all (we&rsquo;re talking like 3X% at the rim, and has a career FG% of 38 lmao and 50%TS) so their game are very different, for reference luka has seasons of 70+% at the rim</p>

<p>almost everything else in his game was truly elite and he was genuinely insanely talented player but what kept him at &ldquo;only&rdquo; a very good NBA player was a flaw that was NOT present at all in luka&rsquo;s game</p>

<p>well honestly its because he didnt look fast or athletic, so he was seen as a generational passing talent who might not be able to make the leap to be a scorer too in the NBA</p>

<p>and yes it was dumb in hindsight but i think people underestimate (or forget) that the &ldquo;overrated Euro&rdquo; thing has been very real in the past. like a high skilled Euro player whose game doesnt translate to the NBA in the same way</p>

<p>so i think it was totally fair for the general NBA fans and pundits to have some reservations. i think any GMs/scouts who didnt have him #1 (or tied with Ayton) are the ones who deserve criticism</p>
