      <label for="lk7lirz" class="commentText"><p>Yeah. As I remember it, Ayton was the consensus #1 pick. “David Robinson with a 3 pointer.”</p>

<p>Luka was the euro who most people said could be the best player in the draft. Everyone was concerned though, because he played in Madrid and not Tucson.</p>

<p>Bagley could jump two times in a row. Like really, really, really good.</p>

<p>JJJ had the defense and the makings of a 3 point shot. Bamba was the same, but with stretch Armstrong arms.</p>

<p>And Trae Young was the “next Steph.”</p>

<p>As a Mavs fan, I was mentally prepared to cheer for Mo Bamba and Dennis Smith Jr.</p>

      <label for="lk86ugv" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t blame anyone taking Ayton at 1 at the time. It&rsquo;s that Greg Oden thing. If you have a chance to draft a 7ft defensive anchor whose gonna pull down 12 a night and give you an efficient 20, you take it. I thinkt the disappointment with Ayton is that he doesn&rsquo;t really seem like he&rsquo;s a franchise centrepiece. He&rsquo;s only ever gonna be a second or third guy. And then you add to the fact that you could have had Luca.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>No, ppl dont realize how special Greg Oden was. Oden just was never healthy, but even the bit that he did play after missing his rookie year, he looked like he was worth the pick. Honest to god, he&rsquo;s the closest thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen to Shaq, but he was going to be a defensive version that needed to grow into his offensive game.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s analysts that maintain that had he stayed healthy he would still go #1 even with hindsight of how Durant turned out. Deandre Ayton is just an unmotivated, soft big. Coming out of college he wasn&rsquo;t even expected to be a defensive anchor, he had bad instincts on that end and got torched by Buffalo in the NCAA tournament.</p>

<p>Oden was probably a top 10ish prospect since the turn of the century.</p>

      <label for="lka65q0" class="commentText"><p>Yeah if they had the pleasure of watching Oden at OSU they’d know he was a generational level prospect. He gave two borderline hall of famers Noah and Horford 25-12 and 4 blocks in the championship game with his still recovering wrist. While there were questions to if Ayton even loved the game before he left Zona. It’s true that a lot of times GM’s just fall in love with the big guy but in Odens case it was warranted.</p>

He wasn&rsquo;t a total bust or anything but he has had a disappointing career especially as a number 1 pick in a very important draft.</p>

The late mocks with Ayton and Bagley <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> were predictions of what might happen based on rumors, not reflections of their opinions on who should go in what order. There were draft analysts like the Stepien who rightly identified that Luka was a tier above everyone else at the top of that draft and better than most #1 overall picks.</p>

Plus the coach of the team that drafted first was literally his national team coach when they won Eurobasket the year before, and the GM of the team with the second pick was a Serbian guy who knew Luka&rsquo;s dad. Not sure how much influence the Suns coach had over the pick since he was a first-year head coach and Ayton was a pretty elite hometown prospect, but people hated the Kings pick immediately</p>

<p>This is fucking key. I remember seeing comments from American sceptics, comparing Luka to Rubio, Darko. Neither of which were NEARLY as good as Luka was in Europe. Darko to Luka is like Scalabrine to LeBron. And a lot of Americans that don&rsquo;t watch euro basketball was unironically making that comparison &ldquo;what about Darko though?&rdquo;</p>

He could have been 6 inches shorter and he still would have been a surefire NBA rotation player. At 6&rsquo;8 his worst-case outcome was all-star level player. The fact that an NBA GM making millions of dollars picked Bagley over him is completely ludicrous (and I said that at the time for the record).</p>

He had a silver medal and contributed at 17 yrs old on a stacked Spanish team. Before Luka this was the most decorated overseas youngster and he turned out to be a quality starter.</p>

      <label for="lk7w9ai" class="commentText"><p>Yeah but I think the ACL stuff was well into his career. he played very well for Spain and he was still a good NBA point guard, no shame in what he accomplished. Just saying that he was playing well as a euroleague player when he was 16-19 (not on Doncic’s level but still one of the top players) and didn’t become all-world</p>

      <label for="lk82hyc" class="commentText"><p>even without going in the route of injuries (which imo has merit), bad luck and just not as insane as doncic at all at this age, the real reason for rubio&rsquo;s relative failure at the NBA level is very easily identifiable</p>

<p>rubio couldn&rsquo;t score, like at all (we&rsquo;re talking like 3X% at the rim, and has a career FG% of 38 lmao and 50%TS) so their game are very different, for reference luka has seasons of 70+% at the rim</p>

<p>almost everything else in his game was truly elite and he was genuinely insanely talented player but what kept him at &ldquo;only&rdquo; a very good NBA player was a flaw that was NOT present at all in luka&rsquo;s game</p>

      <label for="lk976yo" class="commentText"><p>Ricky Rubio would have been an All-Star at least a couple times in his career if he played in an earlier era.</p>

<p>He was a truly elite passer and playmaker, and a really good defender as well, all that transfered to the NBA level really well.</p>

<p>There are tons of point guards who were bad scorers, but good playmakers and defenders, so they managed to stick around the league for a long time and have significant success due to the fact that the league wasn&rsquo;t as offensive oriented and even solid three point shooting wasn&rsquo;t seen as a must have for a guard, like it is today.</p>

<p>Rubio started his career in the 2010s, when his glaring offensive weaknesses (which were evident when he was playing in the Euroleague as well) were a much bigger problem now, so pass first point guards slowly started going extinct.</p>

<p>He averaged 6 PPG and had a 50% TS his last season in the Euroleague before going to the NBA and shot 22% from three.</p>

<p>He averaged 4 PPG and shot a 35% TS in the second phase of the Euroleague, and 7 PPG and 49% TS in the quarter-finals series which Barcelona lost in the end.</p>

<p>His scoring and three point shooting was awful, but he was amazing at everything else, so they were banking on him figuring it out.</p>

<p>Doncic was the Euroleague MVP, the Euroleague champion, the Euroleague Final Four MVP, the Spanish league MVP and the Spanish league champion the season prior to him being drafted, as well as the EuroBasket champion with Slovenia the year prior, as the second best player on the team.</p>

<p>He achieved all this as a 19-year-old.</p>

<p>If anyone replicated Luka’s success in the European league while being 18 years old he would be undeniably the best prospect in the world.</p>

<p>Idk what revisionist history is happening now but anyone who watched Luka play knew he was the best player in the draft. I have watched (nearly) every single Mavs game since Luka’s rookie year because I knew I was watching a special all-time player. It’s like with MJ or Kobe, you wanted to watch every game you could</p>

      <label for="lka7gis" class="commentText"><p>There was elitism around American basketball so what he did in Europe was seen as just nice accolades to have. I was calling him the white LeBron to my friends sending clips in the group chat when he was like 16 so I was fully on board. But when draft time came around there were a lot of questions around his athleticism and who he would guard that ultimately turned out to be correct as well as irrelevant.</p>

<p>well honestly its because he didnt look fast or athletic, so he was seen as a generational passing talent who might not be able to make the leap to be a scorer too in the NBA</p>

<p>and yes it was dumb in hindsight but i think people underestimate (or forget) that the &ldquo;overrated Euro&rdquo; thing has been very real in the past. like a high skilled Euro player whose game doesnt translate to the NBA in the same way</p>

<p>so i think it was totally fair for the general NBA fans and pundits to have some reservations. i think any GMs/scouts who didnt have him #1 (or tied with Ayton) are the ones who deserve criticism</p>
