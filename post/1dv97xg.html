      <p>Edit: I‚Äôm aware most things are this way but meritocracy an often like a spectrum and basketball is moving farther away every year</p>

<p>An underrated part of the Bronny James discourse  i&rsquo;ve noticed is that the NBA is no longer a league of ‚Äúgetting it out the mud‚Äù that whole idea of the poor kid going to the local blacktop court to work on his game and getting his family out of a rough situation is no longer as prevalent. Most NBA prospects these days are sons of upper class parents more so than before. Half of team USA u17 team is full of NBA players&rsquo; sons.</p>

<p>Lower-income and regular-income kids can&rsquo;t compete with the kid who&rsquo;s getting pro trainers, afford to go to top AAU programs, travel around the world, go to top prestigious highschools and such. With this the talent level has gone up as this is the natural progression of all sports like hockey and baseball. Does the idea of basketball becoming a rich kids&rsquo; sport concern y&rsquo;all or is it a fair tradeoff for a better basketball product</p>

<p>It was a fortunate circumstance for America coming out of WWII where Europe/Japan were bombed to hell and needed to rebuild.  China, India, Mexico, Brazil hadn&rsquo;t developed nearly as much.</p>

<p>The US had untouched mainland, a large educated population and facilities to help countries rebuild and American workers reaped the benefits of being highly sought after.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll likely never have a middle class boom like we did post WWII.</p>

      <label for="lbmun3d" class="commentText"><p>The United States has had a super rich class its entire history; the modern day wealth disparity is not particularly out of line with that after WW1, the Gilded Age, the Antebellum, or even the Colonial period. As /u/HouseSublime noted, the post WW2 stretch is an exceptional period that has way more to do with factors outside of the US (i.e. every other industrial nation being reduced to rubble) than any kind of domestic policy.</p>

<p>This is far from a defense of the reverse Midas that was Reagan, as he fucked up&hellip;well, just about everything, but he only accelerated trends that were already in place (and not just in the US, just ask the UK about Thatcher). But our current disparity isn&rsquo;t exceptional. It&rsquo;s pretty much the norm for American history.</p>

<p>But in a physical universe like the one we exist in, i think that imbalance will always exist. There will always be a stronger, more cunning wolf. There will always be those that have more, and those that don‚Äôt have enough. There will always be a lush green valley, and a dry dusty desert.

<p>The more infrastructure there is, the less money you need to spend to engage with the sport.</p>

<p>Soccer is the most widely enjoyed game in the world, with arguably the highest level of talent relative to any sport, because of these two factors in my opinion.</p>

<p>The entry cost is extremely low. You do not have to play on a regulation soccer field, nor play with a regulation ball, to play the sport.
 At the same time, if you are any good, so many soccer clubs have youth divisions and there are a shit ton of clubs. There is more at play here, but ultimately it ends up with the clubs having an incentive to invest in young players in a way that does not exist in the US. That the burden does not fall solely on the parents meaning their financial status can&rsquo;t be used as predictor for success.</p>

<p>You still need to have a well designed and meticulously engineered car, and even then you can fall flat on your face because the simulations weren&rsquo;t correct, or you didn&rsquo;t have any more wind tunnel time to test everything you wanted. I get interested when I focus on the cars more than the drivers.</p>

      <label for="lbn7w14" class="commentText"><p>And that is why soccer is still a rich person&rsquo;s sport in North America (or it was 10-15 years ago when I was young). Assuming not much has changed&hellip;.sure there are lower level rec leagues (we called them house leagues in my area) but any club or team that actually has people scouting or takes athletic development seriously requires families to pony up the cash for every single thing.</p>

<p>Even if you are a talented player playing in the lower level rec leagues and you get scouted to play at a higher level, the conversation usually goes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey, Timmy shows a lot of promise. He should try out and play for our rep team (registration costs <span class="math inline">\(1000). Oh btw, during the offseason, we *really* recommend that Timmy attends our soccer academy/training camp (\)</span>500). That shows that he&rsquo;s really serious about playing. Oh, and every tournament that the team enters (usually one per month) will have  registration fees (and if it&rsquo;s out of town, transportation and hotel will be another cost). Make sure you have the time and money to drive your kid out to the middle of nowhere suburbs at 6pm every tuesday and thursday and at 8am every saturday and sunday!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next season rolls around:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey Timmy is showing a lot of promise. Like a lot. Did you know there is an even higher division? It&rsquo;s just a bit more expensive but it&rsquo;ll give him even more exposure, training (more expensive soccer camps) and tournaments (Which are even further away). Btw, we forgot to tell you, if Grandma wants to watch little timmy play, she&rsquo;s gonna have to pay $10 for a ticket, families only get 2 free tickets per game:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems like basketball is following a similar model. Also kinda freaky that it seems like many young NBA players nowadays are graduating from basketball academies that disguise themselves as &ldquo;specialized high schools&rdquo;. How many families would be able to say &ldquo;yeah, we&rsquo;re willing to send our 15 year old boy across the country to Florida to pursue maybe getting a scholarship in the NCAA.&rdquo;?</p>

      <label for="lbngg3d" class="commentText"><p>Even with something like tennis, which in theory should only require a racquet (which is kind of expensive but can last for years), a tennis ball, and a court, which there‚Äôs plenty of free ones around, is absurdly expensive to get to a high level. It‚Äôs more expensive to raise a pro tennis player than it is to raise a doctor, put them through undergrad, and then put them through medical school. Sports that require a ton of technique where you can‚Äôt just wow someone with your genetics are crazy expensive to get to a pro level. Like you could have lebrons genetics, but if you don‚Äôt have someone training you every day on how to hit shots right and get to play against top competition all the time you‚Äôre not going to be any good.</p>

<p>Like I was just a good high school player, and now that I‚Äôm older I realize how much money my parents spent just on that. Like if you want to get anywhere you need private lessons with an actual good coach all the time (which was like <span class="math inline">\(100 an hour minimum when I was in high school), and to basically train every day with other top players with good pros supervising which in a top group was probably like \)</span>1000 a week minimum.</p>

<p>Genetics definitely make a difference at the top where everyone is spending that much, but it takes so much money to even get there.</p>

<p>Like you can read any top pros autobiography, they either had a family member coaching and training them 7 days a week from age 8 max, or they spent a ton of money to get to a level where someone would want to train them full time, which is also absurdly expensive.</p>

      <label for="lbmmcaj" class="commentText"><p>I think what /u/Ok_Main_4202 is alluding to is that nepotism is becoming more of a broad term nowadays. Commenters above are saying that &ldquo;people coming from rich families that push them into these fields from a young age&rdquo; is nepotism. Like Steph Curry surely had advantages due to his father, intimate coaching from one of the best shooters and access to NBA courtside and camps and wealth is a huge advantage. That is on the lighter side of nepotism and is generally considered okay as has been a part of history since forever with people passing on their trades to their sons ect.</p>

<p>But then the classic definition of nepotism is someone being given a role completely unearned like Bronny being drafted, Trump doling out jobs to his Ivanka and Jared Kushner.</p>

It&rsquo;s probably easier to poach kids from Track and Baseball than it is to compete with Football. Heck football coaches would probably encourage it as a second sport in the spring with skills that translate for positions like wr, cb, and rb, the way defensive players and lineman get encouraged to do wrestling.</p>

      <label for="lblw832" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d argue that the romantic image of a young player from the inner city going from the blacktop to the NBA became virtually nonexistent the moment AAU became the chief youth pipeline for NBA-level talent. And for European players they get scouted by the clubs at a very young age and get put into their junior programs.</p>

<p>You still have the occasional hardship case like Jimmy Butler but your average NBA prospect is at worst middle class.</p>

      <label for="lbm3i9n" class="commentText"><p>The idea of pro basketball being an equalizer for lower class entry into pro sports has been a myth for 50 or 60 years. In 2011, a study in the <em>International Review for the Sociology of Sport</em> found that over the period of time reviewed (1994-2004) found that coming from lower income families vastly lowered the likelihood that a child would grow up to make the NBA, all other things being equal. The majority of NBA players even by 2004 came from middle class or higher backgrounds. As ESPN noted when reporting on it at the time, the Association hadn&rsquo;t had anything close to a working class or lower class background for a majority of players since the 1970&rsquo;s, when it was a much different situation in both how people made the pros and the degree to which playing pro ball was even a job you wanted to have as a way to get rich. Follow up work by data scientists (though not peer reviewed) seem to confirm that since the 1980&rsquo;s, the norm for an NBA player is a suburban kid whose family invests a lot in their talent at a young age (think Chris Paul), instead of a streetball hero or a trailer park sharpshooter whose talent got them into college and the pros</p>

Lavar is the same height but washed out in college after averaging Bronny numbers for bum schools. He gave his kids intense training since a young age so they were able to become NBA players. That training prolly broke their bodies, but it shows how much of a difference upbringing can make when it comes to making the league</p>

      <label for="lbm2f7x" class="commentText"><p>I agree. I would add that it&rsquo;s not just height. It&rsquo;s the genetics in general. It really common to see nowadays that elite athletes usually have one, but it&rsquo;s more and more common both parents who competed in some sport at high level.</p>

<p>If both parents are Olympian athletes, the chances that their kids could become elite athlete is much higher than from not athlete parents.</p>

<p>IIRC Lewis Hamilton had a relatively modest background and his dad had to work multiple jobs just to get him into the karting scene. Otherwise this is pretty much the norm; you&rsquo;re likely to be a second-generation professional racer or be a scion of a billionaire.</p>

      <label for="lbmihhr" class="commentText"><p>Disagree. Wealth is not the barrier to entry and it never was. It‚Äôs height. My brother is a great example.</p>

<p>My father was the Lavar Ball type and decided that my older brother was going to play professional basketball. My dad had both the money and the time to do whatever was necessary for his son to make it to the pros. This included neglecting his wife and other children in terms of time devotion.</p>

<p>Around age 5 my brother played basketball year round. He simultaneously played for his private school team and two additional AAU style travel teams. My brother was damn good. And talented.</p>

<p>He would always win the individual basketball competitions, league accolades, and he would actually get in trouble with my dad if he didn‚Äôt score 20+ ppg. He regularly had individual training sessions with former nba players (Jamal Mashburn if I remember correctly)</p>

<p>He was a stud in high school and ended up playing D1. He never got looks from blue bloods though. Wanna know why? Cuz he was 5‚Äô10 when he was done growing.</p>

<p>Right before college he played for a top national AAU team. Two of his teammates are currently in the league. And at that top AAU level, there exists an elephant in the room. The elephant is that everyone already knows who is gonna get a shot at the league and who isn‚Äôt (regardless of how they do in college)</p>

<p>I know there are exceptions of course, but most of the time..you don‚Äôt have any chance at all if you‚Äôre under 6‚Äô3. Thanks for reading my essay, folks.</p>

<p>PS: my brother played with/against ten or so guys who would eventually make it to the league. But he told me that the highest level of play he had ever seen was BY FAR Jrue Holiday. Said that he couldn‚Äôt comprehend/fathom how someone could be that good at basketball. And my brother went D1. Think about that. Holiday is a third option on any contender. There‚Äôs huge barriers to this nba league, and it ain‚Äôt money. It‚Äôs God-given talent and height genetics.</p>

      <label for="lbm4ybx" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s just the narrative sold to you by ESPN. The ex-mom that sold crack since 12 is going to get headlines, while the stable family is boring.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Contrary to popular perception, poverty and broken homes are underrepresented in the NBA, not overrepresented. For example, while 45 percent of black male children in the U.S. live in households earning no more than 150 percent of the poverty line ($22,050 for a family of four in 2010), just 34 percent of black athletes in the NBA grew up in that financial situation, according to Dubrow and Adams. Thirty percent of white American males come from below-average-income homes without two parents, but not one white NBA player had that background. Economics and family boost or drag an athlete, like in other professions.</p>

      <label for="lblwcn0" class="commentText"><p>That would be a rich man‚Äôs league if true. You could still get through college on a scholarship and pay in the EuroLeagues or something and make a lot of money (not as much as the NBA obviously but still a lot).</p>

<p>The great thing about basketball is you just need a ball and basket to play. That makes it accessible to everyone unlike something like hockey</p>

      <label for="lblyq7b" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s tough.¬† It&rsquo;s kind of impossible to avoid wealth being an advantage.¬† It&rsquo;s still better than a lot of sports and I don&rsquo;t quite think it&rsquo;ll ever be entirely dominated by the wealthy like some sports but it is trending that way some as you&rsquo;ve pointed out.</p>

<p>As for whether it concerns me, not from an impact on the NBA perspective but the more opportunities aren&rsquo;t limited by wealth the better imo.¬† It&rsquo;s a problem but there are also bigger problems.¬† So kind of, but more so in a bucket of &ldquo;this opportunity shouldn&rsquo;t be limited by wealth&rdquo; perspective than a basketball specific issue</p>

<p>This literally reads as &ldquo;oh no the black kids I considered ghetto come from loving homes or have the genetics of nba players&rdquo;</p>

<p>And basketball AAU is fucking cheap compared to travel hockey, baseball showcases, tennis or skiing. We have to stop.</p>
