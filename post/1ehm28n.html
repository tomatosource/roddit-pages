      <label for="lg2bofw" class="commentText"><p>The issue really wasn&rsquo;t that Luol was on his last legs, it was that the Lakers FO of Jim Buss and Mitch Kupchak were too stupid to realize he was no longer effective as a small forward. Deng had played well for Miami as a small ball PF, but the Lakers already had Julius Randle, and Larry Nance to play the 4, so they had no need for anyone else at the PF spot.</p>

<p>The Lakers had a huge hole at SF though, as the only player they had there was the just drafted teenage Brandon Ingram, so to fill that spot, they signed Luol Deng to be the starting SF. But Deng couldn&rsquo;t shoot well enough or move fast enough on defense to play SF, which should have been apparent to anyone who&rsquo;d watched him.</p>

<p>The Lakers figured this out after a few months of putting him there that first season though, and once they realized he couldn&rsquo;t play SF, they had two choices: either bench him (if they couldn&rsquo;t trade him, which they couldn&rsquo;t unless they attached multiple 1st round picks), or instead bench one of their very promising young players at 4 just to shoehorn Deng in there.</p>

<p>The Lakers didn&rsquo;t want to give away a bunch of 1sts or young players to unload Deng (like they did to unload Mozgov a few months later), and they didn&rsquo;t want to sideline their good young players, so they were forced to just sit Deng for the next couple years, until his contract became expiring, at which point they stretched him.</p>

<p>So the Lakers basically paid Deng $72 million to only play for a few months, and all because they didn&rsquo;t realize what position he played. It&rsquo;s one of the stupider moves by a front office ever, and it was no surprise this was a big reason why Mitch and Jim were both fired less than a year later.</p>

      <label for="lg093dw" class="commentText"><p>He was pretty damn good in Chicago. A bit ahead of his time in some ways as a switchable two-way lanky Wing who could move the ball and defend all over. That type of guy is so in Vogue nowadays. He could do a bit of everything in his prime. That guy would have absolutely been awesome in La and worth the money.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s less that he was overrated as a player and more that the Lakers were insanely stupid to pay him that much when he was clearly heading towards the back end of his career and his production was trending downwards</p>

      <label for="lg2csb8" class="commentText"><p>Agreed 100%. It&rsquo;s truly one of the worst moves I&rsquo;ve ever seen by a front office. They quite literally did not seem to know what position Deng played. They signed him because they had a hole at small forward, but the problem was Deng was decidedly a power forward by 2016. Since Deng couldn&rsquo;t play SF and the Lakers already had Julius Randle and Larry Nance Jr at PF, the Lakers just did not have a place in the rotation for him. That&rsquo;s kinda important to know before you sign a guy to a 4 year $72 million fully guaranteed contract with no options. It&rsquo;s no wonder the Lakers fired their front office less than a year later.</p>

      <label for="lg2i6rm" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, there were a lot due to the cap spike (the Blazers had a whole bunch that summer). But the Laker signings were different, IMO, because they were motivated mainly by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140427054337/http://www.latimes.com/sports/basketball/nba/lakers/la-sp-lakers-buss-family-20140420,0,1940758,full.story" target="_blank">Jim Buss having publicly put himself on a clock a couple years earlier by saying if the Lakers weren&rsquo;t back in the Conference Finals in 3 years then he&rsquo;d step down,</a> and this was the last year of those 3 years.</p>

<p>The previous couple offseasons the Lakers had a ton of cap space, but went into each offseason like they needed to sign a major star with that money (trying to go after LeBron, Melo, LaMarcus Aldridge, and then KD), and if they couldn&rsquo;t sign someone like that, then they didn&rsquo;t want to compromise their capspace for the following year by signing &ldquo;lesser&rdquo; players to long term contracts. As such, all they allowed themselves to do was offer players one year deals, so they missed out on just about everyone every year.</p>

<p>By the summer of 2016 you could tell that Jim was feeling the pressure of that timeline he&rsquo;d imposed on himself, so this time, once it was clear KD wasn&rsquo;t even going to meet with the Lakers, they instead tried to make a &ldquo;big splash&rdquo; by signing Deng and Mozgov immediately, offering them both 4 year deals. This obviously didn&rsquo;t make the Lakers contenders, and really just accelerated Jeanie Buss&rsquo;s decision to fire her brother and his GM, Mitch Kupchak. Can&rsquo;t blame her either, what choice did she have?</p>

      <label for="lg1qh1j" class="commentText"><p>I mean yeah it was year 13 by time LA decided to give him a big deal. That&rsquo;s a Lakers problem not a Lu problem.</p>

<p>Also have to keep in mind when looking at his raw stats with the Bulls, we played by far the lowest scoring games in the NBA under Thibs. He was the second most important piece of those defenses only behind Noah.</p>

He had a great career in the Bulls and came to the Heat on his last legs and performed extremely well considering his age and his role became extremely valuable at the time. The Lakers overpaid to get him over us and the rest is history. It’s not the first time the Lakers used $$$ to try and sign someone away who was washed by then</p>
