<p>So far in the 2020s, Embid has yet to have a healthy season (cause he never does lol) and Giannis has been injured for the last 2 playoffs. And now even Butler missed the playoffs due to injury. Thats your primary competition in the east mate.</p>

<p>One guy we&rsquo;ve beaten 3 times, one guy we&rsquo;ve beaten twice, and and one guy that&rsquo;s a pain in our butt, but we&rsquo;ve beaten once and would have again had he been healthy?</p>

      <label for="lhxpp51" class="commentText"><p>Is there a decade where the duo with the most wins wasn&rsquo;t also the team with the most wins? My point being that for one of the Spurs titles in the 2000s, Duncan still had Robinson and Parker wasn&rsquo;t that good yet.  The Warriors had 3 years of wins with KD, the Celtics won a title after they got Porzingis. The Heat couldn&rsquo;t win with their big 3 and needed Battier</p>

<p>Basketball has 5 players on the court per team and usually titles reflect 6-8 players.</p>

      <label for="lhxtmgg" class="commentText"><p>What you said is always true though. It doesn&rsquo;t stop people from comparing individual players nor does it stop them from comparing duos. In fact, with an added player, you&rsquo;d think comparing duos is more representative than comparing individual players because you are incorporating more of the 6-8 players that contributed.</p>

<p>Despite it being a team sport, basketball is unique in that individual players hold more weight in wins than in other sports.</p>

      <label for="lhxm46e" class="commentText"><p>More just in the scope of defining a decade. It is arbitrary, but people tend to view eras this way. Like how the 90’s was Jordan’s (even though he won playoff games in the 80’s) and to your point, how LeBron’s longevity has spanned 3 decades.</p>

<p>It’s not meant to diminish anyone, it’s quite easy to look up how many total games these duos won together. It’s just interesting to group it by decades.</p>

<p>This list is also excluding the 15 games Tatum and Brown won together in 2018 and 2019 and I’m a Celtics fan, there’s no agenda with this post.</p>

      <label for="lhxpi07" class="commentText"><p>Which is pretty representative of what we would all assume. The 80’s was all about the Celtics and Lakers, 90’s all about the Bulls, 2000’s was the Spurs and Lakers and the 2010’s was the Warriors and Lebron</p>

<p>2020’s is becoming the decade of the death of the dynasty but there’s still plenty of time for a team to emerge over the next 5-6 years to win multiple titles and take claim</p>

<p>Edit: and that’s why when you look at the catalyst of those teams with Bird, Magic, Kareem, Jordan, Duncan, Kobe, Shaq, Steph, Lebron and if you go back to the 60’s you add in Bill Russell and there’s your baseline for the top 10</p>

<p>Then when you start looking at other dominant players like Wilt, Jerry West, Oscar Robertson, Dr. J, Moses Malone, Hakeem, KD etc. and you ask yourselves was their individual greatness while still being winners enough to displace anyone in the group above and the best arguments are for guys like Wilt and Hakeem</p>

<p>And then you look at the 2020’s with guys like Giannis and Jokic or even Luka that without one of them winning multiple titles and really dominating the “decade”, it’d be hard for them to leap frog anyone with Jokic having the best argument for his individual greatness jumping into that top 15 group</p>
