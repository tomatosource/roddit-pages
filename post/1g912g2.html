      <label for="lt2mzyk" class="commentText"><p>Tyrese Haliburton has taken twice as many heaves in 4 seasons than Kevin Durant has in 16 seasons. Haliburton actually has one of the highest volume of heaves in the NBA for a star player (obviously there are others like Steph). </p>

<p>And things like this could matter in edge cases. Haliburton was barely on the edge of Third Team All NBA last season, allowing him to get the max. There are some media members who might actually have considered something like efficiency without any context as a tiebreaker, so there could have possibly been a situation heaves took his 3PT percent from 40.1 percent to 39.9 percent (luckily it didn’t since he was good in the counting stats), which might have swayed a few people and cost him big time. </p>

<p>EDIT: Also want to add that heaves did cost Steph a 50/40/90 season, so it already did have 1 instance of a historical impact </p>

      <label for="lt2of5z" class="commentText"><p>If only for vanity reasons then I agree with you.</p>

<p>But there are also cases where things like 3pt% or FG% will be clauses in your contract. Who knows how widespread that is, or how much they are for, but (especially if you are a minimum, or sub-MLE player) would you want to risk losing 100k because you threw up an unrealistic heave, that maybe has a 1-5% chance, and if you don&rsquo;t think it will effect the outcome of the game?</p>

<p>The more concrete answer to stuff like this, and controversy around award voting, is just remove these clauses from contracts and the CBA.</p>

<p>But until then, I don&rsquo;t have a problem with this change, and don&rsquo;t see how it would be controversial to just include it for the NBA season.</p>

<p>It’s just that most players are too fragile but there are actually a few who don’t care and just want to help the team. </p>

<p>Steph is all about the team. All the Warriors were once asked if you could take an underhand free throw instead of your normal form if it increased your percent by 5 percent, would you do it. Every single Warriors player said no except Steph, who was already one of the best ever FT shooters with his normal form. </p>

<p>#End of Period “Heaves”:
Certain unsuccessful end-of-period “heaves” will be adjusted from an individual player’s missed field goal attempt to a team field goal attempt when the following criteria are met: 1) the missed field goal attempt takes place within the final three seconds of the first three periods of the game, 2) the missed field goal attempt must take place from beyond the outer edge of the center circle extended (i.e., approximately 36 feet from the basket) as shown here, 3) the play must originate in the backcourt.</p>

<p>If a field goal attempt meets the above criteria, and the shot is made, then the player will be credited with a standard made field goal attempt. The team field goal attempts will not be tied to the individual player on the final box score. If a field goal attempt meets the above criteria, but the shot is blocked by a defender, the attempt will count as a team field goal attempt, and the defender will be credited with a blocked shot.  Any associated rebounds after such blocked shot will still be credited to an individual player, as needed.</p>

<p>#Expanded Coach’s Challenge:
The only called fouls and violations that will not be subject to review via a Coach’s Challenge are the following:  (i) technical fouls; (ii) unsportsmanlike acts; and (iii) flagrant fouls.  (Click here for the list of challengeable events.)</p>

<p>Each team will have two Challenges per game, regardless of the outcome of any particular Challenge. The challenging team will be charged with the timeout used to initiate a Challenges regardless of the outcome of the Challenge.  Each team will continue to have seven timeouts during regulation play, with the rules on how to initiate a Challenge remaining the same. There will be one list of reviewable matters that applies across all Coach’s Challenges.  Note that with the exception of matters related to fouls, goaltending, and continuation, the same list of reviewable matters will also apply with respect to referee-initiated instant replay review.</p>

<p>#Target Score Overtime:
Games that advance to overtime will be determined by a Final Target Score of seven (7) points.</p>

<p>For example, if the teams are tied at 100-100, the Final Target Score would be 107.  Overtime will be untimed, and games will end when a team makes a basket or free throw to reach or surpass the Final Target Score.</p>

<p>#One Free-Throw Rule:
One free throw worth one, two or three points will be awarded in the event of any foul that would typically result in one, two or three free throws being shot under standard NBA rules; will not apply during the last two minutes of the fourth quarter or the entirety of any overtime period.</p>

<p>#14-Second Reset on Advance:
The shot clock will reset to 14 seconds or will remain the same, whichever is lower, anytime the ball is advanced to the frontcourt following a reset or a team timeout.</p>

<p>#Reset Timeouts:
Each team will be entitled to a “Reset Timeout” in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter and final two minutes of any overtime period. “Reset Timeouts” do not allow teams to huddle, but otherwise mirror standard timeouts, allowing teams to advance the ball (when applicable) and make unlimited substitutions. If either team huddles or prevents the ball from immediately being put back into play, it will result in a delay of game being issued to the offending team.</p>

<p>#Transition Take Fouls:
A transition take foul occurs when a defender commits a take foul (a foul in which the defender does not make a play on the ball) against an offensive player who has the ball or has just released a pass; a foul is committed during a transition scoring opportunity; and a foul does not meet the criteria for a clear path foul. The fouled team may select any player in the game to shoot one free throw and retains the ball at the point of interruption. A player that is off the ball and is fouled in an effort to stop a transition scoring opportunity that is an obvious take foul will be considered a transition take foul.</p>

<p>Key difference from NBA rule: There is no transition take foul in the last two minutes of the fourth quarter and overtime.</p>

<p>#Replay Triggers:
The G League has five replay triggers.</p>

<p>Flagrant Fouls
Two-point/three-point field goal attempts or fouls
Made basket at the end of a period
Foul at the end of a period
Any hostile act / altercation</p>

<p>Key difference from NBA rule: There are 16 total replay triggers for NBA games.</p>

<p><strong>TARGET SCORE OVERTIME</strong></p>

<p>Games that advance to overtime will be determined by a Final Target Score of seven (7) points</p>

<p>For example, if the teams are tied at 100-100, the Final Target Score would be 107</p>

<p>Overtime will be untimed</p>

      <label for="lt2q53l" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d like a soccer style rule. You get the ball where you were fouled, defender has to back off, play resumes when you pass, dribble, or shoot. You essentially get to get a free shot, or can keep playing. It&rsquo;d be quick if the ref just gets the ball hands it to the player and blows the whistle. Also makes it always disadvantageous to foul.</p>

<p>Any non-shooting foul in the bonus is one free throw plus retained possession</p>

<p>Turn the &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; into a true bonus and treat it like a defensive 3 second violation where you get a freebie free throw with side out after that.</p>

      <label for="lt2owmw" class="commentText"><p>That rule already exists in the G League. It’s not new and has been around several years. There was actually a detailed post about this for Scoot Henderson in the draft sub describing this rule which found that this rule bumped Scoot’s G League TS percentage a non-trivial amount, making it look like he was more efficient than he was.  </p>

<p>At the time, I thought it was an interesting post highlighting some artificial bump to Scoot’s G League stats but unfortunately since Scoot was so beloved by the sub pre-draft, comments were just saying how it’s useless info and how it didn’t matter since Scoot was the clear cut second pick. </p>

      <label for="lt4j5n0" class="commentText"><p>That ft rule is really interesting.

It should help make the viewing experience much better.</p>
