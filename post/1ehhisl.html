<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;God has blessed me with an amazing journey, one that has taken turns I couldn&rsquo;t have expected or dreamed of as a kid in Brownsburg, Indiana.</p>

<p>Today, I am officially retiring from the game of basketball. It&rsquo;s been an incredible ride and I&rsquo;m so grateful to everyone who helped me achieve more than I ever imagined.</p>

<p>From a young age, my favorite bible verse has always been: &ldquo;I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me&rdquo; - Phillipians 4:13.</p>

<p>I want to thank God for giving me the grace and privilege to play this game and allowing me to bring my best each and every day.</p>

<p>To all my coaches, teammates, trainers, doctors, friends, and family - there are too many people to name in this short post, but you supported me through countless years and cities, helping me exceed my own expectations.</p>

<p>A special shout out to my mom and dad - my biggest fans - always cheering me on with unwavering support; my agent, Mark Bartelstein - the best in the business, a pillar of sanity through countless phone calls before and after games; my kids Bernie, Charlie, Nora, and GT - you have been my inspiration, encouraging me to keep playing even when I could have been at home with you; and the biggest and most important thank you to my wife, Robyn - without you I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;d be. You embody all these roles and so much more!</p>

<p>To all my fans: thank you for supporting me through the ups and downs. I&rsquo;ll always cherish the letters of encouragement and the moments we&rsquo;ve shared around the world. You inspired me to always dream big and improve everyday - and for the young players up next, I challenge you to do the same!</p>

<p>As I move to spend more time with my family as a father and husband, I look forward to new adventures and challenges, taking with me the lessons I&rsquo;ve learned on the court that will guide me across my next chapters, both in business and in life.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for what&rsquo;s next!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll always wonder what our team would have been like if he had stayed. I don&rsquo;t know that Mitchell gets the playing time he got if Hayward is still there, but there&rsquo;s also the possibility he really could have moved the needle for us.</p>
