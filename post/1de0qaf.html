      <label for="l892fj8" class="commentText"><p>Vini is an absolute spazz on the field though; and I think it‚Äôs fair to call him a knob if you are going to call Neymar one. It‚Äôs just not a reasonable reaction yo be racist because of it - which is how plenty of Spanish people react to the shit attitude he has.</p>

<p>Neymar is like a million times more professional in-game and does almost nothing but embellishment.</p>

<p>And if you mean ‚Äúreact‚Äù as in play well - then it‚Äôs just a matter of you not watching these fellas play - because Neymar was absolutely incredible everywhere he played.</p>

<p>As a Brazilian who is old enough to have watched dudes like Nazario before the injury, Romario, Ronaldinho, Kaka etc, Neymar is probably the most gifted of them all and the ‚Äúbest‚Äù player when he‚Äôs having a good game outside of Nazario, who was as close to unplayable as it gets.</p>

      <label for="l89ae4f" class="commentText"><p>Uh oh, buddy. You‚Äôve triggered my trap card.</p>

<p>Neymar is more talented. This is like my go-to unpopular opinion for non-Brazilians since most of us can acknowledge what I‚Äôm gonna say.</p>

<p>Not unlike anybody else at the time - especially people playing - Ronaldinho is literally my favourite Brazilian player ever. I genuinely don‚Äôt like Neymar. It‚Äôs not that uncommon of an opinion - the fella who he is speaking basically says the same shit. He is a petulant little dork as far as I‚Äôm concerned. Ronaldinho on the other hand is just likeable.</p>

<p>With that being said, Neymar is more gifted. Almost has no weaknesses offensively aside from his slight frame.</p>

<p>Fast, insanely good with both feet - dribble, pass and shoot with his left - which is absurdly rare to be able to do all 3. He is maybe the best dribbler of all-time if you consider difficulty in skills or flair. His touch is equally as good if not better than Ronaldinho‚Äôs. He has a way better sense for when to release the ball. His vision and final pass when he‚Äôs in the middle of dribbling through players is genuinely insane. Like Pistol Pete shit.</p>

<p>He is one of the most talented players who has ever played.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs while completely ignoring how much more effective he is and has been for his teams. He‚Äôs a statistical freak, where Ronaldinho was more of a showman who excelled in moments. And even if you want to think of Ronaldinho as more of a winner, you‚Äôre just presuming he was because of the World Cup - in which he was, at best, the 4th best player for us at that tournament. Rivaldo, Ronaldo, Gilberto Silva were all better. I‚Äôd probably put Roberto Carlos above him too.</p>

<p>Neymar is genuinely one of the biggest victims of social media sports. Which they, once again, touch on here. He is so much better than a lot of people think because there is some sort of narrative that exists all over the world with people who hardly watched him play about him being a few levels below what he actually is/was.</p>

<p>He is by all accounts a generational talent and gets almost no credit for it unless you actually watched him play. It would be a shame if he wasn‚Äôt so annoying as a person.</p>

      <label for="l89h3iq" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d say Neymar was possibly the greatest dribbler of all time if you give a great emphasis to the flair aspect - though through that lense Ronaldinho might edge him - but if you just consider effectiveness it has to be Messi. He&rsquo;d turn modern defenses completely upside down just using body feints while sprinting, no one ever came remotely close and that allowed him to do truly unique things in tighter spaces.</p>

<p>I do agree with the bulk of your post though. Neymar might be the most underrated guy I&rsquo;ve seen at this point, sure his talent was probably even greater than the career he got but his career was way better than people give him credit to and it has to do with all the aspects you&rsquo;ve outlined. Also doesn&rsquo;t help that his very best seasons were probably the first 2 at PSG, and people mostly just didn&rsquo;t watch.</p>

<p>I think if you want to add flair into the conversation, Ney is the guy. Above Ronaldinho for sure - I am pretty good at dribbling myself and just the creativity and complexity of the shit Neymar does is next level.</p>

<p>I also think Robinho on his day was an incredible dribbler. Maybe the most ‚Äúreactive‚Äù vs proactive of the 3 in the sense that he was making shit up on the fly half of the time, and when it worked, he would put dudes on skates and might have been the most almost ‚ÄúKyrie-like‚Äù I guess.</p>

<p>And yeah, Robinho was incredibly creative with it too. Den√≠lson was also a mental dribbler, though maybe a bit less flairy than those 3</p>

      <label for="l89ix92" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d put him above Ronaldinho, but you are right that Neymar is weirdly underrated by the footballing world. To use an r/nba appropriate analogy: imagine if LeBron, who came into the league with &ldquo;greatest of all time&rdquo; expectations, ended up &ldquo;only&rdquo; making 2 or 3 NBA Finals (maybe with a ring as a 2nd option somewhere), a few All-NBA teams, finished 2nd in MVP voting once or twice, and became like a top 15 leading scorer all-time. Still a great player, but god damn, what could have been?</p>

<p>Neymar is much the same. At 17, people were convinced he was gonna be the next Pel√©, and anything that wasn&rsquo;t that would be considered a letdown. Ultimately, while his resum√© speaks for itself ‚Äî 9 league titles, 1 Champions League, 1 Libertadores, 1 Olympic gold medal, 2 top 3 Ballon d&rsquo;Or finishes, Brazil&rsquo;s all-time leading scorer, etc. ‚Äî Neymar will always be one of the biggest examples of &ldquo;perception ‚â† reality&rdquo;: forever a disappointment for what he wasn&rsquo;t, rather than lauded as the generational great player that he was/still is.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really unfort that his personal skill level couldn&rsquo;t elevate BR team success just bc the expectations were World Cup win (esp in 2014, also an insane expectation). TBH a lot of the fault there falls on Brazil coaching, management, and youth systems</p>

<p>Not entirely sure I agree with that comp. As good as he was, Neymar was never quite at the level of Messi and Ronaldo (there&rsquo;s a reason why Griezmann has as many 3rd place finishes as him). Either way, my thing was more in terms of comparing the media expectations guys like Neymar had, and how ultimately not achieving those expectations fueled the way he&rsquo;s perceived now, despite the fact that he&rsquo;s inarguably a Top 5 player of the 2010s.</p>

<p>Brazil just hasn&rsquo;t had the attacking talent (and has awful coaching talent to boot), along with the insane pressure of being the face of the most successful intl football side in history, I dont think it&rsquo;s fair to make the comp to the NBA.</p>

<p>He gets lots of credit for his talents, he gets criticized for not delivering with them for either PSG or Brazil. At Barca he was great, but he was a cog in Messi&rsquo;s wheel.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re as talented as Neymar is, and you&rsquo;ve delivered as little trophy wise without the best player of all time playing beside you, there are clearly issues that exist. Neymar&rsquo;s off the field issues (being an irredeemable bell end) clearly make a huge impact when he&rsquo;s not orbiting someone else&rsquo;s star.</p>

I think he stands out as very talented because his peers were not as good as him. I think both Ronaldinho and Ronaldinho Ga√∫cho were more impactful and successful players and in a more talented squad- and used theirs skills when it counted the most.</p>

<p>But I can see your point if you think of talents as dribbling, passing,stats,  etc without the achievements. Still, I would pick either Ronaldinho over Neymar to have on my team personally&hellip;</p>

      <label for="l89l9vq" class="commentText"><p>Just objectively speaking, he‚Äôs 1 or 2 for me and the argument is with Nazario.</p>

<p>Ronaldinho was absolutely not as effective for Brazil as Neymar. Nowhere close. Neymar has always been very, very good for Brazil. Ronaldinho was never as impactful.</p>

<p>Dinho was probably at his best in the copa when he was a kid. In 2002, while influential with the winner against England, he was probably the 5th or 4th best player overall. In 2006, he was just bad. He was so bad that he didn‚Äôt win the ballon dor despite having his best season in club football. And that season, 2006 is his most ‚Äúimpactful‚Äù for Barce. Weigh that up against any of Neymar‚Äôs top 5 seasons and he‚Äôll fall well short statistically, and I bet if you go back and watch games, you‚Äôll see Neymar is playing with just as much flair as Dinho ever did. He was Barcelona‚Äôs second best player during MSN - ahead of fucking Suarez in his prime and only behind the best player who has ever played. And there were games where it looked close.</p>

<p>Ronaldinho might be behind Robinho in terms of pure flair as well btw. Robinho on his day was magic.</p>

<p>Ronaldinho has the benefit of the unique gait and the watchability of his sort of footvolley style with the ball and take downs - it makes anything he does have that much more appeal. Really similar to Zidane and his reputation.</p>

<p>One thing I will say is that if you play, trying to match what you‚Äôre watching with difficulty to do, Ney is in Messi and Nazario tier - a tier Ronaldinho absolutely never reached because he simply couldn‚Äôt carry the ball at speed, with the same consistency, and end product as the other guys.</p>

      <label for="l89fcrb" class="commentText"><p>Vini Jr is not the example you want to make these comparisons tbh. Yes I understand that he has been a victim of racism multiple times in his short career but he really doesn‚Äôt do himself any favors with his shit attitude on the field and his arrogance towards others.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not saying he deserves the racist remarks, don‚Äôt get it twisted, all I‚Äôm saying is he makes himself a target with the stuff he‚Äôs done to other players and fans. (Example, air humping towards fans when he scores, mocking other players, pretending to hand someone the ball and when they reach out throws it away from them, arguing with opposing coaches, and omg how much he whines to referees when something doesn‚Äôt go his way)</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs be honest, we‚Äôve all played against ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù  like I just described above, it‚Äôs not fun.</p>

<p>Say what you want about Neymar but he has handled the criticism 1000% better than Vini has.</p>

<p>All his antics and arrogance has been seen by plenty of other players. He is just good enough to back it up. None of his actions should ever make him a target.</p>

      <label for="l89n3e8" class="commentText"><p>It‚Äôs probably not the best way to word it but I‚Äôm a realist and it‚Äôs the hard truth. We can‚Äôt sit here and act like he‚Äôs innocent and an angel.</p>

<p>Obviously the whole racism aspect of the insults are wrong and should not exist but look at Real Madrid‚Äôs team, about 90% of them are black.</p>

<p>Why is Vini the only one who gets insults? Why not Bellingham? Why not Rudiger? Why not Tchouameni or Camavinga?</p>

<p>They‚Äôre not out here mocking other fans, players, coaches, crying to refs, etc. Which is why I said he puts a target on his back with his actions. Others don‚Äôt put that target on their back because they‚Äôre being more professional, respectful of opponents, not humping the air towards rival fans, not going up to players from smaller teams, kissing the Real Madrid badge and telling them basically that he play‚Äôs for a better team so they should stfu, etc.</p>

<p>I mean even Ancelotti the coach seems like he‚Äôs done with Vini‚Äôs bs sometimes, look at this clip. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@passiopelfutbol_/video/7295046789961501984?_t=8n8fp1dAesh&amp;_r=1" target="_blank">https://www.tiktok.com/@passiopelfutbol_/video/7295046789961501984?_t=8n8fp1dAesh&amp;_r=1</a></p>

<p>Let‚Äôs use Kyrie as an example, if he wouldn‚Äôt have flipped off Boston fans, stomped on lucky and talked shit about Boston, he wouldn‚Äôt be getting all these insults right now. That‚Äôs what I mean by not putting a target on your back.</p>

He&rsquo;s also a guarantee worth your price of admission. He&rsquo;s awesome, and I love watching him even though I always want him to lose.</p>

<p>Newmar is supposedly unprofessional off the field. More like Luka Doncic.</p>

<p>I mean there have been points where even Ancelotti, his own coach can‚Äôt stand him anymore. There‚Äôs a clip of Vini being subbed out and just taking all the time in the world, mocking opposing fans, just being a little shit that eventually Ancelotti grabs his arm and starts pulling him to the bench and telling him to stfu.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@passiopelfutbol_/video/7295046789961501984?_t=8n8fp1dAesh&amp;_r=1" target="_blank">https://www.tiktok.com/@passiopelfutbol_/video/7295046789961501984?_t=8n8fp1dAesh&amp;_r=1</a></p>

<p>A clip so you can see, in what other professional sport does the coach need to go grab a grown man like that because he‚Äôs acting like a spoiled brat? Vini is special.</p>

<p>Even if one decided to take away all of Pep&rsquo;s success in City, he still has the Barca and Bayern years. That repeated level of success and consistency is unprecedented.</p>

      <label for="l89171w" class="commentText"><p>Except the charges aren&rsquo;t all prior to his time there. If you erase all the trophies at city, Mourinho has won leagues as recently as he has. And since we are well aware City is financially doping, it&rsquo;s irrelevant how much Man Utd or any other actual big club spent within the rules. Pep might be the greatest coach on the planet but it doesn&rsquo;t count if there is cheating involved. Not every player and coach for the Houston Astros needed to be directly complicit for the trophy to be invalid</p>

      <label for="l89t55y" class="commentText"><p>As a Man United fan, the 115 charges conversation is so tiring. Ignoring the accounting behind the scenes, City spent their money incredibly well, other teams didn&rsquo;t for the most part. And Pep makes players better, simple as. Who on earth would&rsquo;ve thought John Stones would&rsquo;ve been able to perform at an elite level has a holding midfielder.</p>

<p>Winning the league 4 years on the bounce is an insane feat, way way more impressive that Madrid winning several CLs. Being the best over 38 games is so much more difficult than just winning a tournament.</p>

<p>Even if they get their titles stripped, which feels a bit ridiculous of a punishment, they&rsquo;ve still been the best team in England (if not the world) for the last 5+ years. And that&rsquo;s because of Pep&rsquo;s genius + elite recruitment.</p>

<p>All that being said, I hate City lol</p>

      <label for="l894z06" class="commentText"><p>It actually is completely relevant how much other teams are spending because the rules are pretty arbitrary.</p>

<p>City is accused of financial doping but they financially doped to spend significantly  less money than United, Arsenal, and Chelsea?</p>

<p>How does that work? Ah yes, because the FFP rules (which weren‚Äôt created until 2009, after United because the club it is today lol) dictate the rate at which you are allowed to spend money making it basically impossible for poor clubs to ever be able to catch up to United/Liverpool/Chelsea/Arsenal in spending without winning multiple titles, something extremely hard to do when you aren‚Äôt allowed to spend even a fraction of the cash as the old guard.</p>

<p>If you want a league with no cap then have a league with no cap. Having a league that allows Chelsea to spend over a billion dollars in about a year while the bottom third of the table isn‚Äôt allowed to under FFP even if they had the cash is just silly.</p>

      <label for="l894bot" class="commentText"><p>There‚Äôs no asterisks with the players or play on the field.</p>

<p>City don‚Äôt spend the most, and while they have an extremely strong squad, it‚Äôs not like they have a collection of literally the best players in the world.</p>

<p>They also aren‚Äôt accused of match fixing, bribing refs, or anything regarding play or matches.</p>

<p>They are accused of‚Ä¶. lying about how many advertising funds they received for several years to get around Englands fairly arbitrary financial rules (which aren‚Äôt a cap btw). Rules that, if we‚Äôre being honest, primarily just prevent anyone but the old guard from being able to spend lots of cash under the guise of protecting clubs from overextending and possibly going out of business.</p>

<p>You‚Äôll notice 90% of fans crying that it‚Äôs the greatest cheating scandal of all time are fans of the big clubs (Arsenal, United, Liverpool). You don‚Äôt see Leiscester fans complaining even though they won a PL title and ended up relegated a few years later.</p>

<p>It WOULD be the greatest cheating scandal of all time if the PL had anything resembling a salary cap, but the minute you allow some teams like Chelsea to spend a billion dollars in a year and then deduct Everton points because they didn‚Äôt follow the rules to the letter while spending a fraction as much it‚Äôs pretty silly.</p>

<p>Btw, Liverpool and United have both been found guilty of match fixing in the past. And United under SAF as well as Barcelona have both had big red bribery scandals.</p>

<p>So idk, it seems pretty silly to me.</p>

<p>Pep also had proved himself as one of the GOATs before coming to City already with his wins at both Barcelona and Bayern.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From giving Pep&rsquo;s brother a LA Liga team</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What? Pere has been one of the most successful agents in the sport since like 2009. He bought into Girona himself in 2017, no one gave it to him, and he had a huge 35% share and had been involved in the clubs operations before City Group got involved. They were not a LaLiga team at the time.</p>

<p>Once City Group became involved he negotiated with them to sell his share in order to become Chairman. Since taking over he has led them to a promotion to LaLiga. How is this cheating?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>secret payments to Mancini.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Allegedly. There‚Äôs been literally no proof, just Daily Mail accusations. I love that people actually believe we would‚Äôve fucking paid Mancini crazy amounts of secret money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can&rsquo;t honestly think they only spend what has been officially submitted. Everything City does is sus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on? I hear this all the time, as if any redditor has ANY insight whatsoever into football financials at all. Everything is sus is a feeling, not a fact. What is sus exactly? As stupid as it was, the PL allowed a team to be bought by a fucking country, and yeah, that country comes with a fuck ton of wealth.</p>

<p>And then that country spent some of its fuck ton of wealth on the team it just bought? Color me shocked!!</p>

<p>Mate, you can be upset about City‚Äôs ownership, the sportswashing, the human rights abuses, the fact that another country owns a goddamn English football team.</p>

<p>But don‚Äôt pretend for one second you know shit about what FFP/PSR rules may or may not have been broken rofl.</p>

<p>Once the case goes to trial let‚Äôs see. If the PL has damning evidence I‚Äôll agree with you that there was financial doping.</p>

<p>I still don‚Äôt think the financial doping is anywhere near the scale of match fixing and bribing refs, but to each his own.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most teams are screaming at you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, if your only sources for info are r/soccer and the Daily Mail.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Leicester is facing their own spending problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That‚Äôs my point. They did the insane, winning a PL title against literally all odds, and it did nothing to help them financially. Players got poached by the bigger clubs allowed to spend more, Leicester couldn‚Äôt replace but extended themselves as much as they could, then couldn‚Äôt compete in the league, and now it‚Äôs left them with financial issues.</p>

<p>You can‚Äôt possibly pretend the PL is a fair league. If it was the FFP would‚Äôve been created to create parity. Thats literally why they changed the name to PSR (Profit and Sustainability Rules), because Financial Fair Play didn‚Äôt describe what the rules did at all.</p>

<p>Now I‚Äôm not saying the PSR is inherently bad, but it‚Äôs difficult to argue it didn‚Äôt have the consequence of making it almost impossible for teams who aren‚Äôt already super wealthy to be allowed to spend money, even IF they got wealthy owners. Tying spending limits directly to revenue and basically not at all to wealth is extremely silly.</p>

<p>If the PL was even pretending to be fair they would have included a salary cap and/or rules to allow teams to be able to spend above certain sustainability provisions depending on owners wealth.</p>

<p>A salary cap cant work unless you get rid of relegation, which would certainly be opposed by the likes of Leicester fans and be bad for the sport. In Europe, the top teams dominate for decades, but smaller teams also get their time near the top. In the US, the top teams dont dominate so much, but small teams dont get a chance to exist at all.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s based on the luck of having success at the right time - in the 90s when the top English clubs broke away from the football league to broker a multi-millionaire deal with Sky - plus having a &lsquo;good&rsquo; location. No one would apply that logic for the NBA too. If you had a similar system there the Lakers and the Knicks would match in the finals every single year, as every top player would just flock there.</p>
