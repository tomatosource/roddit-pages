</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>These 3 played in the same era. So we cannot use &ldquo;they played in different eras&rdquo; argument.</p>

<p>They all played in 80s to 90s. With their primes intersected in the 90s.</p>

<p>But who is the best player among the three?</p>

<p>Especialy for those who live thru their era, and have more sample of eye test. Who is the best player among the three?</p>

<p>David has 2 Championships and 1 MVP. Chuck had 1 MVP and an amazing Finals Run in 1993. (Just lost to MJ).</p>

<p>Karl is probably the most successful with 2 MVPs and 2 Great Utah Jazz Finals Run. (Just lost twice to MJ)</p>

<p>But in terms of pure basketball talent and production, who is the best player among the 3?</p>

<p>Please Present your argument and objective reasons why.🙂</p>

<p>He&rsquo;d been all over the league with some really bad teams by that time and it often felt correct.</p>

      <label for="lill7gh" class="commentText"><p>His 21 game stint with Denver in ‘90 was the only bad team he played on until the terrible 1996-1997 Spurs. He got spot minutes for a 41-41 Sonics team his second year, and played a handful of games for a 42-40 Houston team. I see a lot of people say he actually sucked and was just a benefactor of David Robinson, Pop, and Duncan, but he started for the Warriors in ‘93 and they won 50 games. I always liked Avery for some reason idk.</p>

      <label for="limqqvq" class="commentText"><p>Robinson might very well have been the best of the 3 in a modern context for the reasons you cite: probably could have developed a good enough shot to be a stretch(y) 5, and he would have been highly switchable. Additionally, he wouldn&rsquo;t have to match up again some of the post big who could abuse him (like Hakeem).</p>

<p>I think Barkley in the modern context would roughly be like Zion, but with a better mid-range game and waaaaay better at rebounding</p>

<p>The Mailman would have had the biggest drop-off changing contexts into the modern game. Who knows how his handle and shooting (and passing) would have developed if he came up in the modern game. It would definitely need to for him to be a plus player. But he would really struggle in PNR coverage.</p>

<p>Robinson and Shaq were almost polar opposites when it came to playing style. Robinson played mostly facing the basket and relied on quickness. Which is strange considering how crazy strong he was. I always wondered why he didn&rsquo;t play in the post more. Shaq scored almost exclusively in the post.</p>

<p>Robinson&rsquo;s first appearance on an all-NBA team was the 89-90 season.  His last was the 2000-01 season.</p>

<li><p>Are you calling 5 seasons of ~15ppg part of his prime? Certainly not. His prime was probably 6-7 years and he was awesome during it. He didn&rsquo;t had bad longevity especially considering he lost a bunch of years due to military service.</p></li>

<li><p>if he was 11+ years of 1st and 2nd team all NBA then sure we could say it was simply Olajuwons greatness holdin back his awards, but by that statistic he&rsquo;s just not keeping up with Malone&rsquo;s 11-14 year prime</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For the record I love Drob, he would probably by on my personal all-favorites. He and I share bdays. There&rsquo;s not many players in the NBA that match his dual threat. But Karl was so ridiculously consistently excellent for so long.</p>

<li>Why is PPG the only stat that matters?  And which 5 seasons are you referring to?  18ppg isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;~15ppg&rdquo;.  Further, there&rsquo;s a reason his scoring dipped&hellip;..Tim Duncan joined the Spurs.</li>
<li>There was also a guy named Shaq.  Ever heard of him?</li>
</ol>

<p>It&rsquo;s undeniable that Robinson&rsquo;s peak was higher than Malone&rsquo;s.  So the question becomes, would you rather have Robinson&rsquo;s clearly higher peak or a few extra years of Malone&rsquo;s prime?</p>

<p>Thanks in agreeing that centers where the better and more important players in that era.</p>

<p>Yeah I don&rsquo;t care much about Malone&rsquo;s 2 MVPs which bolster those numbers, he shouldn&rsquo;t have won any of those. Robinson&rsquo;s MVP season is much better than either of those.</p>

      <label for="lil67tv" class="commentText"><p>Yes about being regarded the best PF. But those takes were bad and made by talking heads on TV that mainly just looked at points and rebounds combined and made conclusions. At that time folks on TV also didn&rsquo;t understand how the game changed between regular season and playoffs (somewhat they still don&rsquo;t get it). So they got confused when Jazz would flame out. While Barkley would still function at an elite level on offense in the playoffs and he would do it without sharing nearly all of his minutes with a top 10 all time PG feeding him.</p>

<p>All 3 were great offensive players and rebounders and Malone and Barkley are slightly better in that regard, but neither of them was really even a plus defender, much less a great defensive anchor. Robinson won Defensive player of the year while Hakeem and Mutombo were playing, he was a real difference maker on both ends.</p>

<p>I think it’s totally reasonable to pick the Admiral over the other two. I’m biased as a Jazz fan who watched Stockton and Malone all through my formative years (and didn’t know what a piece of shit Malone is personally until much later in life), so I still think Malone is the pick over the course of a whole career. Chuck was so entertaining to watch, but I think DRob and the Mailman are on a different level.</p>

I don&rsquo;t even think it&rsquo;s close, and I&rsquo;m not even going to refer to stats (although I suggest people look at them): this was the one guy of the three who could lead a break, finish it, back somebody into the stanchion, or drive by them. Malone could shoot really well and had the conditioning to roll, pop, cut, or run the floor all game; just not a guy who warped (or even stretched) a half-court d because he couldn&rsquo;t  dribble very well or jump very well without a head of steam. Robinson was a vertical threat who [edit: &ldquo;could&rdquo;] shoot and face up pretty well (and was obviously more impactful on D).</p>

If you watched them, He was the biggest physical freak and MORE IMPORTANTLY he abused Karl Malone in head-to-head competition.</p>

<p>David Robinson did not have a star peer that didn’t own him either.</p>

<p>The “eye test” matters.</p>

<p>I hate Malone.   For what he did to Zeke and for being a muscle bound wuss in the Olympics.  That was long before i knew the biggest reason he was a trash human.</p>

He&rsquo;s short, fat, can&rsquo;t jump, has a terrible attitude, and is the best basketball player I have ever seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To me I would draft Chuck without a doubt if I could pick any of the 3, and I would fucking win rings in 2024+ with a guy with his talents from 20 rbs per game and 30 chicken nuggets of dunks and putbacks from a guy stronger than anyone but Zion.</p>

<p>Chuck was the Zion that worked out&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say Malone and Robinson are probably tied in their respective roles. Hell, all these guys are probably tied in their respective roles lol. All three were incredibly dominant at their peaks.</p>

<p>Some peaked for slightly less or whatever, but I don&rsquo;t really rate any of these guys better than the other. Dream Team was absolutely loaded.</p>

      <label for="liks9pk" class="commentText"><p>David Robinson&rsquo;s offensive game makes him uniquely versatile to pair with other offensive stars. He was very quick to start a face-up attack in the post so he didn&rsquo;t really dominate possessions. His shooting also made him a legit mid-range catch and shoot threat and often times Hakeem or Mutumbo would be drawn out to him, opening up the rim for teammates. Being able to shoot allowed for pick and pop, where he was excellent at making entry passes for teammates ducking in or cutting.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re unlikely to win with 1 star alone, so I tend to weigh the pair-ability factor higher when judging stars.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, y&rsquo;all can troll me about Heat Culture being nothing special but Pat Riley has me drinking the Kool-Aid. Leadership, work ethic and moral character are not easy to come by and having a role model set the tone in the locker room who is also a star isn&rsquo;t <em>necessary</em> for winning but it sure helps.</p>

<p>David Robinson was the only true 2-way player of the three noted.</p>

<p>All 3 players were great on offense. Especially when they played as the first option on their teams.</p>

<p>Robinson was physically well ahead of his time, and extremely disciplined.</p>

<p>Chuck played no defense outside of trying to stat pad defensive boards.</p>

<p>Malone was better than Barkley on D, but nothing like D-Rob.</p>

      <label for="lik4yqy" class="commentText"><p>Robinson was the greatest floor raiser&hellip;a team with him there was automatically around 50 wins. Both the team before his arrival and a year he missed (Duncan!) were garbage. One of the original great lob finishers, got way above the rim. I think he&rsquo;s a bit below olajuwon, but there&rsquo;s a non-crazy argument he was better (I don&rsquo;t give a shit who wins one-v-one). Got a great teammate that would seem to be entirely redundant with him, and immediately figured out how to make it work.</p>

<p>Barkley joined a few good teams and was on some bad ones that he couldn&rsquo;t bring up. Defense wasn&rsquo;t great, not surprising for a 6&rsquo;5&rdquo; forward.</p>

<p>Malone&rsquo;s a tough one. Utah was decent, added Malone and Stockton and were at worst fringe contenders forever. Defense was very good, though the jazz always had a paint protector out there (eaton was a beast in particular).</p>

      <label for="likjjk5" class="commentText"><p>As much as how dominant Barkley was as a 6’4 power forward. He was a bad defender and didn’t focus on basketball, got out of shape later in his career when he went to Houston and Karl Malone was a great scorer but more of a black hole who’s game didn’t translate well in the post season and many times where he choked that in one series the GM wanted to bench him. I lean towards Robinson because he’s better all around player, I’m not valuing team success but he just wasn’t surrounded with the right pieces pre Duncan. 2nd best players were Sean Elliot and he had Terry Cummings who was injured, trading away Strickland was a mistake.</p>

<p>I would love to see David Robinson play in today&rsquo;s league. It&rsquo;s interesting with these conversations, because we always think about how they would adapt if we just dropped them in their prime into the league. However, as a fun hypothetical - what if he was a kid growing up with the same work ethic and discipline, with today&rsquo;s gameplay.</p>

<p>I think he&rsquo;d be more successful today than the 90&rsquo;s version of himself.</p>

<p>Career though probably Malone. He won 19 playoff series which is absolutely insane for someone that never won a championship. If I had to guess that he probably holds that record. I also think he did more for Stockton’s career than vice versa.</p>

<p>Barkley is 3rd in both career and peak imo</p>

      <label for="likm2g6" class="commentText"><p>I watched all 3 in their primes and it was great — I was a fan of Barkley and Robinson and have always hated Malone so I’m pretty biased. Of the 3, Barkley was a leader and could control the game in the crunch. He was even a leader on a stacked Dream Team, his peak was just fun to watch. I was a huge Robinson fan and was shocked when Hakeem destroyed him in his MVP year so I’d have him behind Barkley. It’s weird to say but I think of Malone as the ultimate role player, never felt like a leader despite the stats. Plus everything you hear about the guy shows what kind of garbage human being he is.</p>

      <label for="lil0s1z" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m gonna focus on who was the very best at their very best vs. sustained peak or integrating counting stats over time. Blah blah have watched all of these guys live, etc.</p>

<p>Malone&rsquo;s # 3.  Main strengths were that he was big/strong, pretty fast, and a good shooter. Got a lot of buckets running the floor, in pick/roll or pick/pop, and off pull-ups. Could body up guys in the post well as a defender (with quick hands on swipes), and a fine rebounder. But lacked burst/length, and neither a vertical threat nor really a scary finisher.</p>

<p>Barkley&rsquo;s # 2. Barkley&rsquo;s shorter than Malone &amp; not the same shooter.  But extremely fast, explosive and strong: devastating in transition, could put your ass under the basket and dunk on you, or beat you cleanly off the drive and dunk on your center.  Also had more varied/effective post-moves, could handle the ball fine on the perimeter or in transition (better passer than Malone), and was easily the best offensive rebounder in the game. The short of it to me is that creating (and finishing) a lot of those high-percentage shots is just more valuable than being excellent at mid-range jumpers. Malone&rsquo;s better guarding the post, Barkley&rsquo;s better on the weak side; neither&rsquo;s a defensive anchor.</p>

<p>Robinson&rsquo;s # 1. Good shooter, tall, very fast/athletic; attacked well off face-ups, could work in the mid-post (turn-arounds, pull-ups, etc.). And defensive value that clearly exceeds the other two.</p>

<p>ETA: Barkley is much closer to Robinson than Malone, in my book. Scoring at the rim is probably the most important offensive attribute, and Sixers Barkley looks like Shaq or Giannis in terms of scoring a lot of points and lapping the league in FG% on 2PA. But rim protection is easily the most important defensive attribute, and if you happen to be incredible at it and while also being really, really good at offense, well, that&rsquo;s tough to top.</p>

      <label for="likg7fl" class="commentText"><p>The Admiral came into the league late and had help from Timmy later. He had other talent around him. Wouldn&rsquo;t underestimate them, what&rsquo;s common nowadays.</p>

<p>Barkley had s good team too. Good mix, chemistry, great shooters for that time. He was undersized but did with the little he had the most. However it was awfully to watch his latter, back to basket years. Ass out and getting into the zone in 5 minutes each time. Awful to watch but before that phase of his career he&rsquo;d be my pick for #1 here.</p>

<p>Malone had Stockton, Hornacek and others throughout his career. David was talk, lean, muscular. Malone was bulkier. These times there were quiet some juiced up guys in the league. Besides his longevity and success, solely as player, I&rsquo;d rank him below the other too. As human anyway.</p>

<p>Good Ewing isn&rsquo;t talked about here. He&rsquo;s in the mix with those guys but the clear answer is Hakeem. He trumped them all but that isn&rsquo;t the question and had a pretty damn god team surrounding him too. One which is again, highly underrated and underappreciated.</p>

I think he was better than Chuck and Robinson&rsquo;s best years were probably a bit better than Malone&rsquo;s peak, but Malone had a much better career,  the way he was still playing in his late 30s was insane, he was the undoubtedly greatest PF of all time before Dirk, Garnett and of course, Duncan got into the conversation.</p>

<p>Screw him as a person, but no doubt an all time great player.</p>

      <label for="likqu4b" class="commentText"><p>I think Barkley was the best pure player of the three, with Malone having the longevity argument. Robinson was no slouch either and the best rim protector of the three.</p>

<p>Barkley was a beast. Better rebounder, could run fast breaks, better playmaker for others, more versatile offensively. He was able to evolve as a player from being young and athletic to experienced and cunning. Robinson struggled once he lost some athleticism and Malone played the same way for 20 years.</p>

<p>Malone gets docked in modern conversations because he is a terrible terrible person and played with a Hall of Fame point guard, but that Stockton/Malone pick and roll was pretty unstoppable because of Malone’s skill set and body.</p>

      <label for="likuprb" class="commentText"><p>Taking their games as they were, Barkley could bring the ball up the court and initiate offense. He had a nice jumper, was an excellent rebounder and was comfortable being a team’s number one offensive option.</p>

<p>Robinson was an athletic specimen and a great defender. I don’t remember his offense much outside of what you would expect from a center of the time.</p>

<p>Karl Malone had a nice jumper. All I remember though is him getting feed the ball made his spot so he could step into an easy jumper. I think he was good in the paint but I guess I didn’t watch enough Utah games.</p>

<p>Of the three, I think Barkley was the best overall. However, the thought of Robinson coming up into today’s game is a tantalizing prospect. I think he would be Rudy Gobert equipped with devastating post moves that could pass out of the paint. He’d probably be able to stretch the floor a little too.</p>

<p>If I’m trying to fill out a 5 player team: Robinson.  You can find other players to fill Barkley and Malone’s roles well.  It’s much harder to find a replacement for Robinson on defense.</p>

      <label for="lilgde8" class="commentText"><p>Calm down Basketball Reference jockeys. If you actually watched them play there would be zero doubt. Charles Barkley. Even on the Dream Team he was the best player. Flawed storytelling would have you believe it was MJ, because it fits the narrative, but if you truly watched the games, Sir Charles was the engine. Beyond that he carried a very flawed Suns team to the Finals. Malone and Robinson were GREAT, don’t get me wrong. But the only answer here is Barkley.</p>

<p>Malone’s stats are inflated from playing with Stockton and he has a strong case for being the single <strong>worst</strong> playoff choker of any star in history. Robinson has an extremely high regular season peak but some of the same playoff dropoff issues and a short career, was not even close to winning a title as a #1 option. </p>

But Charles Barkley didn’t have the body and height of the mailman and admiral, but he carried teams on his shoulders.
He always argued if he had another great in his team, like Shaq had Kobe, he would have won multiple rings too.
My vote’s on Sir Charles.</p>

<p>Charles Barkley was the most versatile, dominating despite being undersized, with incredible rebounding and playmaking.</p>

<p>Karl Malone was the most consistent scorer, with two MVPs and a long, durable career.</p>
