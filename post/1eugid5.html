      <p>These 3 played in the same era. So we cannot use &ldquo;they played in different eras&rdquo; argument.</p>

<p>They all played in 80s to 90s. With their primes intersected in the 90s.</p>

<p>But who is the best player among the three?</p>

<p>Especialy for those who live thru their era, and have more sample of eye test. Who is the best player among the three?</p>

<p>David has 2 Championships and 1 MVP. Chuck had 1 MVP and an amazing Finals Run in 1993. (Just lost to MJ).</p>

<p>Karl is probably the most successful with 2 MVPs and 2 Great Utah Jazz Finals Run. (Just lost twice to MJ)</p>

<p>But in terms of pure basketball talent and production, who is the best player among the 3?</p>

<p>Please Present your argument and objective reasons why.üôÇ</p>

<p>That‚Äôs what I remember anyway. I see that there was a triple overtime game in the Suns finals too.</p>

<p>Robinson was a beast of a defender as well as being an offensive stud, but he had fewer years at his peak because of his Navy service and injuries.</p>

<p>Malone was one of the 3-5 best players in the league for like 15 straight years, and never missed a game.</p>

<p>At peak, Robinson was maybe a little better but Malone has him on career production.</p>

<p>Ironically, the only PF who is by far a better player than him is his own Teammate and Partner Tim Duncan. LMAO.</p>

      <label for="lik4yqy" class="commentText"><p>Robinson was the greatest floor raiser&hellip;a team with him there was automatically around 50 wins. Both the team before his arrival and a year he missed (Duncan!) were garbage. One of the original great lob finishers, got way above the rim. I think he&rsquo;s a bit below olajuwon, but there&rsquo;s a non-crazy argument he was better (I don&rsquo;t give a shit who wins one-v-one). Got a great teammate that would seem to be entirely redundant with him, and immediately figured out how to make it work.</p>

<p>Barkley joined a few good teams and was on some bad ones that he couldn&rsquo;t bring up. Defense wasn&rsquo;t great, not surprising for a 6&rsquo;5&rdquo; forward.</p>

<p>Malone&rsquo;s a tough one. Utah was decent, added Malone and Stockton and were at worst fringe contenders forever. Defense was very good, though the jazz always had a paint protector out there (eaton was a beast in particular).</p>

      <label for="lik76gt" class="commentText"><p>Spurs Fan here:   THESE KIDS TODAY have no idea how much of a beast David Robinson was back then.  Elite rim protector and help defender.   Freakish athleticism.  Amazing human being.  Overall career would beat out all of them as he&rsquo;s the only one to win MVP and NBA title among these 3.</p>

      <label for="lik77g5" class="commentText"><p>Watched them all and here are the options;</p>

<p>-As a fan I&rsquo;m picking Barkley.</p>

<p>-If I&rsquo;m starting a team, I want Robinson.</p>

<p>-If I want to piss people off and win a lot of games, I want Malone.</p>

<p>These three were all great and Malone is definitely underrated because of his persona, but I&rsquo;ve always liked Barkley the best for pure entertainment value.</p>
