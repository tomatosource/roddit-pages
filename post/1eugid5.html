      <p>These 3 played in the same era. So we cannot use &ldquo;they played in different eras&rdquo; argument.</p>

<p>They all played in 80s to 90s. With their primes intersected in the 90s.</p>

<p>But who is the best player among the three?</p>

<p>Especialy for those who live thru their era, and have more sample of eye test. Who is the best player among the three?</p>

<p>David has 2 Championships and 1 MVP. Chuck had 1 MVP and an amazing Finals Run in 1993. (Just lost to MJ).</p>

<p>Karl is probably the most successful with 2 MVPs and 2 Great Utah Jazz Finals Run. (Just lost twice to MJ)</p>

<p>But in terms of pure basketball talent and production, who is the best player among the 3?</p>

<p>Please Present your argument and objective reasons why.🙂</p>

<p>Look at it this way&hellip;..Robinson&rsquo;s biggest rival was Olajuwon.  Olajuwon was better than both Robinson and Malone.  Looking at All-NBA 1st teams punishes Robinson for playing the same position as Olajuwon.</p>

<p>Robinson&rsquo;s first appearance on an all-NBA team was the 89-90 season.  His last was the 2000-01 season.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It absolutely applies.  Perhaps you should re-read the comment I responded to.</p>

The Admiral is one of the first names outside the top 10, around the same level (but probably on the lower end of these names) as Hakeem, Duncan, KG and Giannis among guys who can legitimately say they’re all-time MVP-level two-way big men.</p>

<p>If mailman and admiral left the history of the nba I don’t think today’s game would be much different. I think if sir Charles disappeared we’d have a different game today. It’s okay to disagree but his power + finesse was a pretty unique idea at the time imo</p>

<p>Definitely right that he didn’t bring the ball up. The game was more position based at the time and not a lot of forwards were capable of bringing the ball up the court. However, although rudimentary, Charles set up the space for forwards to handle more.</p>

<p>I don’t disagree with you, maybe a hybrid SF would be more accurate, but I see him as a proto-point forward</p>

If you watched them, He was the biggest physical freak and MORE IMPORTANTLY he abused Karl Malone in head-to-head competition.</p>

<p>David Robinson did not have a star peer that didn’t own him either.</p>

<p>The “eye test” matters.</p>

<p>I hate Malone.   For what he did to Zeke and for being a muscle bound wuss in the Olympics.  That was long before i knew the biggest reason he was a trash human.</p>

<p>All 3 were great offensive players and rebounders and Malone and Barkley are slightly better in that regard, but neither of them was really even a plus defender, much less a great defensive anchor.

      <label for="likoqw2" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re 100% right, I undersold Malone&rsquo;s defence, that applies more so to Barkley. But even then Malone was mostly a good 1-on-1 defender faceup and in the post, but he wasn&rsquo;t the team&rsquo;s main defensive anchor or rim protector like Robinson was. I&rsquo;d still take the Admiral.</p>

      <label for="likqeh2" class="commentText"><p>Ya, Robinson was 100% a better defender, no question there.</p>

<p>I think it’s totally reasonable to pick the Admiral over the other two. I’m biased as a Jazz fan who watched Stockton and Malone all through my formative years (and didn’t know what a piece of shit Malone is personally until much later in life), so I still think Malone is the pick over the course of a whole career. Chuck was so entertaining to watch, but I think DRob and the Mailman on are a different level.</p>

The Suns had a real chance and the Jazz never did. As a Bills fan, that Jazz finals felt like the fourth Super Bowl, they weren’t close to the Bulls’ level.</p>

<p>That’s what I remember anyway. I see that there was a triple overtime game in the Suns finals too.</p>

      <label for="lik4yqy" class="commentText"><p>Robinson was the greatest floor raiser&hellip;a team with him there was automatically around 50 wins. Both the team before his arrival and a year he missed (Duncan!) were garbage. One of the original great lob finishers, got way above the rim. I think he&rsquo;s a bit below olajuwon, but there&rsquo;s a non-crazy argument he was better (I don&rsquo;t give a shit who wins one-v-one). Got a great teammate that would seem to be entirely redundant with him, and immediately figured out how to make it work.</p>

<p>Barkley joined a few good teams and was on some bad ones that he couldn&rsquo;t bring up. Defense wasn&rsquo;t great, not surprising for a 6&rsquo;5&rdquo; forward.</p>

<p>Malone&rsquo;s a tough one. Utah was decent, added Malone and Stockton and were at worst fringe contenders forever. Defense was very good, though the jazz always had a paint protector out there (eaton was a beast in particular).</p>

He was a bad defender and didn’t focus on basketball, got out of shape later in his career when he went to Houston and Karl Malone was a great scorer but more of a black hole who’s game didn’t translate well in the post season and many times where he choked that in one series the GM wanted to bench him. I lean towards Robinson because he’s better all around player, I’m not valuing team success but he just wasn’t surrounded with the right pieces pre Duncan. 2nd best players were Sean Elliot and he had Terry Cummings who was injured, trading away Strickland was a mistake.</p>

      <label for="likg7fl" class="commentText"><p>The Admiral came into the league late and had help from Timmy later. He had other talent around him. Wouldn&rsquo;t underestimate them, what&rsquo;s common nowadays.</p>

<p>Barkley had s good team too. Good mix, chemistry, great shooters for that time. He was undersized but did with the little he had the most. However it was awfully to watch his latter, back to basket years. Ass out and getting into the zone in 5 minutes each time. Awful to watch but before that phase of his career he&rsquo;d be my pick for #1 here.</p>

<p>Malone had Stockton, Hornacek and others throughout his career. David was talk, lean, muscular. Malone was bulkier. These times there were quiet some juiced up guys in the league. Besides his longevity and success, solely as player, I&rsquo;d rank him below the other too. As human anyway.</p>

<p>Good Ewing isn&rsquo;t talked about here. He&rsquo;s in the mix with those guys but the clear answer is Hakeem. He trumped them all but that isn&rsquo;t the question and had a pretty damn god team surrounding him too. One which is again, highly underrated and underappreciated.</p>

      <label for="likk6tv" class="commentText"><p>Sorry, off on a tangent as this got me thinking of all the 3, Robinson would be great today. Literally transplanting the person, not just that skill set is what I also find interesting.</p>

<p>I would love to see David Robinson play in today&rsquo;s league. It&rsquo;s interesting with these conversations, because we always think about how they would adapt if we just dropped them in their prime into the league. However, as a fun hypothetical - what if he was a kid growing up with the same work ethic and discipline, with today&rsquo;s gameplay.</p>

<p>I think he&rsquo;d be more successful today than the 90&rsquo;s version of himself.</p>

He’s a pos so I would never make a big fuss if someone chose Barkley or the Admiral but I think career wise it’s probably Malone</p>

      <label for="likm2g6" class="commentText"><p>I watched all 3 in their primes and it was great — I was a fan of Barkley and Robinson and have always hated Malone so I’m pretty biased. Of the 3, Barkley was a leader and could control the game in the crunch. He was even a leader on a stacked Dream Team, his peak was just fun to watch. I was a huge Robinson fan and was shocked when Hakeem destroyed him in his MVP year so I’d have him behind Barkley. It’s weird to say but I think of Malone as the ultimate role player, never felt like a leader despite the stats. Plus everything you hear about the guy shows what kind of garbage human being he is.</p>

<p>David Robinson was the only true 2-way player of the three noted.</p>

<p>All 3 players were great on offense. Especially when they played as the first option on their teams.</p>

<p>Robinson was physically well ahead of his time, and extremely disciplined.</p>

<p>Chuck played no defense outside of trying to stat pad defensive boards.</p>

<p>Malone was better than Barkley on D, but nothing like D-Rob.</p>

I think he was better than Chuck and Robinson&rsquo;s best years were probably a bit better than Malone&rsquo;s peak, but Malone had a much better career,  the way he was still playing in his late 30s was insane, he was the undoubtedly greatest PF of all time before Dirk, Garnett and of course, Duncan got into the conversation.</p>

<p>Screw him as a person, but no doubt an all time great player.</p>

      <label for="likpkoj" class="commentText"><p>At there prime’s is I think pretty clearly Robinson, legit one of the most impactful players ever. At his peak I think he equals Hakeem as best defensive anchor ever. And was an elite scorer. Also possibly the best big man ever at running the floor aside from maybe Bill Russell.</p>

<p>Career though probably Malone. He won 19 playoff series which is absolutely insane for someone that never won a championship. If I had to guess that he probably holds that record. I also think he did more for Stockton’s career than vice versa.</p>

<p>Barkley is 3rd in both career and peak imo</p>

      <label for="likqu4b" class="commentText"><p>I think Barkley was the best pure player of the three, with Malone having the longevity argument. Robinson was no slouch either and the best rim protector of the three.</p>

<p>Barkley was a beast. Better rebounder, could run fast breaks, better playmaker for others, more versatile offensively. He was able to evolve as a player from being young and athletic to experienced and cunning. Robinson struggled once he lost some athleticism and Malone played the same way for 20 years.</p>

<p>Malone gets docked in modern conversations because he is a terrible terrible person and played with a Hall of Fame point guard, but that Stockton/Malone pick and roll was pretty unstoppable because of Malone’s skill set and body.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say Malone and Robinson are probably tied in their respective roles. Hell, all these guys are probably tied in their respective roles lol. All three were incredibly dominant at their peaks.</p>

<p>Some peaked for slightly less or whatever, but I don&rsquo;t really rate any of these guys better than the other. Dream Team was absolutely loaded.</p>

      <label for="likbsnp" class="commentText"><p>Everyone is probably saying the Admiral, I say Sir Charles. Now I will admit the Admital was on top for longer, however I think Sir Charles’ absolute peak was higher. Sir Charles made a finals and took a 41 a game scoring Jordan ro 6 in a HARD fought series and he took Hakeem to 7 TWICE. David Robinson got humiliated by Hakeem and never made a finals as the best player on his team. I truly belive Sir Charles was essentially one shot away from a ring / going fsrther at least like 4 different times. A few different suors, and you might be talking about Sir Charles with back to back titles while knocking off literlally the GOAT to win one of thsoe titles. </p>
