</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>#Background</p>

<p>Looking forward to the 2024-25 season, betting odds have opened up for various awards. One of the odds sticking out is the betting for Most Improved Player <a href="https://www.si.com/betting/nba-most-improved-player-odds-victor-wembanyama-evan-mobley-lead-field-for-2024-25-season-01j2ye8890hy" target="_blank">due to the inclusion of players such as Victor Wembanyama, Evan Mobley, and Jalen Williams</a>. For those of you who cannot look at the article and see the players listed and there betting odds, here are the players listed below</p>

<ul>
<li>Victor Wembanyama: +900</li>
<li>Evan Mobley: +1200</li>
<li>Jonathan Kuminga: +1400</li>
<li>Brandin Podziemski: +1400</li>
<li>Scottie Barnes: +1600</li>
<li>Jalen Williams: +2000</li>
<li>Cade Cunningham: +2000</li>
<li>Scoot Henderson: +2000</li>
<li>Ausar Thompson: +2000</li>
<li>Josh Giddey: +2500</li>
<li>Immanuel Quickley: +2500</li>
<li>Coby White: +3000</li>
<li>Christian Braun: +3000</li>
<li>Keyonte George: +3000</li>
<li>Cam Whitmore: +3000</li>
</ul>

<p>This has lead to a lot of discussion regarding who should be in consideration of winning the award since there is a belief that Wemby should not be in consideration. Its hard to say that he should not be, though, because there isn&rsquo;t an explicit criteria for who should qualify for the award. The best thing I could find was this definition from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The NBA&rsquo;s Most Improved Player Award (MIP) is an annual National Basketball Association (NBA) award given to the player who has shown the most progress during the regular season compared to previous seasons&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In light of this controversy, below what I believe should be the criteria, so that this debate can finally be over.</p>

<p>#My Proposal</p>

<p>A player should not be considered for MIP if any of the criteria are met:</p>

<ul>
<li>Player has won MVP in any of the previous three seasons or finished in the Top 5 of MVP voting</li>
<li>Player has won DPOY in any of the previous three seasons or finished in the Top 5 of DPOY voting</li>
<li>Player has won ROY in any of the previous three seasons or finished in the Top 2 of ROY voting</li>
<li>Player has achieved All-NBA (first, second, or third team) in any of the previous three seasons</li>
<li>Player has achieved All-Defense (first, second, or third team) in any of the previous three seasons</li>
<li>Player has achieved All-Rookie First Team the previous season</li>
<li>Player has finished in the Top 15 of what I call &ldquo;sectional All-Star voting&rdquo;
** By &ldquo;sectional All-Star voting&rdquo; I mean Top 15 All-Star fan voting for any of the &ldquo;sections&rdquo;. The four sections are Frontcourt Eastern Conference, Backcourt Eastern Conference, Frontcourt Western Conference, and Backcourt Western Conference</li>
</ul>

<p>##Justification</p>

<p>The justification is that spirit of the award is</p>

<ul>
<li>player you wrote off (Coby White, Lauri Markkanen, Jordan Poole)</li>
<li>player that genuinely surprised you because they were not on your radar as potential Top 50 player and turned into one (Desmond Bane, Victor Oladipo)</li>
</ul>

<p>#Re-evaluating the Players From Above</p>

<p>With this in mind, lets see who would be eliminated from consideration based on the criteria we&rsquo;ve laid out</p>

<ul>
<li>Victor Wembanyama (because he was All-Defense in 2024)</li>
<li>Evan Mobley (because he was All-Defense in 2023)</li>
<li>Scottie Barnes (because he was Top 15 in voting for Frontcourt Eastern Conference in 2024)</li>
<li>Jalen Williams (because he was Top 15 in voting for Frontcourt Western Conference in 2024)</li>
</ul>

<p>So these are my thoughts. What are your guys&rsquo; thoughts on all this?</p>

<p>like wemby, really? he&rsquo;s 20 years old and was the #1 pick, obviously he&rsquo;s going to improve on his rookie season, why should he be in this conversation</p>

      <label for="lldb2je" class="commentText"><p>Counterpoint to Wemby odds: MIP should go to guys we don’t expect to make a leap, which by definition is hard to predict and set preseason odds for. So it makes sense to have the guy we expect to improve the most to be the preseason favorite, even if it would be lame for him to win.</p>

<p>Put another way: don’t bet in MIP in the preseason lol, and don’t take these odds to actually predict much.</p>

      <label for="llcngfo" class="commentText"><p>I just think we should give the award to more old guys, rather than up-and-comers who are naturally expected to improve</p>

<p>My prime example is DeMar in 2022 where it was looking like his career was declining in San Antonio before he immediately became an All-NBA player once again with the Bulls. He didn&rsquo;t get a single vote despite jumping 6 ppg on a far better team, while Ja won MIP as a 3rd-year player</p>

<p>Lauri Markkanen and Randle are probably the best representations of who MIP should be given to though</p>

      <label for="llczkpi" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think second year players should be eligible, as you&rsquo;re sort of expecting a player to make a jump from their rookie season. Would say no former top 3 picks. Even if it&rsquo;s them making a leap to an All-Star, that&rsquo;s great, they became the player people expected them to be (maybe an exception if someone has a James Wiseman-esque start all the sudden turns it around). So there could be a certain criteria guys haven&rsquo;t hit to be eligible too.</p>

<p>Should probably just have a separate &ldquo;breakout player of the year&rdquo; for guys who take the next step like we&rsquo;ve seen from guys such as Ja Morant and Maxey who we already knew were capable of doing impressive things.</p>
