    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>An NBA scorekeeper from the ’90s who gave stats to Jordan even when he didn’t earn them went into the Chicago Bulls room after one game and said, “See MJ, we take care of you.”</p>

<p>Scottie Pippen, who won six NBA titles with Jordan, wrote about it in his book, “Unguarded.”</p>

<p>“Michael was better at getting people to do whatever he wanted,” Pippen wrote. “I saw it over and over, from the first training camp in 1987 to the last victory rally in 1998. <strong>Here’s how it worked: Say I deflected the ball and tapped it over to him. I should get credit with the steal, right? Nope. More often than not, the steal went into his column on the stat sheet, and I could do nothing about it.</strong></p>

<p>“One night, a scorekeeper came into the locker room after the game to hand the stat sheets to Phil Jackson and the coaching staff. The sheet breaks down the points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocked shots, turnovers, and so on for everyone who played the game. I couldn’t believe the look the guy gave <strong>Michael: ‘See MJ, we take care of you.’</strong> No wonder in the nine full seasons we played together, he averaged more steals than me in every year except two.”</p>

<p>Two legends of the game, working in the same building for over a decade, Jordan and Rosenberg shared a strong kinship<strong>. On the side, Rosenberg made scrapbooks for Jordan to commemorate his achievements</strong>. In the opening lines of MJ’s 1999 retirement column, Chicago AP writer Jim Litke didn’t mention Phil Jackson or Scottie Pippen. Instead, he raised Rosenberg’s name and relayed a story about Jordan’s shared obsession with stats:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The first week Jordan played for the Bulls, scorer Bob Rosenberg looked up to find him studying the scorebook every time he reported to the table to re-enter the game. It didn’t take long to figure out why. By knowing everybody’s point and rebound totals, Jordan knew how the newspaper stories the next day would begin. Then he took the floor and made sure they always began the same way: ‘Michael Jordan …’”</p>

<p>“I write down everything,” reports Rosenberg. “I have books that list every sporting event I’ve worked or gone to, the statistics, the results, what happened so I can look back knowing I was there. I like having a record. I also get a program from every game I go to and work. I get the newspaper clippings from the next day <strong>(Rosenberg kept at Michael Jordan’s request a scrap book of stories from every game Jordan played for the Bulls and says Michael rewarded him well)</strong>; </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The Rosenberg and Jordan dynamic was written about in the press, and reportedly at one point drew scrutiny from the league office</strong>. According to a 1989 report from the San Francisco Examiner, Rosenberg would flash hand signals to inform Jordan how close he was to a triple-double. The league reportedly stepped in and told Rosenberg to cut it out.</p>

<p>Rosenberg admitted to signaling to help Jordan chase stats during Chicago’s 1988 All-Star Game, a game in which Jordan scored a game-high 40 points, just shy of matching Chamberlain’s then-record of 42. As the site’s official scorekeeper, Rosenberg worked the game and remembered a postgame exchange he had with Jordan. In 2013, Rosenberg shared the following anecdote with the Chicago Tribune:</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me I was two points short of Chamberlain?” Rosenberg recalled Jordan asking him.</p>

<p>“I said, ‘Look, every time you went by, I kept putting up two fingers. You didn’t understand that?’”</p>

      <label for="l9r9mqq" class="commentText"><p>I can see why Pippen is still kind of bitter about MJ, beyond MJ’s son getting with his ex-wife, which is insane.</p>

<p>Everyone knew MJ was better, but Scottie was never allowed to get his due as an individual. If you go to Pippen’s years without Jordan, he led them to 55 wins without him in 1994, and probably would have taken down a great Knicks team in the second round (that was one shot away from a championship) if not for the infamous Hubert Davis call.</p>

<p>In 2000, his Trail Blazers still would have won if they could have hit the basket in the fourth quarter, but an all-time memorably bad officiating job stopped them from taking down the Kobe/Shaq Lakers and being favored in the finals.</p>

<p>Even in the dunk contest, he dunked from further out than MJ or anyone else ever had with  ** almost all of his foot beyond the line, and instead of becoming an icon that won multiple contests he got a low score. Some of it is definitely in his head, but at times he definitely got the short end of the stick to the NBA’s golden goose</p>

      <label for="l9rcl6h" class="commentText"><p>I get what you&rsquo;re saying, but this is one of the most misinformed comic takes I&rsquo;ve heard.</p>

<p>Batman has beaten Superman in fights on several occasions. That&rsquo;s a thing in DC comics. It&rsquo;s supposed to be absurd that Batman, a man with no powers, can defeat an insanely strong alien that can fly and shoot heat beams out of his eyes. The whole point is that part of their relationship is that Superman <em>should</em> be able to beat up Batman with no problem. But Batman <em>almost</em> always wins.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not making any statements about basketball. I&rsquo;m just saying that you&rsquo;re objectively wrong about Batman.</p>

Half the point of these stories is that Superman doesn&rsquo;t actually treat Batman as an enemy, he doesn&rsquo;t try to fry his fucking liver and rip his head out, while Batman works to obliterate him.</p>

<p>If Batman wasn &ldquo;Batman&rdquo; but &ldquo;Darkwing&rdquo;, a villain with 100% of Batman&rsquo;s powers and skill, but just like, evil and needs to be taken down, Sup would just tear his limbs apart and kick his limp body to Uranus.</p>

<p>There’s a reason the Bulls did very well still when MJ retired - Scottie was a very capable leader on the court, Klay is not.</p>

      <label for="l9rcmkf" class="commentText"><p>I can&rsquo;t speak directly on Pippen as I was a child when he played but Pippen is constantly ranked in the top 50 players of all time, if he&rsquo;s the equivalent of Klay are you telling me that Klay is a top 50 player?</p>

<p>To me Klay was the best role player, not to hate on him but he couldn&rsquo;t lead the Warriors without Steph. Pippen led the Bulls to basically the same record without Jordan. I do think it&rsquo;s fair to say Pippen was better than a Robin, because I think it&rsquo;s unfair to boil someone down to a &ldquo;Robin&rdquo;.</p>

Most people who are very successful at something just want to focus on what they do and not spend too much time with the ball-lickers on the keyboards.  But if you give the media your attention they will pay you back with beat sweetener after beat sweetener—Jordan in this case but also see Trump, Jack Welch, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk.</p>

<p>Edit:  I see people are upset I’m judging pippen as a source. I acknowledge that there is a second article mentioned that doesn’t involve pippen.  But like the title and the first half of the body of the post are all about pippen including a quote Scottie attributed to a look the scorekeeper gave which is presented as an actual quote lmao.  So surely talking about pippen in this context is reasonable. And even more so the haberstroh article has been linked x1000 since it was published, the pippen quotes were new to me. But please stay big mad that MJ clowned your team for an entire decade.</p>
