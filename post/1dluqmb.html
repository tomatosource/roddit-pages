      <p>An NBA scorekeeper from the ’90s who gave stats to Jordan even when he didn’t earn them went into the Chicago Bulls room after one game and said, “See MJ, we take care of you.”</p>

<p>Scottie Pippen, who won six NBA titles with Jordan, wrote about it in his book, “Unguarded.”</p>

<p>“Michael was better at getting people to do whatever he wanted,” Pippen wrote. “I saw it over and over, from the first training camp in 1987 to the last victory rally in 1998. <strong>Here’s how it worked: Say I deflected the ball and tapped it over to him. I should get credit with the steal, right? Nope. More often than not, the steal went into his column on the stat sheet, and I could do nothing about it.</strong></p>

<p>“One night, a scorekeeper came into the locker room after the game to hand the stat sheets to Phil Jackson and the coaching staff. The sheet breaks down the points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocked shots, turnovers, and so on for everyone who played the game. I couldn’t believe the look the guy gave <strong>Michael: ‘See MJ, we take care of you.’</strong> No wonder in the nine full seasons we played together, he averaged more steals than me in every year except two.”</p>

<p>Two legends of the game, working in the same building for over a decade, Jordan and Rosenberg shared a strong kinship<strong>. On the side, Rosenberg made scrapbooks for Jordan to commemorate his achievements</strong>. In the opening lines of MJ’s 1999 retirement column, Chicago AP writer Jim Litke didn’t mention Phil Jackson or Scottie Pippen. Instead, he raised Rosenberg’s name and relayed a story about Jordan’s shared obsession with stats:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The first week Jordan played for the Bulls, scorer Bob Rosenberg looked up to find him studying the scorebook every time he reported to the table to re-enter the game. It didn’t take long to figure out why. By knowing everybody’s point and rebound totals, Jordan knew how the newspaper stories the next day would begin. Then he took the floor and made sure they always began the same way: ‘Michael Jordan …’”</p>

<p>“I write down everything,” reports Rosenberg. “I have books that list every sporting event I’ve worked or gone to, the statistics, the results, what happened so I can look back knowing I was there. I like having a record. I also get a program from every game I go to and work. I get the newspaper clippings from the next day <strong>(Rosenberg kept at Michael Jordan’s request a scrap book of stories from every game Jordan played for the Bulls and says Michael rewarded him well)</strong>; </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The Rosenberg and Jordan dynamic was written about in the press, and reportedly at one point drew scrutiny from the league office</strong>. According to a 1989 report from the San Francisco Examiner, Rosenberg would flash hand signals to inform Jordan how close he was to a triple-double. The league reportedly stepped in and told Rosenberg to cut it out.</p>

<p>Rosenberg admitted to signaling to help Jordan chase stats during Chicago’s 1988 All-Star Game, a game in which Jordan scored a game-high 40 points, just shy of matching Chamberlain’s then-record of 42. As the site’s official scorekeeper, Rosenberg worked the game and remembered a postgame exchange he had with Jordan. In 2013, Rosenberg shared the following anecdote with the Chicago Tribune:</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me I was two points short of Chamberlain?” Rosenberg recalled Jordan asking him.</p>

<p>“I said, ‘Look, every time you went by, I kept putting up two fingers. You didn’t understand that?’”</p>
