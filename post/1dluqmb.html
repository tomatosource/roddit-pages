    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>An NBA scorekeeper from the ’90s who gave stats to Jordan even when he didn’t earn them went into the Chicago Bulls room after one game and said, “See MJ, we take care of you.”</p>

<p>Scottie Pippen, who won six NBA titles with Jordan, wrote about it in his book, “Unguarded.”</p>

<p>“Michael was better at getting people to do whatever he wanted,” Pippen wrote. “I saw it over and over, from the first training camp in 1987 to the last victory rally in 1998. <strong>Here’s how it worked: Say I deflected the ball and tapped it over to him. I should get credit with the steal, right? Nope. More often than not, the steal went into his column on the stat sheet, and I could do nothing about it.</strong></p>

<p>“One night, a scorekeeper came into the locker room after the game to hand the stat sheets to Phil Jackson and the coaching staff. The sheet breaks down the points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocked shots, turnovers, and so on for everyone who played the game. I couldn’t believe the look the guy gave <strong>Michael: ‘See MJ, we take care of you.’</strong> No wonder in the nine full seasons we played together, he averaged more steals than me in every year except two.”</p>

<p>Two legends of the game, working in the same building for over a decade, Jordan and Rosenberg shared a strong kinship<strong>. On the side, Rosenberg made scrapbooks for Jordan to commemorate his achievements</strong>. In the opening lines of MJ’s 1999 retirement column, Chicago AP writer Jim Litke didn’t mention Phil Jackson or Scottie Pippen. Instead, he raised Rosenberg’s name and relayed a story about Jordan’s shared obsession with stats:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The first week Jordan played for the Bulls, scorer Bob Rosenberg looked up to find him studying the scorebook every time he reported to the table to re-enter the game. It didn’t take long to figure out why. By knowing everybody’s point and rebound totals, Jordan knew how the newspaper stories the next day would begin. Then he took the floor and made sure they always began the same way: ‘Michael Jordan …’”</p>

<p>“I write down everything,” reports Rosenberg. “I have books that list every sporting event I’ve worked or gone to, the statistics, the results, what happened so I can look back knowing I was there. I like having a record. I also get a program from every game I go to and work. I get the newspaper clippings from the next day <strong>(Rosenberg kept at Michael Jordan’s request a scrap book of stories from every game Jordan played for the Bulls and says Michael rewarded him well)</strong>; </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The Rosenberg and Jordan dynamic was written about in the press, and reportedly at one point drew scrutiny from the league office</strong>. According to a 1989 report from the San Francisco Examiner, Rosenberg would flash hand signals to inform Jordan how close he was to a triple-double. The league reportedly stepped in and told Rosenberg to cut it out.</p>

<p>Rosenberg admitted to signaling to help Jordan chase stats during Chicago’s 1988 All-Star Game, a game in which Jordan scored a game-high 40 points, just shy of matching Chamberlain’s then-record of 42. As the site’s official scorekeeper, Rosenberg worked the game and remembered a postgame exchange he had with Jordan. In 2013, Rosenberg shared the following anecdote with the Chicago Tribune:</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me I was two points short of Chamberlain?” Rosenberg recalled Jordan asking him.</p>

<p>“I said, ‘Look, every time you went by, I kept putting up two fingers. You didn’t understand that?’”</p>

      <label for="l9r9mqq" class="commentText"><p>I can see why Pippen is still kind of bitter about MJ, beyond MJ’s son getting with his ex-wife, which is insane.</p>

<p>Everyone knew MJ was better, but Scottie was never allowed to get his due as an individual. If you go to Pippen’s years without Jordan, he led them to 55 wins without him in 1994, and probably would have taken down a great Knicks team in the second round (that was one shot away from a championship) if not for the infamous Hubert Davis call.</p>

<p>In 2000, his Trail Blazers still would have won if they could have hit the basket in the fourth quarter, but an all-time memorably bad officiating job stopped them from taking down the Kobe/Shaq Lakers and being favored in the finals.</p>

<p>Even in the dunk contest, he dunked from further out than MJ or anyone else ever had with  ** almost all of his foot beyond the line, and instead of becoming an icon that won multiple contests he got a low score. Some of it is definitely in his head, but at times he definitely got the short end of the stick to the NBA’s golden goose</p>

In The Last Dance, Jordan explicitly says “Without Scottie, there is no Michael Jordan and there isn’t 6 championships. He’s the greatest teammate I’ve ever had.” And somehow to Scottie, he took that as “He couldn’t have been more condescending had he tried.” Because Scottie is looking for Jordan to call him his equal, and that ain’t happening.</p>

No one ever called Pip a role player, they called him a star - part of the dynamic duo, and he was part of 2 big 3s before it was even a thing (Horace being less historic than Rodman for the first group). Pip is the one who keeps bashing his own legacy by picking fights in the media and his books. Hell, Pip had Mike introduce him for his HoF speech and called him the best teammate ever. Whatever advice or stuff that is going on with Pip has less to do with Mike and more himself. He hasn’t handled his money, women, and families well.</p>

I think people say top 5 without considering the full list of players. If Giannis and SGA or Jokic and Luka were on the same team people would expect a dynasty.

<p>Side note, J Brown has kind of gone through something similar next to Tatum. But the finals MVP should give him some measure of peace if he lets it.</p>

      <label for="l9rdzhs" class="commentText"><p>This sounds like a lame thing to say about a superstar but somehow I wish there was a way to get through to Scottie that most big basketball fans know he’s one of the greatest two way players to ever play and not just some sidekick. He’s one of the best ever. And yet years of being in MJ’s shadow, personal life struggles, and being underpaid really have depleted his self confidence and made him always justifying his legacy in the media.</p>

      <label for="l9rhe93" class="commentText"><p>I wish it was more acceptable to say that, for example, Pippen was actually a better defender than Jordan. Don’t even think it’s that contentious of an argument, but Jordan’s legacy has smothered the ability to discuss Pippen rationally or argue for him.</p>

<p>Was Jordan a better overall player? Yeah, sure. But not by such a significant level that it couldn’t be argued that Pippen did certain things better.</p>

      <label for="l9roae2" class="commentText"><p>I watched the both play since before they won their first ring, Pippen was a better defender - his body is like built for defense, best perimeter defender I&rsquo;ve ever seen, a text book defender - but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d say &ldquo;much, much better&rdquo; as that might be overdoing it at least a little.  MJ&rsquo;s defense was incredible and he was a man possessed at times (it helped him win games, so you know how that&rsquo;s going to go).  They were both great, which is what made them so good and part of why the Bulls won so much - you can not win that consistently twice in a row relying only on offense.</p>

<p>On that team level, Horace was a great defender.  Then the next 3 peat they had Rodman. Incredible defensively, and the way MJ, Pippen and Phil led by example, every one else had to buy in and defend as well.</p>

<p>This is no disrespect to MJ, but shooting guards weren&rsquo;t exactly &ldquo;scoring&rdquo; machines in that era. You had MJ and Drexler. That helps with defense. Still a great defender, but he would struggle a lot more in the modern NBA with all those scoring guards.</p>

<p>MJ was basically the prototype.</p>

      <label for="l9rn85i" class="commentText"><p>Pippen is probably the best overall defensive player I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Russell was a different era, so I won&rsquo;t compare. Olajuwon is maybe the only guy I could put over Pippen, but even then, he wasn&rsquo;t nearly as versatile.</p>

<p>I know people viewed Pippen as a great defender, but I still think he doesn&rsquo;t get enough credit. He was leaps and bounds better as a defender than Gary Payton. It wasn&rsquo;t even close. Payton is legendary though. Take prime Pippen and put him in the modern NBA, and he&rsquo;d be the best defensive player in the league. He&rsquo;d be like prime Kawhi, but with better instincts and more rim protection. It would be insane.</p>

<p>Batman has beaten Superman in fights on several occasions. That&rsquo;s a thing in DC comics. It&rsquo;s supposed to be absurd that Batman, a man with no powers, can defeat an insanely strong alien that can fly and shoot heat beams out of his eyes. The whole point is that part of their relationship is that Superman <em>should</em> be able to beat up Batman with no problem. But Batman <em>almost</em> always wins.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not making any statements about basketball. I&rsquo;m just saying that you&rsquo;re objectively wrong about Batman.</p>

      <label for="l9rcfu9" class="commentText"><p>Totally agree.  Pippen&rsquo;s arguably the greatest perimeter defender of all time.  He did it all: on-ball, help defense, zone, covering passing lanes.</p>

<p>Jordan&rsquo;s the GOAT for me but anyone saying the Bulls were just Jordan don&rsquo;t know basketball.</p>

      <label for="l9rib0z" class="commentText"><p>Scottie is widely recognized as one of the 30 or 35 best players ever when the &lsquo;lists&rsquo; are done.  And either him or Kobe for best number 2 guy.  How many All-NBAs, like 8, how many All-Defensive teams, like 10, how many All Star games like 6.</p>

<p>To say &ldquo;he was never allowed to get his due&rdquo;, I mean, that&rsquo;s not correct.  He was regarded as one of the 5 or 10 best players in the league at the time, at any given year in the 90s.  Yes, it was really nice for the Bulls to have a second-best player that was better than a lot of teams best player.  That&rsquo;s why they fucking dominated in 96 and 97, nobody was going to touch them.  Two Threepeats.  Nephews say the expansion, but the Heat were good pretty fast, the Hornets were decent, Orlando went to a Finals, the shitty expansion teams were in the West, the Timberwolves and the Grizzlies.</p>

<p>The dunk contest, Scottie did the dunk in the first round, that was his mistake.  He got like a 42 lol.  Should have started with something different.</p>

<p>The 2000 Blazers choked that game away, man, I was pulling for Scottie, and Sheed, Smith, Sabonis, Grant(? with the dreadlocks), and certified Lakers hater.  Ugh, that was tough.  Yes the Lakers got calls down the final stretch but the Blazers let it get close to begin with.  And then once it got to within 8 or so, then every call went the Lakers way and Sabonis fouled out and you know the rest.</p>

<p>All this played out 30 years ago&hellip; we&rsquo;re talking about &ldquo;Scottie tipped a pass and Jordan got possession of the ball and was credited with a steal&rdquo; lol.  But I guess it boils down to, Scottie could have been seen as one of the 20 best players ever, say, instead of 30 best.  And that&rsquo;s been bugging him all this time.</p>

<p>He did have to focus more on defense, he did have to sacrifice a little of his scoring.  He was underpaid.  But you know who else was underpaid, was Jordan, during the first four of the championships.  (Pip made more $ than Jordan from basketball, btw).  He always was overshadowed by MJ, probably always will be.  I think he gets used as a piece by the anti-Jordan crowd.  Dude, it wasn&rsquo;t a secret that Pip was one of the five or 10 best players in the league.  Or that he was unhappy about his contract.  Or that he wanted to lead his own team, but sacrificed stats for winning.</p>

If Jordan came to the Bulls last, we would always remember him as a player that took an already very good team and made them a dynasty. If KD was drafted by the Warriors, and then the rest of the players came after, we&rsquo;d be looking at KD as a GOAT.</p>

<p>Was he a psycho about winning? Of course. But then he won a bunch of times and has been considered the greatest of all time for about 3 decades. His name is synonymous with success and dominance.
At 60 something years old, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s getting worked up about reddit posts or Twitter comments.</p>

<p>And I don&rsquo;t believe this has any effect on his legacy.  Shit, people have said  for years that John Stockton benefited from home cooking and he&rsquo;s still considered one of the greatest point guards of all time.</p>

<p>MJ&rsquo;s legacy is pretty much set in stone.</p>

<p>Scottie losing key stats, in an era where stats were starting to become king, is truly something that should be harped on. His former teammate&rsquo;s son fucking his EX-WIFE has nothing to do with him being discredited and even potentially receiving less money due to such.</p>

      <label for="l9rdqt6" class="commentText"><p>To be fair, this subreddit got into a frenzy about some bogus claims that the Grizzlies scorekeepers were padding stats. It got so much traction that several venues in Vegas temporarily stopped taking bets for Jaren Jackson Jr to win DPOTY.</p>

<p>It turned out that OP (and the rest of us, apparently) didn&rsquo;t know what the NBA counts as &ldquo;Blocks&rdquo;. The stats were correct, and it kind of hurt JJJ&rsquo;s defensive reputation. I don&rsquo;t blame r/nba for being skeptical on another claim about bogus stat keeping.</p>

      <label for="l9rc2pi" class="commentText"><p>It’s not that. The press is kind to people who will talk to them both for quotes and background.  Most people who are very successful at something just want to focus on what they do and not spend too much time with the ball-lickers on the keyboards.  But if you give the media your attention they will pay you back with beat sweetener after beat sweetener—Jordan in this case but also see Trump, Jack Welch, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk.</p>

It&rsquo;s not like he wasn&rsquo;t exceptionally dominant even if steals were edged in his favor during his DPOY year. It&rsquo;s not like you can doctor the score or points scored nor the fact that he was insane at defense even outside of steals.</p>

People know Scottie was valuable but it’s mostly just credited to Jordan being superhuman. When a lot of times while Jordan was scoring crazy Pippen was leading the team in every other category while being arguably the best perimeter defender ever. He gets painted as Jordan’s sidekick which is understandable tbh. It’s Jordan. But imo Scottie was more than a sidekick. Less Robin to Batman and more Knightwing and Batman. As good as Batman? No. But he was really damn good too he just happened to be playing next to Michael Jordan.</p>

But like the title and the first half of the body of the post are all about pippen including a quote Scottie attributed to a look the scorekeeper gave which is presented as an actual quote lmao.  So surely talking about pippen in this context is reasonable. And even more so the haberstroh article has been linked x1000 since it was published, the pippen quotes were new to me. But please stay big mad that MJ clowned your team for an entire decade.</p>
