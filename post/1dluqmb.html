    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>An NBA scorekeeper from the ’90s who gave stats to Jordan even when he didn’t earn them went into the Chicago Bulls room after one game and said, “See MJ, we take care of you.”</p>

<p>Scottie Pippen, who won six NBA titles with Jordan, wrote about it in his book, “Unguarded.”</p>

<p>“Michael was better at getting people to do whatever he wanted,” Pippen wrote. “I saw it over and over, from the first training camp in 1987 to the last victory rally in 1998. <strong>Here’s how it worked: Say I deflected the ball and tapped it over to him. I should get credit with the steal, right? Nope. More often than not, the steal went into his column on the stat sheet, and I could do nothing about it.</strong></p>

<p>“One night, a scorekeeper came into the locker room after the game to hand the stat sheets to Phil Jackson and the coaching staff. The sheet breaks down the points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocked shots, turnovers, and so on for everyone who played the game. I couldn’t believe the look the guy gave <strong>Michael: ‘See MJ, we take care of you.’</strong> No wonder in the nine full seasons we played together, he averaged more steals than me in every year except two.”</p>

<p>Two legends of the game, working in the same building for over a decade, Jordan and Rosenberg shared a strong kinship<strong>. On the side, Rosenberg made scrapbooks for Jordan to commemorate his achievements</strong>. In the opening lines of MJ’s 1999 retirement column, Chicago AP writer Jim Litke didn’t mention Phil Jackson or Scottie Pippen. Instead, he raised Rosenberg’s name and relayed a story about Jordan’s shared obsession with stats:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The first week Jordan played for the Bulls, scorer Bob Rosenberg looked up to find him studying the scorebook every time he reported to the table to re-enter the game. It didn’t take long to figure out why. By knowing everybody’s point and rebound totals, Jordan knew how the newspaper stories the next day would begin. Then he took the floor and made sure they always began the same way: ‘Michael Jordan …’”</p>

<p>“I write down everything,” reports Rosenberg. “I have books that list every sporting event I’ve worked or gone to, the statistics, the results, what happened so I can look back knowing I was there. I like having a record. I also get a program from every game I go to and work. I get the newspaper clippings from the next day <strong>(Rosenberg kept at Michael Jordan’s request a scrap book of stories from every game Jordan played for the Bulls and says Michael rewarded him well)</strong>; </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The Rosenberg and Jordan dynamic was written about in the press, and reportedly at one point drew scrutiny from the league office</strong>. According to a 1989 report from the San Francisco Examiner, Rosenberg would flash hand signals to inform Jordan how close he was to a triple-double. The league reportedly stepped in and told Rosenberg to cut it out.</p>

<p>Rosenberg admitted to signaling to help Jordan chase stats during Chicago’s 1988 All-Star Game, a game in which Jordan scored a game-high 40 points, just shy of matching Chamberlain’s then-record of 42. As the site’s official scorekeeper, Rosenberg worked the game and remembered a postgame exchange he had with Jordan. In 2013, Rosenberg shared the following anecdote with the Chicago Tribune:</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me I was two points short of Chamberlain?” Rosenberg recalled Jordan asking him.</p>

<p>“I said, ‘Look, every time you went by, I kept putting up two fingers. You didn’t understand that?’”</p>

      <label for="l9r9mqq" class="commentText"><p>I can see why Pippen is still kind of bitter about MJ, beyond MJ’s son getting with his ex-wife, which is insane.</p>

<p>Everyone knew MJ was better, but Scottie was never allowed to get his due as an individual. If you go to Pippen’s years without Jordan, he led them to 55 wins without him in 1994, and probably would have taken down a great Knicks team in the second round (that was one shot away from a championship) if not for the infamous Hubert Davis call.</p>

<p>In 2000, his Trail Blazers still would have won if they could have hit the basket in the fourth quarter, but an all-time memorably bad officiating job stopped them from taking down the Kobe/Shaq Lakers and being favored in the finals.</p>

<p>Even in the dunk contest, he dunked from further out than MJ or anyone else ever had with  ** almost all of his foot beyond the line, and instead of becoming an icon that won multiple contests he got a low score. Some of it is definitely in his head, but at times he definitely got the short end of the stick to the NBA’s golden goose</p>

3rd in MVP. NBA 1st team, defensive 1st team, 4 DPOY.</p>

<p>Pippen was a great player. He got the 1st defensive team 8 times in a row, and was top 10 in MVP voting 5 times.</p>

<p>He was not just a “role player” like other people are calling him.</p>

      <label for="l9rfwk6" class="commentText"><p>Shaq and Kobe and Durant and Steph are the only team ups I can think of that involved two definitive top 5 players in the 2000s. I think people say top 5 without considering the full list of players. If Giannis and SGA or Jokic and Luka were on the same team people would expect a dynasty. Hell any of those 4 with LeBron would also expect a championship every year they were healthy till LeBron declines (eventually) due to age.</p>

<p>Of all of the mentioned duos, I think Steph/KD had the best supporting cast and were most likely to match the MJ Bulls with better health and longevity. They also had the most competition imo</p>

<p>Absolutely not. The first year they were together, D wade was arguably top 10 (Not top 5). Year 2+, he was maybe top 20 and by year 4 he DEFINITELY wasn&rsquo;t top 20.</p>

<p>Wad fell off HARD during the heatles era. really hard.</p>

In The Last Dance, Jordan explicitly says “Without Scottie, there is no Michael Jordan and there isn’t 6 championships. He’s the greatest teammate I’ve ever had.” And somehow to Scottie, he took that as “He couldn’t have been more condescending had he tried.” Because Scottie is looking for Jordan to call him his equal, and that ain’t happening.</p>

<p>Side note, J Brown has kind of gone through something similar next to Tatum. But the finals MVP should give him some measure of peace if he lets it.</p>

<p>Batman has beaten Superman in fights on several occasions. That&rsquo;s a thing in DC comics. It&rsquo;s supposed to be absurd that Batman, a man with no powers, can defeat an insanely strong alien that can fly and shoot heat beams out of his eyes. The whole point is that part of their relationship is that Superman <em>should</em> be able to beat up Batman with no problem. But Batman <em>almost</em> always wins.</p>

<p>If Batman wasn &ldquo;Batman&rdquo; but &ldquo;Darkwing&rdquo;, a villain with 100% of Batman&rsquo;s powers and skill, but just like, evil and needs to be taken down, Sup would just tear his limbs apart and kick his limp body to Uranus.</p>

      <label for="l9rgx86" class="commentText"><p>Pippen deserved more praise than what most give, but he&rsquo;s also not a top 20 all time player so not remotely close to Jordan. The top 75 player list despite all its controversies, puts Pippen pretty accurately IMO.</p>

<p>To me the issue is more of a perception thing, people think of Jordan as the definitive 1 and rodman + Pippen as the 2A/2B support cast. Pippen deserve his flowers rather than Jordan&rsquo;s shadow or sometimes even challenged to go lower than top 50 all time because they think it&rsquo;s all MJ, but most people objectively puts him where he should be in the 25-40 zone which is accurately representing his true skill level and team contribution.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just the &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of him being talked about as a &ldquo;top 30-35 all time&rdquo; is very different compared to the others like Isiah Thomas or Dwade or Patrick Ewing because people tend to talk about Pippen &amp; his accolades only in context of Jordan. That&rsquo;s the only really unfair part, to me.</p>

He’s one of the best ever. And yet years of being in MJ’s shadow, personal life struggles, and being underpaid really have depleted his self confidence and made him always justifying his legacy in the media.</p>

Don’t even think it’s that contentious of an argument, but Jordan’s legacy has smothered the ability to discuss Pippen rationally or argue for him.</p>

<p>Was Jordan a better overall player? Yeah, sure. But not by such a significant level that it couldn’t be argued that Pippen did certain things better.</p>

      <label for="l9rib0z" class="commentText"><p>Scottie is widely recognized as one of the 30 or 35 best players ever when the &lsquo;lists&rsquo; are done.  And either him or Kobe for best number 2 guy.  How many All-NBAs, like 8, how many All-Defensive teams, like 10, how many All Star games like 6.</p>

<p>To say &ldquo;he was never allowed to get his due&rdquo;, I mean, that&rsquo;s not correct.  He was regarded as one of the 5 or 10 best players in the league at the time, at any given year in the 90s.  Yes, it was really nice for the Bulls to have a second-best player that was better than a lot of teams best player.  That&rsquo;s why they fucking dominated in 96 and 97, nobody was going to touch them.  Two Threepeats.  Nephews say the expansion, but the Heat were good pretty fast, the Hornets were decent, Orlando went to a Finals, the shitty expansion teams were in the West, the Timberwolves and the Grizzlies.</p>

<p>The dunk contest, Scottie did the dunk in the first round, that was his mistake.  He got like a 42 lol.  Should have started with something different.</p>

<p>The 2000 Blazers choked that game away, man, I was pulling for Scottie, and Sheed, Smith, Sabonis, Grant(? with the dreadlocks), and certified Lakers hater.  Ugh, that was tough.  Yes the Lakers got calls down the final stretch but the Blazers let it get close to begin with.  And then once it got to within 8 or so, then every call went the Lakers way and Sabonis fouled out and you know the rest.</p>

<p>All this played out 30 years ago&hellip; we&rsquo;re talking about &ldquo;Scottie tipped a pass and Jordan got possession of the ball and was credited with a steal&rdquo; lol.  But I guess it boils down to, Scottie could have been seen as one of the 20 best players ever, say, instead of 30 best.  And that&rsquo;s been bugging him all this time.</p>

<p>He did have to focus more on defense, he did have to sacrifice a little of his scoring.  He was underpaid.  But you know who else was underpaid, was Jordan, during the first four of the championships.  (Pip made more $ than Jordan from basketball, btw).  He always was overshadowed by MJ, probably always will be.  I think he gets used as a piece by the anti-Jordan crowd.  Dude, it wasn&rsquo;t a secret that Pip was one of the five or 10 best players in the league.  Or that he was unhappy about his contract.  Or that he wanted to lead his own team, but sacrificed stats for winning.</p>

      <label for="l9rixq6" class="commentText"><p>The last dance kinda flipped Pippen i feel. When you’re in those documentaries, you’re talking to the camera for 8 hours and they take 35 minutes worth to put in the doc.  Who knows what Pippen said.</p>

<p>I love MJ, and i think in his mind he did his best to acknowledge pippens contributions, but TLD didn’t show Pippen in a favorable light.  MJ could’ve chosen to not highlight the migraine game or the Toni buzzer beater, but they spent a substantial amount of time on both.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, none of Pippens impressive play in the Finals was highlighted at ANY point.  He was very briefly mentioned picking up Magic full court, but none of his other impressive resume of Finals performances was highlighted like they did Paxson or Kerr.</p>

<p>Pippen was inappropriate with his reaction, but I can see how the doc pissed him off.</p>

<p>Thats something that makes me think <em>maybe</em> Lebron could be better after we saw what he did with the Cavs at start of career.</p>

<p>Scottie losing key stats, in an era where stats were starting to become king, is truly something that should be harped on. His former teammate&rsquo;s son fucking his EX-WIFE has nothing to do with him being discredited and even potentially receiving less money due to such.</p>

      <label for="l9rkw8w" class="commentText"><p>I get it, but those are ultimately immature emotions and sentiments that a ton of highly successful people fall victim to.  More praise from randoms will not fill the hole inside him.  &ldquo;The credit I deserve&rdquo; is a road without end; there is never a pot of gold at the end of that rainbow.  &ldquo;Respect&rdquo; as he imagines it is a dead end street.  The guy is going to be on his death bed, and instead of being surrounded by the warmth of people who love him dearly, he&rsquo;ll be bitter and emotionally alone unless he gets his head right.</p>

<p>The guy is universally admired as one of the 50 best players ever.  His name comes up in every conversation about &ldquo;best perimeter defenders of all time,&rdquo; and he shows up on a ton of top lists.</p>

<p>The pride should be in having laid it all out there and succeeded at the highest level.  Amazing, right?  Now go live your life and stop the endless bitterness parade.  It&rsquo;s been a steady stream of &ldquo;poor Scottie&rdquo; for like 30 years.  He loses respect every time he goes out and begs for it.</p>

<p>And, objectively, if it wasn&rsquo;t for Jordan, Pippen would be more obscure.  He would not have been &ldquo;more respected&rdquo; if he averaged a little more whatever per game.</p>

He is MJ best teammate and was a borderline mvp caliber back in his day, play a significant part in those Bulls championship as well as the locker room, if anyone knows the truth about those team and stuffs then it is him.</p>

      <label for="l9r8obc" class="commentText"><p>Ah yes notable impartial about Jordan observer Scottie Pippen. Love Scottie the player but dude is unhinged about Jordan at this point.</p>

<p>Edit:  I see people are upset I’m judging pippen as a source. I acknowledge that there is a second article mentioned that doesn’t involve pippen.  But like the title and the first half of the body of the post are all about pippen including a quote Scottie attributed to a look the scorekeeper gave which is presented as an actual quote lmao.  So surely talking about pippen in this context is reasonable. And even more so the haberstroh article has been linked x1000 since it was published, the pippen quotes were new to me. But please stay big mad that MJ clowned your team for an entire decade.</p>

<p>But decades later he still doesn’t seem that happy with his career because he compares it with Jordan’s.</p>

People know Scottie was valuable but it’s mostly just credited to Jordan being superhuman. When a lot of times while Jordan was scoring crazy Pippen was leading the team in every other category while being arguably the best perimeter defender ever. He gets painted as Jordan’s sidekick which is understandable tbh. It’s Jordan. But imo Scottie was more than a sidekick. Less Robin to Batman and more Knightwing and Batman. As good as Batman? No. But he was really damn good too he just happened to be playing next to Michael Jordan.</p>

      <label for="l9rlhti" class="commentText"><p>Who gives a shit if some stat padding took place 36 years ago?  I doubt this phenomenon was singular to MJ either.
