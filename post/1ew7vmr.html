</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>This isn’t meant to be a goat debate but I’m sure will turn into one, especially because I am going to use Lebron and MJ as my two main examples. When discussing how great players are, 2 terms are thrown around a lot.</p>

<p>How high was a players “peak”</p>

<p>How long is a players “longevity”</p>

<p>For example, when discussing MJ vs Lebron, most ppl agree that MJ had the greater peak where his best was better than lebrons best, but lebron has been greater for longer(and not just longer than MJ he’s been greater for longer than anyone).</p>

<p>The argument that MJ is better than Lebron because of his peak is fair in a vacuum, but how long does a peak have to last to be more important than longevity.</p>

<p>For example, guys like KG and Hakeem had relatively short peaks but during their peaks had some of the consensus greatest seasons of all time. No one considers either of these guys better than lebron, and looking a tier below not better than tim Duncan who also had a high peak, but is generally ranked greater due to his longevity.</p>

<p>MJ had a peak well longer than these 2 examples, but by this logic that everyone uses clearly longevity is important when determining player greatness, so I’m curious to hear ur guys thoughts and what makes u view one player higher than another in terms of longevity and peak.</p>

<p>Note: I don’t want hate, I have no opinion and who is better between MJ and Lebron because that specific convo only brings toxicity so don’t make the comments about that.</p>

      <label for="liwnfez" class="commentText"><p>Imo longevity as a superstar should be the most important thing, and things shouldn’t be weighed so much on whether a player wanted to leave on top vs continue all the benefits on being in the NBA way past their prime.</p>

<p>E.g. Shaq had pretty good longevity, but his 19 seasons weren’t the same as some others. KG played 21 years, but his last 3 or 4 definitely weren’t “KG”. Kareem played as long as LeBron, but his last three years he was a third, fourth, and then fifth option</p>

      <label for="liwmzuf" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not just about peak it&rsquo;s about how much you actually achieve during that time period. MJ in his peak won 3 Finals MVPs, 3 MVPs, 1 DPOY, 6 scoring titles, and was both All NBA and All Defensive 1st team in all 6 years between 1988-1993. LeBron is still playing at a high level but his days of competing for championships are long over still respect him for helping us win a gold medal.</p>

      <label for="liwo5sf" class="commentText"><p>Oh yea fs. Just to counter that w a diff player a bit. A shorter but possibly more impressive stretch is Hakeem from 92-94. 1 MVP (2 other top 5 finishes) 2 DPOY and 1 third finish in dpoy, 2 rings, and I’m pretty sure was top 5 in points, blocks, and rebounds all 3 years(don’t count me on that). I’m also young so didn’t watch Hakeem or Jordan just spitting stats but that 3 years peak extrapolated to the 10 or so years Jordan’s peak was is def on par or just barely off.</p>

<p>I’m obviously not gonna pretend Hakeem is better than Jordan or bron but it is interesting that ig we as fans value longevity in a peak as well as the peak of said peak(sorry for that word vomit there)</p>

      <label for="liwv6ls" class="commentText"><p>Stuff like this requires looking at each player and breaking down how great their peak was and how long they were able to sustain it. As well as how long one plays close to their peak and for how long as well.</p>

<p>How important one is vs the other really just depends on the player and who he is being compared to. For example, Kawhi Leonard has an absurdly high peak, it wouldn’t be the craziest thing for one to try and argue peak Kawhi over peak Curry or peak KD. But even if one were to agree with peak Kawhi being better than the peaks of those other two, Kawhi wouldn’t rank higher than them. Those guys have had primes last alls long if not even longer than Kawhi’s entire career. Kawhi only has like 4-5 years of a prime which just isn’t gonna cut it when comparing him to guys like Curry or KD who have sustained excellence for 10 or more years now.</p>
