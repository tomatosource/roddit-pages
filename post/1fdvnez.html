<p>Best case scenario: The call gets overturned and you get to say &ldquo;Yeah see, we both know the refs are trying to cheat you guys now go show them what&rsquo;s up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Worst case scenario: It doesn&rsquo;t get overturned and you say &ldquo;Okay so we know the refs are trying to cheat you and they&rsquo;re going to keep at it. Fuck them anyways.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lmndi6n" class="commentText"><p>Kerr’s main strength is the team having confidence in him. It’s worked out well especially after 2021. He supports his players a lot and has become part of the warriors identity. I think he also knew there wasn’t really any chance of gsw winning shit last season so he kinda just did what made him feel good I guess.</p>

      <label for="lmnv5g6" class="commentText"><p>For what it’s worth, I don’t think this is true. Like at all. I’ve watched 99% of Dubs games since the replay review was implemented. The vast majority of times Kerr doesn’t look back to the bench for confirmation on whether to challenge is when Draymond is huffing and puffing, demanding one. Even with Steph, he’ll look back and up at the Jumbotron to see the replays. I genuinely believe it’s a combination of Steve trusting Green AND not wanting to deal with his emotional ass <em>if</em> they don’t back him. I’ve even seen Kerr stand with Draymond, point up to the Jumbotron and clearly say, “Draymond, look.” It’s obvious Green is wrong, but he still moaned and groaned his way to the bench. Green is without a doubt our second most important player, so do not confuse my criticism for hate.</p>

<p>The last couple of seasons, Jacob Rubin has been the staff member on the bench with the tablet in his hand, telling Kerr whether he thinks they should challenge or not. He’s been dreadful. Just awful. To the point that I learned his name.</p>

      <label for="lmnualb" class="commentText"><p>Bro what percentage of calls do people think came from players complaining to Kerr to challenge? He has so many dumb challenges after looking at the big screen in slow motion and anyone with a brain thinks &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no way Steve Kerr is challenging this&rdquo; and he does it because he&rsquo;s a fucking dumbass. Has done this for years. Only a minor percentage of this can be blamed on Draymond&rsquo;s manchild lashing. And some other percentage to his coaching staff who are just as stupid and encourage Kerr to challenge.</p>

There are plenty of clips where the camera zooms in on Kerr and you can clearly see him asking the player (typically Draymond) if he wants to challenge the call. Usually it&rsquo;s a low stake situation so no one really cares, except for the extremely stupid Fire Kerr crowd who take this to be more serious than it really is.</p>

      <label for="lmkqvw2" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, and notably, Kerr is at a point in his career where he doesn’t worry about looking foolish if his challenge is overturned. There’s no ego in it for him - he’ll either challenge because he thinks he can win, or use it as a way to show trust in his players.</p>

<p>Sometimes I’m sure he even <em>hopes</em> the calls his players insist on will be overturned, because it helps humble them for when he needs to tell them to shut up in the future.</p>

      <label for="lmjkete" class="commentText"><p>Because a lot of the time they are just using their challenges to massage the egos of the players, who twirl their finger around.</p>

<p>But the Bulls deserve no praise for just going <sup>17</sup>&frasl;<sub>22</sub>. Number of attempts is meaningless. Number of wins has meaning. They won 3 more than the Warriors. The Mavericks won 23 more!</p>

<p>The goal of every team should really be to use at least one challenge in every single game. It is a tool, that can help you win. The chance that the refs will miss 0 calls against you in 48 minutes… is low.</p>

<p>The reward deserves consideration too. Not every challenge is created equal. Wiping an and-1 off the board is a lot more valuable than just getting the ball out of bounds.</p>

<p>Some coaches might save them for last minute when the game is on the line and throw them out even though they have a much lower odds of winning the call.</p>

<p>Like I have a 100% chance to win this challenge at the start of the 3rd quarter versus 50% chance to win this challenge at the end of the 4th.</p>

Yes the points are equal but that does not mean if you made two free throws in the 1st quarter of a 1 point loss, that you would have won that game. If players and coaches were robots with no emotions or feelings of pressure, those points would win you the game, but that’s not the case in reality.</p>

<p>oh well.</p>

<p>And this stat doesn&rsquo;t mean much.</p>

<p>When you see tantrum Green or furious Curry. You just gotta challenge that.</p>

      <label for="lmjzmuf" class="commentText"><p>I’ve been daying this since it was implemented: The coaches challenge is THE WORST thing to happen to Kerr in his coaching career. The man is TERRIBLE at them. He just cannot seem to figure out the right strategy. He wastes them at terrible situations and consistently chooses to challenge plays that, upon replay, don’t have a shot in hell of being reversed. I honestly think the Warriors need to hire a specific expert to the coaching staff whose one job is to be the decider of whether or not a play gets challenged. Just pass this off to an expert and don’t let Kerr or his stars make the decision.</p>
