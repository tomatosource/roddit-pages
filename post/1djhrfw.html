      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1djhrfw/former_nba_player_marvin_barnes_once_refused_to/"><p>Former NBA player Marvin Barnes once refused to board a plane from Louisville to St. Louis with his team. Because the flight was scheduled to arrive (Central Time) before its departure time (Eastern Time), Barnes famously said, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t getting in no damn time machine.&rdquo; He rented a car instead</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Marvin “Bad News” Barnes was probably one of the best raw basketball talents of the 1970s, but with drugs, partying, and other career choices he was out of the pros pretty quickly. With drug addiction being a major factor, he became homeless shortly after he was one of basketball’s most talented players.</p>

<p>Here are some other Marvin Barnes stories and anecdotes, originally from the book Loose Balls:</p>

<p>In his youth, Barnes was part of a gang that attempted to rob a bus. Barnes was quickly identified, as he was wearing his state championship jacket with his name embroidered on it.</p>

<p>Marvin just figured that everybody would take care of him. “Everybody loves News,” which was what he called himself. Time meant nothing to him. Rules meant nothing. Money meant nothing. For being late, they started fining him <span class="math inline">\(1 a minute, then \)</span>5, then <span class="math inline">\(10. I think it got up to \)</span>50 a minute, but he didn’t care. They’d take the money out of his paycheck, but he knew that he’d usually get it back.</p>

<p>So much of what Marvin did was counterproductive to his career. He disdained practice. He stayed up all night. He didn’t listen to anyone about anything, but then he’d come out and play a great game. You’d see that and know that the gods had touched this man and made him a great player, only he had no idea what he had.</p>

<p>Marvin would walk into a game 20 minutes before it was time to start. People would be taped and ready to go out for warmups, and Marvin would stroll into the dressing room with all this food— steak and gravy, black-eyed peas, greens, mashed potatoes. He would be eating it while someone taped his ankles, then he’d tell the ballboy, “I got some women coming in tonight. I need five tickets—and get me some body lotion, too.”</p>

<p>“I’m a basketball player, not a monk. I play the women, I play the clothes, I play the cars, I play everything I can play. There’s players and there’s playees. The playees are the ones who get played on by the players. I’m a player.” Barnes also said, “I’m 22 and a 22-year-old kid ain’t no genius.” And he said, “I don’t want to act like an old man of 30 when I’m 22. But they keep telling me, ’You can’t make any more mistakes, Marvin. Don’t miss any more planes. Be on time, Marvin. Drink your milk, Marvin. Eat your vegetables, Marvin.’ I’m tired of being ’the franchise,’ and all those responsibilities.”</p>

<p>Marvin had a great night, 48 points. After the game, I saw him in the dressing room and he started giving me his State of the Spirits speech. He told me, “Bro, you know what’s wrong with this team? We don’t have any team play. We don’t care about each other.”</p>

<p>I thought, “Maybe Marvin is starting to see what the problem is—this team has no unity.”
Then Marvin continued, “Let me give you an example. Tonight, I had 48 points with two minutes to go. Did anybody pass me the ball so I could get 50? Huh? No, they just kept the ball to themselves and I got stuck at 48. Stuff like that; that’s what’s wrong with these guys.”</p>

<p>TLDR: Marvin Barnes was awesome</p>

<p>He also led the NBA in assists per game as a rookie before his career was derailed by injuries. There’s definitely a world where both he and Barnes are hall of famers and legends of the game</p>

      <label for="l9aul8n" class="commentText"><p>Bad News (Barnes’ nickname) was one of the most colorful of the many colorful characters in the ABA.</p>

<p>I’d love if there was a special with Bob Costas where he’d just discuss Marvin “Bad News” Barnes stories for an hour.  The ones in “Loose Balls” are pretty good.  (Costas was the radio announcer for the Spirits of St. Louis at the beginning of his broadcasting career, which coincided with Barnes’ time on the team.)  Some of the quotes in the original post above are from Costas in “Loose Balls”.</p>
