      <label for="l8zpa8l" class="commentText"><p>That’s more of a third option I feel. A second option needs to be able to create their offence on their own too, when #1 is on the bench. Look at the last few champs: Murray, Wiggins, Middleton, AD, Siakam, etc. All could create their own shot to some level. A third option usually doesn’t have that responsibility, and is more of a catch and shoot type of player (MPJ, Klay, etc)</p>

<p>Chet definitely can develop that but right now, my guess is a solid second option but absolutely perfect third option.</p>

<p>I dont think Chet could be a first option for a team. He doesnt seem to move well with the ball. A lot of his shot attempts outside the paint get good looks because of extra pressure on SGA, and he&rsquo;s too lanky for bully ball. I think he&rsquo;s an ideal third option.</p>

      <label for="l8yv914" class="commentText"><p>Yeah to be a 1st option as a big you have to have at least one of these 3 attributes, but to be in the upper echelons you usually have 2 of these. If you only have 1 of these you have to be generational to be considered the best</p>

<ol>
<li>Ability to dribble like an elite guard (ex: KD, Jokic, Dirk, Hakeem)</li>
<li>Strong enough to bully 99.9% of the league (ex: Embiid, Giannis, Jokic, Shaq)</li>
<li>An unstoppable shot/scoring ability (Jokic, Dirk, KD, Malone, Hakeem, Wilt, Embiid, Giannis)</li>
</ol>

<p>Currently he doesn&rsquo;t have any of these, he&rsquo;s got the makings to do it but some guys never get there. Jokic is so rare because he&rsquo;s got all of these attributes and he even has an elite playmaking ability to top it off.</p>

You could argue he&rsquo;s already close on #3, his release point is super high on his jumpers and he has good footwork like spin moves that take him from virtually the 3 point line to the rim. He just takes way fewer shots than a #1 option would right now for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>I think if he can tighten up handles, he&rsquo;d be in the conversation for having <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of your points, right now when he puts the ball on the floor it&rsquo;s still a little shaky.</p>

      <label for="l90z745" class="commentText"><p>I could see Chet looking like a diet Jokic offensively, Tim Duncan, or Bill Walton type. Anchoring a top flight defense, being the center point of the offense and making timely passes, hitting open shots, but maybe not being your top shot taker.</p>

<p>I think the idealized Chet would average like 18 PPG, 10 REB, 6.5 AST, 2.5 BLKs. He might not be the stat stuffer that SGA is but he could still become their best player. He’d basically be a walking 50 win team at that point (like Tim Duncan was). Remember, Steve Nash never took more than 13 shots a game at any point in his career. I don’t see Chet ever shooting more than 12-15 times a game but that doesn’t mean he can’t be an elite elite player.</p>

      <label for="l8yup5e" class="commentText"><p>The narrative gets often repeated that Aaron Gordon was a &ldquo;role player miscast as a star/1st option&rdquo; before coming to Denver, but it&rsquo;s not quite correct.</p>

<p>Gordon was an athletic high draft pick that might have been <em>expected</em> to develop into a #1/#2 option in Orlando, but the Magic never fully used him that way. From when he became a full-time starter in his 3rd year (2016-17), Gordon was 3rd-5th in USG% among the Magic&rsquo;s starters every season until he left Orlando mid-way through the 2020-21 season, <em>except for</em> 2017-18 where he was 2nd (just ahead of Evan Fournier), but then went back to being a lesser option after that.</p>

<p>Yes, he&rsquo;s scoring far more efficiently in Denver (.605 TS%) than in Orlando (.531 TS%), but that&rsquo;s a product of being on an overall better team, better shot selection (particularly going from 54.3% of his FGA in Orlando coming outside 10FT, to 35.9% in Denver), and getting better/smarter looks from an all-time playmaker teammate in Jokic. His volume of touches is virtually the same (19.3 USG% in Denver, 20.8 USG% in Orlando).</p>

<p>I think more accurately he was a role player <em>expected</em> to be a star, who never really got used like one or became one, who is a better fit playing his role on a better team.</p>

Most of the leagues best players were as big a question mark as Chet was after their rookie seasons. So while it’s a safe bet to say he won’t make it to that level as there is really only ever 5-10 players who are that good, you can’t just say no serious team wouldn’t try to see if Chet couldn’t become that. Given the rookie season Chet just had, every single team in the league would give him another 2 seasons to really see if he can blossom into that number 1 option role.</p>

      <label for="l904j0x" class="commentText"><p>lol honestly, Kyle Kuzma&rsquo;s time with the Wizards is what inspired my response. Like, <em>can</em> he be a #1? Sure, but it&rsquo;s as a tank commander. Not saying Chet as a #1 would necessarily result in a team being terrible, but seems far better suited being a #2 or 3 on a contender, much like Kuz was (for better or worse) in 2020.</p>

<p>Basically at his peak he can be an All NBA/All Defense player and #1 in terms of overall impact on a team while being 2nd option offensively. 99% of bigs are held back in that they can&rsquo;t create for themselves/others at the level of their star guard/wing counter parts.</p>

<p>AD’s strength, and I think this applies to Chet too, is just how amazingly compatible he is with #1 options. You could put a lot of #1s with Embiid and Jokic, but honestly some of them aren’t ideal for a variety of reasons. Every player in the league fits beautifully with AD, and I think Chet’s the same.</p>

<p>Wemby could ultimately be both. He can be a #1 and any #1 type of player would dream to have him</p>

<p>That’s a crazy statement. That’s essentially just KD at his defensive peak on the GSWs.</p>

<p>I think Chet’s going to be amazing, but I don’t think he’s going to Pingus with a handle on O and AD on defense good.</p>

If he’s your first option, the team is probably not going to the playoffs. 2nd option is realistic when he puts on more weight and expands his offensive toolset.

      <label for="l90n6hp" class="commentText"><p>Chet&rsquo;s game is much better suited to be the second or third option. The center position is very physically demanding, and frankly Jokic is the only center in recent memory that is the first offensive option on his team that doesn&rsquo;t get injured constantly. I think the best second or third option in the league is often more valuable overall than the 15th best first option. I&rsquo;d honestly value Bam Adebayo over Fox for instance (4th best Center vs like 8th best primary guard).</p>

Unless you have a time machine you don’t know how he’s going to develop, aside from that this year is probably the worst he’s going to be for many years to come.

He’s good as 2nd/3rd option, it’s where he can play his way and thrive. Pushing him to be 1st choice would result in a decent team but not a contender in any way. Lacks passing ability and handles that guys like Jokic and Wemby have that makes them so versatile that they can be the 1st option at the 5.</p>

<p>His best bet of those 3 is to improve his mobility and handles to the point where he can create his own shot but that would take an insane amount of improvement and is unlikely imo</p>

<p>Much more likely is just being a 2nd or 3rd option as a spacing big with elite defense.</p>

<p>To be a one you need to somehow be able to take over games on your own creating your own shot, or somehow also be able to facilitate. Either i&rsquo;ve just watched too little of Chet but it doesn&rsquo;t seem like he&rsquo;s that, or anywhere close to that yet. He looks good playing next to SGA but as the 1 i don&rsquo;t think thats where he shines</p>

<p>I view that as a guy that has/can be the best player on a championship team.</p>

<p>LeBron, Steph, Kawhi, KD, Jokic, Giannis. Tatum or Luka will join the club this year, and I think the other has a chance to do it in the future. Wemby. Possibly ANT. We&rsquo;ll see with Embiid, but it&rsquo;s not looking good.</p>

<p>Do I think Chet has that potential. No way. On a for real, for real title contender, I think his ceiling is a #3.</p>

      <label for="l8yja9j" class="commentText"><p>I honestly don&rsquo;t think he will ever be able to be a #1 on a team that is looking to win a championship.  Physically I think he could develop the tools to do so. He&rsquo;s already got a lot of them. But mentally he doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the kind of player to demand the ball when the team needs him to step up and take command.  I see him much more as a Lauri Markennen type player who will end up being a great complimentary player to a ball dominant #1.</p>

      <label for="l8yrv7e" class="commentText"><p>Chet would be quite miscast as a number one option on offense. He just doesn&rsquo;t have the creation ability. He turns it over a lot from ball-handling, isn&rsquo;t a particularly good passer, and is not a strong 3p% shooter off pullups and self-created looks.</p>

<p>However, he has really nice catch-and-shoot numbers, even more so for a big. He&rsquo;s good in the midrange, too. He&rsquo;s a good finisher at the rim, and great on drives. He&rsquo;s already an excellent play finisher everywhere on the court.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to see him on a championship-level team as the best defender and second best offensive player. And then if he&rsquo;s your 3rd best offensive player, well you&rsquo;ve probably got one of the best offenses in the league (OKC were already 3rd in DRTG and 4th in ORTG this season). He&rsquo;s already an All-Star level player.</p>

      <label for="l8ywotr" class="commentText"><p>I loved the parallel that KOC drew to Pau Gasol, because it fits: Chet really is the modern day Pau, and I think that&rsquo;s what makes him the perfect 2nd guy to a playmaking wing. High BBIQ, good combo of length and mobility, good finishing, unselfish. </p>

<p>Wemby&rsquo;s got a generationally high ceiling, but Chet looked like the ROTY front runner for the first half of the season for a good reason. A rookie / 2nd year being the second best player on a legit contender doesn&rsquo;t happen very often at all. </p>

<p>Hoping he goes up a level and becomes the  consistent 50/40/90 guy on bigger usage that we were teased at earlier in the season.</p>

<p>If he’s the second option, you’re going to be a contender.</p>

<p>If he’s the third option, your team is most likely going to win a ring eventually.</p>

<p>Main issue with him being a number 1 option is that he can’t carry the ball and create for himself, it’s just not his game.</p>

<p>I’m a Magic fan and obviously biased but I thought Paolo absolutely showed he’s a number one that you can build a team around. He took over games for long stretches and put the team on his back. I think both teams got the correct fit because OKC already has shae and they don’t need a number one.</p>

<p>I’m not saying Paolo is better, but he’s definitely better for our team and any team that needs an alpha dog.</p>

Chet is big and plays good defense, can and will get bigger so has to see how that affects his mobility/etc. He can shoot the ball well and he’s aggressive so those are already type of qualities I think can make someone a first option on a team.</p>

But from a scale of Westbrook (great first option, mid second or third) to Klay (mid first option likely but unbelievable 2 or 3), i think his game itself is more suited for the Klay style. But imo he could be more like Dirant, Steph as great at both.</p>

Think about it, SGA is probably still going to be on similar MVP volume, Jalen was damn near averaging 20 already and is a ball handling creator. Chet will be taking bail out reps as a ball handler at best in this team and then rolling/popping. His numbers will be hard capped in my eyes</p>

      <label for="l900lz5" class="commentText"><p>The shot creation/playmaking threshold to be a lead offensive option for a title contender is really really high, and hard to meet for a big, so the safe bet is “no” - at this point we really only have Giannis, Jokic, and Embiid in that tier amongst bigs. A bunch of great offensive players - AD, Sabonis, KAT, Sengun, Banchero - aren’t there yet or couldn’t make it. Wemby probably will in the future but also isn’t there yet. There aren’t many of these guys!</p>

<p>Besides, Chet’s rim protection and the defensive role he’s going to have to play on a contender probably indicate that he fits better as a #2 or secondary creator on a truly elite team, anyways. He could probably be a primary creator for a good team - but it’s not really optimal, and I don’t think that’s a title team.</p>

      <label for="l90aobz" class="commentText"><p>It’s not impossible, he had probably a top 5 rookie season of the last 20 years. I think he is best as #2 or 3 on a good team. Needs to add muscle for sure and work on inside post game. I think his ceiling is not MVP level but maybe, depending on how high SGA can take them, elite #2 level a la Pippen/Worthy/etc. like a great Robin to SGA’s Batman</p>

      <label for="l90fy03" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s difficult for any big man to be a #1 option on a contender. Embiid is showing why - he&rsquo;s a great player, but a defense can scheme to take away a big man, or at least limit his efficiency so he&rsquo;s no longer a great option. The only exception is Jokic, but that&rsquo;s because he plays almost as a point center, so the focus isn&rsquo;t on his own scoring.</p>

      <label for="l90hjao" class="commentText"><p>He can definitely be #1 on a team - not sure if he can be the #1 on a championship team though.</p>

<p>For the Thunder, SGA and Jdub will be taking the most shots anyways so unless if they are injured or gifted to another team ala-Harden, Chet won&rsquo;t be the #1.</p>

<p>If he can be a healthier Garnett (Celtics) with better shot and comparable defensive impact - whilst he wouldn&rsquo;t be the #1 scorer, he can be one of the most important players (and on some nights, the most important player) for OKC - which I personally prefer for him and the Thunder</p>

      <label for="l90jfbu" class="commentText"><p>I can’t imagine him becoming a true #1 on a title team - my bar for that is extremely high</p>

<p>Chet’s strength is that his game is perfectly crafted to be that 3rd option who amplifies your first option and all the other guys while giving you elite defense. Even if that makes him the third option, these types of guys are often more valuable than your 2nd option and are the most desirable players in the league because they fit everywhere</p>

When you look at his measurables, his on court production from his rookie season, you are a seeing someone who looks like they can very much be a high level two way star. Shooting looks good, passing looks good, &ldquo;BBIQ,&rdquo; and of course you can&rsquo;t teach being 7&rsquo; tall. Good dexterity for a big and he&rsquo;s sure to get physically stronger over the next few years.</p>

<p>I strongly believe he will grow into the kind of player who can be the best player a winning team.</p>

People really seriously underestimate his play making abilities and how much burden was put on his shoulders this year as the thunders only viable center. People also are sleeping on how good his rookie season was because of Wemby, okc not being a big market team, and his limited offensive ROLE on the team. Real ones know how good Chet is. The people who knew about him when he was the number one high school player in the country, etc. The average commenter here on Reddit is not that person though.</p>
