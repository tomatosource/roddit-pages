      <label for="l8zpa8l" class="commentText"><p>That’s more of a third option I feel. A second option needs to be able to create their offence on their own too, when #1 is on the bench. Look at the last few champs: Murray, Wiggins, Middleton, AD, Siakam, etc. All could create their own shot to some level. A third option usually doesn’t have that responsibility, and is more of a catch and shoot type of player (MPJ, Klay, etc)</p>

<p>Chet definitely can develop that but right now, my guess is a solid second option but absolutely perfect third option.</p>

<p>I dont think Chet could be a first option for a team. He doesnt seem to move well with the ball. A lot of his shot attempts outside the paint get good looks because of extra pressure on SGA, and he&rsquo;s too lanky for bully ball. I think he&rsquo;s an ideal third option.</p>

      <label for="l8yv914" class="commentText"><p>Yeah to be a 1st option as a big you have to have at least one of these 3 attributes, but to be in the upper echelons you usually have 2 of these. If you only have 1 of these you have to be generational to be considered the best</p>

<ol>
<li>Ability to dribble like an elite guard (ex: KD, Jokic, Dirk, Hakeem)</li>
<li>Strong enough to bully 99.9% of the league (ex: Embiid, Giannis, Jokic, Shaq)</li>
<li>An unstoppable shot/scoring ability (Jokic, Dirk, KD, Malone, Hakeem, Wilt, Embiid, Giannis)</li>
</ol>

<p>Currently he doesn&rsquo;t have any of these, he&rsquo;s got the makings to do it but some guys never get there. Jokic is so rare because he&rsquo;s got all of these attributes and he even has an elite playmaking ability to top it off.</p>

      <label for="l8yup5e" class="commentText"><p>The narrative gets often repeated that Aaron Gordon was a &ldquo;role player miscast as a star/1st option&rdquo; before coming to Denver, but it&rsquo;s not quite correct.</p>

<p>Gordon was an athletic high draft pick that might have been <em>expected</em> to develop into a #1/#2 option in Orlando, but the Magic never fully used him that way. From when he became a full-time starter in his 3rd year (2016-17), Gordon was 3rd-5th in USG% among the Magic&rsquo;s starters every season until he left Orlando mid-way through the 2020-21 season, <em>except for</em> 2017-18 where he was 2nd (just ahead of Evan Fournier), but then went back to being a lesser option after that.</p>

<p>Yes, he&rsquo;s scoring far more efficiently in Denver (.605 TS%) than in Orlando (.531 TS%), but that&rsquo;s a product of being on an overall better team, better shot selection (particularly going from 54.3% of his FGA in Orlando coming outside 10FT, to 35.9% in Denver), and getting better/smarter looks from an all-time playmaker teammate in Jokic. His volume of touches is virtually the same (19.3 USG% in Denver, 20.8 USG% in Orlando).</p>

<p>I think more accurately he was a role player <em>expected</em> to be a star, who never really got used like one or became one, who is a better fit playing his role on a better team.</p>

He was given that freedom, but the degree of difficulty for his usage in Orlando was asked to be closer to a #1 option, where you can have the same usage and be a #3 or #4 (catch &amp; shoot, lob, or be a rotational passer).</p>

<p>Your point of determine what a #1 option is based on usage % is terrible and I&rsquo;m not going to change my stance on this.</p>

<p>And to be clear, I never said he was Orlando&rsquo;s #1. I said we tried to force him to be that. That Orlando team had no #1 because all of the offense was deeply flawed. Vuc couldn&rsquo;t generate free throws, Gordon couldn&rsquo;t deal with double teams, and Fournier wasn&rsquo;t skilled enough at really anything.</p>

Sure, but it&rsquo;s as a tank commander. Not saying Chet as a #1 would necessarily result in a team being terrible, but seems far better suited being a #2 or 3 on a contender, much like Kuz was (for better or worse) in 2020.</p>

      <label for="l8yp6uu" class="commentText"><p>If you look at the players in the league who are <em>currently</em> #1 option on a championship team material, it’s really only Luka and KD and maybe embiid that were obviously going to be of that caliber after their rookie seasons.. Most of the leagues best players were as big a question mark as Chet was after their rookie seasons. So while it’s a safe bet to say he won’t make it to that level as there is really only ever 5-10 players who are that good, you can’t just say no serious team wouldn’t try to see if Chet couldn’t become that. Given the rookie season Chet just had, every single team in the league would give him another 2 seasons to really see if he can blossom into that number 1 option role.</p>

The common mistake, which you are making and that’s ok, is seeing what a player does their rookie season, see how they were used their rookie season, and project out based on that, instead of projecting out based on their skill set.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re absolutley right, judging a player off their secon&hellip;err.. first year is a fools errand but its fun to speculate.</p>

<p>Based off what Chet has shown this year, he can&rsquo;t be a first option</p>

<p>Heres some paper stats of his 6 games played without SGA.</p>

<p>4.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>.6 FG 43%
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>.8 3P 26%
1.1 APG
2.5 TOV

<p>He wasn&rsquo;t the 1st option in college, nor has he shown the scoring ability to be a 1st option ever.</p>

<p>(There&rsquo;s a difference between being efficient in a 2nd option role where you don&rsquo;t need to create your own shot as much</p>

<p>And being a 1st option who has to create their own shot consistently.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s more a Nash than a harden basically, he can be the best player on a team but I don&rsquo;t see hin ever being the 1st option on a team</p>

If he’s your first option, the team is probably not going to the playoffs. 2nd option is realistic when he puts on more weight and expands his offensive toolset.

Unless you have a time machine you don’t know how he’s going to develop, aside from that this year is probably the worst he’s going to be for many years to come. Just ask yourself what you would have said about Shai after his rookie year if someone asked you the same question.</p>

He’s good as 2nd/3rd option, it’s where he can play his way and thrive. Pushing him to be 1st choice would result in a decent team but not a contender in any way. Lacks passing ability and handles that guys like Jokic and Wemby have that makes them so versatile that they can be the 1st option at the 5.</p>

<p>If you’re not very mobile you at least need to be strong and/or have elite playmaking to be a #1 as a big, neither of which he has.</p>

      <label for="l8ynfjd" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s mobile enough to consistently guard guards on the perimeter and handle the ball in transition. But, he&rsquo;s a rookie on a team good enough to be the #1 seed in one of the toughest Western conferences in NBA history. They didn&rsquo;t need him to consistently create his own shot like typical top draft picks. The skillset was there, though, so let&rsquo;s see how he develops in the next few years. There are countless HOFers and future HOFers that weren&rsquo;t primary shot creators their rookie years.</p>

      <label for="l8yo5hb" class="commentText"><p>To be a number 1 option as a big you have to either be able to create your own shot, bully your way to the basket, or be an elite facilitator. Ideally more than one of those. Chet has none.</p>

<p>His best bet of those 3 is to improve his mobility and handles to the point where he can create his own shot but that would take an insane amount of improvement and is unlikely imo</p>

<p>Much more likely is just being a 2nd or 3rd option as a spacing big with elite defense.</p>

      <label for="l8yuo1a" class="commentText"><p>Yeah i have the same opinion.</p>

<p>To be a one you need to somehow be able to take over games on your own creating your own shot, or somehow also be able to facilitate. Either i&rsquo;ve just watched too little of Chet but it doesn&rsquo;t seem like he&rsquo;s that, or anywhere close to that yet. He looks good playing next to SGA but as the 1 i don&rsquo;t think thats where he shines</p>

Physically I think he could develop the tools to do so. He&rsquo;s already got a lot of them. But mentally he doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the kind of player to demand the ball when the team needs him to step up and take command.  I see him much more as a Lauri Markennen type player who will end up being a great complimentary player to a ball dominant #1.</p>

      <label for="l8yrv7e" class="commentText"><p>Chet would be quite miscast as a number one option on offense. He just doesn&rsquo;t have the creation ability. He turns it over a lot from ball-handling, isn&rsquo;t a particularly good passer, and is not a strong 3p% shooter off pullups and self-created looks.</p>

<p>However, he has really nice catch-and-shoot numbers, even more so for a big. He&rsquo;s good in the midrange, too. He&rsquo;s a good finisher at the rim, and great on drives. He&rsquo;s already an excellent play finisher everywhere on the court.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to see him on a championship-level team as the best defender and second best offensive player. And then if he&rsquo;s your 3rd best offensive player, well you&rsquo;ve probably got one of the best offenses in the league (OKC were already 3rd in DRTG and 4th in ORTG this season). He&rsquo;s already an All-Star level player.</p>

      <label for="l8ywotr" class="commentText"><p>I loved the parallel that KOC drew to Pau Gasol, because it fits: Chet really is the modern day Pau, and I think that&rsquo;s what makes him the perfect 2nd guy to a playmaking wing. High BBIQ, good combo of length and mobility, good finishing, unselfish. </p>

<p>Wemby&rsquo;s got a generationally high ceiling, but Chet looked like the ROTY front runner for the first half of the season for a good reason. A rookie / 2nd year being the second best player on a legit contender doesn&rsquo;t happen very often at all. </p>

<p>Hoping he goes up a level and becomes the  consistent 50/40/90 guy on bigger usage that we were teased at earlier in the season.</p>

<p>I’m a Magic fan and obviously biased but I thought Paolo absolutely showed he’s a number one that you can build a team around. He took over games for long stretches and put the team on his back. I think both teams got the correct fit because OKC already has shae and they don’t need a number one.</p>

<p>I’m not saying Paolo is better, but he’s definitely better for our team and any team that needs an alpha dog.</p>

But from a scale of Westbrook (great first option, mid second or third) to Klay (mid first option likely but unbelievable 2 or 3), i think his game itself is more suited for the Klay style. But imo he could be more like Dirant, Steph as great at both.</p>

Think about it, SGA is probably still going to be on similar MVP volume, Jalen was damn near averaging 20 already and is a ball handling creator. Chet will be taking bail out reps as a ball handler at best in this team and then rolling/popping. His numbers will be hard capped in my eyes</p>

If we say his prime was his years at the Pels and his first year with the Lakers (I&rsquo;d disagree that those are his prime years, but whatever) then he either had shitty teams, went up against the literal best team ever in the Warriors, or played with the only guy who could possibly make him a second option in LeBron.</p>

      <label for="l900lz5" class="commentText"><p>The shot creation/playmaking threshold to be a lead offensive option for a title contender is really really high, and hard to meet for a big, so the safe bet is “no” - at this point we really only have Giannis, Jokic, and Embiid in that tier amongst bigs. A bunch of great offensive players - AD, Sabonis, KAT, Sengun, Banchero - aren’t there yet or couldn’t make it. Wemby probably will in the future but also isn’t there yet. There aren’t many of these guys!</p>

<p>Besides, Chet’s rim protection and the defensive role he’s going to have to play on a contender probably indicate that he fits better as a #2 or secondary creator on a truly elite team, anyways. He could probably be a primary creator for a good team - but it’s not really optimal, and I don’t think that’s a title team.</p>

<p>I view that as a guy that has/can be the best player on a championship team.</p>

<p>LeBron, Steph, Kawhi, KD, Jokic, Giannis. Tatum or Luka will join the club this year, and I think the other has a chance to do it in the future. Wemby. Possibly ANT. We&rsquo;ll see with Embiid, but it&rsquo;s not looking good.</p>

<p>Do I think Chet has that potential. No way. On a for real, for real title contender, I think his ceiling is a #3.</p>

      <label for="l8yjd7n" class="commentText"><p>I think he can and will be a number one someday. His ceiling is mvp of the league. People really seriously underestimate his play making abilities and how much burden was put on his shoulders this year as the thunders only viable center. People also are sleeping on how good his rookie season was because of Wemby, okc not being a big market team, and his limited offensive ROLE on the team. Real ones know how good Chet is. The people who knew about him when he was the number one high school player in the country, etc. The average commenter here on Reddit is not that person though.</p>
