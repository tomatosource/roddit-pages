</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Any examples where a particular player, All NBA level or at least Defensive team level player got absolutely cooked in a series which people began to call him overrated. The recent one that I recalled was Jrue Holiday getting absolutely murdered on every possession by Jimmy Butler who took the assignment on guarding Jimmy on an island. His reputation took a hit and people called for his head.</p>

<p>And an older example is David Robinson getting destroyed by Hakeem which really tainted his legacy especially when compared with other great centers.</p>

Also if he didn’t try to hold the team hostage the next season his rep wouldn’t have taken the hit it did. He handles the entire situation like an A hole and people just held him accountable.</p>

      <label for="ln7oq38" class="commentText"><p>I think his refusal to shoot 3s is also telling. To just refuse to shoot them or work at it indicates that he&rsquo;s not willing to get out of his comfort zone in certain areas. You don&rsquo;t see it often in guys at this level because the league weeds them out, but in Ben&rsquo;s case his other talents (and the work he put into him) carried him into the spotlight where he got exposed. Then rather than admit he&rsquo;s got some mental hurdles to get over, he assumed a defensive stance in the PR battle, which again, was an example of just refusing to engage in things outside his comfort zone.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a shame. I think we&rsquo;ve all dealt with similar issues at some point in our lives so I sympathize, but the league isn&rsquo;t really the place for a brittle mentality. I&rsquo;d like to see him overcome his issues but he makes it hard to root for him.</p>

      <label for="ln6nu46" class="commentText"><p>This is why there’s hope for Embiid because you can choke every playoffs, as long as you have 1 good run, people would respect you.</p>

<p>Giannis is another example. Choked against Toronto, choked against Heat in the bubble, choked against Heat again 1st losing to 8th seed, injured this yr against Pacers, but because she has that 1 chip with 50 in Game 7, he is respected. Other wise he would be known as a bigger choker than Embiid.</p>

The Heat held top players like Tatum, Brunson and Brown to similar or worse stats. Don’t think you can call him a choker. The only one with a solid argument imo is 2020 Heat</p>

The closest parallel to Embiid is probably Chris Paul and honestly even without a championship people are starting to just respect what he brought now that his career is winding down. At the height of your prime, hate will always be there.</p>

<p>Tracy McGrady never made it out of the first round but he still gets talked about with so much nostalgia. Time will take away all the slander regardless.</p>

      <label for="lndlpax" class="commentText"><p>Giannis is far from a perennial choker, in fact he is one if the fee players that elevate in tbe playoffs. The raptors walled up on him and forced bledsoe to shoot, they adjusted to bucks offense and bud couldnt follow. The bubble one is the only choke job, but even then he dominated. He was too injured to play and came back hobbling in game 4-5, and didn’t play the pacers at all. Against the celtics he was shorthanded without Middleton and still took them to 7. Yall say any L is a choke at the point, what a joke.</p>

<p>Embiid or pg13 those you could say that often underperform in the playoffs to their high standards in the regular season</p>

Losing 4 straight games in the 06 Finals and the next year the 1st round loss to the warriors in his MVP year in 07. After that he was looked at as a soft euro who couldn’t win. After that 2011 chip he was being talked about as a top 20 all time guy. It was crazy how quickly the narrative flipped.</p>

      <label for="ln7oust" class="commentText"><p>Booker&rsquo;s funny because he was called a fraud for most of his early career. Nobody gave a shit about his 70 pt game against the celtics, everyone said he was just stat chasing in a loss. When the suns became contenders people started to talk about him as a top 10 player, but after so many disappointing playoff loses he&rsquo;s been put on fraud watch again. The Olympics helped his reputation a bit but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s totally beaten the fraud allegations in many people&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

      <label for="lndmiib" class="commentText"><p>To be fair it was warranted, imagine a 2x mvp averaging 18-7-7 (2 points per fourth quarter) on terrible efficiienxy. He went from lebron to evan turner for 5 games(he was great in game 1)</p>

<p>Losing to an old mavs team with two lost games where they had 10+ point leads in the fourth. He even has a single digit scoring game which was unheard of and kind of unfathomable now looking back at how consistent he is now</p>

Looney and monk canceled because they played beyond their abilities. So Sabonis underperforming shouldn&rsquo;t be a massive issue considering klay and Poole were arguably worse than sabonis that series. Also dray got suspended up 2-0 no excuses</p>

<p>People need to be more suspicious of offensively-oriented big men who can&rsquo;t play great defense. Year after year, we see these guys fold in the playoffs unless their name is Nikola Jokic. And we see guys like AD, Bam, and Draymond excel.</p>

      <label for="ln6mjs8" class="commentText"><p>I remember Dirk getting a lot of crap for losing to Miami in the finals. He averaged like 22 on 39%, but it might have been because he sucked in the playoffs the year before too. Tmac killed him, he only managed to get to 21 on 35% Shooting feasting on Ryan Bowen; Tmac had him in cuffs. Mavs outplayed Tmac’s help enough to skill allow Dirk to win the series but the matchup was incredibly lopsided. Obviously he redeemed himself in 2011, but he had that choker tag for a while there.</p>

<p>Contrast that to 1-2 lowlights of Gobert completely overturning his reputation and exaggerating dumb narratives. It&rsquo;s nowhere like that for Jrue even though he was abused for multiple games, not just a few lowlights</p>

<p>Also breaking up AG-Jokic lobs&hellip;Jokic was abusing AD with that over and over in the Lakers series.</p>

<p>Tell me you didn&rsquo;t watch him without telling me you didn&rsquo;t watch him.</p>

Last year in the play in game the Warriors lost, but Sabonis wasn’t as much of a factor in the win as you’d hope for, and Pels destroyed the Kings the next game.</p>

      <label for="lnayokq" class="commentText"><p>Jrue Holiday proved himself again last year by winning another ring with Boston, so I don&rsquo;t think most knowledgeable fans think of him as overrated on D. I&rsquo;d say he was just misused against Miami. Jrue is a 6&rsquo;4&rdquo; combo guard, can handle most guards, and can especially bully PGs with his size. Butler is 6&rsquo;7&rdquo;, started his career as a wing, and is now more of a combo forward&hellip; so I think it&rsquo;s not using Jrue&rsquo;s natural strengths to try and have him match up with Butler.</p>
