      <label for="la34ycy" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think so. Jarret Allen is a very good player but I think there are legitimate questions about his fit starting next to Mobley. I know Mobley shot 36% from three last year but I think he’s better at the center than the 4. Their offense also looked a little better at times when they put Mobley at the 5 and surrounded him with 4 shooters.</p>

<p>If they can get trade allen for some picks and a good 4 that can space the floor next to Mobley then it might be something they should consider </p>

      <label for="la37szb" class="commentText"><p>Yeah Mobley did, on like 1 attempt every 4 games for the majority of the season.</p>

<p>It wasnt until after the All Star break where he actively looked to shoot 1-2 per game so that&rsquo;s why his attempt number is even above 1.</p>

<p>Its not a Jarrett Allen problem, its Mobley not adapting his game to being a stretch 4 that is making the pairing not optimized. I am not trading Jarrett Allen for peanuts because Mobley is reluctant to shoot. Dumb dumb dumb</p>

      <label for="la3by14" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think that Mobley isn&rsquo;t adapting, I just don&rsquo;t think that his development has panned out the way they wanted. They paired them based on the projection that Mobley&rsquo;s flashes of guard skills would translate to eventually being a stretch big you can pair with a traditional 5, and that hasn&rsquo;t happened.</p>

<p>He just doesn&rsquo;t work at the 4 and, save some increasingly unlikely development, he won&rsquo;t work there in the future. There&rsquo;s no way around that. Despite that, he&rsquo;s still the younger, more versatile option with a higher ceiling and so they&rsquo;ve gotta trade Allen.</p>

      <label for="la3dj96" class="commentText"><p>As a cavs fan im happy with the development though in his shot. Best 3pt % of his career this year and almost +5% on his ft this year. We can’t expect him to be a stretch 4, but hes getting better.</p>

<p>If we can’t return much for jarrett theres no reason to trade, but i wouldn’t mind seeing more mobley at the 5. However I think part of the uniqueness of our roster is the two big men, mobley is still 23 and its not uncommon for big men to develop jumpers. I’d like to stick it out another year and see what can happen as mobley improves.</p>

<p>Edit: And honestly we played as well as anybody did against the celtics. Going to seven against the magic wasn’t ideal but we could really only learn so much about our team from this postseason after drawing celtics second round.</p>

Im not aware of too many guards who have dramatixally improved like someone like brook lopez or al horford has when adding shooting. Most bigs never had to shoot in hs and college so it makes sense to me ig.</p>

<p>turns out allen is better then mobley</p>

<p>it pretty well known the team is really bad without allen defensively which is there strength. if im not mistaken W/L and stats very strongly point that out. also mobley cant play 5 on defense at least not until hes a lot bigger. i think it would be a mistake to change the teams identity when they are already good as is.</p>

So it’s really just a demand problem, teams that want to win now, don’t already have a non shooter, who also need a C, who have a player that the Cavs would even want. JA is good at what he does, (rim run, protect the rim, rebound), but is limited in other avenues (can get bullied by other bigs, no offensive self creation, spotty playoff history, non shooter).</p>

<p>To be clear, I love JA, and most teams would be lucky to have him as their starting C, but I can see how teams/fans could be a little hesitant</p>

<p>For every Gafford/Zubac/Claxton/Hartenstein there are dozens of Tristan Vukcevic&rsquo;s. Not to mention all those guys are considered untouchable by the teams that have them with <em>maybe</em> the exception of Claxton, and only because he&rsquo;s on a non-contending team. The price to trade for him will be steep, even if he&rsquo;s available.</p>

<p>Vucevic is untradable because of his approaching the other side of his prime while being on a terrible contract.</p>

<p>Andre Drummond is languishing because of his downsides outweighing his upsides (bad decision making, turnover prone, <em>tendency to injure his own teammates with extremely boneheaded plays</em>).</p>

      <label for="la30160" class="commentText"><p>It’s more about how teams treat spacing, more than actual shooters. If defenses sag off all your role players, they make it much harder for your stars to score/play make, your bigs to get to the rim, passing lanes, etc. and the team that don’t have at least 4 shooters in their best line ups, tend to struggle in the playoffs. Some of it can be somewhat outweighed if you have the best player (Luka, giannis jokic), but most teams don’t. And even their teams follow that. The mavs saw that in the finals, but had success in the playoffs before then because their defenders that teams sagged off suddenly started hitting shots. Celtics are the best example, Denver starting 5, OKC, Knicks, when healthy even the clippers bucks and Philly</p>

Watching the Spurs all season long it was very apparent how much better other teams were able to adjust to Wemby cause the entire Spurs roster is just not very good shooting from three. Givony said it best recently during an interview discussing that the Spurs need to add outside shooting, &ldquo;as soon as Wemby puts the ball down to the ground, the entire defense collapses on him&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Defenses were able to send up to 3 guys at Victor because they could take the risk of leaving other Spurs players open. The Spurs only had 3 players shoot at least 35% or better from outside, no other team in the entire league had less than 5!</p>

      <label for="la3duvx" class="commentText"><p>Draymond is not a non-shooter, he’s shot 2-4 3pa per game basically his entire career. Being a not-good shooter is VERY different than being a NON-shooter that won’t/can’t shoot even when wide open.</p>

<p>Not to mention, Draymond is an extremely high-IQ player with great playmaking abilities (which 99% of non-shooters aren’t typically), which means that if you sag too hard of him he’s great at using that advantage to get Curry a good look (DHO or similar action).</p>

<p>As a Warriors fan I’d expect you of all people could understand these things, Dray literally scored 37 off of 8 3pm in a single playoff game. Also had games scoring 32 and 28 in THE FINALS off of 6 and 5 3pm.</p>

Ultimately, the guards just couldn&rsquo;t take or make enough 3&rsquo;s in those lineups for the scheme to be effective. Think you need Steph/Klay level gunners to make up for the lack of shooting at other positions.</p>

The only team who didn&rsquo;t have that might have been the 2022 Warriors and obviously they&rsquo;re an outlier shooting wise.  Not having 4-out spacing or better eliminates you from contention, period.</p>

      <label for="la31ves" class="commentText"><p>Yes. But everyone else in their line up can shoot. That’s the point lol you can have 1 non shooter in today’s nba. It’s why huerters shooting troubles hurt them so much this year. Why fox’s improved shooting last year along with Murray’s emergence as a shooter made them look so offensive great. Having a C that can shoot (jokic embiid, KAT, Myles turner, Porzingis) allows you to play your non shooter at the different position, like a defensive wing or guard.</p>

I just look at the number of teams that would want him and think it’s similar to Caruso - what he can do isn’t all in the stat box.  He’s an elite screen setter and he’ll set you five million screens a game.  Guards want that.  He fights on every play for whatever the team needs.  Do we need someone to get an offensive board right now?  He’s got it.  Do we need someone to get a clutch block?  He’s got it.  His contract is $20MM a year for two more years - great value.  He can score and pass better than the team needs him to.  There’s a lot of value there, I just want to make sure my own front office sees it!</p>

<p>For a complete non-shooting big man playing 32mpg, 10rpg and 1.2bpg aren’t great numbers. They’re actually very middle of the pack.</p>

<p>I think he’s solid but you seem to be overrating him quite a bit? Contenders can’t/don’t play 2 non-shooters and I’d assume Cavs fans would rather trade JA than Mobley no?</p>

      <label for="la4836j" class="commentText"><p>Look at how he played without Mobley.  He can do more than what the Cavs give him.  He’s not an offensive option for us but has the capability to score very efficiently.  He gets less rebounds because he’s playing beside Mobley.  That doesn’t mean he should be traded away, just means he is better than his stats reflect.</p>

      <label for="la338wv" class="commentText"><p>Because people think the Cavaliers are desperate to offload on him due to Mobley&rsquo;s emergence. Same way they think the Cavaliers are in a rush to offload Garland due to his injuries and Mitchell&rsquo;s prominence.</p>

<p>While the Caviliers are in win now mode, talent is rare in the league. It&rsquo;s far better to have all-star talents figure it out than to dump them for solid role players with limited ceilings. If they can&rsquo;t get talent as good as Allen or Garland, they&rsquo;re better off keeping them and hoping for a 2023-2024 Timberwolves esque run.</p>

But don’t trade just because you think the lineups won’t work. Let the new coaching try and if it’s not working, you can move at the deadline.</p>

<p>No reason to get super desperate and blow shit up for bad trades. Donovan clearly likes JA as well and I’m not sure trading away a well liked player by the guy you’re trying to to extend is a great idea</p>

      <label for="la3mci4" class="commentText"><p>Three simple reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>His fit next to Mobley. The league is going 5 out and the Celtics and Mavs  showed them the limitations of twin big lineups. Mobley is the franchise star, moving Allen allows his development as an interior force and better floor spacing for him and everyone else.</p></li>

<li><p>His playoff performances.. he has been underwhelming in the post season even admitting the lights were too bright for him</p></li>

<li><p>Getting value for him before his last year of his contract. I don&rsquo;t think they will just trade him for nothing but this is when you can get the best value for him</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you look at where the league has moved with teams like OKC and the Celtics dominating their conferences with versatile big men and 5 out spacing it diminishes the value of guys like Allen in modern roster construction. He is good enough to win regular season games and get you to the playoffs but a team building a contender team he isn&rsquo;t the ideal fit next to Mobley and mobley has more upside so he goes</p>

      <label for="la2zeht" class="commentText"><p>First, he is absolutely not worth double his salary, and he is not a top 10 defender.</p>

<p>But more importantly, it doesn&rsquo;t actually matter how good he is. What matters is how likely the Cavs are to trade him, and how many teams are willing to trade significant assets for him. </p>

<p>The Cavs seem likely to trade him. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine that Allen + Mobley is the best way for them to allocate their resources, he is way more likely to be traded than Mobley, there seemed to be some ill feelings there after the playoff series, and if they do try with him for one more year, and it doesn&rsquo;t work out, his value will be even lower. So trading him makes a lot of sense. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, non-shooters who aren&rsquo;t stars in the NBA have a pretty clear limit on how valuable they can be, and he just isn&rsquo;t a fit on a lot of teams since most teams don&rsquo;t play two traditional bigs. Any team with a non-shooter is immediately not a fit. That includes teams with a non-shooting big, and also teams with a non-shooting guard. </p>

<p>Add in some of the new cap restrictions limiting the mechanisms that can be used to move him, and you end up with a team that wants to move a guy without a particularly robust market. </p>

<p>They have to let one of them go .they have been quite patient and tried to make it work so many times ,this year should be the last giving they have a new coaching staff coming in .after that , a trade is inevitable</p>

<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of wild speculation because the Cavs are likely (as they should be) considering all options.</p>

<p>Allen is entering year 4 of a 5 year contract. His value is diminished without an extension sign and trade. As a rental, he&rsquo;s not highly desirable.</p>

      </div>
      <label for="la3slho" class="commentText"><p>Agreed, I made a mock nba trade essentially getting JA to the Clippers. I think Allen&rsquo;s value is as high as Paul George.</p>

<p>Trade went something like</p>

<p>Orlando gives- Wendell, Cole, 1 or 2 future 1st rd picks (to the Cavs)<br>
Orlando receives- Darius Garland</p>

<p>Cleveland gives- Darius (to Orlando), JA (to Clippers), Levert ( to Clippers to save a bit more space and re-sign Okoro)<br>
Cleveland receives- PG13, Wendell, Cole, 1 or 2 future picks from Orlando</p>

<p>Clippers gives- PG13 (to the Cavs)<br>
Clippers receives- Jarret Allen, Levert.</p>

<p>New teams would look something like</p>

<p>Orlando- Garland, Suggs, Franz, Paolo, FA C (possibly Claxton, Mo Bamba) or Goga (the Magic need to re-sign him regardless).</p>

<p>Bench- AB, Jett/Gary, Bench SF (possibly Joe Ingles or Caleb), Moe, JI.</p>

<p>Cleveland- Don, Struss/Okoro, Paul George, Wendell, Mobley.</p>

<p>Bench- Cole, Struss/Okoro, B SF(Niang?), Wade, B C/ TT.</p>

<p>Clippers- Harden(assuming Harden takes a cheaper contract) or a FA Guard/Russ, Norm/Mann/Levert, Kawhi, PJ, FA, JA.</p>

<p>Bench- Russ, Norm/Mann, Levert, B PF, Zubac.</p>

<p>I think all teams fix their weaknesses and are more &ldquo;complete&rdquo; now. They look pretty synergistic.</p>

<p>Orlando adds a great/at one point elite young playmaking shotcreating guard to their starting lineup. Also they are able to solidify their bench and get minutes to their recent draftees while still fitting their existing structure as a defense first team. They will lose Cole who has been one of the better bench guys for 2 years in a row, and Wendell who has been an above average starting Center for 2years in a row. Wendell is a great 2way player, his numbers arent that far off from Garlands, most Magic fans including myself thought he would take a huge jump this season but he got injured quickly (which would be a worry during trade discussions) and came back a bit off but slowly found himself by playoffs. He is a great/elite 3&amp;D big, I personally think he is a better PF than Center, and he had numbers that supported that his 1st full season at Orlando playing full time at the PF spot (I honestly considered him a top 8 PF that year), Wendell led many defensive stats that year as a PF, was an elite big man stopper, and showed great mobility as a rolling big. His addition of shooting and playmaking to his skillset just shows that he has a bright future. Wendell is still very young and has shown continuous development. He alone may not be worth the perceived value of Garland (despite the numbers showing it) but adding Cole + picks should at least make it a workable discussion.</p>

<p>Cleveland gets Paul George to partner with Donovan Mitchell. This is the probably going to be one of the most dynamic teams in the league able to play great in any playstyle, whether its slowing the tempo and creating mismatches, playing fast and attacking the driving lanes, playing the extra pass game and finding the open man to shoot or cut, or playing iso ball and letting stars takeover. They have it all with Don and PG offensively. They can even play a great PNR game with Mobley and Wendell being notable lob threats.  Paul George imo fits great next to Mitchell, he is a bigger better Joe Ingles with alot more athleticism and verticality. PG can get surgical out there with Mitchell dissecting defenses.  PG is also a great defender one of the better tall 2way guys in the league. Add in Wendell who mentioned above is also a great 2 way player. Wendell fits Cleveland as a better shooter but slightly worse defense  Bam. Wendell has alot going good for him, I just personally think Orlando messed up running him as a Center, letting Wendell focus all his attention to being an elite big man stopper and help defender to me is the best. Mobley would be able to control the rim alone now as Wendell can guard perimeter and space out corners, so now EM can finally have fulltime rim protection and rebound duties (though Wendell can always help rebound or switch to better hide EM).  The Cleveland bench imo also gets a bit better with Cole leading it, I think Cole gets underrated at points but the guy is a borderline starter most nights and a clear difference maker, he is also a growing defender and playmaker.</p>

<p>Clippers get Jarret Allen and Levert, a great package for Paul George imo. Now Harden can really try to get back to form and average 20+, Kawhi gets an elite defensive help at the rim similar to Marc Gasol (without the shooting but a better lob threat). I truly like the combination of Kawhi and JA, I think they will torture teams. JA also helps fix Harden issues of taking plays off/getting blown by, as JA can easily rim protect and man an entire defense. Clippers may lose offense without PG, but JA is a double double lock, with dpoy potential. Teams wont make many points vs this Clippers team. The idea here is that Harden gets a little more on form with having more onball time, JA should get some easy buckets from the gravity from Harden and Kawhi, and hopefully other plays show up offensively most nights. The Clips with this team imo can take the #1 seed.  If Harden is too expensive the Clips have some money now to search for a good fit and to complete the team. There are a lot of great FA Guards/Wings this season.</p>

      <label for="la2xc6l" class="commentText"><p>Ok, settle down with the &ldquo;double that.&rdquo; There ain&rsquo;t a team alive that would be willing to pay him $40M a year, even if he qualified.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s among the better traditional bigs, but he&rsquo;s a role player. He&rsquo;s never made an All-Defensive team. He was an All-Star alternate once the year that his usage spiked. And he creates his fair share of roster-building challenges next to him. Paying Jarrett Allen means you have to have a very specific player next to him at the 4 - hence why he can&rsquo;t click with Evan Mobley.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s a very good player, but $25 is what he&rsquo;s actually worth, and you can find 80% of what he brings by cobbling together some less expensive pieces.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s changing as we&rsquo;re seeing the way rosters take shape but it&rsquo;ll take time for a majority of people to really see players that provide value impact.</p>

I also would like Mobley to develop his three more and I think playing at the 4 more will help.</p>

<p>But he should get traded, because he&rsquo;s on such an amazing contract and he should have more value to another team than he has to the Cavs where he and Mobley are platooning the same role. They should be able to get a very good haul for him particularly because the contract is easier for other contending teams to swallow. </p>

<p>For the same reason they should trade Garland if Mitchell agrees to stay long term. </p>

<p>Mobley is young cheaper and has much more upside as a star. Allen is a very nice player and could be used in deals with other teams to get good players and assets like picks. If they can do that they 100% should as Mitchell could leave next season and they have next to zero picks.</p>

<p>They could also look to trade Garland for the same reason and could even try and trade both to retool around Mobley and Mitchell.</p>

<p>People love to say the fit is bad but ignore the fact that the numbers don’t back that up. Mitchell and garland have been better together than apart for 2 straight seasons. Allen and Mobley play 18 mpg together and are a positive. They’re better alone sure but that’s also because they’re playing backups in those minutes alone. Its just a made up narrative at this point because people see two bigs and say you can’t do that in 2024</p>

      <label for="la308pk" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think he’s going to get traded for random rotation guys but I also don’t think he really fits with Cleveland. It’s a similar situation with Garland. He’s good but doesn’t fit with Mitchell. Mobley is the guy to build around and you can’t play him with JA in the playoffs when they both can’t shoot. You can’t really win with 3 spacers in the playoffs it shrinks the half court offense to a huge degree.</p>

      <label for="la32e60" class="commentText"><p>His value decreases simply because the Cavs have to move him. They can’t play Allen and Mobley together and everyone knows it</p>
