      <label for="la34ycy" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think so. Jarret Allen is a very good player but I think there are legitimate questions about his fit starting next to Mobley. I know Mobley shot 36% from three last year but I think he’s better at the center than the 4. Their offense also looked a little better at times when they put Mobley at the 5 and surrounded him with 4 shooters.</p>

<p>If they can get trade allen for some picks and a good 4 that can space the floor next to Mobley then it might be something they should consider </p>

<p>It wasnt until after the All Star break where he actively looked to shoot 1-2 per game so that&rsquo;s why his attempt number is even above 1.</p>

<p>Its not a Jarrett Allen problem, its Mobley not adapting his game to being a stretch 4 that is making the pairing not optimized. I am not trading Jarrett Allen for peanuts because Mobley is reluctant to shoot. Dumb dumb dumb</p>

      <label for="la3by14" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think that Mobley isn&rsquo;t adapting, I just don&rsquo;t think that his development has panned out the way they wanted. They paired them based on the projection that Mobley&rsquo;s flashes of guard skills would translate to eventually being a stretch big you can pair with a traditional 5, and that hasn&rsquo;t happened.</p>

<p>He just doesn&rsquo;t work at the 4 and, save some increasingly unlikely development, he won&rsquo;t work there in the future. There&rsquo;s no way around that. Despite that, he&rsquo;s still the younger, more versatile option with a higher ceiling and so they&rsquo;ve gotta trade Allen.</p>

      <label for="la3dj96" class="commentText"><p>As a cavs fan im happy with the development though in his shot. Best 3pt % of his career this year and almost +5% on his ft this year. We can’t expect him to be a stretch 4, but hes getting better.</p>

<p>If we can’t return much for jarrett theres no reason to trade, but i wouldn’t mind seeing more mobley at the 5. However I think part of the uniqueness of our roster is the two big men, mobley is still 23 and its not uncommon for big men to develop jumpers. I’d like to stick it out another year and see what can happen as mobley improves.</p>

<p>Edit: And honestly we played as well as anybody did against the celtics. Going to seven against the magic wasn’t ideal but we could really only learn so much about our team from this postseason after drawing celtics second round.</p>

      <label for="la2uj1o" class="commentText"><p>He is definitely good, but I think in today’s nba, teams can only really have 1 non shooter at most in their starting/closing line up, so every team has to selective who that is. So it’s really just a demand problem, teams that want to win now, don’t already have a non shooter, who also need a C, who have a player that the Cavs would even want. JA is good at what he does, (rim run, protect the rim, rebound), but is limited in other avenues (can get bullied by other bigs, no offensive self creation, spotty playoff history, non shooter).</p>

<p>To be clear, I love JA, and most teams would be lucky to have him as their starting C, but I can see how teams/fans could be a little hesitant</p>

      <label for="la30160" class="commentText"><p>It’s more about how teams treat spacing, more than actual shooters. If defenses sag off all your role players, they make it much harder for your stars to score/play make, your bigs to get to the rim, passing lanes, etc. and the team that don’t have at least 4 shooters in their best line ups, tend to struggle in the playoffs. Some of it can be somewhat outweighed if you have the best player (Luka, giannis jokic), but most teams don’t. And even their teams follow that. The mavs saw that in the finals, but had success in the playoffs before then because their defenders that teams sagged off suddenly started hitting shots. Celtics are the best example, Denver starting 5, OKC, Knicks, when healthy even the clippers bucks and Philly</p>

Watching the Spurs all season long it was very apparent how much better other teams were able to adjust to Wemby cause the entire Spurs roster is just not very good shooting from three. Givony said it best recently during an interview discussing that the Spurs need to add outside shooting, &ldquo;as soon as Wemby puts the ball down to the ground, the entire defense collapses on him&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Defenses were able to send up to 3 guys at Victor because they could take the risk of leaving other Spurs players open. The Spurs only had 3 players shoot at least 35% or better from outside, no other team in the entire league had less than 5!</p>

With Draymond, it’s hard to add another big without effecting spacing, and without playing Draymond at center for long periods, making us incredibly small. Playing with Kuminga, looney, TJD is tough as well, when
In the past, the warriors always had a rotation of centers next to him. They need a very particular type of player now, Myles turner/prime Brook Lopez being the dream prototype</p>

<p>Not to mention, Draymond is an extremely high-IQ player with great playmaking abilities (which 99% of non-shooters aren’t typically), which means that if you sag too hard of him he’s great at using that advantage to get Curry a good look (DHO or similar action).</p>

<p>As a Warriors fan I’d expect you of all people could understand these things, Dray literally scored 37 off of 8 3pm in a single playoff game. Also had games scoring 32 and 28 in THE FINALS off of 6 and 5 3pm.</p>

      <label for="la31ves" class="commentText"><p>Yes. But everyone else in their line up can shoot. That’s the point lol you can have 1 non shooter in today’s nba. It’s why huerters shooting troubles hurt them so much this year. Why fox’s improved shooting last year along with Murray’s emergence as a shooter made them look so offensive great. Having a C that can shoot (jokic embiid, KAT, Myles turner, Porzingis) allows you to play your non shooter at the different position, like a defensive wing or guard.</p>

I just look at the number of teams that would want him and think it’s similar to Caruso - what he can do isn’t all in the stat box.  He’s an elite screen setter and he’ll set you five million screens a game.  Guards want that.  He fights on every play for whatever the team needs.  Do we need someone to get an offensive board right now?  He’s got it.  Do we need someone to get a clutch block?  He’s got it.  His contract is $20MM a year for two more years - great value.  He can score and pass better than the team needs him to.  There’s a lot of value there, I just want to make sure my own front office sees it!</p>

<p>I think he’s solid but you seem to be overrating him quite a bit? Contenders can’t/don’t play 2 non-shooters and I’d assume Cavs fans would rather trade JA than Mobley no?</p>

      <label for="la36t88" class="commentText"><p>Yeah the entire post is just exaggerating how good Allen is. He is a very solid center, but he’s not extremely exceptional at anything and the Cavs have another, younger and better player who is an awkward fit with Allen. It makes total sense to be at least open to trading him for some better fitting pieces.</p>

      <label for="la39e4a" class="commentText"><p>Thats not true. He is incredible at finishing and is one of the top Centers in basketball playing in the Pick and Roll. He is also one of the very few centers in the NBA who is not only a elite rim protector, but has the footwork and athleticism to guard all the way out to the perimeter on defense.</p>

<p>He is amazing in the P&amp;R on offense and teams can&rsquo;t put him in the P&amp;R on defense because of his athleticism, length and shot blocking ability. He can switch onto guards from the P&amp;R. 95% of Centers in the NBA cant do that every night. Allen has a skillset very very few Centers have.</p>

<p>Its also why the Cavs have been one of the best defensive teams in basketball for the past 3 years with Mobley/Allen together. Their versatility and athleticism is nightmare fuel for offenses. They are both 7ft tall but they both can switch onto guards all they way out.</p>

      <label for="la338wv" class="commentText"><p>Because people think the Cavaliers are desperate to offload on him due to Mobley&rsquo;s emergence. Same way they think the Cavaliers are in a rush to offload Garland due to his injuries and Mitchell&rsquo;s prominence.</p>

<p>While the Caviliers are in win now mode, talent is rare in the league. It&rsquo;s far better to have all-star talents figure it out than to dump them for solid role players with limited ceilings. If they can&rsquo;t get talent as good as Allen or Garland, they&rsquo;re better off keeping them and hoping for a 2023-2024 Timberwolves esque run.</p>

But don’t trade just because you think the lineups won’t work. Let the new coaching try and if it’s not working, you can move at the deadline.</p>

<p>No reason to get super desperate and blow shit up for bad trades. Donovan clearly likes JA as well and I’m not sure trading away a well liked player by the guy you’re trying to to extend is a great idea</p>

But he&rsquo;s definitely better than Ayton and Mitch Rob imo, depending on how Brook ages he could be firmly better than him next season. I think you could make a pretty good argument he had a better season than Myles Turner but Turner was better in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Overall Jokic, Embiid, AD, Bam, Wemby, Sabonis are all firmly better than him, Sengun is more talented but a harder fit on most teams.</p>

      <label for="la3ld9f" class="commentText"><p>And since that all star season Allen has been functionally the same player, arguably better. Vuc has seen significant decline. For starters you could just think about the fact that nobody wants Vuc’s contract despite him making the same amount as Allen, and that Chicago is likely gonna have to attach an asset to get off his money while Allen has been fairly sought after for years. Secondly you could acknowledge how important defence is at the 5, and the fact that Allen is a significantly  better defender. Thirdly the thing that gives vuc almost all of his offensive value is his 3… and he was down to 29% last year and 32% over the last 3 years. Not good. He had 54% TS last year as a big man which is bottom 20 of the league level.</p>

<p>So yes a two way rim runner with similar production is not in the same conversation as a purely offensive big that can no longer shoot and has terrible efficiency</p>

He might be better than Brook at this stage, and you’re trying to have your cake and eat it too either way JJJ/Towns. JJJ is a natural power forward who slotted into the 5 due to injury necessity last year, he’s not a C. And if your logic is solely his last sample of where he played is all that matters then Kat is a pf.</p>

      <label for="la3kk8y" class="commentText"><p>You’re literally basing everything of one short series a year ago lmao. For starters basketball is significantly more than just one matchup… how you play in the significantly larger sample against 28 other teams is more important. And secondly Allen has only played the Knicks once since then and dropped a cool 18/7/6. This is nothing but narrative.</p>

<p>Secondly Allen is significantly better than Robinson offensively and a bit ahead of hartenstein, though they have more comparable offensive skills Allen is far more productive, and he’s just as good defensively.</p>

<p>If you’d like to revise the take too “he’s a top 10, non-shooting, one positional, defense first center” then yeah I guess he’s within shouting distance. Unfortunately it’s not 2002.</p>

Why is being drafted  in the second round even remotely relevant when they’ve clearly shown to be much better than that ? What does it say about Lebron and AD that they can’t beat Jokic who was drafted in round 2?</p>

<p>Your entire point is a 5 game sample. Basing a player comparison on a size that small (especially when they played pretty comparably) is
Completely non sensical.</p>

<p>Hell by this logic is Sabonis better than Davis, since he notoriously kills him every time they play ?</p>

Simple fact is it’s tough to win with a defensive minded big man who can’t shoot in today’s NBA. You really have to have the right roster construction around him, so that limits destinations.</p>

      <label for="la2zeht" class="commentText"><p>First, he is absolutely not worth double his salary, and he is not a top 10 defender.</p>

<p>But more importantly, it doesn&rsquo;t actually matter how good he is. What matters is how likely the Cavs are to trade him, and how many teams are willing to trade significant assets for him. </p>

<p>The Cavs seem likely to trade him. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine that Allen + Mobley is the best way for them to allocate their resources, he is way more likely to be traded than Mobley, there seemed to be some ill feelings there after the playoff series, and if they do try with him for one more year, and it doesn&rsquo;t work out, his value will be even lower. So trading him makes a lot of sense. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, non-shooters who aren&rsquo;t stars in the NBA have a pretty clear limit on how valuable they can be, and he just isn&rsquo;t a fit on a lot of teams since most teams don&rsquo;t play two traditional bigs. Any team with a non-shooter is immediately not a fit. That includes teams with a non-shooting big, and also teams with a non-shooting guard. </p>

<p>Add in some of the new cap restrictions limiting the mechanisms that can be used to move him, and you end up with a team that wants to move a guy without a particularly robust market. </p>

<p>They have to let one of them go .they have been quite patient and tried to make it work so many times ,this year should be the last giving they have a new coaching staff coming in .after that , a trade is inevitable</p>

<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of wild speculation because the Cavs are likely (as they should be) considering all options.</p>

<p>Allen is entering year 4 of a 5 year contract. His value is diminished without an extension sign and trade. As a rental, he&rsquo;s not highly desirable.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s among the better traditional bigs, but he&rsquo;s a role player. He&rsquo;s never made an All-Defensive team. He was an All-Star alternate once the year that his usage spiked. And he creates his fair share of roster-building challenges next to him. Paying Jarrett Allen means you have to have a very specific player next to him at the 4 - hence why he can&rsquo;t click with Evan Mobley.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s a very good player, but $25 is what he&rsquo;s actually worth, and you can find 80% of what he brings by cobbling together some less expensive pieces.</p>

<p>This is precisely the reason he&rsquo;s not worth more. You can&rsquo;t argue that he&rsquo;s worth being paid as a star while also arguing that there is a glut of players who are better than Allen is at his primary role.</p>

      <label for="la3mci4" class="commentText"><p>Three simple reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>His fit next to Mobley. The league is going 5 out and the Celtics and Mavs  showed them the limitations of twin big lineups. Mobley is the franchise star, moving Allen allows his development as an interior force and better floor spacing for him and everyone else.</p></li>

<li><p>His playoff performances.. he has been underwhelming in the post season even admitting the lights were too bright for him</p></li>

<li><p>Getting value for him before his last year of his contract. I don&rsquo;t think they will just trade him for nothing but this is when you can get the best value for him</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you look at where the league has moved with teams like OKC and the Celtics dominating their conferences with versatile big men and 5 out spacing it diminishes the value of guys like Allen in modern roster construction. He is good enough to win regular season games and get you to the playoffs but a team building a contender team he isn&rsquo;t the ideal fit next to Mobley and mobley has more upside so he goes</p>

      <label for="la2tbrp" class="commentText"><p>Because the Cavs have to make a decision this offseason. They can’t just run back Mobley and Allen for a third time after falling short both seasons and their front court underperforming/being hurt.</p>

<p>Mobley is young cheaper and has much more upside as a star. Allen is a very nice player and could be used in deals with other teams to get good players and assets like picks. If they can do that they 100% should as Mitchell could leave next season and they have next to zero picks.</p>

<p>They could also look to trade Garland for the same reason and could even try and trade both to retool around Mobley and Mitchell.</p>

I don’t care about their regular season wins/losses. In the playoffs they have disappointed. Get embarrassed last year against the Knicks and barely put up a fight against the Celtics.</p>

<p>Both of those teams aren’t going anywhere and then you have the Bucks and 76ers who should be healthier next season. They almost lost to a super young Magic team that’s only going get better. It’s very likely this team could be the sixth best team out east and if you traded all of that just to be number six that’s bad.</p>

      <label for="la2ukmt" class="commentText"><p>How exactly did they “fall short.” They took a game off the Celtics and played them as close as any team in the playoffs. This all happened while they’re were missing a huge chunk of their rotation.</p>

<p>People love to say the fit is bad but ignore the fact that the numbers don’t back that up. Mitchell and garland have been better together than apart for 2 straight seasons. Allen and Mobley play 18 mpg together and are a positive. They’re better alone sure but that’s also because they’re playing backups in those minutes alone. Its just a made up narrative at this point because people see two bigs and say you can’t do that in 2024</p>

<p>The Cavs offence stunk the entire post season ranking dead last in the first round and 14th overall. That is because when you have two bigs who can’t shot your offence is capped.</p>

<p>If you think Mitchell is top 10 that’s fine I don’t and have never seen him as such. He definitely can reach that level some nights but he is a clear level below even a guy like Tatum.</p>

It&rsquo;s a known thing in the NBA that having 2 non-shooters is really bad for spacing. Heck, if they could, every team would go 5 shooters, except that stretch bigs that are also rim protectors are pretty rare.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why people have a problem thinking that an amazing asset would get traded.</p>

<p>That just means the price has to be high, commensurately.</p>

It’s a similar situation with Garland. He’s good but doesn’t fit with Mitchell. Mobley is the guy to build around and you can’t play him with JA in the playoffs when they both can’t shoot. You can’t really win with 3 spacers in the playoffs it shrinks the half court offense to a huge degree.</p>

      <label for="la3nihu" class="commentText"><p>Ah yes, the classic ‘you don’t watch games’. Do all the Cavs fans saying this exact same thing also not watch the games ? Guess the objective defensive results this pairing has produced are also a lie</p>

      <label for="la35w96" class="commentText"><p>Disagree that he&rsquo;s on an amazing contract.<br>
He&rsquo;s Andrew Bogut 2.0 as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.</p>

<p>His skillset has been outdated since 2016.
He&rsquo;s a rim-protecting rim-running big with no jump shot, not above-average passing or screening, and below average lateral quickness so he can&rsquo;t cover a pick and roll that well and is vulnerable to being switched onto guards.</p>

<p>In 2014 he&rsquo;d be a max salary center like Clint Capella, but I don&rsquo;t think those guys are valued the same way today.</p>

<p>Nowadays, huge slow big men usually need a superlative skill that forces defenses to adjust to them like shooting/passing/rebounding but Allen is not Jokic, not Sabonis, not Porzingis, so the other team doesn&rsquo;t need to adjust their game plan to prevent him from hurting them on the offensive end.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s obvious you have not watched him play. He is not a slow big and he sets great screens.</p>

      <label for="la3hm6y" class="commentText"><p>Almost all of this is nonsense. He’s definitely one of the better screening/handoff bigs out there in the same vein as Steven Adams. He doesn’t have a jumper but he does have more range and more post moves than most rim runners out there, and he’s quite literally never had issues getting exploited from switches so far so idk why you brought that up. He’s also definitely not slow, he’s highly athletic and mobile.</p>

<p>The defensive  rim running/pick and roll C is still the role most playoff teams have had their big fill over the past few years (Cavs, Knicks, Wolves, Warriors, Clippers, Mavs, Grizzlies), and Allen is probably the best big in the league in that role besides Gobert</p>
