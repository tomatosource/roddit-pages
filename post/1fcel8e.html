      <label for="lm81hce" class="commentText"><p>Absolutely it was well on the way, the turn away from midrange to 3pters happened because of the Miami Heat and Moreyball, it jumped from 18 with maybe one team shooting over 25 3PA in 2012 before the Heat won.</p>

<p>To 10 teams shooting over 25 3PA in 2015. After the Heat finished up but Before the Warriors won anything.</p>

<p>The focus on spacing, small ball, fast pace transition basketball and 3pt shooting was well on the way in 2014.</p>

<p>Then after the Warriors won, it rapidly increased from there. Showing the league that the SSOL style of basketball can be defensive and can be effective.</p>

<p>But the 3pt revolution had already started before the Warriors did anything. Moreyball and Spo&rsquo;s offense on the heat kickstarted it. Spurs also contributed by showcasing how effective a small ball motion offense can be.</p>

<p>Just remember that the 3pt revolution took place between 2012 and 2019, finalizing in a league that averaged 32 3PA. Introducing the current 3pt era.</p>

<p>To say it&rsquo;s a stretch is crazy, when all the media would whine about at the time is teams doing Analytics instead of playing real basketball.</p>

      <label for="lm83w9u" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s a huge part of the 3pt revolution, small ball and fast pace only works with immense spacing. That&rsquo;s the main point of going small, is so you can space the floor and move the ball up the floor quicker.</p>

<p>No they were a top 3pt shooting team.</p>

<p>2013 Heat were 6th in attempts per game and were a 40% 3pt shooting team (first or 2nd). The 2014 Heat were not nearly as effective at shooting threes, but their attempts per game didn&rsquo;t change and they moved from 6th, to 21st. Just to show you how the ball was rolling in the revolution.</p>

<p>Moreyball had been adapted by a variety of teams before the Warriors also adapted it. We also called this &ldquo;analytics&rdquo; but also Moreyball.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not true either, Rockets led the way in 3PA with Harden. They were already nearing 30 3PA in his first year there.<a href="https://www.thedreamshake.com/2013/1/13/3873866/the-winning-effects-of-moreyball-or-just-give-up-and-hate-the-long-2" target="_blank"> They abandoned mid ranged shooting his first year there.</a></p>

<p>Not sure why you think Harden was known more for his midrange shooting early in Houston. In 2013, Harden took about 18-20% of his shots from mid range, 36% from 3</p>

<p>Compared to that of KD from 2013, who took about 40% of his shots from midrange, 23% from three.</p>

<p>Not sure why you&rsquo;re so against this. We talked about the 3pt revolution on this sub, at the time! 3pt revolution happened between 2012 and 2019. Just because teams didn&rsquo;t take 35 threes a game in 2014, doesn&rsquo;t mean teams weren&rsquo;t rapidly moving away from the midrange, to a smaller faster paced game.</p>

<p>I feel like what you&rsquo;re thinking of, is Curry&rsquo;s heavy 3PA. That didn&rsquo;t kick start until 2016 for sure.</p>

<p>nope Miami was middle of pack 3pt team</p>

<p>the avg 3PA went up by 1 attempt/game from 13 to 14&hellip;.</p>

<p>Moreyball does not mean shoot a few more 3&rsquo;s, which many teams did. Moreyball was totally eliminating midrange for only 3&rsquo;s and shots at rim. most teams did not go to this extreme</p>

<p>Harden attempting more 3&rsquo;s than middys doesn&rsquo;t mean that&rsquo;s what he was known for. his game was frequently operating in midrange and drawing fouls. it wasn&rsquo;t until 16-17 season where you saw Harden drastically shift the areas of the floor where he shot from, after seeing 2 years of Warriors domination</p>

<p>I literally just showed you, that they were not. They were 6th in attempts per game and (1st/2nd) in 3pt%. They shot 40% from three in their 66 win campaign. They did this while playing an immense amount of small ball. I don&rsquo;t even know what you&rsquo;re arguing here</p>

<p>The 2012 heat were middle of the pack? Is that what you mean? Because the iconic, league defining version of this team absolutely were a top 3pt shooting team, literally 2nd to the Warriors that same year.</p>

<p>1.5 3PA average is a huge amount of shots. But what does it tell you when a team goes from 6th taking 22 threes a game, to 21st, taking 22 threes a game? That maybe more teams are shooting more threes?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You mean, the 3pt revolution was multifaceted approach to basketball? Like I keep trying to tell you?</p>

<p>Moreyball is specifically about shooting prioritizing threes and shots at the rim, while trying to eliminate long range twos, it did not even mean eliminate the midrange entirely. Most teams did abandon the midrange during 12-15, I don&rsquo;t even know what you&rsquo;re arguing here. That teams slowly abandoned the midrange, due to the the 3pt revolution going on?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Harden attempting more 3&rsquo;s than middys doesn&rsquo;t mean that&rsquo;s what he was known for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&rsquo;re the one saying that Harden took more middys than threes my dude. Harden was never a midrange scorer, I don&rsquo;t know why you think he &ldquo; his game was frequently operating in midrange and drawing fouls&rdquo;. He barely ever took midrange shots at any point in his career. He largely drew fouls in the paint.</p>

<p>I feel like you don&rsquo;t really know what you&rsquo;re talking about here, you&rsquo;re consistently wrong and you&rsquo;re kind of just making shit up. Harden took MORE threes than before this period, like everyone else. But by that point, the three point revolution was over and the 3pt era had arrived.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s several teams that I consider better. But none moved me the way they did. It was simply art in basketball form. </p>

      <label for="lm88df8" class="commentText"><p>For all the &ldquo;Pass the ball to Wemby more&rdquo; and lack of a solid PG, both of which are true, the Spurs had more assists last season than any other before. The areas of improvement are there but so are the building blocks. The Beautiful Game may just be returning sooner than we thought and when it is, it may very well very be something we haven&rsquo;t seen in a long time or ever before.</p>
