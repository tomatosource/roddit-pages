<p>It&rsquo;s the reason the Bucks are still in Milwaukee, but it&rsquo;s also the reason we spun the hamster wheel for over a decade until Giannis fell into our lap. His refusal to commit to a deep rebuild was aggravating.</p>

<p>Attendance plummeted because the team had no hope for competing or attracting top talent. Any time the Bradley Center was packed it was usually because the Lakers or LeBron were in town, and you can guess which team fans were supporting that night (I&rsquo;ll give you a hint: Not the Bucks).</p>

The opposite happened in Toronto and Philly and they have a slow sad divorce with both their superstars. It&rsquo;s just baffling that they traded the best player and best asset on the team for &ldquo;chemistry&rdquo; reasons without any intention of rebuilding</p>

      <label for="lgjq2tw" class="commentText"><p>George Karl had coached Payton in Seattle and felt that the Bucks needed backcourt defense if they were going to get back to making deep playoff runs. He clashed with Allen on a personal level (as he did with most of his star players) and felt that Allen&rsquo;s skillset was replaceable&ndash;this was back when &ldquo;jump-shooting teams don&rsquo;t win championships&rdquo; was common sense.</p>

<p>Of course this was one of the worst things that ever happened to the franchise, as Payton left town immediately, despite Karl telling reporters and management that Payton would re-sign. Allen loved it in Milwaukee and wept when he was informed of the trade. Gary skipped town; the rest of the core from that great ECF run a couple of years prior aged out; Karl left shortly thereafter; and the Bucks became NBA Siberia for the next decade.</p>

He was on the Bulls in &lsquo;95 but that off-season they left Armstrong exposed to the expansion draft. It meant Harper got a starting role and became the perfect defensive fit next to ball-dominant Jordan and Pippen.</p>

<p>That starting five with the addition of Rodman and Harper instead of Kukoc (who moved into a great 6th man, bench scorer, role) and Armstrong was much stronger physically and were vital for MJ.</p>

      <label for="lgl9u83" class="commentText"><p>The 2001 Bucks were awesome. They were one Glen Robinson missed 8 footer away from going to the Finals that year. They probably would have got smacked by the Lakers, but they played them really tough in the regular season.</p>

<p>In 2002, the Bucks had one of the most epic collapses ever. I think they were in first place at the All-star break, and then didn&rsquo;t end up making the playoffs.</p>

<p>They had absolutely no team chemistry the second half of the season and spent much of the time pointing fingers at each other. Something had to change.</p>

<p>I think that they felt they were in a win-now position, and Ray Allen had the most traded value on the roster. Karl thought Allen was overrated. Despite statistically being their best overall player (and certainly best offensive player), Karl saw him as this third option shooter who didn&rsquo;t play much defense.</p>

<p>Allen went to the Sonics and, in a much tougher western conference, made them immediately better. They won over 50 games the following season and gave the Spurs a tough series in the second round.</p>

<p>I think hindsight makes the trade look way worse than it did at the time. It was generally accepted that the Bucks had to trade someone on that roster. While fans liked Allen, I also don&rsquo;t think they were completely sold on him being a franchise player. Gary Payton was still thought of as a good player at the time. It wasn&rsquo;t so clearly a bad move.</p>

<p>I think Allen&rsquo;s performance on the Sonics showed that if you put a competent and complimentary team around him, he could absolutely be the main guy on a really good team, especially in the eastern conference.</p>

<p>Anyway you are right on everything, just you forgot to mention that also back in early 2000s coaches has more power than stars and nowadays, unless you are Doc or other veteran coach you are kick out if you clash with a star. Or at very least a trade for a bunch of picks is made. Back then nobody or almost nobody traded their picks.</p>

      <label for="lgk4hys" class="commentText"><p>Definitely not on the defensive end, and on the offensive end he was less likely to initiate the offense with a 1:1 like George does.</p>

<p>But he was a quality slasher, cutter, and shooter. Ray Allen would draw attention on movements, and then Ridnour could find Lewis moving into the vacuum that created - especially when Radmonovic was out there instead of Reggie Evans.</p>

<p>Once he moved to PF in Orlando it really unlocked those skills, he was a little slow/uncoordinated to take faster wings on-ball on defense, but his relative athleticism compared to the more lumbering power forwards was a huge boon offensively.</p>

That Seattle team were crazy fun, Ray Allen and Rashard were a cheat code. Worst thing is - Rashard had a great shot but was a little taller, so in the game he was often an even better option than Ray when you need a 3p lol</p>

Ray Allen &amp; Michael Redd on the same team with any competent point guard and some screen setting brutes up front is a recipe for success in the East in that era.</p>

<li><p>The Bucks were inconsistent the year they traded Allen.</p></li>

<li><p>Allen clashed with the coaches and ownership sided with George Karl.</p></li>

<li><p>They had Michael Redd waiting in the wings to take over the starting 2 spot.</p></li>

<li><p>Payton was coming off a strong year with the Sonics despite being 33. Cassell’s future with the Bucks was up in the air, and taking a shot on Payton was a risk they thought was worth taking despite him being an unrestricted FA at the end of the season. Payton actually played well for the Bucks for the remained of the season, but ended up leaving in the off season for a chance at a ring with the Lakers.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It sucks that Ray’s tenure with the Bucks ended on a sour note. The ‘00/01 Bucks were super fun to watch and if it weren’t were some highly questionable calls from refs in the ECF, would have been in the Finals that year. Cassell/Allen/Redd was one of the best backcourts in the league, and if they could have brought in a legit low-post presence I feel they’d have won a ring at some point.</p>

      <label for="lgjr2sg" class="commentText"><p>The Bucks had traded Glenn Robinson to Atlanta after 2002 for Toni Kukoc and a first. (Not the worst trade in the world on its own but it was definitely a “shake things up” for its own sake type trade.) Then George Karl sees an opportunity to get Gary Payton, who he’d gone to the Finals with “a few” years earlier (seven years to be exact) and thought he could convince him to stay in Milwaukee long term. Seattle asked for Allen in return, who Karl never liked for whatever reason, so Karl said yes, and thought he could have a new “Big Three of “Payton/Michael Redd/Kukoc.” Payton had no interest in staying in Milwaukee and left that summer.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, Milwaukee trades Sam Cassell for Joe Smith shortly before Payton left for the Lakers. Personally I would’ve rather had “Cassell/Allen/Robinson” with Redd off the bench, or slide Robinson to the 4 with any center and go crazy with shooters, but the NBA wasn’t ready for that yet. George Karl certainly wasn’t.</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t make sense. The team went in one direction. With Allen, they had missed the playoffs the year before, and it seemed like the team was regressing. I think they had simply decided to choose George Karl over Ray Allen, a decision which they likely regretted because he wasn&rsquo;t with the team long either.</p>

      <label for="lgkaw4b" class="commentText"><p>George Karl thought he could do another run with his old war horse and talked ownership into it, nevermind that Payton was 34 years old and an upcoming free agent. The team also thought they could adequately replace Allen’s production with Michael Redd. The team had been backsliding for the last two years, and the truth was because Karl’s act had burned out with the players. It wasn’t anything that Allen had to do with the team .  It set the franchise back by a decade.</p>

      <label for="lgkb3xn" class="commentText"><p>Because they didn&rsquo;t think Ray Allen was a better player.   During that time Gary Payton was reguarded as one of the best players in the NBA and only recently has age become something with which GM&rsquo;s pay a lot of attention too on players.  Back in the 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s up to the 2010&rsquo;s reputation is what a lot of GM&rsquo;s paid attention too.   Mind you there is a good reason that a lot of those GM&rsquo;s were former players and a lot of them are no longer around in any capacity because of how bad they were.</p>
