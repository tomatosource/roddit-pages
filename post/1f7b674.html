<p>(I swear there was an actual video but I can&rsquo;t seem to find it.)</p>

<p>Crazy that not only were two players already in the league at the time that would eventually pass his record (Steph and soon Harden), one of them is going to surpass him by over 1,000 perhaps as early as this season. Keep in mind, Reggie said this when Ray had ~2600 threes. Dame&rsquo;s already passed this total too, and will likely outright surpass Ray in 2 or 3 seasons.</p>

<p>Steph Curry really did change basketball and proved everyone wrong. No one expecting this 3 point surge.</p>

The early Warriors dynasty teams were <em>absolutely</em> tough inside. The assumption that Bogut, Draymond, Barnes, and Iggy wouldn’t be able to control the paint on offense and defense was his mistake.</p>

      <label for="ll6dgyi" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s also true of the 2022 ring. People will talk about it like Steph single-handedly beat the Celtics. Meanwhile GP2, Looney, and Wiggins were putting in immense performances on defense.</p>

<p>Stops are nearly as valuable as makes for moving the point differential, and they shut Boston down in the final three games. The Warriors in the dynasty years were a great offensive team that also usually ranked near the top of the NBA in team defense.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that defense also played a huge role in winning the series. They held Boston under 100 points for the final three games, all wins for GS. They made every possession a war.</p>

<p>That side of it doesn&rsquo;t get as much ink.</p>

      <label for="ll6fflo" class="commentText"><p>Definitely GP2 and Wiggins were both absolute menaces on that end and Draymond proved why he&rsquo;s been the best playoff defender in the league the last 10 years.</p>

<p>Also I think the Celtics just don&rsquo;t have that all time great scorer as well. Even this year when they won it was because they had so many good scorers instead of a standout one.</p>

      <label for="ll6ny7f" class="commentText"><p>Steph started toward the end of the Baron Davis era and it was actually the Warriors office that gambled on this guy that a lot of scouts said &ldquo;relied too much on the 3&rdquo; to bail him out, turned out the be their best asset. He was injured early on but showed incredible spurts with his ball handling that they decided he was the future. In highschool I used to watch his highlights and emulate his low centered dribbling and would absolutely fool defenders, but it takes a lot of core strength. He also heaves long 3s from his core instead of using his legs, which helps when you fatigue as a shooter or are exhausted. Durant famously has a lot of legs in his jump shot so he can end up short in really late games if he plays a ton of minutes. That&rsquo;s why he such a great shooter in all spans of the game. He can run a ton during the game and even when his legs get tired he doesn&rsquo;t have to alter his shot. It&rsquo;s one of his greatest strengths as a player really.</p>

      <label for="ll6r65i" class="commentText"><p>I think the current nba realizes that no single strategy works above any others. It entirely depends on your personnel. You tailor the team strategy to your best player&rsquo;s strengths and make up for their weaknesses. You have a Steph so you make an offense that generates open looks. Then you get good defenders like dray and klay to help on that side and hide Steph as best you can. You surround a generational passer like lebron or jokic, you surround him with shooters and cutters to force defense to pick their poison.</p>

      <label for="ll6t6rj" class="commentText"><p>Ok, but those are all based around spacing and shooting. There is no Shaq, Ewing, Yao style centers in the league. From the 60s-2000 the league was a big man league, inside dominated, with elite shooters taking 3 3pt per game. </p>

<p>Do we ever go back to some semblance of that with the power center being the force of the game? Today we have giant centers like Jokic and Joel who are about shooting and spacing, not inside dominance. Is that era dead forever, or will we shift back? </p>

The conventional wisdom at the time was basically the same thing that if you&rsquo;re a team that relies so heavily on shooting you&rsquo;re going to go cold some nights and get knocked out. But what Barkley and people like him overlooked when they&rsquo;d make these predictions is that the Warriors had a really good defense too.</p>

<p>No need to argue with me. Just look at the stats. The average 3 point attempts per game was hovering around 18. Steph first broke the single season record in the 2012-2013 season. And then it took off from there.</p>

But teams only shifted their strategies because they saw that a team could be successful shooting a bunch of threes, not because they saw a player succeed while shooting a bunch of threes. The league wouldn&rsquo;t have adopted threes close to as much if they saw Steph shooting a bunch of threes resulting in constant losses for the warriors</p>

      <label for="ll6lu90" class="commentText"><p>The primary reason why his record is vulnerable is because he&rsquo;s a late-bloomer who played three seasons in college and didn&rsquo;t really get the training wheels taken off until several years into his NBA career.</p>

<p>He averaged &amp;lt;5 3PA for his first three NBA seasons.</p>

<p>Eventually there will be another great shooter who is 1-and-done in college and gets a greener light right out of the box.</p>

      <label for="ll6wq8r" class="commentText"><p>4,000 3PM in a 17 year career is 236 makes per year. Considering Buddy Hield has averaged 266 the last 6 seasons at 39.8%, and on his volume if he shot 35.2% he’d be exactly on pace for that, yes, a decent 3 point shooter on very high volume could get there.</p>

<p>A guy has to come in around age 19, have the green light to shoot 9 attempts per game, and just maintain that and play until he’s 36. Prime years shoot high 30’s and early/late years can shoot a little under 35%.</p>

<p>For all we know, the league might trend to shoot 50 3PA per game by the end of the decade and 9 attempts is something 20-30 guys in the league are doing.</p>

<p>Curry’s record will not stand forever but he’ll always be the greatest shooter of all time</p>

Someone like Harden or even Buddy Heild has virtually no chance of catching him despite being very good shooters with high volume. Also, no decent team is letting a decent shooter take Steph&rsquo;s volume.</p>

<p>His record will obviously fall, but it will have to be another one of the best shooters ever.</p>

      <label for="ll6vjul" class="commentText"><p>Harden was in the same draft class as Curry and began his career on the bench on a team with KD and Russ taking most of the shots. He didn’t become a starter until his fourth season and even then the 3 point revolution didn’t start until like his 7th season.</p>

<p>Players who started their career from 2022 onwards (to throw out the shortened COVID seasons) will start out shooting way more 3s than Curry did until he was in his late 20s, that’ll give them almost a decade on Curry to catch up.</p>

<p>He averages 2.6 made 3’s per game, curry is 3.9 and that number is stunted by his early years.</p>

<p>Trae would either have to up his volume or up his efficiency, likely both.</p>

<p>At his current rate he could play another 12 years (never miss a game) and he’d still have less than curry has today, and curry’s gonna keep pushing that record out.</p>

<p>Trae’s most 3’s in a season is 233</p>

<p>Steph has surpassed that total 10 times.</p>

      <label for="ll6un52" class="commentText"><p>Per statmuse, Trae has averaged 176.5 3s per season, with more than 150 in <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> seasons so far in his career (1059 total). In Steph&rsquo;s first 6 seasons, he averaged 198.5 3pts made (1191 total), with a 55 3PTM season in there. Since Steph&rsquo;s 6th season, he&rsquo;s averaged almost 5 3 pointers made per game every season. If Steph retired today and Trae kept up his own pace, which is 2.6 made per game, he&rsquo;d have to play basically twice as long to draw even. Even with the head start of higher volume in his first couple years, Trae&rsquo;s already behind the pace and is unlikely to match most of Steph&rsquo;s subsequent seasons, even if Trae has the same longevity as Steph (which is fairly unlikely given that Steph has aged unusually well for his player profile and Trae is less physically gifted than Steph to begin with).</p>

<p>Despite the surface-level similarities in their games, Trae is not currently a threat to Steph&rsquo;s record, and he&rsquo;d have to show a historically notable improvement in shooting efficiency to become one.</p>

<p>Buddy Hield of all people actually has more 3-pointers made in his first 8 seasons than Curry had in his first 8 (it&rsquo;s 1923 vs 1917, so pretty close).</p>

<p>Buddy won&rsquo;t do it because he started way too old, but if someone just slightly better came in at 19 and played till 39, they would have a chance.</p>

      <label for="ll6vnfp" class="commentText"><p>I personally don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll see a better shooter in my lifetime but I do think someone will break his total 3s record and it probably won&rsquo;t be that long unless he plays at a high level till 40. Might see his season record too if basketball continues to pursue 3s over all even if efficiency is lower. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any realistic chance someone breaks lebrons total points record (dont get me started on post season) without a massive change to the game simply due to the odds of having to play at a high level with very little missed time for a career about 4x longer than the average. I mean we have KD in the league who is in the argument for best pure scorer not named Jordan and is still going strong after coming into the league at 19 and getting started early and yet is about 10,000 points behind Kareem which means he&rsquo;d have to play identical to last year for the next 5 years straight and might still be a little short. That&rsquo;d put him at 40 years old and still 2000 behind current Lebron. Obviously we have Luka who came in already an all pro and is going off but would have to keep his current pace for another 14 years to still be just short of Kareem and 38 years old. It would take someone coming in at an all pro level averaging 30, playing at 75+ games a year for over 20 years, and depending on how long Lebron continues still probably be short.</p>

<p>the way basketball changed to favor more 3&rsquo;s is the biggest factor in curry/harden/dame passing ray/reggie.</p>

<p>whoever the elite shooter was in this current era was always gonna beat those records almost by default.</p>

<p>difference is now the era shift is already complete, so now beating the record is just straight up beating the record. someone has to have a better mix of amazing shooting, long career, and avoiding injury.</p>

<p>3pa have already plateau&rsquo;d, youre not gonna beat curry because 2035 basketball has more 3&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;ve found is that you really just never know. Even when it came to Michael Jordan&rsquo;s retirement, I remember the consensus among many being something along the lines of, &ldquo;The greatest we&rsquo;ll ever see.&rdquo; Of course, LeBron debuted the very next year; and that&rsquo;s not to say LeBron is better or not, but the next legend was sitting right there on the doorstep while so many were so sure we&rsquo;d never see anything like it again.</p>

      <label for="ll6sr75" class="commentText"><p>Depending on the sport, there are some records that are out of reach simply because of how the league and rules have changed.</p>

<p>No pitcher is ever going to get anywhere near any wins record, for example. I would also imagine Gretzky&rsquo;s points record is untouchable too. I think the main problem with Reggie&rsquo;s assessment of Ray Allen&rsquo;s record is that Ray incrementally beat Reggie, he didn&rsquo;t blow the record out of the water.</p>

<p>The true unbeatable records are the ones that came in an era where volume was high (like NHL scoring in the 80s or 3pt shooting now) and even by the standards of the time, there was someone just heads and shoulders above everyone else. It has to be more than just the highest scoring guy from the highest scoring era.</p>

<p>Steph is absolutely capable of averaging 35+ in his prime, like you said his first and second MVP years (73-9 and unanimous MVP) he sat out so many 4th quarters where he had 35 points and 6 threes already. Would’ve had so many more 40 and 50 bombs those years if the Dubs weren’t so good at putting teams away.</p>

Ray’s last two years in Seattle were his only years shooting over 8 threes a game while Steph has shot over 8 threes every year since 2015.</p>

<p>It’d be interesting to see where Ray would’ve ended up if he came up 15 years later and shot ~twice as many 3s as he did.</p>

      <label for="ll6ko4e" class="commentText"><p>Not saying that Ray isn’t one of the all time greats, but Curry had to be a special kind of great to get that many shots up. Curry literally changed the game in a way that not only allows him to take more threes, but also opened the game to allow others to do the same. I know Ray played in an era where guards were allowed to be more hands on defensively, which you could argue held him back, but Curry broke the mold and probably would have made more 3s in Ray’s era if he played then too.</p>

      <label for="ll6r1bd" class="commentText"><p>Part of it is Steph’s skill for sure, but also part of it is Ray’s vs Steph’s game and the coaching philosophies their coaches employed. Steph has shot more 3s than 2s every season since 15-16 while Ray didn’t do that until he was in Miami, largely because Ray is bigger and more athletic than Steph and Ray could get to the rim and yam on people. It made sense for him to attack the rim more.</p>

<p>Kerr deservingly giving Curry the green light was also huge in this, and as you said, revolutionized the game. But had Ray come into a league that valued 3s like it does today, he might still have the record. If Ray shot just 2 more threes per game (and hit at the same clip), he would have 4,013 3pm, which would be 266 more than Steph currently.</p>

<p>I love Ray Allen. I grew up right next to Storrs and was just starting to play rec basketball in elementary school when he was at UConn. I was at his jersey retirement in Gampel. I have 4 different Ray Allen jerseys (UConn, Sonics, Celtics, Lincoln High Jesus Shuttlesworth). But Steph is a better shooter. There’s lots of evidence backing that, including Steph shooting 2.6% better from deep than Ray on their careers. It’d be a fun race though for the twilight of Steph’s career to see if he could catch Ray had Ray shot closer to say 9 threes a game.</p>

It really took Steph and somewhat Kerr to change that mentality.  Kerr sorta finally through up his hands and let Steph just shoot.  You can pretty much pinpoint the date in which things started to change… March 11, 2015 Go check out the highlight from that date and it will be a top search item.   If you were to do that in the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s you’d find yourself on the bench.</p>

<p>Those averages are untouchable.</p>

<p>His 100 PTS is reachable in a league where 70 PTS is now a little more common and maybe one day someone will play the whole 48 and like an OT to break it.</p>

<p>If he&rsquo;s 7-9 points ahead every single game he&rsquo;ll start cutting into the lead. He&rsquo;s 26 if he goes on a James Harden type explosion for a year or two then he starts cutting 10-12 a game.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d bet he passes Lebron&rsquo;s point total when they&rsquo;re the same age at some point as long as they don&rsquo;t make changes to impact scoring. Though I can&rsquo;t see Luka getting the overall record as averaging 25 when your nearly 40 is absurd.</p>

      <label for="ll6h4o4" class="commentText"><p>LeBron also missed virtually zero time other than to rest for the playoffs the first 11 years of his career, which cancels the PPG edge out. Luka has scored 2000 points in a season twice. LeBron did it nine of the first 11 and ten of the first 15 seasons of his career. The seasons he didn’t: 2004 (rookie year), 2012 (lockout), 2015 (back injury), 2016, and 2017 (rest for the postseason; he was less than 100 points off both seasons). Even if Luka continues scoring 34 ppg for a while (doubtful; even Harden only did it twice, and if Luka is in a situation where he is putting up enough shots to do it, he probably isn’t on a good team), he will not make real progress toward LeBron unless he starts playing 70 games each year.</p>

      <label for="ll6ifer" class="commentText"><p>Well I believe that Luka is a better scorer than Harden (He&rsquo;s been vastly superior year on year at the same age) so I think Harden&rsquo;s 36 ppg season is definitely attainable if not surpassable. He averaged 34 last year while carrying an injury through the back 3rd of it (Went from 2 months of averaging 37 to 2 months of averaging 30). So it&rsquo;s then a question of will he play at least 70 games a season to make a large cut into it.</p>
