<p>(I swear there was an actual video but I can&rsquo;t seem to find it.)</p>

<p>Crazy that not only were two players already in the league at the time that would eventually pass his record (Steph and soon Harden), one of them is going to surpass him by over 1,000 perhaps as early as this season. Keep in mind, Reggie said this when Ray had ~2600 threes. Dame&rsquo;s already passed this total too, and will likely outright surpass Ray in 2 or 3 seasons.</p>

I don’t think you can make enough jumpers to win four series in a row. I’ve said that for 25 years, not just now. I think you physically manhandle them inside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Steph Curry really did change basketball and proved everyone wrong. No one expecting this 3 point surge.</p>

The early Warriors dynasty teams were <em>absolutely</em> tough inside. The assumption that Bogut, Draymond, Barnes, and Iggy wouldn’t be able to control the paint on offense and defense was his mistake.</p>

      <label for="ll6dgyi" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s also true of the 2022 ring. People will talk about it like Steph single-handedly beat the Celtics. Meanwhile GP2, Looney, and Wiggins were putting in immense performances on defense.</p>

<p>Stops are nearly as valuable as makes for moving the point differential, and they shut Boston down in the final three games. The Warriors in the dynasty years were a great offensive team that also usually ranked near the top of the NBA in team defense.</p>

      <label for="ll6em8u" class="commentText"><p>I agree with most of this. Curry&rsquo;s G4 performance was legendary stuff, and in general they needed him to carry the offense.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that defense also played a huge role in winning the series. They held Boston under 100 points for the final three games, all wins for GS. They made every possession a war.</p>

<p>That side of it doesn&rsquo;t get as much ink.</p>

      <label for="ll6fflo" class="commentText"><p>Definitely GP2 and Wiggins were both absolute menaces on that end and Draymond proved why he&rsquo;s been the best playoff defender in the league the last 10 years.</p>

<p>Also I think the Celtics just don&rsquo;t have that all time great scorer as well. Even this year when they won it was because they had so many good scorers instead of a standout one.</p>

      <label for="ll6ny7f" class="commentText"><p>Steph started toward the end of the Baron Davis era and it was actually the Warriors office that gambled on this guy that a lot of scouts said &ldquo;relied too much on the 3&rdquo; to bail him out, turned out the be their best asset. He was injured early on but showed incredible spurts with his ball handling that they decided he was the future. In highschool I used to watch his highlights and emulate his low centered dribbling and would absolutely fool defenders, but it takes a lot of core strength. He also heaves long 3s from his core instead of using his legs, which helps when you fatigue as a shooter or are exhausted. Durant famously has a lot of legs in his jump shot so he can end up short in really late games if he plays a ton of minutes. That&rsquo;s why he such a great shooter in all spans of the game. He can run a ton during the game and even when his legs get tired he doesn&rsquo;t have to alter his shot. It&rsquo;s one of his greatest strengths as a player really.</p>

      <label for="ll6l22j" class="commentText"><p>Obviously, what the said is wrong, but there is some truth to it. The Nuggets used 3 pointers to complement Jokic. Even the Celtics&rsquo; 5-out offense relies heavily on driving to the rim. I&rsquo;m guessing he underestimated the value of spacing from this style of offense, which made playing the paint that much easier.</p>

<p>The Warriors’ success might’ve been the kick in the ass the league needed to really go all-in on it immediately, but it was going to happen regardless.</p>

<p>No need to argue with me. Just look at the stats. The average 3 point attempts per game was hovering around 18. Steph first broke the single season record in the 2012-2013 season. And then it took off from there.</p>

But teams only shifted their strategies because they saw that a team could be successful shooting a bunch of threes, not because they saw a player succeed while shooting a bunch of threes. The league wouldn&rsquo;t have adopted threes close to as much if they saw Steph shooting a bunch of threes resulting in constant losses for the warriors</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;ve found is that you really just never know. Even when it came to Michael Jordan&rsquo;s retirement, I remember the consensus among many being something along the lines of, &ldquo;The greatest we&rsquo;ll ever see.&rdquo; Of course, LeBron debuted the very next year; and that&rsquo;s not to say LeBron is better or not, but the next legend was sitting right there on the doorstep while so many were so sure we&rsquo;d never see anything like it again.</p>

      <label for="ll6hx3y" class="commentText"><p>To expand on your point: Ray averaged 5.7 3PA for his career, Steph has had 5 seasons where he averaged more than <strong>twice</strong> that many 3PA and was only below 5.7 his first three seasons. Ray’s last two years in Seattle were his only years shooting over 8 threes a game while Steph has shot over 8 threes every year since 2015.</p>

<p>It’d be interesting to see where Ray would’ve ended up if he came up 15 years later and shot ~twice as many 3s as he did.</p>

      <label for="ll6ko4e" class="commentText"><p>Not saying that Ray isn’t one of the all time greats, but Curry had to be a special kind of great to get that many shots up. Curry literally changed the game in a way that not only allows him to take more threes, but also opened the game to allow others to do the same. I know Ray played in an era where guards were allowed to be more hands on defensively, which you could argue held him back, but Curry broke the mold and probably would have made more 3s in Ray’s era if he played then too.</p>

It really took Steph and somewhat Kerr to change that mentality.  Kerr sorta finally through up his hands and let Steph just shoot.  You can pretty much pinpoint the date in which things started to change… March 11, 2015 Go check out the highlight from that date and it will be a top search item.   If you were to do that in the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s you’d find yourself on the bench.</p>

<p>If he&rsquo;s 7-9 points ahead every single game he&rsquo;ll start cutting into the lead. He&rsquo;s 26 if he goes on a James Harden type explosion for a year or two then he starts cutting 10-12 a game.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d bet he passes Lebron&rsquo;s point total when they&rsquo;re the same age at some point as long as they don&rsquo;t make changes to impact scoring. Though I can&rsquo;t see Luka getting the overall record as averaging 25 when your nearly 40 is absurd.</p>

      <label for="ll6h4o4" class="commentText"><p>LeBron also missed virtually zero time other than to rest for the playoffs the first 11 years of his career, which cancels the PPG edge out. Luka has scored 2000 points in a season twice. LeBron did it nine of the first 11 and ten of the first 15 seasons of his career. The seasons he didn’t: 2004 (rookie year), 2012 (lockout), 2015 (back injury), 2016, and 2017 (rest for the postseason; he was less than 100 points off both seasons). Even if Luka continues scoring 34 ppg for a while (doubtful; even Harden only did it twice, and if Luka is in a situation where he is putting up enough shots to do it, he probably isn’t on a good team), he will not make real progress toward LeBron unless he starts playing 70 games each year.</p>

      <label for="ll6ifer" class="commentText"><p>Well I believe that Luka is a better scorer than Harden (He&rsquo;s been vastly superior year on year at the same age) so I think Harden&rsquo;s 36 ppg season is definitely attainable if not surpassable. He averaged 34 last year while carrying an injury through the back 3rd of it (Went from 2 months of averaging 37 to 2 months of averaging 30). So it&rsquo;s then a question of will he play at least 70 games a season to make a large cut into it.</p>
