<p>(I swear there was an actual video but I can&rsquo;t seem to find it.)</p>

<p>Crazy that not only were two players already in the league at the time that would eventually pass his record (Steph and soon Harden), one of them is going to surpass him by over 1,000 perhaps as early as this season. Keep in mind, Reggie said this when Ray had ~2600 threes. Dame&rsquo;s already passed this total too, and will likely outright surpass Ray in 2 or 3 seasons.</p>

<p>Unless the record in question flirts with mathematical impossibility (like Wilt’s 48.5 MPG), saying that it’ll stand forever is almost always a bad bet. It’s impossible to predict how the game will evolve, or what the next game-breaking talent will be capable of.</p>

      <label for="ll6wq8r" class="commentText"><p>4,000 3PM in a 17 year career is 236 makes per year. Considering Buddy Hield has averaged 266 the last 6 seasons at 39.8%, and on his volume if he shot 35.2% he’d be exactly on pace for that, yes, a decent 3 point shooter on very high volume could get there.</p>

<p>A guy has to come in around age 19, have the green light to shoot 9 attempts per game, and just maintain that and play until he’s 36. Prime years shoot high 30’s and early/late years can shoot a little under 35%.</p>

<p>For all we know, the league might trend to shoot 50 3PA per game by the end of the decade and 9 attempts is something 20-30 guys in the league are doing.</p>

<p>Curry’s record will not stand forever but he’ll always be the greatest shooter of all time</p>

Don’t remember the exact number, but I think there are only 75 or so guys all time that have played in parts of 17 seasons, and the vast majority have multiple careers: one as a starter, one as a roleplayer, one as a bench guy. The game always changes, records always fall, but Steph’s consistency in his role has as much to do with the record as his shooting.</p>

<p>The thing with Curry is that whatever he missed out on in the first few seasons of his career, he&rsquo;s making up with longevity. Given he has moderate health luck, it&rsquo;s not inconceivable that he averages 300 threes per season over the next three seasons. He&rsquo;ll be 39 then. That&rsquo;s just insane.</p>

<p>Guys still aren&rsquo;t making 300 threes in a season, and he may do it until he&rsquo;s almost 40.</p>

<p>His number of attempts and efficiency is still insane.</p>

There are plenty of shooting guards around for the spot up three, role&ndash;but he&rsquo;d better bring something else to the table our they&rsquo;re replaced with something cheaper. Curry&rsquo;s been the number 1 shooting option for the majority of the minutes of his career, and usually is the main ball handler.</p>

<p>Curry&rsquo;s total will definitely be broken&ndash;possibly by somebody already in the league today&ndash;but it&rsquo;s not going to be by a journeyman backup guard who hits threes.</p>

      <label for="ll7gzty" class="commentText"><p>A guy that holds the all time record for 3PM won&rsquo;t be considered just a decent 3 point shooter cuz he only made the most 3s ever on average efficiency. Itd be like saying a guy that comes along and passes LeBrons scoring record but does it with average efficiency wasn&rsquo;t a great scorer. A guy isn&rsquo;t gonna come along and set the all time scoring record by just being your average run of the mill scorer just like a guy won&rsquo;t set the all time 3PM leader by just being okay at making 3s. It is very difficult to maintain average efficiency on that type of volume and as that much of a focal point of the defense, consistently over 17 years no less.</p>

<p>Funny thing is we already have an example of an all time 3PM guy on average efficiency with Harden at 36%. No one thought prime Harden wasn&rsquo;t lethal from 3 just cuz he was only shooting 36%. Teams weren&rsquo;t saying &ldquo;let&rsquo;s give him some space, make him prove he can hit those&rdquo;, they were guarding him so tight he routinely got fouled shooting step back 3s. This hypothetical player would make 1000 more 3s than Harden has</p>

Assuming Curry makes 250 3 points per seasons (he made 357 last year), he will likely surpass 4,500 mark. If a player makes 3 three points per game and play 80 games per season, it would take 19 years to reach 4,500 mark. And, if he makes a current pace for the next 3+ years, 5,000 3 points might not be impossible.</p>

He didn’t become a starter until his fourth season and even then the 3 point revolution didn’t start until like his 7th season.</p>

<p>Players who started their career from 2022 onwards (to throw out the shortened COVID seasons) will start out shooting way more 3s than Curry did until he was in his late 20s, that’ll give them almost a decade on Curry to catch up.</p>

AKA, they will have to be one of the best shooters ever.</p>

<p>Luka is the most likely to catch him right now, but he&rsquo;s only a third of the way there so is on pace to need to play a total of ~18 seasons all at the same volume and efficiency to pass Curry. And that&rsquo;s only if Curry never makes another 3, which is unlikely to say the least. It&rsquo;s more looking like 20 seasons for Luka when it&rsquo;s all said and done.</p>

<p>People are underselling how insane Curry is and how hard it will be to beat. It will be beaten, but it won&rsquo;t be easy, and it won&rsquo;t be a random dude.</p>

<p>Curry played multiple years in college and didn’t start off his career as the de facto #1 option with the green light to throw up 10 3PT attempts per night.</p>

If he averages 250 3 points per season (He made 357 last season), he will likely reach 4,500+ 3 points made. It would take Ant 22 seasons to reach that mark while playing 80 games per season. If someone makes 3.5 3 points per season (Curry&rsquo;s average is 3.9), it still would take 16+ seasons (average 80 games per season).

<p>Like, if the game changes where you just have your best three point shooter jack 20 threes per game because analytics say that&rsquo;s best, then it could fall due to volume.</p>

<p>James Harden isn&rsquo;t a better three point shooter than Ray Allen,  but he&rsquo;s going to far surpass him. It could be something like that, but more extreme.</p>

      <label for="ll7vnjm" class="commentText"><p>They took different kinds of threes for sure, so I guess it&rsquo;s hard to compare.</p>

<p>However, Ray Allen was a star player who led the league in three point volume many seasons. He definitely would have shot more of them had he played in the modern era. They used to run floppy action to get Ray Allen 18 foot jumpers. Those would certainly be three point attempts now, and he would be shooting roughly 40% on them.</p>

<p>I think if Ray Allen played at the same time as Harden, he&rsquo;d be ahead of Harden in three point makes.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s gonna need to be someone shooting +10 3pa per game on above-average efficiency. Trae doesn&rsquo;t have the volume or efficiency to go from 3 to do so.</p>

<p>Buddy Hield of all people actually has more 3-pointers made in his first 8 seasons than Curry had in his first 8 (it&rsquo;s 1923 vs 1917, so pretty close).</p>

<p>Buddy won&rsquo;t do it because he started way too old, but if someone just slightly better came in at 19 and played till 39, they would have a chance.</p>

      <label for="ll6vnfp" class="commentText"><p>I personally don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll see a better shooter in my lifetime but I do think someone will break his total 3s record and it probably won&rsquo;t be that long unless he plays at a high level till 40. Might see his season record too if basketball continues to pursue 3s over all even if efficiency is lower. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any realistic chance someone breaks lebrons total points record (dont get me started on post season) without a massive change to the game simply due to the odds of having to play at a high level with very little missed time for a career about 4x longer than the average. I mean we have KD in the league who is in the argument for best pure scorer not named Jordan and is still going strong after coming into the league at 19 and getting started early and yet is about 10,000 points behind Kareem which means he&rsquo;d have to play identical to last year for the next 5 years straight and might still be a little short. That&rsquo;d put him at 40 years old and still 2000 behind current Lebron. Obviously we have Luka who came in already an all pro and is going off but would have to keep his current pace for another 14 years to still be just short of Kareem and 38 years old. It would take someone coming in at an all pro level averaging 30, playing at 75+ games a year for over 20 years, and depending on how long Lebron continues still probably be short.</p>

      <label for="ll72rce" class="commentText"><p>The odd are pretty in your favor that you will see a better shooter in your lifetime disregarding societal collapse.  The NBA has only been around 75 years and only the last 30 has had real outreach.  And in those 30 years alone is when we saw the best shooters like Steph or Reggie emerge. As the population grows, and as more and more people try basketball it becomes a pretty easy bet that if you give it another 60 years (double the history of the NBA) you would see another Steph level shooter emerge from the prospects.</p>

<p>As much as we wanna call guys like Steph or Bron once in a lifetime, we have the historical data, they&rsquo;re more like once every 20 years.  And lifetime is a fair bit longer than 20 years.</p>

Truthfully I don&rsquo;t really know what it would take for me to consider someone a better shooter. 400 3s at 45% is insanity that doesn&rsquo;t even make sense. The mix of volume, efficiency, and how often he did it in high pressure situations it&rsquo;s going to be really hard to beat and there&rsquo;s a pretty big gap between him and #2. I&rsquo;ll have time to be wrong though I guess.</p>

      <label for="ll7f0zr" class="commentText"><p>Agree on Steph but Lebron is much closer to once in a lifetime talent based solely on his otherworldly athletic ability. He was a grown man with springs at 18. Then has upheld his athleticism for over 20 years now and is still a better athlete than 20 year old athletic freaks getting drafted today. All while barely getting injured for over 2 decades. I can remember a couple groin pulls that bothered him for a couple seasons but no catastrophic injuries during that time either. He is just built different and even though I don’t see him as the goat, his longevity at such a high level has been once in a lifetime. Which is why him and Kareem are going to be so hard to overtake. Both of them are physical marvels, like Wilt too. We’ll see if Wemby can hold up to the grind to be another freak that last decades.</p>

      <label for="ll6znb9" class="commentText"><p>Random tangent, but in the Basketball GM game, the player overalls are such that prime LeBron and Jordan are usually somewhere in the 81-84 range. So when you sim enough seasons it’s very possible to eventually have a player who’s not only better than both but potentially even significantly so. A 99 overall in this game would be a god amongst men, literally unstoppable and unbeatable.</p>

<p>For fun I’ve dropped a 99 on various worst record in the league teams over history and seen how they did. Adding him to the 2017 20 win Nets? 79-3 championship with a single playoff loss to GS in the finals. Averaged 58/19/8 on 56/39/94 with a TS% of 76. And averaged 70/24/8 in the finals lmao.</p>

<p>the way basketball changed to favor more 3&rsquo;s is the biggest factor in curry/harden/dame passing ray/reggie.</p>

<p>whoever the elite shooter was in this current era was always gonna beat those records almost by default.</p>

<p>difference is now the era shift is already complete, so now beating the record is just straight up beating the record. someone has to have a better mix of amazing shooting, long career, and avoiding injury.</p>

<p>3pa have already plateau&rsquo;d, youre not gonna beat curry because 2035 basketball has more 3&rsquo;s.</p>

I turned 40 this year so I&rsquo;m old by some standards but not <em>that</em> old per se, and yet it feels like I witnessed so many &ldquo;unbreakable&rdquo; records fall by the wayside. 72 wins, the career scoring mark, the triple-double average, etc.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;ve found is that you really just never know. Even when it came to Michael Jordan&rsquo;s retirement, I remember the consensus among many being something along the lines of, &ldquo;The greatest we&rsquo;ll ever see.&rdquo; Of course, LeBron debuted the very next year; and that&rsquo;s not to say LeBron is better or not, but the next legend was sitting right there on the doorstep while so many were so sure we&rsquo;d never see anything like it again.</p>

      <label for="ll7mpiu" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think you understand how hard that extra 30+ points is. For one thing there is a minutes problem. No one is playing 48 minutes in a game. The only games that see heavy minutes loads for players of that caliber are playoff games, and I just can&rsquo;t see a playoff team letting a player cook like that. It is also much harder to score now i.e. it takes more effort, and anyone putting up that kind of volume is going to wear down as the game goes on making them more inefficient.</p>

<p>For it to broken pace would probably need to shoot up again. It was looking possible last season before the NBA put the clamps on scoring. If games are reaching 150 points it is possible that a team lets a player get to 100 if the opposing team is winning by 20+, but the window for that to happen is very narrow as the NBA has shown they don&rsquo;t want to promote that offensively heavy style of play.</p>

<p>The only other way I can see it happening is if some 7&rsquo;10&rdquo; super freak comes around. I could almost see a team just parking him on one side of the court and playing 4v5 on defense if he is a guaranteed bucket on the other end.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to say it is impossible, but I do not expect it to happen during my lifetime.</p>

      <label for="ll6sr75" class="commentText"><p>Depending on the sport, there are some records that are out of reach simply because of how the league and rules have changed.</p>

<p>No pitcher is ever going to get anywhere near any wins record, for example. I would also imagine Gretzky&rsquo;s points record is untouchable too. I think the main problem with Reggie&rsquo;s assessment of Ray Allen&rsquo;s record is that Ray incrementally beat Reggie, he didn&rsquo;t blow the record out of the water.</p>

<p>The true unbeatable records are the ones that came in an era where volume was high (like NHL scoring in the 80s or 3pt shooting now) and even by the standards of the time, there was someone just heads and shoulders above everyone else. It has to be more than just the highest scoring guy from the highest scoring era.</p>

<p>Bjorn Borg’s 5 Wimbledon titles in a row seemed insane when he retired (Federer won Wimbledon AND the US Open 5 years in a row)</p>

<p>Then Pete Sampras came along in the 90s and won 14 grand slams, which also seemed untouchable at the time (Nadal has won the French open alone 14 times)</p>

<p>Now we have Novak Djokovic and his 24 slams, which seems impossible to match in this day and age (Margaret Court is tied for this record in the 60s but on the men’s side only Nadal and Federer are anywhere close)</p>

<p>This also means that it will take us a while to recognize when players start to approach Tier 1 - record and GOAT contention. Maybe the early 30s, because only then would they start to approach the previous players records and targets.</p>

<p>Imagine having to wait another 12 years to know if it&rsquo;s time to start thinking of Alcaraz as a good player. Or another 10 for Mbappe.</p>

Triples record is likely safe because ballparks won&rsquo;t ever have fences that deep again. Same with Cobb&rsquo;s batting average (more room=more hits). Rickey Henderson&rsquo;s is an interesting case of a record that seems nigh unbeatable not because of rule or park changes but simply because he&rsquo;s so ludicrously far ahead of second place.</p>

Playing at an all-star level for 20+ years without any significant time off is just the first step. Another one I think will be near unbreakable for a similar reason is Brett Favre&rsquo;s consecutive starts record. It just requires so much time and one injury can throw it all off.</p>

      <label for="ll7pkzk" class="commentText"><p>The rebounding records are the ones that I think will require a major change in the way the game is played for anyone to sniff the record.</p>

<p>Stockton’s assists/steals records are crazy, but we’ll eventually see an another elite point guard with Lebron-esque longevity, and things will get easier if the average pace keeps climbing.</p>

<p>Wemby might be the guy to take down Hakeem’s blocks record. He needs to stay healthy, which is no small feat, but it’s probably the most achievable of the major counting stat records. Something like fifteen 72 game seasons at his rookie BPG pace gets it done.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that defense also played a huge role in winning the series. They held Boston under 100 points for the final three games, all wins for GS. They made every possession a war.</p>

He was injured early on but showed incredible spurts with his ball handling that they decided he was the future. In highschool I used to watch his highlights and emulate his low centered dribbling and would absolutely fool defenders, but it takes a lot of core strength. He also heaves long 3s from his core instead of using his legs, which helps when you fatigue as a shooter or are exhausted. Durant famously has a lot of legs in his jump shot so he can end up short in really late games if he plays a ton of minutes. That&rsquo;s why he such a great shooter in all spans of the game. He can run a ton during the game and even when his legs get tired he doesn&rsquo;t have to alter his shot. It&rsquo;s one of his greatest strengths as a player really.</p>

      <label for="ll8in33" class="commentText"><p>Nah people sorta get this wrong.  It&rsquo;s super fucked up he was blacklisted, but he was also past his prime at that point, we saw the best of his career.</p>

<p>His peak was averaging bout 19 ppg and 5 apg in his mid 20&rsquo;s for about 4 years.  His last year as a starter, before he got blacklisted, was at the age of 31 averaging 13 and 2 apg.  Then he played a year off the bench, got hurt, and averaged 7 ppg at 32.</p>

<p>Then he was &ldquo;blacklisted&rdquo; but came back a couple years later and did nothing.  It&rsquo;s not that we were shorted his prime cause he was blacklisted, he was just shorted a couple years at the tail end of his career.  He started and played a ton his entire prime. The NBA didn&rsquo;t decide to blacklist an elite player, teams just decided, for someone that&rsquo;s gonna come off the end of the bench anyway, they wanted someone with less of a controversy.  Fucked up for sure, but not in the way people spin it</p>

      <label for="ll6r65i" class="commentText"><p>I think the current nba realizes that no single strategy works above any others. It entirely depends on your personnel. You tailor the team strategy to your best player&rsquo;s strengths and make up for their weaknesses. You have a Steph so you make an offense that generates open looks. Then you get good defenders like dray and klay to help on that side and hide Steph as best you can. You surround a generational passer like lebron or jokic, you surround him with shooters and cutters to force defense to pick their poison.</p>

      <label for="ll6t6rj" class="commentText"><p>Ok, but those are all based around spacing and shooting. There is no Shaq, Ewing, Yao style centers in the league. From the 60s-2000 the league was a big man league, inside dominated, with elite shooters taking 3 3pt per game. </p>

<p>Do we ever go back to some semblance of that with the power center being the force of the game? Today we have giant centers like Jokic and Joel who are about shooting and spacing, not inside dominance. Is that era dead forever, or will we shift back? </p>

      <label for="ll6z5eb" class="commentText"><p>Think it depends. In some ways the continual post up offense is dead for the simple reason of it&rsquo;s basically always a contested shot, and the math is going to support working the ball to an open shot/ clear driving lane over that. However I think you can absolutely see a scenario where a team&rsquo;s best player is a dominant inside non-shooting big that a team just throws shooters around like the Dwight Magic team.</p>

<p>Craziest meta change stat is 3PA - as low as 3/game in the mid 80s, mid teens by the late 90s, and at 35 today. 10x more threes shot now than in early Jordan era. </p>

Three pointers are too efficient compared to twos, until teams/players can generate twos at a &amp;gt;60% clip on the regular, then the three is always going to be the dominant strategy. And there&rsquo;s just not going to be enough players that can shoot at that high a clip on the regular (I&rsquo;m not talking about dunking dudes, I&rsquo;m talking about dudes having to generate their own offense).</p>

      <label for="ll7hyp8" class="commentText"><p>Curry is generally really good at scoring. A lot of other teams tied different approaches to maximize offense (most notably in his time, Houston Rockets with Harden), but Curry really didn&rsquo;t invent anything himself except doing the thing everyone wants to do way better than them.</p>

<p>3&amp;gt;2, but 0&amp;lt;2, that&rsquo;s what all these obligatory comments miss. It&rsquo;s only a &ldquo;genius trick&rdquo; if you actually are that good to make the shots, that&rsquo;s the difficult part, not just deciding to shoot threes lol. A lot of people decided to shoot threes every year lol. The problem is that when you miss it&rsquo;s 0 points and opponent ball, not that they are so stupid they didn&rsquo;t think of shooting.</p>

<p>I cannot fathom how people say that, really. It&rsquo;s really exactly like saying &ldquo;Shaq O&rsquo;Neal started the trend of being really big, and made people realize that dunking the ball in the basket is easier that shooting&rdquo;. Like really just the concept is not the hard part of it lol.</p>

<p>Believe it or not the concept IS the hard part of getting it started, because so many people are mired in old school thinking.  People don&rsquo;t want to shoot as many threes as they think they should because they&rsquo;ve still got some concept of it &ldquo;being bad basketball&rdquo;, when in reality we&rsquo;re probably STILL not shooting enough threes.</p>

<p>Steph is absolutely capable of averaging 35+ in his prime, like you said his first and second MVP years (73-9 and unanimous MVP) he sat out so many 4th quarters where he had 35 points and 6 threes already. Would’ve had so many more 40 and 50 bombs those years if the Dubs weren’t so good at putting teams away.</p>

      <label for="ll6hx3y" class="commentText"><p>To expand on your point: Ray averaged 5.7 3PA for his career, Steph has had 5 seasons where he averaged more than <strong>twice</strong> that many 3PA and was only below 5.7 his first three seasons. Ray’s last two years in Seattle were his only years shooting over 8 threes a game while Steph has shot over 8 threes every year since 2015.</p>

<p>It’d be interesting to see where Ray would’ve ended up if he came up 15 years later and shot ~twice as many 3s as he did.</p>

      <label for="ll6ko4e" class="commentText"><p>Not saying that Ray isn’t one of the all time greats, but Curry had to be a special kind of great to get that many shots up. Curry literally changed the game in a way that not only allows him to take more threes, but also opened the game to allow others to do the same. I know Ray played in an era where guards were allowed to be more hands on defensively, which you could argue held him back, but Curry broke the mold and probably would have made more 3s in Ray’s era if he played then too.</p>

<p>Curry can basically make any 3 as soon as he&rsquo;s past HC.</p>

<p>Catch and shoot, corner, deep, fadeaway, step back,logo etc..and he&rsquo;s great at each of them</p>

      <label for="ll6r1bd" class="commentText"><p>Part of it is Steph’s skill for sure, but also part of it is Ray’s vs Steph’s game and the coaching philosophies their coaches employed. Steph has shot more 3s than 2s every season since 15-16 while Ray didn’t do that until he was in Miami, largely because Ray is bigger and more athletic than Steph and Ray could get to the rim and yam on people. It made sense for him to attack the rim more.</p>

<p>Kerr deservingly giving Curry the green light was also huge in this, and as you said, revolutionized the game. But had Ray come into a league that valued 3s like it does today, he might still have the record. If Ray shot just 2 more threes per game (and hit at the same clip), he would have 4,013 3pm, which would be 266 more than Steph currently.</p>

<p>I love Ray Allen. I grew up right next to Storrs and was just starting to play rec basketball in elementary school when he was at UConn. I was at his jersey retirement in Gampel. I have 4 different Ray Allen jerseys (UConn, Sonics, Celtics, Lincoln High Jesus Shuttlesworth). But Steph is a better shooter. There’s lots of evidence backing that, including Steph shooting 2.6% better from deep than Ray on their careers. It’d be a fun race though for the twilight of Steph’s career to see if he could catch Ray had Ray shot closer to say 9 threes a game.</p>

It really took Steph and somewhat Kerr to change that mentality. Kerr sorta finally through up his hands and let Steph just shoot. You can pretty much pinpoint the date in which things started to change… March 11, 2015 Go check out the highlight from that date and it will be a top search item. If you were to do that in the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s you’d find yourself on the bench.</p>

<p>Yes, the Warriors took this to the next level, but people forget that the Spurs ran a version of the long ball in the 2013 and especially 2014 Finals. Despite Pop&rsquo;s distaste for the 3, he saw high value plays recommended by his staff. Hell, those late 2000s Orlando teams look very much like a modern spread offense; it just hadn&rsquo;t been refined yet, and Jameer Nelson was not Steph or Dame.</p>

<p>Even then that’s one I really doubt, there just aren’t as many possessions now, and if a great scorer was that hot the game should be a blowout by the time he has 50.</p>

<p>Also the current nba is just way too tiring for anyone to score 100 now in a close game.</p>

<p>I remember around this time arguing with this old dude that I used to talk basketball with. He was a regular at the restaurant I worked at and would come in almost every night. I told him that the game was changing before our eyes and that 25 attempts was gonna become the norm for teams and he just couldn’t agree. Because for his entire life, the 3 was mostly demonized.</p>

People may score at a higher efficiency and more volume, but I don’t think anyone will have the desire or the longevity to play this game for 20 years. Especially considering the crazy salaries.

      <label for="ll7ffru" class="commentText"><p>They shot a lot less threes back then, Reggie and anyone else from that era could not fathom a world where a guy would regularly shoot almost 900 3&rsquo;s in a season the way Curry did last year (876) and in 2015 (886), just look at the highest season 3PA for the guys considered the best shooters in NBA history:</p>

<ul>
<li>Larry Bird 3PA 1987-88: 237</li>
<li>Reggie Miller 3PA 1996-97: 536</li>
<li>Ray Allen 3PA 2005-2006: 653</li>
<li>Steph Curry 3PA 2015-2016: 886</li>
</ul>

<p>You can almost fit Bird&rsquo;s single season high for 3&rsquo;s between both Ray and Reggie&rsquo;s highs and Steph&rsquo;s, and you have to realize in 1996 the most threes taken in the league was 604 which is far below Steph&rsquo;s 876 or 886, so even the guy chucking it the most didn&rsquo;t come close to Steph&rsquo;s attempts</p>

<p>This was also still the era of feeding the big man in the post or guys looking for the mid-range jumpers like Jordan, shooting a 3 was still considered a specialist thing</p>

      <label for="ll8f2uj" class="commentText"><p>The game changed. 🤷</p>

<p>When Reggie said that, people were taking 2-3 threes per game, and hitting one if they were lucky.</p>

<p>In 2011 NBA, there were 18 3PA total per team per game, with around 6 pts per game being scored from beyond the arc. That&rsquo;s two made threes per game. That&rsquo;s 20 seconds of work in a Curry Flurry.</p>

<p>In 2024, both stats have essentially doubled, and that&rsquo;s on average; for every game someone scores less than 6 pts from beyond the arc, there&rsquo;s some team dropping 18-20 on 3PAs alone.</p>

<p>Steph Curry changed the way the NBA is played.</p>
