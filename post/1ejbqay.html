<p>“It was a tough decision, but it is all about comfort level, and like I said, I’ve known these guys (Team USA players) for a long time and I just felt more comfortable than on the other side (France),” Embiid said Saturday after Team USA <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5678149/2024/08/03/team-usa-puerto-rico-olympics-basketball/" target="_blank">finished off pool play at the Olympics with a 104-83 win over Puerto Rico</a> in which there were a lot more boos cast in Embiid’s direction.</p>

<p>“There was some concern with the other side,” Embiid said. “Comfort level was huge. I always say I’m going to be where I’m wanted and these guys wanted me.”</p>

      <label for="lgcrffw" class="commentText"><p>I think its pretty clear why Embiid chose the US.  He chose the team that has the best chance of winning Gold.  The reality is that MVPs and Championships are what makes your legacy.  Being the best player on a good but not great basketball team isn&rsquo;t good enough unless you win.  Adding Olympic gold to your career resume only helps his legacy and he has a far better chance of getting gold in the US than France.</p>

      <label for="lgcmimm" class="commentText"><p>I think Vardon is trying to say that Embiid is the one suggesting the French didn’t want him, an excuse that he debunks in the article.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Embiid saying he felt wanted by Team USA, but not by the French squad, is either new or rare, and it certainly can’t apply to French basketball president Jean-Pierre Siutat or general manager Boris Diaw, who helped Embiid get a French passport. Nor could it apply to the president of the actual country, Emmanuel Macron, whom Embiid said called him to try to convince him to pick France.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Embiid is always full of excuses. Previously he claimed that the French pushed him too hard, but if that’s true then how could he insinuate that they didn’t want him enough? He wrote a letter begging to be a French citizen but then later he decided that he was uncomfortable with French colonialism? Whatever bs best suits the moment I guess.</p>

<p>The French spectators at the Olympics in France are booing him because he (allegedly? are there questions regarding authenticity? an agent wrote it and he signed it?) wrote a letter to their President asking for French citizenship on the basis of wanting to play for France in the Olympics. Then a year later he got US citizenship and was no longer interested in France.</p>

<p>He was in his rights to do that. But nobody should be surprised there will be French spectators booing him.</p>

<p>If the 1996 Olympics were held in Lagos instead of Atlanta Hakeem might have gotten booed as well mind you — and no, it’s not a direct equivalent, just the closest practical one.</p>

      <label for="lgcog8h" class="commentText"><p>In the US? Not really. The late 90s and 2000s were like the peak of &ldquo;color-blind&rdquo; America. Of course, some will say treating race like that is racist in itself, and those voices essentially &ldquo;won&rdquo; in the 2010s and the color blind status quo collapsed and was replaced by the &ldquo;equity&rdquo; school of thought. And a reactionary movement started in response to that and now people are generally more extreme.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure he and pascal would love to play for Cameroon but they aren&rsquo;t able to help during qualifying due to the schedule of that during the nba season. And they aren&rsquo;t good enough to qualify without.  </p>

<p>Once he got his American citizenship, he changed his mind. Totally understand, I would rather play next to LeBron than Evan Fournier too. But I hope you can also understand why some French people would feel annoyed by this after he promised to play for them first</p>

<p>I have no problem with French people booing him or being angry at him. However, I don’t think Americans should question or make fun of his decision to represent the country that is basically his home. He spends more than half of his life in USA. This  country is his home and makes him who he is today. In contrast, he never lives in France.</p>

      <label for="lgcu2g6" class="commentText"><p>Lol I don&rsquo;t get how any of you are defending Embiid.</p>

<p>The man wrote a letter to the president of France asking for citizenship with the intent of playing for their national basketball team. Then when he got the French citizenship, he chose to play for the US team. All of this was initiated by Embiid. He asked for the citizenship, he asked to play for their national team if given citizenship. He chose to play for the US team.</p>

<p>The French never would have booed him if he didn&rsquo;t do this punk move. The French have every right to boo this this guy. Like all of his failures in the playoffs he tries to shift the blame onto someone else.</p>
