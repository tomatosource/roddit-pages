      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ef4cgr/kevin_durant_gets_into_a_lengthy_twitterx/"><p>Kevin Durant gets into a lengthy Twitter/X argument with a fan who believes the NBA should adopt more FIBA rules</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>This morning (which is afternoon in Paris), <a href="https://x.com/kdtrey5/status/1817925076160860188?s=46&amp;t=nMNlxFK7ubxYb-ajBNkqVA" target="_blank">KD got into some arguments with fans who are arguing for more FIBA rules in the NBA</a>. KD argues these fans don‚Äôt really know what they‚Äôre talking about. Here is the full argument, for those that don‚Äôt have Twitter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&amp;gt;<strong>Twitter user</strong>: Please @NBA adopt more @FIBA rules and let us see the best really think the game and play the game like it&rsquo;s meant to be played</p>

<p><strong>KD</strong>: I swear yall just be yappin. What rules u wanna see man?</p>

<p>&amp;gt;<strong>Twitter user</strong>: I want to see the 3 seconds back and that&rsquo;s it&hellip;. you disagree?  More movement less ISO / Quicker Decisions - keep 3s the same as NBA - Can&rsquo;t knock off the rim (that&rsquo;s dumb)</p>

<p><strong>KD</strong>: If u want to eliminate defensive 3 seconds then the games will be slower.</p>

<p>&amp;gt;<strong>Twitter user</strong>: I don&rsquo;t disagree with that (i&rsquo;m 40 so i&rsquo;m late 90s basketball lo)  &hellip; but more schemes &amp; quicker decisions offensively not as much holding
NBA is fine man lol it&rsquo;s the best product in the world with the best players PERIOD - would love to see it &hellip; i&rsquo;m watching yall do it now</p>

<p><strong>KD</strong>: The beauty of basketball is not callin all them sets but playing off instincts and lettin the talent dictate the game..gettin out in transition, driving and kicking, playing random basketball. U want a trick play every possession like it‚Äôs football. That‚Äôs not why our game is beautiful</p>

<p>&amp;gt;<strong>Twitter user</strong>: That works when your team is stacked 1-5. It does ‚Äòt work when you need to get the best out of every player on the floor in different aspects (screens, passes, cuts) when your team has guys all playing roles, you need play calling.</p>

<p><strong>KD</strong>: Random basketball!! U not comprehending what I‚Äôm saying. U can RANDOMLY set a screen, RANDOMLY back cut, RANDOMLY make a pass to the open man. Focus on what I‚Äôm saying</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So do you guys agree with KD that FIBA rules wouldn‚Äôt make NBA basketball ‚Äúmore beautiful‚Äù?</p>

      <label for="lfih6h4" class="commentText"><p>the reason FIBA is a better watch is less timeouts, your brain is not bombarded constantly by NO FLEX, ZONE and the product just seems cleaner. the twitter user lost an opportunity to throw actual good argumets rather than defensive 3 seconds and &ldquo;sharing the ball&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though from a commercial pov.. you‚Äôre of course dead-wrong.  The NBA TV Rights deals.. have been ballooning a ridiculous amount.. contract after contract after contract.  Right alongside player contracts, and team valuation.</p>

<p>So yeah.. unfortunately you‚Äôre just 100%, very demonstrably, dead wrong üò¢</p>

<p>That doesn‚Äôt necessarily prove OP wrong tho because it just means things are going well commercially for the NBA, it doesn‚Äôt mean it wouldn‚Äôt have gone better otherwise.</p>

<p>And there‚Äôs not really any fair comparison for how it would‚Äôve gone otherwise. It‚Äôs not like NBA viewership is on a climb.</p>

<p>I watched yesterday&rsquo;s game on the Olympic feed and didn&rsquo;t have a single break/ad on TV or in the arena. It was amazing. Only advertising allowed in the Olympics is the kit manufacturers.</p>

<p>American sports are commercials with sport breaks.</p>

      <label for="lfin870" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s 5 timeouts in 40 minutes vs 7 in 48 and the NBA coaches rarely use all 7. Also, FIBA has a TV timeout rule, if a team doesn&rsquo;t call one during the first 5 minutes of a quarter, a TV timeout is called.</p>

<p>The thing with timeouts is not the total amount, it&rsquo;s the duration. FIBA timeouts last one minute, always one minute, the timeout is called and it&rsquo;s 60 seconds, there&rsquo;s no time for players chit-chat. They all go to the bench and listen to their coach.</p>

<p>The NBA on theory has regular timeouts that last 75 seconds but that&rsquo;s never true, they always last at least 3 minutes. Even 20 second timeouts lasted much longer than that.</p>

      <label for="lfiobdt" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s obviously made the game richer in return. I am not defending Silver, but what he has done has opened things up to where we can have multiple 200m/5year contracts for people who are barely stars. The flip side of this is that the game is basically a giant commercial and the audience basically loses out on the sport.</p>

<p>In a more meta perspective, it&rsquo;s all a distraction and they want to occupy as much of your time as they can to make the most amount of money for every single stakeholder excluding the consumer.</p>

      <label for="lfj6gbl" class="commentText"><p>Soccer is a dirty dirty business. We have so many issues with corruption and literal governments owning teams. The corruption and dirt is all behind the scenes though. It doesn&rsquo;t affect the game itself. I think American corruption, if you will, is more up front and in your face.</p>

<p>There are some really big downsides to how soccer is run that&rsquo;s for sure, but at least the product doesn&rsquo;t suffer. It&rsquo;s the same for other sports. I think a big difference is if the owners try to pull some shit the fans go out and protest like crazy, making the lives of owners very hard.</p>

<p>Imagine if NBA fans gathered a bit, just 100 people started bringing signs and chanting in unison for them to cut commercials or get gambling out of our faces, what a massive effect that would have. You&rsquo;d be called un-American though and naive, of course the NBA is just there to make money, it&rsquo;s not for the fans.</p>

      <label for="lfjr7pr" class="commentText"><p>It‚Äôs awful for the long term health of the sport. First of all, I gotta pay to watch my own damn team even though I live in the area (I mean I pirate but most don‚Äôt) so we‚Äôre already paying for the product. Secondly, I don‚Äôt remember the last time I watched a non-playoff game without multi-tasking because most of the watch time isn‚Äôt basketball so I‚Äôm never really glued to the game. Simply put, except for mostly the bigger fans, in this day and age there are so many more engaging entertainment options and we‚Äôre gonna see an entire generation grow up on highlights and they‚Äôll never transition into being real fans of the game if the product is stands as it is.</p>

      <label for="lfjv82l" class="commentText"><p>The way it‚Äôs awful to watch your own team when it‚Äôs not on a national broadcast + the disgusting amount of ads/live game timeouts are why I‚Äôve fallen out of love watching basketball and moved onto football. 90+ minutes of non stop coverage and the ads are largely non invasive, it‚Äôs just more enjoyable even if the times aren‚Äôt advantageous to me</p>

      <label for="lfk952a" class="commentText"><p>I‚Äôm assuming you mean football and not American football because you talk about a disgusting amount of ads‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Quite honestly, I feel like of the sports I watch (baseball, NFL, basketball) basketball is the quickest sporting event and it‚Äôs not really even close.</p>

<p>Baseball added a pitch clock to help speed up the game so you can get some similarly paced games but it can still stretch well past the 3 hour range.</p>

<p>The national games can be a slog, but local games are about 2 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> hours which is definitely acceptable. Would love if they could get the product down to about 2 hours though.</p>

      <label for="lfih4bz" class="commentText"><p>I always dig KD talking ball, always hoped he‚Äôd become a sports pundit afterwards. He‚Äôs just interesting to listen to talk about basketball, even on a goofy platform like twitter.</p>

<p>Like in this case he‚Äôs talking about the sort of chaotic nature of the sport in the NBA, he likes the impromptu style where you‚Äôre not calling a set play every time up and often kinda just letting momentum and reading the defense live dictate what you do.</p>

<p>Obviously that‚Äôs fairly controversial, many people like a more structured, ‚Äúteam-oriented‚Äù game, but it‚Äôs so understandable coming from KD who is so adept at taking the ball up and just killing his defender on a whim. Not that international rules seem to be a large impediment to him, but he may feel like the more restricted form hurts the poetry of the game, I guess.</p>

      <label for="lfijf87" class="commentText"><p>I feel like KD is just straight up wrong about that though. There&rsquo;s a reason the 2017 Warriors are unanimously considered the best team of the KD era and it&rsquo;s because he bought in to the Warriors style way more that first year. In 2018 he wanted to just &ldquo;hoop&rdquo; and it made the team so much easier to play against. Houston basically designed their whole defense to let KD iso and live with the results because it was less effective than the ball movement style they normally played.</p>

<p>Obviously there are times when you really need to just iso and beat your guy 1 on 1, which is part of the reason they got KD. But for a full game effectively running plays and sets will be the better option.</p>

      <label for="lfiw51g" class="commentText"><p>Kobe Bryant has said he hates &ldquo;accidental basketball&rdquo;. The triangle has set plays and counters and that&rsquo;s why he knew how to defeat teams and schemes. There&rsquo;s structure there but creavtity and final decision is up to the players to read and react. Technically both can be true, but KD is not being in-depth of his answer to really challenge the guy&rsquo;s argument. Because FIBA does look better than NBA because it strikes a good balance of offense/defense without having one huge advantage over the other. No ticky tack fouls, no flopping, and etc.</p>

      <label for="lfiop4l" class="commentText"><p>Golden State doesn&rsquo;t run a lot of plays though. They do play random basketball as KD said.</p>

<p>Golden State has their offensive principles, but they&rsquo;re generally only running plays in specific scenarios (ATO, inbounds plays, end of quarters). Otherwise, they just kind of read and react.</p>

<p>The read and react nature of their offense is why some players struggle in their system. They&rsquo;re not just running plays. They&rsquo;re constantly making reads. If you can&rsquo;t do that, it&rsquo;s hard to play for them.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think 2018 was so much that KD stopped &ldquo;buying in&rdquo; as it was that one team in particular (Houston) developed a roster and defense specifically designed to counteract all the cutting and screening. They switched everything and were really disciplined not to give up a lot of slips to the basket. It turned into KD iso ball a little more than they wanted because that&rsquo;s what Houston forced them into.</p>

<p>The FIBA rules debate aside, KD wasn&rsquo;t arguing for iso ball here. He was saying that the random style they played in Golden State was beautiful (without specifically mentioning Golden State).</p>

Steph deciding to reroute and back screen someone and then pop out for 3 isn‚Äôt planned. Draymond getting the ball on the short roll and hitting the open man isn‚Äôt planned. Iggy cutting for an open dunk wasn‚Äôt planned. Klay just shooting with a hand in his face wasn‚Äôt planned. KD played his best ball under that chaos in GS and that‚Äôs why he prefers read and react ball to running sets all day.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not a personal attack on you, but I find it allways a bit weird, when ppl argue using extremes, there is a whole spectrum between every play is a set play and there are no set plays at all.</p>

<p>Even if they abolished defensive 3 seconds I strongly doubt, that it will lead to a league solely based on set plays, just because of the 80game regular season schedule and the limited time ppl have to train together.</p>

<p>We see a ton of &ldquo;sets&rdquo; already especially in playoffs, it&rsquo;s not like guys like Lively II or Aaron Gordon randomly show up in the dunker spot all the time. And as someone who watches both NBA and EuroLeague I&rsquo;m pretty sure, that it won&rsquo;t devolve into set plays only, since it is not the case in EuroLeague either and there is a lot less offensive talent available then in the NBA, but guys like Teodosiƒá, Lull, Rodriguez or Calathes allways were free to scramble and create for themselves and others.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m the end I think both have their advantages, NBA offenses often look stale, spamming a hand full of plays, with players forcing 1v1s and taking a ton of contested shots, more structure would make these games more enjoyable imo, but EuroLeague games also often devolve into defensive slug feats, but at least they are then close games, that generate more excitement then some of the playoff-blow outs we&rsquo;ve seen in recent years, even between somewhat evenly matched teams.</p>

      <label for="lfj7o9i" class="commentText"><p>I mean, we aren&rsquo;t arguing against a theoretical here. Basketball under FIBA rules is literally the international standard, it&rsquo;s how everyone in the world plays outside the NBA. We already know what that basketball looks like and it&rsquo;s still a fast-paced and dynamic sport. There&rsquo;s simply more nuance and long-term strategy to it (neccessary since you get less opportunities for coaches to make adjustments mid-match). And all due respect to KD but NBA high level play can hardly be said to be chaotic either- everyone on the field knows their role and how to go about doing it, otherwise even the simplest plays like PnR or screen-outs wouldn&rsquo;t work.</p>

Diehard college bball fans tend to argue that players are too good at the professional level and the game usually turns on who has the better one or two players, rather than who is the better team.  A lot of college bball fans hate iso ball, which has taken over the NBA because of the prevalence of high-pick and rolls.</p>

<p>Obviously that‚Äôs fairly controversial, many people like a more structured, ‚Äúteam-oriented‚Äù game,</p>

<p>This is a cultural divide. I would compare it to music where you have an orchestra vs a Jazz ensemble. Orchestras are carefully choreographed and each musician needs to execute and perform their lines. Some people consider this the highest form of music. Contrast that with Jazz where the musicians are vibing off each other and improvising. Some people consider this the highest form of music. There is no definitive answer to this, its entirely subjective.</p>

<p>In the KD exchange you can see this clash play out, where KD is advocating for Jazz and letting the players &ldquo;play&rdquo; and the other guy wants more structure and less improv. In America this divide plays out along cultural.racial lines where traditionally black people love the creativity and improv of the players expressing themselves. This is at odds with white americans who value organized top down structures that dont allow a lot of room of individual expression. Its also why these people hate player empowerment because they think it undercuts the organizational hierarchy. To be clear, I am not implying people are racist if they prefer structure over individual expression. I am just saying its a cultural preference.</p>

<p>At NBA level, players/coaches are too smart for any specific kind of set play to work for too long, you have to save those for very critical moments usually as an ATO play.</p>

<p>keep in mind a regular complaint is that 3 second rule is inconsistently called in the NBA as-is. Lowe was saying in a pod couple months ago, people are wondering if it should be bumped to 4 or 5 seconds instead.</p>

After being oversatured with the NBA rules constantly, getting introduced with different rules and a different style of game can be fresh and fascinating. But if you get oversaturated with the FIBA style, you would get tired of it as well.</p>

      <label for="lfiq5uy" class="commentText"><p>Also part of the appeal of the FIBA style for fans that primarily or even exclusively watch NBA apart from those tournaments is that (some) US players struggle with it a little and have to get out of their comfort zone compared what they do for 82+ games each year.</p>

<p>The NBA going FIBA would be my personal nightmare. If the coaches start breaking down and exploiting the rules like top coaches do in Europe the game would become ugly as fuck.</p>

      <label for="lfiwlul" class="commentText"><p>I completely agree with this. The nba rules are great imo, they just need to legitimately enforce all of the rules. Stop allowing blatant carries, illegal screens, and ridiculous travels (i am a fan of the gather step and how players have figured out how to really maximize it with euro steps and step backs so im not talking about that). Just doing those 3 things with the rules would already make the game significantly more enjoyable to watch, not to mention things like foul baiting and three seconds and everything else that just isnt consistent with the rules</p>

<p>Shai was called for a push off in the only Olympic game he played. How many push offs is he called for in the NBA regular season? Just one example, Embiid def felt the difference in officiating too. I feel that levels the playing field more than any specific rule.¬†</p>

Just yesterday, I saw Jokic do a rip through for an and 1. From what I understand, that‚Äôs what everyone complains about, right? I don‚Äôt watch enough FIBA, but I‚Äôve watched enough of the World Cup and this year‚Äôs Olympics to not see much of a difference in how the game is called.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s example 1 at 2:51 of Jokic foul-baiting by ripping through; you can even see booker complaining about the move right after:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Wv3p3U5LiYM?si=MSwVsnC184Aamztf&amp;t=169" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/Wv3p3U5LiYM?si=MSwVsnC184Aamztf&amp;t=169</a></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the second one at 3:04; not as egregious, but something you guys would complain about if embiid did it:</p>

<p>The idea that FIBA, Euroleague or national league games &ldquo;do away with superstar calls&rdquo; is laughable, first of all refs are not as good as NBA refs (they make more mistakes even though the game is slower), and second superstar calls are the order of the day. Watch any rank and file player try to defend a star and see how fast they kick him out.</p>

<p>If a offensive player initiates contact into a defender, it should not be a foul on the defender. This is something FIBA largely gets right, especially compared to the NBA.</p>

The guy KD is arguing about may actually prefer watching FIFA rules and set basketball while KD clearly prefers the opposite and neither of them are necessarily wrong in their conclusion.</p>

<p>Also this has been repeated ad nauseam but if we&rsquo;re going by the argument that no one is allowed to disagree with a professional and that they&rsquo;re always right then you might as well not have a opinion about any topic.</p>

This tanks if u don‚Äôt need that. Ur man is right. Set scheme typically is preferable in optimizing the Les skilled section of the nba. Ryan Dunn is an nba player in a very organized offensive team like Denver. He‚Äôs literally garbage in a kd style read and react free lance. Same with guys like Vanderbilt.

Timeouts are the time they are supposed to be, there aren‚Äôt 3 minute long 60 second timeouts in FIBA rules, the refs are more strict about when you can sub so you can‚Äôt take your time and run up to the scorers table and check in right before the ball is inbounded like in the NBA, you can‚Äôt call a timeout unless the ball is already dead, etc¬†</p>

<p>League does better financially when star players and teams post highlights and win. Refs are incentivized to lend every advantage possible to these stars and disadvantage any team that plays against them. This means a shit ton of foul calls and stoppage of play. FIBA has less of this bias so the games naturally feel better to watch.</p>

      <label for="lfivi6x" class="commentText"><p>There is not a single team at any level of professional basketball who runs a set play every possession. You might start a possession a particular way, and then read and react off that.</p>

<p>Denver for example runs a ton of empty-corner pick and rolls for Murray and Jokic, and then plays off that action. It‚Äôs not 2K where players are programmed to move to a particular spot. What makes Denver unique is that Jokic might be the best read-and-react player in the history of the game.</p>

<p>Yes, the ‚Äúplay random‚Äù thing has turned into a meme, but thinking that basketball is like football where you‚Äôre running a set play every possession is ludicrous.</p>
