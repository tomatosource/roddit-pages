<p>Weird joke nonetheless, but way more bizarre response, which is why everyone speculates that they have a history that would suggest further context.</p>

<p>I’m confused by other people in this thread. I’m getting downvoted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/s/EBFpVpm0lW" target="_blank">this comment</a> for suggesting that it was a bad joke, even if Mitchell’s reaction is a misinterpretation and blowing it way out of proportion, and that if it was in the corporate world, they’d both be reprimanded. That would 100% be the case in my office. Apparently thinking so is somehow indicative of ignorance/being too young to understand.</p>

      <label for="lrk1tvc" class="commentText"><p>I thought it was pretty clear that it was a joke about what they literally just talked about. Steve Kerr not getting paid for coaching the Olympics. Since Mitchell was also a coach, the joke was that he should do the show for free.</p>

<p>Mitchell seemed to take the joke well and in stride at first but then quickly got all up in his feelings and started waving his finger around like a mom who caught her kid mouthing off.</p>

<p>Then to give out dudes address where his wife and kids are is just pathetic. Even if the guy did brag about having money off air who gives a fuck.</p>

      <label for="lrkgjyu" class="commentText"><p>Mitchell says coaches are undervalued. Then, instead of agreeing with him and saying “yeah they don’t pay you enough”, which would be a relatable joke in any work environment, the host does the opposite and says “you should do this for free”.</p>

<p>People should ask themselves how they would feel if a coworker said that to them. It’s insulting to suggest that what you do has no value. And given that Mitchell had already told him to stop messing with him, the idea that it was friendly banter doesn’t really hold water.</p>

<p>“It’s just a joke bro”/“don’t you have a sense of humor”  is how jackasses try to get away with fucking with people. And if you call them on it they act all hurt and offended. Mitchell is an idiot for taking it as far as he did but the other guy was clearly pushing his buttons.</p>

      <label for="lrkt6w5" class="commentText"><p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t pay you enough&rdquo; wouldn&rsquo;t even be a joke.</p>

<p>Him saying his stupid pro bono joke was sarcasm. Have you ever heard of it?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny you get all in your feelings by asking us to ask ourselves how we would feel if someone made a sarcastic joke to us (I would feel perfectly normal and pretend to laugh  like I do at all bad jokes because my ego doesn&rsquo;t get deflated that easily) but then turn around and say &ldquo;if you call them out they get all hurt and offended&rdquo;. No man, that&rsquo;s you. Most people aren&rsquo;t so sensitive inside that they are willing to put other people&rsquo;s family at risk because our feelings got hurt.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a sense of humor, especially for bad jokes from TV co hosts who are almost always significantly less funny then they think they are, you shouldn&rsquo;t be on television. Its an entertainment industry. Remember? If you think that was him being a &ldquo;jack ass fucking with people&rdquo; then you are incredibly sensitive and need to work on that ego man. If people can manipulate you into your feelings with that bad of a sarcastic joke than I would hate to be around you at a comedy show.</p>

I literally stopped watching NBATV because of him, and that&rsquo;s saying something considering how long I suffered through Isiah Thomas.  Chris Miles really knows how to set him off.

<p>It really wasn’t. “I’m surprised coaches get a paycheck for this show. Maybe you should do this pro bono” is the opposite of what you’re suggesting.</p>

<p>“You’re right, coaches are undervalued and they should pay you more” would be a more fitting analogy if the host wasn’t trying to be a dick. Which he obviously was.</p>

<p>Mitchell might be a “known asshole” and he went too far, but I’m not surprised that redditors are having this much trouble interpreting subtext.</p>

<p>What this host is doing is the equivalent of Shaq telling Chuck “you have no rings”, which might be true but is pissy and meant to insult. Chuck is more graceful than Mitchell because he almost always ignores it. But Shaq is still being a dick.</p>

But it could have been a lot going on between them before that set started. He said “i told you not to come for me” which implies they had a discussion before going on air about something Miles either said, or said that he would say.</p>

<p>Not everyone wants to be joked around with by just anyone. If they tell you beforehand you leave it alone, respect their wishes and just keep it professional. That joke by miles wasn’t even funny and honestly added nothing to the show.</p>

      <label for="lrk45wb" class="commentText"><p>I obviously have no idea  what went on between them but that joke wasn’t a good joke at all. It felt like something was already going on with them off camera before that started. That “i told you not to come for me” felt like they had an issue before they went on and he said that to him as a “don’t say anything slick to me on air and lets just do our job and get through this”.</p>

<p>Miles however did not agree lol.</p>

<p>What are you even talking about?</p>

<p>All he did was say that Olympic coaches not getting a medal is BS, just like it would be BS if his co-host didn&rsquo;t get paid.</p>

<p>Just like you, he didn&rsquo;t understand the joke.</p>

      <label for="lrkm1ve" class="commentText"><p>What? Mitchell made a comment about how coaches aren’t valued at the international level, which is why they don’t get medals.</p>

<p>Dude’s response is “I’m surprised that coaches get paid a salary to do this show”, which could be taken as “your contribution isn’t worth your pay” and then suggested that Mitchell should opt to work for free instead, which could be seen as representative of the value he actually brings.</p>

<p>Do I think he meant all that? No. Do I agree with Mitchell’s seemingly bizarre interpretation of the joke as “you’re flaunting your wealth in my face and suggesting I’m poorer than you”? No. But it definitely was meant as a tongue-in-cheek joke toward Mitchell that would’ve been laughed off if there wasn’t already tension between the m. It’s not a good joke because it can be taken poorly, which is fine if you have that relationship, but at the very least, it’s a clear failure of “knowing your audience”</p>

Sam was probably like “I don’t really NEED this” so he just started roasting, which was a but immature but understandable.</p>

<p>Edit: ok somehow I had not seen the part where he says his actual address lmfao. Definitely wouldn’t have done that myself. Maybe the other dude is super obnoxious but that is definitely a bit wild.</p>

<p>Second edit: apparently it’s a fake address so I’m back in on the Sam is totally in the right but a bit immature train.</p>

I’m saying is its an awkward diss to bring out too. They don’t seem like they’re that cool with each other based on how badly that went so why tell someone who’s just your co-worker “you probably shouldn’t get paid for this”?</p>

<p>Vince was in his prime and the org promised to get him help.  He was told they&rsquo;d bring in steve nash and others after they let tmac go.  Instead they brought in a bunch of replacement level players and Sam Mitchell started reducing his minutes and said he wanted to rebuild the offense around a rookie and even benched vince during some games in the 4th.   If you look at carter&rsquo;s usage and minutes he was very clearly no longer being the center of that team anymore which had an impact on his numbers. And they wanted to rebuild in his prime when they promised to contend after he signed w the raptors.  Even then Babcock later admitted Vince begged him to not trade him and he wanted to stay in Toronto.</p>

<p>Raptors fans conveinetly pretend that it was all VCs fault and he stopped trying etc but nobody mengions that the organization fucked him over hard&hellip;. they took away his mom&rsquo;s parking spot for fuck sakes&hellip;   in all those vince carter reitrement jersey threads nobody mentions this shit because they are just blinded by hate.  90% of these raptors &ldquo;fans&rdquo; probably werent even old enough to remember this shit.</p>

<p>Did Carter purposely play less hard?  Yes probably, but not to the extent that people exaggerate and say and the org did him dirty too, so while he didnt handle it like a pro should have, fans should have forgiven him a long time ago.  Instead they say stupid shit like he gave away team plays when so many players have said that shit never happened that played on the raptors AND the Sonics.  The media made so much negative bullshit up about Vince Carter&rsquo;s exit from TO because the raptors were owned by rogers which is a giant media company and these raptors fans ate it all up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even then Babcock later admitted Vince begged him to not trade him</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d like to see a source on this because it’s my understanding that Carter said he’d like to stay only after the trade was already ageeed to. Which gave him plausible deniability that this was all management’s doing. <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/sam-mitchell-vince-carter-toronto-raptors/" target="_blank">source</a></p>

<p>I forgave Vince for bitching his way out of town a long time ago, but if you have a shitty boss you don’t tank your job to get your way. You still have to act like a professional, not a pouty child. And forgiving someone doesn’t mean you have to celebrate them. That’s not hate, it’s common sense.</p>

      <label for="lrkoj75" class="commentText"><p>I dont worship VC at all.  Kobe and MJ were my players not Vince.  Im not rewriting history at all just providing some semblance of balance to the vince debacle.  He deserved some hate for sure.  But i blame the organization way more than VC.  He was playing a full quarter less, getting way less touches and shots (7 less) and asked to be a part of a rebuild in the prime of his career.  He was never given any real help and the org failed miserably at brigning in anyone vis trade or FA. And hired a coach that all the players fucking detested.  Every star in the league would want a trade in that scenario.  Doesnt give him the right to not play hard every minute, but it&rsquo;s also way exaggerated how much he didn&rsquo;t try.  Theres a crater difference in not wanting to dunk all the time because of jumpers knee and being frustrated with lack of help and minutes and the disrespect to your own mother and making up bullshit like telling the opposing team your inbounds play by the media and proposely trying to tank games.</p>

<p>All im saying is fans need to forgive vince for being an immature superstar and understand his situation and also consider the fact that he had a massive impact on bball not just in TO but all of Canada.  Your last paragraph i completely 100% support.  Forgive vince for his bullshit ackonwledge he should have played harder.  But also his bad play was very exaggerated by media and fans on reddit here.  10 minutes less of playtime isnt nothing for a player used to being the full focal point of the offense and Franchise.</p>

He full on quit on the raptors to the point that they HAD to trade him for 30 cents on the dollar. Instead of asking for a trade privately like a professional, he demanded one and actively tanked his value and current teams success to get it done.</p>

<p>The narrative that Vince got screwed in Toronto is wild.</p>

      <label for="lrkhzri" class="commentText"><p>He averaged 15 ppg before the trade and 27 ppg after the trade in the same season. Said we would never dunk again. He made us sign his boys to big contracts, than dipped. If he never existed, we wouldve just kept Tracey McGradey who left for a bigger role in Orlando.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, Carter did nothing for us except win a dunk contest. He played for us for like <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> seasons, it’s absolutely embarrassing we’re retiring his number.</p>

<p>Also, it was completely media generated to get the fans to stop booing him. It took Ujiri, players and sportsnet/tsn to come out at the same time , around 2014 (?) when Carter was on Memphis, in a coordinated push, begging the fans to stop booing.</p>

      <label for="lrkj35f" class="commentText"><p>Nephew &ldquo;i read bbref&rdquo; take.  Look at his minutes and usage in that season vs year before and with nets. Maybe his numbers were better  cuz he played 9 more minutes a game and took 7 more shots and played with a HOF pg. And he was the focal point of the offense vs bosh.  He put TO on the map and changed the culture of basketball for an entire country.  He played worse yes, but not all pf the blame was on him.  Any superstar in their prime would want a trade if the team decided to rebuild when they promised to contend.</p>

<p>He did nothing for us except win a dunk contest is the dumbest take ever.  I still see raptors carter jerseys to this day.</p>

<p>His numbers were down because he refused to play as much when he was pushing to be traded. Thats why he kept sitting out, playing less, saying he wouldnt dunk etc. its not like the coach juat randomly decided to play our star less lmao.</p>

<p>People wear his jersey now due to the generated media push. Mostly kids , like you, who only watch highlights and weren’t a fan at the time.</p>

<p>Its such revisionist history to pretend he did anything for basketball in canada lmao. If he never played for us, McGradey wouldve been our superstar. Additionally basketball was never big here on a national level until we were contending for the championship with DeRozan. Most kids in Toronto during the VC years were bigger Kobe/ Laker fans lol.</p>

GM and ex players all have said that they were told they wanted to rebuild around Bosh at the beginning of the season.  It&rsquo;s literally in the articles i posted.  Obviously, you&rsquo;re a complete newphew.  Vince was highest in jersey sales and all star votes every year in his prime.</p>

<p>Instead of nash or shaq or jamal mgloire, the raptors got rafael arujo rafer alston and refused to trade the bosh pick for help.  Literally, every superstar in the nba today would want a trade in their prime if they&rsquo;re team was rebuilding.  Yeah he should have still played hard but playing a full quarter less minutes, seeing your cousin leave the team, and being told they want to rebuild in the middle of your prime would piss off any superstar today.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not at all absolving all blame of Vince.  But it&rsquo;s so stupid he gets 100% of the vitriol while we ignore how trash the org was to him.</p>

The Raptors were not popular here at the time, I dont know what to tell you. We never got popular until like 2014. What was your personal experience at the time being in Toronto and being a Raptors fan? Unless, of course, you wernt a fan at the time.</p>

<p>Highest in jersey sales &amp; all star votes means he was popular internationally, not in Toronto you silly goose.</p>

<p>If we were going to rebuild around Bosh, and told him that, why did he force his way off the team? We would’ve traded him to rebuild.</p>

<p>He made us sign his boys to big contracts, than got mad when we didnt have a ton of flexibility. He forced us to dig our own grave, than got mad when we were in a hole. And his cousin left because Vince was on the team lmao</p>
