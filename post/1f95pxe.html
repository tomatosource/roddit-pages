      <p>I can&rsquo;t be the only one thinking this way.</p>

<p>I wish we got to see more of Sheed in his time with Boston. Sure he was on his last legs but he could still ball in spurts.</p>

<p>Shout out to the best player on the 59-23 Blazers that nearly beat the Lakers.</p>

      <label for="llj9v4a" class="commentText"><p>Honestly Rasheed Wallace was on his last legs in general. The fact he balled out in game 7 was a miracle in itself. He left it all out there. Perk tearing his ACL was just bad luck.</p>

<p>And even with all that the Celtics were up by 13 in game 7 before they got out rebounded like crazy . I think Kobe had like 15 rebounds or something. And that Pau Gasol offensive rebound to the tip in that put them up by 5 was a up and down travel that didn’t get called.</p>

<p>It was a hard fought 7 game series that could’ve went either way. I think with Perkins healthy we don’t lose the 13 point lead . Celtics were up 3-2 and our guys were on their last legs (Pierce was 33, Allen was 35, KG was 34 and coming off knee surgery the year before) . It’s honestly crazy we even made that playoff run + 2012 considering age and circumstances . 2012 I’ll chalk up to the lockout giving us more rest + already established chemistry plus Bosh missing a few games in the conference finals</p>

      <label for="lljctyl" class="commentText"><p>Boston being on their last legs as in them being titles contenders? I’d understand. But they were still great the following year in 2011. Obviously they were declining from their peak in ‘09 pre-KG injury, and they may have taken more than a game off Miami if Rondo isn’t hurt.</p>

<p>They were basically in their last legs as a quality squad in 2012, where they were good but their days as contenders was clearly over. They looked meh the first half of that lockout season but they looked pretty good in the second half from what I remember. Their decline was clearly seen by more than their age too as their team offense was sliding each year since 2010 but this team was a defense oriented squad and they were consistently elite on that end 2008-2012.</p>

<p>That KG injury is the big part here. Likely cut short how much success that team would have achieved.</p>
