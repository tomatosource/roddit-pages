She thought she was going to have a warrant for failure to appear.</p>

She didn’t have a lawyer, and she never really responded to any of summons or subpoenas. But as for my side of it, I just had to list everything we owned that was worth more than a certain amount and then choose what I wanted to get…but I didn’t really want anything. I just wanted out. I let her have everything but my car. From my perspective I just requested it through my lawyer and that got approved in the 5 minutes my lawyer spent in front of the judge.</p>

That means a notice goes in the classifieds of the local newspaper, usually. In my jurisdiction it was super easy. The judge just gave me a form to bring to the circuit clerk, then clerk took it and posted the notice for me. Then I had another court date after the time had elapsed, for the judge to establish jurisdiction over the other person.</p>

<p>It is 100x easier to divorce without the other person present. I e-file everything and do Zoom court, it&rsquo;s literally the easiest court related thing I&rsquo;ve ever done. You don&rsquo;t need to find them and make them sign off on anything. If you are divorcing and can&rsquo;t find the other person, there is a process for that and the judge will address it appropriately in your state. Don&rsquo;t delay getting a divorce because you listened to know-nothings on the internet.</p>

<p>I’m happily married, but neither of us promised to obey or any of that shit, we just promised to love. Not everyone sees marriage the same way, and many still see it the old way.</p>

<p>I remember being called as a prospective juror on a spousal rape case and saw 10 different prospective jurors be excused because they said they didn’t think it was possible for a husband to rape his wife. This was in ultra wealthy, ultra liberal fucking Marin County California, just 20 years ago or so.</p>

<p>A lot of people in this world are objectively horrible. This is why people looking to get rid of child marriage protections are so much more terrifying than we are willing to engage with seriously.</p>

      <label for="l6jefoa" class="commentText"><p>Not just rapists either, most people in powerful positions are either abusive, or too inconsiderate to properly wield their power and responsibility.</p>

<p>Politicians, cops, prison guards, managers, CEOs, judges, when people wield power, and other peoples flaws become an inconvenience to them, things rarely go well, and basically never perfect.</p>

<p>The same applies to therapists/psychiatrists, teachers and parents too, often those among the most severe too, many of &ldquo;rights&rdquo; adults have and children do not were <em>not</em> made just because the children wouldnt be able to handle them, we simply didnt consider it necessary.</p>

<p>Most of our school system is completely fucked up, the children are suffering from it, which causes them to misbehave, which causes the teachers to blame them and literally anything they see that causes the children joy, dont make the mistake of taking teachers words as gold when they blame the bad behavior of modern students on various things, many of them would quite like it if we reached a similar situation to Japan/China, where kids are so obedient (because they are punished severely), they&rsquo;ll kill themselves or become disabled shut-ins en masse, or end up with basically 0 consideration for anybody else, because nobody ever showed any to them.</p>

<p>Humans are very much unsuitable to wield power over other humans, unfortunately, there arent any better alternatives.</p>

<p>We eagerly engage in debate about so many social things, but we keep REALLY quiet about the worst truths in this world. We will gladly rail against priests and Boy Scout leaders and teachers for abuse, as we should, but we like to pretend that the <em>vast</em> majority of child sex abuse isn’t a thing worth talking about.</p>

      <label for="l6iupl8" class="commentText"><p>On it&rsquo;s face yes. But if you think of marriages as contracts, which really they are. It doesn&rsquo;t seem so odd. If you wanted to dissolve some contract you had with someone else you&rsquo;d also need to get their consent.</p>

<p>This is especially true if you want to leave the contract without the other person having failed to meet their obligations. And that&rsquo;s pretty analogous to no fault divorces. And I don&rsquo;t think you had to have your partners consent to get divorced for cause.</p>

<p>And it might seem cold to view marriages through contract law, but that&rsquo;s just kind of how they functioned (and arguably is the only reason for marriages to be a legal construct rather than just a social one).</p>

<p>But if you think that&rsquo;s unfair, look at blatantly sexist versions like in the Philippines where men can divorce women but women can&rsquo;t divorce men.</p>

<p>There are. For instance (at least in Germany) you are responsible for the subsistance, housing of each other. Additionally in most nations you have tax benefits that either/both can use - they are part of the contract between the married. Just because you aren&rsquo;t aware of the obligations or privileges doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p>Of course aged obligations that were historic part, for instance fertility by <em>either side!</em> aren&rsquo;t part of this contract anymore.</p>

But when you involve the state, you sign what id basically a contract with the state and your partner. This often creates a common financial entity and entitles you to certain rights and responsibilities.</p>

<p>Same goes for non spiritual legal marriages. Did you know Catholics literally can&rsquo;t divorce in a spiritual sense? It&rsquo;s not that it is a sin, it&rsquo;s that there is no canon recourse to END a marriage other than death of a party. (There&rsquo;s anullment, but that&rsquo;s a strict process to prove that there really was never a marriage to begin with because one of the parties made their vows dishonestly at the moment of the marriage). All those Catholics you see remarry are JUST legal contracts with the state. Same goes for gay couples who do civil unions in places where &ldquo;gay marriage&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

      <label for="l6imuxw" class="commentText"><p>I’m familiar with the era where the church had to grant permission, but not familiar with the women holding the power over whether their husbands could seek divorce (or any examples where the woman’s “permission” was the deciding factor in stopping a man from doing what he wanted legally). I’m curious now though—mind posting a source?</p>

<p>The most famous part of English Common Law pertaining to this issue was “coverture,” which basically erased a woman’s official legal identity and ability to own property, make contracts in her name, etc after marriage</p>

      <label for="l6izxmx" class="commentText"><p>This is factually inaccurate. The rules concerning divorce were never static, but in common law jurisdictions broadly speaking it didn’t exist until the early modern era. When it did exist it was only available to men, and at least in England the only allowed cause was adultery on the woman&rsquo;s part* - but it was so phenomenally expensive, time-consuming, and publicly humiliating to all parties that only the wealthiest of the wealthy divorced. Again in England, an average of three divorces were granted every year between the mid-18th century and mid-19th century.</p>

<p>The woman was never asked to give permission. Ever.</p>

<p>* I have to qualify this, as there seem to have been two or three divorces over that 120-year period granted to women whose husbands committed adultery with their wife&rsquo;s sister. The prevailing mindset was that, in a world where a woman couldn&rsquo;t legally say no to sex with her husband, forcing her to remain married to a man who had sex with her sister was tantamount to forcing her to commit incest - and that was considered shockingly wrong.</p>

<p>To make some things clear:</p>

<p>Friedrich Merz is the most likely candidate for next chancellor, not just any politician and</p>

<p>he voted against a law making spousal rape a felony (in 1995).</p>

<p>Merz is top candidate of the CDU and for reasons too convoluted to summarize, the CDU stands good chances for the next elections compared to other parties. As far as I know, at least. Any other German is free to correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong!</p>

<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s occurred to these guys that they could possibly make even the smallest bit of effort towards being a person that a woman would freely choose to be around, or did they not even consider that and just went straight to Jordan Peterson&rsquo;s &ldquo;enforced monogamy&rdquo; and working to change the law to force unwilling women to stay with them?</p>

<p>Or perhaps forcing unwilling women to be with them is their ideal outcome, rather than what they consider to be the only way men like them can have female companionship.</p>

      <label for="l6iqvdz" class="commentText"><p>They wanted to get rid of no fault divorce, which would actually be a bad thing for most shitty men. Most divorces have some underlying cause, even if they end up being legally no fault. Get rid of that and divorce will still happen, but men who are getting divorced because their partner found out about their drug use/infidelity/gambling issue or who demeaned/beat/raped/abused their spouse will now have all that shit become a matter of public record.</p>

<p>As it is guys can say “she left me for no reason!” all they want. Get rid of no fault and then they’ll have the truth all out in the open- especially in a world where it’s so easy to collect video and audio evidence.</p>

<p>Edit: just want to say I 100% support keeping no fault divorce around (I’ve even had one myself!) I’m simply providing an argument that speaks specifically to the interests shitty men I’ve heard complain about no fault divorce. There are myriad other reasons it’s a good thing to have around.</p>

What if he&rsquo;s just psychologically abusive, but a judge doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s enough? You are basically saying that a judge has to decide for a woman (or a man!) whether she should be allowed to leave, which is inhumane.</p>

<p>The argument that the man&rsquo;s bad behavior would be public record is pretty weak in comparison to the fact people would be trapped in relationships they want to leave.</p>

<p>My wife who is Mexican told me she generally stayed away from Mexican men because of &ldquo;machismo&rdquo; culture. I had to tell her that her odds weren&rsquo;t much better with Vietnamese men unfortunately lol.</p>

<p>Again, I know this is just my experience. I also know a lot of good Vietnamese guys out there, especially the younger generation.</p>

<p>Because I was talking with someone a while ago who was against divorce and told him this statistic.</p>

<p>He acknowledged more women would die if divorce were limited or abolished, but still was anti divorce because &ldquo;it was better for families.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Better for a few women to die so that men can keep their possessions &ndash; women.</p>

<p>I know I&rsquo;m preaching to the choir here but&hellip; never underestimate the amount of people out there that truly do not see women as human beings worthy of life. Being anti abortion, anti divorce, other anti woman positions &ndash; this is all a declaration of a desire to kill women, and no one who gives two craps about women should associate with these types.</p>

<p>So if your spouse won’t sign a no fault you move out, change your address, wait a year, then file. At that point even if they dodge the summons/serving you can still finalize.</p>

Conviction of a felony;
Pregnancy of the wife by another before the marriage without the husband’s knowledge;
Refusal to move to Tennessee with your spouse and living apart for two years;

Lack of reconciliation for two years after the entry of a decree of separate maintenance;

<p>There are ways to do it with minor children, a friend of mine did, but I do not have kids so it was not something I delved deeply on and hesitate to talk authoritatively on. (Pretty sure it’s the decree of separate maintenance path—court just wants to make sure the kids are treated fairly in the interim.)</p>

For example, there was a large decline in the number of women committing suicide following the introduction of unilateral divorce, but no similar decline for men. States that passed unilateral divorce laws saw total female suicide decline by around 20 percent in the long run. The authors also find a large decline in domestic violence for both men and women following adoption of unilateral divorce. Finally, the evidence suggests that unilateral divorce led to a decline in females murdered by their partners, while the data reveal no discernible effects for homicide against men.</p>

<p>But I did look it up before responding and Carson too has been critical of no-fault divorces, claiming that it&rsquo;s ending marriages that could have survived. Which yeah okay that may be true often enough, but on the other hand, abuse is abuse, and all too often the divorce process itself is used as a weapon to continue that abuse.</p>

<p>Based on the information available on Statista, female suicide was trending upward between 1990-2018. Female suicide peaked in 1970, about a year after the reform. Female suicide rates in the recent past are similar to suicide rates in 1960. Female suicide rates in 1950 and 1960 were also similar to 1980. In 2018, female suicide rates approached the previous peak in 1970 before declining again.</p>

<p>It’s not shown clearly in the data available, but there seems to have been a sharp rise in female suicides over the course of the 1960s that eventually unwound by 1980. The question we should be asking is why did women start committing suicide at such high rates in the 1960s? It probably wasn’t a sudden drop in the quality of marriages.</p>

      <label for="l6j2j0d" class="commentText"><p>Yep, and this is another feature of why the right wants to get rid of it.</p>

<p>If the “tradwife” decides to want to have her own opinions and self and she’s too scared to leave or do anything about it, and she ends herself, he gets to go after another wife to attempt to make into a subservient being AND, very likely, her life insurance.</p>

It&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;d be perfectly happy to live in a time when you had to ask Daddy or your husband to co-sign if you wanted a credit card, a bank loan, a home purchase (mortgage), anything.&rdquo; As was the case, legally, through the 1960s in most of the country.</p>
