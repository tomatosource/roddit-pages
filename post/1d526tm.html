Allegedly she didn’t know about it, but that’s because she dodged the court summon from being served. Apparently police were supposed to get it to her but they could never find her. She thought she was going to have a warrant for failure to appear.</p>

She didn’t have a lawyer, and she never really responded to any of summons or subpoenas. But as for my side of it, I just had to list everything we owned that was worth more than a certain amount and then choose what I wanted to get…but I didn’t really want anything. I just wanted out. I let her have everything but my car. From my perspective I just requested it through my lawyer and that got approved in the 5 minutes my lawyer spent in front of the judge.</p>

      <label for="l6jdtfx" class="commentText"><p>I had a similar situation. My ex responded, but only after I went through the publication route and a few other last ditch efforts (email her, sent both certified and regular first class letters to her last known address.) She finally responded to the court in writing, and requested to show up by phone, but she didn&rsquo;t call in.</p>

<p>She had listed a number of items, and the judge asked me if it was anything I wanted. I told him no and that I&rsquo;d be happy to mail them to her. He wrote the divorce decree out as &ldquo;anything Mr. Goldwater has returned by X date is hers, everything else is his.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I ended up packing up everything except her jewelry box and mailing it to her with a note saying, &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re not at a stable address right now, I have your jewelry still, let me know where to send it to.&rdquo; I never heard from her, and a few years later I ended up giving it to her Brother, although legally I didn&rsquo;t have to.</p>

That means a notice goes in the classifieds of the local newspaper, usually. In my jurisdiction it was super easy. The judge just gave me a form to bring to the circuit clerk, then clerk took it and posted the notice for me. Then I had another court date after the time had elapsed, for the judge to establish jurisdiction over the other person.</p>

      <label for="l6k2c9k" class="commentText"><p>My abusive ex refused to sign the papers for months, purely as a last power trip. It was the one and only last thing he could take away from me and hold over me. He essentially used it to try and punish me for leaving him.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s not like he was hoping we&rsquo;d get back together or anything. I&rsquo;d left him over a year prior, he&rsquo;d been shacked up with his next victim for almost as long already, he just <em>really</em> effing didn&rsquo;t want to give me what I wanted or let me be happy.</p>

<p>There are a lot of petty, vindictive people out there that will use whatever they can to hurt someone who has &lsquo;wronged&rsquo; them (like me leaving him when I made a post like OP&rsquo;s and Reddit told me I had been abused for nine years and to run.)</p>

<p>In the end, the only reason he signed is so he could trap the next one. He proposed to her a week after finally sending the effing papers back. Guys like this leave a lot of destruction in their wake.</p>

<p>It is 100x easier to divorce without the other person present. I e-file everything and do Zoom court, it&rsquo;s literally the easiest court related thing I&rsquo;ve ever done. You don&rsquo;t need to find them and make them sign off on anything. If you are divorcing and can&rsquo;t find the other person, there is a process for that and the judge will address it appropriately in your state. Don&rsquo;t delay getting a divorce because you listened to know-nothings on the internet.</p>

      <label for="l6ixyk3" class="commentText"><p>Marriage is historically a property arrangement that we dress up with a lot of overpriced flowers and dry cleaning bills.</p>

<p>I’m happily married, but neither of us promised to obey or any of that shit, we just promised to love. Not everyone sees marriage the same way, and many still see it the old way.</p>

<p>I remember being called as a prospective juror on a spousal rape case and saw 10 different prospective jurors be excused because they said they didn’t think it was possible for a husband to rape his wife. This was in ultra wealthy, ultra liberal fucking Marin County California, just 20 years ago or so.</p>

<p>A lot of people in this world are objectively horrible. This is why people looking to get rid of child marriage protections are so much more terrifying than we are willing to engage with seriously.</p>

      <label for="l6iupl8" class="commentText"><p>On it&rsquo;s face yes. But if you think of marriages as contracts, which really they are. It doesn&rsquo;t seem so odd. If you wanted to dissolve some contract you had with someone else you&rsquo;d also need to get their consent.</p>

<p>This is especially true if you want to leave the contract without the other person having failed to meet their obligations. And that&rsquo;s pretty analogous to no fault divorces. And I don&rsquo;t think you had to have your partners consent to get divorced for cause.</p>

<p>And it might seem cold to view marriages through contract law, but that&rsquo;s just kind of how they functioned (and arguably is the only reason for marriages to be a legal construct rather than just a social one).</p>

<p>But if you think that&rsquo;s unfair, look at blatantly sexist versions like in the Philippines where men can divorce women but women can&rsquo;t divorce men.</p>

<p>There are. For instance (at least in Germany) you are responsible for the subsistance, housing of each other. Additionally in most nations you have tax benefits that either/both can use - they are part of the contract between the married. Just because you aren&rsquo;t aware of the obligations or privileges doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p>Of course aged obligations that were historic part, for instance fertility by <em>either side!</em> aren&rsquo;t part of this contract anymore.</p>

But when you involve the state, you sign what id basically a contract with the state and your partner. This often creates a common financial entity and entitles you to certain rights and responsibilities.</p>

<p>Same goes for non spiritual legal marriages. Did you know Catholics literally can&rsquo;t divorce in a spiritual sense? It&rsquo;s not that it is a sin, it&rsquo;s that there is no canon recourse to END a marriage other than death of a party. (There&rsquo;s anullment, but that&rsquo;s a strict process to prove that there really was never a marriage to begin with because one of the parties made their vows dishonestly at the moment of the marriage). All those Catholics you see remarry are JUST legal contracts with the state. Same goes for gay couples who do civil unions in places where &ldquo;gay marriage&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p>This has led to an entire secretive industry of dudes who basically abduct obstinate husbands and beat them up until they say yes. The man can also be shunned by the community for refusing to give one&hellip; but he still has to give it.</p>

Before then, only their husband (or father, but that was rare) could open a joint account with them. Divorce skyrocketed after that; before women had no way to support themselves, even if they were relatively wealthy.</p>

      <label for="l6izxmx" class="commentText"><p>This is factually inaccurate. The rules concerning divorce were never static, but in common law jurisdictions broadly speaking it didn’t exist until the early modern era. When it did exist it was only available to men, and at least in England the only allowed cause was adultery on the woman&rsquo;s part* - but it was so phenomenally expensive, time-consuming, and publicly humiliating to all parties that only the wealthiest of the wealthy divorced. Again in England, an average of three divorces were granted every year between the mid-18th century and mid-19th century.</p>

<p>The woman was never asked to give permission. Ever.</p>

<p>* I have to qualify this, as there seem to have been two or three divorces over that 120-year period granted to women whose husbands committed adultery with their wife&rsquo;s sister. The prevailing mindset was that, in a world where a woman couldn&rsquo;t legally say no to sex with her husband, forcing her to remain married to a man who had sex with her sister was tantamount to forcing her to commit incest - and that was considered shockingly wrong.</p>

I’m curious now though—mind posting a source?</p>

<p>The most famous part of English Common Law pertaining to this issue was “coverture,” which basically erased a woman’s official legal identity and ability to own property, make contracts in her name, etc after marriage</p>

<p>And she was no liberal feminist&hellip; she was fairly conservative and religious. But she still said explicitly &ldquo;Your generation has a much better approach to marriage. Our way was awful for women.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l6jf404" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m making huge generalities as a second generation Vietnamese American, but what I noticed with all my aunties who were mostly raised in the US is that all of them worked hard to get their own education and careers and when it came to partners they stayed away from Vietnamese men that were &ldquo;too traditional&rdquo;. I think seeing the way my grandpa and uncles treat them and my grandma taught them to be careful if they wanted to keep their independence. On my other side, half of my aunts/aunt-in-laws married young but left their husbands has soon as the kids were out of the house.</p>

<p>My wife who is Mexican told me she generally stayed away from Mexican men because of &ldquo;machismo&rdquo; culture. I had to tell her that her odds weren&rsquo;t much better with Vietnamese men unfortunately lol.</p>

<p>Again, I know this is just my experience. I also know a lot of good Vietnamese guys out there, especially the younger generation.</p>

<p>Because I was talking with someone a while ago who was against divorce and told him this statistic.</p>

<p>He acknowledged more women would die if divorce were limited or abolished, but still was anti divorce because &ldquo;it was better for families.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Better for a few women to die so that men can keep their possessions &ndash; women.</p>

<p>I know I&rsquo;m preaching to the choir here but&hellip; never underestimate the amount of people out there that truly do not see women as human beings worthy of life. Being anti abortion, anti divorce, other anti woman positions &ndash; this is all a declaration of a desire to kill women, and no one who gives two craps about women should associate with these types.</p>

<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s occurred to these guys that they could possibly make even the smallest bit of effort towards being a person that a woman would freely choose to be around, or did they not even consider that and just went straight to Jordan Peterson&rsquo;s &ldquo;enforced monogamy&rdquo; and working to change the law to force unwilling women to stay with them?</p>

<p>Or perhaps forcing unwilling women to be with them is their ideal outcome, rather than what they consider to be the only way men like them can have female companionship.</p>

      <label for="l6iqvdz" class="commentText"><p>They wanted to get rid of no fault divorce, which would actually be a bad thing for most shitty men. Most divorces have some underlying cause, even if they end up being legally no fault. Get rid of that and divorce will still happen, but men who are getting divorced because their partner found out about their drug use/infidelity/gambling issue or who demeaned/beat/raped/abused their spouse will now have all that shit become a matter of public record.</p>

<p>As it is guys can say “she left me for no reason!” all they want. Get rid of no fault and then they’ll have the truth all out in the open- especially in a world where it’s so easy to collect video and audio evidence.</p>

<p>Edit: just want to say I 100% support keeping no fault divorce around (I’ve even had one myself!) I’m simply providing an argument that speaks specifically to the interests shitty men I’ve heard complain about no fault divorce. There are myriad other reasons it’s a good thing to have around.</p>

What if he&rsquo;s just psychologically abusive, but a judge doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s enough? You are basically saying that a judge has to decide for a woman (or a man!) whether she should be allowed to leave, which is inhumane.</p>

<p>The argument that the man&rsquo;s bad behavior would be public record is pretty weak in comparison to the fact people would be trapped in relationships they want to leave.</p>

<p>“Between 2000 and 2018, some 300,000 minors were legally married in the United States. The vast majority of child marriages (reliable sources vary between 78% and 95%) were between a minor girl and an adult man. In many cases, minors in the U.S. may be married when they are under the age of sexual consent, which varies from 16 to 18 depending on the state. In some states, minors cannot legally divorce or leave their spouse, and domestic violence shelters typically do not accept minors.”</p>

<p>There are ways to do it with minor children, a friend of mine did, but I do not have kids so it was not something I delved deeply on and hesitate to talk authoritatively on. (Pretty sure it’s the decree of separate maintenance path—court just wants to make sure the kids are treated fairly in the interim.)</p>

<p>check the divorce laws in your state before you get married, people.</p>

<p>this is true but the manosphere loves to claim that women get away with abuse and murder at astronomical rates in order to handwave away statistics about domestic violence with no proof whatsoever.</p>

Granted it&rsquo;s not something I really looked into, but I started questioning whether it was ever common IRL, or just a horror/mystery trope. This seems to point to that just being a trope, then.</p>

      <label for="l6j9b7s" class="commentText"><p>The authors find very real effects on the well being of families. For example, there was a large decline in the number of women committing suicide following the introduction of unilateral divorce, but no similar decline for men. States that passed unilateral divorce laws saw total female suicide decline by around 20 percent in the long run. The authors also find a large decline in domestic violence for both men and women following adoption of unilateral divorce. Finally, the evidence suggests that unilateral divorce led to a decline in females murdered by their partners, while the data reveal no discernible effects for homicide against men.</p>
