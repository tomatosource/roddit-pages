      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dm4qu0/oc_does_having_the_best_player_in_a_playoff/"><p>[OC] Does having the &ldquo;best player&rdquo; in a playoff series actually matter? Here are the results for the last 5 postseasons. (Results and TLDR at top)</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>When discussing upcoming playoff series, it&rsquo;s common for people to go &ldquo;Oh but team A has the best player!&rdquo; when trying to predict who will win. But does this actually matter?</p>

<p><strong>TL:DR: When the teams are actually equal or the team without the best player is stronger overall, it&rsquo;s pretty much <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub>. The best player</strong> <strong><em>does</em></strong> <strong>win more series overall, but that&rsquo;s usually because they&rsquo;re on the better team to begin with. When the team with the best player is much weaker than the other team, it does not matter.</strong></p>

<p>Overall results:</p>

<ul>
<li>The best player won <sup>53</sup>&frasl;<sub>75</sub> series (70.6%)</li>
<li>When the best player was on the weaker team they won <sup>13</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub> series (52%). This number includes series where the teams were close to begin with however. It should also be noted that the 2023 Heat are an outlier here, and the 2024 Mavericks played at an elite level after roster changes at the deadline.

<ul>
<li>Outside of the last two years, best players on worse teams are <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub> (42.8%)</li>
<li>In the last two years they&rsquo;ve won <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> (63.6%)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When the best player was on the stronger team they won <sup>40</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> (80%)</li>
</ul>

<p>The biggest issue with this exercise is figuring out a way to judge who the best player is. MVP voting is great, but for example, in this past year only 9 players got MVP votes. All-NBA voting <em>now</em> would be amazing for this because it&rsquo;s position-less, but in past years it wasn&rsquo;t. Even then, what if a player (<em>coughembiidcough)</em> missed the games cut-off for award voting due to injury?  Rankings lists? Well any smart person realizes that those are partially designed to create outrage. Advanced stats can be fun, but there still isn&rsquo;t a one number metric that matches the eye test with 100% accuracy.</p>

<p>In the end, I opted to take it on a series by series basis (so, my opinion). I tried to put my biases aside the best that I can, and I think it ended up pretty accurate but that&rsquo;s obviously up for debate. There are certain series where you&rsquo;re really just splitting hairs though. If there was a close result, I&rsquo;ll throw my reasoning in the column as well.</p>

<p>If a player was injured and missed most of/all of the series they don&rsquo;t count (e.g Giannis the last two seasons). Same if they were seriously limited by injury in the games they did play.</p>

<p>I also decided to include which team had the higher Simple Rating System score in that season. This is because I wanted to see if the best player narrative could truly overcome a talent gap in other places.</p>

      <label for="l9tacr0" class="commentText"><p>I can already see the problem with your  methodology. You’re judging who the best player is at least in part due to what happened in the series. For instance, going into the Heat/Bucks series last year , no one would have Jimmy Butler as the best player. It was only him having big performances in that series while Giannis got hurt that gave that impression. Until you have objective criteria based on what happened previously, you’re not asking “how often does the better player win the series?” You’re asking “how often will the best player who wins the series be considered the best after winning”?</p>

Even if people might have said KD was the best player, Giannis had been objectively better for a while.</p>

      <label for="l9udhyj" class="commentText"><p>I guess its not a huge deal to not have the best player in a series if one of the players ascends to that level during. Like for example, one could easily argue Anthony Edwards was not the best player going into the Suns series but he completely outplayed both KD and Booker. In the Nuggets series, one could also argue that Ant was able to match Jokic for large parts of the series thus &ldquo;negating&rdquo; the best player advantage anyways.</p>

      <label for="l9tr5l8" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a problem with that. When people talk about how important it is to have the best player in the series, they always open way to the conversation when you have a guy who <em>could</em> be the best player in a series. Like a Luka vs Shai matchup, it matters that Shai can outplay Luka in people&rsquo;s minds even if Luka&rsquo;s generally considered better.</p>

<p>Jimmy Butler <em>can</em> be the best player in a series vs Milwaukee, and probably wouldve been regardless of Giannis&rsquo; health because Jimmy was amazing that series. That&rsquo;s his value as a playoff performer. Injuries is a different thing.</p>

      <label for="l9twqcl" class="commentText"><p>Well Shai clearly outplayed Luka by any measure in the actual series. He had an average Game Score of 27.6 and averaged 32 PPG on .599 TS% while Luka had an average Game Score of 20.5 and averaged 25 PPG on .566 TS%. Shai played very good defense while Luka was getting blown by more than any player in the last 10 years except for himself.</p>

<p>SGA was the better player in the regular season, the better player in the first round, and VERY clearly the best player in the Dallas series, but the Mavericks win so Luka gets the credit for being the “best player” and its chalked up as “better player wins the series”. If both players play the same, but Jaylen Williams shoots 3% better and PJ Washington shoots 3% worse, no one’s questioning that SGA was the better player.</p>

In 2022, Tatum finished much higher than Steph in MVP and all-NBA voting and generally had a more impressive first 3 rounds, but Steph gets “best player” for having a better Finals.</p>

      <label for="l9tggah" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, SGA led the league in EPM, generally dominated Luka in impact stats, and led in 2 of the 3 major box score composites. He had 15 1st place votes and 55 top 2 votes for MVP compared to 4 and 40 for Luka. He’s also a much better defender and greatly outplayed Luka head-to-head in the actual series. The only reason to have Luka as the better player is that his team won the series. Which just goes to show how flawed the methodology is here.</p>

They set out to answer a question. &ldquo;Does having the best play in a playoff series actually matter?&rdquo; This is a yes-or-no question, therefore objective. The subjective enters when you evaluate who the best player in a series is. Deciding what criteria you should value and how valuable they should be. How valuable are MVP votes? What are the player&rsquo;s counting stats? Do those stats match up to your personal eye test? Questions like this are the meat, the conclusion is almost irrelevant. Your comment stating that &ldquo;best player is almost entirely subjective. This post is dumb.&rdquo; is utterly moronic for this reason. In your world, MVP has no value, all-nba teams have no meaning, and goat has no meaning because they are all just subjective. </p>

I would propose some changes though, specifically in 2021 though: I’d honestly say KD was better than Giannis in our series against the nets. Also, if you’re going to count out Giannis in the ECF because he was injured, you should do the same for Trae as he was injured; so the best player is probably Khris Middleton (which is kind of wild)</p>

      <label for="l9tizh2" class="commentText"><p>Super intereseting post. Thanks for posting the data and your reasoning when determining who is the best</p>

<p>Frankly before the Wolves Suns series, I and many of the Wolves beat reporters had 1. KD, 2.Booker and 3.Ant as the 3 best players in the series. Ant just elevated but I don&rsquo;t think he was the best player. I was taking into account experience though.</p>

      <label for="l9u3m76" class="commentText"><p>But for that best player to matter that best player has to be transcendent like Lebron or Steph in their primes. None of the best players today aren’t at that level. So their teams aren’t that dominate or automatically going to the finals.  The most consistent winners outside of Steph and Lebron has long long been Tatum and Brown. But those two don’t get credit. The next winning duo are Butler and Adebayo, but again they don’t get that credit. People like to make out that Jokic and Doncic are unstoppable, but they aren’t. So that’s why they don’t dominate the league the way they get spoken about. SGA is likely overrated too, but no where near Jokic and doncic level overrated.</p>

The thing I wonder about is the way teams are structured massively impacts how you look at players&hellip; like the Mavs are very reliant on Luka and Kyrie pick and roll and isolation. Yes those players are amazing but also they play a style where they absolutely have to be incredible every night for their team to win.</p>

      <label for="l9tj4ab" class="commentText"><p>Absolutely! How the fuck could someone argue otherwise?</p>

<p>Look at this year&rsquo;s playoffs. The four &ldquo;Nos&rdquo; for the best player winning were Joker (lost in seven,) Embiid (the motherfucker was diagnosed with BELL&rsquo;S PALSY!!!!!!!!), Brunson (he was labeled the best player in the series because&hellip;.someone had to be) and Luka.</p>

<p>Three of the four still won at least one series. ONLY because of their existence. The exception was Embiid - who missed months of the season and, oh yeah, was diagnosed with BELL&rsquo;S PALSY!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>And we&rsquo;re talking about the playoffs. Especially once past the first round, each player has really good players. Not often often we see a team with CLEARLY the best player drop a series.</p>

<p>When it does happen, it&rsquo;s situations like we just saw in the Finals. Sure, Luka was the most talented team. If the two teams had a draft, Luka would go #1. Tatum and Brown would go next. Outside of Flat, six of of next seven or so players after Luka would be from the Celtics.</p>

      <label for="l9u2n8c" class="commentText"><p>Who’s the best player is subjective. I think there are two great players who are clearly overrated in their greatness. To me Giannis is the best complete basketball player, Embiid is 2nd, then Jokic, after that it’s a toss up to me. All these players are very very close.</p>

      <label for="l9tjb60" class="commentText"><p>Lebron was the better player before the series and arguable during it. Stats need context. Lebron was basically the only scoring option on the Lakers. The suns could key in on him and dare anyone else to beat them. Booker played next to CP3 who created easy offense for himself and teammates including Booker. Booker looked great because he played against an overmatched Laker squad that couldn&rsquo;t hope to stop the suns entire offense not because he was a better player.</p>

      <label for="l9tovx3" class="commentText"><p>the point about surrounding cast applies to most playoff matchups.  If your production is limited because you were the only priority target of opposing defenses, it does make it hard for you to be the best player of the series.  To be fair, in the following round, Jokic DID manage that and was better than Booker and CP3.</p>
