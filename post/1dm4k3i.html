      <label for="l9tbdsq" class="commentText"><p>This is actually coming from a study done by Tom Haberstroh.  It started with the Jaren Jackson Jr. stat-padding claims, which led to him finding a former stat-keeper admitting to inflating certain numbers.  Then led to this look into other oddities, like MJ&rsquo;s home/away numbers.</p>

<p>Spoiler:  You&rsquo;ll find that Stockton&rsquo;s ratio was comparable to almost any other player in that group and that his lead on 2nd place actually grows if you&rsquo;re an idiot who pretends that players are equally efficient at home as they are on the road.  This shit is so fucking tired.  Steve Nash is the only player in the top 15 who somehow averaged more assists on the road than at home, literally everyone else plays better at home (which any self respecting sports fan knows).</p>

<p>Kidd&rsquo;s home/away advantage (1.0 apg) was 25% bigger than Stockton (0.8) and he barely made it to 75% of the assists even with that advantage.</p>

      <label for="l9u8drw" class="commentText"><p>Since you asked, I looked it up. On a per game basis, of the 10 players with the most assists in NBA history,   Stockton is tied with Magic for the 3rd largest home/road gap in their assists (again on a per game basis).</p>

<p>Jason Kidd is #1, Isiah Thomas is #2.</p>

<p>Since Stockton&rsquo;s peak usage years have a lot of overlap with Magic and Isiah&rsquo;s peak usage years, it doesn&rsquo;t seem crazy to me to conclude that Stockton, Magic and Isiah all benefited from some padding of the stats at home.</p>

<p>For comparison&rsquo;s sake the 3 active players (CP3, Lebron, Westbrook) are all between +0.3 and +0.5 more assists at home than the road.</p>

<p>Nash for some reason averaged more assists on the road than home.</p>

<p>Here is the data:</p>

<p>Stockton  - 10.9 home vs. 10.1 road (+0.8)   <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/stockjo01/splits/" target="_blank">https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/stockjo01/splits/</a></p>

If you really want to get nitty gritty, you can pull all players from the last 5 years or so (likely more accurate data), but at least with this dataset Stockton seems perfectly reasonable.</p>

<p>Let me give a ridiculous example to help you understand. Which player do you think is more likely to have biased scorekeepers?</p>

<p>Player A under perfect scorekeeping: 5 APG<br>
Player A under potentially biased scorekeeping: 10 APG</p>

<p>Player B under perfect scorekeeping: 40 APG<br>
Player B under potentially biased scorekeeping: 46 APG</p>

<p>Jordan had a 19.6% increase in steals and 15.7% increase in blocks at home for his career.</p>

<p>In the 87-88 season Jordan had a <strong>75.5% increase in steals</strong> and <strong>78.7% increase in blocks</strong> when at home<strong>!!!!!!!!!</strong></p>

But it was discussed that the Jazz scorer was generous as to what counted as an assist. Stockton could pass it to Malone and Malone could do quite a bit afterwards and it would still count as an assist. I remember watching games and being occasionally surprised that some plays where assists.</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t read it already, you&rsquo;re absolutely right and it&rsquo;s still a problem right now.</p>

<p>If this Haberstroh article was about Tiny Archibald I&rsquo;m not sure it blows up this way, it just reignites the debate that we all love never shutting up about &ndash; comparing Bron and Jordan.</p>

<p>Actually watch the games and you see players that are abysmal. You just couldn’t find 450 elite players back then. Nowadays, even a 15th person on an NBA team is essentially built and trained for basketball.</p>

<p>There are some borderline plays, like when Laimbeer doesn&rsquo;t follow Grant, but it&rsquo;s kind of mixed up since it&rsquo;s early transition.</p>

<p>Zone was legal, there are just a lot of rules on how you have to make it work.</p>

In a real sense though, I hate the revisionist history people have with the league and how they find today’s game more boring. It’s because they only see the best games from the past, and even the games from the past on rewatch are nowhere near the level of today’s game. It’s still great basketball, but the space and pace game in my opinion is still a better product even though it needs to be further refined.</p>

      <label for="l9ty8u5" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t either, and I grew up watching 80s/90s basketball&hellip; Yes Jordan was talented af, but the reality is the rest of the league WASN&rsquo;T as talented. The game hadn&rsquo;t evolved as far, the talent didn&rsquo;t have the resources modern players have, etc.</p>

<p>This is why I don&rsquo;t like the cross era goat comparisons. Jordan was the greatest player in his era, LeBron was the greatest in his, but their eras aren&rsquo;t the same, the game wasn&rsquo;t the same, the competition wasn&rsquo;t the same. They both would be great in any era imho, but comparing them, or other goats from other eras head to head, is just useless&hellip; you&rsquo;ll never be able to actually get an even comparison.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s just nostalgia that alters their perception. Basketball and the players, as a whole, are much more advanced now than they were back then.</p>

      <label for="l9uie5g" class="commentText"><p>It isn&rsquo;t settled though, because players from past aras would have those same advantages that players from today have that makes competition better.</p>

<p>Jordan likely wouldn&rsquo;t have been smoking cigars, he would have had advanved trainers and doctors available to him, maybe he would have been able to stretch out more championships instead of fewer&hellip;</p>

<p>LeBron in an older age wouldn&rsquo;t have had the same advantages he&rsquo;s used to keep himself healthy for all these years, maybe he would have been smoking with the boys, or not taken care of himself the way he should have and squandered his gifts&hellip; But on the flip side he also would have had illegal defense to benefit from, less advanced opponents, and potentially with the way contracts used to work he could have landed on a dynasty.</p>

<p>There are so many factors and differences that it&rsquo;s impossible to ever balance the scales enough to truly compare even just those two.</p>

<p>People like to bring up all these differences as a way to bolster their personal pick, and discount they other, but in reality all the changes just show how imbalanced the comparison is at its core. In reality they were both generational players in their era and were the undisputed kings of the times they peaked in.</p>

<p>Or they would just not play basketball.</p>

<p>You can compare players directly as they are or indirectly with &ldquo;era-relaivity&rdquo; for convinence. But this &ldquo;lets make things fair by assuming a bunch of things go right&rdquo; is just fan-fiction whatever.</p>

<p>Stars back then and now have free reign as long as they can pass the drug tests. If they are prone to bad habits no one can stop them, ESPECIALLY if they still outperform the league. </p>

<p>LeBron would do the same in his capacity to prolong his career whether it&rsquo;s 1970 or 2020, it&rsquo;s just how he operates. The real question is if he played before MJ, there would be no one to chase, so what would his mindset be instead? What if he was playing in the same era with Kareem, egging each other on? </p>

Can you imagine how much people will clown the defense that some players like LeBron, Harden and Luka play in the last five or so years?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just sad really, i have never seen a fanbase disrespect its legends like Basketball fans do. You don&rsquo;t see people in Baseball disrespecting Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb or Joe DiMaggio like Basketball fans do. In Football it happens sometimes, but even then people understand how much the game is different with the rules and modern technology.</p>

<p>Basketball fans unfortunately are just a bunch of morons watching Michael mfing Jordan play and calling him Jaylen Brown with a shoedeal and saying dumb stuff like &ldquo;We done with the 90s&rdquo;.</p>

      <label for="l9tsl0b" class="commentText"><p>Jordan fan here. People don’t want to talk about it, but the rules and players of his time made an unreal player look superhuman. Zone defenses were illegal and the Bulls would stack one side of the court, giving Jordan the clean iso. Then, the other guards of the day were athletically inferior to MJ. They were shorter than him, far slower than him, and due to his jumping ability he was able to release a jump shot essentially uncontested</p>

      <label for="l9v72wo" class="commentText"><p>I’m really confused at the amount of people acting like this isn’t how highlights look today. A lot of those “uncontested” shots were on plays where guys purposefully play safe to not foul because it’s a fast break. Like 12 of his points were open runs to the basket or plays where the Bulls had a three on one, we really gonna act like guys today are playing hard defense there and not just allowing the layup? Also a lot of his pull-ups are uncontested because Jordan was so good at getting to the rim he was given some space, look how open a guy like Westbrook was when he wanted to take a pull up jumper instead of driving. The defense wasn’t especially impressive but for a random regular season game it seemed mostly fine. Turns out great players find space to shoot and don’t exclusively force tough shots.</p>

When he said that, reddick said that if a player tried to play on a torn hamstring today, it would be quickly evident that they didn’t belong on the floor.</p>

<p>Fast forward to game 5 of these finals, as soon as porzingis came in, Dallas literally put him in every single action and generated lots of wide open 3s. They unfortunately weren’t equipped to take advantage. Made me remember that first take episode.</p>

I&rsquo;ve tried watching games from the 80s and early 90&rsquo;s way back when on NBA TV&rsquo;s vault and i literally couldn&rsquo;t.

      <label for="l9u559b" class="commentText"><p>It’s pretty simple actually, not only was the game still developing, the talent wasn’t there because there wasn’t much of a reason financially for people to commit to basketball. Before Magic Johnson and Bird revived the NBA, they were on the verge of bankruptcy. That’s how bad it was. When a league is in that dire of a position, it doesn’t get much eyes or inspire much of the players to pursue it. Imagine the highest paid player in 1980 making <span class="math inline">\(1m a year (equivalent to \)</span>3-4m). Without much viewership, not enough people were trying to pursue a career seriously there. It wasn’t until after Bird and Magic saved the league from bankruptcy, and then MJ, inspired many people afterwards to pursue basketball.</p>

      <label for="l9u5fne" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s literally in the article that this was posted because of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In 2016, Lācis published “An Unnecessary Breakdown of Van Exel’s Fudged 23 Assists” after he came across a 2009 Deadspin story about a then-unnamed Vancouver Grizzlies scorekeeper (Rucker) who admitted to padding stats, most notably in Lakers guard Nick Van Exel’s famous 23-assist game in 1997.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His verdict, which he posted on his website, read: “Nick Van Exel shouldn’t have had more than 17 assists. You can make an argument for him deserving only 15.”</p>

<p>After being disillusioned by Van Exel’s 23-assist game, he posted the assist reel to his YouTube channel. Lācis felt compelled to investigate other big stat-lines. Lācis watched Shaq’s 15-block game of 1993 (more like 10). He broke down the Toronto Raptors’ record-breaking 23-block night of 2001 (more like 17). On a certain level, it was crushing.</p>

<p>“They ruined dreams,” he wrote.</p>

<p>But part of him thought it was important to seek the truth about his favorite sport. That’s how we met and embarked on our next scavenger hunt together.</p>

<p>Next on Lācis’ list of games to acquire: any big defensive night during Jordan’s 1987-88 season.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l9tcpul" class="commentText"><p>Yea I really never want to hear about how defense was better in the 80s/90s. This nets team was 14th in defensive rating that year, and I feel 100% sure there that the 30th ranked teams for the last few years never played defense this bad. Like the star player taking one dribble and getting completely uncontested mid-ranges repeatedly all game is insane. Like star players aren’t even this open on 30 footers nowadays.</p>

      <label for="l9tt5ib" class="commentText"><p>there’s a difference though, if you watch modern highlights guys have to do way more spectacular stuff and there is more resistance to them. jordan is dribbling down the court and pulling up without anyone within a few feet of him.</p>

<p>the second play of this clip, the center throws a horrible pass to half court, jordan steals it, and the center does absolutely nothing to stop the lay in. if that happened today the coach would immediately call a time out and murder that man.</p>

<p>The Nets were the 6th worst defense that year. Detroit was the 6th worst defense this year</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/iEtwCznToA0?feature=shared" target="_blank">Here&rsquo;s a highlight video of Embiid dropping 37/11/8 on Detroit</a>. Within the first minute of the video you see two back cuts for uncontested dunks and a a free roll to the rim for a putback</p>

<p>I guess this means all defense is this era is trash and we can never hear anyone say otherwise</p>

<p>No they weren&rsquo;t lol they were 18th out of 23 so a bottom 6 defense. The 6th worst DRtg this year was the Pistons. You could easily find plenty of highlight videos of superstars making the Pistons defense look stupid</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In the 87-88 season teams got 25.8 assists on 42.1 made gield goals, or 61%. Last season it was 26.7 on 42.2, or 63%. Yeah there was a bit more iso back then but there was also a lot more pick and roll, so if the assist stats were juiced it wasn’t by much.</p>

<p>Stockton got a ton of assists because he ran the pick and roll to death with Malone, one of the greatest PFs and pick and roll finishers of all time.</p>

<p>As for steals, guys had the freedom to gamble a lot more back then. You can see it in game tape, guys are constantly cheating off their man to swipe for the ball. Nowadays you can’t do that shit because teams make you pay with the three pointer.</p>

<p>I highly doubt stats were juiced in the conspiratorial way you’re suggesting. The game was just played a different way.</p>

<p>What’s the actual rule supposed to be? Is it time based out by play?</p>

      <label for="l9tn111" class="commentText"><p>It’s a small part of why Stockton won’t be caught, but the biggest part is that he and Malone ran constant PnRs for the better part of two decades.</p>

<p>If you give a great passing guard, one who is renowned for his toughness (Stockton never missed games) and longevity, one of the best scoring bigs in the history of the league as his partner, and that big is <em>also</em> renowned for his toughness and longevity, you might not win the big one, but you’ll accrue some absolutely insane stats along the way.</p>

<p>Their skill sets and physical makeups were just a perfect match for one another.</p>

<p>Assists are juiced now as well, there was an article about it this season.</p>

<p>Given that people have found statpadding keepers at home in the 60s, 80s, 90s, and current year, I think it&rsquo;s safe to say there is no era safe from this lol</p>

      <label for="l9vb1pr" class="commentText"><p>Lot of people comparing the skill of these players to today&rsquo;s. Who are you to say you have an eye for talent? People are literally employed the world over to spot basketball talent. It is, in itself, a skill. You might not know the difference between a layup and an alley oop for all we know, let alone the intricacies of offensive plays and defensive schemes.<br>
And even if you are right, what the hell does that have to do with Jordan&rsquo;s widely accepted position as the greatest basketball player of all time? Because players are more skilled now it devalues his greatness? That&rsquo;s absolutely absurd and just shows you have no idea what greatness actually entails.<br>
One of the most widely accepted GOATs in their sport is Michael Phelps. He is the GOAT because of what he did <em>at the time he competed.</em> He won a ton of stuff and broke a lot of records. Take a guess at how many world records he holds today&hellip;none. Not a single individual world record is still held by Michael Phelps. Because the swimmers today have gotten better in much the same way you claim that basketball players have gotten better. So, by your metric, Michael Phelps is no longer the greatest swimmer of all time&hellip;.which, of course, is just sheer lunacy. Of course he is still the greatest, just like Jordan is still the greatest because greatness is measured by your performance against <em>your peers</em> not some hypothetical matchup against a modern day player or great players that came before. It&rsquo;s about what you did in your sport during your time and how it compares to what others did. Jordan simply did more. The accolades say so and so do the stats. But perhaps comparing him to Phelps is a bit unfair to MJ because if Michael Jordan was Michael Phelps all those swimming world records, well most of them, would still be standing to this day.</p>
