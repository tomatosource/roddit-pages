He would have put up monster numbers in Charlotte based off of work ethic alone. People acting like there isn’t any locker room discourse in the NBA. But damn let’s not at like Kobe had an all star cast post Achilles. He had to deal with a bunch of rookies and has beens. Just like when Kobe was rookie. Nothing was handed to him. He had to play behind Eddie Jones and a coach who refuses to play him minutes. Coming from championship caliber to a tanking team is frustrating to any great player who isn’t just in it for the check.</p>

<p>Your garbage attitude will not be liked and tolerated because you don’t have all the skill, success and money to sway everyone into supporting you.</p>

<p>Mamba mentality to me is his incredible work ethic and stubbornness to succeed. I took that away and work hard at whatever it is I’m working on. Not act like you’re the shit and think it’s “mamba mentality” therefore I will become loved and successful like Kobe.</p>

<p>Unbelievable some of these people, one day hopefully they will wake up from the self delusion. You can still succeed and not act like a dick to everyone around you.</p>

      <label for="lj8cj9e" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just one of those unfortunate things that happens in our society. It&rsquo;s not sexy to glamourise <em>hey, this person isn&rsquo;t flashy or anything but they&rsquo;re just nice and they&rsquo;ve worked hard and they&rsquo;ve achieved a decent life where they&rsquo;re well-liked and happy and get by okay.</em> It just gets way more eyeballs to put someone like Kobe on the pedestal and draw some kind of clear line between his incredible achievements and the absolute dickishness he employed to attain those achievements. It&rsquo;s even more unfortunate that people don&rsquo;t employ critical thinking about what exactly we&rsquo;re being sold by these narratives. Like, by almost all accounts Jordan is both the best/most successful player of all time and an absolutely abhorrent dick, but he&rsquo;s still revered not only for his on-court accomplishments (which is fair and reasonable) but as a person to emulate (which is fucking nuts). Same with Kobe.</p>

He mellowed out as he aged and he was remembered more for his basketball success than his off-court drama. Especially in his last year(s), it was just old man Kobe getting a few licks in before it was his time to go. In 2016, Golden State&rsquo;s 73rd win to break the all-time season win record landed on the same day as Kobe&rsquo;s last game ever, and by some metrics [20% more people watched Kobe than the Warriors](<a href="https://money.cnn.com/2016/04/14/media/lakers-warriors-espn-kobe-ratings/index.html#:~:text=Golden%20State's%20march%20to%2073,for%20ESPN%20on%20Wednesday%20night" target="_blank">https://money.cnn.com/2016/04/14/media/lakers-warriors-espn-kobe-ratings/index.html#:~:text=Golden%20State&rsquo;s%20march%20to%2073,for%20ESPN%20on%20Wednesday%20night</a>). It was just such a big deal to see one of the greats retiring that there wasn&rsquo;t focus on anything else, and then maybe dying so soon after locked that feeling into place.</p>

      <label for="lj801pw" class="commentText"><p>It takes 2 seconds of critical thinking to exclude him from the debate.</p>

<p>Kobe was great but Jordan was better at every aspect of the game, playing the same style, and having both more individual and team success.</p>

<p>Any argument for Kobe as GOAT leads to Jordan. There is, literally, nothing that Kobe has on Jordan, so he can never be GOAT. At least other players have differentiated resumes and different arguments. Kobe has none of that.</p>

However, if you watch his documentary, Reggie, you can see how much of a stand up guy he is and how much he had to endure throughout his career. To even be friends with two incredible legends with down-to-earth characters like Julius Erving and Hank Aaron, you can’t be that bad of an asshole. Hell, watch his interview at the Field of Dreams game this year at Rickwood Field in Alabama. Probably the most real interview you’ve ever seen in recent years.</p>

<p>With the density being proposed for 23 Oakwood, there are major concerns in terms of both privacy and safety with three-story townhomes looming directly behind us.</p>

<p>We kindly ask that the Town adopts the new Housing Element without the inclusion of 23 Oakwood. Should that not be sufficient for the State, we ask that the Town commits to investing in considerably taller fencing and landscaping to block sight lines onto our family&rsquo;s property.</p>

      <label for="lj87ori" class="commentText"><p>It is literally NIMBYism, but it&rsquo;s not like this was a low-income housing development that he&rsquo;s suing to block. It&rsquo;s multimillion dollar townhomes with direct sightlines into his property. And it&rsquo;s just a letter saying, &ldquo;Hey, these developments can see into our back yard. If you&rsquo;re going to build it, maintain our privacy.&rdquo; Seems like a reasonable ask if you&rsquo;re a homeowner basically anywhere.</p>

<p>Like Sports Illustrated or ESPN wouldn&rsquo;t dare report a story about MJ being a dick or punching Kerr. If they piss him off, the most popular athlete in the world would refuse to do any ESPN interviews or appear on a SI cover story which boost their ratings.</p>

<p>It was 100% worth it to the organization as a business. Make him retire as a Laker and not give him the Tony Parker / D-Wade treatment.  Show the players that they&rsquo;ll be taken care of.</p>

      <label for="lj83t3k" class="commentText"><p>Not necessarily that, but when you factor in how Kobe was kinda trash at that point and was raking in the classic Lakers legacy overpay they couldn’t afford to put pieces around him on that team. Plus when you have a 35+ year old chucker running the show it stunts the development of your young players.</p>

<p>That Jeremy Lin year was especially bad roster wise as Randle was hurt and Clarkson is the only young player who became notable that played for them that year, but look at Kobe’s last season. Randle was healthy and became an all NBA players, Russell has been an all star, Clarkson has been an elite 6th man, and Larry Nance even carved out a nice career. What’s the common theme though? They had to get away from the Lakers. If Kobe was willing to take a step back or realize he was cooked and walked away that would’ve helped with their development so much more instead of stunting them for a season, wasting the year.</p>

<p>Obviously you were able to eventually bring in Lebron and AD, but that would’ve been a good young core and they still probably put you into position to land the picks that got guys like Ingram and Lonzo. They wouldn’t have been great with how young they were, however it would’ve given them more ammo to build around Lebron and potentially win another championship or two. Instead their growth was stunted to appease Kobe.</p>

      <label for="lj81alt" class="commentText"><p>The last couple of seasons, sure, you can make the argument Kobe was a much less effectively player than Duncan was in his old age.</p>

<p>But the narrative that Timmy was head and shoulders a better player and &ldquo;basketball opposite&rdquo; of Kobe is fundamentally wrong and downright disingenuous.</p>

<p>Look at their playoff head to head splits. Controlling for the fact that Duncan had Shaq to deal with in their earlier matches, in head-to-head playoff matchups in their prime, Kobe kept up with, and dominated Duncan in many series. 2001 WCF (Prime Duncan) gets swept by Kobe, who put up 33/7/7 on a higher TS% than Duncan. 2004 WCSF, where Prime Duncan loses 4-2 to the extremely injured and taped-together Lakers &ldquo;Super team&rdquo;. Kobe averaged 26/6/5 to Duncan&rsquo;s 20/12/3.</p>

<p>But what about Shaq? Good point, let&rsquo;s look at the 2008 WCF, where All-NBA, All-NBA Defense 1st teamer Tim Duncan loses to Kobe 4-1, with Kobe averaging 29/5/4 on higher TS%, without Shaq. Duncan go the better of Kobe in 1999 and 2003, but the idea that Kobe and Timmy aren&rsquo;t comparable is flat out wrong imo.</p>

<p>Like that one story of him flaunting his gold medal by putting it in Gasols locker to &ldquo;motivate&rdquo; him is such a deuchebag move. Especially since Kobes team was stacked af.</p>

<p>Im honestly shocked Gasol even has good relations with the guy, but i guess time and rings helped a lot with their relationship.</p>

<p>Now to be fair i get why players didnt speak out about Kobe and other guys.</p>

<p>The guys that are big enough to speak up dont because they have good relationships with each other cause they arent on the same team usually or dont wanna create any drama around it.</p>

<p>Like Shaq these days or Dwight. With Kobe, him dying kinda makes his a touchy subject to begin with.</p>

<p>And then there are guys that he managed to patch things up with (like Shaq) and guys that just bought into that mamba shit.</p>

<p>In reality, Kobe was just a bad person who wanted to be next MJ but couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>

<p>He is an all time great, but in the GOAT debate he is 8-10 place.</p>

      <label for="lj7tq3c" class="commentText"><p>One of the most telling stories I ever heard about Kobe was him and the documentary “Kobe Bryant’s Muse” about his comeback from the Achilles injury.  It was originally just a normal documentary where they interviewed other players/coaches/execs etc along with Kobe about him and his legacy.</p>

<p>Kobe hated it.  He made them recut it so the only person interviewed was him.  It’s him talking to the camera intercut with archival footage for 90 minutes.  It is an amazing depiction of a control freak who had been given complete control of his situation and it still wasn’t enough to satisfy him.</p>

<p>And if you think I’m kidding: <a href="https://youtu.be/8dga5amhKnQ?si=OxkIO1A0mEynJ0sU" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/8dga5amhKnQ?si=OxkIO1A0mEynJ0sU</a></p>

<p>I’m just glad he decided to open up and mentor younger players towards the end/after his career instead of isolating himself from the others like MJ did.</p>

      <label for="lj87700" class="commentText"><p>Lin is 100% talking about Melo when he references &ldquo;not saying what he should have said&rdquo;. I know someone who played for the Knicks during Linsanity. He told me that Melo would invite the team out after games/practices and would skip over Lin&rsquo;s locker and simply pretending like he wasn&rsquo;t even there. He also confirmed all the rumors about Melo not liking Lin were true. But its not like Melo hated Lin at the same time.</p>

<p>I also got to meet Lin when he played on the Lakers through someone that knew Lin from his college church group (so Asian I know). It was funny because we were chatting in front of the team bus after a game, and Lin suddenly cut off and said &ldquo;Oh shoot I gtg&rdquo;. Turns out Kobe had arrived and he didn&rsquo;t like to wait. So when Kobe got on the team bus was when the team bus left.</p>

<p>as a Celts fan Kobe was always the enemy both on and off court. Him being an asshole always made it easier to hate him.</p>

<p>Honestly I think Lebron coming in just lessened the kobe hate in boston. The worst part is bron is just corny he didn’t even do half the shit kobe did</p>

      <label for="lj86vcf" class="commentText"><p>I think I get it. As someone with a younger brother, it took me a long time to treat him as an equal instead of talking down to him. It took a lot of self control not to revert back to old habits, and maybe kobe had to break off all communication in order to do it. I’m not denying kobe was an asshole, which i’m sure i was to my younger brother at times, but it adds a bit of nuance to the situation. I’m glad jeremy stood up for himself, which i’m sure is not easy in that situation.</p>
