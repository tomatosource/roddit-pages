<p>Your garbage attitude will not be liked and tolerated because you don’t have all the skill, success and money to sway everyone into supporting you.</p>

<p>Mamba mentality to me is his incredible work ethic and stubbornness to succeed. I took that away and work hard at whatever it is I’m working on. Not act like you’re the shit and think it’s “mamba mentality” therefore I will become loved and successful like Kobe.</p>

<p>Unbelievable some of these people, one day hopefully they will wake up from the self delusion. You can still succeed and not act like a dick to everyone around you.</p>

      <label for="lj8cj9e" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just one of those unfortunate things that happens in our society. It&rsquo;s not sexy to glamourise <em>hey, this person isn&rsquo;t flashy or anything but they&rsquo;re just nice and they&rsquo;ve worked hard and they&rsquo;ve achieved a decent life where they&rsquo;re well-liked and happy and get by okay.</em> It just gets way more eyeballs to put someone like Kobe on the pedestal and draw some kind of clear line between his incredible achievements and the absolute dickishness he employed to attain those achievements. It&rsquo;s even more unfortunate that people don&rsquo;t employ critical thinking about what exactly we&rsquo;re being sold by these narratives. Like, by almost all accounts Jordan is both the best/most successful player of all time and an absolutely abhorrent dick, but he&rsquo;s still revered not only for his on-court accomplishments (which is fair and reasonable) but as a person to emulate (which is fucking nuts). Same with Kobe.</p>

      <label for="lj8cehr" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d say the public forgot the ruthlessness even before that. He mellowed out as he aged and he was remembered more for his basketball success than his off-court drama. Especially in his last year(s), it was just old man Kobe getting a few licks in before it was his time to go. In 2016, Golden State&rsquo;s 73rd win to break the all-time season win record landed on the same day as Kobe&rsquo;s last game ever, and by some metrics [20% more people watched Kobe than the Warriors](<a href="https://money.cnn.com/2016/04/14/media/lakers-warriors-espn-kobe-ratings/index.html#:~:text=Golden%20State's%20march%20to%2073,for%20ESPN%20on%20Wednesday%20night" target="_blank">https://money.cnn.com/2016/04/14/media/lakers-warriors-espn-kobe-ratings/index.html#:~:text=Golden%20State&rsquo;s%20march%20to%2073,for%20ESPN%20on%20Wednesday%20night</a>). It was just such a big deal to see one of the greats retiring that there wasn&rsquo;t focus on anything else, and then maybe dying so soon after locked that feeling into place.</p>

<p>The “am I a bad person?” Nike ad with Kobe that they put in for the Olympics sums it up. It’s totally possible to be successful and a rational person at the same time.</p>

<p>Kobe was great but Jordan was better at every aspect of the game, playing the same style, and having both more individual and team success.</p>

<p>Any argument for Kobe as GOAT leads to Jordan. There is, literally, nothing that Kobe has on Jordan, so he can never be GOAT. At least other players have differentiated resumes and different arguments. Kobe has none of that.</p>

<p>edit: Excerpt of Currys letter to the local government:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With the density being proposed for 23 Oakwood, there are major concerns in terms of both privacy and safety with three-story townhomes looming directly behind us.</p>

<p>We kindly ask that the Town adopts the new Housing Element without the inclusion of 23 Oakwood. Should that not be sufficient for the State, we ask that the Town commits to investing in considerably taller fencing and landscaping to block sight lines onto our family&rsquo;s property.</p>

It&rsquo;s multimillion dollar townhomes with direct sightlines into his property. And it&rsquo;s just a letter saying, &ldquo;Hey, these developments can see into our back yard. If you&rsquo;re going to build it, maintain our privacy.&rdquo; Seems like a reasonable ask if you&rsquo;re a homeowner basically anywhere.</p>

Wish his career would have panned out better than what he got but it is what it is. At least he still made a fortune and last longer than most of the average players in the League.</p>

<p>Just wish he could push to his potential a bit more. But he had some major flaws as a basketball player. Compound that with bad injury luck he just never got to flourish even tho he got couple of chances to build a team around him.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wondered if he stayed at Atlanta he could have had a more impactful ending. Tray Young was super cool and accepting Jeremy&rsquo;s mentorships so I could see him thrive there better instead of a alreqdy stacked Toronto team.</p>

      <label for="lj9jnwi" class="commentText"><p>Agreed. But you couldn&rsquo;t help but hope the Cinderella run could have a more cinematic ending to close it not. But just for him but for the Asian community he is trying to represent. There&rsquo;s a reason he got such a warm welcomed by the fans when he first got traded there even with little contribution.</p>

<p>But yeah, I agree with your sentiment. He&rsquo;s a multimillionaire and seems to know how to manage his wealth. So he&rsquo;ll be fine for sure.</p>

<p>and kind of got done dirty by the league</p>

<p>After 5 years of experience, the Nets paid him $37 million for 3 years where he cranked out (78, 36, and 1) games across those seasons. He was a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/salaries/_/year/2017/page/3/seasontype/4" target="_blank">top-100 highest-paid player</a> in those years. In 2016-17, he was higher-paid than Andre Iguodala, Zach Randolph, Danny Green, Jeff Teague, <strong>Kevin Garnett,</strong> and <em><strong>Tim Duncan</strong></em></p>

<p>He was walked to the door because he was falling apart and didn&rsquo;t even have bench value.</p>

<p>People always say that like he didn&rsquo;t get paid by multiple teams and had his shot.</p>

<p>Yes, injuries took his athleticism away but that happens to a lot of players. Some can adjust, he couldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>The Kobe and Shaq feud can’t be boiled down to “Kobe was a jerk and Shaq hated him”. After the threepeat, Shaq got complacent and lazy. He was also insecure with the idea of Kobe surpassing him as a player (Kobe was entering his prime, Shaq was exiting it).</p>

<p>Like Sports Illustrated or ESPN wouldn&rsquo;t dare report a story about MJ being a dick or punching Kerr. If they piss him off, the most popular athlete in the world would refuse to do any ESPN interviews or appear on a SI cover story which boost their ratings.</p>

      <label for="lj81alt" class="commentText"><p>The last couple of seasons, sure, you can make the argument Kobe was a much less effectively player than Duncan was in his old age.</p>

<p>But the narrative that Timmy was head and shoulders a better player and &ldquo;basketball opposite&rdquo; of Kobe is fundamentally wrong and downright disingenuous.</p>

<p>Look at their playoff head to head splits. Controlling for the fact that Duncan had Shaq to deal with in their earlier matches, in head-to-head playoff matchups in their prime, Kobe kept up with, and dominated Duncan in many series. 2001 WCF (Prime Duncan) gets swept by Kobe, who put up 33/7/7 on a higher TS% than Duncan. 2004 WCSF, where Prime Duncan loses 4-2 to the extremely injured and taped-together Lakers &ldquo;Super team&rdquo;. Kobe averaged 26/6/5 to Duncan&rsquo;s 20/12/3.</p>

<p>But what about Shaq? Good point, let&rsquo;s look at the 2008 WCF, where All-NBA, All-NBA Defense 1st teamer Tim Duncan loses to Kobe 4-1, with Kobe averaging 29/5/4 on higher TS%, without Shaq. Duncan go the better of Kobe in 1999 and 2003, but the idea that Kobe and Timmy aren&rsquo;t comparable is flat out wrong imo.</p>

With plenty of time throughout the day to rest, meditate, and nap as needed.  I guarantee if Kobe was feeling tired and sleepy on an off day, he didn&rsquo;t need to pick up dry cleaning and go grocery shopping, but could chill and relax at home.</p>

<p>Everyone&rsquo;s different and the physicians, physical trainers, and assistants would have made sure Kobe was able to get whatever rest he needed.</p>

I know someone who played for the Knicks during Linsanity. He told me that Melo would invite the team out after games/practices and would skip over Lin&rsquo;s locker and simply pretending like he wasn&rsquo;t even there. He also confirmed all the rumors about Melo not liking Lin were true. But its not like Melo hated Lin at the same time.</p>

<p>I also got to meet Lin when he played on the Lakers through someone that knew Lin from his college church group (so Asian I know). It was funny because we were chatting in front of the team bus after a game, and Lin suddenly cut off and said &ldquo;Oh shoot I gtg&rdquo;. Turns out Kobe had arrived and he didn&rsquo;t like to wait. So when Kobe got on the team bus was when the team bus left.</p>

<p>Now to be fair i get why players didnt speak out about Kobe and other guys.</p>

<p>The guys that are big enough to speak up dont because they have good relationships with each other cause they arent on the same team usually or dont wanna create any drama around it.</p>

<p>Like Shaq these days or Dwight. With Kobe, him dying kinda makes his a touchy subject to begin with.</p>

<p>And then there are guys that he managed to patch things up with (like Shaq) and guys that just bought into that mamba shit.</p>

<p>In their minds, the only response from Gasol should be have been to go tell coach Kobe hurt his feelings and demand an apology.</p>

      <label for="lj7tq3c" class="commentText"><p>One of the most telling stories I ever heard about Kobe was him and the documentary “Kobe Bryant’s Muse” about his comeback from the Achilles injury.  It was originally just a normal documentary where they interviewed other players/coaches/execs etc along with Kobe about him and his legacy.</p>

<p>Kobe hated it.  He made them recut it so the only person interviewed was him.  It’s him talking to the camera intercut with archival footage for 90 minutes.  It is an amazing depiction of a control freak who had been given complete control of his situation and it still wasn’t enough to satisfy him.</p>

<p>And if you think I’m kidding: <a href="https://youtu.be/8dga5amhKnQ?si=OxkIO1A0mEynJ0sU" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/8dga5amhKnQ?si=OxkIO1A0mEynJ0sU</a></p>

      <label for="lj8g3q3" class="commentText"><p>I remember during the height of Linsanity, leading up to Knicks vs Lakers, Kobe was asked about Jeremy Lin and said &ldquo;I have no idea who that is&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Obviously he knew who Lin was, but Kobe was basically saying, &ldquo;Why should I pay any heed to some kid who had a few good games and suddenly eclipsed my popularly overnight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lin torched the Lakers for 38 that evening.</p>

<p>as a Celts fan Kobe was always the enemy both on and off court. Him being an asshole always made it easier to hate him.</p>

<p>Honestly I think Lebron coming in just lessened the kobe hate in boston. The worst part is bron is just corny he didn’t even do half the shit kobe did</p>

      <label for="lj9he4z" class="commentText"><p>Kobe felt that being on speaking terms with him was a privilege. Smush Parker talked about how Kobe told him that he wasn&rsquo;t allowed to talk to him until he got more accolades under his belt. So Kobe basically took away Lin&rsquo;s speaking-to-Kobe privilege.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m assuming Kobe&rsquo;s mentality was, &ldquo;I actually gave you the honor of being on speaking terms with me, and now you&rsquo;re complaining about how I speak to you? Well now that honor is revoked. Problem solved.&rdquo;</p>
