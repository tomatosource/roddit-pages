<p>76ers were 31-8 with Embiid and Maxey healthy. A 65 win pace</p>

<p>The Cavs were on a 22-4 run before Mitchell went down</p>

<p>Bucks were 44-21 with Lillard and Giannis healthy</p>

<p>The Heat had Butler missing despite their poor regular season performance and he’s a known playoff riser.</p>

<p>Yes, the East wasn’t healthy at all. Boston were the best team in the East and the NBA, but would’ve faced stronger competition if some players stayed healthy.</p>

      <label for="l8q84dx" class="commentText"><p>Not really comparable - part of what made the Celtics so good was their depth, and losing their 3rd or 4th best player was fairly replaceable.</p>

<p>All the other teams mentioned had much more integral parts of their team get injured. Like Embiid being hurt as he was has comparable impact on the Sixers than if Tatum were out and Brown was playing injured on the Celtics - which is why it&rsquo;s a big advantage to be so deep that you can weather a single injury without the team being crippled.</p>

<p>Repeating is so dam dificult, especially when one of your top players gets injured often.</p>

<p>For us thats Jamal and for the Celtics thats KP.</p>

<p>Maybe if KP was a healthier dude i could see it, but not without KP.</p>

<p>Still not to say they couldnt do it though, but they are most certainly not invincible as they have seemed in this playoff.</p>

      <label for="l8pt0jn" class="commentText"><p>He missed almost 2 of his first 4 seasons with back issues, I don’t think his back issues can be ignored going forward.  Maybe they’re over with but I could also see you guys moving on from him after how poorly he played this year in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="l8ptjrc" class="commentText"><p>Maybe. But there is still a lot of hoppe in MPJ improvong and mayeb even breaking out more.</p>

<p>Like you said he missed 2 of his first 4 seasons to injuries so he didnt really play as much as he should have.</p>

<p>There is achance he improves. But honestly we wouldnt even be talking like this if his contract was better.</p>

<p>Still cant understand how they gave him the max for his production.</p>

<p>That was the first time I&rsquo;ve heard the word &ldquo;dynasty&rdquo; used with this team. Will they be competitive for years to come? Most likely. That question was the first time I&rsquo;ve heard anyone imply they were a dynasty.</p>

      <label for="l8qa9d1" class="commentText"><p>You belittled the 76ers winning because it was so long ago. Completely reasonable, funny roast. I then applied the same logic by implying making fun of old accomplishments is especially risky for a Celtics fan. It’s really not that deep, I’m not sure why you even feel the need to defend against it, it’s some of the softest trash talk I could even say.</p>

      <label for="l8qcg0z" class="commentText"><p>He missed one game , and besides embiid is never healthy to begin with.this has nothing with me being a Celtics fan and I do not have anything against the sixers.but the rest were healthy (correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong again).harden had a disastrous game 7 and embiid didn&rsquo;t particularly play well in that game,only guy that showed up was p.j tucker(I might be wrong again but I believe he was the only champion in that roster).but what I said was ultimately true, the sixers have not beaten the Celtics since the early 80&rsquo;s.its just too sad that even with all that talent they have had , they still choke every single time in the playoffs,and that&rsquo;s just the truth of it .</p>

<p>Please sign so called &ldquo;playoff p &rdquo; just for him to sit in the same hospital with embiid come playoff time next year.</p>

<p>But Im intrigued to see maxey next year tho,only daylight in that team</p>

For example if he played payed at the level he was at this year the Celtics lose lol. If Tatum was actually a superstar that series wouldn’t have gone 7. You made up the sixers were fully healthy because that was an embarassing series for the Celtics as heavy favorites against a team where the best player in the series should’ve been out 6 weeks+ and Tatum waited till that player had no lift left to stat pad for the 3rd most impressive 50 point game of those playoffs lmao</p>

<p>There was no general perception from /r/nba that he was a dirty player before these playoffs. I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time here defending Embiid since he won his MVP, nobody said anything like that before this year.</p>

<p>I do think he did a lot of dirty shit these playoffs FYI and the criticism in that regard is warranted&hellip; but you&rsquo;re just wrong. You believe what you want to believe, it&rsquo;s all part of the narrative.</p>

<p>Like, the Celtics probably would’ve won the East anyway. But it’s no secret they played some injured teams. It’s still a well deserved ring.</p>

<p>And calling any team a dynasty before 3ish rings is silly anyway.</p>

It sucks that the Sixers haven&rsquo;t won a chip with Embiid yet but he&rsquo;s given the Sixers fans quality and entertaining basketball since 2017 so I can&rsquo;t complain.

      <label for="l8qfjk2" class="commentText"><p>I mean I guess. It was just weird to see him take 7-8 shots in a 25-30 point game in the 4th quarter while playing near the entire quarter too. He was clearly just gunning for 50.</p>

<p>Again still a great game but still.</p>

<p>Boston stars are early in their prime years, they haven&rsquo;t sacrificed much of anything in terms of future picks to build their bench. Plus Brad Stevens is making moves that put other FO contenders to shame.</p>

<p>The true threat is in the West for the foreseeable future. Denver, OKC, Dallas and maybe SA</p>

If the Bucks can stay healthy and figure it out then they’ll also be a pretty solid threat. As for the Sixers they still gotta figure out free agency. The team they had this year isn’t good enough.

      <label for="l8px9ni" class="commentText"><p>Well he’s right. And to those of you giving Embiid a hard time about his injury history, I’d like to see you in play with Bells Palsy, a torn meniscus, a torn thumb ligament, or a knee sprain. At least he plays through his injuries unlike a lot of players. And he mentions in this interview his injury luck, for those that don’t watch.</p>

<p>One last thing. Everyone was talking about Denver having the easiest run of all time last year. The Celtics don’t get that same treatment, but they should. They didn’t face anyone worthy of competition until Dallas. It is what it is.</p>

      <label for="l8q6876" class="commentText"><p>The Celtics would have beaten all of their opponents even if they were fully healthy. They beat a healthy Embiid in the past with worse teams than their current iteration in large part due to the man not being a reliable player in the postseason. Crazy cope coming from him.</p>

      <label for="l8pycur" class="commentText"><p>I’m being serious. If you think you’re in a situation where you’re facing a dynasty in the next five years, what’s the sense of holding on to a franchise player when you’re a lottery/ play-in team during those five years, when you can get multiple 1st round picks down the road?</p>
