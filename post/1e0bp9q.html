      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1e0bp9q/a_note_on_embiids_national_team_eligibility/"><p>A note on Embiid&rsquo;s national team eligibility</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>It&rsquo;s bothered me the discourse that there&rsquo;s been about Embiid playing for the USA and felt the need to address some things as most NBA fans don&rsquo;t follow international basketball that much.</p>

<p>First, I know rational people are fine with it and understand it&rsquo;s his personal choice, yadda, yadda. But I understand people having their own opinions even if they acknowledge it&rsquo;s his choice.</p>

<p>But now to address his options.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s medal chasing, he should&rsquo;ve played for France.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>Embiid is not French, has never lived in France, and has no french connection outside of Cameroon previously being a French territory so it&rsquo;s a Francophone country. Embiid playing for France would&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;medal chasing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gained French citizenship through naturalization as a person of &ldquo;exceptional interest.&rdquo; Embiid playing for France would be just like Rondae Hollis-Jefferson playing for Jordan, a player with no connection just naturalized simply to play basketball. FIBA rules allows countries to naturalize one player for their team. He is infinitely more American than he is French.</p>

<p><strong>Why not Cameroon?</strong></p>

<p>To frame things, fellow Cameroonian Pascal Siakam has also never played for Cameroon. Siakam has indicated he would love to but never has. Why hasn&rsquo;t Siakam played for them despite being vocal about being open to it?</p>

<p>For people who don&rsquo;t know, when NBA players play for their national teams, the country&rsquo;s federation has to pay for insurance in case the player gets injured while on duty. If a player gets injured, they will have to pay their NBA salary while they&rsquo;re injured and also potential damages to their career. And we all know how expensive NBA contracts are so the insurance would be pretty hefty for it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not unexpected for the less powerful basketball countries to not call up NBA players because they can&rsquo;t afford to pay the insurance for their contract. There&rsquo;s <em>a ton</em> of Nigerian (born and raised or by ancestry) NBA players but the best ones haven&rsquo;t always played for them. I remember very clearly Festus Ezeli and Al-Farouq Aminu couldn&rsquo;t play in one Olympics because Nigeria wouldn&rsquo;t pay for the insurance. (Nigeria has seemed to be much more invested in recent years)</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s previously been reports that Cameroon can&rsquo;t afford Siakam. There&rsquo;s also been other reasons thrown about but unless you think it&rsquo;s purely posturing by Siakam saying he would, it would seem more to be that he can&rsquo;t and that would be the reason why he can&rsquo;t. And when you add in that Embiid makes more and is a much higher injury risk, I&rsquo;d be stunned if they could afford it.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> not french, Cameroon almost certainly can&rsquo;t pay his insurance</p>

      <label for="lcm5iuc" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think anyone would have cared if he went directly to Team USA. It&rsquo;s just his indecision and seemingly doing whatever the f he wants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know your sincere interest in basketball and its development and, in general, in the sport that honors France,&rdquo; begins the document made public by &lsquo;RMC Sport&rsquo;. &ldquo;After discussions with the French Basketball Federation, I have already made my decision. I would like to take the steps to obtain French nationality and thus be selected by Les Blues. I do not wish to play for any other national team. I have sent a dossier to the Ministry of the Interior and Foreign Affairs,&rdquo; the center confessed in his letter.</p>

<p>Embiid said that &ldquo;it would be an immense honor to join the French team to participate in the next major international competitions, first and foremost the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. I measure the solemnity of my application, what it represents, what it means, but also, in certain aspects, its duration and its complexity with respect to the usual criteria for the granting of nationality&rdquo;. Directly, the Sixers player asked Macron &ldquo;for his support to support these initiatives, support without which they will not succeed. Please accept, Mr. President, the assurances of my highest consideration.&rdquo;</p>

France was in the wrong if they were treating it like that, and so was Embiid.</p>

      <label for="lcmpl4b" class="commentText"><p>Every country &ldquo;recruits&rdquo; for the Olympics, because every country wants to try to get their best eligible players playing. Especially when the talent is mostly multimillionaires, you want to be able to convince your best players to play for a non monetary reason.</p>

<p>And well, that&rsquo;s the system the Olympics has. There are deal closings and recruitment of eligible players because the Olympics allows for it. Complain to them.</p>

<p>And France was also 100% involved since they gave Embiid citizenship hoping he would play. To me, it&rsquo;d be more annoying if Embiid actually did do that for a country he basically has no connection to other than a language they share. But either way, I&rsquo;d recognize it as part of the system, and not shit on the player or the country for trying their best to win.</p>

<p>So for me it’s not a ‘racist’ or ‘xenophobic’ issue. It’s a moral one. Joel accepted French citizenship and then didn’t hold up to his part of the deal which was to play for France. He was disingenuous with his intent.</p>

<p>If he hadn’t of done that then there would be literally no qualms about playing for the US.</p>

<p>edit: correcting myself, sorry I misremembered. Embiid never said he planned to play for France. He did the naturalization process and Boris Diaw said Embiid wanted to. He got French citizenship then got American citizenship shortly after. He was likely in the process with both simultaneously to get options and just got French first.</p>

<p>He moved to the U.S. in high school, specifically for Basketball. Similar to Ben Simmons.</p>

      <label for="lcmdibo" class="commentText"><p>Not the same, but I grew up in a smaller town in Northern California until I graduated from high school and went to college in Southern California. I&rsquo;ve lived in LA for over 20 years since. Other than being a Sacramento Kings fan, I consider myself an LA person much more than Northern California because my life events were imo more important in LA and because I have more of a connection to where I choose to live rather than where I happened to grow up.</p>

<p>It’s shady and I feel like some criticism for that is justified, but as far as teams he should <em>rightfully</em> be playing for based on his actual life Cameroon and the US are clearly the only two options. And both good ones, at that.</p>

<p>I take it on u/Choice_Mail comment</p>

<p>«After discussion with the French Basketball Federation, my choice has now been made. I wish to take steps to obtain French naturalization and thus be able to be selected with the Blues. I therefore do not wish to play for any other national team»</p>

<p>And iirc, Vincent Collet( French NT coach ) had a little interview where he appears to be pissed at the Embiid stuff and he basically said that he wasted his time with this.</p>

<p>Now, Embiid made his choice and he had the right to do whatever he want. The Cameroon thing is irrelevant, not even an option. People want to clown him.</p>

He can&rsquo;t win in the court of Reddit/social media opinion.</p>

<p>Not to mention that Americans are bitching about this, which blows my fucking mind. The team is stacked and they were able to add one of the most skilled big men of all-time, shouldn&rsquo;t that be a good thing since it gives the USA an even better chance of winning gold? Why do people want him to join the competition?</p>

      <label for="lcmbo53" class="commentText"><p>Australia has had issues with player insurance in the past. Andrew Bogut has stated that he always used to pay his own insurance, since Australia couldn’t afford it. He did so because he <em>wanted</em> to represent his home country, and because he knew that by having Australia’s highest profile, at the time, NBA athlete representing his country would increase the profile of the sport in the country, which has encouraged more kids to take up the sport. </p>

<p>Embiid might never win a medal if he were to represent Cameroon, but he would help to build the countries basketball program so that they might be in the mix 10 or 15 years from now.</p>

But for the people measuring how much ____ nationality somebody is, he&rsquo;s infinitely more American because he&rsquo;s lived here most of his life. Him getting French citizenship is exactly what that segment accuses him of, playing for a country just to play in the Olympics and to get a medal</p>

He has never played for them. Unless he&rsquo;s posturing by saying he would, the fact that he hasn&rsquo;t adds even more credence to talk of them not paying for his insurance.</p>

<p>If they would pay his insurance, I think he would play for them. And if they could pay for his insurance, they would likely pay for Embiid&rsquo;s and there&rsquo;s a chance he would also play for them. But it seems like playing for Cameroon wasn&rsquo;t even an option for Emiid</p>

<p>But I do look at all the NBA players who can claim Nigerian heritage and imagine what if&hellip;</p>

<p>If all players that could claim Nigerian heritage played for Nigeria they could rival the US and that would be very cool to see</p>

<p>Greece didn&rsquo;t scrape and claw they had a very easy time in the qualifying tournament.</p>

      <label for="lcmkj0c" class="commentText"><p>People flip countries all the time when it comes to the Olympics.  There are people who moved out the US and to a smaller country because there is too much competition here to make the Olympic teams.  People actually do it all the time and from all over the globe.  If your native country is stacked in a competition you want to participate in, you move to a new country that isn’t stacked and make the team.  It’s an incredibly common practice.  There are even guys have represented several different countries at different Olympics.  Embiid choosing US is the least egregious offense by comparison.  And for the most part, it’s a non issue no matter what he reason is.</p>

<p>But as a Sixer fan, it would be hilarious if US doesn’t win gold.  In fact, a part of me is routing against them lol.</p>

      <label for="lcmsuav" class="commentText"><p>The last news I heard about Cameroon was a rebel group was kicking the governments ass and holding control over their only water source. They certainly can’t afford to pay anyone. I just like watching good basketball and Embiid is undeniably a good basketball player so, I’m happy we have him.</p>

<p>Also, him playing for France is such an American take because it makes no sense after one second of thought, but people here hate being wrong since they make their mind up in a half second.</p>

<p>His Uncle, Joe Touomou, who played at Georgetown, seems to be making a career of identifying prospects from francophone west Africa to play in France (and eventually the NBA) so he might have been an influence…</p>

<p>In his letter he states: &ldquo;Also, after discussions with the French Basketball Federation, my choice has now been made. I would like to take the steps to obtain French naturalization and thus be eligible for selection with the Blues. I, therefore, do not wish to play for any other national team. I have sent a file to this effect to the Ministry of the Interior and Foreign Affairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is just snake behaviour. Making a promise and then betraying their good will is clearly not cool. I can feel the frustration of the French. If he never wrote it, then this isn&rsquo;t big deal.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s been in the US since he was a kid. His child is an American. His life is here. Cameroon? Yeah that&rsquo;s his home country and that&rsquo;s a place he could reasonably play for of course.</p>
