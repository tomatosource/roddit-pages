      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1e0bp9q/a_note_on_embiids_national_team_eligibility/"><p>A note on Embiid&rsquo;s national team eligibility</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>It&rsquo;s bothered me the discourse that there&rsquo;s been about Embiid playing for the USA and felt the need to address some things as most NBA fans don&rsquo;t follow international basketball that much.</p>

<p>First, I know rational people are fine with it and understand it&rsquo;s his personal choice, yadda, yadda. But I understand people having their own opinions even if they acknowledge it&rsquo;s his choice.</p>

<p>But now to address his options.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s medal chasing, he should&rsquo;ve played for France.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>Embiid is not French, has never lived in France, and has no french connection outside of Cameroon previously being a French territory so it&rsquo;s a Francophone country. Embiid playing for France would&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;medal chasing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gained French citizenship through naturalization as a person of &ldquo;exceptional interest.&rdquo; Embiid playing for France would be just like Rondae Hollis-Jefferson playing for Jordan, a player with no connection just naturalized simply to play basketball. FIBA rules allows countries to naturalize one player for their team. He is infinitely more American than he is French.</p>

<p><strong>Why not Cameroon?</strong></p>

<p>To frame things, fellow Cameroonian Pascal Siakam has also never played for Cameroon. Siakam has indicated he would love to but never has. Why hasn&rsquo;t Siakam played for them despite being vocal about being open to it?</p>

<p>For people who don&rsquo;t know, when NBA players play for their national teams, the country&rsquo;s federation has to pay for insurance in case the player gets injured while on duty. If a player gets injured, they will have to pay their NBA salary while they&rsquo;re injured and also potential damages to their career. And we all know how expensive NBA contracts are so the insurance would be pretty hefty for it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not unexpected for the less powerful basketball countries to not call up NBA players because they can&rsquo;t afford to pay the insurance for their contract. There&rsquo;s <em>a ton</em> of Nigerian (born and raised or by ancestry) NBA players but the best ones haven&rsquo;t always played for them. I remember very clearly Festus Ezeli and Al-Farouq Aminu couldn&rsquo;t play in one Olympics because Nigeria wouldn&rsquo;t pay for the insurance. (Nigeria has seemed to be much more invested in recent years)</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s previously been reports that Cameroon can&rsquo;t afford Siakam. There&rsquo;s also been other reasons thrown about but unless you think it&rsquo;s purely posturing by Siakam saying he would, it would seem more to be that he can&rsquo;t and that would be the reason why he can&rsquo;t. And when you add in that Embiid makes more and is a much higher injury risk, I&rsquo;d be stunned if they could afford it.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> not french, Cameroon almost certainly can&rsquo;t pay his insurance</p>

      <label for="lclpw6x" class="commentText"><p>I think that comes from Embiid saying ‚Äú‚ÄúAfter discussion with the French Basketball Federation, my choice has now been made. I wish to take steps to obtain French naturalization and thus be able to be selected with the Blues. I therefore do not wish to play for any other national team,‚Äù‚Äù in a letter to France‚Äôs leader. But if people do legitimately think that way then they‚Äôre just dumb</p>

<p>edit: correcting myself, sorry I misremembered. Embiid never said he planned to play for France. He did the naturalization process and Boris Diaw said Embiid wanted to. He got French citizenship then got American citizenship shortly after. He was likely in the process with both simultaneously to get options and just got French first.</p>

<p>it‚Äôs like US/mexico soccer. Mexican americans are often needed to choose whether to play for US or mexico. some choose mexico even though they live in the US because of their heritage and some choose to play for the US because although they are of mexican heritage they grew up in the US.</p>

<p>I take it on u/Choice_Mail comment</p>

<p>¬´After discussion with the French Basketball Federation, my choice has now been made. I wish to take steps to obtain French naturalization and thus be able to be selected with the Blues. I therefore do not wish to play for any other national team¬ª</p>

<p>And iirc, Vincent Collet( French NT coach ) had a little interview where he appears to be pissed at the Embiid stuff and he basically said that he wasted his time with this.</p>

<p>Now, Embiid made his choice and he had the right to do whatever he want. The Cameroon thing is irrelevant, not even an option. People want to clown him.</p>

      <label for="lclpkl6" class="commentText"><p>I bring up Siakam present the insurance aspect of the situation. Siakam has said multiple times that he would love to play for Cameroon. He has never played for them. Unless he&rsquo;s posturing by saying he would, the fact that he hasn&rsquo;t adds even more credence to talk of them not paying for his insurance.</p>

<p>If they would pay his insurance, I think he would play for them. And if they could pay for his insurance, they would likely pay for Embiid&rsquo;s and there&rsquo;s a chance he would also play for them. But it seems like playing for Cameroon wasn&rsquo;t even an option for Emiid</p>

He can&rsquo;t win in the court of Reddit/social media opinion.</p>

<p>Not to mention that Americans are bitching about this, which blows my fucking mind. The team is stacked and they were able to add one of the most skilled big men of all-time, shouldn&rsquo;t that be a good thing since it gives the USA an even better chance of winning gold?

<p>He‚Äôs never participated in a USA game before and still hasn‚Äôt</p>

<p>He really isn‚Äôt committed to this he‚Äôs going to go to the Olympics play for a couple weeks than retire from international play win or lose</p>

<p>So why would he go through the hardship of Cameroon when it would take years of commitment he would need to show up for qualifiers for FIBA WC because that‚Äôs the main process for Qualifying for the Olympics than he would have to do a lot of work to structure Cameroon basketball and would need to be a very active player and committed to the team (which he never has been)</p>

<p>So what‚Äôs to lose shows up has everything taken care of just like his time at Philly and gets to go to Paris for two weeks</p>

<p>It just sucks because the tournament and basketball from
Africa would be better if he was more committed to international play</p>

      <label for="lclpbr8" class="commentText"><p>He is from Cameroon, which is his &ldquo;real&rdquo; country. He had announced for France so that was considered the team he was going to play for a long time. USA had a need at Center (with France being a logjam situation) and then he suddenly decided playing for USA sounded like a good idea.</p>

<p>He treated International Basketball like Free Agency, it&rsquo;s fine to call him out for it. Yes, he&rsquo;s a naturalized citizen and eligible to play for USA, and heck, at this point, he&rsquo;s lived half his life in the USA so it&rsquo;s not even that egregious compared to the guys who play for a team representing a country where their great-great grandmother was born. But it&rsquo;s fair to call him out on it.</p>

      <label for="lcls6ot" class="commentText"><p>Why? He&rsquo;s from Cameroon, that&rsquo;s where he was born and raised before he began his pursuit of a pro basketball career which brought him to the United States. I put &ldquo;real&rdquo; in quotations fwiw to note the fluidity of a thing like national citizenship&hellip; and I would know, like Embiid, I am a naturalized U.S. Citizen who moved to the U.S. for educational/career reasons and have stayed ever since. Nobody has asked me to represent any country in anything, but I would still feel a bit odd not rooting for Canada at the Olympics (Embiid and I basically moved to the U.S. at around the same time).</p>
