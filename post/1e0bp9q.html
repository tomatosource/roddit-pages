      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1e0bp9q/a_note_on_embiids_national_team_eligibility/"><p>A note on Embiid&rsquo;s national team eligibility</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>It&rsquo;s bothered me the discourse that there&rsquo;s been about Embiid playing for the USA and felt the need to address some things as most NBA fans don&rsquo;t follow international basketball that much.</p>

<p>First, I know rational people are fine with it and understand it&rsquo;s his personal choice, yadda, yadda. But I understand people having their own opinions even if they acknowledge it&rsquo;s his choice.</p>

<p>But now to address his options.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s medal chasing, he should&rsquo;ve played for France.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>Embiid is not French, has never lived in France, and has no french connection outside of Cameroon previously being a French territory so it&rsquo;s a Francophone country. Embiid playing for France would&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;medal chasing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gained French citizenship through naturalization as a person of &ldquo;exceptional interest.&rdquo; Embiid playing for France would be just like Rondae Hollis-Jefferson playing for Jordan, a player with no connection just naturalized simply to play basketball. FIBA rules allows countries to naturalize one player for their team. He is infinitely more American than he is French.</p>

<p><strong>Why not Cameroon?</strong></p>

<p>To frame things, fellow Cameroonian Pascal Siakam has also never played for Cameroon. Siakam has indicated he would love to but never has. Why hasn&rsquo;t Siakam played for them despite being vocal about being open to it?</p>

<p>For people who don&rsquo;t know, when NBA players play for their national teams, the country&rsquo;s federation has to pay for insurance in case the player gets injured while on duty. If a player gets injured, they will have to pay their NBA salary while they&rsquo;re injured and also potential damages to their career. And we all know how expensive NBA contracts are so the insurance would be pretty hefty for it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not unexpected for the less powerful basketball countries to not call up NBA players because they can&rsquo;t afford to pay the insurance for their contract. There&rsquo;s <em>a ton</em> of Nigerian (born and raised or by ancestry) NBA players but the best ones haven&rsquo;t always played for them. I remember very clearly Festus Ezeli and Al-Farouq Aminu couldn&rsquo;t play in one Olympics because Nigeria wouldn&rsquo;t pay for the insurance. (Nigeria has seemed to be much more invested in recent years)</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s previously been reports that Cameroon can&rsquo;t afford Siakam. There&rsquo;s also been other reasons thrown about but unless you think it&rsquo;s purely posturing by Siakam saying he would, it would seem more to be that he can&rsquo;t and that would be the reason why he can&rsquo;t. And when you add in that Embiid makes more and is a much higher injury risk, I&rsquo;d be stunned if they could afford it.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> not french, Cameroon almost certainly can&rsquo;t pay his insurance</p>

      <label for="lcm5iuc" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think anyone would have cared if he went directly to Team USA. It&rsquo;s just his indecision and seemingly doing whatever the f he wants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know your sincere interest in basketball and its development and, in general, in the sport that honors France,&rdquo; begins the document made public by &lsquo;RMC Sport&rsquo;. &ldquo;After discussions with the French Basketball Federation, I have already made my decision. I would like to take the steps to obtain French nationality and thus be selected by Les Blues. I do not wish to play for any other national team. I have sent a dossier to the Ministry of the Interior and Foreign Affairs,&rdquo; the center confessed in his letter.</p>

<p>Embiid said that &ldquo;it would be an immense honor to join the French team to participate in the next major international competitions, first and foremost the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. I measure the solemnity of my application, what it represents, what it means, but also, in certain aspects, its duration and its complexity with respect to the usual criteria for the granting of nationality&rdquo;. Directly, the Sixers player asked Macron &ldquo;for his support to support these initiatives, support without which they will not succeed. Please accept, Mr. President, the assurances of my highest consideration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is the rub for me. He was either lying out of his teeth the whole time, or more likely dipped when he realized he could still get the much easier road to Olympic gold. Bitch move either way.</p>

I understand that, not liking him going back on his word. But the US wasn&rsquo;t an option at the time of him saying that</p>

<p>edit: correcting myself, sorry I misremembered. Embiid never said he planned to play for France. He did the naturalization process and Boris Diaw said Embiid wanted to. He got French citizenship then got American citizenship shortly after. He was likely in the process with both simultaneously to get options and just got French first.</p>

<p>Secondly, Nigeria didn’t qualify in basketball when Hakeem played in the Olympics.</p>

<p>Thirdly, by the time he completed in the Olympics in ‘96 he had lived in America for 13 years. He’s now been here for over 40. He has been a citizen for over a quarter of a century. He is American. Basically the only thing Hakeem can’t Constitutionally do that a citizen by birth can is be President or Vice President.</p>

He can&rsquo;t win in the court of Reddit/social media opinion.</p>

<p>Not to mention that Americans are bitching about this, which blows my fucking mind. The team is stacked and they were able to add one of the most skilled big men of all-time, shouldn&rsquo;t that be a good thing since it gives the USA an even better chance of winning gold? Why do people want him to join the competition?</p>

<p>I take it on u/Choice_Mail comment</p>

<p>«After discussion with the French Basketball Federation, my choice has now been made. I wish to take steps to obtain French naturalization and thus be able to be selected with the Blues. I therefore do not wish to play for any other national team»</p>

<p>And iirc, Vincent Collet( French NT coach ) had a little interview where he appears to be pissed at the Embiid stuff and he basically said that he wasted his time with this.</p>

<p>Now, Embiid made his choice and he had the right to do whatever he want. The Cameroon thing is irrelevant, not even an option. People want to clown him.</p>

He has never played for them. Unless he&rsquo;s posturing by saying he would, the fact that he hasn&rsquo;t adds even more credence to talk of them not paying for his insurance.</p>

<p>If they would pay his insurance, I think he would play for them. And if they could pay for his insurance, they would likely pay for Embiid&rsquo;s and there&rsquo;s a chance he would also play for them. But it seems like playing for Cameroon wasn&rsquo;t even an option for Emiid</p>

But for the people measuring how much ____ nationality somebody is, he&rsquo;s infinitely more American because he&rsquo;s lived here most of his life. Him getting French citizenship is exactly what that segment accuses him of, playing for a country just to play in the Olympics and to get a medal</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s been in the US since he was a kid. His child is an American. His life is here. Cameroon? Yeah that&rsquo;s his home country and that&rsquo;s a place he could reasonably play for of course.</p>

      <label for="lcmbo53" class="commentText"><p>Australia has had issues with player insurance in the past. Andrew Bogut has stated that he always used to pay his own insurance, since Australia couldn’t afford it. He did so because he <em>wanted</em> to represent his home country, and because he knew that by having Australia’s highest profile, at the time, NBA athlete representing his country would increase the profile of the sport in the country, which has encouraged more kids to take up the sport. </p>

<p>Embiid might never win a medal if he were to represent Cameroon, but he would help to build the countries basketball program so that they might be in the mix 10 or 15 years from now.</p>

      <label for="lclsnmf" class="commentText"><p>He can buy his own insurance he’s rich as Fuck</p>

<p>Honestly he’s never been committed to international play at all</p>

<p>He’s never participated in a USA game before and still hasn’t</p>

<p>He really isn’t committed to this he’s going to go to the Olympics play for a couple weeks than retire from international play win or lose</p>

<p>So why would he go through the hardship of Cameroon when it would take years of commitment he would need to show up for qualifiers for FIBA WC because that’s the main process for Qualifying for the Olympics than he would have to do a lot of work to structure Cameroon basketball and would need to be a very active player and committed to the team (which he never has been)</p>

<p>So what’s to lose shows up has everything taken care of just like his time at Philly and gets to go to Paris for two weeks</p>

<p>It just sucks because the tournament and basketball from
Africa would be better if he was more committed to international play</p>

      <label for="lclz1lp" class="commentText"><p>It simply boils down to him joining the <em>clearly</em> best team in any given international tournament for the majority of people, we all made/make fun of Durant for joining GSW and this feels like the international equivalent. The France point, I think, mostly stems from people wanting to have more compeitive parity and not necessarily about being French or America, idk</p>

<p>Personally, I think it&rsquo;s important for smaller or less developed countries to have their local stars represent them during international tournaments. It motivates more passion for the sport, it inspires future generations to pursue the sport, lets you celebrate nationalistic pride through sports, etc. Of courise, you can do all of these things without representing your country internationally but doing so adds another layer. Look at an international team like Morocco in soccer where the majority of their squad was born and plays outside of Morocco but still chose to represent Morocco internationally. The financial point you bring up is really important, something I hadn&rsquo;t considered either, and is probably the best argument for Embiid choosing the US over Cameroon. I just find it a bit sad when a player from a smaller country goes on to become a star but chooses (for whatever reasons that might be) to represent another country - underdog stories and all that</p>

      <label for="lclpbr8" class="commentText"><p>He is from Cameroon, which is his &ldquo;real&rdquo; country. He had announced for France so that was considered the team he was going to play for a long time. USA had a need at Center (with France being a logjam situation) and then he suddenly decided playing for USA sounded like a good idea.</p>

<p>He treated International Basketball like Free Agency, it&rsquo;s fine to call him out for it. Yes, he&rsquo;s a naturalized citizen and eligible to play for USA, and heck, at this point, he&rsquo;s lived half his life in the USA so it&rsquo;s not even that egregious compared to the guys who play for a team representing a country where their great-great grandmother was born. But it&rsquo;s fair to call him out on it.</p>

He&rsquo;s from Cameroon, that&rsquo;s where he was born and raised before he began his pursuit of a pro basketball career which brought him to the United States. I put &ldquo;real&rdquo; in quotations fwiw to note the fluidity of a thing like national citizenship&hellip; and I would know, like Embiid, I am a naturalized U.S. Citizen who moved to the U.S. for educational/career reasons and have stayed ever since. Nobody has asked me to represent any country in anything, but I would still feel a bit odd not rooting for Canada at the Olympics (Embiid and I basically moved to the U.S. at around the same time).</p>
