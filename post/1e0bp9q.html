      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1e0bp9q/a_note_on_embiids_national_team_eligibility/"><p>A note on Embiid&rsquo;s national team eligibility</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>It&rsquo;s bothered me the discourse that there&rsquo;s been about Embiid playing for the USA and felt the need to address some things as most NBA fans don&rsquo;t follow international basketball that much.</p>

<p>First, I know rational people are fine with it and understand it&rsquo;s his personal choice, yadda, yadda. But I understand people having their own opinions even if they acknowledge it&rsquo;s his choice.</p>

<p>But now to address his options.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s medal chasing, he should&rsquo;ve played for France.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>Embiid is not French, has never lived in France, and has no french connection outside of Cameroon previously being a French territory so it&rsquo;s a Francophone country. Embiid playing for France would&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;medal chasing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gained French citizenship through naturalization as a person of &ldquo;exceptional interest.&rdquo; Embiid playing for France would be just like Rondae Hollis-Jefferson playing for Jordan, a player with no connection just naturalized simply to play basketball. FIBA rules allows countries to naturalize one player for their team. He is infinitely more American than he is French.</p>

<p><strong>Why not Cameroon?</strong></p>

<p>To frame things, fellow Cameroonian Pascal Siakam has also never played for Cameroon. Siakam has indicated he would love to but never has. Why hasn&rsquo;t Siakam played for them despite being vocal about being open to it?</p>

<p>For people who don&rsquo;t know, when NBA players play for their national teams, the country&rsquo;s federation has to pay for insurance in case the player gets injured while on duty. If a player gets injured, they will have to pay their NBA salary while they&rsquo;re injured and also potential damages to their career. And we all know how expensive NBA contracts are so the insurance would be pretty hefty for it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not unexpected for the less powerful basketball countries to not call up NBA players because they can&rsquo;t afford to pay the insurance for their contract. There&rsquo;s <em>a ton</em> of Nigerian (born and raised or by ancestry) NBA players but the best ones haven&rsquo;t always played for them. I remember very clearly Festus Ezeli and Al-Farouq Aminu couldn&rsquo;t play in one Olympics because Nigeria wouldn&rsquo;t pay for the insurance. (Nigeria has seemed to be much more invested in recent years)</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s previously been reports that Cameroon can&rsquo;t afford Siakam. There&rsquo;s also been other reasons thrown about but unless you think it&rsquo;s purely posturing by Siakam saying he would, it would seem more to be that he can&rsquo;t and that would be the reason why he can&rsquo;t. And when you add in that Embiid makes more and is a much higher injury risk, I&rsquo;d be stunned if they could afford it.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> not french, Cameroon almost certainly can&rsquo;t pay his insurance</p>

      <label for="lcm5iuc" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think anyone would have cared if he went directly to Team USA. It&rsquo;s just his indecision and seemingly doing whatever the f he wants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know your sincere interest in basketball and its development and, in general, in the sport that honors France,&rdquo; begins the document made public by &lsquo;RMC Sport&rsquo;. &ldquo;After discussions with the French Basketball Federation, I have already made my decision. I would like to take the steps to obtain French nationality and thus be selected by Les Blues. I do not wish to play for any other national team. I have sent a dossier to the Ministry of the Interior and Foreign Affairs,&rdquo; the center confessed in his letter.</p>

<p>Embiid said that &ldquo;it would be an immense honor to join the French team to participate in the next major international competitions, first and foremost the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. I measure the solemnity of my application, what it represents, what it means, but also, in certain aspects, its duration and its complexity with respect to the usual criteria for the granting of nationality&rdquo;. Directly, the Sixers player asked Macron &ldquo;for his support to support these initiatives, support without which they will not succeed. Please accept, Mr. President, the assurances of my highest consideration.&rdquo;</p>

Obviously the answer to that is because everybody hates Embiid. But lets say this same thing happened with steph curry in his prime or some shit. Everybody would be more than happy to accept him on their home country&rsquo;s team and would get mad that this player, who has no connection to another country, chose to play for them instead. And the whole part about the gaining citizenship over there would be completely ignored because it&rsquo;s all about narrative.</p>

It isn’t common for France to naturalize players in sports, save maybe rugby where it’s more common across all countries. So I think it was more a case of “oh, one of the best players on the planet wants to play for us, nice!”. Only the US could really turn down a player this good because of fit. There was already some pushback in France on whether he should be naturalised or not precisely because he has few links to France.</p>

Not the other way around.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not free agency.<br>
National Teams don&rsquo;t exactly go around asking foreign players:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello sir, excuse us, we like your game and have an open position in our team for you.<br>
Would you be interested in another citizenship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>PS: don&rsquo;t get me wrong, that scenario has certainly happened more than a few times, albeit, not with this exact phrasing.<br>
But it&rsquo;s not how it usually works, nor how it is supposed to.</p>

Not that they should be expected to in order to avoid criticism but it would be a pretty great gesture if some of these NBA players from poor countries put up their own money to play for their Olympic team. Joel is one of my least favorite NBA players and may even top that list, but I would give him massive props if he did something like that. I may even give him a begrudging slow clap.</p>

      <label for="lcmut3g" class="commentText"><p>Yes this was a very big deal at the time (via La Última Copa podcast), and young Messi chose to represent Rosario/Argentina despite what some might say strong pressure on a kid to play for Spain. I imagine it was a tough decision, as the son of an Argentine immigrant it’s very much part of the reason he’s treated like a “God” there, especially considering general opinion of European soccer being better/higher class than Latin America.</p>

<p>Embiid on the other hand ) is a good American.</p>

      <label for="lclwdmk" class="commentText"><p>What&rsquo;s funny is that if Embiid did play for France and they ended up winning gold, these same people always hating on him would say he got lucky because Wemby and Gobert were his teammates. He can&rsquo;t win in the court of Reddit/social media opinion.</p>

<p>Not to mention that Americans are bitching about this, which blows my fucking mind. The team is stacked and they were able to add one of the most skilled big men of all-time, shouldn&rsquo;t that be a good thing since it gives the USA an even better chance of winning gold? Why do people want him to join the competition?</p>

      <label for="lcmbo53" class="commentText"><p>Australia has had issues with player insurance in the past. Andrew Bogut has stated that he always used to pay his own insurance, since Australia couldn’t afford it. He did so because he <em>wanted</em> to represent his home country, and because he knew that by having Australia’s highest profile, at the time, NBA athlete representing his country would increase the profile of the sport in the country, which has encouraged more kids to take up the sport. </p>

<p>Embiid might never win a medal if he were to represent Cameroon, but he would help to build the countries basketball program so that they might be in the mix 10 or 15 years from now.</p>

<p>Embiid is completely eligible to play for the USA but people just think that he would be more of a national hero if he play for Cameroon and help them get some succes on the court.</p>

<p>I take it on u/Choice_Mail comment</p>

<p>«After discussion with the French Basketball Federation, my choice has now been made. I wish to take steps to obtain French naturalization and thus be able to be selected with the Blues. I therefore do not wish to play for any other national team»</p>

<p>And iirc, Vincent Collet( French NT coach ) had a little interview where he appears to be pissed at the Embiid stuff and he basically said that he wasted his time with this.</p>

<p>Now, Embiid made his choice and he had the right to do whatever he want. The Cameroon thing is irrelevant, not even an option. People want to clown him.</p>

<p>I can only think what people would say if some South American soccer player wrote a personal letter to Biden, got US citizenship, and then got a German citizenship and played for Germany like two years later.</p>

<p>This is just snake behaviour. Making a promise and then betraying their good will is clearly not cool. I can feel the frustration of the French. If he never wrote it, then this isn&rsquo;t big deal.</p>

      <label for="lcmkj0c" class="commentText"><p>People flip countries all the time when it comes to the Olympics.  There are people who moved out the US and to a smaller country because there is too much competition here to make the Olympic teams.  People actually do it all the time and from all over the globe.  If your native country is stacked in a competition you want to participate in, you move to a new country that isn’t stacked and make the team.  It’s an incredibly common practice.  There are even guys have represented several different countries at different Olympics.  Embiid choosing US is the least egregious offense by comparison.  And for the most part, it’s a non issue no matter what he reason is.</p>

<p>But as a Sixer fan, it would be hilarious if US doesn’t win gold.  In fact, a part of me is routing against them lol.</p>

Basically he was chasing european citizenship to be able to travel with a greater ease and gave nothing in return. He was given that citizenship for basketball purposes. If he&rsquo;s not playing then he should just renounce the citizenship.because France got absolutely nothing in return. He&rsquo;s not chasing medals he&rsquo;s chasing free border passing through Europe.</p>

They certainly can’t afford to pay anyone. I just like watching good basketball and Embiid is undeniably a good basketball player so, I’m happy we have him.</p>

<p>Also, him playing for France is such an American take because it makes no sense after one second of thought, but people here hate being wrong since they make their mind up in a half second.</p>

So what that tells me is America has a huge advantage with the amount of player contracts they can insure. And even if countries can flip the bill, do you think the Spurs want Wemby out there? Insurance or otherwise&hellip;probably not.</p>

<p>Why these Olympic teams should be nothing but college and high school kids, you&rsquo;ll still get the chance to rep your nation. Your time should be short, NBA titles are far more important. We all know where the best talent in the world comes from in refrence to basketball&hellip;</p>

<p>The whole process is so weird considering the USA can essentially lock players out of playing for their countries by making them &ldquo;unaffordable&rdquo; through what I would call an insurance loophole.</p>

<p>French fans still have legit beef because he 100% lied to them (in a letter to the president lmao) and went back on his word. It would have been weird for him to play for them frankly buy at the end of the day homeboy still lied and went back ok his word for personal benefit so he gonna get a lot of well deserved boos. It&rsquo;s how the game works sometimes.</p>

      <label for="lclpkl6" class="commentText"><p>I bring up Siakam present the insurance aspect of the situation. Siakam has said multiple times that he would love to play for Cameroon. He has never played for them. Unless he&rsquo;s posturing by saying he would, the fact that he hasn&rsquo;t adds even more credence to talk of them not paying for his insurance.</p>

<p>If they would pay his insurance, I think he would play for them. And if they could pay for his insurance, they would likely pay for Embiid&rsquo;s and there&rsquo;s a chance he would also play for them. But it seems like playing for Cameroon wasn&rsquo;t even an option for Emiid</p>

But for the people measuring how much ____ nationality somebody is, he&rsquo;s infinitely more American because he&rsquo;s lived here most of his life. Him getting French citizenship is exactly what that segment accuses him of, playing for a country just to play in the Olympics and to get a medal</p>
