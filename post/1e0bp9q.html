      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1e0bp9q/a_note_on_embiids_national_team_eligibility/"><p>A note on Embiid&rsquo;s national team eligibility</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>It&rsquo;s bothered me the discourse that there&rsquo;s been about Embiid playing for the USA and felt the need to address some things as most NBA fans don&rsquo;t follow international basketball that much.</p>

<p>First, I know rational people are fine with it and understand it&rsquo;s his personal choice, yadda, yadda. But I understand people having their own opinions even if they acknowledge it&rsquo;s his choice.</p>

<p>But now to address his options.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s medal chasing, he should&rsquo;ve played for France.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>Embiid is not French, has never lived in France, and has no french connection outside of Cameroon previously being a French territory so it&rsquo;s a Francophone country. Embiid playing for France would&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;medal chasing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gained French citizenship through naturalization as a person of &ldquo;exceptional interest.&rdquo; Embiid playing for France would be just like Rondae Hollis-Jefferson playing for Jordan, a player with no connection just naturalized simply to play basketball. FIBA rules allows countries to naturalize one player for their team. He is infinitely more American than he is French.</p>

<p><strong>Why not Cameroon?</strong></p>

<p>To frame things, fellow Cameroonian Pascal Siakam has also never played for Cameroon. Siakam has indicated he would love to but never has. Why hasn&rsquo;t Siakam played for them despite being vocal about being open to it?</p>

<p>For people who don&rsquo;t know, when NBA players play for their national teams, the country&rsquo;s federation has to pay for insurance in case the player gets injured while on duty. If a player gets injured, they will have to pay their NBA salary while they&rsquo;re injured and also potential damages to their career. And we all know how expensive NBA contracts are so the insurance would be pretty hefty for it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not unexpected for the less powerful basketball countries to not call up NBA players because they can&rsquo;t afford to pay the insurance for their contract. There&rsquo;s <em>a ton</em> of Nigerian (born and raised or by ancestry) NBA players but the best ones haven&rsquo;t always played for them. I remember very clearly Festus Ezeli and Al-Farouq Aminu couldn&rsquo;t play in one Olympics because Nigeria wouldn&rsquo;t pay for the insurance. (Nigeria has seemed to be much more invested in recent years)</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s previously been reports that Cameroon can&rsquo;t afford Siakam. There&rsquo;s also been other reasons thrown about but unless you think it&rsquo;s purely posturing by Siakam saying he would, it would seem more to be that he can&rsquo;t and that would be the reason why he can&rsquo;t. And when you add in that Embiid makes more and is a much higher injury risk, I&rsquo;d be stunned if they could afford it.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> not french, Cameroon almost certainly can&rsquo;t pay his insurance</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know your sincere interest in basketball and its development and, in general, in the sport that honors France,&rdquo; begins the document made public by &lsquo;RMC Sport&rsquo;. &ldquo;After discussions with the French Basketball Federation, I have already made my decision. I would like to take the steps to obtain French nationality and thus be selected by Les Blues. I do not wish to play for any other national team. I have sent a dossier to the Ministry of the Interior and Foreign Affairs,&rdquo; the center confessed in his letter.</p>

<p>Embiid said that &ldquo;it would be an immense honor to join the French team to participate in the next major international competitions, first and foremost the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. I measure the solemnity of my application, what it represents, what it means, but also, in certain aspects, its duration and its complexity with respect to the usual criteria for the granting of nationality&rdquo;. Directly, the Sixers player asked Macron &ldquo;for his support to support these initiatives, support without which they will not succeed. Please accept, Mr. President, the assurances of my highest consideration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You mean anyone that thinks he shouldn&rsquo;t play for you just isn&rsquo;t American.</p>

<p>International sports have rules about not switching teams after you&rsquo;ve represented a nation because randomly switching teams completely defeats the whole point. Just because embiid found a loophole by never actually representing Cameroon doesn&rsquo;t mean he isn&rsquo;t doing the exact same thing in spirit. People that are looking at his situation and thinking &ldquo;well that&rsquo;s not how it&rsquo;s supposed to work&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t idiots just because it leaves a bitter taste in their mouth.</p>

<p>Embiid is Cameroonian and for basically his entire life Cameroon is the only nation he was eligible to represent. Going around at the age of 30 after you&rsquo;ve played most of your professional career and begging better teams to make you eligible so you can be carried to the first victory of your career is frankly embarrassing and shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed just because you&rsquo;ve refused to suit up for your actual nation.</p>

It isn’t common for France to naturalize players in sports, save maybe rugby where it’s more common across all countries. So I think it was more a case of “oh, one of the best players on the planet wants to play for us, nice!”. Only the US could really turn down a player this good because of fit. There was already some pushback in France on whether he should be naturalised or not precisely because he has few links to France.</p>

Would you be interested in another citizenship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>PS: don&rsquo;t get me wrong, that scenario has certainly happened more than a few times, albeit, not with this exact phrasing.<br>
But it&rsquo;s not how it usually works, nor how it is supposed to.</p>

<p>it’s like US/mexico soccer. Mexican americans are often needed to choose whether to play for US or mexico. some choose mexico even though they live in the US because of their heritage and some choose to play for the US because although they are of mexican heritage they grew up in the US.</p>

      <label for="lcmut3g" class="commentText"><p>Yes this was a very big deal at the time (via La Última Copa podcast), and young Messi chose to represent Rosario/Argentina despite what some might say strong pressure on a kid to play for Spain. I imagine it was a tough decision, as the son of an Argentine immigrant it’s very much part of the reason he’s treated like a “God” there, especially considering general opinion of European soccer being better/higher class than Latin America.</p>

He can&rsquo;t win in the court of Reddit/social media opinion.</p>

<p>Not to mention that Americans are bitching about this, which blows my fucking mind. The team is stacked and they were able to add one of the most skilled big men of all-time, shouldn&rsquo;t that be a good thing since it gives the USA an even better chance of winning gold? Why do people want him to join the competition?</p>

<p>I take it on u/Choice_Mail comment</p>

<p>«After discussion with the French Basketball Federation, my choice has now been made. I wish to take steps to obtain French naturalization and thus be able to be selected with the Blues. I therefore do not wish to play for any other national team»</p>

<p>And iirc, Vincent Collet( French NT coach ) had a little interview where he appears to be pissed at the Embiid stuff and he basically said that he wasted his time with this.</p>

<p>Now, Embiid made his choice and he had the right to do whatever he want. The Cameroon thing is irrelevant, not even an option. People want to clown him.</p>

Andrew Bogut has stated that he always used to pay his own insurance, since Australia couldn’t afford it. He did so because he <em>wanted</em> to represent his home country, and because he knew that by having Australia’s highest profile, at the time, NBA athlete representing his country would increase the profile of the sport in the country, which has encouraged more kids to take up the sport. </p>

<p>Embiid might never win a medal if he were to represent Cameroon, but he would help to build the countries basketball program so that they might be in the mix 10 or 15 years from now.</p>

      <label for="lcmkj0c" class="commentText"><p>People flip countries all the time when it comes to the Olympics.  There are people who moved out the US and to a smaller country because there is too much competition here to make the Olympic teams.  People actually do it all the time and from all over the globe.  If your native country is stacked in a competition you want to participate in, you move to a new country that isn’t stacked and make the team.  It’s an incredibly common practice.  There are even guys have represented several different countries at different Olympics.  Embiid choosing US is the least egregious offense by comparison.  And for the most part, it’s a non issue no matter what he reason is.</p>

<p>But as a Sixer fan, it would be hilarious if US doesn’t win gold.  In fact, a part of me is routing against them lol.</p>

They certainly can’t afford to pay anyone. I just like watching good basketball and Embiid is undeniably a good basketball player so, I’m happy we have him.</p>

<p>Also, him playing for France is such an American take because it makes no sense after one second of thought, but people here hate being wrong since they make their mind up in a half second.</p>

      <label for="lcmo8v8" class="commentText"><p>He gained his French citizenship as a person of &ldquo;exceptional interest&rdquo; just to not have any interest. Basically he was chasing european citizenship to be able to travel with a greater ease and gave nothing in return. He was given that citizenship for basketball purposes. If he&rsquo;s not playing then he should just renounce the citizenship.because France got absolutely nothing in return. He&rsquo;s not chasing medals he&rsquo;s chasing free border passing through Europe.</p>

The guy is as American as it gets. We&rsquo;re a country of immigrants and he&rsquo;s a legal immigrant who is proud to represent the country he worked to get into. It&rsquo;s text book American Dream. It&rsquo;s kinda weird how people think sometimes.</p>

      <label for="lclpkl6" class="commentText"><p>I bring up Siakam present the insurance aspect of the situation. Siakam has said multiple times that he would love to play for Cameroon. He has never played for them. Unless he&rsquo;s posturing by saying he would, the fact that he hasn&rsquo;t adds even more credence to talk of them not paying for his insurance.</p>

<p>If they would pay his insurance, I think he would play for them. And if they could pay for his insurance, they would likely pay for Embiid&rsquo;s and there&rsquo;s a chance he would also play for them. But it seems like playing for Cameroon wasn&rsquo;t even an option for Emiid</p>

      <label for="lclpyni" class="commentText"><p>I reference it that way because people saying he shouldn&rsquo;t play for the US because he&rsquo;s &ldquo;not American.&rdquo; Yes, he has French citizenship so he&rsquo;s French. But for the people measuring how much ____ nationality somebody is, he&rsquo;s infinitely more American because he&rsquo;s lived here most of his life. Him getting French citizenship is exactly what that segment accuses him of, playing for a country just to play in the Olympics and to get a medal</p>

<p>In his letter he states: &ldquo;Also, after discussions with the French Basketball Federation, my choice has now been made. I would like to take the steps to obtain French naturalization and thus be eligible for selection with the Blues. I, therefore, do not wish to play for any other national team. I have sent a file to this effect to the Ministry of the Interior and Foreign Affairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is just snake behaviour. Making a promise and then betraying their good will is clearly not cool. I can feel the frustration of the French. If he never wrote it, then this isn&rsquo;t big deal.</p>

I dont care about him playing for usa BUT a few yrs ago he was talking how it is his choice to pllay for france and even wrote a letter if i remember correctly. Then when oppurtunity came for him to play for USA NT he decided for them and dont act like we all dont know why. It is easiest way to win something and that is all.</p>

<p>You can argue however you want and sure ya’ll are right, but it’s still hilarious that you guys are waving off this man LYING to the SITTING PRESIDENT of France as “he changed his mind. What’s wrong about that?” Reddit truly is a bubble.</p>

<p>Lastly, at least for ME (I don’t want people getting mad cause it’s MY opinion), it’s so freaking lame he chose to play for you guys. Anyway, congrats in advance on the Gold Medal.</p>

      <label for="lcnj13r" class="commentText"><p>So, a little devil’s advocate on the French thing — from a French perspective, Embiid is technically as French as he is American, and culturally they consider that he should be much more French.  Cameroon (at least the part Embiid is from) was an former French colony.   For some of the French people, the independence of former colonies is sort of an unfortunate technicality.  To them, Embiid is French, and therefore a traitor.</p>

<p>Now, for my part, I don’t care.  He’s an American citizen, and that makes him as American as anyone on earth.  I’m just saying, the French don’t feel like that.  I expect any game he plays against them to be a little ugly, crowd-wise.</p>

      <label for="lcnoh6n" class="commentText"><p>The majority aren’t commenting on it because of Embiid’s identity. For basketball reasons people often talk about KD’s hardest road and clown on him, this is that but also worse. Like there’s no other equivalent in sports of how big of a bitch move it is. I’d applaud him for not playing for France, not representing Cameroon sucks but just say it’s for injury concerns not that they can’t compete, it‘s the turning around (at 30 as an MVP and top three player in the world) and playing for USA of all NTs he gets called out for.</p>
