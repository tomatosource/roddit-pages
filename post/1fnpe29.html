<p>So the prompt is - who do you want on ball facing a 1-4 iso flat set - Coop is an all world defender but maybe not in that situation</p>

People claim the players these days are not the best scorers because the rules favor offense which makes it easier to score. But if it&rsquo;s easier to score now that means it&rsquo;s harder to defend and if it was harder to score back then that means it was easier to defend. But nobody has that same energy when talking about the best defenders. Shouldn&rsquo;t it default to someone like kawhi who was able to be a lock down defender in an era with no hand checking and less physicality allowed?</p>

      <label for="lokvww5" class="commentText"><p>Whether it’s offense or defense players should be judged by their achievements relative to their peers in the era they actually played.</p>

<p>It’s possible the old physicality and lack of load management would’ve made Kawhi’s injury issues much worse and diminished his impact. It’s possible Pippen would’ve been even more dominant relative to other perimeter defenders in the pace and space era.</p>

<p>Every player is a product of the era in which they came up and is forced to adapt their play to the conditions in place then. That doesn’t mean we can’t compare, just that a 10x all-defense player from a previous era should be presumed to have a similar impact if you gave them modern training, rules, equipment, medical treatment, etc.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Exactly. A lot people simply don&rsquo;t understand the concept of greatness. There is way too much hypothesising in these types of debates and almost always it is impossible to prove the points they are trying to make. Greatness is a comparison of success against one&rsquo;s peers, not a perceived success or lack of success a player would have had in another era. You can only subjectively judge a player on what he did in his era and how dominant he was vs his own peers. What accolades did he win that players today can win and what did he do on the court from a statistical perspective that can be directly compared to modern players. Everything else is guess work.</p>

      <label for="lokurjl" class="commentText"><p>What logic is this? How does being easier to score equal harder to defend? That’s just crap you made up. It’s all era based. Players today can’t navigate screens, players in the past didn’t have to close out at the 3. Defenders just exert energy at different scenarios as the game evolves. Stop just buying what you are fed and understand the game</p>

I suppose it’s possible that the reigning back to back Fmvp, who had also won 4 out of the previous 5mvps at that point, was scared of a 3rd year player. Or he was mad that he missed a free throw in a crucial finals game and his ft routine got interrupted 🤷🏾‍♂️ You can believe whichever you want.</p>

<p>They didn&rsquo;t play the Spurs the year prior. This was in 2013, the first time he ever faced Kawhi in the playoffs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and averaged 28ppg on great efficiency in this series</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The clip was from the first half of game 5. Kawhi had him in jail the first 3 games, holding him to 17 ppg on 39% shooting.</p>

<p>Over the whole series Bron averaged 25ppg on 53% TS after averaging 28ppg on 64% TS in the regular season.</p>

He said 1-4 flat which is an offensive iso set where a single defender would be getting no help until they are basically at the rim. Goal is to put your best scorer/playmaker on an island and let him cook. You don’t see it a lot because screens and switches are so important to getting mismatches now. But back in the day dudes were just going heads up man to man. Maybe I’m wrong and I read the prompt with bias.</p>

      <label for="lokoj3a" class="commentText"><p>Joe Dumars imo is the second (#1 pre injury Grant Hill) most all around, well rounded and complete player in my lifetime as a die-hard Pistons fan since the early 80&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>He could do everything well and was extremely consistent, effective, and reliable at all times; while also possessing super elite basketball IQ and feel for the game on both offense and defense.</p>

<p>A true two-way Hall of Fame player.</p>

      <label for="lojxcaf" class="commentText"><p>The easy answer certainly feels like The Glove, but I think we may be overlooking how insane an on-ball defender prime, locked in Ron Artest, was. I remember him guarding the ball, where you would basically be worried he&rsquo;d take a knee to the chest. His defensive stance was so aggressive.</p>

<p>Wait I might be misunderstanding the question here. He said “guard taking the ball up” so now I’m confused.</p>

<p>MJ struggled to defend smaller guards and bigger forwards. Luckily he didn&rsquo;t have either of those match ups a lot but there were times where he did and it was obvious he struggled with the quicker hands of smaller guards and the power of bigger forwards.</p>

This is despite Scottie Pippen being on the court as well. I can&rsquo;t remember who said that (may have been Kenny Smith) but it was said in a very recent interview.<br>
People just don&rsquo;t want to throw his name in every discussion because they are either LeBron stans who refuse to ever talk positively about Jordan or they are hesitant because they know they will get downvoted by those same stans. Fact is that he absolutely deserves to be in this discussion.</p>

      <label for="lok0kcd" class="commentText"><p>Well this is really 2 questions. We can&rsquo;t really lump the best perimeter defenders and the best 1-4 defenders ever into the same question since for a wide majority of NBA history the 4 simply wasn&rsquo;t a perimeter position.</p>

<p>For the first question, the best perimeter defenders in NBA history are probably Pippen, Kawhi, and Moncrief. At least those 3 had the highest defensive peaks for a perimeter player and could all defend 1-3 very well but all 3 were going to be destroyed by a traditional 4 as they had nowhere near the bulk.</p>

<p>If we go the best 1-4 defender it&rsquo;s probably peak-Lebron in Miami. He could only really defend the SG and SF consistently but he was big and fast enough that he could at least be switched onto 4&rsquo;s and 1&rsquo;s and not get embarrassed.</p>

      <label for="lok47vh" class="commentText"><p>Shoutout to KG for big guys, minnesota used to use him at the top of a 1-3-1 zone and ballhandlers hated it. KG was so good at switching and bumping perimeter players for just a few seconds to shut down whatever action they were setting up.</p>

<p>He played the 3 a good bit those first few years, and would switch onto wing scorers like kobe and tmac quite a bit (moreso tmac because the magic didn&rsquo;t have shaq as well lol)</p>

<p>Even past his prime, watch those lakers-celtics finals. Kobe basically only attacks as far away from KG as possible</p>

<p>Hakeem and David Robinson too, Joakim Noah was a beast out there as well</p>

<p>Gerald Wallce deserves a mention</p>

<p>and Artest should be a tippy top answer for as well, he was about as shutdown as it gets on the perimeter, very similar to kawhi</p>

<p>yet there is one name, who can defend anyone on the court from any era. peak LeBron James. 1 to 5. anyone from any era.</p>

      <label for="loms2ka" class="commentText"><p>KC Jones deserves to be mentioned. He may not have had the size of some other guys, but he was one of the greatest perimeter defenders of all time and really pioneered the role. He was a huge part of a bunch of Celtic championships.</p>

<p>Dennis Johnson was one of the most feared defenders of his day. Larry Bird said he may have been the best player he ever played with. Defense was a huge part of that. He was also a multiple-time champion, with the Sonics and Celtics.</p>

<p>Michael Cooper was recently inducted into the Hall of Fame due mainly to his exceptional defensive abilities. Numerous legends have called him one of the all-time great defenders, and he was crucial to the Showtime Lakers dynasty.</p>

<p>Sidney &ldquo;The Squid&rdquo; Moncrief was an extraordinary defender who was named Defensive Player of the Year in both &lsquo;83 and &lsquo;84 and played with incredible on-court awareness and tenacity.</p>

<p>Norm Van Lier was one of the toughest defenders in the league and a Bulls legend before the glory days of Jordan. He had great basketball IQ and played with tremendous intensity and work ethic.</p>

<p>Mo Cheeks was the starting point guard for the great 80s Sixers teams. He was an excellent defender and leader on the floor, always a threat to come up with a steal.</p>

<p>These are just a handful of names. Not necessarily &ldquo;the greatest.&rdquo; But worthy of being mentioned in a discussion like this.</p>
