      <p>Few off the top of my head are probably,</p>

<p>* James Harden&rsquo;s run from a couple years back where he was averaging 40+ ppg for like 4-5 months</p>

<p>* Carmelo Anthonys rookie year performance is probably a top 5-10 all time rookie performance and he had a genuine argument for winning ROTY over Lebron who similarly had an amazing but more well known rookie year.</p>

<p>* Devin Booker in 2023 play-offs was putting on one of the statistically greatest showings of offense in play-off history during the 10 games before he was eliminated but only get remembered for the poor elimination game.</p>

<p>Isaiah&rsquo;s performance may have been better, but that&rsquo;s not what OP was asking for. I didn&rsquo;t base my answer off which performance is better, I based it off which performance is less discussed.</p>

<p>Everyone remembers his Sister dying and that he dropped 53 points, nobody really remembers Wall dropping <sup>40</sup>&frasl;<sub>13</sub> in a losing effort.</p>

<p>1999 NBA Finals (Spurs vs. Knicks) Outcome: Spurs win 4-1</p>

<p>Summary: Tim Duncan, in just his second season, led the Spurs to their first-ever NBA championship. He was dominant throughout.</p>

<p>2003 NBA Finals (Spurs vs. Nets) Outcome: Spurs win 4-2</p>

<p>Summary: Duncan delivered one of the most impressive Finals performances in history, nearly achieving a quadruple-double in the clinching Game 6 (21 points, 20 rebounds, 10 assists, and 8 blocks).</p>

<p>2005 NBA Finals (Spurs vs. Pistons)Outcome: Spurs win 4-3</p>

<p>Summary: A grueling seven-game series against the defending champs, Duncan&rsquo;s consistency and leadership were pivotal. He averaged 20.6/14/2Blks points.</p>

<p>2007 NBA Finals (Spurs vs. Cavaliers)Outcome: Spurs win 4-0</p>

<p>Summary: The Spurs swept the Cleveland Cavaliers, with Duncan&rsquo;s interior defense holding it down while Tony Parker cooked</p>

<p>That dude came out and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFsVC3DpnkY" target="_blank">scored 27 points in the first quarter alone</a> on 11-of-11 shooting and 3-of-3 from downtown.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a game I often recommend to people who are open to enjoying &lsquo;90s basketball but just don&rsquo;t know where to dive in. If you know Chris Webber, Chris Mullin, Latrell Sprewell, Charles Barkley, etc., it&rsquo;s a pretty fun ride, especially the aforementioned first quarter.</p>

<p>If you just go for rookie seasons overall, naturally the guys that came into the league after a few years in college will always have the edge. David Robinson averaged 24.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub>.0/2.0/1.<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>.9 on 60% TS as a rookie, it&rsquo;s a completely different reality.</p>

That game was one of the all time great playoff performances and while all the talking head media morons have been disrespecting him by trying to argue over who’s team it is between him and JB, criticizing his playoff scoring, and obsessing over his DNP’s in the olympics all i can think of is that fucking game 7. The dude had just turned 25 at that time and put his team on his back and completely obliterated my sixers.

<p>That series is genuinely one of the greatest series of all time and it’s a shame it doesn’t get talked about much. I once saw someone say, “CP3 doesn’t have any legacy moments people talk about,” and everyone agreed. He doesn’t have legacy moments because people ignore all of his.</p>

<p>He dropped 20 points in the 4Q to eliminate the Jazz in 2018, caught fire in the second half to have 40 points and beat the Clippers in G6 2021, there were also a ton of clutch shots he had for the Thunder as they nearly upset the Rockets in 2020 (after trading CP3 for Westbrook).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I know 2016 is his legacy defining championship but in my eyes that dagger at the end of Game 7 holds just as much meaning to the overall arc of his career: A shot on a part of the court that teams, including the Spurs in the 2007 Finals, had routinely given up to over the years because it was his weakness. LeBron improved his game so much that at the most critical moment in one of the biggest games of his life he calmly took that shot because he knew it would be there and made it with ease to win the championship.</p>

      <label for="lixknmn" class="commentText"><p>What’s fun about that series was his jumper looked sus as hell and the first 3 games you’d think it was shaping up to be another 2011 finals for him (granted he wasn’t horrible in game 1 of the ‘13 finals). He was getting outscored by Danny Green. The games 4-7 he averages like 32ppg and it all comes together with him lighting the Spurs up by hitting the shots that they’re choosing to give him in the biggest game of the year.</p>

<p>On another note, Battier is a good choice for this thread as well. 18pts in game 7, hitting 6 3s.</p>
