      <label for="l6xnyje" class="commentText"><p>AD‚Äôs fate is tied to the ongoing evolution of the power forward in today‚Äôs modern NBA.  How is he as a center?  Pretty good, but a bit undersized when going against the true giants of the paint.  So then how is he as a 4?  This is where things get murky.  His value is higher closer to the paint, in an era where the bigger wing player is increasingly judged by what they can do on the perimeter.  Does he handle the ball well enough as a face up player on offense?  His shooting from distance appears to have peaked during the bubble season.  All of which makes his final value still unclear.</p>

      <label for="l6xd3fy" class="commentText"><p>Not bending the defense is crazy. He does. It‚Äôs why his assists go up in the postseason because he‚Äôs regularly drawing 2 with help waiting. He learned this year to set slip screens which created a ton of open threes for Derrick white because both defenders followed him. He‚Äôs using his gravity better and finding the next pass better now. He doesn‚Äôt have the athleticism to get out of extra attention by going over, around or through the defense so he‚Äôs boring. But dude gets as much defensive attention as any superstar</p>

Maybe cause I‚Äôve seen this dude play elite level ball since he BOOMED LeBron but I just can‚Äôt see why people don‚Äôt see him as a top level player. I am certain Tatum will show out in the finals and win MVP. Maybe cause he has some stinkers? Like every player. I get Boston hate is strong, which is why I‚Äôm still rooting for Dallas but I‚Äôm not going to be blind to this nearly same level player as Luka and has been in this position nearly every year for 7 years. I think that will prove to be an edge.</p>

<p>One weird stat is Tatum has increased his APG every year in the league (seven years now!). And it&rsquo;s not just due to more playing time, still holds true if you look at his Per 36 numbers.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s come so far as a playmaker.</p>

      <label for="l6xp3gw" class="commentText"><p>I think the thing with Tatum is that he is pretty good at pretty much everything with very few if any actual weaknesses in his game, but he doesn&rsquo;t have any one particular game-breaking skill.</p>

<p>LeBron had his ability to get to the rim as well as his playmaking. Curry obviously has his shooting and off-ball movement. Jokic has his playmaking. Luka has his start-stop ability as well as tough-shot making ability while also being one of the best passers we&rsquo;ve ever seen. Kawhi at his best has his post-up, mid-range, and DPOY level defense. Giannis just on physical traits alone is in a class of his own, and he has the ability to get to+finish at the rim while again providing DPOY level defense at his best.</p>

<p>Tatum might not have the weaknesses some of those guys have, and it might give him a safer floor, but he also does not have any one skill on the level of those things. Not that its some huge knock on him or anything, being the 5th-7th best player in the league as opposed to top 4 isnt something to scoff at, its just there is so much talent at the top there that you basically have to nitpick things like that.</p>

      <label for="l6xkrm0" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s the Tim Duncan of small forwards in that his play is extremely effective but it does not lend itself to splash plays and there aren&rsquo;t really any holes in his game. So we will just quietly kill teams in a way that is frustratingly effortless to watch (like you know how it&rsquo;s happening but how is it happening type of deal).</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s also not someone that will randomly go off for 55. He just scores 26-31 points every single game like clockwork.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s not the most athletic guy. He&rsquo;s not the best shooter. He&rsquo;s not the best playmaker. There is not one definitive skill you can &ldquo;market&rdquo; or &ldquo;sell&rdquo; fans on (plus, he&rsquo;s a relatively quiet personality). He&rsquo;s just incredibly good at every aspect of basketball and he wins a lot.</p>

<p>IMO what‚Äôs crazy is that a few seasons ago, this is who he was. He led the league in 50+ point games not too long ago. He just never needs to do it on this team.</p>

<p>IMO once this iteration of the Cs roster goes away and we go back to Tatum + Brown/All Star + White/fringe all star, he can carry more of the scoring burden and will become more appreciated</p>

<p>Another thing with Tatum is that when he&rsquo;s at his best, he&rsquo;s just making winning plays. Lock down defense, trusting his guys, winning winning winning. If he stays in that mindset and doesn&rsquo;t try to break out the ol Kobe impression that plagued him in early seasons, Boston in 6, 5 with a healthy Porzingas.</p>

<p>That series last year Embiid literally missed two games and wasn&rsquo;t not playing nearly to his highest level when he came back (not even close). Which is a very valid criticism since he has been injured every playoffs except for one (when Ben Simmons coincidentally was injured). Like we don&rsquo;t ignore Odem injuries etc. At this point you can&rsquo;t ignore the injuries and brush them off. Much of Embiids prime has been wasted on Sixers front office incompetence and Embiids injury history.</p>

<p>Like Embiid has been so injured to point that it would be hard for many people to take him over any player in the 10 top ten when building a team. But when people rank players they tend to ignore injuries (although some people haven&rsquo;t like Bill Simmons, which I think is very fair at this point with Embiid).</p>

<p>But counter point, I feel like he &ldquo;disappears&rdquo; just because he&rsquo;s not traditionally flashy. He might not put up 40 every night, but he&rsquo;ll consistently give you 25/10/5, and has been a relatively low turnover guy with good defense. He doesn&rsquo;t have showy plays or amazing assists, just consistently does everything well</p>

<p>Deferring to the hot hand is also a strength of this team, and he plays into that role</p>

<p>Idk, the &ldquo;he disappears&rdquo; narrative has just seemed to be based a lot more in vibes than actual stats and results</p>

<p>I mean people can argue anything. I don&rsquo;t see any reasonable argument this year is his best ball when his numbers are down almost across the board, he had better accolades last year, and his points are the lowest they&rsquo;ve been since he was a rookie.</p>

<p>If Brown has a great series, then he would have just had two awesome series on the biggest stage, and he&rsquo;s at least &lsquo;in the conversation&rsquo; given a lot of other guys in the mix are either frequently injured,  starting to get too old, or &lsquo;haven&rsquo;t been able to do it when it counts&rsquo;.</p>

<p>If its Tatum, then the easy comparison is between him and Embiid who is just always so banged up, whereas Tatum is at least getting to the conf finals each year and giving his team a real chance.</p>

<p>Do you not see the insanity in this statement lol. Tatum would need to win a title to overtake a perennial second round exit because he puts up some big statlines against the Wizards and Hornets in the regular season.</p>

The Celtics had an easy path to the finals and never had to play anybody higher than a 4th seed! Of course they beat the 5th seed in the finals, if they didn‚Äôt get lucky by avoiding one of the top 3 seeds in the West, they wouldn‚Äôt have won! If anything, they should have won by more. After all, the Celtics have such a stacked superteam and Luka and Kyrie just don‚Äôt have any help.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And no one will think about the ridiculousness of this statement. The KP trade was not seen as a huge coup for Boston at the time given that they gave up Marcus Smart (a fan favorite versus Porzingis who had attitude + injury questions). Celtics only had two All-Stars and one All-NBA player. Mazzulla never really contended for Coach of the Year and has been doubted by half the media for the entire season. And yet they won 64 games and steamrolled their way to the NBA Finals.</p>

<p>So either the Celtics are a super team or they aren&rsquo;t, but no one can make up their mind.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s exactly the point that Zach Lowe is getting at in this clip, and to that end he&rsquo;s sticking with his Celtics pick from the pre-season, unless Porzingis is unavailable, so there&rsquo;s a strong argument that the combination of the Celtics&rsquo; depth and versatility will be enough to carry the day. Particularly as their team&rsquo;s offense has been historically efficient, despite the lack of a top-tier single offensive player like Luka.</p>

<p>I think people tend to dismiss those kinds of teams because they rely on more people playing well, and I think they&rsquo;re more vulnerable to variance (or at least it feels that way). If the team needs everyone playing at a high level to succeed on offense, one bad series from a lower pecking-order player can have a huge impact.</p>

And his piece about the Celtics&rsquo; D getting overlooked was a reminder of how much of the mediascape is &ldquo;narrative&rdquo; based rather than actually looking at how the teams are playing</p>

<p>a lot of &ldquo;expect them to bounce back&rdquo; emotive narratives instead of &ldquo;here are adjustments to enable them to bounce back&rdquo; is all the rage with pundits, which is why Zach&rsquo;s insight is so valuable</p>

Just the same 2-3 points rehashed over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. Especially in that case, no one had a fucking clue about anything and it was just all dependent on the last game. I just wanted them to win, fuck the entire GOAT rankings narrative after 1.5 seasons.</p>

<p>Cut way down on the amount of sports commentary I watch though and I don&rsquo;t miss it.</p>

      <label for="l6xakfj" class="commentText"><p>But that&rsquo;s kinda Zach&rsquo;s point. The Celtics are the best team and have a clear top 8 guy on their team. Awesome! They went 12-2 in the East because in every series they had both the best team and the best guy</p>

<p>But typically the best teams at the end have one of those puppet master superstars that can manipulate everything, eg Luka or Jokic or for a decade prime LeBron. How will they respond now that they have the best team but not the best guy? If it is a close game down the stretch, you&rsquo;d have to say Dallas has advantage because of Luka no? I think the Celtics are going to need to be up a healthy amount in the 4th in games they win in this series.</p>

<p>Boston kinda reminds me of the Warriors. High volume 3 point shooting team, good versatile defenders across the board etc. However Tatum is not quite on Steph&rsquo;s level. Point is at some stage he may need to step up into that territory, even if just for a few games, to win a finals. Because chances are there&rsquo;s one of those guys on the other side of the court</p>

It‚Äôs not the end of the world if Tatum is closer to Top 6-10 than Top 1-5, it‚Äôs not a slight to be called the 7th best active player in the world. Thankfully we have a great FO that built a team that plays to his strengths and covers areas that could be considered weaknesses.</p>

<p>A team‚Äôs best player gets the most attention, but we gotta remember it‚Äôs still a team sport.</p>

<p>The Celtics aren&rsquo;t the #1 team in the NBA because they have the best player on the court every game. They are the best team because their 3-5 guys are all all stars/all defensive players. Jrue/White/KP would be the 2nd or 3rd best player on most other teams, not the 4th and 5th best.</p>

<p>Oh no, he‚Äôs not an all time game breaker. Well he‚Äôs still really good and consistently leads deep playoff runs. If you do include health he‚Äôs somewhere between 4 and 8 in terms of guys you want on your team, and moving him around within that tier should not be as big of a deal as it is. Top 5 is just an arbitrary cutoff anyways.</p>

<p>And before anyone says that no one disagrees, ‚ÄúTatum is not top 10‚Äù had thousands of upvotes a few weeks ago. People need to take an extreme, so a guy who is ‚Äújust‚Äù very good drives them crazy.</p>

<p>There are some fans who claim that &ldquo;Tatum isn&rsquo;t even top 10&rdquo; which is ridiculous.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;ve also seen some Celtic fans get really defensive and claim that Tatum is 100% top 3 and better than Luka/SGA/some other player because of defense or &ldquo;because he is the best player on the #1 seed&rdquo;. Which doesn&rsquo;t make sense when ranking players either, to use the seed while ignoring the supporting cast.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm gonna catch heat for this but I absolutely still think he has an <em>argument</em> for being over SGA- It‚Äôs at least close enough to debate. Shai was definitely better this season and deserved the MVP votes but if you swap them I think Tatum takes OKC to a very similar result.</p>

<p>KP vs Randle?</p>

<p>KP vs rookie Chet?</p>

<p>maaaaybe KP vs KAT?</p>

<p>KP isn&rsquo;t clearly better and would also be a bad fit on some of these teams, but I think you could at least make a case, and these are all top 3 seeded teams in their conference. If we look at worse teams, KP would 100% be the 2nd best player on a bunch of them, and even the best on some lottery teams.</p>

If you want to make the argument he‚Äôs #5 over SGA who was 2nd in MVP this year, they have a case but it‚Äôs hard to knock what other guys are doing.</p>

<p>As the series goes Luka is the best player but then you can pretty confidently say that Boston has prob 5 of the next 6 slots with Kai coming in behind Tatum and Brown but above White, Jrue &amp; healthy KP. They don‚Äôt have THE guy but a wave of guys who can beat you down for 48min</p>

Especially when there&rsquo;s inevitably dozens of comments of people actually trashing hum in the comments of the post that theoretically isn&rsquo;t trashing him.</p>

<p>Against guys who have won MVPs Tatum is 6-4 in the playoffs. One loss was in his rookie year getting within 6 minutes of beating prime Bron. Another was in his 2nd season when Kyrie decided he should iso defend Giannis over Al Horford. The next was in 2021 against a fully healthy Nets god squad with no Jaylen Brown, a fully washed Kemba, and Romeo Langford starting‚Ä¶ he dropped 50 and 40 in that series. The last loss was when Steph had the best playoff series of his career.</p>

<p>3 wins against Embiid (including game 7 record), 2 wins against Giannis (including 46 in a road elimination game), and sweeping KD.</p>

Celtics have insane luxury in 5 players (J&rsquo;s, Porzingis, Jrue, Derrick White) who can take the mantle if somebody needs to take a backseat.</p>

<p>The more underrated part of Tatum&rsquo;s game is that he can still make a pretty big impact on a bad shooting night. He&rsquo;ll get to the line a handful of times no matter what and he can guard almost anybody. I think SGA has absolutely been better than Tatum this year but Tatum is without a doubt a better defender and I have no love lost for Celtics whatsoever.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>They have that <em>this year</em>. Somehow I keep seeing people discussing Tatum as if he&rsquo;s had this insane talent around him his whole career. He&rsquo;s had good teams, no doubt, but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s had the &ldquo;clearly most talented roster in the east&rdquo; at any point until now, really.</p>

      <label for="l6x4m98" class="commentText"><p>So if Tatum wins, the excuse is that he‚Äôs got a great team, and if he loses, it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs not a great player?</p>

<p>Tatum will never get into top 5 conversation because he‚Äôs a team player who lets everyone gets theirs. We saw when Kyrie was here, how he didn‚Äôt gel with JB and JT, wrecked the team and left.</p>

<p>Would Celtics have a great team if Tatum was not accommodating, and instead decided to chase points and MVPs instead of the title? No. Because JB will not be happy, KP won‚Äôt, and we‚Äôll have a repeat of the Kyrie saga again.</p>

<p>How many of that top 5-8 can sacrifice for the team and still put MVP numbers? Luka and Jokic sure. Giannis too. But SGA? Brunson? Embiid who was literally begging for an MVP?</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tatum gets criticized for letting JB or KP takeover when just a couple of seasons ago, the criticism was that he and JB don‚Äôt share the ball enough. So basically no way he‚Äôs keeping all the talking heads happy.</p>

<p>And now he is not being credited for staying healthy even. Amazing how the excuses keep piling up for someone like Embiid just because he keeps stat padding.</p>

      <label for="l6x2wra" class="commentText"><p>I get what he means but Tatum has beaten Embiid and Giannis multiple times in the playoffs . He has also beaten Kd in the playoffs and notorious playoff riser Jimmy butler in the playoffs . It took an all time performance from Steph curry for the Celtics to lose in the finals  and I‚Äôm not sure an all time performance from Luka would be enough to beat this version of the Celtics .</p>

      <label for="l6x7s0q" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s iffy for me.  Tatum out of those top 5 guys is really only met on both sides of the ball by Giannis and is just an ironman of a player.  When everyone is healthy, sure he may be like top 6-8 in the league, but this is basketball.  I think Tatum out of all of those guys is the one I would want to plug and play in almost any lineup in the league.  Guy can just do a little bit of everything and it makes him so valuable to any team.  The discourse about this top 5 shit is annoying. Tatum is great, and all the other top 5 guys are great.  Don&rsquo;t need to make multiple segments on national television saying the same thing.</p>

      <label for="l6x3fss" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I just can‚Äôt believe people still have Embiid over Tatum. He kills him every year. Embiid‚Äôs talent level is higher and his highest peaks are better but availability and versatility are important. Tatum has shown he fits in with absolutely anyone on the floor, Embiid has not. If we‚Äôre going just pure peak and assuming health, then Kawhi is prob 3-4 too</p>

      <label for="l6x87cu" class="commentText"><p>It depends on what the person means by ‚Äúhaving‚Äù Embiid over Tatum.</p>

<p>You yourself admit he has a higher talent level and higher peaks. If that‚Äôs the case then it makes sense that some people would consider those peaks when deciding their personal top <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> players.</p>

<p>Why you ‚Äúcan‚Äôt believe‚Äù that is strange to me lol. Not everyone is going to use the same criteria as you in making their list</p>

      <label for="l6xf9qw" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s great and all, but the Wolves didn&rsquo;t have the best player and beat the Nuggets, and the Knicks didn&rsquo;t have the best player and beat the 76ers, Pacers didn&rsquo;t have the best player and beat the Bucks and Knicks.</p>

<p>Then go back to last year, Celtics didn&rsquo;t have the best player against the 76ers and beat them, Heat didn&rsquo;t have the best player and beat the Bucks and Celtics.</p>

<p>Do great players win a lot of the time and can be the difference? Sure, yeah. But is it always the case? No.</p>

<p>A lot of these series I listed are because these guys played great but got a lot of help from the team as a collective. Did the Thunder lose to the Mavs because SGA was just much worse than Doncic? No. It&rsquo;s because the Mavs locked everyone else up and held Jalen Williams, Chet Holmgren and Josh Giddey below their season averages and what they averaged against the Pelicans.</p>

<p>That will be the test of the series, how well the Mavs can defend all the Celtics options and limit guys besides Tatum and Brown going off. It will be incredibly difficult to beat them if you have Tatum and Brown combining for 50 and you get Derrick White and Porzingis also giving you another 40 or something. Similarly, the Celtics will have a really hard time if Luka and Kyrie are going off and they get consistent help from Washington, Gafford, Lively and DJJ.</p>

<p>Imo the difference here is Luka is more likely to play consistently great than Tatum which is why most consider him a better player, but if Luka plays even below average, the Mavericks have almost no chance because the Celtics are collectively a better team.</p>

<p>Go back and look at all the Wolves 3P attempts in Game 5 that were Luka&rsquo;s responsibility. Even though they got killed that game, that was still a hole in the Mavs defense. Celtics are going to kill the Mavs on the open looks they generate and the volume of 3&rsquo;s they shoot unless the Mavs make great defensive adjustments or the Celtics go completely cold. The Mavs defense is going to be the deciding factor in the series, not &ldquo;which superstar carries their team&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the Mavs play great defense and lock down the Celtics, they&rsquo;ll win. If they can&rsquo;t stop the Celtics and it&rsquo;s just a barrage of offense from Boston&rsquo;s top 6, the Celtics will win. Regardless of the whole Luka vs Tatum thing</p>

      <label for="l6xv1ko" class="commentText"><p>Embiid is possibly the most overrated player in the history of the NBA right now. I can‚Äôt remember a player in my lifetime who has had more celebration and less criticism with almost zero playoff success ten years since he was drafted. They have no conference finals appears. January Joel has played meh at best in the playoffs but man if you 70 in Indiana in January he is absolutely your top pick.</p>
