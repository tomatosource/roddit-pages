    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>People see a player facing a lot of help defense throughout the game and immediately think this is only about that player’s high level offensive gravity and skill, but it’s not so simple. A defensive game plan also takes into consideration how much success the team thinks it can get by specifically swarming that player, trying to force turnovers or bad plays.  Tatum’s history with turnovers isn’t no secret, and Mavs were pretty successful in that in game 1 forcing 6 turnovers off him. But Tatum also made them pay many times too. But just facing doubles and triples as you drive in just a staple of the zone defense the Mavs we’re running yesterday, and clearly the gameplan was to try to force turnovers off Tatum as well which the warriors and Heat have had success with over the last 2 years because of his sometimes sketchy ball control. It doesn’t inherently mean the player has some insane offensive gravity.</p>

<p>It’s also a point of why curry’s gravity when playing with KD is slightly overexaggerated.  yes he did have insane offensive gravity and was still the more impactful player on that team, but the sole point of him being doubled and tripled vastly more than KD isn’t the entire proof of that. As a defense you can aim to get more success swarming a shorter smaller weaker 6’3 guy than a 7 foot KD. And curry himself has sometimes had issues with turnovers so part of the gameplan is to hope to force turnovers off him by swarming him so much. So there multiple factors. For curry’s case, his all time gamebreaking  offensive skill obviously played a vastly bigger factor.</p>
