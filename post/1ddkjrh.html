<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pablo Torre:</strong> The first thing I need you to know about Miriam Adelson – the subject of today’s story – is something I found out while reporting this episode, which is that her political reputation was apparently so radioactive that the NBA and commissioner Adam Silver would not allow her to be the governor of the team … even though the league would happily take the money of the 5th richest woman in America, who is now the 3rd richest owner in American sports right behind Steve Balmer and Rob Walton. So Miriam’s son-in-law, Patrick Dumont (an executive at her casino company), was appointed governor of the Mavericks instead. And the reason why the ostensibly left-leaning NBA insisted on this is obvious once you step just a foot outside of sports, because nobody donated more to Donald Trump in 2020 than Miriam Adelson. Few people in right-wing politics <em>period</em> are as powerful as she is, and she also happens to be one of the most powerful Pro-Israel extremists alive today by any standard.New York Magazine’s Elizabeth Weil wrote a long cover story on Miriam Adelson. One that finally answered some of the biggest questions I had on a woman whose wealth, according to Liz,  makes her not just the richest Israeli in the world, and not just one of the 10 richest women in the world, but also “effectively a queen.”</p>

<p>[17:30]</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pablo Torre:</strong> The Adelsons weren’t simply one of the most staunch families backing Netanyahu from here in the United States; Back in 2007, at Netanyahu’s behest, the launched a free, daily newspaper in Israel with the goal of influencing elections – which they did, significantly, promoting far-right positions they felt were being neglected by Israel’s mainstream media, which might sound a little familiar.</p>

<p><strong>Liz Weil:</strong> So they backed Netanyahu. They started a paper that’s sort of like a Fox New-like creation, like a mouthpiece for Netanyahu to get him elected. They brought down his predecessor through reporting about endless scandals, and it was really successful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[20:00]</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pablo Torre:</strong> Although Sheldon [Miriam’s late husband] had bigger name recognition than Miriam, it is important to note that she was not his sidekick… I urge you to take a closer look at their long history of Republican donations in the United States.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;gt;<strong>Liz Weil:</strong> If you look at some of the FEC filings, she was giving right alongside him the entire time… He gave – through his 848 donations – <span class="math inline">\(273 million, and she gave – through her 717 donations –\)</span>284 million, and she is of course still alive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pablo Torre:</strong> The degree of political influence that almost $600 million combined gets you, how would you broadly characterize that level of political influence?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;gt;<strong>Liz Weil:</strong> Their first big effort was giving to the 2nd Bush inaugural. They each gave $250,000 to his inauguration. That combined half million got them an audience with Bush. There’s a story of Miriam dropping off a CD to inform the administration about what the Jihadists were doing and she was very public about it. But it didn’t get them the policy they wanted in that administration. Condoleezza Rice was still wanting to negotiate a peace plan between the Palestinians and the Israelis.The Adelsons were very explicit that they were not for what Miriam referred to as the “so-called peace process.” So they stepped up their giving, and with Trump they were much more able to get the actual policy they wanted, get the things done in the world that they wanted… They were like heads of state.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pablo Torre:</strong> With Trump in particular, what is the headline for where they rank in terms of their relationship to Trump specifically as a benefactor?</p>

<p><strong>Liz Weil:</strong> They were his largest donors, and they shaped him. Early in the 2016 campaign, they were backing Rubio; initially, [Marco] Rubio was the most “Pro Israel” guy, and he was on air saying whatever they wanted him to say. Trump actually tweeted early on that he [Rubio] was their puppet. Trump was not as Pro Israel as he became, until the Adelsons got on board with him. He’s a really transactional guy, and they’re very transactional people as well.</p>

<p><strong>Pablo Torre:</strong> Along with the <span class="math inline">\(25 million she and Sheldon gave to Trump Super PACs in 2016, they gave another \)</span>90 million in a 3-month stretch in 2020. They gave more to federal GOP causes in 2020 than the next 3 donors combined. Between 2016 and 2022, they gave $300 million to the Republican Focus, Senate and Congressional Leadership Funds. And all of it culminated in November 2018, when Donald Trump invited Miriam to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[30:30]</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pablo Torre:</strong> Why does Miriam want to do this [own the Mavericks]? Is she a basketball fan? What’s her motive here?</p>

<p><strong>Liz Weil:</strong> The real play here has always been to bring gambling to Texas. That’s a plan they’ve been working on really aggressively since 2020, and they don’t want sports betting where you’re sitting on your couch and betting on your phone: They want you to come to a casino. That is what they’re lobbying for. That’s what they’re spending tons of money all over the capital, all over the state, not hiding it whatsoever.</p>

<p><strong>Pablo Torre:</strong> Right. The Texas-Sands PAC in 2023 spent $6 million on 63 lobbyists trying to legalize gambling in the state.</p>

<p><strong>Liz Weil:</strong>  So I think buying the team gets her a tremendous amount of political capital, a tremendous amount of publicity. You become an important face and – especially this year – a beloved face of your state. I think there’s part of a feeling that you get power by being publicly hospitable, fun and entertaining and a place that people want to be.</p>

<p><strong>Pablo Torre:</strong> A useful thing about sports is that you get fans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[37:00]</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Liz Weil:</strong> She wasn’t giving [donations] for a long time: She sat out of the primary, and there was this looming question of is she’s gonna give: How much is she gonna give? Is she upset with Trump?  Is she just too upset [about the Hamas attacks in October 2023]? Are things going to be different now that Sheldon has died? She had been giving a lot less philanthropically across the board. And now here we are in this moment. Just in the past week (after Trump was convicted) she said she’s giving him $100 million, and she’s not the only billionaire who immediately announces they’re gonna back Trump this cycle.</p>

      <label for="l86kdmm" class="commentText"><p>Silver is not a weak commissioner.  He knows what he&rsquo;s doing.  He knows the game he&rsquo;s playing.</p>

<p>And that game is multi-faceted, but it mainly involves playing himself off as a meek, player-friendly commissioner while working shrewdly behind the scenes to turn the league into a money-making juggernaut, devoid of moral values or even dedication to basketball principles (no more defense!).  We get endless challenges to create even more commercial breaks.  The NBA has made a huge push to internationalize the game to create even more revenue.  He gladly tried to silence Daryl Morey&rsquo;s right to free speech when it threatened the NBA&rsquo;s relationship with China.  He pays lip service to certain causes like Black Lives Matter only to keep main group of players from being disgruntled.  He figures he can play the long game and slowly replace the African-America player base with international players that are more cooperative.  He finds nothing wrong with Miriam Adelson, who most people would consider an advocate for Palestinian genocide, being involved in the NBA, though he is smart enough to keep her out of the limelight, for the NBA&rsquo;s benefit and her own.  Jimmy Goldstein (the guy who dresses funny at Clippers games), one of the most evil landlords in American history, is embraced as a member of the NBA community.  But again, mainly, everything is done to increase the wealth of the owners, so apparently as in Miriam Adelson&rsquo;s case, they can corrupt American democracy by blackmailing presidential candidates to make huge foreign policy moves, against international law and involving the destruction and displacement of an entire ethnic group.</p>

      <label for="l85wv9y" class="commentText"><p>yeah I feel like this is going over a lot of heads in this thread? like i feel like ppl are just acting like the point of this thread is to dunk on this lady for like what a cartoonish evil bad guy she seems to be, but&hellip; at least she&rsquo;s not hiding who she is 🤷‍♂️. evil billionaires gonna evil billionaire..</p>

<p>the bigger takeaway to me is that Adam Silver/the NBA will endlessly virtue signal and do PR victory laps about their various pet moral causes and take popular/applause-seeking political stances as long as those stances are popular at the time and not (yet) hitting them in the pocket book (see happily jumping on the 2020 BLM bandwagon when it was cool, and then quitely nope-ing out immediately and completely ditching any political stuff once ratings cratered and fans started complaining)</p>

<p>but they&rsquo;re happy to accept billions from whoever the fuck when they know it&rsquo;s behind closed doors and wont be front page news to most average fans</p>

Nothing has fundamentally changed but Adelson will be a lightning rod when she makes her next giant Trump donation. Her husband donated 20 mil to have Trump move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. So as long as the Gaza conflict continues as well as the upcoming election she&rsquo;s going to be a liability headlines-wise. Even if her son-in-law is probably the exact same.</p>

<p>I mean the devos family themselves are insane as shit .  I wonder if black players playing for the magic ever think bout that sometimes lol. I don’t really think it matters anymore tho. No morality in capitalism just optics .</p>

<p>-the NBA has relax rules of foreign investment funds over the past couple of years (<a href="https://www.ibtimes.com/qatar-investment-authority-venture-capitalist-part-3-billion-bid-phoenix-suns-3646508" target="_blank">Qatars Investment Authority was in talks to be a partner to buy the Suns</a>before Ishbia swooped in), at this time foreign funds can now invest, however I beehive the fund cannot control more than 20% of the investment.</p>

<p>-<a href="https://nbaevents.nba.com//abudhabi2024" target="_blank">This year hosted pre season games in Abu Dhabi</a> and has hosted other pre-season games on the Arabian Peninsula</p>

<p>-additionally, when Silver was on the Dan Patrick show last year, the commissioner was very clear, the rules indicates that currently Wealth Funds cannot purchase a team and being the controlling partner, however an individual would be able to buy the team.</p>

<p>Edit*&ndash;Finally, nothing is preventing the Saudi Wealth fund or any other enterprise to make substantive investments in a current Team Owner/Governor&rsquo;s main business, to influence other owners inviting to relax the rules. The Saudi&rsquo;s Investment fund have made substantive investments in these type of business since 2020. For example the Saudi PIF owns something like 10% of Micky Arison&rsquo;s Carnival Cruise Line business, That disclosure resulted in a 30% jump in the stock price (and in addition to the purchase of the shares, the public sentiment rising, significantly bumps Arison&rsquo;s net worth)</p>

      <label for="l86q0do" class="commentText"><p>So fun finance fact - a lot of big investors these days (or the ones that got “recently” big) basically just have a Middle East wealth fund or two as a silent partner. These guys have money to burn and don’t ask questions when cutting 9 figure checks. Completely different from when it was like pension funds and endowments putting in most of the money.</p>

<p>Course, if you fudge it up I imagine some guy might come to collect your thumbs or something.</p>

<p>Players can even rotate out of the lineup to play Euroleague or NBA if not banned, if they want.</p>

<p>When you say &ldquo;we,&rdquo; you should be saying the radicalized Supreme Court, whose Republican appointees allowed Citizens United (aka dark money in politics) to become the law of the land.  And that&rsquo;s because the Federalist Society, led by Leonard Leo and his hoard of right wing billionaires, demanded that they be allowed to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to get what they want.</p>

<p>One of my co-workers is the son of a notable billionaire that has a minority stake in an NBA team and you should hear the stuff his parents say about Trump and Republicans behind closed doors. Not every NBA owner is a stereotypical Republican, especially nowadays.</p>

      <label for="l86mnv7" class="commentText"><p>I absolutely agree that Cuban has great PR; I think if it weren&rsquo;t for Shark Tank we&rsquo;d all have a much more accurate view of a guy who got rich selling internet on the radio during the dot com boom and has spent his time since trying to look 25 forever while running a sports organization that enabled a ton of sexual abuse. But I think saying selling to the Adelsons makes him as bad as them isn&rsquo;t entirely true either. Cuban is an amoral asshole, which is a terrible enough thing to be, but the Adelsons have been working very hard to make the world a worse place for a long time. Amoral and immoral are both awful things to be, but immoral is always going to be worse in my book.</p>

      <label for="l872kbz" class="commentText"><p>Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s has no control over what their parent company (Unilever) does. In fact, when Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s wanted to cease sales of ice cream to the West Bank due to its principles, Unilever overrode them and forced the sales to continue. Even in the article you link, it talks about Unilever not Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s specifically. The guys who founded Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s were leftie hippies from Vermont, I doubt they like being under Unilever but they were forced to sell to Unilever under shareholder pressure as shareholders felt they cared too much about social missions rather than profit.</p>

<p>Not saying that most companies do performative activism, but this is probably one of the handful of companies that seem to care but are unfortunately under the thumb of a larger firm.</p>
