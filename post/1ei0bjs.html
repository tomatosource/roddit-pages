      <label for="lg3hj3e" class="commentText"><p>It’s not a “right wing” thing. In 2019 Hong Kong was facing the end of its existence as a city where people had basic civil liberties. The people of Hong Kong were inspiring the entire world with the most impressive display of civic virtue that I’ve seen in my lifetime. In the middle of that, Daryl Morey had the audacity to tweet “free Hong Kong” and LeBron immediately and actively called for him to be punished, whined about how he had been injured “financially, spiritually, personally, morally…” and generally did everything he could to enthusiastically express his support for China’s actions in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>It wasn’t that he “refused to criticize” the CCP, it was that he actively expressed support for their actions in Hong Kong to a greater degree than any other NBA player.</p>

<p>So yeah, a lot of people from every non-insane part of the political spectrum were mad at him. LeBron’s a great athlete and a great man but that was a terrible look.</p>

<p>He said that 1) Morey doesn’t know enough to speak on it, and based on Morey deleting his retweet and never ever talking about the topic again it’s not exactly untrue, and 2) that maybe that’s not shit someone from the NBA should be saying while NBA players are in China, which is not that crazy of a thing to request.</p>

<p>The Lakers and the Rockets players had no reason to have an opinion on the matter but because Morey decided to have half an opinion on it all those players got dragged in.</p>

      <label for="lg3laq8" class="commentText"><p>I said that because usually when people are complaining about China and Lebron they end up being right wingers. Now I don’t disagree with what you’re saying about Hong Kong but how come we see all these comments about Lebron and not Nike? Nike and the NBA are the reason Lebron has business interests vested in China, but only he ever gets blamed or name dropped.</p>

<p>That’s like blaming all of Boeings problems on one employee and ignoring the company structure that led to all their problems. If Nike and the NBA wanted to do ethical business, we wouldn’t even be arguing about this. Getting mad at a player who made himself rich while all the nameless suits don’t ever catch criticism doesn’t sit right with me.</p>

      <label for="lg3nvbi" class="commentText"><p>Nike and the NBA have never claimed to be leading voices in social justice. At the height of BLM, Lebron was one of the biggest figures in leading the movement. Now I understand BLM impacts Lebron a lot more than HK does, but you can&rsquo;t claim to be a champion of social justice while saying that about Hong Kong. Seems to me he only cares about social issues when they won&rsquo;t negativity affect his wealth.</p>

The whole china thing, was over yes the ccp but the whole uyghurs situation as well which again is human right violation.</p>

<p>Ofc, the lakers fan who has to cheer for Lebron or either a bronsexual bandwagoning any team he plays for would defend him. I&rsquo;ll tell you a little something, you can still blame him for it because deep down you know it&rsquo;s wrong. It won&rsquo;t mean you have to start hating him, he can stay your favorite player and just admit he&rsquo;s not perfect.</p>

<p>As for the last part, he gets his name dropped because he said some fucking ignorant shit. He told people to educate themselves when he&rsquo;s the one that needs to do it. If he already knew of the situation in china then it&rsquo;s even worse. Reality is he probably has no idea who the uyghurs are, or he just doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>

      <label for="lg3o23j" class="commentText"><p>First of all, saying Bronsexual shows more about you than it does about me. I don’t think Lebron is perfect, I don’t think he’s immune to criticism. I don’t need him to be either because as an adult I don’t rely on celebrities being good people or role models. They’re entertainers and athletes, I like them because at the end of my day I get some enjoyment watching the game.</p>

<p>I’m pointing out he seems to be the only person in this equation who gets criticism. A point nobody here seems to understand. How is this not the fault of the NBA, Adam Silver and company? How is it not the fault of Nike? How have other players like Jordan or Kobe, who made tons of money in China not get criticized for this? You got a good answer to that then let me hear it.</p>

<p>Can’t find any source on him demanding Morey be “punished” you’re just lying.</p>

<p>If Daryl Morey was worried the statement could hurt his career in the NBA, which he was, it’s because the NBA is the one enforcing a pro-China stance. You can still be mad at Lebron for going along with it but your accounting of those events is mostly fantasy.</p>

      <label for="lg3kykq" class="commentText"><p>Hong Kong has never been a democratic city why do people think this. You think Britain made a colonial state a democratic city? The protests were about an extradition bill that the Chinese government tried to put forth, after some guy murdered his girlfriend in Taiwan and ran away to HK, and the police found out they could not extradite him. People of HK were worried the Chinese government would start extraditing people without due process which is why they started protesting. Also lebron said &ldquo;do not speak about things you know nothing about&rdquo; which though being an attempt to protect his financial interests, maybe isn&rsquo;t such a bad idea seeing the discourse about this topic</p>

      <label for="lg3mwck" class="commentText"><p>You’re not worth responding to, but just so that no one reading this is confused — the protests were absolutely about democracy and civil liberties.</p>

<p>It’s true that the immediate cause of the protests was an extradition bill. The reason people were upset is because the extradition bill would have allowed the CCP to drag e.g. Hong Kong citizens who advocated for democracy off to the mainland for sham trials in China’s CCP-controlled court system. The Wikipedia page on <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_in_Hong_Kong#:~:text=Historically%2C%20Hong%20Kong%20was%20never,of%20Hong%20Kong%20in%201997" target="_blank">democracy in Hong Kong</a> does a good job of summarizing the history for anyone who’s interested.</p>

<p>You didn’t correct typos, you added in a whole explanation of how the extradition bill worked because your original comment just said that the protests weren’t about democracy or civil liberties at all.

<p>Why is it incumbent upon Lebron to call it out, screw up a bunch of his own money, and this isn’t expected of other players? Why isn’t this expected of Nike or the NBA itself? I’m saying it’s weird that Lebron, who is usually criticized for things nobody else gets criticized for, is once again at the forefront here in people’s minds.</p>

<p>Michael Jordan’s brand is tied in with China, do we hear criticism? Nope.</p>

<p>Nike is tied in with China, is there a campaign to call them out or get them to change? Hardly.</p>

<p>The NBA does business with China, are they criticized for it? Not nearly as much as Lebron which is what I find strange.</p>

<p>How is it that one player, amidst all these individuals and corporations seems to be the ire of the public’s rage when it comes to China? How many of your clothes, products, the very iPhone you’re likely using, are made in China and go into creating this dynamic? Just so you can hop on those products and get on a moral soap box.</p>

<p>If you’re so concerned adopt a personal boycott of any and all businesses and products in cahoots with the Chinese and then get back to me with your MLK quotes.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t like LeBron because of some weird dude completely unrelated to him posting shit on social media?   By that standard you gotta just hate every athlete right?  Sports fans are famous for saying dumb shit and getting weird AF when it comes to their favorite player or team.</p>
