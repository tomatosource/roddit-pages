Things have gone off the rails so bad that the system kind of has no choice but to begin actually dealing with Trump. Almost an involuntary spasm. Or vomiting. That&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m worried about longer term Troubles style violence. God willing the cognitive dissonance between &ldquo;moderate Republicans&rdquo; and degenerate fascists will finally snap and the GOP will actually just lose power. But these people are not going away, or have given any indication they want to be &ldquo;saved&rdquo; from their delusions.</p>

<p>or have given any indication they want to be &ldquo;saved&rdquo; from their delusions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This may be a controversial opinion but I have shifted back to the whole koombaya let&rsquo;s hold on hands philosophy.</p>

<p>For a while, if you were conservative or a Republican I didn&rsquo;t want anything to do with you. I just assumed you were inherently a racist and evil.</p>

<p>But since the pandemic, I have made it a point to try to reestablish ties with conservative family and make new conservative friends.</p>

<p>Basically, I think we have a choice to make. Yes it&rsquo;s unfair. Yes it shouldn&rsquo;t fall solely on our shoulders. Yes many people, maybe even a majority of them, will cause us to put in work that&rsquo;s all in vain.</p>

<p>But if just 3 million voters can be saved from this cult, that would be worth it.</p>

<p>So for me, I am looking for the people capable of change. Capable of realizing they were hoodwinked this whole time. Capable of facing their racism and overcoming it.</p>

<p>There really are Americans capable of it. But it requires us to have buckets loads of empathy and compassion. And to keep trying to find things in common, thing thing we can work on.</p>

<p>And I am not talking about national politics. But grassroots and local politics. Afterall, it was random Secretary of States, Republicans, in some cases who may have helped save our democracy (so far, anyway).</p>

<p>I am happy to give up on a lot of them, but I think some aren&rsquo;t only worth saving still but we can&rsquo;t do ti without them.</p>

<p>We just have to be willing to stop seeing them as evil and try to understand why they are like this and figure out ways to help them overcome their darker sides.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether or not people want to use the word insurrection (it was), inciting a riot is still a crime. He obviously did that. He&rsquo;s practically admitted it in court, using the term riot instead of insurrection in order to remain on state ballots and nullify the 14th amendment.</p>

<p>Inciting a riot where people got <em>killed</em> should&rsquo;ve been instant charges.</p>

<p>Or at least a few weeks later once he wasn&rsquo;t President anymore.</p>

Took years for Garland to appoint Jack Smith and that was only because the dems in the house held public hearings for the Jan 6 insurrection and all the photos of boxes of top secret docs all over his shitty club surfaced. They didn’t want any of this. Biden included. They could have charged him day one for the hush money shit he just became a convicted felon over as well but chose not to. He was dead to rights violating federal campaign finance law and was already an un indicted co conspirator. Biden would have preferred to maintain the illusion of American exceptionalism in Democracy instead facing the real facts that half this country is fascist. I think it was a real strategic mistake politically. He was always going to be accused of targeting his political opponent and now by not making it a priority it’s all come a head during this election year. </p>

<p>He didn’t make anyone happy. His base is pissed for them sitting on their hands and the mouth breathers can’t be reasoned with no matter what so it was stupid not to just kill the cancer before it spread.</p>

He was already on the way out so there was nothing more to lose. They could have cut ties with him once and for all (which all but the truly crazy want to do anyway), and they could have given the appearance that they were doing the right thing.

<p>Before the 2020 election had even happened yet, but the polling was looking horrible, Dumdum Jr saw the handwriting on the wall with the tax fraud investigations, and he told people, <em>If dad loses they&rsquo;re coming after us hard</em> or something to that effect.   He never wanted to actually win in &lsquo;16.  He really didn&rsquo;t want to lose in &lsquo;20, and he&rsquo;s F&rsquo;d if he loses in &lsquo;24.</p>

It was all marketing theatre until he started winning and then it just became a silly joke that got out of control. He couldn&rsquo;t reign it back it in so he just went for it and fell into being president. And now it has nothing to do with politics or leading the country at all it&rsquo;s just %100 all about his bruised ego and revenge.</p>

      <label for="l6fu8vw" class="commentText"><p>I think there was some question because not all of the payments were personally signed checks by Trump.  The jury could have made some distinction if they wanted to give him a bit of grace.  That they got him on every charge and that they did it this quickly makes for a very decisive verdict, there’s little ambiguity in how they had to rule.  The main takeaway is that the defense failed to get a single saboteur on the jury, which they were completely banking on.</p>

I’ve been on a jury, and they can denigrate the court all they want on Fox News, but when you are there the gravity of the situation is impressive. So many people are working at a high level to make our justice system run. It’s hard not to respect. You also probably get friendly with one or two of your fellow jurors, and maybe they are someone you wouldn’t normally be friends with. You can’t discuss the case with them, so you actually get to know them. You have lunch together every day and talk about your lives and interests. It’s not a vacation because it’s a lot of work, but it is a vacation from your regular job, so you’re not worried about that for a change. Then when it does come time to discuss the case, you respect each other and reality sets in. You know what you have to do.</p>

<p>Before he even got a month into his 2016 campaign, it was obvious that he was a slovenly, entitled, cry baby with no intelligence.</p>

<p>The people who support him do so because they see themselves in him.  They are also greedy, lazy, dumb fuck racists, who want to believe they deserve more than other people without having to actually put in any real work.  It’s easier to blame your problems on some group of “others” and stand behind the baboon that will fling feces at them with you, than to reflect and realize that you are the problem and that you need to generate change from within.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s unique to Trump. people build up celebrities too much in their heads. it&rsquo;s always a let down.</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s why I would love to see the Senate drag the Supreme Court into investigations, televised, for 80 hours a week.</p>

<p>those dudes can&rsquo;t hack it. Clarence Thomas would be worse than Trump and it would be on TV. after a few weeks tops at least one or two would resign so they can enter retirement and spend all the money they have undoubtedly squirreled away from rich benefactors.</p>

<p>and even if not, lets remove the veil. people need to see how old, feeble, and generally ill equipped these &ldquo;masters of the law&rdquo; really are</p>

<p>Since then, commentators on both sides of the aisle have referred to the juror as someone who uses Truth Social and have largely assumed he’s a likely pro-Trump vote on the jury (Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz tweeted &ldquo;LFG Juror #2!&rdquo; and the Citizen Free Press called it &ldquo;Good news for Trump&rdquo;), but notes from trial pool reporters suggest the juror doesn’t personally use Truth Social.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LOL</p>

<p>When Matt Gaetz pipes up whining, people should remind him.</p>

<p>Also it&rsquo;s disturbing that they view the whole system like this, like it&rsquo;s a game that you &ldquo;win&rdquo;. And that you can manipulate by having &ldquo;your guy&rdquo;. They&rsquo;ve really fucking overt about how much they hate democratic systems.</p>

He&rsquo;ll hand over power to anyone who can help him escape accountability for bid crimes, no matter how depraved - see project 2025. He&rsquo;s not ideologically a fascist, because that would require to him to have an ideology. Instead, he&rsquo;ll do anything for himself and fuck anyone over in over to further himself, including the whole damn country. It&rsquo;s the logical end to his character arc, if you want to look at it that way. He&rsquo;s spent his entire life throwing everyone he knows under the bus to further himself. You gotta raise the stakes, or the story gets boring. Eventually, he has to destroy the country, and with it the world.</p>

      <label for="l6fbe43" class="commentText"><p>In 2016, he didn&rsquo;t do it as a joke, he did it for two reasons, equally important:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It was a marketing ploy, because the only &ldquo;skill&rdquo; he&rsquo;s ever had is creating the illusion that his brand is credible and worth doing business with. The perpetual will to keep up this illusion is necessary because <em>literally everyone who has done business with him</em> gets burned. So marketing his &ldquo;brand&rdquo; is the only way he could open new grifting opportunities, and on that note;</p></li>

<li><p>The Citizens United ruling pretty much allows politicians to do as they please with PAC money, and he knew that by running for president, he opens up a revenue stream; a grift in and of itself.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Running for president isn&rsquo;t something that was new for him, he ran multiple times prior to 2016 but because the idiot-half of our country couldn&rsquo;t stomach the fact that a black man trying to give us healthcare was president for the 8 years leading up to that, in conjunction with the brain rot they incurred via Fox/Limbaugh/Breitbart/etc. during that time, his inflammatory incoherent bullshit was a lit match in a house with a gas leak. You&rsquo;re absolutely right to think he never wanted the job, he&rsquo;s Icarus, except he&rsquo;s not smart enough to <em>just</em> fly too close to the sun, he flew directly into it.</p>

<p>He only ran again in 2020 in hopes of avoiding today. Guilty on 34 charges.</p>

Also part of his defense was that Cohen stole from money Trump gave him to fix polls. Even more, not only did he conceal hush money payments and buy scandalous stories from being printed, but he also funded lies about his opponents being published in tabloids.</p>

<p>Does any reasonable person believe that he didn&rsquo;t do similar criminal actions in the 2020 campaign or in the current 2024 campaign? How much of our current public polling is being funded by Trump to put him on top? How much tabloid garbage being regurgitated on Fox News, Newsmax, etc.. is being funded by Trump?

I am so sick of Republicans dictating the vocabulary and terminology we use. Know why they call it &ldquo;law and order&rdquo; instead of just &ldquo;law&rdquo; or &ldquo;justice&rdquo;? Because the &ldquo;order&rdquo; is the important part nobody seems to fucking get. They have a preferred social hierarchy, or order, and the idea is to enforce the law so it applies unequally depending on where in that order you fall. Rich white people skate by. Poor people of color get hit with the maximum charges. Law and order is a manipulation of the legal system wherein people of privilege are permitted to get away with more while poor, unprivileged people have to hope they&rsquo;re never in the wrong place at the wrong time. Greg Abbott pardoning a murderer is law and order, too. It is an evil, corrupt legal system that none of us should want any part of. And that begins with us discontinuing the use of that stupid, stupid phrase.</p>
