</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>So, for anyone who doesn&rsquo;t know, Shohei Ohtani, a Japanese baseball player, playing for the L.A. Dodgers just reached <sup>48</sup>&frasl;<sub>48</sub>, meaning he hit 48 home runs and stole 48 bases, which has never been done by any player in MLB history. He broke the record by being the only player to reach <sup>43</sup>&frasl;<sub>43</sub> and is now on pace to reach a <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> season.</p>

<p>For reference, <sup>40</sup>&frasl;<sub>40</sub> has only been achieved by 6 players, including Ohtani. Last year, a player named Acuña reached a historic <sup>40</sup>&frasl;<sub>70</sub>, but a <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> has never been done before and would be a season for the history books.</p>

<p>Is it possible to find an NBA equivalent of such a feat?</p>

<p>What a lot of people don’t remember about Hakeem&rsquo;s quadruple double is that he almost (and technically may have) had two of them in one month! On March 3rd, 1990, Hakeem had 29pts, 18reb, 10ast, and 11blk. But, the NBA reviewed the game footage and reduced his assist total to 9, taking away his quadruple double. So, on March 29th he decided to do it again and had 18/16/10/11.</p>

<p>He also had a <sup>170</sup>&frasl;<sub>170</sub> and is the only person to get that (89-90 376 blocks (wild)/174 steals) which I think is the crazier season, 4th most blocks all time while still being top 200 all time in steals</p>

<p><sup>160</sup>&frasl;<sub>160</sub> only one other player has achieved (Bobby Jones) And Hakeem did it 3 times</p>

<p>So i think <sup>210</sup>&frasl;<sub>210</sub> when the next closest is <sup>160</sup>&frasl;<sub>160</sub> is definitely a really good call out</p>

      <label for="lnt3uzm" class="commentText"><p>I think Hakeem is one of the players who makes most clear how all-time rankings are biased in favor of the guys who just had the fortune of being on good teams/franchises.</p>

<p>A year 2 Hakeem took Houston to the Finals. To get there he demolished Kareem/Magic/Worthy Lakers who were champions the year prior in just 5 games putting 31/11/2/2/4 on Kareem&rsquo;s head. He pushed the 86&rsquo; Celtics - the best incarnation of the Bird Celtics - to 6 games. Those Celtics were 11-1 heading into the Finals. The Celtics featured Bird, McHale, Parish, Dennis Johnson, etc.</p>

<p>And what did Hakeem have to duke it out with these titans of rosters? A Ralph Sampson who, while a star himself, went totally ghost in the Finals and wasn&rsquo;t a superstar or anything like that. After that the roster was just role players&hellip; nothing even close to a star to be found.</p>

<p>Then Sampson gets hurt and Hakeem has nothing to work with for damn near a decade.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not putting any other guys down when I say this, but guys consistently ranked over him have frequently done a lot less with a lot more. We correctly acknowledge his championship victories as all-time runs and carry-jobs, but what he accomplished in his SECOND YEAR IN THE LEAGUE might be even more impressive all things considered.</p>

<p>If you give him guys like Pippen, Rodman, Harper, and Phil Jackson as the coach, you&rsquo;re telling me this dude doesn&rsquo;t rack up titles? If you give him Magic, Worthy, Wilkes, etc? McHale, Parish, DJ, and more? An entire career cycling through DRob, TP, Manu, Kawhi, great role players, and Pop as the coach? Some cycle of Kyrie, KLove, DWade, Chris Bosh, Anthony Davis, etc.?</p>

      <label for="lnu7a0s" class="commentText"><p>That was a reasonable pick that most any team at the time would have made. Hakeem was a sure-bet prospect that played the most important position in his era. Jordan was also clearly going to be great, but he was a guard and at that point guards didn&rsquo;t usually lead teams to championships.</p>

<p>Portland did the age old blunder of drafting for fit with a top pick. Drexler at the time was probably the best guard in the league, so Jordan would have been redundant. I think Portland knew Jordan would be good but figured he couldn&rsquo;t possibly become better than Clyde Drexler. Portland was already good. They got the 2nd pick two years earlier in a trade with Indiana. So really if Indiana had not made that boneheaded move they would have been in a position to draft Jordan(this is never talked about.)</p>

<p>I actually think the Kings are not drafting Luka when the Suns passed on him for no good reason is actually worse. The Kings were not good at that point, that was their pick and it looks like they didn&rsquo;t draft Luka because they didn&rsquo;t think he would fix next to Fox who they saw as their future point guard superstar. At least when Portland passed on Jordan they were using some type of logic that made sense.  Although Luka hadn&rsquo;t achieved what Jordan did he is still an all time great type player. Also Bowie actually did fit on Portland and was better than Bagley who both wasn&rsquo;t great and didn&rsquo;t even fit well with the team. So Sacramento didn&rsquo;t understand who would fit well on the team or whom to draft. They drafted for fit when they should have drafted for talent and they didn&rsquo;t even hit on the fit.</p>

<p>Bowie&rsquo;s career was derailed by injuries mostly, from 24-28 he was mostly injured and those are supposed to be the most productive years a player has. He was a monster shot blocker before his injuries and was initially efficient but his injuries quickly sapped him of his best abilities.</p>

      <label for="lns0p4o" class="commentText"><p>Dream was absolutely amazing. Even prime David Robinson,one of the best defensive centers ever,was absolutely helpless trying to stop him in those mid 90&rsquo;s playoff runs. Defensively Admiral was probably second only to Hakeem. Just an incredible blend of agility, speed,skill, length,and athleticism. I&rsquo;m not old enough to remember peak Kareem, just older late 80&rsquo;s Kareem,But Dream is the best center I&rsquo;ve ever seen with my own eyes. And I say this as a huge Admiral and Shaq fan. Shaq was more dominant, possibly more unstoppable in the offensive end, but didn&rsquo;t have the same defensive impact. He could have,at times he did, but Shaq,let&rsquo;s just say, wasn&rsquo;t always motivated. Hakeem brought it every night,and also hit his free throws lol. He&rsquo;s gotta be just behind Wilt, Kareem, Russell for me. And most of those guys played with far more talented teammates. Especially Russell and Kareem.</p>

      <label for="lnqqooq" class="commentText"><p>Zero chance another <sup>200</sup>&frasl;<sub>200</sub> season happens unless a lot changes about the game. Last time anyone other than a guard has gotten 200 steals was Scotty Pippin in the 94-95 season. No one has gotten 200 steals since Chris Paul in the 08-09 season, and it&rsquo;s only been done 3 times since 1997 &ndash; CP3 x 2 (07-08, 08-09) and AI x 1 (01-02). A guy like Wemby only had 88 steals last season.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s going to take a special season to get 200 steals alone; let alone 200 steals and blocks. The game is just a lot different than it was 30 years ago. First and foremost, imo, hand checking isn&rsquo;t allowed. But there&rsquo;s way better space and pace. Finally, people are less likely to gamble in passing lanes because if you miss now, it leads to a wide open 3; 20-30 years ago, if you missed, most people would drive where you have lots of help.</p>

To be honest, I don’t really take it away from him, though, it’s still shows that amazing amount of athleticism. The dude is just an alien when you take into consideration, he’s also a starting major league pitcher. It’s nuts. Overall, I’m really glad baseball made the changes. Games were approaching four hours long on average, they made the right decisions in my opinion.</p>

      <label for="lnr15vf" class="commentText"><p>These are great points, and just to amplify the point about spacing, in Hakeem&rsquo;s day there was way more traffic in the paint both in terms of bodies and ball movement than there is today. That makes it far less likely for a big man to be able to rack up steals just because of the opportunities presented by the way the game is played, independent of the big man&rsquo;s skills. A clone of Hakeem coming up in today&rsquo;s game would probably get a lot less steals than Hakeem did in his day.</p>

Everything he does kind of mocks baseball history, in a great way.</p>

<p>Whatever the pitching equivalent is to a <sup>40</sup>&frasl;<sub>40</sub>, (would it be a combined K&rsquo;s and ERA?) he probably could do that, too. And then he would make a goal to do the pitching version and the <sup>40</sup>&frasl;<sub>40</sub> in the same season. </p>

<p>If the Dodgers make the WS, I suspect Ohtani will pitch at some point, if he is able.</p>

      <label for="lnqp2cb" class="commentText"><p>This is a great comment. This whole thread is trying to put Ohtani&rsquo;s feats into &lsquo;human&rsquo; terms but he simply isn&rsquo;t human.</p>

<p>I always think about how quickly we just accepted that the dude is doing what he is doing. How little time it took us to just be like &lsquo;yea he is the guy that does that&rsquo; &amp; not have our minds blown every time we think about it. I&rsquo;ve said it before, but if you went back in time 10 years &amp; told me someone was going to be both one of the game&rsquo;s best pitchers + hitters simultaneously, I straight up would not have believed you. I sincerely didn&rsquo;t think that was even possible.</p>

<p>You could have told me that in the next decade someone will break the single season home run record, someone would throw back-to-back perfect games, a woman would make it to MLB, a pitcher will beat Gibson&rsquo;s 68 ERA, the list goes on.</p>

<p>All of those things are <em>highly</em> unlikely to happen. But none of them are beyond what I would have considered &lsquo;possible&rsquo; like what Ohtani is doing.</p>

He stunk in the cactus league lol. And add onto that the traditional MLB organizational pressures to push talent into one route or the other.</p>

<p>We are blessed that the scumbag Moreno picked him up for the Angels, and basically allowed him to do whatever he wanted, for the revenue.</p>

      <label for="lnqdtpw" class="commentText"><p>Plus he’s a dominant pitcher (taking the year off to rest his arm), which is another completely different highly specialized skill. Because great basketball players are supposed to be at least competent at all aspects of the game (unlike baseball or American football players), there may not be an apt comparison.</p>

<p><a href="https://runrepeat.com/82-stats-on-dunks-in-the-nba#player-breakdown-best-dunkers" target="_blank">According to this list</a> 250 dunks in a season has only been done by Rudy Gobert,	Giannis Antetokounmpo, Dwight Howard, Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal, and DeAndre Jordan. (Since 1996)</p>

<p>250 three pointers in a season has been done by Steph Curry, James Harden, Klay Thompson, Paul George, Buddy Hield, Luka Doncic, Donte DiVincenzo, Damian Lillard, Duncan Robinson, Ray Allen, Dennis Scott, and George McCloud</p>

<p>3 pointers and home runs are both the analytical darlings of their respective sports. They are both the backbones of modern team offenses.</p>

<p>On the other hand, dunks and steals are exciting but you have other ways of getting the exact same value. A dunk and a layup are both worth 2 points. Meanwhile, a single + a stolen base is slightly worse than just hitting a double.</p>

<p>He was already a surprisingly good base runner in Anaheim, he just never focused on it.</p>

<p>I would love to see him aim for <sup>40</sup>&frasl;<sub>40</sub> as an active pitcher, now that he knows he can. But it must be very taxing. He never cracked 30 steals before, I don&rsquo;t think. It had been max low 20s? I dunno what the pitching equivalent would be in this era? 150 strikeouts and sub 3 ERA? 170 strikeouts? And it&rsquo;s hard to aim for something that isn&rsquo;t cumulative, but suppressive, and is a percentage, like ERA (and batting avg for a hitter).</p>

He came in 4th in Cy young voting in 2022, which is given to the best pitcher in the league. This year he&rsquo;s not able to pitch because of injury and he&rsquo;s one of three best hitters in the world.</p>

<p>For comparison sakes, in baseball&rsquo;s century+ history only Babe Ruth has ever done what Ohtani is doing and not to this level.</p>

<p>At times during the 2022 season he was the best pitcher and best hitter in the world. Dude is unquestionaly the most talented baseball player ever, and to me the greatest athlete I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>

      <label for="lnpm5k4" class="commentText"><p>Steals are hard to compare to other sports stats. They fluctuate from era to era of baseball. 50 steals today is a lot but not a lot for a guy like ricky henderson or guys from even earlier. No stat in basketball has varied as dramatically as steals in baseball.</p>

<p>The closest comparison is assists. Because you can’t assist <em>and</em> score, like you can’t hit a HR <em>and</em> steal a base. So I guess 30+ ppg and maybe 13 + AST</p>

They had a different definition of stolen base and they counted other things beyond what we would call a stolen base as a steal. For example, if there were a runner on first and the batter hit a single, in 1887 if the base runner went to third, that would count as a stolen base because he got more than one base on the single.</p>

      <label for="lnq0txk" class="commentText"><p>They also introduced a rule designed to help speed up the game (which had been a big focus the last couple of years) where the pitcher can only attempt to pick-off runners on base 3 times in any single at bat. That means after two attempted pick-offs, the third one either has to succeed and get the runner out, or the runner automatically is awarded the next base. This allows runners to be more aggressive on the bases because the defense have to be more picky about when to throw over.</p>

<p>Also, the pitch clock that was introduced (pitchers only have 15 seconds once play is called to actually throw their next pitch) means defense has less time to set up pickoffs and they have to focus more on the actual batter. One of the best ways to deter base stealing before was to simply hold the pitch for a long time so the runner flinches or gets tired being in his crouch for longer.</p>

<p>Not just that runner, but all base runners. So if you have a guy on 1st and 3rd, and the pitcher throws to 1st three times without picking him off, the guy on 3rd automatically scores.</p>

<p>Now imagine if the NBA instilled a rule of &ldquo;Defense can only foul a team twice per possession, after which they get an automatic 2 (or 3) points&rdquo;.  It&rsquo;d be a lot of relearning by coaches.  No more hack-a-Shaq style end of games where the last 30 seconds drags on for 30 minutes.  But on top of that, you&rsquo;re messing with the scoring, resulting in a modest inflation of numbers.  The average NBA fan will roll their eyes at it; the sports-betting companies will love it.</p>

While football and basketball arguably got more exciting due to analytics (especially football with how much high flying passing has increased), baseball has unquestionably become a worse product due to analytics. Until the last couple of years when they made rule changes to make baseball more fun to watch again, it was becoming an unwatchable sport. They forgot that they’re an entertainment product and needed to make a product that fans wanted to watch and instead optimized for the optimal way to win the sport. Stuff like the shift absolutely killed the excitement in baseball.</p>

      <label for="lnqbbc2" class="commentText"><p>It’s true that you can’t both score and get an assist, but both are natural outcomes of being the primary ball handler.  Beside being an “offensive” stat, hitting homeruns and stealing bases take place in completely different situations (I.e., you’re at the plate in one and on the bases for the other) and require two skills that are unrelated or even inversely correlated.  So, I would choose 2 “offensive” stats where one requires being a ball handler (e.g.,  points, assists, 3 points, etc.) and another where you’re not the ball handler (e.g., offensive rebound or “screen assists”).</p>

      <label for="lnpl7gf" class="commentText"><p>These are weird arbitrary cutoffs to form &ldquo;clubs&rdquo; after all 50 is nowhere near the homerun record nor is 50 anywhere near the stolen base record, it&rsquo;s only unique because of the new arbitrary threshold Ohtani is reaching with both.</p>

<p>I would say that it would be something like a player having 250 dunks and 250 3 pointers in a season. Neither anywhere close to the actual record but it&rsquo;s rather rare having one player prolific at both and those are still crazy numbers to put up individually never mind together.</p>

      <label for="lnpubb6" class="commentText"><p>I see the comparison but I think dunks aren’t relevant. A homerun is a run! A typical MLB team averages 4-5 runs a game, so a home run, even if it’s a solo shot, is a big deal. Stealing a base is a big deal.</p>

<p>A dunk is 2 points in a game where each team averages 110-115 points a game. It’s flashy but it doesn’t meaningfully contribute to the game’s outcome like an HR.</p>

<p>Given the offensive significance of HRs and stolen bases, I think a more adequate comparison would be averaging 30 points and 10 assists for a season as this highlights proficiency in two offensive areas requiring different skills.</p>

<p>Only 4 players in NBA history have done this: Westbrook, Harden, Oscar Robertson, and Tiny Archibald.</p>

<p>They’re very different sports, the stats are obviously going to very different.</p>

<p>The spirit of the category is that players who record HRs don’t typically record high numbers of SBs, and vice versa. The same is true with 3 pointers and dunks</p>

Going back the last 10 years (before I figured nobody else would be close), Lauri Markkaken got the closest in 2023 with 200 made 3s and 111 made dunks, followed by Wemby with 128 made 3s and 165 dunks.</p>

<p>Think of how far away that is from <sup>250</sup>&frasl;<sub>250</sub>, and then realize that basically no one else was even in the ballpark of it.</p>

<p><sup>250</sup>&frasl;<sub>250</sub> is so absurd that I&rsquo;m shocked /u/Uberballer is being taken remotely seriously.  There have only been 9 players in NBA history, total, who have recorded 250+ dunks (since 2000, when the stat started being tracked):  Dwight, Gobert, Shaq, Deandre Jordan (who, all 4, combined for 25 total <em>career</em> made 3s), and Giannis (who has never made even 90 3s in a season).</p>

Now add to that ~3 3-pointers per game even at a good shot rate is likely 7-8 threes per game minimum. You&rsquo;re already describing someone who is probably taking 18-20 shots per game, minimum. And almost no high enough usage player to achieve <sup>250</sup>&frasl;<sub>250</sub> is playing all 82, so we&rsquo;re in the territory of 20-30 shots or more per game. I don&rsquo;t even think this player exists anymore. The closest possible would have to be someone like Tatum or LeBron or Luka, and playing this way would probably hurt their teams lol (because if they&rsquo;re scoring like this at volume, as they all do, they will be drawing so much defensive attention that the correct play will be passing out to an open man anyway).</p>

      <label for="lnqil4z" class="commentText"><p>One of the craziest things about Ohtani&rsquo;s steals is that he&rsquo;s doing it with insane efficiency.  He&rsquo;s only getting caught on 7.7% of attempts.  If you take all of the players (minus Ohtani) with 30+ steals this year and look at how often they get caught, it&rsquo;s 24.81%, Elly De La Cruz is getting caught 20% of the time, and prime Ricky Henderson (80-91) got caught 18% of the time.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like if a basketball player averaged 10 assists per game with only .5 turnovers.</p>

<p>You want a combination of skills that rarely go together. Speed + Power &ndash;&amp;gt; Outside Shooting + Interior Defense</p>

<p>There have been 20 seasons ever where a player had 100 3PM + 100 Blocks, but no one has ever gotten <sup>200</sup>&frasl;<sub>200</sub>. Brook Lopez&rsquo;s 2018-2019 season was the closest ever with <sup>187</sup>&frasl;<sub>179</sub> in 2019.</p>

<p>Wemby and Chet have both got to be strong candidates to do this at some point in their careers.</p>

<p>MVP means you surpassed the rest of league in some ways. If he got MVP other years but not one with stats that are outliers across decades, that&rsquo;s ironic enough.</p>

<p>The thing about SB and HRs is they’re very conflicting Abilities so to have Power &amp; Speed at the absolute best of the best level is what makes it such an unobtainable record.</p>

<p>This would be comparable to like 2016 Steph Curry but he also wins DPOY. But then Ohtani is a Top 5 pitcher in the MLB aswell and doing all this while rehabbing a elbow injury.</p>

<p>So it’s like that same 2016 Steph curry could Dunk and jump out the gym but he’s just taking it easy that year rehabbing his knee. So it’s almost like you spent the entire season forgetting he could even do that. 😂</p>

<p>Acuna had an offensive WAR of 8.5 to Ohtani&rsquo;s 7.4 this year, which is tied for 5th. Aaron Judge has an offensive WAR of 9.8. Judge is objectively having an MUCH better season that Shohei.</p>

      <label for="lnpxym5" class="commentText"><p>Since it’s an offensive stat, Maybe 200 dunks and 225 threes?</p>

<p>Roughly 13ppg over a course of 82 games off of just dunks and threes.</p>

<p>Only 80 times has a player hit at least 225 threes in a season. The official record for dunks is a bit over 300 by Rudy Gobert.</p>

<p>You would need to be an elite slasher and perimeter threat for this to happen, similar to being a slugger and a sneaky base runner.</p>

      <label for="lnqfrlw" class="commentText"><p>I think leading the league in rebounds and 3&rsquo;s made seems like the most historic combo. Or maybe blocks and 3&rsquo;s made? I think something combining a big man skill and a guard skill would be most unprecedented. Players like Russ have already had 30 point 10 assist seasons and Luka/Harden have had gaudy offensive seasons too (same with Trae). But I think leading the league in rebounds AND 3&rsquo;s made would be highly impressive, and damn near impossible.</p>

      <label for="lnste4z" class="commentText"><p>Your post is pretty disrepectful to Ronald Acuna with the way you referred to him.</p>

<p>Acuna is a generational talent who if he didn’t get into unlucky injuries would be on pace for like a <sup>400</sup>&frasl;<sub>400</sub> career, which no one has ever done. He might still get there even with 2 torn ACLs. </p>
