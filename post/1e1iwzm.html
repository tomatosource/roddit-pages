<p>Last year&rsquo;s World Cup champions Germany have announced their final 12-man roster for the Paris Olympics, with two changes being made when compared to the World Cup winning squad. Justus Hollatz and David Kramer will be replaced by the Bayern Munich duo of Oscar da Silva and Nick Weiler-Babb.</p>

<p>The roster is led by the World Cup MVP and Nets point guard Dennis Schroder, the Magic duo of Franz and Moritz Wagner, and the Pelicans new signing Daniel Theis.</p>

<p>Every single other player on the roster is playing for a Euroleague team, which, in addition to Oscar da Silva and Nick Weiler-Babb includes, Isaac Bonga (Partizan Belgrade), Maodo Lo (Milano), Andreas Obst and Niels Giffey (Bayern Munich), while Johannes Voigtmann and Johannes Thiemann spent the last season playing for Milano and Alba Berlin respectively.</p>

<p>Thunder&rsquo;s new signing Isaiah Hartenstein and Mavericks forward Maxi Kleber weren&rsquo;t selected for the extended roster, despite being eligible.</p>

<p>Germany will be in the same group as France, Brazil and Japan at the Paris Olympics.</p>

<p>Hartenstein seems like he could be a big addition for them and it also seems like he wants to play, wonder why he is never is consideration?</p>

      <label for="lcuefnc" class="commentText"><p>Germany&rsquo;s head coach Gordon Herbert had a three-year commitment plan in place, so the players first had to commit to play at the EuroBasket in 2022 and the World Cup in 2023, if they wanted to be selected to the Paris Olympics.</p>

<p>Hartenstein didn&rsquo;t commit to play at the previous two competitions, so there&rsquo;s that, and he said himself that he didn&rsquo;t think there was a chance that he&rsquo;d be selected to Germany&rsquo;s Olympic roster, despite expressing an interest to play for them, and there&rsquo;s also the fact that his wife gave birth to their son recently.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s a mix of those two, he stated that he talked to Herbert and that they agreed that it would be best if he skipped this year.</p>

<p>Kleber didn&rsquo;t play at the 2022 EuroBasket and has beef with Germany&rsquo;s captain Schroder, who called him out on it, leading him to not wanting to play at last year&rsquo;s World Cup as the result.</p>

<p>Gordon Herbert said that he&rsquo;ll be stepping down as Germany&rsquo;s head coach after these Olympics, so he&rsquo;s looking at new coaching jobs already, mainly focused on club coaching.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s won them the bronze at the EuroBasket in 2022 and the gold at last year&rsquo;s World Cup, him not being Germany&rsquo;s head coach after these Olympics is entirely his decision.</p>

      <label for="lcuiodc" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I feel like for American NBA fans it feels rarer than it is for a basketball national team coach to also not be coaching club at the same time.  So many nations have NBA coaches doing the job on a part time basis that we don&rsquo;t notice the Pesic types with no other job (or every soccer national team coach).</p>

<p>Although even as far as European national team coaches go the only guy a lot of NBA fans hear about is Collet because he was double jobbing as Wemby&rsquo;s tutor at both club and country level.</p>
