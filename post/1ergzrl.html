    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Just a post-hoop session discussion my friends and I were having about Tatum. We were speculating what the Tatum “revenge” season looked like and his potential for an MVP.</p>

<p>Tatum is obviously an elite two-way wing and one of the most versatile players in the league. However, I just don’t see the Kawhi/PG/Tatum archetype winning MVP. Not when you have heliocentric players like Luka and Jokic who can put up 30-10-10 with regularity. Then you have your bigs like Giannis and Embiid who can go 35/15/5 on a given night. Shai had a great campaign last year, but he’s got the ball way more than a wing.</p>

<p>Advanced stats are becoming more appreciated, but a lot of voters are gonna be looking at the base statistics. And 27/7/4 with great defensive metrics don’t seem to hit the  same.</p>

      <label for="lhypj7s" class="commentText"><p>Cause shockingly enough an individuals defensive contributions mean very little compared to offensive contributions.</p>

<p>Its a team sport where defense is more about hustle and good defensive schemes, rather than an individual player (as long as you arent a generational defender like Bill Russel or Wemby seems nowadays).</p>

<p>And at the level of a guy like JT, its obviously gonna be an afterthought cause his defense cant ever make up for him shooting sub 40%.</p>

<p>Unlike if he was also an excelent playmaker, where youd at least be able to set up plays.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I agree with this. I think the bigger problem is that defensive contributions are just much harder to quantify. Since there aren&rsquo;t easy numbers for voters to reference they just don&rsquo;t put any real weight into it.</p>

      <label for="lhyr7kp" class="commentText"><p>While true, irs just a fact that an individuals defensive contributions can rarely match an offensive contribution of offensive minded players due to the very nature of defense in this sport.</p>

<p>Of course you are right, but keep in mind that the primary goal of the sport is to score more than your opponents.</p>

<p>Another issue is that often its hard to tell whether its a player shooting badly or a defenders great defense that is the cause for missed shots.</p>

<p>Same goes for turnovers and the difrenc ebetween one player playing bad and the defender guarding them well.</p>

<p>You can say it goes vice versa, but guys still have to be able to make the shot and no defense is bad enough in the NBA to allow for free points.</p>

      <label for="lhys623" class="commentText"><p>I tend to agree that offensive contributions have more overall impact, but I still wouldn&rsquo;t downplay how much of an impact a great defender can have. I feel like MVP voters look at it as 90:10 offense to defense when I think its probably should be more like 60:40.</p>

<p>I think this is especially important for individual awards because being an elite 2 way player is extremely rare. More often than not when a player is asked to carry a heavy offensive load their defense struggles greatly. Players that are able to carry both ends of the floor deserve a lot of credit for doing so.</p>

<p>Ultimately it seems like the MVP is more of an offensive player of the year award than anything. There is a DPOY award, so fair enough I suppose.</p>

<p>But I believe that’s unlikely. His shot selection has always been pretty poor and he’s not made an all defense team yet.</p>

<p>At this present moment what’s the argument for him over players like Embiid, Jokic, Giannis. Thats not to mention younger players like Luka and Shai who are probably due one at this point. Those 5 seem insurmountable to me.</p>

      <label for="lhyx791" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t know if I ever see Tatum winning one. He&rsquo;s a great player because he&rsquo;s really good at everything and the kinda frame that allows him to regularly guard 3 positions and all 5 on spurts. Which again is great but I don&rsquo;t think he has any of the wow factor required for MVP and I don&rsquo;t know if he has another level he can reach.</p>

      <label for="lhyxib4" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not the counting stats that&rsquo;s keeping Tatum from an MVP.</p>

<p>Part of it is that at times, like you know, the playoffs, he doesn&rsquo;t even make a convincing case for being the best player on his own team.</p>

<p>And part of it is that his defense isn&rsquo;t actually at peak Kawhi level. Tatum is a damn good defender, but he&rsquo;s not actually great.</p>
