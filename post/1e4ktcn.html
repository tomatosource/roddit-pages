      <label for="ldfypk0" class="commentText"><p>Sure, this is true. However let&rsquo;s look at the human aspect and understand the amount of pressure and scrutiny Bronny is facing. To have everything you do put under a microscope and to be shit on day in and day out as a kid destroyed your mental health, despite the wealth. Wealthy people still kill themselves, wealthy people still suffer from depression. Hopefully he gets better, and if not hopefully he can understand your perspective and be okay with it. But it ain&rsquo;t easy being him rn</p>

      <label for="ldg3bfs" class="commentText"><p>Yep, 100% that&rsquo;s the right way to look at the perspective. When you have money, you just adjust the goal posts of what is normal for you. Life goes on as it otherwise would, although sure, it&rsquo;s nice to have stuff. Bronny is absolutely living with and feeling a lot of pressure right now, and that can&rsquo;t be easy. He is probably feeling like a fraud. I agree, I hope if he fails he can come to terms with it and continue to just be happy being himself in life, even if he can&rsquo;t have the basketball world at his feet like his Dad did.</p>

LeBron may believe he&rsquo;s doing this to prop up his family, but this was clearly for himself. They&rsquo;ve already got generational wealth with or without Bronny&rsquo;s NBA money , his contract is a drop in the bucket.  Any father with an ounce of self-awareness would have known this was a likely outcome to the nepo baby path that he chose.  I just feel bad for Bronny in all this. He&rsquo;s the only sympathetic figure and somehow is taking all the criticism that should be aimed elsewhere</p>

      <label for="ldg34ar" class="commentText"><p>From the little I know, LeBron seems to be a great family man, and I applaud this. But he put this public pressure to play together on bronny for years now, when he was officially a minor, and imagining a 19 y.o. growing in the shadow of one the most famous athletes in the world, it&rsquo;s hard to expect that he could just said &ldquo;no&rdquo; to his dad. So on this subject Lebron has been unfair to Bronny.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Millions of children are over 18 but still have their lives dictated by their parents. There are 19-year-olds in college going to med school because that&rsquo;s what their parents want; others are pursuing acting, sports, etc., all under the direction of their parents, still having their lives fully dictated.</p>

<p>Just because he&rsquo;s over 18 doesn&rsquo;t mean he has any control over his life, and the crucial part of being raised by someone who controls your entire life is that you never learn how to get out of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Somehow twisting NBA fans clowning on a professional athlete into LeBron being a bad parent is fucking embarrassing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But Lebron IS a bad parent even if all of this is his son&rsquo;s doing. Letting your kid bully other teams by threatening to not play if they draft him is bad. Period. Any halfway decent parent would have shut that down.</p>

<p>If they wanted to play together it&rsquo;s really easy to do. Just say, &ldquo;I want to play with my son; please do not draft him.&rdquo; Nobody would have drafted him because pissing off a legend is hella stupid and would be five million times worse bad press, and Bronny isn&rsquo;t worth it in the first place.</p>

<p>But instead, they went about it the shitty way, and that&rsquo;s a big problem.</p>

      <label for="ldgcdwz" class="commentText"><p>I think it’s pretty consistent with what he seems to stand for though. Nike is a humongous exploitive organization that makes money off of the image of black athletes and shitty labour practices abroad. Bronny is a young black man trying to make his own name in the world faced with disproportionate criticism for doing so. He probably doesn’t want this to contribute to that.</p>

<p>It was a fine and honest comment to say in a private conversation. It’s now being used as validation for Bronny hate and to make Brown look like a hater. I don’t blame him for nipping it in the bud.</p>

It’s embarrassing that Lebron and the Lakers are doing this to his son and the fans. It’s embarrassing to support this team. It’s just a flat out fucking embarrassment that will only get worse when we’re 0-6 and they finally get this completely inorganic and orchestrated moment for a player that’s not even the GOAT.</p>

By saying that Bronny has all of the tools around him to be successful, it is also saying that if he’s NOT successful then we can’t blame lack of support.  Bronny has had all of the best trainers, facilities, shooting coaches available and he is still not in a place to contribute to a NBA team.</p>

<p>His heart condition may have derailed his freshman year but what is the excuse for his high school career?  At no point was Bronny seen as a dominant high school player or can’t miss NBA prospect outside of his name.</p>

      <label for="ldggiax" class="commentText"><p>You know what irks me so hard about it. Its just his opinion in the literal 4 summer league games Bronny has had. He&rsquo;s not even throwing shade.</p>

<p>That was a private conversation and theres literally no need to blow this up. If anything JB and all the other guys in rhe league want the future generation to be successful as them or even more successful so I dont get why media and everyone is going nuts about this.</p>

      <label for="ldgmeyq" class="commentText"><p>I feel like Lebrons real focus is on grooming Bronny to be his GM when he buys into a team after his playing days are through. Having a year or two on an NBA roster as a player will give Bronny unique insight/credibility as Lebron’s GM down the line. I could see Bronny retiring due to ‘health concerns’ or something like that whenever his pops hangs it up, if not before…not hating on Bronny, will be interesting to see how it plays out🤷‍♂️</p>
