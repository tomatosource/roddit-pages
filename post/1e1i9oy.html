He could’ve definitely been a lot more effective had he been more healthy, Heatles might also not break up. Their first year might’ve been a championship. There’s just too many might. He could’ve helped a lot more before getting to the finals, so they would have plenty of rest.</p>

<p>Roy and Oden definitely would’ve had a much better career. The way Rose played… his body would’ve caught up sooner or later. That’s what I thought about Oladipo too.. and it happened. Ja needs to learn how to land properly if he wants to prolong his career. Something LeBron learned.</p>

He had it removed because apparently he was advised that was the “quicker” recovery, not knowing it would damage his career in the long run.

      <label for="lcuc78a" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m still not sure we have a great answer for this one.</p>

<p>I underwent microfracture surgery and discovered that it&rsquo;s typically not the operation itself that leads to follow-up problems. Rather, it&rsquo;s the operation&rsquo;s unsteady ability to fix the problems that existed in the first place.</p>

<p>In my case, I had a cartilage defect in my left knee after years of basketball wear-and-tear; a pothole in my cartilage, basically. Microfracture was the process of trying to induce my body to fill that pothole on its own. The catch is two-fold: sometimes your body doesn&rsquo;t want to re-grow cartilage <em>and</em> the cartilage that regrows is different from the original cartilage you lost (like a cartilage-scar tissue hybrid).</p>

<p>In my case, the cartilage didn&rsquo;t fully regrow, so the defect wasn&rsquo;t fixed. But it wasn&rsquo;t the operation itself that created the issue; it just didn&rsquo;t solve the issue.</p>

<p>More recently, I underwent an OATS operation, which is basically a cartilage transplant. Instead of relying on my body to grow new cartilage on its own, the cartilage is planted right in there off the bat. The word I&rsquo;ve gathered is that some surgeons are seeing better results with this technique but I&rsquo;m too early in the process to know what&rsquo;s what.</p>

<p>To highlight the struggle we still have with these sorts of injuries - Lonzo Ball is one of the more recent candidates to have undergone OATS in hopes of bouncing back. Basically, I&rsquo;m just not sure we have a great &amp; fully reliable answer for holes in cartilage the way we do for, say, fixing ACLs.</p>

      <label for="lcujvow" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m only about three weeks into recovery so I can&rsquo;t draw too many conclusions but I&rsquo;ll say so far, so good. I&rsquo;m non-weight-bearing for at least six weeks and limited to 90-degree flexion for the time being but all things considered, it seems things are on the right track.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll say this, I had a follow-up x-ray last week which showed the defect successfully patched so that was pretty promising. Considering the defect never fully filled following microfracture surgery the year prior, I&rsquo;ll take that.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll also say that compared to microfracture, OATS felt minimally invasive - at least the version I had. Three little arthroscopic incisions was all that was required, whereas last year they had a chunk of my leg splayed open (I&rsquo;ve heard there could be some OATS procedures that require that but mine did not). So for all intents and purposes, yeah, I feel like I&rsquo;m on the right path but we&rsquo;ll have to see where it goes.</p>

<p>I’m 3 weeks from my meniscus repair and already back to ~ 80%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny, when I initially injured my leg, my physical therapist mentioned that my symptoms seemed to be consistent with a meniscus injury, which she said was a pretty routine, in-and-out procedure, as you can likely attest. So I remember rolling into my post-MRI appointment feeling pretty good about life, expecting the doc to be like, &ldquo;Alright, we need to fix up that meniscus right quick, no big deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead, he pointed to my MRI and was like, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a condral defect there so a microfracture procedure should go ahead and fix that up.&rdquo; I remember panicking and being like, &ldquo;But Amar&rsquo;e&hellip; Penny&hellip; Oden&hellip;&rdquo; but doc assured me my defect was small enough to be readily fixable whereas NBA players often have cartilage damage way too significant to be reliably repaired by microfracture.</p>

<p>Alas, my cartilage didn&rsquo;t regrow even biocartilage, plasma infusion, and whatever else led to them opening me up and stapling me closed.</p>

<p>Pertaining to OATS, I think there&rsquo;s a few ways they can approach it. They&rsquo;d mentioned donor cartilage via cadaver but they ended up being able to utilize cartilage from a non-load bearing portion of my own knee, perhaps behind my kneecap. Their take was that the body utilizing its own cartilage is one less variable to account for.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you plan on playing basketball again?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last year, in the lead up to microfracture, I would have said yes. And even now, I&rsquo;d still love to. But there&rsquo;s also a part of me that might be more open to a path forward without basketball, especially since I already had to kind of make that adjustment during the COVID years, when leagues shut down, my open gyms closed, etc.</p>

<p>The thing I find myself thinking about now is, even if OATS is a success, am I—as a 40-year-old now—going to be able to return to the hardwood and be anything even vaguely close to what I&rsquo;ve been for the preceding 25 years or so? And I know the answer is likely no; I&rsquo;m a guy who feasted on my fellow locals by being faster, more athletic, etc.</p>

<p>So now I find myself weighing things out. Do I go back to the game to be a shell of myself and maybe put undue strain on my surgically repaired knee? Or do I delve even deeper into my supplementary activities like hiking, biking, climbing, and skating? I think I&rsquo;m ready and prepared for either reality, but I miss the game dearly.</p>

Think we would see him go lower on the draft and or even be a later pick the year after, with a longer peak as his athleticism wouldn&rsquo;t be as sapped in his later years. He might not have won a ring with Shaq and formed the Heatles with Lebron in this case. Not only his own journey but quite a few other great players&rsquo; trajectory would&rsquo;ve been changed.</p>

<p>At least with so many of the guys mentioned in this thread, they still had legacies. Larry Bird, Penny, Walton, Grant Hill, T-Mac, Bernard King. Even modern guys like Brandon Roy and Derrick Rose.</p>

<p>Ruland never got that chance. But this dude was a <em>monster</em>. Top 10 in MVP voting, certified 20 &amp; 10, going to toe-to-toe with Moses, the Celtics, etc. Without hyperbole, he was trending as a potential Hall of Famer before the injuries hit.</p>

<p>Let me be clear, he wasn&rsquo;t prime Arvydas Sabonis, but they were cut from similar cloths. Those two and someone like Nikola Jokic all exist on the same family tree.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzhHBd_V7hA" target="_blank">Ruland dropping 37 on Moses</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_2T0n6pSLc&amp;t=2s" target="_blank">Ruland dropped 28 and 14 on the mid-80s Celtics</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvMOxwwZzKQ" target="_blank">Ruland going coast-to-coast</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOiLFEya6Sg" target="_blank">Ruland going coast-to-coast again</a></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/p5HEYiGz514" target="_blank">Mixtape</a></p>

<p>Rarely has someone who was so dominant in the post-merger era been so readily forgotten due to injury. And with modern medicinal intervention, I honestly think the sky would have been the limit with this guy.</p>

<p>In that same line-of-thinking, Len Bias probably would have been taken care more not leading to his overdose, Reggie Lewis hearth condition could have been managed a bit better, and those two factor could have contributed to have a better second half of Bird&rsquo;s career.</p>

      <label for="lcuyuwv" class="commentText"><p>Every former player would be oodles better with access to modern medicine and training. Most retired because they just didn&rsquo;t treat themselves right. Imagine if Jordan treated himself to million dollar treatment like Lebron. On the flip, feather weights of today would&rsquo;ve crumbled without the modernizations. Think KD, Chet, Curry, Wemby, etc.</p>
