<p>I agree. It doesn&rsquo;t give you a free pass to cry to the refs, and he deserves the criticism for that.</p>

<p>But there are way too many people who are claiming that Luka isn&rsquo;t injured at all and is &ldquo;faking&rdquo; an injury, which is just completely insane. He is clearly hobbled and is taking pain shots before every game.</p>

<p>Big Z was a horrible rim protector he was the biggest reason the Cavs never won anything lmfao. The Spurs scored every time they needed to with the Parker/Duncan pick and roll. Big Z&rsquo;s minutes were cut in the finals because how bad it was killing the Cavs.</p>

      <label for="l8kjpc9" class="commentText"><p>Even before getting his team to the finals, he was still arguably the MVP.</p>

<p>Being banged up doesn’t give you a free pass, but players who are and tend to get injured and not play get touch superstar foul calls that Luka doesn’t get. LBJ and Embiid, and large as those guys are (Luka ain’t small either), they seem to initiate contact every drive, occasionally bowling over the defender, and get foul calls in their favor damn near every time while Luka is still usually not getting the call. If I can call non-superstar vs superstar consistency fair, then fine. Luka is clearly a superstar though next to Embiid, so why not him? NBA might be afraid Luka breaks the game.</p>

<p>And this is what stacks on top of what Brunson said: sometimes they call it sometimes they don’t. That’s beyond silly and annoying when you’re trying to get better at something: your ability to understand and control things gets the better of you.</p>

<p>Moving on offense != moving on defense. Different skills, different muscles, ect. It is harder on many levels to defend than to attack.</p>

<p>Luka needs to be better on defense, but the issue is not effort nor is it conditioning. It&rsquo;s frustration/mental mistakes, and injuries. Criticize him all you want for the former but I don&rsquo;t care to see much criticism of his effort.</p>

His movement is off on offense but he just still has other ways to score/facilitate and the team has no other option than for him to keep trying which even for elite healthy players that aren’t “fat” wears them down by the end of the game at that volume. People really should be talking about how good the Celtics are but that’s not how the internet works sadly so here we are finding weird stuff to hate on like him barely not getting his foot all the way down as a player barrels into him with elbow out. See I can slip into it too lol.</p>

The bad defense is definitely at a different level than before. Most of it is injury. Some of it is conditioning. Some of it is that he clearly doesn’t prioritize improving that part of his game.</p>

<p>He’s young and this will be a formative experience for him. I’d bet we see a better version of him next year.</p>

<p>Kyrie certainly was a great 2nd offensive weapon and was a pressure release valve, but Luka absolutely carried this team to the finals. Did you conveniently forget all the games Kyrie was weak? He averaged 16 points in the 2nd round…Luka has consistently been the best player by far on the Mavs, and hell even in the playoffs as a whole. Great players are allowed to have scattered bad games..</p>

He has been the best player for Dallas in every playoffs series. In fact, he has probably been the best player even when we compare Dallas and their opponent team in the playoffs up to this point. Despite being banged up we can argue he is still the best player in the finals. Boston just has too many weapons. For Dallas to win both Kyrie and Luka need to go crazy in the same game. That hasn&rsquo;t happened. Kyrie had 2 bad games. Luka had foul trouble in the last one.</p>

      <label for="l8lcdpy" class="commentText"><p>I agree, I don’t think the whining and fouling is the issue - part of winning the finals is getting to that point and being conditioned enough to perform at the highest level that deep into the season. I think if there is anything Luka should take away from this run, it is the importance of conditioning.</p>

      <label for="l8lcnfp" class="commentText"><p>At some point everyone has to realize that nobody watches every game. Not you, not me, definitely not that analyst on TV, not the announcer. Nobody. I can say I have watched every Luka game this year, about half in person. He’s like 60% right now, his game just translates very well without mobility (shocker).  The problem with his complaining is that he’s right most of the time, and so he seems to justify it in that way. He needs to have a shift in his mind that being right isn’t as important as being back on defense. When he’s healthy his defense is average to decent at best. When he’s unhealthy and complaining he gives up way too many points complaining and letting his team go 4v5. I’m really hoping that this beat down on the biggest stage is his wake up moment. I think we may see if that’s the case or not tonight.</p>

<p>At the end of the day the reason doesn&rsquo;t matter. He&rsquo;s hurting his team more than he&rsquo;s helping them. If your superstar player is a net negative in the finals that&rsquo;s a very bad sign for you.</p>

<p>All these people keep praising his offense&hellip;.and where has that gotten them? 0-3. If you don&rsquo;t see how he literally sabotaged his team in game 3 then I don&rsquo;t think you even watch basketball.</p>

<p>This dumb motherfucker tried to take a charge with 5 fouls in a 3 point game in the last 5 mins of the game. Wtf is that.</p>

<p>He’s scoring at will against one of the best set of guard defenders I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>They’re down 3-0 because beyond Luka and Kyrie they have a cobbled together roster and the Cs have one of the best rosters in the salary cap era. But I wouldn’t get it twisted. Luka is an incredible talent and he has absolutely been carrying Dallas. They would never have pulled close in any of these games without him.</p>

He&rsquo;s trash and he&rsquo;s getting massively exposed right now. IDC about how good he is offensively (he is amazing). It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it doesn&rsquo;t lead to wind. He lost the game by not playing? Oh yeah well who&rsquo;s fault is it that he fouled out? He is the one who made it so he couldn&rsquo;t play in the last 4 mins. He&rsquo;s a net negative. Offense, defense, demeanor, game awareness. It all counts and the only thing he&rsquo;s positive in is offense.</p>

<p>To me, he’s a net positive. They’re better off with him playing than not. That explains why he’s playing while he’s not 100%.</p>

<p>It’s not enough for them to be winning. Of course he deserves criticism for that. But I don’t think “if you’re so hurt that it’s tough to play defense then don’t play” is a valid response while he’s still performing dramatically better than whoever would replace him.</p>

It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re getting completely blown out. They&rsquo;ve been close in every game. His lapses are the reason they are losing given the present situation. Yes he&rsquo;s the reason they&rsquo;re even there in the first place but who cares? That&rsquo;s the past. In the current situation the team has been enough to get close and he has not stepped up when he needed to. I don&rsquo;t buy the excuses.</p>

Luka is supremely overrated as an overall player and being a great offensive player clearly doesn&rsquo;t cut it in the finals and this is proving that.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t say he&rsquo;s their entire team and then not blame him when they lose especially given how much of an impact he had to then losing. Games 1 and 2 he was still a positive for them. Game 3 is absolutely on him. Kyrie showed up. He didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s he gonna say lol, &ldquo;Embiid&rsquo;s a bum that crashes in the 4th and flames out in the second round every year?&rdquo; yeah right bro can you imagine the sports media HURRICANE 🤣 Players do respect Embiid because they know how hard it is to stop him firsthand, dude&rsquo;s a giant and you gotta watch out because he&rsquo;s gonna be out there spinning and barreling into you with the force of a small grizzly bear. Maybe Brunson also feels a particular affinity with him as a fellow free throw merchant. Imagine if they teamed up, the Ornstein and Smough of free throw mercantilism.</p>

It’s wild how quick the media and fans are to cut down a young player after a couple performances. Happened to Ant in the WCF and now is happening to Luka in the Finals.

Catching so much heat for his shot not falling, despite being great at all other things basically. Sometimes your botlane is 12-2 in lane, you just gotta sit under tower, ward, farm, focus on objectives and build tanky. Luka&rsquo;s problem is his botlane is also feeding their ass off</p>

Many people see this and believe Jalen is making excuses for Luka - which he kind of is. There have been plenty of grown men in the Finals before Luka who did not bitch and complain nonstop about every single call, it does not mean they weren&rsquo;t just as emotional. Instead of offering constructive criticism while maintaining empathy, Jalen is just flat-out excusing Luka&rsquo;s poor behavior</p>

      <label for="l8kvz7z" class="commentText"><p>I get the game is emotional but Luka bitches to the refs non stop in games that aren&rsquo;t the NBA finals.  He&rsquo;s absolutely insufferable with them and it doesn&rsquo;t matter if the game is in June or December.  Its the same shit.</p>

<p>Luka is a fantastic offensive player, but he&rsquo;s pretty damn awful on defense.  It&rsquo;s notable what Dallas has done to have a good defense with Luka being a part of it because he&rsquo;s such a weak link.  Basketball is always going to be a sport where offense gets the most shine, but you can&rsquo;t understate how much the other 4 players on his team are doing when they are covering for just how bad he is on the defensive end.</p>

<p>Luka is an absolutely phenomenal player on the offensive end, but there are a ton of signs that he doesn&rsquo;t have the mental strength needed at this point in his career.  Whether he develops that remains to be seen and there&rsquo;s obviously nothing that says he cant, but lets not forget that this is the same guy who had a fan ejected for some nonsense earlier in the year, constantly lets fans get in his head, and can&rsquo;t learn to play through what he usually incorrectly perceives as bad calls.  There&rsquo;s undeniable incredible talent and ability that Luka possesses but there&rsquo;s also undeniable deficiencies that have been on full display for a long time.</p>

I don&rsquo;t think the criticism of Luka&rsquo;s unfair compared to any other star offensive player that gets hunted relentlessly on defense and is down big in a series, but what&rsquo;s Brunson going to say? You ask him about criticism of any player and I think the response would be similar. He&rsquo;s a pro and a nice guy - doubt he&rsquo;d give a &ldquo;brutally honest&rdquo; take even if he had one.</p>

The fact that Luka is hobbled, no matter what fuck all effort he gives on defense, is going to hamper him defensively - and he&rsquo;s already deficient in the things that make a good defender in the NBA. What do you want Luka to do defensively then? I bet it&rsquo;s gonna be something you heard from your lord Stephen A Smith or something.</p>

      <label for="l8koa8l" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not angry at all, you don&rsquo;t need to sound so upset. Not everyone needs to be brutally honest or a shitty hot take artist and a former teammate and current player saying nice things about a beleaguered player is&hellip;nice. But I&rsquo;m not sure why it&rsquo;d move the needle on opinions on Luka&rsquo;s play. On the flip side (using your example), SAS might have incessant hot takes (I don&rsquo;t know what his current takes are, but his basketball takes are godawful in general) but that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d expect from a shitty talking head - it shouldn&rsquo;t move the needle either.</p>

<p>If you watch Luka play and don&rsquo;t see the issue with how he doesn&rsquo;t rotate and looks lost after getting blown by because he doesn&rsquo;t position himself properly, I don&rsquo;t know what to do for you, but Jalen Brunson saying criticism for it is unfair doesn&rsquo;t make it so.</p>

      <label for="l8lb9hp" class="commentText"><p>Bro. Again how thick can you get. He does the rotate and look lost after getting blown by is because HE IS FUCKING INJURED. Bad knee, bad ankle, having pain shots to his chest. He’s working enough on offense as it is because his supporting cast just wilted under Celtics D. Watch his first two rounds before he got injured again. He was decent enough on D. I don’t know what to do for you either, you might be being intentionally dense or you might just be like that by default, and it’s not even an excuse for him. It’s a fact that his bad D looks even worse because he’s injured.</p>

Luka has always been a bad defender so why on Earth is anyone acting like this is somehow the result of an injury?  Luka can move well enough to score like crazy on the offensive end but somehow the injury only rears its head on defense?</p>

      <label for="l8laaya" class="commentText"><p>This is the reason why this sub is so fucking stupid. He can move well enough on the offensive end because its what they need him to do, and his offensive play style does not depend so much on him moving fast or quick enough but using deceleration, strength and shooting. Is it that hard really to understand that because of his injury he can’t move laterally or slide his feet as much. I know he was a bad defender before. He showed enough effort there on the first two rounds but he got injured in between the OKC and MIN series. Now, he could give full effort on defense but his offense will suffer so much just so that he can make everyone happy, but then again, that’s not what they need from him.</p>

Outscoring your opponents only works if you actually are able to stop them from scoring at some point.  Luka is the reason why Dallas can&rsquo;t stop Boston enough so to say they don&rsquo;t need defense from him is laughable.  Yes, Luka&rsquo;s offense is valuable but to just write off the other side of the court and his deficiencies there are something they don&rsquo;t need from him is pure LOL.</p>

<p>He looked better in previous series because those teams weren&rsquo;t as good as Boston.  There&rsquo;s no where for Luka to hid against the Celtics.</p>
