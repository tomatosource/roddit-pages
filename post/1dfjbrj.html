<p>I agree. It doesn&rsquo;t give you a free pass to cry to the refs, and he deserves the criticism for that.</p>

<p>But there are way too many people who are claiming that Luka isn&rsquo;t injured at all and is &ldquo;faking&rdquo; an injury, which is just completely insane. He is clearly hobbled and is taking pain shots before every game.</p>

The amount of people who said Tatum wasn&rsquo;t a winner even though he&rsquo;s been to like 5 conference finals and 1 finals before this was just absurd. Of course Luka is a winning player! He carried in a bunch of playoff series that his team won. He doesn&rsquo;t have a ring at age 25 or whatever, but he is clearly a winning player. It&rsquo;s maddening that so many people suggest otherwise!</p>

<p>It was also the playoff year of Baron “Fucking” Davis that I will never get over as a Mavs fan.</p>

<p>Moving on offense != moving on defense. Different skills, different muscles, ect. It is harder on many levels to defend than to attack.</p>

<p>Luka needs to be better on defense, but the issue is not effort nor is it conditioning. It&rsquo;s frustration/mental mistakes, and injuries. Criticize him all you want for the former but I don&rsquo;t care to see much criticism of his effort.</p>

In Game 2, which is the one he was listed as questionable to play in leading up to the game, he was moving like a stiff 45 year old man at the Y who&rsquo;s still recovering from his last run 3 days ago. He was slow and ginger and careful and obviously consciously limiting himself in what kind of movements he made and what kind of attacks he employed. The fact that he was still able to put up 32-11-11 in that state (with 4 steals!) just speaks to what a generational talent he is.</p>

His movement is off on offense but he just still has other ways to score/facilitate and the team has no other option than for him to keep trying which even for elite healthy players that aren’t “fat” wears them down by the end of the game at that volume. People really should be talking about how good the Celtics are but that’s not how the internet works sadly so here we are finding weird stuff to hate on like him barely not getting his foot all the way down as a player barrels into him with elbow out. See I can slip into it too lol.</p>

The bad defense is definitely at a different level than before. Most of it is injury. Some of it is conditioning. Some of it is that he clearly doesn’t prioritize improving that part of his game.</p>

<p>He’s young and this will be a formative experience for him. I’d bet we see a better version of him next year.</p>

      <label for="l8ljwvk" class="commentText"><p>Conditioning is definitely a large part of it. Do y&rsquo;all remember like 20 games in last season when Luka admitted to the media during a slump that he was feeling exhausted? Has he made any noticeable changes in his diet or workout regiment?</p>

<p>He really does need to lose like 15-20 pounds this offseason. I know people argue that his weight helps him get inside, but the man can hit impossible fadeaways like no one else. He&rsquo;ll be fine, there&rsquo;s really no way to defend it. If Luka wants to play at an elite level in his mid 30s, he really needs to change some stuff up. It may take him 2 years to do it, but if he can replace those 15-20 pounds of fat and convert it to muscle, he&rsquo;ll be deadly.</p>

      <label for="l8lsrkn" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s definitely been a trend that&rsquo;s only getting worse each season. He was fine his rookie year and tolerable his 2nd year. I&rsquo;ve always thought that Luka has the worst body language in the NBA, even worse than Lebron. He&rsquo;s one of the most exciting players to watch on offense in a long time and it&rsquo;s the reason why I watch a LOT of Mavs games. Everyone is laughing and high fiving but as soon as things aren&rsquo;t completely going his way, it all falls apart.</p>

<p>Luka could be my favorite player but his non-existent leadership and constant bitching at refs (which seems to be every other game I watch) always makes me question if he actually can be an all time great. Yes, Lebron was always a crybaby (I&rsquo;m a Lebron hater) but even he was never this bad until late into his career, which I sort of give him the &ldquo;Im too old for this shit&rdquo; pass.</p>

Those things are true of this series, his defense is probably one of the top drivers of why they can’t win in this series, and the complaining really was only materially relevant this past game.</p>

<p>But those things can be true this series wand he still could have carried the Mavs through the playoffs leading up to the finals.</p>

      <label for="l8lywo0" class="commentText"><p>The top driver really is that Kyrie didn’t show up the first 2 games and that the Celtics are doing a great job neutralising the role players. His defense and complaining was bad though I agree, should never have let himself foul out in game 3. Just annoying how everyone is trying to discredit him when he’s been the main reason why the mavs even had a chance in games 1-3.</p>

      <label for="l8m03mz" class="commentText"><p>His susceptibility to getting blown by at will are what drives the Celtics entire offense, so I’d still put that as the top driver. Sure Kyrie could have shot better game 2 (game 1 was never going to go to the Mavs) but the entire Celtics team could have as well…I don’t think it’s valid to point to regression to the mean in terms of shooting when the other side also had the same issue. Kyrie has had to deal with a ton of elite, bigger perimeter defenders, he doesn’t have the size advantage Luka does to bump them around and shoot over their contests.</p>

<p>I think he is a double edged sword, his offense is what leads to all Mavs success and their ability to score at all, but his defense is what prevents them from consistently slowing down the Celtics. If he could just be a league average defender, it would go so far.</p>

<p>Btw he should have fouled out well before the last call anyway, that full on tackle against Jaylen on a loose ball he had earlier in the 4th was the worst missed call I’ve ever seen. That would’ve been his 5th.</p>

Yeah, I don’t disagree with your statement on the foul, he just got too frustrated and gassed(not excusing it, but it’s what happened) so he started fouling too much.</p>

<p>Did you not watch the first or second round of the playoffs? Did you not see how badly he performed in certain games where Kyrie stepped up to lead the team to a win?</p>

<p>Luka may be the best player on the Mavs and the primary reason they made it to the Finals, but he certainly did not &ldquo;carry&rdquo; them there</p>

      <label for="l8l78jf" class="commentText"><p>You are making a strawman argument…no one said Kyrie hasn’t been good throughout most of the playoffs, but the Mavs revolves around Luka….their whole identity is based on Luka’s gravity attacking the paint and finding wide open corner shooters or lob targets.</p>

<p>Kyrie certainly was a great 2nd offensive weapon and was a pressure release valve, but Luka absolutely carried this team to the finals. Did you conveniently forget all the games Kyrie was weak? He averaged 16 points in the 2nd round…Luka has consistently been the best player by far on the Mavs, and hell even in the playoffs as a whole. Great players are allowed to have scattered bad games..</p>

      <label for="l8lvjkf" class="commentText"><p>Again, I am not saying Luka is not the best player on the Mavs and the primary reason they are in the Finals. But he is far from having &ldquo;carried&rdquo; this team into the Finals. Maybe it&rsquo;s a difference how we view the term, but carrying to me implies that Luka made it there in spite of other factors. But the reason he made it <em>is because his teammates stepped up when he was playing poorly</em>.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>Round 1 Game 3, Mavs win 101-90: Luka shoots 28% FGP and 21% from 3. Scores 22 points. Kyrie scores 21 but on much better shooting - 47% FGP and 43% from 3. Luka also has 5 TOs this game compared to Kyrie&rsquo;s 2. The Mavs won this game <em>in spite</em> of Luka, otherwise they likely go down 1-2 for the series.</p>

<p>While Luka had great overall stats the next 3 games, he shot a combined 4-27 from 3: 1-9, 2-8, 1-10. Kyrie, on the other hand, shot 12-28, with only a bad Game 5 performance of 1-7.</p>

<p>Round 2 Game 1: 32% FGP and 1-8 from 3, scoring 19 points. Mavs lose.</p>

<p>Round 2 Game 3: 22 points on 1-4 3PT shooting. Kyrie only scores 22 as well but makes clutch left-handed runner in the final minute to make it a 2 possession lead. PJ Washington leads team with 27 points. Without Kyrie and PJ stepping up and shooting much more efficiently, Mavs lose this game and go down in the series 1-2.</p>

<p>Round 2 Game 4: 30% FGP and 22% from 3, going 2-9 and 6-20 overall for 18 points. Mavs lose this game, and again, if Kyrie and PJ don&rsquo;t step up the prior game, Mavs would be in 1-3 hole.</p>

<p>It is just not true that Luka &ldquo;carried&rdquo; this team. He likely does not make it past the 1st or 2nd round without his teammates stepping up when he was not playing well.</p>

The Mavs go as Luka goes ever since he joined the team. Period.</p>

<p>What else would you say about a player that leads not just the Mavs but the <em>playoffs</em> in points scored, assists, rebounds, steals, and deflections? Easily one of the most dominant all-time playoff performances. And he&rsquo;s done all that while clearly hobbled by his injuries&hellip;</p>

      <label for="l8kwtjy" class="commentText"><p>Who even expected this Dallas team to end up in the finals? They are there due to Luka magic. He has been the best player for Dallas in every playoffs series. In fact, he has probably been the best player even when we compare Dallas and their opponent team in the playoffs up to this point. Despite being banged up we can argue he is still the best player in the finals. Boston just has too many weapons. For Dallas to win both Kyrie and Luka need to go crazy in the same game. That hasn&rsquo;t happened. Kyrie had 2 bad games. Luka had foul trouble in the last one.</p>

      <label for="l8lcnfp" class="commentText"><p>At some point everyone has to realize that nobody watches every game. Not you, not me, definitely not that analyst on TV, not the announcer. Nobody. I can say I have watched every Luka game this year, about half in person. He’s like 60% right now, his game just translates very well without mobility (shocker).  The problem with his complaining is that he’s right most of the time, and so he seems to justify it in that way. He needs to have a shift in his mind that being right isn’t as important as being back on defense. When he’s healthy his defense is average to decent at best. When he’s unhealthy and complaining he gives up way too many points complaining and letting his team go 4v5. I’m really hoping that this beat down on the biggest stage is his wake up moment. I think we may see if that’s the case or not tonight.</p>

<p>And he also refutes the stupid notion that Embiid “doesn’t care” about his lack of playoff success and things like that</p>

<p>Overall basically an Embiid hater’s <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> 😁</p>

<p>The opposite is <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>. Day when the twin towers fell and a lot of people died. The opposite of what Christmas is. This would be my Mavs getting swept 4-0 which is very likely.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s he gonna say lol, &ldquo;Embiid&rsquo;s a bum that crashes in the 4th and flames out in the second round every year?&rdquo; yeah right bro can you imagine the sports media HURRICANE 🤣 Players do respect Embiid because they know how hard it is to stop him firsthand, dude&rsquo;s a giant and you gotta watch out because he&rsquo;s gonna be out there spinning and barreling into you with the force of a small grizzly bear. Maybe Brunson also feels a particular affinity with him as a fellow free throw merchant. Imagine if they teamed up, the Ornstein and Smough of free throw mercantilism.</p>

The disappointment in composure and defense is justified but people are legitimately acting like Luka is some broken player now. It’s wild how quick the media and fans are to cut down a young player after a couple performances. Happened to Ant in the WCF and now is happening to Luka in the Finals. If the Celtics would’ve lost it would’ve happened to Tatum. Stinks</p>

<p>The finals are when everyone, including many many people who never watch basketball much at all, tune in, and they all want to have their opinion heard and are here for the drama</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen insanely bad takes and a lot of them are from unflaired users who don&rsquo;t like basketball as much as they like criticizing things</p>

It&rsquo;s worse than it would be though because they got trashed for making it to the Finals in a weak East, which isn&rsquo;t fair, and hated on for being the Celtics, which is 100% fair.</p>

Catching so much heat for his shot not falling, despite being great at all other things basically. Sometimes your botlane is 12-2 in lane, you just gotta sit under tower, ward, farm, focus on objectives and build tanky. Luka&rsquo;s problem is his botlane is also feeding their ass off</p>

<p>Criticizing him for the whining, his mental lapses (offensively and defensively), and how he acts when he&rsquo;s frustrated - justified. Criticizing him for his defense not being good enough - justified.</p>

<p>Criticizing him for lack of effort, desire, ect - that&rsquo;s nonsense to me. Even defensively. Luka has put in the effort all year long - not always enough, not always consistently, but he&rsquo;s no longer &lsquo;not even trying&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Luka is carrying one of the largest offensive loads in history, against multiple elite defensive teams (OKC, Wolves, Boston), while nursing 2-3 semi-major injuries. That does not mean he&rsquo;s immune from criticism but so much of it completely misses the mark.</p>

<p>And any Mavs fan that wants to shit on the guy can fuck off in my book. We&rsquo;re still lucky as hell to have him, flaws and all.</p>

<p>Obviously the REASON that strategy exists is in part because Luka is compromised by injury and in part because he&rsquo;s not as good defensively as the guys that those players will meet in the paid after they get there, but it&rsquo;s not like the Mavs&rsquo; coaching staff is watching that saying anything other than &ldquo;this is the plan&rdquo;.</p>

      <label for="l8kvz7z" class="commentText"><p>I get the game is emotional but Luka bitches to the refs non stop in games that aren&rsquo;t the NBA finals.  He&rsquo;s absolutely insufferable with them and it doesn&rsquo;t matter if the game is in June or December.  Its the same shit.</p>

<p>Luka is a fantastic offensive player, but he&rsquo;s pretty damn awful on defense.  It&rsquo;s notable what Dallas has done to have a good defense with Luka being a part of it because he&rsquo;s such a weak link.  Basketball is always going to be a sport where offense gets the most shine, but you can&rsquo;t understate how much the other 4 players on his team are doing when they are covering for just how bad he is on the defensive end.</p>

<p>Luka is an absolutely phenomenal player on the offensive end, but there are a ton of signs that he doesn&rsquo;t have the mental strength needed at this point in his career.  Whether he develops that remains to be seen and there&rsquo;s obviously nothing that says he cant, but lets not forget that this is the same guy who had a fan ejected for some nonsense earlier in the year, constantly lets fans get in his head, and can&rsquo;t learn to play through what he usually incorrectly perceives as bad calls.  There&rsquo;s undeniable incredible talent and ability that Luka possesses but there&rsquo;s also undeniable deficiencies that have been on full display for a long time.</p>
