</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I think people are getting some of the second apron penalties mixed up so in case anyone is curious here is a list of them:</p>

<ul>
<li>First-round picks seven years out cannot be traded</li>
<li>Teams will no longer be able to use the taxpayer mid-level exception (Vet Mins ONLY)</li>
<li>If a team remains in the second apron three out of five seasons, their first-round pick will automatically move to the end of the round</li>
<li>Outgoing salaries cannot be aggregated or combined in trades</li>
<li>Cannot acquire a player in return in an outgoing sign-and-trade</li>
<li>Teams can’t use trade exceptions created from a prior year</li>
<li>Teams can no longer use cash in trades</li>
</ul>

<p>In my opinion the most restrictive of these penalties is the aggregation of salaries, essentially there will be no &ldquo;combine roleplayer contracts into a star&rdquo; if you&rsquo;re a second apron team.</p>

      <label for="l9t1ubs" class="commentText"><p>just to add to this, these restrictions last for the entire year.</p>

<p>so a team can’t technically be a first apron team during the offseason, make a trade with aggregated salaries, then use their bird rights to sign a player and then become second apron team. making that trade hard caps them below the 2nd apron threshold.</p>

<p>this is true for all the restrictions.</p>

      <label for="l9t2s5x" class="commentText"><p>Because of restrictions like this once a team is a second apron team it essentially means you may as well go all out. It actually makes more sense to continue to spend and pay all your own guys even if it&rsquo;s an overpay as it&rsquo;s better to have that larger contract to trade away since you cannot aggregate salaries. So long as you have most of your own picks you can attach a pick to that contract to try and get something of value back even if it&rsquo;s not the same value.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking at being a second apron team the worst possible thing you can do is let rotational guys walk for nothing, you have almost no way of replacing that guy except getting very lucky in the draft.</p>

<p>i didnt realize they couldnt do that until Marks mentioned it on the most recent Lowe pod</p>

      <label for="l9t3d1r" class="commentText"><p>Essentially yeah, since you can&rsquo;t send out cash. If you&rsquo;re planning on being a second apron team having most of your own picks is going to be crucial, teams like the Celtics and OKC are probably the best equipped to handle the second apron due to the picks.</p>

<p>The ideal scenario is you get your rotational guys on good contract BEFORE going into the second apron than extend ALL your guys even if it&rsquo;s an overpay and then if needed attach picks to the overpaid contracts as need be. The worst mistake would be letting rotational guys leave for nothing unless you believe you can replace that guy with a late first round pick.</p>

      <label for="l9t3c39" class="commentText"><p>Can&rsquo;t combine players into a star BUT&hellip;</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say jrue Holliday after two more years is falling off.  Still has two years of term remaining.</p>

<p>Are Celtics able to send jrue, young player with upside (bench piece) , plus two later FRP for a young stud player that makes less than Jrue?</p>

<p>It seems like if 2nd apron teams have high value contracts on their roster they can still send off those pricey contracts for other players.</p>

<p>For example-
Good but not great young player, coming up on big extension that first team doesn&rsquo;t want to extend
Distressed assets-decent players on overpaid deals with Ayton, Tobias Harris, or Westbrook to name a few examples.</p>

<p>So if Holliday is earning 40 mill and still can play at a decent level (and let&rsquo;s say DWhite, Pritchard both continue developing to stud guards) can the Cs flip him for a similar but lesser priced asset by attaching picks to help match value?</p>

<p>I could be wrong but I don&rsquo;t believe you can combine Jrue with another player, the picks absolutely but the issue becomes you need to either pay all the other roleplayers as well or replace them with late first round picks which would be impossible if you&rsquo;re trading away all your picks.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s why the most equipped teams to handle the second apron are Boston and OKC since they have picks. It&rsquo;s also why once you&rsquo;re a second apron team it actually makes MORE sense to overpay guys and then trade them the following season as opposed to losing them for nothing.</p>
