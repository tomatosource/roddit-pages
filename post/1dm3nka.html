</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I think people are getting some of the second apron penalties mixed up so in case anyone is curious here is a list of them:</p>

<ul>
<li>First-round picks seven years out cannot be traded</li>
<li>Teams will no longer be able to use the taxpayer mid-level exception (Vet Mins ONLY)</li>
<li>If a team remains in the second apron three out of five seasons, their first-round pick will automatically move to the end of the round</li>
<li>Outgoing salaries cannot be aggregated or combined in trades</li>
<li>Cannot acquire a player in return in an outgoing sign-and-trade</li>
<li>Teams can’t use trade exceptions created from a prior year</li>
<li>Teams can no longer use cash in trades</li>
</ul>

<p>In my opinion the most restrictive of these penalties is the aggregation of salaries, essentially there will be no &ldquo;combine roleplayer contracts into a star&rdquo; if you&rsquo;re a second apron team.</p>

      <label for="l9t1ubs" class="commentText"><p>just to add to this, these restrictions last for the entire year.</p>

<p>so a team can’t technically be a first apron team during the offseason, make a trade with aggregated salaries, then use their bird rights to sign a player and then become second apron team. making that trade hard caps them below the 2nd apron threshold.</p>

<p>this is true for all the restrictions.</p>

      <label for="l9t2s5x" class="commentText"><p>Because of restrictions like this once a team is a second apron team it essentially means you may as well go all out. It actually makes more sense to continue to spend and pay all your own guys even if it&rsquo;s an overpay as it&rsquo;s better to have that larger contract to trade away since you cannot aggregate salaries. So long as you have most of your own picks you can attach a pick to that contract to try and get something of value back even if it&rsquo;s not the same value.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking at being a second apron team the worst possible thing you can do is let rotational guys walk for nothing, you have almost no way of replacing that guy except getting very lucky in the draft.</p>

      <label for="l9tbe6b" class="commentText"><p>assuming the vastly increased luxury tax bill doesn&rsquo;t pose a real business issue, then you&rsquo;re correct.</p>

<p>this coming season, the tax cost of being <span class="math inline">\(20m over the luxury tax threshold (so \)</span>2.5m over the 2nd apron) is <span class="math inline">\(103m. next season it'll be \)</span>132m (194%). that&rsquo;s for a team who is barely over the 2nd apron.</p>

<p>if, instead, you&rsquo;re a team that is <span class="math inline">\(30m over the luxury tax (so \)</span>12.5m over the 2nd apron), your tax bill this year <span class="math inline">\(152m. next year that same situation would cost you \)</span>207m.</p>

<p>if you&rsquo;re the Boston Celtics and you might wind up <span class="math inline">\(45m over the luxury tax in 2025-26, you're talking about a tax bill of \)</span>338m, $92m <em>more</em> than it would cost you this coming season.</p>

<p>so the additional cost of retaining role player for supposed future transactional flexibility comes at a pretty dear price.</p>

      <label for="l9t3d1r" class="commentText"><p>Essentially yeah, since you can&rsquo;t send out cash. If you&rsquo;re planning on being a second apron team having most of your own picks is going to be crucial, teams like the Celtics and OKC are probably the best equipped to handle the second apron due to the picks.</p>

<p>The ideal scenario is you get your rotational guys on good contract BEFORE going into the second apron than extend ALL your guys even if it&rsquo;s an overpay and then if needed attach picks to the overpaid contracts as need be. The worst mistake would be letting rotational guys leave for nothing unless you believe you can replace that guy with a late first round pick.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say jrue Holliday after two more years is falling off.  Still has two years of term remaining.</p>

<p>Are Celtics able to send jrue, young player with upside (bench piece) , plus two later FRP for a young stud player that makes less than Jrue?</p>

<p>It seems like if 2nd apron teams have high value contracts on their roster they can still send off those pricey contracts for other players.</p>

<p>For example-
Good but not great young player, coming up on big extension that first team doesn&rsquo;t want to extend
Distressed assets-decent players on overpaid deals with Ayton, Tobias Harris, or Westbrook to name a few examples.</p>

<p>So if Holliday is earning 40 mill and still can play at a decent level (and let&rsquo;s say DWhite, Pritchard both continue developing to stud guards) can the Cs flip him for a similar but lesser priced asset by attaching picks to help match value?</p>

<p>I could be wrong but I don&rsquo;t believe you can combine Jrue with another player, the picks absolutely but the issue becomes you need to either pay all the other roleplayers as well or replace them with late first round picks which would be impossible if you&rsquo;re trading away all your picks.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s why the most equipped teams to handle the second apron are Boston and OKC since they have picks. It&rsquo;s also why once you&rsquo;re a second apron team it actually makes MORE sense to overpay guys and then trade them the following season as opposed to losing them for nothing.</p>

      <label for="l9t7e7c" class="commentText"><p>They still get those picks but if they&rsquo;re still a second apron team it will be between picks 25-30.</p>

<p>That being said it probably won&rsquo;t be pick 30 since odds are Boston and Denver will probably have better records than Phoenix and I also don&rsquo;t know how long Phoenix can be a second apron team. They have virtually no picks to try and find roleplayers on cheaper contracts. If there are multiple second apron teams they will be decided like normal.</p>

<p>Phoenix is probably the second apron team least equipped to handle the restrictions. They will have to fill their roster with veteran minimum guys every year so they will have very little roster continuity year to year and even if one or two of those guys has a good season another team can swoop in and offer those guys more than the vet min which you can&rsquo;t match.</p>

<p>A team like Boston or Denver can realistically say &ldquo;we proved we can win a championship, come take a vet minimum and ring chase for a year or two&rdquo; whole Phoenix has not proven that yet so they won&rsquo;t have that advantage when asking guys to take vet minimum for them</p>

The pick moved to the end of the first round as a penalty for repeat second apron offenders is the first frozen pick, ie 2031.  It&rsquo;s not possible to trade for a pick that&rsquo;s at risk of being moved back, since second apron teams get that pick frozen at the first moment it&rsquo;s tradeable and multi-year protections can&rsquo;t extend beyond 7 years out, ie. a pick must convey or expire by 2030 currently, by 2031 once the new league year starts, etc.</p>
