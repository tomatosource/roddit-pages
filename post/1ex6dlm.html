      <label for="lj3zro4" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s saying that 38 year old Shaq was on the level of 39 year old LeBron, but the point he&rsquo;s making is that even at that age a guy past the prime can make a huge impact.</p>

<p>They aren&rsquo;t wrong.  The Celtics had started that season 23-4 and were absolutely dominating people with a historically great offense with old man Shaq in the mix.  He was only playing 20 minutes per game, but his per-36 numbers weren&rsquo;t all that declined and he was shooting 67%.  More importantly, he was a massive upgrade offensively over having Kendrick Perkins out there.  Shaq/Rondo in that brief moment were just a devastating combination when they also had elderly Ray, KG and Pierce in the mix.</p>

<p>This is the reason Danny Ainge felt empowered to trade Perk for Jeff Green, which absolutely was an upgrade on paper.  Shaq had gotten hurt, but was widely believed to be coming back before the playoffs.  Unfortunately the gamble didn&rsquo;t pay off, because after return from injury, Shaq went 3-for-3, things looked back on track, but 5 minutes into that game he got injured and his career was basically over.  Meanwhile, Jeff Green had some heart issue that kept him out the entire next season and probably killed any hope of him reaching another level of development.  In my opinion, the window for Boston&rsquo;s Big 3 basically slammed shut on 4/3/11 when Shaq went down for good.  That was the end of them being true contenders, but they did manage to go on a fluke run the next season and take Miami to 7 in the ECF.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s lots of examples of guys trying to add some former superstar and it failing, but they are right that with Shaq staying on the court they would have probably won a title and the Warriors with old man LeBron could have been scary.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:  The valid point being made was that even a floundering aging team can see a big improvement by adding another aging vet.</strong></p>

      <label for="lj3xn47" class="commentText"><p>It was the best starting 5 in the league statistically. Shaq created gravity and it allowed Rondo to attack space to get KG, Allen and Pierce open shots</p>

<p>However that’s the issue w older veterans. It’s not that they can’t play, be effective or show you flashes of greatness. It’s can they give you a full season without breaking down and getting to the finish line for a playoff run? Shaq simply broke down at the end. Played his role well as the 5th starter. Jermaine O’Neal on the other hand had issues fitting in that group. They really needed a rim runner for spacing</p>

<p>LeBron has had great longevity in his late 30’s. Apples and oranges when compared to late career Shaq</p>

      <label for="lj41ir5" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s an 82 game season. Plus playoffs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;if, if, if&rdquo;. NBA players probably have the most demanding schedule in pro sports with regard to how tiring and punishing their sport is to their bodies as opposed to how many games there are in a season. Sure the MLB has 162 games but that&rsquo;s a game where players can get away with not breaking a sweat after playing the game.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s 28 games in a soccer &ldquo;regular season&rdquo;, and the right number for the NBA should probably be somewhere right in between 28 and 82. High 50s to low 60s.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t just &ldquo;if he stays healthy&rdquo; that shit away.</p>

<p>The only &ldquo;sport&rdquo; I can think of that may have a more grueling schedule - difficulty ratio is pro wrestling. Those guys don&rsquo;t take chartered flights, so they have to drive in to cities. The constantly are coming into cities at 3 in the morning and they have to work out or they&rsquo;re not going to be keeping their muscle mass, while dealing with injuries and concussions. Heck, I don&rsquo;t know how anyone can do that WITHOUT steroids, PEDs in general, and copious amounts of painkillers.</p>

<p>Also the top soccer clubs play on the order of 50 games in all competitions (more if they go farther), not to mention interspersed international games throughout the regular seasons for the top players. Arguably the soccer season is more physically demanding.</p>

<p>Totally agreed about baseball. Total weiner sport.</p>
