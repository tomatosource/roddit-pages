      <label for="lj3xn47" class="commentText"><p>It was the best starting 5 in the league statistically. Shaq created gravity and it allowed Rondo to attack space to get KG, Allen and Pierce open shots</p>

<p>However that’s the issue w older veterans. It’s not that they can’t play, be effective or show you flashes of greatness. It’s can they give you a full season without breaking down and getting to the finish line for a playoff run? Shaq simply broke down at the end. Played his role well as the 5th starter. Jermaine O’Neal on the other hand had issues fitting in that group. They really needed a rim runner for spacing</p>

<p>LeBron has had great longevity in his late 30’s. Apples and oranges when compared to late career Shaq</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It should be noted that Shaq had great longevity too. He was an All-Star in his 17th season.</p>

<p>And it was a legit AS selection, not a lifetime achievement award like final-year Dirk and Wade, or a sympathy vote like post-Achilles Kobe.</p>

<p>When Hakeem was in his 17th season, he was putting up a forgettable12 and 7. Ewing was putting up 6 and 4 in Orlando. David Robinson retired after 14 seasons. When Dwight was in his 17th season, he was putting up 6 and 6.</p>

<p>Jokic will probably be retired by 2033, back in Serbia with his horses. Does anyone seriously think Embiid will hold up physically until 2034?</p>

      <label for="lj61a1n" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s not a fair comparison as Shaq was 20 in his rookie season, compared to Olajuwon being 22, Ewing being 23, and Robinson being 24. Shaq was 36 in his 17th season, so it&rsquo;s more informative to compare their age 36 seasons:</p>

<table>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Olajuwon and Ewing had their age 36 seasons in the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season which had no All-Star game, so although they technically weren&rsquo;t All-Stars, that&rsquo;s not a reflection of how well they played. Both had similar (arguably better) statistical production to Shaq. Olajuwon was 3rd team All-NBA (as Shaq was also).</p>

<p>Robinson&rsquo;s stats lag behind the others, but arguably that&rsquo;s primarily due to the fact that he took a back seat to Tim Duncan, who was a 25 year old MVP.</p>

<p>Shaq&rsquo;s age 36 season was also sandwiched between his somewhat subpar age 35 season and age 37 season, so it was a bit of an outlier and his All-Star selection may have been influenced in part because it was something of a bounce back year for him. If you look up the numbers, Olajuwon, Ewing, and Robinson all have clearly better age 35 seasons, and Ewing has a clearly better age 37 season.</p>

<p>As far as longevity goes, Olajuwon and Ewing had their final All-Star selection at age 34, and Robinson at age 35. (Ewing had a great shot at being an All-Star in his age 35 season too, averaging 20.8 / 10.2 / 1.1 / 2.2 in 28 games, but missed the last two-thirds of the season from a freak injury due to being pushed in mid-air on an alley-oop attempt. And as already mentioned, both Ewing and Olajuwon might have been All-Stars in their age 36 season if they were naming All-Stars that year.) Shaq played until his age 38 season, similar to Olajuwon and Ewing at 39, and Robinson at 37.</p>

      <label for="lj4tl8h" class="commentText"><p>No one&rsquo;s saying he doesn&rsquo;t have the right to go wherever, but Lebron moving on from the Lakers means uprooting his family from Los Angeles. The last time we heard about Lebron moving from one team to another, him and his wife were home shopping in LA and looking for schools for their kids. I doubt he&rsquo;s moving without obvious activity from his family.</p>

      <label for="lj3zro4" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s saying that 38 year old Shaq was on the level of 39 year old LeBron, but the point he&rsquo;s making is that even at that age a guy past the prime can make a huge impact.</p>

<p>They aren&rsquo;t wrong.  The Celtics had started that season 23-4 (70 win pace) and were absolutely dominating people with a historically great offense with old man Shaq in the mix.  He was only playing 20 minutes per game, but his per-36 numbers weren&rsquo;t all that declined and he was shooting 67%.  More importantly, he was a massive upgrade offensively over having Kendrick Perkins out there.  Shaq/Rondo in that brief moment were just a devastating combination when they also had elderly Ray, KG and Pierce in the mix.</p>

<p>This is the reason Danny Ainge felt empowered to trade Perk for Jeff Green, which absolutely was an upgrade on paper.  Shaq had gotten hurt, but was widely believed to be coming back before the playoffs.  Unfortunately the gamble didn&rsquo;t pay off, because after return from injury, Shaq went 3-for-3, things looked back on track, but 5 minutes into that game he got injured and his career was basically over.  Meanwhile, Jeff Green had some heart issue that kept him out the entire next season and probably killed any hope of him reaching another level of development.  In my opinion, the window for Boston&rsquo;s Big 3 basically slammed shut on 4/3/11 when Shaq went down for good.  That was the end of them being true contenders, but they did manage to go on a fluke run the next season and take Miami to 7 in the ECF.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s lots of examples of guys trying to add some former superstar and it failing, but they are right that with Shaq staying on the court they would have probably won a title and the Warriors with old man LeBron could have been scary.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:  The valid point being made was that even a floundering aging team can see a big improvement by adding another aging vet.</strong></p>

      <label for="lj568qm" class="commentText"><p>i didn&rsquo;t take that team seriously as a contender.  They played at a 48 win pace and let Jrue Holiday&rsquo;s 8th seed 76ers take them to 7 games in Round 2.  Just a fluke victory lap run where the guys used their old man strength to give a sleepwalking Miami a bit of a series, but Bosh came back from injury and the Heat got their shit together.  Kinda like how in 2008 Al Horford&rsquo;s below .500 Hawks took the eventual championship Celtics to 7 games&hellip; didn&rsquo;t take the Hawks seriously as a contender either.  This kinda weird shit can happen from time to time, but as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, the Celtics stopped being true contenders the year prior when Shaq got injured.</p>

<p>The whole thing was mirrored in 2018 when a rookie 19 year old Jayson Tatum somehow got his injury-riddled Celtics (no Kyrie or Hayward) to 7 games in the ECF against LeBron, but similarly that Celtic team wasn&rsquo;t actually a contender they just had some wacky success.  LeBron in 2012 and 2018 was something of a bookend of Boston&rsquo;s post-window  (KG/Pierce) old man run and Boston&rsquo;s pre-window (Tatum/Brown) next gen run.  I imagine LeBron has similar feelings about the 2012 and 2018 Celtics as being two teams that had no business taking him to 7 games in the conference finals.  Wild that Tatum/Brown were basically acquired by trading KG/Pierce well after their window had closed.</p>

      <label for="lj6jznm" class="commentText"><p>I just don&rsquo;t think the Celtics were beating The Heat in 2011 with how LeBron, Wade, and Bosh all felt about the Celtics that year. 2011 was the weakest playoff run of LeBron career (we don&rsquo;t even have to bring up the finals), but he made a point to kill the Celtics in the semis. They even tried forcing him into taking 3s, which would end up working for the mavs in the finals. And he hit 45% on similar volume to what he did against the mavs. Bron was even facilitating less just because he wanted to whoop them. (He tended to do this against the Celtics after 2010 which is a funny anecdote, you can genuinely tell when Bron was playing the Celtics in the playoffs cause his assist average would drop by 3 but he&rsquo;d average like 5 more points, also applies to Toronto but all of his numbers go up.)</p>

<p>A healthy Shaq would have been the difference maker in 2011, but instead they had to start the corpse of Jermaine O&rsquo;Neal at center.  The only real difference a year later was that they brought in Brandon Bass and decided to just move elderly KG into the center role since they had no alternative (KG wasn&rsquo;t even an all-star selection that year).  They gave Miami hell in the ECF that year and were actually up 3-2 in the series before running out of gas.</p>

      <label for="lj6mw8y" class="commentText"><p>I love Shaq as a laker fan, but he&rsquo;s not taking a 5 game loss in 2011 and turning it into a win for the Celtics. They lost that series handedly as well. They had one blowout win in game 3 where the heat big 3 played probably the worst playoff game they&rsquo;d ever have for the 4 years they were together. And if Shaq did play the Heat had two big men in Jamaal Magliore and Juwan Howard, that would be a free hack-a-shaq 12 fouls every night hes a liability in too many ways against a team that would be able to exploit them. 2012, they forced the Heat to 7 off of insane play from their starting five in games 4 and 5, including a Paul Pierce 3 over LeBron. and then they immediately blew the next two games by 19 and then 13 largely because the old men ran out of juice and because LeBron once again took over.</p>

And that sounds crazy to say now given how the rest of Perks career went and just how much the game has changed. But in that time, Perkins gave the Celtics good interior defense and was a surprisingly capable finisher in the post.</p>

<p>When they traded Perkins, it was like they pushed all-in on Shaq being healthy the rest of the season. It was a bad bet, and it was heavily criticized at the time. Shaq couldn&rsquo;t stay healthy. They tried to give him some playing time in the playoffs, and he quickly got in foul trouble because he couldn&rsquo;t move.</p>

<p>The Perkins trade pretty much ended the Big 3 Celtics era.</p>

      <label for="lj7cckh" class="commentText"><p>Perkins got traded because Marquis Daniels went down with that crazy neck injury and the C&rsquo;s had no one on the roster who could spell Pierce, really. That&rsquo;s why they traded Nate Rob &amp; Perkins for Jeff Green &amp; Kristic - the same day they traded Daniels to the Kings for a second-round draft pick. Perk was also hurt, so there&rsquo;s no guarantee he would have been around to help even if he hadn&rsquo;t been traded.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true though, as you&rsquo;ve said, that the Celtics had a big problem (pardon the pun) going from Perkins/S. O&rsquo;Neal/J. O&rsquo;Neal to Kristic as the only functional big, which really hurt them.</p>

      <label for="lj7fbej" class="commentText"><p>Perkins went down Game 6 in the Lakers finals the year before.</p>

<p>In Game 7, Boston had the lead most of the way but ran out of steam and couldn&rsquo;t any rebounds. Gasol and Kobe combined for 33 rebounds against Boston&rsquo;s 40. </p>

<p>Good chance Boston wins that Finals if Perk was available.</p>

      <label for="lj41ir5" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s an 82 game season. Plus playoffs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;if, if, if&rdquo;. NBA players probably have the most demanding schedule in pro sports with regard to how tiring and punishing their sport is to their bodies as opposed to how many games there are in a season. Sure the MLB has 162 games but that&rsquo;s a game where players can get away with not breaking a sweat after playing the game.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s 28 games in a soccer &ldquo;regular season&rdquo;, and the right number for the NBA should probably be somewhere right in between 28 and 82. High 50s to low 60s.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t just &ldquo;if he stays healthy&rdquo; that shit away.</p>

<p>The only &ldquo;sport&rdquo; I can think of that may have a more grueling schedule - difficulty ratio is pro wrestling. Those guys don&rsquo;t take chartered flights, so they have to drive in to cities. The constantly are coming into cities at 3 in the morning and they have to work out or they&rsquo;re not going to be keeping their muscle mass, while dealing with injuries and concussions. Heck, I don&rsquo;t know how anyone can do that WITHOUT steroids, PEDs in general, and copious amounts of painkillers.</p>

<p>Also the top soccer clubs play on the order of 50 games in all competitions (more if they go farther), not to mention interspersed international games throughout the regular seasons for the top players. Arguably the soccer season is more physically demanding.</p>

<p>I have my issues with Kerr but he’s a known commodity. Who the fuck knows what JJ is going to be like as a coach at this moment. He could be great, he could be fucking awful.</p>

<p>Shaq was a ticking time bomb later in his career. All that extra weight for all those years finally caught him.</p>

      <label for="lj4x23n" class="commentText"><p>Warriors were always better than the Cavs. Cavs took advantage of a bad eastern conference but they were lunch meat in the finals. Except in 2016 when the commissioner had a narrative they needed to play out. The Cavs were able to basically wrestle Curry starting in Game 5, all the way to the bank.</p>

      <label for="lj4y6oo" class="commentText"><p>Did he play? Yep, every game. Wasn’t injured. No one is 100% in the NBA finals. No one was saying shit when he was putting up his usual numbers for the first 4 games of the series, but cause he choked, threw a pass out of bounds and missed a shot over Love, he gets all the excuses. Even Steph himself said “Lebron and Kyrie were just better in those games” in his appearance on JJ’s podcast.</p>

<p>You should also remember the “I’m back” moment, cause it was against your team when he was dropping 40+ on you.</p>

      <label for="lj4ha1b" class="commentText"><p>A marketing consultant that spoke to my class a long time ago said KG is the dumbest athlete he ever had to talk to.</p>

<p>He’s consulting for Adidas, they are going to do this giant media blitz if the Celtics win the championship, all KG has to do is scream the tagline “IMPOSSIBLE IS NOTHING!” into the microphone, and they are going to sign him to a giant life time extension and revamp his signature shoe and they envisioned him as a huge force even post career because the Celtics are going to win a lot of championships in a row. It’s all prepped, they are going to add this shout to all these commercials for the rest of time as this iconic moment for the company beating Nike’s golden boy.</p>

<p>KG doesn’t take it seriously (the consultant thinks KG can’t read) and keeps saying it wrong, but insists he will get it right after they win.</p>

<p>Immediately screams “ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE!” post championship and fumbled the contract and signs with some shitty company like 12 months later and is now just a guy who says dumb things on the internet for clicks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>IMPOSSIBLE IS NOTHING</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is a pretty dumb standalone phrase</p>

<p>Without any other context/quote, it either sounds like a double negative (so I completely get kg saying it the more english-natural way), or you accidentally said &ldquo;nothing is impossible&rdquo; backwards like a regard</p>
