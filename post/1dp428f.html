    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>It’s crazy, we got a new reporter every week with a pfp of himself wearing an ugly shirt and a bad haircut giving “news” (mostly thought pieces) and then claiming that it’s sources said.</p>

<p>Can we organize this shitshow? is this too much to ask</p>

<p>Like it should be:</p>

<p>Tier 1: Woj, Shams</p>

<p>Tier 2: (the reliable beat reporters), Haynes, etc</p>

<p>Tier 3: The national media guys who sometimes get something occasionally right (Windhorst, Kevin O’ Connor), etc</p>

<p>Tier 4: Just the sensationalists like SAS</p>

<p>Also Woj and Shams are pretty reliable. And whoever reports for the local team eg the Suns guy Gambo. You won’t find many grifters.</p>

<p>There aren’t enough guys saying absolute nonsense to need tiers. There’s thousands of players and triple digit leagues in “soccer”, opening up the opportunity for nonsense. There are only 400 or so players in the NBA at one time</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m an Arsenal fan and we have a notoriously rabid online fanbase so it only takes a well timed tweet for any nonsense account to become absolutely massive. We&rsquo;ve had ITKs that were Gerbils, Bells, a bloke named Geoff, random guys at mosques, barbers and of course my favourite; Steve, who allegedly died and his widow <a href="https://x.com/SteveWoodsAFC/status/638355520605278208" target="_blank">took to his Twitter to let us know his last words</a>.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s just the ridiculous ones. Right now one of the more legit ones is a guy who has a successful Patreon for just posting rumours and a few leaks here and there, plus a Chilean kid who claims to be a &ldquo;journalist&rdquo; but just recycles random bullshit on his timeline.</p>

<p>Football ITKs is a genuinely insane space</p>

<p>I mean there probably are, just the nature of the NBA means it&rsquo;s probably less noticeable. About half the league are perpetually in trade conversations behind doors - so what do you do with someone like Fischer who might report that Team X and Team Y had discussions about Player Z but the trade never happened?</p>

<p>My gut feeling is there are a <strong>lot</strong> of &lsquo;insiders&rsquo; who pad the public resume by just saying things that aren&rsquo;t relevant to current information. There&rsquo;s also a lot of insiders who just hypothesise and that gets taken as meaningful because we&rsquo;re so used to talking not leading to anything concrete in the NBA world. Trades, unlike transfers, also lean a lot more on what up to 28 other teams think/are doing, so there&rsquo;s a lot more intentional misinformation pushed by people in the business.</p>

The problem there is you’ll be following a team in Germany and then you see a rumor about a player linked to your club from the second division in Bulgaria, and you have no idea whether the Bulgarian journalist who leaked the rumor is Shams tier for that club or SAS tier. In the NBA, even if there are ten journalists/ITKs that regularly post things about your team (which is on the high side for smaller markets), that’s still only a couple hundred names to keep track of for the entire league. For soccer, there are literally thousands of professional teams</p>

The NBA is nowhere near that level, not even in the same stratosphere. We got just random people from Bangladesh claiming to be ITK and other people that believes everything that comes out of their fingers too.</p>

<p>I live in Milan right, my city is one of Europe’s biggest economic centre and home of not one but two of the biggest clubs in the world, it’s home of Serie A and a good chunk of the league has home either just around Milan or just a couple of hours from it that means that it’s a hotbed for football transfers from all over the planet.</p>

<p>Most of football transfers are dealt in hotels in Milan. And i swear to god once summer comes and the transfer session begins you cannot walk around those places for the amount of people that’s there “””reporting””” on whoever goes in and out like ‘is that so and so agent??’</p>

<p>all of this bullshit then goes on the internet and later on tv where there are programs dedicated to those rumors, and it all turns into a competition.</p>

<p>It’s a circus, transfer season is nuts and i love it</p>

<p>Woj absolutely does the same thing. He may not be getting paid by the owners but he absolutely is pushing certain narratives in exchange for sensetive information. Woj literally tweeted that Houston is in position to trade for Booker in the future. That doesn&rsquo;t sound like a tweet that happened when &ldquo;everything has been said and done.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="laej24n" class="commentText"><p>I believe it was Zach Lowe on one of his podcasts talking about how hands down the biggest podcasts of the year (with the most listens) are the off season Free Agent season ones.  NBA fans are fans in larger part because of the business side of things.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s partly why the Caitlyn Clark &ldquo;drama&rdquo; in the WNBA is actually a great thing for their product.  It&rsquo;s a drama filled, business storyline that is increasing bartsool, barbershop and social media conversation that the NBA depends on.</p>

<p>The best you&rsquo;re going to find are the beat guys who are actually well connected to their teams - but teams also use their own beat guys to distribute a message, so you have to take even those with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>But both rush to be first so fast that they post unconfirmed BS as fact constantly.</p>

<p>To put it another way - when something actually happens, I expect one of the two to be the first to report it more often than not.  But anytime they talk about something is going on or may happen before it is fact, they&rsquo;re no more reliable than anyone else.</p>

When info appears on some trade, it&rsquo;s basically always what really happened.</p>

<p>Looking at the names you mention, I don&rsquo;t feel it&rsquo;s a list of &ldquo;reliable reporters&rdquo; and &ldquo;unreliable reporters&rdquo; but rather of respectively reporters and commenters.</p>
