</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <blockquote>
<p>The Jazz’s goals have been bold, sure. First, they hoped to acquire Brooklyn forward Mikal Bridges via trade. They then hoped that would give them a springboard to sign Clippers star Paul George.</p>

<p>But while I can defend the Jazz losing out on the big game as a net positive, I can’t really defend the process used. For the last two seasons, the Jazz have existed in limbo. They’ve avoided being competitive by being sellers at the deadline, but avoided tanking by making buys like John Collins and extending Jordan Clarkson. The only way that strategy makes sense is if you quickly add talent and escape mediocrity.</p>

<p>The Jazz never really had a chance to do that other than via hope and prayer. Hoping a star the likes of George chooses to move to Utah? Praying Luka Doncic gets mad at his management in Dallas? Hoping a competitor the likes of Jrue Holiday will prefer a trade to Utah over the chance to win a championship with Boston? Praying the league keeps their bids for Bridges low?</p>

<p>It’s been wishcasting, not good management.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/07/02/andy-larsen-lauri-markkanen-trade/" target="_blank">https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/07/02/andy-larsen-lauri-markkanen-trade/</a></p>

<p>More at the link, but paywalled. The entire article is good. Ainge has been extremely aggressive going after star players and has failed spectacularly every single time, striking out on Porzingis, Jrue, Dejounte Murray, Mikal Bridges, and Paul George. The odds of getting any of those players while not overpaying were ridiculously low, but Ainge built the team around the idea that they could add two more stars around Markkanen and be ready to compete for a title right away. He probably could have gotten more for Markkanen at last deadline (due to him having two years on his contract) and looks to have fucked up.</p>

      <label for="lbm31yk" class="commentText"><p>Tbf Lauri breaking out and becoming an all-star that first season wasn&rsquo;t in the plans. Jazz FO had to adjust to unexpectedly having a star level guy on the roster.</p>

<p>So I respect trying to build something around him, but it&rsquo;s been a year at least of no direction. Last two years we&rsquo;ve actually played promising basketball before tanking at the deadline and another year of that makes no sense. Imo we need to sell or we need to sign enough talent that we look like we can make a playoff push.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying will Hardy isn&rsquo;t a good coach, just that good coaches usually don&rsquo;t start taking blame until they&rsquo;re being held against a championship standard. That&rsquo;s when the perception and sentiment flips against them</p>

If you do 4 FRPs + Kuminga from the warriors whats rumoured, you can either keep kuminga or sell him onto us for 2 extra FRPs is my guess. That’s 6 FRPs for Lauri on a one year deal.</p>

<p>So if the Jazz want to avoid him hitting FA as the only way to get his money, they need to renegotiate his current salary before they extend him, which they can’t do until august. So about $15 million is likely set aside for that. </p>

<p>andy isn&rsquo;t taking that angle and i don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re getting the implication tbh. he&rsquo;s not saying he expects/wants/hopes luka to demand a trade to, specifically, utah. he&rsquo;s saying that it&rsquo;s a prayer that luka would <em>in the first place</em> demand a trade out, and that utah would happen to be one of the teams that dallas (not luka) would be interested in dealing with given utah&rsquo;s assets</p>

The Warriors have a bit of a limitation on trading far out picks due to their 2030 pick being owed to Washington and seem reluctant to part with Kuminga, the Kings can’t trade next years pick, and the Spurs don’t have a lot of pressure to trade a lot of picks for a guy already in his prime that needs a big contract but isn’t a superstar.</p>

<p>They also would likely take other things back. You aren’t going to intentionally bottom out three years in a row unless you’re the sixers or something. It would hamper the pieces you do bring back. You don’t want to be Detroit once you start your build back up.</p>

<p>Like unless you are looking to secure a top 3 pick last year, you don’t move him yet. This year, it makes sense to move him and look to tank.</p>

<p>If you’re even semi competent as an FO you can tank well. It took severe incompetence by Detroit to get in that situation. They’ve also gotten super unlucky with draft picks. If you swap out Jaden Ivey and Ausar with Chet and Brandon Miller, their future looks alot better</p>

<p>They had two down seasons and jumped back to nearly .500.</p>

<p>Do you think the Jazz are ready to go nearly .500 next season if they had traded Lauri last year? Absolutely not. Totally different thing, because they were rebuilding from a place with much more assets to flip.</p>

<p>Last season wasn’t the year to do that. This year sure.</p>

      <label for="lbmbxlh" class="commentText"><p>Paul George was a much much better player than Lauri with multiple years left of that contract. You are not getting anywhere close to that deal for him. Unless the Spurs put up a ridiculous overpay, Kuminga and a couple of firsts from the Warriors is about as good as it will get</p>

<p>But my main point was you saying that most tank jobs end up failing like Detroit when that clearly isn’t true</p>

The entire point of tanking is to get talent on the roster externally you don’t need to get a great young talent to build around to do so</p>

      <label for="lbmc4uw" class="commentText"><p>correct. he works for the strib which is the top local paper, but tony jones is the top local reporter. has better access to the fo and the athletic is a bigger sports publication. i&rsquo;d also argue that tony is better since he&rsquo;s ostensibly not a jazz fan nor a utah native, so he doesn&rsquo;t have any personal bias. his only knock is that whilst he&rsquo;s not personally biased, he can sometimes function as a mouthpiece for the fo</p>

<p>i like andy a lot, but this particular take from him feels like it&rsquo;s just a very well-written fan article. it&rsquo;s an opinion, not a report.</p>

      <label for="lbmnlml" class="commentText"><p>I think his point is that they could be building like OKC. It looked like that was the direction they were going when they traded their best two players (Mitchell and Gobert) for young talent and picks. Same thing OKC did (Russ and PG).</p>

<p>But OKC proceeded to purge the whole rest of the roster too, including the unexpected positive asset they got in the Russ trade (trading CP3, Adams, Gallinari, Schroder, etc.). They then kept trading the players they got in those deals too (Oubre, Ariza, etc.) before they ever set foot on the floor. The Thunder tore things down to the studs to focus on getting high draft picks. The Jazz could have done that too, but instead they acquired John Collins, re-signed Clarkson, and stayed in no man’s land.</p>

<p>He probably could have gotten more for Markkanen at last deadline</p>

<p>Disagree, Lauri&rsquo;s value is at an all time high rn and up until the deadline due to his cheap contract and the new CBA cap rules. Once he signs a new contract, he&rsquo;s going to be a lot harder to move unless it&rsquo;s to a non-contender with lots of cap space.</p>

<p>Whether or not Ainge can come to agreement with a team who wants Lauri on how much he gets back for him is a whole nother question tho&hellip;</p>

      <label for="lbm4z3m" class="commentText"><p>Disagree, Siakam was an expiring at the wrong time for y&rsquo;all - new CBA rules change everything and getting Birds rights is way more important now for teams that haven&rsquo;t gone over either apron yet. Even more importantly tho, Lauri&rsquo;s contract is only <span class="math inline">\(18 mil while Siakam's was \)</span>34 mil before the extension - $18 mil for a player of Lauri&rsquo;s tier gives Ainge even more leverage because that&rsquo;s how team&rsquo;s like GSW can fit him in without going over the apron. Again, all this really comes down to is if someone offers Ainge enough assets but if no one does, he&rsquo;ll just re-sign Lauri instead.</p>

<p>I guess the bit of context I would add is that the Jazz FO has been telling reporters and fans since the Don/Rudy trades that the plan wasn’t a full rebuild, just a quick retooling in which they would use their assets and cap space to acquire stars.</p>

<p>The point of the column (and it is that, an opinion column, which I’m thankful the Trib lets me write) is that the quick retooling plan was always a bit too optimistic given Utah’s troubles with acquiring FAs and their unwillingness to overspend in trades. A full rebuild would always be necessary, and ideally that would have started earlier in the last two seasons, not just at the trade deadline of them.</p>

Those heart attack celtics were amazing and maybe cost the c&rsquo;s great draft positioning the years they should have sucked. Couple extra shots at top 3 could have made the celtics even scarier the last few years. Ainge didnt care he traded rondo away after pierce and garnett. Also traded doc to the clippers.</p>

      <label for="lbm8qag" class="commentText"><p>What a terrible job Ainge has done of stacking major draft assets and players in order to build teams. He doesn’t even succeed on every single deal he explores.</p>

<p>I remember hearing this stuff in the mid-00’s in Boston before he took all that stuff he accumulated and built a championship team.</p>

<p>And I remember it in 2019 after he built another contender but Hayward got hurt and Kyrie ghosted and his plans were scuttled. And when they were one game away from the finals in the bubble. “Why did they sign Kemba??”</p>

<p>And I remember it from 2021 after covid and everyone wanted him to trade one of the Jays but he refused and “oh how dumb he must be!”</p>

<p>Yet now the team he built won the title again. Remember who hired Brad when you’re going him credit for his smart moves.</p>

<p>Ainge doesn’t make moves fast enough for Andy Larsen, I guess, but the Jazz got huge hauls from Gobert and Mitchell. They have a Celtics level war chest now and a few very tradeable players at key salary points on their roster, including the most in demand trade piece on the market.</p>

<p>This seems like a good situation for the Jazz created through top level management.</p>

The Miller family kept the Jazz competitive but being cautious and having a bit of luck. Smith and Ainge threw the caution out, got a lot of draft choices that are likely to be middle of the pack and have shown that big game hunting in Utah is, in reality, catching 6” trout at East Canyon Reservoir.  Hubris is different than management. I’ll be the first to eat these words, but the Jazz are not looking competitive for years to come.</p>

      <label for="lbmgqnn" class="commentText"><p>This is what happens when you convince yourself that multi year tanking solves all problems. Every thing he outlined is straight out of the Ainge Celtics playbook. Ainge acquired great assets and an excellent young head coach, and they overperformed for their talent level. Nobody thought Lauri would be an all-star when he was acquired, and when he was it both greatly increased his value and opened up the potential to build a competitive team around him if they could acquire another star player. Now that that’s not really an option, he can still sell high on Lauri and tank one year for Cooper Flagg while still sitting on a big stockpile of assets. This is a pretty solid blueprint for a rebuild.</p>

<p>Now teams are trying to hold their 2025 picks and Lauri&rsquo;s contract max extension complicates things.</p>

<p>They over performed their first year with Lauri showing he&rsquo;s a baller and missed out on Wembanyama. Last year there was no great prize to tank for so may as well use it as a gap year to figure out what guys you want to stick around. Kessler and George are both interesting prospects who could be good role players. Lauri is entering his prime and getting paid roughly the same as Klay, less than Vucevic and about half of Khris Middleton; someone will over pay for him.</p>

<p>I would blow it up, shoot for his positioning in the draft the next 2 years. At that point the picks from MIN and CLE and whoever they send Lauri too could become insanely valuable. Danny knows more about basketball than 99% of people, last see what he cooks up (Paul George was never gonna go to SLC btw).</p>

      <label for="lbmsc1u" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t hate what Ainge has done tbf. Lauri had a pretty decent season a couple of seasons ago and they wanted to see if they could get someone to partner him which made sense for this season as with the poor draft no reason to tank. This up and coming draft is much better and with them not being able to attract someone to play with Lauri they can still cash in and develop some decent pieces they have</p>

      <label for="lbm9um9" class="commentText"><p>This is just a stupid argument by an impatient fan. Going full rebuild is very difficult to climb out of, and only OKC has really done it successfully, and that took forever and a lot of luck on prestis part.</p>

<p>It’s often a better fit to keep a halfway competitive roster while you collect picks so the culture doesn’t go to shit. Nothing worse than ending up like Detroit, where you have a lot of lottery picks but no winning culture at all. </p>

      <label for="lbmbxkm" class="commentText"><p>The big issue is that the Jazz’s culture is extremely bad. They have intentionally thrown games post ASB to tank the last two years and the players have not been happy about it at all. They also finished last in defense and deprioritized defense at every point last year. They’re managing to not get good picks while creating an awful culture.</p>

      <label for="lbmilel" class="commentText"><p>I wouldn’t say extremely bad. They’re winning games. Being in a spot where you have to intentionally lose games is way better than having an inability to win anything at all. It’s much easier to take off the reigns of tanking to a competent team than it is to tell a shitty team to win games. They’ve got a million draft picks from the wolves and are likely to get a lot more from Lauri. Having a middling team is really great for young players to grow into. The coach is great, too. The jazz are honestly in a great spot for a rebuild. </p>

<p>Jazz fans should consider themselves lucky. They’re going to be in a Celtics situation where they can have a competitive team for years while simultaneously being in the middle of a rebuild. </p>

<p>I know the Jazz aren’t used to winning very much, so it might be a strange situation for them, but honestly things look really great for them right now</p>
