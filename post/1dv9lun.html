</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <blockquote>
<p>The Jazz’s goals have been bold, sure. First, they hoped to acquire Brooklyn forward Mikal Bridges via trade. They then hoped that would give them a springboard to sign Clippers star Paul George.</p>

<p>But while I can defend the Jazz losing out on the big game as a net positive, I can’t really defend the process used. For the last two seasons, the Jazz have existed in limbo. They’ve avoided being competitive by being sellers at the deadline, but avoided tanking by making buys like John Collins and extending Jordan Clarkson. The only way that strategy makes sense is if you quickly add talent and escape mediocrity.</p>

<p>The Jazz never really had a chance to do that other than via hope and prayer. Hoping a star the likes of George chooses to move to Utah? Praying Luka Doncic gets mad at his management in Dallas? Hoping a competitor the likes of Jrue Holiday will prefer a trade to Utah over the chance to win a championship with Boston? Praying the league keeps their bids for Bridges low?</p>

<p>It’s been wishcasting, not good management.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/07/02/andy-larsen-lauri-markkanen-trade/" target="_blank">https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/07/02/andy-larsen-lauri-markkanen-trade/</a></p>

<p>More at the link, but paywalled. The entire article is good. Ainge has been extremely aggressive going after star players and has failed spectacularly every single time, striking out on Porzingis, Jrue, Dejounte Murray, Mikal Bridges, and Paul George. The odds of getting any of those players while not overpaying were ridiculously low, but Ainge built the team around the idea that they could add two more stars around Markkanen and be ready to compete for a title right away. He probably could have gotten more for Markkanen at last deadline (due to him having two years on his contract) and looks to have fucked up.</p>

      <label for="lbm31yk" class="commentText"><p>Tbf Lauri breaking out and becoming an all-star that first season wasn&rsquo;t in the plans. Jazz FO had to adjust to unexpectedly having a star level guy on the roster.</p>

<p>So I respect trying to build something around him, but it&rsquo;s been a year at least of no direction. Last two years we&rsquo;ve actually played promising basketball before tanking at the deadline and another year of that makes no sense. Imo we need to sell or we need to sign enough talent that we look like we can make a playoff push.</p>

<p>So if the Jazz want to avoid him hitting FA as the only way to get his money, they need to renegotiate his current salary before they extend him, which they can’t do until august. So about $15 million is likely set aside for that. </p>

<p>They also would likely take other things back. You aren’t going to intentionally bottom out three years in a row unless you’re the sixers or something. It would hamper the pieces you do bring back. You don’t want to be Detroit once you start your build back up.</p>

<p>Like unless you are looking to secure a top 3 pick last year, you don’t move him yet. This year, it makes sense to move him and look to tank.</p>

<p>If you’re even semi competent as an FO you can tank well. It took severe incompetence by Detroit to get in that situation. They’ve also gotten super unlucky with draft picks. If you swap out Jaden Ivey and Ausar with Chet and Brandon Miller, their future looks alot better</p>

      <label for="lbm4oup" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, you have to consider what the actual trade package you get back is. I’ve seen him rumored to the Warriors, Kings and Spurs primarily. The Warriors have a bit of a limitation on trading far out picks due to their 2030 pick being owed to Washington and seem reluctant to part with Kuminga, the Kings can’t trade next years pick, and the Spurs don’t have a lot of pressure to trade a lot of picks for a guy already in his prime that needs a big contract but isn’t a superstar.</p>

      <label for="lbm574j" class="commentText"><p>Yea Ainge is finding out that demand for him is a lot less than hoped. Especially because while Lauri is a good player, he’s not close to a superstar, more a good 3 on a contender or 2 on a high level playoff team</p>

<p>Also he’s expiring so he could end up being a 1 year rental if he doesn’t like where he’s traded to</p>

<p>Disagree, Lauri&rsquo;s value is at an all time high rn and up until the deadline due to his cheap contract and the new CBA cap rules. Once he signs a new contract, he&rsquo;s going to be a lot harder to move unless it&rsquo;s to a non-contender with lots of cap space.</p>

<p>Whether or not Ainge can come to agreement with a team who wants Lauri on how much he gets back for him is a whole nother question tho&hellip;</p>

      <label for="lbm4z3m" class="commentText"><p>Disagree, Siakam was an expiring at the wrong time for y&rsquo;all - new CBA rules change everything and getting Birds rights is way more important now for teams that haven&rsquo;t gone over either apron yet. Even more importantly tho, Lauri&rsquo;s contract is only <span class="math inline">\(18 mil while Siakam's was \)</span>34 mil before the extension - $18 mil for a player of Lauri&rsquo;s tier gives Ainge even more leverage because that&rsquo;s how team&rsquo;s like GSW can fit him in without going over the apron. Again, all this really comes down to is if someone offers Ainge enough assets but if no one does, he&rsquo;ll just re-sign Lauri instead.</p>

They&rsquo;re just quietly tanking instead of hard tanking because the lottery odds just don&rsquo;t make sense to hard tank anymore.  Case-in-point, Hawks got the 1st pick after making the play-in and Detroit keeps picking 5th with the worst record.</p>

In addition, most of the teams picking 2nd and 3rd were also top 5 teams. It’s flattened out a little bit but being bad is still heavily correlated with getting good picks</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not true that ATL just won the lottery with the 10th best odds and that Detroit has had the best odds two years in a row and got 5th both times?</p>

      <label for="lbm363o" class="commentText"><p>Detroit picking fifth both years isn&rsquo;t an outlier.  It was the outcome with the highest probability</p>

<p>Draft lottery odds for the worst record</p>

<p>1st pick - 14.0%</p>

<p>2nd pick - 13.4%</p>

<p>3rd pick - 12.7%</p>

<p>4th pick - 12.0%</p>

<p><strong>5th pick - 47.9%</strong></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to hard tank anymore.  Win 15 games or win 25 games, the flattened odds for the top picks just doesn&rsquo;t offer the probabilities that they used to.</p>

<p>Also the Jazz haven’t been winning 25 games, they’ve been in the 30-35 range or 8-10 in draft odds which is about a 25% chance at a top 4 pick and 5% chance to get 1st overall. Also very unlikely</p>

The 5th was the most likely pick they would get in 2023.  After that happened, the 5th was still the most likely pick they would get in 2024.</p>

<p>They slowly trimmed all the other vets around them after that.</p>

<p>You can’t just trade Lauri right away while he’s breaking out to all nba levels. They’ve done everything right. It’s an OKC 2.0 situation</p>

      <label for="lbm8b4g" class="commentText"><p>You know I think Danny Ainge might know something about the benefits of keeping a functional nba team together while rebuilding rather than bottoming out and hoping that prolonged sucking doesn&rsquo;t lead to issues with team culture or fucking up young players development. You might say he&rsquo;s got first hand experience at avoiding  flawed rebuilding process.</p>

      <label for="lbm8qag" class="commentText"><p>What a terrible job Ainge has done of stacking major draft assets and players in order to build teams. He doesn’t even succeed on every single deal he explores.</p>

<p>I remember hearing this stuff in the mid-00’s in Boston before he took all that stuff he accumulated and built a championship team.</p>

<p>And I remember it in 2019 after he built another contender but Hayward got hurt and Kyrie ghosted and his plans were scuttled. And when they were one game away from the finals in the bubble. “Why did they sign Kemba??”</p>

<p>And I remember it from 2021 after covid and everyone wanted him to trade one of the Jays but he refused and oh how dumb he must be!
Yet now the team he built won the title again. Remember who hired Brad when you’re going him credit for his smart moves.</p>

<p>Ainge doesn’t make moves fast enough for Andy Larsen, I guess, but the Jazz got huge hauls from Gobert and Mitchell. They have a Celtics level war chest now and a few very tradeable players at key salary points on their roster, including the most in demand trade piece on the market.</p>

<p>This seems like a good situation for the Jazz created through top level management.</p>
