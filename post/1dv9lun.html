      <blockquote>
<p>The Jazz’s goals have been bold, sure. First, they hoped to acquire Brooklyn forward Mikal Bridges via trade. They then hoped that would give them a springboard to sign Clippers star Paul George.</p>

<p>But while I can defend the Jazz losing out on the big game as a net positive, I can’t really defend the process used. For the last two seasons, the Jazz have existed in limbo. They’ve avoided being competitive by being sellers at the deadline, but avoided tanking by making buys like John Collins and extending Jordan Clarkson. The only way that strategy makes sense is if you quickly add talent and escape mediocrity.</p>

<p>The Jazz never really had a chance to do that other than via hope and prayer. Hoping a star the likes of George chooses to move to Utah? Praying Luka Doncic gets mad at his management in Dallas? Hoping a competitor the likes of Jrue Holiday will prefer a trade to Utah over the chance to win a championship with Boston? Praying the league keeps their bids for Bridges low?</p>

<p>It’s been wishcasting, not good management.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/07/02/andy-larsen-lauri-markkanen-trade/" target="_blank">https://www.sltrib.com/sports/jazz/2024/07/02/andy-larsen-lauri-markkanen-trade/</a></p>

<p>More at the link, but paywalled. The entire article is good. Ainge has been extremely aggressive going after star players and has failed spectacularly every single time, striking out on Porzingis, Jrue, Dejounte Murray, Mikal Bridges, and Paul George. The odds of getting any of those players while not overpaying were ridiculously low, but Ainge built the team around the idea that they could add two more stars around Markkanen and be ready to compete for a title right away. He probably could have gotten more for Markkanen at last deadline (due to him having two years on his contract) and looks to have fucked up.</p>

      <label for="lbn1750" class="commentText"><p>Usage.</p>

<p>Lauri was under a coach that really didn’t know how to use or develop young talent in CHI. They just featured Zach Lavine chucking up shots.</p>

<p>In CLE, he was the 3rd or 4th option on offense and was considered an afterthought. Garland and Mobley were considered the franchise pillars. Shots were sparse and maybe out of position?</p>

<p>In UTA, he became the defacto #1. I think they wanted to feature him to inflate his trade value, but EVERYONE underestimated his ability and he thrived due to the high usage. Because of his improvement, the Jazz finished the season better than Ainge anticipated. He got the green light in UTAH and he just ran with it. Funny how confidence and opportunity changes things.</p>

      <label for="lbn5qef" class="commentText"><p>It is tangential to all that, but primarily Lauri is strong with the ball in his hands in a way that the Bulls completely failed to develop, instead trying to make him be late career Dirk with pick and pops and catch and shoot looks.</p>

<p>Lauri got more diverse looks and more time at his natural position as the 3 in Cleveland, and played really well. Then the Jazz just ran with that once they got him - but it wasn&rsquo;t about being the &ldquo;#1&rdquo; it was about teams giving him the right looks, plays, and overall approach that the Bulls completely whiffed on (which they also did in that era with Coby White, Carter Jr, and basically anybody not named LaVine.)</p>

      <label for="lbn9hi1" class="commentText"><p>As a Cavs fan, another reply mentions usage and I think that, plus experience, is the right answer. The issue with the Cavs wasn’t him playing SF. He was awesome at it for the same reasons he’s been good in Utah - he’s a dangerous shooter with quick feet and some ability to dribble. Ironically, we haven’t been able to find a replacement 3 that commands as much gravity as he did (Strus is closer to a 2, but has been a step in the right direction). He did a lot to make the Mobley-Allen pairing work and held up way better than I expected guarding wings. I won’t pretend to have expected what happened in Utah with Lauri, but I think Cavs fans were a lot less surprised than most. He was awesome for us and showed a lot of what is happening in Utah on a smaller scale. It hurt a massive amount to give him up in the trade before he became what he’s been in Utah.</p>

<p>So I respect trying to build something around him, but it&rsquo;s been a year at least of no direction. Last two years we&rsquo;ve actually played promising basketball before tanking at the deadline and another year of that makes no sense. Imo we need to sell or we need to sign enough talent that we look like we can make a playoff push.</p>

      <label for="lbmn3ji" class="commentText"><p>I don’t understand why he’s refusing to listen to reasonable offers for Lauri. I’m not saying give him away for free, but by all accounts there are multiple teams in the 4-6 FRP range + talented players. If you do 4 FRPs + Kuminga from the warriors whats rumoured, you can either keep kuminga or sell him onto us for 2 extra FRPs is my guess. That’s 6 FRPs for Lauri on a one year deal.</p>

      <label for="lbn9l6w" class="commentText"><p>My guess is that the reason Ainge hasn&rsquo;t agreed to a trade like that is because either the offer doesn&rsquo;t actually exist or the picks aren&rsquo;t nearly as good as they sound at first glance. If Ainge was offered six premium, unprotected picks for Lauri, I&rsquo;d assume the deal would already be done.</p>

He’s a specialist at finding teams desperate to make a move (usually with bad GMs or new owners) and taking them for everything they have.

<p>So if the Jazz want to avoid him hitting FA as the only way to get his money, they need to renegotiate his current salary before they extend him, which they can’t do until august. So about $15 million is likely set aside for that. </p>

<p>I used to have this complaint when he was the GM but with hindsight I think I&rsquo;ve changed my mind. I recall 2 types of trade talks - the ones involving trading Tatum or Brown for an established All-star, and the trade deadlines ones when he had the opportunity to trade for players that would&rsquo;ve been minor upgrades but probably not put them into serious contention (especially when LeBron was still on the Cavs). And him hoarding those assets enabled Brad to use them to get the likes of White, Jrue, Zinger, etc.</p>

<p>I guess the question is, could Ainge have done things differently so the Celtics won sooner than this year? Maybe, but I can&rsquo;t pinpoint a trade he missed that would&rsquo;ve been better than the current timeline. I agree he felt the need to win every trade but I also think other GMs were just less inclined to trade with him because of his success in previous trades. He did have some rough drafts. PG complaints are valid but also no one expected anything out of Thomas when he arrived.</p>

The Warriors have a bit of a limitation on trading far out picks due to their 2030 pick being owed to Washington and seem reluctant to part with Kuminga, the Kings can’t trade next years pick, and the Spurs don’t have a lot of pressure to trade a lot of picks for a guy already in his prime that needs a big contract but isn’t a superstar.</p>

<p>Also he’s expiring so he could end up being a 1 year rental if he doesn’t like where he’s traded to</p>

<p>i like andy a lot, but this particular take from him feels like it&rsquo;s just a very well-written fan article. it&rsquo;s an opinion, not a report.</p>

He just lets out his inner fan sometimes and it gets on the players the wrong way. He called out Donovan for his atrocious defense and decision making in his last season, which Donovan obviously was guilty of but didn’t appreciate. Same with Royce on his efforts on rebounding.</p>

      <label for="lbm8b4g" class="commentText"><p>You know I think Danny Ainge might know something about the benefits of keeping a functional nba team together while rebuilding rather than bottoming out and hoping that prolonged sucking doesn&rsquo;t lead to issues with team culture or fucking up young players development. You might say he&rsquo;s got first hand experience at avoiding  flawed rebuilding process.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just revisionism at this point - he could&rsquo;ve easily won a second Executive of the Year award for the Boston rebuild, but people here seem to latch onto the last 1 or 2 years as if it overshadows all the amazing work he did</p>

      <label for="lbmoylg" class="commentText"><p>Hey it’s my article! Thanks y’all for reading, discussing, etc.</p>

<p>I guess the bit of context I would add is that the Jazz FO has been telling reporters and fans since the Don/Rudy trades that the plan wasn’t a full rebuild, just a quick retooling in which they would use their assets and cap space to acquire stars.</p>

<p>The point of the column (and it is that, an opinion column, which I’m thankful the Trib lets me write) is that the quick retooling plan was always a bit too optimistic given Utah’s troubles with acquiring FAs and their unwillingness to overspend in trades. A full rebuild would always be necessary, and ideally that would have started earlier in the last two seasons, not just at the trade deadline of them.</p>

      <label for="lbnor8v" class="commentText"><p>Thanks for the great work, Andy! Always really valuable to get your honest feedback. I know that this isn&rsquo;t exactly an AMA, but if you&rsquo;ve got the time, I would be curious to hear your thoughts: do you view this kind of &ldquo;hard tank&rdquo; that you&rsquo;re calling for as the only legitimate way for us to build a championship contender? I hear where you&rsquo;re coming from, and I can&rsquo;t deny that it has absolutely worked for other teams in the past, but I just can&rsquo;t get behind the idea that managing a professional basketball team is as simple as &ldquo;be as bad as you can possibly be until you get your superstar&rdquo;. People talk about how the middle is the worst place to be, and I hear where they&rsquo;re coming from, but it feels like we often ignore the very serious costs of fully embracing the bottom. Along with damaging revenue (which absolutely matters), you run the risk of hindering the development of young players and fostering a losing culture (see Charlotte).</p>

<p>If you want to live by the lottery, you had better be ready to die by the lottery. I&rsquo;ll tell you what this rebuild is really missing: <strong>luck</strong>. Even if we were to maximize our odds at a top pick, going from a 6% chance of landing Flagg to a 14% chance of landing Flagg by trading Lauri still requires luck. The Spurs rebuild is going great, and they are doing a terrific job of developing their players, but let&rsquo;s be real: they got lucky. 86 times out of 100, they don&rsquo;t get Wemby.</p>

<p>I agree that Luka coming here is a pipe dream within a pipe dream. But honestly, I think that whatever path we choose to take, we just have to get lucky. There&rsquo;s obviously more that we can do to directly stack the deck, but is that return really worth the risk? Making smart moves, managing your assets well, trusting your scouting department to find gems, and maintaining flexibility for opportunities as they arise honestly doesn&rsquo;t feel like too bad of a strategy.</p>

<p>Again, always a great read. Thanks for what you do, and enjoy the holiday!</p>

<p>Why can’t they just keep Lauri and monitor the market for distressed assets like Dallas did when it acquired Kyrie, or Boston with Porzingis? If Utah can hit on one or two of those perfect fits while keeping Lauri it should be a quick ride back to contention.</p>

      <label for="lbmnlml" class="commentText"><p>I think his point is that they could be building like OKC. It looked like that was the direction they were going when they traded their best two players (Mitchell and Gobert) for young talent and picks. Same thing OKC did (Russ and PG).</p>

<p>But OKC proceeded to purge the whole rest of the roster too, including the unexpected positive asset they got in the Russ trade (trading CP3, Adams, Gallinari, Schroder, etc.). They then kept trading the players they got in those deals too (Oubre, Ariza, etc.) before they ever set foot on the floor. The Thunder tore things down to the studs to focus on getting high draft picks. The Jazz could have done that too, but instead they acquired John Collins, re-signed Clarkson, and stayed in no man’s land.</p>

      <label for="lbnfe9p" class="commentText"><p>I think it comes down to a difference in ownership. Idk much about OKC’s ownership group, but I imagine they were fine with sacrificing ticket sales for a couple years while the Thunder were in the <em>really</em> bad part of rebuilding. It doesn’t look like the same is true for the Jazz owner, in fact the whole “big game hunting” approach to free agency this year was <a href="https://sportsnaut.com/utah-jazz-owner-wants-stars-5-options/amp/" target="_blank">his idea</a>.</p>

<p>I think the Jazz owner wants to compete, but consistently filling seats seems to be his higher priority, even if it means Utah will be stuck in mediocrity as a result. Frustrating how much an owner can singlehandedly impact team building.</p>

<p>Give someone like Presti picks and he will restock a team to be a championship contender, guaranteed.  We are going to find out if the same if true for Ainge.</p>

<p>Disagree, Lauri&rsquo;s value is at an all time high rn and up until the deadline due to his cheap contract and the new CBA cap rules. Once he signs a new contract, he&rsquo;s going to be a lot harder to move unless it&rsquo;s to a non-contender with lots of cap space.</p>

<p>Whether or not Ainge can come to agreement with a team who wants Lauri on how much he gets back for him is a whole nother question tho&hellip;</p>

      <label for="lbm4z3m" class="commentText"><p>Disagree, Siakam was an expiring at the wrong time for y&rsquo;all - new CBA rules change everything and getting Birds rights is way more important now for teams that haven&rsquo;t gone over either apron yet. Even more importantly tho, Lauri&rsquo;s contract is only <span class="math inline">\(18 mil while Siakam's was \)</span>34 mil before the extension - $18 mil for a player of Lauri&rsquo;s tier gives Ainge even more leverage because that&rsquo;s how team&rsquo;s like GSW can fit him in without going over the apron. Again, all this really comes down to is if someone offers Ainge enough assets but if no one does, he&rsquo;ll just re-sign Lauri instead.</p>

      <label for="lbmgqnn" class="commentText"><p>This is what happens when you convince yourself that multi year tanking solves all problems. Every thing he outlined is straight out of the Ainge Celtics playbook. Ainge acquired great assets and an excellent young head coach, and they overperformed for their talent level. Nobody thought Lauri would be an all-star when he was acquired, and when he was it both greatly increased his value and opened up the potential to build a competitive team around him if they could acquire another star player. Now that that’s not really an option, he can still sell high on Lauri and tank one year for Cooper Flagg while still sitting on a big stockpile of assets. This is a pretty solid blueprint for a rebuild.</p>

Add Kessler who came out of nowhere as Gobert replacement immediately. Now Sexton got better and is looking like a really decent starter and then Keyontae George, another rookie who flew past everyone&rsquo;s eyes is actually decent. You can&rsquo;t blame them. Kessler was picked at #22, George was #16. Who expects that these rookies will be contributors in their rookie season? I really think it&rsquo;s just the Utah&rsquo;s ways of building their team. This happened with Hayward, this happened with Donovan, and it is happening to them again.</p>

      <label for="lbnaock" class="commentText"><p>Hoping Luka leaves Dallas is fucking wild to me. Like the expectations are limited as fuck if your main plan is to hope a superstar just happens to become disgruntled and wants to leave.</p>

<p>I personally thought it was strange they went the route they did. They blew it all up and then signed Markannen, Kessler doesn’t even get the minutes he needs bc Collins. We all marvel at the Big Man schemes they implement but again , it hurt someone’s development. I’m glad they are letting Keyonte George cook a little and not holding him back.</p>

      <label for="lbo3gtp" class="commentText"><p>I suspect (no real info to support this other than following the league for 25 years) it’s a combo of new-owner-syndrome AKA Ryan Smith wanting the front office to pursue stars, and Danny-Ainge-syndrome AKA only willing to make a trade if he’s the obvious winner of said trade. And the franchise may be kinda screwed because of it.</p>

      <label for="lbm8qag" class="commentText"><p>What a terrible job Ainge has done of stacking major draft assets and players in order to build teams. He doesn’t even succeed on every single deal he explores.</p>

<p>I remember hearing this stuff in the mid-00’s in Boston before he took all that stuff he accumulated and built a championship team.</p>

<p>And I remember it in 2019 after he built another contender but Hayward got hurt and Kyrie ghosted and his plans were scuttled. And when they were one game away from the finals in the bubble. “Why did they sign Kemba??”</p>

<p>And I remember it from 2021 after covid and everyone wanted him to trade one of the Jays but he refused and “oh how dumb he must be!”</p>

<p>Yet now the team he built won the title again. Remember who hired Brad when you’re going him credit for his smart moves.</p>

<p>Ainge doesn’t make moves fast enough for Andy Larsen, I guess, but the Jazz got huge hauls from Gobert and Mitchell. They have a Celtics level war chest now and a few very tradeable players at key salary points on their roster, including the most in demand trade piece on the market.</p>

<p>This seems like a good situation for the Jazz created through top level management.</p>

<p>I think the best time to have traded Lauri was last season. 2024 draft didn&rsquo;t have a generational talent, but the goal would have been to fleece as many 2025 picks in 2023.</p>

<p>Now teams are trying to hold their 2025 picks and Lauri&rsquo;s contract max extension complicates things.</p>

      <label for="lbmjvmt" class="commentText"><p>Are we forgetting that Danny has fleeced the futures ofnot one but two small market teams (who both have a mediocre track record)?</p>

<p>They over performed their first year with Lauri showing he&rsquo;s a baller and missed out on Wembanyama. Last year there was no great prize to tank for so may as well use it as a gap year to figure out what guys you want to stick around. Kessler and George are both interesting prospects who could be good role players. Lauri is entering his prime and getting paid roughly the same as Klay, less than Vucevic and about half of Khris Middleton; someone will over pay for him.</p>

<p>I would blow it up, shoot for his positioning in the draft the next 2 years. At that point the picks from MIN and CLE and whoever they send Lauri too could become insanely valuable. Danny knows more about basketball than 99% of people, last see what he cooks up (Paul George was never gonna go to SLC btw).</p>

      <label for="lbofgi8" class="commentText"><p>Did he really &ldquo;fleece the future&rdquo; of the Cavs and Wolves though? He got lots of picks but he didn&rsquo;t take any of their core or most valuable players (Lauri is valuable but not to the Cavs like Garland, Mobley or Allen were) and both teams have many young players and futures.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub> of the Wolves players are 25 or under, including their best player (22) and young core. They just drafted a lottery pick and a player who could be their PG of the future in Ant&rsquo;s prime and he&rsquo;s only 19. Danny Ainge didn&rsquo;t take any of that promising future away. If anything, he helped their core players develop with valuable playoff experience which will only make them better in the future.</p>

<p>This &ldquo;took their future&rdquo; narrative is so overblown.</p>

All of this then becomes his own worst enemy. He consistently overvalues both his own players and his draft picks. His insistence, and his amazing track record on winning trades, hurts him as less teams are willing to be on the bad end of trades. It’s a double edged sword, his greatness eventually hurts his teams.</p>

The last couple of years have proven that being the worst team in the league doesn&rsquo;t guarantee you a star pick (Detroit know this far too well). Being meh at least gives you the potential to attract a star free agent and having a co-star increases that chance further. If Ainge traded away the house and they got shafted in the lottery twice while being the worst team in the league, would this guy and any other Jazz fan be much happier?</p>

      <label for="lbn2ft4" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m still wondering why they haven&rsquo;t made a Markannen trade even though we&rsquo;re only a few days into FA. Aside from George, Kessler, Hendricks and their rookies they just drafted they&rsquo;ve not a lot of future developmental pieces. Collins deal is likely to finish out in Utah while they can trade off Sexton and Clarkson near the deadline if they perform as they have been.</p>

<p>Markannen would net them at least 4 first rounders along with a decent rotation piece plus filler.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just concerned because the majority of FA is over and the haven&rsquo;t moved the needle.</p>

<p>Lauri isn&rsquo;t going to be saving this team as constructed. His existence prevents them from bottoming out. It is a good time to bottom out for this upcoming rookie class. There isn&rsquo;t going to be a better time for them to do so. San Antonio added Paul and 4th pick, Portland was injured like crazy last year and isn&rsquo;t likely to be as bad as last season, Memphis hopefully won&rsquo;t have Ja being a gangster wannabe on insta live again.</p>

<p>They need to finish last in this conference for progress to be made.</p>

<p>He did some really great work up until his last 4 years in Boston. He&rsquo;d hoard picks and overvalued the assets he accrued until it was too late. Then he&rsquo;d whiff on a trade and end up having to use EVERY pick he stacked up.</p>

<p>Lot of very close calls on decisions he was talked out of - Josh Jackson  &amp;gt; Tatum, Dragan Bender &amp;gt; Jaylen. Trying to trade the Tatum/Brown picks for Justise Winslow. Wanting to build around Kyrie by considering moving the J&rsquo;s for AD. Drafting James Young, Romeo Langford, Zizic, Poirier, Yabu, Carsen Edwards, etc etc etc</p>

<p>He DID make some great moves (swindels) but alot of it was getting lucky. Ainge is past his prime and out of touch.</p>

Like, if you didn&rsquo;t like this draft, just let Hardy get them to the playoffs. If you want the picks, don&rsquo;t even give them a chance to compete like that. It&rsquo;s honestly just really annoying to see them work out a good rotation and then tear it apart for barely anything of value. I feel like a Play-In game would&rsquo;ve been more valuable than the crap he got back at the deadline.</p>

I can understand being mad at the lack of direction. Lauri definitely should’ve been traded. Asking the Jazz to tank is not realistic. They added John Collins because they thought he would make them better. It’s not like they maxed him or made the #1 guy on the team. What are they supposed to do? Sit around and hope they get the fifth pick every year like the Pistons? </p>

      <label for="lbpgbfk" class="commentText"><p>Utah would be mad to trade Laurie&hellip; he&rsquo;s a good player and seems to like it there. Are you going to get a better player, who probably doesn&rsquo;t want to be there and how many picks do you need. Also the threat of trade over a length of time destroys team morale.</p>

      <label for="lbpvqfe" class="commentText"><p>As a Boston fan, Ainge plotted and schemed to acquire a “star” (who remembers him taking KD to the Hampton?!) while stockpiling draft assets.</p>

<p>Those draft assets just won a title. Ainge only acquired Kyrie and struck out on all his other swings at a star. And…scoreboard.</p>

<p>Andy Larsen apparently knows nothing about basketball. This article is a big pile of horseshit.</p>

      <label for="lbquzmh" class="commentText"><p>did ainge really go after those stars though?</p>

<p>even when he was with Boston he had a whole trove of picks he could have traded but never did, yet was always rumored to be big game hunting.</p>

<p>I think he just leaks these things so people think he&rsquo;s trying rather than just sitting on that draft capital</p>
