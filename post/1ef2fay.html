      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ef2fay/lebron_james_was_already_becoming_well_known_in/"><p>LeBron James was already becoming well known in 2002. In 2024 he is still a top player in the world. How much does his longevity distort the reception of NBA players in general?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>If you were 8 years old in 2003, You have no real world perception of time, especially in terms of what time does to an athlete. For all you know, LeBron James has <em>always</em> been in the NBA.</p>

<p>Of course you learn these things as you get older, but now you&rsquo;re almost 30, you may have an 8 year old of your own, and he also becomes a fan of the NBA and LeBron James.</p>

<p>LeBron isn&rsquo;t coming off the bench to play a few minutes in a swan song season the way most players his age do. And most of the truly great players retire a couple years earlier because they don&rsquo;t want to be seen as anything less than great. They don&rsquo;t want to fade away. Either that or they are physically unable to continue playing.</p>

<p>There are parent and child duos watching LeBron James be the best player on the floor where that has been the case for as long as the parent can remember. Read that again. Has that <em>ever</em> happened for the NBA before? Does MJ count? He was no where near as effective in his wizards years, and his return, while interesting, had an &ldquo;Old Man coming back to give it one more go&rdquo; vibe. While LeBron is Old, he&rsquo;s still as effective as he&rsquo;s ever been, and voted the best player on the best team in the world.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s an entire generation of people who know logically, because people can&rsquo;t shut up about it (including myself, clearly), how rare this is. But it distorts the reality of what people are capable of and I think that will have a lasting affect on people&rsquo;s perception of NBA players for years to come.</p>

      <label for="lfi25go" class="commentText"><p>LeBron distorts everything because he single-handedly obliterates the peak vs longevity argument which is huge in every sport.</p>

<p>What even is his “peak”? The fucker has like three separate primes. And his longevity is beyond insane, how many “youngest to” <em>and</em> “oldest to” records does he hold? Last season at 39 he averaged 26/7/8 on a comical 63% TS, basically better than his already ridiculous career averages. At 39.</p>

<p>I’m not gonna delve into the endless GOAT debate but Bron, at the risk of stating the obvious, sure as fuck has a lot going for him.</p>

      <label for="lfib0zw" class="commentText"><p>At risk of being a heretic and wading into the &ldquo;best&rdquo; v &ldquo;greatest&rdquo; argument, I think the Brady comparison actually undersells LeBron. </p>

<p>For all his longevity, Brady was always <em>one of</em> the top QBs but he only was first team all-pro 3x, compared to 7x for Manning and 4x for Rodgers.  </p>

<p>LeBron was first team all NBA 13x!!!</p>

<p>So while Brady was consistently excellent for 20+ years, more often than not other QBs were considered better than him in a given year. LeBron was pretty consistently considered the best player in the league for over a decade. You couldn&rsquo;t really say that about Brady. </p>

<p>Like you&rsquo;d still be able to find a lot of people that think Rodgers has the best talent ever or even Mahomes. Brady just wins more due to circumstance, team building, pay cuts etc.</p>

      <label for="lfiehs8" class="commentText"><p>Brady was not considered the best during that time. Manning won his last SB in 2015 still and set records in 2013. Brady very well may be the goat overall, but he was seen as one of the best, as opposed to the best, for most of his career. For instance individual accolades manning has 5 MVPs and Rogers with 4, compared to Brady&rsquo;s 3. Obviously Tom has more post season success, but at the same time football is much more of a team sport and less reliant on 1 individual compared to NBA.</p>

      <label for="lfie9p4" class="commentText"><p>Rodgers people aren&rsquo;t saying that he&rsquo;s the goat, just the better QB in a lot of seasons. Best v greatest. Brady&rsquo;s two big GOAT claims are his Superbowls (which no one can touch), and his longevity. He was a top 5 QB for 20 years, but he wasn&rsquo;t number 1 for most of them (not a knock against him, would be insane if he was). But he was consistently number 2-5 each season, with maybe 5-6 seasons as the best QB. Brees and Rodgers definitely had better seasons/multi-season stretches than Brady in that 2007-2018 window where they were considered above him, but Brady has always had the postseason success they didnt.</p>

      <label for="lfidney" class="commentText"><p>Tom Brady was first team all-pro and MVP in 2007, 2010, and 2017&hellip;that&rsquo;s 8 seasons in your 11 year period when contemporary voters thought another QB was better.</p>

<p>In that same 11 year window, Manning won MVP and was first team all-pro 3x too, so there certainly was still an argument with Manning during this period too. Especially in 2013 when Manning broke every passing record.</p>

<p>Like I said, at least from 2007 (the first Moss year) onwards, Brady was a unanimous top 5 QB, but more often than not people were picking Manning, Rodgers, or a random guy with a hot year (Matt Ryan and Cam Newton) over him.</p>

      <label for="lficeza" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, Brady was obviously great, but if you’re being completely honest even as a Brady fan, he was never the undisputed best player in the league. He had a good argument several seasons, but even during his prime, you could make a pretty convincing argument that a guy like Aaron Rodgers was better. Lebron was pretty indisputably the best player in the league from about 2011-2017, and you could make arguments to tack on another half a dozen years to that</p>

<p>You couldn&rsquo;t really say that about Brady.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you pretty easily could, you just have to not use all-pro and all-NBA selections as a comparison.</p>

<p>In the blind which QB are you picking for first team all pro here?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>3837 yards, 60% completion percentage, 35:10 TD:int, 636 rushing yards</p></li>

<li><p>4024 yards, 68% completion percentage, 34:8 TD:int, 553 rushing yards</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Brady is neither of these players, this season he had 4770 yards, 36:7 TD:int and 65% completion percentage, while his rushing threat is non existent, he still had more yards than either of these QB&rsquo;s &ndash; one of those people won the MVP, one of them didn&rsquo;t receive an MVP vote</p>

      <label for="lfiii04" class="commentText"><p>After Cleveland won in 2016, I said he was the best basketball player that ever played.</p>

<p>Beating that Golden State team, especially from down 3-1, is probably the greatest thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen in basketball. He was utterly unstoppable. He controlled every aspect of the game and was literally the best player on the court at everything. He was the best scorer, best defender, best rebounder, best playmaker.</p>

<p>It was astounding.</p>

      <label for="lfi7tap" class="commentText"><p>His peak is pretty obviously when he played in Miami to anyone who has watched his entire career.</p>

<p>People look at his offensive numbers but fail to realize how much easier it is to score now compared to 10 years ago.</p>

<p>His defense has been laughable at best for years at this point which is understandable but so far removed from his peak.</p>

<p>If you could put 2013 LeBron in today&rsquo;s game, he is averaging a 35 point triple double on DPOY level defense. The Lakers would be obvious title favorites.</p>

<p>Instead, he is a fringe top 10 guy. Still incredible for the oldest player in the league, but disrespectful to how good he was at his peak to make the comparison.</p>

Leading both teams in every major stat in 2015 iirc, coming back down 1-3 against the greatest regular season team in 16, as well as the LeBronto performances and respective playoff runs are a crazy peak as well.</p>

Thats just where he learned to tie it all together while still being WAY more athletic than everyone else. 2017-2018 I would say was his peak. His athleticism was still there (See Nurkic) but my god the way he just controlled the pace of every single game. He could score in any way he wanted, when he wanted and however he wanted. It was absolutely nuts. It makes me emotional watching him be the best on team USA because we all know whats coming. The end</p>

It might be relatively easy to be the youngest to do something when you&rsquo;re drafted right out of high school. But after all that mileage, I don&rsquo;t think anyone in the world would have thought he could be in the league at all let alone still capable of so much. Remember when Skip Bayless said LeBron was fading away back when he was in his early thirties? He&rsquo;s had an entire NBA career of success since then And he&rsquo;s still going strong. Lmao</p>

      <label for="lficiyv" class="commentText"><p>Trying to use absolute ts% when &ldquo;relative to averge ts&rdquo; is a much better way of determining a players relative impact. 2. The peak argument is always relation to MJ who in 89-91 did 34 points per 75 on +7% true shooting. I do believe that MJ gap in peak and prime is greater than Lebrons ability to be good very early and keep as close to his prime as as possible.</p>

      <label for="lfiiy9b" class="commentText"><p>To calculate the probability that LeBron James has had at least one game with a 27/7/7 stat line over his 1779 game career, we can use the principles of probability and independence.</p>

<p>First, let’s define the events:</p>

<ul>
<li>( A ): LeBron scores 27 points in a game.</li>
<li>( B ): LeBron has 7 rebounds in a game.</li>
<li>( C ): LeBron has 7 assists in a game.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the data provided:</p>

<ul>
<li>( P(A) = \frac{215}{1779} )</li>
<li>( P(B) = \frac{215}{1779} )</li>
<li>( P&copy; = \frac{209}{1779} )</li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming the events are independent, the probability that LeBron has a 27/7/7 game in any single game is:
[ P(A \cap B \cap C) = P(A) \times P(B) \times P&copy; ]</p>

<p>Let’s calculate this:
[ P(A \cap B \cap C) = \left( \frac{215}{1779} \right) \times \left( \frac{215}{1779} \right) \times \left( \frac{209}{1779} \right) ]</p>

<p>Now, to find the probability that he never had a 27/7/7 game in 1779 games, we calculate the probability of the complement event:
[ P(\text{no 27/7/7 game}) = \left( 1 - P(A \cap B \cap C) \right)^{1779} ]</p>

<p>Then, the probability that he had at least one game with a 27/7/7 stat line is:
[ P(\text{at least one 27/7/7 game}) = 1 - P(\text{no 27/7/7 game}) ]</p>

<p>Let’s calculate this step by step.</p>

<p>First, calculate ( P(A \cap B \cap C) ):
[ P(A \cap B \cap C) = \left( \frac{215}{1779} \right) \times \left( \frac{215}{1779} \right) \times \left( \frac{209}{1779} \right) \approx \left( 0.1209 \right) \times \left( 0.1209 \right) \times \left( 0.1175 \right) \approx 0.0017 ]</p>

<p>Now, calculate ( P(\text{no 27/7/7 game}) ):
[ P(\text{no 27/7/7 game}) = \left( 1 - 0.0017 \right)^{1779} \approx 0.048 ]</p>

<p>Finally, calculate ( P(\text{at least one 27/7/7 game}) ):
[ P(\text{at least one 27/7/7 game}) = 1 - 0.048 = 0.952 ]</p>

<p>Therefore, the probability that LeBron James had at least one game with a 27/7/7 stat line over his career is approximately 95.2%.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I corrected the calc using statmuse and got 85.3% probability, assuming 257 reg season or playoffs games with 7 assists, 244 games with 7 rebounds, and 95 games with 27 points</p>

While considering the occurrences of individual stats (27 points, 7 rebounds, 7 assists) it&rsquo;s the probability of having such a stat line at least once on his 1492 games. We are also considering each game as independent event, but they are not in reality.</p>

He’s still top 5 to me when he’s going but that form where he’s prime Lebron can’t be on for a full game even. There’s just no way he can defend like Prime Lebron for more than a few possessions at a time and the offensive workload can even be too heavy for him most games. Its why the Lakers and him really wanted a 3rd star and even gambled on Westbrook, they both knew this day would come. They just whiffed on that trade and can’t pick-up the right pieces.</p>

<p>I think he&rsquo;d be the #1 player you&rsquo;d take for a full series.</p>

<p>For a full, long season, he&rsquo;s closer to that 9-12 range. His ability to hold up a full season + playoffs is the only thing his age has really taken from him.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s why the Lakers suddenly became the dominant force in the bubble after 3-4 months off going right into warmup + playoffs.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;ve barely been a playoff team otherwise.</p>

      <label for="lfi9f2e" class="commentText"><p>Also consider that Kareem had to spend 4 years in college when he was clearly at worst a top 10 player in the world the day he set for on the UCLA campus. That was in 1965. In 1985 he won finals MVP, in 1986 he was first team all NBA. And he did that without much of the amazing training and medical benefits LeBron had been able to take advantage of. If Kareem had entered the league as young as LeBron was the scoring record may still require 2 more elite seasons from LeBron and all while making but a single three point bucket.</p>

      <label for="lfijn89" class="commentText"><p>Kareem is the closest guy to Lebron in this aspect, he was ahead of his time in how well he took care of his body. Lowkey Kareem is still pretty underrated because of how much everyone loves Magic, he was still the best player on most of those Showtime teams after winning a championship in the early 1970&rsquo;s. This is like if Wizards MJ was still in the running for MVP in 2002 and 2003</p>

<p>The same will happen in due time for some of the current day greats. Especially LeBron.</p>

      <label for="lfifr5g" class="commentText"><p>Don&rsquo;t think this is the same, MLS and playing in International tournaments would be the equivalent of LeBron playing G League and Olympics. Starting for Barca, fighting for champions leagues and la ligas isn&rsquo;t the same tier as playing MLS. It&rsquo;s just not. No disrespect to MLS but Europe&rsquo;s elite leagues are just a different kettle of fish.</p>

<p>Internationals are 6 games in 30 days, you can put your all into them. But Messi wouldn&rsquo;t have the fitness to start 50+ games at Barca, play 70+ mins in each and then play Copa America.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;d be similar to Kawhis minute restrictions, probably playing 25 league games, 4 group stage CL games, and 7-11 knock out cup games most likely, so about 60% of a season.</p>

<p>LeBron still plays like he&rsquo;s a 27 year old re games and however many minutes he needs, (likewise Ronaldo now, although he also shouldn&rsquo;t count due to Saudi league).</p>

Just a once in a lifetime combination + his hard work, it&rsquo;ll never be done again. And as an old head who watched Jordan, we can sit here picking nits about who had the higher peak, but LeBron is just unquestionably the most talented, most dominant human being who&rsquo;s ever played basketball, and now he has the greatest, most dominant career of all time. It&rsquo;ll never be done again. I can&rsquo;t imagine what his accolades would look like if he had been drafted by a competent team and he/Klutch kept their noses out of front office business. He probably has 3 more championships just by keeping his fuckin mouth shut lol</p>

<p>By the time he was drafted the Jordan level expectations were there and he somehow lived up the hype. Just unreal, and this is from someone who hasn&rsquo;t really been a fan of his after he left Cleveland in 2010.</p>

<p>Nowwwwwww that doesnt mean others ranked above him are accurate, like commonly embiid. But lebron being put at the bottom top 10 or just out isnt exactly wrong unless the list specifies every1 is fully healthy</p>

      <label for="lfi9ilz" class="commentText"><p>I totally agree. But there are 7 active players that are within 20,000 points of LeBron. KD is the closest&hellip;within about 12,000 points. Let&rsquo;s say they both retire at the same age&hellip;42. That&rsquo;s like 6 seasons of around 24.4 ppg and 82 games played per season to catch up&hellip;in my estimation. Is it probable? Probably not but he is the only one on the same hemisphere as LeBron James when we are talking points&hellip;and he is not even that close. Just a high thought and future prediction.</p>

      <label for="lfidxze" class="commentText"><p>You said assume both retire at 42, so 3 more seasons for Lebron, but then just assumed Lebron wouldn&rsquo;t score anymore points for your math to work out. So really you are assuming Lebron never scores another point.</p>

<p>If that were the case, KD would still need to play 6 seasons playing all 82 games and averaging 24.4 points. The same KD who has averaged 43 games played per season since his Achilles injury and hasn&rsquo;t played 82 games in a season since the 09-10 season (to be fair, he played 81 in both 12-13 and 13-14).</p>

<p>The odds of him playing 82 games a year, particularly at 40+, are basically zero. And while KD probably does age fairly gracefully due to his shooting ability and his size, it is an extreme rarity for players to be elite offensively at that age (or even play in the league at 40+). Then add in that literally nobody over 40 has averaged more than 20 points per game that season (MJ averaged exactly 20.0 his last season, which he was 39 at the start of and 40 at the end, and that&rsquo;s the best at that age).</p>

<p>So basically, it isn&rsquo;t happening. Lebron is going to keep padding his record, and KD just certainly won&rsquo;t have the longevity to come close to catching up.</p>

      <label for="lfic55w" class="commentText"><p>LeBron is the golden standard for basketball hands down. Nobody has accomplished longevity like him, hes had no off court issues, he&rsquo;s a great father, and you can tell his peers respect him. There are some flopping antics and complaining that I wish he never went so heavy on but besides that, he should never be treated the way the media treated him for a long time. He&rsquo;s a great guy who exceeded the biggest expectations any player has ever had.</p>

      <label for="lfice0z" class="commentText"><p>you can already see him distorting how we talk and think about some of the greats a bit younger than him reaching their mid-30s &ndash; I&rsquo;m talking Steph, KD, Westbrook, Harden, Jimmy, Kawhi, PG, Klay. whereas in the past we&rsquo;d be quicker to say well they&rsquo;re 33 or 35, it&rsquo;s expected that they&rsquo;re gonna lose a step, now there&rsquo;s a different level of scrutiny and expectation of consistency.</p>

<p>KD is a prime example imho. he still is obviously able to be a mvp type guy on occasion, but has low-key not been able to be consistent in three consecutive playoffs. it was clear in this last run, he&rsquo;s lost a step. which is 100% to be expected, he&rsquo;s freakin 35 and has had a lot of injuries. in the past, this would be normal and we&rsquo;d just accept it as the new reality. bc of lebron, we&rsquo;re clinging to some kinda false hope that KD can be the same guy again throughout a playoffs run.</p>

<p>ps I know this is bad timing to make this point about KD lol but if you watched him struggle against the timberwolves this should not be controversial.</p>

It’s like so many people who don’t even watch baseball still know who Nolan Ryan is, because he just played for so freaking long he became a part of the sports identity. Multiple generations of fans who witness greatness. Very similar to Tom Brady, he started playing at Michigan in 1995 and still passed for over 5,000 yards in while being ranked <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Top_100_Players_of_2022" target="_blank">the #1 player of 2022</a> that is absolutely nuts</p>

      <label for="lfiea3r" class="commentText"><p>I was in college and a huge NBA fan already when LeBron came into the league.  For me the craziest thing is the amount of hype he had coming in (ESPN would broadcast his high school games) and how he was able to actually live up to it.  There have been sooo many hyped up players throughout the decades, and most of them don’t live up to the hype.  Everyone knew LeBron was great, but many people thought he was getting too much press for not really achieving anything yet.  There was also a huge debate going on then about high school players entering the league because so many came in and just sucked. No one thought that would happen to LeBron, but they did feel when you had guys like Kwame Brown just enter the league from high school, was using high school competition to build someone up fair?</p>

<p>Obviously he proved all the naysayers wrong.  </p>

<p>Even more than on the court though, dude came into the league as the most hyped high school basketball player in decades, he got a shit ton of money and fame at 18, everyone annointed him as one of the goats by his early 20s, and he was able to keep his head straight the entire time he was in the league.  That’s amazing.  I know my dumbass at that age would not have been able to.  But he never had a huge scandal, never did something stupid.  His biggest “scandal” was publicly announcing that he was going to play in Miami with his friends? In hindsight how ridiculous was that?</p>

      <label for="lfidrxc" class="commentText"><p>He is clearly an outlier in more ways than one. I don&rsquo;t think he distorts any kind of reception because it would be illogical to compare really him to any other player than MJ, some may say Kobe. But especially his longevity, it&rsquo;s a bit unreal but at the same time I think he has taken better care of his body more than any other player, and ultimately has been pretty blessed with not having any major injuries.</p>

<p>I also don&rsquo;t value &ldquo;longevity&rdquo; that much when it comes to players legacies only due to the fact that some players get unlucky with injuries. I think it&rsquo;s important to note, and definitely adds to Lebron&rsquo;s legacy but it&rsquo;s not a defining factor for a great player imo.</p>

The craziest part is he was number 1 ranked for 428 weeks. Lebron has been around for 21 seasons and has 68 players of the week.</p>

<p>Lebron has had a great career and is a top 5 player all-time, but he&rsquo;s no Djokovic, meaning, he&rsquo;s not the GOAT.</p>

<p>The GOAT is obviously Patrick McCaw, who won 3 championships in his first three years and is now boning every <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> in Wilmington, Delaware.</p>

      <label for="lfil3wc" class="commentText"><p>For a really long time LeBron, Federer, and (time shifted a little earlier) Tiger Woods were the absolute pinnacle of their sports and always just there, constants.  Somehow LeBron has managed to outlast them in, I&rsquo;d argue, the most physically demanding of the three sports.</p>

      <label for="lfimraq" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s completely derailed any reasonable discussion about longevity.  What Al Horford is providing at his age should be celerated, but it barely even registers because he&rsquo;s a fraction of who we was ten years ago.  Steph and Durant are also aging gracefully, but the most you&rsquo;ll ever hear is people declaring that they&rsquo;re &ldquo;still good&rdquo; not &ldquo;capable of winning a championship with a few pieces&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lfimxl0" class="commentText"><p>The thing that is so dumbfounding to me is how infrequently people mention KD and Curry&rsquo;s longevity.</p>

<p>Durant just put up MVP numbers at age 35 and shows no sign of slowing, even after missing a season with a bad injury.</p>

<p>Curry just dropped 357 threes last year, third highest in NBA history at age 35, and nobody bats an eye.</p>

<p>Chris Paul led the league is assists at age 36. Nobody cared.</p>

<p>All because LeBron is a couple years older than each of them and is still playing like an All NBA player.</p>

<p>Yes. It distorts things big time.</p>
