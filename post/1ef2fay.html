      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ef2fay/lebron_james_was_already_becoming_well_known_in/"><p>LeBron James was already becoming well known in 2002. In 2024 he is still a top player in the world. How much does his longevity distort the reception of NBA players in general?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>If you were 8 years old in 2003, You have no real world perception of time, especially in terms of what time does to an athlete. For all you know, LeBron James has <em>always</em> been in the NBA.</p>

<p>Of course you learn these things as you get older, but now you&rsquo;re almost 30, you may have an 8 year old of your own, and he also becomes a fan of the NBA and LeBron James.</p>

<p>LeBron isn&rsquo;t coming off the bench to play a few minutes in a swan song season the way most players his age do. And most of the truly great players retire a couple years earlier because they don&rsquo;t want to be seen as anything less than great. They don&rsquo;t want to fade away. Either that or they are physically unable to continue playing.</p>

<p>There are parent and child duos watching LeBron James be the best player on the floor where that has been the case for as long as the parent can remember. Read that again. Has that <em>ever</em> happened for the NBA before? Does MJ count? He was no where near as effective in his wizards years, and his return, while interesting, had an &ldquo;Old Man coming back to give it one more go&rdquo; vibe. While LeBron is Old, he&rsquo;s still as effective as he&rsquo;s ever been, and voted the best player on the best team in the world.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s an entire generation of people who know logically, because people can&rsquo;t shut up about it (including myself, clearly), how rare this is. But it distorts the reality of what people are capable of and I think that will have a lasting affect on people&rsquo;s perception of NBA players for years to come.</p>

      <label for="lfi25go" class="commentText"><p>LeBron distorts everything because he single-handedly obliterates the peak vs longevity argument which is huge in every sport.</p>

<p>What even is his “peak”? The fucker has like three separate primes. And his longevity is beyond insane, how many “youngest to” <em>and</em> “oldest to” records does he hold? Last season at 39 he averaged 26/7/8 on a comical 63% TS, basically better than his already ridiculous career averages. At 39.</p>

<p>I’m not gonna delve into the endless GOAT debate but Bron, at the risk of stating the obvious, sure as fuck has a lot going for him.</p>

      <label for="lfib0zw" class="commentText"><p>At risk of being a heretic and wading into the &ldquo;best&rdquo; v &ldquo;greatest&rdquo; argument, I think the Brady comparison actually undersells LeBron. </p>

<p>For all his longevity, Brady was always <em>one of</em> the top QBs but he only was first team all-pro 3x, compared to 7x for Manning and 4x for Rodgers.  </p>

<p>LeBron was first team all NBA 13x!!!</p>

<p>So while Brady was consistently excellent for 20+ years, more often than not other QBs were considered better than him in a given year. LeBron was pretty consistently considered the best player in the league for over a decade. You couldn&rsquo;t really say that about Brady. </p>

<p>Like you&rsquo;d still be able to find a lot of people that think Rodgers has the best talent ever or even Mahomes. Brady just wins more due to circumstance, team building, pay cuts etc.</p>

      <label for="lficeza" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, Brady was obviously great, but if you’re being completely honest even as a Brady fan, he was never the undisputed best player in the league. He had a good argument several seasons, but even during his prime, you could make a pretty convincing argument that a guy like Aaron Rodgers was better. Lebron was pretty indisputably the best player in the league from about 2011-2017, and you could make arguments to tack on another half a dozen years to that</p>

      <label for="lfi7tap" class="commentText"><p>His peak is pretty obviously when he played in Miami to anyone who has watched his entire career.</p>

<p>People look at his offensive numbers but fail to realize how much easier it is to score now compared to 10 years ago.</p>

<p>His defense has been laughable at best for years at this point which is understandable but so far removed from his peak.</p>

<p>If you could put 2013 LeBron in today&rsquo;s game, he is averaging a 35 point triple double on DPOY level defense. The Lakers would be obvious title favorites.</p>

<p>Instead, he is a fringe top 10 guy. Still incredible for the oldest player in the league, but disrespectful to how good he was at his peak to make the comparison.</p>

<p>It’s just hard to pinpoint where Lebron Peak truly

<p>I wouldn’t blame anyone for saying</p>

<p>Cav years or Heat years</p>

<p>But in my personal opinion never seen something more dominant that Lebron Heat days. (After the 1st finals L)</p>

      <label for="lfi8w20" class="commentText"><p>His (playoff) peak can also be argued to be anywhere during the second Cavs stint tbh. Leading both teams in every major stat in 2015 iirc, coming back down 1-3 against the greatest regular season team in 16, as well as the LeBronto performances and respective playoff runs are a crazy peak as well.</p>

Thats just where he learned to tie it all together while still being WAY more athletic than everyone else. 2017-2018 I would say was his peak. His athleticism was still there (See Nurkic) but my god the way he just controlled the pace of every single game. He could score in any way he wanted, when he wanted and however he wanted. It was absolutely nuts. It makes me emotional watching him be the best on team USA because we all know whats coming. The end</p>

It might be relatively easy to be the youngest to do something when you&rsquo;re drafted right out of high school. But after all that mileage, I don&rsquo;t think anyone in the world would have thought he could be in the league at all let alone still capable of so much. Remember when Skip Bayless said LeBron was fading away back when he was in his early thirties? He&rsquo;s had an entire NBA career of success since then And he&rsquo;s still going strong. Lmao</p>

The peak argument is always relation to MJ who in 89-91 did 34 points per 75 on +7% true shooting. I do believe that MJ gap in peak and prime is greater than Lebrons ability to be good very early and keep as close to his prime as as possible.</p>

That was in 1965. In 1985 he won finals MVP, in 1986 he was first team all NBA. And he did that without much of the amazing training and medical benefits LeBron had been able to take advantage of. If Kareem had entered the league as young as LeBron was the scoring record may still require 2 more elite seasons from LeBron and all while making but a single three point bucket.</p>

<p>He made one pro bowl, no all pros, and didn’t get a fucking mvp vote until his 4th season.</p>

<p>Revisionist history man. The Tom Brady you think of really started appearing his 3rd/4th season in the league.</p>

<p>LeBron was getting mvp votes HIS FIRST SEASON.</p>

<p>His first 4 seasons he finished: 9th, 6th, 2nd, 5th.</p>

      <label for="lfi8y5m" class="commentText"><p>A combination of great genetics and incredible injury luck, in a total freak of a body, and the right kind of intellect. Just a once in a lifetime combination + his hard work, it&rsquo;ll never be done again. And as an old head who watched Jordan, we can sit here picking nits about who had the higher peak, but LeBron is just unquestionably the most talented, most dominant human being who&rsquo;s ever played basketball, and now he has the greatest, most dominant career of all time. It&rsquo;ll never be done again. I can&rsquo;t imagine what his accolades would look like if he had been drafted by a competent team and he/Klutch kept their noses out of front office business. He probably has 3 more championships just by keeping his fuckin mouth shut lol</p>

Bootleg highlight videos were shared on P2P networks like limewire and he was sorta considered a myth. Then his high school games started airing on ESPN.</p>

<p>By the time he was drafted the Jordan level expectations were there and he somehow lived up the hype. Just unreal, and this is from someone who hasn&rsquo;t really been a fan of his after he left Cleveland in 2010.</p>

Let&rsquo;s say they both retire at the same age&hellip;42. That&rsquo;s like 6 seasons of around 24.4 ppg and 82 games played per season to catch up&hellip;in my estimation. Is it probable? Probably not but he is the only one on the same hemisphere as LeBron James when we are talking points&hellip;and he is not even that close. Just a high thought and future prediction.</p>

      <label for="lfice0z" class="commentText"><p>you can already see him distorting how we talk and think about some of the greats a bit younger than him reaching their mid-30s &ndash; I&rsquo;m talking Steph, KD, Westbrook, Harden, Jimmy, Kawhi, PG, Klay. whereas in the past we&rsquo;d be quicker to say well they&rsquo;re 33 or 35, it&rsquo;s expected that they&rsquo;re gonna lose a step, now there&rsquo;s a different level of scrutiny and expectation of consistency.</p>

<p>KD is a prime example imho. he still is obviously able to be a mvp type guy on occasion, but has low-key not been able to be consistent in three consecutive playoffs. it was clear in this last run, he&rsquo;s lost a step. which is 100% to be expected, he&rsquo;s freakin 35 and has had a lot of injuries. in the past, this would be normal and we&rsquo;d just accept it as the new reality. bc of lebron, we&rsquo;re clinging to some kinda false hope that KD can be the same guy again throughout a playoffs run.</p>

<p>ps I know this is bad timing to make this point about KD lol but if you watched him struggle against the timberwolves this should not be controversial.</p>

It’s like so many people who don’t even watch baseball still know who Nolan Ryan is, because he just played for so freaking long he became a part of the sports identity. Multiple generations of fans who witness greatness. Very similar to Tom Brady, he started playing at Michigan in 1995 and still passed for over 5,000 yards in while being ranked <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Top_100_Players_of_2022" target="_blank">the #1 player of 2022</a> that is absolutely nuts</p>

      <label for="lfi6837" class="commentText"><p>This will be a will see moment. With modern medicine and sports science where it is now, its not inconceivable to see another player be great for 2 decades, obviously it&rsquo;ll depend on the player to see if they will be as great as lebron but i think we will see more players play for nearly 2 decades at a similar level to their own peaks, not lebron&rsquo;s peaks. For example, Chris Paul is a 39 year old 6 foot point guard that is still effective in running the offense, if he was 6 foot 9, im sure he would be putting up nearly lebron numbers. Both Steph Curry 36 year old point guard and Kevin Durant 35 years old, consensus top 5 offensive players in the league right now with terribly injury histories weren&rsquo;t really a thing till now. Jason Kidd in 2011 was a starting point guard for a championship team after being drafted in 1994. I think another player with a chance of longevity and similar number of winning at a team level would be Tatum, his size and his experience will age really well. So we are getting a lot more of these longevity cases, the question will be will we see a player as good as lebron was/is?</p>

      <label for="lfi3ybw" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s what I meant by they know logically, but perceptions a little different. I&rsquo;m 42. I was 21 years old when LeBron James came into the league. I watched him on TV when I was 20. I know it&rsquo;s rare, but the pace of the demise of the NBA player will still <em>seem</em> more rapid in the future. He&rsquo;s been the face of the league for more than half my life. I can&rsquo;t even know that I&rsquo;ll live another 21 years, but in that time how many players will jostle for that title? How many great players will retire in half the time that he did?</p>

What makes LeBron so different is how well he&rsquo;s responded, as well as the fact that his baseline is so fucking superhuman that it&rsquo;s almost believable that he was built in a lab. Dude is probably one of the most genetic gifted humans physically in history. That&rsquo;s a lot of fucking people he beat in the genetic lottery.</p>

<p>I think Lebron has a couple more good years in his 40s, but he&rsquo;s not exactly the first player to compete at a high level at his age. If anything, what Kareem did is arguably more impressive if you look at the kind of shoes they were playing in during the late 60s.</p>
