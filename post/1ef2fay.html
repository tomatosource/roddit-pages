      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ef2fay/lebron_james_was_already_becoming_well_known_in/"><p>LeBron James was already becoming well known in 2002. In 2024 he is still a top player in the world. How much does his longevity distort the reception of NBA players in general?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>If you were 8 years old in 2003, You have no real world perception of time, especially in terms of what time does to an athlete. For all you know, LeBron James has <em>always</em> been in the NBA.</p>

<p>Of course you learn these things as you get older, but now you&rsquo;re almost 30, you may have an 8 year old of your own, and he also becomes a fan of the NBA and LeBron James.</p>

<p>LeBron isn&rsquo;t coming off the bench to play a few minutes in a swan song season the way most players his age do. And most of the truly great players retire a couple years earlier because they don&rsquo;t want to be seen as anything less than great. They don&rsquo;t want to fade away. Either that or they are physically unable to continue playing.</p>

<p>There are parent and child duos watching LeBron James be the best player on the floor where that has been the case for as long as the parent can remember. Read that again. Has that <em>ever</em> happened for the NBA before? Does MJ count? He was no where near as effective in his wizards years, and his return, while interesting, had an &ldquo;Old Man coming back to give it one more go&rdquo; vibe. While LeBron is Old, he&rsquo;s still as effective as he&rsquo;s ever been, and voted the best player on the best team in the world.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s an entire generation of people who know logically, because people can&rsquo;t shut up about it (including myself, clearly), how rare this is. But it distorts the reality of what people are capable of and I think that will have a lasting affect on people&rsquo;s perception of NBA players for years to come.</p>

<p>What does that mean? - Nothing (but it&rsquo;s interesting though)</p>

<p>Edit: i just want to clarify that these numbers mean NOTHING, I just calulated it for fun. I considered them as independent events while calculating the probability, so please don&rsquo;t reach any conclusions from the number.</p>

<p>Edit2: I&rsquo;m stupid. It not 215 games with 27 points, it 77 it was a typo.</p>

      <label for="lfiiy9b" class="commentText"><p>To calculate the probability that LeBron James has had at least one game with a 27/7/7 stat line over his 1779 game career, we can use the principles of probability and independence.</p>

<p>First, let’s define the events:</p>

<ul>
<li>( A ): LeBron scores 27 points in a game.</li>
<li>( B ): LeBron has 7 rebounds in a game.</li>
<li>( C ): LeBron has 7 assists in a game.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the data provided:</p>

<ul>
<li>( P(A) = \frac{215}{1779} )</li>
<li>( P(B) = \frac{215}{1779} )</li>
<li>( P&copy; = \frac{209}{1779} )</li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming the events are independent, the probability that LeBron has a 27/7/7 game in any single game is:
[ P(A \cap B \cap C) = P(A) \times P(B) \times P&copy; ]</p>

<p>Let’s calculate this:
[ P(A \cap B \cap C) = \left( \frac{215}{1779} \right) \times \left( \frac{215}{1779} \right) \times \left( \frac{209}{1779} \right) ]</p>

<p>Now, to find the probability that he never had a 27/7/7 game in 1779 games, we calculate the probability of the complement event:
[ P(\text{no 27/7/7 game}) = \left( 1 - P(A \cap B \cap C) \right)^{1779} ]</p>

<p>Then, the probability that he had at least one game with a 27/7/7 stat line is:
[ P(\text{at least one 27/7/7 game}) = 1 - P(\text{no 27/7/7 game}) ]</p>

<p>Let’s calculate this step by step.</p>

<p>First, calculate ( P(A \cap B \cap C) ):
[ P(A \cap B \cap C) = \left( \frac{215}{1779} \right) \times \left( \frac{215}{1779} \right) \times \left( \frac{209}{1779} \right) \approx \left( 0.1209 \right) \times \left( 0.1209 \right) \times \left( 0.1175 \right) \approx 0.0017 ]</p>

<p>Now, calculate ( P(\text{no 27/7/7 game}) ):
[ P(\text{no 27/7/7 game}) = \left( 1 - 0.0017 \right)^{1779} \approx 0.048 ]</p>

<p>Finally, calculate ( P(\text{at least one 27/7/7 game}) ):
[ P(\text{at least one 27/7/7 game}) = 1 - 0.048 = 0.952 ]</p>

<p>Therefore, the probability that LeBron James had at least one game with a 27/7/7 stat line over his career is approximately 95.2%.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I corrected the calc using statmuse and got 85.3% probability, assuming 257 reg season or playoffs games with 7 assists, 244 games with 7 rebounds, and 95 games with 27 points</p>

He’s still top 5 to me when he’s going but that form where he’s prime Lebron can’t be on for a full game even. There’s just no way he can defend like Prime Lebron for more than a few possessions at a time and the offensive workload can even be too heavy for him most games. Its why the Lakers and him really wanted a 3rd star and even gambled on Westbrook, they both knew this day would come. They just whiffed on that trade and can’t pick-up the right pieces.</p>

<p>I think he&rsquo;d be the #1 player you&rsquo;d take for a full series.</p>

<p>For a full, long season, he&rsquo;s closer to that 9-12 range. His ability to hold up a full season + playoffs is the only thing his age has really taken from him.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s why the Lakers suddenly became the dominant force in the bubble after 3-4 months off going right into warmup + playoffs.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;ve barely been a playoff team otherwise.</p>

      <label for="lfj6pxn" class="commentText"><p>He was consensus best player in the world voted by fans,gms, players and media- In 2021 season , I see people rewriting history to only count his reign to 2020 but that’s incorrect. 2021 season he was heavy favourite for mvp , only guy in his space was embid who got injured n we are half way into a year with Lebron having -150 or something odds of mvp mb higher ut was basically locked up n that was with a bad Davis year including him being injured, his third best player being Schroeder who was a dumbass with covid n woukd miss games . He cooked the bucks dropping 35+ with no AD I think to a win . It was a lock for 5th mvp and GM voted the lakers ( pre season ) 74% to repeat which is just shy of the kd warriors repeating at like 79%. For reference Denver last year was like 30% by gms n people pretended it was a lock but it wasn’t close .</p>

<p>Then Solomon hill dived into lebrons ankle , he was never healthy rest of year, jokic won his first mvp , AD got injured again in round 1 and the lakers repeating n the actual dominance of Lebron AD duo was cut short. People were talking bout it like future Kobe shaq or AD was a better co star then Wade. Sigh. Fuck injuries n Solomon hill .</p>

      <label for="lfi25go" class="commentText"><p>LeBron distorts everything because he single-handedly obliterates the peak vs longevity argument which is huge in every sport.</p>

<p>What even is his “peak”? The fucker has like three separate primes. And his longevity is beyond insane, how many “youngest to” <em>and</em> “oldest to” records does he hold? Last season at 39 he averaged 26/7/8 on a comical 63% TS, basically better than his already ridiculous career averages. At 39.</p>

<p>I’m not gonna delve into the endless GOAT debate but Bron, at the risk of stating the obvious, sure as fuck has a lot going for him.</p>

      <label for="lfj41qy" class="commentText"><p>Reminds me of Kevin Durant’s scoring too, if you plot it on a graph.</p>

<p>People are always surprised KD as an all-time scorer doesn’t have relatively many 40, 50 point games compared to others. His career high is 55 and as far as 50+ point games in the regular season KD has 9, Harden has 23, Kobe has 25, MJ has 31, Wilt has… 118.</p>

<p>It’s because KD’s just so damn consistent, it’s a straight line where you can generally count on him for 20-30 in every game.</p>

<p>I remember years ago on this sub someone plotting it out for all-time scorers and all of them had variance that looked like peaks and dips as you might expect but KD’s was a lot closer to a straight line. Stupidly consistent.</p>

<p>Beating that Golden State team, especially from down 3-1, is probably the greatest thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen in basketball. He was utterly unstoppable. He controlled every aspect of the game and was literally the best player on the court at everything. He was the best scorer, best defender, best rebounder, best playmaker.</p>

<p>It was astounding.</p>

<p>The impression that I was left with was that LeBron, when he wants to dial it up, is just so physically dominant that no one can deal with him. He was everywhere on offense and defense. They couldn&rsquo;t keep him out of the paint on offense, and then he was in the passing lanes and blocking shots from all over the place on defense.</p>

<p>LeBron hit those two threes on Ezeli in the 4th quarter. What the hell are you supposed to do?</p>

      <label for="lfins0e" class="commentText"><p>Sucks that Love was out for the Finals and Kyrie went down at the end of Game 1.</p>

<p>As amazing as LeBron&rsquo;s accomplishments are, he has been pretty unlucky in his Finals matchups. In 2007, the Cavs were a laughable underdog and he had no business being in the Finals that young (he was good enough, just not quite great enough yet). 2011 is his only real mark against his career, no pass for his performance there. 2014, Wade was a shell of himself and Bosh was well past his prime as well. Not enough heroics to win now that Kawhi developed into an All-Star and the old-guard Spurs still doing what they do. 2015, Kyrie and Love both go down. I don&rsquo;t see the 2015 Warriors beating a healthy Cavs. 2017 and 2018 are just a blur because the 73-9 Warriors added an MVP (Durant) to their MVP (Curry) and wrote the story for the 17 and 18 seasons with a signature on Durant&rsquo;s 2-year contract.</p>

<p>The sad part to me is that many people would respect his career more if he was 4-0 (and didn&rsquo;t make the Finals in the years he lost in the Finals) instead of 4-6. I never understood that logic of using a losing Finals appearance against a player while acting like an undefeated Finals record is more impressive, with less overall appearances (not specifically commenting on the Jordan vs Lebron goat debate, just in general).</p>

      <label for="lfib0zw" class="commentText"><p>At risk of being a heretic and wading into the &ldquo;best&rdquo; v &ldquo;greatest&rdquo; argument, I think the Brady comparison actually undersells LeBron. </p>

<p>For all his longevity, Brady was always <em>one of</em> the top QBs but he only was first team all-pro 3x, compared to 7x for Manning and 4x for Rodgers.  </p>

<p>LeBron was first team all NBA 13x!!!</p>

<p>So while Brady was consistently excellent for 20+ years, more often than not other QBs were considered better than him in a given year. LeBron was pretty consistently considered the best player in the league for over a decade. You couldn&rsquo;t really say that about Brady. </p>

      <label for="lfis3ip" class="commentText"><p>That only shows how comically underrated Brady was in the regular season and how much NFL writers are obssessed with QB stats while also holding Brady to a different standard. Brady only making First Team All-Pro in the years he won MVP is one of the most laughable things about his career. Tom Brady had a season in which he lead the league in touchdown passes, had the best TD-Int ratio of any starting QB and won 12 games while throwing the ball to Danny Amendola as his primary wide receiver and didn&rsquo;t make First or Second Team All-Pro, it was ridiculous.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also a testament to how much of a choker and a unique character Peyton Manning was, if he managed to perform at 90% of his regular season self in the playoffs, he would&rsquo;ve given Brady a run for his money.</p>

      <label for="lfie9p4" class="commentText"><p>Rodgers people aren&rsquo;t saying that he&rsquo;s the goat, just the better QB in a lot of seasons. Best v greatest. Brady&rsquo;s two big GOAT claims are his Superbowls (which no one can touch), and his longevity. He was a top 5 QB for 20 years, but he wasn&rsquo;t number 1 for most of them (not a knock against him, would be insane if he was). But he was consistently number 2-5 each season, with maybe 5-6 seasons as the best QB. Brees and Rodgers definitely had better seasons/multi-season stretches than Brady in that 2007-2018 window where they were considered above him, but Brady has always had the postseason success they didnt.</p>

      <label for="lfiehs8" class="commentText"><p>Brady was not considered the best during that time. Manning won his last SB in 2015 still and set records in 2013. Brady very well may be the goat overall, but he was seen as one of the best, as opposed to the best, for most of his career. For instance individual accolades manning has 5 MVPs and Rogers with 4, compared to Brady&rsquo;s 3. Obviously Tom has more post season success, but at the same time football is much more of a team sport and less reliant on 1 individual compared to NBA.</p>

Manning was widely considered the best, but less accomplished QB for the majority of his carrer unil like 2014. A large portion of fans also thought Rodgers or Brees were better. </p>

<p>Finally after winning Super Bowl 5 he was pretty unanimously considered the GOAT, but still not necessarily best in for the current season.</p>

      <label for="lfidney" class="commentText"><p>Tom Brady was first team all-pro and MVP in 2007, 2010, and 2017&hellip;that&rsquo;s 8 seasons in your 11 year period when contemporary voters thought another QB was better.</p>

<p>In that same 11 year window, Manning won MVP and was first team all-pro 3x too, so there certainly was still an argument with Manning during this period too. Especially in 2013 when Manning broke every passing record.</p>

<p>Like I said, at least from 2007 (the first Moss year) onwards, Brady was a unanimous top 5 QB, but more often than not people were picking Manning, Rodgers, or a random guy with a hot year (Matt Ryan and Cam Newton) over him.</p>

<p>You couldn&rsquo;t really say that about Brady.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you pretty easily could, you just have to not use all-pro and all-NBA selections as a comparison.</p>

<p>In the blind which QB are you picking for first team all pro here?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>3837 yards, 60% completion percentage, 35:10 TD:int, 636 rushing yards</p></li>

<li><p>4024 yards, 68% completion percentage, 34:8 TD:int, 553 rushing yards</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Brady is neither of these players, this season he had 4770 yards, 36:7 TD:int and 65% completion percentage, while his rushing threat is non existent, he still had more yards than either of these QB&rsquo;s &ndash; one of those people won the MVP, one of them didn&rsquo;t receive an MVP vote</p>

      <label for="lficeza" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, Brady was obviously great, but if you’re being completely honest even as a Brady fan, he was never the undisputed best player in the league. He had a good argument several seasons, but even during his prime, you could make a pretty convincing argument that a guy like Aaron Rodgers was better. Lebron was pretty indisputably the best player in the league from about 2011-2017, and you could make arguments to tack on another half a dozen years to that</p>

<p>People look at his offensive numbers but fail to realize how much easier it is to score now compared to 10 years ago.</p>

<p>His defense has been laughable at best for years at this point which is understandable but so far removed from his peak.</p>

<p>If you could put 2013 LeBron in today&rsquo;s game, he is averaging a 35 point triple double on DPOY level defense. The Lakers would be obvious title favorites.</p>

<p>Instead, he is a fringe top 10 guy. Still incredible for the oldest player in the league, but disrespectful to how good he was at his peak to make the comparison.</p>

Thats just where he learned to tie it all together while still being WAY more athletic than everyone else. 2017-2018 I would say was his peak. His athleticism was still there (See Nurkic) but my god the way he just controlled the pace of every single game. He could score in any way he wanted, when he wanted and however he wanted. It was absolutely nuts. It makes me emotional watching him be the best on team USA because we all know whats coming. The end</p>

But after all that mileage, I don&rsquo;t think anyone in the world would have thought he could be in the league at all let alone still capable of so much. Remember when Skip Bayless said LeBron was fading away back when he was in his early thirties? He&rsquo;s had an entire NBA career of success since then And he&rsquo;s still going strong. Lmao</p>

Players can age gracefully because their bodies aren&rsquo;t taking as much damage from repeated punishment in the paint or heavy falls.  Along with modern physiotherapy and nutrition, 34 is still easily within your prime in the modern NBA.</p>

<p>Kawhi has a degenerative knee issue and could still easily play another 3 or 4 years with how little physical punishment his body has to take during an NBA season compared to previous eras of basketball.  Kawhi is 33.</p>

<p>I could make a very similar point about Klay.  Bro is 34 off an achilles tear AND an ACL tear and could easily play another <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> seasons in the NBA.</p>

<p>You absolutely cannot compare the longevity of today&rsquo;s players vs previous eras.</p>

      <label for="lfi9f2e" class="commentText"><p>Also consider that Kareem had to spend 4 years in college when he was clearly at worst a top 10 player in the world the day he set for on the UCLA campus. That was in 1965. In 1985 he won finals MVP, in 1986 he was first team all NBA. And he did that without much of the amazing training and medical benefits LeBron had been able to take advantage of. If Kareem had entered the league as young as LeBron was the scoring record may still require 2 more elite seasons from LeBron and all while making but a single three point bucket.</p>

      <label for="lfijn89" class="commentText"><p>Kareem is the closest guy to Lebron in this aspect, he was ahead of his time in how well he took care of his body. Lowkey Kareem is still pretty underrated because of how much everyone loves Magic, he was still the best player on most of those Showtime teams after winning a championship in the early 1970&rsquo;s. This is like if Wizards MJ was still in the running for MVP in 2002 and 2003</p>

Bootleg highlight videos were shared on P2P networks like limewire and he was sorta considered a myth. Then his high school games started airing on ESPN.</p>

<p>By the time he was drafted the Jordan level expectations were there and he somehow lived up the hype. Just unreal, and this is from someone who hasn&rsquo;t really been a fan of his after he left Cleveland in 2010.</p>

<p>i do think after he retires there&rsquo;s a chance he could be considered the GOAT by a majority of people.</p>

<p>once he&rsquo;s gone and people look back on his career and really take everything in, it might change things.</p>

      <label for="lfi8y5m" class="commentText"><p>A combination of great genetics and incredible injury luck, in a total freak of a body, and the right kind of intellect. Just a once in a lifetime combination + his hard work, it&rsquo;ll never be done again. And as an old head who watched Jordan, we can sit here picking nits about who had the higher peak, but LeBron is just unquestionably the most talented, most dominant human being who&rsquo;s ever played basketball, and now he has the greatest, most dominant career of all time. It&rsquo;ll never be done again. I can&rsquo;t imagine what his accolades would look like if he had been drafted by a competent team and he/Klutch kept their noses out of front office business. He probably has 3 more championships just by keeping his fuckin mouth shut lol</p>

I think it was DWade that got asked about this sometime, he just shrugged and said something like &ldquo;Bron just tightens his shoelaces and shrugs it off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like damn, how many NBA players are you aware of that rolls their ankles/sprains em regularly and still puts up elite numbers?</p>

      <label for="lfice0z" class="commentText"><p>you can already see him distorting how we talk and think about some of the greats a bit younger than him reaching their mid-30s &ndash; I&rsquo;m talking Steph, KD, Westbrook, Harden, Jimmy, Kawhi, PG, Klay. whereas in the past we&rsquo;d be quicker to say well they&rsquo;re 33 or 35, it&rsquo;s expected that they&rsquo;re gonna lose a step, now there&rsquo;s a different level of scrutiny and expectation of consistency.</p>

<p>KD is a prime example imho. he still is obviously able to be a mvp type guy on occasion, but has low-key not been able to be consistent in three consecutive playoffs. it was clear in this last run, he&rsquo;s lost a step. which is 100% to be expected, he&rsquo;s freakin 35 and has had a lot of injuries. in the past, this would be normal and we&rsquo;d just accept it as the new reality. bc of lebron, we&rsquo;re clinging to some kinda false hope that KD can be the same guy again throughout a playoffs run.</p>

<p>ps I know this is bad timing to make this point about KD lol but if you watched him struggle against the timberwolves this should not be controversial.</p>

<p>I was thinking about this yesterday: Lebron is so old that he used to be the spokesperson for Sprite, which was still being sold as a hydrating sports drink.</p>

Lebron deserves all the credit for how hes taken care of his body, but it doesnt mean other guys dont. lebron is just that special</p>

His rookie year is still fresh in my memory and I was a big fan back then and even more so now. My wife who recently got into basketball doesn’t understand the level of greatness it takes to be this successful for this long in a sport like basketball. This dude is an Alien lol</p>

<p>Sustained peak performance. If you think about how many years LeBron has played at an extremely high level, he really is one of one. Elite Basketball players aren’t supposed to be this good at 39. Or 35 for that matter.</p>
