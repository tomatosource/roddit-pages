1	|	<a href="/BOS"></a> Celtics	|		|	0-0	|	<a href="https://streamable.com/u4frro" target="_blank">Do the Banner 18 Boogie</a>. They did it. After years of questions if Tatum and Brown can coexist, if the Celtics had the heart to make a run in the playoffs, or if this team was a paper tiger, they did it. They ran through the playoffs and beat the Mavericks when seemingly every analyst said they shouldn&rsquo;t, for whatever stupid insane reason. New season though, you can&rsquo;t ride on the coattails of last year and just expect to cakewalk back to the finals. The East got better and Porzingis is out until at least December. While the roster is great and practically everyone is returning from last year, there are still question marks as to who can and will fill in for Porzingis while he&rsquo;s out. Horford is another year older and you don&rsquo;t want to make him play 30+ minutes a night in the regular season. Can Kornet and Tillman hold down the fort? Will the first ever Portuguese player in the NBA, Neemias Queta, make a name for himself? What rival will pick up Lonnie Walker IV for when he inevitably has his revenge game against us? For god sake will Yam Madar ever come over? No matter what, the Celtics need to hit the ground running this season and a win against the team favored to win the West would do a ton. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1d762th/rnba_poll_who_will_win_the_2024_nba_finals_the/?sort=top" target="_blank">Shoutout /r/NBA for 13k people voting, and the majority predicting the Mavs to win lmao.</a>	|
2	|	<a href="/OKC"></a> Thunder	|		|	0-0	|	I cannot tell you how excited I am for this season. Buy your OKC related futures now.	|
3	|	<a href="/NYK"></a> Knicks	|		|	0-0	|	I&rsquo;ve been spending the past couple weeks in South Florida with my grandparents for the Jewish holidays. Things are idyllic and quiet- what you&rsquo;d expect from the household of two octogenarian New Yorkers who wanted to spend their twilight years peacefully. Every so often my grandpa runs out of the house to chase away an Iguana who would mess up the garden. My grandma has a regular call with other ladies in the neighborhood to organize Bridge games. The TV rumbles on in the background, mostly glued to Fox News, sometimes a cooking channel. We have dinner between 5 and 6 in the evening, because of course we do. It&rsquo;s been nice to settle into the routine here, spending time with the people I love so much. Then nighttime rolls around, and my grandpa turns on the sports. He jumps between Yankees, Mets, Jets, Giants and Liberty games with a febrile energy, trying to consume as much as possible. He yells at the Giants coaching staff as if they were right in front of him, he whoops when Juan Soto hits an improbable rocket, and deflates when the Mets lose the series to the Dodgers. I ask him why he&rsquo;s so intense about getting all the sports, and he says it&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s never sure when he&rsquo;ll have watched his last New York game. I reflect on that and ask him what the Knicks were like in the 70s. His eyes light up. We spend the next two hours talking about his life as a fan of the Knicks. Through these stories he&rsquo;s brought back to the prime of his life, and he can&rsquo;t stop himself from sharing the smallest details of his life through being a fan: Where he was sitting in his home, watching my mom run around with her toddler sister, listening to the radio call as Willis Reed came back out the tunnel. The meaningfulness that the Knicks have to the New Yorkers is something that can only really be described in vignettes like this. I&rsquo;ve been glued to this team most of my life, and have been a ranker on this subreddit for most of a decade now. I don&rsquo;t have many positive memories of the team&rsquo;s performance, and if you bother to trawl through my old write-ups I wouldn&rsquo;t begrudge you for thinking I belonged in a rubber room. That is to say that I care deeply about the Knicks. Highs and (mostly) lows, they&rsquo;ve been the spine of my life in New York.  This is, for the first time, a season in which the expectation is contention for a championship. We&rsquo;ve lost over the past seasons many fan-favorites who&rsquo;ve helped drag us back to relevance, and gained players who might finally put us over the top. Thanks are in order to Julius Randle, RJ Barrett, Immanuel Quickley, Donte Divincenzo, Isiaiah Hartenstein and, yes, even my beloved Frank Ntilikina. Welcomes are in order for Karl Anthony Towns, Mikal Bridges and the role players who will help support the effort. For Coach Thibs, he&rsquo;s been handed the most talented roster he&rsquo;s ever had, with the most versatile defensive flexibility in the NBA. Jalen Brunson is captain of the ship and where he goes, we go. GO NY GO NY GO!	|
4	|	<a href="/DEN"></a> Nuggets	|		|	0-0	|	After a demoralizing collapse in Game 7 of last year&rsquo;s conference semifinals, the Nuggets and GM Calvin Booth seemed determined this offseason to shore up the depth of the roster and improve their maligned bench unit, which failed to provide any sort of relief during the season and led to the starters ultimately running out of gas in the playoffs. They accomplished this by replacing one veteran point guard (Reggie Jackson) with another in former MVP Russell Westbrook, as well as the signing of backup big Dario Saric. Russ will likely play a similar role to Jackson as the playmaker for the second unit, and given Westbrook&rsquo;s past, we&rsquo;ll just need to hold our breaths and see if both Russ and the coaching staff can find a fit for him after generally failed stints with his last two stops in LA. One area to keep an eye on this year will be the starting 2 guard role, as we unfortunately had to bid farewell to Kentavious Caldwell-Pope this offseason and it&rsquo;s unclear how impactful his departure will be. Christian Braun entering his 3rd season is expected to be named the starter to begin the season, as he brings a well-rounded profile of size, on-ball defense, and finishing at the rim, however he is a low volume 3PT shooter and will need to embrace shooting open 3&rsquo;s without hesitation for the Nuggets offense to run efficiently. Another candidate for the job is Julian Strawther, who is coming off a strong summer league and pre-season performance after struggling with injuries in his rookie season, but he will likely thrive as a volume scorer in the second unit.	|
5	|	<a href="/DAL"></a> Mavericks	|		|	0-0	|	Dallas&rsquo; biggest offseason loss in Derrick Jones Jr, a hyperathletic defensive mance, was quickly replaced with Naji Marshall. They also replaced Josh Green and Tim Hardaway Jr with Quentin Grimes and Klay Thompson, making Dallas&rsquo; offense about as deadly of a core as there is in the league. Derrick Lively is entering his second year, and Dallas is hopeful the duo of him and Gafford can bring them to the top ten in defense, which would be a drastic improvement from their 17th rank last year. The Mavs are hoping to bring Luka his first championship at age 26 after a disappointing Finals loss to Boston.	|
6	|	<a href="/MIN"></a> TWolves	|		|	0-0	|	After a sleepy offseason Wolves made a huge move shipping off Karl Anthony-Towns for Donte DiVincenzo and Julius Randle. Wolves hope development from Star Ant Edwards, Jaden McDaniels and Naz Reid plus shooting and bruising from DDV and Randle can get them further than their Western Conference run last season.	|
7	|	<a href="/MIL"></a> Bucks	|		|	0-0	|	Despite having minimal options, the Bucks made some shrewd moves this offseason. Gary Trent Jr is a great starting SG to land for the minimum, Taurean Prince will bring some much-needed grit and toughness on the wing, and Delon Wright should help a lot with the teams&rsquo; PoA defense. But none of that really matters, what matters is that the team&rsquo;s Big-3 stays healthy this year. In &lsquo;21 we won it all (despite some pretty bad injuries), in &lsquo;22 Khris slipped on a wet spot and we went down to the Celtics in 7, in 23&rsquo; Kevin Love broke Giannis&rsquo; back and we got embarrassed by the Heat, last year all three of Khris (hobbled), Dame (hobbled &amp; missed games) and Giannis (couldn&rsquo;t play at all) were hurt going into the playoffs. The good news is that Giannis and Dame both come into this season looking healthier than they did last year, but it was just announced today that Khris would miss the season opener as he has not yet fully recovered from double-ankle-surgery this offseason.	|
8	|	<a href="/PHI"></a> 76ers	|		|	0-0	|	The Sixers are already in midseason form (everyone is hurt). There is a lot of optimism around this team with the addition of Paul George, the re-signing of Kelly Oubre, and the addition of depth pieces like Caleb Martin, Andre Drummond, and Eric Gordon. The question was always going to be the health, and it seems like that answer has already started coming in. With this being the final push the Sixers could be able to make in the Embiid era, will the Big 3 be able to hold it together? Maxey may need to take another large step forward for that to be the case. Something to watch throughout the year: How is the Sixers&rsquo; rebounding? 	|
9	|	<a href="/PHX"></a> Suns	|		|	0-0	|		|
10	|	<a href="/CLE"></a> Cavaliers	|		|	0-0	|	The Cavs spent the offseason securing 4 more years of this core, with new contracts for Mobley, Mitchell, Allen and Okoro. Koby Altman has bet his job on this path: running the roster back with a new system installed by coach Kenny Atkinson, who is promising increased pace. The main ingredients for success this year are simple: Evan Mobley must progress his game with his promised (large) increase in usage, and Darius Garland must return to pre-jaw injury form. The Cavs also expect Dean Wade to step up and become a main rotation piece, potentially starting the season as the starting SF with Strus out 6 weeks. Wade is an absurdly underrated defender, and since acquiring Donovan Mitchell, the Cavs are 66-32 in games where Dean Wade plays, and 33-33 without him. Year-after-year, the Cavs rebound and defend much better with Wade on the court, so a main focus going in to the season for Atkinson is encouraging Wade to let it fly from 3 this year, as he’s been at the bottom of the league in terms of usage rate. The main addition to the roster is the Cavs 2024 first round pick, Jaylon Tyson, who was very much a “need based” pick as the Cavs still attempt to find the correct wings to slot in with the core 4. Tyson looked amazing in the summer league (15/7/4 on 58/40/91 shooting ) and had a decent preseason. Tyson plays with a grit/grind mentality and is advertised as a rebounding hoss, who frustrates offensive players with his defensive intensity. He will join LeVert and Okoro as the main guys in the SG/SF role. 	|
11	|	<a href="/IND"></a> Pacers	|		|	0-0	|	The Pacers&rsquo; success this season will be based on one thing: growth. Will Tyrese Haliburton be able to string a full season of All-NBA level play together following a tough finish to last year? Will Bennedict Mathurin return from injury and take a step forward defensively? Will Jarace Walker morph into the defensive combo forward he was drafted to be? And what does the overall team defense look like with a full year of Pascal Siakam? If all of these questions have positive outcomes, Indiana likely takes another step forward towards the upper tiers of the Eastern Conference.	|
12	|	<a href="/ORL"></a> Magic	|		|	0-0	|	A new season begins. Max contract for Franz Wagner, can he live up to the expectations? Not quite a max rookie extension but an extension nonetheless for Jalen Suggs, who broke out last year shooting nearly 40% from 3PT and getting a All-NBA Defensive Second Team nod. Signing KCP should boost our 3PT shooting in the starting lineup and keep our defense as strong as ever. Paolo Banchero hopes to continue growing his game and could this be the year he adds All-NBA to his resume? WCJ rounds out the starting lineup, with fans hoping he can at least stay healthy throughout the season and spread the floor like he&rsquo;s shown in previous seasons. The bench includes the usual suspects in Cole Anthony, Moe Wagner and Jonathan Isaac with larger contributions expected to come from second year players Anthony Black and Jett Howard, as well as newly drafted Tristan da Silva. Jamahl Mosley had his name thrown around in COTY conversations last season and I&rsquo;m willing to bet it&rsquo;ll be the same this season. Expectations for the Magic as a whole are as high as they&rsquo;ve been in well over a decade. Can this team show that last year wasn&rsquo;t just a fluke and make some real noise in the playoffs?	|
13	|	<a href="/MEM"></a> Grizzlies	|		|	0-0	|	It&rsquo;s a new season, and you know what that means!! Injuries!! GG Jackson is out until the new year, JJJ injured, and Ja tweaking his ankle early in the preseason, its beginning to feel like we&rsquo;re a cursed franchise. However Edey looked great, and if the team can get to a healthy position we should be primed to crank out a lot of regular season wins.	|
14	|	<a href="/SAC"></a> Kings	|		|	0-0	|	Welcome to SZN 3 of Light The Beam I&rsquo;ll be your Host for another either amazing szn or sad pathetic injury plagued year. Im sorry but we will not be offering anything in between. Let&rsquo;s get started.. we&rsquo;re heading into a new year with some actual changes to the lineup virtually bringing back everything good minus Barnes and replacing him with Demar 4th Quarter Derozan. The Kings are still severely undersized and probably won&rsquo;t be able to improve on this until mid SZN. They have improved their ability to score outside of Fox and threes by adding the middy god Demar but will it be enough? You&rsquo;ll find out on the next episode of Dragon Ball Kangz 	|
15	|	<a href="/NOP"></a> Pelicans	|		|	0-0	|	I lie awake at night wondering who will play the 5. 6&rsquo;8&rdquo; journeyman Daniel Thies is penciled in as the starter. Rumors are First Team All-Defensive perimeter man Herb Jones will see significant minutes there as well, for the first time in his career. First round pick Yves Missi is incredibly raw and likely won&rsquo;t get much run under Willie Green. Small ball sounds fun in theory, but also tough to implement with Trey Murphy out to start the season and CJ McCollum quickly getting longer and longer in the tooth. The plan is for Dejounte Murray to return to his PG form when he was in San Antonio and relieve CJ of that pressure. Brandon Ingram had a strong camp with an emphasis on him shooting more threes, though he still could be moved before the trade deadline. Second year player Jordan Hawkins looks to make a big leap towards becoming a top three point threat. Hopefully the elephant in the room that is Zion&rsquo;s health can finally be answered such that the question of who&rsquo;s playing center remains the biggest hurdle. 	|
16	|	<a href="/MIA"></a> Heat	|		|	0-0	|	This may be a difficult season for the Heat considering the lack of off-season reinforcements. The core is still there and arguably improving but the question will be how the core will be supported. Jimmy Butler isn&rsquo;t getting younger and we will really need the likes of Jaquez Jr and Herro to take the next steps. We&rsquo;ll probably perform in line with how we did last season and that&rsquo;ll be alright. Hopefully however that the injuries are limited and everyone&rsquo;s healthy.	|
17	|	<a href="/LAL"></a> Lakers	|		|	0-0	|	Bringing back pretty much the same team where Knecht replaces Prince in the rotation, with the only move in Free Agency being the hire of JJ Redick doesn&rsquo;t seem to move the needle for their ceiling. But Ham getting sandwiched is a massive addition by subtraction in itself. The biggest void is the lack of a competent backup big and pure two-way guys (Christie?), here&rsquo;s to shamelessly hoping Pelinka would pull off something by the trade deadline after a dormant off-season. 	|
18	|	<a href="/GSW"></a> Warriors	|		|	0-0	|	After over a decade the splash bros   have split. Klay will forever be a Warriors legend and has been an integral part of the dynasty from Game 6 Klay, signing Toasters, becoming the &ldquo;when you do nothing on a group project and still get an A&rdquo; meme, dropping 37 points in a quarter, 4 championships and countless memories over the years. It will be  Hakeem on Toronto weird watching him on Dallas but can&rsquo;t help to wish him the best. On the basketball side it was time for both Klay and the Warriors to turn the page. While on paper they did not make a huge splash the Warriors bolstered their bench significantly with Hield and Melton falling into the Klay role. After extending Moody to a significant contract we can only hope he also sees more playtime. |
19	|	<a href="/HOU"></a> Rockets	|		|	0-0	|	This really has to be the season the team gets to the playoffs again, right? For stretches last year, it looked like this team was very much playoff capable. The team isn&rsquo;t much different this year, but Steven Adams will add some much needed size to the second rotation, and Reed Sheppard has a skill set that should be relatively quick to implement. It&rsquo;s really make or&hellip; okay nothing bad happens otherwise, but it&rsquo;s a realistic aim to make it this year.	|
20	|	<a href="/SAS"></a> Spurs	|		|	0-0	|	We are so fucking back. It was a pretty fun summer for Spurs fans, Wemby ended his rookie season on a high note and then followed it up with some more fireworks in the Olympics a few months later. In between, the Spurs picked up the 4th and 8th picks in the lotto, drafted Stephon Castle from UConn and sacrificed the 8th pick to the altar of future draft picks (to the chagrin of some Spurs fans), and picked up CP3 (also to the chagrin of some Spurs fans) and Harrison Barnes in a shrewd move to collect even <em>more</em> future picks and further bolster the veteran leadership on a roster that was the youngest in the league last year. I must confess that, as excited as I am to see Wemby&rsquo;s growth, Castle&rsquo;s rookie season, Keldon &ldquo;0% Body Fat&rdquo; Johnson and more, I do think we&rsquo;re still probably a year away from 40+ wins and a play-in spot. Don&rsquo;t get it twisted, I&rsquo;d love for the team to prove me wrong, but the West is still trying real hard to win and the last time we were in the play-in, 35 wins was enough (<strong>11</strong> wins less than it took to make the play-in last year). How I plan on taking in the season is enjoying the ride and letting the wins come as they may; the time for putting pressure on winning can come, but for now, let&rsquo;s enjoy the process and not skip any steps. The Spurs open the season @DAL, HOU, HOU, @OKC, @UTA, MIN.	|
21	|	<a href="/ATL"></a> Hawks	|		|	0-0	|	After two seasons, the front office officially severed the Trae and Dejounte pairing by trading Dejounte to the Pelicans. While the initial reaction many had to the trade was that the Hawks would take a step back this season, I&rsquo;m not so sure about that. I honestly think that the trade might result in some addition by subtraction. That&rsquo;s not because Dejounte is a bad player, it&rsquo;s because <a href="https://youtu.be/YmRiU-9pOgY?si=S_yZyTPDAMzsCykG&amp;t=998" target="_blank">the Trae/Dejounte pairing was the worst all-star pairing since 2000</a>, and <a href="https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612737&amp;Season=2023-24,2022-23&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=1627749,1629027" target="_blank">both Trae and Dejounte were better without the other on the court</a>. Only having Trae makes it much easier to build functioning lineups on both offense and defense around him. Trae is still a great player (and tbh is in contention for the most underrated player in the league), but for the past two seasons he had a roster around him that wasn&rsquo;t built to maximize his talents. For the first time since the ECF run, this roster feels like it was built with Trae fully in mind. Zaccharie Risacher has already shown off why he was the first overall pick and looks like an amazing fit with his defense, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sAimwUT6sEU" target="_blank">passing</a>, and off-ball movement. Dyson Daniels gives the Hawks their best PoA defender since the 2015 60-win team, which he&rsquo;s shown off <a href="https://x.com/Preet410_/status/1845997278105911785?t=RynYUESzedOvCeiBGL10Sw&amp;s=19" target="_blank">multiple</a> <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/1g4h76s/dyson_is_always_organizing_the_weak_side_he_sees/" target="_blank">times</a> <a href="https://x.com/KLChouinard/status/1846711908344184890" target="_blank">over</a> <a href="https://x.com/KLChouinard/status/1846804218687914019" target="_blank">the</a> <a href="https://x.com/KLChouinard/status/1847142921343992114" target="_blank">preseason</a>. Larry Nance gives the Hawks the best option for a 5-out center they&rsquo;ve had in the Trae era, and alongside Capela and Okongwu gives the team a very solid center rotation even if one of them misses a stretch of games. Then you have the returning guys. After <del>getting robbed of 6MOTY</del> a great run with Serbia at the Olympics, Bogdan Bogdanovic comes back and provides elite shooting alongside playmaking and creation off the bench. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VDJLL84ZJ1E" target="_blank">Vit Krejci is the best minimum player you&rsquo;ve never heard of, and his contract is an absolute robbery</a>. Clint Capela, while not at the peak he was at during the ECF run, can still provide solid rim protection and should have less on his plate with Dyson, Zacch, and Vit on the perimeter. De&rsquo;Andre Hunter is a basketball player. Kobe Bufkin showed flashes on defense last season as well as a lead guard this preseason, so he&rsquo;ll be helpful navigating the non-Trae minutes. Onyeka Okonwu has been an amazing partner with Jalen Johnson, and should feature prominently in the rotation (when he&rsquo;s healthy). And lastly, we have Jalen Johnson. If you don&rsquo;t know who he is yet, you&rsquo;re going to learn soon. After a season where he would&rsquo;ve won MIP if he met the games requirement, Jalen looks primed to take the league by storm. His unique combination of athleticism, rebounding, creation, and passing makes him a very important piece of the Hawks&rsquo; future. He shot 35.5% from 3 last season, and if he&rsquo;s able to hold onto that or improve it (he shot <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> from 3 this preseason), then there&rsquo;s a real chance that Jalen could be an all-star this season. Compared to last season when 5 of the top 9 rotation players were negatives on defense (Trae/Dejounte/Bogi/Garrison Mathews/Bey), only 2 of the top 9 projected rotation players are weak on that end. It&rsquo;s going to be a lot easier to put together competent lineups around Trae that can work on both ends of the court. On top of that, I need to give a shout-out to Landry Fields because the work he&rsquo;s done in improving the back half of the roster from when he took over to now is absolutely astounding. Garrison Mathews, David Roddy, Dominick Barlow, Seth Lundy, Keaton Wallace, and Mo Gueye are good enough to survive their minutes if there&rsquo;s an injury above them in the rotation, and I couldn&rsquo;t say that confidently before this season. Do I have concerns? Yes. The team has to find a solid answer to what happens when Trae is off the court, when historically the offense has fallen off a cliff. Based off of the preseason and reports from camp, it looks like that responsibility will fall to a combination of Vit and Kobe, but we&rsquo;ll need to see how that looks in actual games. Also, this team is surprisingly young (fully healthy, Trae is likely our oldest starter). Growning pains and mistakes are likely to happen, and there&rsquo;s a chance that I might be jumping the gun on being high on this team by a year or so. But given the track record Trae has shown, the potential Jalen has flashed, and the infrastructure around them, I feel cautiously confident that this team will be a playoff team this season	|
22	|	<a href="/LAC"></a> Clippers	|		|	0-0	|	The Clippers enter the 24-25 season with a new stadium, new jerseys, one less star player, and another one out to start the year. While this isn&rsquo;t the ideal situation for Inglewood&rsquo;s newest residents, they still hope to remain competitive this season in the hopes that Kawhi Leonard does in fact play basketball this season. The few bright spots of this team going in to the year include a potential increased role of Ivica Zubac; after already averaging a career high in points last year, he will start the season in a more refined role and should be getting a lot more looks in a Harden-led offense. New additions such as Derrick Jones Jr. and Kris Dunn suggests that this team will embrace a more defensive identity this season, and Nic Batum was brought back for corner threes and vibes. Biggest questions surrounding this team (asides from Kawhi&rsquo;s knees) is can a 35 year old James Harden consistently steady the ship throughout the regular season, and if anyone else on this team besides our 2 aging stars and Norman Powell can create a shot for themselves. Overall, the Clippers&rsquo; championship window is all but closed at this point, but expect them to fight for a play-in spot because at this point it is their only option.	|
23	|	<a href="/CHI"></a> Bulls	|		|	0-0	|		|
24	|	<a href="/TOR"></a> Raptors	|		|	0-0	|	The team didn&rsquo;t get a win in their division until January last season. Let&rsquo;s hope that changes this season and comes a lot sooner. The early record is really tough. REALLY tough. Their first 20 games out of 25 are all playoff teams from the prior season. However, any schedule looks tough if it&rsquo;s a bad team. 	|
25	|	<a href="/UTA"></a> Jazz	|		|	0-0	|	Very weird time to be a Jazz fan. We want to tank, but end up too good to tank and half-heartedly sell at deadline. It seemed to work better last year, winning just 5 games post All Star Break, with two of them coming in the last week of the season. This season is a wild card, but is definitely a make or break season in terms of direction for this team. Do we buck up and commit to a full tank to land a top pick in a loaded draft, or end up with the 10th pick again? In Danny we trust&hellip;?	|
26	|	<a href="/CHA"></a> Hornets	|		|	0-0	|	The Buzz is back, with an all new front office, owner, and coach. I&rsquo;m extremely excited on two time champ Charles Lee, his defensive intensity, and the youth movement both in the court and front office. Jeff Peterson, young GM, made some moves this summer to get assets and use our cap space. The team is not without talent. LaMelo for my money is every bit the exciting dynamo that Haliburton and Young are in the East, when he plays that is. Good defense in preseason which makes me hopeful. Miller is just a stud, a sharp shooting wing with no shyness on both ends. Miles Bridges is a POS but crucial to the team as the only source of rim pressure. Mark Williams is going to swing the season, missing almost the entire year with a back injury last year and now a foot tendon. Neither sound good in a 7&rsquo;1&rdquo; big, and if he doesn&rsquo;t we get killed on the glass with guys like Grant Williams getting legit center minutes. Tre Mann is my favorite bench combo in the league, he&rsquo;s going to surprise people this year, and I like what Cody and Salaun will bring in energy off the bench. Unfortunately just way too many question marks around health for me to predict anything more than 34-48, though this team has real talent.	|
27	|	<a href="/DET"></a> Pistons	|		|	0-0	|	Congratulations to Monty Williams who is the new coach of TMI Episcopal prep school in San Antonio. Thanks for the worst NBA coaching job In my 30-something years of life. We appreciate you for playing Killian Hayes (who was recently cut by the Nets) over Jaden Ivey. Congratulations to Troy Weaver for finding a Senior Advisory role with the Wizards. Enjoy being reunited with Marvin Bagley and Saddiq Bey. Congratulations to James Edwards III for finding a job as Knicks beat writer. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be as humble in that role as you were on the Pistons beat. Congratulations to James Wiseman on signing with the Pacers. I hope Myles Turner lets you play with his Legos on their bench. Anyways, I&rsquo;m not sure how the franchise will recover from such monumental losses. Then again, new PoBO Trajan Langdon did acquire Tim Hardaway Jr this offseason&hellip; He&rsquo;s sure to elevate the play of guys like prodigal son Tobias Harris, Cade, Jaden Ivey, Jalen Duren, and rookie Ron Holland. Oh and Ausar&rsquo;s still out with blood clots&hellip; nobody really knows what&rsquo;s going on there. Maybe THJ can heal Ausar too.	|
28	|	<a href="/POR"></a> Trail Blazers	|		|	0-0	|		|
29	|	<a href="/BKN"></a> Nets	|		|	0-0	|	The tank is on for the first time in over a decade as the Nets already have their sights set on the college landscape. Pundits have dubbed this a very strong draft so it&rsquo;s going to be in the hands of draft luck to see how the Nets rebuild will kick off. In the meantime, Nets fans will keep an eye on young players to see who is a part of the future of this franchise - Cam Thomas is an obvious candidate to step up but young guys like Noah Clowney and Jalen Wilson have impressed in limited time. 	|
30	|	<a href="/WAS"></a> Wizards	|		|	0-0	|	This is bad. This is &ldquo;having the runs on the first date&rdquo; bad. This is &ldquo;having the runs on the first date, you made it back to her place and she doesn&rsquo;t have toilet paper&rdquo; bad. This is &ldquo;I might have also clogged the toilet&rdquo; bad.  There is no hope for this year. Brian Keefe has yet to show he has an understanding of how to develop the half-court offense. And with the lack of depth in the point guard position along with a slew of developmental prospects, the Wizards really may be generationally bad this season. The worst part is that it won&rsquo;t speak to the actual skill level of the players like Alex Sarr, Bub Carrington and Bilal Coulibaly. It just speaks to a front office that has spent back-to-back drafts on talent that will need team &ndash; which Kyshawn George being a breath of fresh air as a &ldquo;NBA ready&rdquo; guy. The goals for the season will be to get them up to speed, trade everyone else and hope Boston isn&rsquo;t the one to get Corey Kispert.	|</p>

      <label for="lt7vrcx" class="commentText"><p>Lol too true. I saw this article awhile back talking about all the factors as to why the western conference is always stronger than the east.</p>

<p>One of the big factors for why this trend has been maintained for so long is that bad teams in the west get beat up by all the other west teams and end with really bad records which translates to high picks. Half of the teams in the east are as bad as the worst teams in the west, but still win a bunch of games because they play so many east games</p>

      <label for="lt7m3fz" class="commentText"><p>Wild to me.  They lost Derozan and Caruso.  Their starting lineup is worse than I&rsquo;d say 27 or 28 other teams(Nets+Wizards).  They&rsquo;ve got like 3 guys on the team that are plus defenders and one of those guys didn&rsquo;t play basketball for 3 years, while another is massively injury prone.</p>

<p>Giddey, White, Lavine, Patrick Williams, Vucevic</p>

<p>Stick that team in the west and the Blazers would actually have some real tanking competition</p>

      <label for="lt7nt46" class="commentText"><p>May we all come to the light of Dean Wade’s defense.</p>

<p>One of the best wing stoppers in the league if going by D-LeBron. Lowest fg% against at the rim on a team with Mobley/Allen. Elite defensive plus/minus. His opponent shot well lower than average on all 3 levels of the court with Wade as a main defender.</p>

<p>If he starts piling his 3pa up and can keep around his 39% from last year, he’ll be an incredibly important part of our rotation</p>
