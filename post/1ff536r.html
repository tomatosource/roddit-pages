      <label for="lms3by5" class="commentText"><p>No one. He will be an RFA next year meaning they can match any contract offer. If he &ldquo;earns&rdquo; a max based on this year, they can just offer/match it.</p>

<p>Only risks are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Making player upset</p></li>

<li><p>JK has the option of accepting a qualifying offer then become an UFA. Most will never do this as he&rsquo;d be giving up 30-40 million plus security of a long term deal to do this.</p></li>

      <label for="lmsdq9k" class="commentText"><p>There’s a little more risk regarding the offer sheet if he does play well.</p>

<p>Offer sheets can only be for four years, and the final year can be a player option. So if he does earn a max he can use the offer sheet to make it essentially a 3 year deal and hit UFA as a 25-year-old with the cap set to be way higher by then.</p>

<p>But if they just give him the max extension they can lock him up at the 2025 max for four or five years (depending on if they do it this year or next off-season).</p>

<p>This is basically what happened to Utah with Gordon Hayward - they could have locked him up through 2019 for what would have been a big discount by the end of the deal, but because they played the RFA game to try and save a buck they lost him for nothing as a UFA in 2017.</p>

<p>The fact we gave that contract and managed to get off of it relatively easily was pretty mindblowing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean it makes sense if you consider he was traded for someone who was immediately waived haha. Nicholson was on the Blazers payroll up until last year without playing a single minute for you guys, which is crazy to think about</p>

<p>Crabbe was really overpaid, but he was still an okay role player, his biggest fault was that he was constantly injured</p>

<p>But also, if the player does perform like a star, that 5th year is locked in, much cheaper. Wagner is projected to make 22.5% of the cap in 2029-30, which is 51.0m. Whereas a second max contract would start at 67.9m. Plus, they’re an unrestricted free agent at that point. They could just be gone from your team.</p>

<p>With Kawhi Leonard, the Spurs waited him out. Didn’t extend him in the off-season. Then they offered a 5-year max anyway, for this purpose.</p>

That was the case last year too, even in a Klay down year. Among all players, Steph was 1st and Klay was 2nd in off gravity (bball-index’s metric that measures the amount of resources a team’s defense dedicates to guarding a player when they don’t have the ball). Klay also led all off ball players last year in overall gravity (on ball and off ball gravity combined). So no, there are literally no other two players that Kuminga could get the same spacing from, let alone better.</p>

You can have a non-shooter, it depends on the pieces. My point was that of course his TS is going to drop with worse shooters around him than Steph and Klay.</p>

<p>Everyone is talking like wherever he ends up is going to be like the 2024 Detroit pistons who didn’t have any shooters. Almost no team is constructed like that anymore.</p>

      <label for="lmsqa5h" class="commentText"><p>Just having shooters, any shooters, around JK isn’t enough though is my point. His handle is way too loose (and his off season workout videos this summer have shown nothing to suggest it’s gotten markedly tighter) and he doesn’t have any counters and so unless he gets a wide open runway, all a defense needs to do is send a soft double to him and he either throws up a shot that has no chance of going in or he commits a turnover. We saw it happen over and over again the second half of last season once he was playing enough that the defense started scouting him. The only players he’ll likely get a wide enough runway with to be able to operate enough to get anywhere close to 20 pts are Steph and Klay.</p>

<p>And this is all ignoring the other end of the floor, which he has zero interest in playing.</p>

<p>Jokic on his Supermax is a huge value contract for Denver. He’d be getting a lot more of it weren’t for the artificial limit to his earning capacity.</p>

<p>It’s actually rather fun to play with this cap setup on BBGM. You can have a perennial MVP candidate or winner but have to trade him or let him walk because his contract demand is 80% of your cap and you simply can’t build a team good enough around him to actually win.</p>

<p>Basically, I&rsquo;m asking if it&rsquo;s &ldquo;better&rdquo; for the league that LeBron makes his rightful 80m a year or whatever but he has to do it for the Wizards with rookie contracts and second round picks as opposed to being able to see them team up and have those competitive series in the playoffs that bring popularity?</p>

      <label for="lmss0bw" class="commentText"><p>Baseball is a bit different as there’s not a real cap, owners can spend basically as much as they want on their roster (with various tax levels obviously as you spend more).  For the Angels it’s not as much Trout’s contract as it is their owner’s budget, rightfully or wrongfully. Baseball and basketball are also on total opposite ends of the spectrum of a single player’s impact, adding an MVP candidate to a bad baseball team doesn’t change that much but adding that to an NBA team is a massive jump in team performance.</p>

<p>The NFL is a better example. And you do have teams who are limited by bad contracts they sign. But in your example, LeBron getting <span class="math inline">\(80M to lead a shit team means that \)</span>80M is an <em>overpay</em> and LeBron actually isn’t worth that much. He’d get paid exactly as much as a team can possibly give him while also feeling they can build around him.</p>

<p>However, in this environment, all the star power would be spread a lot more evenly so it is entirely possible LeBron and rookies/minimums can be competitive, because it’d likely be rare for multiple all stars to ever be on the same team. Super teams would never exist because it’d require even just two guys to take a pretty significant pay cut to play with each other.</p>

<p>Each team would basically have one star level guy and try to build around him as best as possible. Would it be easier for the Bucks to build around Giannis taking 70% of the cap or the Hornets to build around Lamelo taking 50% of the cap? I really don’t know, it’d be super interesting to see. The parity would be really high.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s unclear to me is the value that having a Lebron, a Giannis, a Jokic, an Embiid, etc. has on the city, arena, surrounding property, ticket sales, advertising deals, or whatever else they bring to the table. All of the &ldquo;non-basketball&rdquo; stuff. The basketball focused teams are going to have a competitive cap they are willing to spend on these players. But I would hypothesize that the cap for a team who is looking at these other influence streams would have a higher number they&rsquo;d be willing to spend to bring a player like that in.</p>

<p>Just for a bit of additional context&hellip; the Angels&rsquo; problems really haven&rsquo;t been a cheap owner. Using Spotrac, going back to their earliest data in 2011, only this year and 2020 (a famously normal season) have seen the Angels spending outside of the top 10 in the league. And even this season, they are closer to a top 10 payroll than a bottom 10 one. But outside of great investments in Trout and Ohtani (no longer in Anaheim) during the past decade, they have not spent money efficiently. Sometimes it has been signing past-prime players to big deals. Sometimes it has been signing injury risks and then seeing those injuries crop up. Sometimes it has been signing older, injury-prone players to big deals and really upping the ante.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of comparable to the Knicks when Dolan was much more hands-on. They spent, but they didn&rsquo;t spend well. The issue is that whereas Dolan eventually figured out that leaving the team to smarter basketball minds than his own could bring success&hellip; the Angels owner talked about selling, then pulled the team off the market, and just signed his head of baseball operations to an extension when everyone assumed that guy would be fired.</p>

      <label for="lms9urk" class="commentText"><p>My issue with the supermax is that it shouldnt be structured the way it is. Everything above the max that a player makes due toa  supermax contract shouldnt be considered as a part of their teams salary cap.</p>

<p>And also players demanding the max like that feels dumb as well. A team should really only have 1 actual max contract. 2 at most and that shiuld be the limit.</p>

<p>I know it makes it hard to keep stars on teams, but its the reasons teams cant keep roleplayers.</p>

<p>Similarly roleplayers are getting overpayed way too much nowadays.</p>

      <label for="lmsbq3k" class="commentText"><p>Some pretty good ideas here. I’d be willing to go even further.</p>

<p>Players getting the Supermax extension can get 10% bumps, but if they are traded, they have to give back the extra 5% and the team is penalized by losing the salary cap discount for the rest of the contract. Players would get a no-trade clause automatically.</p>

<p>If the reason for the Supermax is to allow teams to keep their homegrown players, they should be disincentivized from trading him. And if the player accepts more money than they are normally eligible for, then they should also be penalized.</p>

<p>I don’t think there should be a limit to the number of max deals you can sign. If teams want to be foolish and overspend, they can certainly do so. Smart teams will find value where the dumb ones do not.</p>

      <label for="lmtcagt" class="commentText"><p>This is one line of thought and yes, there’s more money available for all of the other players. However, with all of the other rules and such, we’ve seen it play out where decent players in the middle of their careers are having to take paycuts on prove it contracts. Top tiers guys are getting their max deals. Then the young players are getting their max deals since teams are valuing them against their potential.</p>

<p>Guys like Oubre have virtually zero market. Caleb Martin found out that he ha KD not market either outside of the Heat’s extension offer.</p>

<p>The truth is that there are so many moving parts that it’s hard to know what the different entities want or don’t want.</p>

      <label for="lmsnwli" class="commentText"><p>I think the Poole comment is more that he’s in the same situation that Poole was prior to his “breakout” season. Not a spot for him to truly get a solid run on the court each game, no chance of starting due to the tenure and ability of the players ahead of him, and not enough in the game plan on a regular basis to have a chance to break out.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It has nothing to do with tenure and more to do with the fact that he&rsquo;s a 3 that can&rsquo;t shoot. So if you play him at the 4, you&rsquo;re giving up rim protection and rebounding cuz he falls asleep on the boards too. It&rsquo;s not easy to find him minutes without destroying our spacing.</p>

<p>By the time a rookie deal is over for a pick that high, there should be a clear picture of what he looks like on the team filling a large role.</p>

<p>I agree he’s probably not max material but the warriors have also probably screwed his development. Who knows what he would be right now had he gotten more of a chance to develop. He’s a very high potential player.</p>

<p>I think in a few years there will be a lot more talk of how Kerr ended the dynasty by refusing to develop young players and riding with Klay and Dray for too long, most of the warriors’ problems the past two years were because of those two</p>

      <label for="lms3rq3" class="commentText"><p>The Nets actually have a pretty good front office.  The Celtics trade was before Marks was in charge, and he clawed that team out of that hole pretty well.</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t really blame the Durant era ending the way it did on the FO either.  Basically every GM in that situation would take Durant and Kyrie.  The big mistake was choosing Jordan over Allen and Atkinson, but even then, they were a powerhouse at their peak and sometimes you gotta give in to pressure from a talent like Durant.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re handling the rebuild/teardown pretty well right now, just gotta see what they turn all that stuff into.</p>

I also would understand if JKs frustrated because he’s been given inconsistent playing time. Did he deserve more minutes?

<p>I’m not sure what you do in JK’s shoes though. It’s pretty clear that Kerr views him as a role player-cutter next to Curry &amp; Green, while JK’d recognizes his all-nba talent. </p>

<p>I think he’ll be the first player in a while to take the RFA offer and request a trade. </p>

      <label for="lmszyyw" class="commentText"><p>Just out of curiosity, if it were financially possible (don&rsquo;t think it is), would you be willing to move off of AG to get Kuminga?</p>

<p>I was trying to think of what is a theoretical best case scenario for Kuminga in terms of a player who was a non-shot creation so-so shooting athletic 4 that was able to make an impact on winning, and AG came to my mind.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s a potential free agent this year unless you sign him to an extension as he&rsquo;s obviously not picking up that player option.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s an interesting conversation to be had about whether you would rather pay a proven AG for his age 29-32 seasons as opposed to paying an unproven Kuminga for his age 23-27 seasons. And when I say proven, I&rsquo;m talking about the most important thing when it comes to making decisions for Denver, which is, do you fit with Jokic.</p>

<p>But in theory, you can see a world where Kuminga can somewhat replicate that Gordon role as an off-ball cutter with more ISO scoring ability.</p>

      <label for="lmt1k4l" class="commentText"><p>You know i never thought about it much.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But in theory, you can see a world where Kuminga can somewhat replicate that Gordon role as an off-ball cutter with more ISO scoring ability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What you say makes sense tbh. Kuminga is only slightly smaller than AG, though could fit that role.</p>

<p>He isnt quite the defender AG is, but has the tools to become that good.</p>

<p>And on offense, he is more versatile.</p>

<p>By all right i do think Kuminga would fit the Nuggets offense more than the Warriors offense if he was put in AGs position.</p>

<p>And our FO is crazy enough to try and get him, though i dont think they could quite pay him anything more than the Warriors could, if even as much.</p>

<p>But an intresting thought experiment.</p>

      <label for="lmshjra" class="commentText"><p>Ideally you’re paying for the hopes that Kuminga could potentially be an all-star one day, and while he’s an insane athlete, I don’t think he’s proven he has star potential just yet. If he balls out at the beginning of the season though, I bet they’ll offer him the max. But I get why the Warriors want to remain flexible. Curry still believes he can win another chip there, and he certainly dictates the purse strings. I can imagine the FO consults him &amp; Kerr on those sort of things.</p>

<p>Kuminga still looks lost on the court at times and his J isn’t reliable.   In GS system, he should be able to eat in the mid-range, if Hield plays ok-ish.</p>
