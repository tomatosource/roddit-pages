      <label for="lmsnfrg" class="commentText"><p>And what do they have to lose? In the NBA, you have to tank until you get a foundational superstar to build on or a bunch of stars decide they want to go to your team.</p>

<p>In the first situation, if he sucks, it helps tank and keep getting high picks. If he doesn’t suck, you get him as a valuable piece to build around or trade him out for more bites at the Apple.</p>

<p>Second situation, you most likely need to trade for one of these incoming stars that will be on a big contract. You need SOMEONE on a decently large sized deal that isn’t a complete bust. Kuminga is that.</p>

<p>So either way, I think it would make a ton of sense for Brooklyn to throw a deal at him. And if GSW decides to match? Then okay, they might’ve hamstrung their team to stop you from getting him.</p>

<p>Sure if he’s able to turn his biggest weakness, lack of shooting, into a skill, he’s an entirely different player and nobody is even having this conversation. The issue is his shooting hasn’t improved at all in his time in the league, and he’s been a sub 70% ft shooter for his career. There’s no reason to believe he’ll make meaningful strides in that area, which significantly reduces his impact and flexibility in roster construction.</p>

<p>He’s an intriguing player because he’s on an under market contract. At a max or near max deal, he’s worse than Brandon Ingram.</p>

<p>Only risks are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Making player upset</p></li>

<li><p>JK has the option of accepting a qualifying offer then become an UFA. Most will never do this as he&rsquo;d be giving up 30-40 million plus security of a long term deal to do this.</p></li>

      <label for="lmsdq9k" class="commentText"><p>There’s a little more risk regarding the offer sheet if he does play well.</p>

<p>Offer sheets can only be for four years, and the final year can be a player option. So if he does earn a max he can use the offer sheet to make it essentially a 3 year deal and hit UFA as a 25-year-old with the cap set to be way higher by then.</p>

<p>But if they just give him the max extension they can lock him up at the 2025 max for four or five years (depending on if they do it this year or next off-season).</p>

<p>This is basically what happened to Utah with Gordon Hayward - they could have locked him up through 2019 for what would have been a big discount by the end of the deal, but because they played the RFA game to try and save a buck they lost him for nothing as a UFA in 2017.</p>

<p>So it was a matter of keeping the player or having no suitable replacement except guys on min contracts due to cap situations.</p>

<p>I mean it makes sense if you consider he was traded for someone who was immediately waived haha. Nicholson was on the Blazers payroll up until last year without playing a single minute for you guys, which is crazy to think about</p>

<p>Crabbe was really overpaid, but he was still an okay role player, his biggest fault was that he was constantly injured</p>

      <label for="lms46us" class="commentText"><p>Himself maybe, basically like DeAndre Ayton. Just stop trying to play well?</p>

<p>But also, if the player does perform like a star, that 5th year is locked in, much cheaper. Wagner is projected to make 22.5% of the cap in 2029-30, which is 51.0m. Whereas a second max contract would start at 67.9m. Plus, they’re an unrestricted free agent at that point. They could just be gone from your team.</p>

<p>With Kawhi Leonard, the Spurs waited him out. Didn’t extend him in the off-season. Then they offered a 5-year max anyway, for this purpose.</p>

If he’s next to another star level player that can shoot, yes, it will work. If you put him with like Jimmy and Bam, of course that’s going to be a fucking disaster but that’s not exclusive to Kuminga.

      <label for="lmsnius" class="commentText"><p>Steph and Klay, statistically, have the highest off ball gravity of any two players in the league. That was the case last year too, even in a Klay down year. Among all players, Steph was 1st and Klay was 2nd in off gravity (bball-index’s metric that measures the amount of resources a team’s defense dedicates to guarding a player when they don’t have the ball). Klay also led all off ball players last year in overall gravity (on ball and off ball gravity combined). So no, there are literally no other two players that Kuminga could get the same spacing from, let alone better.</p>

You can have a non-shooter, it depends on the pieces. My point was that of course his TS is going to drop with worse shooters around him than Steph and Klay.</p>

<p>Everyone is talking like wherever he ends up is going to be like the 2024 Detroit pistons who didn’t have any shooters. Almost no team is constructed like that anymore.</p>

      <label for="lmsqa5h" class="commentText"><p>Just having shooters, any shooters, around JK isn’t enough though is my point. His handle is way too loose (and his off season workout videos this summer have shown nothing to suggest it’s gotten markedly tighter) and he doesn’t have any counters and so unless he gets a wide open runway, all a defense needs to do is send a soft double to him and he either throws up a shot that has no chance of going in or he commits a turnover. We saw it happen over and over again the second half of last season once he was playing enough that the defense started scouting him. The only players he’ll likely get a wide enough runway with to be able to operate enough to get anywhere close to 20 pts are Steph and Klay.</p>

<p>And this is all ignoring the other end of the floor, which he has zero interest in playing.</p>

<p>It’s actually rather fun to play with this cap setup on BBGM. You can have a perennial MVP candidate or winner but have to trade him or let him walk because his contract demand is 80% of your cap and you simply can’t build a team good enough around him to actually win.</p>

<p>Basically, I&rsquo;m asking if it&rsquo;s &ldquo;better&rdquo; for the league that LeBron makes his rightful 80m a year or whatever but he has to do it for the Wizards with rookie contracts and second round picks as opposed to being able to see them team up and have those competitive series in the playoffs that bring popularity?</p>

      <label for="lmss0bw" class="commentText"><p>Baseball is a bit different as there’s not a real cap, owners can spend basically as much as they want on their roster (with various tax levels obviously as you spend more).  For the Angels it’s not as much Trout’s contract as it is their owner’s budget, rightfully or wrongfully. Baseball and basketball are also on total opposite ends of the spectrum of a single player’s impact, adding an MVP candidate to a bad baseball team doesn’t change that much but adding that to an NBA team is a massive jump in team performance.</p>

<p>The NFL is a better example. And you do have teams who are limited by bad contracts they sign. But in your example, LeBron getting <span class="math inline">\(80M to lead a shit team means that \)</span>80M is an <em>overpay</em> and LeBron actually isn’t worth that much. He’d get paid exactly as much as a team can possibly give him while also feeling they can build around him.</p>

<p>However, in this environment, all the star power would be spread a lot more evenly so it is entirely possible LeBron and rookies/minimums can be competitive, because it’d likely be rare for multiple all stars to ever be on the same team. Super teams would never exist because it’d require even just two guys to take a pretty significant pay cut to play with each other.</p>

<p>Each team would basically have one star level guy and try to build around him as best as possible. Would it be easier for the Bucks to build around Giannis taking 70% of the cap or the Hornets to build around Lamelo taking 50% of the cap? I really don’t know, it’d be super interesting to see. The parity would be really high.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s unclear to me is the value that having a Lebron, a Giannis, a Jokic, an Embiid, etc. has on the city, arena, surrounding property, ticket sales, advertising deals, or whatever else they bring to the table. All of the &ldquo;non-basketball&rdquo; stuff. The basketball focused teams are going to have a competitive cap they are willing to spend on these players. But I would hypothesize that the cap for a team who is looking at these other influence streams would have a higher number they&rsquo;d be willing to spend to bring a player like that in.</p>

<p>And also players demanding the max like that feels dumb as well. A team should really only have 1 actual max contract. 2 at most and that shiuld be the limit.</p>

<p>I know it makes it hard to keep stars on teams, but its the reasons teams cant keep roleplayers.</p>

      <label for="lmsbq3k" class="commentText"><p>Some pretty good ideas here. I’d be willing to go even further.</p>

<p>Players getting the Supermax extension can get 10% bumps, but if they are traded, they have to give back the extra 5% and the team is penalized by losing the salary cap discount for the rest of the contract. Players would get a no-trade clause automatically.</p>

<p>If the reason for the Supermax is to allow teams to keep their homegrown players, they should be disincentivized from trading him. And if the player accepts more money than they are normally eligible for, then they should also be penalized.</p>

<p>I don’t think there should be a limit to the number of max deals you can sign. If teams want to be foolish and overspend, they can certainly do so. Smart teams will find value where the dumb ones do not.</p>

Yes, there can be situations where there isn&rsquo;t much choice, like the nuggets with Murray, but even then, they could have waited for Murray to get a max offer elsewhere before matching.</p>

<p>You can hold the opinion that certain players don’t deserve the max without advocating for a consolidation of team salary over one player. Lol.</p>

      <label for="lmsv90q" class="commentText"><p>Yeah and with the stricter apron rules, I think we’re gonna see these “iffy” maxes die out very quickly, unless a team has no other choice (like with Jamal Murray). This off-season we were seeing very little market for players like Ingram, Lavine, and Markkannen. I think the league is finally wising up and not throwing a max at any dude averaging 20ppg before age 30</p>

Not a spot for him to truly get a solid run on the court each game, no chance of starting due to the tenure and ability of the players ahead of him, and not enough in the game plan on a regular basis to have a chance to break out.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It has nothing to do with tenure and more to do with the fact that he&rsquo;s a 3 that can&rsquo;t shoot. So if you play him at the 4, you&rsquo;re giving up rim protection and rebounding cuz he falls asleep on the boards too. It&rsquo;s not easy to find him minutes without destroying our spacing.</p>

      <label for="lms3rq3" class="commentText"><p>The Nets actually have a pretty good front office.  The Celtics trade was before Marks was in charge, and he clawed that team out of that hole pretty well.</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t really blame the Durant era ending the way it did on the FO either.  Basically every GM in that situation would take Durant and Kyrie.  The big mistake was choosing Jordan over Allen and Atkinson, but even then, they were a powerhouse at their peak and sometimes you gotta give in to pressure from a talent like Durant.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re handling the rebuild/teardown pretty well right now, just gotta see what they turn all that stuff into.</p>

      <label for="lmsdfom" class="commentText"><p>I think this paints over a few bumps along the way. As recently as the trade deadline they were looking to <em>add</em> talent and build around Mikal. Hell if they even somehow landed Mitchell they wouldn’t even be as good as the current Cavs, marginally better than play in caliber. Marks was asking for multiple firsts for DFS and 1-2 for cam Johnson, and I’d be surprised if he gets even 1 decent first for DFS at this point.</p>

<p>But ill commend marks as he made a big about face this offseason, A+ offseason not only getting great value for bridges but also getting their own picks back and ability to do a proper rebuild</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s done far more good than bad.</p>

<p>I agree he’s probably not max material but the warriors have also probably screwed his development. Who knows what he would be right now had he gotten more of a chance to develop. He’s a very high potential player.</p>

<p>I think in a few years there will be a lot more talk of how Kerr ended the dynasty by refusing to develop young players and riding with Klay and Dray for too long, most of the warriors’ problems the past two years were because of those two</p>

      <label for="lmsxo1r" class="commentText"><p>The &ldquo;expense&rdquo; was a championship in 2022. Kuminga was not ready period and still has issues in his game. They&rsquo;ve tried to let him win more minutes and he&rsquo;s failed. He doesn&rsquo;t get handed minutes when he continues to have issues with IQ, scheme, effort and attitude. Podz came in a won minutes right away. Kerr has no problem playing rookies when they earn it. Ppl in their arm chairs acting like they could&rsquo;ve balanced the two timelines so much better than Kerr is laughable. He&rsquo;ll prob get full starter minutes now. It&rsquo;s simple, ball out and earn the max, otherwise he might end up like Justice Winslow who had all the physical and athletic potential in the world, coached by an elite coach and just wasn&rsquo;t what everyone was hoping.</p>

      <label for="lmsytdm" class="commentText"><p>Well, I agree that two timelines was doomed to fail but that was mostly due to the GM drafting Wiseman, an all time bust, when there were better players available. But that happens.</p>

<p>Where kerr messed up imo was letting Draymond off the hook with zero consequences after the poole punch (destroying team chemistry and making Poole go from a promising young player to the worst starter in the league) and in giving Klay way too many minutes/shot attempts the first half of last season when it was obvious his shot wasn’t there. You can argue Kuminga/moody weren’t ready their first two years but it was ridiculous it took intense media/front office pressure for Kerr to finally give them some playing time last year despite how poorly Klay was playing and Draymond’s absence.</p>

<p>Like the mans got talent and a few years ago he mighthave been able to get it.</p>

<p>But with the CBA as it is now and with the state of the Warriors rn that cant really afford to go into the 2nd apron at all (cause they are gonna go into a rebuild in the next couple of years once Steph retires at the lastest).</p>

      <label for="lmszyyw" class="commentText"><p>Just out of curiosity, if it were financially possible (don&rsquo;t think it is), would you be willing to move off of AG to get Kuminga?</p>

<p>I was trying to think of what is a theoretical best case scenario for Kuminga in terms of a player who was a non-shot creation so-so shooting athletic 4 that was able to make an impact on winning, and AG came to my mind.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s a potential free agent this year unless you sign him to an extension as he&rsquo;s obviously not picking up that player option.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s an interesting conversation to be had about whether you would rather pay a proven AG for his age 29-32 seasons as opposed to paying an unproven Kuminga for his age 23-27 seasons. And when I say proven, I&rsquo;m talking about the most important thing when it comes to making decisions for Denver, which is, do you fit with Jokic.</p>

<p>But in theory, you can see a world where Kuminga can somewhat replicate that Gordon role as an off-ball cutter with more ISO scoring ability.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>What you say makes sense tbh. Kuminga is only slightly smaller than AG, though could fit that role.</p>

<p>He isnt quite the defender AG is, but has the tools to become that good.</p>

<p>And on offense, he is more versatile.</p>

<p>By all right i do think Kuminga would fit the Nuggets offense more than the Warriors offense if he was put in AGs position.</p>

<p>And our FO is crazy enough to try and get him, though i dont think they could quite pay him anything more than the Warriors could, if even as much.</p>

<p>But an intresting thought experiment.</p>

If he balls out at the beginning of the season though, I bet they’ll offer him the max. But I get why the Warriors want to remain flexible. Curry still believes he can win another chip there, and he certainly dictates the purse strings. I can imagine the FO consults him &amp; Kerr on those sort of things.</p>
