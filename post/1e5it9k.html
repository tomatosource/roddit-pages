<p>Keeps calling them &ldquo;allegations&rdquo; when the Porter Jr admitted to beating Kysre <em>and</em> just plead guilty</p>

<p>Also, saying &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to downplay domestic violence&rdquo;  (while discussing a player literally guilty of it that they saw fit to reward with a multi-million dollar contract)</p>

<p><em>and</em> they talk about how they want to &ldquo;create a safe and comfortable work environment&rdquo; but they only spoke to &ldquo;experts&rdquo; (aka a PR firm that figures it&rsquo;ll all blow over) and specifically says they didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;talk to any women&rdquo; working within the organization</p>

<p>What a joke.  Frank is in over his head.</p>

<p>Not exactly. He pleaded to a much lesser charge than what was eventually put forward. His guilty plea is basically a nothing deal with no fine or jail time and it&rsquo;ll be off his record in a few months. It was a no brainer to take that deal.</p>

<p>Obviously something happened that night but between the deal KPJ received, Kysre denying all of what was reported, no photos or video, and the assistant DA getting caught attributing injuries that where confirmed to have happened previously (anything neck related) there&rsquo;s so much unknown here it&rsquo;s really not fair to compare this to someone like Miles Bridges.</p>

      <label for="ldmfsgh" class="commentText"><p>Two comments: (1) Porter took a plea deal.  It&rsquo;s a progressive talking point that the criminal justice system is broken, and you take plea deals to avoid the risk of a worse jury verdict, <em>not</em> because you are guilty or innocent one way or another.  In that context, i think it&rsquo;s fair to say in practice that a plea deal does not speak to guilt or innocence.</p>

<p>(2) The &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t you talk to women&rdquo; insinuation is nonsensical.  Again, it is a progressive talking point to eliminate &ldquo;ban the box&rdquo; laws so that employers cannot discriminate against job applicants with criminal records.  But again, any time a crime or alleged crime involves a woman as an alleged victim, the progressive talking points become flipped, and you&rsquo;ve got the liberals acting like cops.</p>

<p>If your political or societal position is that folks that commit or allegedly commit crimes against women should not be employable as free men, then we are really just pivoting discrimination against women with discrimination against folks accused of crimes against women.  Discrimination is wrong.  Hot take.</p>

There is no &ldquo;allegedly&rdquo; about this case. He is not just &ldquo;accused of crimes against women&rdquo;, he is guilty of crimes against woman.</p>

<p>Whether you think rehab works for abusers or think people should have second chances is another story. But don&rsquo;t act like he&rsquo;s the victim of discrimination here</p>

<p>There is though. Kysre statements and the assistant caught fudging things really do matter.</p>

<p>Obviously domestic violence on any level is wrong, that doesn&rsquo;t need to be said. But getting into a heated argument and pushing someone who then hits a wall isn&rsquo;t on the same level was pinning someone down, punching them in the face, and choking them. We don&rsquo;t know what happened, but we do know what was first reported wasn&rsquo;t true and we only know what the people involved have said. KPJ hasn&rsquo;t said a peep. Kysre denies it all at this point. No witnesses spoke out or were used in an official capacity, just cited by police officers to TMZ reporter.</p>

<p>If the initial report was close to accurate then KPJ should be done. That was truly horrendous. But we really don&rsquo;t know the extent of what happened and clearly the prosecution didn&rsquo;t either since he basically got nothing for a sentence. He won&rsquo;t even officially be &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; in a few months.</p>

      <label for="ldmo9q9" class="commentText"><p>Every day, innocent people plea guilty without actually being guilty, so a guilty admission is meaningless from a social perspective. Independent of that, I don’t care if he is Jeffrey dahmer — if he did his time, and he has no court-mandated work restrictions, the guy gets to work.</p>

<p>This modern logic that one should discriminate against people out of prison is nuts. You’re taking away victims’ agency by creating this presupposition that women need protection from ex cons. Under that logic, we should just be executing these people if they aren’t allowed to work.</p>

      <label for="ldmsb84" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not an excuse.  I would not  care if he raped 200 people.  If he served his time, he&rsquo;s allowed to work.  This is a progressive labor position.  In the history of progressive thought, it&rsquo;s never been a thing until recently to discriminate against folks who have completed and complied with criminal sentencing.</p>

<p>I realize this is unpopular and it&rsquo;s easier to get internet points for being &ldquo;pro woman,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s factual. The Clippers should not care in the slightest about what crimes Kevin Porter committed or didn&rsquo;t commit if he&rsquo;s a free man.  They profit off winning games, and his contract is a market inefficiency.  Look at the Atlanta Braves.  They&rsquo;ve gamed the system by employing Marcel Ozuna and are profiting off it; they&rsquo;re not losing money by employing him.</p>

<p>“First of all, look, we&rsquo;re obviously very aware of his history. We&rsquo;ve studied the case. We don&rsquo;t in any way want to downplay or minimize or condone domestic violence, okay? The allegations are serious and they&rsquo;re disturbing. With that being said, what we did is we hired an outside expert. We spent a couple days with Kevin, the expert did a very thorough evaluation and based on the expert&rsquo;s recommendations, we decided that it was worth an opportunity for Kevin. Now, with that being said, there&rsquo;s a personal development plan that he committed to back in October, and then we have our own personal development plan that he&rsquo;s committed to and will be held accountable to and we think based on those facts that positive change is possible and the standards will be high for Kevin. But we totally are aware of the history and in no shape, way, shape or form do we want to minimize what the allegations are.”</p>

<p>“Did you guys have any conversations with some of the women in the organization about bringing him in at all?”</p>

<p>“Well, I think we didn&rsquo;t have conversations with specific women, but every decision that we make is we want to create a safe and comfortable work environment and based on the experts we consulted with, they gave us very encouraging, in regards to a safe and comfortable work environment, that will not be a factor.”</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s really not accurate. KPJ showed to be great off-ball a couple years ago and had fantastic catch and shoot numbers. Houston was just an awful team no other guard or wing could be trusted with the ball.</p>

<p>Skill-wise he&rsquo;s right there with guys like Herro and Simons and honestly has Maxey level upside. He was asked to learn to be a PG with no vets and an awful system in place. It&rsquo;s amazing he did as well as he did. Give KPJ some teammates who can play, vets who give a damn, and a quality coach and you&rsquo;ll see a very good player.</p>

<p>Again, you don&rsquo;t want him on your team because of his past I get it. But from a basketball point of view, he will help your team win games.</p>

<p>Love that this reporter is asking these questions.</p>

<p>This really puts the fans in an awkward spot, like do you cheer against your own team or do you cheer for DV guy?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s sad, if Ant was in the position KPJ was in, people would be absolutely be citing the lack of photo or video, the shady assistant DA, and Kysre denying anything happened and go on loving him. But since people already made up their mind they don&rsquo;t like KPJ, none of that matters. It&rsquo;s not about what happens, it&rsquo;s about who does it.</p>

      <label for="ldmqouf" class="commentText"><p>Fuck this guy and fuck the Clippers.  They paid someone to tell them he was okay mentally; they have a developmental plan but released no information about what it involves so there&rsquo;s no public transparency to hold Porter Jr. or the Clippers accountable; and besides the obvious point that was made that the women he&rsquo;ll be around and work with had no say in how to handle this situation &hellip; Frank said twice I don&rsquo;t want to minimize but the fact that Frank&rsquo;s willing to leverage the safety of the other players, their families, and the women around the organization, and hire someone that almost beat a woman to death <strong>is minimizing all of it, over and over.</strong></p>
