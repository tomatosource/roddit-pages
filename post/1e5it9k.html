<p>Keeps calling them &ldquo;allegations&rdquo; when the Porter Jr admitted to beating Kysre <em>and</em> just plead guilty</p>

<p>Also, saying &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to downplay domestic violence&rdquo;  (while discussing a player literally guilty of it that they saw fit to reward with a multi-million dollar contract)</p>

<p><em>and</em> they talk about how they want to &ldquo;create a safe and comfortable work environment&rdquo; but they only spoke to &ldquo;experts&rdquo; (aka a PR firm that figures it&rsquo;ll all blow over) and specifically says they didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;talk to any women&rdquo; working within the organization</p>

<p>What a joke.  Frank is in over his head.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not exactly. He pleaded to a much lesser charge than what was eventually put forward. His guilty plea is basically a nothing deal with no fine or jail time and it&rsquo;ll be off his record in a few months. It was a no brainer to take that deal.</p>

<p>Obviously something happened that night but between the deal KPJ received, Kysre denying all of what was reported, no photos or video, and the assistant DA getting caught attributing injuries that where confirmed to have happened previously (anything neck related) there&rsquo;s so much unknown here it&rsquo;s really not fair to compare this to someone like Miles Bridges.</p>

<p>So in all actuality,  without 100% proof, they actually are allegations.</p>

<p>There are other kind of plea deals (such as a no contest plea) where you accept punishment without admitting that you did anything, but that is not what he did here.</p>

If the story is so sketchy why would I not pay for the defense team to fight it? You say a jury won’t believe it, but people are acquitted of these cases all the time and even if you really think that, waive the right to a jury and have a bench trial.</p>

<p>This is not the case of some random person with no resources being railroaded by a prosecutor because they can’t mount a defense. Stop pretending it is.</p>

<p>You understand that there are crazy people out there right, including chicks? I know stories of chicks actually punching them selves to frame a dude, this shit is real.</p>

<p>Nobody here actually knows what happened, because there is not 100% proof like video evidence, so they are allegations, taking a plea isn&rsquo;t actually admitting guilt even if it is classified as such because it is a DEAL vs a gamble and at the end of the day that&rsquo;s what that admission is based on, not what actually happened.</p>

<p>How do you not understand that there can be evidence (like marks on a chicks face/neck) but it is not proof because it just as easily could have come from the chick framing the guy in all actuality (aka you know you are innocent) but the jury may still get swayed by this evidence.</p>

<p>Even if you know you are innocent, it is still a gamble.</p>

<p>Once again, admission from a deal that gives you a chill certainty vs a gamble that might land you in prison is not a real admission, it&rsquo;s basically an admission under durress.</p>

      <label for="ldn3f9p" class="commentText"><p>Why is it so hard for you to understand that part of the consequences of pleading guilty is that you admitted it happened. You are giving up the right to call it “alleged” in exchanged for certainty about what the punishment could be. If you don’t want to admit that you’re a wife beater and you have millions of dollars to fight it, take the fucking risk. If not, you are admitting you are a wife beater.</p>

<p>The moving the goal posts you guys do is absurd.</p>

<p>When allegations come out it’s “what happened to innocent until proven guilty!?”</p>

<p>When someone pleads guilty it’s “We’ll never know for sure because he plead guilty before it was proved in court”</p>

<p>And I bet if he was actually convicted you’d say “well they’re still just allegations because his wife was crazy and lied and the jury believed her.”</p>

<p>Under your reasoning there is no way the allegations could ever be proven, so I guess you don’t have to feel bad about rooting for him.</p>

      <label for="ldn5a4q" class="commentText"><p>No, under my way there is 100% proof, which didn&rsquo;t happen here, and there are jury&rsquo;s that can be swayed. His admission is only damning to him for people like you who cannot grasp the reality of an admission under duress of gambling prison, for the cost of millions, and the reward of no community service and a 100% clean pr title (for ignorant people such as yourself), vs maybe $10k in lawyer fees and the cost of community service and a lame title that is in all actually still an allegation (yet ignorant people fall for the false admission). Every lawyer in the world would recommend taking that plea deal.</p>

<p>You cannot sit here with a straight face and say you&rsquo;d want to spend millions for no guarantee (even if you actually are innocent) and face PRISON FOR YEARS, vs spending a fraction to have community service.</p>

<p>Watch the shows Suits and see why the best lawyers try to make deals and don&rsquo;t want to go to trial. You clearly do not know how that world works.</p>

<p>He could still be found guilty (plenty of innocent guys have been locked away), not be able to prove himself and still have this title anyway, might as well not pay the money and face the unknown potential of fucking prison if you might still have this title anyway.</p>

<p>You are just being stubborn now and not accepting how this world actually works.</p>

<p>Lol dude can&rsquo;t refute this yet has to get the last word in and then block me.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see if he can answer this, what is the 100% proof that KPJ did this?</p>

<p>Best I have heard is markings on her neck, which once again is evidence, not 100% proof, as I have pointed out, crazy chicks can frame dudes, you can actually grab your own neck if you didn&rsquo;t realize. Could this be enough to sway a jury, possibly, as is the general sentiment, and that why you take a chill ass plea of community service instead of that gamble even if you do have million dollar lawyers.</p>

<p>She did come out and say the prosecutors had it all wrong and that he is innocent, show me the actual video of him beating her, then I&rsquo;ll say you have 100% proof.</p>

There is no &ldquo;allegedly&rdquo; about this case. He is not just &ldquo;accused of crimes against women&rdquo;, he is guilty of crimes against woman.</p>

<p>Whether you think rehab works for abusers or think people should have second chances is another story. But don&rsquo;t act like he&rsquo;s the victim of discrimination here</p>

<p>There is though. Kysre statements and the assistant caught fudging things really do matter.</p>

<p>Obviously domestic violence on any level is wrong, that doesn&rsquo;t need to be said. But getting into a heated argument and pushing someone who then hits a wall isn&rsquo;t on the same level was pinning someone down, punching them in the face, and choking them. We don&rsquo;t know what happened, but we do know what was first reported wasn&rsquo;t true and we only know what the people involved have said. KPJ hasn&rsquo;t said a peep. Kysre denies it all at this point. No witnesses spoke out or were used in an official capacity, just cited by police officers to TMZ reporter.</p>

<p>If the initial report was close to accurate then KPJ should be done. That was truly horrendous. But we really don&rsquo;t know the extent of what happened and clearly the prosecution didn&rsquo;t either since he basically got nothing for a sentence. He won&rsquo;t even officially be &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; in a few months.</p>

Independent of that, I don’t care if he is Jeffrey dahmer — if he did his time, and he has no court-mandated work restrictions, the guy gets to work.</p>

<p>This modern logic that one should discriminate against people out of prison is nuts. You’re taking away victims’ agency by creating this presupposition that women need protection from ex cons. Under that logic, we should just be executing these people if they aren’t allowed to work.</p>

This is a progressive labor position.  In the history of progressive thought, it&rsquo;s never been a thing until recently to discriminate against folks who have completed and complied with criminal sentencing.</p>

<p>I realize this is unpopular and it&rsquo;s easier to get internet points for being &ldquo;pro woman,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s factual. The Clippers should not care in the slightest about what crimes Kevin Porter committed or didn&rsquo;t commit if he&rsquo;s a free man.  They profit off winning games, and his contract is a market inefficiency.  Look at the Atlanta Braves.  They&rsquo;ve gamed the system by employing Marcel Ozuna and are profiting off it; they&rsquo;re not losing money by employing him.</p>

<p>Porter had the victim retract her statement due to his financial status, he played the broken system and got away with it only to be rewarded with another contract.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t even about being pro-woman lol this is completely about holding organizations accountable for their decisions. Organizations being about 100% profits and having 0 ethical or moral backbones is not a &ldquo;progessive labor position&rdquo; lol</p>

      <label for="ldmv4mv" class="commentText"><p>Its not meaningless from a social perspective. Maybe its meaningless in your perspective. But there is no logical reason to assume that everyone who plead guilty is in this ambiguous place between guilty and innocent.</p>

<p>And jumping to the extremes doesn&rsquo;t make your point better. I actually agree with you that there should be room for 2nd chances and for rehabing people that did shitty things. But its also not discrimination to think its shitty that abusers can get multi-million dollar contracts. I am not a criminal, and I do not have any work restrictions. If someone didn&rsquo;t hire me because they didn&rsquo;t like something about me, that&rsquo;s not discrimination. Felon/criminals are not a protected class, and there is no reason to treat them like one.</p>

<p>Also, I really don&rsquo;t see how its taking away victims&rsquo; agency to assume women might be uncomfortable working with someone who harassed and assaulted a woman. And to expect there to be a conversation involving women to see if they are uncomfortable or not.</p>

You can legally discriminate based on immigration status &ndash; doesn&rsquo;t make that a good thing.  I have defended thousands of criminals, some violent, some innocent, many of which served serious time in inhumane facilities.  The first thing I do when my former clients get out of prison is give them a key to my guest house.  And knock on wood, no one has murdered my family yet.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I just don&rsquo;t comprehend why it&rsquo;s shitty that abusers can get multi-million dollar contracts.  I don&rsquo;t understand how or why that&rsquo;s shitty.   In my brain, it&rsquo;s a non-sequitur. I became a lawyer because the liberal thing to do was to defend alleged criminals.  Midway through my career, the whole &ldquo;believe all woman&rdquo; stuff came about, and somehow &ldquo;guilty until proven innocent&rdquo; became the new liberal norm for alleged criminals.</p>

<p>A guy like DeShaun Watson &ndash; who loved prostitutes and got targeted by a de facto class action of prostitutes who found out they could possibly make more money accusing him of crimes than accepting his John money &ndash; never faced a charge that could even get passed a grand jury, but a fan is persona non grata if they even cheer for that guy in 2024.</p>

Jury trials are coinflips &ndash; that&rsquo;s why pleas happen.  It&rsquo;s not because public defenders are bad.  Public defenders have more trial reps than most rain makers at big law firms. It&rsquo;s because a jury is not a neutral AI that can mathematically quantify burdens of proof.</p>

<p>“First of all, look, we&rsquo;re obviously very aware of his history. We&rsquo;ve studied the case. We don&rsquo;t in any way want to downplay or minimize or condone domestic violence, okay? The allegations are serious and they&rsquo;re disturbing. With that being said, what we did is we hired an outside expert. We spent a couple days with Kevin, the expert did a very thorough evaluation and based on the expert&rsquo;s recommendations, we decided that it was worth an opportunity for Kevin. Now, with that being said, there&rsquo;s a personal development plan that he committed to back in October, and then we have our own personal development plan that he&rsquo;s committed to and will be held accountable to and we think based on those facts that positive change is possible and the standards will be high for Kevin. But we totally are aware of the history and in no shape, way, shape or form do we want to minimize what the allegations are.”</p>

<p>“Did you guys have any conversations with some of the women in the organization about bringing him in at all?”</p>

<p>“Well, I think we didn&rsquo;t have conversations with specific women, but every decision that we make is we want to create a safe and comfortable work environment and based on the experts we consulted with, they gave us very encouraging, in regards to a safe and comfortable work environment, that will not be a factor.”</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s really not accurate. KPJ showed to be great off-ball a couple years ago and had fantastic catch and shoot numbers. Houston was just an awful team no other guard or wing could be trusted with the ball.</p>

<p>Skill-wise he&rsquo;s right there with guys like Herro and Simons and honestly has Maxey level upside. He was asked to learn to be a PG with no vets and an awful system in place. It&rsquo;s amazing he did as well as he did. Give KPJ some teammates who can play, vets who give a damn, and a quality coach and you&rsquo;ll see a very good player.</p>

<p>Again, you don&rsquo;t want him on your team because of his past I get it. But from a basketball point of view, he will help your team win games.</p>

<p>This really puts the fans in an awkward spot, like do you cheer against your own team or do you cheer for DV guy?</p>

They paid someone to tell them he was okay mentally; they have a developmental plan but released no information about what it involves so there&rsquo;s no public transparency to hold Porter Jr. or the Clippers accountable; and besides the obvious point that was made that the women he&rsquo;ll be around and work with had no say in how to handle this situation &hellip; Frank said twice I don&rsquo;t want to minimize but the fact that Frank&rsquo;s willing to leverage the safety of the other players, their families, and the women around the organization, and hire someone that almost beat a woman to death <strong>is minimizing all of it, over and over.</strong></p>
