      <label for="leqxfah" class="commentText"><p>Book is awesome, he would’ve been the heir to Wade instead of Justise. He was for sure coming here too and had met Wade and Wade gave him the stamp of approval. Would’ve been our pick if not for Winslow dropping. Would’ve been wildly different for us and who knows what happens. Maybe Wade leaves anyway, maybe we don’t get him or draft Herro or bam. And if we had the picks that were being rumored to give up on Justise for Book? Man idk, Riley with that much draft capital would’ve been dangerous. We still barely had picks back then, Justise was in a year we had a top 10 protected pick. Phoenix owned 2 of our picks in the future too. We’d have gotten 4-5 picks from Boston I think 2-3 FRPs, although I don’t think it was the nets picks but still</p>

Despite a lot of the top 10 guys bustin, the first round still produced Tatum, Fox, Lauri, Mitchell, Adebayo, OG, Allen, White, Monk, Hart, Kuzma, Collins, and Kennard.</p>

      <label for="leqohlv" class="commentText"><blockquote>
<p>One of the main things that jumps out at you is JJ’s versatility on both sides of the ball … From an offensive standpoint, he possesses a very high Basketball IQ that allows him to be aware of where his teammates are on the court … While he doesn’t play the role of a primary ball handler for Kansas, he’s averaging a very impressive 3.1 assists per game … He gets many of these due his natural knack of knowing where everyone is on the court, and having the touch and creativity to get the ball where it needs to go …</p>

<p>His motor also jumps off the page, he’s an elite offensive rebounder for a 6’8’’ wing and is extremely assertive when he’s on the hunt for a loose ball, or rebound … Jackson also has a very solid first step, and the ball handling ability to get past defenders at a level that looks to translate to the NBA … He also plays within himself with the ball in his hands …</p>

<p>He’s shown takeover ability this season for the Jayhawks, but for a freshman averaging 15.3 ppg, he’s very controlled, and doesn’t have the tendency to get sloppy for the sake of getting a shot … He’s an extremely disruptive and explosive defender too, with a solid 6’9.75’’ wingspan, which will aid him in his NBA translation …</p>

<p>He’s not the type of defender that merely hinders his opponents ability to score, he’s deadly in the passing lanes, and is aggressive trying to steal the ball and deflecting passes … This results in a lot of fast breaks, and easy transition buckets …</p>

<p>His shot blocking ability is also very impressive for a wing … Jackson blocks 1.5 shots per game (to go with 1.5 steals) and has the ability to get them in one on one situations, or coming over from the weak side … Jackson has also played 3 positions for Kansas this year ranging from the 2, to a small ball 4 … He looks to only be able to play shooting guard and small forward in the NBA, but he can do so effectively on both sides of the ball …</p>

<p>Athletically he’s explosive, quick, and has good lateral, as well as open court speed … His assertiveness, and aggressive tendencies pair with his athletic gifts making him a regular on highlight reels, and this is a valuable quality in regards to team momentum … Has a blue collar work ethic and willingness to do the dirty work, does not exhibit the prima donna attitude often associated with elite level prospects … An extremely competitive and passionate kid who brings a high level of intensity and desire to improve …</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nbadraft.net/players/josh-jackson/" target="_blank">https://www.nbadraft.net/players/josh-jackson/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jackson was a highly intriguing prospect, just one that needed time to develop a shot.</p>

<p>Of course that went terribly.  But it happens.  That&rsquo;s why they are prospects and not sure things.</p>

      <label for="lepnqjo" class="commentText"><p>That game convinced me that the Sixers made the right decision to trade up for Fultz. He looked excellent that game and was confident in shooting 3s even when there&rsquo;s a hand in his face. Crazy that we still don&rsquo;t know what happened to him after SL.</p>

      <label for="leqic7k" class="commentText"><p>The shoulder impingement issue was absolutely what it was. They didn’t diagnose it properly at the time, but it’s not a lingering mystery or anything.</p>

<p>I never played seriously but throughout my 20’s I had a similar issue (I never pinpointed it because it didn’t affect my day to day life/career, though it could have resulted from an older shoulder injury).</p>

<p>I didn’t feel any pain, but all of a sudden I just had no power in my shooting arm at all and had to exert a ton of effort and adjust my shooting form in order to reach the basket. Like I’m talking I had to completely palm the ball, lower my release point, and <em>heave</em> it or else it would be way short. Whereas if I shot with my left hand I could just jump and flick my wrist and get it there with considerably less effort. I’ve always been right hand dominant and my right arm has more muscle definition so it was really strange.</p>

<p>Or if I was doing push-ups, my right side would sometimes just completely give out after 15-20 even though it didn’t feel fatigued/I felt no pain at all.</p>

<p>That lasted for 7-8 years and then one day I joined my work softball league and was doing warmup throws and I completely lost the ability to aim the ball. Like I would sail it 20 feet in the air throwing to my friend 15 yards away. I felt a weird twinge in my shoulder and a lingering pain, and played first base since it was hard for me to throw.</p>

<p>By the next day my shoulder had stopped hurting, so I went to play basketball. All of a sudden my shot went back to full strength the way it had been when I was younger, my first jumper sailed way over the backboard lol. I had to completely recalibrate as I could now shoot a 3 with probably 50% less effort than before. Shooting from close to half court was about the same level of effort as I’d previously used to shoot 18 footers.</p>

<p>I can’t imagine trying to carve out an nba career while dealing with that shit lol.</p>

      <label for="lepssfl" class="commentText"><p>What’s interesting to me is that shot he hit for the game winner is not in his arsenal anymore. Any mid range he takes is either two jab steps shoot over or a turn around fade. He doesn’t pull up in the midrange anymore. Idk if it’s good or not that he moved away but that’s 100% JBs game now. Can’t remember the last time I saw JT dribble into a pull up midrange</p>

      <label for="lere9c4" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I fully agree. He’s still great but when it comes to scoring he has no uniqueness or flair that defines his game. It’s always the same moves and motions without many tricks or really any fluidity to a lot of it. When he starts it actually dribble or use his strength when driving it starts to work but I wish he had some of the sauce he had when he was a rookie</p>

      <label for="leqdvjc" class="commentText"><p>No they wouldn’t have. They absolutely didn’t discuss those terms, because otherwise it doesn’t make any sense from the Sixers’ perspective.</p>

<p>If they knew the Celtics were taking tatum at 1; everyone knew the lakers were taking Lonzo at 2; there’s no reason to trade up.</p>

<p>At best the Sixers suspected that the Celtics didn’t care between Tatum and Fultz, or at least not enough to make sure they got tatum once the trade transpired.</p>

<p>The way I see it is as follows.</p>

<p>Celtics see tatum=fultz</p>

<p>Sixers see Fultz&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; tatum</p>

<p>Therefore the Celtics trade down still getting one of the two players they’d be happy with, and an extra first round pick, but they’re expecting to even end up with tatum because the Sixers are scheming to get the top pick and Fultz is the 1 on most boards.</p>

<p>The Sixers reveal information about their intention to the Celtics, but the Celtics don’t reveal their preferred order to the Sixers. It’s a simple case of information asymmetry. The moment the Sixers approach for the top pick, the Celtics know what the Sixers want.</p>

      <label for="leqpes1" class="commentText"><p>The way these trades actually happen is that the Sixers and the Celtics are both relatively forthcoming with who they want, and the Celtics make the trade on the condition that the Sixers take Fultz at 1. They could have gone rogue and selected Tatum, but it would have been a huge blow to their reputation when trying to make a trade with anyone in the league.</p>

<p>He has dragged his teams to finals and at his current level he can also win it if he gets decent mates that Embiid has had, don&rsquo;t use the sorry excuse of Embiid of not having help when he has played with Jimmy, Harden, Maxey, functional Ben and decent role players, he isn&rsquo;t Lebron with the cavs jeez</p>

he has a monster team. and he played against hospital teams in the East.
the Celtics without Tatum would be heavy favourite against injuried Pacers or Cavs anyway.</p>

<p>every other elite player does other stuff.  no true superstar (Tatum is not that anyway) is useless when shoots are not falling.
but you need to score at an elite level in the Finals. so yeah, not that guy. very good player still.</p>

<p>and who is even comparing Embiid and Tatum?
i don&rsquo;t give a shit about Embiid and the Sixers but Embiid is on a whole different level.
the guy literally played better on one leg than Tatum completely healthy.
no sane person is taking Tatum over healthy Embiid.
but health is a problem.</p>

      <label for="leqlfam" class="commentText"><p>I don’t really think it’s controversial to say those constant injuries all stemmed from this freak injury. Before he went to Boston, he played 72, 66 (out of 66), 72, 77, 76, 80, 73. That’s an insanely healthy star right there, like how many stars had missed 10 games at most in their first 7 seasons?</p>

      <label for="leqdi2b" class="commentText"><p>Clearly a future star? He was definitely considered a high floor, potentially low ceiling player. He was seen as most NBA ready to score a bucket, but people at the time were speculating that he might not be much more than a one-dimensional black hole scorer with limited two way and playmaking upside.</p>

<p>I wanted Jamal Murray over Jaylen Brown and Fultz over Tatum so believe me I was wrong on both (no disrespect to Murray he would have been a great pick), but saying Tatum was clearly a future star at the draft when he wasn’t a lock to be a top 5 pick is just a bit rich. Tatum has developed into a selfless, play making, rebounding, defensive minded player with the ability to get buckets. The exact opposite of the “well he can definitely get buckets but might not develop into much else” talk around the draft</p>

      <label for="leq14ls" class="commentText"><p>Tatum landed in the best place possible. If he went to the 6ers, would have been a dumpster fire. If he went to the Lakers, him and BI would have cannibalized each others’ development. We then would have shipped either/or and Caruso in that package for AD or both of them would have been in the package. This only would have been nice as the Celtics would have had Lonzo most likely and that hinders their progress but honestly they probably still end up with a ship somehow.</p>

      <label for="lepwhke" class="commentText"><p>Nah Tatum was definitely considered NBA-ready, but with a lower upside than guys like Fultz, Ball, and even Jackson because he was viewed as a one-dimensional volume scorer who didn&rsquo;t really have standout athleticism.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if that&rsquo;s entirely inaccurate, he really benefited as a rookie from being on a Stevens-coached team where he was relied upon way less than your standard rookie.  He&rsquo;s not a tremendous leaper or super fast or anything either.  The biggest thing for Tatum is that he&rsquo;s a total workhorse.  He&rsquo;s had a major body transformation since entering the league and is now probably 90th percentile strength which has opened up his driving and post game.  His playmaking jump is pretty aberrant too.  The big thing the scouts were obviously wrong at at the time was his defensive potential, he was a plus defender pretty much immediately.</p>
