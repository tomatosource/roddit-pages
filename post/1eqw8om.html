</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Context: I want to form an all-time team with prime Steph/Klay/KD/LeBron but have issues about the 5.</p>

<p>Jokic is obviously the best out of AD and Dwight but he is not a good rim protector and I have enough scoring/offense with Steph/KD/LeBron and playmaking with Steph/LeBron. Jokic&rsquo;s screening and rebounding will be really helpful though and he will allow the team to play true 5 out which gives LeBron the best spacing.</p>

<p>AD is the most versatile defender compared to Dwight (more switchable) but he is not big enough to body bigger bigs like Jokic or Shaq. I like AD&rsquo;s off ball game the most out of the 3 + he is a good FT shooter</p>

<p>Dwight is a defender that matches up the best against true bigs like Shaq and he has a good off ball game when focused on his strengths (unlike say 2011 where he stopped PnR due to media pressure).</p>

<p>Which big fits this team the best?</p>

Prime Dwight could be somewhat of a headcase, he really wanted post ups when he wasn&rsquo;t super great at it, and other shit. AD would also be a great defensive anchor, he&rsquo;d also be more comfortable as the fourth offensive option, I think the chemistry would be better</p>

      <label for="lhupjli" class="commentText"><p>Why do you need a defensive anchor with Bron, KD, and Klay? AD’s comparative “weakness” defending big centers could largely be mitigated by the fact that prime LeBron and KD are both really versatile defenders in the backcourt. Part of the magic of the 2020 Laker’s defense was exactly that — AD could roam on defense because LeBron could switch to defending center if AD was caught out of position. It hasn’t worked as well since largely because LeBron is just too old to do that for long stretches. But prime LeBron (AND KD and Klay?), would absolutely smother opposing offenses with AD out there too.</p>

      <label for="lhupwes" class="commentText"><p>See I disagree here and I think this is where the second half of Dwight&rsquo;s career with the bad back/bad attitude is influencing people too much. Dwight in his prime with his level of athleticism and as a guy that could just dunk, a GOAT level rebounder that could grab everything and give PERENNIALLY DPOY performance is just about perfect. If he screens and gets a mismatch down low, then just lol, it&rsquo;s an auto 2 points.</p>

<p>Like there&rsquo;s no bad option here, but there&rsquo;s a reason AD was kind of best suited with the 2nd unit, he commands a bit more of an active offensive role. You don&rsquo;t need his middy game or to step out to the 3, you have Curry the best shooter ever, KD a walking bucket with a great all-around scoring game including mid-range and of course LeBron who is the closest thing to a pass like Magic, score like Jordan hybrid ever. Dwight is a more natural gravitational floor spacer and so perfectly scalable for playing with great players.</p>

AD struggles with Jokic, and I think there’s a handful of players historically that he would struggle with as well.   </p>

<p>Outside of Wilt, is there a better answer for “prime Shaq” than “prime Dwight”? People may scoff or give answers like Sabonis (giant (head) maybe), or Hakeem (fair, though not LA Shaq), but Dwight was a fucking defensive god in the paint… AD is too, but moreso as a help guy. And AD would struggle with behemoths like we’re talking about.</p>

<p>And if Dwight’s man stays home, great—Lebron finishes a layup 99% of the time, Curry gets an easy teardrop/floater, KD does KD things, Klay probably pulls up middy or bungles it but whatever, he’s not taking the shots anyways unless it’s in the perimeter.</p>

      <label for="lhutbzk" class="commentText"><p>Ironically your letting injured ad and his &lsquo;soft&rsquo; perception influence you too much. Literally everything you said Dwight does AD does just as well except rebounding, which AD still does extremely well. And Dwight was also probably best suited as a number 2 as well, we just never got to see him do it. There&rsquo;s a very limited number of bigs suited to be number ones on champions in the history of the league and ad was closer than Dwight. Pretty much the only reason you&rsquo;d ever choose Dwight over ad in any scenario is that Dwight&rsquo;s body is better suited to playing the 5 for a whole season but if health is guaranteed I think this is no brainer scenario. And not that I think AD is THAT much better than Dwight, but I do think it&rsquo;s pretty clear. Dwight literally does not have one skill set better than Dwight besides marginally better rebounding and even then you could argue that&rsquo;s just because of play styles.</p>

      <label for="lhuvfn2" class="commentText"><p>I mean AD is the guy that didn&rsquo;t want to play the 5 for a really long time for a reason. I wouldn&rsquo;t say their rebounding difference is &ldquo;marginal&rdquo;, their rebounding numbers aren&rsquo;t particularly close and I definitely take rebounding as a priority when we&rsquo;re discussing a player that is already reduced to &ldquo;role player&rdquo;. A big reason the USA was more closely contested by Serbia and France is because of rebounding. It&rsquo;s not shade to AD, Dwight is just one of the best rebounders ever.</p>

<p>Dwight did carry a team that didn&rsquo;t have a second star to an NBA Finals even beating LeBron&rsquo;s 66 win team in the process to get there. Dwight in his prime was a total monster. Just an absolute mismatch and best defender in the League to where it wasn&rsquo;t particularly close.</p>

      <label for="lhuxb29" class="commentText"><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t really count Olympic play against any player to be honest. And we&rsquo;re talking primes, of which AD is past his in this years Olympics. Dwight obviously has much better rebounding numbers but the difference is at their peaks AD was grabbing 12 and Dwight was grabbing 15, and AD&rsquo;s play style naturally took him away from the basket more.</p>

<p>And AD has also arguably been the best defender in the league for a bit amongst a much tougher playing field. If we&rsquo;re going peak for peak, Dwight is not guarding out on the perimeter like AD was. AD&rsquo;s bubble performance on defense was one of the greatest runs on that end at all time. Dwight was privileged to play in a weak conference in a weaker era when teams were running simpler offenses. Dwight is obviously an all time level defender but he was also a bit of an airhead and I just don&rsquo;t see him navigating out on the perimeter like AD was.</p>

<p>I think the points you are arguing go towards the career of Dwight&rsquo;s being better than the career of ADs, which is a much closer conversation, but if we&rsquo;re just talking quality of player you&rsquo;re really going to pick AD every time except for in niche, match up specific scenarios</p>

<p>And AD isn&rsquo;t banging with ATG bigs nearly to the level of Dwight, not even close there.</p>

<p>I think we&rsquo;re taking &ldquo;bubble&rdquo; too literally, it was an amazing playoff performance just like Dwight&rsquo;s 09 Playoffs were. Both basically on the very end of their variance range. The bubble didn&rsquo;t unlock some secret formula for AD (especially shooting wise) which is why it wasn&rsquo;t really replicated. The rest of your post is a lot of &ldquo;Le Weak Era, Modern NBA&rdquo; stuff that no offense makes it seem like you just started watching the NBA in like 2015 and are super era-biased. I don&rsquo;t see how the East was that weak during Dwight&rsquo;s Magic peak. I think it was the deeper conference then, like were the Melo Nuggets really a tougher WCF opponent than the LeBron Cavs?</p>

But you&rsquo;re right if we&rsquo;re going up against one of maybe the 5-6 centers that have actually been able to &lsquo;bang&rsquo; their way to championships then Dwight is the better call.</p>

<p>And lol &lsquo;the rest of my post&rsquo;- bro I said one sentence on the subject of eras. Don&rsquo;t be thick. Believe it or not the teams someone plays against and with do warrant at least a single mention.</p>

<p>But of course you’d take Steph in this scenario and of course you’d take Jokic. He’s probably like one of the best 10 or 15 guys to ever play. Don’t over think it!</p>

      <label for="lhur9dr" class="commentText"><p>So many people trying to convince themselves of AD or Dwight is just straight up delusional. He&rsquo;s in the conversation for best offensive big ever with Hakeem. Literally anybody else in the lineup can run a 2 man game with him and you are fucked. You can&rsquo;t cheat off anybody.</p>

<p>Dwight is a better defensive center, but that really doesn&rsquo;t matter. Jokic is so much better at literally everything that isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;be a rim protector.&rdquo; Also, Dwight being a 50% ft shooter is an absolute liability.</p>

<p>No he wasn’t shooting jump hooks but he could body anyone into the paint and then dunk it. Once again the whole offense, which was one of the best in the league, was built around pnr or him with post touches for years.</p>

<p>I think AD is a better perimeter defender but Dwight is an all time great multiple time dpoy defender who size would leave no team weakness on the team. For example AD struggles with jokic due to size. Prime Dwight does not have that problem. Also Dwight is one of the freakiest athletes ever in his prime.</p>

<p>yeah he&rsquo;ll get challenged by big centers but cmon now, those skilled big centers will get their number regardless anyway.</p>

<p>in the offensive end, he&rsquo;ll get tons of offensive rebounds, doesn&rsquo;t need the ball and plays through the flow of offense. Basically get his buckets from tip in, mismatches, lobs and transition.</p>

<p>Thw playmaking is covered by Lebron and Steph as the secondary playmaker.</p>

<p>AD can at least shoot at times, though Dwight isnt a bad choice.</p>

<p>My answear would be difrent if you had someone else at the 4, but because its Lebron, then its AD.</p>

      <label for="lhumcdn" class="commentText"><p>Draymond defensively does wayyyy more than defend the best wing. Lebron can for sure cover the point forward stuff offensively, although that’s even more of a reason to also add Dray because if Lebron is taking the playmaking role then you need Dray to cover the screening because no one knows where to screen for Steph and Klay to get them to their spots better than Dray.</p>

<p>But the offensive task aside, you absolutely still need Draymond at the 5 defensively. He’s not only statistically one of the league’s best rim protectors (and has been his whole career), but his processing speed and ability to see what an offense wants to do before they even begin to get into their set allows him to clean up/plug any potential defensive lapse/hole before it even happens. Also, with Steph and Klay, especially, (but also Lebron is his most dynamic at pace) they’re always going to be at their best with a small ball 5 than they will be with a true big that plays slower.</p>

<p>The Warriors have never <em>needed</em> a true big, because it was never the “big” part of the big that brought out the best in their game as a collective, it was having a rolling lob threat. Lebron takes care of that and then some. So, what’s left is needing the defense that a “true big” gives you and Draymond is the best you’re going to find in that respect. His cat like reflexes and his 7’1” wingspan allow him to protect the rim as if he were a 7 footer.</p>

      <label for="lhuwox9" class="commentText"><p>…I know? To which I say Draymond. Steph, Klay, KD, and Dray were 4 of the starting 5 of a lineup that was so dominant it literally has its own Wikipedia page lol. It was called the death lineup (or alternatively, the Hampton Five) and it consisted of Steph, Klay, KD, Andre, and Dray with Dray at the 5.</p>

<p>So in this hypothetical, we’re switching Andre with Lebron, and you say no to that?</p>

      <label for="lhus1dm" class="commentText"><p>Totally fair switch, and any case that argues against Rodman’s inclusion in a lineup wouldn’t hold up. That said, the one added benefit with Draymond that, in my opinion, would still tilt the scale in his favor for me is his fits like a glove familiarity and chemistry with Steph and Klay (and KD too tbh). So, if chemistry and consideration of how the lineup would <em>actually</em> fit/play on the court together are part of the equation in this hypothetical/thought exercise then I’d personally still have to give the edge to Draymond. But, if we’re sticking to a more generalized theoretical lens where chemistry is a lesser factor, if one at all, then I definitely wouldn’t be mad about going with Rodman.</p>

      <label for="lhul6c0" class="commentText"><p>You got enough scoring between Bron/KD/Curry/Klay. You got two great options in passing/playmaking between Bron and Curry. Idk if selecting AD would be the best choice, but I do like the idea of him in a lineup like this, especially in this current era. Like Curry, he is very effective offball so he doesn’t need to handle the rock to be a threat to score. He can also anchor a defense, which he could primarily focus on in a lineup like this.</p>

<p>Davis is also quite switchable and can handle his own in the post or the perimeter if he ain’t locking down the paint. But he’d also be a scoring option too meaning you can’t just leave Davis alone either.</p>

<p>As you mentioned OP, this choice would have this team struggle with real beefy centers like Shaq, Embiid, Jokic. You’d be trading a big body and or playmaking if you select AD.</p>

      <label for="lhumcav" class="commentText"><p>In todays game I’d rather have AD, he’s just more switchable defensively and offers say 80% of Dwight’s rim defense too.</p>

<p>AD’s biggest problem in general is as a number <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> option he just has too many games where he’s a bit too passive or lacks aggression, he can disappear. But at the same time that makes him a really high value complimentary player, on a team full of stars I think that naturally lets him fit the best. His mobility to set screens, and roll or pop, play off those guys without just needing the ball makes him fit best IMO.</p>

<p>The nights his jumper is working would make that team lethal.</p>

<p>Jokic is great for the offense but there&rsquo;s probably a ceiling to how good they&rsquo;d be, I&rsquo;d rather have AD and just never lose a game because who&rsquo;s scoring on this team? They&rsquo;d hold even the modern NBA to 100.</p>

      <label for="lhunpn4" class="commentText"><p>There’s a lot of Dwight love here but I don’t see it. I want to draw the opposing big out of the lane because LeBron’s attacking will be the engine to the offense. For me AD is the easy answer because you’re getting elite defense and a guy who the opposing team has to respect in the mid range and sometimes even from 3. Jokic makes the offense just silly, but you lose a lot on the other end compared to Dwight or AD and at some point you might even benefit from a big who can excel without the ball</p>

      <label for="lhuvnc6" class="commentText"><p>I only think you lose a little on defensive end. Jokic often dusts elite centers and holds his own in huge playoff minutes at elevation.  Aaron Gordon backs him up if needed and Lebron can do that better.  All three elite rebounders so wash there.  Jokic and Lebron on the court both seeing plays and calling them out before they happen would also be insane.</p>

      <label for="lhuxvl6" class="commentText"><p>As great as an offensive monster Jokic is and the shooting and shot blocking of AD is, prime Dwight does everything McGee does but on all nba level. AD would&rsquo;ve been perfect if he wasn&rsquo;t THAT FRAIL. Sure Dwight can&rsquo;t  shoot from far distance but he&rsquo;s not unreliable on offense. They&rsquo;ll just run pick n rolls from the rest of the 4 with him and he&rsquo;ll get alot of points. The only guy that is questionable is Draymond but hey he worked with Bogut, Zaza, and McGee they&rsquo;ll figure something as long as Dwight isn&rsquo;t TOO selfish (everyone needs a little bit of an ego and selfishness, but not to the point of hogging the ball)</p>

      <label for="lhuz4oj" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not sure, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s not Dwight.</p>

<p>Reasons:</p>

<p>Dwight had some significant attitude issues. Teammates tended to hate him, I remember someone (Bill Simmons) compared him to a fart on an airplane. I think he&rsquo;d drive KD and Lebron crazy.</p>

<p>Dwight would also demand post touches, even though he was terrible and turnover prone whenever he&rsquo;d dribble. Dwight was also a meh passer. If he did this on the super team, you&rsquo;d be stuck with a half dozen ugly possessions per game&hellip; Not ideal.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure his best defense was better than peak bubble AD (to be fair, his non-injury Orlando years he was way more sustained and consistent than AD has ever been, which explains the DPOYs). Dwight wasn&rsquo;t any bigger than Davis. He would have struggled more than Davis against Jokic, Embiid, and peak Shaq. With Jokic, his over aggressiom vs prime Jokic would have led to mistakes, he&rsquo;d foul out vs Embiid, and Shaq would put him in the basket.</p>

<p>As for the others: I think AD could do the screen/roll/defense stuff really well without whining. He&rsquo;d be fine as the 4/5th option. Jokic could fit here too. He&rsquo;s a savant, spreads the floor, screens, cuts, him as a hub would probably be the best option since you&rsquo;d have Curry/Klay/KD used to movement and Lebron is an all-time cutter. With AD, you might be a little short on passing since Curry is find, but Klay/KD aren&rsquo;t. ,KD/Lebron also give you enough supplementary rim protection. Even with Jokic, if the team is engaged, it&rsquo;s easily a top 5 defense.</p>

<p>Dwight has never been capable of that. He&rsquo;s a bum compared to those guys. </p>

<p>At the very least, they need someone who plays winning basketball. Dwight&rsquo;s not even close, although obviously they&rsquo;d be just fine with him. </p>

      <label for="lhupsvz" class="commentText"><p>With such dynamic shooters in Steph, Klay and KD, I would like to see Jokic as the center, because of his high level passing. Staph and Klay are dynamic off the ball shooters in my opinion, producing some type of hybrid triangle offense, where Jokic can either score down low, or dish great passes to Steph and Klay, scrambling off screens. KD being the iso killer who will get you a bucket when it&rsquo;s a must need, but I think he would also benefit from a high low game between Steph/Klay and Jokic, as KD could get the pass from Jokic while the defense is so focused on Steph/Klay running through screens. Lebron&rsquo;s amazing passing ability would add another dynamic layer to this offense, it could create some really beautiful basketball in my opinion, not to mention the great defense and decent shooting LeBron would add, and the pick and roll between him and Steph is elite, as we saw in the Olympics. Imagine a pick and roll between Steph and LeBron, and now add Jokic to this, who can score down low or dish great passes to KD or Klay, it would be elite in my opinion.</p>

Jokic absolutely sucks in defence and 90% of his magic happens when he is offensive orchestrator, not only ball-handler, but a guy who is choosing tempo, calling combinations etc, in this lineup he will be heavily underutilized + still will be huge problem in defence. </p>

<p>Prime Howard is maybe more spectacular player than AD, but AD is much more versatile in defence and less dependent in offence. And if your opponent has Jokic or Shaq - good luck with them defending AD outside of paint + switching on KD/LBJ, lol</p>
