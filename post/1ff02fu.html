      <label for="lmr4wfn" class="commentText"><p>In 1993 he was already considered one of the best to ever play the game which is crazy considering what he did when he returned.</p>

<p>Players and fans accepted his retirement but most thought he would return. A lot of players talked shit after he left which probably made him come back lol. I remember Penny Hardaway spoke a few years ago about when he was drafted in 1993. It was during MJ&rsquo;s first retirement and when he returned he was sophomore. Penny was like <a href="https://youtu.be/0StI3lY0gvk?si=nd6BMsyaCw4P1ola&amp;t=40" target="_blank">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the big dawg&hellip; He gonna have to show me&rdquo;</a>. The young guys almost didn&rsquo;t believe how good he was so MJ had to come back and show them lol.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Lz01mKA87Go?si=czxdo_pvyh4t4XnH&amp;t=175" target="_blank">Magic, Barkley, Nique, McHale and Bird talking about the announcement.</a> It seems that the guys close to him realised he was pretty much &lsquo;taking a break&rsquo; for his mental health. MJ&rsquo;s Dad got murdered in July 1993 and he retired in October at 30 years old.</p>

<p>At least initially, lots of press coverage and ticket sales for his games. But he was never really <em>good</em>, so the circus died down somewhat. If he did anything of note, it was on ESPN</p>

<p>Teammates probably enjoyed the bus. He destroyed them in pickup basketball games.</p>

      <label for="lmr7me5" class="commentText"><p>The whole baseball experiment was directly influenced by the death of his father.</p>

<p>After his 3rd championship in 1993, his dad actually said he should give baseball a shot because that was his first love. Then he got murdered a couple of months later&hellip;</p>

<p>Fans just wanted to see MJ dominate at anything he did. I&rsquo;m sure die hard Bulls fans were in tears but the average MJ fan was just happy for him. Those who watched and played baseball knew he was raw and had a lot to learn. Expecations were fairly low and baseball purists were almost offended that a basketball player could just walk into the sport. Some media members thought it was all a stunt and that MJ was never going to play the sport long term. They were kinda right.</p>

<p>I think in 1993 it was actually difficult to see what else MJ could get out of the game of basketball. He&rsquo;d been in the league 9 seasons and had an unbelievable career.</p>

<p>Watch the original Space Jam and you&rsquo;ll get the general consensus on how people viewed his retirement. He was deeply missed but still loved by the masses.</p>

      <label for="lms78oy" class="commentText"><p>As an MJ stan in the 90&rsquo;s, it was kinda sad when he came back and was no longer AIR Jordan. When he retired he was still slashing to the hoop, dunking with his tongue out, do all kinds of acrobatic highlight plays like Ant Edwards today. It was like he retired Ant Edwards and came back Jason Tatum. Still could score his ass off and dunk when he had the space to but wasn&rsquo;t a highlight machine like before.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when he relied on the fadeaway a ton. He could still easily drop 30 a night but it wasn&rsquo;t with as much pizzaz as Air Jordan. Understandable now I&rsquo;m 40 but as a kid then I was like &ldquo;cmon dunk it!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fun story: back in ‘98 or ‘99, my cousin’s HS (Marshall) would have an annual ‘principal for a day’ where a celebrity or politician (local, maybe?) would sit in as principal. So the day comes and it’s a ton of security. I had 3 cousins attending the school at this time - one didn’t go 😂😂😂😂 and it was MJ that was the principal. My cousin was HEATED. I remember the news interviewing a student who was like “ I thought it was going to be the mayor or the President or something boring… but MJ??? That’s bigger than anything!”</p>

<p>Yeah we thought it was over.  Until he didn&rsquo;t make the majors for baseball&hellip; then we thought &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a chance&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like you say, you can see how it changed his game and why he became the midrange king.</p>
