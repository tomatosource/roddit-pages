      <label for="lmr4wfn" class="commentText"><p>In 1993 he was already considered one of the best to ever play the game which is crazy considering what he did when he returned.</p>

<p>Players and fans accepted his retirement but most thought he would return. A lot of players talked shit after he left which probably made him come back lol. I remember Penny Hardaway spoke a few years ago about when he was drafted in 1993. It was during MJ&rsquo;s first retirement and when he returned he was sophomore. Penny was like <a href="https://youtu.be/0StI3lY0gvk?si=nd6BMsyaCw4P1ola&amp;t=40" target="_blank">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the big dawg&hellip; He gonna have to show me&rdquo;</a>. The young guys almost didn&rsquo;t believe how good he was so MJ had to come back and show them lol.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Lz01mKA87Go?si=czxdo_pvyh4t4XnH&amp;t=175" target="_blank">Magic, Barkley, Nique, McHale and Bird talking about the announcement.</a> It seems that the guys close to him realised he was pretty much &lsquo;taking a break&rsquo; for his mental health. MJ&rsquo;s Dad got murdered in July 1993 and he retired in October at 30 years old.</p>

      <label for="lmr7gf6" class="commentText"><p>it was mostly met with dismissive attitude and that he wouldn&rsquo;t make the majors. pretty big side show. i was young but his preseason games were covered by ESPN and such. the hype around it died down fairly quickly from a national coverage perspective once the real baseball season started. some baseball analysts/coaches swear that he was getting used to the curveball and consistently improving, which makes sense given that he&rsquo;s a psychopath and athletic freak.</p>

<p>At least initially, lots of press coverage and ticket sales for his games. But he was never really <em>good</em>, so the circus died down somewhat. If he did anything of note, it was on ESPN</p>

<p>Teammates probably enjoyed the bus. He destroyed them in pickup basketball games.</p>

      <label for="lmr7me5" class="commentText"><p>The whole baseball experiment was directly influenced by the death of his father.</p>

<p>After his 3rd championship in 1993, his dad actually said he should give baseball a shot because that was his first love. Then he got murdered a couple of months later&hellip;</p>

<p>Fans just wanted to see MJ dominate at anything he did. I&rsquo;m sure die hard Bulls fans were in tears but the average MJ fan was just happy for him. Those who watched and played baseball knew he was raw and had a lot to learn. Expecations were fairly low and baseball purists were almost offended that a basketball player could just walk into the sport. Some media members thought it was all a stunt and that MJ was never going to play the sport long term. They were kinda right.</p>

<p>I think in 1993 it was actually difficult to see what else MJ could get out of the game of basketball. He&rsquo;d been in the league 9 seasons and had an unbelievable career.</p>

<p>Watch the original Space Jam and you&rsquo;ll get the general consensus on how people viewed his retirement. He was deeply missed but still loved by the masses.</p>
