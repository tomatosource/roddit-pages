</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Bonus points for finding a season that&rsquo;s not just forgotten, but was overlooked in awards voting that year.</p>

<p>My pick:</p>

<p>08-09 Chris Paul: 22.8 points, 11.0 assists, 5.5 rebounds, 2.8 steals on just 3.0 turnovers, at 59.9 TS% with good enough defence he was 6th in DPOY voting.</p>

<p>He willed the N.O. Hornets to 49 wins and the 7th seed with an injury-plagued starting lineup of David West, Rasul Butler, Tyson Chandler and an old Peja.</p>

<p>By <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/mvp.html" target="_blank">Win Shares</a> it would rank the 16th best MVP season of all time, ahead of every MVP season by anyone not named Kareem, Wilt, Oscar, Jordan, Lebron or Shaq — but he finished 5th in voting that year (behind Bron, Kobe, Wade and Dwight, in that order) and was only 2nd-team All-NBA (behind Wade and Kobe at guard).</p>

<p>And yes, the Hornets lost the first round to a good Nuggets team.</p>

<p>(If it wasn&rsquo;t for this season, I&rsquo;d pick Wade from the same year.)</p>

      <label for="lifcjx2" class="commentText"><p>People talk about Muggsy Bogues and use him as an example to clown the 90s, but the reality is that he would&rsquo;ve been a good player in any era. Most people have no idea how insanely hard it is to dribble against someone that is significantly smaller than you and extremely athletic, it makes every move you do uncomfortable and you start to actually not want to put the ball on the floor.</p>

<p>Sure, if you can get the ball against him on the post or on a shooting position, you will abuse his weakness, but purely as a guy that picks up the ball handler, Muggsy was actually insane. He also had a really great AST-TO ratio for his career simply because it was legit impossible to steal the ball from him and due to him being so close to the floor, his handling was very consistent.</p>

      <label for="liesyfy" class="commentText"><p>Tiny Archibald had a season he was 34ppg and 11.4apg, while shooting 49%</p>

<p>Next highest scorer on his team was 13.5ppg</p>

<p>Only finished 3rd for MVP. Tiny did get more 1st place votes than Kareem though, who came in 2nd. Cowens came in 1st, and has become probably one of the more forgotten MVP winners. Partially because I think he&rsquo;s the only one to end up on 2nd team all-NBA</p>

      <label for="ligjb7j" class="commentText"><p>KC is not that big or wealthy of a metro area (admittedly St Louis also has no team, so it might be able to grab some of that other side of Missouri market too, but probably not).</p>

<p>Seattle metro area is twice as big in population as KC and three times as big in GDP.  Vegas is just as big as KC in population but will always be guaranteed to sell out all extra tickets to casinos and tourists.  San Diego can&rsquo;t ever seem to hold sports teams because it is mostly full of retirees from somewhere else, but it is bigger and richer than KC too.  Nashville and or Louisville could make good arguments.</p>

<p>And of course there are Mexico City, Montreal and Vancouver - which might suit the NBA&rsquo;s expansion needs better.</p>

      <label for="lifbb2g" class="commentText"><p>It was an amazing offensive season but by that point he had almost completely stopped playing defense. I understand why and don&rsquo;t hold it against him, but for some reason a lot of people think that Orlando TMac was the same kind of defender he was in Toronto, back when he was the best perimeter defender in the league and approaching DPOY caliber.</p>

<p>Edit: Hilariously and, yet very predictably, while the replies to other peoples suggestions are commenting on how great of a season that player had. The comments to the Trae suggestion are one positive comment and then three comments trying to invalidate the achievement at the time of this edit.</p>

<p>This season they are moving back to more helio centric Trae ball which I’m excited about because it’s clearly best for Trae/the team, but Jalen Johnson might be able to fill that role as secondary ball handler if teams try to put Trae in jail again.</p>

<p>It did work, when they had actual talent. The Doug Moe Nuggets teams, with Alex English and Fat Lever, were always very solid.</p>

<p>They weren&rsquo;t title contenders or anything - pretty much nobody else in the West was with the Showtime Lakers around. They reached the WCF once, and the Lakers took em out in 5.</p>

<p>His teammate Orlando Woolridge went from finishing 3rd in 6th man with 12.7 points per game all the way up to 25.1 as well, fun team to watch even if they didn&rsquo;t win many games.</p>

<p>Im curious to know more about this. My best guess would be he only shoots from that far when he’s hot to begin with, plus hes probably open that deep</p>

That&rsquo;s 63% TS in an era that was not known for optimizing shooting efficiency. It&rsquo;s just he was stuck on the awful post-Barkley, pre-AI Sixers teams and never really recreated his success. But dude was an absolute offensive juggernaut that season.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s more that he was thought of as a spot-up guy before those years in PHI. In SEA, they ran the offense through Payton and McMillan before they let Barros set the table.</p>

<p>It would be like if Steve Kerr suddenly had a <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> year with good shooting splits. The surprise wouldn&rsquo;t be that Kerr could shoot 3s, the surprise would be all the other stuff.</p>

<p>Or if you want a present-day equivalent, it would be like if Isaiah Joe or Garrison Matthews got traded to WAS and suddenly averaged <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> with 2 steals. We know those guys can shoot, we don&rsquo;t know they can do that other stuff.</p>

Then he went into the playoffs and averaged 30 a game. It was unfortunate they met the Warriors but at least they took a game.</p>

<p>He got recognized in terms of the awards, but his season doesn&rsquo;t really get talked about all that much.</p>

      <label for="lig62sv" class="commentText"><p>Wilt Chamberlain&rsquo;s Rookie season is what immediately what comes to mind. It should be ranked near the very top of all the lists, especially when <em>greatest</em> single seasons are brought up.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>A little context: Wilt came <em>into</em> the league with the most hype of any athlete ever (featured in Time, Life, Look, and Newsweek before 21). He was playing in pro circuits at 16 years old under a fake name of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6cbgx1/wilt_chamberlain_secretly_dominated_professional/" target="_blank">Marcus Allen</a> (scoring 50-90+ PPG in these games.) He was the <em>first</em> nationally recruited High School basketball player (garnering over 200 university offers). Before he even played a second of D1 college basketball, his legendary coach, Phog Allen, said he was the greatest basketball player he had ever seen. During his D1 years, the NCAA and the NBA changed basketball rules because of him jumping and dunking from the free throw line for Free Throws. He left after his Junior year, but was ineligible to play in the NBA because of this. So he became the POINT GUARD for the Harlem Globetrotters for a season.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>And now we finally get to 1959. Rookie Wilt gets selected as a Territorial Pick in the Draft and proceeds to wreak havoc on the league right from the get-go.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First NBA game he drops 43 points and 28 rebounds on 63% from the field. Proceeds to rattle off 5 50+ point games, 27 40+ point games, and <strong>62</strong> 20+ rebound games.</p></li>

<li><p>First Rookie in NBA History to win League MVP (in a league with prime Russell, Pettit, Cousy, Baylor, Schayes, etc.)</p></li>

<li><p>First Rookie in NBA History to lead the league in Scoring (37.6). This was more than 8 PPG higher than the previous scoring record holder (Bob Pettit with 29.2) No other player has ever surpassed this PPG. Wilt did 3 more times.</p></li>

<li><p>Set the NBA record for Rebounds Per Game (27.0). No other player has ever surpassed this RPG. Wilt did once.</p></li>

<li><p>Set the NBA record for Total Rebounds (1,941) in a single season. No other player has ever surpassed this amount. Wilt did in six other seasons.</p></li>

<li><p>Set the NBA record for Minutes Played (3338) and Minutes per Game (46.4) in a single season. Oscar and Tiny are the only other players to play 46 MPG or more in a season, and they did it just once each. Wilt did in six other seasons.</p></li>

<li><p>Wins Rookie of the Year and All-Star Game MVP</p></li>

<li><p>Improved his Warriors win/loss record by 17 games, leading them to the playoffs.</p></li>

<li><p>1st Round: Dominated Dolph Schayes&rsquo; Syracuse Nationals (that had 4 Hall of Famers) by averaging 39 ppg / 22 rpg on 50% from the field.</p></li>

<li><p>Dropped 53 points and 22 rebounds in the close out Game 3</p></li>

<li><p>That 53 point game was the Rookie scoring record in the Playoffs which still stands til this day. No other player has ever reached the 50 point plateau in the playoffs as a Rookie.</p></li>

<li><p>Set the NBA Playoff record for Most Field Goals made in a Game with 24, only John Havlicek and Michael Jordan have tied this record since.</p></li>

<li><p>2nd Round: Took the Defending Champion Boston Celtics (that had 7 Hall of Famers) to 6 games averaging 31 ppg / 27.5 rpg, including dropping <em>another</em> 50-point bomb, this time on Bill Russell/Tom Heinsohn.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I left out a ton of detail, but this is a pretty good summation of why Wilt&rsquo;s rookie season is the most underrated single season in NBA history. NO ONE talks about it. It is mythical.</p>

      <label for="lihlz1w" class="commentText"><p>He played against more Hall of Fame big men than any other center has in any other era. And if his stats were so inflated, why did no one else come close to his outputs? The answer is because he was that great. Individually, no one has dominated the sport of basketball like Wilt did.</p>

That team had 4 hall of famers (KAJ, Magic, Worthy, Cooper), 4 overall number 1 picks (KAJ, Magic, Worthy and Klay&rsquo;s dad Mychael Thompson) plus all-star AC Green. Scott never made an all-star team. </p>

<p>This was definitely pre-prime Embiid, but with arguably best help of his career he was able to put monster numbers at age 24. Advanced stats didn&rsquo;t view him as an elite offensive weapon but he was super athletic, good on defense and was a monster on the glass.</p>

<p>Now we only remember this season because of the Kawhi shot that ended Philly&rsquo;s dreams. Embiid was shut down in that series by his father, Marc Gasol. Appart from that it was a great year for him. He ended up being 7th in MVP voting, 4th in DPOY and got himself onto 2nd All-NBA and All-DEF.</p>

      <label for="liephnl" class="commentText"><p>Kobe Bryant in the 05-06 Season. He had the highest usage ever at that time so people just thought he was a ball hog.  But a Kobe shot was actually the statistically best way to get points on a team with both Smush Parker and Kwame Brown starting.  He probably should have shot more.</p>

<p>Noone up until that point had put a team on his back the way Kobe did.</p>

      <label for="lierpxs" class="commentText"><p>But it wasn’t statistically the best way. This just isn’t true.</p>

<p>Smush Parker who’s often the punching bag in these discussions shot 37% from 3. A Kobe fadeaway into a double team was a vastly less efficient shot.</p>

<p>Kobes willingness to shoot into double teams or shoot poor shots probably helped his efficiency in the playoffs stay the same, but it wasn’t the best way to play basketball.</p>

<p>Smush also was known for not following coaches and gameplans, even if you put him in the corner and only shoot 3s, he&rsquo;ll probably try to do more.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reason he was out of the league the moment he left the Lakers</p>

<p>Well, if we assume that Kobe scored 0.76 per possession on hard coverages like the other guy said&hellip;</p>

<p>Smush shot 36.5% from three while he was on the Lakers , which is 1.095 points per possession, making it 0.335 more points per possession on Kobe&rsquo;s doubles</p>

<p>That means you would need to exchange three Kobe shots over double teams per game to Smush threes to even improve your overall score by one point</p>

<p>Smush shot 4 threes a game in 2005-2006, which means he will need to shoot 7 threes per game to achieve that, which would make him the #2 in the league in three points attempts</p>

      <label for="lifel82" class="commentText"><p>Not all shots exist in a vacuum though. Smush was likely only able to take the type of 3s he was taking because teams understood Kobe&rsquo;s shot tendencies, and while sharing the floor he got better looks than if Kobe were a more unselfish player.</p>

<p>Not that I think Kobe shouldn&rsquo;t have passed more, because man it was ugly but there&rsquo;s a reason for it.</p>

To average 36ppg in the tougher western conference and lead your team to a 4 seed with one win away from 3 with your co star injured and recovering from a bum hamstring all year is pretty impressive. If Lebron had done the same thing the media wouldn’t be able to get off his nuts nor would us Bron stans</p>

      <label for="lihh7nu" class="commentText"><p>Another crazy thing about that CP3 season is that stats were NOT kind back then. The game was a lot slower with WAY less spacing. Guys couldn&rsquo;t drop 25 in their sleep like they do nowadays. Averaging 22-11 is absolutely ridiculous in 2008-2009.</p>

<p>The bubble. The amount of dismissiveness around it as if it doesn’t count is ridiculous.</p>
