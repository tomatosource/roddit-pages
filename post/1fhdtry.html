      <p>My favorite one is KD for KAT plus a pick(s) or young player</p>

<p>-suns grab an all star on the exact same timeline as book who fills positional need and answers their question of “what are we gonna do when kd leaves?” They now have a far more balanced roster and would at least have a long term direction to build around</p>

<p>-wolves answer their biggest questions all in one player; can you play double big in the playoffs and can you win without a second high level shot creator? They would add a non big modern 4 who is one of the best scorers ever, their championship window is immediately open in a real way and they probably have about 3 years to try and win 1-3 chips with that roster, which would be absolutely disgusting( Conley-ant-Jaden-kd-gobert)</p>

      <label for="ln96ywj" class="commentText"><p>I think KD for KAT should happen right now.</p>

<p>Suns officially closed their championship window with the Beal trade, and need to retool. KD significantly shortens the Wolves window, but makes them the immediate title favorite and helps eliminate some of their wonky roster overlap, while still allowing them to play double bigs with Naz Reid and Gobert (necessary against teams like Denver).</p>

<p>Suns get younger and bring in one of Booker&rsquo;s besties, Wolves get older but bring in a top 5-10 player while he still has a season or two of elite play remaining. Make this trade happen.</p>

      <label for="ln98c9g" class="commentText"><p>KD isn’t a top 5 player anymore, and while the trade might help both teams, it’s a huge gamble for the Wolves. If it doesn’t lead to a title <strong>this year</strong>, they’re stuck with an aging KD on his 6th team, an older roster around a 23-year-old Ant, and they’ll have burned their best trade piece. You risk wasting Ant’s prime by surrounding him with players who don’t fit his timeline and are declining. The Wolves could easily end up in an even worse position than the Suns right now. The only way this deal makes sense is waiting until the deadline and seeing if stars like Jokic, Luka, or SGA—or their key teammates—get injured, creating an opening. Otherwise, it’s a massive risk for little reward. I could see Ant being the kind of guy who requests a trade, so I’d do what you can to build with him and not make yourself Phoenix 2.0.</p>

      <label for="ln99fm1" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s tough because just a couple years ago people were saying KAT was untradable, top 5 worst contract in the league, not even worth Julius Randle in trade. If you can get KD for him, even for 2 seasons of elite play, you have to do it.</p>

<p>Right now, this Wolves squad is a top seed in the West, but won&rsquo;t win a chip without another piece to put them over the top. They&rsquo;re already all in (traded all their picks, 2nd apron, etc.), no reason to hold back now.</p>
