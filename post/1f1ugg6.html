      <label for="lk2sip6" class="commentText"><p>People don’t tend to acknowledge it because they’re two of the most gripping seasons of TV of all-time, but Season 3 especially is built on sloppy, gimmicky writing and deus ex machinas. The cousins are lame one-dimensional cartoon characters (and probably wouldn’t ignore direct orders to leave DEA agents alone, but let’s give them that). The entire crescendo of the season is built on Jesse randomly meeting Combo’s murderer’s sister (while dealing drugs to recovering addicts, which is one of the stranger pieces of Jesse’s psychology even given his embrace of “I’m the bad guy” from earlier in the season), which again is fine, coincidences happen. Then Gus, master criminal, “an honest to god businessman who’s been doing this for twenty years and never been caught” has a meet with two street-level dealers at his clandestine compound? I’m sorry, that isn’t happening. Then Season 4’s plotline is entirely a result of the fallout from that, and sure it’s one of the greatest duels in TV history, but it’s pure pulp.</p>

<p>Mike’s rant is sort of redeemed in my eyes by the fact that it was Walt’s pride and ego that was their downfall. Walt insults Jesse’s cooking entirely out of insecurity while he’s ostensibly out of the business, and if he’d just shut up and began working with Gus quietly, he wouldn’t have had to replace Gale after Jesse’s beating because Jesse wouldn’t have the same level of malice towards him.</p>

<p>But honestly, the first two seasons of the show are far and away the best to me. Walt is a more complex character and the moral quandaries are more interesting while he’s actively battling cancer. Once he’s in remission and after he’s killed Jane and has to bury his guilt over the Wayfarer crash (and doesn’t listen to the universe telling him to stop cooking), he’s already basically an irredeemable piece of shit and the rest of the show is Gilligan and co. trolling viewers who still identify with the guy. My other opinion is that Face-Off acts as a perfect finale (which Gilligan did purposely in case the show didn’t get renewed for the fifth season) and there’s nowhere to go after that.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rant, just figured I might as well while we’re deconstructing the show’s writing.</p>

<p>A career chemist like Gale probably would have reached 90% purity which would have been enough for Gus but Jesse took him out of the picture.</p>

<p>Jesse&rsquo;s ability to reach the high purity was purely due to him doing it hundreds of times with Walt.  He might have had a hidden aptitude for the science as well.</p>

      <label for="lk5ublj" class="commentText"><p>Every show in history has plot “holes” like this.  Its why there is a story to tell in the first place.  Overly critical reviews like that can be done for any piece of show writing because the critique itself tries to hammer reality into a piece of fiction.  The only important part of a show like Breaking Bad is the audience feels immersed in the story.</p>

<p>If you go into a show looking for critiques and plot holes, you&rsquo;re going to find them.  Shows with truly bad writing (i.e GoT later seasons) will ruin the experience for audiences that approach the show in good faith.</p>

      <label for="lk5vj68" class="commentText"><p>I hear this criticism of BB all the time, that it &ldquo;became&rdquo; too pulpy or that certain plot elements were &ldquo;unrealistic.&rdquo; The show opens with a half-naked high school chemistry teacher freaking out next to his meth RV. A plane exploded right over Walt&rsquo;s house in season 2 as a direct, convoluted result of his actions. Heck, the fugue state plotline was as untrue to life as anything in the last three seasons. </p>

<p>The great thing about the show was that it was never totally pulp and never totally drama. Even the plot points on the outer edge of believability made a kind of mythic sense: here is our disgraced hero, here is his journey to madness and spite, here is how his life stopped making sense. BCS did this even better, of course, but in some ways was even more absurd.</p>

      <label for="lk26jgz" class="commentText"><p>It kind of depends-if you accept that Gus was able to have Bolsa and a bunch of his guys murdered in his own home in Mexico, without using Mike, then Mike getting rid of the Salamancas is a very risky but viable strategy. Mike would presumably have those same forces to tap, and a war like that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily require dismantling the cartel-you just need to take apart the leadership. It&rsquo;s like five guys, and as we saw from when Mike was considering sniping Tuco in BCS, assassination is well within his skillset. Nacho even comments on how far the shot was, Mike doesn&rsquo;t need to overpower the cartel.</p>

<p>Caruso isn’t on LeBron though. He wanted Caruso to stay, and Caruso was even willing to take a discount. That one’s entirely on Pelinka and Jeanie.</p>

      <label for="lk5rjf7" class="commentText"><p>Idk about that. I mean LeBron wanted them to keep caruso. They didn’t. Wanted them to sign Ty lue. They didn’t. LeBron wanted them to do a lot of things different and they didn’t. LeBron gets blame to a point for pushing the Westbrook trade sure. Outside of that tho not really. Pelinka panicked imo when they lost to the suns when AD was out. That team on paper was arguably better than the one that won in 2020. AD goes down they lose and Rob panics. </p>

<p>I think LeBron  probably pushed a little for more ball handling  to take his load off. Which is why they started getting guys like shroder and Westbrook but outside of that LeBron isn’t that much at fault </p>

The first go at it in 2021 they didn&rsquo;t fully work because of lack of chemistry due to injuries but the second stint in 2023 they really figured it out come playoffs. Obviously he wasn&rsquo;t worth 80 mil but still would have been a good rotation player and that contract would have easily been tradable by year 3 if the Lakers had their eyes set on someone else.</p>

<p>What I am saying is that if Russ to Lakers didn&rsquo;t happen, most fans would just treat it as a rumor and not an actual possible scenario until we MAYBE hear about it from players way later, like in many cases.</p>

It&rsquo;s so hard watching him when he just drives to the rim, jumps in the air, and then tries to make a split second decision on if he wants to shoot or try to find a shooter to kick the ball out to.</p>

<p>I wish him luck in Denver. I&rsquo;m trying to remain optimstic.. it&rsquo;s going to be a big change to the team to incorporate Russ as the ball handler.</p>

<p>Hopefully he&rsquo;s developed some old-man game.</p>

Weeks before the Westbrook signing it was reported that the Lakers FO wouldn’t budge on giving Derozan the third year. The Westbrook trade was last in quality on their list of options that summer and the FO opted to go with that option still because they thought they needed a big 3 to counter the Nets.</p>

      <label for="lk5alh5" class="commentText"><p>And it was LeBron not wanting to play PG that caused them to trade Danny Green for Schroder. I think THT being a Klutch client was probably a big factor in him getting paid over Caruso too.</p>

<p>And LeBron still wanting a PG when Schroder flamed out was then a big factor in trading KCP and Kuzma for Russ. “For everyone talking about us, please keep that same energy.” Unfortunately this cost years where LeBron could have made more deep playoff runs.</p>

<p>I understand he was chasing the scoring record at the time and didn’t want to expend as much energy on the ball, but I think it might have been better for winning if he embraced a Magic type role instead of being a scoring wing without defense, e.g. Dominique Wilkins with better playmaking. If he takes the slight hit on scoring and they roll the 2020 lineup (KCP, Caruso, Kuzma) that might be multiple championships. But I’m speculating.</p>

      <label for="lk235yw" class="commentText"><p>Thank you. Lebron wanted another ball handler and Danny’s age was showing. Getting Schroder while promoting kcp and caruso was a net win. Starters were constantly spotting teams a 10pt lead with javale block hunting, getting a stretch 5 that could defend in Gasol for javale was a net win. Getting trez for the mle was viewed as the steal of the summer and only happened because Dwight rushed to Philly at FA open.</p>

<p>Lakers were 21-6 before Solomon hill injured lebron, and were up 2-1 against phx until the stars got hurt again. Would’ve been LA-Mil finals with giannis dealing with that ankle/knee or whatever. Suns had nobody to throw at him, lakers did.</p>

      <label for="lk2v9w7" class="commentText"><p>Pretty sure that defense was top 5 for a good chunk of that season even with AD and Bron out of the lineup. Our undoing that season was of our two best players, AD came into the season carrying an injury from the previous season and that got further aggravated trying to play through it. That just compounded into so many leg injuries right into the playoffs. Bron was never the same that season after Solomon Hill dove into his ankle. Those two just never could get healthy enough to push on and even then we still had a lead on the Suns after G3 and played them close in G4 when AD was basically playing on half a healthy leg.</p>

<p>That &lsquo;21 team definitely had more going for it offensively than the &lsquo;20 team and wasnt a huge step down defensively.</p>

      <label for="lk3dgyu" class="commentText"><p>Yea they were a top western team in 2020-21 until LeBron got injured by Solomon Hill. Still took the WCF champs Suns to 6.</p>

<p>If they took the 2021 summer to get healthy without big changes, they probably would&rsquo;ve been top contenders again in 2021-22. But tbf they also had issues like the Caruso renewal on the horizon too.</p>

<p>Pelinka actually wised up and did this in 2023-24, by holding the WCF core constant. IMO if it weren&rsquo;t for absolutely baffling lineup and roster decisions after the IST win, the Lakers probably would&rsquo;ve been a dangerous team (although their talent probably would&rsquo;ve capped out at a WCF run again, couldn&rsquo;t see them beating the Wolves or Nuggets)</p>

And what followed was the most injury riddled playoffs ever.</p>

<p>2021 was our best roster since getting Lebron and ad together. If everyone was healthy we were the second best team in the league that year after Brooklyn we had a chance against bc either kyrie or harden usually find a way to fuck something.</p>

Sometimes he is right, like not being put on the top 75 of all time list, but other times you can see how delusional he is. If I was a coach i wouldnt bring him back at this point cuz hes not a guy who will play his role and be happy about it. hes still like play me &ldquo;25 mins off the bench so i can average a double double, lemme get my post ups too&rdquo;. its fun to listen to his podcast</p>

He then sits on the podcast now and acts like he never said those things lmao. Its really funny to watch.</p>

      <label for="lk1pjm6" class="commentText"><p>Danny Green leaving the Lakers was a decent loss, but the common consensus was the Lakers had upgraded their roster the year after the Bubble.</p>

<p>The biggest complaint of the Bubble roster was that everything had to be ran thru LeBron and they got Schroeder to help manage that load.</p>

<p>They traded a pair of rim runners in JaVale/Dwight with Marc Gasol (who was washed, but had infinitely more BBIQ) and Montrezl Harrell (fresh off a 6MOY award, hadn&rsquo;t been truly exposed in the playoffs yet).</p>

<p>Injuries made them lose in the first round, but they would&rsquo;ve had another opportunity to run it back had Schroeder not fumbled the bag.</p>

<p>The Lakers didn&rsquo;t bring back two players from their top 8 from the Bubble.  Green because they traded him for Schroder, and Rondo because they couldn&rsquo;t match ATL&rsquo;s offer.  Both those were understandable moves at the time.</p>

Pelinka had told Howard he was going to be extended an offer and Howard started tweeting he was coming back.  Pelinka told him he hadn&rsquo;t extended the offer yet (because he wanted to sign Marc Gasol first).  Howard panicked, deleted the tweets, and signed with Philly.  Pelinka then signed Montrezl Harrell when he saw the Clippers were going to try to low-ball him.</p>

<p>Things were going good with Marc (after a bumpy start) until he got COVID and was very slow to recover.  Lakers signed Drummond to cover for Marc but that only pissed Marc off when the rumors said Drummond was promised the starting role.</p>

<p>By no means defining Pelinka and he should not even be a GM imo, but let’s not act like front office is the only thing preventing Lakers from another title.</p>

      <label for="lk4hydq" class="commentText"><p>They&rsquo;re right, they could have run it back, in the last decades only the Mavs have dismantled their championship team like Rob Pelinka did and Cuban did that stupid shit because he was trying to get Dwight Howard funny enough</p>

<p>Dwight was still productive in his role which let AD play the 4, they were hard to beat, even before covid shut down the league the Lakers were balling, they had beaten the defending champion Bucks and looked like the best team in the west easily</p>

<p>When you think about how bad Rob Pelinka is at his job just remember the only reason he has that job is because Kobe pushed Jeanie to hire him because he was his agent and best friend and she was completely loyal to Kobe, Rob wasn&rsquo;t hired because he was a Sam Presti or Danny Ainge level mind, he got hired because Kobe told Jeanie he was the right guy</p>
