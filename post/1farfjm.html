      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1farfjm/the_reason_why_tim_duncan_never_won_dpoy_is/"><p>The reason why Tim Duncan never won DPOY is because of Bruce Bowen.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I&rsquo;m not saying it is right, I&rsquo;m not saying it is wrong; I&rsquo;m just calling the facts as they are.</p>

<p>Bruce Bowen was All-Defensive First or Second team from 2001 to 2008.  Like it or not, it creates the narrative that unlike other DPOY candidates, Timmy had substantial help anchoring the defense.</p>

<p>Not only that, Bruce Bowen was runner-up to DPOY voting TWICE.  This creates an argument that perhaps Duncan wasn&rsquo;t substantially the biggest cog in the defense.</p>

<p>So Timmy D fans, here&rsquo;s why he never won DPOY.</p>

<p>For reference Haslem averaged 5 points and 5 rebounds during the Heat two championship runs. So essentially Bynum was giving you Haslem level production with more rim presence.</p>

<p>Presumably chemistry.</p>

<p>Timmy D has kind of shown he wasn&rsquo;t pushed by individual achievements but maybe it was a huge deal for Bowen and kept him locked in</p>

The man was far from dirty. And no Duncan wasn’t a better defender. U could bet Bruce B on their best 2 guard or wing and he would shut em down. Y’all need to stop playing with Bruce B like this #Spurs</p>

<p>The fact that awards are so narrative focused leads to normal people looking back without the context (or sometimes with more context than the media at the time) and being like huh that&rsquo;s weird.

      <label for="llw44iz" class="commentText"><p>Pop encouraged Bruce to keep playing the way he did. it&rsquo;s hilarious when Pop and Spurs fans got so upset at Zaza when Bowen was doing that his whole career</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Popovich said Bowen is being singled out, citing incidents where New Jersey&rsquo;s Richard Jefferson and Dallas&rsquo; Josh Howard sprained ankles after landing on Miami&rsquo;s Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal and Golden State&rsquo;s Mickael Pietrus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did (the league) call them?&rdquo; Popovich said. &ldquo;Did they call all those guys (Dirk) Nowitzki landed on when he sprained his ankles the past three, four years? The answer is no.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So why did they call Bruce? Because it&rsquo;s happened to him twice? Bruce guards an All-Star every night. If he was doing what they&rsquo;re accusing him of doing, wouldn&rsquo;t it have happened a higher percentage of times?</p>

<p><strong><em>&ldquo;The people who cry about it are just frustrated about having to go against Bruce.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;The league is just trying to cover its ass,&rdquo; Popovich said. <strong><em>&ldquo;I told Bruce, &lsquo;You be Bruce Bowen. You&rsquo;re the best (expletive) defender in this league. You will NOT change the way you play defense.&rsquo;</em></strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Stu Jackson is not going to change my team just because he thinks he&rsquo;s doing the right thing.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="llvf642" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s honestly why I do not fucking understand the Rudy criticism, like yeah, sometimes he gets cooked 1 on 1, every player sometimes gets cooked 1 on 1, being the best defender isn&rsquo;t about being a ball stopper its about consistently lowering the opponents FG% by about 5%, that&rsquo;s the difference between an elite tier defense and a garbage one. Every team Gobert has ever been on has had a legitimately good to elite defense in the regular season no matter who the fuck he played with. The dude just knows where to be and is ALWAYS there. Maybe not the best at any other skill, but absolutely the best at knowing where the fuck to be.</p>

Not that a player had to take 10 more shots to get their average. Efficiency &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; everything. The best defenses and defenders make offenses and players less efficient.</p>

      <label for="llvk5xg" class="commentText"><p>Current and ex-players have the same problem way way way overvaluing one on one play and handles, it&rsquo;s why Kobe and KD are many younger players GOATs. If you asked any player that came up in like 2006 who the 5 best players all time were, basically all of them would have had Kobe at 1 or 2 because Kobe could take any defender and score on them. Same shit with Kyrie now as well, they see his handle and think he&rsquo;s a god of basketball, and on a street ball one on one setting they&rsquo;re right, but in complicated fast moving motion offenses your ability to ISO means way less.</p>

<p>Other players are better at being lock down defenders in man situations than Gobert, so everyone claims he&rsquo;s shit, not realizing what he&rsquo;s a god at is defensive positioning, and literally every single advanced defensive stat and defensive team stat backs that shit up. Challenging every single shot is so much more important than being the best man defender. You think Tim Connelly is some basketball moron? The Architect of the nuggets and the first man in 20 years to deliver the wolves playoff wins? That&rsquo;s the dude that thought the Gobert trade was a good idea. Gobert has never once been on a bad defensive team, Gobert has missed the playoffs all of once since he&rsquo;s become a consistent starter.</p>

<p>edit: go lookup any sport where players are allowed to vote for any award or rankings, the choices are almost always braindead almost to the same tier as fan voting. NBA players are the top .00001% or whatever of the population at playing basketball, they are not the top .00001% of understanding how the build or coach winning teams. Half the reason why great players are almost universally mediocre or terrible coaches or analysts(and universally terrible GMs(Bird being the exception that proves the rule). Different skill set.</p>

<p>edit2: Shit the literal GOAT owned a team that always drafted terribly, and always signed terrible players, if that doesn&rsquo;t get my point across I don&rsquo;t know what will.</p>

Not noticing that making 6 3s on 14 attempts, consistently, makes you the greatest shooter of all time. Same shit with defense, Gobert might get cooked, but if he&rsquo;s consistently making teams shoot below their percentages even by a relatively small amount. That makes you a GOAT tier defensive player. It&rsquo;s not about blocks or strips or making them pick up the dribble. It&rsquo;s about consistently making each shot harder than normal.</p>

<p>If you knocked only 5% off the best teams FG% that team goes from being the best offense in the league to being among the worst. That&rsquo;s what great defense is. Consistently challenging each and every shot, Gobert is the best in the league at challenging every single shot that makes it to the rim, whether by his man or by a teammates assignment. He always knows where he&rsquo;s supposed to be, and virtually never fucks up.</p>

      <label for="llwjrwh" class="commentText"><p>I have another post about this, but in short, that’s because he isn’t an elite man defender, there are better defenders for basically any given play than Gobert, what makes Gobert the heart and soul of so many great defenses, especially in the regular season. Is that he’s always where he’s supposed to be, I think he’s easily the best defender in the league from a defensive IQ standpoint. He’s almost never out of position and always contests everything at the rim. He runs our defense and is able to cleanup for so many mistakes or gambles because he’s never out of position.</p>

<p>Do you think gobert played well in the nuggets series?</p>

<p>Do you think his mpg went up or down from the nuggets series?</p>

<p>Who all do you think had more mpg than Rudy in the Dallas series?</p>

<p>Was there any other big man whose mins might have decreased leading Naz to play more?</p>

      <label for="llzarbh" class="commentText"><p>I mean … was he a good defender in the Nuggets series? I suppose, but he didn’t defend Jokic because he can’t match up against him, so KAT took on that very hard assignment. Did Gobert play a role in the poor shooting? Maybe, but I thought a lot of that was perimeter defense and just misses. I know Gobert wards off the paint so that contributes. But also, I look back at how Embiid manhandled Jokic in the Olympics, and it’s clear Rudy can’t defend like that.</p>

<p>In terms of minutes played in the Mavs series, both Gobert and KAT played about the same minutes, both played under 30 minutes in multiple games, different games, but what was most noticeable was Gobert being limited to 26 minutes in the elimination game. The discussion of “bench Gobert for Reid” was a hot one for both the Nuggets and Mavs series.</p>

<p>What I do know is that for other four-time DPOYs like Wallace and Mutombo, it was never a question of whether they should play on a big game. These guys were viewed as stars despite their limited offensive acumen.</p>

      <label for="llzod46" class="commentText"><p>So 1 game is enough to build a narrative? Because Rudy wasn’t playing well in 1 game, he lost his minutes to Naz. And that’s enough to have a whole narrative?</p>

<p>Here’s the answers though. Mavs series. </p>

<p>Gobert 33.9 mpg</p>

<p>Kat 33.2 mpg</p>

<p>Denver series </p>

<p>Gobert 33.8 mpg</p>

<p>Kat 34.7 mpg</p>

<p>So this narrative that gobert lost his minutes to naz isn’t really correct. 1 game in mavs series where they still wanted him out there for defending the final shot. </p>

<p>In the nuggets elimination game he actually played more than his averages. </p>

<p>I haven’t even been a big Rudy fan but an incorrect narrative is an incorrect one and there’s seemingly a lot of that going around. </p>

<p>Much like MVP, the media isn&rsquo;t really factoring individual performance so much as impact on team winning / narrative.</p>

<p>Duncan probably would have won if he was worse offensively like Wallace, Gobert, Mutombo, heck even Marcus Camby snuck one in</p>

<p>Duncan also played at the same time as KG, (who probably wouldn&rsquo;t have won either if he didn&rsquo;t go to Boston in 08).</p>

<p>I agree that he probably should have one (the Camby season stands out as weak)</p>

It&rsquo;s like one of the most important things in NBA history whether fucking Tim Duncan got one more award or not, looking at the r/nba.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s never really even any argument, never anything remotely interesting to say about it, like &ldquo;in this and this play, Duncan did this and this, Ben Wallace did this and that, as you see, it shows&hellip;&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s always just repeating million times on a loop &ldquo;Duncan DPOY has to be, smart man know basketball give Duncan DPOY, stoopid man no know basketball give DPOY to no Duncan bad man thief&rdquo;.</p>

<p>People who were following Spurs with their own eyes every game, in the Spurs organization, in other NBA teams, living NBA every day, did not care about it as it was happening, it was just not a real subject, and 20 years later people who have nothing to say precisely about any single play are totally obsessed with it suddenly like their life depends on Tim Duncan getting DPOY.</p>

<p>Literally Gregg Popovich was saying that Bowen is the best defender in NBA with zero problem, and for keyboard warriors who are so much smarter about Popovich-era Spurs than Gregg Popobich it&rsquo;s somehow become the symbol of evil idiocy to have any possible doubt whether there is any possible angle to say anything else than Duncan was always faraway the 1st player in NBA at completely everything.</p>

<p>Like you guys don&rsquo;t just know better than Gregg Popovich, you present his opinion as something pathetically idiotic like he&rsquo;s a little child compared to you lol. I&rsquo;d love to have this level of self-confidence.</p>

      <label for="llxqfe6" class="commentText"><p>I really think that in general every &ldquo;superstar&rdquo; gets the same treatment in this way. People write similar things about LeBron, Kobe, Shaq.</p>

<p>The visible obsession is that every &ldquo;superstar&rdquo; has to be called the best at EVERYTHING, ALWAYS, NO NEGOTIATION and whoever disagrees - or just sees it as a wide field of discussion that brings nothing interesting just from listing who is 1st and who is 2nd in the world without definition - is an IDIOT. People talk about LeBron the same way, &ldquo;robbed of awards&rdquo; and are similarly obsessed with the awful fact that LeBron James of all people is not appreciated for his basketball performance.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s never about any other player. It&rsquo;s not like a non-superstar could be the best at one certain thing, at least depending on the angle, ever, any moment of history, at any thing. It&rsquo;s always the biggest star &ldquo;robbed of the award&rdquo; that was given to a smaller star. So I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s the main ideology here. Duncan and Kobe are both talked about a lot.</p>

<p><em>When Robinson retired after the 2003 season, the Spurs paired Rasho Nesterovic alongside Duncan in the middle and improved by 4.9 points on defense, finishing with the best rDRtg in the 3-point era (-8.8) in 2004.</em></p>

<p>This compared to a prime defensive orientated team in the Pistons with guys all in similar age at their best and lead by the greatest defensive coach ever in Larry Brown.</p>

<p>Duncan was the reason we were consistently one of the best defensive teams throughout his entire career where as when Ben left Detroit, it was still a power house defensive team. Timmy had Bruce from &lsquo;01 and on and late 30&rsquo;s Admiral. What we are today as a team defensively is still great but a farcry from what we were in the late &lsquo;90s to mid &lsquo;00s and its not even comparable in the post season.</p>

<p>edit: Detroit &lsquo;05-&lsquo;06 - Ben STILL on the team.</p>

      <label for="llvmunf" class="commentText"><p>About the Pistons having a prime defensive oriented team&hellip;</p>

<p>Wasn&rsquo;t that the Spurs of the mid 2000&rsquo;s? Bowen Rasho Manu and Horry were all some of <strong><em>the</em></strong> best defensive players in the league.</p>

<p>You can just turn to the film and see Duncan struggled in the mid 2000&rsquo;s to defend in space. Billups, Nash, Dirk, Kobe, all of these guys burned him when he had to step out in pick and roll or defend them in isolation. Which is just the nature of being a conventional drop center on defense. Duncan was still one of the best defensive players ever.</p>

<p>I think both Duncan and Ben Wallace are over-credited for their impact on their teams&rsquo; defenses.</p>

<p>About those Pistons teams, after adjusting for opponent quality they look like the highest peaking defense in playoff history (going back to 1957).</p>

<p>^<em>OffRtg+</em> ^= ^Teams&rsquo; ^playoff ^OffRtg ^/ ^Opponents&rsquo; ^regular ^season ^DefRtg ^* ^100.</p>

<p>^<em>DefRtg+</em> ^= ^Opponents&rsquo; ^regular ^season ^OffRtg ^/ ^Teams&rsquo; ^playoff ^DefRtg ^* ^100.</p>

<p>So a 110 DefRtg+ is a defensive rating 10% better than opponents&rsquo; offenses.</p>

<p><strong>105.2 Playoff DefRtg+</strong></p>

<p>I think when you pour over the evidence, Rasheed Wallace is by far the most underrated player from those teams. He should have been in the HOF a long time ago. Rasheed had a better career than half the guys from his era who&rsquo;ve already since retired and been inducted into the HOF. He dominated in areas that the box score never adequately captured as a defender and floor spacer.</p>

<p>The Pistons improved into great playoff offenses after 2004, but their defenses declined alongside that.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that the Pistons playoff defenses led by only 1 of either Wallace, be it a young Ben or old Rasheed, had very similar productivity. The Pistons immediately went from a great defense into arguably the greatest defense of all time after pairing Rasheed with Ben, but Ben&rsquo;s DPOY awards seem to have exaggerated the perceived gap in the two&rsquo;s defensive impact.</p>

<p>I think much the same could be said about Duncan and the stellar group of defensive players he had around him. Rasho Bowen Horry and Manu is an outstanding group of defensive players. Look at the Pistons, Billups and Hamilton weren&rsquo;t even really good defenders and they were playing major minutes.</p>

<p>In the interest of parsing Duncan&rsquo;s career, you can look at how effective his playoff defenses were relative to opponents.</p>

<p>Their opponents&rsquo; quality of offense is unbelievably absurd for a 19,145 MP sample size. It&rsquo;s indisputable the Spurs ran through a gauntlet of elite playoff offenses. I don&rsquo;t think you can contextualize how crazy these numbers are over such a huge sample size.</p>

<p>The Spurs faced some of the best playoff offenses ever.  The Shaq/Kobe Lakers, Dirk/Nash Mavericks, 7SOL Suns and Heatles make up some of the highest peaking playoff offenses in NBA history. Those are arguably 4 of the top 5 highest peak playoff offenses ever. The 2012 - 2016 Spurs playoff opponents had a <strong><em>108.2</em></strong> OffRtg+ in non-Spurs series.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Twin Towers: (1998 - 2003):</strong> 107.5 DefRtg+</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Big 3 (2004 - 2008):</strong> 103.9 DefRtg+</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Stagnation (2009 - 2011):</strong> 100.6 DefRtg+</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Wing Stop and Friends (2012 - 2016):</strong> 106.0 DefRtg+</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Yeah, the Spurs&rsquo; defensive dynasty even holds up against Russell&rsquo;s Celtics.</p>

<p>The Spurs worst 2000-2999 MP stretch during this entire dynasty was right after Robinson retired. From 2004 - 2006, the Spurs&rsquo; playoff defense was only in the 61st percentile historically among all 2000-2999 MP stretches. The Spurs defense went through a loudly mediocre period from 2009 - 2011, but they quietly had an even worse string of series against the 05 Suns, 05 Pistons, 06 Kings, and 06 Mavericks. That 4 series run put a big damper on all the great stuff they did on defense from 2004 - 2008. Nash, Billups, Dirk, Kobe, all of these guys attacked Duncan to quite a bit of success.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying Duncan isn&rsquo;t an all time great defender, but I think when you go about trying to attribute credit to him and his teammates, it becomes clear he&rsquo;s obviously not the best defensive player ever. He was an all time great defender but he benefited from the team around him.</p>

<p>Duncan and Ben Wallace were similar level players on defense and neither is the best defensive player ever. The Spurs had a defensive dynasty on the same level as Bill Russell&rsquo;s, but all of these guys had elite or all time great defensive peaks while playing with Duncan: Robinson, Bowen, Manu, Horry, Rasho, Kawhi, Danny, Tiago, Aldridge. Turn on the tape I think it becomes pretty clear Duncan has one of the highest defensive peaks of all time but his movement on the perimeter + the way it narrowed his teams&rsquo; defensive schemes, limited him from being a serious candidate for the best defensive player ever.</p>

      <label for="llx9o5n" class="commentText"><p>Yes I agree with a lot of your points.</p>

<p>You can point to all the great defenders having their game preyed upon that is often forgotten. Hakeem against the athletic front courts like that of the sonics, Mavs spreading the ball around the wolves zone in &lsquo;02 basically nullifying KGs ultra aggressive help D, Manus slash and kick against the detroit especially.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say Timmy is the great defensive player of all time, he definitely has a case for the greatest rim protector (alongside Dikembe and Admiral) but also one of the easiest to build an all time defence around, you can put any sort of big you want next to him and it will produce a good to great defence.</p>

<p>Bruce was a funny one, I don&rsquo;t think he was all that great of a on ball defender as he had too many limitations especially his lack of size in any sense, too small to contest wings well enough on their shots, not quick  enough for guards with a quick first step (nash, arenas), not a great chase defender. He could navigate screens like a motherfucker though and he could funnel just about as good as anyone, he <strong>looked</strong> good playing defence and I think if they could go back he wouldn&rsquo;t get as much time as he did, we lost most of our series due to our lack offence than ever our defence. I don&rsquo;t think he was a top five guard/wing defender for the majority of his time, guys like Battier and artest were a lot better.</p>

<p><a href="https://nbacouchside.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/screen-shot-2022-11-27-at-11.50.47-pm.png?" target="_blank">This is a sort of an updated version of PIPM</a> with newer data sets from <a href="https://nbacouchside.net/2022/11/05/introducing-nba-stable-player-impact-spi/" target="_blank">here</a> sorted for defence.</p>

<p>I do think for a majority of their careers Timmy was a better defensive player than Wallace was in <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of the years he won DPOY. They both had incredible support around them for their primes and coaches willing to scheme around them. Wallace should&rsquo;ve won in &lsquo;04 however and deserved it in &lsquo;06.</p>

<p>Lets compare all of the (prime) years Wallace was on the defensive first team.</p>

<p>Duncan:</p>

<p>2002 Defensive (NPI | PI) RAPM per100 - 3.3 | 2.3<br>
2003 Defensive (NPI | PI) RAPM per100 - 3.4 | 3.4<br>
2004 Defensive (NPI | PI) RAPM per100 - 3.2 | 4.3<br>
2005 Defensive (NPI | PI) RAPM per100 - 3.8 | 3.8<br>
2006 Defensive (NPI | PI) RAPM per100 - 2.7 | 3.6</p>

<p>Wallace:</p>

<p>2002 Defensive (NPI | PI) RAPM per100 - 2.2 | 1<br>
2003 Defensive (NPI | PI) RAPM per100 - 2.6 | 2.9<br>
2004 Defensive (NPI | PI) RAPM per100 - 3.6 | 4.6<br>
2005 Defensive (NPI | PI) RAPM per100 - 1.2 | 2.7<br>
2006 Defensive (NPI | PI) RAPM per100 - 3.8 | 3.4</p>

<p>Tim &amp;gt; Ben NPI <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> times and with prior informed <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> times.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/3NIAabQ.png" target="_blank">Duncan</a> &amp; <a href="https://i.imgur.com/YRhtiKj.png" target="_blank">Wallace</a>.<br>
<a href="https://nbarapm-flask.replit.app/player/Ben%20Wallace" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<p>When you add on that Timmy was also an offensive hub for his team until Manu was given more prominence into that role he had greater expectations on performances; being a two way superstar that he and KG were is just more impressive to me and scales in favour of them when looking at most metrics.</p>

<p>Timmy didn&rsquo;t have to worry about not scoring until his mid thirties and while that was always Ben&rsquo;s job,  not to rain on his effort but there&rsquo;s just more Timmy (and other two ways) had to do and this affects their defensive impact. The metric can sway however; comes down to combinations and schemes in the end.</p>

<p>I agree with your Sheed comment also although his effort was always in question, there is noise with a lot of these stats but by the time Ben left Detroit their schemes had become second nature and easily instilled into new players.</p>

      <label for="llvtc8u" class="commentText"><p>What? No . This is very dumb, op. Dpoy was not as important as it is today. Most of the time it was given to playera who really didnt anchor the offense of the team to honor defensive players. Of course there were outliers such as Jordan but DPOY was really treated so low back then. The Spurs went on a massive campaign with RC Buford telling Spurs PR to have: Tim as MVP, Bowen as DPOY, Tony w MIP,  Pop as COY, RC as Executive of the Year, Malik Rose for Sportsmanship and Community. Social media and being terminally online made everyone crazy squeezing every achievements for all time list and thus DPOY has become a huge deal</p>

      <label for="llwgtg3" class="commentText"><p>I do wonder if Bruce Bowen would even be an average defender in the league if he wasn’t a dirty player. Just like Draymond Green and others, the NBA lets certain players get away with too much because they are marketed as “tenacious” and “physical” defenders.</p>

      <label for="llwsoay" class="commentText"><p>This is so true. You see DPOY level players grab and push against less established stars.</p>

<p>On the flip side since 2004 you see players with the scorer reputation travel, charge and push against defenders almost at will.</p>

<p>It is equally annoying.</p>

      <label for="llzb3gj" class="commentText"><p>I agree that I find offensive stars getting advantages annoying as well. However, I don&rsquo;t agree that it&rsquo;s equally annoying because players are getting hurt and sometimes injured much more often when defenders are getting away with dirty plays. Offensive players travelling, charge and push don&rsquo;t lead to injuries as much imo.</p>

      <label for="llvs8ab" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s never really bothered me because his prime coincided with Wallace and Mourning in their primes plus Mutombo still being elite.. You can argue Duncan should&rsquo;ve gotten it one of those years but you&rsquo;d have to argue against either one of them and I believe Wallace and Mutombo were better defenders than Timmy as Timmy had to focus on offense too. All 4 players were elite, of course.</p>

<p>The year it actually did irk me was 07 as he came in third after Camby and Bowen. He definitely should&rsquo;ve gotten it that year.</p>

      <label for="llwwtz5" class="commentText"><p>No, it’s not just about Bruce Bowen. If Bowen could finish 2nd regardless of Duncan, why couldn’t Duncan finish 2nd regardless of Bowen? If Duncan was truly the primary defensive anchor, he would have earned more DPOY votes. His best finish was 3rd, which shows that voters didn’t see him as the standout defensive player. He didn’t get enough votes because they didn’t believe he was the most deserving—pretty straightforward.</p>

Bowen was a big part of why we have rules like giving shooters landing space now &ndash; he would intentionally try to injure players by doing that.</p>

<p>Assuming both stay healthy, we can see this theory being tested with 2 DPOY winners in the Grizzlies. We have actually seen this last year with Timberwolves and Mcdaniels/Gobert and Gobert getting most of the praise. </p>

      <label for="llv7h0c" class="commentText"><p>You are right. One thing about Tim Duncan is he both doesnt get enough credit and he gets far too much credit. Like after crazy 2003 run he wasnt far and away the best player his teams and even had crazy historic level chokes/poor performances they just get brushed under the rug. Offensively and defensively his teammates just get brushed aside. Center defense is more important than guard/wing defense so  Kawhi and Bowen were always overrated to me but they were still great</p>

<p>I will. One of the greatest defenders in history never winning DPOY is a tragedy.</p>

      <label for="llvfva9" class="commentText"><p>Bowen was one factor, the other is not sucking enough at offense.  Dpoy tends to go to players that suck on offense like Gobert.  Duncan also played his best during the playoffs.  Dpoy is a regular season reward.</p>
