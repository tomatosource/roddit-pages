      <p>Here&rsquo;s a full summary of the situation if anyone&rsquo;s out of the loop</p>

<p><strong>Knicks-Pacers Rivalry</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Knicks–Pacers rivalry is a basketball rivalry between the New York Knicks and the Indiana Pacers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The rivalry started in 1977 and quickly became one of the most bitter in NBA history. They met in the playoffs 6 times from 1993 to 2000, fueling a rivalry epitomized by the enmity between Pacer Reggie Miller and prominent Knick fan Spike Lee. Miller likened it to the Hatfield–McCoy feud, and The New York Times said in 1998 that it was &ldquo;as combustible as any in the league&rdquo;. There is a mutual level of respect for both teams consistently demonstrating effort, grit, and physicality during each encounter.</p>

<p>The rivalry gave Miller the nickname &ldquo;The Knick-Killer&rdquo;. His clutch performances were frequently followed by jabs at Lee like the choke sign, adding fuel to the rivalry. The rivalry was briefly renewed during the 2013 NBA playoffs in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, with Indiana winning in 6 games. The rivalry was then renewed once again during the 2024 NBA playoffs in the Eastern Conference Semifinals following the Pacers upsetting the Knicks in game 7.</p>

<p><strong>Spike Lee and Reggie Miller have some fun before Game 2</strong></p>

<p>The Pacers and Knicks matched up in the second round of the 2024 NBA playoffs. Reggie Miller was slated to be a part of the broadcast team for Game 2 in Madison Square Garden.</p>

<p>According to Spike and Reggie, there was no beef between the two.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“That stuff is two-plus decades old,” Spike Lee told The Post’s Stefan Bondy this week. “There’s no rivalry between Reggie and I. It’s all love. Peace and love. Two grown black men who respect each other.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spike Lee pulled up to the game with two framed newspapers from their fabled beef (one &ldquo;THANKS A LOT, SPIKE&rdquo; and &ldquo;SPIKED!&rdquo; about how Spike Lee&rsquo;s taunts costed the Knicks) and got them signed by Reggie.</p>

<p>When Reggie was asked pre-game how he feels being back in MSG in a hostile playoff environment, Reggie&rsquo;s full response:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to the atmosphere. I know people are like, &lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t you worried about going back to New York City and calling a game?&rsquo; No! I&rsquo;ve owned this city, I&rsquo;ve owned this building, so why would I be worried about walking on out there, right? (laughter from the desk) No, I&rsquo;m looking forward to it, these are two great up and coming young teams, it was a fantastic Game 1, I hope Game 2 is just as thrilling, I think it&rsquo;s gonna be fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/NBAonTNT/status/1788357977381941429" target="_blank">Clip here</a>, he talks a little more about the rivalry and how he&rsquo;s conflicted as a Pacers guy but also someone who really respects this Knicks team, and how he&rsquo;s excited for the next chapter of the rivalry.</p>

<p><strong>Knicks fans taunt Reggie Miller</strong></p>

<p>The Knicks were up 10 with 33 seconds remaining in Game 2, the game effectively over. In celebration, Knicks fans broke out a &ldquo;FUCK YOU REGGIE&rdquo; chant that was loud and clear on the broadcast. <a href="https://twitter.com/JomboyMedia/status/1788397960822128916" target="_blank">Clip</a></p>

<p>A little bit later during a different set of free throws and after the chant died down (and with the Knicks still up double digits), Josh Hart went over to Reggie Miller and said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if you heard but I think they&rsquo;re saying, &lsquo;Fuck you&rsquo;&rdquo; as both have a smile/laugh. <a href="https://twitter.com/awfulannouncing/status/1788397923278926271" target="_blank">Clip</a></p>

<p><strong>Reggie Miller responds after the Knicks are eliminated</strong></p>

<p>Reggie Miller was not on the broadcast team when the Pacers eliminated the Knicks, but he shared his thoughts on Instagram.</p>

<p>Under an image of the Josh Hart - Reggie Miller moment, suggesting that he didn&rsquo;t like it, Reggie wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the series CHANGED!! Jalen Brunson you&rsquo;re a true BALLER, been the best player in these playoffs, but you and your boys can all heal up together on some beautiful beaches in Cancun, please enjoy!! #PacersKnicksRivalryLives #GodDontLikeUgly</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GN-lIg9XYAAXeZ6?format=jpg&amp;name=large" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<p><strong>Later, Reggie Miller further shares his unhappiness with the original incident</strong></p>

<p>Earlier this week, Reggie spoke on the incident in-depth and well, he was not happy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“This is why I cannot stand the Knicks, because, to me, they’re frontrunners,” Miller said while explaining his disdain for the Knicks and their fans. “They think that their God’s gift to basketball. Now that you guys know that you’re gonna win the game. The chants, OK…Should’ve left it at that, and we all could’ve moved on. Where gasoline was poured on it is when Josh (Hart) came over to me…I don’t think — I don’t know what was in his head. But I don’t think there was anything malicious. I think he was trying to be funny.</p>

<p>“But for him to, again, pour gasoline on it…Because all you heard on the mic was him saying, ‘FU.’ So people thought he just came over to me and said, ‘FU,’ which wasn’t the case. Like why am I being dragged into the series? I’m here to work.”</p>

<p>“Well, he shouldn’t have come over and said it in the first place,” Miller added, regarding Hart’s hot mic moment. “But, it is what it is. So…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/NBA_NewYork/status/1800738816459714593" target="_blank">Clip</a></p>

<p>Mark Jackson did point out the potential inconsistency in Miller&rsquo;s frontrunner remark:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Marc Jackson even highlighted the inconsistency in Miller’s argument.</p>

<p>He noted Miller only reappeared to troll the Knicks and their fans once the Pacers secured the series win, then highlighted Miller’s social media taunt telling Jalen Brunson and Co. to “heal up in Cancun.”</p>

<p>“What is so wrong with that?” he asked. “Tell me, what is wrong with that? I am not in the series. I had nothing to do with the series. But then I got dragged into it; I did my job. But again, being frontrunners, there was no need for it. But it is what it is. It won’t be the first time. Look, the thing about the Knicks and the Pacers – they’re both young, right? They’re both young teams, and it’s gonna be years to come, kind of like it was in the 90s. And I very well can see these two teams battling each other, along with Boston, for the Eastern Conference crown.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Jalen Brunson responds</strong></p>

<p>In a 1-on-1 with Taylor Rooks, Jalen Brunson responded to the Reggie remarks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Reggie, you started the chirping. He said the boogeyman is coming back to New York, I own this place… people probably wouldn’t have said anything if you just came there and did [your job].”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Full response from Brunson <a href="https://twitter.com/BleacherReport/status/1801357480494080240" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>He agrees that Hart&rsquo;s an idiot and that he shouldn&rsquo;t have done what he did, but disagrees with Miller that it was a turning point in the series. Says he gets where Reggie is coming from, but again thinks that Reggie brought himself into it.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>The Miller side can argue that what he said was just a brief joke in a monologue where he&rsquo;s giving respect to the Knicks and says he&rsquo;s excited for the series and that doesn&rsquo;t mean he deserved the chant or anything else.</p>

<p>The Knicks side can argue that it wasn&rsquo;t that deep and that he should&rsquo;ve just stayed out of it if he was going to get upset.</p>

<p>The neutral side can argue that none of this shit really matters but hey mild drama is fun</p>

<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s my neutral synopsis. What do people think?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Just know, the Boogeyman is coming back to town to call the game,&rdquo; Miller said half-jokingly during an interview on &ldquo;The Dan Patrick Show&rdquo; on Monday. &ldquo;I am coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll hear the chants, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll hear all those naughty words,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good with that, but I&rsquo;m there to do a job, to call a game. I&rsquo;m sure this will be a great series.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be surprised during the game if I don&rsquo;t hear, &lsquo;Reggie sucks,&rsquo;&rdquo; Miller said. &ldquo;Actually, I&rsquo;ll be a little hurt if I don&rsquo;t hear, &lsquo;Reggie sucks.&rsquo; I kind of want that.&rdquo;</p>

Then they went on to lose the series, so it aged terrible for Hart/Knicks team and great for Reggie. When you the player on the court, what you say and do is gonna get looked at more than a fan or a broadcaster lol. Especially if you lose after</p>

      <label for="l8hzmtu" class="commentText"><p>Yes, he’s a talking head drumming up the game. <strong>for the fans</strong>. He also didn’t have a problems with the fans chanting. He even expected and asked for it in the beginning. Reggie started asking questions once Hart came over to him. And that aged like milk because Hart &amp; co ended up losing. When you a player, mid series, what you do as far as rivalry stuff is going to be treated differently than the fans or the broadcasters.</p>

<p>The Pacers were a 47-win team that year. The Knicks were a 57-win team, far more talented, and the East favorite. The fact it went 7-games was an impressive feat on the Pacers’ end, and much of the reason it went to those lengths is because of Reggie’s heroics.</p>

      <label for="l8i9taz" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s really not. The biggest moment of the Knicks/Pacers rivalry is the choke to Spike, which has taken on so much of a life of its own that most people seeing it don&rsquo;t even recall that the Pacers lost. That&rsquo;s not even me making it up, Carlisle literally showed the team videos of the rivalry before the series started and Haliburton thought it was a closeout game that the Pacers won.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Going back home with a 3-2 lead at the Finals just to lose that and then lose on a flagrant foul and an airball is what most people would classify as choking. But maybe I&rsquo;m the crazy one here and what Reggie was really after was the moral victory, I don&rsquo;t know. At least it makes a cool picture.</p>

Down double digits, scores 25 in the 4th qtr while demoralizing a dumbass fan. It was an unbelievable moment and the only people who would try to deny that are Knicks fans because they’re butthurt about it.</p>

<p>The choke wasn’t a symbol of “you’ll always choke and we’re guaranteed to win the series.” It was a symbol of “your team is choking right now, STFU, Spike.”</p>

<p>Would’ve been amazing if the Pacers had finished it off, but they didn’t. Does not make that moment any less memorable given the stakes and given the crazed road environment.</p>

<p>And one thing I can guarantee you is that if the roles were reversed and it was a Knicks player who did what Reggie did, Knicks fans would still be talking about it today as a lore moment regardless of whether they won the series or not, and Pacers fans would be the only losers desperately trying to downplay it lol</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Can you read? Nobody is denying the choke is part of Knicks/Pacers lore. It&rsquo;s just also part of Knicks/Pacers lore that they lost miserably and that 7-27 airballed the game away and was crying after it was over.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pacers fans would be the only losers desperately trying to downplay</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except the Knicks objectively were not on the losing end lol. That&rsquo;s the point, he doesn&rsquo;t own the building. And no amount of saying he does changes the numbers. The narrative is just more fun than the actual facts.</p>

<p>But again, it&rsquo;s a dope picture. Good for him.</p>

<p>And yes, I can read. Sometimes it’s the messenger’s fault, not the reader’s. Out of one side of your mouth you pretend to acknowledge the choke as deserving of an immortal/lore moment, then out of the other, you’re belittling it and trying to convince people it was meaningless because the Pacers didn’t win the series. Forgive me if the reader isn’t quite sure where you actually stand on it.</p>

<p>Love the little Klay analogy. Why choose to be dumbass? The Klay moment <em>is</em> meaningless because only a handful of people remember it. Comparing it to moment that millions of people still remember and acknowledge 30 years later in spite of the Pacers losing the series should’ve been your cue to abort that one.</p>

<p>Dude, I wasn&rsquo;t alive yet lol. I have zero emotional ties to anything that happened in those series, you might as well be talking about Bill Russell beating the Knicks. I&rsquo;m just pointing out factual information that they lost that series and that Reggie&rsquo;s record in MSG is actually terrible for the supposed boogeyman.</p>

<p>I never called it meaningless. I specifically said that nobody is denying Reggie&rsquo;s spot in Knicks&rsquo; lore from the beginning. That doesn&rsquo;t change the point I was making that the biggest moment of the rivalry is something where the guy who supposedly owns the building left out of there crying in a loss.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>As I keep pointing out, they <em>don&rsquo;t</em> acknowledge that. Because a bunch of people don&rsquo;t even realize that they lost that series. Like there&rsquo;s a bunch of people who don&rsquo;t even know 8 points 9 seconds is a totally different year, they just know the overall story of Reggie vs the Knicks.</p>

<p>Just because <em>you</em> and that little army of Knicks fans want people to acknowledge the Knicks ultimately won the series doesn’t mean people will or should.</p>

<p>People acknowledge and remember what’s important to them. And clearly the message of the basketball masses 30 years later is: Reggie’s choke and 4th qtr display is a whole lot more impressive, memorable, and meaningful than the Knicks eeking out a series win against a team they were projected to dominate.</p>

      <label for="l8idk50" class="commentText"><p>TLDR</p>

<p>I’m almost 40 and some of my earliest memories are Pacers vs Knicks with my bro and my pops. I saw Reggie drop those 8 points live on a blurry 85lb tube tv.</p>

<p>I’m just glad this rivalry is back. Reggie is an idiot in the mic but I have to back him like a brother.</p>

<p>I talked so much shit about the Knicks during the series but it was fun and I gained so much respect.</p>

<p>Love the Brunson vs Haliburton future, Tyrese started off on fire and Jalen finished on fire. Josh Hart now one of my favorite players.</p>

<p>Can’t wait for next year.</p>

<li><p>He absolutely does</p></li>

<li><p>How is that what you gathered from anything said here? Brunson is pointing out that Reggie personally brought himself into the mix saying the boogeyman is coming back before the game started, then Reggie is claiming that Hart started it by saying the crowd told him fuck you. Objectively Reggie started talking first.</p></li>
