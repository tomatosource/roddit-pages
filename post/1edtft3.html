I still remember in high school there was a dude on our swim team who was consistently in the top 5 in the state at the 200 freestyle. One day a loudmouth All-State football player gets in his face about swimming not being a real sport and challenges him to a race. It actually ended up happening and you could tell that the football player did actually know how to swim pretty well and was clearly strong as hell, but after the first 50, his form fell apart and he ended up getting lapped.</p>

Those girls will have all kinds of different drop shots, ball spins and other tricks they can throw at him, even if he gets his racket on a ball it wouldn&rsquo;t  be going anywhere near where he thinks it&rsquo;s going to go.</p>

You can have objectively amazing hand-eye coordination and reaction time, but the spins and angles make it so difficult for an inexperienced player to actually get the ball back without it flying five feet past the table. </p>

<p>The serves and spins are NOT an intuitive and easy thing to get the hang of.  With practice, absolutely.  But if you&rsquo;ve never played with people who really know how to play, not a chance in hell you&rsquo;re returning a single serve.</p>

The guy walked into the minor leagues after not have touched a baseball bat since he was a teenager and hit like .220 against professional baseball pitchers. Sucks by pro baseball hitting standards but it’s actually fucking amazing in reality. In fairness Mike was a great baseball player as a young man. I think he was one of the best pitchers in his state when he was like 13 or something like that.</p>

<p>Hell there is even a quote about his competitiveness in ping pong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They&rsquo;d play pingpong after practice just to do something different. Edwards was awful at first. He&rsquo;d lose to everyone in the building. But then the perfectionist in him took over, and in about a week, he was hitting forehand and backhand shots, putting serious English on the ball. It turns out that in the same way Edwards studies Kyrie Irving&rsquo;s crossover or James Harden&rsquo;s one-legged side step, he was hunting down pingpong shots on YouTube.</p>

<p>Pro athletes pick up other sports very quickly, but some things are beyond reach. Especially if we are talking World Class/Olympic Level.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to recieve a serve let alone get into exchange.</p>

<p>Still Antman is awesome and he is both competitive and humble so I am sure they would be nice enough to give him that one point.</p>

      <label for="lf9rc92" class="commentText"><p>Quick rant about MJ&rsquo;s baseball abilities but people we sorta remember him being ass a baseball, like they remember him being ass on the Wizards, both of which is kinda crazy because he was super good in both cases. His hitting was improving in baseball and he was athleticism made him a great base runner and decent outfielder. He had a path to get to a poor man&rsquo;s Deon Sanders level of player. I have a cousin in Double A that we would be thrilled if he hit that level</p>

<p>The problem with Jordan is the fans nor himself can accept &ldquo;very good&rdquo; when they have always be &ldquo;the best&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s what often makes the end of legendary careers so sad and I selfishly wish more could make the Vince Carter transition to valuable vet role player (though Jeff Teague tells a funny story about Vince Carter being in the tail end of his career and still bothering the coaches to play more even though he&rsquo;s 40 lol).</p>

      <label for="lf9toqr" class="commentText"><p>What?!?</p>

<p>Dude’s OPS in AA was 556. Slugged 266.</p>

<p>116 total bases in 497 PAs.</p>

<p>He was in AA as a courtesy. Should’ve been playing in single A or rookie ball.</p>

<p>He was never going to have an opportunity for a Deion-esque career.</p>

      <label for="lf9yt78" class="commentText"><p>To be fair that was his first full season of baseball since High School. It&rsquo;s a miracle he wasn&rsquo;t hitting worse.</p>

<p>Terry Francona said he was improving and that if he stuck with it he could&rsquo;ve made a legitimate big leaguer at some point. Deion Sanders level though, yeah I doubt that well.</p>

I was more thinking of how Deon&rsquo;s athleticism helped greatly in getting him on base and making him a threat as a base stealer, and that would have been the model for Jordan to followm</p>

No, Jordan was not an amazing baseball player but I think the story of Jordan being bad lacks the nuance of the positive skills he was showing.</p>

      <label for="lf9meuf" class="commentText"><p>imo to get an idea of how good she is for anybody that doesn&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;d go to Adam Bobrow&rsquo;s channel.  He has made content with basically every top table tennis player in the world.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjAIeLHKXfI" target="_blank">He made one with Lily</a> where he challenged her to a match with handicap (Adam started with like 7-0 up or some shit every set where it&rsquo;s first to 11, yes he had that much of a handicap) and even then it took 5 sets to beat her.  And Adam isn&rsquo;t a bad player by any means either, he&rsquo;s 100% better than most random casuals.  And Lily is several levels above him.  So yeah.</p>

<p>I highly suggest watching the videos with the Lebrun brothers, they&rsquo;re some of the best non-Chinese players in the world right now.</p>

She may still beat him if he plays more competitive (if you deepdive youtube before he started regular uploading you find some matches where he plays &ldquo;normal&rdquo;) but one can&rsquo;t really determine his true skill by his show matches.</p>

He was only able to get 4 pts on him out of 12. The USA Olympic player said he probably could only get 1 pts on a Chinese national player if he got lucky.</p>

<p>I am pretty damn good too. I can do spins and counter spins but I&rsquo;m a novice.  I can only get like 3 pts on my friend. If I played you guys, you guys would probably only get like 1-2pts on me.</p>
