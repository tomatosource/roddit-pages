It was so unorthodox to push the ball when pretty much universally you are taught to hold on to the ball and let the defense foul.  Considering the stakes it was pretty nuts, I don’t think I’ve ever seen it elsewhere at least at this level</p>

Caught the defense flatfooted, genius in that the defense wasn’t expecting it but also in that he’s actually so good he can do that.  Risky for sure but sometimes genius does that</p>

      <label for="lopjal7" class="commentText"><p>Or they didn&rsquo;t call it because they didn&rsquo;t see a foul. Is there a replay? That would help a lot to determine how significant the contact was. There is a swipe down from Andre with his left hand. Did he get a lot of ball, or a lot of arm? Hard to say. Doesn&rsquo;t look like a possible foul anywhere else.</p>

<p>By &ldquo;since that would have iced the game&rdquo; do you mean to say the refs were trying to rig it for the Warriors to win?</p>

<p>I thought there was some commentary on the replay where one of the commentators says Kyrie was fouled by Andre. Maybe it was during the portion where Lebron’s was down for a while with the hurt hand, but not sure. Wasn’t finding full uncut last minute videos</p>

      <label for="lop7tft" class="commentText"><p>He was an important player after the Bogut injury so yes. If any player shoots like 10% on absolute open jumpers, your odds of winning are severely low. JR Smith made clutch shots, barnes didnt. Cavs superteam success hinged on JR Smith just as gsw needed their SF to score a bit.</p>

<p>And bogut provided very little offensively. Bogut was terrible for golden states defense I will say. Once he went golden state got a train run on them by kyrie and lebron at the rim. But offensively mentioning bogut is laughable.</p>

Steph and klay played like absolute dogshit. They got mentally and physically destroyed. Steph turning the ball over by throwing a errant behind the back pass out of bounds in the final minutes of a tied game 7 was a perfect example.</p>

      <label for="lopk06l" class="commentText"><p>Exactly. The last 3 minutes of this game was choke-fest by both teams until Kyrie was able to calm down and hit a shot after the timeout. Before that both teams were just standing around and not wanting to take the shot. There was no action or ball movement, just iso ball while everyone else nervously watched. Crazy to think of considering how many hall of famers were on the floor for those last 3 minutes, and Kyrie was the only one who summoned the nerve to hit a shot in rhythm.</p>

Yes, you want to take as much time off as you can, but its still more important to score and make it a two possession game.</p>

<p>The defense wasn&rsquo;t set so he took off, he actually got followed by Igoudala pretty clearly if you watch but he didn&rsquo;t get the call (I guess because of the situation) which would have iced the game.</p>

      <label for="lopfrsa" class="commentText"><p>Obviously I find it quite awesome, he could have scored / got fouled / dished  on both plays.</p>

<p>Without the hard foul by Dray at the end that would have been one of the greatest and most emphatic dunks of all time, because Kyrie pushed the agenda.  Genius is crazy sometimes, it was great</p>

<p>The missed dunk itself is awesome and so is the pass by Kyrie</p>

      <label for="lop711o" class="commentText"><p>They were already up 3 though. I understand trying to ice the game but you burn clock and try to ice the game anyway. Worst case is you miss and then the Warriors have less time to try and tie. If Kyrie misses in transition it’s the same scenario but just more time on the clock. It ended up being the right play to slow it down anyway because LeBron cutting led to FT’s and the Warriors not able to get free caused a take foul and they had basically 1 shot when down 4.</p>

<p>I think the gamble would have made more sense if it wasn’t a 3-on-1 or they didn’t already have a safe lead when they could have burned it down to 6 seconds.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I mean thats the point. You cannot burn the clock out for the rest of the game, you&rsquo;re going to have to shoot and the best outcome is that you score to ice the game. I see value in taking a better shot than preventing the other team 5 or even 10~ extra seconds to make a play but also giving them that opportunity in the first place.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t the logic work in reverse? We want the other team to have less time to score, because that&rsquo;s going to make sure they have a worse chance. So don&rsquo;t you want your team to have more time to score, because if you score the other team doesn&rsquo;t really have an opportunity to counter regardless? Why not favor your own abilities?</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a 3 on 1 because basically everybody on the court was caught up in the momentum of the situation, nobody reacted well; he only had Igoudala to beat on the outside. You&rsquo;re looking it at from the TV angle instead of trying to think from the perspective of the guys on the court I think. Physically there are three back but they are all flat-footed when Kyrie takes off, if Iggy is already moving and stops his momentum around the key area I think he just backs it out like a normal transition score attempt that is slowed down. He was able to turn the corner around Iggy though which is a free lane to the basket. He had to get fouled.</p>

      <label for="lopf05y" class="commentText"><p>I look at it as there is nothing wrong with Kyrie dribbling for a transition layup, he is not required to shoot it but being aggressive in that situation and feeling out a free layup or a possible foul/And-1 is fine. If he turns it over, it could be a much different conversation.</p>

<p>2 possible scenarios: Dribble up and get the last shot or go for a layup. Either way the Warriors were going to get another look with the best 3 pt shooter and Klay on the floor so i think it was a smart decision</p>

      <label for="lopg1cl" class="commentText"><p>Those are all fair points, but I feel like just playing the clock and trying to get a decent shot when it gets down to 10 seconds is essentially what happened anyway and it ended up being the right play. The gamble isn’t without downside, and if Kyrie missed, no other Cavs were around to get the ball. So you’re guaranteeing the Warriors possession on a miss. You would give the Warriors 20 seconds to score instead of 10 and they can go for a quick 2 and try to trap, steal, play the foul game. With 10 seconds it’s much harder to extend the game and you’re sort of forced to try and generate a 3 on that possession, which would have been easier to defend and put less pressure on the Cavs.</p>

<p>Yes, icing the game is obviously good and a 2 possession game makes it much harder for the Warriors, but playing the clock makes it easier for the Cavs. Being up 3 with the ball and 30 seconds doesn’t mean you need to push it or make a risky play. It’s not like a 1-2 point game where the Warriors getting the ball means they can win it. My idea is the safe play, yours is more risky but with a bigger payoff. It’s a difference in philosophy where I think both things can be right.</p>
