If any player shoots like 10% on absolute open jumpers, your odds of winning are severely low. JR Smith made clutch shots, barnes didnt. Cavs superteam success hinged on JR Smith just as gsw needed their SF to score a bit.</p>

<p>And bogut provided very little offensively. Bogut was terrible for golden states defense I will say. Once he went golden state got a train run on them by kyrie and lebron at the rim. But offensively mentioning bogut is laughable.</p>

Steph and klay played like absolute dogshit. They got mentally and physically destroyed. Steph turning the ball over by throwing a errant behind the back pass out of bounds in the final minutes of a tied game 7 was a perfect example.</p>

Yes, you want to take as much time off as you can, but its still more important to score and make it a two possession game.</p>

<p>The defense wasn&rsquo;t set so he took off, he actually got followed by Igoudala pretty clearly if you watch but he didn&rsquo;t get the call (I guess because of the situation) which would have iced the game.</p>

      <label for="lop711o" class="commentText"><p>They were already up 3 though. I understand trying to ice the game but you burn clock and try to ice the game anyway. Worst case is you miss and then the Warriors have less time to try and tie. If Kyrie misses in transition it’s the same scenario but just more time on the clock. It ended up being the right play to slow it down anyway because LeBron cutting led to FT’s and the Warriors not able to get free caused a take foul and they had basically 1 shot when down 4.</p>

<p>I think the gamble would have made more sense if it wasn’t a 3-on-1 or they didn’t already have a safe lead when they could have burned it down to 6 seconds.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I mean thats the point. You cannot burn the clock out for the rest of the game, you&rsquo;re going to have to shoot and the best outcome is that you score to ice the game. I see value in taking a better shot than preventing the other team 5 or even 10~ extra seconds to make a play but also giving them that opportunity in the first place.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t the logic work in reverse? We want the other team to have less time to score, because that&rsquo;s going to make sure they have a worse chance. So don&rsquo;t you want your team to have more time to score, because if you score the other team doesn&rsquo;t really have an opportunity to counter regardless? Why not favor your own abilities?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a 3 on 1 because basically everybody on the court was caught up in the momentum of the situation, nobody reacted well; he only had Igoudala to beat on the outside. You&rsquo;re looking it at from the TV angle instead of trying to think from the perspective of the guys on the court I think. Physically there are three back but they are all flat-footed when Kyrie takes off, if Iggy is already moving and stops his momentum around the key area I think he just backs it out like a normal transition score attempt that is slowed down. He was able to turn the corner around Iggy though which is a free lane to the basket. He had to get fouled.</p>
