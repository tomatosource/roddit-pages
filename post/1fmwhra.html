If I mention Kareem, then someone would caveat it and say “oh it was different back then”. Mention MJ, and you’ll get another excuse. The list goes on and on. Wilt and Shaq for example, they’ll come up with more excuses for them and say “they were never on lebrons level” or some BS like that lol. Can’t win with haters man, they don’t think straight.</p>

      <label for="lodysfg" class="commentText"><p>I really don&rsquo;t have a problem with LeBron or anyone switching teams but with Kareem, the place he was playing for was constantly bringing race issues to his door, so that <em>is</em> different. With Mike, he didn&rsquo;t leave his team to <em>win</em>, in fact he RETIRED as a bull, then came back older, and won nothing - so that&rsquo;s different too. With Wilt, he didn&rsquo;t even win much, and he IS criticized like LeBron, so it doesn&rsquo;t apply. Dude is not viewed as some championship getter - of his 2 rings, he is indeed criticized for skipping town to form a superteam to pass the Celtics. And with Shaq, the Magic actually didn&rsquo;t commit to paying him enough, and then on the Lakers, he got traded. None of your examples really hold water if you&rsquo;re comparing them to LeBron&rsquo;s situation. The other top guys <em>were</em> mostly one team. Kobe, Steph, Duncan, Bill, Magic, Bird.</p>

      <label for="loe6hgo" class="commentText"><p>Let’s end it right here. Kobe, Steph, Duncan, Bill, Magic, Bird, were all gifted with all time great organizations or great coaches. LeBron was drafted from high school to a lifeless organization who had achieved nothing historically.</p>

<p>Jordan learned from Dean Smith in college and then had Phil Jackson.
Bird had the legendary Celtics organization and had a HOF locker room.
Magic had an eager owner who invested heavily and also had LA.
Kobe had LA, Shaq, and Phil, and yet he still threatened to leave.
Duncan had Pop, tutelage under an MVP, The Admiral.
Bill was an incredible winner, but also had Auerbach.
Lebron came from high school and was surrounded by no one who knew anything about winning until he went to Miami. Even his coaches were amateurish. He improvised and figured the game out on his own</p>

      <label for="loee7t2" class="commentText"><p>Why can&rsquo;t it be both? I personally think LeBron is the goat. I&rsquo;m in awe seeing him play at such a high level at this age. He is truly one of one. As a basketball player, I have the utmost respect. But let&rsquo;s be clear: a transcendent player transforming a franchise is objectively cooler than trying to form a super team.</p>

<p>Steph put the warriors on the map. The spurs were a decent franchise, but Duncan was the lightning rod for their dynasty. Giannis and Jokic have done incredible things for Milwaukee and Denver. What did Chicago do before MJ?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible to simultaneously respect the greatness of guys like Bron and KD but also criticize some of their career choices. Doesn&rsquo;t make them any less great. It&rsquo;s just not as cool of a story from a competitive standpoint.</p>

      <label for="lofxx87" class="commentText"><p>“But let’s be clear…” this argument is what separates generations. The previous train of thought was that star players should sit there and take whatever their teams could put around them. Now players like LeBron are saying, “I’m performing at an MVP level, but my front office isn’t. I’m not going to tether my legacy to people who don’t care about winning”.</p>

<p>The Warriors were a fun team in the 2000s who consistently ranked near the top of the league’s attendance. Steph joining AND new ownership changed a lot. The new ownership implemented a ton of creative ideas that helped improve Steph’s durability and also helped changed the league. GSW’s owner bought the team for an NBA record $450 million dollars in 2010, Steph’s second year in the league. If the Warriors were a nothing franchise, they wouldn’t have been sold for that price.</p>

<p>Duncan joined a team with an MVP who was in his prime and had an all time great coach. KG might’ve swapped legacies with Tim had he been drafted by the Spurs instead.</p>

<p>Giannis and Jokic aren’t top 10 right now.</p>

<p>What did Jordan do before Pippen and Phil? He was an elite scorer, but wasn’t winning. Articles were written about how he was a great scorer but couldn’t win. In fact, Jordan didn’t win until the Lakers and Celtics dynasties were over. He didn’t take the league from them.</p>

<p>Who was LeBron’s Phil? Why should LeBron have stayed with a franchise who he already gave seven years to? The best players that they could give him in free agency or trades were a spark plug Mo Williams, an aging Antawn Jamison, and an elderly Shaq.</p>

      <label for="loe8qju" class="commentText"><p>Lol, what you’re describing as excuses are actually material differences. Kareem, MJ, and Wilt all won championships with their first teams. Kareem and Wilt were also traded to the lakers. The only one of those that was at all similar was shaq. But he didn’t really orchestrate a super team. They just hit on kobe afterwards.</p>

<p>Going to miami was seen at the time as giving up and taking the easy road. They do have a point, but I don’t really care that much. It was also a smart move, and if you have enough power to pull that off as a player, that’s pretty cool. But there’s no way around it; it was a historic move that completely changed how star players wield their power. So it was RICH when lebron fans called kd to warriors soft.</p>
