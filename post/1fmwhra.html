If I mention Kareem, then someone would caveat it and say “oh it was different back then”. Mention MJ, and you’ll get another excuse. The list goes on and on. Wilt and Shaq for example, they’ll come up with more excuses for them and say “they were never on lebrons level” or some BS like that lol. Can’t win with haters man, they don’t think straight.</p>

      <label for="lodysfg" class="commentText"><p>I really don&rsquo;t have a problem with LeBron or anyone switching teams but with Kareem, the place he was playing for was constantly bringing race issues to his door, so that <em>is</em> different. With Mike, he didn&rsquo;t leave his team to <em>win</em>, in fact he RETIRED as a bull, then came back older, and won nothing - so that&rsquo;s different too. With Wilt, he didn&rsquo;t even win much, and he IS criticized like LeBron, so it doesn&rsquo;t apply. Dude is not viewed as some championship getter - of his 2 rings, he is indeed criticized for skipping town to form a superteam to pass the Celtics. And with Shaq, the Magic actually didn&rsquo;t commit to paying him enough, and then on the Lakers, he got traded. None of your examples really hold water if you&rsquo;re comparing them to LeBron&rsquo;s situation. The other top guys <em>were</em> mostly one team. Kobe, Steph, Duncan, Bill, Magic, Bird.</p>

<p>Jordan learned from Dean Smith in college and then had Phil Jackson.
Bird had the legendary Celtics organization and had a HOF locker room.
Magic had an eager owner who invested heavily and also had LA.
Kobe had LA, Shaq, and Phil, and yet he still threatened to leave.
Duncan had Pop, tutelage under an MVP, The Admiral.
Bill was an incredible winner, but also had Auerbach.
Lebron came from high school and was surrounded by no one who knew anything about winning until he went to Miami. Even his coaches were amateurish. He improvised and figured the game out on his own</p>

      <label for="loee7t2" class="commentText"><p>Why can&rsquo;t it be both? I personally think LeBron is the goat. I&rsquo;m in awe seeing him play at such a high level at this age. He is truly one of one. As a basketball player, I have the utmost respect. But let&rsquo;s be clear: a transcendent player transforming a franchise is objectively cooler than trying to form a super team.</p>

<p>Steph put the warriors on the map. The spurs were a decent franchise, but Duncan was the lightning rod for their dynasty. Giannis and Jokic have done incredible things for Milwaukee and Denver. What did Chicago do before MJ?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible to simultaneously respect the greatness of guys like Bron and KD but also criticize some of their career choices. Doesn&rsquo;t make them any less great. It&rsquo;s just not as cool of a story from a competitive standpoint.</p>

      <label for="lofxx87" class="commentText"><p>“But let’s be clear…” this argument is what separates generations. The previous train of thought was that star players should sit there and take whatever their teams could put around them. Now players like LeBron are saying, “I’m performing at an MVP level, but my front office isn’t. I’m not going to tether my legacy to people who don’t care about winning”.</p>

<p>The Warriors were a fun team in the 2000s who consistently ranked near the top of the league’s attendance. Steph joining AND new ownership changed a lot. The new ownership implemented a ton of creative ideas that helped improve Steph’s durability and also helped changed the league. GSW’s owner bought the team for an NBA record $450 million dollars in 2010, Steph’s second year in the league. If the Warriors were a nothing franchise, they wouldn’t have been sold for that price.</p>

<p>Duncan joined a team with an MVP who was in his prime and had an all time great coach. KG might’ve swapped legacies with Tim had he been drafted by the Spurs instead.</p>

<p>Giannis and Jokic aren’t top 10 right now.</p>

<p>What did Jordan do before Pippen and Phil? He was an elite scorer, but wasn’t winning. Articles were written about how he was a great scorer but couldn’t win. In fact, Jordan didn’t win until the Lakers and Celtics dynasties were over. He didn’t take the league from them.</p>

<p>Who was LeBron’s Phil? Why should LeBron have stayed with a franchise who he already gave seven years to? The best players that they could give him in free agency or trades were a spark plug Mo Williams, an aging Antawn Jamison, and an elderly Shaq.</p>

      <label for="logklc1" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m really not arguing your overall point.  Nor am I taking away from LeBron&rsquo;s legacy. I literally said he is the greatest player to ever live. I am curious how old you think I am compared to you if this is some generational argument. I&rsquo;m simply saying it&rsquo;s a lot more entertaining from a dramatic perspective to see a player take a smaller market team and turn them into a powerhouse. If a front office fails that superstar, I&rsquo;m not blaming the superstar by any means. I get that optics aren&rsquo;t everything, but ultimately, they still matter.</p>

<p>To go through some of your arguments, though, it&rsquo;s easy to say that the warriors and spurs have great front offices and coaches when we really don&rsquo;t know what it would have looked like if Steph and Duncan didn&rsquo;t pan out the way they thought they would. The greatest shooter and greatest defensive anchor of all time could easily make the argument that without them, there is no Pop. There is no Kerr. They provided unprecedented value to their teams that is hard to quantify. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to say that Pop made Duncan or that the Warriors made Steph. Just because the warriors and spurs were decent franchises, they really didn&rsquo;t have a history of championship pedigree.</p>

<p>Giannis and Jokic may not be top 10 all time (Jokic almost certainly will given his trajectory), but their championships feel a lot more rewarding than a super team.</p>

<p>Honestly, most of your points are fair, and I don&rsquo;t think players have to just stick it out with shitty franchises by any means. It doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that it&rsquo;s just more entertaining when transcendent players help completely turn a franchise around.</p>

<p>People say it&rsquo;s not like this in other sports. Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes would like to have a word.</p>

      <label for="logoqz9" class="commentText"><p>MJ won before Lebron did and did it by staying on the team that drafted him. MJ won 6 years after he was drafted, Lebron after 9 years and he had to go to Wade&rsquo;s team to do it.</p>

<p> After failing to win those 7 rings he promised with the Heat(2 rings was a failure considerig that superteam) he saw Cavs had three first picks in four years including Kyrie and went back to reap out the fruits he didn&rsquo;t planted, like a little bitch he is. </p>

<p>Also i just noticed this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What did Jordan do before Pippen and Phil? He was an elite scorer, but wasn’t winning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again you are such a clown&hellip; What did Lebron do before Wade and Bosh? He wasn&rsquo;t even an elite scorer, he shot less than 35% outside 3ft in his Cavs stint. </p>

<p> League average is 42% btw&hellip; 35% is really, really, really bad. </p>

<p> Chicago was also a small market team that only made playoffs 7 times in 30 years before they drafted MJ and he didn&rsquo;t complained. MJ never asked for anything, Pippen was a surprise for everyone and was considered a worse player than Horace Grant in his first years. </p>

<p> The only big name player they ever  brought was an aging Rodman who was dumped by the Spurs for Will Perdue and they received another player too, rofl. If the Bulls didn&rsquo;t gave him a chance, Rodman would have been waived and out of the league because nobody could make him work. </p>

<p> PS: GSW was a record because valuations were going up like crazy and the NBA teams aren&rsquo;t sold three times a year to keep the prices. Charlotte Hornets was also sold for a record price at the time and they were one of the shittiest team in the NBA. Don&rsquo;t be a hypocrite and take things out of context.</p>

<p>Klay is obviously a great player who would have been successful just about anywhere. Draymond? No way. Steph absolutely made his career.</p>

<p>Acting like those are 3 equal pieces is certainly a take, though.</p>

<p> 37% career shooting outside 3ft, thats so bad i could bet my life savings that he is worse than the average 6th man in the NBA. </p>

<p>Nobody could teach LeBum anything, he shot more than 11500 free throws in his career and he still sucks donkey ass. </p>

<p> Maybe he could have learned to read a book from time to time too, not just fake read and make photos with books opened at first page, rofl.</p>

Kareem and Wilt were also traded to the lakers. The only one of those that was at all similar was shaq. But he didn’t really orchestrate a super team. They just hit on kobe afterwards.</p>

<p>Going to miami was seen at the time as giving up and taking the easy road. They do have a point, but I don’t really care that much. It was also a smart move, and if you have enough power to pull that off as a player, that’s pretty cool. But there’s no way around it; it was a historic move that completely changed how star players wield their power. So it was RICH when lebron fans called kd to warriors soft.</p>

      <label for="loh54ed" class="commentText"><p>As a Lebron fan during that time, never did looked at KD as soft, never did see KD changing teams as a bad move, thunder really screwed that team especially by trading harden just because they didnt want to pay him. But after the 2016 championship and how great that playoff atmosphere, I always wished cavs and GSW kept on fighting like that for the next 2-3 yrs, instead we got 2-3 seasons where we&rsquo;re just waiting to crown GSW.</p>

<p>*Earl Clark is there so this is definitely the Dwightmare years and Otis is scared of losing him just like Cleveland lost LeBron.</p>

      <label for="loj1w0s" class="commentText"><p>Honestly can’t blame Dwight in retrospect. Yeah, he was young and immature but after losing in the Finals you lose in the conference finals and then lose in the first round. Literally every move Otis Smith made after losing to the Lakers made the team worse.</p>
