      <label for="ls0swjw" class="commentText"><p>It was a combination of a lot of things. Partially what you were saying in allowing Joe&rsquo;s voice to hold the weight it does now.</p>

<p>But from a basketball perspective:</p>

<p>Smart was a passable 3 point shooter and a passable playmaker; but White was better at both. We needed to find a way to empower him more, and that was always going to be more difficult if marcus was in the backcourt.</p>

<p>The celtics needed a zone buster and more reliable offensive option, and with Porzingas becoming available, and wanting to get to Boston, Marcus was our best trade piece.</p>

<p>Ironically, I don&rsquo;t think the team anticipated the leap that Jaylen was going to make from the 8to game 7 against Miami to what he did last year. His improved ball handling, decision making, and becoming as consistent of a scorer as he did in the playoffs, was not expected. If we had this version of Jaylen, there might have been more of a debate on whether to break up the core of Tatum, Brown, Smart or not.</p>

<p>It obviously ended up working, but some of that was &lsquo;dumb luck&rsquo; in that we traded away Marcus and then the absolute perfect replacement of Jrue became available afterwards.</p>

<p>I think the real comparison is that Smart was replaced by Holiday on offense. Jrue is just a much better player on offense and certainly a better shooter.</p>

The reason was they wanted Porzingis that bad.</p>

<p>Though there&rsquo;s much less post-play now, the mid-2000&rsquo;s had so many mid big men who spun into nowhere because they never got the timing right</p>

He&rsquo;s a four year college player who was a prolific post scorer. Edey has fantastic footwork and is very skilled in the post. With a lot of one and one players and the lack of post-up play in the current NBA, there probably aren&rsquo;t many players with as much post-up practice as Edey.</p>

<p>The fact they doubted him and said he should’ve been a SECOND ROUND PICK is the most disrespectful thing I’ve seen in a long time.</p>

<p>God damn second coming of Yao and they shitted on him.</p>

<p>I wanted him to fall to the Nets so bad but he deserved to be a lottery pick (should’ve been top 3 anyway).</p>

      <label for="ls1q7j2" class="commentText"><p>Everyone was fine with Chris Paul getting All-NBA votes off the back of &ldquo;leadership&rdquo; but Smart is without a doubt one of the best leaders in the NBA. He&rsquo;s a good player in his own right, but part of his value is behind closed doors.</p>

<p>And as their team tries to reset after so much downtime, this is something Memphis fans will likely see first hand, mostly on the defensive end.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s going to set the tone, he&rsquo;s going to raise the intensity of practices, he&rsquo;s going to challenge guys to be better, and he&rsquo;s going to teach guys how to be better.</p>

<p>When people talk about Boston&rsquo;s defensive lineups having no weaknesses, it&rsquo;s partly the roster management, it&rsquo;s partly the coaching, it&rsquo;s also partly the fact that most of our young guys had Smart barking in their ear from day one.</p>

<p>Our rookies didn&rsquo;t get the luxury of being 1-way players hidden in the defence. You dive for a ball, Smart&rsquo;s the first one to pick you up. You miss an assignment, Smart&rsquo;s the first one to to call you out. You want to work on your game, Smart&rsquo;s the first one to give you advice.</p>

<p>Like Holiday&rsquo;s a great defender, but he&rsquo;s not reworking the team environment the way Smart did. When he first came to Boston he was shocked because everyone played defence.</p>

<p>When you look at our roster, it&rsquo;s:</p>

<ul>
<li>Guys who developed under Smart (Tatum, Brown, Pritchard, Hauser).</li>
<li>Guys who were brought in to fit into that culture Smart helped create (Horford, White, Porzingis, Holiday).</li>
</ul>

<p>We&rsquo;re in such a strong position right now because we have that foundation and we were able to add like-minded players into that mix.</p>

<p>Yeah, maybe Marcus Smart will be a great coach, I don’t know. But this is BB 101.</p>

      <label for="ls17d2n" class="commentText"><p>I mean, it&rsquo;s also possible he never did because he didn&rsquo;t need to. The competition at high school and college level isn&rsquo;t the same so he would just need to rely on his height. Lots of players come into the NBA pretty raw or with a limited bag because they relied on their athletic ability or physical advantages.. and then they get to the NBA where everyone has the same athletic or physical abilities so now they&rsquo;re forced to development some skill sets that will give them an advantage.</p>

      <label for="ls1czel" class="commentText"><p>Edey had a post spin move in college, but he really didn&rsquo;t have a bump spin.  With his size, a bump move would have gotten called as an offensive foul, so he mostly used pressure to back his man down then spin when he got to his spot.</p>

<p>But I love that he is listening and taking all the advice he can get,</p>
