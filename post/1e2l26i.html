<p>Hakeem was older too but still MVP-caliber, and Robinson won MVP in 95.</p>

<p>Shaq was obviously the most untradeable player in the league in 95, ORL would never give him up for just Pippen. Even trading him for Hakeem would&rsquo;ve been idiotic, given the age difference.</p>

<p>Makes it even dumber that ORL low-balled him in 96. Probably the worst move in NBA FA history.</p>

It was heavily rumored that the whole previous season Shaq was going to the Lakers and there was even talk (probably true) that the Lakers had tampered, essentially secretly agreeing to a deal months before FA season started.</p>

<p>For a few days, Shaq appeared to be ready to stay in Orlando before abruptly signing with the Lakers. There was a thought at the time that he was merely pretending to be interested in re-signing as a way of keeping the Lakers from being investigated for tampering.</p>

<p>Shaq was Rookie of the year averaging 24pts 14rbs and 3.5 blocks.</p>

<p>The very next year he leads the league in FG% averaging 30pts.</p>

<p>The following year he lead the league in scoring. That is the 94-95 season. Where he also lead his team to the NBA Finals.</p>

<p>Calling Shaq overrated and acting like the Lakers produced the monster we all know like he was some  diamond in the rough is laughable.</p>

<p>Don’t people know anything about their team’s own greats. Not only was Shaq a top player for 4 years in Orlando, but he was a top player in LA for 3 seasons before winning it all in 99-00.</p>

<p>Shaq was an elite player for all of his Orlando and LA years.  He was also MVP runner up in his first season in Miami.  And then all NBA first team the season after that.</p>

      <label for="ld2uum5" class="commentText"><p>Actually more like styles don&rsquo;t mesh well.  Ewing was a half court player who wasn&rsquo;t all that mobile.  Didn&rsquo;t really have much beyeond a post game and mid range jumper.  Pippen provided the bulls with something they lacked previously and that was another on ball defender and disrupter in defense which limited iso opportunities.  Not saying Ewing was bad, but just that he takes more then he gives back with taking Pippen off that team.   Now if you paired Pippen with Ewing on the other hand that would be interesting.  Because the offense would flow more smoothly then with Jordan given the playstyles involved.</p>

He was a third option with a post heavy offense and wasn’t having fun in his words. So his scoring dipped. He criticized his teammates especially Barkley he called him a fat loser. The Rockets tried to accomqdate for Pippen and played more triangle sets for him. Barkley before the year took a massive pay cut so Pippen would come because Barkley wanted a title badly. He openly wanted to join Phil Jackson and the Lakers with a young Kobe and Shaq. He just was unpleasant, declining, and an asshole.</p>

<p>Edit: he also was caught drunk driving in the middle of the year, and the Rockets were upset by a young Lakers team in the first round</p>

<p>And when I say he was an all time great, I mean that. He kept the bulls in contention, he led them to like 55-26 or something like that in a very tough east (pacers, Orlando, Knicks). His skills would translate easily to current day.</p>

<p>Scottie and other players got nice contracts after the championship teams were broken up. I believe people have pointed out Scottie has more career contract earnings than Jordan.</p>

<p>It was a longer deal as well, he really only regretted it after the first few championships. He got his money in Portland anyways.</p>

      <label for="ld2yn2t" class="commentText"><p>Okay, but he went and took a shitty situation and turned it into a 30 foot pile of rhino-shit. Pippen continually shot himself in the foot at every turn while having people advise him otherwise. Then, when he got to the end of his career and looked back he realized he&rsquo;d cut off both his legs in an attempt to prop himself up. Now he blames the people around him for not protecting him from himself and acts like he&rsquo;d been wronged by the universe.</p>

<p>If he wasn&rsquo;t such a bitter prick things would have gone better for him, which in turn would also help him not turn into a bitter prick. People eat up Pippen shitting on Jordan because people want to shit on Jordan but 95% of Pippen&rsquo;s missteps were entirely self inflicted.</p>

<p>the Rockets were upset by a young Lakers team in the first round</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dunno if it was really an upset as the Lakers were the 4th seed and Houston was the 5th seed. They had the same record though, but LA had the tiebreaker.</p>

<p>Also, Pippen didn&rsquo;t want to join Phil Jackson on the Lakers until after that one season in Houston, as Phil wasn&rsquo;t with the Lakers that year, that was the Kurt Rambis year. Funny though that Pippen left the Bulls and then was eliminated by the Lakers for the next 4 straight seasons.</p>

<p>Eternally grateful for Scottie, the Bulls do not win chips without him, MJ is still a dude who can&rsquo;t win the big one if Pip doesn&rsquo;t become Pip.</p>

<p>Having said that I saw enough in that season to know Scottie is NOT that guy and never will be. Not when you need him to be.</p>

<p>MJ is the biggest world class dick in history, but MJ&rsquo;s version of harsh leadership worked and Scottie could not lead a team out of a paper bag.</p>

<p>That is why MJ’s the GOAT, his ability to take on everybody and give them championships. Whether you’re abit lazy in nature like Pippen or wild like Rodman or soft like Luc Longley, you’ll give your best under MJ.</p>

<p>ofc they didnt get to play all too often but that might be why jordan respects him as a player so much. also could be because he was drafted higher or just because they were peers throughout college both highly rated players and teams</p>

<p>Hakeem had a 13-10 record against Jordan and went 5-1 against him during the Bulls first three-peat from &lsquo;91-93. The truth is that we&rsquo;ll never know who would have won if they&rsquo;d met in the playoffs, but those are the facts we have.</p>

      <label for="ld2opbl" class="commentText"><p>I agree a bit as Bill is my favorite player, but these guys are just more well rounded than any previous generations, and that&rsquo;s more progression of the game more than anything. That&rsquo;s what makes goat conversations hard for me, because Bill and Jordan can only play with what others had learned up to that point, if they both had three-point lines there entire lives growing up I&rsquo;m sure they would have shot a bunch more threes growing up, but it either wasn&rsquo;t a thing or wasn&rsquo;t nearly the emphasis it is now. And I do think guys from specific generations are better at certain techniques, especially ones that have been lost (or have been phased out) to time / evolution, but also they usually just don&rsquo;t work as well as in this era, such as the triple threat or the bank shot, great moves but their efficiency in today&rsquo;s game because they are difficult, usually take time to set up, and have only a little better chance of going in than a 3.</p>

<p>It really depends on (in respective to GOAT discussions) if you value guys who dominated their era, or guys who maybe, might, possibly have a chance of changing their game a specific way to go with the times. Just from the fact that we can&rsquo;t ever really know I wouldn&rsquo;t put too much attention on when people don&rsquo;t understand because it&rsquo;s understandable, they probably weren&rsquo;t around for it, so no reason to blame them for their opinions, just gotta set them straight&hellip; Nicely lol</p>

I think a lot of people just see him purely as Robin to MJ&rsquo;s Batman, but aside from being the best &ldquo;Robin&rdquo; any Robin could possibly be, Scottie was a legitimately great player in his own right.</p>

<p>And if they just meant exclusively on the defensive end you still have guys like Tony Allen who have a real claim, and Kawhi is still in that conversation as well.</p>

      <label for="ld3534z" class="commentText"><p>There are definitely other guys who can make a case as defensive wings. They usually just didn&rsquo;t have the other skills. Kawhi at his defensive peak was probably the closest all around. But he probably wasn&rsquo;t <em>quite</em> the offensive player Pippen was when he was at that defensive peak. He also was just flat out better offensively/as a player at his peak.</p>

<p>But guys like Sidney Moncrief definitely have a case in terms of defense.</p>

<p>Still, it&rsquo;s a short list.</p>

<p><strong>Michael Jordan, December 18, 1995:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s Scottie Pippen&rsquo;s team. He&rsquo;s made unbelievable strides. There used to be inconsistency in his game that people criticized. But now, he&rsquo;s got to be one of the best players in the game, if not the best.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Chris Webber, Washington Bullets player, March 19, 1995:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>He&rsquo;s the best player in the league, it&rsquo;s that simple. He makes them go. He checked me all night.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Doug Collins, Pistons coach, December 30, 1995:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Scottie Pippen is the best player in the NBA right now. Aside from my guys, if there were a player I&rsquo;d pay to see play, it would be Scottie Pippen.</p>

      <label for="ld2i9as" class="commentText"><p>Man, Klutch Sports really digging deep into basketball history to try and diminish Jordan&rsquo;s legacy. Here they&rsquo;re trying to make his teammates sound like they were as good as the all time greats of the day. Pippen wasn&rsquo;t anywhere close to the level of Hakeem, let&rsquo;s stop this nonsense right now. Kids will believe these stories, and that&rsquo;s what Klutch want, they want to shift the narrative for the younger, more gullible generation who don&rsquo;t have the knowledge of the game that they perhaps should have so it&rsquo;s easy to mould their minds and create an image of LeBron as the GOAT.<br>
Why would they do this though? What is it in it for them? Well, how about <em>billions of freakin dollars?</em> Jordan&rsquo;s brand his worth multiple billions right now and his status as the greatest player of all time has been a huge part of that. Shifting that mantle over to LeBron would be equally financially lucrative, well even more so given how much more money is in the game in general. We are talking about setting up the company for decades to come after LeBron retires. Anyone who can&rsquo;t see it&rsquo;s a genuine campaign they are running probably needs adult supervision to cross a busy street.</p>

      <label for="ld33twz" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, he wasn&rsquo;t at his peak, but he was still one of the top five guys in the league at worst.</p>

<p>Weird thing though is how people associate a player winning a ring with them being at their peak. For instance, people do it all the time with Isiah Thomas. He had noticeably declined by the time they won their rings.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d argue that Jordan&rsquo;s actual highest peak was before he ever won a ring too. The first 3-peat might include some of the peak stretch, but the absolute best MJ was probably the two preceding seasons.</p>

Plugging in Jordan at the end of the season, rearranging the pecking order and getting a championship would have required a miracle (which never happened).</p>

<p>Besides even if they got to the finals in 95 they would have likely lost to the Rockets. That and the previous years bulls team without Horace Grant would struggle against dominant centers so I imagine Olajuwon and his crew would have won.</p>

      <label for="ld2847q" class="commentText"><p>If the dynasty team actually has a chance of losing I agree. The warriors dynasty run wasn’t particularly fun since the Cavs had kyrie and love injured in 2015, and 2017 + 2018 was tainted by Durant.</p>
