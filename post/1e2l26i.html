      <label for="ld20swu" class="commentText"><p>The main thing there is Ewing was already 32 by 1995, and was declining.</p>

<p>Hakeem was older too but still MVP-caliber, and Robinson won MVP in 95.</p>

<p>Shaq was obviously the most untradeable player in the league in 95, ORL would never give him up for just Pippen. Even trading him for Hakeem would&rsquo;ve been idiotic, given the age difference.</p>

<p>Makes it even dumber that ORL low-balled him in 96. Probably the worst move in NBA FA history.</p>

      <label for="ld2qfop" class="commentText"><p>I don’t know if it was really a blunder. It was heavily rumored that the whole previous season Shaq was going to the Lakers and there was even talk (probably true) that the Lakers had tampered, essentially secretly agreeing to a deal months before FA season started.</p>

<p>For a few days, Shaq appeared to be ready to stay in Orlando before abruptly signing with the Lakers. There was a thought at the time that he was merely pretending to be interested in re-signing as a way of keeping the Lakers from being investigated for tampering.</p>

<p>edit: he had a full squad around him, that had already been to a finals.  The Lakers hadn&rsquo;t done jack shit yet.  They came in with more money, like $20 mil over Mourning&rsquo;s contract, paid the man like the best player in the league, which he was.</p>

<p>Also there’s a good chance rockets could’ve given the bulls a real run for their money if Jordan didn’t retire . Also let’s not down play that mj did still lose in the playoffs to the magic. Saying that mj was clearly the best move valuable player that whole era .</p>

      <label for="ld2uum5" class="commentText"><p>Actually more like styles don&rsquo;t mesh well.  Ewing was a half court player who wasn&rsquo;t all that mobile.  Didn&rsquo;t really have much beyeond a post game and mid range jumper.  Pippen provided the bulls with something they lacked previously and that was another on ball defender and disrupter in defense which limited iso opportunities.  Not saying Ewing was bad, but just that he takes more then he gives back with taking Pippen off that team.   Now if you paired Pippen with Ewing on the other hand that would be interesting.  Because the offense would flow more smoothly then with Jordan given the playstyles involved.</p>

More to do with style then anything else.  Would have matched up with the Jazz because they were more halfcourt but I would put money on the Jazz still with that type of matchup.  Against the others in the west, no.</p>

      <label for="ld37ao0" class="commentText"><p>You are right, you know r/nba doesn&rsquo;t know a thing about basketball when they talk about Pippen as if he was irreplaceable in the 2nd three-peat. He was a MONSTER in the first one, he was at his prime offensively and defensively he was the best perimeter defender in the league, but in the 2nd 3-peat he was not even close to all that.</p>

<p>Pippen&rsquo;s offense in the 2nd 3-peat was absurdly bad, in a third of the series the Bulls played from &lsquo;96-98, he shot under 40% from the field and in 10 out of 12 he shot under 45%. He was amazing in the first 3-peat and complemented Jordan really well in their time together, but there&rsquo;s probably 10 guys in the league that would&rsquo;ve won three in a row with Michael and Rodman from 1996 to 1998.</p>

<p>Shaq, Olajuwon, Robinson, Ewing, Malone, Zo, GP, Grant Hill and Stockton all could&rsquo;ve won in Pippen&rsquo;s place and i&rsquo;m not even including some questionable ones that were bad defenders, but way better than Pippen offensively like C-Webb, Reggie, Mitch Richmond and Tim Hardaway.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually a bit crazy how his FG% kinda dived, it is much like Drexler in the mid-90s and on. They both kinda hit a wall there.</p>

      <label for="ld1so7o" class="commentText"><p>He was pissy for the whole year. Complained how the Rockets weren’t like the Bullls. He was a third option with a post heavy offense and wasn’t having fun in his words. So his scoring dipped. He criticized his teammates especially Barkley he called him a fat loser. The Rockets tried to accomqdate for Pippen and played more triangle sets for him. Barkley before the year took a massive pay cut so Pippen would come because Barkley wanted a title badly. He openly wanted to join Phil Jackson and the Lakers with a young Kobe and Shaq. He just was unpleasant, declining, and an asshole.</p>

<p>Edit: he also was caught drunk driving in the middle of the year, and the Rockets were upset by a young Lakers team in the first round</p>

<p>And when I say he was an all time great, I mean that. He kept the bulls in contention, he led them to like 55-26 or something like that in a very tough east (pacers, Orlando, Knicks). His skills would translate easily to current day.</p>

<p>Scottie and other players got nice contracts after the championship teams were broken up. I believe people have pointed out Scottie has more career contract earnings than Jordan.</p>

Pippen continually shot himself in the foot at every turn while having people advise him otherwise. Then, when he got to the end of his career and looked back he realized he&rsquo;d cut off both his legs in an attempt to prop himself up. Now he blames the people around him for not protecting him from himself and acts like he&rsquo;d been wronged by the universe.</p>

<p>If he wasn&rsquo;t such a bitter prick things would have gone better for him, which in turn would also help him not turn into a bitter prick. People eat up Pippen shitting on Jordan because people want to shit on Jordan but 95% of Pippen&rsquo;s missteps were entirely self inflicted.</p>

<p>I dunno if it was really an upset as the Lakers were the 4th seed and Houston was the 5th seed. They had the same record though, but LA had the tiebreaker.</p>

<p>Also, Pippen didn&rsquo;t want to join Phil Jackson on the Lakers until after that one season in Houston, as Phil wasn&rsquo;t with the Lakers that year, that was the Kurt Rambis year. Funny though that Pippen left the Bulls and then was eliminated by the Lakers for the next 4 straight seasons.</p>

      <label for="ld3ed3m" class="commentText"><p>Pippen was just arrogant by the end of the bulls run. He was so bitter and jealous of attention MJ got and the success they had it kind of deluded his sense of reality. He just couldn’t accept he was just a great Robin. I love Scotties game but the reality is he couldn’t have carried a team as a number one.</p>

<p>Eternally grateful for Scottie, the Bulls do not win chips without him, MJ is still a dude who can&rsquo;t win the big one if Pip doesn&rsquo;t become Pip.</p>

<p>Having said that I saw enough in that season to know Scottie is NOT that guy and never will be. Not when you need him to be.</p>

<p>MJ is the biggest world class dick in history, but MJ&rsquo;s version of harsh leadership worked and Scottie could not lead a team out of a paper bag.</p>

<p>ofc they didnt get to play all too often but that might be why jordan respects him as a player so much. also could be because he was drafted higher or just because they were peers throughout college both highly rated players and teams</p>

<p>Hakeem had a 13-10 record against Jordan and went 5-1 against him during the Bulls first three-peat from &lsquo;91-93. The truth is that we&rsquo;ll never know who would have won if they&rsquo;d met in the playoffs, but those are the facts we have.</p>

<p>Remember the Bulls in 96 swept Shaq Penny ORL.</p>

<p>Regular season in such short samples don’t mean much</p>

<p>Edit: HOU in 1991 beat CHI 2-0 in regular season but then get swept in first round making it hard to believe they would have beat the bulls</p>

Taking this year as an example, the Celtics nearly swept the Mavs, the Mavs nearly swept the Wolves, and the Wolves beat the Nuggets. Does anyone look at that as conclusive evidence that the Celtics would have annihilated the Nuggets? I would hope not. The playoffs are about matchups, more akin to a big game of rock, paper, scissors.</p>

<p>The Jazz also went 3-1 against the Bulls in the regular season in 1997 and 1998, we all know how that worked out for them. The Cavs famously lost a series to the Bulls in the 1989 playoffs after beating them 6-0 in the regular season series.</p>

Insists he isnt the best ever because he didn&rsquo;t play against Karreem, Oscar, Wilt, etc and even weighed in to say Magic is the best PG ever when there was Magic vs Curry debates on TV</p>

<p>Weird thing though is how people associate a player winning a ring with them being at their peak. For instance, people do it all the time with Isiah Thomas. He had noticeably declined by the time they won their rings.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d argue that Jordan&rsquo;s actual highest peak was before he ever won a ring too. The first 3-peat might include some of the peak stretch, but the absolute best MJ was probably the two preceding seasons.</p>

<p>Nothing to argue there, MJ peak was 1988 to 1933.
He was still best player in the league during the 2nd peak, but not as crazy dominant as he was during the previous time.</p>

<p>1st 3peat team had super thin bench, but 3 guys (MJ, Scottie, Horace) could play 40 mpg and do it all on both ends.</p>

<p><strong>Michael Jordan, December 18, 1995:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s Scottie Pippen&rsquo;s team. He&rsquo;s made unbelievable strides. There used to be inconsistency in his game that people criticized. But now, he&rsquo;s got to be one of the best players in the game, if not the best.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Chris Webber, Washington Bullets player, March 19, 1995:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>He&rsquo;s the best player in the league, it&rsquo;s that simple. He makes them go. He checked me all night.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Doug Collins, Pistons coach, December 30, 1995:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Scottie Pippen is the best player in the NBA right now. Aside from my guys, if there were a player I&rsquo;d pay to see play, it would be Scottie Pippen.</p>

Calling Scottie Pippen the best player in the NBA in 1995 at the peak of Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson&rsquo;s powers is probably the most stupid thing i have seen an NBA player do, MJ couldn&rsquo;t properly evaluate NBA players even when he was active, holy shit.</p>

      <label for="ld2i9as" class="commentText"><p>Man, Klutch Sports really digging deep into basketball history to try and diminish Jordan&rsquo;s legacy. Here they&rsquo;re trying to make his teammates sound like they were as good as the all time greats of the day. Pippen wasn&rsquo;t anywhere close to the level of Hakeem, let&rsquo;s stop this nonsense right now. Kids will believe these stories, and that&rsquo;s what Klutch want, they want to shift the narrative for the younger, more gullible generation who don&rsquo;t have the knowledge of the game that they perhaps should have so it&rsquo;s easy to mould their minds and create an image of LeBron as the GOAT.<br>
Why would they do this though? What is it in it for them? Well, how about <em>billions of freakin dollars?</em> Jordan&rsquo;s brand his worth multiple billions right now and his status as the greatest player of all time has been a huge part of that. Shifting that mantle over to LeBron would be equally financially lucrative, well even more so given how much more money is in the game in general. We are talking about setting up the company for decades to come after LeBron retires. Anyone who can&rsquo;t see it&rsquo;s a genuine campaign they are running probably needs adult supervision to cross a busy street.</p>

      <label for="ld2opbl" class="commentText"><p>I agree a bit as Bill is my favorite player, but these guys are just more well rounded than any previous generations, and that&rsquo;s more progression of the game more than anything. That&rsquo;s what makes goat conversations hard for me, because Bill and Jordan can only play with what others had learned up to that point, if they both had three-point lines there entire lives growing up I&rsquo;m sure they would have shot a bunch more threes growing up, but it either wasn&rsquo;t a thing or wasn&rsquo;t nearly the emphasis it is now. And I do think guys from specific generations are better at certain techniques, especially ones that have been lost (or have been phased out) to time / evolution, but also they usually just don&rsquo;t work as well as in this era, such as the triple threat or the bank shot, great moves but their efficiency in today&rsquo;s game because they are difficult, usually take time to set up, and have only a little better chance of going in than a 3.</p>

<p>It really depends on (in respective to GOAT discussions) if you value guys who dominated their era, or guys who maybe, might, possibly have a chance of changing their game a specific way to go with the times. Just from the fact that we can&rsquo;t ever really know I wouldn&rsquo;t put too much attention on when people don&rsquo;t understand because it&rsquo;s understandable, they probably weren&rsquo;t around for it, so no reason to blame them for their opinions, just gotta set them straight&hellip; Nicely lol</p>

<p>But in the real world Scottie Pippen is the greatest defensive small forward to ever play the game and it’s not even close, there is absolutely no way that he is underrated</p>

<p>And if they just meant exclusively on the defensive end you still have guys like Tony Allen who have a real claim, and Kawhi is still in that conversation as well.</p>

<p>But although a lot of people do know that Scottie is a great, I don&rsquo;t think a lot of people truly realize just how special he was&ndash;especially for his time.</p>

<p>I probably shouldn&rsquo;t have used &ldquo;underrated&rdquo;, but rather &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t get the recognition he deserves&rdquo;. I think a lot of people just see him purely as Robin to MJ&rsquo;s Batman, but aside from being the best &ldquo;Robin&rdquo; any Robin could possibly be, Scottie was a legitimately great player in his own right.</p>

      <label for="ld3534z" class="commentText"><p>There are definitely other guys who can make a case as defensive wings. They usually just didn&rsquo;t have the other skills. Kawhi at his defensive peak was probably the closest all around. But he probably wasn&rsquo;t <em>quite</em> the offensive player Pippen was when he was at that defensive peak. He also was just flat out better offensively/as a player at his peak.</p>

<p>But guys like Sidney Moncrief definitely have a case in terms of defense.</p>

<p>Still, it&rsquo;s a short list.</p>

      <label for="ld41xbz" class="commentText"><p>Idk bout the quit on that team in the finals, but he definitely had attitude issues due to his relationship with the Bulls and his insecurities. The Bulls of ‘95 did have issues that Pippen didn’t help but I think the team did indeed downgrade and didn’t fill in the loses that year. Doesn’t take away from how good he was and how you won’t find that many better players than Scottie Pippen. Top 10 is not inaccurate.</p>
