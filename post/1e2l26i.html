      <label for="ld20swu" class="commentText"><p>The main thing there is Ewing was already 32 by 1995, and was declining.</p>

<p>Hakeem was older too but still MVP-caliber, and Robinson won MVP in 95.</p>

<p>Shaq was obviously the most untradeable player in the league in 95, ORL would never give him up for just Pippen. Even trading him for Hakeem would&rsquo;ve been idiotic, given the age difference.</p>

<p>Makes it even dumber that ORL low-balled him in 96. Probably the worst move in NBA FA history.</p>

      <label for="ld2qfop" class="commentText"><p>I don’t know if it was really a blunder. It was heavily rumored that the whole previous season Shaq was going to the Lakers and there was even talk (probably true) that the Lakers had tampered, essentially secretly agreeing to a deal months before FA season started.</p>

<p>For a few days, Shaq appeared to be ready to stay in Orlando before abruptly signing with the Lakers. There was a thought at the time that he was merely pretending to be interested in re-signing as a way of keeping the Lakers from being investigated for tampering.</p>

<p>The playmaking gap is indeed huge, we know this, however, this was a weaker jordan series overall. Quite frankly, the reason the bulls won this series isn&rsquo;t because jordan was better than Ewing, but because pippen was miles clear of starks</p>

      <label for="ld2uum5" class="commentText"><p>Actually more like styles don&rsquo;t mesh well.  Ewing was a half court player who wasn&rsquo;t all that mobile.  Didn&rsquo;t really have much beyeond a post game and mid range jumper.  Pippen provided the bulls with something they lacked previously and that was another on ball defender and disrupter in defense which limited iso opportunities.  Not saying Ewing was bad, but just that he takes more then he gives back with taking Pippen off that team.   Now if you paired Pippen with Ewing on the other hand that would be interesting.  Because the offense would flow more smoothly then with Jordan given the playstyles involved.</p>

More to do with style then anything else.  Would have matched up with the Jazz because they were more halfcourt but I would put money on the Jazz still with that type of matchup.  Against the others in the west, no.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You think a team of Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing doesn&rsquo;t have a chance at the second 3peat?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>was in response to a comment that said</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A tier behind the three mentioned and would be a downgrade for the Bulls compared to Pippen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>if that particular response by you was meant for</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even for centers, Dream, Shaq, and Robinson were the only ones that could&rsquo;ve maybe gotten you that second threepeat</p>

<p>prob wouldve made more sense to respond directly to that comment (which was by a different person) with it</p>

      <label for="ld37ao0" class="commentText"><p>You are right, you know r/nba doesn&rsquo;t know a thing about basketball when they talk about Pippen as if he was irreplaceable in the 2nd three-peat. He was a MONSTER in the first one, he was at his prime offensively and defensively he was the best perimeter defender in the league, but in the 2nd 3-peat he was not even close to all that.</p>

<p>Pippen&rsquo;s offense in the 2nd 3-peat was absurdly bad, in a third of the series the Bulls played from &lsquo;96-98, he shot under 40% from the field and in 10 out of 12 he shot under 45%. He was amazing in the first 3-peat and complemented Jordan really well in their time together, but there&rsquo;s probably 10 guys in the league that would&rsquo;ve won three in a row with Michael and Rodman from 1996 to 1998.</p>

<p>Shaq, Olajuwon, Robinson, Ewing, Malone, Zo, GP, Grant Hill and Stockton all could&rsquo;ve won in Pippen&rsquo;s place and i&rsquo;m not even including some questionable ones that were bad defenders, but way better than Pippen offensively like C-Webb, Reggie, Mitch Richmond and Tim Hardaway.</p>

      <label for="ld1so7o" class="commentText"><p>He was pissy for the whole year. Complained how the Rockets weren’t like the Bullls. He was a third option with a post heavy offense and wasn’t having fun in his words. So his scoring dipped. He criticized his teammates especially Barkley he called him a fat loser. The Rockets tried to accomqdate for Pippen and played more triangle sets for him. Barkley before the year took a massive pay cut so Pippen would come because Barkley wanted a title badly. He openly wanted to join Phil Jackson and the Lakers with a young Kobe and Shaq. He just was unpleasant, declining, and an asshole.</p>

<p>Edit: he also was caught drunk driving in the middle of the year, and the Rockets were upset by a young Lakers team in the first round</p>

      <label for="ld1wcd5" class="commentText"><p>The really tough thing for him is, he really was an all time great player.</p>

<p>But he was overshadowed by the greatest. Who got everything. Every commercial wanted Jordan, not pippen.</p>

<p>And when I say he was an all time great, I mean that. He kept the bulls in contention, he led them to like 55-26 or something like that in a very tough east (pacers, Orlando, Knicks). His skills would translate easily to current day.</p>

      <label for="ld1xi5n" class="commentText"><p>At Pippens best he was top 5 if not top 3 in the league at the time. He never got the respect from the media and the Bulls lowballed him his whole career.. MJ at least is always complimentary and always gives credit to Pippen. He basically said in The Last Dance there is no MJ without Scottie Pippen. At the same time he could such an unpleasant asshole to people.</p>

<p>As much as it sucks, it was Scottie&rsquo;s choice. Could they have changed the contract afterwards? Yes. But it was their policy that they didn&rsquo;t change even for Jordan.</p>

<p>Scottie and other players got nice contracts after the championship teams were broken up. I believe people have pointed out Scottie has more career contract earnings than Jordan.</p>

Scottie just fell for what every other athlete or music artist falls for when they come from poorer backgrounds. He saw money on the table and a chance to retire his family members, so he took it.</p>

<p>It was a longer deal as well, he really only regretted it after the first few championships. He got his money in Portland anyways.</p>

      <label for="ld2yn2t" class="commentText"><p>Okay, but he went and took a shitty situation and turned it into a 30 foot pile of rhino-shit. Pippen continually shot himself in the foot at every turn while having people advise him otherwise. Then, when he got to the end of his career and looked back he realized he&rsquo;d cut off both his legs in an attempt to prop himself up. Now he blames the people around him for not protecting him from himself and acts like he&rsquo;d been wronged by the universe.</p>

<p>If he wasn&rsquo;t such a bitter prick things would have gone better for him, which in turn would also help him not turn into a bitter prick. People eat up Pippen shitting on Jordan because people want to shit on Jordan but 95% of Pippen&rsquo;s missteps were entirely self inflicted.</p>

<p>I dunno if it was really an upset as the Lakers were the 4th seed and Houston was the 5th seed. They had the same record though, but LA had the tiebreaker.</p>

<p>Also, Pippen didn&rsquo;t want to join Phil Jackson on the Lakers until after that one season in Houston, as Phil wasn&rsquo;t with the Lakers that year, that was the Kurt Rambis year. Funny though that Pippen left the Bulls and then was eliminated by the Lakers for the next 4 straight seasons.</p>

<p>Having said that I saw enough in that season to know Scottie is NOT that guy and never will be. Not when you need him to be.</p>

<p>ofc they didnt get to play all too often but that might be why jordan respects him as a player so much. also could be because he was drafted higher or just because they were peers throughout college both highly rated players and teams</p>

<p>Hakeem had a 13-10 record against Jordan and went 5-1 against him during the Bulls first three-peat from &lsquo;91-93. The truth is that we&rsquo;ll never know who would have won if they&rsquo;d met in the playoffs, but those are the facts we have.</p>

<p>Remember the Bulls in 96 swept Shaq Penny ORL.</p>

<p>Regular season in such short samples don’t mean much</p>

<p>Edit: HOU in 1991 beat CHI 2-0 in regular season but then get swept in first round making it hard to believe they would have beat the bulls</p>

<p>The Jazz also went 3-1 against the Bulls in the regular season in 1997 and 1998, we all know how that worked out for them. The Cavs famously lost a series to the Bulls in the 1989 playoffs after beating them 6-0 in the regular season series.</p>

<p>Weird thing though is how people associate a player winning a ring with them being at their peak. For instance, people do it all the time with Isiah Thomas. He had noticeably declined by the time they won their rings.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d argue that Jordan&rsquo;s actual highest peak was before he ever won a ring too. The first 3-peat might include some of the peak stretch, but the absolute best MJ was probably the two preceding seasons.</p>

<p>Nothing to argue there, MJ peak was 1988 to 1933.
He was still best player in the league during the 2nd peak, but not as crazy dominant as he was during the previous time.</p>

<p>1st 3peat team had super thin bench, but 3 guys (MJ, Scottie, Horace) could play 40 mpg and do it all on both ends.</p>

<p><strong>Michael Jordan, December 18, 1995:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s Scottie Pippen&rsquo;s team. He&rsquo;s made unbelievable strides. There used to be inconsistency in his game that people criticized. But now, he&rsquo;s got to be one of the best players in the game, if not the best.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Chris Webber, Washington Bullets player, March 19, 1995:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>He&rsquo;s the best player in the league, it&rsquo;s that simple. He makes them go. He checked me all night.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Doug Collins, Pistons coach, December 30, 1995:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Scottie Pippen is the best player in the NBA right now. Aside from my guys, if there were a player I&rsquo;d pay to see play, it would be Scottie Pippen.</p>

Calling Scottie Pippen the best player in the NBA in 1995 at the peak of Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson&rsquo;s powers is probably the most stupid thing i have seen an NBA player do, MJ couldn&rsquo;t properly evaluate NBA players even when he was active, holy shit.</p>

      <label for="ld2opbl" class="commentText"><p>I agree a bit as Bill is my favorite player, but these guys are just more well rounded than any previous generations, and that&rsquo;s more progression of the game more than anything. That&rsquo;s what makes goat conversations hard for me, because Bill and Jordan can only play with what others had learned up to that point, if they both had three-point lines there entire lives growing up I&rsquo;m sure they would have shot a bunch more threes growing up, but it either wasn&rsquo;t a thing or wasn&rsquo;t nearly the emphasis it is now. And I do think guys from specific generations are better at certain techniques, especially ones that have been lost (or have been phased out) to time / evolution, but also they usually just don&rsquo;t work as well as in this era, such as the triple threat or the bank shot, great moves but their efficiency in today&rsquo;s game because they are difficult, usually take time to set up, and have only a little better chance of going in than a 3.</p>

<p>It really depends on (in respective to GOAT discussions) if you value guys who dominated their era, or guys who maybe, might, possibly have a chance of changing their game a specific way to go with the times. Just from the fact that we can&rsquo;t ever really know I wouldn&rsquo;t put too much attention on when people don&rsquo;t understand because it&rsquo;s understandable, they probably weren&rsquo;t around for it, so no reason to blame them for their opinions, just gotta set them straight&hellip; Nicely lol</p>

There isn’t a good argument for that — only a weak argument of you look at the actual players.</p>

<p>Not saying he’s far off but calling it recency bias to NOT have him in too 30 just seems like it’s the opposite of the truth</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, who you got as the goat? That might explain your position unless I misread your comment</p>

<p>But although a lot of people do know that Scottie is a great, I don&rsquo;t think a lot of people truly realize just how special he was&ndash;especially for his time.</p>

<p>I probably shouldn&rsquo;t have used &ldquo;underrated&rdquo;, but rather &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t get the recognition he deserves&rdquo;. I think a lot of people just see him purely as Robin to MJ&rsquo;s Batman, but aside from being the best &ldquo;Robin&rdquo; any Robin could possibly be, Scottie was a legitimately great player in his own right.</p>

He also was just flat out better offensively/as a player at his peak.</p>

The Bulls of ‘95 did have issues that Pippen didn’t help but I think the team did indeed downgrade and didn’t fill in the loses that year. Doesn’t take away from how good he was and how you won’t find that many better players than Scottie Pippen. Top 10 is not inaccurate.</p>

      <label for="ld42snl" class="commentText"><p>Yeah but like I said, attitude and all, Pip had the talent. The attitude stems from a lot of issues, a lot self-inflicted, but he was all-NBA on both ends and imo top 10 in the league at worst at his peak. Insane for the league’s best player to have a running mate that was better than him defensively and producing a solid 20-6-6.</p>

<p>He literally said Pip was better than Kobe and KD and a few other greats</p>

<p>That is not a reasonable basketball opinion at all</p>

      <label for="ld3hsuf" class="commentText"><p>Yes, that’s what I’m getting at. I can see that many people here who have said Pip is top 25 all time are LeBron fans. There is zero case for Pip as top 25. There is minimal case for top 30. He starts having a strong case around 30 and later.</p>

<p>Those same people having Pip top 25 will downplay Wade despite Wade winning a FMVP With a great performance and being easily the best performer in 2011 finals.</p>

<p>The slander he’s referring to is very likely criticism of Pip for going nuts and hating not just Jordan but Phil Jackson and others.</p>

      <label for="ld2i9as" class="commentText"><p>Man, Klutch Sports really digging deep into basketball history to try and diminish Jordan&rsquo;s legacy. Here they&rsquo;re trying to make his teammates sound like they were as good as the all time greats of the day. Pippen wasn&rsquo;t anywhere close to the level of Hakeem, let&rsquo;s stop this nonsense right now. Kids will believe these stories, and that&rsquo;s what Klutch want, they want to shift the narrative for the younger, more gullible generation who don&rsquo;t have the knowledge of the game that they perhaps should have so it&rsquo;s easy to mould their minds and create an image of LeBron as the GOAT.<br>
Why would they do this though? What is it in it for them? Well, how about <em>billions of freakin dollars?</em> Jordan&rsquo;s brand his worth multiple billions right now and his status as the greatest player of all time has been a huge part of that. Shifting that mantle over to LeBron would be equally financially lucrative, well even more so given how much more money is in the game in general. We are talking about setting up the company for decades to come after LeBron retires. Anyone who can&rsquo;t see it&rsquo;s a genuine campaign they are running probably needs adult supervision to cross a busy street.</p>

Plugging in Jordan at the end of the season, rearranging the pecking order and getting a championship would have required a miracle (which never happened).</p>

<p>Besides even if they got to the finals in 95 they would have likely lost to the Rockets. That and the previous years bulls team without Horace Grant would struggle against dominant centers so I imagine Olajuwon and his crew would have won.</p>
