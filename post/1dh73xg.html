</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>The last time was in the <sup>1999</sup>&frasl;<sub>00</sub> season, when Shaq averaged just under 30ppg, won the scoring title and went on to win the NBA title as well. Since 2000, only 3 scoring champions reached the Finals, Allen Iverson in 2001, Kevin Durant in 2012 and Steph Curry in 2016.</p>

<p>Lost in the First round <strong>(8)</strong>: <strong>2002</strong> Iverson, <strong>2003</strong> T-Mac, <strong>2005</strong> Iverson, <strong>2006</strong> Kobe, <strong>2007</strong> Kobe, <strong>2009</strong> Wade, <strong>2010</strong> Durant, <strong>2017</strong> Westbrook,</p>

<p>Lost in the Second Round <strong>(6)</strong>: <strong>2008</strong> LeBron, <strong>2013</strong> Melo, <strong>2019</strong> Harden, <strong>2020</strong> Harden, <strong>2022</strong> Embiid, <strong>2023</strong> Embiid</p>

<p>Lost in the Conference Finals <strong>(3)</strong>: <strong>2011</strong> Durant, <strong>2014</strong> Durant, <strong>2018</strong> Harden</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t make the Playoffs <strong>(3)</strong>: <strong>2004</strong> T-Mac, <strong>2015</strong> Westbrook, <strong>2021</strong> Curry</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s highly improbable for the Mavericks to come back and win the title, but if they do, it would be only the second time in the 21st century for a player to win both, the scoring title and NBA title.</p>

That and the phantom foul for Kareem are two of the hardest ways to not win a championship man. Besides 2016 warriors idk if I’ve seen worse the 13 Spurs </p>

The pacers might’ve done fine against Portland, phoenix, Utah, etc in 2000. In those five years the East went 0-5 against the lakers and spurs, but so did the rest of the west.</p>

If it wasn’t for LeBron going absolutely nuclear we woulda got to the finals in 07 too. Imagine if we draft Melo, Wade, or Bosh.. everyone says we wouldn’t have gotten Sheed that’s BS tho. Melo had no impact on Sheed getting traded from the Blazers to the Hawks. His stock was low cuz his “attitude”. IMO Prince just goes to the bench and we still trade for Sheed</p>

He was something more people looked up to rather then like shaq, who was physically so different from most people.</p>

<p>I was thinking his hero-ball carried the weak sixxers, but ive seen many say he was innefficient and his style didnt really work - in any team.</p>

      <label for="l8vvpgl" class="commentText"><p>Getting to the finals kind of proves his style worked to some extent. He absolutely was a ball hog in his prime, but looking at the stats of his teammates, none of them really put up better numbers elsewhere. He was showing signs of being more of a team player when he left Philly but he had lost a step and his back was causing him problems at that point</p>

I suspect they&rsquo;d have him in the +3/+4 range, which, you know, really good - ballpark of MVP Rose or peak John Wall - but more a 2nd/3rd/fringe all-NBA guy than the truly elite players in the league.</p>

Most of their money was tied up in TMac and Grant Hill who was injured all the time so it really was like they stripped away a star with no compensation lol. I think he carries the 6ers just fine.</p>

<p>edit for u/Gabagoo44 since you blocked:</p>

<p>LOL do you even know how many games Grant Hill played in during TMac&rsquo;s tenure? 4, 14, 29, 0. Tell me you didn&rsquo;t follow the NBA back then without telling me you didn&rsquo;t follow the NBA back then. You&rsquo;re straight up lying if you&rsquo;re saying you would&rsquo;ve traded Deke, McKie, Snow, and Theo Ratliff (who avg&rsquo;d 12 btw) for Mike Miller, Bo Outlaw, Andre Declerq, and Pat Garrity LOL</p>

Another was his second season where he only played 18 games because of injury. Two of those were with the wizards after he had been retired for 3 years. Of the 11 full seasons he played with the Bulls, he won the scoring title 10 times. He only missed it his rookie season, when he led the league in points but finished third in scoring average behind Bernard king and Larry Bird.</p>

      <label for="l91h6gt" class="commentText"><p>I was thinking of Rodman as the third best Bull (although this only applies to the second threepeat). He averaged 5.3ppg as MJ&rsquo;s teammate.</p>

<p>Pippen only averaged 17.2 ppg in the seasons he played with MJ. This excludes the two MJ retirement seasons where he averaged his two highest ppg seasons of his career at 22.0 and 21.4. Although during the threepeat years he was still at 19ppg.</p>

      <label for="l8vro35" class="commentText"><p>Or before really. The only players to win a championship the same season as a scoring title are Joe Fulks (47), George Mikan (49 &amp; 50), Kareem (71), Jordan (91, 92, 93, 96, 97, 98), Shaq (2000). So it happened  4 times in the 45 years before Jordan did it 6 times in an 8 year span. Then it happened once in the 25 years since Jordan did it. Safe to say in was an anomaly before the 90s and after the 90s. I think given this breakdown the fairer way to phrase the initial comment would be something like:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It makes sense, usually if a player wins the scoring title, it likely means that either his supporting cast isn’t pulling enough weight or their entire offensive plan is to give that one person the ball. Neither of these is a prerequisite for championship unless the player taking the shots is Michael Jordan&rdquo;.</p>

<p>For me the era has less to do with it than the specific player in this instance since achievement is incredibly rare across all eras apart from when Jordan had a supporting cast pulling their weight and the triangle meant the entire offensive plan wasn&rsquo;t (just) to give Jordan the ball.    </p>

<p>It happened 7 times with triangle, phil jackson tex winter offense, and in 7 of his 11 rings.</p>

      <label for="l8w12kk" class="commentText"><p>Excellent point yet even then <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> were with Jordan while <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> were without. Hence while it&rsquo;s right to point to the triangle as a contributing factor it would still be accurate to highlight Jordan even above the triangle since he was responsible for 86% of the times the triangle offence led to a scoring champion and NBA title in the same season.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are specific reasons why Jordan is such an outlier and some of them may well be era and team related. KD could have done the same with the warriors most likely but maybe there wasn&rsquo;t the same emphasis on regular season given Jordan seemed to focus on each and every game (yet still managed to step up in the playoffs). I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s many other reasons and Jordan being a 10 time scoring champ would increase his odds as well.</p>

<p>Jordan gave the Bulls an extra 11 wins his first year and they went from 2nd from last to a playoff team. This is without Pippen, Horace. He had bad teammates.</p>

<p>Their first time making out of the first round Jordan averaged 45ppg the series. Pippen and Horace combined for 19.7 ppg.</p>

<p>You guys that weren’t around for that have absolutely no idea how insanely good Michael Jordan was/is.</p>

      <label for="l8v59sj" class="commentText"><p>in the modern, guys who have to shoulder an all time scoring load do so because of weak teammates offensively. it kind of makes sense really. it’s why Brad Beal averaged 30 and didn’t make an All Star team. The only reason he was dropping 30 was because no one else could score.</p>

      <label for="l8v2xg7" class="commentText"><p>Thinking basketball has a great video on this. Generally, the winningest offensive stars balance scoring and playmaking.</p>

<p>If you score too much, you aren&rsquo;t getting your teammates involved, which generally either means your teammates aren&rsquo;t good enough to contend, or, you are hurting your team by not trusting them to help you out.</p>

<p>If you score too little, your lack of aggression results in reduced defensive attention, which means your playmaking suffers. Playmaking isn&rsquo;t just assists, it&rsquo;s also creating looks for your teammates, such as curry doubled creating a 4 on 3 for his teammates, or Giannis/LeBron driving causing 4 defenders to close in on the paint opening up open shooters.</p>

<p>You have to balance scoring enough where you are drawing defensive attention to make your teammates lives easier, while also not scoring too much and taking shots away from teammates. In this case, leading the league in scoring often means you are taking too much shots to maximise scoring + playmaking.</p>

<p>Even with Jordan who won scoring titles while winning championships, his highest scoring years were 87-90, and when he was actually winning championships, his scoring rate dropped.</p>

<p>Best example is probably Wilt: when he was scoring 50 PPG, his offenses were generally slightly above average. When he stopped scoring that much but instead passed significantly more, his teams became elite offenses and his team won 69 games.</p>

      <label for="l8wlfty" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a good point about Jordan&rsquo;s scoring declining during the championship years. It&rsquo;s just that his scoring peak was so high that he could decline considerably and he was still be the scoring champ. It&rsquo;s similar to how LeBron has lost a lot of athleticism but is still often the most athletic person on the court (at least in short bursts) because his peak was so ridiculously high.</p>

      <label for="l8yskao" class="commentText"><p>I think what you&rsquo;re saying is generally true, but I don&rsquo;t think it applies to Jordan individually, although it might apply to the Bulls as a team.</p>

<p>Jordan&rsquo;s scoring rate dropped, but his shot attempts remained high. 86-87 was an outlier and his shot attempts significantly dropped after, but he played 3 more seasons after 86-87 without winning a title, and he averaged more shot attempts during his third championship run (92-93) than any year besides 86-87. The big reason for his scoring drop was a decline in shooting efficiency, from about 60% true shooting during the late 80s to 53% by his final year with the Bulls.</p>

<p>What changed in the 90s was the emergence of Scottie Pippen as a great playmaker and floor general. Pippen actually led the Bulls in assists during their championship runs.</p>

<p>What gets overlooked with the Bulls is their defense, especially during the second three peat when Jordan was no longer an efficient scorer. Some time ago I looked at how often Jordan shot 50% or better from the field during his championship runs. It was something like <sup>36</sup>&frasl;<sub>58</sub> games during his first 3 peat, and <sup>18</sup>&frasl;<sub>58</sub> games during his second three peat. But the second three peat Bulls were dogs on defense. Every starter was between 6&rsquo;6 and 6&rsquo;10 and capable of defending multiple positions. At least three of them were dpoy contenders.</p>

<p>And if you look at the multi-championship teams of the 21st century, they&rsquo;re almost all great defensive teams even though they had great scorers like Kobe, Duncan, Curry, and Lebron. Of those 4 guys, only Curry has not won multiple all-nba defensive selections, although he has teammates who have.</p>

And he also led the greatest team of all time shooting 40% from 3 in the 90s. I think LeBron is the second greatest player of all time but it&rsquo;s literally impossible to argue anyone but MJ is #1.</p>

Guy shot 50% on midrange shots shooting like 12 a game, was the best perimeter defender AND offensive threat in almost every matchup, played even better in the playoffs than his already ridiculous regular season numbers. Even if the second three peat didn&rsquo;t happen because of Sonics/Jazz MJ would still be the GOAT.</p>

<p>But perhaps being a one dimensional star (even in scoring) isn&rsquo;t the best way of winning.  MJ was just so fucking good at it that even when he consciously cut down his scoring to play more system ball (his scoring avg went down after they adopted the triangle) that thr MF STILL won the all the scoring titles.</p>

      <label for="l8yzals" class="commentText"><p>People on this sub will tell you that Westbrook&rsquo;s midrange and rim-finishing percentages haven&rsquo;t really changed since his prime years, but the actual answer for that is that the difficulty of his shots has drastically lowered but he&rsquo;s still finishing at a similar percentage.</p>

<p>In other words, let&rsquo;s say he makes 42% of his midrangers, just a random number. He used to make 42% of his midrangers going at full speed, with an entire defense focused on stopping him, creating something out of nowhere, using his aggressiveness to force open opportunities for his teammates.</p>

<p>Nowadays, he makes 42% of his midrangers, those being wide-open shots that defenders barely bother contesting and that defenses want him to take.</p>

<p>Get what I mean?</p>

<p>In truth, Westbrook used to have a reasonably reliable pull-up midrange shot, could get himself to the rim at any time (although he was never an elite finisher, he created those opportunities very well), and when he drew contact, he shot his free throws far better.</p>

<p>Now his shot is gone in general, he can&rsquo;t get himself to the rim as much, and his free throw rate has been consistently far lower than his prime.</p>

<p>it would be only the second time in the 21st century for a player to win both</p>

<p>Well ackshually it would be the first time if you count the scoring title in the latter end of the season. The 21st century only starts with the year 2001 (i.e. 2001 is the first year of the new century since the 2000th year needs to finish before you start the new century/millennium), and so Shaq&rsquo;s 2000 season falls under 20th century.</p>

The next person who won the scoring title and averaged less points than AI was someone in the 50&rsquo;s. Crazy.</p>
