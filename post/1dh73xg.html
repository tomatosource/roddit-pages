</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>The last time was in the <sup>1999</sup>&frasl;<sub>00</sub> season, when Shaq averaged just under 30ppg, won the scoring title and went on to win the NBA title as well. Since 2000, only 3 scoring champions reached the Finals, Allen Iverson in 2001, Kevin Durant in 2012 and Steph Curry in 2016.</p>

<p>Lost in the First round <strong>(8)</strong>: <strong>2002</strong> Iverson, <strong>2003</strong> T-Mac, <strong>2005</strong> Iverson, <strong>2006</strong> Kobe, <strong>2007</strong> Kobe, <strong>2009</strong> Wade, <strong>2010</strong> Durant, <strong>2017</strong> Westbrook,</p>

<p>Lost in the Second Round <strong>(6)</strong>: <strong>2008</strong> LeBron, <strong>2013</strong> Melo, <strong>2019</strong> Harden, <strong>2020</strong> Harden, <strong>2022</strong> Embiid, <strong>2023</strong> Embiid</p>

<p>Lost in the Conference Finals <strong>(3)</strong>: <strong>2011</strong> Durant, <strong>2014</strong> Durant, <strong>2018</strong> Harden</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t make the Playoffs <strong>(3)</strong>: <strong>2004</strong> T-Mac, <strong>2015</strong> Westbrook, <strong>2021</strong> Curry</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s highly improbable for the Mavericks to come back and win the title, but if they do, it would be only the second time in the 21st century for a player to win both, the scoring title and NBA title.</p>

      <label for="l8uz0is" class="commentText"><p>To properly judge iverson as a player is very hard for me. I remember him beeing so damn popular early 2000s, he was the most popular player around my area. He was something more people looked up to rather then like shaq, who was physically so different from most people.</p>

<p>I was thinking his hero-ball carried the weak sixxers, but ive seen many say he was innefficient and his style didnt really work - in any team.</p>

      <label for="l8v2xg7" class="commentText"><p>Thinking basketball has a great video on this. Generally, the winningest offensive stars balance scoring and playmaking.</p>

<p>If you score too much, you aren&rsquo;t getting your teammates involved, which generally either means your teammates aren&rsquo;t good enough to contend, or, you are hurting your team by not trusting them to help you out.</p>

<p>If you score too little, your lack of aggression results in reduced defensive attention, which means your playmaking suffers. Playmaking isn&rsquo;t just assists, it&rsquo;s also creating looks for your teammates, such as curry doubled creating a 4 on 3 for his teammates, or Giannis/LeBron driving causing 4 defenders to close in on the paint opening up open shooters.</p>

<p>You have to balance scoring enough where you are drawing defensive attention to make your teammates lives easier, while also not scoring too much and taking shots away from teammates. In this case, leading the league in scoring often means you are taking too much shots to maximise scoring + playmaking.</p>

<p>Even with Jordan who won scoring titles while winning championships, his highest scoring years were 87-90, and when he was actually winning championships, his scoring rate dropped.</p>

<p>Best example is probably Wilt: when he was scoring 50 PPG, his offenses were generally slightly above average. When he stopped scoring that much but instead passed significantly more, his teams became elite offenses and his team won 69 games.</p>
