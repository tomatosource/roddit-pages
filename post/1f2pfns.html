It&rsquo;s revisionist history to pretend that the move was hated for going to a team he blew a lead to and they would go on to win a championship. Ray Allen did the exact same shit in 2013 and everyone calls his game-tying shot one of the best in basketball history. People are mad at that team because they were as dominant as we thought. </p>

      <label for="lk8npdk" class="commentText"><p>Bro your conflation is crazy. Big 3 has nothing to do with KD being hated from day 1.  Ray Allen was only hated by Boston for admittedly similar-ish reasons.</p>

<p>KD being a bonafide superstar and joining 73-9 warriors were headlines as soon as the move happened, so whatever you&rsquo;re going on about &ldquo;it happened because they were winning&rdquo; is just not true. On the flipside, if they had lost with KD and never got a chip, I&rsquo;d argue he would have become even more of a joke in the NBA. A Hall of Shame would be constructed to house him only</p>

One of arguably the best player in the league joining the undoubtedly best team in the league ruining league parity is what made people hate him, not this winning/losing nonsense. I don&rsquo;t care how you slice the winning/losing during his time in GS. If he lost ALL the years he was there and was ringless, he&rsquo;d overtake JaVale McGee in the clown hall of fame</p>

<p>KD joining the team that beat him 3-1 and also had the best record in nba history completely overshadowed the Heatles. Not to mention the Heatles didn’t kill the parity in the league. Warriors legitimately made NBA boring to watch because you knew who would win</p>

Which had already won the title the year before, were a few buckets away from winning again, and went fucking 73-9 that year.</p>

I didn’t care that he left okc, it seemed pretty clear they were gonna have a lot of trouble getting over the hump. It was where he went that made me (and a lot of others) a hater.</p>

<p>I’m also not buying the “invites lebron comparisons” excuse when the gsw move was much more similar to what lebron did when he went to Miami.</p>

<p><strong>Kevin Durant on joining Warriors: this is &lsquo;the hardest road&rsquo; to a championship</strong></p>

<p>In contrast to popular opinion on Durant&rsquo;s move, he called his decision to join the Warriors the hardest thing he&rsquo;s ever had to do, adding that joining Golden State, in his mind, makes the prospect of winning a title more difficult.</p>

<p>Durant says this is &ldquo;the hardest road,&rdquo; not the easiest to a championship.</p>

      <label for="lkdhxfc" class="commentText"><p>You’re right. Checked back on the articles. Bosh was an all star. Dragic had just joined. First incident was February 2015. It wasn’t until a subsequent clot in February 2016, that it was considered potentially career-ending. It ended up being his last game.</p>

<p>So if we are talking summer of 2016, Bosh’s status was unclear but it is probably fair to say KD wasn’t factoring in Bosh. As an organization and fan base(including his teammates), we were certainly hoping he would not have to retire.</p>

<p>It was such a devastating, unfortunate set of circumstances.</p>

-Whiteside was still seen as a promising Center in a time where the position was extremely weak.</p>

<p>I know the current circlejerk here is &ldquo;Heat bad&rdquo; but it would&rsquo;ve been a really strong team. The East in 2017-2018 was hilariously crap- Cavs went 12-1 in 2017 then came out of the East with a horrible roster in 2018. A KD-led Heat team would&rsquo;ve been serious competition, if not the favorites in 2018.</p>

      <label for="lka77g1" class="commentText"><p>We were literally the only viable destination for KD that&rsquo;s why I was so confident we were going to get him. No way he would&rsquo;ve gone to the IT led Celtics fools gold team and he would&rsquo;ve gotten more shit if he went to that spurs team with Kawhi LMA TD Manu and Parker, they&rsquo;d shit on him and say he can&rsquo;t win without 5 HoFers and the GOAT coach that won 67 games. We were his only real choice. In hindsight that was an even better move since both Celtics and spurs collapsed because of the IT and kawhi situations</p>

<p>The way you’re framing the quote is a lot different than what UD is saying. UD says he thinks that how KD might feel, you’re making it seem like a quote directly from KD or something.</p>

<p>But it’s another “old head thinks current player is soft” post that r/nba loves, so see you on the front page</p>

<p>How is this another old head thinks current player is soft post?</p>

<p>Haslem is completely right, it&rsquo;s just logical. He&rsquo;s not saying KD is soft. He&rsquo;s putting himself in KD&rsquo;s shoes, he even says so at the end. That&rsquo;s how he&rsquo;d feel about it.</p>

<p>Ironically you&rsquo;re sort of doing what you&rsquo;re complaining OP is doing yourself with that last bit, you&rsquo;re framing it differently to what UD is saying.</p>

<p>Kd has been loved on this sub recently cos of the gold medal so tbh I think your point is outdated.</p>

<p>Regardless we’ve seen from his tweets he can be sensitive, it’s not that deep lol</p>

<p>Crazy stacked rosters throughout his career, two cake walk championships that were more because he removed himself as an opponent rather than elevated his new team.</p>
