<p>Dunno what it was about the Timberwolves that really got him tbh.</p>

<p>I remember talking to a Timberwolves fan before the series started and he admited it himself that they might get cooked if MPJ plays like that again.</p>

<p>In reality he shows a ton of flashes, but i think he never exerts himself as much as he could because he is worried about his back, which is 100% understandable.</p>

      <label for="ll4df6w" class="commentText"><p>Honestly id love to hear him talk about what actually happened with him in that series. Was it your guyses defensive scheme or just a bit of a shooting slump or bits of both.</p>

<p>Like with Jamal it was him being slower due to injuries combined with the pressure you guys put on him during the series which made it tough for him to get into rhythm except for a few games.</p>

<p>KCP was never gonna be the make or break guy on offense, but his defensive impact was minimal compared to what he usually provides.</p>

<p>But it was MPJ that was really weird. Maybe it was his back acting up that made him afraid to overexert himself or being guarded by a much tojgher defender caused him to just miss.</p>

His handle isnt tight enough rn nor can he create in the mid range game consistently. That is something he can do but if it happens is a different story. </p>

      <label for="ll79jsj" class="commentText"><p>As the leading MPJ researcher, few know that he tried the Sarno back pain method last year and became pain free in early winter, allowing him to play 81 games (missed one game because he didnt bring the shoes that allow the AFO brace in them).</p>

<p>As the pain subsides, he&rsquo;s going to get more freedom of movement (not like high school, but doesnt have to be cautious playing anymore). IMO, this will be Mike&rsquo;s season with the most dunks since we had him playing the 4 in 2019, and MPJs best season of his career overall.</p>

<p>Malone just has to get him shots but losing KCP and reggie should open up a lot of usage. There is no clear bench 4. All malone has to do is play MPJ with the bench at 4 and let Russ statpad assists. For all the talk about MPJ chucking 3s, he was the number 1 midrange jumpshooter in the NBA last year (over Durant and Booker).</p>

<p>In the Nuggets sub, we have a guy who looked at how good at team does when given players take 5+shots a quarter. The top 5 in the league for +/- while being high usage are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Tatum</p></li>

<li><p>MPJ</p></li>

<li><p>Embiid</p></li>

<li><p>SGA</p></li>

<li><p>Ant</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Mike is the key for turning Denver into a dynasty, just depends if Malone can figure out what so many others have.</p>

Without a player as great at shooting as MPJ as their third option who knows if Denver wins a chip. The core 4 of Jokic/Murray/Gordon/MPJ when all healthy has a pretty great win % from what I remember.</p>

      <label for="ll22uul" class="commentText"><p>Well tbh MPJs performances in the playoffs leave a lot to be desired. Like AG was more of the 3rd option than MPJ.</p>

<p>It was more the addition of his size on top of the 3s that makes him so good for the Nuggets.</p>

<p>Honestly though i dunno who the Nuggets take if not MPJ, but i doubt it would be anyone as good as him.</p>

<p>Maybe they try to trade up for like SGA (hardcore cope there lol).</p>

      <label for="ll4e3o9" class="commentText"><p>he shot extremely poorly against the wolves. 16% from three in game 7, if he shoots his regular 40% the nuggets probably win that game. he was on fire during the lakers series though i think the family issues just became too much for him. he said he was giving statements to a judge on behalf of his brother like a day before a playoff game or something</p>

<p>Go look at Jokic playing with Mike on the floor vs without. Jok scores so much easier because a defender is nailed down to the far corner. It simplifies the game. either jok scores 1v1 or lobs to AG because that&rsquo;s where the help is coming from. and obviously you cant help off short corner or top of key</p>

Hell, there are 70 pairs of siblings who have played in the NBA alone. Doesn’t even need to be American pro leagues either for this sample pool. I don’t think you’ll be able to find one with a resume like the porters.</p>

<p>Jontay Porter: 2 ACL tears. One with an MCL tear.</p>

<p>Coban Porter: Torn ACL. Stopped playing early due to arrest.</p>

<p>Bri Porter: 5 ACL tears - medically retired.</p>

<p>Cierra Porter: Torn ACL in 8th grade, Lisfranc injury, multiple other knee issues - medically retired.</p>

<p>Michael Porter Jr. - 3 back surgeries.</p>

<p>There are absolutely enough pro families to make a judgement and enough Porter family injuries to say there’s something going on with that family.</p>

<p>Lmao wtf is this? Dude, that was LITERALLY his biggest criticism during his ENTIRE career, that he NEVER worked on a jump shot. Yeah, he did everything else well, but his lack of shooting, his ENTIRE lack of scoring outside 5 feet, was the difference between him being just an all star and an MVP candidate…..</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just an all-star&rdquo; lol alright buddy. Could get to the rim at will, elite passer and the best 2 way player by a large margin. He was still an MVP candidate.</p>

<p>Again, not disagreeing he should have worked on his shooting but it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re dismissing every other aspect of his game which was the reason for him being highly rated.</p>

They remove the part of the bulging disc and most of the time you leave the hospital the same day as the surgery. That’s certainly mild compared to having “rods and shit” in his back, or a spinal fusion. Which he did not have.</p>

      <label for="ll24cjv" class="commentText"><p>He plays pretty similarly to Beasley. 6&rsquo;9ish tweener forward with an outside shot, some handles, active rebounding and not really looking to pass. Had he been drafted into the kind of situation MPJ was in Denver (he kind of was but he was traded so Lebron would have cap space for the Big Three) his career could&rsquo;ve turned out a lot differently.</p>

<p>Beasley&rsquo;s freshman year is legit one of the best college seasons of all time to this day. I&rsquo;m pretty sure MPJ would&rsquo;ve dominated similarly had he not been injured. Like KD that kind of frame with guard skills against NCAA competition has always destroyed.</p>

      <label for="ll39m16" class="commentText"><p>I feel people either overrated his handles or expected him to improve massively in that area. That has always been his biggest weakness to me, health aside. He is obviously a very talented shooter and is great in catch-and-shoot scenarios, but he&rsquo;s never created a lot of good looks for himself off the dribble at all. Whereas early comps like PG and Durant in particular have always had really smooth handles for their height.</p>

      <label for="ll3h2af" class="commentText"><p>I’m a Nuggets fan as well as a Heat fan, but I see a ton of Nuggets fans being a bit delusional thinking that one day, MPJ will just unlock all that lost potential. If you look at their sub, people still think he has the highest potential on the team, but it’s pretty obvious the guy is too stiff to handle. Also, he always looks stiff as hell when attacking the rim.</p>

<p>His bad lower back really set him back and it’s a miracle his career has been as good as it has been given the chronic issues. Backs just don’t heal up very well. If we’re counting on MPJ for a leap to put us over the edge, then it’s going to be a bit of an off year. I am hoping Braun or Watson improve their games, because I can’t see MPJ all of a sudden becoming shifty or a playmaker.</p>

      <label for="ll7m7l8" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d like to see Malone try some different lineups during the season. Obviously Nugs gotta find a way to be more consistent in the Joker bench minutes. That offense just dies without him. Imo the starting 5 dipped a bit, but the bench got significantly better. I think that may be the formula for another title but I&rsquo;m biased.</p>

      <label for="ll7u1mc" class="commentText"><p>I agree.<br>
My hot take is the starting 5 is actually better. People haven&rsquo;t watched CB play with the starters but the numbers are&hellip;. very very good. Like +15 net rating best team of all time good.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think thats sustainable for a year obviously but the idea you lost shooting and gained nothing isnt true to me. You lost shooting/screen navigation and gained rebounding, big guard defense, athleticism, cutting. The nuggets are going to be the #1 rebounding team in the NBA this year, a la NY last year. Just bullying teams off the court playing volleyball with the rim.</p>

<p>And correct on bench, Reggie was sneaky bottom 5 rotation players in the NBA this past year</p>

<p>&ldquo;“If you have a chef or someone who is helping you prep those meals for you and making sure you get the right proteins, it’s easy to do it,” Porter said. “But trying to be vegan on your own, it’s hard to find all the right stuff.”&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nuggets strength and conditioning coach Felipe Eichenberger was ecstatic to hear Porter had tried meat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;“He came in last year, and we would work out hard, and he wouldn’t put on as much muscle mass as we wanted,” Eichenberger said. “He was always frustrated. So I was like, ‘Can we add fish? Can we add a little bit of different protein to your diet?’ So, we added some chicken here and there and fish and then he gained, what, like 12 to 13 pounds of muscle over the past year.”&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Porter entered the league as a vegan and was not fully educated on how to make sure his body got all the fuel it needed to keep up with the pace of the NBA.</p>

<p>“Those guys had been around, knew what to do when it came to getting the right foods,” Eichenberger said. “Porter wasn’t eating the right vegan food.”&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It took Porter some time to adjust to eating meat more regularly. But once he started to see the physical benefits, Porter knew he made the right choice by buying into Eichenberger’s plan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But even though Eichenberger is responsible for changing Porter’s diet, it was really sparked by one little slip: one little piece of bacon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You guys are fucking trippin. Porters career 100000000% became more sustainable after he started eating meat and ditched vegan food. As i mentioned - this was openly being discussed in the AAU/HS circuit when he was in HS. it wasn&rsquo;t in any big articles or anything but any time he got injured, just taking a look at the comments everyone was blaming it on his diet. Suddenly he changes his diet and gets more muscle and stops getting hurt as much. Sure thing buddy. Can you breathe alright with your head so far up your ass? This article goes from &ldquo;you need to eat the right stuff&rdquo; to &ldquo;he wasnt getting the right stuff with his vegan diet&rdquo; even though his nutritionist and mom who pushed him to the vegan world in the first place were literally always within arms reach at the times he would have needed them most?</p>
