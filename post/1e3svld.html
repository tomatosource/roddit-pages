      <p>Ik we all have personal biases which lead to us overrating our teams many times, but what are some times where u vastly underrated your own team? For me as a hawks fan itâ€™s an easy answer, the 2021 run to the ECF. I was pretty confident we would beat the Knicks in Round 1, but thought we had ZERO shot against the Sixers. I just thought going in we had no counter to Embiid while the sixers had two counters to trae in Ben Simmons and Danny green.
But we all know what happened :)</p>

      <label for="lda6b1y" class="commentText"><p>Honestly, this is kinda true. We all had a hope that Steph would win it, especially after saying &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t wanna see us next year&rsquo;. But we also had that doubt in mind like is it really possible (considering we (or maybe just me) thought he didn&rsquo;t have too much support). It was only during the last stretch when Klay came back, and Steph and Dray also came back from their injuries that I was like we are definitely winning this year. This might just be me though.</p>

      <label for="ldauxag" class="commentText"><p>This. 2 miserable seasons of:</p>

<ul>
<li>KD gone</li>
<li>Steph out for a season with broken hand/finger</li>
<li>Major Back to back injuries for Klay</li>
<li>Questionable roster moves i.e. DLo, Kelly Oubre, Wiseman, etc. edit: forgot about project Smiley ðŸ˜†</li>
</ul>

<p>I was convinced our dynasty and run to the finals were over. Playoffs once Klay returned? sure, but didnâ€™t think weâ€™d sniff the Finals again within this era.</p>

<p>Then the <sup>21</sup>&frasl;<sub>22</sub> season startedâ€¦ And they just kept winning. About halfway to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> through the season, it looked like we had a chance. There didnt seem to be a clear contender in my eyes in the West.</p>

<p>Ngl, I will admit things really fell our way in the playoffs, but Iâ€™ve watched sports long enough to know luck is an inevitable element of every championship team. Jamal Murray was out the whole season recovering from a knee injury. We somehow ended up with the Mavs in the WCF, and at that point knew we had a solid chance of coming out the West. Then we somehow were given a young Celtics team in the Finals and had the Dubs taking it in 6.</p>

<p>Even though I barely watched that season due to raising toddlers, that was my favorite Dubs championship team by far. No one had us penciled in to win that season.</p>

      <label for="ldaozqr" class="commentText"><p>As a lifelong Wolves fan I never thought weâ€™d see the day weâ€™re in a conference finals again and anything better than the laughingstock of the league holding the worst all time record in the major American sports. Even going into playoffs this year I had the classic mindset of â€˜here we go againâ€™ after we got paired up with a team we couldnâ€™t beat in the regular season. Went to game 1 just hoping to squeak out a win against PHX and was pleasantly surprised we beat them like we did. That Nuggets series was like the most anti-Wolves thing Iâ€™ve ever seen. Winning Game 7 against the former champs at their home arena. Like being in the Twilight Zone</p>

      <label for="ldavj89" class="commentText"><p>I was pretty sure Phoenix was just better than the Bucks in 2021. After the first two games I was more convinced and especially after the first quarter-and-change of game three when Ayton was kind of popping off. Idk, their offense was just so smooth with Paul operating everything like a conductor and the Bucks meanwhile just playing random. I think Jrue picking up Paul full court and slowly wearing him down was a huge part of that series.</p>

      <label for="lda38t9" class="commentText"><p>Championship season with Bron &amp; AD. I thought there was not enough shooting for modern NBA with roster assembled to win a title.</p>

<p>To be fair.. I was correct with my assesment of being a poor shooting team. Was wrong about much of everything else.</p>
