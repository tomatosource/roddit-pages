      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1estlxk/basketball_gm_rnba_post_2024_edition/"><p>Basketball GM /r/nba post, 2024 edition</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I&rsquo;m the dev of <a href="https://basketball-gm.com/" target="_blank">Basketball GM</a>, a video game where you run a basketball team. You do everything except actually playing basketball: set the lineup, make trades, sign/draft players, manage finances, etc. It&rsquo;s a single player game, it runs in a web browser on any device (mobile, laptop, desktop), and it&rsquo;s completely free. No microtransactions or anything like that.</p>

<p>Some of you may remember me posting here before. Every offseason I wait until there is nothing going on in the basketball world and then make a post about BBGM. That&rsquo;s how I got my initial userbase many years ago, so /r/nba is a special place for me, and these annual BBGM posts are special too.</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t tried BBGM before, <a href="https://play.basketball-gm.com/" target="_blank">go check it out now</a>. If you&rsquo;ve played in the past but haven&rsquo;t been following closely, here are some of the big new features in the past year:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The <a href="https://zengm.com/blog/2024/07/advanced-player-search/" target="_blank">Advanced Player Search page</a> lets you filter and view ratings, stats, and bios of players all in one table.</p></li>

<li><p>Live game sim improvements - <a href="https://zengm.com/blog/2023/12/basketball-game-clock-rewrite/" target="_blank">more realistic late game strategy</a>, <a href="https://zengm.com/blog/2023/11/play-by-play-redesign/" target="_blank">improved play-by-play UI</a>, and (for the football version) a really cool <a href="https://zengm.com/blog/2023/11/football-drive-chart/" target="_blank">drive chart UI</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Options to have some probability of <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/169akco/version_202309031113_new_option_to_have_some/" target="_blank">expansion teams</a> or <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/15c8itb/version_202307280997_new_option_to_have_some/" target="_blank">teams moving to new cities</a> each offseason</p></li>

<li><p>You can now <a href="https://zengm.com/blog/2024/05/signed-free-agents/" target="_blank">view signed free agents</a> (not just available ones) on the Free Agents page, for this season and past seasons.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1cp2i43/version_202405101123_new_feature_team_graphs_view/" target="_blank">Team Graphs</a> - view scatter plots of any two team stats, plus other stuff like finance data, power rankings, etc.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://zengm.com/blog/2024/03/compare-players/" target="_blank">Compare Players</a> - pick 2 or more players to view their ratings and stats side-by-side.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And some smaller updates that are still worth mentioning:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>BBGM is extremely customizable. There are 128 settings available when you start a new league, including things like changing the schedule, the playoff format, gameplay style (you can sim 1950s style basketball if you want), rule changes, challenge modes, the Elam Ending, and more. This year I added a bunch of new settings, and my favorite is an optional <a href="https://zengm.com/blog/2024/04/shootouts/" target="_blank">3 point contest to decide ties</a>, like a shootout in hockey/soccer.</p></li>

<li><p>Tons of UI improvements including <a href="https://zengm.com/facesjs/editor/" target="_blank">a brand new face editor</a>, a new feature to <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/194kdbc/new_saved_trades_page_under_the_players_menu_save/" target="_blank">save trades for later</a>, the ability to <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/165q3mu/version_202308301000_view_combined_playoff_and/" target="_blank">view combined regular season and playoff stats</a>, and many new <a href="https://zengm.com/blog/2023/12/new-logos/" target="_blank">team</a> <a href="https://zengm.com/blog/2023/08/11-new-teams-logos/" target="_blank">logos</a> - I think my favorite is the <a href="https://play.basketball-gm.com/img/logos-primary/SEL.svg" target="_blank">Seoul Idols</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Just hiding a picture of my 6 month old baby <a href="https://zengm.com/files/baby.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> cause he had a big impact on BBGM development this year!</p></li>

<li><p>Since BBGM lets you simulate thousands of seasons in the same league, performance is always on my mind. This year I improved performance of <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1ed0gpf/version_202407261089_new_team_notes_feature_that/lf3qnri/" target="_blank">several</a> <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1cu4nv9/a_couple_small_updates_in_version_202405170541_in/" target="_blank">features</a> in large leagues and added support for <a href="https://zengm.com/blog/2024/06/gzip/" target="_blank">compressed league files</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Real player rosters (start a league at any time in basketball history from 1947 to today) have been continuously updated with a lot of help from /u/alexnoob</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can see even more on <a href="https://zengm.com/changelog/" target="_blank">the BBGM changelog</a> which shows all the updates back to 2013!</p>

Also check out our subreddit /r/BasketballGM, I am always checking there (and email and other social media) for feedback, many of the improvements listed above were suggested by users.</p>

      <label for="li9swgs" class="commentText"><p>Not really, it&rsquo;s a single player game that runs locally.</p>

<p>But what some people do is have one person actually play the game while controlling multiple teams, and then coordinate the actions of those other teams over chat. Then you can periodically export the league and share it with the other GMs so they can see what&rsquo;s going on. That&rsquo;s obviously not ideal and can be kind of tedious, but it does technically work and people do it!</p>

      <label for="li8eriv" class="commentText"><p>Thanks! One of the reasons I originally wanted to make BBGM was how annoying 2k&rsquo;s dynasty mode was. That was 10+ years ago and I haven&rsquo;t played it since then, but it is kind of funny to see people still complaining about the same bugs year after year. Like star free agents going unsigned because they aren&rsquo;t smart enough to see no team has cap space to meet their demands. Doesn&rsquo;t happen in BBGM!</p>

      <label for="libhc7c" class="commentText"><p>Itâs definitely a lot better than 10 years ago but still falls pretty short of a good sim- you have to devote a lot of time to playing around with sliders, ratings, and other settings just to make it at least semi realistic.  And a lot of it is stuff that resets every year too which makes starting up a new season after your first one quite tedious.</p>

      <label for="liboq4c" class="commentText"><p>If you&rsquo;re playing in random players mode, or a real players league starting in 2025, then settings don&rsquo;t change unless you manually change them. For historical leagues that&rsquo;s not true, the settings will change over time. You can have a little control over which things change in a historical league by going to Tools &amp;gt; Scheduled Events, although it&rsquo;s not perfect.</p>

<p>It would also be hard to just &ldquo;do the right thing&rdquo; automatically, cause it&rsquo;s unclear what an edit means&hellip; like if you increase the pace by 10% in 1970, does that mean the pace in 1971 should not change, or should it be set to 10% above 1971&rsquo;s value?</p>

<p>And it is true that the historical ratings aren&rsquo;t great. They&rsquo;re basically good enough to be believable and feel semi-okay if you don&rsquo;t look at it too close. Which is not a small accomplishment, it&rsquo;s not easy to get it to that state! But I really should take another hard look at it and see if I can improve it. Because there are definitely some ways it systematically gets certain things wrong, which should be correctable.</p>

      <label for="li8u1kp" class="commentText"><p>Personally I like the simple gameplay of my games better. But more complex sims like Football Manager and OOTP are more popular. Right now my games are successful enough that I don&rsquo;t feel the need to go in that direction, I&rsquo;d rather keep them how I like them. But if that changes, a version of BBGM with more of the &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; you see in those other games would probably be a good idea from a business perspective.</p>

<p>I havenât played in a while but the most annoying part for me was the fact that you had to sign your second round draft picks. Have you or are you looking into implementing an option to not sign them? I hate having to trade them over and over just so I donât go over the cap by signing them and then cutting them.</p>

      <label for="lic3usz" class="commentText"><p>There isn&rsquo;t an official walkthrough, although <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLBxHgK0Kf8" target="_blank">here is one a user made</a>.</p>

<p>But I would recommend just playing it without really doing much. It really is a fairly simple game at its core, it just has a somewhat overwhelming UI with a lot of detail that you don&rsquo;t normally get in a game like this. So don&rsquo;t worry about what every little thing means at first.</p>

<p>Like just use the big green Play button at the top to advance through the season. Make some draft picks, you don&rsquo;t have to think about it much. Kind of randomly pick to re-sign players or not. Maybe sign a free agent if you have cap space. Then the next season, you can think a little bit more about it - do you want to be rebuilding or contending? Should you make some trades to acquire more talent, or maybe you can get some future draft picks? Are you losing too much money?</p>

<p>My goal is that you can think about those questions in the same way that you think about real basketball teams that you&rsquo;re a fan of. So if you&rsquo;ve already seen NBA teams do stuff like making trades to get under the luxury tax, or tanking to improve their lottery odds, or having all their big contracts expire at the same time so they can make a splash in free agency - you can use those same strategies in BBGM.</p>

<p>Some other that might be useful, but honestly are probably more &ldquo;intermediate&rdquo; than &ldquo;beginner&rdquo;:</p>

      <label for="li8l871" class="commentText"><p>Possibly. It could be based on the same system that decides if a player is willing to re-sign or not, just with a higher threshold, so at some point they just demand a trade if they are unhappy enough.</p>

<p>It would definitely spice up gameplay, but also could be kind of annoying. I don&rsquo;t know. I like the simplicity of the current gameplay too.</p>

      <label for="li9iuqp" class="commentText"><p>With random players, young players are worse than IRL but have larger progs than IRL. Peak and career values are similar though, so it works out okay.</p>

<p>The problem is with real players rosters&hellip; real young players are better than random BBGM ones, so they have higher ratings. But the progs formula is the same, so sometimes they become a bit overpowered.</p>

<p>The solution is to make random young players better, and make their progs smaller. I haven&rsquo;t done this yet because&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know, honestly probably because I&rsquo;m worried I&rsquo;ll accidentally make things worse if I tweak the core ratings/progs algorithms. Certainly it would require a lot of testing.</p>

      <label for="lia2ilq" class="commentText"><p>Not quite, but there are a couple settings that almost do it, which are available when starting a new real players league.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Real Draft Prospect Ratings&rdquo; - by default it&rsquo;s set to &ldquo;Based on rookie season&rdquo;, meaning the best draft prospects will be the ones who had good rookie seasons. There is another option &ldquo;Based on draft position&rdquo; which adjusts their ratings so that they roughly match their draft position. That would result in guys like Jokic going in the 2nd round.</p>

<p>However, it doesn&rsquo;t guarantee that they will turn into good players. There is another setting that does that called &ldquo;Real Player Determinism&rdquo;. If you set that to 100%, then it will enforce that progs in historical leagues match real world progs, so then you know that some players will be stars and others will be busts.</p>

<p>The problem is, &ldquo;Real Player Determinism&rdquo; does not lie to the AI. So the AI also sees accurate potential ratings for players, same as you see. Meaning that someone like Jokic will no longer be drafted in the 2nd round, even if you use both of these settings.</p>

      <label for="lib577c" class="commentText"><p>Amazing game that I have sunk hundreds of hours into. Really appreciate the work you put into it. Quick question, how is a teams contending status determined? I ran a lengthy random debut forever league and frequently saw teams that were &ldquo;rebuilding&rdquo; when they should be contending. Like teams that had deep playoff runs in the season prior and were still top 5 in power ranking/overall rating being labeled as &ldquo;rebuilding&rdquo; and randomly trading off useful players for picks or youth. Kind of made it hard to maintain the competitiveness of some rosters having to wrestle with the AI for some more realism.</p>
