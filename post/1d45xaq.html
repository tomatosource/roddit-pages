I basically have Neil DeGrasse Tyson on instant skip because even if he might have good science content relevant to my interests, he&rsquo;s been on Joe Rogan and if I let him slip by YT thinks I want to see him on JRE which very quickly (like holy shit I can see it happen in real time within 10 shorts) dumps me into Andrew Tate, conspiracy and alt-right garbage. Algorithms really want you to fester in the hate because it&rsquo;s proven to be the best way to drive engagement and it&rsquo;ll take the quickest path it can find to dump that shit on you.</p>

<p>I think it’s because all their pundits have been crying and moaning about “right wing censorship” so algos were adjusted because everything in America has to constantly cave to the right.</p>

<p>Right wingers view censorship as not being the number one most pushed view. Like they feel oppressed when opposition simply exists.</p>

<p>On top of that, the psychological dependency to come back and scroll is awful. I realized that I had some things I truly wanted to do but they wouldn&rsquo;t provide the instant dopamine fix I was looking for. I got my legos to build with and then I said to myself, no its too much work. I won&rsquo;t feel accomplished for like an hour when I finish making what I had. So I took out my phone and got smaller dopamine fixes from doom scrolling.</p>

<p>Twitter moved to an algorithmic timeline in 2015 and it never felt the same. Followed by Meta. Made famous by TikTok. </p>

<p>I started programming by typing games, line by line, from printouts, into my TI-82.</p>

<p>I had to relearn algebra from scratch to pass Calc I &amp; II in college to get my CS degree, but, honestly, programming has been way more valuable to me than algebra ever will be.</p>

<p>Fun fact. The TI-82 could only use a single character as a variable name, so you were severely limited by only having 40 some total variable names available. If you want more than that, you have to reuse some. Very carefully. I think, the next calculator I got, the Ti-85, allowed full words for variable names.</p>

      <label for="l6ccs76" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s long, long overdue &ndash; but I think there&rsquo;s <em>also</em> an information lack here; I&rsquo;m a mid-millenial with lots of kids in school now. They&rsquo;re creeping up on teenage years, and the interest in phones is on the rise&hellip; I <em>just</em> missed the era of having a cell phone in high school, and, as I recall, the late 2000&rsquo;s and early 2010&rsquo;s had a giant problem that wedged itself into our lives after our first two or three dumphones:</p>

<p><strong><em>- Dumb phones couldn&rsquo;t be used without data plans all the sudden.</em></strong></p>

<p>Is this still the case? Can your provider even GET you a plan that <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> contain data? Getting my hands on a dumbphone is probably the easy part &ndash; its the frick&rsquo;n plans (at least in the USA) that basically had us going &ldquo;Welp, I&rsquo;m being forced to pay for the data anyway. I&rsquo;ll enter this smartphone market with something crappy that I&rsquo;ll mostly use for texts and calls. Boo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Obviously we&rsquo;ve since graduated, and plans like Mint Mobile make this an easier pill to swallow &ndash; but I haven&rsquo;t looked into this in 15 years. &amp;gt;_&amp;gt;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m soooo gonna sound like a commercial here.</p>

<p>Consumer Cellular will sell you a voice only plan.  And by voice only I mean it.  Not even txt messaging.</p>

<p>My Dad pays about $15 a month for it and has a old school flippy phone.</p>

      <label for="l6ckf1t" class="commentText"><p>The short answer is yes, the major carriers still offer basic phones and plans with little or no data. Some are postpay and some are prepay, so your mileage will vary depending on if you use a major carrier.</p>

<p>There’s also a ton of smaller prepay carriers out there that can accommodate basic phones.</p>

<p>So it’s doable but might cause some headaches for folks.</p>

      <label for="l6bzokg" class="commentText"><p>From the article: New York Governor Kathy Hochul said (via <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/30/new-york-smartphone-school-ban-bill" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>) that she intends to launch the bill later this year and take it up in New York&rsquo;s next legislative session, which starts in January 2025.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons why parents have objected to schools banning kids from carrying smartphones in the US – phones are banned across all schools in England – has been the need to reach their children at all times, for both emergencies and routine scheduling issues</p>

<p>Hochul&rsquo;s bill appears to address this problem by allowing children to carry phones that lack internet access but can send texts and make calls, which sounds like feature, or dumb, phones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Parents are very anxious about mass shootings in school,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Parents want the ability to have some form of connection in an emergency situation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reason schools have an office with phones, obviously this wasn&rsquo;t an issue until the last like 10 years. Would it be nice to be able to contact your kid if you heard about a school shooter, fire, bomb threat, etc.? Of course, but as someone who definitely has a phone/technology addiction, having a phone in class is just a distraction</p>

<p>I only learned this because one woman showed up at her door, <em>frantic and in tears</em> because “my kid said she was going to church with your kid, but her phone showed she went to [insert sketchy suburb] and didn’t go to church and now her phone is off!!” She thought her kid was like dead and in a ditch somewhere, I guess. In reality, the kid was in that ‘sketchy suburb’ because she offered to give someone who lived there a ride to church and then her phone died. The kid was at church the whole time, alive and well.</p>

<p>There was a poster on reddit than had some funny video of his 10 year old kid freaking out or something. The kid was in his bedroom so people started asking why he had cameras in a 10 year old kids bedroom watching the kid all the time. Poster tried to defend it but it&rsquo;s just gross, imagine growing up with a camera on you <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m an older Gen X dude, had a stay at home Mom so not totally feral but independence was something we learned from an early age. I started walking to school by myself in 1st grade, and this was in UP Michigan with brutal winters and that wind howling of Lake Michigan.</p>

And then others go the entire other way and try to not be too involved and their kids end up being raised by a tablet.</p>

<p>Like. I know Y’all remember life before technology. I definitely do. Our parents let us run around the neighborhood barefoot all day as kids in the 90s. As long as you were home for dinner, they really didn’t care. But now, everybody has to be within arms reach at all times. I barely see any kids in my parents neighborhood just out playing or riding around like was common 25-30 years ago. We have a couple small groups in our townhouse complex that are always outside, but I see them as the exception.</p>

You can&rsquo;t even let your kids out of your sight in some neighborhoods without fear of being charged, arrested, and your kid taken away from you.</p>

<p>The only thing the phone does is provide peace of mind to the parents that their kid is okay in that situation. Is that peace of mind really worth your kids life if the phone rings and the shooter hears it? What if someone they are with has a phone and it rings instead?</p>

<p>You act like all American schools get shot up at-least once a year or something when that&rsquo;s not even remotely close to the reality of things lmao.</p>

<p>You could go your entire education without ever having your school shot up just like most students do.</p>

<p>We are talking 0-11 school shootings a year where someone actually fires a gun and kills people, so out of the 115,000+ schools in America you might get 6 on average that have a school shooting with an active shooter.</p>

<p>Are you really saying smart phones should be allowed because 6 schools out of 115,000 have a school shooting?</p>

<p>Which is really a sign of how the media reports incidents. Yes, it absolutely happens far too much but it’s still very uncommon. The vast majority of schools are pretty safe and don’t have these incidents often, if at all.</p>

<p>The media latches on to any incident and reports it <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> for a long time afterwards. They greatly magnify how often it occurs because it gets views.</p>

<p>Of course every parent would want to know their child is safe, right away. But, ruining learning every day, for that one highly unlikely situation doesn&rsquo;t make sense. How did parents cope before phones? Apparently, they were fine.</p>

<p>I applaud every parent who actually cares for their child, and wants them to be healthy, happy adults. But, moderation/balance is part of that.</p>

      <label for="l6cjs44" class="commentText"><p>Most people are horrendously bad at evaluating risk in their daily lives. I see people doing insanely risky things without thinking twice (driving while on phone, climbing to heights without fall protection, cutting trees without proper gear or training, smoking, refusing to lockout tagout industrial equipment while servicing, etc) and then freaking out over something incredibly unlikely to happen because they saw something on the news about something that happened to someone on the other side of the country, while ignoring that the country has literally hundreds of millions of people.</p>

<p>Schools are underfunded, understaffed, and overstretched. Losing track of children happens way more than you might think it just doesn&rsquo;t make national news unless the child dies as a result.</p>

Hell, put a transmitter in the schools that triggers the mode on devices when they walk in the door. Make it optional in the phone settings and then punish those who don&rsquo;t turn it on and let the phone become a distraction.</p>

<p>The bans will get kids to hide their phones and only sneak a look now and then, which is the exact point.  Today, they just sit in class and scroll as if they have nothing better to do.</p>

I get that that’s not the case everywhere, but stuff like this will disproportionately impact disabled students who already face a whole lot of hurdles at school. One of my friends had to use their phone to contact their mom as the nurse and office would regularly not let them use the nurse’s office to take their brace off and put it back on, as their doctor recommended. Office wouldn’t let them call home, nurse wouldn’t let them call home, but what let them call home? Their cell phone.</p>

<p>I also want our children to learn. It’s vitally important.</p>

<p>Wanna know something else? This bill would also likely mean that these kids won’t have smartphones at home either. In many cases, their parents will just buy them the dumb phone and that’s all they’ll have. Which will also be better for their development and overall mental health.</p>

<p>Tbh, adults need time away from their smartphones too. They’re impacting all of us negatively.</p>

The driver won&rsquo;t do that because then they&rsquo;d be in trouble, so the kids could be standing at the stop or be stuck at school for up to an hour with no knowledge of what is going on. The stop is at the end of the street so I can&rsquo;t see if they&rsquo;ve been picked up or not and kids won&rsquo;t run back home on the off chance that will be when the bus finally comes and they miss it. At least with a cell phone we can communicate to each other about it.</p>

<p>Maybe all these &ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t used to have phones at it was fine&rdquo; replies happened at a time when schools were actually accountable for the kids but that is no longer the case. The school and bus company has basically given up and said with driver shortages you get what you get and nothing can be done.</p>

<p>Now, they tell my kid she needs to stay after school at 3:20pm. That would have NEVER happened before smartphones and the always-on world.</p>

<p>Now the band will literally just call a sectional 15 minutes into practice and have everyone stay an hour late. They KNOW the kids will just text their parents.</p>

<p>As I commented above, the kids are literally expected to use their phones in class!</p>

<p>I think the teachers will be as upset as the kids if this takes effect. Everyone has become so used to just doing things without planning ahead, assuming everyone is always connected, and has a device &hellip; it&rsquo;ll be turmoil until people re-adjust.</p>

<p>They took it away and the 6-year-old absolutely lost her shit. She was screaming at them, tears streaming about her fire engine red face, she tried to kick the dad. I know it&rsquo;s the easy way most of the time and it&rsquo;s seen as a digital pacifier but it&rsquo;s so bad to just give a young child an iPad and let them sit on it for hours and hours.</p>

<p>It’s not a good way to gauge things and to remove all obstacles just so your kid never had to be told ‘ipad time is over’ doesn’t teach your kid how to accept limits.</p>

Dont shoot your kids teenage hood in the foot by banning phones. just teach them to use it responsibly</p>

Of course they will, just as society does with current laws.

<p>The timings of such take quite a bit of wisdom of how to enact, but yes I believe keeping them from such things while they&rsquo;re, say 9 for example, is alright, but keeping it from them until they&rsquo;re 19 (or forever) is not. And I feel like you might be interpreting this as a permanent ban which wasn&rsquo;t where I was going.</p>

<p>You definitely should be banning your kids from certain things, then as they get older you patiently and prudently allow greater access. But the way you were bringing it up seems as if you shouldn&rsquo;t have any restrictions whatsoever and that&rsquo;s simply not true.</p>

<p>Here’s a few things I’d like to point out as problem areas with this as both an educator and parent:</p>

<p>Lockers:  lots of schools have done away with them.  Children rarely carry textbooks and since Covid typically have a district issued device.  Locker spaces have been removed to create wider hallways to accommodate overpopulate schools and charging zones for district devices.</p>

<p>Communication:  Yes, use the office to call home for what you need.  We already have rules for this. However, office staff leaves at the end of the student day.  Programs and activities can run into the early evening.  Kids used to be able to use pay phones to communicate with their families but now they can’t, they don’t exist.</p>

<p>Implementation:  who is going to check phones on the daily for compliance to this rule?  Is this a new job?  Is it the classroom teachers job?  Principals job?  What happens to us when we make mistakes?</p>

<p>Consequences:  we already can’t enforce any consequences for small scale infractions.  It is rare that we don’t receive parent pushback or parents telling kids not to listen anyhow.  Parents actively work to circumvent any type of behavioral modification we enact.  What do we do when kids refuse to abide by this rule and parents also refuse?  Are there monetary consequences?  Can parents be fined like in traffic court?</p>

<p>The intention is well meaning but this is truly the least of our problems.  Make phones a part of the curriculum.  Teach responsible net citizenry both at home and in school.  We have one of the most amazing technological revolutions in the history of mankind in our pockets and instead of owning it and capitalizing on it academically we just want to ban it and pretend we don’t actually have them in our pockets for 6 hours out of the day. .  It is such a shortsighted solution to such a complex problem.  All of this shit just turns into kabuki theater for the politicians and makes no real change for children .</p>

<p>Lunchtime would be the trickiest to deal with IMO. Either allow it during breaks, or don&rsquo;t allow and punish with detention if caught. Guys used to sneak dirty magazines into school, sometimes they would get caught. Same deal.</p>

<p>I think this addresses all of your points.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s unclear to me whether the proposal would allow smartphones if they are off and away, but that&rsquo;s how I would do it.</p>

We banned phones in my school the past two years, but had to make tons of exceptions because of parents complaining. Not to mention not all of the teachers were on board. So you have some teachers enforcing a policy and others ignoring it- which means students push that boundary further and further. And no, administration can&rsquo;t punish teachers for not enforcing a policy because they can&rsquo;t afford to lose educators.</p>

<p>Also, detention isn&rsquo;t a thing in my district because we don&rsquo;t have reliable after school buses and parents don&rsquo;t have transportation or are working.</p>

I’m genuinely asking, you make good points but as someone who had a flip phone in school and is in IT - it doesn’t change the fact that smartphones invite distractions at every opportunity possible.</p>

<p>Let’s do our lesson on twitter behavior turns into someone scrolling insta/tiktok because it’s literally a flip away. Why not advocate for getting back to you know, learning? If they don’t have the temptation of constantly being on the phone they can then focus on actual lesson plans, no?</p>

<p>I heard a great quote the other day about the internet before smart phones and twitter: it was something you did when your real life ended, but now it’s bled into real life. There <em>has</em> to be a disconnect so these kids can actually become themselves. In my opinion at least. Would love to hear more thoughts on this from you tho.</p>

Even if they don’t have lockers they can keep them secured in their backpacks. As soon as it’s out the teacher can simply take it up and not have to take shit or create paperwork to justify them taking away the phone.</p>

<p>Right now teachers are afraid of taking phones up due to the politics and dealing with angry parents.</p>

<p>What a hilariously bad idea. Are you an actual teacher in a secondary setting? Because if you were, you&rsquo;d know that kids by and large would abuse phone privileges if allowed to have them out.</p>

<p>At my school in a major metro, phone use is the single biggest barrier to learning. Full stop. It&rsquo;s worse than tardiness and absenteeism. I&rsquo;m constantly having to argue with kids about it and taking their phone can be an utter nightmare (I have to do it but it takes time away from the class).</p>

<p>Kids don&rsquo;t have a developed enough prefrontal cortex to inhibit addicting behaviors like this, especially since social media is designed to be as addictive as possible. We have laws protecting kids from other things that are bad for them, this should be one.</p>

<p>I fully support taking each and every phone at the beginning of class or not allowing them in school altogether. I haven&rsquo;t met one teacher who has been opposed to this. I suspect you&rsquo;re either in a specialty class of 4-5 students (Sped), you deal with kids who are too young to have them at all, or you haven&rsquo;t been in the classroom in years.</p>

      <label for="l6c2xql" class="commentText"><p>I graduated high school in the US in 2014. Phones were explicitly not allowed, and this was generally the case at all public schools. That doesn&rsquo;t mean we didn&rsquo;t have phones, or didn&rsquo;t use them. Absolutely kept my phone on me (as did all my peers) despite policy saying they needed to be in the locker. Most teachers didn&rsquo;t care as long as you weren&rsquo;t disruptive, adn if you were, they could just point to policy and say &ldquo;put it away or im taking it&rdquo;.</p>

<p>My understanding is parents got worse since then, and teachers don&rsquo;t even have the option of &ldquo;im taking it&rdquo; anymore, because parents will raise all hell, despite policy potentially still saying phones aren&rsquo;t allowed.</p>

If a college professor tried to take my phone, i&rsquo;m going to the dean. High school teachers would only take it for the period, unless it was excessive, and then it was confiscated and your parents had to come in to get it. Again, parents have gotten worse, and this works less now.</p>

<p>On the one hand, yes, it&rsquo;s probably a distraction.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we basically bought her a smartphone because the teachers started expecting her to have one!</p>

<p>The internet at the school is so blocked, whenever they had research the teacher would say &lsquo;Just go to this site from your phone&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Group projects? &lsquo;Just start a group chat now&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Whatever in-class site they use for quiz-games? Runs like shit on their chromebooks, so half the kids sign in from a phone to play in class.</p>

<p>A lot of homework, and even in school work, literally requires a smartphone!</p>

<p>Things aren&rsquo;t going back to a text book centered education no matter how much you may want that to happen.</p>

<p>These kids are going to have to interact with technology to get their work done, and right now they have an always connected smartphone as a backup, or supplementary, device to the underpowered, overmanaged, junk the school provides.</p>

<p>I just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as simple as this &lsquo;shoot from the hip&rsquo; approach needs it to be to work.</p>

      <label for="l6ce0d8" class="commentText"><p>How about you just punish the kids for using the phone in class? When I was in highschool 04-08, cellphones were becomming popular and if you got caught using it in class, they took it away, sent it to the main office, and you could pick it up at the end of the day, after detention.</p>

<p>And when you got home, your parents would discipline you further for misbehaving.</p>

<p>There is no reason we need a law about this. Let schools set their own disciplinary policies, and have parents actually parent. Yet another dumbass nanny-state law.</p>

      <label for="l6cf7ge" class="commentText"><p>There’s a huge disconnect between teenagers and the commenters here. People do not remember the time where emergencies would happen and parents would have no idea where their kid was because having a phone could lead to suspension. If you did bring your phone you had to pay someone to hold it for you outside leading to even more unnecessary costs.</p>

      <label for="l6ccv3l" class="commentText"><p>In my school, if a faculty saw a phone at any time other than lunch or after/before school they just took your phone, no questions asked. If you wanted it back, a parent had to come into the school talk to a teacher, office lady, disciplinarian, etc, to get it back. And if your parents were busy, you just didn&rsquo;t get your phone back until they weren&rsquo;t.  The problem sorted itself out pretty quick to be honest.</p>

      <label for="l6cfglf" class="commentText"><p>This won&rsquo;t happen. The genie&rsquo;s been out of the bottle too long. If you remove parental access to their kids via phones at school parents will remove the kids from that system.</p>

<p>Note this isn&rsquo;t a value judgement, just a statement of fact based on experience and personal observation. We deal with enough garbage from the school system as it is locally. If they did this we&rsquo;d just say fuck it, we&rsquo;ll home school now.</p>

What’s so hard to understand?</p>

      <label for="l6cgadp" class="commentText"><p>I was in school back in the 90&rsquo;s when there were no cell phones in schools. So, I&rsquo;m a bit old in my thinking and my first thought was, why do they even need them? The problem with that thinking is, it&rsquo;s not the 90&rsquo;s anymore, school shootings and other security problems exist in a higher number than the 90&rsquo;s, and communication saves lives.</p>

<p>So, why are dumb phones not good enough? Texting isn&rsquo;t the only way kids communicate with their parents and family (not to mention friends) they use other apps too, and parents don&rsquo;t want to pay for two lines per kid. Also, cell phone companies are phasing out flip phones/dumb phones because people just don&rsquo;t ask for them anymore. The dumb phones that are available are terrible quality. I know this because I have family that won&rsquo;t use anything else, and they complain constantly about how their dumb phone/flip phone acts up and doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>

I do not believe you need a phone in school. But on the other hand sometimes the phones save somebody from getting into trouble or getting somebody into trouble. We  just dealt with our shit. And it&rsquo;s a good thing our parents couldn&rsquo;t track us. But they trusted us for the most part.</p>

      <label for="l6cuiv5" class="commentText"><p>Why should the state limit what local school districts (or schools, or teachers) should control instead?</p>

<p>I used my smartphone and iPad daily in high school as early as 2010 and it was invaluable having the internet at my fingertips, as well as a notebook and textbook without having to physically carry around dozens of pounds of books.</p>

<p>Schools should teach kids that phones are a tool that can greatly improve productivity, rather than hide it away and let them only use it for YouTube and crappy games after school.</p>

<p>This just seems like a &ldquo;phones are bad because we don&rsquo;t want to address the root cause&rdquo; kind of stopgap solution.</p>
