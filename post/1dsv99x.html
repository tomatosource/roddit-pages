</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>To sum up the day:</p>

<p>1.) Paul George leaves the Clippers, making the Clippers picks VERY valuable: Clippers picks remaining being 2025 &amp; 2027 unprotected pick swaps(2027 from facilitating the harden deal), and a 2026 unprotected first round pick</p>

<p>2.) Certified Role players Isaiah Joe and Aaron Wiggins were signed for the long term for very reasonable deals.</p>

<p>3.) Isaiah Hartenstein signs with OKC, and fills out any weaknesses the Thunder had on the rebounding end, and solidifies the core.</p>

<p>In addition to that, Presti still has 39 PICKS from now until 2030, that’s AFTER trading 5 second round picks to get Dillon Jones in the late first round of this years draft.</p>

<p>In short: The Thunder are absolutely stacked</p>

      <label for="lb4z22g" class="commentText"><p>After blowing it up in 2019 with PG and WBrook, they were able to blow it up again in 2020, trading Chris Paul, Steven Adams, Danilo, and more. After that, they took on horrible contracts in exchange for a plethora of picks for 2 years(firsts and seconds galore), some of those bad contracts rehabilitating, then turning into more picks in trades(Al Horford for example, who when traded to us, we got a first, and got a first back when we traded him).</p>

<p>Sometimes, picks were pushed down the line for future picks when they weren’t necessary.</p>

<p>After that they took off any non-youth on the team in exchange for more picks, and rebuilt the foundation around SGA, Chet, Jdub. Presti in the meantime found role players in guys in the 2nd round, or UDFA’s(Wiggins, JWill, and Kenrich being 2nds and Joe being waived to the Thunder), hell, even Dort was a UDFA</p>

<p>Total picks</p>

<p>13 firsts</p>

<p>26 seconds</p>

<p>3 pick swaps</p>

<p>All to 2030</p>

Both the amount of picks and the young players working out that well together, that quickly &ndash; it&rsquo;s equal parts strategy and luck. Props to OKC for making it happen though.</p>

<p>But you’re totally right. Nailing essentially every top 10 pick is pretty freaking hard. Like even Giddey was a good pick, he just not good enough to take the ball out of SGA’s hands.</p>

      <label for="lb5347n" class="commentText"><p>Yeah of course, but I feel like a major part of the quick rebuild success for OKC is SGA ascending to MVP caliber within a few seasons.</p>

<p>I see other teams&rsquo; fanbases wanting OKC&rsquo;s rebuild, but most teams can&rsquo;t start their rebuild with an SGA. Nevermind drafting a Chet and Jalen Williams &ndash; NBA ready young players who fit with SGA. Great scouting and asset management, but also luck.</p>

      <label for="lb5776t" class="commentText"><p>OKC&rsquo;s rebuild was just so very far from a traditional rebuild, its hard to compare it to almost any other rebuild from the jump. They had a pretty great season overall, playoff failure aside (if they had got past Portland, I would not have been surprised if they had also beaten a young Denver team). After losing Durant they&rsquo;d won 47-48-49 games. They&rsquo;d just acquired PG and saw him finish top 3 in the MVP voting at age 28. Russ, at age 30, was still a top-10 MVP finisher.</p>

<p>And they just broke it all up. They got their future superstar going into year 2, were able to skip his rookie year entirely. If they had blown it up earlier, maybe stumbled onto SGA as a rookie going into 2018, we&rsquo;d be talking about this being a typical long build, with OKC really solidifying their competitive core for a championship run going into year 7.</p>

<p>Their whole situation was just wild right out of the gate.</p>

      <label for="lb5adjo" class="commentText"><p>As an OKC fan, moreso than that - having MVP-level RWB and PG to deal for the main bulk of their draft assets (plus replenishing their own picks which they had traded away while competing which finished with the pick that became Maxey).</p>

<p>Obviously there’s a lot of skill in drafting 2nd rounders who work out and picking the right UDFAs, making the secondary deals that continued to expand their war chest, nailing the JDub/Chet/Cason picks</p>

<p>Plus ownership buy-in, tied in with the timing that their two-year tank was during the COVID shutdown, there was luck in having the assets, plus being willing to take the plunge and not rushing a big trade to speed up the process</p>

      <label for="lb5lmwf" class="commentText"><p>Yeah. I think it’s a similar story to the Celtics—trading an aging core for a bunch of picks from a team that immediately falls into the lottery *and * then drafting well for years is tough to replicate. The value of blowing up a core while it still has trade value is an easy lesson, but the current Celtics don’t exist if the Nets refused to offer more picks, the Nets stay good longer or rebuild faster, or the Celtics draft Fultz.</p>

      <label for="lb60jj4" class="commentText"><p>Just curious, what are the 13 picks, because i went through it and i think i only saw 12.</p>

<p>2025: PHI, MIA, UTA, (best of OKC, HOU, LAC)</p>

<p>2026: Best 2 of (OKC, LAC, HOU)</p>

<p>2027: Best 2 of (OKC, DEN, LAC)</p>

<p>2028: Best 1 of (OKC, DAL)</p>

<p>2029: DEN, OKC</p>

<p>2030: OKC</p>

<p>Not to knock the value of all those picks, but I have my doubts that the Utah pick will convey (has to be outside the top 10 in 2025, or outside the top 8 in 2026, else it becomes a 2nd) because they look to be in the early stages of a rebuild, and outside of that, I don&rsquo;t really see many high lottery picks there. Of course, there&rsquo;s always a chance that a team just implodes, or that the 2026 HOU ends up 5th, or that the 2027 LAC ends up being really high, but to me it seems like the value of these picks is being really overstated.</p>

<p>At 5 seconds to a late first, they probably have 3 late firsts every year until 2030, essentially? That&rsquo;s good but idk if it&rsquo;s great. I think you could make a case that Shai alone has as much value, if not more, than the entirety of the picks. Now granted, OKC has been incredible at finding talent in the mid-late first so far, they just need that to continue for those picks to have significant value.</p>

      <label for="lb4zszt" class="commentText"><p>The Thunder&rsquo;s current roster could easily grow to be at the level of the Celtics. I think they have some similarities too.</p>

<p>SGA = Tatum - Score first elite guy who is MVP candidate<br>
Jalen Williams = Jalen Brown - 2nd option on offense that can also defend at a high level<br>
Chet = Porzingus - Dominant paint protector that can shoot 3s and score at a good clip<br>
Caruso/Dort/Wallace = Jrue and Derrick White - Smaller guards that are elite defenders and good shooters. Boston&rsquo;s guys are better obviously, but OKC has more depth there and more youth that could continue to improve.</p>

<p>Then add on guys like Isiah Joe, Aaron Wiggins and Hartenstien and OKC has a deeper bench than last year&rsquo;s Celtics.</p>

      <label for="lb4zubb" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s hard to cash in picks sometimes. Celtics had tons of picks under Ainge and we were often trying to trade multiple future picks to get into the mid-first without any bites. You also can&rsquo;t use every pick because of roster constraints and other teams know this. Finally, some of these picks are so far out that they actually will be on a different timeline than the current roster (2030 draft will be when Shai is entering his age 32 season).</p>

<p>Ignoring the picks, this is still one of the quickest rebuilds in history. Went from a perennial top 4-5 seed with Westbrook, to a top 5 seed with CP3, two bad years, a play in birth, and then a #1 seed.</p>

<p>Realistically I doubt the Utah pick conveys at all, they were a top 10 pick this year, and that was <em>before</em> they reportedly wanted to try to trade Lauri to tank. So it&rsquo;s going to be more like 3 firsts next year.</p>

Like in 2028 <a href="https://www.nba.com/thunder/news/pick-swap-240208" target="_blank">the Thunder announced that they have a pick swap from the Mavs</a> which means they will EITHER have the Thunder pick or the Mavs pick, but not both. And Fanspo lists that as 2 separate 2028 firsts, despite that being objectively incorrect.</p>

It&rsquo;s super complicated the way they show the &ldquo;chain of custody&rdquo; for each pick, but it usually has really accurate information, and it&rsquo;s nice to see what trade resulted in each pick landing where.</p>

It doesn&rsquo;t excuse their terrible management of limited assets. But the main irony is that Troy Weaver came from the OKC organization and he did a terrible job for them. Just don&rsquo;t understand the point of mocking the pistons with all given </p>

A team like the Warriors or Kings could set themselves up incredibly well for the future but instead, they are going push for a play-in and have no treasure chest of assets to help them in the future.</p>

<p>Tucker Zubac and Mann are all up after this season.</p>

<p>Harden likely returns at a lower number.</p>

<p>A lot of teams will have to do some maneuvering to make sense of the new apron and second apron rules.</p>

<p>I’m not saying things are ideal, I’m saying in a couple years they’ll have a bunch of cap space and they will be a destination team due to locale and an owner who obviously will spend any dollar possible to improve the organization from top to bottom.</p>

<p>I know I know, Clips don’t get Kawhi without PG. And we don’t have to live in revisionist history either. But having SGA for the next 15 years will always be a black eye for Ballmer and go down as a Herschel Walker type trade if OKC can start collecting some titles.</p>

I think the Clips will be in the 6-8 spot over the next few years  , which likely means a mid to late teens pick.</p>

He&rsquo;s such a good player, and he&rsquo;s going to be a fixture for All-NBA, but unless he&rsquo;s on Wemby&rsquo;s level, he&rsquo;s going to be seen as a disappointment because they constantly lopped in together</p>

      <label for="lb52p87" class="commentText"><p>Reposting here for ya:</p>

<p>After blowing it up in 2019 with PG and WBrook, they were able to blow it up again in 2020, trading Chris Paul, Steven Adams, Danilo, and more. After that, they took on horrible contracts in exchange for a plethora of picks for 2 years(firsts and seconds galore), some of those bad contracts ended up rehabilitating too, then turning into more picks in trades(Al Horford for example, who when traded to us, we got a first, and got a first back when we traded him). Additionally, extra picks we had were pushed down the line if there was no good use for them.</p>

<p>After that they took off any non-youth on the team in exchange for more picks, and rebuilt the foundation around SGA, Chet, Jdub, Presti found role players in guys in the 2nd round, or UDFA’s(Wiggins, JWill, and Kenrich being 2nds and Joe being waived to the Thunder), hell, even Dort was a UDFA</p>

<p>13 firsts</p>

<p>26 seconds</p>

<p>3 pick swaps</p>

<p>All to 2030</p>

<p> Paul George leaves the Clippers, making the Clippers picks VERY valuable: Clippers picks remaining being 2025 &amp; 2027 unprotected pick swaps(2027 from facilitating the harden deal), and a 2026 unprotected first round pick</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This part is overblown. They still have Kawhi and Harden and a great coach in Lue. They also have a front office and ownership group that has made them one of the most consistent teams in the league since Ballmer took over.</p>

<p>The worst season they&rsquo;ve had since Ballmer bought them was 42 wins and they have had the third best winning percentage in the league during that time period.</p>

<p>The idea that losing Paul George now makes them a bunch of bums is not realistic in my opinion.</p>

<p>2021-22 Kawhi missed the entire season and PG only played 31 games and they still managed to win 42 games in the west with nearly $100m in salary missing all season.</p>

<p>Are they worse on paper without PG? Yes absolutely but I still don&rsquo;t think they are a very good candidate to bottom out.</p>

      <label for="lb5xpsz" class="commentText"><p>They&rsquo;ve got a really good 2 year window until they likely lose Hartenstein to pay Chet and Jdub. Then they have 1 more year until they have to pay Shai, Cason Wallace, and Dort. After those 3 years, it&rsquo;s all on how they draft. If they keep drafting hits like Chet and Dieng they&rsquo;ll be set, if the picks look more like Ousmane Dieng and Poku, they&rsquo;ll be in trouble.</p>

<p>Also, I&rsquo;m not sure how great those Clippers picks will end up being. Yeah, PG&rsquo;s gone, but at least for the next 2 years, Harden and Kawhi should still be good players, they still have role players like Zubac and DJJ, and they have no incentive to tank, so I would be shocked if they ended up as one of the 7 worst teams either next year or the year after. At best (barring some magical lottery luck) I think you end up getting late lottery picks out of the Clippers.</p>

      <label for="lb68fzf" class="commentText"><p>I know people want them to trade all these picks for a star player, but tbh their squad is already really good and they could just keep trading away their young players for more picks down the line lol. Especially if they end up winning a championship.</p>

<p>Just this year they got Caruso for Giddey, maybe next year they trade away Cason Wallace or Lu Dort for more picks or vets. That could be the ultimate cheat code to beat the current CBA. Just accumulate so many picks that you are bound to hit on a few of them and never give out any bad contracts to guys that aren&rsquo;t worth it.</p>

<p>What makes the Thunder good is their 5 out play, Sengun can&rsquo;t shoot and is an average defender for his position.</p>

<p>Though we could have flipped him for more talent, so if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re trying to say, i&rsquo;d agree.</p>
