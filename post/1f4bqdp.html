      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1f4bqdp/whats_the_one_team_where_you_struggle_to_see_the/"><p>What&rsquo;s the one team where you struggle to see the vision for, whether it be short term or long term?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Basically asking about what&rsquo;s the team where you don&rsquo;t really understand their plan for this season or for the long term. It can be either a contender who&rsquo;s roster construction doesn&rsquo;t make sense (i&rsquo;m sure my suns will be a relatively popular choice) or a rebuilding/young team where you don&rsquo;t think that their young core is going to pan out and, outside of Capturing the Flagg, don&rsquo;t really have a clear path out of the bottom.</p>

<p>For me, it&rsquo;s the Pelicans. The offseason isn&rsquo;t over, but as of right now their front court is incredibly shallow, and are one Zion injury away from a disaster. I just have a hard time believing that this team, even if they stay healthy, can compete with the upper echelon western conference teams given their roster construction.</p>

      <label for="lkl247y" class="commentText"><p>They&rsquo;re still built around Jimmy and Jimmy is on the decline. Bam&rsquo;s great but needs someone to carry the offense. Herro hasn&rsquo;t proven he&rsquo;s that guy, and also has had too many injuries at his age.</p>

<p>JJJ fulfilled the promise of being NBA-ready as a rookie but his age makes his ceiling a big question mark. Jovic has shown some good improvement and he&rsquo;s still young.</p>

<p>I think the real problem is that they&rsquo;re in a similar position to where we were with Dame - trying to run it back to get the last out of their aging star, but not having the assets to get a true third star that they need to get back into contention. JJJ and Jovic have some value, but maybe not enough to get a guy good enough to make that leap, especially while losing both of them. Herro</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t help that their 2025 and 2027 FRP&rsquo;s only belong to them if they&rsquo;re a lotto team.</p>

For reference the only teams to be as hot as them from 3 in their past 2 ecf runs are all championship teams, u can only rely on luck for so long before it runs out</p>

I was screaming this at anyone who suggested drafting them to the Hornets. They couldn’t even hit free throws. I don’t know why anyone would expect them to turn that around.

Five years is long enough to turn things around, and they didn’t (because reasons), and that’s why they have a new coach and a new front office. I hope it all works out. They have some really athletic dudes who seem like hard workers and smart players.</p>

<p>I say all this as a Pistons fan. I still think Washington is a much hotter dumpster fire.</p>

      <label for="lkkr41t" class="commentText"><p>I agree that Washington is a bigger dumpster fire. Hell, I like Detroit better than Chicago right now. Detroit’s problem, in my opinion, is that during this entire run of top five draft picks they have taken the coveted “draft the best player available and figure it out later” approach. Hard to figure it out when only one of those players can shoot and he gets triple teamed on most possessions because there is no spacing on the floor. I like the moves they’ve made so far this off-season and I’m optimistic that they can figure it out, but man it’s been painful to watch from a distance</p>

      <label for="lkkowpz" class="commentText"><p>Think we&rsquo;re in a decent spot honestly. Barnes/Barrett/Quickley make a lot of money but non of these are contracts that we can&rsquo;t move down the line. IQ&rsquo;s contract looks big due to a lot of incentives but it&rsquo;s just 32.5M per year flat and RJ has already outplayed his contract if he can just replicate last season.</p>

<p>We have some youth in Jakobe &amp; Dick, a couple of fun projects in Mogbo/Chomche and at the very least have a temporary solution to our backup point guard situation. We might not get a top 10 pick, but we&rsquo;re definitely a lottery team that can add some more talent to this group next draft.</p>

<p>Reminds me of the early 2010s Raptors again which is actually very exciting compared to the stuff that we went through in the past 2 years.</p>

I really wish it did work because I love OG.<br>
But we were in desperate need for a PG and hes young so he can grow with Scottie.<br>
We also got 2 players for one in the OG trade. The trade that sucked ass was the Pascal trade to be honest.<br>
We should have extended him instead.<br>
But this current roster makes sense because they are banking on player development. And if they don&rsquo;t develop we can move on in 4 years. It&rsquo;s all they can do because no free agent wants to go to Toronto.<br>
What doesn&rsquo;t make sense is what&rsquo;s happening in Chicago.</p>

      <label for="lkkducs" class="commentText"><p>I mean cant these players grow in their roles?<br>
Quickly is not  fully developed player and neither is Scottie.<br>
The Raptors are banking on player development. Which is all they can do because its damn near impossible for us to attract any notable free agents.<br>
What other path is there for the Raptors to get better? You cant just keep making Kawhi like trades forever.</p>

      <label for="lkk4agt" class="commentText"><p>besides the obvious ones like the Wizards, it&rsquo;s the Cavs for me.</p>

<p>The Darius Garland/Donovan fit, as well as the Jarret Allen/Evan Mobley fit, are 2 pairings that just don&rsquo;t work. Even casuals can see it, and their team actually has a better record with injuries due to the fact that they&rsquo;re all holding each other back when healthy.</p>

<p>The team as currently constructed has won a total of 1 playoff series in 2 years, and it happened to be against the Magic (probably the weakest team in the playoffs this year, the most inexperienced, and the matchup they specifically hunted for in the seedings). They need to make some trades, and pick up some badly needed wings.</p>

<p>And yet the only move theyve made this offseason, is to extend all their players. They didnt trade Garland, they didn&rsquo;t trade Allen, they didn&rsquo;t sign any new wings. They&rsquo;re literally running it back with perhaps the most flawed roster in the league relative to their talent level. There might be some hope for the frontcourt if Mobley develops his outside game, but I truly think the Garland/Mitchell backcourt will never work and they should trade Garland for a high quality wing</p>

<p>I also don’t mind keeping Allen because u can always just trade him as opposed to losing him for nothing. Imo they gotta trade Allen for a wing.</p>

<p>They are both ball dominant, and are defensive liabilities. Donovan’s defense got better but there is still a huge switchability issue. And if you have 2 unswitchable guards on defense, you have a huge issue come the playoffs</p>

      <label for="lkl0f9w" class="commentText"><p>I mean the Lakers had a ton of young guys that u could see either becoming really good or at the very least u could use them to trade for a star. LeBron went there cus of his kids and brand deals not everyone is LeBron and wants to work in Hollywood and AD wanted to go there cus of LeBron. Going forward the Lakers don&rsquo;t really have assets to trade for a star player so they&rsquo;re gonna rely on AD plus role players once LeBron retires and very little assets to get better since AD should be good enough to keep them semi afloat so a lot of their picks going forward are gonna be late lottery or around that area. It&rsquo;s also way harder to go to a team like the Lakers cus u can lose out on possibly dozens of millions of dollars if ur a superstar and leave in FA. I also generally don&rsquo;t see many guys who would wanna go to LA maybe someone like LaMelo but he&rsquo;s probably better off in Charlotte at this point</p>

Murray is a one time allstar who made an all defensive team, Ingram was MIP and a one time allstar, McCollum has scored 20ppg for 9 straight seasons, Herb Jones is 1st team all defense, and Trey Murphy is a 6’10 wing who can be a 50-40-90 guy. And then Zion himself. That’s a lot of talent. The issue is how it fits</p>

<p>They do still have all their own picks and a couple other assets to move, plus the whole Ingram/mccollum fit issue. I’m fairly certain we will see them make a move.</p>

      <label for="lkkkyay" class="commentText"><p>Zion is the #1 guy and he’s going to play the majority of his minutes at the 4. So back up 4 is not all that important IMO. You also have 6’10” Murphy (no I don’t think there is a chance they move him) and 6’9” Ingram, and you have Herb Jones who can guard 1-4. All big long defenders. Add Dejounte Murray at guard, who isn’t super big for his position but is very long as well. That’s a lot of perimeter size.</p>

<p>CJ McCollum and Alvarado and their first round pick from last year Jordan Hawkins, all will get minutes at guard. That’s already 8 players and I haven’t mentioned a single big man other than Zion, so I wouldn’t say they are thin anywhere other than at the 5.</p>

<p>They signed Theis, he’s not a starting level guy but he’s good enough to be a rotation big. Hes played 15-20mpg for his career on good teams. Then they have 4 other guys who are question marks: a first round pick, couple second round picks, and a 2-way guy. Best case scenario imo two of those guys are good enough to get 15-25 mins, worst case they are all liabilities on the court in different ways.</p>

<p>So yea they really need a 5 to make things make sense, but at the same time, they have a lot 1-4.</p>

      <label for="lkl0hvv" class="commentText"><p>Back up 4 is definitely important unless you want Zion playing 40 MPG, but yeah it probably makes sense just to have Murphy or Herb take those minutes when he&rsquo;s on the bench. I think BI is too skinny to play the 4 IMO.</p>

<p>But still, the reason I don&rsquo;t see the vision for the Pels isn&rsquo;t because I think the pieces they have are bad, I just think it&rsquo;s incomplete. of the 8 guy you listed, 7 of them are either guards or wings. I know Jonas and Nance weren&rsquo;t some elite center combo, but replacing them with Daniel Theis and 4 question marks is still a downgrade.</p>

<p>The pelicans don’t have a center and got CJ Murray and Ingram who wants to dribble a lot and take tough jumpers. Trey and Herb should play 35 minutes a night but got guys blocking that from happening. I guess they want to play small but doesn’t have the shooting or switchable guys</p>

<p>The warriors got a lot of players but I’m not sure how they can play them in the same lineups consistently. Kuminga should be a huge part but him and Draymond play the same position. Dray at the 5 full time is weird and if they start TJD they will have no shooting</p>

<p>My choice here is the Kings.  The Derozan addition makes no sense.  No one plays defense of the 3 main guys, and they have to pray Fox’s last year from 3 isn’t an aberration, else their top 3 will not be floor spacers.  Even <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> seems like a bad ratio in the modern NBA.</p>

It is this mix of old heads led by Lebron, who cannot bring you to any meaningful wins, together with questionable young guys to build around, like Reaves or Rui. Didn&rsquo;t understand them a bit since 2021 summer, only good move made since was shipping away Westbrook.</p>

<p>Other than that I will say also the Kings seems to me stuck in the middle, but maybe Murray will make a jump next year and will become a 4th star on that team (assuming DeRozan being the 3rd). In that case I will reconsider them, till now I just keep seeing them as a 6th-8th seed.</p>

Maybe their pick pans out but I just don&rsquo;t see what they&rsquo;re going for if they want Trae to have the best experience possible in ATL.

      <label for="lkl4hd7" class="commentText"><p>When healthy, the Pelicans have been a top 4 seed (the 2 seed 2 seasons ago before Z injury and 4 seed before BI injury this previous season. The core is essentially still the same + DJM and - Jonas. Losing Jonas hurts, but they&rsquo;ve got Theis who can give you some solid rotational minutes and 3 other dudes who are question marks but hopefully one of them can at least give rotational minutes. Now I am 100% biased, I need to acknowledged that, but I do believe the team has improved despite having a hole at C. But the hole can be filled by a CBC (Center By Commitee), they don&rsquo;t need to be elite or even good tbh, just serviceable. The defense will be fine, it was top 10 last year with a lineup of CJ-Herb-BI-Z-Val (BI and Z did improve on that end to slightly below average-average depending on how generous you want to be) but with adding DJM to the lineup hopefully it improves at best or stays the same at worst, so that&rsquo;s not a worry, and the offense should hypothetically get better with the addition of DJM although I could see it getting slightly worse for the first couple months till they figure out the pecking order. Only team I would fear if the pels stay healthy enough to make the playoffs and assuming relatively healthy in playoffs is the Nuggets and, to a lesser degree, the Thunder. In a 7 game series I have faith the Pels can win against any other team. Only concerns are rebounding (which might not be as bad as I fear it may be) and  health which is sadly always a concern when it comes to the Pelicans</p>

It doesn’t fit, you’d have to be so optimistic to think that those 3 together won’t cause spacing issues. It just seems like a capped ceiling on offense and also a capped ceiling on defense.</p>

<p>Memphis… I don’t get why they were so adamant that dillon brooks couldn’t come back. But then got almost a dillon Brooks clone as a sg. Marcus Smart has the same weaknesses dillon brooks has. He has horrible shot selection and is a below avg 3 pt shooter. He’s also undersized to guard wings for a whole season.</p>

<p>Toronto. I don’t get why they shipped out og anunoby just to grab rj barrett and quickley. Paying quickley seemed like a overpay. If you’re gonna pay quickley that much then I’d rather just max OG. OG was a great fit alongside scottie Barnes, really a head scratcher from masai. They are also too bad to compete but also too good to tank. Definitely don’t like the future for Toronto as of now.</p>
