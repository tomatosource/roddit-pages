      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1f4bqdp/whats_the_one_team_where_you_struggle_to_see_the/"><p>What&rsquo;s the one team where you struggle to see the vision for, whether it be short term or long term?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Basically asking about what&rsquo;s the team where you don&rsquo;t really understand their plan for this season or for the long term. It can be either a contender who&rsquo;s roster construction doesn&rsquo;t make sense (i&rsquo;m sure my suns will be a relatively popular choice) or a rebuilding/young team where you don&rsquo;t think that their young core is going to pan out and, outside of Capturing the Flagg, don&rsquo;t really have a clear path out of the bottom.</p>

<p>For me, it&rsquo;s the Pelicans. The offseason isn&rsquo;t over, but as of right now their front court is incredibly shallow, and are one Zion injury away from a disaster. I just have a hard time believing that this team, even if they stay healthy, can compete with the upper echelon western conference teams given their roster construction.</p>

<p>The sad thing is our sub is overrun by Masai stans, can&rsquo;t even criticize him.

      <label for="lkk4agt" class="commentText"><p>besides the obvious ones like the Wizards, it&rsquo;s the Cavs for me.</p>

<p>The Darius Garland/Donovan fit, as well as the Jarret Allen/Evan Mobley fit, are 2 pairings that just don&rsquo;t work. Even casuals can see it, and their team actually has a better record with injuries due to the fact that they&rsquo;re all holding each other back when healthy.</p>

<p>The team as currently constructed has won a total of 1 playoff series in 2 years, and it happened to be against the Magic (probably the weakest team in the playoffs this year, the most inexperienced, and the matchup they specifically hunted for in the seedings). They need to make some trades, and pick up some badly needed wings.</p>

<p>And yet the only move theyve made this offseason, is to extend all their players. They didnt trade Garland, they didn&rsquo;t trade Allen, they didn&rsquo;t sign any new wings. They&rsquo;re literally running it back with perhaps the most flawed roster in the league relative to their talent level. There might be some hope for the frontcourt if Mobley develops his outside game, but I truly think the Garland/Mitchell backcourt will never work and they should trade Garland for a high quality wing</p>

<p>I also don’t mind keeping Allen because u can always just trade him as opposed to losing him for nothing. Imo they gotta trade Allen for a wing.</p>

<p>They are both ball dominant, and are defensive liabilities. Donovan’s defense got better but there is still a huge switchability issue. And if you have 2 unswitchable guards on defense, you have a huge issue come the playoffs</p>

Murray is a one time allstar who made an all defensive team, Ingram was MIP and a one time allstar, McCollum has scored 20ppg for 9 straight seasons, Herb Jones is 1st team all defense, and Trey Murphy is a 6’10 wing who can be a 50-40-90 guy. And then Zion himself. That’s a lot of talent. The issue is how it fits</p>

      <label for="lkk7a55" class="commentText"><p>The hope is Zion can still be a top 10 guy. Definitely possible still but this year is pivotal, he has to build off last season.</p>

<p>They do still have all their own picks and a couple other assets to move, plus the whole Ingram/mccollum fit issue. I’m fairly certain we will see them make a move.</p>

      <label for="lkk9048" class="commentText"><p>Pelicans are certainly a team in a transitionary period right now but people seem to forget they were a top 4 seed before Ingram went down last season with the knee. The season prior, they were I believe the second seed before Zion went down. With health, they&rsquo;re gonna be up there this season.</p>

      <label for="lkk3mv1" class="commentText"><p>Sacramento 100%. I have no idea why many fans are hyped about a sabonis-derozan-fox trio. It doesn’t fit, you’d have to be so optimistic to think that those 3 together won’t cause spacing issues. It just seems like a capped ceiling on offense and also a capped ceiling on defense.</p>

<p>Memphis… I don’t get why they were so adamant that dillon brooks couldn’t come back. But then got almost a dillon Brooks clone as a sg. Marcus Smart has the same weaknesses dillon brooks has. He has horrible shot selection and is a below avg 3 pt shooter. He’s also undersized to guard wings for a whole season.</p>

<p>Toronto. I don’t get why they shipped out og anunoby just to grab rj barrett and quickley. Paying quickley seemed like a overpay. If you’re gonna pay quickley that much then I’d rather just max OG. OG was a great fit alongside scottie Barnes, really a head scratcher from masai. They are also too bad to compete but also too good to tank. Definitely don’t like the future for Toronto as of now.</p>

      <label for="lkk9fjg" class="commentText"><p>Because the Kings went through a playoff drought so long that it was old enough to get a driver&rsquo;s license. They know they don&rsquo;t have a championship caliber team, but there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with having a decent fun team. Everybody is too focused on championship or tank, while us Sacramento bros are just happy to have a team over 500.</p>

      <label for="lkk5mnz" class="commentText"><p>RJ and Quickley are probably not in Raptor&rsquo;s long term plan. The plan right now is wait for Scottie to develop, draft one or two lottery prospects and fire sell everything else (potentially including the aforememtioned 2 guys) to get a championship window for a couple of years.</p>
