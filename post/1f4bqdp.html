</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Basically asking about what&rsquo;s the team where you don&rsquo;t really understand their plan for this season or for the long term. It can be either a contender who&rsquo;s roster construction doesn&rsquo;t make sense (i&rsquo;m sure my suns will be a relatively popular choice) or a rebuilding/young team where you don&rsquo;t think that their young core is going to pan out and, outside of Capturing the Flagg, don&rsquo;t really have a clear path out of the bottom.</p>

<p>For me, it&rsquo;s the Pelicans. The offseason isn&rsquo;t over, but as of right now their front court is incredibly shallow, and are one Zion injury away from a disaster. I just have a hard time believing that this team, even if they stay healthy, can compete with the upper echelon western conference teams given their roster construction.</p>

One window closing doesn’t matter as much when a team is really good at opening a new one</p>

<p>Pat Riley and Erik Spoelstra are just elite</p>

      <label for="lkky76q" class="commentText"><p>Idk about that Spoelstra is maybe the best coach in the league but if u look at their runs they get historically hot from 3 which obviously spo is putting them in the best positions but no matter how good u are those kinds of things are out of ur hands. For reference the only teams to be as hot as them from 3 in their past 2 ecf runs are all championship teams, u can only rely on luck for so long before it runs out</p>

The years they have made runs tho they shoot extremely well and the years where they fizzle out early they don&rsquo;t shoot very well or are injured like this past year</p>

      <label for="lkl247y" class="commentText"><p>They&rsquo;re still built around Jimmy and Jimmy is on the decline. Bam&rsquo;s great but needs someone to carry the offense. Herro hasn&rsquo;t proven he&rsquo;s that guy, and also has had too many injuries at his age.</p>

<p>JJJ fulfilled the promise of being NBA-ready as a rookie but his age makes his ceiling a big question mark. Jovic has shown some good improvement and he&rsquo;s still young.</p>

<p>I think the real problem is that they&rsquo;re in a similar position to where we were with Dame - trying to run it back to get the last out of their aging star, but not having the assets to get a true third star that they need to get back into contention. JJJ and Jovic have some value, but maybe not enough to get a guy good enough to make that leap, especially while losing both of them. Herro</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t help that their 2025 and 2027 FRP&rsquo;s only belong to them if they&rsquo;re a lotto team.</p>

<p>Shame Lavine really couldn’t get past that injury bug, he should’ve been on the floor way more often with the skill set he has. That one season he finished with 27 a game on over 50% shooting for them… the guy def has it, that special it factor, but is being held back by injuries.</p>

      <label for="lkkowpz" class="commentText"><p>Think we&rsquo;re in a decent spot honestly. Barnes/Barrett/Quickley make a lot of money but non of these are contracts that we can&rsquo;t move down the line. IQ&rsquo;s contract looks big due to a lot of incentives but it&rsquo;s just 32.5M per year flat and RJ has already outplayed his contract if he can just replicate last season.</p>

<p>We have some youth in Jakobe &amp; Dick, a couple of fun projects in Mogbo/Chomche and at the very least have a temporary solution to our backup point guard situation. We might not get a top 10 pick, but we&rsquo;re definitely a lottery team that can add some more talent to this group next draft.</p>

<p>Reminds me of the early 2010s Raptors again which is actually very exciting compared to the stuff that we went through in the past 2 years.</p>

<p>We believe we have a top two way player in Scottie.</p>

<p>Quickley and Barrett are both starter caliber players that are the same age as Scottie.</p>

<p>Everyone else is in try out phase.</p>

<p>Hopefully we dont fool ourselves and tank this year. We&rsquo;re one starter level player from competing in 2 seasons</p>

      <label for="lkkflfq" class="commentText"><p>See how Barnes and Quickley develop this year with bigger roles as leaders of the team for a full season. If RJ continues his positive play that he showed last year in the new system (21/6/4) then that&rsquo;s a nice bonus as well.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the main focus this year + giving guys like Dick and Walter a good chunk of minutes will allow for development and likely another high draft pick in a projected load class.</p>

I really wish it did work because I love OG.<br>
But we were in desperate need for a PG and hes young so he can grow with Scottie.<br>
We also got 2 players for one in the OG trade. The trade that sucked ass was the Pascal trade to be honest.<br>
We should have extended him instead.<br>
But this current roster makes sense because they are banking on player development. And if they don&rsquo;t develop we can move on in 4 years. It&rsquo;s all they can do because no free agent wants to go to Toronto.<br>
What doesn&rsquo;t make sense is what&rsquo;s happening in Chicago.</p>

Tyrese is cartoon-character ridiculously quick off the dribble, while Quick is crafty and speedy but not fast enough to get by people off his speed alone. He’s gonna have to become one of the most elite ball handlers/shooters in the league to reach Maxey’s level in my opinion. Not saying he can’t do it either</p>

      <label for="lkkqvpv" class="commentText"><p>That’s fair. JV was the only real head scratcher here, but they got him cheap and having a decent center helps with development. Brogdan came with picks. I guess the Bulls are the only real answer for me. The vision is that Reinsdorf is too old to agree to a rebuild.</p>

Five years is long enough to turn things around, and they didn’t (because reasons), and that’s why they have a new coach and a new front office. I hope it all works out. They have some really athletic dudes who seem like hard workers and smart players.</p>

<p>I say all this as a Pistons fan. I still think Washington is a much hotter dumpster fire.</p>

      <label for="lkkr41t" class="commentText"><p>I agree that Washington is a bigger dumpster fire. Hell, I like Detroit better than Chicago right now. Detroit’s problem, in my opinion, is that during this entire run of top five draft picks they have taken the coveted “draft the best player available and figure it out later” approach. Hard to figure it out when only one of those players can shoot and he gets triple teamed on most possessions because there is no spacing on the floor. I like the moves they’ve made so far this off-season and I’m optimistic that they can figure it out, but man it’s been painful to watch from a distance</p>

I just don&rsquo;t see them changing the franchise around with this lineup. It&rsquo;s a good group, but a ragtag group in my opinion. Maybe their pick pans out but I just don&rsquo;t see what they&rsquo;re going for if they want Trae to have the best experience possible in ATL. Like I watched Vit Krejci cook my team but like what is that really gonna get you long term? Saddiq I miss you tho</p>

      <label for="lklz73w" class="commentText"><p>As a fan I’ll tell you that the vision from ownership is make as much profit as possible so in that regard they’re succeeding.</p>

<p>On court I think this is almost a make a break year and there are two things that will define it: the progress of Jalen Johnson and how Risaccher looks in the NBA. There’s a chance that Johnson could have a monster breakout season and be the #2 that Trae has wanted. If so that opens up a lot of possibilities. Especially if ZR looks like he’ll develop well.</p>

<p>If neither of those things happen though I expect big changes in the off season.</p>

      <label for="lkl0f9w" class="commentText"><p>I mean the Lakers had a ton of young guys that u could see either becoming really good or at the very least u could use them to trade for a star. LeBron went there cus of his kids and brand deals not everyone is LeBron and wants to work in Hollywood and AD wanted to go there cus of LeBron. Going forward the Lakers don&rsquo;t really have assets to trade for a star player so they&rsquo;re gonna rely on AD plus role players once LeBron retires and very little assets to get better since AD should be good enough to keep them semi afloat so a lot of their picks going forward are gonna be late lottery or around that area. It&rsquo;s also way harder to go to a team like the Lakers cus u can lose out on possibly dozens of millions of dollars if ur a superstar and leave in FA. I also generally don&rsquo;t see many guys who would wanna go to LA maybe someone like LaMelo but he&rsquo;s probably better off in Charlotte at this point</p>

      <label for="lkk4agt" class="commentText"><p>besides the obvious ones like the Wizards, it&rsquo;s the Cavs for me.</p>

<p>The Darius Garland/Donovan fit, as well as the Jarret Allen/Evan Mobley fit, are 2 pairings that just don&rsquo;t work. Even casuals can see it, and their team actually has a better record with injuries due to the fact that they&rsquo;re all holding each other back when healthy.</p>

<p>The team as currently constructed has won a total of 1 playoff series in 2 years, and it happened to be against the Magic (probably the weakest team in the playoffs this year, the most inexperienced, and the matchup they specifically hunted for in the seedings). They need to make some trades, and pick up some badly needed wings.</p>

<p>And yet the only move theyve made this offseason, is to extend all their players. They didnt trade Garland, they didn&rsquo;t trade Allen, they didn&rsquo;t sign any new wings. They&rsquo;re literally running it back with perhaps the most flawed roster in the league relative to their talent level. There might be some hope for the frontcourt if Mobley develops his outside game, but I truly think the Garland/Mitchell backcourt will never work and they should trade Garland for a high quality wing</p>

<p>I also don’t mind keeping Allen because u can always just trade him as opposed to losing him for nothing. Imo they gotta trade Allen for a wing.</p>

<p>They are both ball dominant, and are defensive liabilities. Donovan’s defense got better but there is still a huge switchability issue. And if you have 2 unswitchable guards on defense, you have a huge issue come the playoffs</p>

<p>Getting Wemby literally changes the course of the franchise.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s teams like the Hawks or Jazz that baffle me.</p>

<p>Just so CONTENT to always be a borderline play-in team.</p>

      <label for="lkk37o9" class="commentText"><p>The Pels are my answer as well. Even if Zion is healthy this team is a first round exit in the west. There is just not enough talent there. The fact that CJ McCollum and Dejounte Murray have been their &ldquo;big moves&rdquo; in the Zion era is kind of depressing</p>

      <label for="lkk554o" class="commentText"><p>I disagree that there is a lack of talent. Murray is a one time allstar who made an all defensive team, Ingram was MIP and a one time allstar, McCollum has scored 20ppg for 9 straight seasons, Herb Jones is 1st team all defense, and Trey Murphy is a 6’10 wing who can be a 50-40-90 guy. And then Zion himself. That’s a lot of talent. The issue is how it fits</p>

<p>They do still have all their own picks and a couple other assets to move, plus the whole Ingram/mccollum fit issue. I’m fairly certain we will see them make a move.</p>

      <label for="lkka5d2" class="commentText"><p>yeah he was great last year (and healthy) and that makes everything better. the issue for me is their front court after Zion, even at PF, is really thin. the easiest solution would be trading BI, but his market seems to be really low. would they move on from someone like Trey Murphy?</p>

      <label for="lkkkyay" class="commentText"><p>Zion is the #1 guy and he’s going to play the majority of his minutes at the 4. So back up 4 is not all that important IMO. You also have 6’10” Murphy (no I don’t think there is a chance they move him) and 6’9” Ingram, and you have Herb Jones who can guard 1-4. All big long defenders. Add Dejounte Murray at guard, who isn’t super big for his position but is very long as well. That’s a lot of perimeter size.</p>

<p>CJ McCollum and Alvarado and their first round pick from last year Jordan Hawkins, all will get minutes at guard. That’s already 8 players and I haven’t mentioned a single big man other than Zion, so I wouldn’t say they are thin anywhere other than at the 5.</p>

<p>They signed Theis, he’s not a starting level guy but he’s good enough to be a rotation big. Hes played 15-20mpg for his career on good teams. Then they have 4 other guys who are question marks: a first round pick, couple second round picks, and a 2-way guy. Best case scenario imo two of those guys are good enough to get 15-25 mins, worst case they are all liabilities on the court in different ways.</p>

<p>So yea they really need a 5 to make things make sense, but at the same time, they have a lot 1-4.</p>

      <label for="lkl0hvv" class="commentText"><p>Back up 4 is definitely important unless you want Zion playing 40 MPG, but yeah it probably makes sense just to have Murphy or Herb take those minutes when he&rsquo;s on the bench. I think BI is too skinny to play the 4 IMO.</p>

<p>But still, the reason I don&rsquo;t see the vision for the Pels isn&rsquo;t because I think the pieces they have are bad, I just think it&rsquo;s incomplete. of the 8 guy you listed, 7 of them are either guards or wings. I know Jonas and Nance weren&rsquo;t some elite center combo, but replacing them with Daniel Theis and 4 question marks is still a downgrade.</p>

<p>The pelicans don’t have a center and got CJ Murray and Ingram who wants to dribble a lot and take tough jumpers. Trey and Herb should play 35 minutes a night but got guys blocking that from happening. I guess they want to play small but doesn’t have the shooting or switchable guys</p>

<p>The warriors got a lot of players but I’m not sure how they can play them in the same lineups consistently. Kuminga should be a huge part but him and Draymond play the same position. Dray at the 5 full time is weird and if they start TJD they will have no shooting</p>

      <label for="lkl4hd7" class="commentText"><p>When healthy, the Pelicans have been a top 4 seed (the 2 seed 2 seasons ago before Z injury and 4 seed before BI injury this previous season. The core is essentially still the same + DJM and - Jonas. Losing Jonas hurts, but they&rsquo;ve got Theis who can give you some solid rotational minutes and 3 other dudes who are question marks but hopefully one of them can at least give rotational minutes. Now I am 100% biased, I need to acknowledged that, but I do believe the team has improved despite having a hole at C. But the hole can be filled by a CBC (Center By Commitee), they don&rsquo;t need to be elite or even good tbh, just serviceable. The defense will be fine, it was top 10 last year with a lineup of CJ-Herb-BI-Z-Val (BI and Z did improve on that end to slightly below average-average depending on how generous you want to be) but with adding DJM to the lineup hopefully it improves at best or stays the same at worst, so that&rsquo;s not a worry, and the offense should hypothetically get better with the addition of DJM although I could see it getting slightly worse for the first couple months till they figure out the pecking order. Only team I would fear if the pels stay healthy enough to make the playoffs and assuming relatively healthy in playoffs is the Nuggets and, to a lesser degree, the Thunder. In a 7 game series I have faith the Pels can win against any other team. Only concerns are rebounding (which might not be as bad as I fear it may be) and  health which is sadly always a concern when it comes to the Pelicans</p>

On top of that, they&rsquo;re still cheaping out. Not as much as they used to, to be fair, but still unforgivable considering this is probably the end of Jokic&rsquo;s peak. This backup center cycle costs them 2nd round picks, both to be acquired and also to be dumped, and they never play that center anyway! For a needlessly frugal team trying to work the margins on these lower-end deals, what a stupid set of circumstances to navigate every year</p>

      <label for="lkm6hxu" class="commentText"><p>My Chicago Bulls because we aren&rsquo;t going to be in the bottom seed. We are too good for that but we also aren&rsquo;t competing for a playoff/playin spot so short term I don&rsquo;t get it. That&rsquo;s without mentioning the pure fumbling that was the AC trade or our dumbasses not trading number 11 at the deadline. I understand that we can&rsquo;t trade zach rn but tbh I&rsquo;m in favor of trading away our young core and hitting the mega reset. I love coby and ayo but they are too good in the sense that we can&rsquo;t fully bottom out but neither of them are going to be our future when it comes to contending.</p>

<p>A non young mediocre roster is about the worst state you want to be in with the way US sports is organised. EIther be bad, but young with potential or be actually good. SOmetimes you know there is a shot of a team surviving a couple of these seasons and build a new window, but for the Bulls I have little faith.</p>

<p>My choice here is the Kings.  The Derozan addition makes no sense.  No one plays defense of the 3 main guys, and they have to pray Fox’s last year from 3 isn’t an aberration, else their top 3 will not be floor spacers.  Even <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> seems like a bad ratio in the modern NBA.</p>

      <label for="lkmvldi" class="commentText"><p>Warriors had a bit of a weird off-season so far. It is highly likely that they&rsquo;re waiting to see if a legit secondary option to support Curry might come available before the Feb trade deadline. It is also highly likely they&rsquo;ll screw it up and miss out on the opportunity itself (like with Siakam). But I wouldn&rsquo;t exactly say they don&rsquo;t have a vision for the foreseeable future. Whether they&rsquo;ll succeed is another matter.</p>

<p>And the Lakers are the Lakers. They don&rsquo;t really &ldquo;need&rdquo; a vision. They&rsquo;re always making money and there will always be high value players wanting to go to LA. I&rsquo;m guessing they&rsquo;re happy to have LeBron and will still be aiming for a play-in spot with the off chance of getting a decent play-off run.</p>

<p>The Heat. Yep.</p>

      <label for="lkkmjat" class="commentText"><p>Most of the 30 teams. But honestly right now Lakers are the weirdest. It is this mix of old heads led by Lebron, who cannot bring you to any meaningful wins, together with questionable young guys to build around, like Reaves or Rui. Didn&rsquo;t understand them a bit since 2021 summer, only good move made since was shipping away Westbrook.</p>

<p>Other than that I will say also the Kings seems to me stuck in the middle, but maybe Murray will make a jump next year and will become a 4th star on that team (assuming DeRozan being the 3rd). In that case I will reconsider them, till now I just keep seeing them as a 6th-8th seed.</p>

      <label for="lkk3mv1" class="commentText"><p>Sacramento 100%. I have no idea why many fans are hyped about a sabonis-derozan-fox trio. It doesn’t fit, you’d have to be so optimistic to think that those 3 together won’t cause spacing issues. It just seems like a capped ceiling on offense and also a capped ceiling on defense.</p>

<p>Memphis… I don’t get why they were so adamant that dillon brooks couldn’t come back. But then got almost a dillon Brooks clone as a sg. Marcus Smart has the same weaknesses dillon brooks has. He has horrible shot selection and is a below avg 3 pt shooter. He’s also undersized to guard wings for a whole season.</p>

<p>Toronto. I don’t get why they shipped out og anunoby just to grab rj barrett and quickley. Paying quickley seemed like a overpay. If you’re gonna pay quickley that much then I’d rather just max OG. OG was a great fit alongside scottie Barnes, really a head scratcher from masai. They are also too bad to compete but also too good to tank. Definitely don’t like the future for Toronto as of now.</p>
