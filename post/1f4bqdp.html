      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1f4bqdp/whats_the_one_team_where_you_struggle_to_see_the/"><p>What&rsquo;s the one team where you struggle to see the vision for, whether it be short term or long term?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Basically asking about what&rsquo;s the team where you don&rsquo;t really understand their plan for this season or for the long term. It can be either a contender who&rsquo;s roster construction doesn&rsquo;t make sense (i&rsquo;m sure my suns will be a relatively popular choice) or a rebuilding/young team where you don&rsquo;t think that their young core is going to pan out and, outside of Capturing the Flagg, don&rsquo;t really have a clear path out of the bottom.</p>

<p>For me, it&rsquo;s the Pelicans. The offseason isn&rsquo;t over, but as of right now their front court is incredibly shallow, and are one Zion injury away from a disaster. I just have a hard time believing that this team, even if they stay healthy, can compete with the upper echelon western conference teams given their roster construction.</p>

I really wish it did work because I love OG.<br>
But we were in desperate need for a PG and hes young so he can grow with Scottie.<br>
We also got 2 players for one in the OG trade. The trade that sucked ass was the Pascal trade to be honest.<br>
We should have extended him instead.<br>
But this current roster makes sense because they are banking on player development. And if they don&rsquo;t develop we can move on in 4 years. It&rsquo;s all they can do because no free agent wants to go to Toronto.<br>
What doesn&rsquo;t make sense is what&rsquo;s happening in Chicago.</p>

<p>IQ was in a position the team needed and had a little bit of upside in terms of seeing what we can unlock from him in a starting role.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the main focus this year + giving guys like Dick and Walter a good chunk of minutes will allow for development and likely another high draft pick in a projected load class.</p>

Quickly is not  fully developed player and neither is Scottie.<br>
The Raptors are banking on player development. Which is all they can do because its damn near impossible for us to attract any notable free agents.<br>
What other path is there for the Raptors to get better? You cant just keep making Kawhi like trades forever.</p>

      <label for="lkk4agt" class="commentText"><p>besides the obvious ones like the Wizards, it&rsquo;s the Cavs for me.</p>

<p>The Darius Garland/Donovan fit, as well as the Jarret Allen/Evan Mobley fit, are 2 pairings that just don&rsquo;t work. Even casuals can see it, and their team actually has a better record with injuries due to the fact that they&rsquo;re all holding each other back when healthy.</p>

<p>The team as currently constructed has won a total of 1 playoff series in 2 years, and it happened to be against the Magic (probably the weakest team in the playoffs this year, the most inexperienced, and the matchup they specifically hunted for in the seedings). They need to make some trades, and pick up some badly needed wings.</p>

<p>And yet the only move theyve made this offseason, is to extend all their players. They didnt trade Garland, they didn&rsquo;t trade Allen, they didn&rsquo;t sign any new wings. They&rsquo;re literally running it back with perhaps the most flawed roster in the league relative to their talent level. There might be some hope for the frontcourt if Mobley develops his outside game, but I truly think the Garland/Mitchell backcourt will never work and they should trade Garland for a high quality wing</p>

<p>I also don’t mind keeping Allen because u can always just trade him as opposed to losing him for nothing. Imo they gotta trade Allen for a wing.</p>

<p>They are both ball dominant, and are defensive liabilities. Donovan’s defense got better but there is still a huge switchability issue. And if you have 2 unswitchable guards on defense, you have a huge issue come the playoffs</p>

Murray is a one time allstar who made an all defensive team, Ingram was MIP and a one time allstar, McCollum has scored 20ppg for 9 straight seasons, Herb Jones is 1st team all defense, and Trey Murphy is a 6’10 wing who can be a 50-40-90 guy. And then Zion himself. That’s a lot of talent. The issue is how it fits</p>

      <label for="lkkkyay" class="commentText"><p>Zion is the #1 guy and he’s going to play the majority of his minutes at the 4. So back up 4 is not all that important IMO. You also have 6’10” Murphy (no I don’t think there is a chance they move him) and 6’9” Ingram, and you have Herb Jones who can guard 1-4. All big long defenders. Add Dejounte Murray at guard, who isn’t super big for his position but is very long as well. That’s a lot of perimeter size.</p>

<p>CJ McCollum and Alvarado and their first round pick from last year Jordan Hawkins, all will get minutes at guard. That’s already 8 players and I haven’t mentioned a single big man other than Zion, so I wouldn’t say they are thin anywhere other than at the 5.</p>

<p>They signed Theis, he’s not a starting level guy but he’s good enough to be a rotation big. Hes played 15-20mpg for his career on good teams. Then they have 4 other guys who are question marks: a first round pick, couple second round picks, and a 2-way guy. Best case scenario imo two of those guys are good enough to get 15-25 mins, worst case they are all liabilities on the court in different ways.</p>

<p>So yea they really need a 5 to make things make sense, but at the same time, they have a lot 1-4.</p>

Gave up all their draft picks stuck in purgatory, lost a very tradable asset in PG this year cas they legitimately thought they were going to win it all before trade deadline. But ya they do have the richest owner by far I’ll give them that.</p>

      <label for="lkkb3n2" class="commentText"><p>People are saying a bunch of tanking teams where the vision should be obvious: they will tank for a good pick.</p>

<p>My choice here is the Kings.  The Derozan addition makes no sense.  No one plays defense of the 3 main guys, and they have to pray Fox’s last year from 3 isn’t an aberration, else their top 3 will not be floor spacers.  Even <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> seems like a bad ratio in the modern NBA.</p>

      <label for="lkk3mv1" class="commentText"><p>Sacramento 100%. I have no idea why many fans are hyped about a sabonis-derozan-fox trio. It doesn’t fit, you’d have to be so optimistic to think that those 3 together won’t cause spacing issues. It just seems like a capped ceiling on offense and also a capped ceiling on defense.</p>

<p>Memphis… I don’t get why they were so adamant that dillon brooks couldn’t come back. But then got almost a dillon Brooks clone as a sg. Marcus Smart has the same weaknesses dillon brooks has. He has horrible shot selection and is a below avg 3 pt shooter. He’s also undersized to guard wings for a whole season.</p>

<p>Toronto. I don’t get why they shipped out og anunoby just to grab rj barrett and quickley. Paying quickley seemed like a overpay. If you’re gonna pay quickley that much then I’d rather just max OG. OG was a great fit alongside scottie Barnes, really a head scratcher from masai. They are also too bad to compete but also too good to tank. Definitely don’t like the future for Toronto as of now.</p>

      <label for="lkk9fjg" class="commentText"><p>Because the Kings went through a playoff drought so long that it was old enough to get a driver&rsquo;s license. They know they don&rsquo;t have a championship caliber team, but there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with having a decent fun team. Everybody is too focused on championship or tank, while us Sacramento bros are just happy to have a team over 500.</p>

The plan right now is wait for Scottie to develop, draft one or two lottery prospects and fire sell everything else (potentially including the aforememtioned 2 guys) to get a championship window for a couple of years.</p>
