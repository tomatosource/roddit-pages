<p>Players still did this. Not as regularly from team to team as today (if it’s even regular today) but plenty of players made their name defensively basically “floating” on defense</p>

<p>In fact, Larry Bird was one of them</p>

      <label for="le8wexk" class="commentText"><p>I mean players still stretch their hands toward their opponents today despite no illegal defense. That’s more about an attempt to control the player than show the ref anything</p>

<p>It wasn’t called often. Refs would t blow the whistle on it more than a couple times per game the same way they aren’t gonna do it today (def 3 seconds is illegal defense, and there’s dozens of missed def 3 calls per game)</p>

<p>Here’s an excerpt from an article in the late 80s about Larry Bird, who was the most famous help defender in the league and had a reputation for it and his own words on how he’d intentionally play illegal defense during it to be called and usually got away with it</p>

<p>—————————————</p>

<p>….The leading team defender, by acclamation, is Larry Bird, who on a remarkable number of occasions has been seen drawing offensive fouls and just plain getting in the way of players who aren&rsquo;t his to guard</p>

<p>Bird plays smart, and smart players test the limits of rules. Abdul-Jabbar has done it for years. Bird has everything about the guidelines figured out, including the fact that because the game moves so swiftly and it is impossible for anyone on the floor to watch the entire court, officials are disinclined to call illegal defenses more than once or twice a game—note that the 1,193 illegal defense calls in 1984-85 occurred in 943 games and produced only 157 free throws.
Even then, it&rsquo;s not a bad foul to take…. Says Bird, &ldquo;If you can get two or three steals before they call it, you&rsquo;re ahead of the game.</p>

      <label for="le8wwuq" class="commentText"><p>It still changed the way players played, and what would have been considered playing “free safety” by yourself was nothing like the defense modern players play where they’re totally unrestricted by such a rule.</p>

<p>I mean let’s make this analogy, travelling is rarely called sure. But it still exists as a rule. If you just changed the rule and just eliminated the need to dribble, no shit players would play differently.</p>

<p>That’s the same thing here. Sure, some guys pushed it. The defense was still nothing like a modern defence where every defense can line up whenever they want outside of the paint</p>

      <label for="le8y0ra" class="commentText"><p>Oh I readily admit it’s a lot different, I’m just pointing out that these concepts wouldn’t be alien to players back then because they’ve dealt with myriad defensive coverages. There were both legal and illegal zones. The game evolved and defenses became more complex, but it wasn’t strictly 1 on 1 like some folks are suggesting</p>

<p>There are pros and cons to every era imo. Spacing of today basically makes isolation scoring very similar to how it was in the early 80s with all the rule changes and protections to the offensive player. </p>

Usually, the term used is zone, but it&rsquo;s pretty much any help side action you would see now. Your two options were being arms length of your man and hard committed double. That means you can&rsquo;t load up on stars or certain parts of the floor/paint. Yeah, it wasn&rsquo;t called every single time it&rsquo;s similar to 3 seconds. In the way that the existence enforces itself mostly. Definitely made it much easier for isolation scorers compared to today, obviously a little too easy.</p>

<p>Especially post up heavy games and Karl Malone specifically abused these rules. You had to respect complete non threat shooters or perimeter players lifted above the FT while the post up goes 1v1. Or leave and give a wide open cut to the basket. It&rsquo;s honestly Fisher Price basketball. DeMar DeRozan could get 6 rings too if there were barely any European players in the league</p>

      <label for="le8ris0" class="commentText"><p>That’s why they ran Trap defense and half court / full court pressure. Not illegal at all, just had to use their brains and figure out how to guard effective scorers and scoring team play while avoiding illegal D. Was never a real big issue nor any factor in games back then. It would happen 0-2 times in a game typically and just one FT plus the ball. No one really had an issue with it. Was just the status quo at the time. Teams like the Pistons ran it so well and is why games would sometimes end up in the 80s each team (and of course trapping and banging up MJ). And on the flip side of that time.. teams like the Lakers used transition offense like crazy to render any defense as virtually ineffective. Teams like the Celtics moved the ball around and were so fundamentally sound that they had defense on its heels most the time.
NBA wanted more scoring and with times naturally changing in a progressive way, so they made zone legal (as in the the NCAA at the time). I watched both eras and they’re both just as entertaining, and both have their positives and negatives. Everyone has their take on it, but it’s the ones who grew up watching g both eras I personally pay attention to those opinions rather than most who only grew up watching today’s version. But respect to both and all styles.. and the game itself</p>

      <label for="le8yr6x" class="commentText"><p>I think you miss understood. Mugsy was good in the 90s because the 90s was weak. His game would not translate well today because of how athletic players have become. He WAS effective in the 90s because he played against slow unathletic PGs like John Stockton who thought of themselves as quarterbacks.</p>

<p>Mugsy would get crushed by Derrick Rose, Westbrook who are a foot taller with 45 inch vertical and can run baseline to baseline in 4 seconds.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re going to try to shit on Mugsy at least focus and critique his offense, at least that would hold value and arguable from your perspective.</p>

<p>Your points to try and degrade his defense just makes it sound more and more like you have no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about. Dude played 14 years in the NBA.</p>

      <label for="le8x304" class="commentText"><p>Really a shame they used this dumb, contrived rule for so long.  Watching players figure out how to deal with defenses collapsing on them is how are you ascend from stardom to legend status on that end, LeBron developing a devastating post game, Steph stretching his range to 35 feet, harden deepening his bag so that he can move her to the hoop at the exact moment a defense shows him a crack, KD getting to his spots with a ball fake and one dribble before he gets swarmed, Luca or CP3 keeping defenders in jail by blocking them with their hip, it takes so much skill, vision and timing to deal with modern defenses.</p>

<p>We will never see any of the superstars from this era or any before it have to deal with anything besides the occasional hard double.</p>

      <label for="le93wsg" class="commentText"><p>3 in the key first of all. But beyond that, in this era you couldn’t not guard someone. You had to guard your man, or commit to a double. You could sag off naturally but you can’t just stand between like that, especially in the key which is illegal today still.
The spacing was much more compact those days so they had different rules to keep the game fluid. Modern era also makes rules to make offense easier and more exciting.</p>

<p>The comments fail to realize the illegal defense had nothing to do with Mugsy, who actually swiped at the ball after the whistle was blown, and you can hear the commentators noticing the illegal defense prior to the whistle.</p>

Good swipe by Mugsy, but the help side defender was just standing in the paint not guarding anybody. That’s illegal defense today too.</p>

Mustve been a shock to anyone who played with him and didn’t understand who he was at first sight.</p>
