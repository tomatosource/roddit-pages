      <label for="l9w9ifk" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, but you need a little context here. AD&rsquo;s healthy seasons are heavily frontloaded to his Pelicans days, outside of this past season. AD prior to this season played 56, 40, and 36 games. That&rsquo;s three straight seasons where he missed significant time and two of those were over half the games of the season.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jimmy Butler has <strong>never</strong> played under 52 games in a season outside of his rookie year. And Steph Curry has 8 years in his career where he&rsquo;s played 70+ games and 11 seasons where he&rsquo;s played 60+ games.</p>

<p>I get what you mean that AD being injury prone is a bit overstated, but at the same time, recency bias certainly plays a factor. He&rsquo;s been much more injured as of recent with the Lakers than he was for the Pelicans. That fact matters as he gets older.</p>

      <label for="l9xhwxe" class="commentText"><p>I acknowledged that, but if you&rsquo;re looking at his Lakers career, last season was the exception and not the norm. You have to stretch out to his Pelicans days to say he isn&rsquo;t injury prone.</p>

<p>Now, maybe he just had a bad few year stretch, but of you look at the past 4 years he was definitely more injury prone.</p>

      <label for="l9wrbsq" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, fair or not, AD&rsquo;s time with the Pelicans isn&rsquo;t viewed as being super &ldquo;important&rdquo; compared to his time with the Lakers where he &ldquo;should&rdquo; be competing for titles. He had 2 seasons where he made the playoffs as a Pelican, and never made it out of the second round (coming up against the Warriors both times though.</p>

<p>Since he joined theLakers, he&rsquo;s played in ~69% of Lakers games, which comes out to 57 games per season for a full 82 game season.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s missed half the team&rsquo;s games in 2021 and 2022, which is 40% of his Lakers seasons so far, and had some injury troubles in the 2021 playoffs.</p>

<p>So people will focus more on your time on what is supposed to be a team contending for titles than when you&rsquo;re on a team that literally never had consecutive winning seasons when AD was on the team.</p>

<p>I mean 3 seasons out of 12 played is not that bad tho. Hell, when looking at the playoffs 2021 is the only year he got hurt as a laker. Didn&rsquo;t miss a game in their 2023 WCF run.</p>

      <label for="l9wb8mc" class="commentText"><p>Not really a fair way to frame it. Curry had two seasons where he missed the majority of the season because of one time injuries, and Butler misses games because he&rsquo;s one of the biggest load managers in the game and genuinely just doesn&rsquo;t care that much about the regular season. Let&rsquo;s not pretend that Curry didn&rsquo;t have the injury prone/glass ankles label after 2013.</p>

<p>Anthony Davis consistently misses a quarter or more of games almost every season due to legitimate injuries. He has hit the 70 games played mark only 3 times in 12 seasons. His reputation as injury prone was around long before he joined the Lakers. I don&rsquo;t think &ldquo;Anthony Davis is not injury prone actually&rdquo; is the hill to die on.</p>

<p>One of my favorite games I&rsquo;ve ever attended in person was <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore/_/gameId/400975076" target="_blank">Donovan Mitchell&rsquo;s first 40 point performance</a>. It was vs the New Orleans Pelicans. Anthony Davis was injured (left groin injury) at the start of the 4th quarter and didn&rsquo;t finish the game. He ended up missing the next 3 games because of that injury.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s a fantastic player, but he also misses a decent amount of games with minor nagging injuries. It is what it is, you gotta take the good with the bad.</p>

<p>once you get injured again any durability labels become invalid lol. either way i dont ever remember people calling him durable. the opposite actually. hindsight you can look back and say he had durable years but you dont know that til later right?</p>

He played in 96% of their games and that doesn‚Äôt include the playoffs. He had one thing to get over early in his career, his ankle and he did that.  People stop calling players injury prone if they stop getting injured and he stopped getting injured for a while.</p>

<p>He‚Äôs older now and obviously as players get older they are more likely to start getting hurt more. AD has been getting hurt his whole career, and it‚Äôs been his entire body you have to be worried about for his entire career.</p>

<p>What really influences the perception of AD is the fact that he falls down and is slow to get up in every single game he plays.</p>

<p>Fans and broadcasters spend that time wondering if he‚Äôs hurt. Then he winces and walks it off a bit with some kind of limp, holding his arm or rubbing his back or something.</p>

<p>Most of the time he‚Äôs fine.</p>

      <label for="l9w2ajf" class="commentText"><p>True. But I honestly think his back injury was more serious than people thought. Dude used to jump out the building but I imagine that puts a lot of force on your body when land. I also don‚Äôt know if he ever really was a guy who could play with a superstar SG. His offensive game was pretty limited, even on the Magic.</p>

      <label for="l9xhh40" class="commentText"><p>i mean he played what like 8 years then got injured? you can say thats past your prime at that point. saying you were the best or 2nd best center for 8 years isnt some bad career regardless of what happens after injury or not. also his hou and atl years werent horrible. it was not bad but you see flashes of his prime and that always hurts to watch or leads to extreme takes like yours.</p>

<p>would be like saying porzingus career went downward spiral after injury when in fact he had a good but injuried year.</p>

<p>could argue hou dwight had a better one since 2 fewer points. 6 more rebounds and a lot better defense and 20 more games.</p>

He took his team to the Finals as &ldquo;the man&rdquo; while playing demonstrably WORSE than AD has in multiple playoff runs. Why the fuck should we care that Dwight, while playing worse, made it further in the playoffs by virtue of being on a better team / playing weaker comp?</p>

<p>Dwight&rsquo;s second option was Hedo Turkoglu, who was signed away by the Raptors to recreate the same magic with Chris Bosh and Hedo flamed out of Toronto in spectacular fashion. it was a complete disaster and a testament to how good Dwight was in his prime.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, an AD-led team is not beating a 66-win Bron in his absolute prime. the best he could do is beat the Blazers and he needed Jrue to outplay Dame Lillard to do that.</p>

<p>Jrue had a ton of injury problems during his Pels years, the Sixers even where fined because of undisclosed issues after the trade. He even had to take a ton of time off because of his wife medical issues.</p>

<p>Then you had Eric Gordon that was the piece around the CP3 trade. He was injured for most of the time and didn&rsquo;t want to be there.</p>

<p>You add to that the Cousins injury, Asik getting Chron&rsquo;s disease, Tyreke Evans being the best wing the team ever had (who also missed a season because of injury), etc. Those teams where awful and cursed.</p>

<p>Dwights teams where much better constructed and very modern, taking noted from Hakeem old Rockets teams.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so stupid how people continue to do this shit. The 2009 Magic were unquestionably a better supporting cast than any AD had in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Hedo&rsquo;s performance after leaving Orlando is irrelevant. That&rsquo;s not the Hedo Dwight played with. The Hedo Dwight played with was great and roided to the gills, as was most of that team.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Based on absolutely nothing lmao. You&rsquo;re so fucking biased.</p>

<p>In one sentence you try to reduce a supporting cast to a single player, and in the next you try to big up the 2009 Cavs as some dominant super team because of their record lol. The second best Cav was Mo Williams and he averaged 18 ppg on 38% shooting in the ECF&hellip;</p>

<p>Player performance is what matters. Not whether or not their supporting cast was good enough and competition weak enough for them to reach X round in the playoffs.</p>

<p>AD has had many playoff series where he played just as well if not better than Dwight did in the 2009 ECF. He just didn&rsquo;t get as much credit for it but dumbasses focus on the wrong things.</p>

<p>second options are extremely important. Jokic is a tier above the both of them and even he can&rsquo;t win without Jamal Murray playing above his head. with Jamal out with the ACL tear, he managed to beat the same Blazer team and proceeded to get swept out of the second round. lost to the Warriors in the first round in 5 the next year. lost to the Wolves this year because of Jamal&rsquo;s injured calf.</p>

<p>Dwight contended with a group of very good role players and probably would have won the championship if the Chauncey/Melo Nuggets defeated the Lakers in the WCF that year. that is extremely noteworthy and something AD was not capable of doing.</p>

      <label for="l9wsvp5" class="commentText"><p>Supporting casts are important. Having one great teammate and a bunch of garbage is not better than having an entire starting lineup of really good starters with no particular &ldquo;second star&rdquo; type standouts.</p>

<p>Also Rashard Lewis and Jameer Nelson were both All-Stars in 2009&hellip;</p>

<p>Steph&rsquo;s most impactful teammate in 2021 was Draymond. In 2022 it was also Draymond.</p>

<p>In 2021 they missed the playoffs. In 2022 they won the title.</p>

<p>The OVERALL supporting cast matters, not just one or two players.</p>

<p>Quick maths but the Magic - Dwight totalled 45 WS in 2009, suggesting they were a roughly 45-win team without him. Dwight himself was worth 13.8 wins.</p>

<p>For the 2018 Pelicans, AD was worth 13.7 wins, but the rest of the team totalled just 35 win shares. So they were like a 35 win team without AD. 31 win team if you take out Boogie who was injured in the playoffs. And they had to play the KD Warriors&hellip;</p>

<p>And that was the BEST team situation AD ever had in New Orleans&hellip; There is zero historical precedent for a player taking a team that bad to the Finals while facing legit competition in their conference.</p>

Sure Dwight can protect the rim better but he was never a great perimeter defender. Offense? He couldn&rsquo;t even do post moves properly, and he couldn&rsquo;t shoot. Swap prime AD with 09 Dwight, they go to the finals still. I like Dwight and I think he is undisputed a top 75, but god damn he&rsquo;s getting overrated here.</p>

<p>AD on the Pelicans had decent teams but his best was a 6th seed in 2017-2018 with at 49-33 record and most seasons he didn&rsquo;t even make the playoffs. Dwight had a 59-23 season going to the finals beating Lebron&rsquo;s Cavs.</p>

<p>I would think Jrue Holiday and co. should be a decent enough supporting cast to make the playoffs most seasons.</p>

And what kind of dumb argument is that? It&rsquo;s equivalent of saying Klay and Draymond are useless outside of Warriors since they played their best years with Steph.
 Lewis was already an all star before Orlando. Hedo was a prototype stretch 4 which was a nightmare for most opponents. Nelson was a decent guard that could get jobs done.
You are delusional on things.</p>

<p>If you compare basketball skills, of course AD is the better player, but Dwight‚Äôs impact in his era led his team to the finals.</p>

That Magic team had specific advantages against that Cleveland team and they exploited it and won, maybe if they were in the West or had slightly different role players it changes the outcome. Judging and comparing individual players by team success just doesn‚Äôt make much sense.</p>

I‚Äôm saying, sometimes an elite player can play in a certain system and have certain role players that fills the gaps in that superstars weaknesses, and that gives that player more space to shine. Look at Nash and what D‚ÄôAntoni‚Äôs offense did for him. He was still really good beforehand but that system with those teammates helped him be MVP. There are other point guards just as good that don‚Äôt have that MVP because they didn‚Äôt get that same type of opportunity, that‚Äôs all I mean.</p>

AD literally played 76 and put up a double double last year, age 30. Dwight couldn‚Äôt play more games than that past 25.</p>

I said he doesn‚Äôt have as many counters cause his touch wasn‚Äôt as nice as ADs, and if you can admit AD has better touch you should know that. I‚Äôve hooped enough to know the difference between Anthony Davis and Dwight skill wise lmao, none of em is bad at basketball but if you think Dwight Howard from the 2010‚Äôs compares to AD skill wise u might not know shit.

Defensively they have very similar levels of impact, but something that Dwight can‚Äôt do is go out to the perimeter like AD can. To me, Dwight is still a better interior defender and definitely a better rebounder.</p>

<p>Offensively Dwight had flaws that AD doesn‚Äôt have now, namely being ass in the post and not being able to shoot anything.¬†</p>

<p>It sucks that Dwight‚Äôs injuries, his back especially, caused him to have to cut down his own skills in order to be good. We‚Äôll never get to see what Dwight‚Äôs game could‚Äôve potentially evolved into, but I have to go with AD based on what we have seen.¬†</p>

We literally just saw Luka go from missing the play-in to making the Finals in one year. We saw Steph win another title one year after missing the playoffs. IT&rsquo;S A TEAM GAME.</p>

      <label for="l9wr0vm" class="commentText"><p>I really liked Dwight in his prime and he was one of my favorite players, but the nostalgia really is insane. Getting to the finals with the perfect supporting cast really clouds people‚Äôs views of a player.</p>

<p>AD‚Äôs been consistently a better offensive player than Dwight while being just as impactful defensively or more with his ability to step out to the perimeter. I know I‚Äôm just agreeing with you but this argument is crazy lol.</p>

      <label for="l9vtgw7" class="commentText"><p>I think the highest peak reached by either player was Davis in 19-20 in which he, ironically, had Dwight as a teammate, but yes Dwight undoubtedly had more team success in their first stops but in saying that Dwight had the most perfect team built around him for a few years while AD.. didn‚Äôt have that lol. Dwight was also an iron man for the first 14 years of his career save for one year.</p>

<p>I think AD is by far the more versatile player tho, he can fit next to many other stars whereas Dwight sort of needed the team to be built in a specific way for him to contribute on offense.</p>

<p>Idk bit of a fun question I guess, honestly have never thought of comparing those two because they‚Äôre quite different players in my mind.</p>

      <label for="l9v7r4f" class="commentText"><p>Well, I agree it‚Äôs hard to compare them not just as players but their careers have played out very differently.</p>

<p>Dwight was a bonified center while AD is a hybrid center/forward and even somewhat of a guard.  Dwight was a post player known mostly for defense despite being a 20+ scorer while AD is a two way player that plays both post and perimeter.  Dwight was a physical player, AD half physical half finesse.</p>

<p>Dwight at his peak was considered the third best player in the league behind Kobe and Lebron.  AD might have been ranked that high during the championship year but not as definitively as Dwight and not for as long.</p>

<p>In terms of DPOY Dwight was the Gobert of his time, won three times in a row as a very obvious choice.  AD is always in the conversation, might‚Äôve even deserved it this year but has never won.</p>

<p>Both went to the finals once.  AD won, Dwight didn‚Äôt.  The league has changed since peak Dwight and AD is probably a better player for today‚Äôs NBA but in Dwight‚Äôs time he was like a super hero, like literally wearing a Superman cape.  Closest thing there ever was to Shaq (but not really close).</p>

      <label for="l9v8ei7" class="commentText"><p>Dwight would be a great player today too if he embraced being a rim runner. No one would be able to stop his lobs. One of the most athletic centers ever but he had a huge ego and needed to be fed in the post so he could put up mechanical and ugly hooks. His actual offensive game was very limited. Dwight used to get scrutinized heavily for his offense in his prime.</p>

      <label for="l9w30vc" class="commentText"><p>I once met Dwight but i didn&rsquo;t know who he was at the time. It was the summer of 2006 and i was walking my cat at Daytona Beach. I passed a tall guy sitting on a park bench eating a cheese sandwich and he looked at me and laughed and said what the fuck i was doing walking a cat. He was wearing a loose pair of shorts and the way he was sitting i could see both of his testicles clearly, they were not oval shaped but perfectly round and his nutsac was devoid of hair. I said i could see his balls the way he was sitting and he flinched and dropped his cheese sandwich into the dirt. He looked at me with embarrassment and me feeling pity for the fellow, i invited him to a cafe brunch for sandwiches, which he eagerly accepted. Before we parted ways we went to an ice cream shop and licked ice creams together. I will never forget that day.</p>

      <label for="l9wwoc6" class="commentText"><p>Dwight is underrated elsewhere but has somehow gotten significantly overrated in this sub. Orlando had one great playoff run where their shooters hit an incredible number of 3s and it took them to the finals. Dwight was their best player but he did not carry them. In that run he had 20/15/2 on very elite defense. Great but not any better than what we&rsquo;ve seen from AD.</p>

<p>And outside of that one year Orlando didn&rsquo;t have much playoff success. &lsquo;05 &amp; &lsquo;06 missed playoffs, &lsquo;07 swept in the first round, &lsquo;08 second round, &lsquo;10 conf finals, &lsquo;11 first round, &lsquo;12 (injured) first round. Dwight had 2 good playoff runs in Orlando. That&rsquo;s it. Then very little success outside of Orlando. I don&rsquo;t know why that carries him above so many players for a lot of people.</p>

<p>When the Lakers won the championship AD was as good or better than any Dwight year. He was 28/10/4 with much better outside shooting and with nearly as good defense. His level of play was keeping up with LeBron.</p>

<p>If you look at career regular season and playoff averages it&rsquo;s not close. AD with 25/13/4 and 26/12/3 in the playoffs with a PER of 25.8. Howard with 16/12/1 and 15/12/1 in the playoffs with a PER of 21.3.</p>

<p>The answer is AD all day. Same or higher peak seasons and much better overall career numbers.</p>

      <label for="l9xcb7o" class="commentText"><p>AD‚Äôs 19-20 season was an absolute beast. One of the main reasons is because he was killing it from mid range. I randomly watched 4-5 games of the bubble tournament recently and it is very different than how he plays now. He was such a threat from the mid range and players had to guard him from out there which gave him the ability to pump fake or face his defender and drive. He collapsed the defense time and time again and they had the shooters to compliment that. I hate that people dont give as much credit but that lakers squad could go toe to toe with any of the last finals participants of the past decade.</p>

(A game between Orlando and OKC comes to mind from 2012, diwght dominated all game but OKCs big three pulled it out in the 4th). He was really good in Houston&rsquo;s first round loss against Portland in 2014.</p>

<p>And then there&rsquo;d be games where he&rsquo;d be baited into dribbling the ball and losing it, because he was too determined to show critics like Shaq that he can post up. A post on here yesterday highlighted how many times he gave the ball up</p>

<p>Al-Defensive 1st Teams: 4 vs 3</p>

<p>All-Defensive Total Team: 5 vs 5</p>

<p>Granted, AD has struggled with injuries, so a fully healthy all-the-time AD probably puts up better numbers and has more accolades, but availability is an important ability, and Dwight compares pretty favorably in most every metric that isn&rsquo;t scoring.</p>

      <label for="l9vnbx9" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d go Dwight. There were several seasons where Orlando would be a top 5 defense with Howard on the court and bottom 5 with him off, his defensive impact was about as good as I&rsquo;ve ever seen. And not only does he grab 14 boards, he tips a ton out, too, preventing the other big man from grabbing the board.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t get all the people saying he&rsquo;d be worse in today&rsquo;s game. Relatively, maybe because there&rsquo;s more comp at the center position with Joker and Embiid around, but Dwight always worked best surrounded by 4 shooters and he&rsquo;d have those lineups all day right now. And Dallas ran two centers who didn&rsquo;t spread the floor in Gafford and Lively, The warriors won in 22 with Kevon Looney AND Draymond both in most of the time- two players who don&rsquo;t space the floor, Giannis won in 21 as an underwhelming shooter. It&rsquo;s not like we didn&rsquo;t see Dwight in the 3 point era either: a washed up, old post injury Dwight was key to the Lakers getting past the Nuggets with his defense on Jokic. Prime dwight who moved like a guard(albeit a bit robotic, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the muscles that made it look that way) would be fine if not better with the shooter personnel in today&rsquo;s NBA.</p>
