<p>If you compare basketball skills, of course AD is the better player, but Dwight’s impact in his era led his team to the finals.</p>

      <label for="l9v7r4f" class="commentText"><p>Well, I agree it’s hard to compare them not just as players but their careers have played out very differently.</p>

<p>Dwight was a bonified center while AD is a hybrid center/forward and even somewhat of a guard.  Dwight was a post player known mostly for defense despite being a 20+ scorer while AD is a two way player that plays both post and perimeter.  Dwight was a physical player, AD half physical half finesse.</p>

<p>Dwight at his peak was considered the third best player in the league behind Kobe and Lebron.  AD might have been ranked that high during the championship year but not as definitively as Dwight and not for as long.</p>

<p>In terms of DPOY Dwight was the Gobert of his time, won three times in a row as a very obvious choice.  AD is always in the conversation, might’ve even deserved it this year but has never won.</p>

<p>Both went to the finals once.  AD won, Dwight didn’t.  The league has changed since peak Dwight and AD is probably a better player for today’s NBA but in Dwight’s time he was like a super hero, like literally wearing a Superman cape.  Closest thing there ever was to Shaq (but not really close).</p>

<p>(God damn, I’m that old man telling stories now 👴)</p>

      <label for="l9v8ei7" class="commentText"><p>Dwight would be a great player today too if he embraced being a rim runner. No one would be able to stop his lobs. One of the most athletic centers ever but he had a huge ego and needed to be fed in the post so he could put up mechanical and ugly hooks. His actual offensive game was very limited. Dwight used to get scrutinized heavily for his offense in his prime.</p>

<p>I absolutely hated that team and that fuckin horrible shitbox wings in Rashard Lewis and Hedo Turkoglu cause they were so fuckin perfect at doing the Dwight dominating inside then kicking it out to the tall 3 point shooters out wide. His teammates were bang average but were the perfect compliment to Dwight</p>

<p>Still get annoyed thinking back on it.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;ll shut down Jokic (when he used to struggle against most post bigs).</p>

<p>Be much more of a threat in the post (he was absolutely useless in the post and comitted turnovers every 2nd possession).</p>

<p>Be a DPOY contender (this one stands the test of time imo).</p>
