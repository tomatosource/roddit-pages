</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Throughout most of its history, the NBA has annually granted Most Valuable Player Awards to recognize its best competitors in the regular season and in the NBA Finals. These are the most substantial honors that an NBA player can receive. And since 2022, two Conference Finals MVPs have also been awarded each year to further celebrate achievement in the postseason.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, though, there has never been an award for the most valuable player in the entirety of the playoffs. For the vast majority of the league’s history, the only individual postseason award was entirely based on one series and only available to one team. As a consequence, some of the most incredible performances in the history of the sport have gone without any official recognition. So this project intends to retroactively celebrate some of those performances by asking this subreddit to award <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ghu9LJ6" target="_blank">Playoff MVPs</a> for every playoff tournament from 1980 to the present.</p>

<p>#How to Vote</p>

<p>I will provide three different comments beneath each post representing three Playoff MVP candidates for the season being discussed. Additionally, if anybody feels that another player is deserving of candidacy, they can add a comment for that player to nominate them for the award using the process described in the following section. You can reply to these comments with arguments for or against any of the players to convince other voters of your position. Whichever player has the most upvotes after five days will be declared the Playoff MVP of that year, which will be announced the following week.</p>

<p>#Nominating Players</p>

<p>If you would like to nominate a player, simply post a comment for that athlete using the same format as the comments for the other candidates. This should include the player’s name and a link to the Basketball Reference page of the team that they played for that season. Here is an example that you can copy:</p>

<p>PMVP Candidate: <strong>J.R. Smith - <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CLE/2016.html" target="_blank">Stats and Record</a></strong></p>

<p>#Voting Criteria</p>

<p>Since the NBA doesn’t have any official criteria for how the MVP is decided, I’m not going to provide any specific criteria for this award either. However, I will suggest that voters judge the playoff MVP by the same standards that they use to judge the regular season MVP, such as individual statistics, team success, and overall impact on the game.</p>

<p>#2024 NBA Playoffs</p>

      <label for="livqcev" class="commentText"><p>Luka averaged 29/9/8 4 TOs on 55% TS with a 13-9 record and some bad defense, especially in the finals.</p>

<p>Tatum averaged 25/10/6 2.5 TOs on 55% TS with a 16-3 record and great defense.</p>

<p>Luka has an argument for sure but honestly his numbers aren’t much better and considering the defense gap and the better offball play from Tatum I’d give him the edge.</p>

<p>Ofc I’m biased but Luka didn’t have that great of a playoffs where I’d give him the edge over someone with comparable stat lines and much more success</p>

      <label for="liw2itp" class="commentText"><p>I mean yeah, stats aren&rsquo;t as convincing, but you also have to consider that Luka was injured through whole playoffs. Also, while Tatum was better on defense obviously, he himself was in a major shooting slump whole playoffs. His team is incredibly stacked, he didn&rsquo;t win finals mvp because he didn&rsquo;t perform up to that level. He obviously played good, but you can&rsquo;t say he carried the team. Everyone on a Celtics team was great, so practically no competition could be provided in any round.</p>

<p>Luka on the other hand had multiple games where he carried Mavs to victory. He did has his problems, but he did actually play good defence in Clippers series, had several clutch performances in Clippers and OKC series, including incredible block on Shai in game 6. He was the main reason behind Mavs comeback in game 1 against the wolves, scoring I think 15 points in 4th quarter. In game two he had a game winner over Rudy Gobert. In game 5 he put all Timberwolves hopes to comeback away in the first quarter.</p>

<p>And even in the finals, he still was the best player I think. Kyrie disappeared for the most of the series, and Luka had to carry Mavs whole offense alone, and almost succeeded at that in game 2. Obviously he had bad games, and really struggled on defense, but that&rsquo;s because his injuries caught up to him while practically no one else could do anything. You put prime MJ in that situation and he wouldn&rsquo;t find it easy too.</p>

<p>In the end, for Celtics I can&rsquo;t put Tatum or even Brown as a unanimous MVP for them. All their players had several games with outstanding performances that carried them to victory. If anything, Brad Stevens is the MVP for this playoffs, because of how good of a team he created. But among players I don&rsquo;t think anyone was as important as Luka was this year</p>

      <label for="liwg7p6" class="commentText"><p>For me the injury doesn’t matter because while it may have hindered him that doesn’t really matter for the question of who was the best this playoffs. Sucks that it hampered him but that made him objectively a worse player than he normally is and that matters when talking about who played best in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Also, while Tatum was in a slump, his TS was identical to Luka’s. Tatum has the benefit of better spacing sure, but teams would pretty often send help early and often, such as in the Mavs series where Tatum was seeing harder doubles than Luka in that whole series. Defensive attention really wasn’t that different, it’s more just that the Celtics others were more able to take advantage than the Mavs.</p>

<p>I agree Stevens is the MVP but Luka and Tatum had the same efficiency, Luka had 4 more ppg and 2 more apg, Tatum had 1 more rebound and 2 less turnovers, along with noticeably better defense.</p>

<p>I think that Tatum deserves the Playoff MVP</p>

      <label for="lixvgfd" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re being really biased and disingenuous with how you present these stats, and I could tell just by a glance, before I even fact checked</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Luka averaged 29/9/8 4 TOs on 55% TS</p>

<p>Tatum averaged 25/10/6 2.5 TOs on 55% TS</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&rsquo;re purposefully inconsistent rounding up and down arbitrarily according to your biased narrative</p>

<ul>
<li>Tatum averaged 2.6 TOs per game, but you round it down instead of correctly rounding up</li>
<li>You come up with an entirely new &ldquo;rounding to 2.5&rdquo; only when it makes Tatum look better. You pulled that .5 rounding out of your butt? And not use it for any other stat?</li>
<li>Luka literally averaged 9.5 RBG, yet you rounded <em>that</em> down to 9 RPG?</li>
<li>Tatum averaged 0.549 TS%, so you rounded it up to 55%, but when Luka averaged 0.556 TS% you round it <em>down</em> to also 55%?</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Ofc I’m biased</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are, but it&rsquo;s more than that, you&rsquo;re purposefully lying about the data, but only a lil bit here and a lil bit there so nobody notices. GTFOH</p>

<p>Honestly I don&rsquo;t think anyone this year was impressive for more than one series. Luka was great against Wolves, but outside of that it wasn&rsquo;t great. Shai was good against Dallas, but pretty bad against Pelicans. Ant started well, but slowed down eventually and you can name many more players.</p>

      <label for="lixbdmx" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I was thinking exactly this as well. It&rsquo;s hard to give it to someone who lost in round 2, but nobody in the final 4 was really that great. Luka had great numbers but the efficiency was bad and the defense was awful at times. Tatum wasn&rsquo;t consistent, the efficiency was bad and the overall performance was just mediocre considering how absurd the team around him was. Ant forgot how to shoot halfway through his run and Haliburton just kinda ended up in the ECF despite not playing nearly as well as he had in the early stages of the season.</p>

<p>I guess it&rsquo;s Luka but it&rsquo;s kinda by default and one of the weakest &ldquo;playoff MVPs&rdquo; we&rsquo;ve had in a long time.</p>

      <label for="livnah1" class="commentText"><p>I love JB but yes, there is a real argument.</p>

<p>Luka averaged like 29 PPG and led a 5th seed to the Finals. I personally thought he was pretty up-and-down in the playoffs and I just can’t convince myself to say he was the PMVP when he played the way he did in the Finals but there is certainly a strong argument to be made for him.</p>

<p>Tatum led the Celtics in points, rebounds and assists and you can definitely say that Brown wouldn’t have had nearly the same success without Tatum taking the brunt of the defense’s attention, but Tatum was quite inefficient as a scorer.</p>

<p>unfortunately I think it’s nearly impossible to have an unbiased and nuanced debate about the three of them on this sub honestly. its obvious that people here (and the NBA fandom in general) lean pro-Luka and anti-Celtics</p>

<p>I dislike Luka a lot more than I do anyone on the Celtics, and I still think it&rsquo;s very obviously him out of the 3 candidates if winning the championship isn&rsquo;t a requirement for this award.</p>

      <label for="liwwu3d" class="commentText"><p>you may be right. maybe it’s partially that I’m biased that I don’t think Luka was especially good in the playoffs.</p>

<p>but being as objective as I can - his shooting from deep and from the line was mediocre to bad, he turned it over a ton, he played very poorly on defense and was just generally hot-and-cold in the playoffs. obviously he was injured which affected him greatly but that doesn’t really factor into my thinking here bc this is a playoff MVP and I think the evaluation should be how they played in a vacuum. of these guys though the only one who really played well by their standard was Jaylen.</p>

<p>it just begs the question of what you think the criteria should be. all these players were indispensable to the success their teams had. if the criteria is mainly how well they played relative to their capability, their performance in high-leverage situations, and consistency, then it’s Jaylen Brown. if it’s mainly about counting offensive stats, then it’s Luka.</p>

<p>not that either framework more right or wrong than the other, but I personally think the former is a better way of looking at it, and is consistent with the way that postseason MVP awards are typically given out. at the end of the day this is a made-up award intended to foster discussion so it doesn’t really matter lol.</p>

      <label for="lixgk4z" class="commentText"><p>It seems like we’re in agreement that it shouldn’t be Tatum.</p>

<p>Regarding JB, hypothetically, if you could only see a single player’s stat line from this year’s finals, with no name attached to it, and the stat line you looked at was JB’s, would you ever have thought that player was in consideration for Finals MVP?</p>

<p>I get that you’re trying to say “relative to his capability”, but you’re putting his performance up against first options with more demanding roles. And one of those first options faced a MUCH more difficult path to the finals. Just look at the perimeter defenders and team defenses Luka saw on his way to the finals, and then contrast that to what Boston and JB saw.</p>

<p>I won’t say it’s you, because I appreciate the way you’re supporting your thoughts with numbers and sound logic. But I feel like there are people in this thread that have tried to dance around this ever since the finals ended, and are being disingenuous because he’s a Celtics player. Especially during the drama JB manufactured about not making team USA. There was nothing all that notable about JBs performance in the grand scheme of things, I don’t think it will be remembered fondly. I say that with consideration given to the competition he saw prior to the finals, and then his mediocre finals when they saw a better opponent.</p>

<p>We didn’t see the best version of Luka, that’s true, but I’d still take his performance over JB because it helped his team overachieve and reach the finals, beating 3 tough opponents along the way.</p>

      <label for="lixpkb7" class="commentText"><p>I’m gonna be honest I did prefer Tatum’s postseason run to Luka’s for a variety of reasons but I just can’t get myself to say he was PMVP given the way he shot the ball throughout the playoffs.</p>

<p>no, I probably wouldn’t. but I would argue that isn’t a reflection of JB’s play, I think it’s a reflection of the fact that we need to move on from oversimplifying playoff performance to counting stats and efficiency. like if you looked purely at the numbers you’d think Tatum was the best player on the Celtics in the Finals but anyone who watched the series knows that Brown was the best player on the court through the first 3 games and that he was playing some of the best individual defense that Luka has probably ever played against in his life.</p>

<p>I totally disagree that Brown’s run wasn’t notable. I think it’s hard for neutral fans bc the Celtics were never truly pushed within the context of a series throughout the playoffs, that much is definitely true, so it was probably hard to pay attention. but Brown had an absurd number of clutch/memorable moments including the game-tying steal and 3 against Indiana, essentially the series-sealing jumpshot in Game 3 of the Finals, the huge tone-setting dunk in Game 1 of the Finals, the series-winning block and assist in Game 4 of the ECF, dagger in Game 4 of the 2nd round, etc. when I think of Luka’s run the first things that come to mind for me are his game-winner over Rudy and his dagger against the Clippers in Game 2, but I also remember him smoking clutch free throws in a Game 4 loss against OKC, I remember him fouling out of the biggest game of his season, and I remember him getting red in the face and screaming at refs while he got absolutely toasted off the dribble by Brown and Tatum over and over and over in the Finals.</p>

<p>I think that’s the biggest difference between Brown and Luka and even Tatum for me that makes me lean toward Brown for this - I don’t remember a moment in the playoffs where I thought to myself, this guy is actively fucking his team over right now with the things he’s doing on the court. I had that thought with Tatum a couple times, and there were also times where I watched Luka in the playoffs and had that thought. I simply never felt that way watching JB in the playoffs. you can argue that’s bc he was the second option, but Kyrie proved in the Finals that a #2 can definitely fuck a team over.</p>

<p>I think ultimately we just disagree on the criteria though. your criteria are which player performed the best while carrying the largest burden. mine are more which player performed the best and most consistently within what he was being asked to do, and came up biggest in clutch moments. it’s natural that we’ll come to different conclusions.</p>

<p>in any case, whoever you think it is, I think we can agree that this is probably the weakest playoff MVP of recent history.</p>

<p>Tatum was truly fantastic as a playmaker, rebounder and defender, and leading a championship team in all 3 major statistical categories is a very rare achievement. but he was pretty mediocre as a scorer and had some really ugly shooting lines.</p>

<p>Luka led the playoffs in all 3 major statistical categories and may have had the best single shot of the postseason, but was quite inefficient by his standards and was horrendous defensively in the Finals.</p>

<p>Brown scored efficiently from the field, made massive clutch plays throughout the postseason and played outstanding perimeter defense, but he clearly didn’t carry the same offensive burden as guys like Tatum or Luka or even Ant.</p>

<p>Ant is the other guy that came to mind for me but his run was a tale of two halves. over the first 8 games he averaged 32/7/6 on 67.3 TS% as the Wolves went 6-2, then over the final 8 games he dropped to 23/8/7 on 51.7 TS% as the Wolves went 3-5. but leading the fucking Minnesota Timberwolves to the WCF for the second time ever is pretty crazy.</p>

<p>imo you could pick any of these 4 and have a leg to stand on. I’d personally go with Brown though</p>

      <label for="liv9r0i" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s so hard because none of these feels right to vote. Jaylen Brown is the only one that played up to his regular season stats, but his stats aren&rsquo;t as good as Luka&rsquo;s. Luka statistically looks like the best, but his team lost, and he was nowhere near his regular season averages. Tatum shot pretty poorly in the playoffs as well. I think Jaylen Brown is the only one of these players that had a &ldquo;good&rdquo; playoffs, so it&rsquo;s gotta be him. He also got the Finals MVP as well.</p>

      <label for="livfwqv" class="commentText"><p>Luka was hobbled and still led his team to the finals. Now, I&rsquo;m of the mind that if you&rsquo;re on the court, then there&rsquo;s no excuses, and he was legitimately bad in some playoff games this year. Even still, I think his playoff highs outweigh his playoff lows - because that&rsquo;s how good he was in those highs.</p>

<p>If Luka wasn&rsquo;t playing on one leg, I think he would have far fewer bad games and been much closer to his regular season stats. Since this is a made-up award for Reddit, I&rsquo;m gonna go with my personal bias and say that context matters and Luka is Playoff MVP.</p>

      <label for="livrfh3" class="commentText"><p>For me I don’t really give injury any contextual value in the case of who was the best player in any given time frame. Sure Luka may have been noticeable better than the Jays if he were healthy but that’s not really relevant to the simple question of “who was the best in the playoffs.” Not the best considering circumstances, just who played the best. Luka, partly due to his injury, didn’t play well enough for me to say it’s him.</p>
