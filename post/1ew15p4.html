</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Throughout most of its history, the NBA has annually granted Most Valuable Player Awards to recognize its best competitors in the regular season and in the NBA Finals. These are the most substantial honors that an NBA player can receive. And since 2022, two Conference Finals MVPs have also been awarded each year to further celebrate achievement in the postseason.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, though, there has never been an award for the most valuable player in the entirety of the playoffs. For the vast majority of the league’s history, the only individual postseason award was entirely based on one series and only available to one team. As a consequence, some of the most incredible performances in the history of the sport have gone without any official recognition. So this project intends to retroactively celebrate some of those performances by asking this subreddit to award <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ghu9LJ6" target="_blank">Playoff MVPs</a> for every playoff tournament from 1980 to the present.</p>

<p>#How to Vote</p>

<p>I will provide three different comments beneath each post representing three Playoff MVP candidates for the season being discussed. Additionally, if anybody feels that another player is deserving of candidacy, they can add a comment for that player to nominate them for the award using the process described in the following section. You can reply to these comments with arguments for or against any of the players to convince other voters of your position. Whichever player has the most upvotes after five days will be declared the Playoff MVP of that year, which will be announced the following week.</p>

<p>#Nominating Players</p>

<p>If you would like to nominate a player, simply post a comment for that athlete using the same format as the comments for the other candidates. This should include the player’s name and a link to the Basketball Reference page of the team that they played for that season. Here is an example that you can copy:</p>

<p>PMVP Candidate: <strong>J.R. Smith - <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CLE/2016.html" target="_blank">Stats and Record</a></strong></p>

<p>#Voting Criteria</p>

<p>Since the NBA doesn’t have any official criteria for how the MVP is decided, I’m not going to provide any specific criteria for this award either. However, I will suggest that voters judge the playoff MVP by the same standards that they use to judge the regular season MVP, such as individual statistics, team success, and overall impact on the game.</p>

      <label for="livqcev" class="commentText"><p>Luka averaged 29/9/8 4 TOs on 55% TS with a 13-9 record and some bad defense, especially in the finals.</p>

<p>Tatum averaged 25/10/6 2.5 TOs on 55% TS with a 16-3 record and great defense.</p>

<p>Luka has an argument for sure but honestly his numbers aren’t much better and considering the defense gap and the better offball play from Tatum I’d give him the edge.</p>

<p>Ofc I’m biased but Luka didn’t have that great of a playoffs where I’d give him the edge over someone with comparable stat lines and much more success</p>

      <label for="liw2itp" class="commentText"><p>I mean yeah, stats aren&rsquo;t as convincing, but you also have to consider that Luka was injured through whole playoffs. Also, while Tatum was better on defense obviously, he himself was in a major shooting slump whole playoffs. His team is incredibly stacked, he didn&rsquo;t win finals mvp because he didn&rsquo;t perform up to that level. He obviously played good, but you can&rsquo;t say he carried the team. Everyone on a Celtics team was great, so practically no competition could be provided in any round.</p>

<p>Luka on the other hand had multiple games where he carried Mavs to victory. He did has his problems, but he did actually play good defence in Clippers series, had several clutch performances in Clippers and OKC series, including incredible block on Shai in game 6. He was the main reason behind Mavs comeback in game 1 against the wolves, scoring I think 15 points in 4th quarter. In game two he had a game winner over Rudy Gobert. In game 5 he put all Timberwolves hopes to comeback away in the first quarter.</p>

<p>And even in the finals, he still was the best player I think. Kyrie disappeared for the most of the series, and Luka had to carry Mavs whole offense alone, and almost succeeded at that in game 2. Obviously he had bad games, and really struggled on defense, but that&rsquo;s because his injuries caught up to him while practically no one else could do anything. You put prime MJ in that situation and he wouldn&rsquo;t find it easy too.</p>

<p>In the end, for Celtics I can&rsquo;t put Tatum or even Brown as a unanimous MVP for them. All their players had several games with outstanding performances that carried them to victory. If anything, Brad Stevens is the MVP for this playoffs, because of how good of a team he created. But among players I don&rsquo;t think anyone was as important as Luka was this year</p>

      <label for="liwg7p6" class="commentText"><p>For me the injury doesn’t matter because while it may have hindered him that doesn’t really matter for the question of who was the best this playoffs. Sucks that it hampered him but that made him objectively a worse player than he normally is and that matters when talking about who played best in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Also, while Tatum was in a slump, his TS was identical to Luka’s. Tatum has the benefit of better spacing sure, but teams would pretty often send help early and often, such as in the Mavs series where Tatum was seeing harder doubles than Luka in that whole series. Defensive attention really wasn’t that different, it’s more just that the Celtics others were more able to take advantage than the Mavs.</p>

<p>I agree Stevens is the MVP but Luka and Tatum had the same efficiency, Luka had 4 more ppg and 2 more apg, Tatum had 1 more rebound and 2 less turnovers, along with noticeably better defense.</p>

<p>I think that Tatum deserves the Playoff MVP</p>

      <label for="livnah1" class="commentText"><p>I love JB but yes, there is a real argument.</p>

<p>Luka averaged like 29 PPG and led a 5th seed to the Finals. I personally thought he was pretty up-and-down in the playoffs and I just can’t convince myself to say he was the PMVP when he played the way he did in the Finals but there is certainly a strong argument to be made for him.</p>

<p>Tatum led the Celtics in points, rebounds and assists and you can definitely say that Brown wouldn’t have had nearly the same success without Tatum taking the brunt of the defense’s attention, but Tatum was quite inefficient as a scorer.</p>

<p>unfortunately I think it’s nearly impossible to have an unbiased and nuanced debate about the three of them on this sub honestly. its obvious that people here (and the NBA fandom in general) lean pro-Luka and anti-Celtics</p>

<p>I dislike Luka a lot more than I do anyone on the Celtics, and I still think it&rsquo;s very obviously him out of the 3 candidates if winning the championship isn&rsquo;t a requirement for this award.</p>

<p>Honestly I don&rsquo;t think anyone this year was impressive for more than one series. Luka was great against Wolves, but outside of that it wasn&rsquo;t great. Shai was good against Dallas, but pretty bad against Pelicans. Ant started well, but slowed down eventually and you can name many more players.</p>

      <label for="livckdi" class="commentText"><p>this is tough.</p>

<p>Tatum was truly fantastic as a playmaker, rebounder and defender, and leading a championship team in all 3 major statistical categories is a very rare achievement. but he was pretty mediocre as a scorer and had some really ugly shooting lines.</p>

<p>Luka led the playoffs in all 3 major statistical categories and may have had the best single shot of the postseason, but was quite inefficient by his standards and was horrendous defensively in the Finals.</p>

<p>Brown scored efficiently from the field, made massive clutch plays throughout the postseason and played outstanding perimeter defense, but he clearly didn’t carry the same offensive burden as guys like Tatum or Luka or even Ant.</p>

<p>Ant is the other guy that came to mind for me but his run was a tale of two halves. over the first 8 games he averaged 32/7/6 on 67.3 TS% as the Wolves went 6-2, then over the final 8 games he dropped to 23/8/7 on 51.7 TS% as the Wolves went 3-5. but leading the fucking Minnesota Timberwolves to the WCF for the second time ever is pretty crazy.</p>

<p>imo you could pick any of these 4 and have a leg to stand on. I’d personally go with Brown though</p>

      <label for="liv9r0i" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s so hard because none of these feels right to vote. Jaylen Brown is the only one that played up to his regular season stats, but his stats aren&rsquo;t as good as Luka&rsquo;s. Luka statistically looks like the best, but his team lost, and he was nowhere near his regular season averages. Tatum shot pretty poorly in the playoffs as well. I think Jaylen Brown is the only one of these players that had a &ldquo;good&rdquo; playoffs, so it&rsquo;s gotta be him. He also got the Finals MVP as well.</p>

      <label for="livfwqv" class="commentText"><p>Luka was hobbled and still led his team to the finals. Now, I&rsquo;m of the mind that if you&rsquo;re on the court, then there&rsquo;s no excuses, and he was legitimately bad in some playoff games this year. Even still, I think his playoff highs outweigh his playoff lows - because that&rsquo;s how good he was in those highs.</p>

<p>If Luka wasn&rsquo;t playing on one leg, I think he would have far fewer bad games and been much closer to his regular season stats. Since this is a made-up award for Reddit, I&rsquo;m gonna go with my personal bias and say that context matters and Luka is Playoff MVP.</p>

      <label for="livrfh3" class="commentText"><p>For me I don’t really give injury any contextual value in the case of who was the best player in any given time frame. Sure Luka may have been noticeable better than the Jays if he were healthy but that’s not really relevant to the simple question of “who was the best in the playoffs.” Not the best considering circumstances, just who played the best. Luka, partly due to his injury, didn’t play well enough for me to say it’s him.</p>
