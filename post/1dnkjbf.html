      <label for="la3bl09" class="commentText"><p>Everyone talks about how good the Celtics are and how talented they are but this kinda stuff is really what brings this team to a new level. The adjustments and ability to adjust to what the Mavs did defensively and offensively was so huge and arguably biggest difference. Minimized the amount of pressure on each individual player and allowed the team room for error. It&rsquo;s videos like this that truly make me realize how much we&rsquo;re getting robbed by the Stephen A&rsquo;s and skip baylesses of the world where they result to &ldquo;oh team A just tried harder&rdquo; or &ldquo;oh player x has just been an embarrassment&rdquo;. Like on one hand yeah its a make and miss league, the Mavs role players missed tons of open shots above the break all series long, but that was also exactly what Boston wanted them to shoot. Literally guarding the pass to Kyrie instead of the open 3&rsquo;s from Dallas role players all series long then adjusting on offense to move lively away from the rim whenever possible, and doing it no matter the adjustment Dallas made to fix that. Cool to see the coaching battles that takes place over a series and how long it takes for each team to figure out an adjustment that works.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s so much that goes on every play that it feels criminal that it takes a random guy on YouTube doing these videos to get an actual breakdown of what&rsquo;s happening throughout a series. Glad the nba channel put up his videos cause I&rsquo;d rather watch every video he&rsquo;s ever put out than watch the absolute hypothetical nonsense being spewed on ESPN and 90% of sports shows and podcasts nowadays.</p>

      <label for="la3i588" class="commentText"><p>Just an insanely connected team. I think the coaching goes a long way but itâ€™s also the continuity the core has with each other and then bringing in additions like Jrue who can make himself feel like heâ€™s been there for forever.</p>

<p>Great top to bottom of the organization from Ainge/Brad to Joe to the staff to the stars to the bench unit.</p>

      <label for="la3wu60" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d say one of the unsung heroes of this season for the Celtics was Mazzulla an his coaching staff. The players rightfully get most of the limelight, but Mazzulla&rsquo;s growth from last season has been amazing to witness as well.</p>

<p>Last year Mazzulla was put in a terrible position for a HC with essentially no prep time to properly install his system on either end of the floor(if I remember right he became HC just 1 or 2 weeks before the season because of the Udoka scandal), a coaching staff he didn&rsquo;t get to choose, and then he also lost 2 of his top assistants during the course of the season as well. It didn&rsquo;t help him that his main big man trio of Horford, Grant Williams and Robert Williams were all worse in 2023 than in 2022 as well(Horford had a bit of age related falloff, Rob wasn&rsquo;t the same player post-meniscus tear surgery, and Grant was just bad to the point he oftentimes fell out of the rotation after a fantastic 2022 playoffs).</p>

<p>This season we finally got to see the proper realization of Mazzulla Ball, which despite what some people say is not just &ldquo;taking 3&rsquo;s&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s creating and taking the <em>right kind of 3&rsquo;s</em>. And then on defense the team was smart enough and well coached enough to be able to communicate at a high level on things like pre-switching, knowing what shots they wanted to takeaway, and who they were willing to leave open.</p>

<p>The Celtics are undoubtedly a super talented and deep team, but make no mistake, they did not cruise to a title on talent alone. Joe Mazzulla helped this team to reach the heights they did with good coaching on both ends of the floor that took full advantage of his team&rsquo;s strengths while minimizing the opponent&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m really glad to see that he&rsquo;s finally been getting his flowers of late.</p>

Turns out it was the other way around. They didn&rsquo;t even get 2 games LOL</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If y&rsquo;all are hitting your 3&rsquo;s, I can see the Cs taking 2 games. But if they don&rsquo;t or fail to have a 10 point lead with 3m left&hellip; they&rsquo;re cooked. The Mavs are that good.</p>
