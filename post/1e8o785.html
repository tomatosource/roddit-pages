      <p>I know a lot of fans got tired of Lebron constantly making it to the finals during the 2010 decades. Did you all feel the same way about Jordan constantly winning in the 90s? I know how popular Jordan was and still is but did anyone ever get tired of Jordan’s constant winning like how many got tired of Lebron’s constant winning?</p>

      <label for="le8j0yh" class="commentText"><p>As a Pistons fan, it went through multiple phases:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Early &lsquo;90s: Not a fan of the Bulls on account of the well-established rivalry with the Bad Boys. By &lsquo;93, the Pistons were less relevant but I was rooting for the Suns because I wanted someone different to win.</p></li>

<li><p>1995: Michael Jordan&rsquo;s return was exciting and he almost felt like an underdog so that was fun. Each &ldquo;vintage&rdquo; thing he did was thrilling—the game-winner against Atlanta, the double-nickel against New York, the switch back to jersey no. 23 against Orlando. That year was a real turning point, where I became more appreciative of Michael Jordan.</p></li>

<li><p>1996: Fun to watch them chase history. Became a novelty to watch them, a feeling very similar to what I felt watching the 2016 Warriors. Hearing about them losing a game felt like an event. I was at a trading card show when they lost a regular season game to the expansion Raptors (or maybe it was the morning after) and you could hear people murmuring about it everywhere.</p></li>

<li><p>1997 &amp; 1998: Some winners fatigue, for sure. I didn&rsquo;t hate them like younger me did during the Bad Boys era but I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded if a team came through and took them out. That being said, I was mesmorized by his final sequence and game-winning shot against Utah in 1998. It was a moment in time.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Not to pit the two against each other but since you brought it up, I saw the LeBron era differently. Whereas Jordan&rsquo;s teams always seemed to have the advantage as long as he wasn&rsquo;t returning from sabbaticals, LeBron&rsquo;s teams often felt like they had uphill battles, which made things feel a bit more riveting (except for the Miami years, my least favorite of the LeBron years). That&rsquo;s not intended as a commentary of who&rsquo;s better (since team construction plays such a big role) but rather it&rsquo;s just a take on my feelings watching both.</p>

<p>It was irritating at first, and eventually became interesting. I really enjoyed the through-lines between those Detroit title teams and the Jordan dynasty, but honestly I really didn’t appreciate Jordan himself properly until he was near the end. He was just so good that it kinda became boring to me as an NBA fan, I guess?</p>

      <label for="le8otlo" class="commentText"><p>Pistons fans also&hellip;</p>

<p>Those 1st two championships felt manufactured, the league basically changed the rules so he could win.</p>

<p>The turning point for people was the 1993 title. I think people don&rsquo;t realize how good that series was, it only went 6 but it had great moments, solid play, deep rosters of very well known players. It was a true heavyweight but in terms of NBA matchups.</p>

<p>Then Jordan retired.</p>

<p>When he came back in 1995, people weren&rsquo;t sure if the Bulls had the juice to get past Orlando. Then the trade for Rodman basically was literally like when GSW signed KD, the championship was a forgone conclusion and Lakers Record was in play immediately. I was a 12 and everyone knew it was going to be Chicago v Orlando basically for the NBA championship.</p>

<p>I know stat nerds will give 20 reasons stat wise Rodman wasn&rsquo;t that big of an impact but it was really that big of a signing.</p>

<p>Just like when Boston got Jrue Holiday this season and everyone said okay who is playing for second. I know I said it last summer. The Celtics this past season is probably one of the best teams in NBA history when you look at their capabilities.</p>

<p>In addition, I remember somebody around here once fittingly calling Isiah Thomas something like, &ldquo;chronically available&rdquo; or something to that effect, meaning he accepts an ample amount of invites on talk shows, podcasts, radio shows, etc. and hosts <em>always</em> want to circle back to the same topics regarding Jordan &amp; the Olympics and Isiah&rsquo;s always willing to oblige those hosts so it just keeps getting stirred up every couple years.</p>

<p>I also think a lot of nuance to the rivalry &amp; dispute is both lost over time and glorified, with many modern fans understandably utilizing <em>The Last Dance</em> as their primary and sole point of reference.</p>

Then they used their mle on mike miller.  That left them with nothing but veteran minimum contracts to fill the other 9 roles on the roster.</p>

<p>It got much better after a few years as they got access to another MLE and the BAE and ring chasers came out of the woodwork</p>

      <label for="le9ea6m" class="commentText"><p>It’s interesting how no one brings up Jordan’s uphill battles.</p>

<p>You spoke of Jordan’s dominance and LeBron’s uphill battles but fail to mention Jordan getting drafted to a garbage Bulls team and getting dumped out of the playoffs until he became and the Bulls became what they were. Jordan was always an anomaly on the Bulls, but that team was built from the ground up and mostly stayed together as a core, rather than people making super teams. The only argument for super team is them grabbing Rodman.</p>

<p>They also respected how amazing he was. There wasn&rsquo;t debate about it.</p>

Way more haters/doubters after the baseball thing and partial season loss to orlando.</p>

<p>The series against Reggie was extra fun from a neutral perspective, two ice cold assholes going at each other, clear david/goliath thing</p>

<p>His whole style was also just so methodical too, it was hard not to appreciate how easily he got to his spots and knocked down shots, like the defense was just a formality some times</p>

Indiana was the 3rd seed in the east. Everybody gets that the bulls were dominant and likely at least a comfortable favorite again anybody, but generally speaking, David vs Goliiath would be if they faced a bottom seed, and a weak one at that. Do you honestly feel like David and Goliath fits, or is there a chance maybe it was wrong choice of words?</p>

      <label for="le8xn7a" class="commentText"><p>Did you see the series? Miller averaged 17 while Jordan nearly had 32. The Pacers were incredibly deep with 5 guys averaging in double figures that series. I still can&rsquo;t believe how we lost game 7, both Jordan and Pippen had terrible shooting nights but we got completely outrebounded: 22-4 on the offensive glass.  Such a wasted opportunity.</p>

That being said, it was a privilege to watch Jordan, Pippen, Kukoc and Rodman do their thing.  As a fan, I can confidently say that no other player has ever put the fear of God in me like Jordan did.  Every time he touched the ball, you felt like he was going to score.  I felt bad for some of the other greats at the time never winning a ring, but it was a helluva thing to witness.</p>

      <label for="le8k5v7" class="commentText"><p>Personally, I rooted against Jordan in every single series, especially against the Lakers and Jazz.</p>

<p>I was a huge Magic Johnson supporter and at the time there definitely was an active debate:  Magic or Jordan?</p>

<p>I’m old enough to have been influenced by Magic and Bird, so pass-first, no-look dishes were what I grew up on.  Who was the better player?  The one who made his team better, or the one who was individually better?</p>

<p>After game 1 of the Lakers series, the answer seemed clear: Magic’s ability to include his teammates made him better.  This was exemplified at the end of the game with Magic hitting Sam Perkins for the game winner.</p>

<p>What I didn’t see, however, was that Jordan no longer was a 1-man team.  He included his teammates enough that his individual prowess shined even brighter.  By game 4, it was clear that Jordan was far superior to Johnson.</p>

<p>From then on, and to answer your question, there was a feeling of inevitability to Jordan.  The Blazers were not in the ballpark; the Suns were, but I do not believe the Bulls lose a game 7 (even in Phoenix). </p>

<p>The Jazz were right there with them.  To me, those were the closest sets of series.  However, when it got to crunch time, the Bulls had Jordan (whereas the Jazz relied on an extremely clutch John Stockton) and that was the difference.  
Again, there was a sense of inevitability at the end of every game.</p>

      <label for="le8rmi4" class="commentText"><p>For me, it was like watching a unicorn. Absolutely incredible and you knew you were witnessing history.</p>

<p>Jordan and the Bulls just had an aura about them. It was “must see” television.  The theme that would play during home games as the starting lineup was announced, the NBA on NBC theme that was synonymous with the playoffs and Finals. It was all so iconic.</p>

<p>You just somehow knew that Jordan and the Bulls were on their way to another championship. I will take to my grave that had Jordan not retired, the Bulls would have won 8 straight (fuck, Bulls/Rockets Finals would have been amazing!)</p>

<p>Of course, the only time I rooted against them was when they played my lowly Nuggets, but other than that, I loved watching Jordan and watching historical greatness.</p>

<p>I am sure that there were plenty of fans though at the time (Knicks, Pacers, Pistons etc) that couldn’t stand them though, I was just in my own teenage bubble and appreciated watching the best player of all time.</p>

      <label for="le8xxne" class="commentText"><p>You keep seeing replies using the same word- inevitable. That&rsquo;s the thing that people who weren&rsquo;t around to witness it will never fully comprehend: there was an air of inevitability to those Jordan Bulls teams that has no parallel and probably never will. No matter the circumstances, you knew they&rsquo;d find a way to win, and no matter your rooting interests, you couldn&rsquo;t help but be amazed as they did it. The things Jordan and the Bulls accomplished on the court had even their most ardent haters giving them respect. It was amazing to watch and infuriating to witness, but you had to respect them because you could literally see the hard work and will and dedication right there on the court, kicking the shit out of your favorite team in the fourth quarter. It was a singular experience in the realm of competitive sport and it grew the game exponentially no matter your rooting interests because it was just so beautiful to behold. Watching Michael methodically get to his spots in crunch time even though everyone on the planet knew what was coming was magical.</p>

      <label for="le8zxu3" class="commentText"><p>He was the most competitive player to ever play the game. He never got lazy, he never gave up, he never thought the game was over until the buzzer. If there was a chance he could win it, he would win it. The level of skill and tenacity is unrivaled. That’s what people that sadly didn’t get to watch him and only see clips will never understand. That man did not like to sit out, he loved to play and he rose to the challenge, every single time. So for a team going up against them, you knew nothing was safe and that they would find a way, which, to be fair… they did.</p>

      <label for="le8y8n5" class="commentText"><p>The idea that Jordan was universally loved in the 90s, especially the late 90s is grossly exaggerated.</p>

<p>I would argue that he WAS almost universally loved in the 80s and that carried into the early 90s diminishing as the first three peat was completed.</p>

<p>Fans generally love a champion, but winner’s fatigue is real and fans also generally root for the underdog.</p>

<p>There were plenty of non-team specific fans rooting against Jordan and the Bulls during the second three peat.</p>

<p>One thing that isn’t in question is whether Jordan was universally respected and almost unanimously seen as the greatest of all time.</p>

<p>He was.</p>

<p>Most people had never witnessed the type of dominance Jordan’s Bulls displayed in any sport at that time. And we haven’t since.</p>

      <label for="le9dvbu" class="commentText"><p>Respectfully, he couldn&rsquo;t have. And I say this as a reformed Lebron hater turned fan in his later years.</p>

<p>Krause gets a lot of shit (deservedly) but he made moves to progress the team in the 80s and sustainable success, the Bulls were miles ahead the best org in the league for a decade, outside of MJ. We were still respectable contenders with Phil and Scottie when MJ retired and the league was wide open in 94&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The Cavs for Lebrons first stint did absolutely nothing to build around a raw young Lebron. They thought a 38 year old obese shaq was a good move to pair with a 26 year old Lebron. I&rsquo;m convinced those wasted 7 years gave him PTSD and created &ldquo;LeGm&rdquo;. They cost him at LEAST a ring in that era with how good he was so young in that weak east, and then showed nothing but resentment like he owed them something.</p>

      <label for="le8ptp3" class="commentText"><p>So many have never seen MJ play. But watching him win 6 out of 10 years in the 90’s was just a continuation from what we saw when Magic/Bird won 8 out 10 in the 1980’s.</p>

<p>We also saw MJ fail (yes MJ didn’t win every game) to get his teams past the Celtics and Pistons in the Eastern Conference for years, so it was good to see him get over the hump. Plus, MJ was a real crossover superstar and even people’s mothers and grandparents wanted him to win.</p>

<p>Closest comp, feeling-wise, was Brady. But, big difference, it seemed like unless they were a die hard for another team, <em>every</em>-effing-body rooted for the Bulls, whereas it seemed like only Pats (or Bucs, at the end)  fans really rooted for Brady.</p>

<p>As a huge NBA fan of the 90s who rooted for a Bulls rival (in Pacers&rsquo; fans&rsquo; minds, at least), most of the 90s were insufferable.</p>

And this was before social media, if the conversations in bars back then were put online it would be as toxic as anything we see these days</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not restricted to MJ, of course.  Every superstar in every sport a) gets a whistle that&rsquo;s a little more generous than other players&rsquo;, but b) gets a ton of hate for it, probably disproporionate to how soft that whistle is</p>

      <label for="le913ti" class="commentText"><p>As a Knicks fan, it was brutal. Each year we had a great team that was finally ready to punch through, and each year they snuffed us out. That’s how it felt, anyway. I appreciated and respected them though, their elite quality was hard to deny. And Jordan was a force of nature, like trying to battle the ocean, it seemed inevitable that somehow he’d find a way to win regardless of circumstances. His flu game was the iconic moment for me.</p>

<p>Jordan was compelling because he was an unbeatable monster waiting for you. There was no confidence going into the finals against Jordan. You were a gladiator, brought there to be slaughtered.</p>

<p>Lebron was just always there. He&rsquo;s incredible, but beatable. (He is astounding. He just doesn&rsquo;t have the same otherworldly presence or ability to flat out choose to dominate. )</p>

Watching the Bulls just was an event bc every night Jordan played…it was Jordan. A bunch of us on our floor would crowd into a room and watch it on a tiny crap CRT tv and ditch any studying we have. I couldn’t even be mad at the Bulls and Jordan. The shit he did night in and night out was ridiculous and that team was just dominant. It was a phenomenon and could not be replicated. Maybe the closest thing in recent history are the GSW warriors in terms of team domination, but no one comes close to Jordan.</p>

I think many people hated LeBron once he formed a superteam before he even won. If anything LeBron winning helped people like him more. Closest thing I felt to hating those 90s Bulls were those early 00s Lakers. I didn’t hate the 80s Lakers cause I hated those Celtics at the time.</p>

      <label for="le9fqkc" class="commentText"><p>I think that most casuals liked the Jordan storyline back then, but fans of other teams often felt like the league was fixed and had special &lsquo;jordan rules.&rsquo;</p>

<p>talk to any fan of teams like the knicks or utah or detroit from back then about how jordan was officiated vs those teams - that push off on byron russell during jordan&rsquo;s flu game being the most egregious.</p>

      <label for="le9fvnd" class="commentText"><p>He was just the best.  I mean you couldn&rsquo;t blame him or be angry, the dude was just that fucking good and so were his cast.  Pippen was fucking good.  Horace Grant maybe top 5 most underrated player of all time.  Kukoc was really fucking good.  Ron Harper was really fucking good. Bj Armstrong was really good. Rodman, incredibly elite.  Phil Jackson is one of the goats.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t a bulls fan, and they beat my team growing up in the finals.  But watching mj and the bulls, you were just like, well, they are that fucking good and you just kind of accepted it.</p>

      <label for="le9gnjl" class="commentText"><p>Jazz fan here. I quit watching basketball for a long time after ‘98. Still have PTSD from those two finals series. I hated Karl Malone way before I knew he was a pedophile, because he kept missing such crucial free throws.</p>

<p>Still loved Jordan though. I had been an Air Jordan wearing super fan as a little kid, so watching a historic feat was still special.</p>

<p>Also, he didn’t push.</p>

      <label for="le8qsnk" class="commentText"><p>Probably how I felt the entirety of the 2010s when Lebron/Warriors won everything. It was such a breath of fresh air when the Raptors won in 2019, and it was the first time since the 2011 Mavs that I enjoyed a Finals champion. The NBA has been much more enjoyable for me personally since we&rsquo;ve got more parity after that Raptors championship, even if LeBron and the Warriors have each won one since then.</p>

      <label for="le98qrl" class="commentText"><p>Jordan was treated like a deity by national media during games. If he ever missed a shot it was never &ldquo;Oh he was a little off there&rdquo; no, it was &ldquo;Oh no, he must have hurt his wrist yesterday while he was fishing!!!!&rdquo;  It was so annoying haha.</p>

<p>Also the singular focus on him took away from the team aspect of the game. The guy did not win all those games on his own.</p>
