    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I know a lot of fans got tired of Lebron constantly making it to the finals during the 2010 decades. Did you all feel the same way about Jordan constantly winning in the 90s? I know how popular Jordan was and still is but did anyone ever get tired of Jordan’s constant winning like how many got tired of Lebron’s constant winning?</p>

      <label for="le8j0yh" class="commentText"><p>As a Pistons fan, it went through multiple phases:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Early &lsquo;90s: Not a fan of the Bulls on account of the well-established rivalry with the Bad Boys. By &lsquo;93, the Pistons were less relevant but I was rooting for the Suns because I wanted someone different to win.</p></li>

<li><p>1995: Michael Jordan&rsquo;s return was exciting and he almost felt like an underdog so that was fun. Each &ldquo;vintage&rdquo; thing he did was thrilling—the game-winner against Atlanta, the double-nickel against New York, the switch back to jersey no. 23 against Orlando. That year was a real turning point, where I became more appreciative of Michael Jordan.</p></li>

<li><p>1996: Fun to watch them chase history. Became a novelty to watch them, a feeling very similar to what I felt watching the 2016 Warriors. Hearing about them losing a game felt like an event. I was at a trading card show when they lost a regular season game to the expansion Raptors (or maybe it was the morning after) and you could hear people murmuring about it everywhere.</p></li>

<li><p>1997 &amp; 1998: Some winners fatigue, for sure. I didn&rsquo;t hate them like younger me did during the Bad Boys era but I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded if a team came through and took them out. That being said, I was mesmorized by his final sequence and game-winning shot against Utah in 1998. It was a moment in time.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Not to pit the two against each other but since you brought it up, I saw the LeBron era differently. Whereas Jordan&rsquo;s teams always seemed to have the advantage as long as he wasn&rsquo;t returning from sabbaticals, LeBron&rsquo;s teams often felt like they had uphill battles, which made things feel a bit more riveting (except for the Miami years, my least favorite of the LeBron years). That&rsquo;s not intended as a commentary of who&rsquo;s better (since team construction plays such a big role) but rather it&rsquo;s just a take on my feelings watching both.</p>

      <label for="le8otlo" class="commentText"><p>Pistons fans also&hellip;</p>

<p>Those 1st two championships felt manufactured, the league basically changed the rules so he could win.</p>

<p>The turning point for people was the 1993 title. I think people don&rsquo;t realize how good that series was, it only went 6 but it had great moments, solid play, deep rosters of very well known players. It was a true heavyweight but in terms of NBA matchups.</p>

<p>Then Jordan retired.</p>

<p>When he came back in 1995, people weren&rsquo;t sure if the Bulls had the juice to get past Orlando. Then the trade for Rodman basically was literally like when GSW signed KD, the championship was a forgone conclusion and Lakers Record was in play immediately. I was a 12 and everyone knew it was going to be Chicago v Orlando basically for the NBA championship.</p>

<p>I know stat nerds will give 20 reasons stat wise Rodman wasn&rsquo;t that big of an impact but it was really that big of a signing.</p>

<p>Just like when Boston got Jrue Holiday this season and everyone said okay who is playing for second. I know I said it last summer. The Celtics this past season is probably one of the best teams in NBA history when you look at their capabilities.</p>

<p>It was irritating at first, and eventually became interesting. I really enjoyed the through-lines between those Detroit title teams and the Jordan dynasty, but honestly I really didn’t appreciate Jordan himself properly until he was near the end. He was just so good that it kinda became boring to me as an NBA fan, I guess?</p>

      <label for="le8tv8k" class="commentText"><p>They&rsquo;re both too old for it.</p>

<p>In addition, I remember somebody around here once fittingly calling Isiah Thomas something like, &ldquo;chronically available&rdquo; or something to that effect, meaning he accepts an ample amount of invites on talk shows, podcasts, radio shows, etc. and hosts <em>always</em> want to circle back to the same topics regarding Jordan &amp; the Olympics and Isiah&rsquo;s always willing to oblige those hosts so it just keeps getting stirred up every couple years.</p>

<p>I also think a lot of nuance to the rivalry &amp; dispute is both lost over time and glorified, with many modern fans understandably utilizing <em>The Last Dance</em> as their primary and sole point of reference.</p>

Way more haters/doubters after the baseball thing and partial season loss to orlando.</p>

<p>The series against Reggie was extra fun from a neutral perspective, two ice cold assholes going at each other, clear david/goliath thing</p>

<p>His whole style was also just so methodical too, it was hard not to appreciate how easily he got to his spots and knocked down shots, like the defense was just a formality some times</p>

<p>what purpose do you have to tell me my experience is wrong? That series felt VERY MJ vs Reggie, both teams had been elite-ish for a decade and not played each other, both teams ran their offense through a star shooting guard, they had different styles, reggie being much weaker lol</p>

That being said, it was a privilege to watch Jordan, Pippen, Kukoc and Rodman do their thing.  As a fan, I can confidently say that no other player has ever out the fear of God in me like Jordan did.  Every time he touched the ball, you felt like he was going to score.  I felt bad for some of the other greats at the time never winning a ring, but it was a helluva thing to witness.</p>

      <label for="le8k5v7" class="commentText"><p>Personally, I rooted against Jordan in every single series, especially against the Lakers and Jazz.</p>

<p>I was a huge Magic Johnson supporter and at the time there definitely was an active debate:  Magic or Jordan?</p>

<p>I’m old enough to have been influenced by Magic and Bird, so pass-first, no-look dishes were what I grew up on.  Who was the better player?  The one who made his team better, or the one who was individually better?</p>

<p>After game 1 of the Lakers series, the answer seemed clear: Magic’s ability to include his teammates made him better.  This was exemplified at the end of the game with Magic hitting Sam Perkins for the game winner.</p>

<p>What I didn’t see, however, was that Jordan no longer was a 1-man team.  He included his teammates enough that his individual prowess shined even brighter.  By game 4, it was clear that Jordan was far superior to Johnson.</p>

<p>From then on, and to answer your question, there was a feeling of inevitability to Jordan.  The Blazers were not in the ballpark; the Suns were, but I do not believe the Bulls lose a game 7 (even in Phoenix). </p>

<p>The Jazz were right there with them.  To me, those were the closest sets of series.  However, when it got to crunch time, the Bulls had Jordan (whereas the Jazz relied on an extremely clutch John Stockton) and that was the difference.  
Again, there was a sense of inevitability at the end of every game.</p>

To be honest it was a lot more enjoyable to witness that kind of dominance before hot take culture and social media gave a massive platform to the amount of toxicity we see these days.</p>

<p>If MJ was doing this now I bet the discourse would be a lot different, which is kind of a shame, because it feels like these days all the hate gets more traction than the appreciation we should have for superstar players.</p>

<p>Closest comp, feeling-wise, was Brady. But, big difference, it seemed like unless they were a die hard for another team, <em>every</em>-effing-body rooted for the Bulls, whereas it seemed like only Pats (or Bucs, at the end)  fans really rooted for Brady.</p>

<p>As a huge NBA fan of the 90s who rooted for a Bulls rival (in Pacers&rsquo; fans&rsquo; minds, at least), most of the 90s were insufferable.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not restricted to MJ, of course.  Every superstar in every sport a) gets a whistle that&rsquo;s a little more generous than other players&rsquo;, but b) gets a ton of hate for it, probably disproporionate to how soft that whistle is</p>

<p>We also saw MJ fail (yes MJ didn’t win every game) to get his teams past the Celtics and Pistons in the Eastern Conference for years, so it was good to see him get over the hump. Plus, MJ was a real crossover superstar and even people’s mothers and grandparents wanted him to win.</p>

It was such a breath of fresh air when the Raptors won in 2019, and it was the first time since the 2011 Mavs that I enjoyed a Finals champion. The NBA has been much more enjoyable for me personally since we&rsquo;ve got more parity after that Raptors championship, even if LeBron and the Warriors have each won one since then.</p>

      <label for="le8rmi4" class="commentText"><p>For me, it was like watching a unicorn. Absolutely incredible and you knew you were witnessing history.</p>

<p>Jordan and the Bulls just had an aura about them. It was “must see” television.  The theme that would play during home games as the starting lineup was announced, the NBA on NBC theme that was synonymous with the playoffs and Finals. It was all so iconic.</p>

<p>You just somehow knew that Jordan and the Bulls were on their way to another championship. I will take to my grave that had Jordan not retired, the Bulls would have won 8 straight (fuck, Bulls/Rockets Finals would have been amazing!)</p>

<p>Of course, the only time I rooted against them was when they played my lowly Nuggets, but other than that, I loved watching Jordan and watching historical greatness.</p>

<p>I am sure that there were plenty of fans though at the time (Knicks, Pacers, Pistons etc) that couldn’t stand them though, I was just in my own teenage bubble and appreciated watching the best player of all time.</p>

      <label for="le8uaq3" class="commentText"><p>As a Celtics fan I hated Jordan so much.  But then you realized his greatness and dominance.  He was so good at everything that eventually you realized that there is very little you can hate him for, especially after his dad got murdered.</p>

<p>This dominance is why people defend Jordan as the goat against Lebron.  When Jordan played you felt like you had no shot against him….Ive never felt that way watching Lebron.</p>

      <label for="le8vw4k" class="commentText"><p>As a die hard Utah Jazz fan I was absolutely devastated. Our fan base always felt like the team was given no respect. They took years and years to finally make it to the finals….and then had to face Jordan in his prime! It was heartbreaking.</p>

<p>It took me a good 10-15 years to start appreciating him and the Bulls for their talent and I’ll even buy Jordan-branded Nike for my son today (never would have been caught dead in it back in the day).</p>
