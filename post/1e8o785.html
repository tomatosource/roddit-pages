      <p>I know a lot of fans got tired of Lebron constantly making it to the finals during the 2010 decades. Did you all feel the same way about Jordan constantly winning in the 90s? I know how popular Jordan was and still is but did anyone ever get tired of Jordan’s constant winning like how many got tired of Lebron’s constant winning?</p>

      <label for="le8j0yh" class="commentText"><p>As a Pistons fan, it went through multiple phases:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Early &lsquo;90s: Not a fan of the Bulls on account of the well-established rivalry with the Bad Boys. By &lsquo;93, the Pistons were less relevant but I was rooting for the Suns because I wanted someone different to win.</p></li>

<li><p>1995: Michael Jordan&rsquo;s return was exciting and he almost felt like an underdog so that was fun. Each &ldquo;vintage&rdquo; thing he did was thrilling—the game-winner against Atlanta, the double-nickel against New York, the switch back to jersey no. 23 against Orlando. That year was a real turning point, where I became more appreciative of Michael Jordan.</p></li>

<li><p>1996: Fun to watch them chase history. Became a novelty to watch them, a feeling very similar to what I felt watching the 2016 Warriors. Hearing about them losing a game felt like an event. I was at a trading card show when they lost a regular season game to the expansion Raptors (or maybe it was the morning after) and you could hear people murmuring about it everywhere.</p></li>

<li><p>1997 &amp; 1998: Some winners fatigue, for sure. I didn&rsquo;t hate them like younger me did during the Bad Boys era but I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded if a team came through and took them out. That being said, I was mesmorized by his final sequence and game-winning shot against Utah in 1998. It was a moment in time.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Not to pit the two against each other but since you brought it up, I saw the LeBron era differently. Whereas Jordan&rsquo;s teams always seemed to have the advantage as long as he wasn&rsquo;t returning from sabbaticals, LeBron&rsquo;s teams often felt like they had uphill battles, which made things feel a bit more riveting (except for the Miami years, my least favorite of the LeBron years). That&rsquo;s not intended as a commentary of who&rsquo;s better (since team construction plays such a big role) but rather it&rsquo;s just a take on my feelings watching both.</p>

<p>It was irritating at first, and eventually became interesting. I really enjoyed the through-lines between those Detroit title teams and the Jordan dynasty, but honestly I really didn’t appreciate Jordan himself properly until he was near the end. He was just so good that it kinda became boring to me as an NBA fan, I guess?</p>

      <label for="le9ea6m" class="commentText"><p>It’s interesting how no one brings up Jordan’s uphill battles.</p>

<p>You spoke of Jordan’s dominance and LeBron’s uphill battles but fail to mention Jordan getting drafted to a garbage Bulls team and getting dumped out of the playoffs until he became and the Bulls became what they were. Jordan was always an anomaly on the Bulls, but that team was built from the ground up and mostly stayed together as a core, rather than people making super teams. The only argument for super team is them grabbing Rodman.</p>

      <label for="le9mhx5" class="commentText"><p>To clarify, I was speaking on the &lsquo;90s Bulls alone on account of that being the era discussed by the original poster.</p>

<p>Jordan absolutely had an uphill battle in the &lsquo;80s and I concur that&rsquo;s broadly overlooked by outsiders. I even find the narrative that &ldquo;Jordan got in the weightroom and learned how to win and only then did it happen&rdquo; to be contrived and overdone. That dude was <em>always</em> insane. And while he did refine his game to some degree between 1987 and 1991, I always found the biggest x-factor to be that his team finally filled in around him (i.e. guys like Scottie and Horace finally coming into their own).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>As a Pistons fan who was also going through a pretty big Spurs phase at the time, I can say that Rodman was completely toxic at the time the Bulls picked him up (thus San Antonio only receiving Will Perdue in return). So even then, it felt a lot more like a calculated risk than creating a super team.  Of course, it all worked out and now we can talk about how the Bulls got him to meld into the team structure and whatnot but at the time, that was far from a guarantee.</p>

<p>In addition, I remember somebody around here once fittingly calling Isiah Thomas something like, &ldquo;chronically available&rdquo; or something to that effect, meaning he accepts an ample amount of invites on talk shows, podcasts, radio shows, etc. and hosts <em>always</em> want to circle back to the same topics regarding Jordan &amp; the Olympics and Isiah&rsquo;s always willing to oblige those hosts so it just keeps getting stirred up every couple years.</p>

<p>I also think a lot of nuance to the rivalry &amp; dispute is both lost over time and glorified, with many modern fans understandably utilizing <em>The Last Dance</em> as their primary and sole point of reference.</p>

      <label for="le9qcri" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s kind of what I was getting at with the thing about Isiah being perpetually available. Just searching &ldquo;Isiah Thomas pistons podcast&rdquo; on YouTube gets me hour-long interviews with Zeke on All The Smoke, TNT, The Pivot, Agee &amp; Gates, and The Draymond Green Show, all from the past year or so.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll say this though. As a Pistons fan (spanning across all eras), I&rsquo;ve listened to a few of those podcasts and I&rsquo;ll say that in most cases, the following things are true:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Isiah covers a broad range of topics, most of the interviews having little to do with the hot button stuff (from his upbringing, Bobby Knight&rsquo;s recruiting visit, whatever brand of wine he&rsquo;s trying to push, etc.).</p></li>

<li><p>Nobody in the media broadly cares about any of those topics enough to report on them (which, I mean, why would they at this point, they&rsquo;re entirely inconsequential and would draw no readers/viewers).</p></li>

<li><p>Nearly every single interiewer feels compelled to bring up the topic of the Bulls &amp; the Olympics to Isiah at some point in time during the interview. Isiah speaks on the topic; sometimes it&rsquo;s mundane and sometimes out comes a soundbite.</p></li>

<li><p>Media grabs those soundbites and hugs them to death. People click because it sounds juicy.</p></li>

<li><p>People can&rsquo;t help but weigh in with their own thoughts on a 30-year-old beef (as I am here).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>MJ, in turn, has been infamously reclusive since retirement. Outside of <em>The Last Dance</em>, we rarely hear his thoughts on anything, ever. And that&rsquo;s A-OK. But I think that&rsquo;s where the difference may lay.</p>

<p>If Isiah Thomas cared about his reputation, the best thing he could probably do would be to accept fewer interview invites and/or dictate what can and can&rsquo;t be discussed prior. Instead, it seems like he just sort of takes those interviews as they come.</p>

<p>Zeke wasn’t well liked. That Pistons team in general reminded me of the expression “a face only a mother could love”. I loved the hell out of them.</p>

<p>They also respected how amazing he was. There wasn&rsquo;t debate about it.</p>

<p>There also was no social media, so there really weren&rsquo;t negative stories that came out. One or two times the gambling rumors were present but almost everything around Michael was positive.</p>

Way more haters/doubters after the baseball thing and partial season loss to orlando.</p>

<p>The series against Reggie was extra fun from a neutral perspective, two ice cold assholes going at each other, clear david/goliath thing</p>

<p>His whole style was also just so methodical too, it was hard not to appreciate how easily he got to his spots and knocked down shots, like the defense was just a formality some times</p>

<p>This dominance is why people defend Jordan as the goat against Lebron.  When Jordan played you felt like you had no shot against him….Ive never felt that way watching Lebron.</p>

<p>Jordan had to ruin everything with his insane 41 points per game. Game 2-5 he got 42, 44, 55, 41. The Suns ran into what might be the greatest finals performance ever. Will never forget how Barkley walked off the floor in despair.</p>

      <label for="le8rmi4" class="commentText"><p>For me, it was like watching a unicorn. Absolutely incredible and you knew you were witnessing history.</p>

<p>Jordan and the Bulls just had an aura about them. It was “must see” television.  The theme that would play during home games as the starting lineup was announced, the NBA on NBC theme that was synonymous with the playoffs and Finals. It was all so iconic.</p>

<p>You just somehow knew that Jordan and the Bulls were on their way to another championship. I will take to my grave that had Jordan not retired, the Bulls would have won 8 straight (fuck, Bulls/Rockets Finals would have been amazing!)</p>

<p>Of course, the only time I rooted against them was when they played my lowly Nuggets, but other than that, I loved watching Jordan and watching historical greatness.</p>

<p>I am sure that there were plenty of fans though at the time (Knicks, Pacers, Pistons etc) that couldn’t stand them though, I was just in my own teenage bubble and appreciated watching the best player of all time.</p>

      <label for="le8xxne" class="commentText"><p>You keep seeing replies using the same word- inevitable. That&rsquo;s the thing that people who weren&rsquo;t around to witness it will never fully comprehend: there was an air of inevitability to those Jordan Bulls teams that has no parallel and probably never will. No matter the circumstances, you knew they&rsquo;d find a way to win, and no matter your rooting interests, you couldn&rsquo;t help but be amazed as they did it. The things Jordan and the Bulls accomplished on the court had even their most ardent haters giving them respect. It was amazing to watch and infuriating to witness, but you had to respect them because you could literally see the hard work and will and dedication right there on the court, kicking the shit out of your favorite team in the fourth quarter. It was a singular experience in the realm of competitive sport and it grew the game exponentially no matter your rooting interests because it was just so beautiful to behold. Watching Michael methodically get to his spots in crunch time even though everyone on the planet knew what was coming was magical.</p>

If there was a chance he could win it, he would win it. The level of skill and tenacity is unrivaled. That’s what people that sadly didn’t get to watch him and only see clips will never understand. That man did not like to sit out, he loved to play and he rose to the challenge, every single time. So for a team going up against them, you knew nothing was safe and that they would find a way, which, to be fair… they did.</p>

      <label for="leaaxok" class="commentText"><p>Exactly, and I&rsquo;d add that as a rival fan (Knicks fan here) it was just this constant feeling of dread.</p>

<p>No matter how well the game was going, or the series was going in the playoffs, in the back of your mind you were never confident and always afraid that he would find a way to win. People talk about Brady or Mahomes having plot armor seemingly but MJ had it to an extreme level, everything seemed to favor the Bulls and he always came through when it mattered. It was infuriating but in a deflating way, like there&rsquo;s just no one that can be as great as this dude.</p>

      <label for="leaea24" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s the reason MJ will always be the GOAT to me and there&rsquo;s no argument. LeBron is incredible, Kobe was a killer, Shaq was the most dominant player I&rsquo;ve ever seen, but MJ had you shook no matter the situation because you just knew his shots would start dropping in the fourth and no lead was safe. There are many unbelievable players that have come through the NBA but nobody felt as automatic as MJ and his Bulls. You could basically write them in at the season&rsquo;s outset as champs with a permanent marker during those runs in the 90s and wouldn&rsquo;t feel an ounce of trepidation about maybe being wrong. It was agonizing as a fan of another team but also amazing to behold. I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;ve never seen another like them since because it was deflating to know that no matter what your team did, they&rsquo;d eventually have to beat the Bulls to get over the hump and that wasn&rsquo;t going to happen.</p>

      <label for="leaqtnj" class="commentText"><p>And to me, this sums up the beauty and utility of r/NBA. Despite this place&rsquo;s problems with brainless hot takes and dumb memes and shitposts and whatever, it helps contextualize older eras of the NBA for younger fans and gives us oldheads some insight into the younger perspectives. When I was a kid, the best you could do for insight into the history of the game from a fan perspective was someone&rsquo;s burnout uncle or drive time radio or maybe some homer-ass book written by a reporter, but now we have this international sounding board of fans of every team from every era where we can meet to discuss the game. I learn a lot here and this thread is a perfect example of why: a bunch of disparate fans coming together to explain how watching our respective teams get flounced by the Bulls for most of a decade was a transcendent experience despite the frustration and illustrates for the youngins why no matter what LeBron or Kobe or anybody else does, MJ will always be our GOAT. R/nba might be the only place I&rsquo;ve ever had a conversation with a Knicks fan that didn&rsquo;t devolve into shit talking one another.</p>

      <label for="le8y8n5" class="commentText"><p>The idea that Jordan was universally loved in the 90s, especially the late 90s is grossly exaggerated.</p>

<p>I would argue that he WAS almost universally loved in the 80s and that carried into the early 90s diminishing as the first three peat was completed.</p>

<p>Fans generally love a champion, but winner’s fatigue is real and fans also generally root for the underdog.</p>

<p>There were plenty of non-team specific fans rooting against Jordan and the Bulls during the second three peat.</p>

<p>One thing that isn’t in question is whether Jordan was universally respected and almost unanimously seen as the greatest of all time.</p>

<p>He was.</p>

<p>Most people had never witnessed the type of dominance Jordan’s Bulls displayed in any sport at that time. And we haven’t since.</p>

That being said, it was a privilege to watch Jordan, Pippen, Kukoc and Rodman do their thing.  As a fan, I can confidently say that no other player has ever put the fear of God in me like Jordan did.  Every time he touched the ball, you felt like he was going to score.  I felt bad for some of the other greats at the time never winning a ring, but it was a helluva thing to witness.</p>

      <label for="le8k5v7" class="commentText"><p>Personally, I rooted against Jordan in every single series, especially against the Lakers and Jazz.</p>

<p>I was a huge Magic Johnson supporter and at the time there definitely was an active debate:  Magic or Jordan?</p>

<p>I’m old enough to have been influenced by Magic and Bird, so pass-first, no-look dishes were what I grew up on.  Who was the better player?  The one who made his team better, or the one who was individually better?</p>

<p>After game 1 of the Lakers series, the answer seemed clear: Magic’s ability to include his teammates made him better.  This was exemplified at the end of the game with Magic hitting Sam Perkins for the game winner.</p>

<p>What I didn’t see, however, was that Jordan no longer was a 1-man team.  He included his teammates enough that his individual prowess shined even brighter.  By game 4, it was clear that Jordan was far superior to Johnson.</p>

<p>From then on, and to answer your question, there was a feeling of inevitability to Jordan.  The Blazers were not in the ballpark; the Suns were, but I do not believe the Bulls lose a game 7 (even in Phoenix). </p>

<p>The Jazz were right there with them.  To me, those were the closest sets of series.  However, when it got to crunch time, the Bulls had Jordan (whereas the Jazz relied on an extremely clutch John Stockton) and that was the difference.  
Again, there was a sense of inevitability at the end of every game.</p>

      <label for="le8ptp3" class="commentText"><p>So many have never seen MJ play. But watching him win 6 out of 10 years in the 90’s was just a continuation from what we saw when Magic/Bird won 8 out 10 in the 1980’s.</p>

<p>We also saw MJ fail (yes MJ didn’t win every game) to get his teams past the Celtics and Pistons in the Eastern Conference for years, so it was good to see him get over the hump. Plus, MJ was a real crossover superstar and even people’s mothers and grandparents wanted him to win.</p>

<p>Closest comp, feeling-wise, was Brady. But, big difference, it seemed like unless they were a die hard for another team, <em>every</em>-effing-body rooted for the Bulls, whereas it seemed like only Pats (or Bucs, at the end)  fans really rooted for Brady.</p>

<p>As a huge NBA fan of the 90s who rooted for a Bulls rival (in Pacers&rsquo; fans&rsquo; minds, at least), most of the 90s were insufferable.</p>

<p>Jordan was compelling because he was an unbeatable monster waiting for you. There was no confidence going into the finals against Jordan. You were a gladiator, brought there to be slaughtered.</p>

<p>Lebron was just always there. He&rsquo;s incredible, but beatable. (He is astounding. He just doesn&rsquo;t have the same otherworldly presence or ability to flat out choose to dominate. )</p>

<p>If MJ was doing this now I bet the discourse would be a lot different, which is kind of a shame, because it feels like these days all the hate gets more traction than the appreciation we should have for superstar players.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not restricted to MJ, of course.  Every superstar in every sport a) gets a whistle that&rsquo;s a little more generous than other players&rsquo;, but b) gets a ton of hate for it, probably disproporionate to how soft that whistle is</p>

Watching the Bulls just was an event bc every night Jordan played…it was Jordan. A bunch of us on our floor would crowd into a room and watch it on a tiny crap CRT tv and ditch any studying we have. I couldn’t even be mad at the Bulls and Jordan. The shit he did night in and night out was ridiculous and that team was just dominant. It was a phenomenon and could not be replicated. Maybe the closest thing in recent history are the GSW warriors in terms of team domination, but no one comes close to Jordan.</p>

      <label for="le8nc3n" class="commentText"><p>As a Knicks fan, I hated the team because you knew they were always gonna win no matter how much I hoped they’d be upset. At the same time, I couldn’t hate Jordan…he was so f’n good, but he wasn’t a cocky ass about it. Confident and a trash talker, sure. He wasn’t a sore winner or front runner. He was like a force of nature…you can hate the damage done in its path, but how can you be hate a tornado?</p>

      <label for="le8s2h2" class="commentText"><p>Hated Jordan and his team for beating my Knicks all the time but I respected him. It’s not even the same feeling with LeBron at all. I think many people hated LeBron once he formed a superteam before he even won. If anything LeBron winning helped people like him more. Closest thing I felt to hating those 90s Bulls were those early 00s Lakers. I didn’t hate the 80s Lakers cause I hated those Celtics at the time.</p>

But the flip side was that, even when we were irrelevant, it gave me a team to root for in the playoffs (whoever was playing the Bulls). The two years he was away kind of sucked. Mostly though, I wanted there to be at least some sort of rival because the 80s were more fun with Magic and Bird.</p>

That’s how it felt, anyway. I appreciated and respected them though, their elite quality was hard to deny. And Jordan was a force of nature, like trying to battle the ocean, it seemed inevitable that somehow he’d find a way to win regardless of circumstances. His flu game was the iconic moment for me.</p>

      <label for="le9sjx1" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;am a Jordan fan and how could you not be but my team in the 90&rsquo;s was the Utah jazz. Twice defeated by Jordan and the bulls and still do not have a championship to this day. Stockton and Malone would definitely have a ring or 2 ( and both deserve to have one) if not for Jordan. So to answer your question, Yes, 100 % got sick of Jordan and the bulls 6 ring run and constant winning. I do however believe Jordan to still be the goat. It was a different era and I don&rsquo;t think LeBron would have been on any team capable of beating Jordan and the bulls during that time period and his stats would be drastically different had he played then vs now. I do respect what James has accomplished and have made respect for him going back to Cleveland during his prime to get them the championship they desperately needed and wanted. That was a class act by a classy athlete.</p>

It never felt like those bulls teams got any unfair advantages through the refs or other factors, they just straight up beat people.  With that said, a lot of those finals were pretty close so it wasn’t like the bulls were steamrolling teams on their way to championships.  Jordan was just a baller and came through in the biggest games (even if he might have pushed off of Byron Russell on that one play…).</p>

<p>Watching those Finals games against the Jazz were core memories, it was incredible seeing what he was able to do.</p>

<p>But I was never a fan because of the chokehold he had on the East.</p>

<p>…then I got stuck with 20+ years of Tom Brady in the AFC East soon after Jordan finally retired again/Wizards.</p>

Rodman, incredibly elite.  Phil Jackson is one of the goats.</p>

<p>the winning bothered me none as we enjoyed exactly one fluke run during that time and mostly misery outside of that. I was happy to enjoy the spectacle as a neutral. loved MJ and Pip but still rooted for dogs like Kemp/Glove to pull off the impossible &ndash;except for the Jazz, would never root for them under any circumstance, thank God.</p>

<p>I was a Warriors fan so I loved it. Because even our very best teams were never expected to do jack shit, so the idea of contending for a title never entered my mind for at least 20 years.</p>

<p>If my team was maybe closer to contention, I could see it being anyone. Kinda like how the 9ers would have two more titles right now if it weren&rsquo;t for Mahomes, who plays the position better than anyone I&rsquo;ve seen in my life</p>

      <label for="leaebm3" class="commentText"><p>As a Blazer fan, it was a whirlwind of delusion that we could beat him and that Clyde was the better two guard. The Oregonian Newspaper ran player comparisons before the finals and claimed our only weakness was Scottie. They had Jordan and Drexler as a wash.</p>

<p>Then we experienced denial during the shrug, and finally anger. No acceptance.</p>

      <label for="leafier" class="commentText"><p>I was only a kid but I did still watch a lot of basketball back then (because of space jam I became a huge fan) and I seem to remember that Jordan was universally loved and even the teams they beat it didn’t feel like there was animosity. But again I was a kid so maybe there was idk</p>
