      <p>I know a lot of fans got tired of Lebron constantly making it to the finals during the 2010 decades. Did you all feel the same way about Jordan constantly winning in the 90s? I know how popular Jordan was and still is but did anyone ever get tired of Jordan’s constant winning like how many got tired of Lebron’s constant winning?</p>

<p>They also respected how amazing he was. There wasn&rsquo;t debate about it.</p>

<p>There also was no social media, so there really weren&rsquo;t negative stories that came out. One or two times the gambling rumors were present but almost everything around Michael was positive.</p>

      <label for="le8im6a" class="commentText"><p>It was kind of fun because you rooted against him every year and he just kept winning (and in generally dominant fashion, it really was must-see tv, dude put on a show), the second 3peat even more so. Way more haters/doubters after the baseball thing and partial season loss to orlando.</p>

<p>The series against Reggie was extra fun from a neutral perspective, two ice cold assholes going at each other, clear david/goliath thing</p>

<p>His whole style was also just so methodical too, it was hard not to appreciate how easily he got to his spots and knocked down shots, like the defense was just a formality some times</p>

        <div>1 | 15 minutes ago </div>
      </div>
      <label for="le8j0yh" class="commentText"><p>As a Pistons fan, it went through multiple phases:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Early &lsquo;90s: Not a fan of the Bulls on account of the well-established rivalry with the Bad Boys. By &lsquo;93, the Pistons were less relevant but I was rooting for the Suns because I wanted someone different to win.</p></li>

<li><p>1995: Michael Jordan&rsquo;s return was exciting and he almost felt like an underdog so that was fun. Each &ldquo;vintage&rdquo; thing he did was thrilling—the game-winner against Atlanta, the double-nickel against New York, the switch back to jersey no. 23 against Orlando. That year was a real turning point, where I became more appreciative of Michael Jordan.</p></li>

<li><p>1996: Fun to watch them chase history. Became a novelty to watch them, a feeling very similar to what I felt watching the 2016 Warriors. Hearing about them losing a game felt like an event. I was at a trading card show when they lost a regular season game to the expansion Raptors (or maybe it was the morning after) and you could hear people murmuring about it everywhere.</p></li>

<li><p>1997 &amp; 1998: Some winners fatigue, for sure. I didn&rsquo;t hate them like younger me did during the Bad Boys era but I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded if a team came through and took them out. That being said, I was mesmorized by his final sequence and game-winning shot against Utah in 1998. It was a moment in time.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Not to pit the two against each other but since you brought it up, I saw the LeBron era differently. Whereas Jordan&rsquo;s teams always seemed to have the advantage as long as he wasn&rsquo;t returning from sabbaticals, LeBron&rsquo;s teams often felt like they had uphill battles, which made things feel a bit more riveting (except for the Miami years, my least favorite of the LeBron years). That&rsquo;s not intended as a commentary of who&rsquo;s better (since team construction plays such a big role) but rather it&rsquo;s just a take on my feelings watching both.</p>

      <label for="le8jj6h" class="commentText"><p>I’m a Heat fan, and I knew back then that we had slim to no chance of even sniffing the Finals.  That being said, it was a privilege to watch Jordan, Pippen, Kukoc and Rodman do their thing.  As a fan, I can confidently say that no other player has ever out the fear of God in me like Jordan did.  Every time he touched the ball, you felt like he was going to score.  I felt bad for some of the other greats at the time never winning a ring, but it was a helluva thing to witness.</p>

      <label for="le8k5v7" class="commentText"><p>Personally, I rooted against Jordan in every single series, especially against the Lakers and Jazz.</p>

<p>I was a huge Magic Johnson supporter and at the time there definitely was an active debate:  Magic or Jordan?</p>

<p>I’m old enough to have been influenced by Magic and Bird, so pass-first, no-look dishes were what I grew up on.  Who was the better player?  The one who made his team better, or the one who was individually better?</p>

<p>After game 1 of the Lakers series, the answer seemed clear: Magic’s ability to include his teammates made him better.  This was exemplified at the end of the game with Magic hitting Sam Perkins for the game winner.</p>

<p>What I didn’t see, however, was that Jordan no longer was a 1-man team.  He included his teammates enough that his individual prowess shined even brighter.  By game 4, it was clear that Jordan was far superior to Johnson.</p>

<p>From then on, and to answer your question, there was a feeling of inevitability to Jordan.  The Blazers were not in the ballpark; the Suns were, but I do not believe the Bulls lose a game 7 (even in Phoenix). </p>

<p>The Jazz were right there with them.  To me, those were the closest sets of series.  However, when it got to crunch time, the Bulls had Jordan (whereas the Jazz relied on an extremely clutch John Stockton) and that was the difference.  
Again, there was a sense of inevitability at the end of every game.</p>

To be honest it was a lot more enjoyable to witness that kind of dominance before hot take culture and social media gave a massive platform to the amount of toxicity we see these days.</p>

<p>If MJ was doing this now I bet the discourse would be a lot different, which is kind of a shame, because it feels like these days all the hate gets more traction than the appreciation we should have for superstar players.</p>
