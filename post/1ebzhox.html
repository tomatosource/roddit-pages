<p>SAS, whether you like him or hate him, is the hardest working guy in sports media. He&rsquo;s on screen damn near the entire day. ESPN makes him come back mid-vacation to comment on every Lebron tweet.</p>

<p>Chuck &ldquo;works&rdquo; 1 day a week, most of which he spends watching non-basketball shows on TV in the green room. He&rsquo;s not trying to have his golf game interrupted to discuss every trade rumor and 2nd round pick swap in the universe.</p>

      <label for="lexbsza" class="commentText"><p>The problem I have with Stephen a is that he’s so one note For example, after the USA South sedan game I knew he was going to start screaming about “South Sudan are you kidding me? They don’t even have an indoor
court in the entire country! I mean, what are we talking about here. And you’ve got Lebron James who’s 40! I mean, come on!”</p>

<p>And sure enough most of the conversation went exactly that way. It’s so predictable. It’s never someone played well. It’s always someone choked or played poorly or doesn’t care or doesn’t make the effort. It’s never really about strategy or anything in analytical. And I
get that it’s hot take TV but like I said, it’s getting pretty old.</p>

<p>Theres also been several other times he came off vacation to do work too, like when he did a special edition of the SAS show to talk about a mass shooting that had occurred in Baltimore. He works like many other professions in corporate America, they’re can be on vacation but they get pulled in when stuff goes down.</p>

      <label for="leye9zq" class="commentText"><p>To be fair, that was probably his decision as much as ESPN&rsquo;s. Narratives were popping off left and right about the reigning finals MVP going to the lakers to team up with LeBron or kickstarting the clippers. Even twitter randos were getting crazy engagement from pretending to have insider sources. And the Uncle Dennis saga. Stephen A would be out of his mind to sit out a hot-take fest like that. Say what you will about the guy, but he isn&rsquo;t the type to just sit on the sidelines when there&rsquo;s smoke just begging to be blown up peoples&rsquo; asses.</p>

He’s so busy doing TV that he spends no time watching the sporting events he is talking about. I forget who exactly he was referring to, but he once said the key to an NFL team winning a game was a player who had been out all year with a season ending injury. He’s really out of touch with what’s going on in sports, but gives a good soundbite when ranting.</p>

      <label for="leykfgk" class="commentText"><p>Probably has very little to do with the total amount and far more to do with what return ESPN expects from that contract.</p>

<p>FWIW, I think Barkley actually makes about half that at TNT. Aikman makes about $18 million/year, mostly just for his work calling games.</p>

<p>I think ESPN would be very smart go spend big on stuff like the TNT crew, have them <em>only</em> doing games, and give the day-to-day on-air duties to lower-paid talent instead of spending five-figure amounts on people like SAS and putting them on every show.</p>

<p>Based on reported contract numbers, you could pay for like 15 Mina Kimeses for one SAS. And that&rsquo;s when ESPN is at its best IMO. Get a small number of big-name, big-salary folks who aren&rsquo;t on air that much but feel special when they are, then surround them with a bunch of comparatively cheap on-air talent.</p>

The other can’t even throw a right jab without looking like a baby duck attempting to waddle for the first time and never shuts the fuck up and loudly makes his bullshit points while speaking over everyone. Shaq says some goofy shit and can be a hater but his personality is literally nothing like Stephen A. You being serious chief?</p>

<p>that probably stems from fox/cbs protecting the banger matchups and NBC getting their share leaves MNF in the dust with TNF </p>

<p>from there, would you rather risk taking a bears/panthers? or go for a mediocre browns/steelers </p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean Amazon can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t outbid Disney, but I think it&rsquo;ll be closer than simply comparing company size.</p>

      <label for="lex3vdh" class="commentText"><p>The hope with Amazon is that they’d negotiate to let Ernie stay with Turner for everything else. For example, Amazon let Herbstreit continue with ESPN for college football even though he’s on their NFL broadcasts. They also let Richard Sherman do Undisputed on FS1 while doing Thursday Night Football on Amazon. So maybe there’s some hope.</p>

<p>If ESPN got Inside, they&rsquo;d basically be turning over the keys for them to do whatever they do. I don&rsquo;t think the halftime coverage would even resemble what it is today. This would not be ESPN acquiring Inside, it would be Inside the NBA taking the show to ESPN.</p>

<p>Yes you will.

<p>The Chuckster could command $20 million-plus offers from the NBA’s new trio of rights partners: newcomer Prime; incumbent ABC/ESPN; and former broadcast partner NBC, which held the rights during the Michael Jordan golden era from 1990 to 2002. ESPN is already eying Barkley and the entire cast of Inside the NBA, say my sources. Ditto for Prime.</p>

<p>As Marine hinted, Barkley might not be the only one in line for a big payday. Any of the newest NBA rights partners could try to hire the entire cast—effectively recreating Inside the NBA on a different platform.Prime could build its NBA studio coverage around the Inside the NBA team. With a market capitalization of $2 trillion, and more than 200 million subscribers worldwide, Prime could afford the cast en masse. Meanwhile, ESPN has been lusting after Barkley for years, with its own NBA Countdown studio show struggling through a revolving door of cast changes. Don’t forget ESPN solved its Monday Night Football problem by raiding Fox Sports to hire away Troy Aikman and Joe Buck. As for NBC, who would be better than a ‘90s icon like Barkley to reboot the network’s “Roundball Rock” coverage of The Association?</p>

<p>Or it could be a two-step process. Barkley told Dan Patrick he could hire Shaquille O’Neal–Kenny Smith–Ernie Johnson through his own production company, then sell the show to the highest bidder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>​</p>

<p>So basically everybody wants them. Chuck will go to the highest bidder, probably the same for Shaq and Kenny. Ernie isn&rsquo;t leaving Turner, so really the only way they keep them all together is on Prime.</p>

      <label for="lewd7f5" class="commentText"><p>&ldquo;If you take the program from TNT, you likely lose many of the behind-the-scenes staffers in Atlanta who’ve helped make it a success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is a pretty critical factor, imo. The studio production team for Inside played a large role in the success of that program. Obviously the personalities are the most important roles, but the crew would need to come with them. Some of that crew had been working with them for years. Theres crew members that are part of some of the bits that define the character of the show.</p>

<p>Im not sure I have faith in the quality of the product being the same or better if its just the Inside cast with ESPN/Amazon production teams.</p>

<p>And the way ESPN is and works, these guys won’t have the freedom and space to be critical and talk the way they do. Bc ESPN literally controls what they say and everything so it just ruins the whole point.</p>

There was a lot of reporting that he is very loyal to Turner, gets to live in Atlanta year round and call Braves games.  Maybe ESPN can pry him away, but it would probably be a worse situation for him and he doesn&rsquo;t seem super motivated to chase the biggest pay check.</p>
