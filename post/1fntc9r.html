      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fntc9r/how_well_do_you_all_expect_kelly_oubre_and_caleb/"><p>How well do you all expect Kelly Oubre and Caleb Martin to hold the fort as the starting forwards for the Philadelphia 76ers?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>A question I&rsquo;ve been meaning the ask the community for a bit, I still do believe in terms of fit and just the blend of the roster+coaching, this is rivaling the Butler Sixers for the best team Embiid has had. That team had more top end talent on paper but this team is deeper and fits Embiid like a glove theoretically.</p>

<p>The Sixers signed Martin to a 4/<span class="math inline">\(35M deal in the offseason to be their starter at the 4. Oubre re-signed on a 2/\)</span>16M deal with a PO. I think Oubre was a fantastic locker room presence last year and he started out the season hot. He had a great start to his season last year and played a more focused brand of basketball, but his final numbers were essentially what they always are at the end of the season. He had a couple of hot games in April which pushed his shooting from 3 to 31%, he was almost sub-30% from 3 on the season. He got hit by a car and missed a month. He actually played OK after returning, but when Embiid got hurt and Maxey was banged up, he took on more load offensively. That&rsquo;s when his efficiency went down the tubes.</p>

<p>He was good in the playoffs which leads you to believe that he will elevate playing with Embiid but he&rsquo;s consistently been a low-30s 3 point shooter, he&rsquo;s still a pretty substandard rebounder and passer, and his all around defense is still only at best average, and didn&rsquo;t grade out too well last season.</p>

<p>Caleb Martin has some playmaking in him and can handle in transition, he will catch and rip and take it to the cup or pull up. He&rsquo;s a good finisher, knows how to move off ball. He&rsquo;s an active and athletic defender and a disruptor on that end. But he certainly isn&rsquo;t a lockdown three point shooter or pull up shooter and often goes through some bad cold spells. He had the 40%+ 3 point season a few seasons ago but has been mid-30s the last two seasons. He&rsquo;s a fine spot up shooter but not an elite one. Only OK.</p>

<p>Wanna know what you all think about these two as the Sixers forward duo and how well you think they hold it down for Philly around their Big 3.</p>

I know PG can do that in spurts but he&rsquo;s probably not taking that on full-time considering his age. Also, will PG be guarding the four more? None of Oubre/Martin/PG strike me as power forwards.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really interested to see how the Yabusele redemption arc goes as well.</p>

      <label for="lokuet3" class="commentText"><p>Oubre has all the tools for it with his wacky wingspan for his size, quickness, and occasionally will lock down someone. But there&rsquo;s just way too many lapses in focus, but especially off the ball. Overall defensive impact here was pretty minimal unfortunately, but there were times where you could see the talent.</p>

<p>to answer the other part of your question, none of them are really suited to defend more physical PFs, but I&rsquo;d rather have Oubre do that than have to chase around shooters off the ball where he&rsquo;s inevitably going to get lost or give up navigating a screen. Martin is scrappy and is going to be more persistent on D. PG is realistically the best defender of the three by a mile.</p>

Size is also a concern for those 2 with bigger SFs, but there’s not much Philly’s gonna be able to do about that.</p>

Caleb never really took off with us but he seemed to play really well with the Heat. Just like Cody, Caleb is going to play tough D and do all the unglamorous things a team needs to win.</p>

<p>Kelly is all about consistency. He can and has hit 7+ 3s in a game if he catches fire. He can also shoot 0/1000 and tank your entire offense.</p>

<p>So with Maxey and Embiid, you need pieces around them to win. They’re solid pieces. They’re not going to be THE reason a team wins a title but they are A reason if that makes sense.</p>

      <label for="lokyyxi" class="commentText"><p>The best part about oubre on the sixers lineup is he really knows his place. Nurse has done a good job at setting expectations for him and oubre&rsquo;s lapses in judgement on that end have been reduced. Defense is another story.</p>

      <label for="lol8atr" class="commentText"><p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;ll work well. One of the under-discussed issues with last year&rsquo;s team was how undersized it was. Melton and Maxey were a small backcourt and when Melton was hurt we often had Hield and/or Lowry out there. Combine that with Harris&rsquo;s lack of physicality we were often outsized and out fought.</p>

<p>Now we still don&rsquo;t have size at the 4, but Martin in the backcourt at least gives us 4 6&rsquo;5&rdquo;+ guys on the court at all times. Plus Yabuselle hopefully gives us good physical minutes too. I think the pieces fit well, but the game will speak for itself </p>

      <label for="lolkat1" class="commentText"><p>They’re in way over their heads. I think you can get away with starting one but not both. On a serious contender these guys are both ideally bench players.</p>

<p>The Sixers top 3 might be enough against weaker opponents, but the real problem is what happens when Embiid and George inevitably miss games?  Sixers are legit going to have Caleb Martin as their #3 option. (Or even #2)</p>

<p>Just a bad mix of injury risk at the top and poor rotation quality.</p>

<p>IMO this team is going to do much worse than many seem to think.</p>

      <label for="lol6sft" class="commentText"><p>Yabusele will be starter, caleb martin and oubre will compete for other starting spot. Caleb is 6&rsquo;5 and is not nearly strong and athletic enough to play 4 like barkley, zion or any good undersized pf. I dont know who had this idea, caleb is a sf/sg definetely not a 4</p>

      <label for="lokwo96" class="commentText"><p>I mean, if you want me to be really honest I think this team is cooked. There’s no guarantee Embiid can be healthy for a full season plus playoffs, same for Paul George. Both these guys are over 30 with heinous injury histories. The Sixers roleplayers are still mediocre, Oubre was food against the Knicks and Caleb Martin isn’t really an upgrade. Martin and Oubre are streaky shooters at best, Martin is an active defender but doesn’t really have the size to guard 4’s like Julius Randle, Giannis, even Tatum really.</p>
