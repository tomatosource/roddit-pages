<p>Immanuel Quickly just got $175M so maybe don’t act like there’s some huge moral hazard associated with how the NBAPA negotiated. The money is way too good for anyone to get bogged down in the details. The players got good things. They didn’t get steamrolled. They just literally didn’t get everything and now the media is mad that there’s gonna be fewer trades and that means their constant “sources say” rumors are gonna be less believable.</p>

      <label for="laqixuu" class="commentText"><p>The details are very important when it comes to NBA contracts. There’s so many restrictions on them. The cap is rising and max contracts are the same as the last CBA. The appreciation in cap is largely because of the tv deals and new tv deals about to set place. Saying that players are getting money is the simplest way to look at the CBA. The BRI split was always going to be the same. They always negotiate in the small details. But those small details mean hundreds of millions of dollars in this case. </p>

<p>The NBA recently completed its financial audit of the 2022-23 season and found that business has bounced back strongly from its COVID-19 shortfalls. For players, it means the return of nearly the entire escrow fund withheld during the season—an amount totaling nearly $700 million.</p>

<p>and based on the snippet above, it seems that the escrow (albeit unpredictable) has been returned in full, despite record-setting luxury tax payments</p>

<p>the 2nd apron lowers what owners can elect to spend on player salaries. but if it wasnt there, some owners could spend more, and some players could receive more -&amp;gt; leading to an increase in total player salary</p>

<p>i just think total player salary up ⬆️ is more tangible than teams being effectively limited to spending up to $18m above the luxury tax line, and doling out salaries from that restriction — but im ignorant on how it plays out practically</p>

      <label for="laqntyo" class="commentText"><p>Total player salary can&rsquo;t go up, its capped at 50% of revenue. The reason why it hasn&rsquo;t affected escrow is because if total salary is above 50% of revenue by a small percentage then it&rsquo;s deducted from next year&rsquo;s salary cap first. But it&rsquo;s conceivable without the apron then it could hit escrow.</p>

      <label for="laqqck4" class="commentText"><p>but couldnt owners inject into revenue. like 1 or 2 owners luxuriously spending meant the remaining owners got a luxury tax check at the end of the season. those 1, 2 owners hypothetically could even operate at a loss while the other owners profited, couldnt they?</p>

<p>in my head, total salary being capped at 50% doesnt necessarily mean it couldn&rsquo;t go up with unbalanced ownership spending. the owners (some overspending, most not) would balance the 50% among themselves, and the players get their higher salary.</p>

A lot of teams won’t have any sort of mid level exemption anymore, so that leaves pretty much minimums to hand out, and teams are forced to spend big money to keep their stars, so what’s going to happen is the best players are gonna get max contracts and then everyone else is gonna make the minimum.

<p>the union values over everything else.</p>

<p>This reporter acting like the union gives a shit how many trades there are is ridiculous.</p>

<p>Reporters care how many trades there are, it&rsquo;s what gets them clicks and money. The players don&rsquo;t get more money for being in more trade rumors.</p>

      <label for="laqgrez" class="commentText"><p>seems it was $80m for the entirety of players in the league. considering what player salaries are in total, that feels not too grand in the scheme of things</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Historically, the NBA’s licensing revenue was excluded from basketball-related income with the money generated exclusively going to the owners. The players bargained to have that figure included, <span class="math inline">\(160M for the 2023/2024 season, for which the players will be entitled to \)</span>80M.  That money will attribute to higher salaries for players.</p>

<p>The physical qualities to be a great basketball player are only found in .000000000000001 percent of people.</p>

<p>For example Wemby is literally 1 of a billion and he will likely dominate the league primarily because of his physical gifts you can’t salary cap another wemby. Plus a player like Wemby can play 90% of possessions on offense and defense so their individual talent can dominate every facet of the game.</p>

<p>You either have the most talented player or not most the time.</p>

      <label for="laqsxmr" class="commentText"><p>The nature of the sport is almost antithetical to parity. The upside is that the current conditions of the sport, large talent pool, cap structure, and max contract structure give the smaller markets a better chance to compete than they’ve had in decades. If you draft smart and make some good roster moves, your super star is usually incentivized to stick around for the first max contract. That’s usually 7 years give or take. The hard cap is making it harder to superteam a way to a title anymore, too.</p>

Even apron teams benefit from the easier salary-matching rules, they just have additional restrictions that prevent actually accumulating salary.</p>

<p>The new CBA has the same intent as the old one: an &lsquo;elastic&rsquo; cap allow teams to go over the tax threshold for a few seasons at a time, but then get pulled back down (by the repeater rate penalties). That didn&rsquo;t work. The new one just uses trade restrictions as a more powerful elastic.</p>

      <label for="laqfj4v" class="commentText"><p>This is fundamentally not true. Bird rights and supermaxes were introduced to preference teams drafting and retaining talent. The new rules make absolutely zero distinction between the cost for team to retain talent they drafted and paid vs. those they traded for or signed in free agency.</p>

<p>As a Celtics fan, you should probably be aware that the cost of keeping your team together essentially got $100m more expensive under the new CBA than it would have been under the prior agreement, and that with the understanding that the Celtics will have to let the salary slots for Porzingis and Horford expire without replacement. During this time you will not be able to trade future 1st round picks, make any trades that don&rsquo;t involve you essentially dumping money, sign any free agent making more than a vet minimum, and retaining your rotation talent that you draft will cost you 6-9x the dollar amount.</p>

      <label for="laqn96a" class="commentText"><p>Maybe the league, uh, DOESNT want trades as much, and maybe players don&rsquo;t as well. Maybe players are tired of being constantly in trade rumors, referred to as &ldquo;a Duncan Robinson&rdquo;, as if they&rsquo;re not actually people but generic representations of some abstract versions of themselves, referred to as &ldquo;assets&rdquo;, and getting sent halfway across the country on a moment&rsquo;s notice. Maybe the league has recognized that trade rumors are great for Twitter but bad for the product, that fans want to see their team as a cohesive unit rather than just the random jerseys this year&rsquo;s crop of players pulled out of the bin.</p>

<p>Look, I love trades as much as the next guy, and I&rsquo;m certainly not shedding a year for multi-millionaire having to move. But Bontemps is projecting his own interests into the league. HE&rsquo;S the one who wants more trades because it makes him relevant</p>
