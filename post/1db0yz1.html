<p>Luka, Embiid, Jokic, Giannis etc all receive the majority of attention in their post season series. Jokic gets a roamer in the paint and the person guarding him. Embiid gets doubled most possessions etc.</p>

<p>Doesn’t mean they get excused because it opens up other guys.</p>

      <label for="l7nzzpi" class="commentText"><p>and hes not as good as those 4 offensively ? Nobody makes that argument.</p>

<p>Tatum’s strength is that hes a 7-<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> in every aspect of basketball. He’s not a <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> in any single aspect like Luka or Jokic are but hes also not a <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> like Giannis’ or Embiid physically.</p>

<p>Part of the reason Celtics have had as much success is because of how adaptable he is and how easy he is to build around. These “stacked” players that he has on his team :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kristaps : Literally played with Luka didnt look nearly as good</p>

<p>Al Horford : Played with Embiid and was deemed ready to retire</p>

<p>Jrue Holiday : Played with Giannis and traded away for being deemed not good enough and needing an upgrade</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What Tatum allows is for these guys to play their game without having to tailor themselves to play alongside a Luka or Embiid etc. This current iteration of the Celtics is his 4th iteration thats made a deep playoff run and it certainly wont be the last.</p>

      <label for="l7o0qol" class="commentText"><p>This is very disingenuous tho lol.</p>

<p>Holiday and Horford were asked to do way more because they were on less stacked teams. Horford was on a max wasn’t he, not a role player like now, and Holiday was the 3rd option on the Bucks and often forced into the 2nd option with Middleton injuries.</p>

<p>Porzingis did work with Luka, they were great in the bubble and he played the best ball of his career lol. They were the best offense in basketball in that shortened season. But KPs health and also limited role in the offense didn’t work for him, but he’s taken a limited role on offense for the Celtics because he’s matured since then.</p>

<p>A forward is easier to build around than a center but those aren’t good examples.</p>

<p>Grant Williams was one of those players who excelled on the Cs to get a big contract and has been a shell of himself since. Just go look at how different the team around Tatum and Brown have changed through all their deep playoff runs.</p>

      <label for="l7o2z08" class="commentText"><p>I agree with every take you said except for how you used quotes on stacked. The Celtics are stacked in every sense of the word.</p>

<p>KP has always been a quality player, I don&rsquo;t even get why you mentioned that he &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t look nearly as good&rdquo; with Luka as if that changes how good he is.</p>

<p>Horford was obviously still really good since his skillset is just one that ages well. His numbers just took a hit because he was playing with Embiid and the Thunder tanked when Shai got injured during Al&rsquo;s stay there.</p>

<p>And Jrue was traded for <em>Lillard</em>. Anyone is making the trade for a superstar like Dame lol he wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;thrown away&rdquo;. And the Bucks have been very unstable ever since too, so Jrue&rsquo;s impact on that team really can&rsquo;t be understated.</p>

      <label for="l7nz7y9" class="commentText"><p>JB has been amazing the playoffs. That being said Tatum is always the best player on the court for the Celtics. He opens up their offense and anchors their defense, which is why he has the best +/- in the entire nba for the playoffs and since he’s set foot in the league.</p>

<p>Should JB be recognized for playing really well? Absolutely. But Tatum is the engine that drives this team not JB.</p>

      <label for="l7o2y1q" class="commentText"><p>You’re missing the point. Porzingis was great (though he only played 21 minutes). Derrick white was great against the heat. JB and Jrue have been great all playoffs. But they’re all benefitting massively from JT drawing so much attention and willingly spreading the ball around to the open man.</p>

<p>There’s a reason d white, porzingis, jrue, al etc all have posted their best years 3 pt shooting on the Celtics with JT. His ability to draw defenses is getting these guys wide open looks and preventing defenses from helping on them.</p>

<p>Tatum has capitalized on playmaking against tougher coverages, elevated the spot-up opportunities of the entire team and has been our most valuable defender this playoffs with his switchability and rebounding.</p>

<p>No doubt Brown’s playoff translation has been far better this year, but JB playing at a playoff-rising level is still only arguable against Tatum at most.</p>

<p>But to answer your question, I don’t think Tatum’s performance will really change his perception that much either way. He feels pretty entrenched in the 5-7 spot.</p>

      <label for="l7o2x7b" class="commentText"><p>Tatums play in game 1 is exactly why he is no doubt in the 4-7 range. He was really struggling to get his own shot off due to all the pressure, but still had a huge impact. He was awesome on defense, and was very good at creating opportunities. Not many players can have such a big impact while struggling to score.  The flip side is a top 4 player finds a way to score no matter what, and he can’t consistently do that when the defense focuses so heavily on him. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>First and foremost, JB is one hell of a player. So is Tatum. Both of these can be true at the same time. Being outplayed by JB is not a slight by any means, especially if Tatum is doing what he is supposed to and not just flailing under pressure, which brings up point #2.</p></li>

<li><p>Tatum drew a ton of defensive attention in game 1, which lead to a lot of open space and playmaking possibilities for the Celtics. And he did a pretty good job of recognizing that and passing the ball once the defense collapsed on him. And that&rsquo;s part of being a true superstar - his presence on the floor has a gravity of it&rsquo;s own that can create great scoring opportunities for everyone else, if said superstar is aware and selfless enough to take advantage of his open teammates. And, at least in game 1, Tatum did that. I think he passed the ball out of 70ish% of his drives to the basket in game 1 instead of challenging several Mavs contesting him at once. Dude played great basketball, even if it wasn&rsquo;t a great scoring performance.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Tatum is meeting my definition of a great ballplayer. The whole team is, really. Even when he isn&rsquo;t the center of scoring, Tatum facilitates the open looks and ball movement for the whole team to be well-balanced.</p>
