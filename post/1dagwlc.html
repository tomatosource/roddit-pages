<p>Seeing a lot of people say that Dallas just missed a bunch of great looks. I really don&rsquo;t know if we watched the same game?  12 spot ups is crazy low, Celtics were everywhere in help defense and refused to allow open shots. Dallas threes were mostly tough, unassisted, and mostly above the break, and Celtics ran them off the line and forced role players to hit floaters. Celtics allowed zero lobs and only 3 corner threes the entire game. As amazing as Luka is, if the Mavs can&rsquo;t get a much more efficient shot diet for the rest of the series I don&rsquo;t think they have much of a chance.</p>

      <label for="l7k7p4i" class="commentText"><p>I saw a lot of people say Dallas was just missing but Boston just wasn&rsquo;t giving them many open looks. Sure PJ got a few, and Kyrie might hit a couple more, but they were all above the break looks.</p>

<p>Dallas only attempted three corner 3s last night. One of them was a Kyrie heavily contested shot that hit the side of the backboard. Another one was a long offensive rebound that rolled to an open Luka.</p>

<p>They just completely dictated what type of shots Dallas was going to get, all while dictating the type of shots they wanted to get to on the other side of the court.</p>

<p>Their wings will punish you if you concede corner threes, but when it comes to above the break you give them that shot all day. They&rsquo;re gonna have to figure out a way to force us to change our defensive scheme and take us out of our comfort zone but I&rsquo;m doubting if they have the personnel to actually do that. Maybe we&rsquo;ll see some more Jaden Hardy?</p>

DJJ/PJ/Green/Maxi percentages from 3 pt are way higher in the corner, and they are useless from 3 if they shoot anywhere else. Celtics also got rid of our lobs. We made it this far cause of Luka/Kyrie making shots everywhere, easy lobs, corner 3s from role players, and defense. Celtics took away nearly everything.</p>

      <label for="l7kpq8r" class="commentText"><p>There are a few things that would make me a bit optimistic for the Mavs, and it&rsquo;s not the shooting numbers (which weren&rsquo;t even that good by Boston)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Luka didn&rsquo;t play very well, particularly in the first half. It didn&rsquo;t even really feel like it was because of the defense so much as he was getting his sea legs with the amount of dudes they throw at him. But it seemed like he can beat every one of them, pretty easily. He&rsquo;ll destroy boston if they leave him 1 on 1 all series. I just don&rsquo;t know if he can destroy them enough to win 4 our of 6.</p></li>

<li><p>I don&rsquo;t know what the Mavs were doing defensively in the first half. They looked confused that Boston could shoot 1-5, which made no sense. That&rsquo;ll change, but more importantly, they got roasted for Offensive rebounds in the first half which lead to a lot of those open Boston threes. They missed a ton of box outs, and if they clean that up, it&rsquo;s not a 30 point lead, but a 20 point lead.</p></li>

<li><p>Lively didn&rsquo;t know what he was doing, and got 5 fouls in like 15 minutes. If he calms down and stops trying to body Tatum and Zingus 25 feet from the rim, he&rsquo;s going to return his elite plus minus numbers back to the Mavs. He&rsquo;s very switchable and should be looking to contest threes and prevent the drive. The opposite of what he did yesterday.</p></li>

<li><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t count on Kyrie, Lively and PJ having bad games at the same time again the rest of this series.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That being said, there&rsquo;s very few teams in league history that can match their level of depth of two way players, and when they&rsquo;re all locked in they&rsquo;re nearly impossible to beat. And maybe now that it&rsquo;s the finals, they&rsquo;re going to finally do lock in, because we sure as hell didn&rsquo;t see it in any of the eastern playoff series.</p>

      <label for="l7ku4gf" class="commentText"><p>Some very good points!</p>

<p>Regarding Luka, I think the Celtics’ gameplan is to accept that he is going to be a force offensively and to try not to let the other guys beat them. He’s going to be an incredible scorer no matter what you do. Luka has always had some issues with conditioning, and I’m not sure if he’s 100% right now either. The Celtics were attacking him defensively and forcing him to work. It’s a lot to ask from any player to carry that load, and Luka might just tire out at some point in every game</p>

<p>I agree about the Mavs’ other players. Lively is a great player who was probably just a bit too intense in his first finals game at such a young age. PJ Washington and Derrick Jones were probably playing unsustainably well at certain points in the playoffs, but you’d expect them to play better than they did last night. Kyrie is a really odd case. He’s had games during these playoffs where he’s looked incredible and others where he seems to disappear. I think a huge part of the Mavs’ championship hopes hinge on Kyrie. He needs to consistently play at the level we know he can offensively</p>

<p>They seemingly crumbled after Porzingis just outright nuked them in the first half.
Then when they sat Luka, Hardy and Green didnt know what to do. Celtics perimeter defense is gonna be hard to beat with very little movement and spacing, things Indiana was great at</p>

      <label for="l7kw6fw" class="commentText"><p>To your first point I think Luka was thrown off because the Celtics DIDN’T throw guys at him. Celtics were perfectly okay with Luka taking step backs again single coverage, they wanted to take away the easy buckets he gets for teammates.</p>

<p>Seems like the Celtics want Luka to try and score individually against the Celtics elite defenders for 40 minutes while working him non stop on defense. Either he’ll become inefficient on offense or traffic cone on defense.</p>

<p>You could say that the Celts are different from the opponents they faced so far and that the Celts were the best team in the league all season, which I would agree with, but it&rsquo;s not fair to say the Mavs have no business being in the Finals.</p>

      <label for="l7kjk5p" class="commentText"><p>I think it’s more he’d be more valuable if Minnesota had the perimeter defense we do. They’ve got a lot of size to clog up the paint, but against a guard heavy offense that can quickly become a disadvantage when they stretch you out.</p>

<p>Boston has several perimeter guys who can do as well against Luka and Kyrie as anyone, and Tatum or Brown can handle their bigs to nullify pick and rolls if we’re worried about lobs. That sets us up to be much more strategic with how we ask KP to help, vs Minnesota who is really reliant on Gobert impacting the opposing offense any time they try to create penetration.</p>

      <label for="l7ku3m6" class="commentText"><p>The issue with the Timberwolves in defending Dallas is that they have two players that are vulnerable guarding in space in their best lineups in KAT and Gobert. Against the Nuggets having KAT to body Jokic and Gobert to roam off Gordon it was great since Jokic operates out of the post. Their best wing defenders also are pretty weak so Luka could work them a lot easier with his strength. I mean he still does it to Jrue fucking Holiday but it&rsquo;s still tougher than McDaniels and NAW because they&rsquo;re so skinny lol.</p>

<p>Against the heavy pick and roll of the Mavs their personnel was turned against them.</p>

<p>The style makes the fight. We saw that on both sides of the ball last night. We&rsquo;re a worse matchup for them than the Wolves.</p>

      <label for="l7ksaew" class="commentText"><p>I think that unless the Celtics are just suddenly less able to guard/cover guys for some reason, the Mavs best shot is to use more perimeter ball movement at get PJ Washington, Derrick Jones, and maybe even Hardaway involved in initiating the attack. If they can get defenders off balance and moving the wrong way they have a better chance. Luka wants to use his own gravity to pull everyone else open, but I don&rsquo;t see him having enough gravity in this series for that to work.</p>

      <label for="l7kx2bp" class="commentText"><p>The Celtics basically decided to let Luka go 1 on 1 even if he had a mismatch and could walk to the rim (which he did multiple times) instead of letting him get the defense into rotation. It worked especially well once they built up that huge lead off of Porzingod but I think if the game was closer throughout they would have to switch it up more.</p>
