<p>Seeing a lot of people say that Dallas just missed a bunch of great looks. I really don&rsquo;t know if we watched the same game?  12 spot ups is crazy low, Celtics were everywhere in help defense and refused to allow open shots. Dallas threes were mostly tough, unassisted, and mostly above the break, and Celtics ran them off the line and forced role players to hit floaters. Celtics allowed zero lobs and only 3 corner threes the entire game. As amazing as Luka is, if the Mavs can&rsquo;t get a much more efficient shot diet for the rest of the series I don&rsquo;t think they have much of a chance.</p>

      <label for="l7k7p4i" class="commentText"><p>I saw a lot of people say Dallas was just missing but Boston just wasn&rsquo;t giving them many open looks. Sure PJ got a few, and Kyrie might hit a couple more, but they were all above the break looks.</p>

<p>Dallas only attempted three corner 3s last night. One of them was a Kyrie heavily contested shot that hit the side of the backboard. Another one was a long offensive rebound that rolled to an open Luka.</p>

<p>They just completely dictated what type of shots Dallas was going to get, all while dictating the type of shots they wanted to get to on the other side of the court.</p>

<p>Their wings will punish you if you concede corner threes, but when it comes to above the break you give them that shot all day. They&rsquo;re gonna have to figure out a way to force us to change our defensive scheme and take us out of our comfort zone but I&rsquo;m doubting if they have the personnel to actually do that. Maybe we&rsquo;ll see some more Jaden Hardy?</p>

      <label for="l7l4db8" class="commentText"><p>The reality is much more simpler.</p>

<p>Luka has to make shots and force them away from their game plan.</p>

<p>I can see why Celtics fans would think this is unlikely, but look at how the game changed because KP came in hot.</p>

<p>Luka was looking to distribute, I felt, more than normal in the beginning of the game. I think he thought he wanted to ease his team into the Finals but it didn’t really work. He’s usually more aggressive in finding his shot.</p>

<p>If Boston decides they want to not give up lobs and Luka makes 5 straight floaters because that’s what they are giving him, I’m not sure the coaches will like him going 5 of 5.</p>

<p>The theory of Luka getting hot only holds until he gets hot. I’d expect for Luka to be super aggressive, not necessarily looking to draw fouls or trying to find the open shooter. Quite honestly, he draws more fouls by being aggressive and looking for his own shot than when he’s trying to just bait fouls.</p>

<p>Also, I’ll be honest. If I’m a Celtics fan I’d feel super confident that Dallas can’t beat us, but shooting variance games happen. Dallas was slow attacking the ball on rebound opportunities and couldn’t win any <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> balls.</p>

<p>Dallas has to win on the margins and didn’t play like that. Also they can’t get pulled into a 3 point shootout and Kyrie has to be better than <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>19</sub> from the field and 0/5 from 3.</p>

      <label for="l7l86gp" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I’ve heard some similar phrasing about him.</p>

<p>Your team is very very good and I think the series you guys have had hasn’t had to contain a player of Lukas caliber who literally can become the best player on the floor for the entire game.</p>

<p>For me, the question is when does Luka go off and how does it look? What does Joe do when Luka has 27 in the first half on <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> from 3? Will you be so stubborn then, especially if your 3s aren’t falling?</p>

<p>I’m sure he’s willing to lose a game without making changes but if Luka figures you out, you got to do something.</p>

      <label for="l7l9tk6" class="commentText"><p>Here’s the thing: he’s not going to overreact to <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> from three. That’s simply not sustainable. If the Mavs need Luka to hit 60%+ on a high volume of  threes to win games, the series is over. Now, what if Luka is putting himself into lightly contested layup territory, or short range barely contested floater territory on each possession? That will force the Celtics to change.</p>

<p>Michael Jordan was the best player on the floor vs the 86 Celtics for the whole series…as he got swept.</p>

      <label for="l7lb5tt" class="commentText"><p>I agree and that’s how I think Boston gets their biggest advantage - by forcing you to overreact from their unsustainable shot making.</p>

<p>Celtics hit like 7 or 8 3s in the 1st but only finished with 16 for the game. It’s not sustainable to hit 28 3s in a game, but you panic because you’re down nearly 20. You move away from your principles and try to match shot for shot which itself is a fools errand because 3 point shooting is incredibly variable and subject to runs.</p>

<p>But Luka is special and he can still feed energy to the team. If he’s making everything (like game 5 of the WCF, or game 7 in 22) then it does give the team an extra boost in shot making.</p>

<p>I think a player of his caliber is going to figure out a winning strategy and if Joe won’t adjust, then this series may not go the way you want. Obviously I’m hoping that’s the case.</p>

      <label for="l7lez42" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re a joker. Luka Doncic is no MJ, he is no Magic or Bird, nor is he on the same level as Wilt, Tim Duncan, Lebron, Curry, Abdul-Jabbar; hell I&rsquo;d say Karl Malone and Drexler even outclass him. He&rsquo;s an above-average baller having a monster year. I don&rsquo;t get why you Mavs fans are so in love with him. He bitches a lot on the court and even though he is the best player in these Finals, he ain&rsquo;t no hero. Just a basketball player who is clearly outmatched by a much stronger squad. Maybe the mental gymnastics make you feel better, but you&rsquo;re divorced from reality.</p>

This was slightly below average for the Celtics. If Luka is going to shoot 60%+ on a high volume of threes for four of the next six games, that’s life. Salute to him if he wins this alone.</p>

      <label for="l7lh5lj" class="commentText"><p>They both shot about the same as y’all, y’all just took a couple more 3’s. We also got dominated by Zubac. We looked like a play-in team against both of them game 1. We actually shot even worse against y’all than we did game 1 against the Clippers when we had one of the worst first half performances I’ve ever seen offensively.</p>

<p>You’re also looking at the total game stats, that first quarter I don’t think y’all missed ANYTHING. If you think it’s normal that KP goes nuclear like that isn’t an outlier, then I don’t know what to tell you. He literally averages 12ppg in the playoffs lol.</p>

We made it this far cause of Luka/Kyrie making shots everywhere, easy lobs, corner 3s from role players, and defense. Celtics took away nearly everything.</p>

      <label for="l7kib8z" class="commentText"><p>I’m very interested to see how game 2 goes. Dallas were outplayed game 1 against OKC and the Clippers but were able to rebound from those losses. And the Celtics have dropped a couple game 2s after comfortable game 1 victories. I think we’ll get a good indication of what kind of adjustments Dallas will make and whether or not they’ll be effective enough</p>

      <label for="l7kpq8r" class="commentText"><p>There are a few things that would make me a bit optimistic for the Mavs, and it&rsquo;s not the shooting numbers (which weren&rsquo;t even that good by Boston)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Luka didn&rsquo;t play very well, particularly in the first half. It didn&rsquo;t even really feel like it was because of the defense so much as he was getting his sea legs with the amount of dudes they throw at him. But it seemed like he can beat every one of them, pretty easily. He&rsquo;ll destroy boston if they leave him 1 on 1 all series. I just don&rsquo;t know if he can destroy them enough to win 4 our of 6.</p></li>

<li><p>I don&rsquo;t know what the Mavs were doing defensively in the first half. They looked confused that Boston could shoot 1-5, which made no sense. That&rsquo;ll change, but more importantly, they got roasted for Offensive rebounds in the first half which lead to a lot of those open Boston threes. They missed a ton of box outs, and if they clean that up, it&rsquo;s not a 30 point lead, but a 20 point lead.</p></li>

<li><p>Lively didn&rsquo;t know what he was doing, and got 5 fouls in like 15 minutes. If he calms down and stops trying to body Tatum and Zingus 25 feet from the rim, he&rsquo;s going to return his elite plus minus numbers back to the Mavs. He&rsquo;s very switchable and should be looking to contest threes and prevent the drive. The opposite of what he did yesterday.</p></li>

<li><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t count on Kyrie, Lively and PJ having bad games at the same time again the rest of this series.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That being said, there&rsquo;s very few teams in league history that can match their level of depth of two way players, and when they&rsquo;re all locked in they&rsquo;re nearly impossible to beat. And maybe now that it&rsquo;s the finals, they&rsquo;re going to finally do lock in, because we sure as hell didn&rsquo;t see it in any of the eastern playoff series.</p>

      <label for="l7kw6fw" class="commentText"><p>To your first point I think Luka was thrown off because the Celtics DIDN’T throw guys at him. Celtics were perfectly okay with Luka taking step backs again single coverage, they wanted to take away the easy buckets he gets for teammates.</p>

<p>Seems like the Celtics want Luka to try and score individually against the Celtics elite defenders for 40 minutes while working him non stop on defense. Either he’ll become inefficient on offense or traffic cone on defense.</p>

      <label for="l7ku4gf" class="commentText"><p>Some very good points!</p>

<p>Regarding Luka, I think the Celtics’ gameplan is to accept that he is going to be a force offensively and to try not to let the other guys beat them. He’s going to be an incredible scorer no matter what you do. Luka has always had some issues with conditioning, and I’m not sure if he’s 100% right now either. The Celtics were attacking him defensively and forcing him to work. It’s a lot to ask from any player to carry that load, and Luka might just tire out at some point in every game</p>

<p>I agree about the Mavs’ other players. Lively is a great player who was probably just a bit too intense in his first finals game at such a young age. PJ Washington and Derrick Jones were probably playing unsustainably well at certain points in the playoffs, but you’d expect them to play better than they did last night. Kyrie is a really odd case. He’s had games during these playoffs where he’s looked incredible and others where he seems to disappear. I think a huge part of the Mavs’ championship hopes hinge on Kyrie. He needs to consistently play at the level we know he can offensively</p>

      <label for="l7kvjy8" class="commentText"><p>Mavs were doing a better job rebounding in the second half with PJ and Luka.</p>

<p>They seemingly crumbled after Porzingis just outright nuked them in the first half.
Then when they sat Luka, Hardy and Green didnt know what to do. Celtics perimeter defense is gonna be hard to beat with very little movement and spacing, things Indiana was great at</p>

Why do y’all keep bringing up those series like these teams are anywhere near the Mavs? I understand y’all blew us out, but so did the Clippers and Thunder game 1. Obviously teams relying on those players will need a miracle to beat y’all.</p>

<p>As for wolves, I think their offense just burnt out and they didn’t have anyone for Luka, was a bad matchup for the wolves just like the wolves were one for the Nuggets.</p>

      <label for="l7l2o9d" class="commentText"><p>I have some unfortunate news for you. This is how kyrie generally plays against the celtics. He&rsquo;s going to give you 1 game where he drops 30+ on efficient shooting. The rest of the games, you are going to get ~17 points on inefficient shooting. He is also going to get killed on defense. So yes, kyrie will put up a dud from 3 again this series. He has had trouble scoring consistently against our length for like 3 or 4 years now</p>

      <label for="l7kjk5p" class="commentText"><p>I think it’s more he’d be more valuable if Minnesota had the perimeter defense we do. They’ve got a lot of size to clog up the paint, but against a guard heavy offense that can quickly become a disadvantage when they stretch you out.</p>

<p>Boston has several perimeter guys who can do as well against Luka and Kyrie as anyone, and Tatum or Brown can handle their bigs to nullify pick and rolls if we’re worried about lobs. That sets us up to be much more strategic with how we ask KP to help, vs Minnesota who is really reliant on Gobert impacting the opposing offense any time they try to create penetration.</p>

      <label for="l7ku3m6" class="commentText"><p>The issue with the Timberwolves in defending Dallas is that they have two players that are vulnerable guarding in space in their best lineups in KAT and Gobert. Against the Nuggets having KAT to body Jokic and Gobert to roam off Gordon it was great since Jokic operates out of the post. Their best wing defenders also are pretty weak so Luka could work them a lot easier with his strength. I mean he still does it to Jrue fucking Holiday but it&rsquo;s still tougher than McDaniels and NAW because they&rsquo;re so skinny lol.</p>

<p>Against the heavy pick and roll of the Mavs their personnel was turned against them.</p>

<p>The style makes the fight. We saw that on both sides of the ball last night. We&rsquo;re a worse matchup for them than the Wolves.</p>

It made luka score 30 with 1 assist and kyrie miss a ton on good defenders.. while the mavs defense was dont let tatum get anything, 3 guys were always focused on him and the entire team collapsed every time he went to the paint.. so tatum drove and kicked it out and they passed it around the perimeter with the mavs defense trying to recover repeatedly till they got the open shot (usually on the switch that luka was suppose to make and didnt.. his defense was AWFUL all game).</p>

<p>I swear, I said the same thing during the Clips/Mavs series and honestly at some point, you just gotta credit great defense when it’s due. Only 12 spot-ups is a crazy number. Looking forward to seeing how Dallas adjusts, bc Boston took away the bread-and-butter corner-3s and lobs that got Dallas this far.</p>

      <label for="l7ksaew" class="commentText"><p>I think that unless the Celtics are just suddenly less able to guard/cover guys for some reason, the Mavs best shot is to use more perimeter ball movement at get PJ Washington, Derrick Jones, and maybe even Hardaway involved in initiating the attack. If they can get defenders off balance and moving the wrong way they have a better chance. Luka wants to use his own gravity to pull everyone else open, but I don&rsquo;t see him having enough gravity in this series for that to work.</p>

      <label for="l7kx2bp" class="commentText"><p>The Celtics basically decided to let Luka go 1 on 1 even if he had a mismatch and could walk to the rim (which he did multiple times) instead of letting him get the defense into rotation. It worked especially well once they built up that huge lead off of Porzingod but I think if the game was closer throughout they would have to switch it up more.</p>

      <label for="l7la1kn" class="commentText"><p>Dallas had multiple issues last night. They couldn&rsquo;t buy a bucket to save their lives in crucial moments. They also weren&rsquo;t moving the ball like they normally have been in these playoffs so it always just felt like the wrong player was shooting the ball. Like it was basically always the first guy dribbling up the floor, which is an issue.</p>

      <label for="l7lcr5k" class="commentText"><p>Mavs role players straight up were not shooting, passing on decent shots all game long. That is the difference. On boston every player can shoot contested catch and shoot 3s. Most guys on dallas only do so when wide open. Most obvious examples being Maxi and DJJ.</p>
