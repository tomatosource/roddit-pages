<p>Seeing a lot of people say that Dallas just missed a bunch of great looks. I really don&rsquo;t know if we watched the same game?  12 spot ups is crazy low, Celtics were everywhere in help defense and refused to allow open shots. Dallas threes were mostly tough, unassisted, and mostly above the break, and Celtics ran them off the line and forced role players to hit floaters. Celtics allowed zero lobs and only 3 corner threes the entire game. As amazing as Luka is, if the Mavs can&rsquo;t get a much more efficient shot diet for the rest of the series I don&rsquo;t think they have much of a chance.</p>

      <label for="l7k7p4i" class="commentText"><p>I saw a lot of people say Dallas was just missing but Boston just wasn&rsquo;t giving them many open looks. Sure PJ got a few, and Kyrie might hit a couple more, but they were all above the break looks.</p>

<p>Dallas only attempted three corner 3s last night. One of them was a Kyrie heavily contested shot that hit the side of the backboard. Another one was a long offensive rebound that rolled to an open Luka.</p>

<p>They just completely dictated what type of shots Dallas was going to get, all while dictating the type of shots they wanted to get to on the other side of the court.</p>

<p>Their wings will punish you if you concede corner threes, but when it comes to above the break you give them that shot all day. They&rsquo;re gonna have to figure out a way to force us to change our defensive scheme and take us out of our comfort zone but I&rsquo;m doubting if they have the personnel to actually do that. Maybe we&rsquo;ll see some more Jaden Hardy?</p>

      <label for="l7l4db8" class="commentText"><p>The reality is much more simpler.</p>

<p>Luka has to make shots and force them away from their game plan.</p>

<p>I can see why Celtics fans would think this is unlikely, but look at how the game changed because KP came in hot.</p>

<p>Luka was looking to distribute, I felt, more than normal in the beginning of the game. I think he thought he wanted to ease his team into the Finals but it didn’t really work. He’s usually more aggressive in finding his shot.</p>

<p>If Boston decides they want to not give up lobs and Luka makes 5 straight floaters because that’s what they are giving him, I’m not sure the coaches will like him going 5 of 5.</p>

<p>The theory of Luka getting hot only holds until he gets hot. I’d expect for Luka to be super aggressive, not necessarily looking to draw fouls or trying to find the open shooter. Quite honestly, he draws more fouls by being aggressive and looking for his own shot than when he’s trying to just bait fouls.</p>

<p>Also, I’ll be honest. If I’m a Celtics fan I’d feel super confident that Dallas can’t beat us, but shooting variance games happen. Dallas was slow attacking the ball on rebound opportunities and couldn’t win any <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> balls.</p>

<p>Dallas has to win on the margins and didn’t play like that. Also they can’t get pulled into a 3 point shootout and Kyrie has to be better than <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>19</sub> from the field and 0/5 from 3.</p>

      <label for="l7l86gp" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I’ve heard some similar phrasing about him.</p>

<p>Your team is very very good and I think the series you guys have had hasn’t had to contain a player of Lukas caliber who literally can become the best player on the floor for the entire game.</p>

<p>For me, the question is when does Luka go off and how does it look? What does Joe do when Luka has 27 in the first half on <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> from 3? Will you be so stubborn then, especially if your 3s aren’t falling?</p>

<p>I’m sure he’s willing to lose a game without making changes but if Luka figures you out, you got to do something.</p>

      <label for="l7l9tk6" class="commentText"><p>Here’s the thing: he’s not going to overreact to <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> from three. That’s simply not sustainable. If the Mavs need Luka to hit 60%+ on a high volume of  threes to win games, the series is over. Now, what if Luka is putting himself into lightly contested layup territory, or short range barely contested floater territory on each possession? That will force the Celtics to change.</p>

<p>Michael Jordan was the best player on the floor vs the 86 Celtics for the whole series…as he got swept.</p>

      <label for="l7lb5tt" class="commentText"><p>I agree and that’s how I think Boston gets their biggest advantage - by forcing you to overreact from their unsustainable shot making.</p>

<p>Celtics hit like 7 or 8 3s in the 1st but only finished with 16 for the game. It’s not sustainable to hit 28 3s in a game, but you panic because you’re down nearly 20. You move away from your principles and try to match shot for shot which itself is a fools errand because 3 point shooting is incredibly variable and subject to runs.</p>

<p>But Luka is special and he can still feed energy to the team. If he’s making everything (like game 5 of the WCF, or game 7 in 22) then it does give the team an extra boost in shot making.</p>

<p>I think a player of his caliber is going to figure out a winning strategy and if Joe won’t adjust, then this series may not go the way you want. Obviously I’m hoping that’s the case.</p>

And he isn’t going to beat the Celtics himself, which is why Joe is going with this strategy. Force him to win the game himself by cutting out his options he likes to have.

      <label for="l7lsrnz" class="commentText"><p>There’s a small handful of players who are special on both ends of the court and even smaller who could do it the entire game.</p>

<p>The Mavs can make an adjustment. What is it? Hell if I know. I’m not an NBA coach. But I know that 16 3s made out of 40 attempts got 108 points and we can score that much.</p>

<p>I think the idea that “well Luka won’t score 50 every game” is probably a bad strategy, it just worked last night.</p>

<p>Let’s be clear - yall got the advantage in Finals experience as well as general playoff experience. I’m not surprised it didn’t work out last night. But you’re going to rightfully look at it from a Celtics fans perspective. “I cant possibly imagine how Dallas could win the series”. I’m looking at it saying  “I don’t see how Boston thinks we play this bad again the entire series.”</p>

<p>You win the game, the strategy looks brilliant, but if Kyrie got hot or PJ could somehow make an above the break 3, it’s a different game.</p>

<p>Like Luka is a bad FT shooter, but he missed 3 and only got 5. When I seen him go 0 for 2 I knew it was over then. When he gets continuation and can’t get the shot to fall from like 8 feet away, it’s usually a wrap.</p>

<p>If I had to guess, I think Lukas more aggressive in the first and they look to post up PJ on either White or Holiday to get him going. The first thing will be to force Tatum or Brown to actually defend a wing and not Luka.</p>

<p>Defensively, I don’t know. Probably put PJ on the 5 and have Gafford on a corner shooter to help with paint contests. Also, assume that KP won’t do that again. I feel pretty confident about that one, but we will see which role player steps up if he falters.</p>

<p>Lively has got to player better and smarter, but any Mavs fan can tell you he’s the least of our problems. He has an uncanny ability to learn and adjust on the fly.</p>

<p>Im really not worried about it. We play shitty after a long layoff, and a lot of guys look like the moment hit them pretty hard. Also, streaks are made to be broken and Kyrie is on a long skid in Boston. We literally just saw his closeout game streak get broken. I anticipate the Boston curse breaks and we get some regression to the mean.</p>

Luka Doncic is no MJ, he is no Magic or Bird, nor is he on the same level as Wilt, Tim Duncan, Lebron, Curry, Abdul-Jabbar; hell I&rsquo;d say Karl Malone and Drexler even outclass him. He&rsquo;s an above-average baller having a monster year. I don&rsquo;t get why you Mavs fans are so in love with him. He bitches a lot on the court and even though he is the best player in these Finals, he ain&rsquo;t no hero. Just a basketball player who is clearly outmatched by a much stronger squad. Maybe the mental gymnastics make you feel better, but you&rsquo;re divorced from reality.</p>

We actually shot even worse against y’all than we did game 1 against the Clippers when we had one of the worst first half performances I’ve ever seen offensively.</p>

<p>You’re also looking at the total game stats, that first quarter I don’t think y’all missed ANYTHING. If you think it’s normal that KP goes nuclear like that isn’t an outlier, then I don’t know what to tell you. He literally averages 12ppg in the playoffs lol.</p>

      <label for="l7m8h07" class="commentText"><p>If I were a mavericks fan I would be worried that everyone is just assuming Luka is going to have a number of these nuclear games where he signlehandedly wins. I’m sure he’ll be good all series, but what if his good games look more like this one… the Mavs need everything to break their way to get a win</p>

      <label for="l7mnvui" class="commentText"><p>Well, do you really believe he only has one assist in the rest of the series?</p>

<p>The right strategy to win game 1 isn’t guaranteed to work again in game 2, and definitely not guaranteed to work the entire series.</p>

<p>But I’ll concede that if I were a Celtics fan there’s no reason to expect anything different than what’s happened in the previous 3 series. Just like Mavs fans have every reason to expect a win in game 2, like we have grown to expect it over the course of our last two runs with JKidd.</p>

<p>But as I mentioned in another reply on this thread, it’s definitely not like Luka and the Mavs have beaten a 64 win team before. And it’s definitely not gone to 7 games.</p>

<p>That’s why I’m (and most Mavs fans) are confident - we got Luka.</p>

<p>If you hold him to 30/1/10 you’ve literally managed to do something no other team has ever done to Luka. It COULD happen..but it won’t.</p>

<p>Yall good- but you not so good as to never make an adjustment. We will break the initial defensive plan, and it will be on Mazzulla to adjust. If we break it and he stays annoyingly stuck to the plan, you will lose.</p>

<p>That said, no Celtics fan has any reason to believe me because yall won 64 games and steamrolled through the Eastern Conference and have now beaten us 3 times this year.</p>

<p>And yet, I feel just as confident today that we will eventually break you down. Mavs are the best team out of the West; you will eventually take our best punch.</p>

      <label for="l7kpq8r" class="commentText"><p>There are a few things that would make me a bit optimistic for the Mavs, and it&rsquo;s not the shooting numbers (which weren&rsquo;t even that good by Boston)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Luka didn&rsquo;t play very well, particularly in the first half. It didn&rsquo;t even really feel like it was because of the defense so much as he was getting his sea legs with the amount of dudes they throw at him. But it seemed like he can beat every one of them, pretty easily. He&rsquo;ll destroy boston if they leave him 1 on 1 all series. I just don&rsquo;t know if he can destroy them enough to win 4 our of 6.</p></li>

<li><p>I don&rsquo;t know what the Mavs were doing defensively in the first half. They looked confused that Boston could shoot 1-5, which made no sense. That&rsquo;ll change, but more importantly, they got roasted for Offensive rebounds in the first half which lead to a lot of those open Boston threes. They missed a ton of box outs, and if they clean that up, it&rsquo;s not a 30 point lead, but a 20 point lead.</p></li>

<li><p>Lively didn&rsquo;t know what he was doing, and got 5 fouls in like 15 minutes. If he calms down and stops trying to body Tatum and Zingus 25 feet from the rim, he&rsquo;s going to return his elite plus minus numbers back to the Mavs. He&rsquo;s very switchable and should be looking to contest threes and prevent the drive. The opposite of what he did yesterday.</p></li>

<li><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t count on Kyrie, Lively and PJ having bad games at the same time again the rest of this series.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That being said, there&rsquo;s very few teams in league history that can match their level of depth of two way players, and when they&rsquo;re all locked in they&rsquo;re nearly impossible to beat. And maybe now that it&rsquo;s the finals, they&rsquo;re going to finally do lock in, because we sure as hell didn&rsquo;t see it in any of the eastern playoff series.</p>

<p>Seems like the Celtics want Luka to try and score individually against the Celtics elite defenders for 40 minutes while working him non stop on defense. Either he’ll become inefficient on offense or traffic cone on defense.</p>

      <label for="l7ku4gf" class="commentText"><p>Some very good points!</p>

<p>Regarding Luka, I think the Celtics’ gameplan is to accept that he is going to be a force offensively and to try not to let the other guys beat them. He’s going to be an incredible scorer no matter what you do. Luka has always had some issues with conditioning, and I’m not sure if he’s 100% right now either. The Celtics were attacking him defensively and forcing him to work. It’s a lot to ask from any player to carry that load, and Luka might just tire out at some point in every game</p>

<p>I agree about the Mavs’ other players. Lively is a great player who was probably just a bit too intense in his first finals game at such a young age. PJ Washington and Derrick Jones were probably playing unsustainably well at certain points in the playoffs, but you’d expect them to play better than they did last night. Kyrie is a really odd case. He’s had games during these playoffs where he’s looked incredible and others where he seems to disappear. I think a huge part of the Mavs’ championship hopes hinge on Kyrie. He needs to consistently play at the level we know he can offensively</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I buy this point.  The issue is that Lively and PJ don&rsquo;t seem like shot creators on their own.  They rely on Luka or Kyrie drawing extra attention and kicking the ball to them.  That means that if Kyrie is bad, it might have knock on effects that Lively and PJ are bad as well.</p>

      <label for="l7lfpa9" class="commentText"><p>Those were teams that were relying on the likes of, Tyler Herro, Jaime Jaquez, Darius Garland and Max Strus, and Andrew Nembhard and TJ McConnell. Why do y’all keep bringing up those series like these teams are anywhere near the Mavs? I understand y’all blew us out, but so did the Clippers and Thunder game 1. Obviously teams relying on those players will need a miracle to beat y’all.</p>

<p>I just think the mavs record and defense to end the year was overhyped based on the competition they played. They played a lot of games and feasted on the 9-12 teams which had some good records (particularly in the west). Credit to the west for being the deeper conference but that also brought up the strength of schedule rankings while still playing teams who I don&rsquo;t think are on the same level as the mavs.</p>

People just brought up the Mavs record post deadline because it WAS a complete change of team. We looked MUCH better and we obviously made some big trades. Then we beat a 1st seed, 4th seed and 3rd seed. People saw that team for like a month and couldn’t tell if they were real or not. Now we’re in the finals.

      <label for="l7l2o9d" class="commentText"><p>I have some unfortunate news for you. This is how kyrie generally plays against the celtics. He&rsquo;s going to give you 1 game where he drops 30+ on efficient shooting. The rest of the games, you are going to get ~17 points on inefficient shooting. He is also going to get killed on defense. So yes, kyrie will put up a dud from 3 again this series. He has had trouble scoring consistently against our length for like 3 or 4 years now</p>

<p>I swear, I said the same thing during the Clips/Mavs series and honestly at some point, you just gotta credit great defense when it’s due. Only 12 spot-ups is a crazy number. Looking forward to seeing how Dallas adjusts, bc Boston took away the bread-and-butter corner-3s and lobs that got Dallas this far.</p>

But instead they constantly put him into PnRs and dragged him from the basket.

      <label for="l7kjk5p" class="commentText"><p>I think it’s more he’d be more valuable if Minnesota had the perimeter defense we do. They’ve got a lot of size to clog up the paint, but against a guard heavy offense that can quickly become a disadvantage when they stretch you out.</p>

<p>Boston has several perimeter guys who can do as well against Luka and Kyrie as anyone, and Tatum or Brown can handle their bigs to nullify pick and rolls if we’re worried about lobs. That sets us up to be much more strategic with how we ask KP to help, vs Minnesota who is really reliant on Gobert impacting the opposing offense any time they try to create penetration.</p>

      <label for="l7lkyo4" class="commentText"><p>The Timberwolves don&rsquo;t have the personnel to preswitch Dallas&rsquo; pick and rolls. It&rsquo;s literally the one matchup we struggle with.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re built to trap guards like Beal, Booker, Murray, and Kyrie with our length and athleticism on the perimeter and funnel everything into Rudy sitting at home in the lane. If a team tries to pull Rudy out, we can sit KAT or Naz there who can rim protect but are fast enough to close out to the corner. Rudy has actually shown great ability at coming up and recovering after guarding near the perimeter these playoffs (minus the infamous game winner).</p>

<p>The issue with Dallas is Luka has 40-60lbs on McDaniels, NAW, Conley, and Ant and is able to toss them around like rag dolls. He&rsquo;d get any of those four on his back and then all of a sudden Gobert is frozen guarding both Luka and the lob. KAT and Naz are responsible for closing out the corner threes so Luka was able to look them off with his eyes to fake the kickout and get the lob pass in that way.</p>

<p>The Wolves had a ton of success with Kyle Anderson guarding and preswitching onto Luka, but he&rsquo;s severely lacking on the offensive end. Dallas was able to leave him and bracket Ant with double and triple teams with Kyle on the floor.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why every game was single digits until the Mavs went up 3-0: the Wolves were stuck in a massive pick your poison of having a cohesive offensive or a defensive capable of stopping Luka. And if the game&rsquo;s close in the 4th, Luka will find a way to close it.</p>

<p>The Celtics have White, Brown, and Holiday all of whom are pretty beefy and can all at least stay in front of Luka which lets Porzingis roam more effectively.</p>

      <label for="l7ku3m6" class="commentText"><p>The issue with the Timberwolves in defending Dallas is that they have two players that are vulnerable guarding in space in their best lineups in KAT and Gobert. Against the Nuggets having KAT to body Jokic and Gobert to roam off Gordon it was great since Jokic operates out of the post. Their best wing defenders also are pretty weak so Luka could work them a lot easier with his strength. I mean he still does it to Jrue fucking Holiday but it&rsquo;s still tougher than McDaniels and NAW because they&rsquo;re so skinny lol.</p>

<p>Against the heavy pick and roll of the Mavs their personnel was turned against them.</p>

<p>The style makes the fight. We saw that on both sides of the ball last night. We&rsquo;re a worse matchup for them than the Wolves.</p>

It made luka score 30 with 1 assist and kyrie miss a ton on good defenders.. while the mavs defense was dont let tatum get anything, 3 guys were always focused on him and the entire team collapsed every time he went to the paint.. so tatum drove and kicked it out and they passed it around the perimeter with the mavs defense trying to recover repeatedly till they got the open shot (usually on the switch that luka was suppose to make and didnt.. his defense was AWFUL all game).</p>

Let’s stop making sweeping generalizations based on a game. Boston is obviously the better team over the season but over the past 30-40 games the disparity is much less if at all. Let’s see how the next couple games play out and then say these types of things</p>

      <label for="l7ksaew" class="commentText"><p>I think that unless the Celtics are just suddenly less able to guard/cover guys for some reason, the Mavs best shot is to use more perimeter ball movement at get PJ Washington, Derrick Jones, and maybe even Hardaway involved in initiating the attack. If they can get defenders off balance and moving the wrong way they have a better chance. Luka wants to use his own gravity to pull everyone else open, but I don&rsquo;t see him having enough gravity in this series for that to work.</p>

It worked especially well once they built up that huge lead off of Porzingod but I think if the game was closer throughout they would have to switch it up more.</p>

      <label for="l7la1kn" class="commentText"><p>Dallas had multiple issues last night. They couldn&rsquo;t buy a bucket to save their lives in crucial moments. They also weren&rsquo;t moving the ball like they normally have been in these playoffs so it always just felt like the wrong player was shooting the ball. Like it was basically always the first guy dribbling up the floor, which is an issue.</p>

      <label for="l7lcr5k" class="commentText"><p>Mavs role players straight up were not shooting, passing on decent shots all game long. That is the difference. On boston every player can shoot contested catch and shoot 3s. Most guys on dallas only do so when wide open. Most obvious examples being Maxi and DJJ.</p>

      <label for="l7l1h4i" class="commentText"><p>Thank you. Couldn’t agree more. We suffocated their offense - it wasn’t just bad shooting, it was also that they didn’t get many good shots at all.</p>
