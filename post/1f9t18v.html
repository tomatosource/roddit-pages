      <label for="llo8ugz" class="commentText"><p>I actually think it’s a fair and valid point.  It’s why he struggles in the playoffs when teams collapse the paint and he doesn’t have a lane.  Obviously he’s quite an accomplished player and has won a championship but the way the bucks struggle reminds me a lot of the Dwight Howard led magic teams.  Their offense relies on Gianni’s playing in the paint and kicking out if he’s doubled. If his teammates can’t make their shots and Gianni’s can’t drive in they’re pretty screwed.  Won’t matter in the regular season but they’ll struggle greatly in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Go look at every other superstar that was 2+ rings they all have elite second options.</p>

<p>Khris is great but he’s not a top tier second option. He’s capable of 25+ pt games and clutch shots but in between those moments he’s inconsistent as fuck.</p>

<p>If you gave him a Kyrie or dame like 3-4 years ago he could probably have atleast 2 championships.</p>

<p>You’re about to find out with Brunson that it takes far more than just a decent second option to win a title.</p>

<p>Young Barkley was honestly a lot like Giannis. He led the NBA in 2 point FG percentage for like 5 years in a row while going downhill in transition and finishing at the rim a lot. Old Barkley was more of a pure post player but young Barkley was a guy who could grab a rebound, dribble it the length of the court, and dunk it on you, kinda like a shorter Giannis. </p>

      <label for="llo0xtl" class="commentText"><p>There’s survivorship bias here. I would say the base case is only a marginal improvement. </p>

<p>I never really consider Brook or KAT in my examples. Both were excellent (high 70s to 80s percent) FT shooters but just didn’t take that many long jump shots.</p>

<p>However, to your point, there are some good examples though of bad FT shooters who made huge improvements, such as Herb Jones, Al Horford, and a few others. So yes I agree there are players who do indeed improve but the average case is certainly not a lot. </p>

<p>The survivorship bias makes it seem like it’s easy to improve than reality because we forget about all those guys who don’t improve and aren’t in the league in 2-4 years so we don’t remember all the failed ones. </p>

KAT getting better at 3&rsquo;s is really an exception, and the limitations show, when you get that confidence in the 3, you lose sight of what made you what you are.</p>

KAT had a bad shooting series against the Mavs but it was an unfortunate anomaly and they were mostly good open looks. He still shot 42% in the playoffs overall on 5 attempts a game. Frankly i’d like him to shoot 8 a game. Steph took 12 a game last year</p>

<p>His biggest issue is when he gets out of control and gets called for charges attacking the basket</p>

<p>Why do people like you just talk in absolutes? No one is asking Giannis to play like Kyrie and get the ball 30 feet away from the rim. Developing a consistent jumpshot means the defense actually has to respect you which makes driving so much easier + it improves your longevity. Lebron would not be nearly as effective as he is today without the improvements he&rsquo;s made to his 3 point shot.</p>

<p>The guy just gave 3 examples of when they said those exact things about bigs who tried expanding their games, even marginally. No one is asking Giannis to play like Kyrie, and no one is saying that that&rsquo;s what people are asking of him.</p>

<p>I’d say it’s working out just fine</p>

<p>Idk why people pretend he isn’t trying to work on mid ranges, 3s, FTs etc.. I just don’t think it’s possible for him to ever be great at those due to his build.</p>

<p>A Giannis with a jump shot would likely be the most impossible player to defend in history of the nba. Criticizing him for not being a perfect player is stupid.</p>

<p>Is that really a volume 3 pt shooter? Lol</p>

<p>The most he attempted a game was 2019 and was 4.5 but he hit them at 30% which is still bad but not the worst in league history.</p>

      <label for="lloosw1" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s actually hilarious how the narrative around him constantly shifts between he&rsquo;s the best player in the league and he needs to get better and be able to shoot. Like you said, if he was a great shooter he&rsquo;d maybe be the GOAT, so this sort of criticism almost feels like it&rsquo;s implying that players should not have any weaknesses. Charles is also missing the fact that he has improved his court vision and passing in recent years which helps prevent him from getting stuck driving into defenders </p>

<p>Kristaps Porzingis is one of the best shooters in the league. Sure Giannis is a little broader, but it&rsquo;s definitely overcomable.</p>

<p>Yes, notorious post player, Steph Curry. A guard who bombs 11 3&rsquo;s a game, having a better TS%, says something about Giannis&rsquo; TS%, considering 60%+ of all his attempts are from 10ft or closer.</p>

<p>Try reading the post before commenting, it helps. Dude is a 28% career 3pt shooter, and a 70% FT shooter, you think those are what&rsquo;s bolstering his TS%?</p>

<p>but it has been like average to below average 3 out of the last 5 playoffs</p>

<p>i also don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what Barkley is saying tho, the problem is yeah in the course of the game Giannis will get 25-30 on 58ish% TS in the playoffs</p>

<p>but skill matters when you&rsquo;re trying to stop a run or close a game, and it&rsquo;s okay give me the ball in the post, give me the ball in a pnr, give me the ball in the high post, etc</p>

<p>even in 2021, it was Middleton who started the playoffs with a game winner, and ended the playoffs with that huge dagger over Booker, but in the course of those games, Giannis was doing his thing</p>

<p>2020(I’m sure is one of them your referencing) he was bad and I can’t deny that</p>

<p>2022: he was easily the best player vs the Celtics and Kd who is one of the best shooters had the same TS as Giannis. He took them to 7 when it had no business going that far</p>

<p>2023: he was hurt every game he played in</p>

<p>Not every superstar in league history is some clutch god who you can always give the ball and trust. I’m fine with saying Giannis isn’t the most clutch player but acting like he can’t make clutch players is dumb cause I’ve seen him do it several times in the playoffs.</p>

<p>I mean he was clutch against the suns, made the shot that put them ahead in OT against the nets, made a clutch 3 to tie the game late against Celtics, makes several defensive plays. Those are just some off the top of my head</p>

<p>2019 he was awful vs the raptors, obviously not as bad as Bledsoe, also that was Buds fault 50%</p>

<p>2022 he was incredible because of all the rest of his game, but i think it&rsquo;s still fair to critize the efficiency, if he&rsquo;s on the same tier as Jokic, prime Steph, KD, and all the top 30ish players all time, he has to be held to that standard</p>

<p>He had success in 2021 because the Suns literally guarded Giannis 1 on 1. They left Ayton alone on island.</p>

<p>The criticism is that when he&rsquo;s forced to play 1 v 5, which most playoff defenses so, he struggles to be as efficient. This has continued to be the case since his championship run.</p>

      <label for="llojlv0" class="commentText"><p>Your casualness shows in your take.</p>

<p>No other player faces 3 players at the rim because they can shoot and/or they can pass to shooters.</p>

<p>Teams would implement a wall defense against every great player if they could, but their ability to shoot prevents that and spacing punishes that.</p>

<p>One such other example is how the Celtics defended Kobe who is a very solid shooter. They used wall-like pre-helping defense to prevent Kobe from getting to the basket, and could play up on his jumpshot. The reason this was effective at all was because Kobe played in the Triangle alongside 2 other bigs at all times that congested the paint who actively sat in the post positions and were not threats to spread the floor.</p>

      <label for="llooph4" class="commentText"><p>Obviously Giannis has trouble shooting but nobody is denying that.</p>

<p>First off people need to stop acting like Giannis is a playoff dropper when he almost sent the Celtics home in 6 without Khris Middleton and an offensively inept Jrue Holiday. Not to mention the 2019 and 2021 playoffs. He is only being criticized because he has not been healthy in 23&rsquo; and 24&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Giannis has grown immensely as a playmaker to punish double teams. Shooting 60% with 30ppg while being a great playmaker and defender.</p>

<p>If Giannis was as bad as a offensive player as Jokic was as a defender people would slander the man like hell. But with Jokic and Luka only one side matters to some of y&rsquo;all.</p>

<p>Giannis has not killed his teams chances because of shooting like Luka has killed his team in the finals because of his Defense. Not saying he shouldn&rsquo;t try to be better but let&rsquo;s stop the run and dunk man exaggeration he is top 4 offensively skilled big man at worst.</p>

With that being said, I think the one skill that Giannis should work on is post moves/footwork. He is a very good scorer but at the same time he is not a versatile scorer. We know he will never be a good shooter, but I think he can improve his post game</p>

      <label for="lloe9bk" class="commentText"><p>Old heads can’t have it both ways. They get on people like Embiid and Ant for taking too many jump shots, then get on people like Giannis for driving into the paint too much.</p>

<p>Giannis is at his best when driving to the rim. Would he be a better player if he shot the ball better? Absolutely. But he averaged over <sup>30</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> last year while also averaging more assists than guards like Shai, Maxey, and Murray. And that’s not even including his elite defensive ability. But somehow he needs to “get better as a basketball player”?</p>

<p>Imo podcasts have shown how bad older players are at watching basketball and understanding the game from the sidelines. They’re obviously great at playing, but there’s a reason a lot of the elite players don’t get into coaching post retirement.</p>

      <label for="lloi8m1" class="commentText"><p>I totally get this take but honestly it&rsquo;s a little outdated and is only accurate in a vacuum when you&rsquo;re not taking anything else into consideration.</p>

<p>Giannis in 2019 and 2020 had to do this bc they didn&rsquo;t have enough creators. They had Eric Bledsoe at pg who couldn&rsquo;t shoot either, and only had Middleton to generate additional offense. Giannis also didn&rsquo;t trust his teammates and imo learned his &ldquo;1-5 isn&rsquo;t going to work&rdquo; lesson during this time</p>

<p>2021 they had Jrue which helped reduce the amount of 1v5 on offense. Played a ton of pnr with Khris Middleton which they hadn&rsquo;t done much prior to that.</p>

<p>2022, he shot like 40 percent from midrange that year. Middleton got hurt and it was just him and Jrue v the Celtics in terms of offensive creation (7 games)</p>

<p>2023 avgd 31.8 PPG but in the playoffs he fell on Kevin Love and the heat were on stupid fire from 3 that series</p>

<p>2024, got Dame, giannis averaged over 30 PPG on 60 TS, but was hurt and didn&rsquo;t play in the playoffs.</p>

<p>That all being said, his passing has also been improved over the years and doesn&rsquo;t get enough appreciation in my opinion.
He&rsquo;s averaged about 5.8 assists a game for the past 5-6 years and last year he averaged 6.5!</p>

<p>Besides Jokic, Sabonis, and LeBron, idk how many other bigs pass like that. And that&rsquo;s carrying a heavier load on defense too.</p>

<p>Long story short I think at this point moving forward, Giannis getting better isn&rsquo;t necessarily doing more, it&rsquo;s doing less but better.</p>

It’d make him &amp; Dame an even deadlier duo, and if he can hit it at 35% the Bucks would be a terror. But outside of that, I don’t really see where else Giannis needs to improve that much.

<p>Let;s be honest that was a complete fluke during the flukeist period in NBA history.</p>

<p>Outside of that one year he has done nothing.</p>

<p>Giannis has become an afterthought pretty much. Guys like Luka and Jokic have surpassed his relevancy because everybody knows they are far more skilled and dont need injury luck to win</p>

      <label for="llocs6g" class="commentText"><p>People here defending Giannis against Barkley&rsquo;s criticisms because he won a title shows you how casual they are, and the difference truly shows in that casual fans don&rsquo;t watch the game but Barkley does.</p>

<p>Barkley&rsquo;s criticism is correct. Giannis has too many flaws in his game so that when he runs into walls in the playoffs he becomes much less effective. That is the 1 on 5 basketball Barkley is referring to.</p>

<p>In the series against the Suns they left Ayton alone to guard Giannis 1 on 1. This is pretty well documented and various YouTube channels that focus on film and analyze that series. So of course, Giannis dominated. He didn&rsquo;t play 1 on 5, the Suns let him play 1 on 1.</p>

<p>The idea that Giannis wins a title = criticism doesn&rsquo;t apply, and the idea that the Suns had a good defensive rating = they played good defense against Giannis is literally peak casual shitdom.</p>

<p>Giannis literally continues to struggle against teams in the playoffs since his title year, unable to efficiently score against teams that build walling defenses in the paint because he lacks both a jumper and post moves.</p>

      <label for="llo3ygu" class="commentText"><p>Im not trying to shit on him but it’s fascinating how winning 1 championship changed the entire perception of Giannis.</p>

<p>Before 2021 people talked about how easy it was to defend him pointing to the Heat and Raptors, that the Bucks best win was against the 2019 Celtics, how his shooting (26% from 3, 61% from the line) would always limit his team.</p>

<p>The situation hasn’t changed much since then, the Bucks’ only win came against the 2022 Bulls, Giannis’ efficiency still gets worse in the playoffs but everything is alright because he was gigantic in 2021.</p>

<p>Against not trying to hate, I’m just surprised by how much his championship run affected his perception</p>

      <label for="lloavw1" class="commentText"><p>That’s how it is with any superstar. One ring for Dirk changed his entire perception. The run by kawhi in 2019 vaults him super high in all time rankings even thought he hasn’t done anything since then. All it literally takes is one historic run. Dropping 50 points in game 6 in the finals to win it all will make everyone see you differently.</p>

<p>After that Bulls series in 2022, he faced the Celtics. He was without Middleton and was incredible. Truly unstoppable and almost won that series by himself. It was a consensus that he was the best player in the world even after they lost that series. Following 2 years, it’s been injuries. So the last time we saw him healthy in the playoffs, he looked like a man possessed.</p>

      <label for="llocle0" class="commentText"><p>I thought the Bucks were also the best team (and Giannis the league&rsquo;s best player) in 2022.  They probably would have won with a healthy Middleton.</p>

<p>Also, while Chuck&rsquo;s position here is lazily-phrased, following a 5 year old narrative, there is something to it, in that I think the Bucks&rsquo; most efficient offense features less of Giannis as primary ball handler attacking from the perimeter, and more him getting the ball in the posts and attacking in the short roll of pnr as the screener&hellip;I mean, was this not the primary appeal of getting an elite scoring guard like Lillard?  The problem is it did not seem like figured out the balance, or developed a chemistry in the 2 man game.</p>

      <label for="llokwdc" class="commentText"><p>Ring culture has ruined the NBA. You are now expected to bow down to a player simply for winning a championship (no matter what the circumstances actually were) even when their resume as a whole isn&rsquo;t even close to impressive.</p>

<p>There are people who will seriously argue that Player A winning one ring through sheer luck but not having continued playoff success throughout their career is better than Player B who was frequently good in the playoffs and against great teams but for a variety of reasons never won.</p>

      <label for="llof8e5" class="commentText"><p>Imagine being downvoted for literally speaking the truth.</p>

<p>He struggled before 2021. He struggled after 2021.</p>

<p>The difference in 2021? He played the shithead Suns who thought they could guard Giannis 1on1.</p>
