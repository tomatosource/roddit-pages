      <label for="llnyz3n" class="commentText"><p>It’s honestly hard to improve shooting 3s. Barkley never improved his 3 for his entire career but kept on taking 3s at a way higher volume than what he should have been taking them at. </p>

<p>Young Barkley was honestly a lot like Giannis. He led the NBA in 2 point FG percentage for like 5 years in a row while going downhill in transition and finishing at the rim a lot. Old Barkley was more of a pure post player but young Barkley was a guy who could grab a rebound, dribble it the length of the court, and dunk it on you, kinda like a shorter Giannis. </p>

<p>None of this to say Giannis isn&rsquo;t great. He&rsquo;s a 2x MVP and former DPOY. He&rsquo;s obviously a legend. It&rsquo;s just that the window for rings closes a lot more quickly than some  guys realize.</p>

      <label for="llqemuf" class="commentText"><p>Plus, Giannis is gonna be 30 now and has had pretty bad injuries the last 2-3 years in a row. It&rsquo;s a super valid criticism, he and anyone else can&rsquo;t expect that his old style of play is gonna continue to just work. If he loses a step and his athleticism goes, he&rsquo;s gonna get bad real fast if he doesn&rsquo;t develop more well rounded skillset.</p>

<p>To be clear I say bad relatively, a &lsquo;bad&rsquo; Giannis is still gonna be a very good player, but nowhere near top 3 in the league good.</p>

      <label for="llqjfvv" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s always the risk. But I do want to point out that Giannis just played the most games since 2017-2018 and just finished with the highest TS% of his career, so he&rsquo;s still up there in the stratosphere. It&rsquo;s all very hypothetical at this point as to how he&rsquo;ll age as a player.</p>

<p>Only reason he didn’t take a step back and shoot threes on the nets was because we had dumb fucking coaches who wouldn’t let him. Until his last year when Atkinson took over.</p>

      <label for="llo0xtl" class="commentText"><p>There’s survivorship bias here. I would say the base case is only a marginal improvement. </p>

<p>I never really consider Brook or KAT in my examples. Both were excellent (high 70s to 80s percent) FT shooters but just didn’t take that many long jump shots.</p>

<p>However, to your point, there are some good examples though of bad FT shooters who made huge improvements, such as Herb Jones, Al Horford, and a few others. So yes I agree there are players who do indeed improve but the average case is certainly not a lot. </p>

<p>The survivorship bias makes it seem like it’s easy to improve than reality because we forget about all those guys who don’t improve and aren’t in the league in 2-4 years so we don’t remember all the failed ones. </p>

Both of the last two years he shot under his career average from both  FT line and 3pt line, meaning he&rsquo;s actually getting worse as a shooter.  He&rsquo;s still amazing.  But he&rsquo;s just not a shooter and he never will be.  If you look at bigs who became three point shooters late in their careers - like Lopez, or Al Horford - they were always excellent FT shooters.</p>

The team as a whole didn&rsquo;t ever really have time to gel between injuries and a mid-season coaching change. Also, Dame isn&rsquo;t at his best as a spot up shooter.

      <label for="llq9gt6" class="commentText"><p>I wonder if people actually watch Bucks games… Giannis doesn’t really do the “bull rush” rim running in a few seasons.</p>

<p>He attacks the rim, but it’s mostly angles, layups, baby hooks, turn arounds, up &amp; under, euro step, etc.</p>

<p>He is also doing quite a bit of midrange work form the nail. So, he does exactly what people say he doesn’t do.</p>

<p>If they want him to be KD, he won’t be. What he is working on mostly now is FT and midrange (working out with Tatum’s shooting coach, and he poached Olymbiacos BC’s developmental guru as his own personal coach).</p>

      <label for="llo8ugz" class="commentText"><p>I actually think it’s a fair and valid point.  It’s why he struggles in the playoffs when teams collapse the paint and he doesn’t have a lane.  Obviously he’s quite an accomplished player and has won a championship but the way the bucks struggle reminds me a lot of the Dwight Howard led magic teams.  Their offense relies on Gianni’s playing in the paint and kicking out if he’s doubled. If his teammates can’t make their shots and Gianni’s can’t drive in they’re pretty screwed.  Won’t matter in the regular season but they’ll struggle greatly in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="llpq6mm" class="commentText"><p>His injury against the Heat was him getting flipped on his back due to an illegal block from K Love, then landing awkwardly on his tailbone.</p>

<p>I guess the calf injury could be due to his playstyle, but it&rsquo;s hard to know if that will be any sign of what&rsquo;s to come, considering it&rsquo;s the only injury of that type he has ever sustained.</p>

<p>What exactly are we saying here? The Bucks won&rsquo;t win the championship because Giannis can&rsquo;t shoot? They already won one despite all the weaknesses in his game. The Bucks won&rsquo;t win the championship because the rest of the roster isn&rsquo;t that good and the coaching isn&rsquo;t that good. Is Giannis perfect? No, no one is. I fail to see how Giannis is even remotely part of the problem.</p>

<p>Jokic has flaws on defense. They&rsquo;re not a top contender because Jamal Murray can&rsquo;t stay healthy, they lost key rotation players, and the rest of the team is prone to struggling. Same with Luka, but even worse on defense. Shai arguably has the fewest weaknesses of the top guys with a better team yet hasn&rsquo;t made the Finals yet. What do we ding him on?</p>

      <label for="llqdgxn" class="commentText"><p>Ne of the best things about Jordan is how he evolved as a player even when he was the best player in the league.   Early on when he was still a top player in the league he was seen only as a scorer.   Phil Jackson got him to buy into the triangle offense.    He became a better defender snd and a better shooter</p>

<p>Lebron as great as he is people have said that needs to become a better shooter.    There is nothing wrong with that.   The man is still great</p>

<p>My guess is a guy like Giannis would welcome this take from Charles and not take it as an insult.  Some fans just don’t want to hear anything they perceive as negative about players they like.     You see the same thing in this sub when people talk about Luka’s defense.</p>

      <label for="llp2iqx" class="commentText"><p>Giannis has been injured the past two playoffs. The last time he was healthy, he took the Celtics to Game 7, three seasons ago with Jrue Holiday as his co-star who played absolute ass in that series. Not only that but, only one other player on the Bucks played any sort of decent that series and it was Pat of all players.</p>

<p>If the Bucks fail, it&rsquo;s probably not going to be on Giannis. Giannis shooting from three isn&rsquo;t going to not make his co-stars dissappear in the playoffs. That&rsquo;s why we made the trade for Dame to help out with the teams offensive consistency. Unfortunately, Giannis got injured, so we never saw that play out.</p>

He just needs to add more wrinkles to his game. That&rsquo;s what these guys are talking about. It&rsquo;s also more sustainable. Less offensive fouls in the playoffs, more energy for other parts of the game and to play more minutes. He&rsquo;s still 29. There&rsquo;s time for one more evolution of Giannis</p>

      <label for="llp8mat" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think Giannis is ever going to add anything outside the paint to his game besides maybe a decent mid range game which he showed somewhat last season. He&rsquo;s 7 feet tall, 240 Lbs of muscle and isn&rsquo;t even a good free throw shooter. It&rsquo;s rare for someone his size to just suddenly obtain shooting abilities. I&rsquo;m 100% sure Giannis is working on improving his outside game but, you can&rsquo;t improve everything. I think a low-post game would be more realistic for Giannis to work on.</p>

<p>Idk why people pretend he isn’t trying to work on mid ranges, 3s, FTs etc.. I just don’t think it’s possible for him to ever be great at those due to his build.</p>

<p>A Giannis with a jump shot would likely be the most impossible player to defend in history of the nba. Criticizing him for not being a perfect player is stupid.</p>

<p>Someone posted about the most clutch players in the past whatever years recently and Giannis was on the list albeit it wasn’t as many attempts as most guys but saying he’s ineffective at the end of games just proves you don’t watch him.</p>

<p>You can easily search “giannis clutch moments” and you’ll get several highlights of both offense and defense</p>

<p>Like you said, if he was a great shooter he&rsquo;d maybe be the GOAT, so this sort of criticism almost feels like it&rsquo;s implying that players should not have any weaknesses. It&rsquo;s like if someone started criticizing Shaq for not being a better shooter or Kobe for not being a great passer. Like yes of course those things are true, but LeBron may be the only player who has pretty much 0 weaknesses in their game. Charles is also missing the fact that he has improved his court vision and passing in recent years which helps prevent him from getting stuck driving into defenders </p>

<p>Why do people like you just talk in absolutes? No one is asking Giannis to play like Kyrie and get the ball 30 feet away from the rim. Developing a consistent jumpshot means the defense actually has to respect you which makes driving so much easier + it improves your longevity. Lebron would not be nearly as effective as he is today without the improvements he&rsquo;s made to his 3 point shot.</p>

      <label for="lloi8m1" class="commentText"><p>I totally get this take but honestly it&rsquo;s a little outdated and is only accurate in a vacuum when you&rsquo;re not taking anything else into consideration.</p>

<p>Giannis in 2019 and 2020 had to do this bc they didn&rsquo;t have enough creators. They had Eric Bledsoe at pg who couldn&rsquo;t shoot either, and only had Middleton to generate additional offense. Giannis also didn&rsquo;t trust his teammates and imo learned his &ldquo;1-5 isn&rsquo;t going to work&rdquo; lesson during this time</p>

<p>2021 they had Jrue which helped reduce the amount of 1v5 on offense. Played a ton of pnr with Khris Middleton which they hadn&rsquo;t done much prior to that.</p>

<p>2022, he shot like 40 percent from midrange that year. Middleton got hurt and it was just him and Jrue v the Celtics in terms of offensive creation (7 games)</p>

<p>2023 avgd 31.8 PPG but in the playoffs he fell on Kevin Love and the heat were on stupid fire from 3 that series</p>

<p>2024, got Dame, giannis averaged over 30 PPG on 60 TS, but was hurt and didn&rsquo;t play in the playoffs.</p>

<p>That all being said, his passing has also been improved over the years and doesn&rsquo;t get enough appreciation in my opinion.
He&rsquo;s averaged about 5.8 assists a game for the past 5-6 years and last year he averaged 6.5!</p>

<p>Besides Jokic, Sabonis, and LeBron, idk how many other bigs pass like that. And that&rsquo;s carrying a heavier load on defense too.</p>

<p>Long story short I think at this point moving forward, Giannis getting better isn&rsquo;t necessarily doing more, it&rsquo;s doing less but better.</p>

He scored 50 in a finals game. The Bucks didn’t perform up to expectations but that’s for a myriad of reasons many of which are more detrimental to team success than Giannis’ limited playstyle. At the end of the day the freak is a top 3 player in the league and a proven winner.</p>

      <label for="llod0py" class="commentText"><p>Giannis is a very good player and complete player, since he is an insane scorer, a very good defender and a good playmaker/passer. With that being said, I think the one skill that Giannis should work on is post moves/footwork. He is a very good scorer but at the same time he is not a versatile scorer. We know he will never be a good shooter, but I think he can improve his post game</p>

      <label for="llowcso" class="commentText"><p>honestly, somewhat agree with Chuck here. Giannis is going to be 30 this year and there&rsquo;s only a few years left of elite athleticism for him. But i don&rsquo;t think he necessarily needs to add a 3 to his game if it never improves&hellip;all he really needs to add is a reliable post fadeaway shot and he&rsquo;s going to be so much better. He&rsquo;s already shown that he can knock it down here and there, he&rsquo;s got insane length and will become unguardable if he gets elite with it</p>

      <label for="lloe9bk" class="commentText"><p>Old heads can’t have it both ways. They get on people like Embiid and Ant for taking too many jump shots, then get on people like Giannis for driving into the paint too much.</p>

<p>Giannis is at his best when driving to the rim. Would he be a better player if he shot the ball better? Absolutely. But he averaged over <sup>30</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> last year while also averaging more assists than guards like Shai, Maxey, and Murray. And that’s not even including his elite defensive ability. But somehow he needs to “get better as a basketball player”?</p>

<p>Imo podcasts have shown how bad older players are at watching basketball and understanding the game from the sidelines. They’re obviously great at playing, but there’s a reason a lot of the elite players don’t get into coaching post retirement.</p>

<p>That said, saying &ldquo;just going downhill 1-on-5 isn&rsquo;t going to work&rdquo; seems pretty silly when applied to an 8 time All-NBA two-time MVP who led his team to a championship while winning Finals MVP and remains at the very worst a top 5 player in the league. It seems to be working okay.</p>

      <label for="llq9dlp" class="commentText"><p>As a Bucks fan and huge Giannis fan, Chucks right and Giannis would agree. GA is one of those guys always improving. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair at this point in his career  to say he&rsquo;s ONLY going downhill, but to be fair, he is always amongst the highest efficiency drivers and rim scorers, so if it ain&rsquo;t broke don&rsquo;t fix it. And over the past few seasons he&rsquo;s added that post turn around and his pull up middy. I think he badly needs to figure out his free throws, and a floater would be very beneficial as well. The stuff about the three pointer is eh. Would it help? Sure, but with his ability to drive and finish, like Bron, every time he settles for a jumper is a win for the defense. But to me this isn&rsquo;t a hot take. A great player shouldnt get complacent and should look to add more tools to their game? Duh.</p>

<p>Giannis is one of the greats, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean he can&rsquo;t be better. With benefit for the entire team.</p>
