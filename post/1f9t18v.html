His % wasn&rsquo;t great or anything last year but I remember it was better than LeBron, Butler and a few other guys. If he can get it up to 40% he&rsquo;ll be in excellent shape the next few years. Likewise if he can get the 3p% above 30.</p>

      <label for="llo8ugz" class="commentText"><p>I actually think it’s a fair and valid point.  It’s why he struggles in the playoffs when teams collapse the paint and he doesn’t have a lane.  Obviously he’s quite an accomplished player and has won a championship but the way the bucks struggle reminds me a lot of the Dwight Howard led magic teams.  Their offense relies on Gianni’s playing in the paint and kicking out if he’s doubled. If his teammates can’t make their shots and Gianni’s can’t drive in they’re pretty screwed.  Won’t matter in the regular season but they’ll struggle greatly in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Young Barkley was honestly a lot like Giannis. He led the NBA in 2 point FG percentage for like 5 years in a row while going downhill in transition and finishing at the rim a lot. Old Barkley was more of a pure post player but young Barkley was a guy who could grab a rebound, dribble it the length of the court, and dunk it on you, kinda like a shorter Giannis. </p>

      <label for="llo0xtl" class="commentText"><p>There’s survivorship bias here. I would say the base case is only a marginal improvement. </p>

<p>I never really consider Brook or KAT in my examples. Both were excellent (high 70s to 80s percent) FT shooters but just didn’t take that many long jump shots.</p>

<p>However, to your point, there are some good examples though of bad FT shooters who made huge improvements, such as Herb Jones, Al Horford, and a few others. So yes I agree there are players who do indeed improve but the average case is certainly not a lot. </p>

<p>The survivorship bias makes it seem like it’s easy to improve than reality because we forget about all those guys who don’t improve and aren’t in the league in 2-4 years so we don’t remember all the failed ones. </p>

KAT getting better at 3&rsquo;s is really an exception, and the limitations show, when you get that confidence in the 3, you lose sight of what made you what you are.</p>

KAT had a bad shooting series against the Mavs but it was an unfortunate anomaly and they were mostly good open looks. He still shot 42% in the playoffs overall on 5 attempts a game. Frankly i’d like him to shoot 8 a game. Steph took 12 a game last year</p>

<p>His biggest issue is when he gets out of control and gets called for charges attacking the basket</p>

      <label for="llox8nm" class="commentText"><p>To be clear, I’m not suggesting the volume of Barkley is the same as Giannis in terms of initiating offense above the free throw line. </p>

<p>However, what made Barkley super unique for an 80s PF with the Sixers is he was the very first PF who really could consistently handle the ball in the open court and make decisions, which you see a lot more of today, including with Giannis. </p>

<p>Here are some young Barkley highlights I found that the NBA uploaded. This is an official upload and also has a ton of views (most of any young Barkley highlight) so I’m not cherry picking to make my point. </p>

<p><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=TKmpQyo9muU" target="_blank">https://youtube.com/watch?v=TKmpQyo9muU</a></p>

<p>I agree with you he still posted up a lot more than current Giannis and also other PFs you see today, but he definitely had a lot more to his game than just the post up. When he got older, it became pretty much all post ups though as he wasn’t as good in getting past people with his dribble. </p>

<p>Again the volume isn’t the same but there were definitely much closer similarities in 76ers Barkley play style vs Giannis than any other PF in the 80s than you might think. </p>

      <label for="lloytn2" class="commentText"><p>Oh yea old Barkley wasn’t good at taking care of his body very well so he had so many knee and back injuries he pretty much lost all his young athleticism. He still was pretty good in the post though since he still had his skill.</p>

<p>If Barkley had Karl Malone’s durability, he probably would have won in either 1994 or 1995 and been a top 12 player all time. He got injured in that 1995 series vs the Rockets when they had a 3-1 lead, and was super inefficient in game 7. </p>

<p>I’m afraid something could happen to Zion as he grows older unless he gets into shape consistently. </p>

<p>None of this to say Giannis isn&rsquo;t great. He&rsquo;s a 2x MVP and former DPOY. He&rsquo;s obviously a legend. It&rsquo;s just that the window for rings closes a lot more quickly than some  guys realize.</p>

      <label for="llp2iqx" class="commentText"><p>Giannis has been injured the past two playoffs. The last time he was healthy, he took the Celtics to Game 7, three seasons ago with Jrue Holiday as his co-star who played absolute ass in that series. Not only that but, only one other player on the Bucks played any sort of decent that series and it was Pat of all players.</p>

<p>If the Bucks fail, it&rsquo;s probably not going to be on Giannis. Giannis shooting from three isn&rsquo;t going to not make his co-stars dissappear in the playoffs. That&rsquo;s why we made the trade for Dame to help out with the teams offensive consistency. Unfortunately, Giannis got injured, so we never saw that play out.</p>

He just needs to add more wrinkles to his game. That&rsquo;s what these guys are talking about. It&rsquo;s also more sustainable. Less offensive fouls in the playoffs, more energy for other parts of the game and to play more minutes. He&rsquo;s still 29. There&rsquo;s time for one more evolution of Giannis</p>

It&rsquo;s not about him being stupid. I see him try stuff every now and then but he doesn&rsquo;t trust his other skills to go them in crucial moments (well not often enough). If he trusted his work more, it could unlock another level of player.</p>

<p>All these former players see that in him. That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;ve been making these same comments for years.</p>

      <label for="llp8mat" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think Giannis is ever going to add anything outside the paint to his game besides maybe a decent mid range game which he showed somewhat last season. He&rsquo;s 7 feet tall, 240 Lbs of muscle and isn&rsquo;t even a good free throw shooter. It&rsquo;s rare for someone his size to just suddenly obtain shooting abilities. I&rsquo;m 100% sure Giannis is working on improving his outside game but, you can&rsquo;t improve everything. I think a low-post game would be more realistic for Giannis to work on.</p>

<p>A Giannis with a jump shot would likely be the most impossible player to defend in history of the nba. Criticizing him for not being a perfect player is stupid.</p>

      <label for="llnzm0g" class="commentText"><p>We can criticize everyone. Even at his best Lebron deserves shit for his flopping and free throw %. Steph despite his flashy handles is unexpectedly turnover prone and throws lazy passes often, and not a great defender even if he’s flawless on offense. Giannis deserves it for his lack of shooting.</p>

<p>“It’s not going to work” after 2 MVPs, a chip and a finals mvp, dpoy, 6 straight all nba 1st teams, is just asinine.</p>

<p>Someone posted about the most clutch players in the past whatever years recently and Giannis was on the list albeit it wasn’t as many attempts as most guys but saying he’s ineffective at the end of games just proves you don’t watch him.</p>

<p>You can easily search “giannis clutch moments” and you’ll get several highlights of both offense and defense</p>

      <label for="lloosw1" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s actually hilarious how the narrative around him constantly shifts between he&rsquo;s the best player in the league and he needs to get better and be able to shoot. </p>

<p>Like you said, if he was a great shooter he&rsquo;d maybe be the GOAT, so this sort of criticism almost feels like it&rsquo;s implying that players should not have any weaknesses. It&rsquo;s like if someone started criticizing Shaq for not being a better shooter or Kobe for not being a great passer. Like yes of course those things are true, but LeBron may be the only player who has pretty much 0 weaknesses in their game. Charles is also missing the fact that he has improved his court vision and passing in recent years which helps prevent him from getting stuck driving into defenders </p>

Part of thag is injuries but part of it is also that having a bread and butter with no counters works well in the regular season because nobody is tailoring their gameplan to slow you down and most teams wouldn’t have the personnel to do it anyway, but come playoff time you’d have to get real lucky to go 4 straight series without running into a team that can expose that.</p>

<p>Why do people like you just talk in absolutes? No one is asking Giannis to play like Kyrie and get the ball 30 feet away from the rim. Developing a consistent jumpshot means the defense actually has to respect you which makes driving so much easier + it improves your longevity. Lebron would not be nearly as effective as he is today without the improvements he&rsquo;s made to his 3 point shot.</p>

<p>This is abit of revisionism when it comes to Blake. Blake was amazing (legitimately a top 5-10 player in the league) those couple of years in the mid 2010s (I&rsquo;m mainly thinking of the 2015 playoffs) when it seemed like he had become this extremely versatile offensive player (great court vision as a secondary or even primary facilitator, a working jumper, more patience in reacting to the opposing defense) AND was still an athletic freak that at will could just take over games by dunking on everybody. I think the problem with Blake is that as he kept getting hurt, he literally couldn&rsquo;t be the same athletic freak and that&rsquo;s when Shaq and Blake especially came down on him to develop a post game.  But remembering that 2015 Clippers-Spurs series, I feel like Shaq and Chuck had nothing but praise for Blake and how good of a well rounded player he had become.</p>

With that being said, I think the one skill that Giannis should work on is post moves/footwork. He is a very good scorer but at the same time he is not a versatile scorer. We know he will never be a good shooter, but I think he can improve his post game</p>

      <label for="lloi8m1" class="commentText"><p>I totally get this take but honestly it&rsquo;s a little outdated and is only accurate in a vacuum when you&rsquo;re not taking anything else into consideration.</p>

<p>Giannis in 2019 and 2020 had to do this bc they didn&rsquo;t have enough creators. They had Eric Bledsoe at pg who couldn&rsquo;t shoot either, and only had Middleton to generate additional offense. Giannis also didn&rsquo;t trust his teammates and imo learned his &ldquo;1-5 isn&rsquo;t going to work&rdquo; lesson during this time</p>

<p>2021 they had Jrue which helped reduce the amount of 1v5 on offense. Played a ton of pnr with Khris Middleton which they hadn&rsquo;t done much prior to that.</p>

<p>2022, he shot like 40 percent from midrange that year. Middleton got hurt and it was just him and Jrue v the Celtics in terms of offensive creation (7 games)</p>

<p>2023 avgd 31.8 PPG but in the playoffs he fell on Kevin Love and the heat were on stupid fire from 3 that series</p>

<p>2024, got Dame, giannis averaged over 30 PPG on 60 TS, but was hurt and didn&rsquo;t play in the playoffs.</p>

<p>That all being said, his passing has also been improved over the years and doesn&rsquo;t get enough appreciation in my opinion.
He&rsquo;s averaged about 5.8 assists a game for the past 5-6 years and last year he averaged 6.5!</p>

<p>Besides Jokic, Sabonis, and LeBron, idk how many other bigs pass like that. And that&rsquo;s carrying a heavier load on defense too.</p>

<p>Long story short I think at this point moving forward, Giannis getting better isn&rsquo;t necessarily doing more, it&rsquo;s doing less but better.</p>

He scored 50 in a finals game. The Bucks didn’t perform up to expectations but that’s for a myriad of reasons many of which are more detrimental to team success than Giannis’ limited playstyle. At the end of the day the freak is a top 3 player in the league and a proven winner.</p>

      <label for="lloe9bk" class="commentText"><p>Old heads can’t have it both ways. They get on people like Embiid and Ant for taking too many jump shots, then get on people like Giannis for driving into the paint too much.</p>

<p>Giannis is at his best when driving to the rim. Would he be a better player if he shot the ball better? Absolutely. But he averaged over <sup>30</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> last year while also averaging more assists than guards like Shai, Maxey, and Murray. And that’s not even including his elite defensive ability. But somehow he needs to “get better as a basketball player”?</p>

<p>Imo podcasts have shown how bad older players are at watching basketball and understanding the game from the sidelines. They’re obviously great at playing, but there’s a reason a lot of the elite players don’t get into coaching post retirement.</p>

      <label for="llowcso" class="commentText"><p>honestly, somewhat agree with Chuck here. Giannis is going to be 30 this year and there&rsquo;s only a few years left of elite athleticism for him. But i don&rsquo;t think he necessarily needs to add a 3 to his game if it never improves&hellip;all he really needs to add is a reliable post fadeaway shot and he&rsquo;s going to be so much better. He&rsquo;s already shown that he can knock it down here and there, he&rsquo;s got insane length and will become unguardable if he gets elite with it</p>
