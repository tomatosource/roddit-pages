      <label for="llo8ugz" class="commentText"><p>I actually think it’s a fair and valid point.  It’s why he struggles in the playoffs when teams collapse the paint and he doesn’t have a lane.  Obviously he’s quite an accomplished player and has won a championship but the way the bucks struggle reminds me a lot of the Dwight Howard led magic teams.  Their offense relies on Gianni’s playing in the paint and kicking out if he’s doubled. If his teammates can’t make their shots and Gianni’s can’t drive in they’re pretty screwed.  Won’t matter in the regular season but they’ll struggle greatly in the playoffs.</p>

<p>That’s not to say he should never dunk, but adding an effective post arsenal would help him a long way.</p>

<p>Young Barkley was honestly a lot like Giannis. He led the NBA in 2 point FG percentage for like 5 years in a row while going downhill in transition and finishing at the rim a lot. Old Barkley was more of a pure post player but young Barkley was a guy who could grab a rebound, dribble it the length of the court, and dunk it on you, kinda like a shorter Giannis. </p>

<p>I never really consider Brook or KAT in my examples. Both were excellent (high 70s to 80s percent) FT shooters but just didn’t take that many long jump shots.</p>

<p>However, to your point, there are some good examples though of bad FT shooters who made huge improvements, such as Herb Jones, Al Horford, and a few others. So yes I agree there are players who do indeed improve but the average case is certainly not a lot. </p>

<p>The survivorship bias makes it seem like it’s easy to improve than reality because we forget about all those guys who don’t improve and aren’t in the league in 2-4 years so we don’t remember all the failed ones. </p>

<p>Why do people like you just talk in absolutes? No one is asking Giannis to play like Kyrie and get the ball 30 feet away from the rim. Developing a consistent jumpshot means the defense actually has to respect you which makes driving so much easier + it improves your longevity. Lebron would not be nearly as effective as he is today without the improvements he&rsquo;s made to his 3 point shot.</p>

      <label for="llnzkde" class="commentText"><p>I didn’t say that? But saying “it’s not going to work” when it has in fact been proven to work is delusional.</p>

<p>Someone posted about the most clutch players in the past whatever years recently and Giannis was on the list albeit it wasn’t as many attempts as most guys but saying he’s ineffective at the end of games just proves you don’t watch him.</p>

<p>You can easily search “giannis clutch moments” and you’ll get several highlights of both offense and defense</p>

      <label for="llo1947" class="commentText"><p>Again, like I said in my previous comment. You can see he works on this stuff, every teammate, coach and opposing player that’s spoke about him says he’s constantly working on his game.</p>

<p>But working on something doesn’t mean you’ll ever be good at it.</p>

<p>But Barkley said nothing about “it’ll eventually stop working when his athleticism declines” he’s acting like it won’t work now when it is working. The wolves were probably the team that was best equipped to slow him down last season and he still had a 33/13/5 game on 74% TS.</p>

<p>But it sounds like Giannis is working with a new trainer now, so maybe things will change.</p>

<p>but it has been like average to below average 3 out of the last 5 playoffs</p>

<p>i also don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what Barkley is saying tho, the problem is yeah in the course of the game Giannis will get 25-30 on 58ish% TS in the playoffs</p>

<p>but skill matters when you&rsquo;re trying to stop a run or close a game, and it&rsquo;s okay give me the ball in the post, give me the ball in a pnr, give me the ball in the high post, etc</p>

<p>even in 2021, it was Middleton who started the playoffs with a game winner, and ended the playoffs with that huge dagger over Booker, but in the course of those games, Giannis was doing his thing</p>

<p>2020(I’m sure is one of them your referencing) he was bad and I can’t deny that</p>

<p>2022: he was easily the best player vs the Celtics and Kd who is one of the best shooters had the same TS as Giannis. He took them to 7 when it had no business going that far</p>

<p>2023: he was hurt every game he played in</p>

<p>Not every superstar in league history is some clutch god who you can always give the ball and trust. I’m fine with saying Giannis isn’t the most clutch player but acting like he can’t make clutch players is dumb cause I’ve seen him do it several times in the playoffs.</p>

<p>I mean he was clutch against the suns, made the shot that put them ahead in OT against the nets, made a clutch 3 to tie the game late against Celtics, makes several defensive plays. Those are just some off the top of my head</p>

<p>2019 he was awful vs the raptors, obviously not as bad as Bledsoe, also that was Buds fault 50%</p>

<p>2022 he was incredible because of all the rest of his game, but i think it&rsquo;s still fair to critize the efficiency, if he&rsquo;s on the same tier as Jokic, prime Steph, KD, and all the top 30ish players all time, he has to be held to that standard</p>

<p>Up there I think is both Bosh and KLove when playing with LeBron. They both sacrificed the most when joining up and often got blame but they were so important to the chips, especially Bosh. He anchored that amazing defense and made it possible for them to play small ball with their suffocating defense and focus on transition basketball.</p>

<p>I guess it&rsquo;s a bug when playing with LeBron, he makes some roleplayers way better but stars take a bigger back seat.</p>

<p>As far as taking a backseat, Bosh and Love def did that more than the others but that isn’t surprising considering they weren’t just playing behind Bron. They were playing behind Bron/Wade and Bron/Kyrie.</p>

      <label for="llocs6g" class="commentText"><p>People here defending Giannis against Barkley&rsquo;s criticisms because he won a title shows you how casual they are, and the difference truly shows in that casual fans don&rsquo;t watch the game but Barkley does.</p>

<p>Barkley&rsquo;s criticism is correct. Giannis has too many flaws in his game so that when he runs into walls in the playoffs he becomes much less effective. That is the 1 on 5 basketball Barkley is referring to.</p>

<p>In the series against the Suns they left Ayton alone to guard Giannis 1 on 1. This is pretty well documented and various YouTube channels that focus on film and analyze that series. So of course, Giannis dominated. He didn&rsquo;t play 1 on 5, the Suns let him play 1 on 1.</p>

<p>The idea that Giannis wins a title = criticism doesn&rsquo;t apply, and the idea that the Suns had a good defensive rating = they played good defense against Giannis is literally peak casual shutdown.</p>

<p>Giannis literally continues to struggle against teams in the playoffs since his title year, unable to efficiently score against teams that build walling defenses in the paint because he lacks both a jumper and post moves.</p>

      <label for="llod0py" class="commentText"><p>Giannis is a very good player and complete player, since he is an insane scorer, a very good defender and a good playmaker/passer. With that being said, I think the one skill that Giannis should work on is post moves/footwork. He is a very good scorer but at the same time he is not a versatile scorer. We know he will never be a good shooter, but I think he can improve his post game</p>

<p>MIL already made 1 big star trade to get to this point. If anything the statement is more relevant today than if he said it 2 years ago.</p>

      <label for="llo3ygu" class="commentText"><p>Im not trying to shit on him but it’s fascinating how winning 1 championship changed the entire perception of Giannis.</p>

<p>Before 2021 people talked about how easy it was to defend him pointing to the Heat and Raptors, that the Bucks best win was against the 2019 Celtics, how his shooting (26% from 3, 61% from the line) would always limit his team.</p>

<p>The situation hasn’t changed much since then, the Bucks’ only win came against the 2022 Bulls, Giannis’ efficiency still gets worse in the playoffs but everything is alright because he was gigantic in 2021.</p>

<p>Against not trying to hate, I’m just surprised by how much his championship run affected his perception</p>

      <label for="lloavw1" class="commentText"><p>That’s how it is with any superstar. One ring for Dirk changed his entire perception. The run by kawhi in 2019 vaults him super high in all time rankings even thought he hasn’t done anything since then. All it literally takes is one historic run. Dropping 50 points in game 6 in the finals to win it all will make everyone see you differently.</p>

<p>After that Bulls series in 2022, he faced the Celtics. He was without Middleton and was incredible. Truly unstoppable and almost won that series by himself. It was a consensus that he was the best player in the world even after they lost that series. Following 2 years, it’s been injuries. So the last time we saw him healthy in the playoffs, he looked like a man possessed.</p>

<p>Also, while Chuck&rsquo;s position here is lazily-phrased, following a 5 year old narrative, there is something to it, in that I think the Bucks&rsquo; most efficient offense features less of Giannis as primary ball handler attacking from the perimeter, and more him getting the ball in the posts and attacking in the short roll of pnr as the screener&hellip;I mean, was this not the primary appeal of getting an elite scoring guard like Lillard?  The problem is it did not seem like figured out the balance, or developed a chemistry in the 2 man game.</p>
