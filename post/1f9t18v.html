His % wasn&rsquo;t great or anything last year but I remember it was better than LeBron, Butler and a few other guys. If he can get it up to 40% he&rsquo;ll be in excellent shape the next few years. Likewise if he can get the 3p% above 30.</p>

      <label for="llo8ugz" class="commentText"><p>I actually think it’s a fair and valid point.  It’s why he struggles in the playoffs when teams collapse the paint and he doesn’t have a lane.  Obviously he’s quite an accomplished player and has won a championship but the way the bucks struggle reminds me a lot of the Dwight Howard led magic teams.  Their offense relies on Gianni’s playing in the paint and kicking out if he’s doubled. If his teammates can’t make their shots and Gianni’s can’t drive in they’re pretty screwed.  Won’t matter in the regular season but they’ll struggle greatly in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="llotguq" class="commentText"><p>So you being a Chicago fan makes you more qualified? The Bulls rings are from a single successful era as the Knicks&rsquo;, higher peak and more rings but the point stands.</p>

<p>Players that rely solely on athleticism once start getting injured is a fast downward trajectory, you can see Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose, Amar&rsquo;e Stoudemire, Isaiah Thomas among others.</p>

<p>Giannis is getting older each season and he has been battling with injuries more often, that coupled with his aging core of teammates we have seen the movie already:</p>

<ul>
<li>Giannis plays phenomenal = Bucks win</li>
<li>Bucks rely on Giannis too much = Giannis gets worn down during the season and limps to the playoffs</li>
<li>Giannis plays hurt, his production is not able to be as good = Bucks are dead in the water.</li>
</ul>

<p>What Barkley and other people like me want to see Giannis to develop a finnese game to help his career to last longer, look how Embiid has been the scoring champ twice and how defenses can&rsquo;t stop him with a good jumper.</p>

      <label for="llod6hn" class="commentText"><p>Because he hasn’t had a legit second star?</p>

<p>Go look at every other superstar that was 2+ rings they all have elite second options.</p>

<p>Khris is great but he’s not a top tier second option. He’s capable of 25+ pt games and clutch shots but in between those moments he’s inconsistent as fuck.</p>

<p>If you gave him a Kyrie or dame like 3-4 years ago he could probably have atleast 2 championships.</p>

<p>You’re about to find out with Brunson that it takes far more than just a decent second option to win a title.</p>

<p>Young Barkley was honestly a lot like Giannis. He led the NBA in 2 point FG percentage for like 5 years in a row while going downhill in transition and finishing at the rim a lot. Old Barkley was more of a pure post player but young Barkley was a guy who could grab a rebound, dribble it the length of the court, and dunk it on you, kinda like a shorter Giannis. </p>

      <label for="llo0xtl" class="commentText"><p>There’s survivorship bias here. I would say the base case is only a marginal improvement. </p>

<p>I never really consider Brook or KAT in my examples. Both were excellent (high 70s to 80s percent) FT shooters but just didn’t take that many long jump shots.</p>

<p>However, to your point, there are some good examples though of bad FT shooters who made huge improvements, such as Herb Jones, Al Horford, and a few others. So yes I agree there are players who do indeed improve but the average case is certainly not a lot. </p>

<p>The survivorship bias makes it seem like it’s easy to improve than reality because we forget about all those guys who don’t improve and aren’t in the league in 2-4 years so we don’t remember all the failed ones. </p>

KAT getting better at 3&rsquo;s is really an exception, and the limitations show, when you get that confidence in the 3, you lose sight of what made you what you are.</p>

KAT had a bad shooting series against the Mavs but it was an unfortunate anomaly and they were mostly good open looks. He still shot 42% in the playoffs overall on 5 attempts a game. Frankly i’d like him to shoot 8 a game. Steph took 12 a game last year</p>

<p>His biggest issue is when he gets out of control and gets called for charges attacking the basket</p>

      <label for="llox8nm" class="commentText"><p>To be clear, I’m not suggesting the volume of Barkley is the same as Giannis in terms of initiating offense above the free throw line. </p>

<p>However, what made Barkley super unique for an 80s PF with the Sixers is he was the very first PF who really could consistently handle the ball in the open court and make decisions, which you see a lot more of today, including with Giannis. </p>

<p>Here are some young Barkley highlights I found that the NBA uploaded. This is an official upload and also has a ton of views (most of any young Barkley highlight) so I’m not cherry picking to make my point. </p>

<p><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=TKmpQyo9muU" target="_blank">https://youtube.com/watch?v=TKmpQyo9muU</a></p>

<p>I agree with you he still posted up a lot more than current Giannis and also other PFs you see today, but he definitely had a lot more to his game than just the post up. When he got older, it became pretty much all post ups though as he wasn’t as good in getting past people with his dribble. </p>

<p>Again the volume isn’t the same but there were definitely much closer similarities in 76ers Barkley play style vs Giannis than any other PF in the 80s than you might think. </p>

      <label for="lloytn2" class="commentText"><p>Oh yea old Barkley wasn’t good at taking care of his body very well so he had so many knee and back injuries he pretty much lost all his young athleticism. He still was pretty good in the post though since he still had his skill.</p>

<p>If Barkley had Karl Malone’s durability, he probably would have won in either 1994 or 1995 and been a top 12 player all time. He got injured in that 1995 series vs the Rockets when they had a 3-1 lead, and was super inefficient in game 7. </p>

<p>I’m afraid something could happen to Zion as he grows older unless he gets into shape consistently. </p>

<p>Edit: Being good back then at running the break is not what some of you seem to think. Yeah he was good at it. His bread and butter it was not. He was always an athletic freak that dominated by receiving the ball in the post and going to work, and offensive rebounding.</p>

<p>None of this to say Giannis isn&rsquo;t great. He&rsquo;s a 2x MVP and former DPOY. He&rsquo;s obviously a legend. It&rsquo;s just that the window for rings closes a lot more quickly than some  guys realize.</p>

<p>You can easily search “giannis clutch moments” and you’ll get several highlights of both offense and defense</p>

<p>Like you said, if he was a great shooter he&rsquo;d maybe be the GOAT, so this sort of criticism almost feels like it&rsquo;s implying that players should not have any weaknesses. It&rsquo;s like if someone started criticizing Shaq for not being a better shooter or Kobe for not being a great passer. Like yes of course those things are true, but LeBron may be the only player who has pretty much 0 weaknesses in their game. Charles is also missing the fact that he has improved his court vision and passing in recent years which helps prevent him from getting stuck driving into defenders </p>

<p>Why do people like you just talk in absolutes? No one is asking Giannis to play like Kyrie and get the ball 30 feet away from the rim. Developing a consistent jumpshot means the defense actually has to respect you which makes driving so much easier + it improves your longevity. Lebron would not be nearly as effective as he is today without the improvements he&rsquo;s made to his 3 point shot.</p>

<p>because his playoffs are interesting, he had the great 2021 run, but his last two playoffs, and his career overall scoring efficiency in the playoffs hasn&rsquo;t been that great</p>

<p>Yes, notorious post player, Steph Curry. A guard who bombs 11 3&rsquo;s a game, having a better TS%, says something about Giannis&rsquo; TS%, considering 60%+ of all his attempts are from 10ft or closer.</p>

<p>Try reading the post before commenting, it helps. Dude is a 28% career 3pt shooter, and a 70% FT shooter, you think those are what&rsquo;s bolstering his TS%?</p>

      <label for="lloxgo2" class="commentText"><p>I read it, it has no bearing on the topic. The whole thread is about how he needs to expand his game, and how his efficiency in the playoffs has been getting worse.</p>

<p>21-22 FT% RS vs PO : 72 vs 68</p>

<p>21-22 TS% RS vs PO : 63 vs 55</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t drop 8% TS% from 4% FT%. That&rsquo;s not how math works.</p>

<p>Now when you look at his FG% it went from 55% to 49%. You know the things that account for him &ldquo;going downhill 1-on-5&rdquo; and missing.</p>

<p>That FT% drop accounts for 0.7 FTM per game. Which is basically a rounding error.</p>

<p>His FGA? 10.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>18</sub>.6 in the RS vs 11.<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>23</sub>.8 in the PO 5+ more FGA while only making around 1 more FG a game.</p>

<p>The FT% isn&rsquo;t harming his TS% in the playoffs, these are very easy to understand stats, instead of going off your vibes and feels, look at numbers.</p>

      <label for="lloi8m1" class="commentText"><p>I totally get this take but honestly it&rsquo;s a little outdated and is only accurate in a vacuum when you&rsquo;re not taking anything else into consideration.</p>

<p>Giannis in 2019 and 2020 had to do this bc they didn&rsquo;t have enough creators. They had Eric Bledsoe at pg who couldn&rsquo;t shoot either, and only had Middleton to generate additional offense. Giannis also didn&rsquo;t trust his teammates and imo learned his &ldquo;1-5 isn&rsquo;t going to work&rdquo; lesson during this time</p>

<p>2021 they had Jrue which helped reduce the amount of 1v5 on offense. Played a ton of pnr with Khris Middleton which they hadn&rsquo;t done much prior to that.</p>

<p>2022, he shot like 40 percent from midrange that year. Middleton got hurt and it was just him and Jrue v the Celtics in terms of offensive creation (7 games)</p>

<p>2023 avgd 31.8 PPG but in the playoffs he fell on Kevin Love and the heat were on stupid fire from 3 that series</p>

<p>2024, got Dame, giannis averaged over 30 PPG on 60 TS, but was hurt and didn&rsquo;t play in the playoffs.</p>

<p>That all being said, his passing has also been improved over the years and doesn&rsquo;t get enough appreciation in my opinion.
He&rsquo;s averaged about 5.8 assists a game for the past 5-6 years and last year he averaged 6.5!</p>

<p>Besides Jokic, Sabonis, and LeBron, idk how many other bigs pass like that. And that&rsquo;s carrying a heavier load on defense too.</p>

<p>Long story short I think at this point moving forward, Giannis getting better isn&rsquo;t necessarily doing more, it&rsquo;s doing less but better.</p>

<p>He had success in 2021 because the Suns literally guarded Giannis 1 on 1. They left Ayton alone on island.</p>

<p>The criticism is that when he&rsquo;s forced to play 1 v 5, which most playoff defenses so, he struggles to be as efficient. This has continued to be the case since his championship run.</p>

      <label for="llojlv0" class="commentText"><p>Your casualness shows in your take.</p>

<p>No other player faces 3 players at the rim because they can shoot and/or they can pass to shooters.</p>

<p>Teams would implement a wall defense against every great player if they could, but their ability to shoot prevents that and spacing punishes that.</p>

<p>One such other example is how the Celtics defended Kobe who is a very solid shooter. They used wall-like pre-helping defense to prevent Kobe from getting to the basket, and could play up on his jumpshot. The reason this was effective at all was because Kobe played in the Triangle alongside 2 other bigs at all times that congested the paint who actively sat in the post positions and were not threats to spread the floor.</p>

      <label for="llooph4" class="commentText"><p>Obviously Giannis has trouble shooting but nobody is denying that.</p>

<p>First off people need to stop acting like Giannis is a playoff dropper when he almost sent the Celtics home in 6 without Khris Middleton and an offensively inept Jrue Holiday. Not to mention the 2019 and 2021 playoffs. He is only being criticized because he has not been healthy in 23&rsquo; and 24&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Giannis has grown immensely as a playmaker to punish double teams. Shooting 60% with 30ppg while being a great playmaker and defender.</p>

<p>If Giannis was as bad as a offensive player as Jokic was as a defender people would slander the man like hell. But with Jokic and Luka only one side matters to some of y&rsquo;all.</p>

<p>Giannis has not killed his teams chances because of shooting like Luka has killed his team in the finals because of his Defense. Not saying he shouldn&rsquo;t try to be better but let&rsquo;s stop the run and dunk man exaggeration he is top 4 offensively skilled big man at worst.</p>

      <label for="lloq39i" class="commentText"><p>But there is no excuse as to why Giannis can not develop a jump shot at the average NBA level or better post moves. Improving your offensive game and skillset is an expectation of like every NBA player. Blake Griffin did it. LeBron did it (and is a 4 time champion because of it), MJ developed a jump shot years into his career.</p>

<p>So yes, his offensive efficiency drops off in rather notorious and significant ways in the playoffs due to his lack of improvement. And when offense drops there is a pretty clear correlation if not direct causation to <em>losing</em> because your team depends on you to be a constant on offense if you want to compete.</p>

<p>But Jokic will always remain a mediocre defender. Luka will always remain at best a mediocre defender. Luka&rsquo;s main criticism is his bitching and whining than anything else. Turning these players into defensive studs is not realistic.</p>

<p>A player improving his offensive skills is. And Giannis still hasn&rsquo;t gotten a better jumpshot or post moves.</p>

      <label for="llorva1" class="commentText"><p>Yes you&rsquo;re right every player has their flaws and should work on those flaws. Just don&rsquo;t wanna hear Giannis is a playoff dropper when the production is still there and 99% of the league have lower efficiency in the playoffs because of highly planned out defensive sets. Barkley is acting like Giannis has a Joel embiid level of success while just running and dunking which is entirely false.</p>

      <label for="llou21k" class="commentText"><p>Can Giannis improve as a player? Sure. Does he NEED to get better? No. Giannis has proven he can win MVPs as well as a ring. He scored 50 in a finals game. The Bucks didn’t perform up to expectations but that’s for a myriad of reasons many of which are more detrimental to team success than Giannis’ limited playstyle. At the end of the day the freak is a top 3 player in the league and a proven winner.</p>

      <label for="lloe9bk" class="commentText"><p>Old heads can’t have it both ways. They get on people like Embiid and Ant for taking too many jump shots, then get on people like Giannis for driving into the paint too much.</p>

<p>Giannis is at his best when driving to the rim. Would he be a better player if he shot the ball better? Absolutely. But he averaged over <sup>30</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> last year while also averaging more assists than guards like Shai, Maxey, and Murray. And that’s not even including his elite defensive ability. But somehow he needs to “get better as a basketball player”?</p>

<p>Imo podcasts have shown how bad older players are at watching basketball and understanding the game from the sidelines. They’re obviously great at playing, but there’s a reason a lot of the elite players don’t get into coaching post retirement.</p>

But i don&rsquo;t think he necessarily needs to add a 3 to his game if it never improves&hellip;all he really needs to add is a reliable post fadeaway shot and he&rsquo;s going to be so much better. He&rsquo;s already shown that he can knock it down here and there, he&rsquo;s got insane length and will become unguardable if he gets elite with it</p>
