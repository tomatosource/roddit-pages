<p>It&rsquo;s clear that the F.O. sees it the same way as both Rob and JJ have come out for Rui.</p>

<p>Rui and Max will get a legitimate chance this year. The one they should have had last year.</p>

      <label for="lat7013" class="commentText"><p>Reaves was coming off a WCF run in his second year that he followed with a Team USA FIBA run. A run where he arguably was a top 5 most impactful player on the roster, despite coming off the bench.</p>

<p>It was obvious his &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t it&rdquo; was because he didn&rsquo;t have his legs under him while dealing with increased minutes and thats why he was struggling. It was also obvious that with Vando injured to start the season, they didn&rsquo;t have anyone else that was playing good enough to warrant benching him. Theres an argument that benching him allows to rest him up a bit but knowing that he&rsquo;s going to end up being the 3rd or 4th best player every night depending on DLO, but he&rsquo;s probably someone you give a longer leash and let them try to figure it out instead of benching.</p>

<p>Ham fucked up when his biggest changes were benching Austin and DLO and while giving a bigger run to Prince and Reddish for the first 50 games of the season.</p>

<p>I don’t hate Cam nor Prince but Ham make it sure, a big portion of our fanbase would hate them because he didn’t put them in the right position.</p>

<p>And when he was about that time to give Prince more minutes than Rui in the 1st round because Rui was garbage and Prince was outplayed him, he did the complete opposite.</p>

      <label for="latg71u" class="commentText"><p>As a general rule, defense is what keeps you on the court. If you&rsquo;re not bringing it defensively, especially under a coach who is a defensive specialist, you&rsquo;re bound to get benched. So, it&rsquo;s no surprise D&rsquo;Lo, AR, or Rui would sit in favor of better defenders. And let&rsquo;s face it, this won&rsquo;t be the last time any of these guys get benched, especially D&rsquo;Lo and Rui. AR might have a shot at redemption, though.</p>

      <label for="lati9wl" class="commentText"><p>And yet, once those guys and D&rsquo;lo were all starting together, the Lakers immediately began winning games. Before they were all starting together, the Lakers were 25-25. Once all three began starting, they went 23-10 the rest of the regular season.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s fine if you didn&rsquo;t watch the Lakers this year as they&rsquo;re not your team. But trust me, we Laker fans who watched them all year could see the difference once the same starting 5 that was in the WCF the year before were starting together again. The frustrating part is that it took until February for Ham to figure out what was obvious to even casual fans.</p>

Dlo, our 3rd best player last season, got to slump for 5 games before he was benched. Taurean Prince got to start for over 40 games. Cam Reddish got to start 33 games and was only taken out of the lineup when he got injured and not for his terrible play. He then was not good enough to bother dressing up for the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="latff4o" class="commentText"><p>The Lakers dropped four games straight with D&rsquo;Lo shooting just 31% from the field and not stepping up on defense. Benchings happen in hoops all the time—plenty of coaches would&rsquo;ve made that call. They bounced back with a win right after, so it was a needed shake-up. Plus, the playoffs kinda proved we were spinning our wheels with D&rsquo;Lo anyway. Considering that, benching him was justified, and in hindsight, trading him would&rsquo;ve been the wiser move.</p>

<p>B.) He has to know he&rsquo;s going to be dangled in trade deals til the deadline.  He simply isn&rsquo;t good / consistent enough for a team that wants to contend, and he&rsquo;s the Lakers&rsquo; biggest movable contract.  As such, by choosing to opt in, he&rsquo;s basically lost control of where he gets to play next season.</p>

<p>His market was bad, it&rsquo;s really that simple.</p>

      <label for="lasrzo0" class="commentText"><p>I mean&hellip; that might be it, but at the same time he <em>has</em> to know that the Lakers are absolutely going to start trying to package him in trades for upgrades to the team.  If he&rsquo;d wanted to stay in LA, I think he would&rsquo;ve just opted out after agreeing another extension (like another 1+1 maybe, or more years if he wanted to be w/ them long term) with the Lakers.  With this option, he&rsquo;s given up control on where he actually plays next season.</p>

<p>Maybe he has a handshake deal w/ the Lakers that they won&rsquo;t trade him, IDK.  But to me this says the value for him wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>

<p>Dlo was literally just on the market 1 year ago. And his market at that time was a 1+1. This is all he’s worth now. He wouldn’t get 4/$80-100m on the open market. Teams just know what he is now</p>

<p>Also, he loves LA. But he knows opting in would basically guarantee his trade</p>

      <label for="lat1rrp" class="commentText"><p>That’s because of cap holds that they haven’t officially relinquished, like Fultz at 29m, Gary Harris at 20m, Okeke at 15m. Go look at projected cap (where Spotrac guess who they relinquish/option/guarantee) and maximum cap (where Margic relinquishes everyone and don’t pick up any team options / guarantees) for the real number.</p>

He&rsquo;s the ultimate tank commander, so a month into the season when 8 teams realize theyre fucked, they can send whatever decent players they have to L.A. and just play DLo 38 minutes a night.  28/3/2 on 35 shots with 4.2 turnovers per game will def get you Colton Flagg and Dylan Cooper or whoever.</p>

While this guy started a podcast and coached his son&rsquo;s 4th grade team over the summer last year and got handed a high profile head coaching job.</p>
