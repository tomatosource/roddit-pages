      <p>I get it that he didn&rsquo;t reach the elite all-star level in basketball and never became a household name like Bo or Deion. But it&rsquo;s remarkable that he won the Heisman and then had a 10 year career in the NBA! I feel like he deserves a lot more respect</p>

      <label for="llnbt2v" class="commentText"><p>You answered your question with your first sentence to be honest</p>

<ul>
<li>Deion was an all-time great player in football and a useful if flawed baseball player and played both at the same time. He also was huge star and played for notable teams (94 Niners, 90s Cowboys, in the World Series)</li>
<li>Bo was a great running back and a raw but skilled baseball player (even made an all-star game and was improving as a hitter), again playing both at the same time, plus he was a HUGE cultural phenomenon with his own slogan and video game.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ward&rsquo;s accomplishments are really great but he never played pro football at all (let alone at the same time as the NBA), was a &ldquo;just&rdquo; a decent role player in the NBA, and wasn&rsquo;t a big deal culturally either - to get more attention he would have needed to play in the NFL or been a better player in the NBA.</p>

<p>Was he all that raw when he went to the Royals organization? They didn’t keep him in the minors that long.</p>

<p>He was a slugger, fleet footed, and an amazing outfielder. He pitched when he was in high school.</p>

<p>and Ward just wasn&rsquo;t known for being as fast, powerful, or as agile as as Jackson and Sanders.</p>

<p>Edit:  I realize now that this comment is missing a ton of context.</p>

<p>Jackson and Sanders were also star caliber players at the highest level in two sports whereas Ward never played pro football and was a role player in the NBA.  So it wasn&rsquo;t just that Ward wasn&rsquo;t as fast, powerful, or agile.  He also just wasn&rsquo;t nearly as good at their respective sports.</p>

      <label for="llnehgx" class="commentText"><p>At his peak Charlie Ward was a fringe starting level PG in the NBA.   He wasn&rsquo;t a guy you wanted in that role long term, but if you had a really good team around him and were looking to cut salary at a position, he could be that guy.  In reality, best off as a backup.  He kinda had that Monte Morris feel to him but not as adept a scorer.     That was Ward&rsquo;s peak as a professional athlete.   10 year career, rotational guy who&rsquo;s peak was lower end starter.  That&rsquo;s his only sport he competed in professionally too.</p>

<p>Bo Jackson was a guy who could supplant HOFer Marcus Allen in the lineup when he showed up after the baseball season.</p>

<p>Deion Sanders was a legit HOFer and one of the best cover corners in NFL history.</p>

<p>I truly don&rsquo;t watch much baseball, but Bo was an all-star baseball player who could hit with power and run.  Deion could flat out fly and was good enough to be by far the best offensive player for the Braves in their world series (led the team in hits, runs, batting average, stolen bases, and extra base hits.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got to say I can&rsquo;t see a situation where Ward is the best player on a team in any playoff series, much less an NBA finals.  I think those two had higher peaks in their lesser sports than Ward did in his only one professionally.</p>

      <label for="llnbcu1" class="commentText"><p>Well Bo and Deion played two sports professionally. Ward only played one. Plus Ward was just a solid Point guard. Deion is one of the best football players ever, Bo wasn’t but he was uniquely exciting</p>

      <label for="llnevg3" class="commentText"><p>Bo had potential if his hip didn&rsquo;t spontaneously combust against the Bengals because he was too strong for his tendons and he made things worse by <em>popping his hip back into the socket.</em></p>

<p>And he made Brian Bosworth look like Lattimer off the gear. And he ran up the wall in Bodymore Avon took note. Vincent MF Bo MF Jackson was so good at the decathlon in high school that he never ran the metric mile.</p>

<p>Goddam it I love Bo Jackson just as much as I hate Kelly Olynyk which is to say <em>a lot</em>. Every lie told about Bo anywhere at any time is true. Even the Gameboy game.</p>
