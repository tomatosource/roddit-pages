      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1f9pvxy/people_rightly_mention_bo_jackson_and_deion/"><p>People rightly mention Bo Jackson and Deion Sanders as some of the best athletes of all time. But why doesn&rsquo;t Charlie Ward get mentioned more?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I get it that he didn&rsquo;t reach the elite all-star level in basketball and never became a household name like Bo or Deion. But it&rsquo;s remarkable that he won the Heisman and then had a 10 year career in the NBA! I feel like he deserves a lot more respect</p>

      <label for="llnbt2v" class="commentText"><p>You answered your question with your first sentence to be honest</p>

<ul>
<li>Deion was an all-time great player in football and a useful if flawed baseball player and played both at the same time. He also was huge star and played for notable teams (94 Niners, 90s Cowboys, in the World Series)</li>
<li>Bo was a great running back and a raw but skilled baseball player (even made an all-star game and was improving as a hitter), again playing both at the same time, plus he was a HUGE cultural phenomenon with his own slogan and video game.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ward&rsquo;s accomplishments are really great but he never played pro football at all (let alone at the same time as the NBA), was a &ldquo;just&rdquo; a decent role player in the NBA, and wasn&rsquo;t a big deal culturally either - to get more attention he would have needed to play in the NFL or been a better player in the NBA.</p>

<p>He also made the Winter Olympics in bobsled and finished like 7th, despite learning that sport for only a short while. </p>

<p>Again, he’s not super well liked but he was a better RB than Bo Jackson when you factor in total career (not peak), and no one really mentions him. </p>

<p>On the 1992 Braves that went to the World Series, he was 10th on the team in plate appearances, just 3 fewer than the backup catcher, and 10 more than the starting shortstop.  He was 7th in total hits.  He was first in OPS+.</p>

<p>He started the last four games of the 1992 World Series and slashed .533/.588/.667.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not an NBA 8th-9th man.  That&rsquo;s a 6th man who starts when needed.</p>

      <label for="llo4cxi" class="commentText"><p>In his first 3 years he wasn&rsquo;t good, but then he had a legitimately good year as a hitter, followed it up with 3 slightly above average years as a hitter, then quit baseball, then came back for one year in which he was a bad starter/good bench player, then quit again, then came back for a few games at age 33 and was bad.</p>

<p>3 years as a bad rookie/young player, 1 year as a good starter, 3 years as an ok starter, then 1 season as an ok bench player. He&rsquo;s basically a MLB version of Dana Barros with shorter periods of mediocrity, and I don&rsquo;t think its fair to summarize condensed Dana Barros as a 8th-9th man.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s not even considering the fact that he was an above-average fielder for most of his career, even when he wasn&rsquo;t also batting well.</p>

If he hypothetically wins that WS MVP, his overall career would be talked about even more. Right now not many talk about his baseball career because like you said, it wasn’t as good as Bo’s baseball career. </p>

Mind you, he was still an effective hitter but as he got more experience he became a better one - drawing more walks, making more contact, etc. But yeah, his athleticism and instincts were incredible and you have to wonder what he could have been had he not played football/not gotten injured - his injury is easily one of the most devastating things to happen to me as a sports fan.</p>

The guy doesn&rsquo;t have a single NBA accolade on his <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wardch01.html" target="_blank">BBRef</a> page, but quietly put up 6.5/3/4 over ten years as Knick (shooting 38% from 3 in four of those seasons), and is still the NBA record holder for playoff <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/stl_pct_career_p.html" target="_blank">steal percent</a> (and was top 3 in the league twice) AND <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/dbpm_career_p.html" target="_blank">playoff defensive BPM</a> (including leading the regular season in &lsquo;97-98, and three other top 10 finishes). Charlie Ward was legit, albeit in a slightly boring way, and definitely deserves more respect.</p>

<p>and Ward just wasn&rsquo;t known for being as fast, powerful, or as agile as as Jackson and Sanders.</p>

<p>Edit:  I realize now that this comment is missing a ton of context.</p>

<p>Jackson and Sanders were also star caliber players at the highest level in two sports whereas Ward never played pro football and was a role player in the NBA.  So it wasn&rsquo;t just that Ward wasn&rsquo;t as fast, powerful, or agile.  He also just wasn&rsquo;t nearly as good at their respective sports.</p>

      <label for="llnehgx" class="commentText"><p>At his peak Charlie Ward was a fringe starting level PG in the NBA.   He wasn&rsquo;t a guy you wanted in that role long term, but if you had a really good team around him and were looking to cut salary at a position, he could be that guy.  In reality, best off as a backup.  He kinda had that Monte Morris feel to him but not as adept a scorer.     That was Ward&rsquo;s peak as a professional athlete.   10 year career, rotational guy who&rsquo;s peak was lower end starter.  That&rsquo;s his only sport he competed in professionally too.</p>

<p>Bo Jackson was a guy who could supplant HOFer Marcus Allen in the lineup when he showed up after the baseball season.</p>

<p>Deion Sanders was a legit HOFer and one of the best cover corners in NFL history.</p>

<p>I truly don&rsquo;t watch much baseball, but Bo was an all-star baseball player who could hit with power and run.  Deion could flat out fly and was good enough to be by far the best offensive player for the Braves in their world series (led the team in hits, runs, batting average, stolen bases, and extra base hits.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got to say I can&rsquo;t see a situation where Ward is the best player on a team in any playoff series, much less an NBA finals.  I think those two had higher peaks in their lesser sports than Ward did in his only one professionally.</p>

      <label for="llnukjy" class="commentText"><p>I was listening to some ESPN rankings of the top athletes around the world of the 21st century so far.  And they were comparing it to other &ldquo;top athlete&rdquo; ones, the best of the 20th century and another one done in 1960 or something.</p>

<p>And I think it was Pujols who was the top baseball player and down in 28th position or something.   When they looked at the one from 1960 baseball players were like 7 of the top 10, and by the end of the decade, it might have had 3&hellip;</p>

<p>I forget the exact numbers, but it was showing how baseball is dropping in popularity.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think if Deion goes to coach NCAA baseball he makes a difference.  I&rsquo;m just looking down a list of NCAA baseball coaches.  Tim Corbin, Brian O&rsquo;Connor, Danny Hall, etc etc.. I can&rsquo;t pick one of them out.  But Saban, Harbaugh, Kelly, Smart, Swinney, Riley, Sarkisian, Kiffin, Heupel, Stoops&hellip; And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just because I&rsquo;m not a big baseball fan.</p>

      <label for="llnvnmd" class="commentText"><p>Surprised that Jackie Robinson doesn’t get mentioned more in these conversations.</p>

<p>Outside of his well-known accomplishments in baseball, he also played pro basketball, and was regarded as the best player on the UCLA squad (granted this was pre-Wooden era).</p>

<p>He was a very accomplished football player. He’s remembered for having a silly 12+ yard per carry average over a season at UCLA (albeit with limited carries). But he was also a two-way QB and Safety when he played JuCo ball.</p>

<p>Oh, and he won the fricking NCAA long jump title.</p>

<p>This is all before you consider his accomplishments on the diamond. Even if we ignore his immense cultural impact, he was a great ball player. Modern stats show that his value might have actually been under appreciated. He’s an all time great second baseman.</p>

<p>Shout out to Dick Groat. 2-time all American hoopster at Duke who had a limited pro career because he was forced to commit to baseball (ironically by Branch Rickey). Was an MVP and HOFer in baseball, and could have been All-Star in bball.</p>

      <label for="llo2ve9" class="commentText"><p>This isn’t that crazy of an answer. It will be dismissed because Ohtani only plays one sport, but consider the fact that more people have simultaneously played in the MLB and NBA than have pitched and hit full-time in the last 100 years. They’re basically two different sports.</p>

<p>I also think that if Ohtani was born in the US, he would have been an incredible QB. He’s basically got the same frame as Josh Allen. We know he has a canon. We know he has speed. And we know that he is ruthlessly committed to his craft.</p>

      <label for="llnlxye" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s <strong>remarkable</strong>, like to a crazy extent, but I agree that his achievements don&rsquo;t really rank with people who had elite professional careers. His amazing athleticism also wasn&rsquo;t as jaw-droppingly apparent as Bo&rsquo;s and Deion&rsquo;s as a professional athlete, which I think is a factor. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still amazing to consider his accomplishments. </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anyone else in modern times who could have done what he did, as having a good career in the NBA is extremely hard, and winning the Heisman is basically impossible.  </p>

<p>Just as a starting point, how many Heisman winners were 4-star+ basketball recruits? I assume it&rsquo;s none.  </p>

<p>More remotely, how many NBA players were 3- star+ QB prospects? Even then you would still be looking at an infinitely low chance of winning the Heisman, <em>and</em> a harder road to successfully transitioning to the NBA. At receiver it&rsquo;s even less probable. </p>

I go to the first bball game of the year like a month later (D1 mid major) and noticed he was the 12th man on the bench.</p>

      <label for="lloafsi" class="commentText"><p>Exactly. And then you have the next level of talent. I played against a guy who was the #1 football recruit in the country. He was a RB, so I didn’t share the field with him much, but I got a front row seat. It just didn’t seem fair lol. It’s like he turned down the difficulty of real life football. I think he averaged over 13 yards a carry for his HS career. And even that guy didn’t become a major star at the collegiate level. He was decent, and played a couple forgettable years in the NFL. So when we think about GOATs, it becomes really hard to even conceive of that level of dominance.</p>

      <label for="llnm0xx" class="commentText"><p>Yes, he would have been drafted as a QB on day 3 by multiple teams back in the 94(?) NFL draft if he had comitted to only Basketball (including KC)</p>

<p>And that was in the early 90s in a time where the idea of a Black QB that wasn&rsquo;t a pure runner was still not a possible thought for multiple decision makers in the NFL or NCAA (including his own coach Bowden originally)</p>

<p>If he had his Heisman season in the 2020s he&rsquo;d have been a first rounder in the following draft. Even with the limited sample.</p>

<p>But tbh he might have never made it that far because he&rsquo;d have been drafted as an undergrad in the NBA</p>

      <label for="llnv71s" class="commentText"><p>I will say he deserves more respect because the average person knows about Deion and Bo, but I bet you the average person doesn’t know about Ward and his accomplishments. At least it doesn’t come to mind easily as with the other two and anyone below the age of…25?…definitely doesn’t know of Ward like with the others. He didn’t perform at the highest of both sports at the same time but his accomplishments in both sports are above many.</p>

<p>And he made Brian Bosworth look like Lattimer off the gear. And he ran up the wall in Bodymore Avon took note. Vincent MF Bo MF Jackson was so good at the decathlon in high school that he never ran the metric mile.</p>

<p>Goddam it I love Bo Jackson just as much as I hate Kelly Olynyk which is to say <em>a lot</em>. Every lie told about Bo anywhere at any time is true. Even the Gameboy game.</p>

      <label for="llq41n1" class="commentText"><p>FSU fan here (yeah we are ass this year) Ward is the second best QB to play there but at the time he more than likely would have been asked to convert to another position in the NFL.     I could have seen him being a late first or second rounder in todays NFL</p>

<p>Good PG at FSU and a descent player in the NBA.<br>
Someone made a great point about his personality    Great guy but very low key.   That and the fact he was not a great professional player in football or basketball is why he is not compared to the other two</p>

      <label for="llnfl3o" class="commentText"><p>Generally speaking if you’re a professional athlete you’re already in the top level of what it means to be athletic. Those guys were also skilled and coordinated enough to play and be decent at 2 professional sports. Never even heard of Charlie Ward.</p>

      <label for="llnhsm5" class="commentText"><p>Ward was a role player in the NBA who had a great college football career but never played in the NFL.  You&rsquo;re comparing him to people who were able to play two professional sports at the highest level at the same time and were stars in at least one of them.  Those are very different levels of accomplishment.</p>
