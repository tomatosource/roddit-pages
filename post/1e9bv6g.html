<p>You can&rsquo;t renegotiate like that without it being tampering, and you can&rsquo;t expose yourself to being outbid by letting him become an RFA prematurely.</p>

<p>Boozer and/or his agent finessed the Cavs out of a year of bargain play.</p>

John Wall got three but unlike Wall he made the Cavs so good that they just never got another shot at a high tier pick until he left. It’s insane how much of a difference he made for them from worst to playoff caliber team and then the moment he leaves back to being the worst.</p>

<p>the guy i&rsquo;m thinking about is Lamar Odom. a guy with that length and that skillset, he should have been a perennial All-Star and made some All-NBA teams. if he had KG&rsquo;s heart/motor he&rsquo;d have been a MONSTER. dude was 6MOTY and won 2 chips as a key contributor and you STILL feel like he left a lot of meat on the bone</p>

<p>back then if you pump faked a 3 and the defender flew by you&rsquo;d take a dribble into the mid range for an uncontested jumper just because it was closer</p>

<p>all of his shots were like that, SO many from just inside the 3 pt line</p>

<p>if he just took only 3s and went to the rack he&rsquo;d be a monster in the modern game</p>

<p>remember also he was what they called a &ldquo;tweener&rdquo; back then, meaning he wasn&rsquo;t really big enough for what was still Shaq-era gigantic bigs that could push him around a bit, but he&rsquo;s plenty big to play the 5 every night nowadays</p>

<p>he&rsquo;s always been my pick for best translation to the modern style, he would be top 3 MVP choice every year</p>

<p>Guys drafted on poor teams just lose so much ground in the best player conversations.

</blockquote>

<p>Both of them last made an all-star game in their 18th season. Duncan only played one season after that while KG played 3, so that lines up what you said. Neither has a longevity argument over the other as they ended up washed at the exact same amount of seasons into their career.</p>

They were legends of the game who were closer to 40 than 30 at that point. I think they aged gracefully into their retirements, I use “washed” for players who look like former versions of themselves but should theoretically still have a couple years left in the tank</p>

      <label for="lee2z4x" class="commentText"><p>KG&rsquo;s career also started two years before Duncan&rsquo;s, so you&rsquo;re not really comparing apples to apples. Both players made their final all-star team in their 18th season and Duncan only played one more season after that while KG played 3 more, so your longevity argument completely falls apart.</p>

      <label for="leeaksf" class="commentText"><p>Duncan making a reputation 3rd team all nba at 38 isn&rsquo;t exactly a definitive conclusion on their longevity. Kawhi could have just as easily made that spot. KG had a couple more top 10ish kind of years after the 09 injury, and he&rsquo;d been an mvp level player for like a decade straight before that</p>

<p>He was pretty much already the best or second best PF of all time. Not much he could have “improved” on there as I don’t see him catching the T1 (Jordan/bron) guys or t2 guys (bird) either way.</p>

<p>Maybe the order shifts between him, Duncan, Kobe, Hakeem, ect but the tier doesn’t change. He’s already high up</p>

He never got a full season post Sacramento, and we never got to see him advertise his potential.</p>

<p>I watched a game live in NOLA where the Pels were down to the Pistons most of the game and Cousins just took over and was an unstoppable force.  Plus,  at times,  he was the best 3pt shooter on the team.</p>

It&rsquo;s the year he got viral meningitis and Malone got fired soon after. He had just played for Team USA and came into that year in amazing shape. He was playing dominant on both ends with a pretty mediocre team. I think the starting lineup was Darren Collison, Ben McLemore, Rudy Gay and Jason Thompson alongside Cousins. He was playing at an MVP level until the freak illness.</p>

Its been stated the Coach didnt like him/want him but the Kings wanted him he wanted Monroe i think&hellip;<br>
Cousins deserves 0% blame in that org.<br>
A young kid who bad habits received the key to the city with no guide in sight + a coach who didnt want him.</p>

<p>Years later they draft Willey C.Stein&hellip; the Kings have  always been awful, their culuture was shit and their org was shit.  Even when they finally had a good coach they fired him(Malone).</p>

<p>Cousins and Tyreke could have been wayyy better&hellip;.. yet they still made their mark in the Nba.</p>

      <label for="lef8rpq" class="commentText"><p>Cousins is always my answer for &ldquo;most over-rated player&rdquo;. He was a perennial loser who shot 45% from the field as a 6&rsquo;10 big man because he was taking fade away jumpers half the time. He also turned the ball over like crazy, had an awful attitude, and often failed to get back on defense. His defense was also poor. He played on a shit team and put up stats because he got all the touches. Realistically he was a 3rd option at best in his prime. He never even made it to the playoffs. If he was worth a damn, he at least could have dragged them to an 8 seed. But nope, just kept putting up stats while losing every game.</p>

<p>For some reason, Demarcus Cousins and Andrew Wiggins revisionism always bugs me. Both players who tanked their organizations far worse than a simple bust like Anthony Bennett would have. Just showed enough to clog up the cap and hurt the organization for years with false promise and toxic behaviour. Wiggins wasn&rsquo;t an outright asshole and sociopath like Cousins, he was just lazy, but the effect was similar.</p>

<p>Nah - Rockets were about to win a half dozen titles with Hakeem and Sampson.  It&rsquo;s neither Hakeem nor the org&rsquo;s fault that Sampson was taken down by injuries at 25 years old.  After that they were stuck in purgatory for a few years which made it ridiculously hard to build a contender, but they eventually did.</p>

<p>But they kind of dropped the bag after it, where the GM was taking shots at Hakeem and suspended him for faking injuries and not giving him an extension because they wanted to sell the team, to the point where Hakeem had to demand a trade.</p>

<p>A team with a player of Hakeem&rsquo;s level should always be looking to get better and compete, but the Rockets were more focused on selling the team.</p>

      <label for="ledolz6" class="commentText"><p>LeBron was playing at an MVP level in 2008, 2009, and 2010 but the Cavs didn&rsquo;t really have a very good shot at winning, at best they could have made the final.</p>

<p>KG/Duncan comparisons would have been much more closer, and may have gone in the opposite direction, but instead we have Duncan being the consensus greatest PF.</p>

<p>There is a reason KG won DPOY in 2008. Some of that had to do with coaching, but KG was more willing to put extra effort on defense, compared to his last few years in Minnesota, because having a chance at competing just makes the players willing to put in more effort.</p>

<p>Rockets were not focused on competing in the early 90&rsquo;s. They didn&rsquo;t even want to give Hakeem an extension because that would make it difficult to sell the team.</p>

<p>Most of these players, that do not start as good passers, become better at passing when they are in a winning environment and have teammates they trust. Hakeem talks about this in interviews where he was not comfortable throwing passes early on because he didn&rsquo;t trust his teammates.</p>

      <label for="ledtehm" class="commentText"><p>To play the devil&rsquo;s advocate, I could also see a scenario in which Carmelo ends up in Larry Brown&rsquo;s doghouse early on account of being a teenager struggling to adjust to &ldquo;playing the right way&rdquo;. In 2004 especially, I could see Brown rolling with Tayshaun Prince over Melo simply because Prince provided all the things Brown was looking for (defensive effort, defensive ability, the willingness to play a specific role for the greater good).</p>

<p>Brown could have then been like, &ldquo;Well, Carmelo&rsquo;s 19 years old and he&rsquo;s gotta learn to play the right way.&rdquo; And he&rsquo;d probably be right in his assessment.</p>

<p>From there, it&rsquo;d be a matter of whether Anthony would have swallowed his pride and fully assimilated to being a piece of the puzzle, or whether he would have just bided his time in Detroit until his rookie contract expired before taking off to find a team with which he could be the focal point, like Tracy McGrady when he left for Orlando.</p>

<p>Sometimes I think we overestimate how pliable young players might be, especially when the way they&rsquo;ve played up to that point has already been so rewarding (in Anthony&rsquo;s case, yielding an NCAA championship and top-3 pick).</p>

<p>In the playoffs, they were never swept, never went less than 6 games, and only lost to one seeds (outside of LeBron-led teams). He was also never carried to a playoff win off a bad game. All Star/NBA performances were required from him for Washington to win.</p>

<p>Otto was mostly solid and was probably more consistent, game to game. Wall excelled as that looming free safety, though I do believe that his gambling was unwarranted at times. Overall, the team badly needed a defensive ace to go along with the much needed structure they lost by 2016.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t disagree that some of his Blazers teams were questionable but you have to be absolutely transcendend to win as a small guard and he is just not on the level of the other superstars who won during his time. Even Jokic and Giannis don&rsquo;t have multiple championships yet.</p>

He was never a top 5 player in the league, despite his insane shooting. Look at Harden, or Russ, or PG, these are all players around his talent level (imo all 3 better but let’s say around), who also haven’t won.</p>

      <label for="ledqduw" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m going to say, as a huge fan of the lob city clippers, that although they both had pretty good primes, both Chris Paul and Blake Griffin were top 5 players in their best seasons. Although they were a great fit next to each other, with the benefit of hindsight, they really only had 1 opportunity to win. DeAndre Jordan was the 3rd best player, and by the numbers he was a good fit, but he was actually terrible at basketball. Even his strengths were totally nullified against good teams like the thunder and spurs. The clippers never really got a starting caliber small forward until after lob city era, with Matt Barnes, luc mbah a moute, and Jeff green being the best they could ever manage for the entire lob city prime. JJ redick and Jamal Crawford were great fits on offense but we really didn&rsquo;t have anyone other than cp3 who could play defense at a reasonably high level at any point. I mean for God&rsquo;s sake at time we had to put cp3 on kd because at 6&rsquo;0 he did a better job slowing kd down than anyone else could manage. Also as time has passed we&rsquo;ve realized that doc is only a good coach if making the playoffs is the goal for the season, not a championship. And lastly, they were both just injury prone superstars.</p>

<p>Imo, those 2 were good enough of a duo to win a championship, my contention is they were both top 5 talents in the 2013-2016 period, although probably both in the 3-6 range. With better management and team building, a couple better trades on their frps, a legitimate 3rd option and/or wing defender, and partnerships with stars who were less injury prone would have lent each of them more than 1 legitimate chance at a title run right before the warriors/cavs era.</p>

<p>Bonus, Chris Paul in New Orleans was a waste of his time. David West was solid, but I don&rsquo;t think anyone can blame cp3 for not making wcf with those teams</p>

      <label for="leegi0k" class="commentText"><p>Jeremy Lin tbh. The Nets were the first team to truly believe in him and gave him the keys to the franchise. It was amazing for a bit, then he got injured. During his injury, the Nets went 1-27. When he got back, they closed out the season 11-13. He was a HUGE difference maker. Then next season he had a career ending injury (his confidence was completely shot when he got back).</p>

<p>His one year on the Hornets also created their winningest season in years; didn&rsquo;t surprise me at all that they went back to not making the playoffs when they chose to invest in Batum instead of Lin. (And don&rsquo;t get me wrong; I love Batum, but Lin was the reason they had a turnaround season imo)</p>

He was never in a stable situation, never was in an environment that would encourage him to focus on basketball,  and when he finally could have had an opportunity in Memphis or somewhere he was hurt.</p>

      <label for="ledxnly" class="commentText"><p>Ben Simmons to any team that didn’t coddle him</p>

<p>People on this sub forget that he was not just a generational talent out of high school… he was crowned as “the next Lebron”. Lebron himself said that he had the potential to be a greater player.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, he entered the league with a rockstar mindset and the process Sixers were not built with a drill sergeant at any level in the org to make him focus. The first time it ever happened was when Brett Brown wanted Jimmy Butler to have the ball in his hands more, and Ben allegedly was a brat about it and contributed to Butler walking and the org signing Harris with their pants around their ankles</p>

<p>He then clearly had issues with Embiid becoming the clear #1 rather than it being a 1a/1b and started to focus solely on being an elite defender so he could get DPOY to the point that he lost his touch and ability to finish at the rim and even his natural ability to playmake. He went from a generational passing talent to sprinting to the free throw line, jumping 180, and chucking the ball out to the perimeter and then just standing in the dunker.</p>

<p>Then compound it with his body taking a toll and it all came crashing down. He used to post up and bully guys for easy baby hooks, but one time he got pissed off and drove his shoulder into a guy’s chest and tore something in his clavicle. He was terrified to ever post up again… until about a year later he got pissed and did the same exact thing, reinjuring the same shoulder. After that, he stopped posting up and driving to the basket almost entirely. Then the Hawks series happened and the rest is history with his back injuries.</p>

<p>Would a different organization or coach have changed his body being injury prone? No, but his selfishness for stardom was 100% coddled by Brett Brown and ownership and it fed into him doing nothing substantial to improve his offensive game. He practiced 3s on camera but his inability to improve his form or actually shoot them in game proves that it was solely for appearances</p>

He was one of few bright spots in an organization that somehow managed to make it to the finals twice. if he had gone to say, Utah or Seattle or Pheonix I think one of those teams could have stolen one from MJ&rsquo;s first 3 peat.  Obv he wound up in Houston with Hakeem later on but in my head he&rsquo;s chasing at least #2 by 95.</p>

      <label for="leeegtn" class="commentText"><p>A lot of people saying LeBron. But those years in Cleveland were pretty formidable. Yes, he had to carry heavily, but that forced him to expand his passing and outside shooting game. True, he could have had more titles or accolades. There is a good chance he would have aged his game just as well. But those years in Cleveland forced him to be more creative in how he spaced the floor. Maybe I’m wrong though, I was like 10 when he was drafted.</p>

<p>However, I was ahead of my time and got a piece published in the local news paper comparing stats between him and MJ in the 4th grade. So I got that going for me. Bitch ass teacher gave me a B- so I wanted to make her feel bad and sent it to newspapers until someone published it then brought the paper in and told her I don’t need her lessons. I was a petty 10 year old.</p>

<p>Toronto was too new of a franchise and had no idea how to manage a winning basketball team. Vince&rsquo;s popularity and brand recognition was so good that just having him was a big win for the franchise and there was little pressure to actually be a good basketball team. Vince eventually became the problem himself but he was being wasted at the same time.</p>
