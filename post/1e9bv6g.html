<p>the guy i&rsquo;m thinking about is Lamar Odom. a guy with that length and that skillset, he should have been a perennial All-Star and made some All-NBA teams. if he had KG&rsquo;s heart/motor he&rsquo;d have been a MONSTER. dude was 6MOTY and won 2 chips as a key contributor and you STILL feel like he left a lot of meat on the bone</p>

<p>back then if you pump faked a 3 and the defender flew by you&rsquo;d take a dribble into the mid range for an uncontested jumper just because it was closer</p>

<p>all of his shots were like that, SO many from just inside the 3 pt line</p>

<p>if he just took only 3s and went to the rack he&rsquo;d be a monster in the modern game</p>

<p>remember also he was what they called a &ldquo;tweener&rdquo; back then, meaning he wasn&rsquo;t really big enough for what was still Shaq-era gigantic bigs that could push him around a bit, but he&rsquo;s plenty big to play the 5 every night nowadays</p>

<p>he&rsquo;s always been my pick for best translation to the modern style, he would be top 3 MVP choice every year</p>

      <label for="leef9ym" class="commentText"><p>You are clearly forgetting that KG’s contract caused it so that no other player could have a contract as large as his, and when Steph Marbury was offered the next highest contract, he bolted, causing the Wolves to give that contract Terrell Brandon in a sign and trade (which they could’ve gotten Sam Cassell instead).</p>

<p>It’s not that Timberwolves weren’t a destination for free agency, it’s that without trading Terrell Brandon away, they had absolutely no cap room to sign a significant free agent.</p>

<p>So, no, it wasn’t about the market at all.</p>

<ol>
<li>KG’s contract caused a lockout</li>
<li>The organization fumbled every opportunity they had after that to make things better, until summer 2003.<br>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Like seriously, the list goes on and on from not getting Cassell to the secret Joe Smith deal which cost draft picks, to wasting those draft picks when they did have them, to letting Chauncey Billups go because the owner didn’t want to pay him and TB if Chauncey was going to be the starter.</p>

<p>There’s also KG pissing off Tom Gugliotta and Rasho Nesterovic so bad that they left.</p>

<p>Guys drafted on poor teams just lose so much ground in the best player conversations.

</blockquote>

<p>Both of them last made an all-star game in their 18th season. Duncan only played one season after that while KG played 3, so that lines up what you said. Neither has a longevity argument over the other as they ended up washed at the exact same amount of seasons into their career.</p>

They were legends of the game who were closer to 40 than 30 at that point. I think they aged gracefully into their retirements, I use “washed” for players who look like former versions of themselves but should theoretically still have a couple years left in the tank</p>

      <label for="lee2z4x" class="commentText"><p>KG&rsquo;s career also started two years before Duncan&rsquo;s, so you&rsquo;re not really comparing apples to apples. Both players made their final all-star team in their 18th season and Duncan only played one more season after that while KG played 3 more, so your longevity argument completely falls apart.</p>

<p>Well it&rsquo;s a good thing that literally no one has made that argument except you then. Good job with the strawman. Both players stopped being reliable contributors after 18 seasons. Neither has a longevity argument over the other.</p>

<p>He was pretty much already the best or second best PF of all time. Not much he could have “improved” on there as I don’t see him catching the T1 (Jordan/bron) guys or t2 guys (bird) either way.</p>

<p>Maybe the order shifts between him, Duncan, Kobe, Hakeem, ect but the tier doesn’t change. He’s already high up</p>

<p>Nah - Rockets were about to win a half dozen titles with Hakeem and Sampson.  It&rsquo;s neither Hakeem nor the org&rsquo;s fault that Sampson was taken down by injuries at 25 years old.  After that they were stuck in purgatory for a few years which made it ridiculously hard to build a contender, but they eventually did.</p>

<p>But they kind of dropped the bag after it, where the GM was taking shots at Hakeem and suspended him for faking injuries and not giving him an extension because they wanted to sell the team, to the point where Hakeem had to demand a trade.</p>

<p>A team with a player of Hakeem&rsquo;s level should always be looking to get better and compete, but the Rockets were more focused on selling the team.</p>

<p>KG/Duncan comparisons would have been much more closer, and may have gone in the opposite direction, but instead we have Duncan being the consensus greatest PF.</p>

<p>There is a reason KG won DPOY in 2008. Some of that had to do with coaching, but KG was more willing to put extra effort on defense, compared to his last few years in Minnesota, because having a chance at competing just makes the players willing to put in more effort.</p>

<p>Rockets were not focused on competing in the early 90&rsquo;s. They didn&rsquo;t even want to give Hakeem an extension because that would make it difficult to sell the team.</p>

<p>Most of these players, that do not start as good passers, become better at passing when they are in a winning environment and have teammates they trust. Hakeem talks about this in interviews where he was not comfortable throwing passes early on because he didn&rsquo;t trust his teammates.</p>

<p>KG was considered a peer to Duncan until his 2009 injury. What separated the 2 was Duncan’s career post KG injury. KG was considered the best in the league in his prime ahead of Duncan and sometimes kobe in the post-shaq/pre-lebron (primes) era  (just look at 2k ratings which are usually a reflection of public opinion).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>kg dpoy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was an elite defender for most of his Minnesota stretch too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hakeem said bad teammates are why he never learned to pass well</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oddly enough this didn’t stop Chris Paul, lebron James, zeke, KG, Luka, jokic, bird, or trae young from becoming elite passers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>lebron was playing well but the cavs didn’t have a shot at winning a finals</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They were the favorites in 08. Luck just wasn’t on their side.</p>

<p>And it’s not like it hurt lebron’s legacy either. He was still considered to be on the GOAT trajectory.</p>

      <label for="leducct" class="commentText"><p>This was my answer.  He contributed to the toxicity of those Kings teams for sure.  But when he got to New Orleans, he kept it mostly under control.  He never got a full season post Sacramento, and we never got to see him advertise his potential.</p>

<p>I watched a game live in NOLA where the Pels were down to the Pistons most of the game and Cousins just took over and was an unstoppable force.  Plus,  at times,  he was the best 3pt shooter on the team.</p>

      <label for="leeaokw" class="commentText"><p>If you want to see Cousins at his peak, watch back the games when the Kings started something like 9-5 with Mike Malone coaching. It&rsquo;s the year he got viral meningitis and Malone got fired soon after. He had just played for Team USA and came into that year in amazing shape. He was playing dominant on both ends with a pretty mediocre team. I think the starting lineup was Darren Collison, Ben McLemore, Rudy Gay and Jason Thompson alongside Cousins. He was playing at an MVP level until the freak illness.</p>

Its been stated the Coach didnt like him/want him but the Kings wanted him he wanted Monroe i think&hellip;<br>
Cousins deserves 0% blame in that org.<br>
A young kid who bad habits received the key to the city with no guide in sight + a coach who didnt want him.</p>

<p>Years later they draft Willey C.Stein&hellip; the Kings have  always been awful, their culuture was shit and their org was shit.  Even when they finally had a good coach they fired him(Malone).</p>

<p>Cousins and Tyreke could have been wayyy better&hellip;.. yet they still made their mark in the Nba.</p>

      <label for="ledtehm" class="commentText"><p>To play the devil&rsquo;s advocate, I could also see a scenario in which Carmelo ends up in Larry Brown&rsquo;s doghouse early on account of being a teenager struggling to adjust to &ldquo;playing the right way&rdquo;. In 2004 especially, I could see Brown rolling with Tayshaun Prince over Melo simply because Prince provided all the things Brown was looking for (defensive effort, defensive ability, the willingness to play a specific role for the greater good).</p>

<p>Brown could have then been like, &ldquo;Well, Carmelo&rsquo;s 19 years old and he&rsquo;s gotta learn to play the right way.&rdquo; And he&rsquo;d probably be right in his assessment.</p>

<p>From there, it&rsquo;d be a matter of whether Anthony would have swallowed his pride and fully assimilated to being a piece of the puzzle, or whether he would have just bided his time in Detroit until his rookie contract expired before taking off to find a team with which he could be the focal point, like Tracy McGrady when he left for Orlando.</p>

<p>Sometimes I think we overestimate how pliable young players might be, especially when the way they&rsquo;ve played up to that point has already been so rewarding (in Anthony&rsquo;s case, yielding an NCAA championship and top-3 pick).</p>

Denver was a pretty good situation and they put pretty good teams around him and it was never good enough for HIM. At some point he is responsible for the way his career came out.</p>

<p>In the playoffs, they were never swept, never went less than 6 games, and only lost to one seeds (outside of LeBron-led teams). He was also never carried to a playoff win off a bad game. All Star/NBA performances were required from him for Washington to win.</p>

<p>Where he played really efficiently, defended at a high level, and where the wizards were a playoff level squad with him on the court (one of the worst teams in the league with him off of it)?</p>

<p>And he was pretty much immediately rewarded for his play by getting a trade to a championship contender (if it didn’t go through he was getting maxed by utah).</p>

<p>The year in Washington probably saved his career. He went from being a role player on a max deal to being a star because Washington gave him a chance to post up instead of sitting in a corner and watching his “co”-star dribble,</p>

<p>Young star players don’t get salary dumped for Davis bertans because they were unhealthy. Notice how nobody is talking about salary dumping Zion,</p>

<p>He was 100% blamed for his play, which turned out to be a fit issue where he wanted to post up but his costar wanted to dribble all game so he ended up sitting in a corner and immediately looking better when he left.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t disagree that some of his Blazers teams were questionable but you have to be absolutely transcendend to win as a small guard and he is just not on the level of the other superstars who won during his time. Even Jokic and Giannis don&rsquo;t have multiple championships yet.</p>

He was never a top 5 player in the league, despite his insane shooting. Look at Harden, or Russ, or PG, these are all players around his talent level (imo all 3 better but let’s say around), who also haven’t won.</p>

      <label for="ledqduw" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m going to say, as a huge fan of the lob city clippers, that although they both had pretty good primes, both Chris Paul and Blake Griffin were top 5 players in their best seasons. Although they were a great fit next to each other, with the benefit of hindsight, they really only had 1 opportunity to win. DeAndre Jordan was the 3rd best player, and by the numbers he was a good fit, but he was actually terrible at basketball. Even his strengths were totally nullified against good teams like the thunder and spurs. The clippers never really got a starting caliber small forward until after lob city era, with Matt Barnes, luc mbah a moute, and Jeff green being the best they could ever manage for the entire lob city prime. JJ redick and Jamal Crawford were great fits on offense but we really didn&rsquo;t have anyone other than cp3 who could play defense at a reasonably high level at any point. I mean for God&rsquo;s sake at time we had to put cp3 on kd because at 6&rsquo;0 he did a better job slowing kd down than anyone else could manage. Also as time has passed we&rsquo;ve realized that doc is only a good coach if making the playoffs is the goal for the season, not a championship. And lastly, they were both just injury prone superstars.</p>

<p>Imo, those 2 were good enough of a duo to win a championship, my contention is they were both top 5 talents in the 2013-2016 period, although probably both in the 3-6 range. With better management and team building, a couple better trades on their frps, a legitimate 3rd option and/or wing defender, and partnerships with stars who were less injury prone would have lent each of them more than 1 legitimate chance at a title run right before the warriors/cavs era.</p>

<p>Bonus, Chris Paul in New Orleans was a waste of his time. David West was solid, but I don&rsquo;t think anyone can blame cp3 for not making wcf with those teams</p>

      <label for="ledxnly" class="commentText"><p>Ben Simmons to any team that didn’t coddle him</p>

<p>People on this sub forget that he was not just a generational talent out of high school… he was crowned as “the next Lebron”. Lebron himself said that he had the potential to be a greater player.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, he entered the league with a rockstar mindset and the process Sixers were not built with a drill sergeant at any level in the org to make him focus. The first time it ever happened was when Brett Brown wanted Jimmy Butler to have the ball in his hands more, and Ben allegedly was a brat about it and contributed to Butler walking and the org signing Harris with their pants around their ankles</p>

<p>He then clearly had issues with Embiid becoming the clear #1 rather than it being a 1a/1b and started to focus solely on being an elite defender so he could get DPOY to the point that he lost his touch and ability to finish at the rim and even his natural ability to playmake. He went from a generational passing talent to sprinting to the free throw line, jumping 180, and chucking the ball out to the perimeter and then just standing in the dunker.</p>

<p>Then compound it with his body taking a toll and it all came crashing down. He used to post up and bully guys for easy baby hooks, but one time he got pissed off and drove his shoulder into a guy’s chest and tore something in his clavicle. He was terrified to ever post up again… until about a year later he got pissed and did the same exact thing, reinjuring the same shoulder. After that, he stopped posting up and driving to the basket almost entirely. Then the Hawks series happened and the rest is history with his back injuries.</p>

<p>Would a different organization or coach have changed his body being injury prone? No, but his selfishness for stardom was 100% coddled by Brett Brown and ownership and it fed into him doing nothing substantial to improve his offensive game. He practiced 3s on camera but his inability to improve his form or actually shoot them in game proves that it was solely for appearances</p>

      <label for="leee92s" class="commentText"><p>Drexler.  He was one of few bright spots in an organization that somehow managed to make it to the finals twice. if he had gone to say, Utah or Seattle or Pheonix I think one of those teams could have stolen one from MJ&rsquo;s first 3 peat.  Obv he wound up in Houston with Hakeem later on but in my head he&rsquo;s chasing at least #2 by 95.</p>

      <label for="leeec11" class="commentText"><p>Kind of an under the radar pick but I would say Stephon Marbury. He had the talent, but not the maturity to be better than what his NBA career ended up becoming. Still, I find it amazing that he managed to get a couple All Star and All NBA nods. Even got an Olympic medal.</p>

      <label for="leeegtn" class="commentText"><p>A lot of people saying LeBron. But those years in Cleveland were pretty formidable. Yes, he had to carry heavily, but that forced him to expand his passing and outside shooting game. True, he could have had more titles or accolades. There is a good chance he would have aged his game just as well. But those years in Cleveland forced him to be more creative in how he spaced the floor. Maybe I’m wrong though, I was like 10 when he was drafted.</p>

<p>However, I was ahead of my time and got a piece published in the local news paper comparing stats between him and MJ in the 4th grade. So I got that going for me. Bitch ass teacher gave me a B- so I wanted to make her feel bad and sent it to newspapers until someone published it then brought the paper in and told her I don’t need her lessons. I was a petty 10 year old.</p>

      <label for="leegi0k" class="commentText"><p>Jeremy Lin tbh. The Nets were the first team to truly believe in him and gave him the keys to the franchise. It was amazing for a bit, then he got injured. During his injury, the Nets went 1-27. When he got back, they closed out the season 11-13. He was a HUGE difference maker. Then next season he had a career ending injury (his confidence was completely shot when he got back).</p>

<p>His one year on the Hornets also created their winningest season in years; didn&rsquo;t surprise me at all that they went back to not making the playoffs when they chose to invest in Batum instead of Lin. (And don&rsquo;t get me wrong; I love Batum, but Lin was the reason they had a turnaround season imo)</p>

If Cleveland Signs Steve Nash, Kyle Korver, drafts JR, Swaggy P, Javale that is probably the best offense ever with Korver coming off the bench and they get old slower vets after that.</p>

<p>That’s the most shotmaking, passing, and athleticism Bron or Nash played with.</p>

<p>If Mike Dan &amp; Tony coaches I don’t think they lose when healthy. Watch old Heat games. Bron still gets guarded by 5 guys.</p>

<p>No 5SoL Suns, no 09’ Magic, no Steph Curry. This team would almost just appear and would completely fuck teams up.</p>

<p>I would probably take that team over any other team in history. JR &amp; Nick Young would have been in the perfect environments to play their game.</p>

<p>JR lost his athleticism by the time Bron got him. If Bron could have gotten the 2017’ Cavs sooner in his career he wouldn’t have lost.</p>

<p>Allen Iversonbut he is trickier to build around.</p>

<p>Also Cade Cunningham is about to be a top 5-10 player this year.</p>

      <label for="ledmkba" class="commentText"><p>Went idiotically all in for Porzingis in year 1 which completely removed possibility to rebuild through the draft, as well as limited cap space by adding such amazing players like THJ and Courtney Lee. Then didn’t sign anyone noteworthy with cap space that we had. Gave up Barnes for free. Gave up Seth Curry for Richardson who then had to be dumped. Sign and traded for Delon Wright. Then refused to give Brunson the <sup>54</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> contract that he was actually willing to sign and allowed him to leave for nothing. Traded KP for Bertans and Dinwiddie (and even gave up a pick for that). Didn’t bring any good center until Lively.</p>

<p>Lukas first 5 years in the league was just a catastrophe after catastrophe and he was still actually in the MVP conversations since his year 2.</p>
