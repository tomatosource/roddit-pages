      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5605834/2024/07/02/klay-thompson-warriors-split/" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s been a layered five-year path to this divorce, splintering last season, sprouting earlier and finalizing in the last couple weeks, where —among the conversations Thompson had, league sources said — was a request of Stephen Curry not to exert his significant organizational influence and up the temperature with management to ensure Thompson’s return. Curry’s measured voice, even if it altered the outcome, wouldn’t change the genuineness of Joe Lacob and the front office’s true desire to have Thompson back.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Controlling owner Joe Lacob led a front-office effort to take a cold, mostly uncommunicative approach to Thompson’s next contract in his three summers of extension eligibility, team sources said, which isn’t separate from their norm. Lacob has done similar in the past with Curry, Kerr, Bob Myers, Andre Iguodala and Green, using dwindling time as a weapon but ultimately paying up (he put a substantial offer on the table for Myers) after a staring contest.</p>

<p>Thompson operates on his own wavelength. The Warriors’ decision-makers were warned that a drawn-out negotiation into July during this free-agent cycle wouldn’t be met the same way. He wasn’t trying to leverage his way back until the bitter end.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But his decision, as one source put it, became easy when the Warriors kicked him down the summer pecking order.</p>

<p>There was little communication between Thompson, the Warriors and Thompson’s agent, Greg Lawrence, and ultimately no offer in this cycle. Warriors sources maintained a plan to eventually make a competitive offer in relation to his market once other business was settled. But they never had the chance. Many league sources said Thompson’s decision to depart was unofficially made weeks ago.</p>

      <label for="lban3r5" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not odd at all. Klay is a 6th man. He wants a starter role. They saw what they were able to accomplish with him in the starter role and said they can do the same thing without him. Which is true they wont be making the playoffs this year either. They already gave him 2 max contracts and offered him 2 years 50 million this season, but they wanted to reduce the role to that of a 6th man. I honestly see both sides. Klay believes he still has it they did not it is what it is.</p>

With today’s medicine, techniques and technology players usually pick up where they left off when it comes to returning from ACLs.  With Achilles injuries players often lose a step or 2.

      <label for="lbawgon" class="commentText"><p>His defense also went from league best to traffic cone. I watched teams target Klay on defense, which would have been insanity back when Klay was Klay. He also kept trying to shoot himself back into rhythm, which meant those 40% 3s were accompanied by an awful diet of ill-advised midrangers. I love Klay, but he was not a starter-caliber player last year, and he refused to accept that. I wish him the best in Dallas, but the dubs made the right call here.</p>

      <label for="lbaqu6q" class="commentText"><p>Yes but its detrimental. If you have a consistent 38% three point shooter, you can rely on him for 10-15 every night. But when you have a wildly inconsistent shooter, he turns up at games that would have been blowouts either way, and then clanks everything when you need a couple of buckets to win a much needed game. I&rsquo;m not saying Klay was the sole reason for warriors losses, but you could clearly point out games where if he had shot his average, the warriors would be in a much better position for the playoffs. And there were too many of those games.</p>

<p>Consistent production, even if average, trumps inconsistent flashes of brilliance every time. If it were the other way around, Westbrook would have 10 MVPs by now.</p>

<p>Klay scored 10+ points in 66 of 76 games last season.  15+ points in 53 games. It seems like you could rely on him for 10-15 points</p>

They lost 16 of those bad Curry games and 22 of the bad Klay games. They were pretty close in terms of consistency and how it effected the teams W/L record.

<p>Excluding his November which was bad all around, he shot under 25% from 3 in 15 games. Of those 15 games he won 9 of them. That&rsquo;s a 60% winrate in his worst 3 point shooting games, which is higher than the Warrior&rsquo;s overall winrate.</p>

<p>Now of course this is surface level numbers but I think it goes to show his terrible shooting games perhaps weren&rsquo;t losing the warriors as many games as people think.</p>

      <label for="lbaww80" class="commentText"><p>On nine attempts, that leaves a lot of room for inconsistency.  The warriors have less room to make up for that inconsistency with their current roster.  Kinda makes sense if someone is completely hot/cold you&rsquo;d wanna temp check and adjust every game.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d be interested to see the standard deviation in  misses, comp that to some similar players on the contract Klay wanted.</p>

      <label for="lbar6an" class="commentText"><p>Yes, but there’s a difference between a guy who shoots <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> from 3 every game vs a guy who shoots <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> one game and then goes 0/6, 0/4, 0/5 for the next 3 games.  Both shot 40%, but the first guy put forth a solid game each time whereas the second won you 1 game then shot you out of 3 of them.  </p>

<p>Klay isn’t washed or anything, but he is inconsistent and his attitude was really frustrating especially in his last year, when he would demand that the team let him try and shoot himself out of slumps with horrible shots and then get mad when they weren’t falling.  It was painfully apparent that he was angry that he wasn’t going to get an all-star level contract and would make games about him which took the Warriors completely out of several games. </p>

<p>It’s not a stretch at all to say that if Klay was just a little more disciplined and less selfish, the Warriors would have made the playoffs outright, and certainly wouldn’t have had such an embarrassing loss in the playins.  </p>

<p>I’m not glad he’s gone or anything, and I appreciate everything he did for the franchise, but if he was going to act like this, then the Warriors were right to not prioritize his return. </p>

      <label for="lbas5wm" class="commentText"><p>Klay has to have one of the largest standards of deviation from his averages in the league.  Like I swear he’ll go like <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> 60% of the time and <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> the other 40%</p>

<p>I’m exaggerating, but he just has so many ugly games, and his shot selection can be so bad at times.  Like he takes all of these heat-check shots when he’s just starting to get going.</p>

<p>He’s still a solid defender, but not a great one, and he doesn’t do much as far as rebounding or playmaking goes. I think he’s still a quality starter, but more as a 3rd or 4th option.  He still sees himself as someone who should get 15 shots a night.</p>

      <label for="lbaq2vp" class="commentText"><p>This.  To be fair, Klay has always been a streaky shooter.  Perhaps the hottest and most streaky I&rsquo;d ever seen.  It was frustrating earlier in his career too.  The thing is as Klay got better he did the other things, and the Warriors had enough firepower that bad Klay games didn&rsquo;t hurt you as much as he helped overall.</p>

<p>Klay is still that streaky player&ndash; but instead of excelling at the other things and the team headroom to support his cold spells, his point of attack defense has been replaced with bad shot hunting, which has hurt a team that was losing a lot of close games.</p>

<p>I do think there’s a reason there’s a disconnect between warriors org/fans and the rest of league on the Klay subject. And I will always have fond memories of his work ethic and what he did for our franchise.</p>

<p>And I’m not salty in the slightest that I don’t think it’s a good deal for the Mavs.</p>

<p>His box score does him more justice than his contributions. His defense actually isn’t half bad, he’s a fine middle starter defender. He doesn’t offer any intangibles and rebounding leaves a lot to desire.</p>

<p>His shot selection can be back breaking and he has never had a feel for when to shoot and when it’s better to take a different approach. That mixed with his stubbornness to take a different role may be taxing for Luka and Kidd</p>

<p>It’s been a layered five-year path to this divorce, splintering last season, sprouting earlier and finalizing in the last couple weeks. Among the conversations Thompson had in those final weeks, league sources said, was a request of Stephen Curry not to exert his significant organizational influence and up the temperature with management to ensure Thompson’s return.</p>

      <label for="lbaxuqj" class="commentText"><p>no that doesn&rsquo;t solve the problem and is still, esssentaily incorrect. Slater used &lsquo;a request of Stephen curry&rdquo; which is literally, possessive (of) and indicates that THE request WAS Stephs. It was Steph&rsquo;s request. Which is of course, not the case. It was a request FOR Steph. OR perhaps TO would work. But certainly not OF</p>

<p>In addition the &lsquo;up&rsquo; the temperature does not read well at all, though in spoken language that of course works fine.</p>

There’s WAY more to this that just kinda makes you sympathize with Dunleavey. Klay was stubborn, selfish to the end of it. By all means, you’ve won 4 championships for the franchise, you’re a free agent, he’s a human being at the end of the day he can do whatever he wants, it’s his choice. But he went about all of it, especially multiple instances where he’s lashed out at the coaching staff, management, even some players, I’m assuming Podzjiemski being one of them, it’s been a loaded year full of tension.</p>

He put up like three in the first half, and none were anywhere close to going in. Seriously, you could go back throughout his career and probably count the number of runners he’s attempted on two hands.</p>

      <label for="lba6wme" class="commentText"><p>Yea if Klay wanted to be the primary focus of a team&rsquo;s offseason plans, then that&rsquo;s his decision.</p>

<p>All I&rsquo;m saying is, the teams interested in Klay already have their two main stars and a couple key role players and he was clearly being pursued by those teams to be  a 3rd banana.  So it shouldn&rsquo;t have been shocking to him that the warriors were trying to create a similar situation - go out and find someone that would allow Klay to be in a more suited role for him.</p>

<p>But with the warriors not getting PG, Klay would still be waiting on them if he went down that road, so he definitely made the right choice in terms of securing his future, if that&rsquo;s what was important to him.</p>

      <label for="lbar5it" class="commentText"><p>They offered him a 2-year contract because Steph and Draymond have 2 years remaining.  Klay is temperamental, he was offended by that, offended by being asked to come off the bench, offended by 1000 different things. He wanted to leave, regardless of the offer. Good luck to him. Hopefully it doesn&rsquo;t turn out for him the way it did for Tony Parker.</p>

Steph definitely gets a retirement contract while Klay and Dray are at the whim of whatever the team situation is in 2 years.</p>

<p>Honestly, him and Tim Duncan might have had the best possible organization throughout their career. In terms of money, support and smart management.</p>

<p>They are still trying to build something around Curry, even though it&rsquo;s very clear that they lack the assets and cap space to create a championship winning team.</p>

      <label for="lbatjj7" class="commentText"><p>Might be giving Dubs a bit too much “altruistic” credit tbh. Steph is literally the franchise GOAT, shooting GOAT, and depending on who you ask, top-10 + GOAT PG. And that doesn’t even touch on how he’s epitomized selflessness, patience, and professionalism through so much internal strife. Hard to mistreat someone who matters so much and does so little wrong. It’s in the Warriors interest to maximize competitiveness while they still have a cash cow like Curry on the roster.</p>

<p>I could be wrong but this is generally the case for franchise GOATs. Your fanbase would burn you at the stake if you otherwise betray/undermine a player of that caliber</p>

      <label for="lbauf60" class="commentText"><p>It’s understandable that he’s frustrated about not getting back to where he was before his injuries but the last two years have been an endless cycle of him being upset about something, somebody on the team sitting down and talking to him, him saying that things are better now that he’s accepted his role and limitations as a player, this lasts for a week or two and then starts back at the beginning. Klay is a Warriors legend who deserves to be celebrated and will have his jersey hanging in the rafters someday but at this point I think it’s better that he gets a fresh start somewhere else.</p>

<p>Obviously we&rsquo;re all playing armchair psychology but wouldn&rsquo;t it hurt if your fall-off after a dynastic tenure was being viewed as hurting someone else rather than yourself?</p>

      <label for="lba5dgw" class="commentText"><p>Seems like the Warriors essentially had two paths (the &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo; that dumping Poole for CP3 granted them):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Trade CP3. That would mean they&rsquo;d be over the tax line, so re-signing Klay wouldn&rsquo;t cost them anything but money.</p></li>

<li><p>Waive CP3. That puts them below the tax line, and re-signing Klay would hinder their ability to add other players (for example, using the NTMLE).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The Warriors were waiting to see how that unfolded before approaching Klay, and Klay (reasonably) didn&rsquo;t like that he was more of an afterthought than a priority.</p>

      <label for="lba62cw" class="commentText"><p>Article makes it seem like Klay leaving wasn’t really a sudden change of mind thing even as it mentions the fact that the Warriors didn’t Klay a contract during the mandatory cycle where teams get to negotiate with their own free agents before any other team.</p>

<p>Honestly that sounds about right. It sucks, but what’s most clear is that Klay just wasn’t good at dictating leverage at all and it was amplified through a combination of missed opportunities and plain bad luck.</p>

<p>Well I mean, shit. Best of luck to him.</p>

      <label for="lbao1p1" class="commentText"><p>Aside from that headline&ndash; which, <em>oof</em>&ndash; my main takeaway from this entire scenario is that if Golden State hadn&rsquo;t enjoyed unprecedented success with the Curry/Thompson/Green trio over the years, Thompson would&rsquo;ve left a while back. He&rsquo;s just a different person and maybe didn&rsquo;t feel like he was always the greatest fit there in an interpersonal way, and that&rsquo;s totally okay. It doesn&rsquo;t take anything from his accomplishments or the success they had, and now he gets to experience a different sort of environment in Dallas. Hopefully it works out for Klay and hopefully Golden State can pivot to a successful future as well.</p>
