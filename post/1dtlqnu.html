      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5605834/2024/07/02/klay-thompson-warriors-split/" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs been a layered five-year path to this divorce, splintering last season, sprouting earlier and finalizing in the last couple weeks, where ‚Äîamong the conversations Thompson had, league sources said ‚Äî was a request of Stephen Curry not to exert his significant organizational influence and up the temperature with management to ensure Thompson‚Äôs return. Curry‚Äôs measured voice, even if it altered the outcome, wouldn‚Äôt change the genuineness of Joe Lacob and the front office‚Äôs true desire to have Thompson back.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Controlling owner Joe Lacob led a front-office effort to take a cold, mostly uncommunicative approach to Thompson‚Äôs next contract in his three summers of extension eligibility, team sources said, which isn‚Äôt separate from their norm. Lacob has done similar in the past with Curry, Kerr, Bob Myers, Andre Iguodala and Green, using dwindling time as a weapon but ultimately paying up (he put a substantial offer on the table for Myers) after a staring contest.</p>

<p>Thompson operates on his own wavelength. The Warriors‚Äô decision-makers were warned that a drawn-out negotiation into July during this free-agent cycle wouldn‚Äôt be met the same way. He wasn‚Äôt trying to leverage his way back until the bitter end.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But his decision, as one source put it, became easy when the Warriors kicked him down the summer pecking order.</p>

<p>There was little communication between Thompson, the Warriors and Thompson‚Äôs agent, Greg Lawrence, and ultimately no offer in this cycle. Warriors sources maintained a plan to eventually make a competitive offer in relation to his market once other business was settled. But they never had the chance. Many league sources said Thompson‚Äôs decision to depart was unofficially made weeks ago.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been a layered five-year path to this divorce, splintering last season, sprouting earlier and finalizing in the last couple weeks.

Slater used &lsquo;a request of Stephen curry&rdquo; which is literally, possessive (of) and indicates that THE request WAS Stephs. It was Steph&rsquo;s request. Which is of course, not the case. It was a request FOR Steph. OR perhaps TO would work. But certainly not OF</p>

<p>In addition the &lsquo;up&rsquo; the temperature does not read well at all, though in spoken language that of course works fine.</p>

But he went about all of it, especially multiple instances where he‚Äôs lashed out at the coaching staff, management, even some players, I‚Äôm assuming Podzjiemski being one of them, it‚Äôs been a loaded year full of tension.</p>

They saw what they were able to accomplish with him in the starter role and said they can do the same thing without him. Which is true they wont be making the playoffs this year either. They already gave him 2 max contracts and offered him 2 years 50 million this season, but they wanted to reduce the role to that of a 6th man. I honestly see both sides. Klay believes he still has it they did not it is what it is.</p>

      <label for="lbaqu6q" class="commentText"><p>Yes but its detrimental. If you have a consistent 38% three point shooter, you can rely on him for 10-15 every night. But when you have a wildly inconsistent shooter, he turns up at games that would have been blowouts either way, and then clanks everything when you need a couple of buckets to win a much needed game. I&rsquo;m not saying Klay was the sole reason for warriors losses, but you could clearly point out games where if he had shot his average, the warriors would be in a much better position for the playoffs. And there were too many of those games.</p>

<p>Consistent production, even if average, trumps inconsistent flashes of brilliance every time. If it were the other way around, Westbrook would have 10 MVPs by now.</p>

<p>Klay scored 10+ points in 66 of 76 games last season.  15+ points in 53 games. It seems like you could rely on him for 10-15 points</p>

I feel like the fanbase is mad because he‚Äôs slipping and they need a scapegoat when in reality their roster isn‚Äôt put together well and players are getting older. How long can you get by with a core 3 of shorter players with declining athleticism? The new CBA is an issue, but to say Klay is washed when he can still gather interest from contending teams is ludicrous. + his numbers look good on paper</p>

<p>Klay isn‚Äôt washed or anything, but he is inconsistent and his attitude was really frustrating especially in his last year, when he would demand that the team let him try and shoot himself out of slumps with horrible shots and then get mad when they weren‚Äôt falling. ¬†It was painfully apparent that he was angry that he wasn‚Äôt going to get an all-star level contract and would make games about him which took the Warriors completely out of several games.¬†</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not a stretch at all to say that if Klay was just a little more disciplined and less selfish, the Warriors would have made the playoffs outright, and certainly wouldn‚Äôt have had such an embarrassing loss in the playins. ¬†</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not glad he‚Äôs gone or anything, and I appreciate everything he did for the franchise, but if he was going to act like this, then the Warriors were right to not prioritize his return.¬†</p>

<p>I‚Äôm exaggerating, but he just has so many ugly games, and his shot selection can be so bad at times.  Like he takes all of these heat-,check shots when he‚Äôs just starting to get going.</p>

<p>He‚Äôs still a solid defender, but not a great one, and he doesn‚Äôt do much as far as rebounding or playmaking goes. I think he‚Äôs still a quality starter, but more as a 3rd or 4th option.  He still sees himself as someone who should get 15 shots a night.</p>

I watched teams target Klay on defense, which would have been insanity back when Klay was Klay. He also kept trying to shoot himself back into rhythm, which meant those 40% 3s were accompanied by an awful diet of ill-advised midrangers. I love Klay, but he was not a starter-caliber player last year, and he refused to accept that. I wish him the best in Dallas, but the dubs made the right call here.</p>

It was frustrating earlier in his career too.  The thing is as Klay got better he did the other things, and the Warriors had enough firepower that bad Klay games didn&rsquo;t hurt you as much as he helped overall.</p>

<p>Klay is still that streaky player&ndash; but instead of excelling at the other things and the team headroom to support his cold spells, his point of attack defense has been replaced with bad shot hunting, which has hurt a team that was losing a lot of close games.</p>

      <label for="lbb21qi" class="commentText"><p>I think the issue with Klay is defensively he lost a step. The new CBA would have punished them greatly for keeping Klay. Moody and Podz are cheaper. Podz in particular can add a passing dynamic to the back court that Klay didn&rsquo;t have as much of which was badly needed ever since Iguodala left and is especially needed now that Paul is gone.</p>

<p>One thing that keeps Curry happy is the motion offense. You need as many playmakers as possible. Klay was great off the ball and getting pressure off Curry. He isn&rsquo;t an awful playmaker by any stretch but I think the Warriors figure they could replace his production for less.</p>

<p>Curry, Podz, Wiggins, Kuminga, Dray, Looney, TJD, GPII is a decent core of players still. The issue is age and health of Curry and Dray and an increasingly competitive Western Conference making even a 45-48 win team potentially in the play-in.</p>

      <label for="lba6wme" class="commentText"><p>Yea if Klay wanted to be the primary focus of a team&rsquo;s offseason plans, then that&rsquo;s his decision.</p>

<p>All I&rsquo;m saying is, the teams interested in Klay already have their two main stars and a couple key role players and he was clearly being pursued by those teams to be  a 3rd banana.  So it shouldn&rsquo;t have been shocking to him that the warriors were trying to create a similar situation - go out and find someone that would allow Klay to be in a more suited role for him.</p>

<p>But with the warriors not getting PG, Klay would still be waiting on them if he went down that road, so he definitely made the right choice in terms of securing his future, if that&rsquo;s what was important to him.</p>

      <label for="lbar5it" class="commentText"><p>They offered him a 2-year contract because Steph and Draymond have 2 years remaining.  Klay is temperamental, he was offended by that, offended by being asked to come off the bench, offended by 1000 different things. He wanted to leave, regardless of the offer. Good luck to him. Hopefully it doesn&rsquo;t turn out for him the way it did for Tony Parker.</p>

<p>Honestly, him and Tim Duncan might have had the best possible organization throughout their career. In terms of money, support and smart management.</p>

<p>They are still trying to build something around Curry, even though it&rsquo;s very clear that they lack the assets and cap space to create a championship winning team.</p>

      <label for="lbatjj7" class="commentText"><p>Might be giving Dubs a bit too much ‚Äúaltruistic‚Äù credit tbh. Steph is literally the franchise GOAT, shooting GOAT, and depending on who you ask, top-10 + GOAT PG. And that doesn‚Äôt even touch on how he‚Äôs epitomized selflessness, patience, and professionalism through so much internal strife. Hard to mistreat someone who matters so much and does so little wrong. It‚Äôs in the Warriors interest to maximize competitiveness while they still have a cash cow like Curry on the roster.</p>

<p>I could be wrong but this is generally the case for franchise GOATs. Your fanbase would burn you at the stake if you otherwise betray/undermine a player of that caliber</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Trade CP3. That would mean they&rsquo;d be over the tax line, so re-signing Klay wouldn&rsquo;t cost them anything but money.</p></li>

<li><p>Waive CP3. That puts them below the tax line, and re-signing Klay would hinder their ability to add other players (for example, using the NTMLE).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The Warriors were waiting to see how that unfolded before approaching Klay, and Klay (reasonably) didn&rsquo;t like that he was more of an afterthought than a priority.</p>

Klay is a Warriors legend who deserves to be celebrated and will have his jersey hanging in the rafters someday but at this point I think it‚Äôs better that he gets a fresh start somewhere else.</p>

      <label for="lba62cw" class="commentText"><p>Article makes it seem like Klay leaving wasn‚Äôt really a sudden change of mind thing even as it mentions the fact that the Warriors didn‚Äôt Klay a contract during the mandatory cycle where teams get to negotiate with their own free agents before any other team.</p>

<p>Honestly that sounds about right. It sucks, but what‚Äôs most clear is that Klay just wasn‚Äôt good at dictating leverage at all and it was amplified through a combination of missed opportunities and plain bad luck.</p>

<p>Well I mean, shit. Best of luck to him.</p>

      <label for="lbao1p1" class="commentText"><p>Aside from that headline&ndash; which, <em>oof</em>&ndash; my main takeaway from this entire scenario is that if Golden State hadn&rsquo;t enjoyed unprecedented success with the Curry/Thompson/Green trio over the years, Thompson would&rsquo;ve left a while back. He&rsquo;s just a different person and maybe didn&rsquo;t feel like he was always the greatest fit there in an interpersonal way, and that&rsquo;s totally okay. It doesn&rsquo;t take anything from his accomplishments or the success they had, and now he gets to experience a different sort of environment in Dallas. Hopefully it works out for Klay and hopefully Golden State can pivot to a successful future as well.</p>

      <label for="lbb4qrt" class="commentText"><p>He went 0-10 in the play in tournament and his corner 3 shooting percentage has falling off hard over the past 3 seasons. He&rsquo;s not the player he used to be and he&rsquo;s not worth the luxury tax either. Lots of teams will have to make had decisions like this.</p>

<p>That being said, I really feel like the Warriors did him kinda dirty. I remember before the Warriors landed Durant ‚Äî everyone was wanting Klay to develop handles and be able to generate his own offense with the ball in his hands. He was starting to do that in the final season before Durant. Once Durant joined, Klay took the biggest step back and became exclusively a 3&amp;D guy.</p>

<p>After his extended injury absence, he came back and it was apparent that he had been working on his handles and he demonstrated a new level of confidence in that ability. It was just sad because he got dead legs pretty early and he faded later into that season. The following seasons he continually got jerked around and was struggling with younger players for consistent minutes. That short leash made him a shell of himself again. He either had the green light to jack up shots, or he got pulled immediately.</p>

<p>I feel like Klay&rsquo;s selflessness and the signing of Durant really capped Klay&rsquo;s upside.<br>
I&rsquo;ve lived in the Bay Area during this entire era and it&rsquo;s sad to see him go, but I hope Klay smashes records next season and attempts an ungodly amount of 3s. Not because it helps my favorite teams, but because it would be great to see that for one of my favorite players.</p>

<p>Draymond, this is your fault you emotional man-child. If this is the end of things, I hope history justifiably blames you for blowing up this organization and remembers your many failures.</p>
