    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>LeBron was very close to joining this list as well, as he won the scoring title in 2008 and was runner up to DPOY in 2013. Giannis was similarly close, winning DPOY in 2020 and coming in 2nd in scoring 2022, 0.7ppg behind Embiid for the scoring title. He&rsquo;s still in his prime so maybe he has a shot, though with Luka and Embiid&rsquo;s crazy numbers in recent years it seems unlikely</p>

Even if the dude only averages 2-3 makes a game from 3, that’s an extra 6-9 points per game he adds.

      <label for="ld0ph4s" class="commentText"><p>It’s difficult. Jordan wouldn’t have won in this era, Hakeem would have won. Rim protection is just way more valuable than guard defense overall.</p>

<p>Embiid/Giannis are the best candidates out of current players. Giannis won’t win a scoring title with Luka and Embiid to oppose I don’t think, while I doubt Embiid ever gets consideration for DPOY now he scores so much. Plus the games minimum would be a problem.</p>

      <label for="ld0qlu7" class="commentText"><p>I think that’s a tough ask for Wemby.</p>

<p>Embiid averaged 35 points this year on 65% true shooting. It was one of the 10 greatest scoring seasons ever through 39 games, and his 2023 season also ranks in the top 25 all time. He has two scoring titles and was almost certainly en route to a third.</p>

<p>Wemby still has a lot of polish to do on offense. Only a few big men in history have scored as well as Embiid, at least in the regular season. Malone, Shaq, that’s basically it really in the modern era.</p>

      <label for="ld0u6tv" class="commentText"><p>But Embiid is in his prime and if anything, his defensive impact (or at least reputation) is a bit past its peak. It’s hard for me to envision Embiid at this point having a full/healthy enough season to overtake all of Gobert, Wemby, AD and Bam as a defensive stopper while also still having enough to maintain his scoring output (not to mention Maxey and now PG getting theirs).</p>

<p>Wemby in the meantime averaged more PPG than Embiid did in their respective rookie seasons while being more than 2 years younger than Embiid was. He has a long way to go no doubt, but if we’re talking potential, I see a longer remaining career for Wemby, with DPOYs for Wemby as equal if not higher likelihood than scoring titles for Embiid, and a similar if not better starting point than what embiid had as a rookie in respects to scoring.</p>

Maybe if the spurs remain pretty bad and he <em>has</em> to put up that kind of volume, but he’s not the same level of shooter as Embiid and really shouldn’t be taking as many jumpers as it would take to actually lead the league in scoring.</p>

      <label for="ld0uhxj" class="commentText"><p>Smart was also a function of Gobert voter fatigue. The standard stats for voting for DPOY all pointed to Rudy again but voters didn’t want to give him another after the 2021 playoffs, which meant the criteria for the year specially became insanely subjective because using any kind of advanced stats just pointed to Gobert again. It was a perfect storm for Smart to really capitalize on narrative especially once Williams went down.</p>

<p>Once your offense is above average, voters slot you for MVP candidacy and take you off the DPOY list.</p>

<p>It’s dumb as F but it’s political. Just like how MVP isn’t the MVP by definition anymore. It’s the most important player on one of the best teams.</p>
