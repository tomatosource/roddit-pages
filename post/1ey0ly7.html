<p>you have pro-Tatum fans who will genuinely claim that he’s the best player in the world which is just an absurd take even as a Celtics fan who loves JT</p>

<p>but then anti-Tatum fans call him a glorified role player who the Celtics could have won a title without, and will make you out to be insane if you consider him arguably a top 5 player</p>

<p>like what is it about this guy that turns everyone into a crazy person when they talk about him. it’s extra funny to me bc Tatum himself is one of the most calm and measured athletes I’ve ever seen, but the discourse around him is anything but</p>

Tatum might be the 5th best NBA player but he wasn&rsquo;t needed in a large role on the Olympic team and the idea that Kerr had to go because Tatum wasn&rsquo;t playing was crazy. Embiid didn&rsquo;t play a ton either and shouldn&rsquo;t have but you don&rsquo;t see as many Philly fans calling for Kerr&rsquo;s head as there were Tatum/Boston fans.</p>

<p>Most JT fans, even in the Celtics sub, are realistic about his standing among the top 10 players.  Top 5 is probably where we see him now.  This is for more serious discussions of course.</p>

<p>The hate comes from a) he&rsquo;s a Celtic, and b) because fans were defending Tatum when he gets  benched during the Olympics</p>

      <label for="ljc7c66" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s Prime PG with a maxed out luck stat. The definition for superstar is usually top 10ish player that can lead a team to a championship as the first option. With guys like PG or Dame the answer to whether or not they met those criteria was probably if they had a really good team with a second option almost as good as them. They&rsquo;d need a reasonable amount of injury luck too. Those guys were viewed as superstars, but that title was a formality cuz realistically, they would never get a ring. Tatum has ppl actually debating the validity of all of this since he pulled off the near-impossible with the help of the Celtics FO. He&rsquo;s also the best American player under 30. So he basically has all of these accolades and titles that are typically found on pantheon players while arguably not being a top 75 player all time.</p>

      <label for="ljdcxqn" class="commentText"><p>bc people have been saying that since Tatum entered the league and ignored that Tatum has evolved into a way better all-around player than PG ever was.</p>

<p>he’s bigger, stronger, faster, more durable, and more willing to do the dirty work. he’s a more efficient and higher volume scorer, a better finisher, a better ball-handler, a better passer, a better decision-maker, a better rebounder, a better screener, better at avoiding turnovers, better at playing through contact, better at getting to the line, better at switching 1-5, and better at guarding down low.</p>

<p>Tatum is also a better leader, a better 1st option and a better pressure performer. OP is ignoring that it wasn’t just bad luck with PG, a lot of his failures have come from him cracking under pressure bc he’s never been a very strong player mentally, and he’s never been good about taking accountability either. remember CJ Miles and Doc, or what he said about Harden coming in last year? you might think these things aren’t relevant to their quality but being a guy that contributes to team chemistry instead of hurting it is a major factor in winning.</p>

<p>the only things peak PG had over current Tatum are perimeter defense and maybe 3P shooting (which he’s really just as streaky at as Tatum). also their games barely even resemble each other anymore outside their at-times frustrating shot selection; Tatum is more like a homeless man’s LeBron than PG</p>

But he was also 12th on team USA&rsquo;s depth chart and he looked bad while on the court. He was also chucking a lot of bricks in his last two finals appearances.</p>

<p>At times he looks like a clear top 5 player and other times it&rsquo;s hard to argue he&rsquo;s even top 20 when he&rsquo;s getting outplayed by Booker and Jaylen Brown.</p>

<p>We were exactly here when Jordan and Lebron were 26 too. People just expect way too much way too soon and bash guys before they’ve even reached their prime. Tatum is still improving measurably by the year.</p>

<p>Not saying Tatum is or will be on their level, but career accolades are going to pile up for him in some serious historic fashion.</p>

<p>If you want to talk about him as the face of the NBA, or an all time great, or whatever else that is going to be the unreasonable standard he is held to. If you want to be Kobe, or Lebron or Jordan, or whoever than part of that is being under a microscope.</p>

<p>E: crazy I’m downvoted when Tatum was doing a press run about how the face of the league is his and he’s going to take it literally just this season. How soon we all forget</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s the model of what franchises that haven&rsquo;t drafted mvp candidates want from their guys. Superstar peaks with the mindset and humility to play unselfishly when he&rsquo;s not hot.</p>

<p>That does not, however, get you favorable looks when you put that guy in the same conversation as MJ and Kobe. Have some self awareness.</p>

<p>The point I was making is that Tatum absolutely does get put under the same microscope as Jordan and Lebron.  And that seems to be Tatum&rsquo;s fatal flaw - he&rsquo;s not Jordan or Lebron but people criticize him for minor flaws as if he should be.  But he&rsquo;s damn good - his resume is on cruise control to Top 50 all time player and Top 25 is extremely achievable.</p>

<p>Tatum himself has talked about being the face of the nba. What other standard should he be held to if he himself is saying shit like that?</p>

<p>If you aren’t good enough to be in that conversation, but you and your biggest fans insist on putting you into it, that’s the level of criticism you’re going to take. Im not sure why that is everybody else’s fault.</p>

<p>Fans didn’t start the Kobe stuff. Tatum did.</p>

<p>Fans didn’t start the face of the league thing, Tatum did.</p>

<p>He certainly has a lot of Celtics fans who follow his lead on those things, but when you literally do puff pieces about how it’s your crown to take, and you constantly do the Kobe thing, what else is going to happen?</p>

<p>I know it’s a ridiculous comparison. Tatum is the one who doesn’t seem to get that</p>

<p>E: also when Steph, KD, and Lebron are mentioned while discussing taking their spot, you should absolutely be out playing them or expect to get shit for it when you don’t even get any meaningful run.</p>

Duncan&rsquo;s signature shot was a mid range bank shot, it wasn&rsquo;t the same as KG or or even pre-injury Chris Webber. The super common narrative was that if you replaced Duncan on the Spurs with KG and vice versa, KG would be considered the best PF (that narrative still get trotted out sometimes).</p>

Oftentimes when Luka called for a screen it was to get Porzingis on him but Tatum would call out a switch and take the big man before Luka could get there. Takes a lot of intelligence and awareness but Wolves could’ve gotten better switches with that and using KAT in the Tatum role</p>

<p>But yeah, wearing Luka down definitely seems to be an important strategy when playing these Mavs.</p>

      <label for="ljbxdaq" class="commentText"><p>It’s a microcosm of NBA discourse as a whole I think. It’s like 80% of NBA fans have no idea how to communicate about basketball unless it’s negative and toxic.</p>

<p>The toxicity is woven into the fabric of basically every single media outlet/NBA news aggregator - the primary way that they talk about the league is through the lens of negativity and insults towards players to drive engagement, rather than positivity and celebratory of player/team achievements (with some exceptions obviously)</p>

<p>If you play NBA2k with randoms you’ll know what I’m talking about as well. I’ve never encountered a gaming community in all my life whose default stance is highly combative towards just about any other player they encounter in game, which is particularly weird considering it’s a team game where winning is MUCH easier if your team is working well together.</p>

<p>It almost feels like US Politics - it’s so hard to get a positive message out. The thing most people care about is hating The Others rather than anything substantive.</p>

      <label for="ljdku28" class="commentText"><p>Absolutely. Everything here has to be 1. negative and 2. lacking nuance and context</p>

<p>People are legitimately trying to argue that Tatum didn’t contribute to a title winning season because he didn’t win finals mvp.</p>

<p>For them, the argument is literally: “didn’t win finals mvp, so didn’t contribute”. The black and white mindset of some of these people is nuts</p>

<p>1.Plays for Celtics
2.Has had some streaky games with poor shooting ( even tho he does other things )</p>

Dude has been the first option on Boston for several tough playoff runs, then won a championship on top of his second gold medal and 1st team selection. Already a HOF career in the making.</p>

He just seems like a talented dude that works hard but having the title of being the best American younger player (he&rsquo;s the only american that made all-nba first team the past two seasons) made the media and fans fire at him. It&rsquo;s not his fault that his team is successful and he&rsquo;s rated so highly because of it.</p>

      <label for="lja2fq9" class="commentText"><p>But then look at his percentages during the season, he was a 38% shooter all year while bulked up…I think it just comes down to a cold stretch and maybe he was in his own head.</p>

      <label for="ljcy5ug" class="commentText"><p>I think that’s the case. It was a cold stretch that then got to his head and clearly at the Olympics was completely in his head and exacerbated by having to play a different role and having his minutes constantly changed. I think people are also underselling how much pressure was on this team, and specifically Tatum, during this playoff run. Then you go to the Olympics where he specifically is having to find a completely new role and that doesn’t exactly lend itself to sorting out a shooting slump. All he needs is a good handful of some early season games that will all be very low stakes and it won’t really matter if he goes <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>15</sub> on any given night. Then he’ll get his rhythm back in no time.</p>

If the GOAT shooter is prone to cold streaks then imo it’s not a huge reach to think that a just good to great shooter in Tatum could also just be in a shooting slump </p>

      <label for="ljai4v1" class="commentText"><p>Lot of shit he did was corny road to the championship but I cannot hate him to be honest because he&rsquo;s a young player who lives in the head space of mimicking his favorite players, which every one of us is doing. Maybe he&rsquo;s being %100 himself, still achieving his dreams of trying to be like Kobe by posing like that after winning the championship, we actually don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Its corny yes. But why not? I chewed my tshirt playing pick up basketball for years trying to mimic Kobe and let my tongue out driving to the hole mimicking Jordan. I wanted to be like Mike, be like Kobe. As a professional basketball player that at his level, yeah maybe he should not do that for his self image. But maybe he don&rsquo;t care as well. That&rsquo;s my take. He&rsquo;s a hard working man honest and humble man at the end of the day and I cannot hate on him because of that.</p>

      <label for="lja4hyw" class="commentText"><p>Nah not buying it bro. Kerr did the right thing</p>

<p>Tatum started in 3 of the 6 games, and its not like Tatum was playing exceptionally well. Both AD and Ant played less minutes per game and had a bigger impact than Tatum.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t blame Tatum for this, since he just came off a championship being the main guy playing an absurd 40 minutes per game. Dude was probably gassed.</p>

      <label for="lja5i59" class="commentText"><p>Nah I think it’s fair to criticize both Kerr’s actual rotations and his approach to them, but I don’t think it’s fair to suggest they were irrational or unjustifiable. I can think of several arguments even if I don’t agree. Also not sure what that has to do with his likeability.</p>
