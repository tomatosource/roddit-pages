<p>you have pro-Tatum fans who will genuinely claim that he’s the best player in the world which is just an absurd take even as a Celtics fan who loves JT</p>

<p>but then anti-Tatum fans call him a glorified role player who the Celtics could have won a title without, and will make you out to be insane if you consider him arguably a top 5 player</p>

<p>like what is it about this guy that turns everyone into a crazy person when they talk about him. it’s extra funny to me bc Tatum himself is one of the most calm and measured athletes I’ve ever seen, but the discourse around him is anything but</p>

Tatum might be the 5th best NBA player but he wasn&rsquo;t needed in a large role on the Olympic team and the idea that Kerr had to go because Tatum wasn&rsquo;t playing was crazy. Embiid didn&rsquo;t play a ton either and shouldn&rsquo;t have but you don&rsquo;t see as many Philly fans calling for Kerr&rsquo;s head as there were Tatum/Boston fans.</p>

<p>Most JT fans, even in the Celtics sub, are realistic about his standing among the top 10 players.  Top 5 is probably where we see him now.  This is for more serious discussions of course.</p>

<p>The hate comes from a) he&rsquo;s a Celtic, and b) because fans were defending Tatum when he gets  benched during the Olympics</p>

I usually call the best player on the last team standing the best player for that season. He deserves it. But does Tatum? No question he has the skill but does he have that killer instinct to just dominate? I don&rsquo;t think so. It just doesn&rsquo;t feel the same as the previous 3 years with Giannis, Steph and Jokic. It&rsquo;s more like the Celtics are so close every year that eventually it had to happen. And it did. But does anyone think it&rsquo;s going to be the next dynasty?</p>

      <label for="ljfn7k0" class="commentText"><p>idk if they’re gonna be a dynasty but they’re better set up to repeat/win multiple titles than any of the last few champions IMO</p>

<p>it’s true he’s probably the “worst” #1 on a champion in the last 10 years, I just think it’s stupid people act like it’s shameful to not be as good as Jokic, Giannis, Curry, LeBron, and KD</p>

<p>like those are all top 20 all-time players. no Tatum is not top 20 all-time good, but he’s still one of the 5 to 10 best players in the league, one of the best players of his generation, and maybe the most complete all-around player in the league today. and he is far from finished, he could definitely surpass Kawhi as his career continues</p>

<p>he’s worthy of being the best player on a champion. the league isn’t split into generational talents and bums</p>

<p>and finally, the killer instinct thing - how do you even quantify that? based on the way Tatum has performed most of the time when the chips are down throughout his career, I’d say he has plenty of killer instinct</p>

      <label for="ljc7c66" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s Prime PG with a maxed out luck stat. The definition for superstar is usually top 10ish player that can lead a team to a championship as the first option. With guys like PG or Dame the answer to whether or not they met those criteria was probably if they had a really good team with a second option almost as good as them. They&rsquo;d need a reasonable amount of injury luck too. Those guys were viewed as superstars, but that title was a formality cuz realistically, they would never get a ring. Tatum has ppl actually debating the validity of all of this since he pulled off the near-impossible with the help of the Celtics FO. He&rsquo;s also the best American player under 30. So he basically has all of these accolades and titles that are typically found on pantheon players while arguably not being a top 75 player all time.</p>

      <label for="ljdcxqn" class="commentText"><p>bc people have been saying that since Tatum entered the league and ignored that Tatum has evolved into a way better all-around player than PG ever was.</p>

<p>he’s bigger, stronger, faster, more durable, and more willing to do the dirty work. he’s a more efficient and higher volume scorer, a better finisher, a better ball-handler, a better passer, a better decision-maker, a better rebounder, a better screener, better at avoiding turnovers, better at playing through contact, better at getting to the line, better at switching 1-5, and better at guarding down low.</p>

<p>Tatum is also a better leader, a better 1st option and a better pressure performer. OP is ignoring that it wasn’t just bad luck with PG, a lot of his failures have come from him cracking under pressure bc he’s never been a very strong player mentally, and he’s never been good about taking accountability either. remember CJ Miles and Doc, or what he said about Harden coming in last year? you might think these things aren’t relevant to their quality but being a guy that contributes to team chemistry instead of hurting it is a major factor in winning.</p>

<p>the only things peak PG had over current Tatum are perimeter defense and maybe 3P shooting (which he’s really just as streaky at as Tatum). also their games barely even resemble each other anymore outside their at-times frustrating shot selection; Tatum is more like a homeless man’s LeBron than PG</p>

      <label for="ljcc3b2" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s really hard to judge him. He made the last 3 All-NBA 1st Teams and was close to the MVP conversation. And it seemed like he deserved it. But he was also 12th on team USA&rsquo;s depth chart and he looked bad while on the court. He was also chucking a lot of bricks in his last two finals appearances.</p>

<p>At times he looks like a clear top 5 player and other times it&rsquo;s hard to argue he&rsquo;s even top 20 when he&rsquo;s getting outplayed by Booker and Jaylen Brown.</p>

<p>If you want to talk about him as the face of the NBA, or an all time great, or whatever else that is going to be the unreasonable standard he is held to. If you want to be Kobe, or Lebron or Jordan, or whoever than part of that is being under a microscope.</p>

<p>You can’t have it both ways.</p>

<p>Ant got crushed for his performance in the playoffs. If he continues to fail to live up to the level that was set for him, the heat will get worse. Same goes for anybody else who openly asks for that.</p>

<p>You can’t be THAT guy and not have insane pressure. If the player insisting they are that guy isn’t good enough to be that guy, it comes off like this, but he quite literally is asking for that type of expectation.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s the model of what franchises that haven&rsquo;t drafted mvp candidates want from their guys. Superstar peaks with the mindset and humility to play unselfishly when he&rsquo;s not hot.</p>

<p>That does not, however, get you favorable looks when you put that guy in the same conversation as MJ and Kobe. Have some self awareness.</p>

<p>The point I was making is that Tatum absolutely does get put under the same microscope as Jordan and Lebron.  And that seems to be Tatum&rsquo;s fatal flaw - he&rsquo;s not Jordan or Lebron but people criticize him for minor flaws as if he should be.  But he&rsquo;s damn good - his resume is on cruise control to Top 50 all time player and Top 25 is extremely achievable.</p>

<p>Tatum himself has talked about being the face of the nba. What other standard should he be held to if he himself is saying shit like that?</p>

<p>If you aren’t good enough to be in that conversation, but you and your biggest fans insist on putting you into it, that’s the level of criticism you’re going to take. Im not sure why that is everybody else’s fault.</p>

<p>Fans didn’t start the Kobe stuff. Tatum did.</p>

<p>Fans didn’t start the face of the league thing, Tatum did.</p>

<p>He certainly has a lot of Celtics fans who follow his lead on those things, but when you literally do puff pieces about how it’s your crown to take, and you constantly do the Kobe thing, what else is going to happen?</p>

<p>I know it’s a ridiculous comparison. Tatum is the one who doesn’t seem to get that</p>

<p>E: also when Steph, KD, and Lebron are mentioned while discussing taking their spot, you should absolutely be out playing them or expect to get shit for it when you don’t even get any meaningful run.</p>

Oftentimes when Luka called for a screen it was to get Porzingis on him but Tatum would call out a switch and take the big man before Luka could get there. Takes a lot of intelligence and awareness but Wolves could’ve gotten better switches with that and using KAT in the Tatum role</p>

<p>But yeah, wearing Luka down definitely seems to be an important strategy when playing these Mavs.</p>

      <label for="ljbxdaq" class="commentText"><p>It’s a microcosm of NBA discourse as a whole I think. It’s like 80% of NBA fans have no idea how to communicate about basketball unless it’s negative and toxic.</p>

<p>The toxicity is woven into the fabric of basically every single media outlet/NBA news aggregator - the primary way that they talk about the league is through the lens of negativity and insults towards players to drive engagement, rather than positivity and celebratory of player/team achievements (with some exceptions obviously)</p>

<p>If you play NBA2k with randoms you’ll know what I’m talking about as well. I’ve never encountered a gaming community in all my life whose default stance is highly combative towards just about any other player they encounter in game, which is particularly weird considering it’s a team game where winning is MUCH easier if your team is working well together.</p>

<p>It almost feels like US Politics - it’s so hard to get a positive message out. The thing most people care about is hating The Others rather than anything substantive.</p>

<p>People are legitimately trying to argue that Tatum didn’t contribute to a title winning season because he didn’t win finals mvp.</p>

<p>For them, the argument is literally: “didn’t win finals mvp, so didn’t contribute”. The black and white mindset of some of these people is nuts</p>

<p>I can understand context which is why I don’t jump to conclusions about a player’s standing just because he shot poorly during a 5 game stretch in the finals.</p>

<p>But he did lead the team in every major stat. So you saying he didn’t contribute like expected is exactly the stupid shit I’m talking about lol</p>

That is just nonsense hate.</p>

<p>And for the record, I view Tatum as a flawed superstar that isn’t quite top 5 but is firmly within the top 10. He’s a great player who isn’t quite on the level of Jokic, Giannis, etc.</p>

<p>I love hating on LeBron. It&rsquo;s a sport.</p>

<p>The year Miami lost, ESPN Radio in my town had a 3hr block where they let people call in with LeBron jokes.</p>

<p>Relax. Tatum isn&rsquo;t nearly that hated. He&rsquo;s just corny.</p>

Giannis is run and dunk man no skill, Embiid is a flopper, Jokic fat white boi no defense, Curry a front runner. Literally every Top 5 or 10 player gets hate. Nobody gives a fuck about Sam Hauser cause he ain‘t worth to hate, you have to be good for that</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to have a cornball superstar on the Hornets given our current situation.  Hater is the right word.  Trying to drag down Tatum to make himself feel better.</p>

<p>The fucking nerve of a Hornets fan to shit on a guy for being low key, drama and domestic violence free.</p>

It finds zero value in actually being African, casually tossing that aside in favor of attempting to appropriate another people&rsquo;s story. It&rsquo;s as if the idea of being African is so self-evidently worthless in their eyes that they can only find respect and value in a non-African heritage.</p>

      <label for="ljcy5ug" class="commentText"><p>I think that’s the case. It was a cold stretch that then got to his head and clearly at the Olympics was completely in his head and exacerbated by having to play a different role and having his minutes constantly changed. I think people are also underselling how much pressure was on this team, and specifically Tatum, during this playoff run. Then you go to the Olympics where he specifically is having to find a completely new role and that doesn’t exactly lend itself to sorting out a shooting slump. All he needs is a good handful of some early season games that will all be very low stakes and it won’t really matter if he goes <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>15</sub> on any given night. Then he’ll get his rhythm back in no time.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re not comparing players, you&rsquo;re comparing front offices. Tatum didn&rsquo;t make the trades that got them Porzingis, Jrue. Tatum didn&rsquo;t create this insane version of Derrick White. Also I don&rsquo;t get why you&rsquo;re comparing the teams either.

      <label for="ljafr6q" class="commentText"><p>The fact that he&rsquo;s a prototypical wing in the modern NBA and modern basketball. Best player on the best team that BREEZED to an title by a wide margin (only team that won 60+ games)&hellip; But he&rsquo;s getting DNP&rsquo;s in Olympics is just down-right WEIRD lol. It&rsquo;s just weird that the coaches decided he can&rsquo;t contribute anything meaningful.</p>

      <label for="ljai4v1" class="commentText"><p>Lot of shit he did was corny road to the championship but I cannot hate him to be honest because he&rsquo;s a young player who lives in the head space of mimicking his favorite players, which every one of us is doing. Maybe he&rsquo;s being %100 himself, still achieving his dreams of trying to be like Kobe by posing like that after winning the championship, we actually don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Its corny yes. But why not? I chewed my tshirt playing pick up basketball for years trying to mimic Kobe and let my tongue out driving to the hole mimicking Jordan. I wanted to be like Mike, be like Kobe. As a professional basketball player that at his level, yeah maybe he should not do that for his self image. But maybe he don&rsquo;t care as well. That&rsquo;s my take. He&rsquo;s a hard working man honest and humble man at the end of the day and I cannot hate on him because of that.</p>
