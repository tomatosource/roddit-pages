</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I’m not knowledgeable enough about the league to say if this is the answer, but I think maybe Jrue Holiday is a good person to bring up? He’s mainly a defensive player and does have six all-defensive team nods, but he’s never won DPOY. He only has two All-Star appearances and no All-NBA team nods. He’s been a key role player on two championship teams but never in his career has he ever been the main guy. Then again, from the discussion I’ve read people seem to think Holiday is very borderline so it’s possible he does end up in the Hall after all.</p>

<p>Who else am I not thinking of?</p>

      <label for="la726t9" class="commentText"><p>I disagree. If he had a couple more seasons at that level, sure. But you’d effectively be giving him a career award for a single season in this case. The MVP is already the recognition of that season.</p>

<p>Other than that he had a decent rookie season, 1.5 run of the mill all star seasons, and then a decade as a 6th man type on mediocre teams. No rings (barely any playoff wins), no awards outside that season, nothing interesting in his career stats.</p>

<p>I get it - he was derailed by injury and the Hall lets in anybody. But Rose would be the weakest case possible, truly on the back of one year. I can see it going either way.</p>

      <label for="la752ay" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not even that his career was derailed, it&rsquo;s just that the Hall lets anyone in and Drose was the youngest MVP in NBA history. If the purpose of the Hall of Fame is to preserve the history of the game as completely as possible, and that&rsquo;s the reason why so many guys make it in, then I don&rsquo;t see why Derrick Rose can&rsquo;t be included.</p>

<p>I mean, for what it&rsquo;s worth, we may not see a player that young dominate the league like that ever again. Legends of the game who were noted as transitioning to professional play well, like Kareem, Lebron, Larry, Magic, MJ, etc. never won THAT young. Hell, not to say Luka belongs in this conversation, but Luka was already a league MVP by the time he was drafted, and he STILL hasn&rsquo;t won MVP. It&rsquo;s not even about &ldquo;what could&rsquo;ve been,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s what was, if only for a season.</p>

      <label for="la78q4k" class="commentText"><p>At the same time, it was one of the weakest MVP awards. You can’t look at the stat lines that year and say Rose deserved it over LeBron, and this is coming from a Celtics fan. Also, the game is played on both sides of the ball, and even if you argue the counting stats are close (they’re not that close) LeBrons defense clears Rose’s.</p>

<p><sup>25</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>.<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.0/0.6 with 3.4 TOV/G on 55% TS; .208 WS/48, BPM 6.8</p>

<p>Vs</p>

<p>26.<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>.0/7.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub>.6 with 3.6 TOV/G on 59.4% TS; .244 WS/48, BPM 8.1.</p>

<p>And LeBron came in 3rd. He would have won 5 straight MVPs if he won this one.</p>

<p>I’d argue Luka’s this season was better than Rose in 11. Many player seasons that don’t end up winning mvp were better than Rose in 11</p>

      <label for="la76fzz" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think rose deserves to get in.  If a player with 5 all nba teams in 12 years to rose’s 1 all nba team in 15 years , who finished his college career as the school’s leader in points, assists, and steals.  And was the first player to have their jersey retired by the university doesn’t get into the Basketball hall of fame then Rose doesn’t either.  I’m talking about Kevin Johnson.    It’s a separate issue and I’m not saying everyone does it but people look a little too fondly at Rose’s career.  It was a great 3 year run but that was it.  He is a great “what could have been” player.  His accolades are a bit comparable to what Ben Simmons has now (3 all stars, ROY, 1 all nba,) Simmons has 2 all defensive teams and finished 2nd one year for DPOY.  In less than half the time that Rose played.  Nobody is saying Simmons is hall of fame worthy.</p>

<p>id reckon probably sabonis? unless he can bring sacramento to a conference finals at least once and get out of the 1st round more often, i think he&rsquo;s not a lock to be in the hall of fame. jalen brunson needs to play the same level for about 4 or 5 more seasons before he&rsquo;ll be considered a hall of fame. the other all nba players are either a sure lock already or still very young that they can still build a name for themself</p>
