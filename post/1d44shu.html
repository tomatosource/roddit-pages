      <label for="l6bubza" class="commentText"><p>The luxury tax penalties during the Warriors run were much more lenient. Basically they had to pay more money and didn&rsquo;t have access to certain midlevels. Now, the penalties are much harsher. Your picks get frozen, you can&rsquo;t aggregate salaries in a trade, the financial penalties are even higher, etc.</p>

<p>But basically before the new CBA there was just one apron and all that really increased if you spent too much was that you&rsquo;d have to pay a higher rate on luxury tax penalties. Now in this new CBA there&rsquo;s a second apron which really fucks over team building if you go past it.</p>

<p>Heres a few things that it does:
-Can&rsquo;t aggregate salaries to send OUT in a trade.</p>

<p>-The Pick up to 7 years in the future is frozen (can&rsquo;t be traded).</p>

<p>-If you spend 2 years in the second apron, your pick automatically gets moved to last in the first round.</p>

<p>-Can&rsquo;t use trade exceptions from previous years or cash in trades</p>

<p>-Even higher luxury tax penalty.</p>

<p>So basically if you&rsquo;re not constantly competing for a championship, it really makes it brutal to improve at all.</p>

So second apron teams are limited to 1:1 trades that reduce their cap or to breaking up their core for multiple players.  It also eliminates the MLE/BAE completely.  So second apron teams are limited to draft picks and minimum vets to add to their team.</p>

The Nuggets would be barely over the second apron and they may have to shuffle some of their role players to get under. Phoenix is the team in the most trouble and they should be given they built their roster around three max players.</p>

<p>Personally I&rsquo;d much rather see contenders have to get more creative and constantly rebuild the parts around their stars and have a higher chance at year-over-year parity than not.</p>

<p>I like this idea in theory as well but the second apron is going to inevitably punish teams that draft well in a short period of time and then have to pay all their games at the same-ish time.  Nugget are bumping into this problem now with Murray and Jokic.  The Thunder have to see that problem coming soon so they better win a title with the group soon or they&rsquo;re going to be in cap hell real quick.</p>

<p>I really wish there had been a &ldquo;drafter player&rdquo; exception or something like that where players that are with the team they drafted who sign a supermax or max deal don&rsquo;t have all of their salary counted toward the tax or don&rsquo;t count toward apron calculations.  Would encourage and reward good drafting and player development and limit super teams.</p>

<p>Under the old CBA, if you&rsquo;re 10 million into the tax, you might have to pay 5 million extra dollars to the League the first year and it climbs to 20 million after like four years. Now the numbers are more like 10 and 40</p>

<p>If you look at the big levers:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>lose the $5M taxpayer exception&hellip; How often does this guy really matter?  Celtics don&rsquo;t currently have one.  Mavs split their (full) exception to Exum (non-factor) and Curry (gone). Wolves used it (full) on Brown and Milton, traded away for Morris (non-factor).  At best it&rsquo;s a bit of cash for trade fodder, but if you&rsquo;re over second apron you probably have plenty of that anyways.</p></li>

<li><p>Not being able to trade a first round pick 7 years away&hellip; arguably the biggest one as you can only trade at most 3 future firsts instead of 4 at any one time.  But if you&rsquo;ve already got your championship core, I question how much this really matters.</p></li>

<li><p>No wiggle room on salary matching for trades.  100% salary coming back maximum.  This effectively cuts out trading up for stars, and will make the occasional deal more difficult, but it hardly limits anything.  Like if Jrue declines in 2 years, Celtics can still just trade his <span class="math inline">\(35M for any player making \)</span>35M or less.  It also incentivizes teams to overpay the existing roster so they have more trade options.</p></li>

<li><p>If you stay in second apron 3 times in 5 years, your picks move to end of round.  Theoretically if you&rsquo;re over the second apron that long, you&rsquo;re already picking in the 27-30 range anyways.  Again, not a big deal.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You don&rsquo;t go into the second apron if you aren&rsquo;t a genuine contender.  But if you are, go nuts.  It&rsquo;s not that big of a deal.</p>

      <label for="l6c3q9k" class="commentText"><p>I mean it does impact team building. Every consideration once you&rsquo;re in the second apron matters. When the Celtics have to pay White/Tatum&rsquo;s new extension/ a new deal for KP, they probably won&rsquo;t be able to offer Hauser or whatever role player their market value because the luxury tax penalties are harsher. Same for a team like Denver. Gordon has a player option after next year and Murray also will need a new extension and that&rsquo;s before even KCP&rsquo;s new deal. Not every team has an owner like Lacob or Ballmer who will just pay whatever penalty comes with the luxury tax. And if a team like Denver who is a contender but just lost in the second round wants to upgrade, they can&rsquo;t really do that without trading away one of their core guys. They can&rsquo;t combine a Zeke Nnaji and whatever other salary to get someone who could help more.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s more just a general taxpayer issue than a second apron issue.  There&rsquo;s no additional tax on second apron excess, it&rsquo;s still just standard luxury tax.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just talking about the specific second apron penalties to discourage obscene spending.  The existing financial penalties are already enough for some teams, but the second apron penalties are supposed to be there to discourage everybody.  I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re strong enough to get that job done - Warriors still would have blown through it happily to get their rings, as the Celtics are likely poised to do too.</p>

<p>I mean these are two completely different points in the Warriors dynasty, they obviously weren&rsquo;t eating the luxury tax when they were under the cap to sign KD. They ate the tax after already establishing one of the best dynasties in the modern NBA. The Nuggets have 1 ring and no other finals appearances, the Warriors had 4 rings in 6 finals appearances, they&rsquo;re in completely different positions.</p>

<p>They paid a total of $45m in tax in the history of their franchise by the time they won their 3rd ring with Steph. They&rsquo;ve paid more than half a billion in luxury tax in the last 3 years. Yeah they were making the tax payments, but its not comparable. The massive tax payments they&rsquo;ve been eating have been since the dynasty was already established, its a totally different situation than the Nuggets now.</p>

<p>KCP is probably our most replaceable starter, but it would hurt a lot. Christian Braun would likely slide into his role, and while he defends around KCPs level (and better against some guys like Ant) he doesn&rsquo;t have the same shooting threat, which can be an issue.  But it would also cause our bench to lose its most impactful player, and the bench is already trash lol. Losing KCP would make it so we basically have to have significant growth from Watson (this seems likely to me, he is getting so much better month by month), Strawther (he was playing solid minutes and looking solid before an injury sidelined him), and either Gilespie or Pickett.</p>

      <label for="l6c75ei" class="commentText"><p>Are they?  Bit too early to tell.  Beating a bunch of shitty East teams, none of whom had their best player for the whole series, isn&rsquo;t very telling.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised at all of the Celtics without Porzingis can&rsquo;t beat whichever team comes out of the West.  With Porzingis they are crazy good, without him I am not so sure.</p>

<p>And assuming Porzingis health at some point in the future seems pretty insane lol.</p>

But there were a lot of teams who were competing but not even in the range of being realistic contenders. The Dynamic Duo era is so much better for the league and way more competitive. There’s multiple real contenders and dark horse teams actually feel like they have a real shot at winning it all.</p>

      <label for="l6c3dl3" class="commentText"><p>The new structure of the salary cap with the 2 aprons is basically a dynasty killer.  I just don’t see how you can get the depth and role players needed to form a dynasty.  The problem is that you can get cheap great role players like Bruce  brown for Denver or Derrick Jones Jr for Dallas, but as soon as they prove how good they are, they have now priced themselves out of the dynasty team.  You need to keep scraping the bottom of the barrel for depth hoping you find another diamond in the rough, or you draft your depth, which is a coin toss if you manage to get a guy who will be good in the dynasty’s time table.  See the Warriors as an example there.  I believe in Kuminga, TJD, and Podz becoming great players, but it might take 5 more years, and that isn’t on the time table of Steph, Klay, and Dray.</p>

      <label for="l6c8rkf" class="commentText"><p>I want to say that this is why Presti is hoarding second round picks.  In the course of this CBA, I think those picks will be very valuable for contenders up against the apron to  fill out their rosters/role players.  Or in general, to have a continual chest of picks to replenish the roster after role players ascend and get too expensive.</p>

      <label for="l6cri1l" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, its really interesting.  I think with increased parity, marginal improvement will become much more important.  You obviously need a superstar to win, but over time, as max players get spread out among the teams, development will hopefully become a necessity.  Smaller market teams that arent free agent destinations like OKC and SA already rely heavily on this, but I think this CBA&rsquo;s second apron penalties will require the big market teams to lean that way as well.  Of course, it would be nice to have some exceptions for home grown talent and maybe limiting cap hits on such players.  But, I think while everyone is focusing on this CBA being a &ldquo;dynasty killer&rdquo;, it will actually benefit complete, well run organizations instead of just allowing teams to rely on being free agent destinations, etc.  The next dynasty under this CBA will come out of a team operating like the Patriots.</p>

      <label for="l6crpvh" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, players on fringe-level contracts who significantly over perform their level of paycheck is probably the most important thing for a championship these days. Siakam was on under 2 million salary in 2019, and now we can look at Naz Reid or Derrick Jones Jr’s contracts</p>

<p>But very interestingly, the Celtics are not really following this trend? 4 of their starting 5 have contracts within the 30-40 mil range this season, which lets them pay the rest of the roster reasonably well. Comparing pay checks for Suns starting 3 to Celtics starting 5 is very funny. I think they have the money for Luke Kornet next season? Their finances are really strong for next season</p>

      <label for="l6crb7a" class="commentText"><p>this is very well said. i’d like to add it seems to be almost incentivizing the idea of role players not taking pay raises if a franchise wants to be a dynasty. basically the inverse of what you said about them pricing themselves out. the way the new cba is structuring things dynasty teams will no longer be formed from three stars joining up a la miami, golden state, etc. but rather role players choosing continuity over pay raises in free agency.</p>

It does get boring if the same team is winning every year but what we&rsquo;re going to see is teams that don&rsquo;t have those endearing second-tier/role players that fans get attached to for several seasons. Teams will only be associated with stars, even in their home markets. And I think it&rsquo;s more interesting if there are some perennial goliaths that sometimes get taken down. That&rsquo;s interesting. Teams that are more or less even fighting is good for single games but not for narratives.</p>

You&rsquo;ll also need an incredible coach who can repeatedly fit flawed rejects and poor rookies into his system, the scouts to find those players and the FO smart enough to get them without paying the &ldquo;championship&rdquo; tax (the price goes up because of how good a job your scouts always do)</p>

<p>Clearly seeding was not the answer to the western conference this year. Not at all clear that unhealthy with the 1 seed is better than healthy with the 5 seed.</p>

You cant pay MPJ that much where he hasnt developed other aspects of his offensive game. If they can flip MPJ and acquire 2-3 solid role players while reducing their team salary they should consider it.</p>

I don&rsquo;t know how much we can take away from this recent (presumably) disappointing early exit. They&rsquo;re obviously good enough to win a championship but they aren&rsquo;t prohibitive favourites to even make it out of their conference the way a Celtics or 2010s Warriors were. They evidently aren&rsquo;t even WCF locks. If it were up to me I&rsquo;d spend the money since there&rsquo;s no guarantee they&rsquo;ll ever be this good again.</p>

<p>What else can they even do? Could a MPJ trade be in the works? He was pretty terrible in the second round.</p>

He’s a good player but has almost zero self creation skill and doesn’t help with the glaring issue the team has - no real ball handling or initiation outside Jokic and Murray.</p>

<p>Thing is, I say “mess”, but they still easily could be in the Finals right now, and arguably could have won the title this year too. So I get the hesitancy to blow it up and trade a key piece. But that’s their move. Trading MPJ is the only way out.</p>

<p>I think they need to make development more of a priority next year regardless of what happens with KCP. Being the 1 seed or 4 seed doesn’t matter much. Just carve out consistent minutes for Peyton Watson, Braun, Strawther, Nnaji, try to get one of them at a point where you’d trust them for 20+ minutes.</p>

<p>I do think this year gives us pause about whether its worth grinding yourself down in a 1 seed race. Home court advantage didn&rsquo;t seem that important this year. I think we definitely get to the WCF if we beat the spurs to claim the 1 seed, but I also think that we could have tanked a few weeks at the end of the season while resting Jokic and Murray, slid in to the 3 or 4 seed and been much better set up to get to the WCF.</p>

Also MPJ is only 25 so there is a real possibility we trade him and he absolutely balls out for another squad, recency bias about that last series aside MPJ was great during the first round and during the regular season in which he play 81 games for us.</p>

<p>In my mind the only real question about our starting line up next year is KCP and how much we are willing to pay to keep him around.</p>

<p>IMO the bottom line is the MPJ played 81 games for us last year in the regular season and was consistently pretty good. Maybe not all the way up to his salary but not nearly as far off as some of our fans will say. Also he is only 25 so he has a ton of upside, a lot of people are discounting the very real possibility that if we trade him he absolutely balls out on another team.</p>

<p>We were a healthy Jamal away from the conference finals, and even with the calf strain we were one quarter away.</p>

<p>There’s no need to change the key pieces. Instead they just need cheap bench depth</p>

      <label for="l6cdamk" class="commentText"><p>Agreed fuck the down votes. The loss to the wolves had very little to do with MPJ. We probably shouldn&rsquo;t have grinded ourselves down in March competing for the 1 seed, its basically as simple as that. We used way too much gas gunning for the 1 seed and didn&rsquo;t have enough left in the tank for the playoffs.</p>

<p>That obviously raises some issues for the franchise, and those were well-voiced earlier this month by team president Josh Kroenke, the son of franchise owner Stan Kroenke.</p>

<p>“The core of this team was assembled under a different CBA, and we drafted and we developed, and we built this team under a different set of rules,” Kroenke told reporters. “Those rules have kinda changed on the fly. Last summer, it wasn’t quite as pertinent as it is going be this summer … There’s going to be some constraints coming in with the new collective bargaining agreement and the new rules that we’re going to have to be very aware of and we’re going to have to plan accordingly. They do make it difficult to retool a championship roster on the fly.”</p>

<p>If that didn’t sound like a commitment to go into the second apron if necessary, that’s because it wasn’t. Kroenke had further opportunities to do so later on during the Nuggets’ end-of-season news conference and didn’t in those times either.</p>

<p>General manager Calvin Booth was asked if the Nuggets would go over the second apron to keep Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and he said that the team would like to bring him back. Caldwell-Pope has a $15.4 million player option for next season and can likely make more on the open market if he exercises it.</p>

<p>“We spend a lot of time looking at second apron and all that stuff,” Booth said. “For me personally, it’s win a championship, one. Two, we have to look at the overall financial picture. And three, second apron. I know the second apron is daunting and there’s all kind of restrictions, but I don’t think that’s first on our priority list. KCP has been a great addition the last couple of years. We’d love to have him back. We’re going to take a hard look at what that looks like.”</p>

      <label for="l6cg48o" class="commentText"><p>Yeah that&rsquo;s not true, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be 1 for 1 and it doesn&rsquo;t have to match dollar for dollar.  You can take on any salary up the amount going out for as many players as you want.  For example, if they traded MPJ to the Pistons, they could take back as many contracts as they want, as long as the combined salary doesn&rsquo;t exceed the 35.8 million that Porter is set to make next year.</p>

<p>Basically if you&rsquo;re above the 2nd apron, the rules are you can&rsquo;t aggregate salaries in a trade to match salary and you can&rsquo;t exceed the salary you&rsquo;re sending out in the trade,  as well as not having the taxpayer mle, not being able to signed bought out players who made more than the MLE, and if you&rsquo;re past the 2nd apron twice in a 4 year period, you can no longer trade your draft pick 7 years away, and it&rsquo;s automatically moved to the end of the first round.</p>

Even teams that got their core pieces via drafting or trading of drafted players will get screwed by this second apron too.</p>

<p>Only the Thunder are likely to escape getting screwed by this since they can use the picks they keep to add new role player pieces to surround Shai, Chet and Jdub once their current role player pieces need to get new contracts.</p>

<p>Just an absolute joke of a CBA negotiated by Grant Williams and CJ Mccollum and the NBPA. Only winners here are cheap owners.</p>

      <label for="l6c0udi" class="commentText"><p>the most the cap can rise in any given season is 10% I believe. That would be realistically the only saving grace to keep MPJ. Also if you guys can lock Murray into an extension vs waiting until next summer that would help.</p>

      <label for="l6c0khz" class="commentText"><p>Not really that simple. Even with a max 10% cap increase for the next few seasons, Nuggets are still prob a 2nd apron team unless MPJ is moved or AG isn’t extended. Murray and AG’s extensions will come as a % of the cap after the tv deal kicks in too.</p>

      <label for="l6byb1b" class="commentText"><p>Hoping KCP will pick up his option and run this thing back one more year.</p>

<p>Malone not playing Nnaji consistently was his fatal flaw this year IMO. If he sucks, he sucks. Not like they were getting backup big production before this. If he could’ve even given them 8 minutes a game, we may be talking about Denver-Dallas rn.</p>
