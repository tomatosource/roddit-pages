      <label for="l6scqly" class="commentText"><p>I also think he suffered a bit from being a bit ahead of the curve in terms of what&rsquo;s valued for a 5 on defense. He&rsquo;s a good rim protector, but the best part of his defensive game is that he can go out to the perimeter and still hold up pretty well, which just isn&rsquo;t really something that was valued as much for 5s until the Warriors really pushed small ball to the forefront (by which time he was already a bit past his prime). If his prime were in the current era, I feel like he&rsquo;d have made a few more all-defense teams than he did.</p>

      <label for="l6sc97h" class="commentText"><p>Maybe Bam. Though I don’t think it’s a perfect comparison because Bam has 5 all defensive nods. But I do think Horford was a more versatile offensively and better playmaker.</p>

<p>But kind of like that tier of player. Solid dependable, but not going to ever take over like an AD level guy.</p>

      <label for="l6sibvv" class="commentText"><p>Bam&rsquo;s a good defensive comparison IMO - he just has his prime in an era where that ability to switch and stick with guys out at the perimeter is more valued than it was during Horford&rsquo;s prime. I do think Bam&rsquo;s better than Horford was at his peak on that side of the court, but stylistically, they fill similar roles.</p>

<p>The offensive comparison&rsquo;s definitely a little tricky, though. Brook Lopez in his stint with us is the closest in terms of being efficient both as a shooter and as a post player, but that&rsquo;s not perfect because it doesn&rsquo;t account for Horford&rsquo;s playmaking and passing.</p>

<p>He may have had better play making, but he was a significantly worse athlete. To the point where I don’t even think the comparison makes sense.</p>

<p>I think if you asked all 30 GMs who they’d rather have on their team, peak Al Horford, or Bam. It would be a unanimous vote for Bam.</p>

<p>Like the comment below me stated; a closer comp would be Brooke Lopez.</p>

      <label for="l6sl8l0" class="commentText"><p>Horford led the team in FG% and BPG, both by a slim margin. I’d argue that Millsap was clearly their best player, and that Teague had a decent argument too. They had 4 all stars.</p>

<p>I’m also not sure we can confidently say that they would have made the finals. The 2015 hawks were the quintessential regulars season team. Even so, nobody considered the hawks a contender (outside of Atlanta).</p>

<p>I guess you could nitpick that point, but the general point is that Al Horford and Bam are not in the same tier. Horford is a borderline all star who benefited from playing with winning teams. Bam is an all star.</p>

      <label for="l6sn9kn" class="commentText"><p>Borderline as in, he made it some years of his prime and didn’t in others. And he never started. I don’t think it’s controversial to call Horford a borderline all star. It also helps that he played in the weakest era for big men, maybe ever.</p>

<p>More importantly, if you made a composite of Al’s best seasons, they still wouldn’t be as good as Bam 2 years ago. I know there’s an element of his game that doesn’t show up in the box score/advanced stats. But at a certain point the stats tell the story.</p>

<p>I’m not out here saying that Horford was a terrible player. He was really, really good. I just don’t think he’s in the same category as Bam.</p>

<p>If he’s healthy, he’s going to make the All Star team. You know this though, and are just dug into the position.</p>

<p>Again, you can disagree about whether the hawks were contenders, or whether or not Horford was indeed a “borderline” all star player. But I can’t see any reasonable argument for Horford being the same talent level.</p>

      <label for="l6sci0n" class="commentText"><p>Just…solid. Was honestly like a discount Timmy D in a lot of ways. Boring, methodical game, but what he did worked. Never flashy statistically. Always had great defense. He wasn’t a perennial star in terms of selections but always had the impact of a fringe one.</p>

<p>Prime Horford on the Hawks was way more of a post-up and interior guy than what he is now <em>(a three-point specialist)</em>. He was also noticeably switchable, an advantage he’s lost over the past couple years.</p>

<p>I’d argue his early Celtics years were his best - he was at his peak defensively and developed a good three ball. He was the stabilizer and non-flashy complementary piece to a lot of electric talents on the team <em>(IT4, Kyrie, the younger Jays, Rozier, etc.)</em>.</p>

      <label for="l6ss4zt" class="commentText"><p>That’s a good comparison. His midrange was super solid like Duncan’s. I typically compare Horford with guys like Marc Gasol and Brook Lopez since they have a similar career trajectory and style of play. They also all developed a 3 ball in the mid-2010s after having a great midrange game. Solid defenders, decent at passing the ball, can post up but mostly stopped later in their careers, and good at shooting anywhere on the floor.</p>

<p>Before Butler took that 3, there was another fast break a few plays prior, Butler dove in and got an easy basket in the paint, on that 3 play, Horford was ready to challenge Butler in the paint so he was backpedaling into the paint, Butler took advantage of the opportunity and shot the 3.</p>

<p>He missed, but it sure as hell looked like it was going in, I’ll take that any day.</p>

He literally did not do anything else differently than what he does now. His game did not need to adapt for less athleticism. Hes always been a good teammate, he came to work everyday RELIABLY. I watch a lot of games where guys start doing stuff that they&rsquo;ve never done before out of the blue. Just like Lebron that shit ANNOYS me.</p>

<p>He’s honestly not that different these days, aside from a more deadly 3-ball and he’s lost a step. But you’ll still see him for stretches at a time where he just makes plays on both ends of the court and seemingly controls a game without doing anything flashy.</p>

Since 3 of their 4 PG&rsquo;s were hurt, Al literally brought the ball up as backup PG after starting as center. Plus, he hit a buzzer beater for the win to cap off a 20 pt comeback that game. The versatility he had at his peak was rare.</p>
