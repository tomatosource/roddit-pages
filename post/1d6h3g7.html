      <label for="l6scqly" class="commentText"><p>I also think he suffered a bit from being a bit ahead of the curve in terms of what&rsquo;s valued for a 5 on defense. He&rsquo;s a good rim protector, but the best part of his defensive game is that he can go out to the perimeter and still hold up pretty well, which just isn&rsquo;t really something that was valued as much for 5s until the Warriors really pushed small ball to the forefront (by which time he was already a bit past his prime). If his prime were in the current era, I feel like he&rsquo;d have made a few more all-defense teams than he did.</p>

      <label for="l6sibvv" class="commentText"><p>Bam&rsquo;s a good defensive comparison IMO - he just has his prime in an era where that ability to switch and stick with guys out at the perimeter is more valued than it was during Horford&rsquo;s prime. I do think Bam&rsquo;s better than Horford was at his peak on that side of the court, but stylistically, they fill similar roles.</p>

<p>The offensive comparison&rsquo;s definitely a little tricky, though. Brook Lopez in his stint with us is the closest in terms of being efficient both as a shooter and as a post player, but that&rsquo;s not perfect because it doesn&rsquo;t account for Horford&rsquo;s playmaking and passing.</p>

<p>He may have had better play making, but he was a significantly worse athlete. To the point where I don’t even think the comparison makes sense.</p>

<p>I think if you asked all 30 GMs who they’d rather have on their team, peak Al Horford, or Bam. It would be a unanimous vote for Bam.</p>

<p>Like the comment below me stated; a closer comp would be Brooke Lopez.</p>

      <label for="l6sl8l0" class="commentText"><p>Horford led the team in FG% and BPG, both by a slim margin. I’d argue that Millsap was clearly their best player, and that Teague had a decent argument too. They had 4 all stars.</p>

<p>I’m also not sure we can confidently say that they would have made the finals. The 2015 hawks were the quintessential regulars season team. Even so, nobody considered the hawks a contender (outside of Atlanta).</p>

<p>I guess you could nitpick that point, but the general point is that Al Horford and Bam are not in the same tier. Horford is a borderline all star who benefited from playing with winning teams. Bam is an all star.</p>

      <label for="l6sn9kn" class="commentText"><p>Borderline as in, he made it some years of his prime and didn’t in others. And he never started. I don’t think it’s controversial to call Horford a borderline all star. It also helps that he played in the weakest era for big men, maybe ever.</p>

<p>More importantly, if you made a composite of Al’s best seasons, they still wouldn’t be as good as Bam 2 years ago. I know there’s an element of his game that doesn’t show up in the box score/advanced stats. But at a certain point the stats tell the story.</p>

<p>I’m not out here saying that Horford was a terrible player. He was really, really good. I just don’t think he’s in the same category as Bam.</p>

<p>If he’s healthy, he’s going to make the All Star team. You know this though, and are just dug into the position.</p>

<p>Again, you can disagree about whether the hawks were contenders, or whether or not Horford was indeed a “borderline” all star player. But I can’t see any reasonable argument for Horford being the same talent level.</p>

      <label for="l6sci0n" class="commentText"><p>Just…solid. Was honestly like a discount Timmy D in a lot of ways. Boring, methodical game, but what he did worked. Never flashy statistically. Always had great defense. He wasn’t a perennial star in terms of selections but always had the impact of a fringe one.</p>

<p>Prime Horford on the Hawks was way more of a post-up and interior guy than what he is now <em>(a three-point specialist)</em>. He was also noticeably switchable, an advantage he’s lost over the past couple years.</p>

<p>I’d argue his early Celtics years were his best - he was at his peak defensively and developed a good three ball. He was the stabilizer and non-flashy complementary piece to a lot of electric talents on the team <em>(IT4, Kyrie, the younger Jays, Rozier, etc.)</em>.</p>

      <label for="l6ss4zt" class="commentText"><p>That’s a good comparison. His midrange was super solid like Duncan’s. I typically compare Horford with guys like Marc Gasol and Brook Lopez since they have a similar career trajectory and style of play. They also all developed a 3 ball in the mid-2010s after having a great midrange game. Solid defenders, decent at passing the ball, can post up but mostly stopped later in their careers, and good at shooting anywhere on the floor.</p>

<p>Before Butler took that 3, there was another fast break a few plays prior, Butler dove in and got an easy basket in the paint, on that 3 play, Horford was ready to challenge Butler in the paint so he was backpedaling into the paint, Butler took advantage of the opportunity and shot the 3.</p>

<p>He missed, but it sure as hell looked like it was going in, I’ll take that any day.</p>

He literally did not do anything else differently than what he does now. His game did not need to adapt for less athleticism. Hes always been a good teammate, he came to work everyday RELIABLY. I watch a lot of games where guys start doing stuff that they&rsquo;ve never done before out of the blue. Just like Lebron that shit ANNOYS me.</p>

Since 3 of their 4 PG&rsquo;s were hurt, Al literally brought the ball up as backup PG after starting as center. Plus, he hit a buzzer beater for the win to cap off a 20 pt comeback that game. The versatility he had at his peak was rare.</p>

      <label for="l6scj7t" class="commentText"><p>That’s tough, cause his best 2 seasons individually he wasn’t named an all star but when he helped carry the Hawks to 60 wins and deferred some personal stats to Brand and Milsap he was an all star.  He was a a really solid all star level player who didn’t need to be involved in the offense to be effective.  Similar to his role now, just at a higher level of play</p>

<p>He’s honestly not that different these days, aside from a more deadly 3-ball and he’s lost a step. But you’ll still see him for stretches at a time where he just makes plays on both ends of the court and seemingly controls a game without doing anything flashy.</p>

<p>Can defend Embiid and also switch onto smaller guys. Can roll or pop for 3. Great passer. Great teammate.</p>

<p>Honestly one of my fav players ever, the Kyrie Horford connection was also amazing, they had a great two man game.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/pFnNhRwNME4?si=dhw83uJseXeq3w-i" target="_blank">Horford Kyrie Connection</a></p>

<p>Here’s a great clip, from 0:55 seconds on you can see how great Al Horford is at setting picks, popping, and making the right pass to Kyrie. They had a lot of these awesome two-man plays.</p>

      <label for="l6svxi7" class="commentText"><p>I would be curious how Horford&rsquo;s career would be viewed had it started in this era of the NBA rather than when it did. He is now known as a stretch 5 who can hang on the perimeter but he didn&rsquo;t start taking 3&rsquo;s until he was nearly 30, during his last year in Atlanta and after the Warriors run made shooting at every position a big priority. Lots of centers from his era tried developing an outside shot but he was one of the few who excelled at it.</p>

<p>So when you talk about his &ldquo;peak&rdquo; it came in a different era of the game where he played a different playstyle than he does now.</p>
