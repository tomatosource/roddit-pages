</blockquote>

<p>Depending on your definition of &ldquo;limited offensively&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m not sure I entirely agree with that statement.</p>

<p>Ben Simmons is low hanging fruit at this point but he&rsquo;s on a max and is arguably even more limited offensively in the half court relative to his position than Gobert</p>

<p>OG Anunoby is actually paid slightly more than Gobert and is a negative player when he tries to create his own shot. He&rsquo;s essentially just a play finisher/jump shooter</p>

<p>Dillon Brooks is an atrocious offensive player and has been almost unplayable on that end in the playoffs yet just received $20,000,000 a year just last offseason</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are more examples and these ones might not be perfect but you get the idea. And if you look at recentish history, there are plenty of other examples (depending on how his shot is falling Jalen McDaniels on his own team, arguably Eric Bledsoe near the end, DeAndre Jordan, Hassan Whiteside, Joakim Noah, Patrick Beverly)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s frustrating because there&rsquo;s so much Lively could learn by mimicking Gobert too, of course defensively, but also ofensively. He excels at his role as a great screener and rim runner.</p>

<p>Yesterday I had to read that Luka would be annoyed to play with Gobert. Why? It&rsquo;s not like he demands the ball in his hands or isn&rsquo;t one of the highest percentage finishers ever. Makes no sense&hellip;</p>

      <label for="llmip36" class="commentText"><p>Haaaaaaaaa BRO! Celtics didn&rsquo;t win because of a Gobert/Lively issue LOL Celtics have some of the most elite guard defenders in an age, combining speed, strength and smarts. Jrue, White, Tatum and Brown, in that order, absolutely shut down the hopes of any Kyrie penetration and Luka magic. Luka was also hurt. Give the Mavs 5 Goberts and they still don&rsquo;t stand a chance. It&rsquo;s why they got dominated even with KP injured. Completely out manned.</p>

<p>This all hurts my soul to say because I&rsquo;m a Raps fan, but can&rsquo;t for a second agree with any part of the C&rsquo;s in 6 or 7 lol they basically got SWEPT bro! Without KP! Gobert ain&rsquo;t making NO difference.</p>

      <label for="llm4rz8" class="commentText"><p>CREDIT to u/WolvesClips and u/PitlessBall on twitter for compiling many of the clips that I merged together in this video.</p>

<p>So does he get exposed by smaller players on the perimeter? You can decide for yourself. Humans naturally have confirmation bias and often generalize a few lowlights to create narratives which discounts all the other possessions. Looking at the whole sample provides a better picture. I saw people talking about it the other day and this video compiling the possessions, so I thought it would be interesting to post this. Take it whatever way you want.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<ol>
<li>IT&rsquo;S <strong>NOT</strong> A HIGHLIGHT REEL. It&rsquo;s showing all shot attempts (by perimeter players who iso-ed him) so nothing is cherry picked and it includes lowlights or times he&rsquo;s beat. You&rsquo;d see that variation for almost every defender if we showed <em>all</em> their iso D plays because no defender is perfect every play. I want to see the whole picture.</li>
<li>There were many possessions where Gobert defended a perimeter player well, which caused that player to pass out (<a href="https://x.com/WolvesClips/status/1786899355804328243" target="_blank">like here</a>), but it&rsquo;s hard to find all of those and the video would get too long. So I just included that linked clip and the rest is shot attempts compiled from u/PitlessBall. Ironically, Gobert&rsquo;s defense forced Luka to pass out a few possessions before the Luka stepback. But unfortunately no one remembers those &ldquo;nvm I actually don&rsquo;t want to iso Rudy anymore&rdquo; defensive possessions (or maybe it is too subtle for people to recognize).</li>
<li>Pnr defense (<a href="https://x.com/WolvesClips/status/1793467254774104455" target="_blank">like this on Luka</a>) also not included (may be another video). Just isolation D on perimeter players who attempted a shot.</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall my takeaway was there are certainly some possessions where Gobert gets outright beat, but most of the isolated possessions end with the offensive player taking a tough shot or a low % shot (long 2 aka the most inefficient shot in basketball) and that, more often than not, leads to a stop or miss. This could be by sticking with the player the whole way and directly forcing the tough shot himself OR indirectly forcing a low % shot by leading the player into a direction where there&rsquo;s either help D or the player has to shoot a long 2. So not an elite perimeter defender and he bites on stepbacks, but he&rsquo;s good, still creates tough shots directly or indirectly and is mobile for a center (his mobility on Murray and Kyrie was impressive).</p>

<p>Edit: I REPEAT, IT&rsquo;S <strong>NOT</strong> A HIGHLIGHT REEL. So if you&rsquo;re wondering &ldquo;why is Gobert getting beat included?&rdquo; it&rsquo;s because the video isn&rsquo;t trying to show something good or bad, just every shot attempt. If anything, the video is missing a lot of highlights - all the times his perimeter defense made a player pass out and not even attempt a shot. It&rsquo;s just a reel I thought was interesting lol, take it the way you want.</p>

      <label for="llnd3jh" class="commentText"><p>For this specific video, I just merged clips found on twitter that other people compiled (@PitlessBall and u/WolvesClips on twitter).</p>

<p>But usually I use <a href="https://thehighlow.io/" target="_blank">https://thehighlow.io/</a> - you can search any game, any player and any type of defensive or offensive play. It automatically gets you the clips. I love this site, it&rsquo;s amazing with great quality. You can also use <a href="https://bucketlist.fans/" target="_blank">https://bucketlist.fans/</a> which does a similar thing but the clips are shorter.</p>

<p>Other times, I manually record the time in the game I see interesting defensive plays while watching. Then I go to <a href="http://basketball-video.com" target="_blank">basketball-video.com</a> and snip the clip I want. More tedious of course but things like deterrence are sadly not captured in the sites above because those plays aren&rsquo;t recorded as conventional stats.</p>

<p>People were like &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why is ____ play when the opposing player just missed and he got beat was included&hellip;how is that good defense??&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m like the video isn&rsquo;t trying to show good or bad defense&hellip;it&rsquo;s just all the shot attempts by perimeter players iso-ing on Rudy. Of course a defender won&rsquo;t be great on every single play!</p>

<p>And they still don&rsquo;t get it 😂 Like y&rsquo;all there&rsquo;s no agenda, it&rsquo;s just a video you can take how you want. If anything it leaves out highlights lol</p>

Nobody wants to make their own decision, rather &ldquo;Ha, Ha, Gobert sucks, here&rsquo;s a vid of him getting toasted on defense&rdquo;. Like, dude is not perfect.</p>

<p>I thought he did pretty well defending on the perimeter but I also saw that a fake drive by a guard would get him to bite HARD and be out of position when the guard would stop and pop. But this isn&rsquo;t unique to him, nost big men suck defending on the perimeter due to their high center of gravity.</p>

<p>I think Gobert becomes unplayable due to his lack of offensive skills though.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s a good description, it seems like stepbacks and stopping and popping are the main plays when he gave too much space. Sometimes he recovers (like that time Beal had him in a circle initially lol) but other times all he can do is put up a far and late contest. Helps that he at least has a long wingspan.</p>

<p>The offense is interesting. On one hand if someone like KAT or Conley is there to feed him lobs or dunks, it&rsquo;s an efficient play that gets things going + he usually draws a foul. A KAT-Rudy lob started the Game 7 comeback and has sometimes been a Wolves go-to play when they are in a rut. He draws so many fouls it gets the team in the bonus early and that was crucial in Game 7, especially because he was making his FTs. He&rsquo;s decent at the short roll that gets corner threes open.</p>

<p>But other times the fact that he can&rsquo;t punish smalls on his own or space the floor is too detrimental. Guess it depends on the matchup.</p>

<p>Example - the <a href="https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612747&amp;Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=203076" target="_blank">2020 Lakers</a> had a better DRTG with AD off the floor</p>

<p>Another one - from <a href="https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612759&amp;Season=2015-16,2014-15,2013-14&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PlayerIds=202695" target="_blank">2014-2016</a> in the playoffs the Spurs had a better DRTG with Kawhi off the floor, that includes his DPOY year</p>

<p>There is too much randomness in terms of lineups and other factors, even with a large sample size, for a team stat like DRTG to paint a full picture of an individual player.</p>

      <label for="llmrxpb" class="commentText"><p>Like everyone is saying, just using net offense and defense, aka +- is a bad indication of how someone individually does. Using your same reference, the warriors are better offensively with Curry on the bench than with him in the game. Rotations are a complex component of basketball.</p>

<p>Rudy Gobert is by far one of the best help defenders in the nba. Wemby will take that spot soon or already has but people struggle to see how defenses have specific styles in which they are coached to play. Several times in the dallas series, minnesota let gobert stay on the switch when they obviously werent wanting to do. Luka’s game winner should have never happened because a trap should have occurred like every top 5 offensive player gets when they are one on one near the end of the game. That was poor coaching and play calling.</p>

      <label for="llmyk18" class="commentText"><p>There are just way more variables that go into a team&rsquo;s defensive rating than you&rsquo;re considering. One is that having a player like Gobert on the floor allows a coach to play great offensive players who are defensive liabilities at the same time, since he can cover up a lot of mistakes. You&rsquo;ll notice that while Minnesota&rsquo;s defense is a point better when Gobert is off the floor, the offense is almost 15(!) points worse.</p>

<p>You also have to consider that defense and offense are not independent of one another. Rudy&rsquo;s offensive limitations, especially his tendency to turn the ball over (1.6/game is a lot for a defensive-minded center who doesn&rsquo;t often handle the ball) can lead to fast break opportunities for the opponent where Rudy is behind the ball, which affects the team&rsquo;s defensive rating while he&rsquo;s on the floor but isn&rsquo;t actually caused by a lack of defensive ability. He is also among the league leaders in offensive rebounding, which is a positive offensive trait but also a trade-off for getting back on defense.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Gobert is regularly near the top of the league in stocks (steals + blocks), which can lead to fast break opportunities for his team. Additionally, his rim protection means opponents shoot more midrange and three-point shots, which can also lead to long rebounds and transition offense.</p>

<p>But even experts who know 1000x more about basketball than either you or I have difficulty quantifying defensive impact, so I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s sufficient to use something as crude as on-off team defensive rating to proclaim that someone is or isn&rsquo;t a great defender.</p>

      <label for="llmkye6" class="commentText"><p>Honestly based on the Mavs series a problem a Gobert team can face with him on vs off is that they build everything around him locking the paint. Luka toyed with him and used his lob threats to perfection. The Wolves didn’t find an adjustment and relied on him to figure it out. The moment he can’t then they’re disorganized. Its clear that he’s a positive on Defense and an all time rim protector, but he does indeed have weakneses and him or his team struggle to adjust cause he is mostly a one trick player and they fail to add layers to the defense to help him.</p>

      <label for="llnc5gm" class="commentText"><p>This. His defense has never really been the &ldquo;exposed&rdquo; part of his playoff performances. Yeah he&rsquo;s going to get cooked on switches on the perimeter at times by quicker players but A. his perimeter defense has clearly improved and B. being the rim protector and inside post deterrent that he is it&rsquo;s the team defense that needs to optimize for funneling traffic towards him in the post and keep him off the perimeter as much as possible.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s his offense that kills his teams once the opposing defense can figure out how to contain him, which in turn will negatively effect the spacing for everyone else out there.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You drastically misunderstood that series. Yes the lob threats were a real problem but gobert was doing an excellent job with them hovering in the middle to deter the floater and the lob at the same time. The biggest problem for minnesota was McDaniels being sealed by lukas off ball shoulder making it so the floater was easy for him.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re talking about a generational offensive engine wrapped up in a single player though so no one&rsquo;s ever going to properly negate him.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Goberts perimeter defense is better than people give him credit for.</p></li>

<li><p>Teams want Gobert away from the basket because it&rsquo;s much easier to score in general when he&rsquo;s away from the basket as he is an elite rim protector.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The result is he&rsquo;s an excellent defensive player but in a playoff series the team can spend all week planning on how to get him away from the basket. So when he&rsquo;s on the floor they score a bunch more around the rim then when hes off the floor.</p>

<p>This is just my theory, I don&rsquo;t have the advanced stats to back it up.</p>

      <label for="llnerm4" class="commentText"><p>This is pretty much spot on. Gobert is above-average in iso defense, but he is much, much better around the rim where he can deter, help, and command the defense. So the smart defensive play is to pull him away from the rim, which is why teams scheme to do that.</p>

<p>There’s a much larger sample of opponents scoring significantly less than their average when he is on the court, which is why he has 3 DPOYs.</p>

<p>but if he does get &ldquo;played off the floor,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s because of his offense. idk how people don&rsquo;t see this. &ldquo;gangly giraffe&rdquo; is the perfect comp. he&rsquo;s just so easily the worst starting center on offense in the league, and worse than so many backups. i know people are going to throw his high FG% at me but idk what you want me to say. the guy can&rsquo;t catch or grab the damn ball (for his size he&rsquo;s such a frustrating rebounder&hellip; he just has weak hands). his &ldquo;bad pass&rdquo; turnovers are some of the most embarrassing in the league. worse, he&rsquo;s the kinda guy who&rsquo;s so bad in such a specific way on offense, that so much offense ends up necessarily being funneled through him because the defense forces it to be. i think on a team like minnesota, where the offense is already a little shaky, guys just kinda end up hating their time on the floor with him because how much it mucks things up.</p>

<p>Was there also plays where he gets beat 1v1 which leads to defense helping and then an open 3 ? From these clips it seems like the other 4 were staying on their guys so I&rsquo;m guessing not a lot, but I&rsquo;m curious if teams tried this approach.</p>

      <label for="llo0l7b" class="commentText"><p>Ooh that&rsquo;s a great question. To clarify, you&rsquo;re asking if the original player iso-ing Rudy beat him, were there times when the Wolves overhelped so a different player got an open 3?</p>

<p>I remember this happening often in Rudy&rsquo;s first year, the other defenders would keep overhelping. But last year, the Wolves normally stayed home in general and let Rudy take on the iso, even if it&rsquo;s a clutch possession. They seem to really trust him. He was on the perimeter a loot in the Suns series. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s gotta be a few times that happened though&hellip;and if so, it wouldn&rsquo;t be included in this video. This is exclusively plays when a player iso-ing Rudy went through with attempting a shot.</p>

<p>What is interesting is perimeter players iso-ing Rudy and sticking with the iso happened only 24 times through 3 series. So maybe he&rsquo;s not as hunted by guards as people think? But I don&rsquo;t know the number if we wanted to include the &ldquo;jk I don&rsquo;t want to iso Rudy anymore&rdquo; plays or the plays you mentioned.</p>

Obviously he gets beat once in a while like anyone else but just crunching these numbers he gave up 0.6 PPP in isolation, often times on elite or very good players. The average PPP in isolate is closer to 0.8 - 1.0 for stars, so this is just INSANE defense. He is making KD look human and guys like MPJ into scrubs. Seriously - if any player averaged 0.6 in isolation, they would be benched immediately&hellip;</p>

<p>I feel like he&rsquo;s improved in some respects (his hands used to be absolute stones) but I feel like initial impressions are so important in the NBA. A dude who was a phenom from day one will always get more respect than a guy who steadily improved and might even end up better than the first guy. There are <em>still</em> people that swear up and down that Kyrie is better than Steph because Kyrie was nice from day one and Steph just &ldquo;happened to get a good team around him&rdquo;</p>

But he’s 5th in box outs, 4th in contested shots, 2nd in screen assists, he has led the league 3x in true shooting and FG% while scoring 14+ ppg. He is excellent at defense, positioning, dirty work, creates constant rim gravity that opens the rest of the floor for teammates, and plays a clear offensive role extremely efficiently.</p>

<p>Ball handling and perimeter shooting aren’t the only skills in the NBA. There’s a reason Rudy makes max money and other “low skill” bigs are on minimum contracts.</p>

<p>Also, people have weird expectations for perimeter defense, where if it doesn&rsquo;t look like rim protection, it&rsquo;s not defense.  Blocks are pretty rare close to the three point line, it&rsquo;s mostly about not getting crossed, closing passing lanes, and lowering the chance of an easy shot.  To some, that&rsquo;s not &ldquo;defense&rdquo;.</p>

      <label for="lln2tgm" class="commentText"><p>I feel like so much of the hate Gobert gets about being overrated traces back to the days in Utah when teams like near-prime warriors (edit: apparently not warriors, but other teams in the west) would come in and shit on them. Ignoring, of course, that Gobert’s guards in Utah were barely distinguishable from turnstiles on defense, and he was put into positions even peak KG or Hakeem couldn’t have a hope.</p>

<p>He does leave some people more open than ideal on three pointers (welcome to being a big in drop defense), but if you actually watch that video, most of the shots that get made are well contested, and like half of them are Kevin Durant, who is universally acclaimed to be one of the greatest pure scorers in history. And also isn’t actually a smaller player.</p>

I think all but 1 of the times Rudy/Utah lost in the playoffs, the opponent was top 5 in regular season offense</p>

      <label for="llmyfta" class="commentText"><p>No, the problem was Minny&rsquo;s guards could not stay in front of Luka and Kyrie at all, so they look practically unguardable. That&rsquo;s why Lively and Gafford was able to get so many lobs, because the Mavs would blow by their guards, then their big would have to chose between contesting the guards finishing at the rim or protect the lob and they couldn&rsquo;t do any of those things consistently.</p>

<p>People do underrate how much of a burden Gobert is offensively. You can reliably pass to him on offensive, so it puts the burden on the 4 other plays to perform and do something. It&rsquo;s not only his fault, but since he&rsquo;s a non-factor on offense you can provide a lot more help defense compared to other bigs.</p>

      <label for="llnbqsl" class="commentText"><p>I, as a highly biased Wolves fan, contend that the screens by Lively and Gafford were crazy illegal (almost every screen is in an NBA game, but theirs were extra bad) but the NBA’s desire for fewer foul calls/increased physicality allowed them to get away with it. That meant the Wolves’ perimeter players were constantly playing from behind the play, which is where Luka is absolutely unstoppable (because he’s so big and so good at engaging the big and throwing the lob over the top).</p>

<p>The best way to counter it is either to switch (what OKC and Boston did), but you need size across the board so someone like Conley isn’t getting pulled into the play, or to have your help pinch in from the corners really aggressively (Minnesota did this a bit but didn’t execute very well, they also seemed nervous to give up the corners since Dallas killed OKC with corner 3s).</p>

When he had it going it really opened up a lot of Ants game, you’d usually see a burst in Ants offensive game right after a decent quarter from KAT. Unfortunately the wolves had little consistent offensive weapons , and KAT does himself no favors once he realizes he’s on a cold streak there’s usually an uptick of boneheaded plays.</p>

<p>If I really wanted to make a response, I&rsquo;d make a playoff highlight reel. (Which I may do at some point too lol).</p>

<p>No, he doesn&rsquo;t get exposed in the playoffs.</p>

<p>And no, he isn&rsquo;t a offensive liability, he is super efficient screen setter, rim runner, lob target and glass cleaner, it&rsquo;s the paradise for anyone who like to play pick and roll.</p>

<p>People talk about Rudy adding a post game but I think what would elevate his game is a short roll pass, if he could just receive the ball around the free throw line and pass to an open cutter (that Minnesota does not lack, the have size and athleticism at the wings), it would make things so much better.</p>

<p>Draymond is a great offensive piece in the Warriors system, Rudy could fill a similar role if he had a better court vision.</p>

<p>People act like he needs a deep post bag, but that&rsquo;s just so against his style, of course a reliable hook would do wonders, but the short roll game fits his and Minnesota&rsquo;s style so much better.</p>

<p>Yeah I&rsquo;m showing all shot attempts so some of them will be shots that the offensive player just misses (which is the case for any defender if you show all of the plays, and not just the highlights).</p>

<p>He gets beat sometimes, he can backtrack other times and he can also hold his own. Mostly I&rsquo;m seeing tough shots or rushed shots though, whether that be because he was able to stick with the guard the whole way through or he forced them into a direction where there was help defense.</p>

      <label for="lln0x1n" class="commentText"><p>Look as a recovering Jazz fan I hate Gobert as the next person, but the conversation around him is completely wrong. The issue has never been his defense. I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s worth 4 DPOYs but he deserved at least some of those. No he isn&rsquo;t the best 1-on-1 defender in the league, but he&rsquo;s the best rim protector and the best team defense anchor in the league.</p>

<p>The real issue is his offense which allows opponents to use different lineups that then create issues on defense. Team will play 5 out which generally means smaller. Against most big men that would give the big an advantage on offense. But because Gobert has no offense outside of screening (which he&rsquo;s superb at), it actually creates a disadvantage because now the other team just switches everything and outside of defending against lobs can largely play 5 on 4.</p>

<p>So because Gobert can&rsquo;t punish the defense when they go small, they now have a smaller, faster team on the other end of the floor. They will be able to penetrate into the lane somewhere, draw in Gobert, and then kick it to someone open. Gobert was a bit unlucky during the Jazz years that the perimeter defense, particularly from guards, was abysmal. Conley was hurt, or Mitchell was hurt or disinterested, or the other guards were just bad. Defense collapsed easily, Gobert had to abandon a shooter, easy buckets. Gobert gets the blame because he&rsquo;s the one who rotates over, and the Jazz were horrific at defensive rotations, or were coached to stay home.</p>

<p>The Terance Mann game for example, Gobert was on him intentionally since the Jazz wanted to make him be the one to beat them. Gobert would help off him and nobody would rotate, and he has a buffet of open looks. Is that Gobert&rsquo;s fault? I&rsquo;d argue it was a mix of coaching and him being the one that rotates. If he just stayed on Mann he would&rsquo;ve had a quiet night but the Jazz would&rsquo;ve been giving up layups left and right. The blueprint for this had actually been created years earlier by Houston. Harden would get past Rubio or whoever easily, Gobert would help, Capela would get an easy lob. Teams saw that and said &ldquo;let&rsquo;s just put a shooter in the corner instead of a big in the dunker spot&rdquo; and it worked because Gobert can&rsquo;t back down someone six inches shorter than him in the paint on the other end of the floor.</p>

      <label for="llngv22" class="commentText"><p>This video isn&rsquo;t cherry picking or selling an agenda. It just compiles all the shot attempts a perimeter player took while iso-ing on Gobert. If anything, highlights are left out since the plays Gobert defended a guy so well that the guy passed out and didn&rsquo;t even attempt the shot aren&rsquo;t in the video. It&rsquo;s just the shot attempts.</p>

<p>People can take it how they want. I just thought it was interesting to post all those possessions since people have been talking about Gobert in the playoffs lately. More useful to see a larger sample than generalizing from 1-2 lowlights or highlights.</p>

<p>However, I do think he is definitely overrated and overhated. What he does is really amazing but my problem with him is how useless he seems on offense. I believe it eats into his usefulness as a whole.</p>

<p>There is also something to be said about how he is consistently on teams that underperform or have these meltdowns in the playoffs. It could be partly to do with his game or it could not I don’t know yet.</p>

      <label for="llmlyut" class="commentText"><p>Rudy is a court shifting defender. Like you said, you would notice nightly guys give up looks within 5 ft of the hoop because he is simply in the area. Offensively he is incredibly limited, but if teammates can feed him a couple times early for dunks he maintains an intensity offensively that builds momentum for the entire team. I think he is a much better passer than people give him credit for. He sets incredible screens. Our guys simply choose to rarely utilize them. Unfortunately a lot of what Go get offers is dependent on team buy in on both ends. If you have a mature responsible team with Gobert, it&rsquo;s a real problem for the league. If you leave him know an island he will get picked apart on both ends.</p>

      <label for="llnp404" class="commentText"><p>Do his teams really underperform in the playoffs?</p>

<p>With Utah he made the playoffs 6 times. Five of the six they were the 5 seed or worse (aka expected to lose in the 1st round). They went 2-3 in the first rounds those seasons, and 0-2 in the 2nd round. Four of the five losses were to either the peak Warriors or the Harden rockets, the other loss was the crazy bubble series with the Nuggets.</p>

<p>The only season they underperformed in the playoffs was 20-21 when they finished top of the league and lost in the 2nd round. Worth mentioning that both Conley and Mitchell were injured in that series against the Clippers (as was Kawhi), would have liked to see how it played out with both teams fully healthy.</p>

<p>His first season in Minnesota they struggled to gel a bit and ended up as the 8th seed, losing in the first round. Then last year they made the confeence finals as the 3 seed. Ya, maybe they were favored against the Mavs, but they also upset the 1 seed defending champs along the way.</p>

      <label for="llo0bvh" class="commentText"><p>One thing this video highlights quite well is that he will bite on literally anything. Hes like a cat chasing a laser. He gives up so much good positioning where other bigs would dare you to take a shot, rudy lets you get whatever you want and if you can get past his hand its yours. Hes so obviously not a fan of contact.</p>

      <label for="llqlyou" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s a 7&rsquo;2&rdquo; center in his 30s whose primary responsibility is to be a rim protector. The fact that he can guard the perimeter <em>at all</em> is actually fairly remarkable.</p>

<p>I can think of a whole lot of all-time great centers who would have been in a world of trouble defensively if they&rsquo;d have had to guard the paint AND the perimeter like Rudy has to in today&rsquo;s game.</p>

<p>The game is different now than it was before.  3-5 players on the floor at any given time can reliably shoot 3&rsquo;s now.  It wasn&rsquo;t very long ago where you only had to worry about 1-2 of the 5 guys on the floor being able to reliably hit a shot from beyond the arc.</p>

<p>But by certain players.</p>

<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t rate the perimeter defense by the shots made out of missed, but instead the comfort level of said perimeter players and the quality of shots they can create.</p>

<p>Against Beal, Porter and Murray Gobert guarded them nicely.</p>

<p>Against Durant Booker and Luka they were well within their comfort zone and got almost anything they wanted or had open shots the vast majority of the time.</p>

A lot of the narrative is made up because he’s one of the more hated players in the league. That and some of those terrible Utah defenses really hung him out to dry a lot of times.</p>

      <label for="llo00co" class="commentText"><p>Rudy hate is laughable to say the least. Teams have better defensive ratings when he’s out there. Period. He’s 7+ feet tall, so yes, PROFESSIONAL top tier talent will get by him. But he cleans up a lot of guards and forwards getting blown by also. People like Shaq saying he’s the worst NBA player ever is trash. Shaq could never defend on the perimeter and if they didn’t let him elbow you in the face with his turnaround… not sure he would be celebrated as much. Rudy is a good player and a great defender. I thought the reporters picked these awards. Surprised these same reporters don’t step up to defend their position…</p>
