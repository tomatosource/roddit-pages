But sit your ass down little bro lol. Gobert with no bag still averages a double double with consistently good defense. Makes me wanna go to a game this season with some Gobert merch and a sign. And I live in ATL lol.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s frustrating because there&rsquo;s so much Lively could learn by mimicking Gobert too, of course defensively, but also ofensively. He excels at his role as a great screener and rim runner.</p>

<p>Yesterday I had to read that Luka would be annoyed to play with Gobert. Why? It&rsquo;s not like he demands the ball in his hands or isn&rsquo;t one of the highest percentage finishers ever. Makes no sense&hellip;</p>

      <label for="llmghri" class="commentText"><p>No it isn’t. Contrary to popular belief it’s the Mavs offense that completely fell apart, the Celtics clamped them completely.</p>

<p>Mavs actually held Boston to their lowest ORTG of any playoff round I believe</p>

<p>Rudy is still getting cooked by Boston regardless lol, they have 5 out spacing with 4 players who can put the ball on the floor and attack. And he’s a worse roller than lively at this point due to his age and he also has no post game just like lively</p>

When that turned out to be false you go to talk about specific times of the game like that helps your argument. Newsflash it doesn’t.</p>

<p>Sometimes people get the best of you. And you need to sit. It’s happened to every person that’s ever played the game. And every single DPOY winner. People go on stretches, sometimes nobody can stop someone for a little stretch. And acting like when Luka and Kyrie 2 of the best offensive players in the whole world are cooking that’s a terrible thing… News flash. Luka is gonna score 30 no matter who he is playing or who is guarding him.</p>

      <label for="llmip36" class="commentText"><p>Haaaaaaaaa BRO! Celtics didn&rsquo;t win because of a Gobert/Lively issue LOL Celtics have some of the most elite guard defenders in an age, combining speed, strength and smarts. Jrue, White, Tatum and Brown, in that order, absolutely shut down the hopes of any Kyrie penetration and Luka magic. Luka was also hurt. Give the Mavs 5 Goberts and they still don&rsquo;t stand a chance. It&rsquo;s why they got dominated even with KP injured. Completely out manned.</p>

<p>This all hurts my soul to say because I&rsquo;m a Raps fan, but can&rsquo;t for a second agree with any part of the C&rsquo;s in 6 or 7 lol they basically got SWEPT bro! Without KP! Gobert ain&rsquo;t making NO difference.</p>

<p>Also, people have weird expectations for perimeter defense, where if it doesn&rsquo;t look like rim protection, it&rsquo;s not defense.  Blocks are pretty rare close to the three point line, it&rsquo;s mostly about not getting crossed, closing passing lanes, and lowering the chance of an easy shot.  To some, that&rsquo;s not &ldquo;defense&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The criticism on Gobert is completely validated.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>For his contract, he should be adding offensive moves to his game every offseason but he never does. He hasn’t improved at all in 4-5 years in any facet of the game. His below average finish at the rim costs them games (even in the Olympics).</p>

<p>This isn’t hate. This is a constructive criticism.</p>

<p>Defensively, Gobert is quite slow (which is more apparent when he&rsquo;s on the perimeter). The video shared shows exactly this, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising because he&rsquo;s a lumbering 7-footer. He&rsquo;s long, so he can recover well and he is smart so he doesn&rsquo;t commit too many bad fouls in tougher situations, but he&rsquo;s a mismatch on the perimeter against a crafty guard. He&rsquo;s an excellent off ball and post defender. But he&rsquo;s not a lockdown perimeter defender on the other team&rsquo;s best players. So he&rsquo;s a max contract player that can&rsquo;t make an open layup (it&rsquo;s dunk or nothing) and he&rsquo;s a liability when pulled out of the paint against a crafty scoring guard. Again, low hanging fruit for critics.</p>

      <label for="llm4rz8" class="commentText"><p>CREDIT to u/WolvesClips and u/PitlessBall on twitter for compiling many of the clips that I merged together in this video.</p>

<p>So does he get &ldquo;exposed&rdquo; by smaller players on the perimeter? You can decide for yourself. Humans naturally have confirmation bias and often generalize a few lowlights to create narratives which discounts all the other possessions. Looking at the whole sample provides a better picture.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<ol>
<li>IT&rsquo;S <strong>NOT</strong> A HIGHLIGHT REEL. It&rsquo;s showing all shot attempts (by perimeter players who iso-ed him) which includes lowlights and sometimes Gobert getting beat &amp; the opponent missing. You&rsquo;d see that variation for almost every defender if we showed <em>all</em> their iso D plays because no defender is perfect every play. I want to see the whole picture.</li>
<li>There were many possessions where Gobert defended a perimeter player well, which caused that player to pass out (<a href="https://x.com/WolvesClips/status/1786899355804328243" target="_blank">like here</a>), but it&rsquo;s hard to find all of those and the video would get too long (contrary to popular belief). So I just included that clip and the rest is shot attempts. Ironically, Gobert did this to Luka just a few possessions before the Luka stepback but unfortunately no one remembers those good defensive possessions or it is too subtle for people to recognize.</li>
<li>Pnr defense (<a href="https://x.com/WolvesClips/status/1793467254774104455" target="_blank">like this on Luka</a>) also not included (may be another video). Just isolation D on perimeter players who attempted a shot. If there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s not isolation D, let me know.</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall my takeaway was there are certainly some possessions where Gobert gets outright beat, but most of the isolated possessions end with forcing the offensive player into a tough, low % shot and that, more often than not, leads to a stop. This could be by sticking with the player the whole way and forcing the tough shot himself or leading the player into a direction where there&rsquo;s help D, so it becomes a tough shot.</p>

<p>I REPEAT, IT&rsquo;S <strong>NOT</strong> A HIGHLIGHT REEL. So if you&rsquo;re wondering &ldquo;why is Gobert getting beat included?&rdquo; it&rsquo;s because the video isn&rsquo;t trying to show something good or bad, just every attempt. This video is actually missing a lot of highlights - all the times his perimeter defense made a player frantically pass out and not even attempt a shot.</p>

<p>This was on Utah too, where apparently all his teammates were “traffic cones” so how could they possibly get better defensively without him in such a large sample size?</p>

<p>Example - the <a href="https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612747&amp;Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=203076" target="_blank">2020 Lakers</a> had a better DRTG with AD off the floor</p>

<p>Another one - from <a href="https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612759&amp;Season=2015-16,2014-15,2013-14&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PlayerIds=202695" target="_blank">2014-2016</a> in the playoffs the Spurs had a better DRTG with Kawhi off the floor, that includes his DPOY year</p>

<p>There is too much randomness in terms of lineups and other factors, even with a large sample size, for a team stat like DRTG to paint a full picture of an individual player.</p>

<p>in the playoffs, it&rsquo;s magnified more because a lot of starters play around 40 minutes per game, so one 12-2 run while you&rsquo;re sitting can completely alter an individual&rsquo;s +/-</p>

      <label for="llmrxpb" class="commentText"><p>Like everyone is saying, just using net offense and defense, aka +- is a bad indication of how someone individually does. Using your same reference, the warriors are better offensively with Curry on the bench than with him in the game. Rotations are a complex component of basketball.</p>

<p>Rudy Gobert is by far one of the best help defenders in the nba. Wemby will take that spot soon or already has but people struggle to see how defenses have specific styles in which they are coached to play. Several times in the dallas series, minnesota let gobert stay on the switch when they obviously werent wanting to do. Luka’s game winner should have never happened because a trap should have occurred like every top 5 offensive player gets when they are one on one near the end of the game. That was poor coaching and play calling.</p>

      <label for="llmkye6" class="commentText"><p>Honestly based on the Mavs series a problem a Gobert team can face with him on vs off is that they build everything around him locking the paint. Luka toyed with him and used his lob threats to perfection. The Wolves didn’t find an adjustment and relied on him to figure it out. The moment he can’t then they’re disorganized. Its clear that he’s a positive on Defense and an all time rim protector, but he does indeed have weakneses and him or his team struggle to adjust cause he is mostly a one trick player and they fail to add layers to the defense to help him.</p>

<p>If I had to guess why Gobert’s teams are bad in the playoffs, weaknesses get amplified and coach’s try to adjust from another team’s strengths. Even this video is pretty stupid, ‘Gobert is shutting down perimeter players, lol Dereck Lively.’ The playoffs are not a 1 on 1 drill at the top of the key, a coach would try to get away from that being the emphasis of attack. What happens on the rest of the floor when Gobert is on the perimeter? Is Conley stuck on bigs? Is Edwards? Can I take advantage of that? Can I get KAT in some bad matchups on the perimeter because Gobert needs to help in the paint? If I get Gobert switched onto Kyrie on the perimeter, can Luka have free lanes to the basket on his side of the floor? If Gobert won’t switch onto Kyrie, is Kyrie getting loose for middies and 3’s? If Gobert is switching onto Jamal Murray, does Jokic get Conley defending him for an entire series? If Gobert keeps getting switched through screens and stuck in the corner defending a shooter he can’t leave, am I better off with a more versatile player who can chip in on offense? Is a defender who’s being put into positions where he can’t use his defense, and whose man on defense is being used to help elsewhere on the floor because his offense is limited, worth it if Naz Reid can at least make them pay on offense to stretch the defense?</p>

A few years back when the Clippers exposed Rudy, the strategy was to isolate him up top, take him off the dribble and force help, then swing to the open man.</p>

<p>I’m sure you could find the same data showing that he didn’t give up a high FG%. For example, as a Pacers fan, I know that Benedict Mathurin was a bit of a liability on the perimeter because he is WAAAAAYYYYY too aggressive going for steals. When he’s locked on, he’s amazing, but he gives up position constantly trying to get a steal.</p>

<p>Kat - 23%</p>

<p>Naz - 14.5%</p>

<p>Kat never even had a playoff series ever scoring more than 21.2 ppg. That was his only series above 20 ppg btw</p>

      <label for="llmtxr0" class="commentText"><p>It’s not only this but the fact that he is being paid a max because he provides the best rim protection in the league. However, plays like this show how easy it is to scheme up ways to pull him away from the rim. Even if he is surviving as a perimeter defender individually, on any play where he is drawn out and the action is away from his man, the team is not getting the max value of his contract because he’s no longer protecting the rim. It would be interesting to see a compilation of how easily teams score when Gobert is pulled out to the arc and the action is away from his matchup. While rim protection is a very important part of the defense, championship teams cannot afford to allocate a max deal to someone who offers little else in the other areas of the game</p>

<p>The fact he’s virtually inept on offence means he needs to be perfect defensively, and despite his strengths defending the rim, his struggles on the perimeter are too much of a hole for him to be making anywhere remotely close to his current salary.</p>

<p>If he was making 20-30 mil it would be alright, being on a max is inexcusable.</p>

      <label for="llmddwx" class="commentText"><p>From what I see among all the shot attempts, for most possessions he&rsquo;s still forcing tough shots or low % shots so &ldquo;struggles on the perimeter are too much of a hole&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t feel accurate. Like he literally took on Kyrie and did a good job forcing tough shots in clutch lol.</p>

<p>There are also possessions like <a href="https://x.com/WolvesClips/status/1786899355804328243" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="https://x.com/WolvesClips/status/1793467254774104455" target="_blank">this</a> not shown where he plays great defense that forces players to pass out. But it&rsquo;s too long to add all those and this was not meant to be a highlight reel. He moves pretty quick for a center and if he gets beat, often he&rsquo;s able to backtrack and recover.</p>

<p>To me he looks like a decent perimeter defender and like all defenders, will get beat sometimes and won&rsquo;t be perfect every play. Since it&rsquo;s all plays, you&rsquo;ll see the full spectrum as it&rsquo;s not a highlight reel.</p>

<p>Kat and Rudy also clock up the paint a lot. They Limit Ants greatest strengths.</p>

Don’t get why everyone feels the need to defend him constantly lmao it’s not like yelling “I don’t know why players don’t like him” is going to change things</p>

<p>Yeah I&rsquo;m showing all shot attempts so some of them will be shots that the offensive player just misses (which is the case for any defender if you show all of the plays, and not just the highlights).</p>

<p>He gets beat sometimes, he can backtrack other times and he can also hold his own. Mostly I&rsquo;m seeing tough shots or rushed shots though, whether that be because he was able to stick with the guard the whole way through or he forced them into a direction where there was help defense.</p>

<p>This clip has players like Luka, Kyrie, and KD.</p>

<p>What makes it even funnier is you can see all the extra shading from the Wolves as soon as Rudy gets iso’d</p>

<p>But of course, The video doesn’t include any FGA from passes or drop offs so it’ll remain a mystery what happens when he actually got beat and that help slid over.</p>

      <label for="llmgxtc" class="commentText"><p>Gobert is the most unfairly hated player in the league, it makes no sense everyone act like he isn&rsquo;t the all time great defender that he is.</p>

<p>No, he doesn&rsquo;t get exposed in the playoffs.</p>

<p>And no, he isn&rsquo;t a offensive liability, he is super efficient screen setter, rim runner, lob target and glass cleaner, it&rsquo;s the paradise for anyone who like to play pick and roll.</p>

<p>People talk about Rudy adding a post game but I think what would elevate his game is a short roll pass, if he could just receive the ball around the free throw line and pass to an open cutter (that Minnesota does not lack, the have size and athleticism at the wings), it would make things so much better.</p>

<p>Draymond is a great offensive piece in the Warriors system, Rudy could fill a similar role if he had a better court vision.</p>

      <label for="llmeywp" class="commentText"><p>Rudy Gobert is a fantastic rim protector, Possibly one of if not the greatest ever, hes so good that players dont even try layups as often as they otherwise would.</p>

<p>However, I do think he is definitely overrated and overhated. What he does is really amazing but my problem with him is how useless he seems on offense. I believe it eats into his usefulness as a whole.</p>

<p>There is also something to be said about how he is consistently on teams that underperform or have these meltdowns in the playoffs. It could be partly to do with his game or it could not I don’t know yet.</p>

      <label for="llmlyut" class="commentText"><p>Rudy is a court shifting defender. Like you said, you would notice nightly guys give up looks within 5 ft of the hoop because he is simply in the area. Offensively he is incredibly limited, but if teammates can feed him a couple times early for dunks he maintains an intensity offensively that builds momentum for the entire team. I think he is a much better passer than people give him credit for. He sets incredible screens. Our guys simply choose to rarely utilize them. Unfortunately a lot of what Go get offers is dependent on team buy in on both ends. If you have a mature responsible team with Gobert, it&rsquo;s a real problem for the league. If you leave him know an island he will get picked apart on both ends.</p>

      <label for="llmjuzk" class="commentText"><p>Rudy hate is 100% deserved. He’s a dirty player with no offensive skills who’s been rewarded like the greatest defensive player ever, and that doesn’t pass the eye test. Not to mention his bullshit during Covid-19. It’s clear his peers dislike and don’t respect him. The wild stuff I see is people sitting on the couch being like “uhh, how can legends and players who beat him not see how great he is?” If the centers playing against him and the historical best centers in history say he’s trash, maybe that’s more valuable than nebulous advanced stats that say he’s totally worth one of the biggest contracts in history. </p>

Is it because they can&rsquo;t do anything else they go for a midrange block layup block so they force into 3s but they still shoots 3 below constantly below average like give LeBron Rudy and a 3 point catch and shoot player he wins I think Rudy plays so good on defensive they think he is doing nothing because he makes it looks so easy</p>

<p>Also, it&rsquo;s not meant to be a highlight reel. I&rsquo;m just showing everything so we see the whole picture, so that includes lowlights. He didn&rsquo;t get played off the court either, he was literally on the court for big moments and clutch time in every series lol.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This video isn&rsquo;t saying all the plays or late contests are good defense. <strong>It&rsquo;s not a highlight reel</strong>, it&rsquo;s <em>alll</em> the shot attempts taken on him in iso by perimeter players. So there are late contests, there are lowlights, there are highlights, it&rsquo;s just showing everything.</p>

<p>If you show everything for any defender, you&rsquo;d also see late contests and times they got beat. But for the most part, he did pretty well for a center. He even forced Kyrie into tough shots (last 20 seconds of this video) which is really impressive for a 7 footer.</p>

<p>Maybe I should have just done a highlight reel because people aren&rsquo;t getting that I&rsquo;m showing everything lol. It doesn&rsquo;t even include the clips he made players pass out.</p>
