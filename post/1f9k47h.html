<p>It&rsquo;s frustrating because there&rsquo;s so much Lively could learn by mimicking Gobert too, of course defensively, but also ofensively. He excels at his role as a great screener and rim runner.</p>

<p>Yesterday I had to read that Luka would be annoyed to play with Gobert. Why? It&rsquo;s not like he demands the ball in his hands or isn&rsquo;t one of the highest percentage finishers ever. Makes no sense&hellip;</p>

<p>Mavs actually held Boston to their lowest ORTG of any playoff round I believe</p>

<p>Rudy is still getting cooked by Boston regardless lol, they have 5 out spacing with 4 players who can put the ball on the floor and attack. And he’s a worse roller than lively at this point due to his age and he also has no post game just like lively</p>

<p>Yeah because Brown picked up Luka on the perimeter and Tatum played the 5 against Lively.</p>

<p>That neutralised the Dallas PnR, which had been a big part of their success.</p>

<p>Tatum would have struggled more against Gobert than he did against Lively. He&rsquo;s bigger, stronger, can score double the points while also being more efficient.</p>

      <label for="lln4wc9" class="commentText"><p>True but that&rsquo;s going under the assumption thatbhe would guard Gobert.   Against Minnesota they ain&rsquo;t switching as much as they did against Dallas.  You have to switch against Dallas because Luke eat standard drop coverage for breakfast.   Minny doesn&rsquo;t.  Tatum likely guards McDaniels.  The big threat would&rsquo;ve been Kat at the 4 and he&rsquo;s so inconsistent they wouldn&rsquo;t even had cared.  They probably would put Jrue on Kat and psyche him out into taking bad jumpers.  Plus against Minny they could get away with more double big lineups.</p>

Celtics didn&rsquo;t win because of a Gobert/Lively issue LOL Celtics have some of the most elite guard defenders in an age, combining speed, strength and smarts.

Give the Mavs 5 Goberts and they still don&rsquo;t stand a chance. It&rsquo;s why they got dominated even with KP injured. Completely out manned.</p>

<p>This all hurts my soul to say because I&rsquo;m a Raps fan, but can&rsquo;t for a second agree with any part of the C&rsquo;s in 6 or 7 lol they basically got SWEPT bro! Without KP! Gobert ain&rsquo;t making NO difference.</p>

      <label for="llmwi21" class="commentText"><p>xD You think a team that struggled offensively in the finals would be a even better team if you give them a player with stone hands and minimum offensive ability? A reminder that the Cs won without Porzingis playing 90% of the minutes and when he did play he was completely unguardable. That series was further apart than people realize, it took an injury and the Celtics two Star players playing like ass compared to their usual level and despite that they still won the series in 5 games.</p>

      <label for="llm4rz8" class="commentText"><p>CREDIT to u/WolvesClips and u/PitlessBall on twitter for compiling many of the clips that I merged together in this video.</p>

<p>So does he get &ldquo;exposed&rdquo; by smaller players on the perimeter? You can decide for yourself. Humans naturally have confirmation bias and often generalize a few lowlights to create narratives which discounts all the other possessions. Looking at the whole sample provides a better picture.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<ol>
<li>IT&rsquo;S <strong>NOT</strong> A HIGHLIGHT REEL. It&rsquo;s showing all shot attempts (by perimeter players who iso-ed him) which includes lowlights and sometimes Gobert getting beat &amp; the opponent missing. You&rsquo;d see that variation for almost every defender if we showed <em>all</em> their iso D plays because no defender is perfect every play. I want to see the whole picture.</li>
<li>There were many possessions where Gobert defended a perimeter player well, which caused that player to pass out (<a href="https://x.com/WolvesClips/status/1786899355804328243" target="_blank">like here</a>), but it&rsquo;s hard to find all of those and the video would get too long (contrary to popular belief). So I just included that clip and the rest is shot attempts. Ironically, Gobert did this to Luka just a few possessions before the Luka stepback but unfortunately no one remembers those good defensive possessions or it is too subtle for people to recognize.</li>
<li>Pnr defense (<a href="https://x.com/WolvesClips/status/1793467254774104455" target="_blank">like this on Luka</a>) also not included (may be another video). Just isolation D on perimeter players who attempted a shot. If there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s not isolation D, let me know.</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall my takeaway was there are certainly some possessions where Gobert gets outright beat, but most of the isolated possessions end with forcing the offensive player into a tough, low % shot and that, more often than not, leads to a stop. This could be by sticking with the player the whole way and forcing the tough shot himself or leading the player into a direction where there&rsquo;s help D, so it becomes a tough shot.</p>

<p>I REPEAT, IT&rsquo;S <strong>NOT</strong> A HIGHLIGHT REEL. So if you&rsquo;re wondering &ldquo;why is Gobert getting beat included?&rdquo; it&rsquo;s because the video isn&rsquo;t trying to show something good or bad, just every attempt. This video is actually missing a lot of highlights - all the times his perimeter defense made a player frantically pass out and not even attempt a shot.</p>

<p>Example - the <a href="https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612747&amp;Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=203076" target="_blank">2020 Lakers</a> had a better DRTG with AD off the floor</p>

<p>Another one - from <a href="https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612759&amp;Season=2015-16,2014-15,2013-14&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PlayerIds=202695" target="_blank">2014-2016</a> in the playoffs the Spurs had a better DRTG with Kawhi off the floor, that includes his DPOY year</p>

<p>There is too much randomness in terms of lineups and other factors, even with a large sample size, for a team stat like DRTG to paint a full picture of an individual player.</p>

Using your same reference, the warriors are better offensively with Curry on the bench than with him in the game. Rotations are a complex component of basketball.</p>

<p>Rudy Gobert is by far one of the best help defenders in the nba. Wemby will take that spot soon or already has but people struggle to see how defenses have specific styles in which they are coached to play. Several times in the dallas series, minnesota let gobert stay on the switch when they obviously werent wanting to do. Luka’s game winner should have never happened because a trap should have occurred like every top 5 offensive player gets when they are one on one near the end of the game. That was poor coaching and play calling.</p>

      <label for="llmyk18" class="commentText"><p>There are just way more variables that go into a team&rsquo;s defensive rating than you&rsquo;re considering. One is that having a player like Gobert on the floor allows a coach to play great offensive players who are defensive liabilities at the same time, since he can cover up a lot of mistakes. You&rsquo;ll notice that while Minnesota&rsquo;s defense is a point better when Gobert is off the floor, the offense is almost 15(!) points worse.</p>

<p>You also have to consider that defense and offense are not independent of one another. Rudy&rsquo;s offensive limitations, especially his tendency to turn the ball over (1.6/game is a lot for a defensive-minded center who doesn&rsquo;t often handle the ball) can lead to fast break opportunities for the opponent where Rudy is behind the ball, which affects the team&rsquo;s defensive rating while he&rsquo;s on the floor but isn&rsquo;t actually caused by a lack of defensive ability. He is also among the league leaders in offensive rebounding, which is a positive offensive trait but also a trade-off for getting back on defense.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Gobert is regularly near the top of the league in stocks (steals + blocks), which can lead to fast break opportunities for his team. Additionally, his rim protection means opponents shoot more midrange and three-point shots, which can also lead to long rebounds and transition offense.</p>

<p>But even experts who know 1000x more about basketball than either you or I have difficulty quantifying defensive impact, so I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s sufficient to use something as crude as on-off team defensive rating to proclaim that someone is or isn&rsquo;t a great defender.</p>

      <label for="llmkye6" class="commentText"><p>Honestly based on the Mavs series a problem a Gobert team can face with him on vs off is that they build everything around him locking the paint. Luka toyed with him and used his lob threats to perfection. The Wolves didn’t find an adjustment and relied on him to figure it out. The moment he can’t then they’re disorganized. Its clear that he’s a positive on Defense and an all time rim protector, but he does indeed have weakneses and him or his team struggle to adjust cause he is mostly a one trick player and they fail to add layers to the defense to help him.</p>

<p>There’s a much larger sample of opponents scoring significantly less than their average when he is on the court, which is why he has 3 DPOYs.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Goberts perimeter defense is better than people give him credit for.</p></li>

<li><p>Teams want Gobert away from the basket because it&rsquo;s much easier to score in general when he&rsquo;s away from the basket as he is an elite rim protector.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The result is he&rsquo;s an excellent defensive player but in a playoff series the team can spend all week planning on how to get him away from the basket. So when he&rsquo;s on the floor they score a bunch more around the rim then when hes off the floor.</p>

<p>This is just my theory, I don&rsquo;t have the advanced stats to back it up.</p>

We’d have to look a lot closer to see if the Jazz were actually better with let’s says Derrick Favors in instead of Gobert against the other teams best lineups.

      <label for="llms6jz" class="commentText"><p>The Gobert posts are beyond obnoxious because everyone just wants to get their easy upvote points on ‘lol rookies don’t know ball, Gobert has DPOY’s, they’re jealous of his contract’ and ‘all of the Gobert hate is ridiculous’ on the 50th post this week talking about how great Gobert is and downvoting anyone who wants to think about why he gets hate.</p>

<p>If I had to guess why Gobert’s teams are bad in the playoffs, weaknesses get amplified and coach’s try to adjust from another team’s strengths. Even this video is pretty stupid, ‘Gobert is shutting down perimeter players, lol Dereck Lively.’ The playoffs are not a 1 on 1 drill at the top of the key, a coach would try to get away from that being the emphasis of attack. What happens on the rest of the floor when Gobert is on the perimeter? Is Conley stuck on bigs? Is Edwards? Can I take advantage of that? Can I get KAT in some bad matchups on the perimeter because Gobert needs to help in the paint? If I get Gobert switched onto Kyrie on the perimeter, can Luka have free lanes to the basket on his side of the floor? If Gobert won’t switch onto Kyrie, is Kyrie getting loose for middies and 3’s? If Gobert is switching onto Jamal Murray, does Jokic get Conley defending him for an entire series? If Gobert keeps getting switched through screens and stuck in the corner defending a shooter he can’t leave, am I better off with a more versatile player who can chip in on offense? Is a defender who’s being put into positions where he can’t use his defense, and whose man on defense is being used to help elsewhere on the floor because his offense is limited, worth it if Naz Reid can at least make them pay on offense to stretch the defense?</p>

A few years back when the Clippers exposed Rudy, the strategy was to isolate him up top, take him off the dribble and force help, then swing to the open man.</p>

<p>I’m sure you could find the same data showing that he didn’t give up a high FG%. For example, as a Pacers fan, I know that Benedict Mathurin was a bit of a liability on the perimeter because he is WAAAAAYYYYY too aggressive going for steals. When he’s locked on, he’s amazing, but he gives up position constantly trying to get a steal.</p>

<p>I feel like he&rsquo;s improved in some respects (his hands used to be absolute stones) but I feel like initial impressions are so important in the NBA. A dude who was a phenom from day one will always get more respect than a guy who steadily improved and might even end up better than the first guy. There are <em>still</em> people that swear up and down that Kyrie is better than Steph because Kyrie was nice from day one and Steph just &ldquo;happened to get a good team around him&rdquo;</p>

<p>Also, people have weird expectations for perimeter defense, where if it doesn&rsquo;t look like rim protection, it&rsquo;s not defense.  Blocks are pretty rare close to the three point line, it&rsquo;s mostly about not getting crossed, closing passing lanes, and lowering the chance of an easy shot.  To some, that&rsquo;s not &ldquo;defense&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The criticism on Gobert is completely validated.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>For his contract, he should be adding offensive moves to his game every offseason but he never does. He hasn’t improved at all in 4-5 years in any facet of the game. His below average finish at the rim costs them games (even in the Olympics).</p>

<p>This isn’t hate. This is a constructive criticism.</p>

      <label for="llmgbk6" class="commentText"><p>Gobert tries hard and that much can&rsquo;t be argued, but he also makes himself a target in the media with the shit he does and says. He&rsquo;s low hanging fruit.</p>

<p>Defensively, Gobert is quite slow (which is more apparent when he&rsquo;s on the perimeter). The video shared shows exactly this, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising because he&rsquo;s a lumbering 7-footer. He&rsquo;s long, so he can recover well and he is smart so he doesn&rsquo;t commit too many bad fouls in tougher situations, but he&rsquo;s a mismatch on the perimeter against a crafty guard. He&rsquo;s an excellent off ball and post defender. But he&rsquo;s not a lockdown perimeter defender on the other team&rsquo;s best players. So he&rsquo;s a max contract player that can&rsquo;t make an open layup (it&rsquo;s dunk or nothing) and he&rsquo;s a liability when pulled out of the paint against a crafty scoring guard. Again, low hanging fruit for critics.</p>

      <label for="llmyfta" class="commentText"><p>No, the problem was Minny&rsquo;s guards could not stay in front of Luka and Kyrie at all, so they look practically unguardable. That&rsquo;s why Lively and Gafford was able to get so many lobs, because the Mavs would blow by their guards, then their big would have to chose between contesting the guards finishing at the rim or protect the lob and they couldn&rsquo;t do any of those things consistently.</p>

<p>People do underrate how much of a burden Gobert is offensively. You can reliably pass to him on offensive, so it puts the burden on the 4 other plays to perform and do something. It&rsquo;s not only his fault, but since he&rsquo;s a non-factor on offense you can provide a lot more help defense compared to other bigs.</p>

      <label for="llmtxr0" class="commentText"><p>It’s not only this but the fact that he is being paid a max because he provides the best rim protection in the league. However, plays like this show how easy it is to scheme up ways to pull him away from the rim. Even if he is surviving as a perimeter defender individually, on any play where he is drawn out and the action is away from his man, the team is not getting the max value of his contract because he’s no longer protecting the rim. It would be interesting to see a compilation of how easily teams score when Gobert is pulled out to the arc and the action is away from his matchup. While rim protection is a very important part of the defense, championship teams cannot afford to allocate a max deal to someone who offers little else in the other areas of the game</p>

Like he literally took on Kyrie and did a good job forcing tough shots in clutch lol.</p>

<p>There are also possessions like <a href="https://x.com/WolvesClips/status/1786899355804328243" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="https://x.com/WolvesClips/status/1793467254774104455" target="_blank">this</a> not shown where he plays great defense that forces players to pass out. But it&rsquo;s too long to add all those and this was not meant to be a highlight reel. He moves pretty quick for a center and if he gets beat, often he&rsquo;s able to backtrack and recover.</p>

<p>To me he looks like a decent perimeter defender and like all defenders, will get beat sometimes and won&rsquo;t be perfect every play. Since it&rsquo;s all plays, you&rsquo;ll see the full spectrum as it&rsquo;s not a highlight reel.</p>

<p>The fact he’s virtually inept on offence</p>

<p>and you base this on what exactly? He average 14.0 ppg last year. In his last 8 years, he&rsquo;s ranged between 13.4 ppg and 15.9 ppg (averaging 14.4 ppg for those seasons).  If you look at his numbers, he&rsquo;s a decent FT shooter, had a good eFG% (b/c no 3s), is a plus offensively (on the advanced stats), he&rsquo;s got a decent scoring average. His FG average &ndash; which is also his eFG% since he doesn&rsquo;t take 3s &ndash; during the last 8 years average ranged between .659 to .713 (on 8-9 FGA/game)&hellip;.</p>

<p>Yeah I&rsquo;m showing all shot attempts so some of them will be shots that the offensive player just misses (which is the case for any defender if you show all of the plays, and not just the highlights).</p>

<p>He gets beat sometimes, he can backtrack other times and he can also hold his own. Mostly I&rsquo;m seeing tough shots or rushed shots though, whether that be because he was able to stick with the guard the whole way through or he forced them into a direction where there was help defense.</p>

<p>This clip has players like Luka, Kyrie, and KD.</p>

<p>What makes it even funnier is you can see all the extra shading from the Wolves as soon as Rudy gets iso’d</p>

<p>But of course, The video doesn’t include any FGA from passes or drop offs so it’ll remain a mystery what happens when he actually got beat and that help slid over.</p>

<p>And no matter who is on those guys the defense would shade and help. That’s called Team defense.</p>

<p>And obviously not every team defense is equal… I feel like that would be obvious when it comes to the wolves. You know, a team known for over helping…?</p>

<p>Exactly, but a pass leading to an open 2 off the help all starts with the breakdown from Rudy…</p>

<p>No, he doesn&rsquo;t get exposed in the playoffs.</p>

<p>And no, he isn&rsquo;t a offensive liability, he is super efficient screen setter, rim runner, lob target and glass cleaner, it&rsquo;s the paradise for anyone who like to play pick and roll.</p>

<p>People talk about Rudy adding a post game but I think what would elevate his game is a short roll pass, if he could just receive the ball around the free throw line and pass to an open cutter (that Minnesota does not lack, the have size and athleticism at the wings), it would make things so much better.</p>

<p>Draymond is a great offensive piece in the Warriors system, Rudy could fill a similar role if he had a better court vision.</p>

      <label for="llmeywp" class="commentText"><p>Rudy Gobert is a fantastic rim protector, Possibly one of if not the greatest ever, hes so good that players dont even try layups as often as they otherwise would.</p>

<p>However, I do think he is definitely overrated and overhated. What he does is really amazing but my problem with him is how useless he seems on offense. I believe it eats into his usefulness as a whole.</p>

<p>There is also something to be said about how he is consistently on teams that underperform or have these meltdowns in the playoffs. It could be partly to do with his game or it could not I don’t know yet.</p>

      <label for="llmlyut" class="commentText"><p>Rudy is a court shifting defender. Like you said, you would notice nightly guys give up looks within 5 ft of the hoop because he is simply in the area. Offensively he is incredibly limited, but if teammates can feed him a couple times early for dunks he maintains an intensity offensively that builds momentum for the entire team. I think he is a much better passer than people give him credit for. He sets incredible screens. Our guys simply choose to rarely utilize them. Unfortunately a lot of what Go get offers is dependent on team buy in on both ends. If you have a mature responsible team with Gobert, it&rsquo;s a real problem for the league. If you leave him know an island he will get picked apart on both ends.</p>

      <label for="lln0x1n" class="commentText"><p>Look as a recovering Jazz fan I hate Gobert as the next person, but the conversation around him is completely wrong. The issue has never been his defense. I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s worth 4 DPOYs but he deserved at least some of those. No he isn&rsquo;t the best 1-on-1 defender in the league, but he&rsquo;s the best rim protector and the best team defense anchor in the league.</p>

<p>The real issue is his offense which allows opponents to use different lineups that then create issues on defense. Team will play 5 out which generally means smaller. Against most big men that would give the big an advantage on offense. But because Gobert has no offense outside of screening (which he&rsquo;s superb at), it actually creates a disadvantage because now the other team just switches everything and outside of defending against lobs can largely play 5 on 4.</p>

<p>So because Gobert can&rsquo;t punish the defense when they go small, they now have a smaller, faster team on the other end of the floor. They will be able to penetrate into the lane somewhere, draw in Gobert, and then kick it to someone open. Gobert was a bit unlucky during the Jazz years that the perimeter defense, particularly from guards, was abysmal. Conley was hurt, or Mitchell was hurt or disinterested, or the other guards were just bad. Defense collapsed easily, Gobert had to abandon a shooter, easy buckets. Gobert gets the blame because he&rsquo;s the one who rotates over, and the Jazz were horrific at defensive rotations, or were coached to stay home.</p>

<p>The Terance Mann game for example, Gobert was on him intentionally since the Jazz wanted to make him be the one to beat them. Gobert would help off him and nobody would rotate, and he has a buffet of open looks. Is that Gobert&rsquo;s fault? I&rsquo;d argue it was a mix of coaching and him being the one that rotates. If he just stayed on Mann he would&rsquo;ve had a quiet night but the Jazz would&rsquo;ve been giving up layups left and right. The blueprint for this had actually been created years earlier by Houston. Harden would get past Rubio or whoever easily, Gobert would help, Capela would get an easy lob. Teams saw that and said &ldquo;let&rsquo;s just put a shooter in the corner instead of a big in the dunker spot&rdquo; and it worked because Gobert can&rsquo;t back down someone six inches shorter than him in the paint on the other end of the floor.</p>

      <label for="lln2tgm" class="commentText"><p>I feel like so much of the hate Gobert gets about being overrated traces back to the days in Utah when teams like near-prime warriors would come in and shit on them. Ignoring, of course, that Gobert’s guards in Utah were barely distinguishable from turnstiles on defense, and he was put into positions even peak KG or Hakeem couldn’t have a hope.</p>

<p>He does leave some people more open than ideal on three pointers (welcome to being a big in drop defense), but if you actually watch that video, most of the shots that get made are well contested, and like half of them are Kevin Durant, who is universally acclaimed to be one of the greatest pure scorers in history. And also isn’t actually a smaller player.</p>

Is it because they can&rsquo;t do anything else they go for a midrange block layup block so they force into 3s but they still shoots 3 below constantly below average like give LeBron Rudy and a 3 point catch and shoot player he wins I think Rudy plays so good on defensive they think he is doing nothing because he makes it looks so easy</p>

      <label for="llmz8w2" class="commentText"><p>the truth is most people do not know how to watch defense besides man on man steals/blocks.  Even if you dont get a block an altered shot is insanely valuable But its hard to make a highlight real on things that didn&rsquo;t happen so people dont understand it.</p>

      <label for="lln446i" class="commentText"><p>I think mikal Bridges is a perfect example in a different way than Rudy like look at the COVID season I watched him almost exclusively terrible shot he still had a hitch in it but everything he did on defensive and passing wise I could not see or think of a better option than what he did and that what makes those players so good they make it look easy that you don&rsquo;t even realize how good they really are</p>
