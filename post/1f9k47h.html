But sit your ass down little bro lol. Gobert with no bag still averages a double double with consistently good defense. Makes me wanna go to a game this season with some Gobert merch and a sign. And I live in ATL lol.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s frustrating because there&rsquo;s so much Lively could learn by mimicking Gobert too, of course defensively, but also ofensively. He excels at his role as a great screener and rim runner.</p>

<p>Yesterday I had to read that Luka would be annoyed to play with Gobert. Why? It&rsquo;s not like he demands the ball in his hands or isn&rsquo;t one of the highest percentage finishers ever. Makes no sense&hellip;</p>

      <label for="llmghri" class="commentText"><p>No it isn’t. Contrary to popular belief it’s the Mavs offense that completely fell apart, the Celtics clamped them completely.</p>

<p>Mavs actually held Boston to their lowest ORTG of any playoff round I believe</p>

<p>Rudy is still getting cooked by Boston regardless lol, they have 5 out spacing with 4 players who can put the ball on the floor and attack. And he’s a worse roller than lively at this point due to his age and he also has no post game just like lively</p>

      <label for="llmkfod" class="commentText"><p>I am gonna hard disagree with “hard carried”. Lively was massive for us all year. When he was out a game in the Minnesota series it was like a different team was out there.</p>

<p>Talking shit on Gobert is probably him being young and buying into the online narrative particularly when he’s on the team that just knocked them out 4-1. He shouldn’t have been talking shit, but it is what it is.</p>

<p>I’m just here to defend some Lively slander. Dude balled out. Great rim protector, very good perimeter defender for his size, very good rim runner, and excellent decision maker in the short roll. He is definitely special and will be a top 5 center eventually imo</p>

When that turned out to be false you go to talk about specific times of the game like that helps your argument. Newsflash it doesn’t.</p>

<p>Sometimes people get the best of you. And you need to sit. It’s happened to every person that’s ever played the game. And every single DPOY winner. People go on stretches, sometimes nobody can stop someone for a little stretch. And acting like when Luka and Kyrie 2 of the best offensive players in the whole world are cooking that’s a terrible thing… News flash. Luka is gonna score 30 no matter who he is playing or who is guarding him.</p>

I love how he didn&rsquo;t win because his defense was only 11th one season when he literally had a worse defense around him that season than Wemby this season.  Donovan didn&rsquo;t even try.  Clarkson is arguably bottom 10 defender in the NBA.  Bogie is a horrible defender.  Jingles was washed on defense.  Conley was not good that season.  Royce was the only average or above average defender that year aside from Gobert and he was not good that season.</p>

Celtics didn&rsquo;t win because of a Gobert/Lively issue LOL Celtics have some of the most elite guard defenders in an age, combining speed, strength and smarts. Jrue, White, Tatum and Brown, in that order, absolutely shut down the hopes of any Kyrie penetration and Luka magic. Luka was also hurt. Give the Mavs 5 Goberts and they still don&rsquo;t stand a chance. It&rsquo;s why they got dominated even with KP injured. Completely out manned.</p>

<p>This all hurts my soul to say because I&rsquo;m a Raps fan, but can&rsquo;t for a second agree with any part of the C&rsquo;s in 6 or 7 lol they basically got SWEPT bro! Without KP! Gobert ain&rsquo;t making NO difference.</p>

<p>Offensive gravity, little bro. Gobert has no gravity outside of the restricted area. Yeah he puts up a nice 14ppg on good efficiency, but if you look up from your box score for a second you&rsquo;d see that it&rsquo;s all lobs and putbacks and that defenders can sag off him without getting punished, regularly. And if you put him in a position where he has to dribble even one time, your defense has already likely won that possession. We all know he has plenty of positive attributes that compensate for this, but we also can&rsquo;t ignore this reality.</p>

      <label for="llmcsyx" class="commentText"><p>Frankly it makes perfect sense. In addition to being unskilled, whether this sub like it or not, he’s viewed around the league as an overrated defender.</p>

<p>You’re naturally gonna shit talk a guy likely making more money than you and winning all the awards if you don’t think they’re earned.</p>

<p>He’s currently tied for the most defensive players of the year awards of any player in history - his peers (and this sub) dont even see him as the best defender in the league</p>

<p>You can agree with that or not but it’s what they think. And it’s not just a rookie and a benchwarmer, you can find countless players that range from scrubs to all-timers that hold that opinion</p>

<p>I do think he’s over-hated in a sense but as someone who has 4 DPOYS I don’t think he’s met his end of the bargain in the playoffs at all</p>

<p>Defensively, Gobert is quite slow (which is more apparent when he&rsquo;s on the perimeter). The video shared shows exactly this, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising because he&rsquo;s a lumbering 7-footer. He&rsquo;s long, so he can recover well and he is smart so he doesn&rsquo;t commit too many bad fouls in tougher situations, but he&rsquo;s a mismatch on the perimeter against a crafty guard. He&rsquo;s an excellent off ball and post defender. But he&rsquo;s not a lockdown perimeter defender on the other team&rsquo;s best players. So he&rsquo;s a max contract player that can&rsquo;t make an open layup (it&rsquo;s dunk or nothing) and he&rsquo;s a liability when pulled out of the paint against a crafty scoring guard. Again, low hanging fruit for critics.</p>

<p>Also, people have weird expectations for perimeter defense, where if it doesn&rsquo;t look like rim protection, it&rsquo;s not defense.  Blocks are pretty rare close to the three point line, it&rsquo;s mostly about not getting crossed, closing passing lanes, and lowering the chance of an easy shot.  To some, that&rsquo;s not &ldquo;defense&rdquo;.</p>

      <label for="llmfdk7" class="commentText"><p>Depends. There is a difference between criticism and hate.</p>

<p>The criticism on Gobert is completely validated.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>For his contract, he should be adding offensive moves to his game every offseason but he never does. He hasn’t improved at all in 4-5 years in any facet of the game. His below average finish at the rim costs them games (even in the Olympics).</p>

<p>This isn’t hate. This is a constructive criticism.</p>

      <label for="llm4rz8" class="commentText"><p>CREDIT to u/WolvesClips and u/PitlessBall on twitter for compiling many of the clips that I merged together in this video.</p>

<p>So does he get &ldquo;exposed&rdquo; by smaller players on the perimeter? You can decide for yourself. Humans naturally have confirmation bias and often generalize a few lowlights to create narratives which discounts all the other possessions. Looking at the whole sample provides a better picture.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<ol>
<li>IT&rsquo;S NOT A HIGHLIGHT REEL. It&rsquo;s showing all shot attempts (by perimeter players who iso-ed him) which includes lowlights and sometimes Gobert getting beat &amp; the opponent missing. You&rsquo;d see that variation for almost every defender if we showed <em>all</em> their iso D plays because no defender is perfect every play. I want to see the whole picture.</li>
<li>There were many possessions where Gobert defended a perimeter player well, which caused that player to pass out (<a href="https://x.com/WolvesClips/status/1786899355804328243" target="_blank">like here</a>), but it&rsquo;s hard to find all of those and the video would get too long (contrary to popular belief). So I just included that clip and the rest is shot attempts. Ironically, Gobert did this to Luka just a few possessions before the Luka stepback but unfortunately no one remembers those good defensive possessions or it is too subtle for people to recognize.</li>
<li>Pnr defense (<a href="https://x.com/WolvesClips/status/1793467254774104455" target="_blank">like this on Luka</a>) also not included (may be another video). Just isolation D on perimeter players who attempted a shot. If there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s not isolation D, let me know.</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall my takeaway was there are certainly some possessions where Gobert gets outright beat, but most of the isolated possessions end with forcing the offensive player into a tough, low % shot and that, more often than not, leads to a stop. This could be by sticking with the player the whole way and forcing the tough shot himself or leading the player into a direction where there&rsquo;s help D, so it becomes a tough shot.</p>

<p>Obviously not his best series but still very good Numbers. Ant was responsible for 40% of the Wolves offense production.</p>

<p>Kat - 23%</p>

<p>Naz - 14.5%</p>

<p>Kat never even had a playoff series ever scoring more than 21.2 ppg. That was his only series above 20 ppg btw</p>

<p>The fact he’s virtually inept on offence means he needs to be perfect defensively, and despite his strengths defending the rim, his struggles on the perimeter are too much of a hole for him to be making anywhere remotely close to his current salary.</p>

<p>If he was making 20-30 mil it would be alright, being on a max is inexcusable.</p>

      <label for="llmddwx" class="commentText"><p>From what I see among all the shot attempts, for most possessions he&rsquo;s still forcing tough shots or low % shots so &ldquo;struggles on the perimeter are too much of a hole&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t feel accurate. Like he literally took on Kyrie and did a good job forcing tough shots in clutch lol.</p>

<p>There are also possessions like <a href="https://x.com/WolvesClips/status/1786899355804328243" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="https://x.com/WolvesClips/status/1793467254774104455" target="_blank">this</a> not shown where he plays great defense that forces players to pass out. But it&rsquo;s too long to add all those and this was not meant to be a highlight reel. He moves pretty quick for a center and if he gets beat, often he&rsquo;s able to backtrack and recover.</p>

<p>To me he looks like a decent perimeter defender and like all defenders, will get beat sometimes and won&rsquo;t be perfect every play. Since it&rsquo;s all plays, you&rsquo;ll see the full spectrum as it&rsquo;s not a highlight reel.</p>

<p>The wolves Problem: playing both Kat and Rudy to compensate for each others weakness. Rudy and Kat combined would be the perfect modern C. </p>

<p>Playing both means the wolves lose out on a more dynamic Player at forward.</p>

<p>Kat and Rudy also clock up the paint a lot. They Limit Ants greatest strengths.</p>

<p>Naz is a better fit next to Ant than Kat </p>

<p>Yeah I&rsquo;m showing all shot attempts so some of them will be shots that the offensive player just misses (which is the case for any defender if you show all of the plays, and not just the highlights).</p>

<p>He gets beat sometimes, he can backtrack other times and he can also hold his own. Mostly I&rsquo;m seeing tough shots or rushed shots though, whether that be because he was able to stick with the guard the whole way through or he forced them into a direction where there was help defense.</p>

      <label for="llmemg4" class="commentText"><p>I hate when people try to diminish his defensive ability by saying &ldquo;well he gets targeted on the perimeter in the playoffs!&rdquo;</p>

<p>You mean teams try to get the best rim protector in the league <em>away</em> from the rim?? Shocker!</p>

<p>And his perimeter defense isn&rsquo;t even bad, he just doesn&rsquo;t have a Rudy Gobert to funnel the ball handler to</p>

      <label for="llmeywp" class="commentText"><p>Rudy Gobert is a fantastic rim protector, Possibly one of if not the greatest ever, hes so good that players dont even try layups as often as they otherwise would.</p>

<p>However, I do think he is definitely overrated and overhated. What he does is really amazing but my problem with him is how useless he seems on offense. I believe it eats into his usefulness as a whole.</p>

<p>There is also something to be said about how he is consistently on teams that underperform or have these meltdowns in the playoffs. It could be partly to do with his game or it could not I don’t know yet.</p>

<p>Since it&rsquo;s not a highlight reel and just all the iso shot attempts taken on him, we see the times he gets beat. If we saw all iso shot attempts for every defender, we&rsquo;d also see speed give them trouble at times because no one is perfect every play.</p>

The wild stuff I see is people sitting on the couch being like “uhh, how can legends and players who beat him not see how great he is?” If the centers playing against him and the historical best centers in history say he’s trash, maybe that’s more valuable than nebulous advanced stats that say he’s totally worth one of the biggest contracts in history. </p>

<p>This video isn&rsquo;t saying all the plays or late contests are good defense. <strong>It&rsquo;s not a highlight reel</strong>, it&rsquo;s <em>alll</em> the shot attempts taken on him in iso by perimeter players. So there are late contests, there are lowlights, there are highlights, it&rsquo;s just showing everything.</p>

<p>If you show everything for any defender, you&rsquo;d also see late contests and times they got beat. But for the most part, he did pretty well for a center. He even forced Kyrie into tough shots (last 20 seconds of this video) which is really impressive for a 7 footer.</p>

<p>Maybe I should have just done a highlight reel because people aren&rsquo;t getting that I&rsquo;m showing everything lol. It doesn&rsquo;t even include the clips he made players pass out.</p>

But a lot of the shots are tough, pushed into help defense, rushed or low probability long 2s. I thought his defense on Kyrie was impressive for a 7 footer (the last 20 seconds of the video).</p>

<p>Also, it&rsquo;s not meant to be a highlight reel. I&rsquo;m just showing everything so we see the whole picture, so that includes lowlights. He didn&rsquo;t get played off the court either, he was literally on the court for big moments and clutch time in every series lol.</p>

<p>No, he doesn&rsquo;t get exposed in the playoffs.</p>

<p>And no, he isn&rsquo;t a offensive liability, he is super efficient screen setter, rim runner, lob target and glass cleaner, it&rsquo;s the paradise for anyone who like to play pick and roll.</p>

<p>People talk about Rudy adding a post game but I think what would elevate his game is a short roll pass, if he could just receive the ball around the free throw line and pass to an open cutter (that Minnesota does not lack, the have size and athleticism at the wings), it would make things so much better.</p>

<p>Draymond is a great offensive piece in the Warriors system, Rudy could fill a similar role if he had a better court vision.</p>

      <label for="llm8rs0" class="commentText"><p>A honest question coming from a suns fan I don&rsquo;t like or dislike Rudy he a fine player to me but honestly why do all the players shoot 3s against him? Is it because they can&rsquo;t do anything else they go for a midrange block layup block so they force into 3s but they still shoots 3 below constantly below average like give LeBron Rudy and a 3 point catch and shoot player he wins I think Rudy plays so good on defensive they think he is doing nothing because he makes it looks so easy</p>

      <label for="llmdw3c" class="commentText"><p>seeing as you asked</p>

<p>Shot 5 is a pretty much uncontested 3, so is shot 7</p>

<p>Shots 8 and 9 are very barely contested layups KD makes <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> times like in shot 14</p>

<p>10 and 11 are wide open as you said</p>

<p>Same with 14</p>

<p>17 and 18 are very late contests and wont have affected the shot</p>

<p>19 is not even Rudy&rsquo;s contest, dunno why its in this vid, Gobert gets beaten</p>

<p>20 late contest, wont have affected the shot as you mentioned</p>

<p>23 is a late contest, but Irving travels so cant really fault Gobert there</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;d say the opponents got good looks <sup>11</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub> times. Very good D from Gobert tbh, but to act like only 4 of these shots are good looks is disingenuous</p>

      <label for="llmhnjk" class="commentText"><p>On both shots 5 and 7 Rudy has his hand up less than a foot of the ball, Booker doesn’t create any separation and has 0 rhythm on shot 7. 5 is a decent look but I definitely don’t think it’s a good look.</p>

<p>There’s no way you think KD makes 90% of shots like 8 and 9, Rudy’s body is stuck to KD’s at all time and he has one hand covering the rim any time the ball gets to the paint.</p>

<p>14 is a good look I don’t know how I forgot about this one</p>

<p>Gibert closes the distance instantly on 17, he was never blocking that shot but a midrange step back with only decent separation from a 6’3 guard isn’t a good shot. If KD had that same separation it would be different</p>

<p>18 is a big step back corner 3 where Murray gets plenty of separation, I can see how it’s considered a good shot, I just don’t think a shot of that nature can be seen as a good look. But perfectly reasonable to consider it a good look and probably should be</p>

<p>23 could also be considered a good look, Kyrie gets much more time than Murray on 17.</p>

<p>I think <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub> is where I’m at after feedback</p>

      <label for="llmercl" class="commentText"><p>Are you only considering good looks to be completely uncontested?</p>

<p>Because there are a bunch of late contests or just complete weak contests. Like Beal step back and step through, the KD snatch, etc. Then there’s clips like the Luka Dirk fade where he just split switched and it was Naz who contested, which I am not sure why it included.</p>

<p>To me a good look is a possession that you’d be happy to have 3 times a quarter and it only with your star shotmakers. A face up 3 with Gobert’s hand already up like in 18 would have had Suns fans balding if it happened multiple times.</p>

<p>I feel people call every contests when a step back happens late. With Murray’s midrange the separation he created was nullified quickly, Gobert wouldn’t have blocked that shot but it’s definitely contested</p>

      <label for="llm9dpf" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not trying to highlight only good plays, I&rsquo;m just showing all shot attempts when a perimeter player isolated on him. So yes that will includes clips when players do get to their spots but just miss. I don&rsquo;t see &ldquo;majority&rdquo; good looks though?</p>

<p>I see plays when he&rsquo;s just beat and leaves too much space, other plays when there&rsquo;s space but he&rsquo;s able to recover back and contest, some plays where he has good lateral movement and he either forces them into a tough layup himself or forces the opponent into a direction with help so it&rsquo;s a tough layup, and also plays where he holds his own. Also sometimes when the opposing player does get to their spot,  they are rushing the shot to get it off before he can contest or recover back. Making an opponent hurry a shot is also defense, because it&rsquo;s a shot not in rhythm.</p>

<p>These clips shows the whole spectrum because like most defenders, they won&rsquo;t be perfect every play. It&rsquo;s not supposed to be a highlight reel.</p>

<p>Overall my takeaway was there are certainly some possessions where Gobert gets outright beat, but most of the isolated possessions are where he forces the offensive player into a tough, low % shot and that, more often than not, leads to a stop.</p>
