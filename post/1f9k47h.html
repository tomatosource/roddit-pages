But sit your ass down little bro lol. Gobert with no bag still averages a double double with consistently good defense. Makes me wanna go to a game this season with some Gobert merch and a sign.

<p>Add that to the fact that nobody else in the nba really gets paid like him while being so limited offensively, and itll draw a lot of criticism/jealousy from his peers</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s frustrating because there&rsquo;s so much Lively could learn by mimicking Gobert too, of course defensively, but also ofensively. He excels at his role as a great screener and rim runner.</p>

<p>Yesterday I had to read that Luka would be annoyed to play with Gobert. Why? It&rsquo;s not like he demands the ball in his hands or isn&rsquo;t one of the highest percentage finishers ever. Makes no sense&hellip;</p>

<p>Well, you&rsquo;d normally expect the opposite. Having to put a face to your words and see the person the next day (or whenever you play MIN) tends to make you less willing to run your mouth.</p>

      <label for="llmip36" class="commentText"><p>Haaaaaaaaa BRO! Celtics didn&rsquo;t win because of a Gobert/Lively issue LOL Celtics have some of the most elite guard defenders in an age, combining speed, strength and smarts. Jrue, White, Tatum and Brown, in that order, absolutely shut down the hopes of any Kyrie penetration and Luka magic. Luka was also hurt. Give the Mavs 5 Goberts and they still don&rsquo;t stand a chance. It&rsquo;s why they got dominated even with KP injured. Completely out manned.</p>

<p>This all hurts my soul to say because I&rsquo;m a Raps fan, but can&rsquo;t for a second agree with any part of the C&rsquo;s in 6 or 7 lol they basically got SWEPT bro! Without KP! Gobert ain&rsquo;t making NO difference.</p>

      <label for="llmwi21" class="commentText"><p>xD You think a team that struggled offensively in the finals would be a even better team if you give them a player with stone hands and minimum offensive ability? A reminder that the Cs won without Porzingis playing 90% of the minutes and when he did play he was completely unguardable. That series was further apart than people realize, it took an injury and the Celtics two Star players playing like ass compared to their usual level and despite that they still won the series in 5 games.</p>

      <label for="llm4rz8" class="commentText"><p>CREDIT to u/WolvesClips and u/PitlessBall on twitter for compiling many of the clips that I merged together in this video.</p>

<p>So does he get exposed by smaller players on the perimeter? You can decide for yourself. Humans naturally have confirmation bias and often generalize a few lowlights to create narratives which discounts all the other possessions. Looking at the whole sample provides a better picture. I saw people talking about it the other day and saw a video compiling the possessions so thought it would be interesting to post this. Take it whatever way you want.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<ol>
<li>IT&rsquo;S <strong>NOT</strong> A HIGHLIGHT REEL. It&rsquo;s showing all shot attempts (by perimeter players who iso-ed him) so nothing is cherry picked and it includes lowlights or times he&rsquo;s beat. You&rsquo;d see that variation for almost every defender if we showed <em>all</em> their iso D plays because no defender is perfect every play. I want to see the whole picture.</li>
<li>There were many possessions where Gobert defended a perimeter player well, which caused that player to pass out (<a href="https://x.com/WolvesClips/status/1786899355804328243" target="_blank">like here</a>), but it&rsquo;s hard to find all of those and the video would get too long. So I just included that linked clip and the rest is shot attempts compiled from u/PitlessBall. Ironically, Gobert&rsquo;s defense forced a Luka pass a few possessions before the Luka stepback but unfortunately no one remembers those good defensive possessions or it is too subtle for people to recognize.</li>
<li>Pnr defense (<a href="https://x.com/WolvesClips/status/1793467254774104455" target="_blank">like this on Luka</a>) also not included (may be another video). Just isolation D on perimeter players who attempted a shot.</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall my takeaway was there are certainly some possessions where Gobert gets outright beat, but most of the isolated possessions end with forcing the offensive player into a tough, low % shot and that, more often than not, leads to a stop. This could be by sticking with the player the whole way and forcing the tough shot himself or leading the player into a direction where there&rsquo;s help D, so it becomes a tough shot.</p>

<p>Edit: I REPEAT, IT&rsquo;S <strong>NOT</strong> A HIGHLIGHT REEL. So if you&rsquo;re wondering &ldquo;why is Gobert getting beat included?&rdquo; it&rsquo;s because the video isn&rsquo;t trying to show something good or bad, just every shot attempt. If anything, the video is missing a lot of highlights - all the times his perimeter defense made a player pass out and not even attempt a shot. It&rsquo;s just a reel I thought was interesting lol, take it the way you want.</p>

<p>But usually I use <a href="https://thehighlow.io/" target="_blank">https://thehighlow.io/</a> - you can search any game, any player and any type of defensive or offensive play. It automatically gets you the clips. I love this site, it&rsquo;s amazing with great quality. You can also use <a href="https://bucketlist.fans/" target="_blank">https://bucketlist.fans/</a> which does a similar thing but the clips are shorter.</p>

<p>Other times, I manually record the time in the game I see interesting defensive plays while watching. Then I go to <a href="http://basketball-video.com" target="_blank">basketball-video.com</a> and snip the clip I want. More tedious of course but things like deterrence are sadly not captured in the sites above because those plays aren&rsquo;t recorded as conventional stats.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m like the video isn&rsquo;t trying to show good or bad defense&hellip;it&rsquo;s just all the shot attempts by perimeter players iso-ing on Rudy. Of course a defender won&rsquo;t be great on every single play!</p>

<p>And they still don&rsquo;t get it 😂 Like y&rsquo;all there&rsquo;s no agenda, it&rsquo;s just a video you can take how you want. If anything it leaves out highlights lol</p>

<p>Example - the <a href="https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612747&amp;Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=203076" target="_blank">2020 Lakers</a> had a better DRTG with AD off the floor</p>

<p>Another one - from <a href="https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612759&amp;Season=2015-16,2014-15,2013-14&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PlayerIds=202695" target="_blank">2014-2016</a> in the playoffs the Spurs had a better DRTG with Kawhi off the floor, that includes his DPOY year</p>

<p>There is too much randomness in terms of lineups and other factors, even with a large sample size, for a team stat like DRTG to paint a full picture of an individual player.</p>

<p>in the playoffs, it&rsquo;s magnified more because a lot of starters play around 40 minutes per game, so one 12-2 run while you&rsquo;re sitting can completely alter an individual&rsquo;s +/-</p>

      <label for="llmrxpb" class="commentText"><p>Like everyone is saying, just using net offense and defense, aka +- is a bad indication of how someone individually does. Using your same reference, the warriors are better offensively with Curry on the bench than with him in the game. Rotations are a complex component of basketball.</p>

<p>Rudy Gobert is by far one of the best help defenders in the nba. Wemby will take that spot soon or already has but people struggle to see how defenses have specific styles in which they are coached to play. Several times in the dallas series, minnesota let gobert stay on the switch when they obviously werent wanting to do. Luka’s game winner should have never happened because a trap should have occurred like every top 5 offensive player gets when they are one on one near the end of the game. That was poor coaching and play calling.</p>

      <label for="llmyk18" class="commentText"><p>There are just way more variables that go into a team&rsquo;s defensive rating than you&rsquo;re considering. One is that having a player like Gobert on the floor allows a coach to play great offensive players who are defensive liabilities at the same time, since he can cover up a lot of mistakes. You&rsquo;ll notice that while Minnesota&rsquo;s defense is a point better when Gobert is off the floor, the offense is almost 15(!) points worse.</p>

<p>You also have to consider that defense and offense are not independent of one another. Rudy&rsquo;s offensive limitations, especially his tendency to turn the ball over (1.6/game is a lot for a defensive-minded center who doesn&rsquo;t often handle the ball) can lead to fast break opportunities for the opponent where Rudy is behind the ball, which affects the team&rsquo;s defensive rating while he&rsquo;s on the floor but isn&rsquo;t actually caused by a lack of defensive ability. He is also among the league leaders in offensive rebounding, which is a positive offensive trait but also a trade-off for getting back on defense.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Gobert is regularly near the top of the league in stocks (steals + blocks), which can lead to fast break opportunities for his team. Additionally, his rim protection means opponents shoot more midrange and three-point shots, which can also lead to long rebounds and transition offense.</p>

<p>But even experts who know 1000x more about basketball than either you or I have difficulty quantifying defensive impact, so I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s sufficient to use something as crude as on-off team defensive rating to proclaim that someone is or isn&rsquo;t a great defender.</p>

      <label for="llmkye6" class="commentText"><p>Honestly based on the Mavs series a problem a Gobert team can face with him on vs off is that they build everything around him locking the paint. Luka toyed with him and used his lob threats to perfection. The Wolves didn’t find an adjustment and relied on him to figure it out. The moment he can’t then they’re disorganized. Its clear that he’s a positive on Defense and an all time rim protector, but he does indeed have weakneses and him or his team struggle to adjust cause he is mostly a one trick player and they fail to add layers to the defense to help him.</p>

      <label for="llnc5gm" class="commentText"><p>This. His defense has never really been the &ldquo;exposed&rdquo; part of his playoff performances. Yeah he&rsquo;s going to get cooked on switches on the perimeter at times by quicker players but A. his perimeter defense has clearly improved and B. being the rim protector and inside post deterrent that he is it&rsquo;s the team defense that needs to optimize for funneling traffic towards him in the post and keep him off the perimeter as much as possible.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s his offense that kills his teams once the opposing defense can figure out how to contain him, which in turn will negatively effect the spacing for everyone else out there.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Goberts perimeter defense is better than people give him credit for.</p></li>

<li><p>Teams want Gobert away from the basket because it&rsquo;s much easier to score in general when he&rsquo;s away from the basket as he is an elite rim protector.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The result is he&rsquo;s an excellent defensive player but in a playoff series the team can spend all week planning on how to get him away from the basket. So when he&rsquo;s on the floor they score a bunch more around the rim then when hes off the floor.</p>

<p>This is just my theory, I don&rsquo;t have the advanced stats to back it up.</p>

      <label for="llnerm4" class="commentText"><p>This is pretty much spot on. Gobert is above-average in iso defense, but he is much, much better around the rim where he can deter, help, and command the defense. So the smart defensive play is to pull him away from the rim, which is why teams scheme to do that.</p>

<p>edit: This is from a couple years ago during his 3rd DPOY season, but you get the picture

<p>There’s a much larger sample of opponents scoring significantly less than their average when he is on the court, which is why he has 3 DPOYs.</p>

<p>Was there also plays where he gets beat 1v1 which leads to defense helping and then an open 3 ? From these clips it seems like the other 4 were staying on their guys so I&rsquo;m guessing not a lot, but I&rsquo;m curious if teams tried this approach.</p>

<p>I feel like he&rsquo;s improved in some respects (his hands used to be absolute stones) but I feel like initial impressions are so important in the NBA. A dude who was a phenom from day one will always get more respect than a guy who steadily improved and might even end up better than the first guy. There are <em>still</em> people that swear up and down that Kyrie is better than Steph because Kyrie was nice from day one and Steph just &ldquo;happened to get a good team around him&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="llnbvmf" class="commentText"><p>He’s not unskilled though. He just isn’t a good jump shooter. But he’s 5th in box outs, 4th in contested shots, 2nd in screen assists, he has led the league 3x in true shooting and FG% while scoring 14+ ppg. He is excellent at defense, dirty work, and plays a clear offensive role extremely efficiently.</p>

<p>Ball handling and perimeter shooting aren’t the only skills in the NBA. There’s a reason Rudy makes max money and other “low skill” bigs are on minimum contracts.</p>

<p>Also, people have weird expectations for perimeter defense, where if it doesn&rsquo;t look like rim protection, it&rsquo;s not defense.  Blocks are pretty rare close to the three point line, it&rsquo;s mostly about not getting crossed, closing passing lanes, and lowering the chance of an easy shot.  To some, that&rsquo;s not &ldquo;defense&rdquo;.</p>

      <label for="llmyfta" class="commentText"><p>No, the problem was Minny&rsquo;s guards could not stay in front of Luka and Kyrie at all, so they look practically unguardable. That&rsquo;s why Lively and Gafford was able to get so many lobs, because the Mavs would blow by their guards, then their big would have to chose between contesting the guards finishing at the rim or protect the lob and they couldn&rsquo;t do any of those things consistently.</p>

<p>People do underrate how much of a burden Gobert is offensively. You can reliably pass to him on offensive, so it puts the burden on the 4 other plays to perform and do something. It&rsquo;s not only his fault, but since he&rsquo;s a non-factor on offense you can provide a lot more help defense compared to other bigs.</p>

      <label for="llmtxr0" class="commentText"><p>It’s not only this but the fact that he is being paid a max because he provides the best rim protection in the league. However, plays like this show how easy it is to scheme up ways to pull him away from the rim. Even if he is surviving as a perimeter defender individually, on any play where he is drawn out and the action is away from his man, the team is not getting the max value of his contract because he’s no longer protecting the rim. It would be interesting to see a compilation of how easily teams score when Gobert is pulled out to the arc and the action is away from his matchup. While rim protection is a very important part of the defense, championship teams cannot afford to allocate a max deal to someone who offers little else in the other areas of the game</p>

<p>Yeah I&rsquo;m showing all shot attempts so some of them will be shots that the offensive player just misses (which is the case for any defender if you show all of the plays, and not just the highlights).</p>

<p>He gets beat sometimes, he can backtrack other times and he can also hold his own. Mostly I&rsquo;m seeing tough shots or rushed shots though, whether that be because he was able to stick with the guard the whole way through or he forced them into a direction where there was help defense.</p>

<p>No, he doesn&rsquo;t get exposed in the playoffs.</p>

<p>And no, he isn&rsquo;t a offensive liability, he is super efficient screen setter, rim runner, lob target and glass cleaner, it&rsquo;s the paradise for anyone who like to play pick and roll.</p>

<p>People talk about Rudy adding a post game but I think what would elevate his game is a short roll pass, if he could just receive the ball around the free throw line and pass to an open cutter (that Minnesota does not lack, the have size and athleticism at the wings), it would make things so much better.</p>

<p>Draymond is a great offensive piece in the Warriors system, Rudy could fill a similar role if he had a better court vision.</p>

      <label for="lln2tgm" class="commentText"><p>I feel like so much of the hate Gobert gets about being overrated traces back to the days in Utah when teams like near-prime warriors would come in and shit on them. Ignoring, of course, that Gobert’s guards in Utah were barely distinguishable from turnstiles on defense, and he was put into positions even peak KG or Hakeem couldn’t have a hope.</p>

<p>He does leave some people more open than ideal on three pointers (welcome to being a big in drop defense), but if you actually watch that video, most of the shots that get made are well contested, and like half of them are Kevin Durant, who is universally acclaimed to be one of the greatest pure scorers in history. And also isn’t actually a smaller player.</p>

I think all but 1 of the times Rudy/Utah lost in the playoffs, the opponent was top 5 in regular season offense</p>

      <label for="lln0x1n" class="commentText"><p>Look as a recovering Jazz fan I hate Gobert as the next person, but the conversation around him is completely wrong. The issue has never been his defense. I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s worth 4 DPOYs but he deserved at least some of those. No he isn&rsquo;t the best 1-on-1 defender in the league, but he&rsquo;s the best rim protector and the best team defense anchor in the league.</p>

<p>The real issue is his offense which allows opponents to use different lineups that then create issues on defense. Team will play 5 out which generally means smaller. Against most big men that would give the big an advantage on offense. But because Gobert has no offense outside of screening (which he&rsquo;s superb at), it actually creates a disadvantage because now the other team just switches everything and outside of defending against lobs can largely play 5 on 4.</p>

<p>So because Gobert can&rsquo;t punish the defense when they go small, they now have a smaller, faster team on the other end of the floor. They will be able to penetrate into the lane somewhere, draw in Gobert, and then kick it to someone open. Gobert was a bit unlucky during the Jazz years that the perimeter defense, particularly from guards, was abysmal. Conley was hurt, or Mitchell was hurt or disinterested, or the other guards were just bad. Defense collapsed easily, Gobert had to abandon a shooter, easy buckets. Gobert gets the blame because he&rsquo;s the one who rotates over, and the Jazz were horrific at defensive rotations, or were coached to stay home.</p>

<p>The Terance Mann game for example, Gobert was on him intentionally since the Jazz wanted to make him be the one to beat them. Gobert would help off him and nobody would rotate, and he has a buffet of open looks. Is that Gobert&rsquo;s fault? I&rsquo;d argue it was a mix of coaching and him being the one that rotates. If he just stayed on Mann he would&rsquo;ve had a quiet night but the Jazz would&rsquo;ve been giving up layups left and right. The blueprint for this had actually been created years earlier by Houston. Harden would get past Rubio or whoever easily, Gobert would help, Capela would get an easy lob. Teams saw that and said &ldquo;let&rsquo;s just put a shooter in the corner instead of a big in the dunker spot&rdquo; and it worked because Gobert can&rsquo;t back down someone six inches shorter than him in the paint on the other end of the floor.</p>

I think the Smart one was ridiculous and just voter fatigue, but I also understand why people hate that he keeps winning them. I can understand both sides of it, but regardless, he&rsquo;s easily one of the best defenders in the league and it&rsquo;s still to argue otherwise. He&rsquo;s a very flawed player and can hinder a team, but the issues on defense are rarely his fault.</p>

<p>However, I do think he is definitely overrated and overhated. What he does is really amazing but my problem with him is how useless he seems on offense. I believe it eats into his usefulness as a whole.</p>

<p>There is also something to be said about how he is consistently on teams that underperform or have these meltdowns in the playoffs. It could be partly to do with his game or it could not I don’t know yet.</p>

      <label for="llmlyut" class="commentText"><p>Rudy is a court shifting defender. Like you said, you would notice nightly guys give up looks within 5 ft of the hoop because he is simply in the area. Offensively he is incredibly limited, but if teammates can feed him a couple times early for dunks he maintains an intensity offensively that builds momentum for the entire team. I think he is a much better passer than people give him credit for. He sets incredible screens. Our guys simply choose to rarely utilize them. Unfortunately a lot of what Go get offers is dependent on team buy in on both ends. If you have a mature responsible team with Gobert, it&rsquo;s a real problem for the league. If you leave him know an island he will get picked apart on both ends.</p>

      <label for="llnp404" class="commentText"><p>Do his teams really underperform in the playoffs?</p>

<p>With Utah he made the playoffs 6 times. Five of the six they were the 5 seed or worse (aka expected to lose in the 1st round). They went 2-3 in the first rounds those seasons, and 0-2 in the 2nd round. Four of the five losses were to either the peak Warriors or the Harden rockets, the other loss was the crazy bubble series with the Nuggets.</p>

<p>The only season they underperformed in the playoffs was 20-21 when they finished top of the league and lost in the 2nd round. Worth mentioning that both Conley and Mitchell were injured in that series against the Clippers (as was Kawhi), would have liked to see how it played out with both teams fully healthy.</p>

<p>His first season in Minnesota they struggled to gel a bit and ended up as the 8th seed, losing in the first round. Then last year they made the confeence finals as the 3 seed. Ya, maybe they were favored against the Mavs, but they also upset the 1 seed defending champs along the way.</p>

Cant tell you how many comment replies I got telling me my bloodline isn’t shit and my life is horrible because I simply think Theo Pinson’s opinion of Gobert is outlandish.

<p>But by certain players.</p>

<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t rate the perimeter defense by the shots made out of missed, but instead the comfort level of said perimeter players and the quality of shots they can create.</p>

<p>Against Beal, Porter and Murray Gobert guarded them nicely.</p>

<p>Against Durant Booker and Luka they were well within their comfort zone and got almost anything they wanted or had open shots the vast majority of the time.</p>

<p>Also the small sample size of perimeter players trying to shoot when iso-ing on him, so maybe he&rsquo;s not as hunted as people say? Because this is the whole sample of shot attempts from perimeter players.</p>

<p>(Although the times Gobert defended the player well that the player passed out and didn&rsquo;t attempt the shot aren&rsquo;t included in this video.) So I&rsquo;m not sure what the actual number of attempts to iso on Rudy are if we include those &ldquo;nvm I don&rsquo;t want to iso him after all&rdquo; plays.</p>

<li><p>Since offense is so important in todays nba, you can’t expect a guy to mishandle lobs and provide so little on offense when he makes $45 million</p></li>

      <label for="llnilaq" class="commentText"><p>It doesn’t seem like he gets cooked more than any other player defending the perimeter. A lot of the narrative is made up because he’s one of the more hated players in the league. That and some of those terrible Utah defenses really hung him out to dry a lot of times.</p>

      <label for="llnit8c" class="commentText"><p>Great compilation. Agreed Rudy gets too much hate, but at the same time he can&rsquo;t stay on the court in important late game situations (playing minimally in France Olympics final game for example) because of his offensive liability / lack of spacing / poor playmaking.</p>
