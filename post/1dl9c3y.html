      <label for="l9nabo5" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve said this so many times it&rsquo;s crazy. People fixated on his left hand but his biggest problem was him getting in situations not even Kyrie Irving could dribble through. That&rsquo;s why specific teams like Miami could target it, but against other teams it wasn&rsquo;t a problem.</p>

<p>His biggest improvement this year wasn&rsquo;t having a better handle, but having the wherewithal of understanding where the defenders and help were situated and knowing where his teammates would be if he was caught in a bad spot. That&rsquo;s why Kristaps was so beneficial early in the year, because it seemed any time Jaylen dribbled himself into traffic he could find Kristaps for an open bucket.</p>

      <label for="l9ng7qa" class="commentText"><p>People acted like it was this huge deal and breakthrough strategy about how to defend brown by forcing him left. Literally every single player in the nba has tendencies that are meticulously studied and has a scouting report which will always include which way to force them, whether to send help, when they like to fake or pass or shoot etc. Big surprise, almost every nba player gets defended forced towards their off hand. But &ldquo;jaylen left hand bad&rdquo; is way easier for the media to spin than actual evaluation of how he handles help defense, tunnel vision, or trying to take advantage of floor spacing.</p>
