<p>Were we watching the same video? There was no &ldquo;running&rdquo; in the entire clip.</p>

<p>He was doing everything the right way, to the degree I can imagine my college coach screaming at our team, &ldquo;SEE KNUCKLEHEADS, THIS IS SMART TEAM DEFENSE!&rdquo; But he&rsquo;s playing at preseason speed, and it&rsquo;s not clear whether his body will let him move in the way he&rsquo;ll need to during the playoffs 82 games down the line.</p>

      <label for="lrgilmm" class="commentText"><p>I think this is wishful thinking, but who knows maybe I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>

<p>The issue isn&rsquo;t what Klay does with fresh legs. The issue is what he does down the stretch of a playoff run. Klay wasn&rsquo;t somehow playing worse defense because the Warriors roster or scheme didn&rsquo;t allow him to play better defense, the Warriors dribble penetration defense was putrid last year and Klay was a huge part of that.</p>

<p>maybe the Mavericks rim protection makes some of this more allowable, but I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re getting a plus defender no matter what.</p>

      <label for="lrglzkc" class="commentText"><p>We aren’t asking him to be an elite defender anymore. People look at our starting lineup and think Luka, Kai and Klay are gonna share the court for 40 minutes a game. It’s just not the case. One of those 3 will be on the bench for the majority of the game and will be replaced with one of Naji,  Grimes and Exum when he’s back who are all above average to great defenders.</p>

<p>I think you’re seeing a natural pushback from Mavs fans after hearing all summer about how Klay is completely washed. He’s about to be 35, we know he’s lost a step. But we’re paying him 15M a year not 40m. I think he’s gonna be just fine in his role here.</p>

      <label for="lrgn3hb" class="commentText"><p>I think he might well be fine in his role there, it just depends on what people are expecting his role to be.</p>

<p>To clearly add context to my caveat in the first post, I am opening the chance that I will be surprised by the Klay that comes out this year, as a lot of his issues last stemmed from his unhappiness with his own decline and it led to a lot of bad play that was directly due to bad decision-making or lack of effort, not purely physical ability.</p>

<p>That said, Klay was a player the Warriors had to actively hide defensively most of last season. They played him as effectively a small stretch 4, didn&rsquo;t ask him to guard on the perimeter, and teams tried to target him (successfully, I might add) by bringing his man into actions and not letting him hide on the low block.</p>

<p>Maybe that changes, but the Warriors chose to <em>not</em> hide a 36-year old Steph from being the main guard defender because he was doing a better job than Klay was capable of, which led to Steph being absolutely gassed by season&rsquo;s end. If Klay was capable of doing more defensively, the Warriors would have <em>loved</em> to get that contribution.</p>

Basically all of this interviews so far have mentioned being in a better headspace and hoping to start fresh in a new environment. I won’t pretend to know the intricacies of everything that went down with the Warriors last year but it’s often helpful to move on to a new place when moving into a new role.</p>

<p>But also for most Mavs fans, he’s replacing Tim Hardaway Jr who was a horrendous defender who was unplayable by the end of the year. And he’s making less money than him. Just being playable is an improvement to our roster so I feel he’s going to get a pretty big leash from the fanbase just based on that.</p>

      <label for="lrgpeup" class="commentText"><p>I think Klay in a good mindset can still be a super valuable player, which is why the Warriors were still wanting to retain him but also were trying to make sure he understood that him returning probably meant him coming off the bench a decent amount of the time, which had been such a thorny issue during the season.</p>

<p>I think the reason his defense gets pointed to is because if you want him to replace DJJ or be a guy who allows you to reduce the defensive responsibility of Luka or Kyrie, that probably isn&rsquo;t going to work out. If you need a sniper off the bench, he might be the best guy in the league in that role, assuming he fully accept everything that comes with it.</p>

      <label for="lrgqd8s" class="commentText"><p>He’s definitely starting, at least for the first few months. I can just see him capping out in the 25 minute range. And the way we keep one of Luka and Kai on the floor at all times means that we can run most of Klay’s minutes playing next to 2 plus defenders (PJ, Grimes, Exum, Naji) and consistent rim protection with 48 minutes of Lively and Gafford.</p>

<p>I actually wouldn’t be surprised if he doesn’t close games either, especially down the stretch. But yeah time will tell if his ego can handle that.</p>

<p>Surprised that this is somehow the conclusion you came to instead of Steph being tired from sharing the back court with an objectively worse defender in Podz. I saw Steph having to run and close out on so many corner shooters after Podz sagged to try and take a charge/grab a board or after Kuminga/Moody died on a screen.</p>

<p>To place the blame on Klay for Steph being gassed and not the absolutely anemic offensive options we&rsquo;ve surrounded Steph with is certainly a choice.</p>

<p>to support your point,</p>

<ul>
<li>look how high Lively is positioned on the screen by Kessler, he&rsquo;s beyond the 3pt line ready to help Klay and switch onto the ballhandler</li>
<li>2nd possession, look as Klay switches frame 1 along the perimeter. #8 gets stuck momentarily but the quick scram switch afterwards seems to indicate the defensive plan is to switch any ballscreens where Klay might lose a step on his assignment</li>
<li>later on, look how high Gafford steps up (beyond the 3pt line, like Lively), ready to help Klay.</li>

Do they want validation that the entire defensive system is built to negate how awful klay is on defense even with fresh legs, and he didn&rsquo;t visibly self destruct in the chosen samples?</p>

<p>I love klay and he used to be a monster defensively, but you need to set expectations that he will absolutely continue to be a liability on defense and hope by managing rotations and minutes his offense offsets the defense.</p>

      <label for="lrhqdr0" class="commentText"><p>Also underrated is that even though Klay is not a great defender anymore, the fact that he is playing with Kyrie and Luka means that if a defense wants to pick on someone, he&rsquo;s not going to be at the top of the list and he, Luka, and Kyrie can switch everything other than maybe Kyrie onto some 4s that Luka or Klay might be on, which is probably the best scheme for all 3 of them. There&rsquo;s only one ball so you can&rsquo;t attack all three at once, and they should always have solid enough rim protection behind them with Gafford and Lively.</p>

      <label for="lrgl7ef" class="commentText"><p>that might well be the saving grace, but I have to point out that the Warriors were <em>actively seeking</em> Klay to take more of a complimentary role last season and had to ultimately bench him from the starting lineup because he was completely unable to figure out how to not hoist up every semi-open shot he could.</p>

<p>the problem last year was emphatically <strong>not</strong> that Klay was being asked to do too much from the Warriors to play consistent defense. they were <em>pleading</em> with him to change his game and figure out how to be most effective with his reduced athleticism and he was constantly unhappy and gave bad effort on both sides of the ball.</p>

<p>now, I think there were clear reasons that was harder for him to accept in a Warriors uniform that might be easier as a Maverick, but the problem last year wasn&rsquo;t Klay&rsquo;s role, it was Klay&rsquo;s attitude.</p>

<p>With the Draymond suspensions that went on last season and Wiggins ability totally tanking due to his personal life circumstances, I do believe Klay&rsquo;s down year last season has been unfairly characterized as just &ldquo; this is who he is now. &ldquo;</p>

      <label for="lrgwz4e" class="commentText"><p>Klay is going to be able to focus his energy on defense. Luka and Kyrie are exceptional iso players. There&rsquo;s much less running required for the role players in that offensive scheme, especially compared to the constant motion offense the Warriors have. I believe that will address almost all of what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>

<p>Still, he doesn&rsquo;t have to be a great defender to be worth it / a major improvement relative to Tim Hardaway Jr. To me the more interesting test will be if he can still hit 3s at a good clip when Luka feeds them open to him, when he&rsquo;s not as in-rhythm from the constant touches he&rsquo;s used to getting. He showed some issues with that last year when the Warriors sought to decrease his role. Had trouble finding a rhythm, or rather, not hoisting up all the passes he got.</p>

GSW’s offense involved a lot of screening/off ball read and react type actions. In Dallas, Luka can just do his magic and Klay would have to just run off a pin-down, flare, or hammer. Gives him more efficacy on defense too</p>

      <label for="lrhccwy" class="commentText"><p>the argument that the Dallas offense simply involves less running for a guy like Klay is a strong one. it would definitely help, but it also reduces the opportunities to use Klay&rsquo;s off-ball gravity to open other offensive option up.</p>

<p>so it&rsquo;ll be a bit of a trade-off. if you just want Klay to hit shots, probably a wise one, but it changes the lift he can give to the offense overall.</p>

      <label for="lrheb4e" class="commentText"><p>I personally think Klay’s off-ball gravity is actually better this way for DAL. Luka officially has his best spot up shooter, so that actually gives Luka more relative space to work with inside the paint or off a PnR. You know Luka will get him an open shot if someone cheats over.</p>

<p>It’s sad to say this but Klay’s only viable off-ball shooting asset is probably spot ups at this stage in career. If he was running off screens I would tell my team to run him off the line and shoot those juicy contested long 2’s lol.</p>

<p>just to make things easy, I&rsquo;m gonna do this from the ASG, not the trade deadline (Feb. 18th instead of Feb 8th, a difference of 4 total games for the Warriors, not sure how many for the Mavs), because nba.com makes that much simpler.</p>

<p>after the ASG, the Warriors had the 7th best defense in the NBA, the Mavericks had the 13th best.</p>

<p>obviously they were good in the playoffs, but the Gafford and Washington additions didn&rsquo;t really change their regular season performance that much.</p>

<p>I also think that doing the playoff thing of comparing postseason numbers to their equivalent regular season numbers thing is always misleading. pace and efficiency always drop by large amounts in the playoffs, so every offense looks worse and every defense looks better.</p>

During their championship years he had a stable core of Steph, Dray, Iggy, Looney, Livingston, and then vets and other plug and play guys like KD, West, Bogut, Barbosa. </p>

<p>The past couple seasons Kerr has been kinda throwing stuff at the wall trying to develop new talents, and that’s gotta make it tougher for guys like Klay who needs to be set up to score. Yeah it’s still on him to make shots, but it’s not like he’s the only thing that changed in those seasons he missed. </p>

      <label for="lrgmxjp" class="commentText"><p>To me it seems like he needs motivation to put in the effort required to at least be a neutral defender.</p>

<p>As you said in another comment, he turned it around when when a title was on the line.</p>

<p>I think when you&rsquo;ve won as much as the Warriors have it can seem meaningless to bust your ass for a stretch in January.</p>

<p>Also, physically he&rsquo;s declined so even more effort would be required to play the defense he would like to play.</p>

<p>I thinknin Dallas it&rsquo;ll be easier for him. He&rsquo;s not going to be relied upon to generate offense. He can spend a whole game standing in the corner of he wants.  Luka is more capable than Steph is at this point in his career of carrying an offense by himself. If he spends less effort on offense and knows he has two big men who can challenge shots at the rim if he gets beat, I think he can put in the effort required to be at minimum a neutral defender. And that&rsquo;s all Dallas needs him to be</p>

      <label for="lrh0tcx" class="commentText"><p>What makes this even more pronounced is what Klay’s role will likely be for large chunks of when he’s on the court: the primary POA defender.</p>

<p>The Mavs starting lineup is effectively devoid of point of attack defenders. Luka’s workload is too big offensively. Kyrie is similar/older/smaller. Washington is a PF. Gafford/Lively are Cs. So the onus falls on Klay. Asking a dude as old as Klay with his injury history and games played to be a primary point of attack defender night in and night out is begging him to be gassed by December.</p>

<p>Yes, he can muster some decent defensive possessions. Yes, the rim protection/help defense behind him can help alleviate some of the issues. Yes, guys like Marshall and Grimes can shoulder the responsibility when they come in. But those are largely half-measures.</p>

<p>Also, I’m not really sure how Dallas’s defense will look now that teams have more film/when they run up against teams that shoot well and shoot willingly. They feasted against teams with non-shooters in the lineup last postseason by funneling dudes to the rim protection and digging down off of non-shooters. That’s harder to do if their opponents can space (or if they go up against a dominant interior force like Jokic or AD who can occupy the rim protector).</p>

<p>yup this. our backline way better than gsw, and on other ends, we dont put Klay as #2 option. he&rsquo;s just a piece. sometimes he can be #3 on good day, in bad day maybe #5 or #6 (Lively/Gaff can combined 10 lobs in game minimun, ppl forgot PJ has bag in hornets)</p>

      <label for="lrho94x" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t even understand it lol. Like.. The sub was mostly clamoring for Klay to be sixth man, in large part because he isn&rsquo;t a good defender anymore. But now they&rsquo;re acting like he&rsquo;s going to suddenly be great again, and mad at our FO for letting him go. I dunno man, all the shit he&rsquo;s been talking only further makes me completely fine with him being gone. He would&rsquo;ve been great as a sixth man, helping anchor the scoring for the bench. But he refused that role, reportedly. So it is what it is.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s often how it goes for these older guys - some nights its there, some nights, not so much.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This. The minutes he was being played were insane. Lol I mean the guy led the whole damn team in minutes in the 2022 playoffs at 792 mins (Wiggins was 2nd at 767 mins) and he had only been back for 6 months.</p>

<p>Outside of those two catastrophic injuries, he’s always been an absolute tank and to his credit, has seemingly been able to return to near that (he played 77 games last year and the only reason he played just 69 games in the season prior was because they wouldn’t let him play B2Bs the first half of the season) but that doesn’t mean they should have pushed him to be that. Then again, with their player availability issues the last couple of seasons and he and Steph being their only two shooters last season, they may not have had much choice but still.</p>

<p>Fatigue was for sure a huge factor in the 22-23 playoffs, because with Steph’s injuries that took him out late Dec./early Jan. and then for a month in February, Klay had to carry to keep them in position to fight for a playoff spot when Steph got back. And he played some of the best ball offensively of his career (avg. 26.6 ppg on 47/46/89 splits in Feb. and 27 ppg on 46/43/91 splits in Jan.) in the process but he was averaging close to 35 mpg - way too many for post-injury Klay - for the two months leading up to the playoffs, as a result, and so by the time they were in the playoffs he had no legs left.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s that time for Klay right now. Two years and a bit since he first came back. So I won&rsquo;t be surprised to see him doing better than the previous two seasons even though realistically no one in their right mind would believe he could go back to his full fledged prime.</p>

<p>Hope he does well and wins it again this year.</p>

<p>His main flaw, similar to his offensive game, is ego. Klay cares a lot, that is one thing evident over the years. He wants to guard the best player, he wants to take tough shots. His success varies. One thing is clear, he cannot keep up with the quick athletic guards today.</p>

<p>Like he said here, being in a simplified role, he is trying to make up the work load defensively. That is not a bad thing, you just don&rsquo;t want him to be your main POA defender.</p>

<p>He never provided any help defense, any defensive rebounding, any passing lane steals, very little rotational switchability etc.</p>

      <label for="lrj9j78" class="commentText"><p>Klays defensive struggles weren&rsquo;t that exaggerated . When he locked in he was legitimately good on bigger guards and smaller wings. He just doesn&rsquo;t have the lateral quickness to guard quicker guards anymore which should&rsquo;ve been expected by everyone. The issue was he rarely locked in defensively last season. He&rsquo;s never going to be a lockdown defender again but he can be serviceable and not a complete turnstile</p>

He’s more so tagging along, filling in space, etc. It’s also preseason so I really wouldn’t count this for anything. Klay could get his shooting right this szn  but when he has to face a good guard/wing that defense is probably gonna be the same as it was last year</p>
