<p>The issue isn&rsquo;t what Klay does with fresh legs. The issue is what he does down the stretch of a playoff run. Klay wasn&rsquo;t somehow playing worse defense because the Warriors roster or scheme didn&rsquo;t allow him to play better defense, the Warriors dribble penetration defense was putrid last year and Klay was a huge part of that.</p>

<p>maybe the Mavericks rim protection makes some of this more allowable, but I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re getting a plus defender no matter what.</p>

      <label for="lrglzkc" class="commentText"><p>We aren’t asking him to be an elite defender anymore. People look at our starting lineup and think Luka, Kai and Klay are gonna share the court for 40 minutes a game. It’s just not the case. One of those 3 will be on the bench for the majority of the game and will be replaced with one of Naji,  Grimes and Exum when he’s back who are all above average to great defenders.</p>

<p>I think you’re seeing a natural pushback from Mavs fans after hearing all summer about how Klay is completely washed. He’s about to be 35, we know he’s lost a step. But we’re paying him 15M a year not 40m. I think he’s gonna be just fine in his role here.</p>

      <label for="lrgn3hb" class="commentText"><p>I think he might well be fine in his role there, it just depends on what people are expecting his role to be.</p>

<p>To clearly add context to my caveat in the first post, I am opening the chance that I will be surprised by the Klay that comes out this year, as a lot of his issues last stemmed from his unhappiness with his own decline and it led to a lot of bad play that was directly due to bad decision-making or lack of effort, not purely physical ability.</p>

<p>That said, Klay was a player the Warriors had to actively hide defensively most of last season. They played him as effectively a small stretch 4, didn&rsquo;t ask him to guard on the perimeter, and teams tried to target him (successfully, I might add) by bringing his man into actions and not letting him hide on the low block.</p>

<p>Maybe that changes, but the Warriors chose to <em>not</em> hide a 36-year old Steph from being the main guard defender because he was doing a better job than Klay was capable of, which led to Steph being absolutely gassed by season&rsquo;s end. If Klay was capable of doing more defensively, the Warriors would have <em>loved</em> to get that contribution.</p>

      <label for="lrgoatv" class="commentText"><p>I’ll give you that. Basically all of this interviews so far have mentioned being in a better headspace and hoping to start fresh in a new environment. I won’t pretend to know the intricacies of everything that went down with the Warriors last year but it’s often helpful to move on to a new place when moving into a new role.</p>

<p>But also for most Mavs fans, he’s replacing Tim Hardaway Jr who was a horrendous defender who was unplayable by the end of the year. And he’s making less money than him. Just being playable is an improvement to our roster so I feel he’s going to get a pretty big leash from the fanbase just based on that.</p>

      <label for="lrgpeup" class="commentText"><p>I think Klay in a good mindset can still be a super valuable player, which is why the Warriors were still wanting to retain him but also were trying to make sure he understood that him returning probably meant him coming off the bench a decent amount of the time, which had been such a thorny issue during the season.</p>

<p>I think the reason his defense gets pointed to is because if you want him to replace DJJ or be a guy who allows you to reduce the defensive responsibility of Luka or Kyrie, that probably isn&rsquo;t going to work out. If you need a sniper off the bench, he might be the best guy in the league in that role, assuming he fully accept everything that comes with it.</p>

      <label for="lrgqd8s" class="commentText"><p>He’s definitely starting, at least for the first few months. I can just see him capping out in the 25 minute range. And the way we keep one of Luka and Kai on the floor at all times means that we can run most of Klay’s minutes playing next to 2 plus defenders (PJ, Grimes, Exum, Naji) and consistent rim protection with 48 minutes of Lively and Gafford.</p>

<p>I actually wouldn’t be surprised if he doesn’t close games either, especially down the stretch. But yeah time will tell if his ego can handle that.</p>

<p>Surprised that this is somehow the conclusion you came to instead of Steph being tired from sharing the back court with an objectively worse defender in Podz. I saw Steph having to run and close out on so many corner shooters after Podz sagged to try and take a charge/grab a board or after Kuminga/Moody died on a screen.</p>

<p>To place the blame on Klay for Steph being gassed and not the absolutely anemic offensive options we&rsquo;ve surrounded Steph with is certainly a choice.</p>

      <label for="lrgkliu" class="commentText"><p>I think what Klay is projecting or hoping will be the case is that since he&rsquo;s the third option behind historically great scorers, he won&rsquo;t have to shoulder the sort of offensive burden the way he had to as the second option on the Warriors last season meaning he&rsquo;ll have more energy on the defensive end.</p>

      <label for="lrgl7ef" class="commentText"><p>that might well be the saving grace, but I have to point out that the Warriors were <em>actively seeking</em> Klay to take more of a complimentary role last season and had to ultimately bench him from the starting lineup because he was completely unable to figure out how to not hoist up every semi-open shot he could.</p>

<p>the problem last year was emphatically <strong>not</strong> that Klay was being asked to do too much from the Warriors to play consistent defense. they were <em>pleading</em> with him to change his game and figure out how to be most effective with his reduced athleticism and he was constantly unhappy and gave bad effort on both sides of the ball.</p>

<p>now, I think there were clear reasons that was harder for him to accept in a Warriors uniform that might be easier as a Maverick, but the problem last year wasn&rsquo;t Klay&rsquo;s role, it was Klay&rsquo;s attitude.</p>

<p>With the Draymond suspensions that went on last season and Wiggins ability totally tanking due to his personal life circumstances, I do believe Klay&rsquo;s down year last season has been unfairly characterized as just &ldquo; this is who he is now. &ldquo;</p>

      <label for="lrgmxjp" class="commentText"><p>To me it seems like he needs motivation to put in the effort required to at least be a neutral defender.</p>

<p>As you said in another comment, he turned it around when when a title was on the line.</p>

<p>I think when you&rsquo;ve won as much as the Warriors have it can seem meaningless to bust your ass for a stretch in January.</p>

<p>Also, physically he&rsquo;s declined so even more effort would be required to play the defense he would like to play.</p>

<p>I thinknin Dallas it&rsquo;ll be easier for him. He&rsquo;s not going to be relied upon to generate offense. He can spend a whole game standing in the corner of he wants.  Luka is more capable than Steph is at this point in his career of carrying an offense by himself. If he spends less effort on offense and knows he has two big men who can challenge shots at the rim if he gets beat, I think he can put in the effort required to be at minimum a neutral defender. And that&rsquo;s all Dallas needs him to be</p>

There’s also the part where sports med experts (see <a href="https://x.com/drniravpandya/status/1611938510239596544?s=46" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://x.com/drniravpandya/status/1608232157306322944?s=46" target="_blank">here</a>) say it takes 2-3 years to fully return to their new physical baseline (aka their physical best post-injuries), and by year 3 will have stabilized to what he’ll be going forward (this upcoming season will be year 3), after the injuries he sustained.</p>

<p>saying he’s still going to be good is fine, but arguing that he’s actually going to improve this year as a 34 year old with multiple major lower leg injuries and clear signs of declines over the last two seasons is ridiculous</p>

      <label for="lrglubw" class="commentText"><p>Klay had a bad year last season, but there are a lot of factors that contributed to that.</p>

<p>The truth about Klay, is he is a volatile player. He goes through slumps, he gets frustrated defensively, he used to smoke open layups. All that being said, he can still be a flamethrower, and he can still lock up on some possessions.</p>

<p>Every player loses consistency as they age. He is not in his prime, but he is still plenty capable and he will show that from time to time. The average is usually good, the key is just identifying when to limit him and when to utilize him.</p>

<p>The Mavs are a better fit at this stage, they can simplify his role, and they have some great players in their prime. He can show up when he needs to, and otherwise they are more or less the same team as last year without him.</p>

      <label for="lrgoryu" class="commentText"><p>Klay did a decent amount of work against JB in the Finals and Draymond did some as well. The real JB primary defender was GP2, whenever he got on the court.</p>

<p>Draymond was the primary Brunson defender in the WCF, but the reason for that was more about completely nullifying Brunson&rsquo;s PnR game than it was about Klay. The Warriors were able to defang the Brunson attack because they could just switch the PnR if Draymond starts as the defender, which forced all the offensive pressure onto Luka who had Wiggins face-guarding him all series.</p>

You’re saying quality of the opponent should color how we evaluate Klay defending here, but he’s defending Lauri in some of these, which is my point. Defending Lauri and bothering his shot is nothing to spit on.</p>

<p>His main flaw, similar to his offensive game, is ego. Klay cares a lot, that is one thing evident over the years. He wants to guard the best player, he wants to take tough shots. His success varies. One thing is clear, he cannot keep up with the quick athletic guards today.</p>

<p>Like he said here, being in a simplified role, he is trying to make up the work load defensively. That is not a bad thing, you just don&rsquo;t want him to be your main POA defender.</p>
