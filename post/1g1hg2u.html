      <label for="lrgilmm" class="commentText"><p>I think this is wishful thinking, but who knows maybe I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>

<p>The issue isn&rsquo;t what Klay does with fresh legs. The issue is what he does down the stretch of a playoff run. Klay wasn&rsquo;t somehow playing worse defense because the Warriors roster or scheme didn&rsquo;t allow him to play better defense, the Warriors dribble penetration defense was putrid last year and Klay was a huge part of that.</p>

<p>maybe the Mavericks rim protection makes some of this more allowable, but I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re getting a plus defender no matter what.</p>

      <label for="lrglzkc" class="commentText"><p>We aren’t asking him to be an elite defender anymore. People look at our starting lineup and think Luka, Kai and Klay are gonna share the court for 40 minutes a game. It’s just not the case. One of those 3 will be on the bench for the majority of the game and will be replaced with one of Naji,  Grimes and Exum when he’s back who are all above average to great defenders.</p>

<p>I think you’re seeing a natural pushback from Mavs fans after hearing all summer about how Klay is completely washed. He’s about to be 35, we know he’s lost a step. But we’re paying him 15M a year not 40m. I think he’s gonna be just fine in his role here.</p>

      <label for="lrgn3hb" class="commentText"><p>I think he might well be fine in his role there, it just depends on what people are expecting his role to be.</p>

<p>To clearly add context to my caveat in the first post, I am opening the chance that I will be surprised by the Klay that comes out this year, as a lot of his issues last stemmed from his unhappiness with his own decline and it led to a lot of bad play that was directly due to bad decision-making or lack of effort, not purely physical ability.</p>

<p>That said, Klay was a player the Warriors had to actively hide defensively most of last season. They played him as effectively a small stretch 4, didn&rsquo;t ask him to guard on the perimeter, and teams tried to target him (successfully, I might add) by bringing his man into actions and not letting him hide on the low block.</p>

<p>Maybe that changes, but the Warriors chose to <em>not</em> hide a 36-year old Steph from being the main guard defender because he was doing a better job than Klay was capable of, which led to Steph being absolutely gassed by season&rsquo;s end. If Klay was capable of doing more defensively, the Warriors would have <em>loved</em> to get that contribution.</p>

      <label for="lrgoatv" class="commentText"><p>I’ll give you that. Basically all of this interviews so far have mentioned being in a better headspace and hoping to start fresh in a new environment. I won’t pretend to know the intricacies of everything that went down with the Warriors last year but it’s often helpful to move on to a new place when moving into a new role.</p>

<p>But also for most Mavs fans, he’s replacing Tim Hardaway Jr who was a horrendous defender who was unplayable by the end of the year. And he’s making less money than him. Just being playable is an improvement to our roster so I feel he’s going to get a pretty big leash from the fanbase just based on that.</p>

      <label for="lrgpeup" class="commentText"><p>I think Klay in a good mindset can still be a super valuable player, which is why the Warriors were still wanting to retain him but also were trying to make sure he understood that him returning probably meant him coming off the bench a decent amount of the time, which had been such a thorny issue during the season.</p>

<p>I think the reason his defense gets pointed to is because if you want him to replace DJJ or be a guy who allows you to reduce the defensive responsibility of Luka or Kyrie, that probably isn&rsquo;t going to work out. If you need a sniper off the bench, he might be the best guy in the league in that role, assuming he fully accept everything that comes with it.</p>

      <label for="lrgqd8s" class="commentText"><p>He’s definitely starting, at least for the first few months. I can just see him capping out in the 25 minute range. And the way we keep one of Luka and Kai on the floor at all times means that we can run most of Klay’s minutes playing next to 2 plus defenders (PJ, Grimes, Exum, Naji) and consistent rim protection with 48 minutes of Lively and Gafford.</p>

<p>I actually wouldn’t be surprised if he doesn’t close games either, especially down the stretch. But yeah time will tell if his ego can handle that.</p>

<p>Surprised that this is somehow the conclusion you came to instead of Steph being tired from sharing the back court with an objectively worse defender in Podz. I saw Steph having to run and close out on so many corner shooters after Podz sagged to try and take a charge/grab a board or after Kuminga/Moody died on a screen.</p>

<p>To place the blame on Klay for Steph being gassed and not the absolutely anemic offensive options we&rsquo;ve surrounded Steph with is certainly a choice.</p>

<p>Steph was tired because it was a carry job all around, no doubt. But not scram switching him out of actions when he shared the court with Klay (which was the bulk of the end of the season) was a huge reason for it.</p>

      <label for="lrgwmbl" class="commentText"><p>Podz was a putrid defensive player, the fact that you think he&rsquo;s better calls into question the entirety of your knowledge about basketball. The man is too slow to defend quick players, too weak to defend stronger players, and his dinosaur arms aren&rsquo;t contesting anyone his size. He cheated off of his man so often that it would send our defense into a scramble all season and was a huge part of our terribe 3pt defense.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think Podz is world-beater defensively, this is far more about how much of a negative Klay was last season than anything else, but Podz did an absolutely fine time treading water as a defender last year.</p>

<p>This is shown by the fact that Podz in the starting lineup had an extremely good defensive rating.</p>

<p>to support your point,</p>

<ul>
<li>look how high Lively is positioned on the screen by Kessler, he&rsquo;s beyond the 3pt line ready to help Klay and switch onto the ballhandler</li>
<li>2nd possession, look as Klay switches frame 1 along the perimeter. #8 gets stuck momentarily but the quick scram switch afterwards seems to indicate the defensive plan is to switch any ballscreens where Klay might lose a step on his assignment</li>
<li>later on, look how high Gafford steps up (beyond the 3pt line, like Lively), ready to help Klay.</li>

      <label for="lrgl7ef" class="commentText"><p>that might well be the saving grace, but I have to point out that the Warriors were <em>actively seeking</em> Klay to take more of a complimentary role last season and had to ultimately bench him from the starting lineup because he was completely unable to figure out how to not hoist up every semi-open shot he could.</p>

<p>the problem last year was emphatically <strong>not</strong> that Klay was being asked to do too much from the Warriors to play consistent defense. they were <em>pleading</em> with him to change his game and figure out how to be most effective with his reduced athleticism and he was constantly unhappy and gave bad effort on both sides of the ball.</p>

<p>now, I think there were clear reasons that was harder for him to accept in a Warriors uniform that might be easier as a Maverick, but the problem last year wasn&rsquo;t Klay&rsquo;s role, it was Klay&rsquo;s attitude.</p>

      <label for="lrh1c7j" class="commentText"><p>there&rsquo;s some really simple math here.</p>

<p>if the opportunity cost for Klay hoisting a somewhat ill-advised shot early in the shot clock is that it guarantees that possession won&rsquo;t end in a Steph 3 attempt or a Draymond short-roll with guys cutting from the corner, that&rsquo;s a really high price to pay, just in terms of points per possession outcomes.</p>

<p>if the opportunity cost for Klay taking a bad shot is that we miss out on an open GP2 corner 3 or a CP3 midrange shot, the cost is much much lower.</p>

With the Warriors I would assume he and Steph were two of the highest usage players on the team? I&rsquo;d think that would go down with Kyrie and Luka  being pretty ball dominant offensively</p>

      <label for="lrgwz4e" class="commentText"><p>Klay is going to be able to focus his energy on defense. Luka and Kyrie are exceptional iso players. There&rsquo;s much less running required for the role players in that offensive scheme, especially compared to the constant motion offense the Warriors have. I believe that will address almost all of what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>

<p>Still, he doesn&rsquo;t have to be a great defender to be worth it / a major improvement relative to Tim Hardaway Jr. To me the more interesting test will be if he can still hit 3s at a good clip when Luka feeds them open to him, when he&rsquo;s not as in-rhythm from the constant touches he&rsquo;s used to getting. He showed some issues with that last year when the Warriors sought to decrease his role. Had trouble finding a rhythm, or rather, not hoisting up all the passes he got.</p>

<p>felt that with a lot of mavs players but jason kidd has just put together fantastic schemes that has turned our season for the better again and again.</p>

<p>I also don&rsquo;t see how you can say the scheme was not at fault considering y&rsquo;all lost Mike Brown and haven&rsquo;t been that good on that end.</p>

<p>just to make things easy, I&rsquo;m gonna do this from the ASG, not the trade deadline (Feb. 18th instead of Feb 8th, a difference of 4 total games for the Warriors, not sure how many for the Mavs), because nba.com makes that much simpler.</p>

<p>after the ASG, the Warriors had the 7th best defense in the NBA, the Mavericks had the 13th best.</p>

<p>obviously they were good in the playoffs, but the Gafford and Washington additions didn&rsquo;t really change their regular season performance that much.</p>

<p>I also think that doing the playoff thing of comparing postseason numbers to their equivalent regular season numbers thing is always misleading. pace and efficiency always drop by large amounts in the playoffs, so every offense looks worse and every defense looks better.</p>

<p>As you said in another comment, he turned it around when when a title was on the line.</p>

<p>I think when you&rsquo;ve won as much as the Warriors have it can seem meaningless to bust your ass for a stretch in January.</p>

<p>Also, physically he&rsquo;s declined so even more effort would be required to play the defense he would like to play.</p>

<p>I thinknin Dallas it&rsquo;ll be easier for him. He&rsquo;s not going to be relied upon to generate offense. He can spend a whole game standing in the corner of he wants.  Luka is more capable than Steph is at this point in his career of carrying an offense by himself. If he spends less effort on offense and knows he has two big men who can challenge shots at the rim if he gets beat, I think he can put in the effort required to be at minimum a neutral defender. And that&rsquo;s all Dallas needs him to be</p>

      <label for="lrh0tcx" class="commentText"><p>What makes this even more pronounced is what Klay’s role will likely be for large chunks of when he’s on the court: the primary POA defender.</p>

<p>The Mavs starting lineup is effectively devoid of point of attack defenders. Luka’s workload is too big offensively. Kyrie is similar/older/smaller. Washington is a PF. Gafford/Lively are Cs. So the onus falls on Klay. Asking a dude as old as Klay with his injury history and games played to be a primary point of attack defender night in and night out is begging him to be gassed by December.</p>

<p>Yes, he can muster some decent defensive possessions. Yes, the rim protection/help defense behind him can help alleviate some of the issues. Yes, guys like Marshall and Grimes can shoulder the responsibility when they come in. But those are largely half-measures.</p>

<p>Also, I’m not really sure how Dallas’s defense will look now that teams have more film/when they run up against teams that shoot well and shoot willingly. They feasted against teams with non-shooters in the lineup last postseason by funneling dudes to the rim protection and digging down off of non-shooters. That’s harder to do if their opponents can space (or if they go up against a dominant interior force like Jokic or AD who can occupy the rim protector).</p>

      <label for="lrglubw" class="commentText"><p>Klay had a bad year last season, but there are a lot of factors that contributed to that.</p>

<p>The truth about Klay, is he is a volatile player. He goes through slumps, he gets frustrated defensively, he used to smoke open layups. All that being said, he can still be a flamethrower, and he can still lock up on some possessions.</p>

<p>Every player loses consistency as they age. He is not in his prime, but he is still plenty capable and he will show that from time to time. The average is usually good, the key is just identifying when to limit him and when to utilize him.</p>

<p>The Mavs are a better fit at this stage, they can simplify his role, and they have some great players in their prime. He can show up when he needs to, and otherwise they are more or less the same team as last year without him.</p>

<p>Draymond was the primary Brunson defender in the WCF, but the reason for that was more about completely nullifying Brunson&rsquo;s PnR game than it was about Klay. The Warriors were able to defang the Brunson attack because they could just switch the PnR if Draymond starts as the defender, which forced all the offensive pressure onto Luka who had Wiggins face-guarding him all series.</p>

You’re saying quality of the opponent should color how we evaluate Klay defending here, but he’s defending Lauri in some of these, which is my point. Defending Lauri and bothering his shot is nothing to spit on.</p>

He then switches onto Lauri, cutting off his path which forces a 2nd pass - then immediately helps again, forcing a 3rd pass back to Lauri, where he then steps in front of him, forcing a late 3 at the buzzer</p>

<p>Correction: It was Kessler who was rolling to the basket, not Lauri. They&rsquo;re both tall white guys who wear #23 and #24, it&rsquo;s an easy mistake to make!</p>

<p>His main flaw, similar to his offensive game, is ego. Klay cares a lot, that is one thing evident over the years. He wants to guard the best player, he wants to take tough shots. His success varies. One thing is clear, he cannot keep up with the quick athletic guards today.</p>

<p>Like he said here, being in a simplified role, he is trying to make up the work load defensively. That is not a bad thing, you just don&rsquo;t want him to be your main POA defender.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This. The minutes he was being played were insane. Lol I mean the guy led the whole damn team in minutes in the 2022 playoffs at 792 mins (Wiggins was 2nd at 767 mins) and he had only been back for 6 months.</p>

<p>Outside of those two catastrophic injuries, he’s always been an absolute tank and to his credit, has seemingly been able to return to near that (he played 77 games last year and the only reason he played just 69 games in the season prior was because they wouldn’t let him play B2Bs the first half of the season) but that doesn’t mean they should have pushed him to be that. Then again, with their player availability issues the last couple of seasons and he and Steph being their only two shooters last season, they may not have had much choice but still.</p>

<p>Fatigue was for sure a huge factor in the 22-23 playoffs, because with Steph’s injuries that took him out late Dec./early Jan. and then for a month in February, Klay had to carry to keep them in position to fight for a playoff spot when Steph got back. And he played some of the best ball offensively of his career (avg. 26.6 ppg on 47/46/89 splits in Feb. and 27 ppg on 46/43/91 splits in Jan.) in the process but he was averaging close to 35 mpg - way too many for post-injury Klay - for the two months leading up to the playoffs, as a result, and so by the time they were in the playoffs he had no legs left.</p>
