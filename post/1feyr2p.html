      <p>Was watching some of his highlights and to be able to handle the rock at 6’7 with that athleticism was pretty amazing to watch. I’ve seen people say he’s a Jordan/Magic hybrid as far as play style goes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I wasn’t old enough to actually see him play in his heyday. All I have is YouTube. If he played today, where does he rank among point guards and just all players in general?</p>

      <label for="lmqqvm7" class="commentText"><p>Are we taking into account that Penny couldn&rsquo;t shoot in his prime?  That makes him significantly less impactful than he would be in today&rsquo;s era where your PG is expected to have some form of outside shooting ie his playmaking will be less impactful if teams aren&rsquo;t guarding him like he&rsquo;s a scoring threat from outside.  He&rsquo;d be a sort of reverse/bizarro LaMelo Ball where he&rsquo;s a good finisher but not a 3 point shooter (Whereas Lamelo is a highly underrated 3-point shooter but has struggled with his finishing though he did improve significantly in that area last season&hellip;even if it was over a limited number of games).</p>

<p>Edit:  From <sup>94</sup>&frasl;<sub>95</sub>-<sup>96</sup>&frasl;<sub>97</sub>, Penny shot 32.7 percent from 3 on 3.7 attempts/game.  You could argue about whether or not Hardaway would be a better shooter/practice his outside shot were he a prospect coming up today but if we&rsquo;re simply putting Prime Penny into the league right now, the lack of outside shot is a problem and would put him somewhere in the lower half of the league&rsquo;s starting PG.</p>

<p>Jordan was a dog water three point shooter who&rsquo;s only good years were the 3 years the league moved  the line in.</p>

<p>Jordan was under 30% from three for <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>15</sub> years in the NBA.</p>

<p>His career 3PT% is greatly juiced in 1994, 1995, and 1996 as a result. It immediately drops as soon as the league moved the 3PT line back to its original spot.</p>

<p>He shot 27% from 3 in 1991-1992.</p>

<p>He shot 31% from 3 in 1990-1991.</p>

<p>89-90, where he shot 37% was an anamoly.</p>

<p>He then retired and came back.</p>

<p>He shot 50%, 45% and 37% with the line moved in. And then shot 24% the year the line moved back out and reduced the number of 3s he took.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s without mentioning from 84-85 to 88-89 where he shot under 30%  and under 20% for four of those years on limited attempts.</p>

<p>He came back after the second retirement and shot 19% from 3 in 01-02 and 29% from 3 in 02-03.</p>

<p>Jordan didn&rsquo;t crack the 20% mark until year 5.</p>

<p>Jordan&rsquo;s 3PT% would be under 30% percent if it weren&rsquo;t for the years the league moved the line in, which are funnily the years he took the most attempts.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s ok to acknowledge he wasn&rsquo;t a good 3 point shooter. He had a few good years after being ass from 3 and then benefitted from the line moving in and then was immediately ass again once it moved back out.</p>

      <label for="lmr8hym" class="commentText"><p>I understand the data but a criticism I’ve got of your analysis is that you only apply context to his shortened line seasons, which I agree are not as impressive as they seem. Im trying to stress that I won’t judge Jordan’s shooting from 3 using seasons where he shot 1 of them a game or 1 every other game because those seasons are more vulnerable to erratic 3s dipping % significantly.
Most star players with the ball are subject to that of course, the difference is that if Jordan shot 80 threes on the season and 30 of them are from 30 feet with 1 second on the clock, he’s going to have a tougher time making up for that in only 50 more pace-appropriate attempts than somebody who has 150 more, or 250 more. I’d try and find his % on open catch and shoot or something like that in specific seasons but I don’t know they tracked any of that</p>

<p>For 9 of them He was under 30%.</p>

<p>For 6 of them he was over 30%. For half of those 6 seasons the line was moved in.</p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t shoot them because he wasn&rsquo;t good at them consistently. That&rsquo;s why his percentages drop even after good years. He was an inconsistent shooter.</p>

<p>And as I&rsquo;ve said to everyone else, it&rsquo;s complete and utter bullshit to change the way Jordan played in a hypothetical and then assume that he will only benefit positively in that hypothetical.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like asking: &ldquo;how fucked would humans be if ants were our size.&rdquo; The answer would be we would not be fucked at all because an Ant would collapse on its own body weight due to the square cubed law.</p>

<p>Jordan was always an inconsistent 3PT shooter. He didn&rsquo;t break above 20% until his fifth season in the league lmao. And that was on limited attempts.</p>

<p>Sorry, dawg. Jordan wasn&rsquo;t a good three point shooter. It&rsquo;s ok to say that. Jordan would shoot under 30% for his career if the league didn&rsquo;t shorten the 3 for 3 of his seasons.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a great example. Demar Derozen was a freak athlete with an elite mid range. He was an after thought after the era became about the 3 ball.</p>

<p>Jordan&rsquo;s work ethic and drive is what set him apart, teams just didn&rsquo;t shoot 3s in that era. It was much harder to get a good look when the players were actually allowed to play defense and if someone took a shot 3 steps past half court 9 seconds into the shot clock in 1995, their ass would have been benched. If the game was played how it is today, Jordan would have been one of the best 3pt shooters in the game during his time.</p>

<p>No, Jordan wouldn&rsquo;t have been one of the best 3 PT shooters of this generation, and we also don&rsquo;t know if the other aspects of Jordan&rsquo;s game would&rsquo;ve suffered had he focused on 3PT shooting.</p>

<p>What if Jordan focused on 3s, got lazy on defense, and was never same defensive dawg?</p>

<p>What if Jordan&rsquo;s focused on 3s and stopped driving because he was looking for step backs and his percentages plummeted?</p>

<p>What if Jordan&rsquo;s dog shit 3P% his first few years limited his minutes in this era?</p>

<p>do you see how fucking stupid is to change one element and assume that it&rsquo;s not only not going to impact the others but only make someone better? It&rsquo;s dumb.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a logical fallacy. &ldquo;Hey this guy will just magically spend his time on 3s instead of other stuff and nothing else will suffer!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>No he was ass at shooting 3s lmfao</p>

      <label for="lmr3jjl" class="commentText"><p>I don’t know how you’re somehow both right and wrong in this thread, it’s impressive.</p>

<p>Penny and MJ both played in an era where the 3 was immensely undervalued. These convos are always dumb because people always look at them in a vacuum.</p>

<p>Those two would be fundamentally different players if they played now, you don’t just transplant them from one era to another with nothing changing. They would have to put much more focus on their 3 point shooting, it would be a necessity at their position, and so gym reps would massively increase there. They can only put so much focus on any one thing in practice; with a 3 point explosion, guess where some of that focus now goes? It’s not rocket science.</p>

<p>The only player who would need to have the league adjust to him is Shaq. Even MJ would have to adjust, and he would, no different than, you know, how LeBron James did. Or how about Blake Griffin?</p>

      <label for="lmr51y3" class="commentText"><p>No. I&rsquo;m just right.</p>

<p>Percentages are percentages. The distance is the  distance. I don&rsquo;t do imaginary hypotheticals in GOAT debates because you don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>What if Jordan shooting more 3s turned him into a shot chucker and he decided to not be as active on defense?</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t change one major element and act like nothing else would change. That&rsquo;s bullshit. We can&rsquo;t do that.</p>

<p>What if Jordan focusing more 3s lead him to favor shooting instead of driving and he won less?</p>

<p>FYI, LeBron hit 35% from 3 on more attempts than Jordan ever did in his second year. In 04-05, before space, pace and the 7SOL suns. Only two years after Jordan retired.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not due to space, pace or era. LeBron has always been a better 3 Pt shooter than him lmao.</p>

      <label for="lmqxyyw" class="commentText"><p>I disagree. SGA isn&rsquo;t considered a very good 3-pointer but he&rsquo;s in MVP talks. His career 3p is at 0.349 at 3.4 attempts.</p>

<p>Penny is taller and more athletic. And would say just about as crafty as SGA. They do have very different playstyles and roles so it&rsquo;s hard to say how impactful Penny will be in today&rsquo;s NBA.</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t really think of anyone that fits Penny&rsquo;s playstyle now. Maybe closest was prime Westbrook but with better BBIQ? Or maybe a taller De&rsquo;aaron Fox maybe? A better Dejounte Murray?</p>

<p>Penny would be a better passer and defender than a guy like shai probably one of the best in league at the guard spot but even accounting for era he is a solid tier below him scoring wise.</p>

<p>What about these shitty defenders at point guard everywhere in the league today when Penny posts them up?</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re allowed to make excuses for what you perceive to be Lamelo&rsquo;s shooting deficiencies, since you&rsquo;ve seen him play, but with Penny he just sucks at shooting because you&rsquo;re only looking at one stat in an era where shooting a three was frowned upon and considered a lazy possession?</p>

      <label for="lmr4vnm" class="commentText"><p>How are they going to guard Penny?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve seen him play so I will help guide you. It&rsquo;s too easy to show you his highlights from the Shaq years so I will take you to 1997. Shaq left the team in the 96 offseason so this is Orlando&rsquo;s first year without him, and it&rsquo;s a rough one. The team is convinced they can still contend so barely getting to the playoffs as a 7 seed is considered a big disappointment. Penny allegedly gets his coach fired midseason, which becomes a huge story around the league. Bad vibes. Orlando loses the first two games in their series against the 2 seed Miami, who has dominated them. Game 3 begins and Orlando loses their whole front court to injury. They&rsquo;re now relying on a 38 year old career backup Danny Schayes to defend hall of farmers in his prime Alonzo Mourning. Orlando quickly goes down by 20 early in game 3. Orlando has no choice but to tell Penny to look to score on every possession, and it fucking works. Games 3 and 4 are the two most underrated playoff performances I&rsquo;ve ever seen. The stats are great, but what I want you to focus on is the difficulty of each shot attempt. He lights everyone up, and he does it with Miami knowing that Penny is Orlando&rsquo;s only chance so they&rsquo;re throwing everything at him. I&rsquo;ll also note that Miami is one of the best defenses in the league, especially their front line, where Orlando has no one left.</p>

<p>Game 3 (with the context of the game to begin the video) <a href="https://youtu.be/JGgrF8uCIFQ?si=wHJXAWQ6_3MT_UvX" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/JGgrF8uCIFQ?si=wHJXAWQ6_3MT_UvX</a></p>

<p>Game 4 <a href="https://youtu.be/M1vefSacsik?si=aPekxD5CnoXEsP8f" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/M1vefSacsik?si=aPekxD5CnoXEsP8f</a></p>

<p>Orlando went on to lose a close game 5 in Miami, and this the round, as first round playoff series were best of 5 back then, which is why games 3 and 4 were so important. This would&rsquo;ve been the greatest upset in the first round in my eyes, considering the seed <em>and</em> injury disparity. Penny made it that close, by himself</p>
