</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>There are some super underrated legends of the game from back in the day. Nique, Jermaine O&rsquo;Neal, Dennis Johnson, Bernard King, just to name a few.</p>

<p>Who, out of the players active today that are considered superstars (or were at one point), do you think will be mostly forgotten about and underrated for future generations?</p>

<p>I used to have this discussion with my roommate and he always said James Harden, which I thought was a good pick but I figured he&rsquo;d have a chip by now and I always thought &ldquo;The Beard&rdquo; was a memorable.. gimmick? Idk. My pick was always Paul George, but now I think he was spot on with James Harden.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he was ever considered a superstar but it seems Joe Johnson has already been quickly forgotten about. Same with Deron Williams, although I wouldn&rsquo;t count them since they aren&rsquo;t active anymore.</p>

<p>Who&rsquo;s your pick?</p>

<p>Edit: OK, maybe not <em>superstar</em> level. But at least very high level. All-NBA level at the very least.</p>

<p>He spent most of his career on a mediocre Blazers team that never really went all in on Lillard and pretty much wasted his prime</p>

<p>Which is a shame because he had some MVP calibre seasons, but the team was pretty mediocre so he wasn’t really ever in that conversation</p>

      <label for="li0t9cm" class="commentText"><p>I forgot most of those shots until you brought it up tbh, and the KD call was definitely more memorable than Hardens shot imo (btw that happened in the regular season)</p>

<p>Either way, no star player will ever be truly forgotten since someone will always bring them up in some shape or form. But if we’re talking about most people (like OP mentioned) then I still think Lillard takes the cake</p>

<p>His best seasons happened when the teams window to compete was pretty much done, and Lillard career was pretty much sandwiched between other all time (more successful) greats with Curry, Westbrook, Harden and even CP3</p>

<p>Portland fans will remember him, some people will bring him up when they talk about cool shots, but most people will probably be like ‘oh yeah, that guy…’ if someone brought his name in the future</p>

<p>I agree Harden has too memorable of an appearance to not be remembered. Sometimes that&rsquo;s enough. People remember short guys like Muggsy Bogues and tall guys like Manute Bol so unique looking players like Beard will probably make new viewers wonder what he was all about.</p>

<p>I would guess Jalen Brunson or Jaylen Brown not because they&rsquo;re not good players but they&rsquo;ll blend in with the sea of Jalen/Jaylen/Jaden variations that are getting drafted every year for the past few seasons.</p>

      <label for="li25b4t" class="commentText"><p>Considering the last players to make the Knicks relevant were Melo and Stoudemire, and Stoudemire has been almost completely forgotten and Melo has even been somewhat forgotten to a surprising level, I don&rsquo;t really agree with this sentiment. I don&rsquo;t think one All-NBA season and making the conference semis a couple times is enough. If he makes the Finals with the Knicks, then yeah, I&rsquo;ll agree with you, but otherwise he&rsquo;ll likely need to be an All-NBA player the rest of his career, which could happen, but also might not.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d you mean that he&rsquo;ll be remembered by Knicks fans, then of course, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean much. I remember guys like Aaron Baynes, Eddie House, and Jared Sullinger. Because I&rsquo;m a Celtics fan. The rest of the fans around the league doesn&rsquo;t remember those guys. Now, sure, plenty of other more casual Celtics fans may forget those guys, but any Celtics fan who watched even a few games in the IT era will remember him, but he&rsquo;s already pretty much forgotten by the rest of the league.</p>

If the Celtics for some reason never make it back to the Finals, then I could see you being right. Similarly foe Brunson, I think it depends on if he does anything meaningful on the Knicks. I think making the Finals and being relevant year in and year out would be enough. Winning the Finals would cement him in memory for sure.</p>

<p>Prime Harden was an elite scorer and probably the best shot creator of his time, but the man lived and died with FTs. Aside from step back 3s, his game for the average viewer was not enjoyable to watch. It was foul after foul… not to mention all the foul baiting he did as a jump shooter.</p>

<p>He ain’t gonna be remembered much by the future generations</p>

<p>All I’m saying is… when I was a kid… Dwight was like Shaq level of dominance. Deron Williams was an elite PG. Brandon Roy was basically like what TMac was. Also Chris Bosh was another one. Dude was his own superstar on the Raptors. Amare Stoudamire too. Dude was a beast. Now, many youngin’s don’t really know those names</p>

<p>Dwight is a meme for the gay rumors and him failing in LA. Deron Williams and Brandon Roy aren’t remembered at all (seriously.. sometimes I’m like “does anyone remember them?”). Amare is another forgotten player for his failure stint in NY. In Phoenix he was a beast with Nash tho. Bosh is mostly known by many as the “3rd guy” for the Heat but dude was solid tbh</p>

<p>Just shows that even tho now it seems “this guy is good”… with time, things change. For example… Bow Wow was like Chris Brown level of popular when I was a kid. Girls all loved him. I remember that. Now.. people clown him.</p>

<p>The same is true for era-specific criticisms.

      <label for="li22ag7" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m completely with you. I think it&rsquo;s especially true for people who don&rsquo;t win anything. Like I could see Haliburton, Maxey, Booker, Brunson, SGA, and Ant all being those kind of guys. It all depends on if they win, or are at least on relevant teams consistently, how long they play at a high level for, etc. Injuries can really derail things and big ones happen all the time. Rose, Hayward, IT, etc. Not to mention that some of the big names now haven&rsquo;t necessarily been doing it for long. There are plenty of guys who have a couple great seasons and that&rsquo;s it. There are a lot of factors we can&rsquo;t know right now.</p>

<p>Winning may be one of the biggest ones, though. Steph would have been remembered no matter what. Is that also true for Klay and Draymond? Maybe, but I&rsquo;m not so sure. Draymond likely would be at least remembered somewhat as a dirty player, and Klay was a great shooter, but idk if it&rsquo;d be enough. Jaylen Brown and possibly even Tatum could have been in that category, too. Probably not Tatum, but if they never won, and depending on if this season was the peak of Brown&rsquo;s career (he could maintain or still be on the rise, or decline, who knows?), he would probably be forgotten. Like Bosh is one of those that people actually do remember, I&rsquo;d say, but as the 3rd Heatle. If they never won or he never teamed up with Lebron and Wade, he&rsquo;d be completely forgotten for sure. How much of Nowitzki&rsquo;s remembrance in the long term is dependent on that 2011 run? Idk, but it sure as heck helps him be remembered by more people, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>

<p>Now Booker, Maxey and JB are good shouts. Nothing exceptional or particularly unique about their games and none are are the best players on their respective teams. Tatum could honestly be one of these guys too, depending on if the Celtics become a dynasty or not.</p>

      <label for="li0w5dv" class="commentText"><p>Nique was Nique but I just wanted to put in a good word for Dennis Johnson. Dude was filthy pre-Boston (and with Boston, just in a much different way). He even won himself a well deserved Finals MVP in Seattle back when he was jumping out of the building night in and night out. He probably <em>should</em> have ascended to superstardom but succumbed to the disease of more.</p>

<p>Regardless, I often think he’s the perfect candidate for “star whose prime is forgotten”. He’s remembered as a fourth or fifth piece to those ‘80s Celtics but he was the man in Seattle.</p>

<p>Shout out to Gus Williams too. Maybe the only guy since the post-ABA merger to average almost 30 a night in a finals series and still be forgotten.</p>

      <label for="li0pzgu" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ll never stop thinking &ldquo;what if&rdquo; when it comes to the Malice at the Palace. I think at their peak, Jermaine was better. But overall throughout their career Reggie was better. I don&rsquo;t think he cracks the Pacers top 3 best players when it comes to absolute peak, but I still consider him the greatest Pacer ever due to his loyalty, his leadership, his clutchness (is that even a word?) and just overall impact on the organization.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s also my favorite player of all time and one of the biggest reasons why the Pacers became my favorite team. Even tho I didn&rsquo;t even really get into basketball until years after his retirement.</p>

<p>My lucky number/jersey number is also 31 cause that&rsquo;s my birthday (October 21st. 21+10=31) so he immediately caught my eye because of that since that&rsquo;s not a number a lot of great players have used.</p>

Being from a tiny town in a tiny country, I always love rooting for the underdog, and I just fell in love with the Pacers during that time. PG, Granger, Hibbert, Lance.. loved all those guys. Even have a Pacers tattoo now lmao. I really love the Pacers!</p>

      <label for="li242bz" class="commentText"><p>I like the teams angle. Being on the right team adds a lot.</p>

<p>I was really young in the eighties but anchoring them in iconic teams made it really easy to get to 10 without looking it up:</p>

<p>Julius Irving
Moses Malone
Maurice Cheeks
Isiah Thomas
Joe Dumars
Bill Laimbeer
Rick Mahorn
Adrian Dantley
Michael Jordan
Craig Hodges</p>

<p>Sixers, Pistons, Bulls. I could probably get 3 more players of each time but it was easier to switch to another.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s probably why guys like Dominique Wilkins fade out of conversations. If your team never becomes iconic, your individual accolades need to be special. Scoring titles and slam dunk contests aren&rsquo;t enough.</p>

<p>Heck, I think that Lakers/Celtics in-between teams are likely to not cut it either.</p>

      <label for="li1yuin" class="commentText"><p>To be remembered and appreciated long term a player needs to have an iconic thing to give people an anchor.</p>

<p>Most people don&rsquo;t even know Gail Goodrich&rsquo;s name, despite his brilliance, because we don&rsquo;t have an anchoring moment or stat for him. Oscar has the triple double, but you barely see him in top 10 lists any more because Westbrook partially removed that anchor. Dominique is remembered because of his dunks. Bernard King doesn&rsquo;t have that same level of anchor, so he isn&rsquo;t remembered the same way.</p>

<p>MVPs and titles act as anchors, but they aren&rsquo;t nessecarily that strong unless there are a couple of them. A nickname like &lsquo;The Glove&rsquo;, or a move like the finger wag can be far more effective at helping us remember.</p>

<p>So if I look around the league, here are some guys without anchors, or with really weak ones:</p>

<p>Trey Young
Paul George
Anthony Davis
DeMar DeRozan
Donovan Mitchell</p>

<p>And two guys who I think will get lost in history eventually:
Giannis and Embiid. I think they both have pretty weak anchors, and it would take something really special to elevate them enough that they don&rsquo;t become severely under appreciated a decade after retirement.</p>

<p>not hated nor polarizing enough. gets overshadowed  by Curry on things his great at. no memorable rivalry. played in a not that remarkable franchise for a decade+. even his supposed trademark, loyalty, no longer holds true. no ring, no mvp.</p>

      <label for="li1yvli" class="commentText"><p>I define ‘forgotten’ as someone who doesn’t immediately come to mind as a superstar to a fan of basketball at the time, when asked decades later.</p>

<p>I was a huge fan in the 90s.</p>

<ul>
<li>Who immediately comes to mind as a superstar are: Jordan, Pippen, Rodman, Barkley, Hakeem, Malone and Stockton. That’s it. </li>
<li>When I think more deeply, I’ll add: Payton, Kemp, Penny, Clyde, Ewing, David Robinson, Reggie Miller. That’s it (Kobe, Shaq, Kidd I have as 00s).</li>
<li>If I go team by team I can scour for more big names: Kevin Johnson, Grant Hill, Dominique, Mark Price, Mookie Blaylock, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, roughly half the true superstars are remembered in my experience. Running the 2010s, my guess is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Immediately come to mind: Lebron, KD, Steph, Klay, Draymond, Harden.</li>
<li>When I think more deeply, I’ll add: Kyrie, Russ, Kawhi, AD, Dame, CP.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s a high bar. So some forgottens: Carmelo, PG, maybe Kawhi tbh, Kevin Love, Jimmy Butler, Marc Gasol (?). </p>

<p>Philly is his last shot at a deep run to get people to remember him, but judging off his and Embiid’s post season success, I don’t it happens.</p>

<p>Unless the Bucks have a resurgent season and postseason under Doc Rivers, Lillard is pretty unlikely to experience another deep playoff run aside from the 2019 WCF.</p>

<p>10 years from now, newer NBA fans will probably think “what was the big deal about this dude?”</p>

<p>More or less guys that never won MVPs or championships.</p>

<p>Of course this can change if they win it, but Guys like Giannis, Jokic, Embid, AD and Luka have more or less solidified their status in this era.</p>

<p>CP3 career has already ended, and he carved out a good career despite not winning any accolades.</p>

<p>The other players on your list haven’t finished their career yet, it is still possible for them to have a good career. If the Knicks win this year, Brunson will be the one that will be remembered as the guy who took massive discount to have the roster built.</p>
