</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>There are some super underrated legends of the game from back in the day. Nique, Jermaine O&rsquo;Neal, Dennis Johnson, Bernard King, just to name a few.</p>

<p>Who, out of the players active today that are considered superstars (or were at one point), do you think will be mostly forgotten about and underrated for future generations?</p>

<p>I used to have this discussion with my roommate and he always said James Harden, which I thought was a good pick but I figured he&rsquo;d have a chip by now and I always thought &ldquo;The Beard&rdquo; was a memorable.. gimmick? Idk. My pick was always Paul George, but now I think he was spot on with James Harden.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he was ever considered a superstar but it seems Joe Johnson has already been quickly forgotten about. Same with Deron Williams, although I wouldn&rsquo;t count them since they aren&rsquo;t active anymore.</p>

<p>Who&rsquo;s your pick?</p>

<p>Edit: OK, maybe not <em>superstar</em> level. But at least very high level. All-NBA level at the very least.</p>

      <label for="li0tnkv" class="commentText"><p>For all the comments saying “no way anyone will forget about __”</p>

<p>All I’m saying is… when I was a kid… Dwight was like Shaq level of dominance. Deron Williams was an elite PG. Brandon Roy was basically like what TMac was. Also Chris Bosh was another one. Dude was his own superstar on the Raptors. Amare Stoudamire too. Dude was a beast. Now, many youngin’s don’t really know those names</p>

<p>Dwight is a meme for the gay rumors and him failing in LA. Deron Williams and Brandon Roy aren’t remembered at all (seriously.. sometimes I’m like “does anyone remember them?”). Amare is another forgotten player for his failure stint in NY. In Phoenix he was a beast with Nash tho. Bosh is mostly known by many as the “3rd guy” for the Heat but dude was solid tbh</p>

<p>Just shows that even tho now it seems “this guy is good”… with time, things change. For example… Bow Wow was like Chris Brown level of popular when I was a kid. Girls all loved him. I remember that. Now.. people clown him.</p>

<p>The same is true for era-specific criticisms. Those same folks who dismiss all previous generations because they’re not as advanced and elite as their current generation are going to be in for a rude awakening with the 2035 generation comes along and spams James Harden flopping compilations as a means of dismissing the accomplishments of an entire era.</p>

      <label for="li4mh1z" class="commentText"><p>With harden it will probably be the opposite. After he’s retired the absurd bias against him will start to die down, and any objective fact or metric will show him as a top 20 player ever, which he is.</p>

<p>You can look, outside of the two rings harden obviously could’ve gotten if he joined a 73 win team just between 2015-2020 he has just as many, if not more, accolades and accomplishments as kd does in his entire career.</p>

<p>When he’s retired the media will have less and less reason to tell you all what bs to parrot about him so people will look at his career more objectively. Currently he’s probably the most under rated player ever career wise.</p>

      <label for="li4n2cm" class="commentText"><p>Just like today, I think it&rsquo;s all going to depend upon who you&rsquo;re talking to.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re chatting with the type of person who only believes in espousing the greatness of current players while tearing down the past, then Harden flop mixtapes, Drummond Hack-a-Shaq lowlights, and clips of dudes diving and flopping into free throw opportunities will be on the menu, just like the folks today who cherry pick low lights from the &lsquo;90s to minimize the exploits of Michael Jordan.</p>

<p>With more reasoned fans, there&rsquo;ll be plenty to celebrate surrounding Harden&rsquo;s greatness.</p>

      <label for="li22ag7" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m completely with you. I think it&rsquo;s especially true for people who don&rsquo;t win anything. Like I could see Haliburton, Maxey, Booker, Brunson, SGA, and Ant all being those kind of guys. It all depends on if they win, or are at least on relevant teams consistently, how long they play at a high level for, etc. Injuries can really derail things and big ones happen all the time. Rose, Hayward, IT, etc. Not to mention that some of the big names now haven&rsquo;t necessarily been doing it for long. There are plenty of guys who have a couple great seasons and that&rsquo;s it. There are a lot of factors we can&rsquo;t know right now.</p>

<p>Winning may be one of the biggest ones, though. Steph would have been remembered no matter what. Is that also true for Klay and Draymond? Maybe, but I&rsquo;m not so sure. Draymond likely would be at least remembered somewhat as a dirty player, and Klay was a great shooter, but idk if it&rsquo;d be enough. Jaylen Brown and possibly even Tatum could have been in that category, too. Probably not Tatum, but if they never won, and depending on if this season was the peak of Brown&rsquo;s career (he could maintain or still be on the rise, or decline, who knows?), he would probably be forgotten. Like Bosh is one of those that people actually do remember, I&rsquo;d say, but as the 3rd Heatle. If they never won or he never teamed up with Lebron and Wade, he&rsquo;d be completely forgotten for sure. How much of Nowitzki&rsquo;s remembrance in the long term is dependent on that 2011 run? Idk, but it sure as heck helps him be remembered by more people, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>

      <label for="li33kbo" class="commentText"><p>Peyton manning isn’t a great example, since many people consider him a top 3-5 QB of all time. He’s kind of like MJ where his entire career is looked at most of the time instead of a bad year or two after they’re over the hill. I think a better example is someone like nnamdi asomugha or Darelle revis in the nfl. From underrated to all league level good to washed in a handful of years and now nobody remembers just how good they were because they weren’t on noteworthy teams.</p>

<p>I agree Harden has too memorable of an appearance to not be remembered. Sometimes that&rsquo;s enough. People remember short guys like Muggsy Bogues and tall guys like Manute Bol so unique looking players like Beard will probably make new viewers wonder what he was all about.</p>

<p>I would guess Jalen Brunson or Jaylen Brown not because they&rsquo;re not good players but they&rsquo;ll blend in with the sea of Jalen/Jaylen/Jaden variations that are getting drafted every year for the past few seasons.</p>

      <label for="li25b4t" class="commentText"><p>Considering the last players to make the Knicks relevant were Melo and Stoudemire, and Stoudemire has been almost completely forgotten and Melo has even been somewhat forgotten to a surprising level, I don&rsquo;t really agree with this sentiment. I don&rsquo;t think one All-NBA season and making the conference semis a couple times is enough. If he makes the Finals with the Knicks, then yeah, I&rsquo;ll agree with you, but otherwise he&rsquo;ll likely need to be an All-NBA player the rest of his career, which could happen, but also might not.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d you mean that he&rsquo;ll be remembered by Knicks fans, then of course, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean much. I remember guys like Aaron Baynes, Eddie House, and Jared Sullinger. Because I&rsquo;m a Celtics fan. The rest of the fans around the league doesn&rsquo;t remember those guys. Now, sure, plenty of other more casual Celtics fans may forget those guys, but any Celtics fan who watched even a few games in the IT era will remember him, but he&rsquo;s already pretty much forgotten by the rest of the league.</p>

      <label for="li23n3l" class="commentText"><p>If the Celtics win more championships with Tatum and Brown, then Brown will definitely be remembered. Even having won this one will help him a lot. If the Celtics for some reason never make it back to the Finals, then I could see you being right. Similarly foe Brunson, I think it depends on if he does anything meaningful on the Knicks. I think making the Finals and being relevant year in and year out would be enough. Winning the Finals would cement him in memory for sure.</p>

<p>Prime Harden was an elite scorer and probably the best shot creator of his time, but the man lived and died with FTs. Aside from step back 3s, his game for the average viewer was not enjoyable to watch. It was foul after foul… not to mention all the foul baiting he did as a jump shooter.</p>

<p>He spent most of his career on a mediocre Blazers team that never really went all in on Lillard and pretty much wasted his prime</p>

<p>Which is a shame because he had some MVP calibre seasons, but the team was pretty mediocre so he wasn’t really ever in that conversation</p>

Bron’s shot vs Orlando, D Rose vs Cavs, Harden vs GSW when KD was out of bounds for 7 steps before he saved the ball etc. Some moments are just going to be remembered forever.</p>

      <label for="li0t9cm" class="commentText"><p>I forgot most of those shots until you brought it up tbh, and the KD call was definitely more memorable than Hardens shot imo. You also kind of went against your point since that Rockets vs Warriors game was in the regular season, and not in the playoffs</p>

<p>Either way, no star player will ever be truly forgotten since someone will always bring them up in some shape or form. But if we’re talking about most people (like OP mentioned) then I still think Lillard takes the cake</p>

<p>His best seasons happened when the teams window to compete was pretty much done, and Lillard career was pretty much sandwiched between other all time (more successful) greats with Curry, Westbrook, Harden and even CP3</p>

<p>Portland fans will remember him, some people will bring him up when they talk about cool shots, but most people will probably be like ‘oh yeah, that guy…’ if someone brought his name in the future</p>

U have Dennis Johnson and Jermaine O&rsquo;Neal on Wilkins level that&rsquo;s objectively not the same tier player. These guys are very good but superstar? No way. To answer the question I would probably say Carmelo Anthony tbh. To me he had superstardom from 08-13</p>

      <label for="li0w5dv" class="commentText"><p>Nique was Nique but I just wanted to put in a good word for Dennis Johnson. Dude was filthy pre-Boston (and with Boston, just in a much different way). He even won himself a well deserved Finals MVP in Seattle back when he was jumping out of the building night in and night out. He probably <em>should</em> have ascended to superstardom but succumbed to the disease of more.</p>

<p>Regardless, I often think he’s the perfect candidate for “star whose prime is forgotten”. He’s remembered as a fourth or fifth piece to those ‘80s Celtics but he was the man in Seattle.</p>

<p>Shout out to Gus Williams too. Maybe the only guy since the post-ABA merger to average almost 30 a night in a finals series and still be forgotten.</p>

I can see Dennis Johnson being a controversial pick, but O&rsquo;Neal was an MVP contender in his prime. Maybe I&rsquo;m biased as a Pacers fan, but I&rsquo;d say that he was a superstar level player in his prime. At least by my standards.</p>

<p>Melo is a great pick. It&rsquo;s a shame that he never achieved more than he did. He was one of the guys that really got me into basketball to begin with.</p>

I&rsquo;m not a pacers fan so I&rsquo;m only speaking from the outside. I thought Reggie was Indiana. We go as far as Reggie takes us. I will say Jermaine was better in 04 which to me I thought Indiana was gonna win but unfortunately the malice in the palace happened. Melo was a me player so u can only build so much around a player like that</p>

      <label for="li0pzgu" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ll never stop thinking &ldquo;what if&rdquo; when it comes to the Malice at the Palace. I think at their peak, Jermaine was better. But overall throughout their career Reggie was better. I don&rsquo;t think he cracks the Pacers top 3 best players when it comes to absolute peak, but I still consider him the greatest Pacer ever due to his loyalty, his leadership, his clutchness (is that even a word?) and just overall impact on the organization.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s also my favorite player of all time and one of the biggest reasons why the Pacers became my favorite team. Even tho I didn&rsquo;t even really get into basketball until years after his retirement.</p>

<p>My lucky number/jersey number is also 31 cause that&rsquo;s my birthday (October 21st. 21+10=31) so he immediately caught my eye because of that since that&rsquo;s not a number a lot of great players have used.</p>

      <label for="li242bz" class="commentText"><p>I like the teams angle. Being on the right team adds a lot.</p>

<p>I was really young in the eighties but anchoring them in iconic teams made it really easy to get to 10 without looking it up:</p>

<p>Julius Irving
Moses Malone
Maurice Cheeks
Isiah Thomas
Joe Dumars
Bill Laimbeer
Rick Mahorn
Adrian Dantley
Michael Jordan
Craig Hodges</p>

<p>Sixers, Pistons, Bulls. I could probably get 3 more players of each time but it was easier to switch to another.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s probably why guys like Dominique Wilkins fade out of conversations. If your team never becomes iconic, your individual accolades need to be special. Scoring titles and slam dunk contests aren&rsquo;t enough.</p>

<p>Heck, I think that Lakers/Celtics in-between teams are likely to not cut it either.</p>

I was very young in the 80s but technically around, its very hard for me to remember many things that weren&rsquo;t somehow Celtic or Laker connected.</p>

<p>Even that great 76er team, the first thing I think of is those great 7 game series vs Boston in the early 80s.</p>

<p>So yeah, if you&rsquo;re career didn&rsquo;t have many memorable moments involving the Celtics or Lakers you are probably pretty damned forgotten.</p>

<p>I agree with everything else you said though. I know a lot of NBA from the 80&rsquo;s but I could barely name any of the 76ers champs and can only name a bunch of the Bad Boys. Not too much from other teams.</p>

      <label for="li1yuin" class="commentText"><p>To be remembered and appreciated long term a player needs to have an iconic thing to give people an anchor.</p>

<p>Most people don&rsquo;t even know Gail Goodrich&rsquo;s name, despite his brilliance, because we don&rsquo;t have an anchoring moment or stat for him. Oscar has the triple double, but you barely see him in top 10 lists any more because Westbrook partially removed that anchor. Dominique is remembered because of his dunks. Bernard King doesn&rsquo;t have that same level of anchor, so he isn&rsquo;t remembered the same way.</p>

<p>MVPs and titles act as anchors, but they aren&rsquo;t nessecarily that strong unless there are a couple of them. A nickname like &lsquo;The Glove&rsquo;, or a move like the finger wag can be far more effective at helping us remember.</p>

<p>So if I look around the league, here are some guys without anchors, or with really weak ones:</p>

<p>Trey Young
Paul George
Anthony Davis
DeMar DeRozan
Donovan Mitchell</p>

<p>And two guys who I think will get lost in history eventually:
Giannis and Embiid. I think they both have pretty weak anchors, and it would take something really special to elevate them enough that they don&rsquo;t become severely under appreciated a decade after retirement.</p>

      <label for="li1yvli" class="commentText"><p>I define ‘forgotten’ as someone who doesn’t immediately come to mind as a superstar to a fan of basketball at the time, when asked decades later.</p>

<p>I was a huge fan in the 90s.</p>

<ul>
<li>Who immediately comes to mind as a superstar are: Jordan, Pippen, Rodman, Barkley, Hakeem, Malone and Stockton. That’s it. </li>
<li>When I think more deeply, I’ll add: Payton, Kemp, Penny, Clyde, Ewing, David Robinson, Reggie Miller. That’s it (Kobe, Shaq, Kidd I have as 00s).</li>
<li>If I go team by team I can scour for more big names: Kevin Johnson, Grant Hill, Dominique, Mark Price, Mookie Blaylock, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, roughly half the true superstars are remembered in my experience. Running the 2010s, my guess is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Immediately come to mind: Lebron, KD, Steph, Klay, Draymond, Harden.</li>
<li>When I think more deeply, I’ll add: Kyrie, Russ, Kawhi, AD, Dame, CP.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s a high bar. So some forgottens: Carmelo, PG, maybe Kawhi tbh, Kevin Love, Jimmy Butler, Marc Gasol (?). </p>

That along with having absolutely no talent around him until around 2018 and getting labelled an empty stats player while being the only competent player on the roster.</p>

<p>So yeah, he stuck through the some real shit to get here</p>

I feel like, in general, people 10-15 years down the line mostly remember tight MVP races and Finals teams— if you&rsquo;re like the 6th-10th best player in the league at your peak and never <em>quite</em> get over the conference finals hump, that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re liable to be&hellip; well, not &lsquo;forgotten,&rsquo; exactly, but maybe not remembered as well as some of your peers who <em>did</em> do one of those two things</p>

<p>Yes, he has two rings, most notably the one with the Raptors, but while he is a superstar top 10 guy in his prime he isn’t a “superstar” in the sense of being a marketable household name. To me he’ll be more remembered by casuals not like a LeBron, KD, Harden, or Curry, but as a top player that played in their era.</p>

      <label for="li4l5ot" class="commentText"><p>Harden was top 3 in mvp 5 times in a 6 season stretch, won three straight scoring titles with one as the highest scoring season since young mj, two assist titles, led the league in win shares 5 times, will have the second most threes ever for a while, has the second most threes ever in a season, led the league in threes 3 times, averaged over 25 ppg in <sup>15</sup>&frasl;<sub>15</sub> playoff series in Houston, and his stepback three is absolutely iconic.</p>

<p>Anyone saying harden for this is a moron.</p>

<p>Also while not nearly as good the people saying melo are also morons. He’s a god in a lot of NY for his freshman season alone, which was probably top 3 all time. Retired as a top ten scorer all time, first ballot hall of famer, won a scoring title, and was the face of the Knicks for years. He also constantly gets respect from his peers. Dude also hasn’t been a superstar level player for a decade and you can still refer to him by part of his first name and even non nba fans will know who you’re talking about. That means you’re pretty god damn famous.</p>

<p>Everyone is answering this as “what players do you dislike that don’t have a ring?”</p>

<p>Like harden is seriously such a wildly ridiculous answer, and anyone saying him either didn’t watch basketball until the past couple years or needs to get their brain checked immediately.</p>

<p>You literally can’t tell the story of 2010s nba without harden.</p>

<p>Unless the Bucks have a resurgent season and postseason under Doc Rivers, Lillard is pretty unlikely to experience another deep playoff run aside from the 2019 WCF.</p>
