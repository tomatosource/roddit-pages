      <label for="ltl4tz7" class="commentText"><p>Luka’s explosiveness isn’t about traditional speed or jumping ability. His ability to control and manipulate tempo, especially through deceleration, allows him to dominate at his own pace, making him one of the most explosive offensive players in the world. His deceleration is what allows him to create space, score at will, and make high-level plays that few other players can consistently replicate.</p>

<p>Luka&rsquo;s game isn’t about raw physical speed but about a mastery of pace, which, in today’s NBA, is just as deadly and perhaps even more impactful.</p>

      <label for="ltl5uac" class="commentText"><p>We still need some more ball handling and better POA defenders, preferably a PF backup too. We don&rsquo;t really have a guy like Caruso or White who can shoot the 3 efficiently, handle the ball as a third ball handler and defend All-Star guards. Perhaps one of the guys we signed in the offseason can provide that, or at least parts of it, we&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p>We also need more consistent shooting. During one of the finals games Luka was <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> from 3 and the rest of the team was 0/13. You just can&rsquo;t beat a team like the Celtics with that kind of collective shooting performance. The attempt at fixing this was getting Klay and replacing DJJ with Grimes/Marshall.</p>

<p>Also staying healthy during the regular season and playoffs for once would be nice. Every single year since we drafted Luka we&rsquo;ve had significant injuries both in the playoffs and regular season and the two seasons we didn&rsquo;t have as significant injuries in the playoffs we went to the WCF and the finals.</p>

<p>People tend to ignore it because he played, but Luka was basically playing on one leg since a couple games before the end of the regular season and it only got worse in the playoffs with how physical defenders were with him.</p>

<p>Lastly, home court advantage in the playoffs would be massive for the role players&rsquo; shooting. Luka shoots statistically significantly better away in the playoffs, but the rest of the team shoots much worse away from home. Obviously this ties in to the regular season injuries part.</p>

      <label for="ltl9185" class="commentText"><p>At this point, the long-term goal for the Mavs should be to develop two-way players and to have a reliable and consistent 6th man. We never attract star free agents, so it&rsquo;s time we give up on that idea (and thank god Nico Harrison understands that and overhauled this team over the last three years). Most of our players last season were very one-dimensional, and we were abused for it during the finals. Our defense is pretty solid, but the offense does stagnate hard if Luka and Kyrie are targeted. It took a godly performance from DJJ and PJ Washington to beat OKC, who were arguably the second best team in the playoffs last year. If they carried over their performance from OKC series to the Celtics series, it would&rsquo;ve been a much closer series. Unfortunately, we lost DJJ, but the team looks more promising this season, for now. But we&rsquo;re still a longshot from having the ideal team. My dream scenario this season is that Lively improves his free throws and becomes a threat from the midrange, Hardy leads the offense from the bench as a playmaker, and Klay is at least 60% of his pre-injury form.</p>

      <label for="ltl78y7" class="commentText"><p>As the other comment said, it&rsquo;s Luka&rsquo;s declaration that makes him so tough to guard, in combination with his strength, touch and basketball IQ. There&rsquo;s a thousand guys at every level who can run fast and jump high, good defenders are used to defending those types of players (unless we are talking about outlier level athleticism like Lebron, Jordan, Kobe, etc).</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s very few players who have the deceleration of a Luka or a Harden and are smart enough to take advantage of it. Thus most defenders don&rsquo;t know how to defend that because it&rsquo;s very rare and they haven&rsquo;t practiced against it. That&rsquo;s the whole his pace is wonky and you can&rsquo;t match it thing that opponents say about Luka.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think coaching is something you just lose over the years. He probably just got understandably hit hard by his wife&rsquo;s death and isn&rsquo;t that interested in coaching a lottery/play-in team.</p>

      <label for="ltl1esu" class="commentText"><p>Shitty way to phrase it by Jared Dudley, but he&rsquo;s right.</p>

<p>Being a former All-Time great player alongside having former player assistants like Jared Dudley around the team probably make it insanely easier to relate to players and understand each other.</p>

      <label for="ltl8ue3" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s right though. I think early on Luka clashed with Carlisle on occasion because he didn&rsquo;t always agree with him and he didn&rsquo;t necessarily respond to his type of people skills.</p>

<p>Luka is very full of emotion and he needs a calming presence to kind off keep him in check, Kidd provides that. Kyrie needs to respect the coach enough to follow him.</p>

<p>And obviously the coach must be able to give each player enough possessions to keep them happy. Carlisle also failed at this, making Porzingis feel underutilized.</p>

<p>For me the only other coaches 100% capable of doing this are Spoelstra, Popovich and maybe Ty Lue and Kerr. I don&rsquo;t think any other coach would be able to do that.</p>

<p>Also don&rsquo;t forget that we basically have 4 coaches right now lol. We&rsquo;ve got Kidd and then Vogel, Dudley and Sweeney as assistant coaches, all three of which could easily become head coaches if they wanted to. And on top of that there&rsquo;s Morris who is basically a player coach like Haslem at this point.</p>

<p>Rick and Kidd clashed when he came to Dallas because Rick wanted to micromanage to offense and eventually took a step back and let Kidd run the show. Gives this quote a lot more context lol.</p>
