    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>For me I think the Magic should be gunning hard for Malik Monk in FA. My reasoning is pretty simple; They&rsquo;re in need of playmaking, shooting and scoring, and Monk would provide all 3 without having to give up any trade assets.</p>

<p>However, I also like the fit because Monk would very specifically be a 3rd scorer for them which would fit in perfectly next to the young and still developing Banchero and Wagner, and not potentially risk stagnating their development as I feel has happened to a degree with the Cavs and Mobley/Garland when they acquired DMitch.</p>

      <label for="l9g0xfp" class="commentText"><p>I definitely get the appeal from the Spurs&rsquo; point of view, but I&rsquo;m just not really sure they have anyone/anything that the Cavs would particularly want. Keldon Johnson and the 8th overall pick is a decent starting point, but even with Garland&rsquo;s stock on the downturn right now I don&rsquo;t think that gets it done. Plus if Garland really does hit the market I imagine plenty of other teams would have interest in him.</p>

<p>Have a hard time believing the Celtics will trade Hauser given his importance on the team, his cheap contract, and their situation being over the second apron. Maybe if they don’t think they can resign him?</p>

Yes, they can feed Wemby better than most, but they would make Wemby&rsquo;s job on defense tougher and will take away the ball on his hands. Offense now are so creative at hunting guys, even the last 4 champions showed that you don&rsquo;t need a small guard.</p>

      <label for="l9gojh5" class="commentText"><p>I think its really just two things coming together that make it an obvious first thought. (1) Wemby/Spurs badly need a point guard and people want to see a generational talent on a competeitive/competent team. And (2) those guys seem to be available. I think they&rsquo;re answering &ldquo;What is the most immediate and obvious move that we can make?&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the best fit for Wemby and our window?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Too many redditors are short term thinkers. San Antonio needs to be thinking longer term.</p>

      <label for="l9fxarz" class="commentText"><p>Probably Philly getting PG. Philly improves to finish #2 in the East with a healthy PG. Plays Milwaukee or NY in the second round and loses.</p>

<p>Embiid demands a trade. PG then misses most of the next 2 seasons. PG’s cap hit hampers any ability to put talent around Maxey.</p>

<p>Maxey doesn’t resign once he becomes a UFA.</p>

<p>Philly starts the process over. Philly takes on the toxic contracts of Tobias Harris and Bradley Beale to regain some moderate draft capital.</p>

<p>I get why some Thunder fans are worried about Hartenstein not being a shooter, but if you want to play 5 out vs certain opponents you can just mainly roll with Chet for that game/series. Otherwise adding Hartenstein in FA allows OKC to play a bigger, more physical brand of basketball which was an element they were clearly missing last playoffs.</p>

      <label for="l9gm7lg" class="commentText"><p>Anecdotal, but the East was stupidly injured this year, basically every team but the Celtics just had bad luck or shit went wrong. You guys lost arguably the best player in the world, plus the coaching thing blew up. Embiid was out almost all year and hurt in the playoffs, the Cavs were ridiculously hurt most of the year, Brooklyn, Toronto, and Charlotte all had fairly good teams but got in early holes and tanked the rest of the season. The West played better this season, but they aren&rsquo;t better talent wise.</p>

<p>I think I could realistically make a case that 4 of the top 5 teams in the league are in the West.</p>

<p>Yes, if we were in the East we probably don&rsquo;t make the finals. But we would be the 2nd seed instead of 5th in the west. The Bucks would literally be a playin team in the West with the 49-33 record you had. That&rsquo;s why we say the West is stronger. But yes, the Celtics are the best team in the league.</p>

      <label for="l9gh4c2" class="commentText"><p>I’m a Celtics fan but really fell in love with this Knicks team. I’d love to see them get a star that compliments Brunson and OG. Part of me thinks Embiid would be the perfect guy, but the very idea of playing for Thibs just caused his knee to implode.</p>

<p>But if he opts out and signs a lower value contract but for more years it could be possible.</p>

<p>McConnell, Mathurin, Walker, Smith get to around 30M.
If PG signs a 4 year 120M deal it could work.</p>

      <label for="l9gdcri" class="commentText"><p>Suns need to see if they can trade KD for depth. I know, really unorthodox, but it is the only way out of their current situation. Would OKC see him as a guy that pulls them over the line? Plenty of historic relevance. Something centred around Giddey, Dort, the other Williams (for my sanity), the 12th pick and the upcoming Philly 25 1st?</p>
