No one here in Africa played basketball in the early 90&rsquo;s, and no one could name an NBA player apart from Michael Jordan.
Angola is the team who has the most African Championships cause it&rsquo;s played without NBA players, even my country Tunisia have won 2 chips the past 8 years while we are not a top basketball country.</p>

      <label for="lloanwf" class="commentText"><p>But we do understand that. Every time I see these debates people like to pretend that what is being said is “older players were total trash and deserve no credit”. Maybe that’s being said by the total numbskulls (Anthony Edwards included)</p>

<p>But the entire debate hinges on the idea that the current generation is as good as it is because every generation builds off of the previous generation.</p>

<p>I don’t know if we’ll ever see somebody quite like LeBron. Somebody who, at 16, was gracing the cover of SI being deemed the Chosen One and he actually may have exceeded those expectations. But we will absolutely see somebody that is more talented than him. Why? Because some kid will have grown up watching LeBron’s highlights and working out in the gym with an insane desire to be better than him.</p>

<p>Now we have the last 6 MVPs as non-americans, this was untinkable to happen even once in the 90s.</p>

<p>Which can be attributed to the Dream Team. The Dream Team didnt have a worthy opponent at thst time and no one&rsquo;s disputing that. They are atill not overrated because their inclusion in the olympics absooutely catapulted basketball to the 2nd popular sports (behind football) in the world. The basketball culture in the 90s all over the world really owed THAT much to the Dream Team and as such they are rightfully belong to one of the premiere team ever assembled not only in team prowess but in their ability to elevate and revooutionize  a sports appeal to the world.</p>

<p>Hakeem &amp; Ewing weren&rsquo;t US citizens until they moved to the US during their youth.</p>

<p>Wilkins was born and raised in France for a while.</p>

<p>Point is - you are talking BS. Maybe todays US players just are wayy less dominant and worse than the late 80s to 90s guys (Magic - Bird - Jordan) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; old ass Bron, KD, Curry</p>

<p>There areany reasons why the US dominated with the Dream Team - but Europe and Euroleague was in their heyday during the 90s and 2000s and managed to keep Euro Stars in Europe rather than have them relocate to the US to playin the NBA. Sabonis would have been a perennial All-NBA player if he went to the NBA earlier</p>

<p>When in the hell did i say Dream Team sucked ? I literally said they were the best fucking team assembled for Christ sake.</p>

      <label for="llokzdn" class="commentText"><p>They said “overrated”. They’re not. Full stop. That was the greatest team assembled (and could have been better if they had selected Shaw instead of Laettner, Isiah, Wilkins, Hardaway, Richmond, Kemp, Olajuwon if he had citizenship that year, etc.) That team was never challenged, but if they were you would have seen something. You got a sense of it when MJ and Scottie had their eyes on Kukoc on Croatia… if they had wanted to, they would’ve won games by closer to 80. At some point, the charm would’ve been gone, and they’d look like bullies. Minutes were managed, since they were coming off of the playoffs (MJ and Scottie coming off of b2b Finals runs; long seasons, so they cruised during the Olympics).</p>

<p>SG -Prime Jordan
SF - Prime Pippen
PF - Prime Barkley
SG - Prime Drexler
PF - Prime Malone
PG - Prime Stockton
SG - Young Miller
C - Prime Ewing
SF - Young Mullin
C - Young Robinson
PG - Magic (coming off the retirement, still Magic; ~33 yrs old
SF/PF - Bird (still an All-Star; shell of himself due to injury)</p>

<p>Inside, outside, midrange, free throws (in case there ever would be a close game)… deadly.</p>

That team excelled in every facet, offense and defense, even while sleepwalking.  Review their stats during the tournament. Line them up today and they still get gold, easier than this year’s Olympic team. By a good bit. More competitive overall, sure - but then Team USA steps on the gas a bit.</p>

<p>The 1992 team did face teams that “would challenge the worst NBA teams”; the whole reason FOR the Dream Team was because the USA was coming off a bronze medal - European teams played together for years as pros, and were beginning to bully the younger US teams. Those Yugoslavia, Croatia, etc. teams had literal NBA talent and would be great competition; same for some of the Central/South American teams. It used to be an NBA ambassador program tradition for the NBA champion to play some of the European professional teams. NBA teams won, but the games were competitive.</p>

<p>Point is, don’t believe every team they faced was like those Angola highlights floating around.</p>

      <label for="lln6wjs" class="commentText"><p>They didn&rsquo;t have a Loul Deng at the time to teach them the fundamentals.</p>

<p>There was no internet for them to see moves and watch games consistently. At most Africa might have gotten 1 game a week to watch at an obscure time if they had a broadcasted game accessible.</p>

<p>At that time most of Europe got 1 NBA game to watch a week. So its hard to develop your bball skills with zero infrastructure or minimal to no videos to watch.</p>

<p>After that embiid turn over and LBJ horrible bricked 3, that hero KD 3 was dangerous if he didn&rsquo;t make it. The ball stopped moving and offense got super stale. They had some luck on their side</p>

<p>As if the world getting better at basketball isn’t good for basketball itself. And as if beating teams that are actually good is somehow less impressive.</p>

<p>The us hasn’t gotten worse at basketball. The rest of the world is better. And that’s something to be celebrated, not ridiculed.</p>

<p>Carl lewis and other track stars times would be demolished today. Would you say the 9th best 100m runner is better than Carl Lewis? in 2024 Carl Lewis would have been tied for 8-10th place with 9.86</p>
