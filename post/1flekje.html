      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1flekje/knowing_how_immensely_hyped_anthony_davis_was_at/"><p>Knowing how immensely hyped Anthony Davis was at Kentucky, and looking back at his career now that he&rsquo;s nearing the end of his prime, do you think he met the expectations that were placed on him?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>AD was seen as a generational prospect, one of the best defensive prospects ever. Before Wemby, AD was the best prospect post LeBron. There was once a time 6-7 years ago when we were still debating if we would rather build around AD, Embiid or Giannis. Obviously those latter two guys have passed him by now.</p>

<p>In his career so far he is an NBA champion, 9x All Star, 5x All NBA including 4x First Team, and 5x All Defense. He had two top-5 MVP finishes, 5th in 2015 and 3rd in 2018. He was selected to the NBA 75 as well.</p>

<p>AD was probably a top 5 player at one point, or pretty close to it. But for most of his prime it always felt like he was hovering around that end of the top 10 range around 9th-10th and never truly cracked the top end &ldquo;best player in the league&rdquo; tier.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s turning 32 this season so it&rsquo;s likely that his prime is pretty close to ending so I think we can have a bit of a &ldquo;retrospective&rdquo; on his career atp. Do you think he met the expectations of being a generational superstar?</p>

      <label for="lo2b4ej" class="commentText"><p>I think AD met the hype, was stuck in purgatory for a while early in his career. His health has always been a factor but he is undoubtedly a top player in the league when he is on the floor.</p>

<p>He was a defensive anchor coming out of college, all of his offensive output probably exceeded expectations early.</p>

<p>The fact that Gobert will walk away with multiple DPOYs while AD has been a superior defender his whole career is kind of BS.  I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll console himself with his millions and a ring, so he needs no pity. But it is a shame, nonetheless.</p>

<p>Expectations after year 3 where he was 3rd in MVP voting? A bit of a disappointment but it&rsquo;s no big deal. I felt he was going to be the best PF of all time, but the Pelicans botched it and he just couldnt stay healthy on the Lakers.</p>

      <label for="lo34n8w" class="commentText"><p>This is my favorite response so far. Out of college he was a generational defensive prospect, and he made a number of all defensive teams, a number of all NBA teams, probably led the league in blocks.</p>

<p>When he blossomed super early into an MVP candidate his narrative changed and whether due to injuries or circumstance, he wasn&rsquo;t an MVP candidate every year. but no one expected him to become a consistent 25+ point scorer with a 3 point shot.</p>

<p>I say all this and I don&rsquo;t even like the guy, but it&rsquo;s crazy to say he hasn&rsquo;t lived up to the hype</p>

      <label for="lo2okfd" class="commentText"><p>I think the disappointment is that he was supposed to be the #1, but it’s clear the team’s still both reliant on and led by LeBron. I think some of it is LeBron is still playing at a much higher level than anyone expected for his age, but also it really seems clear AD isn’t going to be an actual leader for the team - he’s similar to KD, where he’s absolutely one of the best players out there, but he doesn’t have the temperament or game style to get the rest of the team going, too.</p>

<p>(To be clear, I don’t mean this as a knock on AD - when he’s on, he’s top-5. Leadership is a different skill from Basketball.)</p>

<p>ADs definitely a more mild-mannered temperament&hellip;. but he&rsquo;s also alongside the greatest alpha dog the league has ever known, so it&rsquo;s unsurprising that he&rsquo;s playing second fiddle.</p>

      <label for="lo374i7" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, and again, some of this is because LeBron is still shockingly good and because &ldquo;Give LeBron the ball and let him figure it out&rdquo; is still maybe the best play in basketball (even if &ldquo;figure it out&rdquo; is &ldquo;dump it to AD and let him work&rdquo;), so it&rsquo;s hard to judge AD solely on his own merits here.</p>

      <label for="lo37mvn" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I think he could be the best player on a championship team, and he arguably was for their ring, but that&rsquo;s not the same thing as a team leader - again, using KD as an example, KD was arguably the best player on the dubs during their run, but he wasn&rsquo;t the leader of the team. You still need someone getting the other 4 players thinking and moving in the same direction, and that&rsquo;s a different skillset. It means you can&rsquo;t have a team with Just AD in the same way that, like, LeBron plus 4 other humans was a title team or Jokic plus 4 Serbians is damn near a gold medal.</p>

He went from a franchise that couldn’t put pieces around him to contend, to one that had a guy next to him who would make any player in history have to play second fiddle. If AD had gotten to be the undisputed top dog on a contender, I think he’d get a little more credit</p>

      <label for="lo4c720" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s the thing though right? Could he have been the top guy on a legitimate contender? That&rsquo;s not even shade at him, he is bare minimum a top 10 guy in the league when healthy. But I don&rsquo;t think there are more than a few guys who can be the best player on a legitimate contender, barring just having an absolutely insanely stacked roster. I do think he lived up to the hype, but I also highly doubt he retires with a ring in any scenario where he&rsquo;s the best player on his team for his entire career.</p>

      <label for="lo4es4q" class="commentText"><p>I think that’s totally a fair question. I would agree he lived up to the hype, but he might never have been good enough to be that guy. But if you look at the history of the NBA, how many different guys have been the best player on a championship team? I mean, since 1990, you have Zeke, Jordan, Hakeem, Shaq, arguably David Robinson, Duncan, whoever from the 04 Pistons, Wade, Garnett, Kobe, LeBron, Dirk, Kawhi, Steph, arguably KD, Giannis, Jokic, and now Tatum. That’s 16-18 guys in the past 35 seasons, right? That is to say, you have multiple guys who could claim to be top 20 players in that era who never fit that bill. AD maybe could’ve been that guy, but I think getting close on his own would’ve meant a lot</p>

<p>I think he may have came short of the hype and potential people had for him after his 2nd/3rd seasons. He was someone who people said will become the best player in the league. Probably peaked in the 5th-7th range in the 2018 and 2020 seasons.</p>

But when you are able to dominate defensively and also hit fadeaway buzzer beater 3s over Jokic, and are part of a big 2 on a title team, you are special and proved it.</p>

<p>I’m a Kentucky fan and he’s the best player we’ve ever had. I don’t think it is very close.</p>

<p>To win titles, He needs a primary playmaker next to him (like Lebron or Rondo). He’s the best defender of his generation alongside Giannis. It is a total joke he hasn’t won multiple Defensive Player of the Year awards. Rudy Gobert has been played off court in numerous playoffs, that is not fathomable with Giannis or AD.</p>

<p>There is a difference between regular season and playoff defense. The NBA should create award to honor best defensive player of the playoffs. AD has at least one of those in the bubble.</p>

<p>He did what most people expect great players to do, which is win a championship, but I think people viewing him as the second option during that run sort of diminishes how great he was. I genuinely didn&rsquo;t know who Finals MVP would be until the last few games.</p>

His big #s early in his career did not lead to winning and he needed to join a team with Lebron in order to win a Title. That&rsquo;s not a knock on him, but he also won&rsquo;t be remembered in the same way guys like Giannis, Embiid, or [of course] Jokic will be remembered. KD has clearly had a more impressive career and he still needed to join a historically great team in order to win.</p>

That’s why he doesn’t have more than one ring at the moment. He’s done everything physically possible for the Lakers. They’ve wasted both Lebron’s final years as well as AD’s prime.</p>

      <label for="lo2hf30" class="commentText"><p>If you look at the decade or so of his career, the only question you can have is his health and on balance that hasn&rsquo;t been that bad as things go for a modern big man.</p>

<p>12-13- amazing rookie year undone by injuries so Lillard is rookie of the year</p>

<p>13-14- even better but again, injuries cut it short</p>

<p>14-15- still getting better and is healthy enough to take a not very good team into the playoffs where they get swept by the Warriors on their way to starting a championship run</p>

<p>15-16-Another season ending injury</p>

<p>16-17- He continues to be very good and is healthy but NO misses the playoffs, so if you want to get on him about that, this I guess is your season but his team was just not that good</p>

<p>17-18- Great season, and we get the brief time of a twin towers with him and Cousins before injuries again hit, though in a twist Davis is ok and he makes the playoffs for the second time. This time, Portland is swept out of the first round but he is again taken out by the Warriors after that.</p>

<p>18-19- Things fall apart in NO</p>

<p>After that, his Lakers history is pretty well known, so on balance, the issues has mostly been that he has been stuck on just bad teams and/or been hurt, though even a lot of those injury seasons early on I don&rsquo;t think would have made a difference in terms of going deep into the playoffs, given where his team was. All you can really get on him for, I guess, is that he wasn&rsquo;t good enough to power a bad team into the playoffs early on, but that has almost as much to do with him being in the West as anything else</p>

      <label for="lo2iel7" class="commentText"><p>He probably could have benefited from leaving NOLA sooner. He has been terribly injury prone, and is inconsistent with effort. However he has been an amazing defender, and much better offensively than most people thought he could be. Has stretches where he looks like a contender for best player in the league, but also has games where he looks very unengaged. Overall I think he definitely exceeded expectations, but with hindsight possibly did not reach his full potential.</p>

I don&rsquo;t mean this to come off like I&rsquo;m knocking him, he was a key factor to an NBA championship,  a perinneal All NBA caliber player etc&hellip; thats more than  90% of every NBA player ever can say. But when I look at his skillset (there&rsquo;s nothing he can&rsquo;t do) I feel he had the potential to be a top 20(?) player all time. Maybe languishing in NO for so long was a factor in this.</p>

<p>I also think he was hurt playing in NOLA for a while, people just don&rsquo;t watch us and we had some really bad injury luck here. If Boogie just made that damn free throw and didn&rsquo;t get hurt who know how that season goes. They were really finding their stride at that point. I also don&rsquo;t think those NOLA teams were as bad as people remember, we had some bad injury luck, but those teams were competitive and if AD and co had been healthy a little more, I think they win more than just the one playoff series in his time here.</p>

<p>Either way, AD is an amazing player. It&rsquo;s a shame he threw any goodwill from New Orleans out the window on his way out, because he should be much more celebrated by the organization and the fan base here than he is and will be.</p>

      <label for="lo3t604" class="commentText"><p>Hell yes. He was on MVP pace if he stayed on the Pels or joined another team that built around him. He simply chose to play with LeBron and that kinda dampered the hype around him but it hasn&rsquo;t changed his abilities. We all know he&rsquo;s capable of being in convo for top players. Health is the only concern and rat take isn&rsquo;t a concern anymore.</p>

<p>Nothing is guaranteed with a #1 pick anymore and I would be ecstatic if I got his caliber of player.</p>

      <label for="lo3v2hx" class="commentText"><p>I think the hype was definitely that he would get at least one MVP maybe multiple, and push to be the best player in the league and maybe an all-time great. I don’t personally see him accomplishing any of that, so no, I don’t think he’s met the hype.</p>

<p>Edit: he did make the NBA 75. So I’m sure there will be people who quibble about his “all-time great” status. That’s fine. To me “all-time great” status is reserved for 30 or so dudes in the modern nba, and he doesn’t make that cut for me 🤷🏼‍♂️</p>

Also, oddly his jumper was butter and he was automatic. Truly automatic. Was criminal not to pair him with a good other superstar at that time. Yes he couldn’t stay healthy often but he was really the goods.</p>

<p>What he is now is way different. It’s normal. It’s understandable.</p>

<p>A young AD with say Dame Lillard would have been a nightmare.</p>

<p>I would argue that his biggest issue he had was that he was too good early in his career. People thought that he was going to be like a top 10 player of all time after his first couple seasons.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s put it this way, if you took every #1 pick from 2000-2020 and put them in a draft, knowing what we know now about their NBA careers, he probably goes 2nd or 3rd behind LeBron, and maybe Anthony Edwards.</p>

<p>I give it a <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> based on if we ran his career 10 times.</p>

<p>50% of the time his career would have been better.  50% of the time worse.</p>

<p>He has some monster seasons and a ring.  Impact player on both sides of the ball.</p>

<p>But two years ago though a lot of people had given up on him as a top tier player.  His shot disappeared, always injured and in questionable shape.</p>

<p>He was terrific last year and back as a top 10 player.</p>

      <label for="lo4c1vd" class="commentText"><p>At the end of the 2015 season, Alvin Gentry resigned as Steve Kerr&rsquo;s top assistant to take the reins of the Pelicans, boldly declaring that he was going to coach the best player in the league not named LeBron James, I found that a bit out of line, given he had just spent a year coaching Steph Curry - in his 1st MVP season, no less.</p>

<p>At different periods during LeBron&rsquo;s tenure in the Lakers, he&rsquo;s expressed a desire to take a second seat to AD, anointing him as the future leader on the squad.</p>

<p>Well, Gentry was wrong. Curry won his 2nd MVP in the 15-16 season, while LeBron took Finals MVP. Likewise, while AD has been the Lakers&rsquo; best player at times, it remains &lsquo;Bron&rsquo;s team - and he was once again FMVP in the (Bubble) Laker&rsquo;s lone championship season since he joined them.</p>

<p>So AD&rsquo;s had a great career and he&rsquo;s been a fantastic player.</p>

<p>Just never one who lead a team to a championship or collects those &lsquo;best of the best&rsquo; individual accolades.</p>

<p>So maybe he&rsquo;s performed a bit under the rather heavy expectations placed on him.</p>

<p>But I doubt he&rsquo;s going to be unhappy with his career.</p>

      <label for="lo4envg" class="commentText"><p>I’d say Davis has certainly hit expectations of him when he was drafted but hasn’t exactly transcended them. He’s a perennial All-Star and is (or at least was) always included in the Top 10 best NBA players conversation. But with no MVPs and being co-star to LeBron’s leading man in an underwhelming Bubble Finals, he’s still a cut below the top tiers of greatest PFs ever for me (Tier 1: Duncan, Tier 2: KG, Dirk, &amp; Giannis, Tier 3: Utah 32, Barkley, Tier 4: AD &amp; Bob Petit)</p>

<p>But AD still has time, though. 32 is new 27 for many of the league’s top players so he still has time to finish his career strong.</p>

<p>AD is 31. When KD was his age he was 31. Which means you have to include him missing the entire 2020 season.</p>

<p>You’re also not taking into account that AD played in 2 shortened seasons in this span, and another (2019) in which he was forced to rest despite being healthy.</p>

<p>And finally, no, an accumulation of minor injuries is rarely more significant in how a player ages than 1-2 major injuries that sideline a player for a season.</p>

      <label for="lo31i70" class="commentText"><p>AD is currently 31 but last season he was 30, why would I include 31 when AD hasn&rsquo;t played his age 31 season?</p>

<p>KD also played in those same 2 shortened seasons. Even if you want to make the argument that AD had to sit out during the end of his last season with NOLA, he still has plenty more missed games than KD during the same number of years and a greater number of short seasons than KD.</p>

<p>Studies have shown that the &ldquo;wear and tear&rdquo; of frequent minor injuries can accelerate the aging process in athletes. Chronic inflammation, lingering pain, and reduced mobility from repeated minor injuries can gradually erode athleticism over time, which may prevent players from sustaining peak performance longer into their careers​.</p>

<p>And no, you were comparing AD’s games played to KD’s <em>at the same age</em> which is BEFORE the 2020 and 2021 shortened seasons…</p>

      <label for="lo2ej1d" class="commentText"><p>Absolutely. One of the best defenders of his generation. Elite rim protection, great help defense, really quick feet for his size. When he&rsquo;s having a good defensive game, he controls everything. On offense, he has improved a lot - his peak definitely was during the bubble run. Since then, his mid range game fell off, but he&rsquo;s still really good under the basket. Especially his putbacks are cool, he&rsquo;s not a flashy dunker, but a violent one.</p>

<p>I just love his game overall, it&rsquo;s really entertaining to watch.</p>
