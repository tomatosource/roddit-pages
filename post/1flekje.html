      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1flekje/knowing_how_immensely_hyped_anthony_davis_was_at/"><p>Knowing how immensely hyped Anthony Davis was at Kentucky, and looking back at his career now that he&rsquo;s nearing the end of his prime, do you think he met the expectations that were placed on him?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>AD was seen as a generational prospect, one of the best defensive prospects ever. Before Wemby, AD was the best prospect post LeBron. There was once a time 6-7 years ago when we were still debating if we would rather build around AD, Embiid or Giannis. Obviously those latter two guys have passed him by now.</p>

<p>In his career so far he is an NBA champion, 9x All Star, 5x All NBA including 4x First Team, and 5x All Defense. He had two top-5 MVP finishes, 5th in 2015 and 3rd in 2018. He was selected to the NBA 75 as well.</p>

<p>AD was probably a top 5 player at one point, or pretty close to it. But for most of his prime it always felt like he was hovering around that end of the top 10 range around 9th-10th and never truly cracked the top end &ldquo;best player in the league&rdquo; tier.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s turning 32 this season so it&rsquo;s likely that his prime is pretty close to ending so I think we can have a bit of a &ldquo;retrospective&rdquo; on his career atp. Do you think he met the expectations of being a generational superstar?</p>

      <label for="lo2okfd" class="commentText"><p>I think the disappointment is that he was supposed to be the #1, but it’s clear the team’s still both reliant on and led by LeBron. I think some of it is LeBron is still playing at a much higher level than anyone expected for his age, but also it really seems clear AD isn’t going to be an actual leader for the team - he’s similar to KD, where he’s absolutely one of the best players out there, but he doesn’t have the temperament or game style to get the rest of the team going, too.</p>

<p>(To be clear, I don’t mean this as a knock on AD - when he’s on, he’s top-5. Leadership is a different skill from Basketball.)</p>

<p>He was a defensive anchor coming out of college, all of his offensive output probably exceeded expectations early.</p>

<p>I also think he was hurt playing in NOLA for a while, people just don&rsquo;t watch us and we had some really bad injury luck here. If Boogie just made that damn free throw and didn&rsquo;t get hurt who know how that season goes. They were really finding their stride at that point. I also don&rsquo;t think those NOLA teams were as bad as people remember, we had some bad injury luck, but those teams were competitive and if AD and co had been healthy a little more, I think they win more than just the one playoff series in his time here.</p>

<p>Either way, AD is an amazing player. It&rsquo;s a shame he threw any goodwill from New Orleans out the window on his way out, because he should be much more celebrated by the organization and the fan base here than he is and will be.</p>

      <label for="lo2g266" class="commentText"><p>The only knock I could say is the jumper didn’t get as good as it seemed it would early in his career, I’m not sure if playing without the ball as much is part of that. I do think the way he plays now offensively is a good use of his skills.</p>

<p>I’m a Kentucky fan and he’s the best player we’ve ever had. I don’t think it is very close.</p>

<p>To win titles, He needs a primary playmaker next to him (like Lebron or Rondo). He’s the best defender of his generation alongside Giannis. It is a total joke he hasn’t won multiple Defensive Player of the Year awards. Rudy Gobert has been played off court in numerous playoffs, that is not fathomable with Giannis or AD.</p>

<p>There is a difference between regular season and playoff defense. The NBA should create award to honor best defensive player of the playoffs. AD has at least one of those in the bubble.</p>

      <label for="lo2g36z" class="commentText"><p>It baffles me sometimes how little he&rsquo;s talked about when discussing the best players of the last decade. He was putting up cartoonish numbers during his last few years in New Orleans. I knew he was good defensively but then his offense just took off into the stratosphere.</p>

<p>He did what most people expect great players to do, which is win a championship, but I think people viewing him as the second option during that run sort of diminishes how great he was. I genuinely didn&rsquo;t know who Finals MVP would be until the last few games.</p>

<p>I think he may have came short of the hype and potential people had for him after his 2nd/3rd seasons. He was someone who people said will become the best player in the league. Probably peaked in the 5th-7th range in the 2018 and 2020 seasons.</p>

      <label for="lo2ns50" class="commentText"><p>I think you could reasonably argue that with Steph and KD hurt, for one year only in 2020, LeBron and AD were the two best players in the league at the time. It was a very brief window though, and it kind of relied on AD’s insane midrange shooting in the playoffs, which he never really replicated afterwards</p>

      <label for="lo2i7x6" class="commentText"><p>I think he met his hype, but I also think if not for injury, we can see more of his prime, or maybe surpass the hype we expect him to be, he had a talent that can match up Tim Duncan if not for injury, not meaning he can surpass Tim but just maybe second or 1A and 1B type of player</p>

      <label for="lo2iel7" class="commentText"><p>He probably could have benefited from leaving NOLA sooner. He has been terribly injury prone, and is inconsistent with effort. However he has been an amazing defender, and much better offensively than most people thought he could be. Has stretches where he looks like a contender for best player in the league, but also has games where he looks very unengaged. Overall I think he definitely exceeded expectations, but with hindsight possibly did not reach his full potential.</p>

      <label for="lo2ej1d" class="commentText"><p>Absolutely. One of the best defenders of his generation. Elite rim protection, great help defense, really quick feet for his size. When he&rsquo;s having a good defensive game, he controls everything. On offense, he has improved a lot - his peak definitely was during the bubble run. Since then, his mid range game fell off, but he&rsquo;s still really good under the basket. Especially his putbacks are cool, he&rsquo;s not a flashy dunker, but a violent one.</p>

<p>I just love his game overall, it&rsquo;s really entertaining to watch.</p>

      <label for="lo2hf30" class="commentText"><p>If you look at the decade or so of his career, the only question you can have is his health and on balance that hasn&rsquo;t been that bad as things go for a modern big man.</p>

<p>12-13- amazing rookie year undone by injuries so Lillard is rookie of the year</p>

<p>13-14- even better but again, injuries cut it short</p>

<p>14-15- still getting better and is healthy enough to take a not very good team into the playoffs where they get swept by the Warriors on their way to starting a championship run</p>

<p>15-16-Another season ending injury</p>

<p>16-17- He continues to be very good and is healthy but NO misses the playoffs, so if you want to get on him about that, this I guess is your season but his team was just not that good</p>

<p>17-18- Great season, and we get the brief time of a twin towers with him and Cousins before injuries again hit, though in a twist Davis is ok and he makes the playoffs for the second time. This time, Portland is swept out of the first round but he is again taken out by the Warriors after that.</p>

<p>18-19- Things fall apart in NO</p>

<p>After that, his Lakers history is pretty well known, so on balance, the issues has mostly been that he has been stuck on just bad teams and/or been hurt, though even a lot of those injury seasons early on I don&rsquo;t think would have made a difference in terms of going deep into the playoffs, given where his team was. All you can really get on him for, I guess, is that he wasn&rsquo;t good enough to power a bad team into the playoffs early on, but that has almost as much to do with him being in the West as anything else</p>
