      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1flekje/knowing_how_immensely_hyped_anthony_davis_was_at/"><p>Knowing how immensely hyped Anthony Davis was at Kentucky, and looking back at his career now that he&rsquo;s nearing the end of his prime, do you think he met the expectations that were placed on him?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>AD was seen as a generational prospect, one of the best defensive prospects ever. Before Wemby, AD was the best prospect post LeBron. There was once a time 6-7 years ago when we were still debating if we would rather build around AD, Embiid or Giannis. Obviously those latter two guys have passed him by now.</p>

<p>In his career so far he is an NBA champion, 9x All Star, 5x All NBA including 4x First Team, and 5x All Defense. He had two top-5 MVP finishes, 5th in 2015 and 3rd in 2018. He was selected to the NBA 75 as well.</p>

<p>AD was probably a top 5 player at one point, or pretty close to it. But for most of his prime it always felt like he was hovering around that end of the top 10 range around 9th-10th and never truly cracked the top end &ldquo;best player in the league&rdquo; tier.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s turning 32 this season so it&rsquo;s likely that his prime is pretty close to ending so I think we can have a bit of a &ldquo;retrospective&rdquo; on his career atp. Do you think he met the expectations of being a generational superstar?</p>

<p>He was a defensive anchor coming out of college, all of his offensive output probably exceeded expectations early.</p>

<p>The fact that Gobert will walk away with multiple DPOYs while AD has been a superior defender his whole career is kind of BS.  I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll console himself with his millions and a ring, so he needs no pity. But it is a shame, nonetheless.</p>

<p>When he blossomed super early into an MVP candidate his narrative changed and whether due to injuries or circumstance, he wasn&rsquo;t an MVP candidate every year. but no one expected him to become a consistent 25+ point scorer with a 3 point shot.</p>

<p>I say all this and I don&rsquo;t even like the guy, but it&rsquo;s crazy to say he hasn&rsquo;t lived up to the hype</p>

I think some of it is LeBron is still playing at a much higher level than anyone expected for his age, but also it really seems clear AD isn’t going to be an actual leader for the team - he’s similar to KD, where he’s absolutely one of the best players out there, but he doesn’t have the temperament or game style to get the rest of the team going, too.</p>

<p>(To be clear, I don’t mean this as a knock on AD - when he’s on, he’s top-5. Leadership is a different skill from Basketball.)</p>

      <label for="lo2sd7w" class="commentText"><p>AD&rsquo;s grown a lot in this area imo, but it really only shows when Lebron is out for a stretch of games, unfortunately.</p>

<p>ADs definitely a more mild-mannered temperament&hellip;. but he&rsquo;s also alongside the greatest alpha dog the league has ever known, so it&rsquo;s unsurprising that he&rsquo;s playing second fiddle.</p>

      <label for="lo374i7" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, and again, some of this is because LeBron is still shockingly good and because &ldquo;Give LeBron the ball and let him figure it out&rdquo; is still maybe the best play in basketball (even if &ldquo;figure it out&rdquo; is &ldquo;dump it to AD and let him work&rdquo;), so it&rsquo;s hard to judge AD solely on his own merits here.</p>

      <label for="lo37mvn" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I think he could be the best player on a championship team, and he arguably was for their ring, but that&rsquo;s not the same thing as a team leader - again, using KD as an example, KD was arguably the best player on the dubs during their run, but he wasn&rsquo;t the leader of the team. You still need someone getting the other 4 players thinking and moving in the same direction, and that&rsquo;s a different skillset. It means you can&rsquo;t have a team with Just AD in the same way that, like, LeBron plus 4 other humans was a title team or Jokic plus 4 Serbians is damn near a gold medal.</p>

      <label for="lo4es4q" class="commentText"><p>I think that’s totally a fair question. I would agree he lived up to the hype, but he might never have been good enough to be that guy. But if you look at the history of the NBA, how many different guys have been the best player on a championship team? I mean, since 1990, you have Zeke, Jordan, Hakeem, Shaq, arguably David Robinson, Duncan, whoever from the 04 Pistons, Wade, Garnett, Kobe, LeBron, Dirk, Kawhi, Steph, arguably KD, Giannis, Jokic, and now Tatum. That’s 16-18 guys in the past 35 seasons, right? That is to say, you have multiple guys who could claim to be top 20 players in that era who never fit that bill. AD maybe could’ve been that guy, but I think getting close on his own would’ve meant a lot</p>

      <label for="lo5te1v" class="commentText"><p>Yea this is exactly my thought as well, re:lakers. I think leaving NO was a good move (and getting drafted there unfortunate), but I think joining LeBron was bad for his career and perception. In NO he was absolutely good enough to be the best player on a title team, if he left to a team where could’ve been the actual best guy with a solid robin (like going to Miami with butler for example, not saying that was an option just providing a hypothetical—actually going to Boston with Kyrie at the time was the other most talked about option outside of LA, and that may have actually worked with horford at the 5, Hayward, brown, since Tatum was the main trade piece in those talks), he would’ve been looked at better, would probably have an MVP and DPOY. I think he idolized LeBron and when LeBron decided he wanted AD he got star struck and went there, but going to almost any other team would’ve been better.</p>

      <label for="lo4jviv" class="commentText"><p>I think you’re forgetting how good Harden was those playoffs too. Kawhi was also just coming off a legendary run. There is no real argument over those two.</p>

<p>I get AD played better than Giannis in the playoffs that year, but he did so with the luxury of playing next to Lebron. Giannis was 2x MVP then. I’d personally have him 6th behind these guys and Jokic. But the highest possible is 4th</p>

      <label for="lo2gdzq" class="commentText"><p>AD in the 2020 playoffs was legit one of the highest peaks ever, the only reason people don&rsquo;t see it as such is because his teammate was LeBron, who was the only player in the league that could match him in those games.</p>

<p>Also if being able to give you 25+ a game and play DPOY defense for a decade isn&rsquo;t meeting expectations then I don&rsquo;t know what would tbh.</p>

      <label for="lo3k74d" class="commentText"><p>This is my take as well.  If he hadn&rsquo;t had that title run, OK maybe you say he didn&rsquo;t live up to the hype.  But when you are able to dominate defensively and also hit fadeaway buzzer beater 3s over Jokic, and are part of a big 2 on a title team, you are special and proved it.</p>

He was like <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> in the championship game at UK, his offensive game was raw and nobody really knew how it would develop. Everyone would talk about how he used to be a guard and the jumper was pretty, but nobody really expected him to be a dominant offensive player.</p>

<p>He was thought to be a Bill Russell-type defensive prospect that had some offensive potential. When he averaged 20/gm his second year it was a pleasant surprise and then year 3 was kinda bonkers, that was probably what ppl figured his prime would look like but he got to that level early.</p>

      <label for="lo4llw6" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d say if you simulate AD&rsquo;s career 100 times, his actual career is probably the median. Won a title, one of the best defensive players of his generation, borderline top 10 player in the league for 10+ years, and maybe he&rsquo;s got a few more great years in the tank.</p>

<p>This is prolly an avg AD career based on his potential, so I&rsquo;d say he met expectations.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s probably some outlier simulations where he becomes the best player in the NBA and wins multiple titles and carries his own team. There&rsquo;s probably also some simulations where his injury history is even more severe and totally ruins his career.</p>

<p>Tldr: he def met expectations, and probably hit about the lvl that he was always going to hit as a player. Very very good, but not quite one of the all time greats.</p>

      <label for="lo2g266" class="commentText"><p>The only knock I could say is the jumper didn’t get as good as it seemed it would early in his career, I’m not sure if playing without the ball as much is part of that. I do think the way he plays now offensively is a good use of his skills.</p>

<p>I’m a Kentucky fan and he’s the best player we’ve ever had. I don’t think it is very close.</p>

<p>To win titles, He needs a primary playmaker next to him (like Lebron or Rondo). He’s the best defender of his generation alongside Giannis. It is a total joke he hasn’t won multiple Defensive Player of the Year awards. Rudy Gobert has been played off court in numerous playoffs, that is not fathomable with Giannis or AD.</p>

<p>There is a difference between regular season and playoff defense. The NBA should create award to honor best defensive player of the playoffs. AD has at least one of those in the bubble.</p>

He was putting up cartoonish numbers during his last few years in New Orleans. I knew he was good defensively but then his offense just took off into the stratosphere.</p>

<p>He did what most people expect great players to do, which is win a championship, but I think people viewing him as the second option during that run sort of diminishes how great he was. I genuinely didn&rsquo;t know who Finals MVP would be until the last few games.</p>

That&rsquo;s not a knock on him, but he also won&rsquo;t be remembered in the same way guys like Giannis, Embiid, or [of course] Jokic will be remembered.

I don&rsquo;t mean this to come off like I&rsquo;m knocking him, he was a key factor to an NBA championship,  a perinneal All NBA caliber player etc&hellip; thats more than  90% of every NBA player ever can say. But when I look at his skillset (there&rsquo;s nothing he can&rsquo;t do) I feel he had the potential to be a top 20(?) player all time. Maybe languishing in NO for so long was a factor in this.</p>

      <label for="lo2hf30" class="commentText"><p>If you look at the decade or so of his career, the only question you can have is his health and on balance that hasn&rsquo;t been that bad as things go for a modern big man.</p>

<p>12-13- amazing rookie year undone by injuries so Lillard is rookie of the year</p>

<p>13-14- even better but again, injuries cut it short</p>

<p>14-15- still getting better and is healthy enough to take a not very good team into the playoffs where they get swept by the Warriors on their way to starting a championship run</p>

<p>15-16-Another season ending injury</p>

<p>16-17- He continues to be very good and is healthy but NO misses the playoffs, so if you want to get on him about that, this I guess is your season but his team was just not that good</p>

<p>17-18- Great season, and we get the brief time of a twin towers with him and Cousins before injuries again hit, though in a twist Davis is ok and he makes the playoffs for the second time. This time, Portland is swept out of the first round but he is again taken out by the Warriors after that.</p>

<p>18-19- Things fall apart in NO</p>

<p>After that, his Lakers history is pretty well known, so on balance, the issues has mostly been that he has been stuck on just bad teams and/or been hurt, though even a lot of those injury seasons early on I don&rsquo;t think would have made a difference in terms of going deep into the playoffs, given where his team was. All you can really get on him for, I guess, is that he wasn&rsquo;t good enough to power a bad team into the playoffs early on, but that has almost as much to do with him being in the West as anything else</p>

      <label for="lo2iel7" class="commentText"><p>He probably could have benefited from leaving NOLA sooner. He has been terribly injury prone, and is inconsistent with effort. However he has been an amazing defender, and much better offensively than most people thought he could be. Has stretches where he looks like a contender for best player in the league, but also has games where he looks very unengaged. Overall I think he definitely exceeded expectations, but with hindsight possibly did not reach his full potential.</p>

      <label for="lo4lhwu" class="commentText"><p>I think he met the expectations. The problem is the teams he has played for so far. The Pelicans were never a contender for an ring and don&rsquo;t have a big market, meanwhile the Lakers have a big market and won an championship, AD never was the franchise guy since there is LeBron.  So for me he is underviewed (not underrated or underappreciated).</p>

      <label for="lo4xt82" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m going to break down my response into talking about AD on the Pelicans and AD on the Lakers separately.</p>

<p>On the Pelicans, AD definitely lived up to the hype in terms of individual talent. He was a dominant force on both ends of the floor and consistently put up impressive numbers. But the lack of playoff success and the team&rsquo;s inability to surround him with the right talent held him back from truly being the face of the franchise in a way that matched his potential. The injuries also effected his ability to fully showcase his skills during clutch moments. Hard to think of a less clutch player (even now tbh)</p>

<p>When he got on the Lakers, AD finally got the platform to shine on a bigger stage, and man delivered with a championship in 2020. IMO this was crucial for his legacy. He proved he could be the number two on a title-winning team. His contributions in the playoffs were stellar, especially defensively, which reaffirmed the expectations set during his college days.</p>

<p>So, while his career has been a mixed bag overall, when he’s healthy and engaged, he’s shown he can be among the best. Top five in any given year? No, but that&rsquo;s not necessary IMO for his legacy. Overall, I’d say he met the expectations in terms of talent but fell short of being consistently seen as a top-tier player bc of injuries and team dynamics.</p>

He&rsquo;s not Tim Duncan but he&rsquo;s still a hall of famer and top 75 player. He turned out like a #1 pick should but no better. Guys like Lebron and Wemby come along once every 20 years.</p>

<p>I also think he was hurt playing in NOLA for a while, people just don&rsquo;t watch us and we had some really bad injury luck here. If Boogie just made that damn free throw and didn&rsquo;t get hurt who know how that season goes. They were really finding their stride at that point. I also don&rsquo;t think those NOLA teams were as bad as people remember, we had some bad injury luck, but those teams were competitive and if AD and co had been healthy a little more, I think they win more than just the one playoff series in his time here.</p>

<p>Either way, AD is an amazing player. It&rsquo;s a shame he threw any goodwill from New Orleans out the window on his way out, because he should be much more celebrated by the organization and the fan base here than he is and will be.</p>

He’s probably one of the 10 best number 1 picks ever, although Edwards and Wemby could bump him down on those lists potentially. That’s absolutely not a given though.</p>

I don’t personally see him accomplishing any of that, so no, I don’t think he’s met the hype.</p>

<p>Edit: he did make the NBA 75. So I’m sure there will be people who quibble about his “all-time great” status. That’s fine. To me “all-time great” status is reserved for 30 or so dudes in the modern nba, and he doesn’t make that cut for me 🤷🏼‍♂️</p>

      <label for="lo3xu8o" class="commentText"><p>I think people forget how good New Orleans AD was. He moved so smooth and was so fast and agile. Also, oddly his jumper was butter and he was automatic. Truly automatic. Was criminal not to pair him with a good other superstar at that time. Yes he couldn’t stay healthy often but he was really the goods.</p>

<p>What he is now is way different. It’s normal. It’s understandable.</p>

<p>A young AD with say Dame Lillard would have been a nightmare.</p>

      <label for="lo459q8" class="commentText"><p>I think any time you have a guy that is a perennial all-star and Hall of Famer, it&rsquo;s hard to argue that they didn&rsquo;t deserve the hype.</p>

<p>I would argue that his biggest issue he had was that he was too good early in his career. People thought that he was going to be like a top 10 player of all time after his first couple seasons.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s put it this way, if you took every #1 pick from 2000-2020 and put them in a draft, knowing what we know now about their NBA careers, he probably goes 2nd or 3rd behind LeBron, and maybe Anthony Edwards.</p>

<p>But based on early play in New Orleans?</p>

<p>I give it a <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> based on if we ran his career 10 times.</p>

<p>50% of the time his career would have been better.  50% of the time worse.</p>

<p>He has some monster seasons and a ring.  Impact player on both sides of the ball.</p>

<p>But two years ago though a lot of people had given up on him as a top tier player.  His shot disappeared, always injured and in questionable shape.</p>

<p>He was terrific last year and back as a top 10 player.</p>

      <label for="lo4c1vd" class="commentText"><p>At the end of the 2015 season, Alvin Gentry resigned as Steve Kerr&rsquo;s top assistant to take the reins of the Pelicans, boldly declaring that he was going to coach the best player in the league not named LeBron James, I found that a bit out of line, given he had just spent a year coaching Steph Curry - in his 1st MVP season, no less.</p>

<p>At different periods during LeBron&rsquo;s tenure in the Lakers, he&rsquo;s expressed a desire to take a second seat to AD, anointing him as the future leader on the squad.</p>

<p>Well, Gentry was wrong. Curry won his 2nd MVP in the 15-16 season, while LeBron took Finals MVP. Likewise, while AD has been the Lakers&rsquo; best player at times, it remains &lsquo;Bron&rsquo;s team - and he was once again FMVP in the (Bubble) Laker&rsquo;s lone championship season since he joined them.</p>

<p>So AD&rsquo;s had a great career and he&rsquo;s been a fantastic player.</p>

<p>Just never one who lead a team to a championship or collects those &lsquo;best of the best&rsquo; individual accolades.</p>

<p>So maybe he&rsquo;s performed a bit under the rather heavy expectations placed on him.</p>

<p>But I doubt he&rsquo;s going to be unhappy with his career.</p>

      <label for="lo4envg" class="commentText"><p>I’d say Davis has certainly hit expectations of him when he was drafted but hasn’t exactly transcended them. He’s a perennial All-Star and is (or at least was) always included in the Top 10 best NBA players conversation. But with no MVPs and being co-star to LeBron’s leading man in an underwhelming Bubble Finals, he’s still a cut below the top tiers of greatest PFs ever for me (Tier 1: Duncan, Tier 2: KG, Dirk, &amp; Giannis, Tier 3: Utah 32, Barkley, Tier 4: AD &amp; Bob Petit)</p>

<p>But AD still has time, though. 32 is new 27 for many of the league’s top players so he still has time to finish his career strong.</p>

With Giannis, Embiid, Kat,  joker, bam people often forget about ad. Dude plays D, strong enough to bang it out with old dudes like cousins (insert Kat face) back then, has enough finesse and speed for new dudes,  rebounds, outlets, full court outlets, can bring ball down better than those 4. can pass, can pnr, can run O, got 3. got middy, got post off both hand off both blocks, and most of all unlike the 5 mentioned up there, dude got the dog. you can count on him downthe stretch, make a stop at the last second VS anyone (insert gobertand embiitch face)   or even let it fly at the final second from 3 in playoff game, and unlike Kat and embiitch he doesnt randomly forget how to do his job as a big after taking a fee miiddies and 3s.</p>

<p>Also best eyebrow in the game for the last decade and some change, bar none. Adbrow <strong>&amp;gt;</strong> Lebron&rsquo;s 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th set of hair. not 3rd or 6th though, they kinda fire.</p>

Great offense, 2 way star, winner.</p>

      <label for="lo5u3oc" class="commentText"><p>So&hellip; as someone that was wrong, on this subreddit at the time, under a different name:</p>

<p>I think he met the hype.  Everyone makes the same mistake with players that they make with stocks, the make the assumption that the folks highest on a player is the voice of his hype.  Not everyone was sold on AD in the NBA</p>

<p>My REASONABLE take of Anthony Davis was based around three key areas:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Durability at his size</p></li>

<li><p>Occupying the paint</p></li>

<li><p>Contributing on a offense</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So here is how I was wrong:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Anthony Davis has had an long injury history, but about average into todays game.  He has contributed in post season success and played a reasonable amount of games.</p></li>

<li><p>The game has changed since he was drafted.  Davis&rsquo;s ability to switch, and cover a huge area on space to challenge shots has been incredible.  In a funny want Davis&rsquo;s careers in this regard has mimicked Tim Duncan- The best player in the league defensively for his time in the NBA, but never winning a DPOY.</p></li>

<li><p>Look, this was my biggest issue with Davis.  Cool, coming out of a Kentucky, could he be Tyson Chandler?  Sure, but Pick and Roll finishers are no super impactful offensively, despite their individual statistics.  His ability to hit jump shots was AT BEST unproven, and at worst (with his low 70% FT shooting) not likely.  He developed into a GREAT mid range jump shooter, that completely complemented his ability to put the ball on the floor and he is STILL an elite PnR target.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Look Anthony has had better durability than feared, defense in the modern NBA has moved to make his impact more important and he has developed the key offensive tools to make him impactful on that in.  He has deliver, maybe not over delivered, but he has delivered.</p>

      <label for="lo5vyd6" class="commentText"><p>Did he meet or exceed expectations? Absolutely.</p>

<p>Is there an alternative universe where he retires a top 15 player of all time? IMO yes. That&rsquo;s what the essential frustration with AD is. He&rsquo;s been great but I don&rsquo;t think he hit his ceiling except for during the 2020 playoffs. He is still one of the greatest defenders ever, period.</p>

      <label for="lo62f9x" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m a broken record here, but I don&rsquo;t accept the idea that until Wemby, AD was the best prospect since Lebron.</p>

<p>The guy who had a claim to being the best 19-year-old basketball player ever, and who was indisputably the most accomplished and proven productive 19-year-old draftee ever, was the best prospect since Lebron until Wemby. Even if a lot of people didn&rsquo;t see it that way.</p>
