      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1flekje/knowing_how_immensely_hyped_anthony_davis_was_at/"><p>Knowing how immensely hyped Anthony Davis was at Kentucky, and looking back at his career now that he&rsquo;s nearing the end of his prime, do you think he met the expectations that were placed on him?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>AD was seen as a generational prospect, one of the best defensive prospects ever. Before Wemby, AD was the best prospect post LeBron. There was once a time 6-7 years ago when we were still debating if we would rather build around AD, Embiid or Giannis. Obviously those latter two guys have passed him by now.</p>

<p>In his career so far he is an NBA champion, 9x All Star, 5x All NBA including 4x First Team, and 5x All Defense. He had two top-5 MVP finishes, 5th in 2015 and 3rd in 2018. He was selected to the NBA 75 as well.</p>

<p>AD was probably a top 5 player at one point, or pretty close to it. But for most of his prime it always felt like he was hovering around that end of the top 10 range around 9th-10th and never truly cracked the top end &ldquo;best player in the league&rdquo; tier.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s turning 32 this season so it&rsquo;s likely that his prime is pretty close to ending so I think we can have a bit of a &ldquo;retrospective&rdquo; on his career atp. Do you think he met the expectations of being a generational superstar?</p>

      <label for="lo2b4ej" class="commentText"><p>I think AD met the hype, was stuck in purgatory for a while early in his career. His health has always been a factor but he is undoubtedly a top player in the league when he is on the floor.</p>

<p>He was a defensive anchor coming out of college, all of his offensive output probably exceeded expectations early.</p>

      <label for="lo2bway" class="commentText"><p>In terms of a personal perspective he’s achieved everything expected of him and more (other than DPOY but if I speak I am in big trouble)</p>

<p>Maybe people expected more than 1 ring as more than an elite second option but it’s hard to pit him as anything other than an absolute success, even with injury</p>
