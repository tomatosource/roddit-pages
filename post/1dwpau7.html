      <label for="lbw7r9k" class="commentText"><p>Fair, but on a broken fast break. I wonder how fast Edey can get back into the offense. He just wasn’t asked to do that at Purdue, because he didn’t need to. But, I think he has the endurance. He played essentially every minute in March Madness games. His motor is unreal.</p>

      <label for="lbw8huw" class="commentText"><p>Yeah across the season for Purdue, he played <sup>32</sup>&frasl;<sub>40</sub> minutes. If you translated that rate into 48 minute games, he&rsquo;d be playing 38.4 minutes per game, more than any player since Jimmy Butler under Thibs in 2014-15. The real question for his NBA future will be if he can convert some of that endurance into higher level play over a shorter period of time. If he was holding back at Purdue to improve his endurance, he could be really good in the league.</p>

<p>On offense Ja is a one man fast break, and in their half court offense sets he&rsquo;s there to box out and collect offensive rebounds similar to what Adams did. Maybe get some post touches on a mismatch here and there, but his job on the offensive will be easy.</p>

<p>It’ll be tough at first, but I have faith he will be there on defense in a season or two.</p>

<p>A lot of emphasis on playing fast, with lots of hand-offs, Spain pick and roll, and very intense play style. It&rsquo;s a bummer that he&rsquo;s leaving because I just got season tickets to watch them this season, but you can&rsquo;t refuse an opportunity like this as a coach. Wish him the best of luck, I&rsquo;m pretty confident he&rsquo;s gonna be very good.</p>

Outside of Bane, how many players in their main rotation shoot above 33% from 3 on good volume? Is it just Jackson, Williams, and Aidama?</p>

<p>So 4 guys out of the 9-man rotation? Which means you are always playing with 2-3 non-shooters in the modern NBA.</p>

      <label for="lbw6f8s" class="commentText"><p>it&rsquo;s not, but I do think when the game grinds to a halt, you really want the spacing in order to create good looks in the half-court. I think that there are a bunch of other ways to get efficient looks, but those looks are easier to come by the more space you have to work with. When you have 2 non-shooters out there, space becomes a lot harder to come by.</p>

      <label for="lbwi9qo" class="commentText"><p>I think when people think of spacing, they think floor spacer, and that meta is limited; spacing can be generate 4 different ways.</p>

<p>Spacing from shooters spreading the floor (Bane, Kennard, Jaren, Vince, GG, Santi)</p>

<p>Lineal spacing through hard screen (BC, Edey)</p>

<p>Vertical spacing through lobs (BC, Edey, Jaren, Ja)</p>

<p>Gravitational pull requiring double (Ja, Edey)</p>

<p>I think only Marcus in the top 10 doesn&rsquo;t full fill in any of the 4, but he does other invaluable connecting tissue type of work.</p>

<p>I am glad our team is committed to innovative ways to run the offense. If we simply believe more shooting is the way to go, we would have got a shooting coach, not this guy.</p>

<p>Plus we got two pure spot shooters out of the 2nd round, I really like them both. The Ja/Edey pick &amp; roll will generate tons of corner 3s, they would barely need to relocation dribble.</p>

      <label for="lbwjsg5" class="commentText"><p>Yea, but there&rsquo;s a difference between creating space and punishing a defense for the space created.</p>

<p>If a defense packs the paint, vertical, lineal, and gravitational spacing is harder to create. At that point, the space is on the perimeter where the Grizz will seemingly struggle to punish.</p>

      <label for="lbwnpgb" class="commentText"><p>There is a limitation of how much one team can pack a paint. Like how many bigs can you realistically put on the court to pack it?</p>

<p>If you have two bigs in the paint, which is quite normal, and even Ja and Adam screen and roll had no issue dealing with this. One hard screen, Ja is at the rim with his elite finishing again one remaining big, which typically result in a bucket or a foul or an offensive rebounds. This had proven to work, and Adam is not the finisher or lob catcher Edey is.</p>

<p>Or, one team can have 3 players with size packing the paint? Well it is not like we don&rsquo;t have shooters. We have some of the best shooters out there, Kennard can&rsquo;t be played as much because he hesitates to let it go when players with length can play him relatively close and get to his 3s, and he is not the secondary play maker Bane is. Well, what happens now the long long man now is packing the paint? Now we can play otherwise unplayable one dimensional shooter like Kennard, Wells, and Cam Spencer. NBA players are just too good if you leave 3 guys in the paint, then everyone looks like Steph.</p>

<p>How about packing the paint with smaller players and let the long guys keeping the shooter and Ja in check on the perimeter. The Wolves did that, Ja was limited in that series in scoring, but vertical spacing opened up and BC killed them. Good luck trying to keep BC Jaren GG Edey off the offensive board. People forget what a monstrous offensive rebounding team we were. That was a big part of our identity. We would have beaten the Lakers handily if BC/Adam would have been available. You pack the paint with none bigs, we will send in the goons and play beat&rsquo;em up.</p>

<p>And the coordinate these counters to double counters is like doing jiu-jitsu, one has to problem solve in real time and under pressure, which is why I think this coach is brought in.</p>

      <label for="lbwp5jo" class="commentText"><p>I think as long as the 2 guys that aren&rsquo;t floor spacers are a big and Ja, then you are probably fine&hellip;as long as the ball is in Ja&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>If Ja is on the bench or if Ja is off-ball, then I think you can only really afford 1 non-shooter.</p>

<p>I also have my doubts that Edey will be the monster that Adams was on the offensive boards. Part of why things worked so well was because Adams was just an absolute beast at grabbing ORebs.</p>

<p>Edey certainly has the potential, but a lot is riding on it actually happening.</p>

      <label for="lbwqmmj" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I agree with that, if Edey is on the floor with Ja, the only thing he should do is set that high screen and roll hard to the rim or short roll to 5 ft in. There shall be no post up run for him. We run that until teams adjust.</p>

<p>If Ja is not on the floor, we do need like 3.5 shooters. Marcus is probably ok with one big I think/hope. He just didn&rsquo;t play enough last year for me to judge. 2 non shooter without Ja playing, we will be fucked in spacing.</p>

<p>And we can run post up for Edey for short bursts if we have: Smart Bane Vince Jaren Edey on the floor against 2nd units.</p>

<p>I think Adam is the rebounder he is partly due to playing with Russ/Ja, PG who put tremendous pressure at the rim, clean up is easy. He was considered washed with the PELs years ago, because they have not figured out the Point Zion thing yet.</p>

<p>Edey can bust, but I am of the opinion he landed in the pretty much the perfect spot for him, and I have faith in his motor and character.</p>

<p>We shall see : ) And I appreciate the chat on this fine Saturday morning.</p>

      <label for="lbw4mia" class="commentText"><p>Kennard is a 45% shooter, I’m expecting them to resign him soon, but yea Grizz 3 point shooting isn’t the best although they did just draft two 43% 3 point shooters in Jaylen Wells and Cam Spencer so I’m expecting one of them to step and fill that role as well.</p>
