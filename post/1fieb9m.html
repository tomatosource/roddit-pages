<p>My biggest takeaways are</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the soon to be 40 year old LeBron at 40th place. But what’s even crazier is Marvin Bagley is one spot ahead. I think it’s a safe bet to say Bagley will be out of the league before LeBron is.</p></li>

<li><p>Steph at 31, KD at 29 and D’Lo at 28. Yeah that’s a big miss. All 3 of them played for the Warriors in the calendar year 2019.</p></li>

<li><p>Ben Simmons at 9. We all know the story by now with him. One of the biggest falloffs in NBA history.</p></li>

<li><p>Kawhi at 6 and Zion at 5. I don’t doubt that they’re great impact players but they’re just too injury proned to crack the top 10 imo.</p></li>

<li><p>They got 3 of the 4 right players in the top 4. Giannis, Luka and Jokic. Depending on who you ask those are the 3 best players entering the upcoming season.</p></li>

      <label for="lngrmrg" class="commentText"><p>Defensive improvement is a hard thing to project since most rookies and second year guys aren’t great to start. Kat seemed like a pretty light on his feet 7 footer at 20 years old who would assuredly get better at defense through his 20s. Ended up not being the case, though his offense met expectations and then some. If his defense had improved as we hoped he’d be meeting all these sky high expectations.</p>

<p>Edit: and maybe he’ll find another defensive level after his relatively impressive playoff run on that end</p>

<p>His post game is just so awkward to look at and so is the rest of his offensive game tbh besides shooting.</p>

<p>His shooting is lethal, but without one of the above being elite, he can&rsquo;t get it off in ISO.</p>

<p>I think people like archetypes when it comes to offence and he doesn&rsquo;t fit anything. I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s quite working hard enough. There&rsquo;s like 4 big men I trust in the post. Face up game is lot more &ldquo;artistic&rdquo; I guess?</p>

<p>Its like he is a shooting guard in a centers body playing the power foeward position.</p>

<p>I think the 4 suits him and hed be an excelent 3rd option on a team as he is now (probably what would be best for him due to his skillset), but dam he seems to just have so much potential.</p>

<p>He has great size and is actually athletic all things considered. But his game is stagnant to the point where he rarely actually has a great game where he seems like he lived up to expectations.</p>

      <label for="lngwd8a" class="commentText"><p>Ya his profile is much better suited to his current role of secondary scorer to Ant though the fits not perfect still. He’s gone away from post ups over the years but he still can be effective from there by the numbers. 1.07 Pts/poss in reg season and 1.13 in postseason last season. Works out to 8th and 4th among people who did it twice a game or more. It was interesting to see it become a security blanket for us in playoffs when teams tried to go too small against him.</p>

<p>For reference, back in 16-17 he was 4th in post ups per game in NBA and had 4th best pts/poss doing it.</p>

      <label for="lnh12k7" class="commentText"><p>Fully agree. To me it just screams that he doesn’t really work on his game tbh, might just go through the motions or work exclusively on his 3pt shooting which we can all admit is amazing for a player his size, no surprise he prides himself as the goat big man shooter (he might rly end up there). IMO the reason his post game isn’t better is honestly cause I think he has pretty shit strength in his legs - I mean look at them, they’re twigs. So he gets pushed around easily by players similar in size, and he also can’t rly push back. Also doesn’t have the greatest footwork, it’s sloppy. So you see him always flopping around crying for fouls to make up for it. Never mind his bbiq either, that’s a different conversation.</p>

<p>That’s my theory anyway</p>

A lot of things could be keeping him from doing it, lack of foot speed/coordination, growing injury history, bball IQ, etc). Fans don’t know anything about this stuff.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>never implied i expected him to be a perennial mvp candidate, but let&rsquo;s be real he hasn&rsquo;t really met expectations. Wolves are only experiencing a resurgence now cause Ant&rsquo;s on the rise, KAT was expected to be the franchise player all these years and has not lived up to it whatsoever.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s still an effective big that provides elite shooting, but at this point he needs to focus on becoming the best #2 option cause he&rsquo;s no longer the franchise</p>

<p>I guess his footwork is just universally bad. He&rsquo;s a very janky player.</p>

<p>Imagine if he had a Wemby step back?</p>

This year it was less frequent and less effective but you could make the case that has a lot to do with having two bigs and a rising Ant out there.</p>

      <label for="lnhbqb4" class="commentText"><p>i think his face up game is ok, i&rsquo;m not gonna lie i don&rsquo;t watch the wolves that much so i&rsquo;m only speaking based off the random times i&rsquo;d watch them over the years for KAT since coming into the league(esp since KAT was more hyped earlier on). I just think his post up game is the weakest part of his game, and as a big that has no post up game, esp considering he&rsquo;s one of if not the biggest guy on the court, that&rsquo;s not a good thing. Idc what people say but as a big, you 1) need to know how to use your size and 2) need a go-to move in the post if your jumper&rsquo;s not falling</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t expect a much better one for a prediction of that magnitude.</p>

<p>Many of the failed ones were either super young players (Marvin just had a solid Arookie team) or injuries (Simmons).</p>

<p>Also, most wouldn&rsquo;t have imagined Lebron being that great at almost 40.</p>

<p>People complain a lot about the top 50 ranking for current players. Imagine predictions of it in 5 years.</p>

      <label for="lnhvfc8" class="commentText"><p>It’s because things we were taught were either straight up lies or not based in science. Like you can’t jump higher or be fast, you either have it or you don’t. There’s also much more science that shows the important of rest and recovery where before they thought you’d have to prove you’re tough by playing through pain until your body is broken. And straight up a lot of them didn’t train and get more skilled. We’ve seen Lebron be criticized for not being able to shoot and he would have to transition to a post player eventually and now he regularly shoots logo threes</p>

Personally, I would place him somewhere between 15-25. Still an elite playmaker who’s lost a pretty big scoring step, but is overall a very serviceable point guard.</p>

<p>Not quite an all star, but if he made the team (assuming health) it wouldn’t be a huge stretch considering he would probably average <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> on good efficiency every night, and also contribute to wins pretty heavily.</p>

<p><strong>23. Kyrie Irving (Age in 2024: 32)</strong><br>
Brooklyn will help shape Irving’s legacy — he goes to a playoff team with a strong established culture through coach Kenny Atkinson, an organization with good young players already seen on this list in Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert. In a year, once healthy, Kevin Durant will join them and form a squad that should be a title contender in the East. The questions abound: How does Irving fit in? How does his game evolve? His leadership skills? <em>(Kurt Helin)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Holy shit. I remember those days. We were riding high on the waves of our underdog, immaculate vibes team. We signed Kyrie and Durant to finally push us over the edge. The future looked bright. It only took Irving and Durant two season to get coach Kenny fired, Caris and Jarrett shipped, Nash hired as the &ldquo;head coach&rdquo; and our future leveraged to trade for Harden.</p>

      <label for="lnht0a3" class="commentText"><p>You didn&rsquo;t think the greatest shooter of all time wouldn&rsquo;t still be good at 35? Steph is a perpetual motion shooter with an INSANE basketball IQ; so long as he keeps his conditioning up, and he doesn&rsquo;t blow out a ligament/tendon, dude could be a contributor and team leader well into his 40s. Like, &ldquo;perennial 6MOY contender, drops 20+ and 6 assists per game off the bench because they limit his minutes to protect his health&rdquo; good. Shooters don&rsquo;t just stop being able to shoot; something else slows them down. If he doesn&rsquo;t get catastrophically injured, and IF he wants to keep going, Steph could play another decade. Whether or not he wants to is the question.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll give you LeBron- not &ldquo;barely cracks the Top50&rdquo; LeBron, but &ldquo;no longer Top10&rdquo; LeBron, but Kareem was still VERY effective into his late 30s and early 40s, and he chose to retire.</p>

<p>Give LeBron the prep, therapy and S&amp;C that Kareem never had, and LeBron being a 20 PPG/5 REB/5 AST player into his 40s was always a real possibility, but only if he wanted to keep playing. The fact that he&rsquo;s at 25/7/8 is surprising, but not THAT surprising. If the Lakers actually bgive him a team and limit his minutes and workload, he could play to 45 and still be effective.</p>

<p>KD I&rsquo;ll give you, because he&rsquo;s basically missed the better part of four seasons, and while the talent is still undeniably there, I thought his body was done.</p>
