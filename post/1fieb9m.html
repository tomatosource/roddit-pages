<p>My biggest takeaways are</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the soon to be 40 year old LeBron at 40th place. But what’s even crazier is Marvin Bagley is one spot ahead. I think it’s a safe bet to say Bagley will be out of the league before LeBron is.</p></li>

<li><p>Steph at 31, KD at 29 and D’Lo at 28. Yeah that’s a big miss. All 3 of them played for the Warriors in the calendar year 2019.</p></li>

<li><p>Ben Simmons at 9. We all know the story by now with him. One of the biggest falloffs in NBA history.</p></li>

<li><p>Kawhi at 6 and Zion at 5. I don’t doubt that they’re great impact players but they’re just too injury proned to crack the top 10 imo.</p></li>

<li><p>They got 3 of the 4 right players in the top 4. Giannis, Luka and Jokic. Depending on who you ask those are the 3 best players entering the upcoming season.</p></li>
</ul>

      <label for="lngrmrg" class="commentText"><p>Defensive improvement is a hard thing to project since most rookies and second year guys aren’t great to start. Kat seemed like a pretty light on his feet 7 footer at 20 years old who would assuredly get better at defense through his 20s. Ended up not being the case, though his offense met expectations and then some. If his defense had improved as we hoped he’d be meeting all these sky high expectations.</p>

<p>Edit: and maybe he’ll find another defensive level after his relatively impressive playoff run on that end</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t think of him as a post player, or a faceup attack player either.</p>

<p>No shot creation from the 3 point line either.</p>

<p>His post game is just so awkward to look at and so is the rest of his offensive game tbh besides shooting.</p>

<p>That said he often shows flashes of potential, which kinda makes me feel like he doesnt work enough on his game.</p>

<p>His shooting is lethal, but without one of the above being elite, he can&rsquo;t get it off in ISO.</p>

<p>I think people like archetypes when it comes to offence and he doesn&rsquo;t fit anything. I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s quite working hard enough. There&rsquo;s like 4 big men I trust in the post. Face up game is lot more &ldquo;artistic&rdquo; I guess?</p>

<p>Its like he is a shooting guard in a centers body playing the power foeward position.</p>

<p>I think the 4 suits him and hed be an excelent 3rd option on a team as he is now (probably what would be best for him due to his skillset), but dam he seems to just have so much potential.</p>

<p>He has great size and is actually athletic all things considered. But his game is stagnant to the point where he rarely actually has a great game where he seems like he lived up to expectations.</p>

      <label for="lninrpf" class="commentText"><p>He has averaged 25+ twice in his carrier and hasnt averaged 10 rebounds for the last 3 seasons.</p>

<p>But of course he does have 3 seasons with 24+ ppg.</p>

<p>Yet for the last 2 seasons he has averaged under 22 ppg and for carrier he is a 23 ppg guy.</p>

<p>But thas not important here. What is important is the context as to why we are talking about him like that.</p>

<p>Mans the 1st pick that came in and averaged 18 in his 1st season and 25 in his 2nd. GMs thought he was gonna be so much more and he ended up just being a mediocre 1st option and now a 2nd option.</p>

<p>Like you said, the dude is a 50/40/80 guy and because of that he had so much more potential, that never became realised.</p>

<p>Its weird to talk about him like he is Christian wood for sure, but at worst the dude should have been like AD, but instead he is a glorified shooting big that cant play like a big on offense.</p>

      <label for="lngwd8a" class="commentText"><p>Ya his profile is much better suited to his current role of secondary scorer to Ant though the fits not perfect still. He’s gone away from post ups over the years but he still can be effective from there by the numbers. 1.07 Pts/poss in reg season and 1.13 in postseason last season. Works out to 8th and 4th among people who did it twice a game or more. It was interesting to see it become a security blanket for us in playoffs when teams tried to go too small against him.</p>

<p>For reference, back in 16-17 he was 4th in post ups per game in NBA and had 4th best pts/poss doing it.</p>

      <label for="lnih7fn" class="commentText"><p>By his age most players are who they are, but KAT had such an atrocious start in terms of coaching/vibes/supporting cast I can see him continuing to develop as he gets older. Probably not to the same level he would have if he had that support from day one, but it’s only the least few seasons where he’s had consistency and quality around him from the FO down through the coaches and team. In general, I think the starting environment is still underrated when it comes to rookie development.</p>

      <label for="lnh12k7" class="commentText"><p>Fully agree. To me it just screams that he doesn’t really work on his game tbh, might just go through the motions or work exclusively on his 3pt shooting which we can all admit is amazing for a player his size, no surprise he prides himself as the goat big man shooter (he might rly end up there). IMO the reason his post game isn’t better is honestly cause I think he has pretty shit strength in his legs - I mean look at them, they’re twigs. So he gets pushed around easily by players similar in size, and he also can’t rly push back. Also doesn’t have the greatest footwork, it’s sloppy. So you see him always flopping around crying for fouls to make up for it. Never mind his bbiq either, that’s a different conversation.</p>

<p>That’s my theory anyway</p>

A lot of things could be keeping him from doing it, lack of foot speed/coordination, growing injury history, bball IQ, etc). Fans don’t know anything about this stuff.</p>

<p>I wish people didn’t assume lack of effort for reasons borderline all nba players don’t become mvp candidate levels</p>
</blockquote>

<p>never implied i expected him to be a perennial mvp candidate, but let&rsquo;s be real he hasn&rsquo;t really met expectations. Wolves are only experiencing a resurgence now cause Ant&rsquo;s on the rise, KAT was expected to be the franchise player all these years and has not lived up to it whatsoever.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s still an effective big that provides elite shooting, but at this point he needs to focus on becoming the best #2 option cause he&rsquo;s no longer the franchise</p>

      <label for="lnh23lz" class="commentText"><p>What do you think he lacks in the face up game? He&rsquo;s got good size, and in theory his lack of lower body strength shouldn&rsquo;t matter as much in the face up game. His jumper means he&rsquo;s a more natural face up player like Bosh.</p>

<p>I guess his footwork is just universally bad. He&rsquo;s a very janky player.</p>

<p>Imagine if he had a Wemby step back?</p>

      <label for="lnh6jpi" class="commentText"><p>I mean he had the third best points/possession in isolation in the NBA on the 21-22 team where he made 3rd team All NBA, it was never fun to watch but it was highly effective. This year it was less frequent and less effective but you could make the case that has a lot to do with having two bigs and a rising Ant out there.</p>

      <label for="lnhbqb4" class="commentText"><p>i think his face up game is ok, i&rsquo;m not gonna lie i don&rsquo;t watch the wolves that much so i&rsquo;m only speaking based off the random times i&rsquo;d watch them over the years for KAT since coming into the league(esp since KAT was more hyped earlier on). I just think his post up game is the weakest part of his game, and as a big that has no post up game, esp considering he&rsquo;s one of if not the biggest guy on the court, that&rsquo;s not a good thing. Idc what people say but as a big, you 1) need to know how to use your size and 2) need a go-to move in the post if your jumper&rsquo;s not falling</p>

I was telling anyone who would listen about him, and then a few years later he had cross my mind and I thought &ldquo;hmm that&rsquo;s weird I havent been hearing about him let&rsquo;s see what he&rsquo;s been up to&rdquo;? To my surprise&hellip;not much. It just goes to show the inherent issues that come with ranking kids so early and trying to project their futures. The way people talk about Wemby is how I thought Emoni would be, he was like 15 at the time having it said he was the next KD but a much better shooter at that age.</p>

<p>Apologies for making this  about Bron but we really take his greatness for granted because not only did he live up to the hype he exceeded it in every aspect compared to the number of other prospects who get this kind of treatment and never pan out.</p>

<p>Many of the failed ones were either super young players (Marvin just had a solid Arookie team) or injuries (Simmons).</p>

<p>Also, most wouldn&rsquo;t have imagined Lebron being that great at almost 40.</p>

<p>People complain a lot about the top 50 ranking for current players. Imagine predictions of it in 5 years.</p>

Traded a good bit to get him (so you would think they were committed to developing and building around him), then gave up on him and traded him to Cleveland for nothing, where he seemed to be proving that he just really wasn&rsquo;t that guy. Then flourishes in Utah. I don&rsquo;t know what happened, some of the blame has to go on Lauri, but what a whiff by the Bulls to dump Jimmy (who has led teams to the finals twice, and other deep playoff runs), get Lauri as the guy to build around, and now they have neither of them, with negative assets (Lavine) to show for it. Woof. Be glad you had MJ, Chi-town. It may be a while&hellip;</p>

      <label for="lnks6pq" class="commentText"><p>A lot of it was Chicago trying to bulk him up to play more at the 5 while he&rsquo;s actually just a tall 4.  Cleveland playing him at the 3 was much more successful than you&rsquo;d have expected, but he was out of position there too. Unlocking him was more about teams using him as he is rather than fitting him around other guys.</p>

<p>Putting Lauri on the wing gave him more opportunity to cut and find his outside shot more easily.  But he didn&rsquo;t have all that much room to cut in Cleveland either when starting next to Mobley and Allen.</p>

<p>Then he got to be &ldquo;the guy&rdquo; on the Finnish national team that summer and realized that he could actually do that better than he&rsquo;d gotten the chance to in the NBA.</p>

<p>Outside of Paul, Nash, Stockton and Kidd almost every point guard was washed out of the league by their early 30s until recently.</p>

<p>Iverson was out of the league by 34. West by 35. Isaiah Thomas by 32. Cousy by 34. Oscar Robertson by 35. Hardaway by 36. Walt Frazier by 34.</p>

<p>A very basic example: think about the recent switch from static stretching to dynamic stretching—it can mean the difference between jumping out the gym and a pulled hamstring. Or look at the weird ass drills steph’s trainer has him doing nowadays. Much of it is new and innovative sports science that enhance athletic performance and longevity.</p>

<p>Agreed that dudes like Klay and Kawhi are mostly beyond what sports science can address, but overall, the path to better performance that you would only expect from “anomalies” is more accessible to regular athletes. Which is a good thing imo.</p>

<p>Klay Thompson blew an ACL on one knee and an Achilles on the other, missed two and a half season, is 34 y/o and will be paid almost 50M for 3 seasons on a contender team, 20 years ago he would&rsquo;ve been living chucking threes on a corner with his name in Turkey or Greece,</p>

<p>Nagging injuries like the ones Love had from 18&rsquo; to 20&rsquo; meant he was just a worse player but still a started, in another era, centers that usually went through two seasons of constant injuries would be roster fodder at 36 playing 5 to 10 minutes on regular season, hooked on painkillers.</p>

No one was playing there in their prime past age like 32 until very recently. Brady really proved the science works. The fact that we currently have multiple stars beating Father Time tells me they aren’t anomalies. They are a product of a changed. variable. It will be much more common moving forward.

<p>No one really knows what Kawhi&rsquo;s knee issue is but he&rsquo;d have definitely retired.</p>

<p>Westbrook hasn&rsquo;t slowed down as much as the rest of the league has evolved away from him.  Shooting 2014&rsquo;s average TS% in 2024 at high volume is a huge negative now.  Not being able to hit an accurate outside shot is game-planned against.</p>

<p>Butler&rsquo;s still amazing in the playoffs.  He can&rsquo;t stay healthy in the regular season but his top-end performance is still close to his peak, unlike guys like Shawn Kemp, Vince Carter, and Chris Webber who all peaked around 30 and fell off significantly even if they kicked around the league for awhile.</p>

<p>Love has been a tough fit on defense since his mid-20s but he&rsquo;s still putting up 19 points per 36 minutes and rebounding like his prime self. He&rsquo;s another guy where the game changed around him and one of his offensive strengths in his Minnesota days (offensive rebounding) was minimized in the modern game.</p>

<p>Lowry and Paul have performed unreasonably well in their mid-to-late 30s for six-foot-tall guards. You used to be out of the league at that height as soon as you lost a half-step.</p>

<p><strong>23. Kyrie Irving (Age in 2024: 32)</strong><br>
Brooklyn will help shape Irving’s legacy — he goes to a playoff team with a strong established culture through coach Kenny Atkinson, an organization with good young players already seen on this list in Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert. In a year, once healthy, Kevin Durant will join them and form a squad that should be a title contender in the East. The questions abound: How does Irving fit in? How does his game evolve? His leadership skills? <em>(Kurt Helin)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Holy shit. I remember those days. We were riding high on the waves of our underdog, immaculate vibes team. We signed Kyrie and Durant to finally push us over the edge. The future looked bright. It only took Irving and Durant two season to get coach Kenny fired, Caris and Jarrett shipped, Nash hired as the &ldquo;head coach&rdquo; and our future leveraged to trade for Harden.</p>

<p>As well as the Sixers with Simmons, bellinelli, reddick, RoCo, illiasova, saric.</p>

<p>Both of those teams played such a refreshing brand of basketball and gave me hope that a home grown organic team without a bunch of stars could be successful in the league.</p>

<p>Then both of those franchises pivoted directly into trading their depth and chemistry for stars. Philly went for butler and Brooklyn for Kyrie. Both of those moves made me sad.</p>

<p>Both franchises would’ve been so much better off just developing those rosters for a few more years, but they got too eager.</p>

He’s very clearly not a top 10 player anymore and that 10-15 range gets really muddy, but I definitely don’t think it’s a stretch to call him top 20. Personally, I would place him somewhere between 15-25. Still an elite playmaker who’s lost a pretty big scoring step, but is overall a very serviceable point guard.</p>

<p>Not quite an all star, but if he made the team (assuming health) it wouldn’t be a huge stretch considering he would probably average <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> on good efficiency every night, and also contribute to wins pretty heavily.</p>

<p>I think it’s a safe bet to say Bagley will be out of the league before LeBron is.</p>

<p>Nitpicking but I actually think this may not be true. He&rsquo;s definitely not that good, but he looked good on the Wizards and probably gets real minutes this year, and if he shows out he could be a nice bench piece for a playoff team to convince themselves on for a low price. He&rsquo;s still a consistent double double threat</p>

<p>With how Lebron keeps teasing retirement I could see Bagley getting a few more lives in the NBA as a former #2 pick unless he leaves on his own accord</p>

He would&rsquo;ve just finished his rookie season for the Clippers with a blistering box score average of 11/3/3. He didn&rsquo;t pop off until he got to OKC.</p>

Bosh was a great all around scorer, early unicorn, good to great rebounder and decent defender while JJJ makes his name as a good to great defender with major issues of foul trouble and rebounding.</p>

      <label for="lnionrb" class="commentText"><p>As a Kings fan, I was mildly surprised to see Fox getting his due respect and being listed in the top 15. His placement is pretty accurate imo.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m actually kinda shocked Sabonis isn&rsquo;t on the list at all. His first couple years were nothing special, but this article was written right before the 19-20 season where he got his first all-star selection. In 18-19 he was a MIP candidate and came 2nd in 6moty voting. His basketball pedigree is obvious. I can&rsquo;t imagine people didn&rsquo;t have him on their radar at all at that time especially considering there are a few players on the list who were rookies and/or not even drafted yet. Now he&rsquo;s absolutely a top 20 player and, at least last year, was top 10 for All-NBA.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, Marvin Bagley lmfao. What an absolute fucking bum. I can see predicting him being decent after his rookie year, but if you watched the team closely you could already see issues and by year 3 it was obvious he would never be a good NBA player. (Would have probably been obvious in year 2 but he missed basically all of it.)</p>

      <label for="lnht0a3" class="commentText"><p>You didn&rsquo;t think the greatest shooter of all time wouldn&rsquo;t still be good at 35? Steph is a perpetual motion shooter with an INSANE basketball IQ; so long as he keeps his conditioning up, and he doesn&rsquo;t blow out a ligament/tendon, dude could be a contributor and team leader well into his 40s. Like, &ldquo;perennial 6MOY contender, drops 20+ and 6 assists per game off the bench because they limit his minutes to protect his health&rdquo; good. Shooters don&rsquo;t just stop being able to shoot; something else slows them down. If he doesn&rsquo;t get catastrophically injured, and IF he wants to keep going, Steph could play another decade. Whether or not he wants to is the question.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll give you LeBron- not &ldquo;barely cracks the Top50&rdquo; LeBron, but &ldquo;no longer Top10&rdquo; LeBron, but Kareem was still VERY effective into his late 30s and early 40s, and he chose to retire.</p>

<p>Give LeBron the prep, therapy and S&amp;C that Kareem never had, and LeBron being a 20 PPG/5 REB/5 AST player into his 40s was always a real possibility, but only if he wanted to keep playing. The fact that he&rsquo;s at 25/7/8 is surprising, but not THAT surprising. If the Lakers actually bgive him a team and limit his minutes and workload, he could play to 45 and still be effective.</p>

<p>KD I&rsquo;ll give you, because he&rsquo;s basically missed the better part of four seasons, and while the talent is still undeniably there, I thought his body was done.</p>

KG, Dirk, Kobe, Duncan, and Pau all were hitting limited usefulness at Lebron&rsquo;s current age. For Steph, I&rsquo;m surprised, but he also had all those ankle injuries early on.</p>
