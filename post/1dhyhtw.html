</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>21 year old Johnathan Kuminga had a career year for the Warriors posting 16 points on 52% from the field.</p>

<p>The 6&rsquo;8 forward is an electrifying athlete, as shown by the <a href="https://youtu.be/z_7bBL-G-J0?si=gmICt_sh8W6RBHlQ" target="_blank">thunderous dunks</a> he threw down throughout the 23-24 season. He has a combination of agility, body control, vertical, and speed that reminds one of the great athletes in the NBA today like a young LeBron or Anthony Edwards. Some players seem to have an ability to &ldquo;glide&rdquo; in the air, and Kuminga is among them. Kuminga also has a long stride to the basket, and ability to finish through defenders that can remind one at times of a smaller Giannis. His combination of all of these physical attributes makes him one of the most naturally gifted players in the NBA in a very long time.</p>

<p>Kuminga has soft touch at the rim, and uses his combination of speed, size and athleticism to often beat his defender, if not go right through them. He&rsquo;s a big time lob threat and good for some putbacks, though his rebounding is quite lacking as a whole, averaging not even a paltry 5 a game.</p>

<p>Kuminga showcase increased ability to cut off the ball, and would often get layups or dunks as a result. However, Kuminga&rsquo;s fit with the Warriors still remains questionable. Kuminga has a tendency to go into &ldquo;tunnel vision&rdquo; mode, and often stalls the ball movement of the Warriors offense. It has mostly seems an issue of how to maximize the team the way Curry likes to play and the way Kuminga likes to play at the same time.</p>

<p>Kuminga is not a great outside shooter, but he he has shown a great ability to hit mid range shots, and jumpers in the painted area, where he displays a smooth arsenal of stepbacks.</p>

<p>At his best, Kuminga already looks like an all-star level player. <a href="https://youtu.be/tad_8VVD4KI?si=LYm3yxXFTI7t4aOs" target="_blank">He had a 5 game stretch averaging 26 on  65% from the field.</a> and several other comparable stretches, but so far has struggled a bit with his consistency.</p>

<p>Keep in mind for his stats he only played 27 minutes a game. It has been a struggle to perhaps find the role Kuminga wants on the Warriors this far as well.</p>

      <label for="l90d5ih" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s a lot more of a natural scorer than Aaron Gordon. I don&rsquo;t get the comp honestly other than both being athletic dunking forwards. Gordon is a more defensive and rebounding focused player. Kuminga is way more comfortable attacking ball in hand. He also just has a different type of athleticism than Gordon, he&rsquo;s so shifty and agile for his size.</p>

      <label for="l90qpke" class="commentText"><p>I think Kuminga is clearly the superior scorer.</p>

<p>At age 21, Gordon averaged 22 points per 100 possessions on 53% TS. At age 22, he had his highest volume offensive season ever, with 26 point per 100 at 53% TS.</p>

<p>At age 21, Kuminga scored 30 point per 100 possessions on 60% TS.</p>

<p>I think the comp is useful to discuss the style Gordon played when he was young and how he flourished as he got stronger and narrowed his focus to be extremely valuable to a championship team, but I think it&rsquo;s also very true that Kuminga&rsquo;s speed and ability to get into the lane is on a whole other level to even young athletic Aaron Gordon.</p>

      <label for="l90y4i6" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m the one who&rsquo;s biased here.</p>

<p>Kuminga has a lot of faults and his offensive game is, at best, two-dimensional. Even yet, here&rsquo;s the per 36 scoring average rankings from this past season:</p>

<p><em>32. RJ Barrett (22.9)</em></p>

<p><em>33. DeMar DeRozan (22.8)</em></p>

<p><em>34. Brandon Ingram (22.8)</em></p>

<p><em>35. Myles Turner (22.8)</em></p>

<p><em>36. Dejounte Murray (22.7)</em></p>

<p><em>37. Tyrese Haliburton (22.5)</em></p>

<p><em>38. Jalen Green (22.3)</em></p>

<p><em>39. Mo Wagner (22.1)</em></p>

<p><em>40. Jimmy Butler (22)</em></p>

<p><em>41. CJ McCollum (22)</em></p>

<p><strong>42. Jonathan Kuminga (21.9)</strong></p>

<p><em>43. Franz Wager (21.9)</em></p>

<p><em>44. Jalen Williams  (21.9)</em></p>

<p><em>45. Klay Thompson (21.7)</em></p>

<p><em>46. Malik Monk (21.3)</em></p>

<p><em>47. Terry Rozier (21.3)</em></p>

<p><em>48. Devin Vassell (21.2)</em></p>

<p><em>49. Immanuel Quickley (21)</em></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s <em>a lot</em> of professional scorers that he&rsquo;s keeping pace with. I don&rsquo;t tend to use age as a defense for guys either, but it should be noted that Kuminga is also the youngest guy on this list. He&rsquo;s 8 months younger than Jalen Green and 1.5 years younger than J-Dub.</p>

      </div>
      <label for="l909nvy" class="commentText"><p>there was a discussion on this in r/nbadiscussion earlier this week, this is what I posted there:</p>

<p>this year was pretty instructive for Kuminga. from the point Draymond came back to the team (Jan 15th) and they implemented the Green/Kuminga/Wiggins frontcourt until Kuminga went down in an injury (Mar 26th), he averaged 19.7ppg on .601 TS% with a 25.5% usage rate.</p>

<p>Klay was mostly coming off the bench during this time, so Kuminga was the clear #2 option on offense behind Curry and he saw more defensive attention than he had ever had before. Even with a loose handle, if he can catch it with any type of open lane, he&rsquo;s very good at the rim (he&rsquo;s an underrated finisher and finishes very well with his off hand). After a few weeks, a lot of teams opted to put their center on him (often with their feet in the paint even when he&rsquo;s catching the ball on the perimeter) and were quick to pull in the strongside corner defender to build a little wall against his drives, which dared him to make plays out of his drives. He made a few good passes in these instances, but overall his playmaking vision leaves a lot to be desired. His internal passing is pretty nice, but his ability to drive and have a plan B &amp; C based on how the defense reacts isn&rsquo;t there at all and that severely limits the upside of his best skill (getting to the basket), because defenses have to make one adjustment, rather than being forced to make two or three adjustments. He was still effective offensively against these mini-walls at times, because often he could beat the center before real help could rotate down (he absolutely destroyed Brook Lopez in this deep drop scheme and gave Poeltl a ton of problems too). Sometimes he&rsquo;d hit the wall and have to stop and the offense would have to reset (often with a short shot clock).</p>

<p>In some ways the &lsquo;budget Giannis&rsquo; comp is helpful, because it basically asks &lsquo;what if Giannis was 4&rdquo; shorter without an enormous wingspan and without an incredible motor on both sides of the ball&rsquo; and it turns out he wouldn&rsquo;t be nearly as good. When he doesn&rsquo;t have a runway to the basket (if the defender moves his feet or the defense rotates in time) he does rely on defensive fouls to bail him out sometimes, so if the whistle doesn&rsquo;t come his offense can fall off a cliff. If Kuminga doesn&rsquo;t develop more ability to create off the dribble and more ability to pass out of his drives (creating space for the next action on offense), his offensive upside will be limited to a play finisher. And all that is prior to figuring out what his outside shot is ultimately worth (I tend to think he&rsquo;ll never be more than a slightly below average outside shooter with a slow release).</p>

<p>The real thing to look at is his defense. His offense is plenty good enough to provide value on the court, even with all of the downsides I listed, but his defensive attention and effort can go from looking like the best perimeter defender on the team (rarely) to &lsquo;what the fuck is he doing out there!?&rsquo; (more common). He has shown flashes as a POA defender that look incredible, but he showed way less of them this past season than he had in his first two. I think it&rsquo;s common for a young guy who&rsquo;s finally doing more on offense to slack on his defense, but that&rsquo;s really his path to being a great NBA player. If he can be a consistent defensive presence, he&rsquo;ll be a good #3 on an NBA team no problem.</p>

<p>Ultimately the way I think about Kuminga is that he has one possibly elite NBA skill and it&rsquo;s maybe the most valuable one in the entire sport, which is that he can get to the basket. I think it&rsquo;s probably fair to say that every single other facet of his game is, at best, average (and some of it is below average). Now, he showed some major growth this past season, but he also fell back into bad habits that have been frustrating to watch his whole professional career.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s likely that he takes some of his below average skills (ball-handling, outside shooting) and turns them into plus skills. Maybe he does, but it&rsquo;s not a good bet to bank on that happening in the next couple seasons. More helpful would be him doubling down on three things: (1) decision-making on when to drive, (2) passing out of those drives when the defense reacts, (3) defense. If he is able to do those three things consistently at the level that we&rsquo;ve occasionally seen him do them, we&rsquo;re talking about an extremely valuable NBA player, but just probably a borderline All-Star kind of guy.</p>

<p>I think some people look at Kerr&rsquo;s vision for the guy which has basically been &ldquo;he can be Shawn Marion&rdquo; and they feel frustrated because what the Warriors really need is him to become Paul George. But I don&rsquo;t think he can become Paul George. I&rsquo;m not even sure he can become Marion, but that path feels so much more attainable.</p>

<p>It’s all about mentality though.  If he listens and continues working on his game, he’ll shine in this 5 out type of basketball played in today’s game.</p>

<p>The hard part for the warriors is that Kuminga won’t reach his peak in Currys timeline.</p>

<p>That is the catch.</p>

      <label for="l90eqan" class="commentText"><p>Their games are too similar (Wiggs and JK). Both are athletic wings who thrive in a stretch role where they can post up smaller guys in iso and play mostly off-ball. Both are not great shooters outside of open looks. So when you have them both out there you really need everyone else to be good shooters too.</p>

JOHNathan is such a common mispelling worst than Jalen. It&rsquo;s infuriating how many people keep making this mistake. At least make an effort to look at a NBA athlete&rsquo;s name before making a post about him.</p>

      <label for="l908n7p" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s a fairly divisive player on the fanbase because he overlaps position-wise with Draymond unless Draymond plays at the 5 and is probably the best trade piece this team has had in a long while. I&rsquo;d like to see the offense revolve around his post-ups more often because he truly is an exceptional post-up player.</p>

<p>Ideally he develops into a 3 but that&rsquo;s a huge challenge especially given the lack of frontcourt spacing on the Warriors. His shooting is very raw despite good numbers as a corner shooter but his free throws have improved substantially which is probably the most surprising part of his game.</p>

<p>I think his potential is anywhere between Jaylen Brown and Aaron Gordon, said this about 5 months ago and it hasn&rsquo;t changed. The biggest make or break of his potential is very likely his handles.</p>

<p>Also JB and Kuminga play completely different positions anyway.</p>
