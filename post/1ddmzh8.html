      <label for="l87e5h3" class="commentText"><p>Yeah. He was one of the best scorers I’ve ever seen play and I hate how the media decided to paint him as the god of FTs as if all top scorers don’t average 10+ FTs. If that was all his game was no one would’ve been doubling him at halfcourt.</p>

<p>Kobe would pump fake a million times to get guys to jump into him. KD pretty won 4 scoring titles in a row using the rip through. Iverson would hurl himself into the paint 35 times a game praying for fouls. You don’t score 30+ a game without FT attempts being a huge part of it unless you’re Stephen Curry.</p>

I never saw Kareem, Russell, Wilt and those guys play so when my dad tells me that Wilt is the best player he ever saw in his life, I don&rsquo;t tell him his an idiot. I listen because I can&rsquo;t dispute his experience with stats alone. Stats only tell you so much.</p>

<p>On Reddit, however, people will tell you that Lebron is the best player of all time without having even seen MJ play. Many people on here weren&rsquo;t even watching basketball until the Warriors/Cavs rivalry and yet they have unmovable opinions about Magic and Bird, Kobe and Duncan, MJ vs Lebron. I Just don&rsquo;t get it.</p>

      <label for="l87oq0s" class="commentText"><p>Kobe was an elite scorer. I&rsquo;m pretty sure Harden was simply more efficient in the regular season on comparable (if not superior) volume, as Kobe took a lot of tough shots. However, Kobe&rsquo;s efficiency didn&rsquo;t suffer the standard falloff for this reason in the postseason, while Harden&rsquo;s decrease was beyond normal - so one could certainly argue Kobe was the better playoff scorer.</p>

<p>Also, I feel that a lot of Kobe&rsquo;s All-Defensive teams were undeserved. Most superstars lose some of their defense as their offensive load increases, and I feel this was the same with Kobe, who was not much of an offball presence and had his share of breakdowns.</p>

It&rsquo;s not even comparable tbh. Kobe averaged 35 in an era with not nearly the same spacing and 3 point shooting frequency with much, much lower pace as well. Both are all time greats, Harden can be argued as being a better regular season scorer, but in the playoffs and as a whole, Kobe is easily the 2nd best SG while Harden is probably 4th at highest.</p>

<p>His lack of individual post season success and as you mentioned, dramatic fall off (possibly due to his foul baiting and methods of scoring) from regular to postseason is a huge reason why he isnt above Wade. People in this thread are pretending as if he didn&rsquo;t completely give up and disappear in some postseason series and elimination games in his prime Houston years and only citing his ppg and shooting efficiency as if that tells the whole story.</p>

      <label for="l87u82u" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, people seem to miss the part where I said he was a great defender still. As his career went on, the reputation stuck around but the effort wasn’t there all game every game like perhaps it was at his defensive peak. So the first teams ARE overstated. Especially his later defensive accolades, he just flat out was not one of the 4 best guard defenders in the NBA.</p>

<p>What’s funny is this wasn’t even something that was really harshly pushed back on among the earlier basketball forum, analytical type of fan while Kobe was playing. It was practically a universal truth during his playing days while it was happening.</p>

<p>I love Kobe, but that doesn’t mean I didn’t live all of that time and see it go down as it went down. I’m not about to pretend otherwise just because I like him. It would be as if 10 years from now some people were saying Embiid has been better than Jokic. We are living it, we know that isn’t the case.</p>

      <label for="l87gkzb" class="commentText"><p>Then why aren&rsquo;t you discussing any actual points? Kobe was relentlessly double teamed all the time. This carried over from regular season to post season which is what made him so dangerous in post season as he wasn&rsquo;t facing any new coverages he hadn&rsquo;t seen before. It&rsquo;s why he was so respected among his peers. It&rsquo;s why the point that guy is arguing for is more likely to be true than not because the spacing, rule changes to carrying/moving screens and freedom of movement and landing zone, all would have substantially helped kobe be an even better scorer.</p>

<p>The era is quite literally easier to score in. There&rsquo;s a reason guys in their mid 30s were playing better than their actual primes and it wasn&rsquo;t cause they kept getting better but the nba was promoting even more offense.</p>

Kobe had to consistently make something out of nothing every possession, shooting  the most difficult shots imaginable - and still having shooting percentages on par with or better than his peers on higher volume than all of them.</p>

<p>Dude would&rsquo;ve cooked in today&rsquo;s NBA, would&rsquo;ve been easy mode for him and I don&rsquo;t think people would know what to make of the display he would be putting on night after night. 2005-06 Kobe (the one that scored 81 and averaged 35 ppg) would&rsquo;ve been utterly insane today.</p>

      <label for="l874bh6" class="commentText"><p>No there was more spacing league wide in prime Harden&rsquo;s era due to the increased focus on 3 point shooting that started with the 2014 Spurs and 2015 Warriors. Every team started playing that drive and kick to shooter offense. During Kobe&rsquo;s era that wasn&rsquo;t really a thing, everyone was trying to score inside a lot more and the pace of play was a lot lower. You had bigs clogging the lane on almost every team, you had way more low post action back then - even Kobe himself played a lot of slow developing post ups.</p>

<p>Just go look at the average TEAM scoring numbers and you can see the difference right there. The top scoring team in 2005-06 (Nash Suns) would be the 10th highest scoring team in 2017-2018, and there&rsquo;s a big drop off after that (2nd place team would be 25th).</p>

<p>Also Kobe&rsquo;s passing skills are underrated, his role wasn&rsquo;t to be the distributer though and playing the triangle offense meant his assist numbers would never be high.</p>

<p>I definitely would not say that.</p>

<p>The average player in 2005 is quite a bit worse than the average player in 2017.</p>

<p>The average player in 2017 is notably worse than the average player in 2024.</p>

<p>Players are getting better on average every single year, that&rsquo;s been the case over basically the entirety of the NBA.</p>

<p>Defensive and offensive schemes are both a lot more complex now compared to 20 years ago as well.</p>

      <label for="l866h4j" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s hard to say how much better guys really are cus the game is catered to offense guys are able to move with the ball way more than ever before, guys who looked way worse back in the 2000s would now have a lot more freedom to use moves they could when they were not on a team, back then u couldn&rsquo;t do that cus you&rsquo;d rather a kobe or mj try and do that instead of ur bench pg. Fundamentally players were a lot more sound as well since we had a lot more 4 year guys, really watching the league as a whole its obvious that a lot of younger teams can look amazing but just lack fundamental skills but since there&rsquo;s so many possessions it matters a lot less since u can just get it back the play after and come out on top cus of a 3. It&rsquo;s hard to compare especially to the 2000s cus there was so much iso ball</p>

You can say the players weren&rsquo;t as good defensively, but the league was definitely much more defensive oriented and allowed defensive players to get away with much more back then.

      <label for="l87e1it" class="commentText"><p>Fair or not, largely the same thing happened to Jordan before the Bulls ended up winning.  He was routinely called a solo artist and that his game wasn&rsquo;t good enough to win.  The 80s was decisively about the Celtics/Lakers with Magic and Bird dominating the conversation of best player and then the Pistons at the end.  After the Pistons win championships there was a sizable movement which considered zeke the better player because he knew how to win.  People ignored the rest of the bulls were kind of ass.</p>

<p>Prime Harden ran into teams that were simply better and Harden wasn&rsquo;t Jordan.  Harden&rsquo;s dominance wasn&rsquo;t as long and he didn&rsquo;t carry until the supporting cast actually came through.  NBA opinions, and frankly most sports as well, have a huge bias against players who don&rsquo;t win championships.  Dominque Wilkins is another guy who gets kind of left off lists for how good he truly was because, well, he wasn&rsquo;t Jordan and didn&rsquo;t win.</p>

      <label for="l8698gq" class="commentText"><p>That’s actually what some do argue. Would his effectiveness still be there without the foul baiting? I don’t think so, cause I remember games where defenders like Lebron would literally put their hands behind them when defending Harden. I think he would still be elite, cause his footwork and size were crazy. If you take out all the arm hooking and head flops, give him half the FTA, probably won’t have those crazy numbers.</p>

<p>The trolls have spent years combining his years as a 6th man with his prime years to make his playoff PPG drop, and people just run with it as if his scoring was going from 30ppg+ in the regular season to 20 in the playoffs.</p>

<p>From the time he became a starter in Houston to the injury in Brooklyn, he was averaging like 28/7/7 on almost 60% TS for ~120 playoff games.</p>

      <label for="l863fd5" class="commentText"><p>the Spurs series is easily the worst indictment on him, but I think a lot of the others are very overblown.</p>

<p>2015 especially. That team was <strong>dogshit</strong> and he carried the piss out of them for a whole season - their starting 5 was basically him, Beverly, Ariza, Motiejunas, and a rotating door for #5 because Dwight was hurt most of the year. He got them to the 2 seed, carried them in the playoffs other than <em>one game</em> which was the game 6 vs LAC.. even closed out the game 7 as the best player on the floor but people ignore that to harp on game 6..</p>

<p>..then against the Warriors who significantly out-matched them had 66 points in the first 2 games and almost stole home court with a +12 in a 1 pt loss in game 2, had no legs for game 3, mustered up a 45 pt game in game 4 to avoid getting eliminated, but was completely gassed by game 5.. and all you ever hear about are the bad couple games from that entire run, with no credit given for the carry job that entire season was.</p>

<p>people always ignore the good to focus on the bad with him, whereas even now players are doing way worse than he did but getting way more passes for putting up shitty performances lol</p>

<p>Bro what?  People pick like individual games and talk about how poorly he played in those individual games. Harden has played in 166 playoff games. Even if you count 20 bad games in his playoff career, that&rsquo;s 12% of his entire playoff career.</p>

<p>Harden is either 4th or 5th in active players for playoff games played depending on whether or not Danny Green is considered &ldquo;active.&rdquo; Dude has played in more playoff games than all of the Golden State core.  Only LeBron, Horford, and Durant have more playoff games played than Harden.</p>

<p>Look at the roster he had that season who was starting all year. Acting like dude wouldn&rsquo;t have a few games where his legs just weren&rsquo;t there after carrying THAT roster is crazy, especially considering the recent excuses made for Luka and Ant lol</p>

<p>And yes, those teammates were bad. In game 2 against GSW in the WCF Jason Terry was like -24 in a 1pt loss while Harden was a +12. Good for him for game 6 - but that doesn&rsquo;t rewrite the entire season unless you&rsquo;re hating</p>

<p>Kobe had 13 such seasons.</p>

<p>Westbrook has 5.</p>

<p>those other guys may not have taken 10.7 FTA/G, but they still shot free throws, and sometimes a reasonably high volume. Kobe was around 8.5-9 for what people would probably consider his prime.</p>

<p>We are talking the difference of maybe 1 total shooting posession of difference in free throws.</p>

<p>Luka is at ~8.5 if we exclude his rookie year.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also not making the argument that these players shot more free throws than Harden.  The argument I&rsquo;m making is that the difference between the two players on average is like 1 scoring possession. (&amp;lt;= 2 free throws a game)</p>

<p>The argument I&rsquo;m making is that the difference between the two players on average is like 1 scoring possession. (&amp;lt;= 2 free throws a game)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true, though while people sometimes account for the crazy amount of 3s guys shoot now, I still think the effect of insane styles of foul baiting is underaccounted for when it comes to how much it opens up the rest of your scoring</p>

      <label for="l86fys0" class="commentText"><p>Kobe averaged 35.4 points a game when the average NBA team that season scored 97 points a game. Harden averaged 36.1 points a game when the average NBA team that season scored 111.2 points a game. Jordan averaged 37.1 points a game when the average NBA team that season scored 109.9 points a game.</p>

<p>Kobe was scoring practically as much in an era where points were much harder to come by.</p>

      <label for="l874v1v" class="commentText"><p>Yes but that’s just focusing on team offense. The reason offenses are scoring so much now is because the role players are snipers. Stars have much more spacing, so they get to score high PPG more efficiently. But, the PPG leaders really haven’t been that much higher until like the past 2 seasons where we’ve had 5-6 guys go for 30+ a game.</p>

<p>In 06 when Kob scored 35.4, Iverson scored 33, Bron 31.4, Gil scored 29.3.</p>

<p>In 19 when Harden scored 36.1, PG was second with 28.0.</p>

      <label for="l86ki5i" class="commentText"><p>Exactly. He figured out how to trick the refs into calling fouls. He looked to draw a foul first and then score. Never played just looking to score. I’m glad he’s never won a ring and I hope he never does. Hooking defenders, jumping into defenders, kicking out legs on jumpshots. To me, inferior players would do things like that because they felt like they weren’t good enough to beat you straight up. Now there’s a lot of great players who try to mimic some of his tricks and it makes the NBA look stupid for allowing it. </p>

Take it how you want. “Played with winning in mind”. Draymond plays with winning in mind as well. CP3 plays with winning in mind. A lot of players play with winning in mind but you don’t have to respect their play style. The swipe through move that KD started. I hate that move as well. The refs already have a hard time as it is and now we got players tricking them on purpose to get fouls. It’s crazy because during games fans bring this same stuff ip but as soon as you comment on a player for doing it you get downvoted and told you gotta respect that player. Y’all gotta make y’all minds up. </p>

      <label for="l87tyay" class="commentText"><p>Alright, fair point about the free throws. Let&rsquo;s break it down then:</p>

<p>Kobe and Harden both got to the line a lot, but the difference is in how they did it. Kobe earned his trips with aggressive drives and tough shots, while Harden perfected the art of drawing fouls with minimal contact—flopping, if we&rsquo;re being honest.</p>

<p>But even if we set that aside, let&rsquo;s talk about the play style and era. Harden&rsquo;s game heavily relies on the three-point revolution, where volume shooting from deep is encouraged. Kobe played in an era where mid-range was king, and defenses were tougher overall. Despite the different play styles, Kobe was still an elite scorer without needing to depend on the three as much as Harden does.</p>

<p>Harden&rsquo;s style, great for regular season stat-padding, doesn&rsquo;t translate as well when defenses clamp down in the playoffs. Kobe  thrived in those high-pressure situations.</p>

<p>Durant and Harden more fun and controversial.</p>

<p>KD only gets the nod by public perception because of his two participation rings. Take them away and you have an interesting but spicy argument that is much closer than Kobe &amp; James.</p>

      <label for="l87z2xu" class="commentText"><p>this is taking a result and working backwards to find the wrong causes.</p>

<p>The reasons he got fouled so much are  because he was so incredible at getting defenders off balance in different ways and forcing them to contest from a disadvantageous position - when he wasn&rsquo;t blowing by them and leaving them in the dust. If they didn&rsquo;t foul, it&rsquo;s a free layup.</p>

<p>On stepbacks, if you have to recover by jumping forward to contest a shot, your choices are basically a piss poor contest or risking the foul by jumping at/by the shooter. You&rsquo;re gonna misjudge that distance or put a little too much gas into that recovery sometimes.</p>

<p>His low gather point also generated plenty of fouls because defenders would reach into the cookie jar thinking they had a chance to swipe/block it as he brought it up to lay it in.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also true that he&rsquo;s pretty good at noticing when defenders make mistakes and taking advantage of them. if you want to be mad about something, be mad about those defenders screwing up. The opportunity to draw fouls as an offensive player only exists when defenders make defensive mistakes.</p>
