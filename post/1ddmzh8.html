I’m not saying he deserved every ring and that they mean something.  not talking about wins, just pure skill and talent, he is elite. I named Superstars that he was ranked above. It’s not even about rings, it’s about everything, even peers and stars around the league could see Lebron is a goat talent.</p>

<p>You’re not the first nephew to ever come at Lebron but being so obviously biased and blind just makes you a straight hater. Everything you say will just come off salty and untrustworthy.</p>

      <label for="l87e5h3" class="commentText"><p>Yeah. He was one of the best scorers I’ve ever seen play and I hate how the media decided to paint him as the god of FTs as if all top scorers don’t average 10+ FTs. If that was all his game was no one would’ve been doubling him at halfcourt.</p>

<p>Kobe would pump fake a million times to get guys to jump into him. KD pretty won 4 scoring titles in a row using the rip through. Iverson would hurl himself into the paint 35 times a game praying for fouls. You don’t score 30+ a game without FT attempts being a huge part of it unless you’re Stephen Curry.</p>

I never saw Kareem, Russell, Wilt and those guys play so when my dad tells me that Wilt is the best player he ever saw in his life, I don&rsquo;t tell him his an idiot. I listen because I can&rsquo;t dispute his experience with stats alone. Stats only tell you so much.</p>

<p>On Reddit, however, people will tell you that Lebron is the best player of all time without having even seen MJ play. Many people on here weren&rsquo;t even watching basketball until the Warriors/Cavs rivalry and yet they have unmovable opinions about Magic and Bird, Kobe and Duncan, MJ vs Lebron. I Just don&rsquo;t get it.</p>

      <label for="l87oq0s" class="commentText"><p>Kobe was an elite scorer. I&rsquo;m pretty sure Harden was simply more efficient in the regular season on comparable (if not superior) volume, as Kobe took a lot of tough shots. However, Kobe&rsquo;s efficiency didn&rsquo;t suffer the standard falloff for this reason in the postseason, while Harden&rsquo;s decrease was beyond normal - so one could certainly argue Kobe was the better playoff scorer.</p>

<p>Also, I feel that a lot of Kobe&rsquo;s All-Defensive teams were undeserved. Most superstars lose some of their defense as their offensive load increases, and I feel this was the same with Kobe, who was not much of an offball presence and had his share of breakdowns.</p>

<p>Kobe was properly rated on defense.</p>

<p>What you’re saying is comparable to saying Lebron is a bad defender throughout his career for not sprinting for a chase down block on every single play.</p>

      <label for="l87gkzb" class="commentText"><p>Then why aren&rsquo;t you discussing any actual points? Kobe was relentlessly double teamed all the time. This carried over from regular season to post season which is what made him so dangerous in post season as he wasn&rsquo;t facing any new coverages he hadn&rsquo;t seen before. It&rsquo;s why he was so respected among his peers. It&rsquo;s why the point that guy is arguing for is more likely to be true than not because the spacing, rule changes to carrying/moving screens and freedom of movement and landing zone, all would have substantially helped kobe be an even better scorer.</p>

<p>The era is quite literally easier to score in. There&rsquo;s a reason guys in their mid 30s were playing better than their actual primes and it wasn&rsquo;t cause they kept getting better but the nba was promoting even more offense.</p>

      <label for="l874bh6" class="commentText"><p>No there was more spacing league wide in prime Harden&rsquo;s era due to the increased focus on 3 point shooting that started with the 2014 Spurs and 2015 Warriors. Every team started playing that drive and kick to shooter offense. During Kobe&rsquo;s era that wasn&rsquo;t really a thing, everyone was trying to score inside a lot more and the pace of play was a lot lower. You had bigs clogging the lane on almost every team, you had way more low post action back then - even Kobe himself played a lot of slow developing post ups.</p>

<p>Just go look at the average TEAM scoring numbers and you can see the difference right there. The top scoring team in 2005-06 (Nash Suns) would be the 10th highest scoring team in 2017-2018, and there&rsquo;s a big drop off after that (2nd place team would be 25th).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2018.html" target="_blank">https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2018.html</a></p>

<p>Also Kobe&rsquo;s passing skills are underrated, his role wasn&rsquo;t to be the distributer though and playing the triangle offense meant his assist numbers would never be high.</p>

<p>TMac isn’t in the conversation. He played 7 relatively healthy seasons as a star and never made it out of the first round. He was 28 when you could realistically say his injury issues started and had absolutely zero success.</p>

<p>I definitely would not say that.</p>

<p>The average player in 2005 is quite a bit worse than the average player in 2017.</p>

<p>The average player in 2017 is notably worse than the average player in 2024.</p>

<p>Players are getting better on average every single year, that&rsquo;s been the case over basically the entirety of the NBA.</p>

      <label for="l866h4j" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s hard to say how much better guys really are cus the game is catered to offense guys are able to move with the ball way more than ever before, guys who looked way worse back in the 2000s would now have a lot more freedom to use moves they could when they were not on a team, back then u couldn&rsquo;t do that cus you&rsquo;d rather a kobe or mj try and do that instead of ur bench pg. Fundamentally players were a lot more sound as well since we had a lot more 4 year guys, really watching the league as a whole its obvious that a lot of younger teams can look amazing but just lack fundamental skills but since there&rsquo;s so many possessions it matters a lot less since u can just get it back the play after and come out on top cus of a 3. It&rsquo;s hard to compare especially to the 2000s cus there was so much iso ball</p>

      <label for="l862j2a" class="commentText"><p>Look at the differences in ppg &amp; efficiency between that era and the current era. You can say the players weren&rsquo;t as good defensively, but the league was definitely much more defensive oriented and allowed defensive players to get away with much more back then. It is definitely easier for players to score in the current era.</p>

      <label for="l8662uw" class="commentText"><p>I think that is in Kobe&rsquo;s favor. More big guys defending in the paint, less spacing as PFs were just smaller Centers back then.</p>

<p>Harden played in an insane spacing era which would have absolutely helped Kobe out.</p>

      <label for="l87e1it" class="commentText"><p>Fair or not, largely the same thing happened to Jordan before the Bulls ended up winning.  He was routinely called a solo artist and that his game wasn&rsquo;t good enough to win.  The 80s was decisively about the Celtics/Lakers with Magic and Bird dominating the conversation of best player and then the Pistons at the end.  After the Pistons win championships there was a sizable movement which considered zeke the better player because he knew how to win.  People ignored the rest of the bulls were kind of ass.</p>

<p>Prime Harden ran into teams that were simply better and Harden wasn&rsquo;t Jordan.  Harden&rsquo;s dominance wasn&rsquo;t as long and he didn&rsquo;t carry until the supporting cast actually came through.  NBA opinions, and frankly most sports as well, have a huge bias against players who don&rsquo;t win championships.  Dominque Wilkins is another guy who gets kind of left off lists for how good he truly was because, well, he wasn&rsquo;t Jordan and didn&rsquo;t win.</p>

      <label for="l8698gq" class="commentText"><p>That’s actually what some do argue. Would his effectiveness still be there without the foul baiting? I don’t think so, cause I remember games where defenders like Lebron would literally put their hands behind them when defending Harden. I think he would still be elite, cause his footwork and size were crazy. If you take out all the arm hooking and head flops, give him half the FTA, probably won’t have those crazy numbers.</p>

<p>From the time he became a starter in Houston to the injury in Brooklyn, he was averaging like 28/7/7 on almost 60% TS for ~120 playoff games.</p>

      <label for="l863fd5" class="commentText"><p>the Spurs series is easily the worst indictment on him, but I think a lot of the others are very overblown.</p>

<p>2015 especially. That team was <strong>dogshit</strong> and he carried the piss out of them for a whole season - their starting 5 was basically him, Beverly, Ariza, Motiejunas, and a rotating door for #5 because Dwight was hurt most of the year. He got them to the 2 seed, carried them in the playoffs other than <em>one game</em> which was the game 6 vs LAC.. even closed out the game 7 as the best player on the floor but people ignore that to harp on game 6..</p>

<p>..then against the Warriors who significantly out-matched them had 66 points in the first 2 games and almost stole home court with a +12 in a 1 pt loss in game 2, had no legs for game 3, mustered up a 45 pt game in game 4 to avoid getting eliminated, but was completely gassed by game 5.. and all you ever hear about are the bad couple games from that entire run, with no credit given for the carry job that entire season was.</p>

<p>people always ignore the good to focus on the bad with him, whereas even now players are doing way worse than he did but getting way more passes for putting up shitty performances lol</p>

<p>Bro what?  People pick like individual games and talk about how poorly he played in those individual games. Harden has played in 166 playoff games. Even if you count 20 bad games in his playoff career, that&rsquo;s 12% of his entire playoff career.</p>

<p>Harden is either 4th or 5th in active players for playoff games played depending on whether or not Danny Green is considered &ldquo;active.&rdquo; Dude has played in more playoff games than all of the Golden State core.  Only LeBron, Horford, and Durant have more playoff games played than Harden.</p>

<p>Look at the roster he had that season who was starting all year. Acting like dude wouldn&rsquo;t have a few games where his legs just weren&rsquo;t there after carrying THAT roster is crazy, especially considering the recent excuses made for Luka and Ant lol</p>

<p>And yes, those teammates were bad. In game 2 against GSW in the WCF Jason Terry was like -24 in a 1pt loss while Harden was a +12. Good for him for game 6 - but that doesn&rsquo;t rewrite the entire season unless you&rsquo;re hating</p>

      <label for="l864ngc" class="commentText"><p>The sneaky thing about Harden is that relative to a lot of high volume guys, he really didn&rsquo;t take <em>that</em> many shots.</p>

<p>Over his entire career, he has 3 seasons where he averaged 20 or more shots per game.</p>

<p>Kobe had 13 such seasons.</p>

<p>Westbrook has 5.</p>

<p>Luka is in year 6 and he already has 5 of those seasons.</p>

<p>I understand that Harden shot 3s and older guys like Kobe didn&rsquo;t, but he still probably didn&rsquo;t shoot as often as some people assume he did.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>those other guys may not have taken 10.7 FTA/G, but they still shot free throws, and sometimes a reasonably high volume. Kobe was around 8.5-9 for what people would probably consider his prime.</p>

<p>We are talking the difference of maybe 1 total shooting posession of difference in free throws.</p>

<p>Luka is at ~8.5 if we exclude his rookie year.</p>

      <label for="l874v1v" class="commentText"><p>Yes but that’s just focusing on team offense. The reason offenses are scoring so much now is because the role players are snipers. Stars have much more spacing, so they get to score high PPG more efficiently. But, the PPG leaders really haven’t been that much higher until like the past 2 seasons where we’ve had 5-6 guys go for 30+ a game.</p>

<p>In 06 when Kob scored 35.4, Iverson scored 33, Bron 31.4, Gil scored 29.3.</p>

<p>In 19 when Harden scored 36.1, PG was second with 28.0.</p>

      <label for="l86ki5i" class="commentText"><p>Exactly. He figured out how to trick the refs into calling fouls. He looked to draw a foul first and then score. Never played just looking to score. I’m glad he’s never won a ring and I hope he never does. Hooking defenders, jumping into defenders, kicking out legs on jumpshots. To me, inferior players would do things like that because they felt like they weren’t good enough to beat you straight up. Now there’s a lot of great players who try to mimic some of his tricks and it makes the NBA look stupid for allowing it. </p>

Take it how you want. “Played with winning in mind”. Draymond plays with winning in mind as well. CP3 plays with winning in mind. A lot of players play with winning in mind but you don’t have to respect their play style. The swipe through move that KD started. I hate that move as well. The refs already have a hard time as it is and now we got players tricking them on purpose to get fouls. It’s crazy because during games fans bring this same stuff ip but as soon as you comment on a player for doing it you get downvoted and told you gotta respect that player. Y’all gotta make y’all minds up. </p>

<p>and even that&rsquo;s dumb. Look at all the series that the rockets won 4-1 but his ppg and fg% because teams like the jazz and the wolves would double and triple him at half court just to keep his scoring down despite getting blown out</p>

<p>I dont rly remember if they did change some rule bc of him but for sure that something who was talked a lot back then, this is how good and smart was prime Harden, ppl had no idea how to defend that guy.</p>

<p>U can also say its him who made the step back 3 what it is now in terme of popularity, everyone wanted to copy him.</p>

The guy is a master of foul baiting and chucking threes, which works great in the regular season when refs blow the whistle on every touch.

<p>When it comes to playoff basketball, where the refs swallow their whistles and defense tightens up, Harden&rsquo;s game falls apart. Kobe thrived under pressure, delivering in crunch time and carrying his team to five championships. Harden? Not so much. He can score, sure, but Kobe was a pure scorer and clutch performer.
