      <label for="lkmbval" class="commentText"><p>This is crazy how your comment got so many upvotes and the below one got so many downvotes. </p>

<p>Rob Gronkowski’s 2011 season, right in the middle of your 2010-2012 range, is considered by almost everyone who knows football as the <em>greatest TE season of all time</em>. Forget comparing him to Graham. It’s better than every other TE season from every other TE in history.</p>

<p>Let’s just start with some facts.</p>

<p>In 2011, Gronkowski was unanimous first team All-Pro at TE. Graham was second team All-Pro at TE. <em>Every single voter</em> who had a vote voted for Gronk on first team. How in the world can you say Graham was better when literally every single voter put Gronk higher in 2011?</p>

<p>Gronk set the single season TE record for both receiving yards and TDs in 2011 (receiving yards has since been surpassed by Kelce). </p>

<p>He did this while also being the best run blocker TE in all of football. Graham didn’t even play running plays because he didn’t run block. Graham was only in for passing situations.</p>

<p>The only reason you think Graham was somehow better was probably you never watched football in 2011, went to Football Reference, and saw Graham had more receptions and somehow concluded he was better in 2011. </p>

<p>There is no one in the world who thought Gronk was worse than Graham. It isn’t even a debate. That’s the single greatest TE season of all time.</p>

      <label for="lkme9eg" class="commentText"><p>I said this in another comment below and I agree with you.</p>

<p>2012-2013 are really the only two years where Graham was better if you judge better by health. Gronk was still the better player but if health is a factor, I agree Graham had better years in 2012 and 2013. I don’t think that’s actually debatable either as Graham was available to play and availability is big in football. </p>

<p>It would be similar to like saying Sabonis is better than Embiid in 2023-2024. That technically is true. I think Sabonis did have a better season than Embiid in 2023-2024 because Embiid missed so much time. That’s why Sabonis made an All NBA team and Embiid didn’t. However, the better player was still Embiid if you are talking about taking someone for one game. </p>

<p>In football, they don’t do per game stats, just aggregate so it’s hard to tell. Per game stats for NBA would clearly still favor Embiid since it doesn’t punish miss games, but the idea is similar to the above example. </p>

<p>Graham: 301 receptions/3863 Yards/41 TDs in 62 games</p>

<p>Gronk: 226 receptions/3255 yards/42 TDs in 50 games</p>

<p>Per game:</p>

<p>Graham: 4.85 receptions/62.3 yards/.66 TDs</p>

<p>Gronk: 4.52 receptions/65.1 yards/.84 TDs</p>

<p>It’s much closer than you think, the biggest difference was health, but after that second season (TD record breaking season) the way teams would tackle Gronk low and take his legs out changed things for him. When they were both on the field it was neck and neck for their first 4 years, especially since they both had amazing sophomore seasons.</p>

      <label for="lkmd0z8" class="commentText"><p>Lol this is crazy how you got so many downvotes. Gronk in 2011 had the single greatest TE season of all time.</p>

<p>What he did that year was ridiculous and might never by matched by a TE. Kelce is the closest but he’s not as good of a run blocker. Graham didn’t even play half the snaps because he couldn’t run block.</p>

<p>The only seasons Graham was better was like 2012-2013 because Gronk got hurt. Gronk was still a better player but since he was hurt you could say Graham was better. But that’s like saying Sabonis is better than Embiid specifically in 2023-2024. Technically he was just in the last season because Embiid got hurt (hence Embiid didn’t make an All-NBA team) but Embiid is still the better player, just wasn’t healthy for this particular season. </p>

      <label for="lkld2c4" class="commentText"><p>There&rsquo;s a really good video of the Kelce brothers discussing if NBA players would make it in the NFL and vice verse.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M5_qjaQkw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M5_qjaQkw</a></p>

<p>The TLDR of it is that Jason is convinced there are NBA players who would certainly make it in the NFL but not the other way around. Travis thinks NFL players could make it in the NBA. When I watched this months ago I did look up the NFL players Travis mentioned in the clip and all except 1 are way too short to be NBA players unless they are CP3 savants.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting clip, especially if you&rsquo;re an NBA homer. The Kelce brothers are extremely good NFL players, both HoF material for those that don&rsquo;t know.</p>

If you can be anything in baseball be a starting pitcher. You pitch once every five games and even if you’re average you will make great money. Jeff Samardzija was a very average pitcher and made over <span class="math inline">\(120 million in his career. He would have had to be an elite NFL wide receiver to come close to that. Kyler Murray is set to make over \)</span>230 million- over $160 million guaranteed with the signing bonus. He would have had to have been an exceptional left fielder to get that kind of money.

Nate Robinson might have been a decent RB if he started in middle school/ high school and put on 30 to 40 pounds . I think Jason is right.  There&rsquo;s a few nba players that could make it but it&rsquo;s a small few.  Just way different body types for each sport.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a limit because when they hit you with a low ball that goes on the floor, tall gk suffer.</p>

<p>But we are passed the era where it was normal to see goalkeepers beeing less than 6&rsquo;0. Like Cañizares</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s common but there are a few near him. Obviously he would be a target man for crosses, not an agile dribbler.</p>

<p>One of the few players I could get an actual speed for is Westbrook.</p>

<p>Westbrook hit 21.6mph on a basketball court, which is faster than Ronaldo (21.5) and considerably faster than Messi (20.2), and he did that with much more limited space to accelerate, it&rsquo;s quite likely his top speed is higher than that.  Did those dudes look laughable on the field?  Did LeBron look laughable compared to Westbrook?</p>

      <label for="lkm2qec" class="commentText"><p>Maybe I didn’t phrase it fully, but acceleration in football and basketball are different simply because of the size of the playing field. Lebron accelerating over an area that’s roughly the same size as the box on a football pitch doesn’t compare to a football setting.</p>

<p>Besides that, Lebron probably has 50 pounds over the taller football players, for him to pick up speed compared to someone lighter wouldn’t even be a contest.</p>

<p>OPs statement is especially odd considering guys like Henry, R9 and Robben etc to name a very few would have absolutely smoked him.</p>

<p>But in soccer, he needs to control the ball with quick short foot movements, sprint for a while, stop, sprint, stop, sprint, kick, control the ball, etc. I&rsquo;d say he couldve learned that if he grew up playing it, but I think his height would&rsquo;ve been a detriment to his success. And sticking him out there in his prime, definitely, he he isn&rsquo;t coordinated enough in his feet enough.</p>

      <label for="lkm49tm" class="commentText"><p>Bron would have a great 4-6 year career at TE missing a few games each year before his body quit on him. Especially if he had to block. He&rsquo;s a special athlete but the physical punishment you have to endure is in a completely different universe than what NBA players deal with.</p>

<p>Throwing a football is very different than a basketball, we have no idea if he has NFL level accuracy. Pocket presence, release time, etc. He didn’t even play QB in high school.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a position like edge rusher… yeah he’d go crazy lol. Not as much guesswork needed.</p>
