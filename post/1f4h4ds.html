      <label for="lkmbval" class="commentText"><p>This is crazy how your comment got so many upvotes and the below one got so many downvotes. </p>

<p>Rob Gronkowski’s 2011 season, right in the middle of your 2010-2012 range, is considered by almost everyone who knows football as the <em>greatest TE season of all time</em>. Forget comparing him to Graham. It’s better than every other TE season from every other TE in history.</p>

<p>Let’s just start with some facts.</p>

<p>In 2011, Gronkowski was unanimous first team All-Pro at TE. Graham was second team All-Pro at TE. <em>Every single voter</em> who had a vote voted for Gronk on first team. How in the world can you say Graham was better when literally every single voter put Gronk higher in 2011?</p>

<p>Gronk set the single season TE record for both receiving yards and TDs in 2011 (receiving yards has since been surpassed by Kelce). </p>

<p>He did this while also being the best run blocker TE in all of football. Graham didn’t even play running plays because he didn’t run block. Graham was only in for passing situations.</p>

<p>The only reason you think Graham was somehow better was probably you never watched football in 2011, went to Football Reference, and saw Graham had more receptions and somehow concluded he was better in 2011. </p>

<p>There is no one in the world who thought Gronk was worse than Graham. It isn’t even a debate. That’s the single greatest TE season of all time.</p>

Tom just broke every argument about intangibles and clutch factor that existed before him. I still don’t think anyone has ever played the position the way Manning did.

      <label for="lkmwpga" class="commentText"><p>It’s very simple, Manning was a better pre-snap QB, Brady was better post-snap. Manning was basically an offensive coordinator on the field. Brady didn’t really need to be an offensive coordinator, he was able to find holes in defenses fast, and audible into the right plays if needed. Manning would spend entire play clocks constantly changining plays and making adjustments to put the offense in the right play. But he did notably struggle in the playoffs, when defenses would get tougher and disguise their coverages really well. Manning also played in a dome, and had more financial investment into his offense.</p>

      <label for="lkme9eg" class="commentText"><p>I said this in another comment below and I agree with you.</p>

<p>2012-2013 are really the only two years where Graham was better if you judge better by health. Gronk was still the better player but if health is a factor, I agree Graham had better years in 2012 and 2013. I don’t think that’s actually debatable either as Graham was available to play and availability is big in football. </p>

<p>It would be similar to like saying Sabonis is better than Embiid in 2023-2024. That technically is true. I think Sabonis did have a better season than Embiid in 2023-2024 because Embiid missed so much time. That’s why Sabonis made an All NBA team and Embiid didn’t. However, the better player was still Embiid if you are talking about taking someone for one game. </p>

<p>In football, they don’t do per game stats, just aggregate so it’s hard to tell. Per game stats for NBA would clearly still favor Embiid since it doesn’t punish miss games, but the idea is similar to the above example. </p>

<p>You: No, Gronkowski easily overshadows him because he had 12 redzone TDs in 2011 versus Graham’s 11 in 2013</p>

<p>I don’t understand what you think you’re saying here. A <strong>one TD difference</strong> is the basis of your claim that  “no, Graham is not up there with him, Gronkowski easily overshadows him.”</p>

<p>If that’s the case, I don’t think our perspectives on the sport are anywhere close enough to have a productive conversation.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M5_qjaQkw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5M5_qjaQkw</a></p>

<p>The TLDR of it is that Jason is convinced there are NBA players who would certainly make it in the NFL but not the other way around. Travis thinks NFL players could make it in the NBA. When I watched this months ago I did look up the NFL players Travis mentioned in the clip and all except 1 are way too short to be NBA players unless they are CP3 savants.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting clip, especially if you&rsquo;re an NBA homer. The Kelce brothers are extremely good NFL players, both HoF material for those that don&rsquo;t know.</p>

      <label for="lkml0e3" class="commentText"><p>If you can be anything in the NFL be a QB. The rules protect you more and one contact and you’re set. If you can be anything in baseball be a starting pitcher. You pitch once every five games and even if you’re average you will make great money. Jeff Samardzija was a very average pitcher and made over <span class="math inline">\(120 million in his career. He would have had to be an elite NFL wide receiver to come close to that. Kyler Murray is set to make over \)</span>230 million- over $160 million guaranteed with the signing bonus. He would have had to have been an exceptional left fielder to get that kind of money. Both of these people made the right choice.</p>

<p>Relief pitchers throw more often but only for an inning or two, teams generally have 8 of these.</p>

      <label for="lkmoy2g" class="commentText"><p>The height thing is everything. Jason is 100% correct. The TEs in the NFL converted from basketball to football for a reason, and that reason wasn&rsquo;t as a Sophomore in college they suddenly grew a love for football that outmatched their love for basketball.</p>

<p>The NFL has the best athletes from a strength/speed perspective, but that does not take into consideration height, hand-eye coordination, and what the NBA guys would look like if they were going for the strength/speed that is needed for the NFL.</p>

At 6’5 to make the NBA you’re competing with something like 0.2% of the US men’s population. At 5’9 to make the NFL you’re competing with roughly half the population lol</p>

<p>The only current NBA guy I can think of that has a serious chance is Anthony Edwards. The rest are either too unathletic, too tall, or just doesn’t have the build. Young Lebron too, but his height is a genuine concern</p>

<p>Skill is something everyone can work on. Some have a bigger affinity for it than others, but it&rsquo;s still something anyone can improve. There are so many players under 6 foot that have LeBron or KD level skills that never get a chance because they&rsquo;re just too short.</p>

<p>I do wanna see how the Calvin Johnson’s and Julio Jones and Andre Johnson’s would do in nba. Actually, given the ball handling and shooting gap, there’s just no shot.</p>

<p>So yeah, agree, nba players. But I still think they get fuckin wrecked. Actually, maybe QB? I could for sure see some of them being super legit at QB.</p>

      <label for="lkm1ucp" class="commentText"><p>Too tall even for a goalkeeper. The top goalkeepers today are very tall. But all of them go from 190 or 6&rsquo;3 to 198 or 6&rsquo;6</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a limit because when they hit you with a low ball that goes on the floor, tall gk suffer.</p>

<p>But we are passed the era where it was normal to see goalkeepers beeing less than 6&rsquo;0. Like Cañizares</p>

      <label for="lkmqu69" class="commentText"><p>Lebron would be top 5 tallest dudes to ever play in the nfl.  Reason being guys that tall aren’t fast or quick enough and get tackled way too easy.  Not even linemen are that tall.  Football is the most popular sport in the US by far.  You’d think there would be some examples, but there aren’t because they’re too tall.  </p>

<p>One of the few players I could get an actual speed for is Westbrook.</p>

<p>Westbrook hit 21.6mph on a basketball court, which is faster than Ronaldo (21.5) and considerably faster than Messi (20.2), and he did that with much more limited space to accelerate, it&rsquo;s quite likely his top speed is higher than that.  Did those dudes look laughable on the field?  Did LeBron look laughable compared to Westbrook?</p>

<p>I saw LeBron playing american football and running, and no way he can sustain path, the same as Metkalf can run 40 super fast but can sustain the path against true speed runners.</p>

<p>Soccer players are not fast. They&rsquo;re fast for 50 or 60 meters.</p>

<p>I saw Roberto Carlos go from his own area to the opposite corner like it was a fucking thunder. Russ, LeBron and other NBA player could do nothing but like their balls in that regard.</p>

      <label for="lkm2qec" class="commentText"><p>Maybe I didn’t phrase it fully, but acceleration in football and basketball are different simply because of the size of the playing field. Lebron accelerating over an area that’s roughly the same size as the box on a football pitch doesn’t compare to a football setting.</p>

<p>Besides that, Lebron probably has 50 pounds over the taller football players, for him to pick up speed compared to someone lighter wouldn’t even be a contest.</p>

<p>OPs statement is especially odd considering guys like Henry, R9 and Robben etc to name a very few would have absolutely smoked him.</p>

<p>But in soccer, he needs to control the ball with quick short foot movements, sprint for a while, stop, sprint, stop, sprint, kick, control the ball, etc. I&rsquo;d say he couldve learned that if he grew up playing it, but I think his height would&rsquo;ve been a detriment to his success. And sticking him out there in his prime, definitely, he he isn&rsquo;t coordinated enough in his feet enough.</p>

      <label for="lkmpobf" class="commentText"><p>Right but the last part is true for everyone in the NFL - huge range of thiccness. LeBron would have absolutely destroyed the NFL. Travis Kelce is one of, if not the best TE of all time - he is like half the athlete LeBron is. LeBron could easily have bulked up to &hellip; 270, 280? 30 pounds when you are 6&rsquo;9&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t that much. Probably still runs a 4.6. Can go up and get a ball at 12 ft in the air.

      <label for="lkm49tm" class="commentText"><p>Bron would have a great 4-6 year career at TE missing a few games each year before his body quit on him. Especially if he had to block. He&rsquo;s a special athlete but the physical punishment you have to endure is in a completely different universe than what NBA players deal with.</p>

<p>Throwing a football is very different than a basketball, we have no idea if he has NFL level accuracy. Pocket presence, release time, etc. He didn’t even play QB in high school.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a position like edge rusher… yeah he’d go crazy lol. Not as much guesswork needed.</p>
