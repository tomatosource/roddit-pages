      <p>In 2017 Lebron said the following in an interview with ABC:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know I won&rsquo;t be able to play at this level forever, but to be washed [up] and play &hellip; I don&rsquo;t know if I can play washed,&rdquo; James said. &ldquo;but I damn sure would love to stick around if my oldest son can have an opportunity to play against me. That&rsquo;d be, that&rsquo;d be the icing on the cake right there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If that does happen, he already has a welcome gift planned for his son. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll foul the s&mdash; out of him!&rdquo; James said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give him all six fouls. I&rsquo;d foul the s&mdash; out of Bronny, man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Also pisses me off that <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> years of prime-level basketball from LeBron on the Lakers was basically wasted.</p>

      <label for="latcugf" class="commentText"><p>Being top 15 at 39 is staggering. As sports medicine continues to improve, we will likely see more and more athletes continue their careers to the brink of middle age. In very recent history, we&rsquo;ve seen LeBron, Tom Brady, C Ronaldo and Messi able to play at ir near this point.  I know Ronaldo is washed up, but his career was on a death watch over a decade ago, based on the decline of the average soccer player. It&rsquo;s really remarkable.</p>

      <label for="latf7qd" class="commentText"><p>Considering the millions they rake in yearly, they have access to expensive undetectable PEDs with unusual molecular structure. They are prioritized since they can pay the highest. The important thing is casual viewers believe LeBron is the most skilled ever but the reality is it’s more of his freak athletic ability retained through juicing. It’s unfortunate that when he gave a newer version of The Clear to his young son that he developed a heart condition. It should be used while older. Around Jon Jones age is the sweet spot.</p>

It was the moment I realized I was smarter than some GM’s.  Even if LeBron steadily declined from 2018 onwards, 1 year of 2017 or 2018 LeBron is better than KAT’s whole career, similar thing for AD (maybe 2 years of LBJ)</p>

<p>Everyone keeps saying the role players are too bad, yet some of them leave and do better elsewhere, or did better before they joined LA.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s too easy to rack up numbers in the league today. He&rsquo;s putting up monster numbers on paper, yet his team is fighting for a playoff spot. Sure, if LA could add 2 more star players, they might win a title. But you can say that about any team.</p>

      <label for="laszeuf" class="commentText"><p>It could actually happen to be honest. Bryce would be eligible to get drafted in 2026. So if LeBron signs another 2+1 or straight up a 2 year deal, who knows what the options will be like</p>

<p>I was going to say it might become difficult because Bryce is a bigger talent than Bronny, and there’s a chance he becomes a lottery pick without the nepotism aspect. However, LeBron will obviously be older by that time and might not have enough power to facilitate moves like threatening other teams not to take Bronny in the 2nd</p>

      <label for="lat59cw" class="commentText"><p>Correct, but Bryce is more athletic and has a better size. It’s easier for him to develop and add skills to his game than it is for Bronny to develop the NBA skills he’s lacking or gain extra height</p>

      <label for="latatfb" class="commentText"><p>Bryce moves like a baby giraffe he is not more athletic at all. Where the fuck did this narrative come from? Every video of Bryce and Bronny and LeBron working out shows that Bryce is positively ungainly compared to the other two.</p>

<p>I feel like I’m taking crazy pills, people years ago said Bryce was the one to watch as a joke, now he’s 6’7 and it’s like people have complete cognitive dissonance as to his actual abilities, because he is nowhere near as good as Bronny was at that age</p>
