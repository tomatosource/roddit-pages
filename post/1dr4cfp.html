As sports medicine continues to improve, we will likely see more and more athletes continue their careers to the brink of middle age. In very recent history, we&rsquo;ve seen LeBron, Tom Brady, C Ronaldo and Messi able to play at ir near this point.  I know Ronaldo is washed up, but his career was on a death watch over a decade ago, based on the decline of the average soccer player. It&rsquo;s really remarkable.</p>

<p>Those weren&rsquo;t impressive stats then and they aren&rsquo;t now, he was horribly inefficient and did nothing for the development of his team. There&rsquo;s a reason people like to pretend Wizards MJ never happened. Current LeBron is closer to prime MJ than he is to Wizards MJ.</p>

      <label for="latf7qd" class="commentText"><p>Considering the millions they rake in yearly, they have access to expensive undetectable PEDs with unusual molecular structure. They are prioritized since they can pay the highest. The important thing is casual viewers believe LeBron is the most skilled ever but the reality is it’s more of his freak athletic ability retained through juicing. It’s unfortunate that when he gave a newer version of The Clear to his young son that he developed a heart condition. It should be used while older. Around Jon Jones age is the sweet spot.</p>

It was the moment I realized I was smarter than some GM’s.  Even if LeBron steadily declined from 2018 onwards, 1 year of 2017 or 2018 LeBron is better than KAT’s whole career, similar thing for AD (maybe 2 years of LBJ)</p>

      <label for="latekl5" class="commentText"><p>Did the Lakers waste it, or has Lebron gone downhill and his numbers don&rsquo;t change the game anymore? How much more can you ask from Davis? Dude was unbelievable in the playoffs and didn&rsquo;t miss much time during the season.</p>

<p>Everyone keeps saying the role players are too bad, yet some of them leave and do better elsewhere, or did better before they joined LA.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s too easy to rack up numbers in the league today. He&rsquo;s putting up monster numbers on paper, yet his team is fighting for a playoff spot. Sure, if LA could add 2 more star players, they might win a title. But you can say that about any team.</p>

<p>I was going to say it might become difficult because Bryce is a bigger talent than Bronny, and there’s a chance he becomes a lottery pick without the nepotism aspect. However, LeBron will obviously be older by that time and might not have enough power to facilitate moves like threatening other teams not to take Bronny in the 2nd</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It came from the family themselves like 3-4 years ago iirc. They all said he&rsquo;d be better than Bronny and that he was more skilled for his age and people just ran with it ever since. Bronny was a legitimate top 30 player in his entire class. Maybe he wasn&rsquo;t NBA draft ready but he was really good on his own merit. Bryce is barely a top 50 player at his own position in his class. It&rsquo;s really obvious when people just regurgitate narratives without keeping up with the actual merits of the players.</p>

<p>Bryce is a bigger talent than Bronny</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bronny was a top recruit in his class and one point away from being a 5 star recruit. Bryce is heading into his senior year and is ranked a three star recruit and ESPN has him has the 48th best player at his position and not even ranked in the top 100 of his class &ndash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/251631/bryce-james" target="_blank">here</a>. Unless he makes an insane level jump his senior season I do not understand what talent you are seeing that the scouts seem to be missing. I have watched both of them play in full games and saying things like Bryce is more athletic lets me know you have not. Having better size does not mean its a given you will develop into a better talent</p>
