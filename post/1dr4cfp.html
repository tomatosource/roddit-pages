As sports medicine continues to improve, we will likely see more and more athletes continue their careers to the brink of middle age. In very recent history, we&rsquo;ve seen LeBron, Tom Brady, C Ronaldo and Messi able to play at ir near this point.  I know Ronaldo is washed up, but his career was on a death watch over a decade ago, based on the decline of the average soccer player. It&rsquo;s really remarkable.</p>

<p>Those weren&rsquo;t impressive stats then and they aren&rsquo;t now, he was horribly inefficient and did nothing for the development of his team. There&rsquo;s a reason people like to pretend Wizards MJ never happened. Current LeBron is closer to prime MJ than he is to Wizards MJ.</p>

<p>He had no lateral movement, he had no lift, he could barely bend over or get into a low position. Its amazing what he did in hindsight just being essentially an off the dribble jump shooter who relied on timing to get his shot off.</p>

<p>He could still come out and carry a team, but he was very inconsistent and some nights his body was just done.</p>

      <label for="lavqvrr" class="commentText"><p>Jordan broke his ribs before his age 38 season and had torn cartilage in his knee during it, by next season he was completely done physically. Michael is the GOAT and was a psychopathic competitor, but he did not religiously take care of his body like LeBron nor he took games off when he probably needed to, those things combined with his habits off the court made him decline much faster.</p>

<p>When Jordan famously went to a Bulls practice to smoke Corey Benjamin he openly stated how he had none of his game left a year after retiring. To be fair, he had nothing to chase like LeBron does, almost everyone called him the greatest by then and he had done everything a basketball player can do. It&rsquo;s much easier to keep pushing and taking care of yourself when you have a clear goal in mind that you haven&rsquo;t achieved like LeBron.</p>

<p>Totally different playstyle but I&rsquo;d say current Bron is around the level of prime Paul George. Basically right on the fringe of: <em>Is this guy good enough to win a championship as the first option?</em></p>

<p>Basically he&rsquo;s hovering around top 10 in the league as I feel like that&rsquo;s the general cutoff to answer the above question</p>

It was the moment I realized I was smarter than some GM’s.  Even if LeBron steadily declined from 2018 onwards, 1 year of 2017 or 2018 LeBron is better than KAT’s whole career, similar thing for AD (maybe 2 years of LBJ)</p>

<p>If Bronny thrives, great? If he doesn&rsquo;t, leak through Klutch that Bronny just isn&rsquo;t working out in LA/question his commitment and NBA readiness and it&rsquo;s causing problems in the locker room. LeGm&rsquo;s him to another team and then start ramping up the &ldquo;I want to play with my son&rdquo; rhetoric again as bait to get Bronny his extension. Fouls the shit out of him until he retires.

<p>7 years ago he was 12&hellip; if he had grown to almost the same size as his dad instead of barely above 6&rsquo; &hellip; and didn&rsquo;t have a heart attack right before his college season, he would have easily been a 1st round pick. A 6&rsquo;6&rdquo; super athlete, smart passer, good defender&hellip; who&rsquo;s Lebron&rsquo;s kid would have a worst been a 20 something pick.</p>

<p>That half a foot would have made all the difference.</p>

<p>As it is, his younger kid will probably be the only real NBA player of the two (unless Bronny shooting really improves).</p>

<p>I was going to say it might become difficult because Bryce is a bigger talent than Bronny, and there’s a chance he becomes a lottery pick without the nepotism aspect. However, LeBron will obviously be older by that time and might not have enough power to facilitate moves like threatening other teams not to take Bronny in the 2nd</p>

<p>It came from the family themselves like 3-4 years ago iirc. They all said he&rsquo;d be better than Bronny and that he was more skilled for his age and people just ran with it ever since. Bronny was a legitimate top 30 player in his entire class. Maybe he wasn&rsquo;t NBA draft ready but he was really good on his own merit. Bryce is barely a top 50 player at his own position in his class. It&rsquo;s really obvious when people just regurgitate narratives without keeping up with the actual merits of the players.</p>

<p>Bryce is a bigger talent than Bronny</p>

<p>Bronny was a top recruit in his class and one point away from being a 5 star recruit. Bryce is heading into his senior year and is ranked a three star recruit and ESPN has him has the 48th best player at his position and not even ranked in the top 100 of his class &ndash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/251631/bryce-james" target="_blank">here</a>. Unless he makes an insane level jump his senior season I do not understand what talent you are seeing that the scouts seem to be missing. I have watched both of them play in full games and saying things like Bryce is more athletic lets me know you have not. Having better size does not mean its a given you will develop into a better talent</p>
