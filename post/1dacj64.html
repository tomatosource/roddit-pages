</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I’m not a Mavs or Celtics fan but just to be clear I have the Celtics in 5, give or take a game. That being said the adjustment I think the Mavs should make is the following. Celtics have shown they can switch pretty much everything action without needing to send help most of the time, this completely stagnated the Mavs offense and forced them to play 1v1. Luka and Kyrie average 1 PPP in the regular season and playoffs in pure iso which would rank below the worst offense in the NBA regular season and they are playing 4 of the best perimeter defenders in the league so this is not a viable strategy for success. The adjustment I would make and expect is to run RAM screens (a screen where a player receives an off-ball screen then sets a ballscreen). I’d run this by using Porzingus’s man to set the screen on the player guarding the Mavs big, then have the Big sprint into the P&amp;R with Luka, if executed correctly the defender guarding the Big will be late on the switch forcing Luka’s man to have to try to fight over, concede a shot, or not be able to switch. Dallas has run action similar to this with their set “RAM 77 exit” (a ram screen leading to a double drag screen with an exit screen on the backside).</p>

<p>Just to clarify the Mavs don’t need to run this exact play below I’m just showing they do run RAM screens on occasion.</p>

<p>A link to the play: <a href="https://youtu.be/L7xbMPKGWeA?si=WlC2XDW8DRJ_slq-" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/L7xbMPKGWeA?si=WlC2XDW8DRJ_slq-</a></p>

<p>All kidding aside, great content. Wish we had more of this.</p>

<p>My opinion is that the Mavs need more speed on the court, and let the speedy guys (Kyrie, Hardy) get switched onto Horford or Porzingis and run by them to create an advantage. Celtics help D is still very good, but it should lead to better shots or lobs if the big man is on the perimeter.</p>

      <label for="l7jndhb" class="commentText"><p>If you rewatch the film you’ll see Boston stays home on corner 3s but to involve Porzingis in the action they need to take the corner 3 guys out of the corners and up top to set the screen which allow to ignore them because they don’t shoot well above the break. The strategy I listed keeps Porzingus from helping as easily without giving up a corner 3</p>

<p>This works against most teams because they&rsquo;re so paranoid of Luka that they always want a guy in help position, whereas the Celtics are totally fine playing him 1v1 all game.</p>

      <label for="l7jmrel" class="commentText"><p>It’s not about drawing away exactly it’s a play to punish switches. Let’s say Porzingis is on PJ and he sets the screen on Tatum then goes and spaces at the corner 3 Porzingis wouldn’t help in that situation because he doesn’t want to leave the corner 3. Tatum would be late on the switch and Lively Gafford would be able to set the screen for Luka and roll.</p>

RAM action is used to get the switch defender to be late on the switch forcing the on ball defender to help longer or give up a shot, by itself it’s run in hopes the defense is in a switch scheme. The 77 action will get you a switch, usually most teams switch the initial action and let the big play base coverage, typically the 2nd screen is the roller. I’m not calling for 77.</p>

As I said in the end of my original post the clip was included to show the Mavs do actually run RAM it’s not that I’m calling for them to run RAM 77, just RAM to make the switches harder. Apologies if it’s confusing, hard for me to know how much I should explain when talking to non NBA guys.</p>

      <label for="l7kg9zj" class="commentText"><p>People aren’t being confused. They’re just disagreeing. I understand the action you’re saying they should use or that you expect they’ll use. We’re all just saying we don’t think it works, because the Celtics have long and fast guys who play defense well. On several of the examples in your video the offense worked because the defense was awful.</p>

<p>The nurkic one was especially glaring. He just stood there after the kick out. Horford and KP aren’t doing that. Also, dame being abused like others pointed out. The mavericks are already familiar with the RAM screen concept obviously, as shown in your video, and they didn’t have any success or attempts with it in game one for a reason.</p>

      <label for="l7kn520" class="commentText"><p>I’m having a hard time believing you understand me because you keep misunderstanding my original post. The video is not an example of the RAM screen as a main action, the main action in the video is 77 (double drag). I included the video because it shows the Mavs are familiar with running RAM action albeit for a different set. Mavs are familiar with the play RAM 77 Exit doesnt mean they drill RAM action by itself. This is not the type of adjustment you try in the middle of the game, if you don’t run it (RAM 77 exit does not = RAM). It’s a game to game adjustment. Hence why people like myself exist in the NBA to point out play options based on film. A flee flicker is not the same as a run play in football. Hopefully that clears some of it up for you.</p>

<p>I will suggest opting for over-explaining if the purpose is clarity, but dramatically under-explaining if the purpose is only &ldquo;engagement&rdquo;/comments. In spaces like r/nbadiscussion or r/nbatalk, you can get away with a modicum of base-level knowledge of actions. Even though there are some really well-informed posters and commenters here, many folks (especially during the playoffs) will be somewhat more in the casual realm and never even consider that an off-ball screen could impact the play.</p>

<p>Even though I think that showing these Mavs personnel have used ram screens was useful, I also believe that consistently showing that in a double drag set threw folks off. Lots of comments getting caught up in the double drag of it all. If a second video just showing a basic ram screen that involves more of a spread result (maybe something the Hawks have run?) to show the help defenders getting stuck to their guys and the ballhandler working in space was added, it might help.</p>

      <label for="l7ksn06" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I absolutely get where you were coming from, and I think it is useful being able to show that some of these players and this coaching staff have involved ram screens in sets already (because even though these are the top-tier of basketball players, it might not be a good idea to introduce something completely new that they&rsquo;ve never used in a competitive setting in the Finals.) It probably doesn&rsquo;t help too much at this point, but I did try to quickly pull up a video that highlights different ways ram screening can be used for other commenters who might be curious, and wound up coming across one that has the Celtics (from a couple seasons back) defending it:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/lL2Q4x8R914?t=194" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/lL2Q4x8R914?t=194</a></p>

<p>And I think this is actually a decent window into how the current Celtics squad might be able to counter being abused by ram screens. I could absolutely see the Mavs getting a run going with it. But once Boston has a chance to adjust (whether in game or after a film session), one of their superpowers recently has been really effective pre-switching. I know Marcus Smart isn&rsquo;t there, but Jrue and White have some similar qualities, so if they are seeing too many ram screens, they might switch whoever they think can best navigate the off-ball screen into the action and try to keep it from getting to be a problem. Though there&rsquo;s the obvious note that then, that might disrupt their defensive setup that was so effective in game one, so maybe that is enough to count it as an overall positive for them. Who really knows until we see it actually happen in games?</p>

      <label for="l7kuzc0" class="commentText"><p>Ya I think it’s a good strategy to try, not something that works for long stretches, biggest issue with using it is if the initial screen doesn’t get the roll man separation then you’re down 5 sec of shot clock at least. This is why I said I had the Celtics winning, just wanted to provide an adjustment the Mavs could make, outside of the useless they will “shoot better” next game without any reasoning as to why.</p>

      <label for="l7kr458" class="commentText"><p>yesh the celtics basically have a better Dort in Jrue, who was really the only obstacle Luka faced with any difficulty through the west. And the role players can&rsquo;t step up to fill the gap they did iN OKC since the people after Dort are still Tatum, Brown, White, and Porzingis. There is just a total iron wall around anything happening in half court sets and unless Kyrie, DJJ, and PJ really really really step it up and allow playmaking lanes for Luka to decongest this series is going to feel miserable.</p>

<p>Luka himself needs to be better about adjusting the court when he doesn&rsquo;t have the ball in his hands, but that&rsquo;s not a way he&rsquo;s ever played, and if he&rsquo;s gonna figure it out it&rsquo;s the kind of shift that happens in 2 years and not 2 days. If he wants to get past the suffocating traps he&rsquo;s being put in during half court he&rsquo;s gonna need to find a way to shift towards a more Steph style, and in transition sets he needs to be more like Haliburton. The reality is that his own style of heavy finesse bullyball requires the playing weight he&rsquo;s at, along with the slower pace of play necessary to make it work (and not exhaust him.) There&rsquo;s just no possible way for that to be solved in the timespan of a single series, so unless it&rsquo;s the non-Luka players adjusting or just outrught playing better, the mavs are not going to find success.</p>

<p>all that said, even if they manage to really ramp up the pace of play like the pacers did, they also have to shoot like the pacers, and the celtics have to not shoot like the celtics.  That&rsquo;s a lot to hope for. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s nuance the mavs will find in the film room to adjust, but they just look completely outmatched in every way, and Brown and Tatum look significantly more composed and ready for the moment than they did against the warriors. When the mavs brought it down to 8 and the game felt interesting again, they just immediately took it in to their own hands and the lead popped right back up to 20 in less than 3 minutes.</p>

<p>I think game 2 they should look better with more time to prepare with a different scheme. That should let them come up with some wrinkles the Celtics are less used to dealing with which should help.</p>

Unfortunately for the Mavs, Al was vintage on defense, their shooters were ice cold, and the Celts got an iron curtain around the rim for the attacks off a close out.</p>

<p>Vintage Al probably won&rsquo;t show twice in a roll and Mavs should be way better behind the arc.</p>

      <label for="l7kamtu" class="commentText"><p>It’s not vintage Al, this is just still the defense Al provides night in and night out. He’s still an elite perimeter defending big. He gets a lot more shit than he deserves because defenses frequently target him because when the other options are Holiday, White, Brown and Tatum, going at the big on the perimeter is still usually your best option unless even if that big is a great defender in his own right.</p>

<p>I’m sure Luka won’t be as disrupted by it next time though. Even elite bigs on the perimeter aren’t able to consistently shut Luka down like that, he’s going to get his. It’ll just be because Luka makes it happen more than Al not playing as well though.</p>

DJJ is not nearly the threat at the rim or in the short roll that Lively is. If Mavs are able to get the Celtics big on Lively before he screens for Luka or Kai then it opens up the offense a bit more.</p>

<p>Overall it just felt like they lacked creativity with their actions and also needed a game to wake up and realize this is the Finals. I expect Lively, Kyrie and their shooters to be much better all around next game.</p>

      <label for="l7jmqrh" class="commentText"><p>Mavs need to make a pretty big adjustment on defense, too. Obviously letting KP switch onto smaller defenders is a problem. If the game was going differently he probably plays more than 20 minutes and Celts prob score more points. But I think the bigger adjustment is honestly doubling Tatum less on drives. The number of open looks that started with Tatum initiating and drawing a help defender, leading to a drive and kick that put the Mavs in rotation, leading to another swing pass or two and an open look was insane. It was basically the entire first half and that’s what kick-started them again once Dallas cut the lead in the 3rd. The Celtics are happy to live with Luka in 1-on-1 to not let him find open teammates and Dallas might have to take more of that approach with Tatum. He picked them apart with ease. Celts missed a number of wide open looks from his passes, too.</p>

Works nicely on teams playing drop as the big who drops is screened off. Wouldn’t work as effectively against the Mavs since they switch so much. Veer action would be effective if the Mavs had movement shooters but Luka surprisingly is not that kind of player, he likes to dribble to get into his shot.</p>

<p>The action from the original post is just trying to make the switch defender late on the switch ie: not in position to switch</p>

<p>Outside of crunch time, the offense wants you to double or blitz so they can play 4-5 and get a corner three.</p>

<p>If you don’t double they want you to over help out of the corners to get you in rotation.</p>

<p>I don’t understand why defenses are doing exactly what the offense wants.</p>

<p>Why not play straight up and force superstars to take lower quality shots (this is essentially what Boston did)?</p>

<p>Do you really need to help so much off the corner?</p>

<p>I feel like the good, experienced teams all know the other teams defensive rules and just exploit them to get exactly the shot they want.</p>

<p>I get it if you are down and want to speed the game up but otherwise it seems like playing straight up (even if it means giving up a bad matchup on a switch) is what leads to the contested shots you want the other team to take and the other stuff leads to the offense getting what they want.</p>

<p>What am I missing?</p>

      <label for="l7kwsou" class="commentText"><p>Basketball is a very complicated sport, as much as r/nba and espn commentators would have to believe it’s far more complicated than regular fans understand.</p>

<p>For a simple answer to your question teams usually don’t have enough plus defenders to play guys straight up. They usually have to help and end up in rotation. Teams also run action away from the ball to get into advantages. Awful coaching on YouTube does a good job of basic stuff for the casual fan. Even his content is not at the level of people who get paid by the NBA. There are truly levels when it comes to basketball knowledge</p>

      <label for="l7ku47e" class="commentText"><p>This is one thing.</p>

<p>They can also run more Kyrie screens on Luka. Either Luka goes at Jrue or Kyrie gets to work away from Jrue. Obviously it’s not entirely a bigger advantage but they need to get Kyrie going and taking Jrue out is a good step in that direction.</p>

<p>Second is they should go to PJ whenever he has White down low.</p>

<p>Third is Mavs should try to run more to try and get easier shots faster for DJJ. It’s a better proposition than DJJ trying to make something happen against a set boston defense.</p>

<p>All in all they need to generate more paint points. They got blocked a lot last night so im sure the Mavs would watch film and look for better angles of attack but they shouldnt get discouraged from attacking the paint. Mostly, Kyrie needs a great series if they’re gonna win this</p>

<p>We typically lose game 1s anyway. We&rsquo;re 1-6 in Game 1s under Kidd and we lose them by an average of 12.4 points. The lone exception was Minnesota and we beat them by 3. We haven&rsquo;t lost back to back games since March though so I expect a bounce back from everyone.</p>

There is alot of pressure, they are being guarded 1v1 by some great defenders and its just generally hard. What needs to happen is Ky needs to be better and Luka need to forcefully open up the way for the role players by playing better.</p>

<p>Corner looks are highest % 3s in the game and these role players are being forced to make catch and shoots above the break (lower % look, easier to rotate to, and frequency of game reps is different).</p>

<p>It makes sense less shots are falling.</p>

<p>The discussion here is basically how to mitigate that issue, and not “shoot better”.</p>
