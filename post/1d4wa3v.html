Before that, he had been operating for 17 years with the FBI having very little idea or leads to his identity.</p>

<p>From his own words…</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“From several people I’ve received letters concerning that Discovery Channel series about me, and it’s clear from their letters that the Discovery series is even worse than most of the other media stories about me. In fact, the greater part of it is pure fiction. Among other things, they apparently passed on to their viewers the tale through the agency of Harvard professor H. A. Murray I was repeatedly “tortured” as part of the an “MK-Ultra” mind-control program conducted by the CIA.</p>

<p>The truth is that in the course of the Murray study there was one and only one unpleasant experience. It lasted about half an hour and could not have been described as “torture” even in the loosest sense of the word. Mostly the Murray study consisted of interviews and the filling-out of pencil-and-paper personality tests. The CIA was not involved.”</p>

<p>edit: I read the wikipedia page on the phrase, and while the earliest use is have-eat, eat-have was the more common variation until about 100 years ago when it switched back to have-eat. The page has a list of reasons why one is incorrect and the other is not, but they all hinge upon a specific reading of the phrase that is not exclusively implied by the phrase itself, so I still think both are correct. Also to spite ted kaczynski who was, as you may know, an asshole</p>

The correct way means: if you eat that cake, then it’s gone. You won’t have it anymore. You can’t eat your cake and have it too.</p>

<p>Noooo! That is exactly what the people above are going over. First guy says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“have your cake and eat it too”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is replied to with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can&rsquo;t eat your cake and have it too</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second one is the correct phrase because you <em>can</em> &ldquo;have something and [then] also use it&rdquo; which you said cannot be done. You cannot however use/consume something so that it becomes no longer what it was and still have it afterwards. It is all about the ordering of the actions! And yes, this <em>is</em> a hill I&rsquo;m OK dying on because it bothers me to no end when people say it the wrong way just like when people say &ldquo;I could care less&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t care less&rdquo; sometimes saying a phrase wrong gives it the exact opposite meaning.</p>

<p>Your second sentence almost has it though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like you can either eat the cake or <del>have</del> keep the actual cake, but you can’t <del>do both</del> eat it and <em>still</em> have it</p>

<p>The FBI didn&rsquo;t catch him.  And even if they did, 17 years is pretty damn pathetic given the resources put into the case.  In fact, the FBI fought internally over the decision to print the manifesto.  Many in the FBI were opposed to doing so.</p>

<p>I really like Ted&rsquo;s story because he exposes just how incompetent police really are.  Your life is full of fictional crime stories.  The vast majority of &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; are caught because they brag to other criminals, who sell them out for lighter sentences when they&rsquo;re caught in a different crime.  Not because police detectives &ldquo;crack the case&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not one to defend police, but you&rsquo;re basing this on practically nothing. There wasn&rsquo;t overwhelming evidence pointing to one person, one cause, or one specific group. You had a country of 200 million people, a single witness who had only caught a glimpse of the guy in disguise, and very little to go on. This guy was a genius who lived off the grid in solitude and only mailed or planted his bombs without witnesses, the materials he used weren&rsquo;t very traceable either.</p>

<p>Because they thought his writings might influence others and create possible copycats, brain genius. They did end up making the decision that it was worth it, and it paid off.</p>

<p>idk where they got that idea, none of the academics I know give a shit about grammar until they&rsquo;re submitting for publishing</p>

<p>Edit: Shafi Goldwasser, one of the most stand-out comp sci professors at MIT, had lecture notes that were almost unintelligible (and not for being too complicated, like Erik Demaine&rsquo;s were, they were just written with no concern for grammar at all) when I TA&rsquo;d under her.</p>

<p>35k words with very few grammatical errors could certainly indicate some baseline level of intelligence, ya know, enough to confidently state that you have mastered the english language. 35k words with <strong>no</strong> grammatical errors doesn&rsquo;t indicate any higher intelligence than that, it just makes you extremely neurotic. You don&rsquo;t actually need high intelligence to understand the grammar of your native language, you just need to have paid, like, any attention in school at all. Which I know is a bar many people don&rsquo;t pass.</p>

But I guess the bar is pretty low, considering the Zodiac killer is (less deservingly) held up as another genius and his first cryptograms said this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I like killing people because it is so much fun it is more fun than killing wild game in the forrest because man is the most dangeroue anamal of all to kill something gives me the most thrilling experence it is even better than getting your rocks off with a girl the best part of it is thae when I die I will be reborn in paradice and all the I have killed will become my slaves I will not give you my name because you will try to sloi down or atop my collectiog of slaves for my afterlife ebeorietemethhpiti</p>

Is the Zodiac really considered a &ldquo;genius&rdquo;? If I remember right, a school teacher solved his original cypher pretty quickly, and the last one to be solved was only difficult due to encoding errors.</p>

<p>David then hired a PI to investigate Ted&rsquo;s actions parallel to the Unabomber attacks and find out if it was him before he tipped off the FBI, and with regard to the fact that he did not want a Waco or Ruby Ridge style raid to end up with Ted being killed. He went so far as to hire an attorney to figure out how to contact the FBI to try to figure out how to prevent a violent encounter.</p>

<p>The PI (Susan Swanson), the brother (David Kaczynski), attorney (Tony Bisceglie) and the sister-in-law caught the Unabomber. Not the FBI. The FBI&rsquo;s experts were still arguing about who thought he actually wrote the essay.</p>

      <label for="l6hlv3o" class="commentText"><p>Have some real context, here: In 1996, the eat-have variant played a role in the apprehension of Ted Kaczynski, also known as the Unabomber. In his manifesto, which the terrorist sent to newspapers in the wake of his bombings, Kaczynski advocated the undoing of the industrial revolution, writing: &ldquo;As for the negative consequences of eliminating industrial society — well, you can’t eat your cake and have it too.&rdquo; James R. Fitzgerald, an FBI forensic linguist, noted the then-uncommon variant of the proverb and later discovered that Kaczynski had also used it in a letter to his mother. This, among other clues, led to his identification and arrest.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&hellip; a George S. Patton quote about &ldquo;the purple-pissin&rsquo; Japanese&rdquo;, a quote which Hanssen was fond of repeating. The FBI had paid a Russian agent $7 million for the KGB&rsquo;s file on the American mole - known to the KGB at the time only as Ramon Garcia. The file included a note of the mole about &ldquo;purple-pissing Japanese&rdquo; and Robert Hanssen became the prime suspect in the investigation. The FBI arrested Hanssen three months after receiving the file.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.</p></li>

<li><p>The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy.</p></li>

<li><p>If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later.</p></li>

<li><p>We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can’t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society.</p></li>

      <label for="l6hz1c5" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, forensic linguistics is right up there with body language analysis and polygraph examinations as a pseudoscience, it&rsquo;s an empty exercise in confirmation bias. It&rsquo;s too subjective for even lifelong practitioners to come up with consistent conclusions based on the same materials, it&rsquo;s all spectacle.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a clumsy cudgel applied to gullible suspects and informants that gets thrown right out the window as soon as prosecution starts because every prosecutor knows it won&rsquo;t stand up to anything like the Daubert standard or a Frye test.</p>

<p>I thought the TV series was laughably inept in their attempts to glamorize it&hellip; even within their generous fictionalization, a sane analysis makes it plain that it brought no value to the investigation. The whole time they were just pointlessly spinning their wheels until someone who knew him pointed the investigators his way.</p>

Sure enough, the initial thread that led to his capture was a reference he made to a killing in Montgomery, AL.</p>

<p>When everybody was into the show CSI, I had a hard time with it because they would solve crimes by analyzing the blood from a dead mosquito at the murder scene and that was nothing like what we experienced with Kaczynski and Malvo.</p>

      <label for="l6hhs2w" class="commentText"><p>One of my favorite &ldquo;Bring down the badguy&rdquo; stories comes down to this.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Le_Roux" target="_blank">Paul Le Roux</a> started off as a software developer, but couldn&rsquo;t make a go of it.  At the beginning of the 2000s he founds an online pharmacy portal, right in time to capitalize on the opioid epedemic.</p>

<ul>
<li>People log on and put in their prescription needs.</li>
<li>A doctor reviews the &lsquo;script.</li>
<li>Local pharmacies fill them for the customer</li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s brilliant and starts scaling in large part because Le Roux is a great problem solver.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pharmacy:  Is this legit?</li>
<li>Le Roux:  Sure is, call this retired DEA guy I know in Florida (not actually ex-DEA)</li>
<li>Pharmacy:  Some people are asking to ship these, how do I do that?</li>
<li>Le Roux:  Use this Fedex account, we&rsquo;ll just deduct it from the monthly check</li>
<li>Pharmacy:  We&rsquo;re getting too many calls</li>
<li>Le Roux:  I set up a 1-800 number, you won&rsquo;t get any more.</li>
</ul>

<p>His network grows to hundreds of pharmacies sending out drugs, most of them controlled.  He moves to the Philippines and now he starts to branch out, gets into precious metal smuggling, arms dealing and money laundering.  Dude is a certified kingpin and covers his tracks at every turn.</p>

<p>Then some pencil pusher in a windowless office notices a tiny pharmacy ordering more drugs than makes sense.  They get a search warrant for their records, and among them get access to the Fedex account La Roux gave to all his pharmacies.  It shows every pharmacy he works with and hundreds of thosands of dolloars of activity.  And because he used this so early on, it&rsquo;s got his real name on it.</p>

<p>An enormous cartel falls and after luring him to <del>Brazil</del> Liberia (who will extradite to the US), they get Le Roux.</p>

<p>A hundred million dollar empire brought down by a fedex account.</p>

      <label for="l6if6f0" class="commentText"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski#Psychological_study" target="_blank">Kaczynski wasn&rsquo;t involved in those experiments.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In his second year at Harvard, Kaczynski participated in a study described by author Alston Chase as a &ldquo;purposely brutalizing psychological experiment&rdquo; led by Harvard psychologist Henry Murray. Subjects were told they would debate personal philosophy with a fellow student and were asked to write essays detailing their personal beliefs and aspirations. The essays were given to an anonymous individual who would confront and belittle the subject in what Murray himself called &ldquo;vehement, sweeping, and personally abusive&rdquo; attacks, using the content of the essays as ammunition.[20] Electrodes monitored the subject&rsquo;s physiological reactions. These encounters were filmed, and subjects&rsquo; expressions of anger and rage were later played back to them repeatedly.[20] The experiment lasted three years, with someone verbally abusing and humiliating Kaczynski each week.[21][22] Kaczynski spent 200 hours as part of the study.[23]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.deadlinedetroit.com/articles/19050/retired_fbi_agent_the_unabomber_and_i_agree_--_tv_series_is_inaccurate" target="_blank">Kaczynski himself denied that he was tortured.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>From several people I’ve received letters concerning that Discovery Channel series about me, and it’s clear from their letters that the Discovery series is even worse than most of the other media stories about me. In fact, the greater part of it is pure fiction. Among other things, they apparently passed on to their viewers the tale through the agency of Harvard professor H. A. Murray I was repeatedly “tortured” as part of the an “MK-Ultra” mind-control program conducted by the CIA.</p>

<p>The truth is that in the course of the Murray study there was one and only one unpleasant experience. It lasted about half an hour and could not have been described as “torture” even in the loosest sense of the word. Mostly the Murray study consisted of interviews and the filling-out of pencil-and-paper personality tests. The CIA was not involved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, the common misconception is that the CIA brainwashed him into wanting to kill everyone. In reality, he was like &ldquo;leftism is a mental illness&rdquo;, and they responded with &ldquo;LeFTIsm Is A meNtal iLLness, that&rsquo;s what you sound like dumbass&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I know this might be hard for some people to swallow, but not every mass murdering maniac suffers from mental illness. Some of them are simply right wing nutjobs.</p>

You shouldn&rsquo;t spread information of how to commit murder successfully via TV shows. That&rsquo;s an actual problem.
So all shows show cases which are solvable or they use better solving methods then the investigators actually have because: the law always wins.</p>

<p>Anyway, I am not American, hearing from the DC sniper(s) the first time. Just checked wiki.
Wild stuff.  I would have been in terror. Sorry that you had to live through that.</p>

<p>They’ll offer uniforms, set locations, and police extras on set. It’s not like they’re producers, but that stuff adds up. Much like the DoD, this also leads to the lending being contingent on giving a more favorable image. The DoD just requires that if corruption is shown, it’s individual and not systemic. Police forces on the other hand, see it as a way to bump their PR and improve the trust people have in police solving crimes. Corruption is shown as taking bribes from the mob and compartmentalized, not covering for each other when someone accidentally t-bones a civilian while the officer is off duty, drinking and driving</p>

<p>50% of murders go unsolved. However in CSI and the like you’ll have shit like that mosquito blood. And the viewers feel good when an officer “goes rogue” to get the bad guy.</p>

They published it with the message urging anyone reading it to call them if they knew who the author potentially may be. Ted’s brother saw it in the paper, recognized it may be his writing and contacted authorities who then were able to link him to the crimes and capture him.</p>

<p>He was also a product of the MKULTRA experiments they did at Harvard. He went on to teach Math at Berkeley (some have suggested he might be the Zodiac killer as well due to the time periods he was in California, although I believe this has been discounted now).</p>

<p>He had then quit to go live in a cabin in the woods and be very antiestablishment. He would write his manifesto and go on to commit his crimes. His manifesto, in hindsight, is correct about a lot of our society’s issues, but his solutions are non-sensical, scattered, incoherent, or worse. The man had a really high IQ.</p>

<p>As long as one puts aside the parts in which which he instead rants incoherently about &ldquo;leftists&rdquo; and &ldquo;feminists&rdquo; and so forth. And even so, the parts that are right (or, at least, interesting enough to be worth discussing) were not novel.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like he was the first person in the world to criticize aspects of modern society; and many others who did that were more insightful and better writers (which is part of why, you know, they did <em>not</em> need to commit acts of terrorism to try to get people to read and discuss their ideas, not that they would have done that anyway).</p>

<p>His manifesto is from 1995; and just to mention one example among many, Murray Bookchin&rsquo;s writings (mostly from the 1970s and 1980s) were intellectually so far above it that it&rsquo;s ridiculous to even mention them in the same sentence.</p>

<p>Ted wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;correct,&rdquo; because Ted didn&rsquo;t have any special insight to speak of.  He was just another edgy cynic with a god complex and an incredibly myopic view of history and the human condition.  You don&rsquo;t have to be brilliant to see that the world is shit, but it does take a special kind of dumbass to be convinced that you are the sole arbiter of some mythical regressive utopia.</p>

<p>You aren&rsquo;t living in the same time period.  What are &ldquo;easily observable facts&rdquo; to you were not easily observable facts in 1985.

      <label for="l6hgwmq" class="commentText"><p>I mean it&rsquo;s pretty weird, here is the section on it from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In his second year at Harvard, Kaczynski participated in a study described by author Alston Chase as a &ldquo;purposely brutalizing psychological experiment&rdquo; led by Harvard psychologist Henry Murray. Subjects were told they would debate personal philosophy with a fellow student and were asked to write essays detailing their personal beliefs and aspirations. The essays were given to an anonymous individual who would confront and belittle the subject in what Murray himself called &ldquo;vehement, sweeping, and personally abusive&rdquo; attacks, using the content of the essays as ammunition.[20] Electrodes monitored the subject&rsquo;s physiological reactions. These encounters were filmed, and subjects&rsquo; expressions of anger and rage were later played back to them repeatedly.[20] The experiment lasted three years, with someone verbally abusing and humiliating Kaczynski each week.[21][22] Kaczynski spent 200 hours as part of the study.[23]</p>

<p>Kaczynski&rsquo;s lawyers later attributed his hostility towards mind control techniques to his participation in Murray&rsquo;s study.[20] During the Second World War, Murray had worked with the Office of Strategic Services, a U.S. intelligence agency often referred to as the predecessor to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), where he conducted psychological experiments.[24] Some sources have suggested that Murray&rsquo;s experiments were part of Project MKUltra, the CIA&rsquo;s program of research into mind control.[25][26] Chase and others have also suggested that this experience may have motivated Kaczynski&rsquo;s criminal activities.[27][28] Kaczynski stated he resented Murray and his co-workers, primarily because of the invasion of his privacy he perceived as a result of their experiments. Nevertheless, he said he was &ldquo;quite confident that [his] experiences with Professor Murray had no significant effect on the course of [his] life&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Ted Kaczinsk:</p>

<p>“From several people I’ve received letters concerning that Discovery Channel series about me, and it’s clear from their letters that the Discovery series is even worse than most of the other media stories about me. In fact, the greater part of it is pure fiction. Among other things, they apparently passed on to their viewers the tale through the agency of Harvard professor H. A. Murray I was repeatedly “tortured” as part of the an “MK-Ultra” mind-control program conducted by the CIA.</p>

<p>The truth is that in the course of the Murray study there was one and only one unpleasant experience. It lasted about half an hour and could not have been described as “torture” even in the loosest sense of the word. Mostly the Murray study consisted of interviews and the filling-out of pencil-and-paper personality tests. The CIA was not involved.”</p>

<p>Yeah his view on how the world was progressing with both industrialization and big business itself were pretty spot on. For his time he was pretty radical. But if he were alive today(without the bombings) he would be online giving a TED talk.</p>

<p>The BTK serial killer was fond of taunting police and craved attention. At one point, he asked the police via letter if they would be able to track him down if he sent a floppy disk with his writings/manifesto to the press. The police responded via newspaper that no, they couldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>After BTK sent the floppy disk to a TV news station, the police used software to recover a deleted file on the floppy disk &ndash; a Word document, with metadata that linked the file to a computer owned by &ldquo;Christ Lutheran Church&rdquo;, and last edited by &ldquo;Dennis&rdquo;. Shortly thereafter, Dennis Rader was identified as the killer and arrested.</p>

      <label for="l6hq3tr" class="commentText"><p>The amount of misinformation about the Unabomber designed to turn him into some sort of anti-mordernist folk hero is really infursting.</p>

<p>People get hung up about the him being a genius mathematics prodigy forgetting  he then quite before making substansive contributions to the field and became a creepy proto-incel.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no real original insight in his manifesto and especially not in the banal way people summarise it( mordern technology has drawbacks), something readily apparent and raised by a multitude of far more astute thinkers and writers.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also this endless parade of people claiming he was a product of the MKUlTRA experiment which isn&rsquo;t true, he took part in a psychological study run by Henry Murray who was previously involved with the OSS; but the actual study had nothing to do the CIA. Even the man himself admitted while they were unpleasant had little formative impact on him.</p>

      <label for="l6hu4il" class="commentText"><p>I read his book, Technological Slavery, and he comes across as an Edward Abbey ripoff. There&rsquo;s a hopelessness in his writing, but his thoughts were relatively well-organized. The idea that he was a crazed lunatic was probably a product of Saturday Night Live more than a reflection of reality. He was an intelligent and sane man who was angry and came up with an original and horrifying solution to a real problem that has been discussed since the dawn of the industrial revolution.</p>

      <label for="l6htz45" class="commentText"><p>I mean most of his stupid little manifesto was clearly ripped off from earlier writers and I think that was the point. It was a summary of thought from decades ago before we knew what these technological innovations would do to society.</p>
