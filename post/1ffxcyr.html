<p>Stinks for us, but I do understand why he made the decision he did. Thanks for everything Nico!</p>

      <label for="lmyexjp" class="commentText"><p>Consistency was also an issue with Batum when he was young though. At least that was a common criticism. I absolutely love Nic Batum, but when he was a young Blazer, fans would get frustrated because one night he&rsquo;d have an incredible game, super impactful, big numbers, looking like an all-star, and then the next night he&rsquo;d be really passive and end up with like 6 pts and 3 rebounds.</p>

<p>I think there is a bit of truth to him being inconsistent, but I also think that&rsquo;s because he doesn&rsquo;t force things or try to play beyond his role. He&rsquo;s an excellent role player though, who does tons of little things well, every night. Definitely a great team player.</p>

      <label for="lmzfgfr" class="commentText"><p>Batum was on a french podcast this week. He thinks he is one of the most &ldquo;European&rdquo; players in the NBA in terms of play style and mentality. Some coaches asked him to play like an American, to be someone he is not, but it never worked even though he was really trying to do what was expected.
We&rsquo;re often talking about how the game of a player will translate, but the question is maybe more: &ldquo;Will his future team know how to use players with european play style?&rdquo;. I think that a reason why euro players got big ups and downs during their career.
A good example was Boris Diaw. He was a great player, in the discussion for 2014 finals MVP, but he needed the right team to perform.</p>

      <label for="ln06ft5" class="commentText"><p>I totally agree, and was actually going to mention Diaw until I got to your 2nd to last sentence. Batum reminds of Diaw, in the sense that they both always elevated the games of guys around them. And they also both play with a lot of finesse. Diaw was great. I’m not really sure why that style seems to come from France, or Europe, but I sure wish there were more players like that in the league.</p>

      <label for="ln1n0cv" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s really a french thing. Maybe you got this feeling because there&rsquo;s a lot of french players in the league atm. I think we can tell the same about Spanish players, or east european players.</p>

<p>Remember 2008 olympics finals, the level of the spanish team was crazy. And I dont think it was only because of FIBA rules and team chemistry. They were individually very good. Why did so few have a great NBA career?</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not a hall of famer caliber player, so good that you will succeed whatever the situation you&rsquo;re in (Jokic, Nowitzki, Wemby, Gasol, &hellip;) it&rsquo;s very hard to get the career you deserve. I think that is the reason why there&rsquo;s so many european players in the top tier of the league and so few in the second tier.</p>

<p>NBA teams have a lot of progress to make in terms of scooting, drafting, and coaching euro players. Maybe they should hire more european assistant coaches.</p>

<p>In cryptography, RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4, also known as ARC4 or ARCFOUR, meaning Alleged RC4, see below) is a stream cipher. While it is remarkable for its simplicity and speed in software, multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in RC4, rendering it insecure.</p>

      <label for="lmy6y4n" class="commentText"><p>Yeah - in theory they&rsquo;ve got a decent bench, but unfortunately two of them are going to have to start.  You can get away with one of Oubre or Martin starting, but not both.  And if any of the top 3 get injured, the 8 man rotation gets ugly fast.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re definitely one solid piece away from being a contender.</p>

      <label for="lmyse62" class="commentText"><p>I think they’re deeper than 3, but I agree depth is the weakness.</p>

<p>I really like the guard rotation with Maxey, Martin, Lowry, EG, and Council. Oubre likes to play minutes here too and defends guards well</p>

<p>C rotation is great with Embiid and Drummond</p>

<p>Forward is the problem. George is fantastic of course, and then you’ve got Oubre who’s a solid piece. Martin likes to spend minutes at forward to round it out a bit, but that’s really it. No one knows what Yabu is bringing to the table, no one knows if KJ Martin is any good.</p>

<p>Batum was the perfect missing piece. Best post entry passer in maybe the entire league, knocks down open 3s from Embiid, and still solid on defense. He would’ve tied this whole thing together</p>

      <label for="lmypkyv" class="commentText"><p>This was the biggest hit for the Sixers. Batum was the best post entry passer Embiid has ever had by a mile, one of the best in the league, and drained open 3s. His defense was still good too.</p>

<p>As silly as it sounds given his age, I’d be significantly more confident in our roster if he were still here. Just the perfect fit with Joel and a good fit in general with other guys. With how good he was last year for us, a PG/Batum/Embiid frontcourt would’ve gone crazy</p>

<p>I understand he made the choice for family, but damn does it suck to lose a guy like that. Maybe there’s some hope for a deadline return or something? Just grind it out for a few months and then head back to LA again lol</p>
