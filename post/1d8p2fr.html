      <label for="l77qk0g" class="commentText"><p>That wouldn&rsquo;t matter in this scenario of Edwards Gobert PNR getting blitzed high because in this scenario Gobert is catching the ball no matter what. It&rsquo;s on him to dump it off or attack which he constantly fumbles around doing both his entire career. Not to mention if he does try to attack and finish off blitz all you have to do is have any player of any size tag him to disrupt. Can&rsquo;t make decisions effectively, can&rsquo;t punish mismatches, these are flaws that have always been in Gobert&rsquo;s career offensively.</p>

<p>In this clip Lively instantly finds the right man on 3 pt line while Gobert will pick up the ball and DHO so he can get rid of it</p>

      <label for="l77whd7" class="commentText"><p>He wouldn’t be open after blitzing and if you try to force an outlet to him, the defense would have time to recover. Kyrie is irrelevant to this convo on how to defend Luka’s PnR unless you are talking about a guard PnR which I don’t think would be that favorable given how many great perimeter defenders the Celtics have.</p>

<p>I agree on Minnesota’s offensive limitations but that’s not really applicable here. This is all about quicken decision making from Lively or Gafford on the short roll if the Celtics decide to blitz.</p>

      <label for="l77ywio" class="commentText"><p>Kyrie is very relevant to the convo on how to defend Luka overall. That’s an incredibly dumb point you just made to say he’s “irrelevant”, you’ve lost sight of the big picture. You’re trying to big brain this from a tactical Xs and Os perspective and it’s not matching what we saw all playoffs.</p>

<p>First of all Luka draws doubles in many other situations than just the 1-5 PnR.. simple drives and isos/post ups, and Ky plays off him well to attack advantages and close outs.</p>

<p>Second of all he could be one pass away in the 1-5 (we’ve seen lively hit him immediately), but even if he’s two passes away he’s still amazing at attacking a rotating defense. That’s why he’s so dangerous because even if the defense is 80% recovered, if they’re still in motion/chaos he attacks with expert precision and catches them off guard.</p>

<p>He is not however relevant to countering a blitz. It’s not trying to “big brain”, it’s explaining basic fundamental concepts.</p>

<p>All those other scenarios that Luka can score from are great…just not relevant to this post or conversation since it’s literally about 1-5 PnR defense lol</p>

      <label for="l7838l8" class="commentText"><p>He is indirectly relevant and that is completely dependent on the decision making from the big men in the short roll. And in cases where he is “strategically” the first or a second pass off that short roll, I think the Celtics defenders are smart enough to know to still prioritize covering him and not sell out to over contest DJJ or Washington. In other words, the Celtics should still make sure the role players are the ones bring forced to make plays even in rotation if all the preceding decisions made were perfect.</p>

<p>But when talking about how the Mavs/Celtics would handle Luka 1-5 PnRs on each side, Kyrie is not a central part of that discussion…the focus would be on Celtics switching, dropping or blitzing and then in turn how Luka and the rolling big handle each scenario. That’s the important part.</p>

      <label for="l789vxm" class="commentText"><p>Interesting, I think the Celtics ability to really contain Luka depends on Porzingis’s health when on the floor. If he can really move, and confidently cut, hedge, match the quick decelerations of Luka/Kyrie when they put him in actions, then I think Boston can get away with their switching, which they’d prefer to do. if not.., we’ll see. Horford did excellently movement wise I thought vs Indy but Indy also killed them in the mid range with it.</p>

<p>I do think Boston is a really great defensive team to contain Luka tho. Brown is just as strong as he is and will fight hard, and Tatum might be the best “low man” 4 in terms of rotating, rim deterrence, and rebounding in the NBA right now. His presence down low vs Lively and Gafford will be a key X factor as will White’s weak side blocks.</p>

<p>I think DJJ driving will also be interesting. Had a lot of success on straight line drives off kick outs, we’ll see how he does.</p>

<p>expose the few weaknesses that he has</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>being a complete liability on offense is not a small weakness.  Stone hands, lack of shooting, lack of post moves and baffling lack of ability for a 7&rsquo;2 big to free himself for lobs when his teammates are double teamed.</p></li>

<li><p>he had to have KAT switch to guarding Jokic.  I know it&rsquo;s Jokic but he had to switch on a player that plays his position.  That is embarrassing for a 4-time DPOY</p></li>

<li><p>if he switches on guards he looks completely helpless. A 4-time DPOY in this era should be able to put up some resistance on wings or guards.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These weaknesses would be passable for a 15-20 minute valuable bench role player but it kills your team in the playoffs when you&rsquo;re playing 35 mpg deep in the playoffs when teams are exploiting weaknesses over and over again.</p>

Rudy makes the offense better and statistics bare that out. Having the 4 guard Jokic and the rim protector roam has been the strategy against the Nuggets, it&rsquo;s exactly what the Lakers did with AD too. He is absolutely competent on the perimeter and the best perimeter player in the world hitting a big shot over him doesn&rsquo;t negate that. Fucking insane how this dude is being scapegoated after getting to the WCF and then having the two best offensive players on the team completely shit the bed.</p>

      <label for="l784v42" class="commentText"><p>The switch was because Gobert is better as a help defender. It&rsquo;s just a waste to have him guard Jokic straight up. They didn&rsquo;t do it because KAT defends Jokics better 1v1. They did it because their defense is way better when Gobert is able to roam.</p>

<p>He doesn&rsquo;t look completely helpless on the perimeter. He looks like all centers, except maybe 4 or 5 guys.</p>

<p>Blaming Gobert for the Wolves losing to the Mavs is a pretty odd take. The Wolves didn&rsquo;t lose because they &ldquo;exploited&rdquo; Gobert.</p>

      <label for="l78a6qf" class="commentText"><p>Whether he is or isn&rsquo;t is kind of irrelevant in this context. KAT isn&rsquo;t a better one on one defender than Gobert. Also, KAT wasn&rsquo;t guarding Jokic because he&rsquo;s better than Gobert one on one.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like how the Lakers didn&rsquo;t have AD guard Jokic. AD is more effective if he can help. It&rsquo;s definitely not because Rui is a better one on one defender.</p>

      <label for="l7810ep" class="commentText"><p>both are a problem. he&rsquo;s a defensive liability cause he is so reluctant to get on the perimeter and opponents know that. bring his ass up to screen and you either get an open 3 or attack his drop and get deep in the paint</p>

      <label for="l7857es" class="commentText"><p>Literally every center plays drop. Even the centers that are elite at switching, like Bam and AD, played drop. They&rsquo;re much more effective defending the rim and that&rsquo;s where the teams defense wants them to be. If Gobert is a &ldquo;defensive liability,&rdquo; so is every center in the league.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s far from a perfect player but it&rsquo;s crazy that people are blaming him for the loss as if he was the reason why KAT and Ant played so poorly.</p>

      <label for="l788npr" class="commentText"><p>My point is that teams don&rsquo;t have the luxury to &ldquo;switch it up.&rdquo; Also, while those guys are comfortable playing different coverages, they often aren&rsquo;t asked to because it&rsquo;s not as valuable to the team&rsquo;s defense.</p>

<p>Outside of those guys (and maybe 1 or 2 others), there aren&rsquo;t really any other Cs that can defend the perimeter. Sure, Gobert can only play one coverage, but the same goes for almost every team. And he&rsquo;s better than just about everyone else in that one coverage.</p>

<p>Also, Draymond isn&rsquo;t really a C. He can play it (and has been a fantastic small ball C historically), but he didn&rsquo;t play a ton of C right now because of Looney, TJD, and Saric.</p>

<p>I dont wanna hear how Gobert is the best defender in the league when he has a massive exploitable flaw in his game. teams take advantage of it every single postseason</p>

      <label for="l7885pp" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s funny to hear this conversation as a rockets fan because it&rsquo;s essentially a reprise of the Unguardable Tour Harden years. Blitzing was easily the best move on defense because we ran small ball with PJ and Russ as our 5s, and if Russ set the screen the defense just sat back on the short roll so no threat, and if PJ set the screen he just threw the ball out of bounds after receiving the pass.</p>

<p>Dallas gives me faith because they have multiple lob threats, but I&rsquo;m not convinced that Bostons switch everything defense might not be just good enough even if it doesn&rsquo;t nullify Luka completely. I think they start off switching in game 1 and even if they lose, just try to burn Luka out taking 30 shots to start the series. Then go to the blitz if that fails in later games.</p>

<p>Super excited for this series and clashes in play style even though objectively I kinda hate both teams lol</p>

<p>having ben simmons or kawhi wouldn&rsquo;t even matter, the on ball defender isn&rsquo;t even discussed in this clip right? drop coverage, blitz coverage, switching, whatever defense you&rsquo;re running the initial on ball defender doesn&rsquo;t matter because they&rsquo;re taken out of the play by the mavs&rsquo; offensive scheme</p>

The wolves did a good job defensively against the mavs, they didn&rsquo;t try to stop Luka from scoring they tried to take away their most effective plays, the corner 3s, and they succeeded to a degree. But Mavs held up well defensively, and Wolves still lacked the offensive schemes to score at will.
Just like Celtics 2022 let Steph get his and limited everyone else and it worked,  cause they limited the Warriors offensively but they lost cause Warriors were better defensivly, and Celtics offensive engines in Tatum had a horrible series.</p>

Yeah, sure he&rsquo;s shooting 50% from around the free throw line, but that&rsquo;s still way better than giving up a corner three.</p>

<p>The addition of Simone helps with that, but I hope Ausar really works on at least being an average shooter from the corners.</p>
