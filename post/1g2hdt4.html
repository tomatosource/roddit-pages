      <label for="lrogz9n" class="commentText"><p>Ant has so much growing up to do. This glimpse into his life makes me think he‚Äôs the type that when it leaves it leaves fast. I recognize that he‚Äôs only 22-23, but compare him to the others in this and he has the maturity of a middle schooler. Even within the basketball, having to ask Conley what a play is called in the last like 4 games of the season is just embarrassing. I‚Äôll probably get downvoted but the guy feels much closer to a Lavine than an MJ.¬†</p>

<p>It‚Äôs obvious that he is surrounded by a lot of enablers who go along with it because Ant pays the bills.</p>

<p>I think it was supposed to come across as funny but I found it sad as fuck how everyone was coming over for Thanksgiving and he didn‚Äôt want to come off his game and his girlfriend just sat and watched him.</p>

But holy nitpick, that minuscule moment in the series where he asked for the name of a play makes him an immature basketball player?? 50% of episode 9 is about him being a vocal leader for his team in the series against the defending champions. There is no universe where the best player on a team that wins a game 7 after being down 20 points is an immature basketball player lmao</p>

      <label for="lrofhh6" class="commentText"><p>Jimmy storyline was good. Rest was boring as fuck. 70% of the show was just about the players‚Äô families, which I mainly didn‚Äôt gaf about. If you don‚Äôt like Tatum you‚Äôll also hate this. If you wanted it to be like full swing or F1 show, you‚Äôll hate it too because it‚Äôs hardly about the actual season.</p>

      <label for="lroi5vc" class="commentText"><p>Jimmy&rsquo;s Architectural Digest video that dropped last week on youtube is one of the best videos of getting to know an athlete&rsquo;s off court personality I&rsquo;ve ever seen. It&rsquo;s also the best video AD have posted in their house tour series. Jimmy is just a funny dude that doesn&rsquo;t take himself seriously at all.</p>

There&rsquo;s no real value to it, unfortunately. <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> from me, won&rsquo;t even finish it, there are far better shows to watch out there currently.</p>

The contrast between The Starting Five and The Last Dance looks huge so far. It has not come across as a documentary yet. It looks and feels like personality-driven reality TV.

<p>It‚Äôs a reality show, there was no actual script. It just isn‚Äôt interesting to have personal conversations on Netflix</p>

<p>Everything else is bang on tho, as soon as they tried to make me watch jimmy butler give a 20 minute speech about coffee I skipped right to the last episode</p>

<p>Having people do certain things and just filming them, and writing out an entire scene for Jayson tatums 7 year old kid to memorize aren‚Äôt the same thing. But just saying it‚Äôs scripted definitely implies it‚Äôs written out for a specific cast. Sorry if it annoys you that I pointed that out lol</p>

<p>Ant is still a little kid in many ways, lives with his bros, doesn&rsquo;t cook for himself or pack his own suitcase, video games all the time.  Makes his upside even scarier.</p>

<p>Jimmy is just a complete maniac.  A real freak&hellip;you can see his hunger to get the absolute most out of life in his eyes.  The guy is locked in to basketball on every level in a truly Kobe-esque way while also being authentically himself in non-basketball pursuits.</p>

<p>The other 3 guys&rsquo; stories seemed very curated and honestly a bit boring</p>

      <label for="lrp7vlr" class="commentText"><p>I enjoyed it, it&rsquo;s clear that they&rsquo;re trying to reach a broader audience, basically explaining the storylines we all followed through the year. I have a bias toward Tatum&rsquo;s story but I felt like each was interesting in its own way.</p>

<p>Domas&rsquo; was uplifting but a disappointing end, cute family, and seems like a dope dude. Bought snow to BRING TO HIS HOUSE TF?</p>

<p>Bron, big on the family (I get it), legacy, aging, and dude is corny what&rsquo;s new? But that interview at his last game of the season was wild, I totally forgot he got asked that. Savannah is the key.</p>

<p>Ant, this dude&rsquo;s immaturity is nutssssss, he&rsquo;s playing pool while his GF is obviously exhausted and holding his baby and blasts music? It was watching the game while she just gave birth for me. Sick playoff mic&rsquo;d moments though, scary af. 22? Clean up that inner circle big dawg and please grow up safely.</p>

<p>Jimmy, he&rsquo;s the dopest dad, I wish him success but not in the playoffs, but I respect him. Fuck the Heat.</p>

<p>Tatum, that one scene where he&rsquo;s just styling on his son was actually wild, he&rsquo;s corny yeah but like he&rsquo;s the prime candidate to show how helicopter parenting can make you millions. They really don&rsquo;t give this mf a break. The pressure is inside and outside the house. Following his and the Celtic storyline was interesting to see.</p>

<p>It was what I expected and they did a good job with hype playoff videos and music, weirdly edited at times, would rewatch high just for Ant&rsquo;s awkward and embarrassing adulthood for a try not to cringe challenge though.</p>

<p>Why try to contrive some &ldquo;asshole personality&rdquo; to placate talking heads/his dad? BE YOURSELF is better than trying to outwardly project some phony temperament that WILL get immediately called out by media/lockeroom/whoever.</p>

<p>They did fine with it I guess just wished they made it crystal clear. Tatum is a killer on the court and his game does his talking. Trying to please everyone around him by trying to be someone hes not would of only made things ALOT worse for him. He kept his head down and stayed true to who he is and they won a chip in part because of that.</p>

<p>Also wished they showed him shouting out JB alot more, to further dispel future talking head points.</p>

<p>Every time he&rsquo;s on screen you can see his charisma and honesty, it&rsquo;s great to see. Contrast that with LeBron&rsquo;s sort of scripted personality,  Sabonis dullness, Tatum&rsquo;s lack of personality. Only Butler comes close to Edwards.</p>

      <label for="lrof8nb" class="commentText"><p>So I am actually intrigued by lebron and rich clearly pushing their same old talking points at times still, because there is a little hint of desperation to it now. To be clear, I do think lebron does seem more genuine in other moments too. That&rsquo;s the complexity that his decades long stardom brings, and I think Rich being transparently what many people have seen him as (just a narrative pusher for lebron via klutch) is ultimately a miscalculation on his part - which is interesting! Like, the self-awareness is slipping a little for him, he came out of from behind the scenes and is doing too much etc. These guys are aging, and while lebron has long been a tall tale teller and a corny ad man, his authenticity comes through especially during his insecure moments (ex: focusing on &ldquo;everyone says I tell lies online,&rdquo; showing himself rapping every single lyric to a song in his car for once, suddenly leaning into his mysteriously deformed toes lol) like, Lebron - you don&rsquo;t have to address any of that shit lmao. Anyway, it&rsquo;s weird they have this major production feature these weird petty little grievances, and weird that rich thought it&rsquo;d be a good idea to involve himself on screen the way he did.</p>
