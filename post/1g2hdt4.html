      <label for="lrogz9n" class="commentText"><p>Ant has so much growing up to do. This glimpse into his life makes me think he’s the type that when it leaves it leaves fast. I recognize that he’s only 22-23, but compare him to the others in this and he has the maturity of a middle schooler. Even within the basketball, having to ask Conley what a play is called in the last like 4 games of the season is just embarrassing. I’ll probably get downvoted but the guy feels much closer to a Lavine than an MJ. </p>

<p>It’s obvious that he is surrounded by a lot of enablers who go along with it because Ant pays the bills.</p>

<p>I think it was supposed to come across as funny but I found it sad as fuck how everyone was coming over for Thanksgiving and he didn’t want to come off his game and his girlfriend just sat and watched him.</p>

      <label for="lrpg62q" class="commentText"><p>I found it contrived how they kept trying to force this “family man” aspect with him when it was clear the dude couldn’t care less about being a father.  Dude didn’t even take a full game off for the birth of his child… and then spent a chunk of time after her labor ignoring his newborn and watching the rest of the game.</p>

<p>And when you add in all the shit that most of us here already <em>know</em> about some of his off the court shit (“send da video” and all that), it just makes this narrative they were forcing down our throats look even <em>more</em> patronizing.</p>

<p>The man is a child.  Given the sad history of how his mother and grandmother died at an early age for him, it’s at least partially understandable- but don’t try to sell us on him being something he’s clearly not.  He even said himself in one of the interviews, “I have a lot of growing up to do” which is at least a step in the right direction… hopefully.</p>

<p>Even in this doc they’re like “you only ever saw MJ smiling, never told a kid no” there are players who DO fit that description for real, MJ was not one of them lol.</p>

<p>Knowing his situation it’s hard to blame him though. His dad wasn’t around, his mom and his grandma passed at the same time when he was in middle school. He was basically raised by his sister so he went from all of his teenage years with 0 parental guidance straight into the NBA. It’s almost a bit sad when you think about it.</p>

      <label for="lrpyvzs" class="commentText"><p>The show is like barely about basketball honestly, it’s more about the guys but they’d never actually let them get that close so it’s kinda just like eh</p>

<p>Sabonis’ entire storyline was:</p>

<p>-Here’s my hot cheerleader wife and my son</p>

<p>-Damn no all-star</p>

<p>-Damn no playoffs</p>

<p>I mean I should have known when they didn’t even introduce Ant until the last 5 seconds of the first episode as some cliffhanger(?) but they wanted to spend 20 minutes on Lebron and Savannah getting ready for Halloween or something. It gets a bit more interesting during the playoffs when you get to see a bit behind the scenes of more high stake basketball. Theres some things that are great, like being with Ant as he’s running out the stadium in the middle of a game, in the car, all the way into the hospital, to seeing him hold his daughter for the first time, that is absolutely a gem and a great moment to capture. But half the show feels like watered down real housewives of the NBA. Not to keep picking at Sabonis’ part of it but I almost feel like his wife had more screen time than him.</p>

      <label for="lrpyhx5" class="commentText"><p>These kinda shows aren’t made for us. They don’t give a fuck if any nba fans tune in. Same with quarterback and receiver weren’t trying to get nfl fans. They’re trying to get spouses who normally wouldn’t care to watch. That’s why all the family parts are added. In hopes that that’ll catch your wife’s attention and make her form some kinda attachment, enough to go buy herself some merch, and maybe even some tickets to the game that she couldn’t have cared about less before this. That and the ‘Drive to Survive’ style boost. There’s no coincidence that ever since a tv series starts about formula 1 that highlights the drivers are 19 rich good looking dudes in their early-mid 20s and 1 early 40s dude, the massive influx of teenage-early 20s girls becoming sudden diehard fans (of almost exclusively 3 drivers) which has led to a boom in popularity</p>

      <label for="lrpiky8" class="commentText"><p>My favorite part wasn’t even of one of the players.  It was a Mazzulla interview clip where the interviewer was asking him about Tatum dealing with the pressure that comes from losses and how it might be “unfair he has to take the blame-“</p>

<p>Mazzulla (cutting off the interviewer): “Gets to.”</p>

<p>Reporter (clearly taken aback):  “He gets…”</p>

<p>Mazzulla (re-emphasizing):  “He <em>gets</em> to take the blame.  This is what he wanted.  This is what comes with leadership.”</p>

<p>Such a refreshing take in an era where many coaches will patronize star players just to ensure they keep their job.  It also pretty aptly sums up “Psycho Joe” in about a 10 second clip.</p>

      <label for="lrqzw17" class="commentText"><p>People thought he was a little too crazy to be a coach the season before last. A lot of Celtics fans were calling for his head, and after the way they went out of the playoffs it wasn’t that crazy. I certainly underestimated how hard it must have been to take over 2 weeks before the season started, but he’s been excellent ever since he actually got his staff in place and had a real offseason.</p>

      <label for="lrq3xm0" class="commentText"><p>incredibly sad but watching Jimmy work through that and explain how that experience affected him mentally was probably the most compelling part of the show for me. kinda surprised he was willing to go so in-depth about his emotions but it totally changed my perspective on why Jimmy looked so checked out at times during the regular season last year, didn’t realize they had such a close relationship</p>

<p>what’s his personality? video games and laying in bed while people manage his life? butler was the only one of the 5 with any outside interests other than video games and holding a baby.</p>

Can&rsquo;t argue with me that he&rsquo;s only 22-23; he&rsquo;s a father for fs. And from a competitive standpoint; i&rsquo;m not sure he has the mentality to develop and practice his game cause he came off awfully full of himself in this series. I sincerely hope he develops a work ethic that will allow him to grow a skillset not reliant in his altheticism.</p>

Having said that, I think living in a bubble like that didn’t do ant any favors in terms of maturing or personal development.</p>

<p>He recently was asked about how he makes sure he has good people around him now that he’s blowing up and he basically said that he’s just always had the same people in his circle and that he doesn’t need anyone else and that they’re all significantly older than him so he can trust their advice. It almost seems like he’s in a conservatorship but then on the road he’s got more freedom and doesn’t know how to handle it. Makes me nervous as a wolves fan :/</p>

<p>But I feel like it makes sense when you understand his life. No father figure, his mom and grandma passed at the same time when he was in middle school. So basically he spent his teenage years being raised by his older sister and was drafted before he turned 19. He’s basically having to do all his growing up while being an NBA superstar with millions of dollars laying around.</p>

      <label for="lrpdbx8" class="commentText"><p>I was pretty indifferent with it. Jimmy’s segments were compelling and KG was a good choice as a talking head. I think they really missed the mark with Sabonis. There could have been some really interesting stuff about being an international player, a second generation player, son of a legend and what pressures all that entails. He just felt like an afterthought in this.</p>

<p>That is a bit weird when you put it like that. I haven&rsquo;t watched it myself but I wouldn&rsquo;t mind seeing some clips of the good parts. In contrast, when it comes to highlights you got people fighting over each other to post the fastest one clipped without the replay to get it out first.</p>

      <label for="lrp7vlr" class="commentText"><p>I enjoyed it, it&rsquo;s clear that they&rsquo;re trying to reach a broader audience, basically explaining the storylines we all followed through the year. I have a bias toward Tatum&rsquo;s story but I felt like each was interesting in its own way.</p>

<p>Domas&rsquo; was uplifting but a disappointing end, cute family, and seems like a dope dude. Bought snow to BRING TO HIS HOUSE TF?</p>

<p>Bron, big on the family (I get it), legacy, aging, and dude is corny what&rsquo;s new? But that interview at his last game of the season was wild, I totally forgot he got asked that. Savannah is the key.</p>

<p>Ant, this dude&rsquo;s immaturity is nutssssss, he&rsquo;s playing pool while his GF is obviously exhausted and holding his baby and blasts music? It was watching the game while she just gave birth for me. Sick playoff mic&rsquo;d moments though, scary af. 22? Clean up that inner circle big dawg and please grow up safely.</p>

<p>Jimmy, he&rsquo;s the dopest dad, I wish him success but not in the playoffs, but I respect him. Fuck the Heat.</p>

<p>Tatum, that one scene where he&rsquo;s just styling on his son was actually wild, he&rsquo;s corny yeah but like he&rsquo;s the prime candidate to show how helicopter parenting can make you millions. They really don&rsquo;t give this mf a break. The pressure is inside and outside the house. Following his and the Celtic storyline was interesting to see.</p>

<p>It was what I expected and they did a good job with hype playoff videos and music, weirdly edited at times, would rewatch high just for Ant&rsquo;s awkward and embarrassing adulthood for a try not to cringe challenge though.</p>

<p>Ant is still a little kid in many ways, lives with his bros, doesn&rsquo;t cook for himself or pack his own suitcase, video games all the time.  Makes his upside even scarier.</p>

<p>Jimmy is just a complete maniac.  A real freak&hellip;you can see his hunger to get the absolute most out of life in his eyes.  The guy is locked in to basketball on every level in a truly Kobe-esque way while also being authentically himself in non-basketball pursuits.</p>

<p>The other 3 guys&rsquo; stories seemed very curated and honestly a bit boring</p>

<p>Why try to contrive some &ldquo;asshole personality&rdquo; to placate talking heads/his dad? BE YOURSELF is better than trying to outwardly project some phony temperament that WILL get immediately called out by media/lockeroom/whoever.</p>

<p>They did fine with it I guess just wished they made it crystal clear. Tatum is a killer on the court and his game does his talking. Trying to please everyone around him by trying to be someone hes not would of only made things ALOT worse for him. He kept his head down and stayed true to who he is and they won a chip in part because of that.</p>

<p>Also wished they showed him shouting out JB alot more, to further dispel future talking head points.</p>

Jumping from player to player randomly made zero sense and then we didn’t really get a lot of crazy moments because even tho the show was on Netflix, it felt like I was watching a YouTube series or something. Nothing about it felt natural and I’m not blaming the players for it at all this is strictly on Netflix and the NBA.</p>

Maybe it’s contrived but it was nice to see him give a ton of credit to her for allowing him to singularly focus on basketball/taking care of his body so that when he comes home he doesn’t have to worry about anything at all. Athletes talk a lot about sacrifices you have to make to be the best, but you rarely get to see what the other side of that looks like.</p>

<p>The clips of Tatum being stressed about potentially not being able to spend Christmas Day with Deuce, and LeBron and Savannah talking about Bronny’s heart scare didn’t seem contrived to me, meanwhile you have Ant barely giving a shit when his kid is being born lol</p>

      <label for="lrpm614" class="commentText"><p>The show made me like each player more except for Ant. He’s just so immature; leaving his family waiting on thanksgiving because he’s playing video games, doesn’t even pack his own clothes, kept saying I hope the baby doesn’t come on game day, etc. I get that he’s young but I think at 22 these are things he should do or be aware/mindful of.</p>

<p>Sabonis seems like a genuinely nice dude, laid back. Reminds me of Tatum in that way. He also just seems like such a normal relatable guy</p>

I&rsquo;m scared for ant when the media will turn on him hard in the next 2 years .</p>

<p>I liked the Tatum parts , he is who he is , this generation tim Duncan personality wise .</p>

<p>Jimmy Butler got his own barista , that&rsquo;s lame as hell .</p>

<p>The only sabonis parts I liked was when they showed his father , one of the goats. Sabonis seems like the nicest guy in the whole nba , even that could not stop thug draymond.</p>

<p>I wish we saw some of the real lebron , not pr lebron. His wife seems cool as hell .</p>

<p>All in all liked it .</p>

      <label for="lrpistl" class="commentText"><p>I liked it.
Ant is incredibly unlikable but he&rsquo;s also definitely a product of his circumstances like anyone.
I thought the footage was good but the actual interviews are not that good. KG and Jimmy have the most charisma.
Sabonis boring. Bron known, so, expectable. Jimmy seems like a real card which was entertaining. Tatum is shown as exactly who I thought he was, genuine and authentic with it, but he is authentically boring lol.</p>

<p>Lots of playing basketball and recovering for each of them, not much else, so I guess I could have seen that coming as that&rsquo;s to be expected and I think very real.</p>

<p>I think it would be better if you didn&rsquo;t already closely follow the big media narratives of the NBA and the games etc. A good series for non-fans to maybe become more of a fan.
I watched it all and by the end I thought it was kind of nice but was happy it was done.</p>

<p>Definitely wish it had more interaction within the teams (interactions with the players and coaches, team meetings, etc.) as we only got a little of that. I understand why but that was a bit disappointing on some level.</p>

Didn’t have a ton of takeaways from it besides a lot of the immaturity and great edit Ant got given the other news around him. Outside of that it seems like a lot of comments here didn’t realize that it was going to be a lot of off the court stuff vs breaking down games. Easy viewing and had some interesting moments</p>

I only remember seeing a few glimpses of him in the final episode and then it was just him setting a screen or briefly appearing in the background. He must have been on camera for like 10 seconds tops. He was never heard speaking and never seen making a play.</p>

<p>It’s not the best thing I’ve ever seen but I’ll probably watch it as a basketball fan as you get to see the real lives (well apart from the shagging and partying)</p>

      <label for="lrq4ge0" class="commentText"><p>I doubt they were trying to but this show didn&rsquo;t portray Ant in a good light. It was made even worse just by comparison with the other 4.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Bron, Sabonis, Tatum and Jimmy seem like pretty emotionally intelligent guys. Family oriented, hard working and focused. People you want at the forefront of your marketing to be the face of the league.</p></li>

<li><p>Ant seemed wildly immature, selfish and spoiled by enablers in his life. It seemed like everyone around him was enjoying the free ride and hopefully he does have someone responsible for managing his $$.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As great as he was in 23-24 I don&rsquo;t think this was good coverage for Ant and left me thinking a bit less of him personally. I think they might have been better off grabbing someone like Booker, SGA, Luka etc., if they were available. (If they wanted a SG)</p>

      <label for="lrpylze" class="commentText"><p>I honestly thought it would be more about the basketball. I guess it is cool to see a bit behind the scenes but I mostly liked it when it was related to basketball to some extent. For example learning what Jimmy was going through. It’s kind of crazy to think that ECF series, him going head to head with Grant, etc, what was happening at the time. Or seeing Ant leave the game for the birth of his daughter, or get in the car to go play Jokic, that stuff is cool. But respectfully I don’t need to see 30 minutes of Sabonis’ valley girl wife yapping or going apple picking with Tigey. They’ll never actually go deep or intimate enough to really know what these guys are like. And then they just end up fast forwarding through entire playoff series and games like it’s nothing.</p>
