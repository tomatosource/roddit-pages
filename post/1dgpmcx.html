      <p>So I was thinking about this question and I ultimately decided to make a post about this to see what you guys think about this</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>What do you guys think about this?</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Did the Mavericks make any adjustments or did the Celtics just play less hard?</p>

<p>They win by a lot so it was interesting to see that happen to them</p>

      <label for="l8rgumt" class="commentText"><p>The Mavs kept their bigs in the paint a lot more last night and worried less about Luka being on the perimeter 1 on 1. The Celtics were going to get switches and hunt Luka anyway, so they just committed to letting the bigs clean up when he got beat instead of having bigs come out to help. Luka being more active allowed that strategy to work out better, and the competitive period of the game being&hellip; short game allowed him to maintain his energy and focus on that end.</p>

<p>If Boston shot better from 3 early on, Dallas may have had to adjust their plan for their bigs.. but without KP, they aren&rsquo;t always going to have elite spacing in all their lineups.. and this is something many of us have pointed out before the series even started. With Boston&rsquo;s spacing, Dallas can&rsquo;t execute their usual elite rim protection. But without being able to play full 5 out all the time, Dallas can expose some of their lineups and shut off the rim and throw guys off rhythm especially when the 3 ball isn&rsquo;t working.</p>

<p>In short, Dallas reverted back to their normal defensive principles instead of the ones they seemingly &ldquo;adjusted to&rdquo; specifically for Boston and it worked.</p>

<p>but also Boston just played with no intensity at all, didn&rsquo;t bother trying to get back into the game when they fell behind, and will probably still win the series in 5. Dallas was playing with nothing left to lose and Boston played like they have no chance of losing the series, as is the case a lot of the time when a team is down 3-0. Eventually it&rsquo;ll catch up to one of those teams, but doubt it does here.</p>

      <label for="l8rkv1t" class="commentText"><p>I think that’s a good summary. I do think Joe erred a little bit in going to Tillman too early too. The Mavs knew they had no need to guard him at all and moved their defenders around in a way that really gummed up the Celtics spacing.</p>

<p>Offensively, I think Kyrie in particular is benefitting from Porzingis being out. Similarly to what the Celtics have done to the Mavs in the past games, when they can move Al out of the paint on a switch there isn’t anyone looming to clean things up or deter the drive if he can get past his primary.</p>

<p>I know the game ended up the way it did, but in todays nba , a 20 point lead midway through the game is big out of reach. Don’t discredit the impact of having their 3 most important players in foul trouble largely from bullshit calls.</p>

      <label for="l8rus3g" class="commentText"><p>One other thing, it seemed like the Mavs took a page out of the Pacer&rsquo;s playbook. They were pushing the ball up the floor quickly on makes and misses which caused crossmatches in transition. Playing quicker and having more players attack on offense than just Luka and Kyrie collapsed the Celtic&rsquo;s defense and left the Mav&rsquo;s shooters more open than they have been all series. In addition, the crossmatches let Gafford and Lively thrive more with lobs and rebounds because Celtics couldn&rsquo;t always get Tatum or Horford matched up onto the big.</p>

      <label for="l8rvihh" class="commentText"><p>FYI— Thinking Basketball had a nice breakdown of G3 and how the Celts adjusted to the Mavs trying to park a single big in the lane. It was a smart Mavs strategy, Boston just solved it really fast and consistently by basically reversing the ball from the strong side and nullifying the Dallas bigs “free safety” approach.</p>

<p>Haven’t dug into the clips, but sounds like Dallas countered the counter.</p>

<p>Grow the fuck up</p>

<p>Cute edit after the fact, but the other comments are either Dallas fans or full of shit. I went back to watch the full game to find the adjustments fully expecting there to be plenty and there just weren’t any major ones.</p>

      <label for="l8rxapw" class="commentText"><p>Playing Dante Exum vs Tim Hardaway made a big difference. dante pushed the pace bringing up the ball and actually the whole team pushed the pace a ton more even on celtics makes than they have in the past games. Celtics transition defense is not nearly as good as their half court defense so mavs got more easy buckets that got the role players going. also their 5s didn&rsquo;t rotate onto the perimeter nearly as much and rather switched allowing them to protect the paint more. in games 1-3 they had the 5s float onto the perimeter a lot more and the celtics often waited for that moment to drive to not have to deal with the rim protection as much.</p>

      <label for="l8rkg9u" class="commentText"><p>Dallas adjusted. They provided resistance on the initial point of attack, kept Lively/Gafford under the rim (mostly against their guards and punished their switches) and allowed their perimeter defense to settle and chase the 3 pt line</p>

<p>Celtics overdribbled trying to attack their initial defender and wasted time off the shot clock which sped them up. It allowed Dallas to settle behind the defense and chase the 3. I think we’ll see Tatum at the nail more as an adjustment</p>

      <label for="l8rscgw" class="commentText"><p>I haven’t rewatched the game but it seemed like Boston right from the tip was bringing way more help on Luka and Kyrie’s isolations when they did get the switch, whereas it felt like they were content playing that straight up in games 1-3 and taking away the others, and it got the defense in rotation way more often than the first few games. Again, just my initial read but I really didn’t understand it at all.</p>

      <label for="l8rwn4a" class="commentText"><p>Mavs defense definitely stepped up, individually and help, read the movement a lot better, and they made buckets.</p>

<p>Boston probably thought they could half ass on the road and still beat Dallas. I expect a much different game 5.</p>

<p>Dallas needs to do everything the same, if not better, and still hope Boston has an off night shooting.</p>

      <label for="l8riz60" class="commentText"><p>personally I think the most significant adjustments were pushing the pace which made it more difficult for Boston to match up and being more creative about getting Boston’s big man in the PnR. but in general they just played better. they did way better containing the dribble, they were the first to loose balls, Luka and Kyrie hit their tough shots inside the arc, and the role players finally hit their 3s</p>

<p>on the other side Boston was very sloppy with the ball (Holiday especially), they fell asleep defensively a few times, they missed a lot of good shots, they fumbled more than a few easy rebounds, and in general their decision-making wasn’t nearly at the same level as it was in the first 3 games. Mavs definitely played harder than the Celtics but I also think Boston simply didn’t do a good job executing</p>
