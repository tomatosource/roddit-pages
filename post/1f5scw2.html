    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Many fans say that certain all time greats like LeBron or MJ are so talented that they would fit in most schemes and be very productive no matter which team or era (of the past) they played in</p>

<p>This made me wonder which is the best NBA all time great that would absolutely not fit in on most other teams or would need quiet a bit of time adjusting to the new team&rsquo;s schemes and style</p>

<p>Basically a great player that really isn&rsquo;t versatile or is someone that you feel was only productive because the team around them complimented their style of play very well</p>

<p>I would give my pick, but I genuinely have no clue who this describes. Who would your pick be?</p>

They lost Bryant who was their starting 5 and a player on the rise few games into the season. When Westbrook got healthy they went on insane run in the second half of the season with one of the best records in the league for the period. Westbrook ended up averaging triple double, and Biel had the best year of his career thanks to Russ. Other players were Hachimura, rookie Avdija, Bertans, Robin Lopez and Gafford. Completely random team that Russ carried to playoffs that year.</p>

I thought for sure that would stop the weird stat padder argument seeing as he definitely wasn&rsquo;t having anyone there box out for him and shit but it&rsquo;s like people forgot or didn&rsquo;t realize that season even happened. He&rsquo;s not that good anymore mind but it&rsquo;s kind of a bummer that his Lakers tenure seemed to cause people to forget about his play previously.</p>

He was fun to watch, it was fun to have an extra reason to tune in every night (Triple Double record) and he gave the team his all. Two 3&rsquo;s in 6(?) seconds to beat the Nets in the regular season was a season highlight- what was the season highlight last year? Or the year before? Maybe some super dedicated fans can name one, but I can&rsquo;t. </p>

<p>If anything, I am thankful for Russ for bringing some spark to DC that year, yet I sympathize (or maybe empathize?) about his rep/past seasons on both LA teams. I do hope Denver works out for him.</p>

      <label for="lkvdvb3" class="commentText"><p>2010-2017 westbrook was a massive floor raiser who could play with stars but after that he just consistently made his team worse given the salary he was paid.</p>

<p>The only exception to this is when he went to the wizards. And why is that? Because the wizards were completely devoid of talent except bradley beal. He can be that floor raiser if your team is trash but like I said, after 2017 forget ever playing him with other stars and excepting him to make the team better. Also I think it says a lot about Bradley Beal that westbrook in his first year in dc got the wizards to the playoffs while beal couldn’t ever do that by himself. It shows westbrook was legitimately a good player for some time but he just cannot play with most stars.</p>

<p>His best costar in his prime would definitely be a 3 and D wing. Kevin Durant was probably the best player westbrook could’ve ever hoped to be paired with in the nba.</p>

Born and raised from OKC and seeing Russ play in person is incredible. His MVP year after I thought he&rsquo;d leave like KD and he just sort of looked at okc and was like &ldquo;nah I got you, now I do what I want, this is gonna be fun&rdquo;. And went super saiyan.</p>

<p>If anyone takes prime Rose I don&rsquo;t blame them one bit, but Russ is my guy and 2017 Russ was the most fun basketball I&rsquo;ve ever been around.</p>

OKC being more athletic than the Spurs was one of the main reasons OKC gave the Spurs a lot of trouble. KD being unstoppable on the mid range even when OKC didn&rsquo;t have spacing and Westbrook on transition even with Kawhi and Danny Green amazing transation defense were huge trouble for the Spurs.</p>

      <label for="lkvcg2l" class="commentText"><p>This is the answer imo. He’s a ball dominant, terrible off ball player. To make matters worse, when he isn’t involved on the offensive end, he lapses and simply lacks effort on defense.</p>

<p>Usually, James Harden would fit this description as well, but he’s Harden is actually quite impressive in the sense he can be a facilitator when there are other scorers on the team (compare his Houston days to Clippers, Philly days).</p>

<p>Other good answers would be Iverson and Carmelo, just see how quickly their careers flamed out when they were no longer the best players on their own team (oddly enough, they played decently with each other so that’s partly why I picked Westbrook over them).</p>

<p>KD, on the other hand, had to let Russell shoot more than him even when the former is the better scorer.

<p>Before the injury he was in the MVP race, being the assist leader of the League and essentially playing floor general.</p>

<p>He has fitted greatly with super different players like CP3, Russ, KD and Kyrie.</p>

If the criteria for being not a good fit is not being an upgrade over any player, obviously no player anywhere near the top 50 is going to make the cut.

If you added prime Steph Curry to the current Warriors, they would not bench old Steph, they&rsquo;d just play two Stephs. Same with say prime Lebron on the Lakers, and honestly basically every wing player ever can fit alongside even two other star wings.</p>

<p>The question is still kinda stupid, because honestly there are very few types of star players who don&rsquo;t fit in any system, and they&rsquo;re basically all non-shooting specialists (either non-shooting bigs or non-shooting passers).</p>

This wasn&rsquo;t a regular 8 seed, it was a team that was basically built to beat the Mavs.</p>

Without Chandler, Dirk led the Mavs to 10 straight 50+ with seasons, a league high 67 wins in 06-07, and a finals appearance. It’s not fair to attribute Dirk’s team performances for effectively only one prime season of both Dirk and Chandler.</p>

      <label for="lkwm64r" class="commentText"><p>This just tells me you didn’t follow basketball in the 2000s. It was a common theme among NBA pundits and media heads that Dirk was a “regular season” guy who never got it done in the playoffs. I’m not just making this up. It was one of the most talked about super-star-headlines. The same way you always see “Embiid can’t be healthy in June”, you’d hear once a week on Sports Center that Dirk couldn’t get it done in the playoffs. Whether it was deserved or not may be opinion, but it was a very common and prominent opinion. His ring in 2011 really vaulted his legacy status.</p>

<p>Outside of the 2011 Title Run, Dirk only got past the second round twice (and like you said, on teams that had very good regular season records). Dirk didn’t make it to the second round of the playoffs 14 times in his career.</p>

<p>Lol, I love revisionism. Lack of playoff success was by far his biggest criticism pre-2011. Nobody was thinking &ldquo;gee it must be a tough conference&rdquo; when his 67 win Mavs got destroyed by the 42 win Warriors</p>

      <label for="lkvqkfy" class="commentText"><p>This is actually even a consideration for LeBron vs MJ. Thinking Basketball made the point that MJ would probably slot easier into any given team, whereas maximizing LeBron&rsquo;s skill set sort of presupposes building the entire team around him. (Luka is very similar in that regard.) For instance,</p>

<p>Pippen was kind of like a proto-poor-man&rsquo;s LeBron for MJ in that he could bring the ball up and run the offense, score, rebound, and defend, which goes to show MJ&rsquo;s compatibility with that type of player. Whereas pairing LeBron and Pippen, while being devastatingly effective, probably wouldn&rsquo;t synergize quite as much in terms of the whole being more than the sum of the parts.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/FzzlvnncLOQ?list=PLtzZl14BrKjSMb4IFWSy0qh_nFGiy7PoZ&amp;t=1392" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/FzzlvnncLOQ?list=PLtzZl14BrKjSMb4IFWSy0qh_nFGiy7PoZ&amp;t=1392</a></p>

<p>That was a great series from Thinking Basketball.  People should watch the entire series.  Anyway&hellip;</p>

<p>I disagree LeBron teaming with Pippen wouldn&rsquo;t be as effective.  I think it would be more effective.  For starter, LeBron is a better 3pt shooter.  You can&rsquo;t have too much passing, defense, and rebounding on a team.  But you can have too much scoring.  Having a single engine on a team isn&rsquo;t sustainable because players need rest.  Even if Pippen is a poor man&rsquo;s LeBron, having him just means LeBron can save himself for later instead of being run at 100% full game.  The diminishing return really starts at the 3rd guy, not 2nd guy.  And that length advantage at the <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> spot is suffocating.  There&rsquo;s also the option of playing them at <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>, which opens the 2 spot for more shooting.
 With Jordan, then the 4 must bring shooting if playing the modern game.  You can certainly find one, but it limits your options.  I think it&rsquo;s safe to say it&rsquo;s easier to find a great 3pt shooting SG than a great 3pt shooting PF.  LeBron/Pippen combo is just more versatile.  Versatility is very underrated.</p>

<p>So I disagree with the idea that MJ can slotted into more team.</p>

      <label for="lky4139" class="commentText"><p>Thinking basketball’s caveat with this series is he’s going relative to era. You can’t say put Lebron in the 90s or Jordan in the modern day. He also caveated that he’s going with Miami Lebron, where his shooting wasn’t quite as good as Cavaliers or Lakers Lebron but his motor was higher, he was more physical, and he had better defence.</p>

<p>And in that sense I agree. MJ was a better off ball player within the context of the 90s because he could shoot his midrange coming off screens whereas Miami Lebron in the 2010s did not have the shooting to capitalise on people sagging off him when he didn’t have the ball. He was a back door cutter, but so was MJ.</p>

<p>In fact one of the most interesting things from that video was how Miami’s offence was worse with Dwayne Wade on the court than without. Lebronball was so dominant that as long as you give him these fairly easily sourced pieces he’s giving you a championship level offence.</p>

<p>but with his comparative lack of shooting then, you really have to build that team a certain way to extract that mega value.</p>

<p>As he peaked as a passer and shooter in later years, he might have declined as a player, but he was easier to slot into different schemes.</p>

<p>Like Kobe, the triangle offense let MJ go to his spot, set up then get the ball. This is why he can play with others. </p>

<p>LeBron is so great at everything they just let him get the ball 99% of the time. I think when it comes to LeBron, you&rsquo;ll need an all time great coach. If not, they&rsquo;ll just let him do everything.</p>

It could work but it&rsquo;s not something you&rsquo;d actually want to rely on and is GM malpractice to go into a season with that level of offensive talent instead of having multiple guys injured so that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re left with come post season.</p>

His skill set slots in amazingly with all teams, but unfortunately you just need Kobe and LeBron as primary ball handlers and scorers to keep Melo in check.</p>

<p>He may be right, but it’s a strange look, at least to me, to so adamantly talk publicly about all these times in your career when you could have had lots of unique/great opportunities but didn’t because it somehow would have hurt your ego.</p>

<p>While he’s not improving the warriors as much as a KD did he’s still fitting incredibly well, if not just slightly stepping on Draymond’s passing reps but he’d prob be spoon feeding Draymond easy ass looks off of cuts and off all screens/movement. Harden and can make any big(especially athletic ones) look amazing and the fit with Steph and Klay is obvious.</p>

      <label for="lkv3z2c" class="commentText"><p>I can see that. But one thing thing that kind of goes unnoticed ( maybe not) is that KD opened the door to really flourish as that 5 because KD complimented their  “weakness’” when dray would slide over. KD was a good to great rebounder, decided to be a good to great shot blocker. Yeah harden rebounded well for a guard, but it’s a different animal when you are the <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> vs the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>. It was KD’s defense that made a huge impact. Also his offense. It was just the perfect fit.</p>

      <label for="lkv6luj" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t agree, you need someone who is missing skills expected for their position since that means the team needs someone else to be more than their role. For example, Westbrook necessitates your team needs more shooting in other roles if you want to preserve spacing (which you absolutely does). Ball dominant players potentially lose efficacy for sure but they can still fit on a team as long as they aren&rsquo;t missing skills.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The conflict was more dramatic in Rodman’s second and last season with the Spurs. He clashed with the team’s front office, faced multiple suspensions, took a leave of absence, injured his shoulder in a motorcycle crash, and played just 49 games during the season. It was in the playoffs, however, that Rodman’s wild card behavior became too much. Sitting on the floor with his shoes off during a timeout in a game against the Lakers resulted in a suspension. The Spurs fell short against the Rockets, specifically center Hakeem Olajuwon, in the 1995 Western Conference Finals, prompting Rodman to criticize Hill and his calls against the Houston team.</p>

<p>Specifically, Rodman called Hill a “loser” and even blasted then-general manager Gregg Popovich, saying their choices “sucked.” In Bad as I Wanna Be, Rodman said Coach Pop “wanted to be the guy who tamed Dennis Rodman.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Military was going to make me a good little boy, a good soldier,” Rodman wrote of Popovich. “He lost sight of everything else, and then when he decided he couldn&rsquo;t do anything with me, he badmouthed me and gave me away for next to nothing. Then he pretended it was good for the team.”</p>

<p>There is a strong statistical case that he was better at rebounding than anyone else has ever been in any other skill relative to others. That is the gap between him and everyone else is bigger than the gap between Steph and everyone else in shooting, etc.</p>

<p>Plus it is much easier to get good shooters in the league, then great defender and rebounder!</p>

Players today are not used to having a dominant, post center and would have to adjust or relearn their game. In the meantime, I can totally see Wilt sulking, complaining about not getting the ball, being an ahole to teammates, coaches and the press and generally a cancer.</p>

<p>Wilt and Shaq might not play as much slow post back to the basket. But they&rsquo;d use their strength and athleticism to blow through defensive walls and get their points.</p>

<p>Not to mention Wilt as a defensive player would be a MONSTER in current league, and he was a great passer for his era which would probably translate well. </p>

AI and Westbrook have that tunnel vision issue where they are the whole offense and it’s spectacular but it means they have to take over everything. They aren’t especially effective off ball players due to the shooting efficiency concerns. Westbrook more than AI. Rodman is tough because it’s so hard in this current nba to have a non-scorer on the court in huge bunches. He’s not a spacer and with team rebounding and longer rebounds I think that part of his game goes from all time elite and crucial to just very good/helpful. He’s also too undersized at the 5 in large stretches.</p>

      <label for="lkwj9q8" class="commentText"><p>Michael Jordan is definitely not an instant fit on most teams. He needs to lead the league in scoring, and his abrasive, domineering personality would make him a challenging fit. On the Bulls, he famously got other scoring guards traded—not because their games didn’t fit, but because their shot attempts made it harder for MJ to lead the league in scoring. MJ was also notoriously difficult as a teammate, so much so that Phil Jackson had to trick him into passing the ball. Jackson convinced him that letting a teammate bring the ball up while he sprinted down the floor and posted up would result in more shot attempts, when in reality, it was a way to get him to move the ball.</p>

<p>The answer is unequivocally MJ.</p>
