    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Many fans say that certain all time greats like LeBron or MJ are so talented that they would fit in most schemes and be very productive no matter which team or era (of the past) they played in</p>

<p>This made me wonder which is the best NBA all time great that would absolutely not fit in on most other teams or would need quiet a bit of time adjusting to the new team&rsquo;s schemes and style</p>

<p>Basically a great player that really isn&rsquo;t versatile or is someone that you feel was only productive because the team around them complimented their style of play very well</p>

<p>I would give my pick, but I genuinely have no clue who this describes. Who would your pick be?</p>

      <label for="lkvvwrb" class="commentText"><p>People forget how insane Russ was that year. Wizards were in a terrible state back then and he started the season injured. They lost Bryant who was their starting 5 and a player on the rise few games into the season. When Westbrook got healthy they went on insane run in the second half of the season with one of the best records in the league for the period. Westbrook ended up averaging triple double, and Biel had the best year of his career thanks to Russ. Other players were Hachimura, rookie Avdija, Bertans, Robin Lopez and Gafford. Completely random team that Russ carried to playoffs that year.</p>

He was fun to watch, it was fun to have an extra reason to tune in every night (Triple Double record) and he gave the team his all. Two 3&rsquo;s in 6(?) seconds to beat the Nets in the regular season was a season highlight- what was the season highlight last year? Or the year before? Maybe some super dedicated fans can name one, but I can&rsquo;t. </p>

Majority of Westbrooks teammates have nothing but praise for him. Fans will be like &ldquo;LOL WESTBRICK WASHED AND NOBODY LIKES HIM&rdquo; and his teammates will be like &ldquo;Russ was the most positive influence in my basketball career.&rdquo; 29 teams lose each year but if Westbrook is on your team it&rsquo;s his fault.</p>

      <label for="lkvdvb3" class="commentText"><p>2010-2017 westbrook was a massive floor raiser who could play with stars but after that he just consistently made his team worse given the salary he was paid.</p>

<p>The only exception to this is when he went to the wizards. And why is that? Because the wizards were completely devoid of talent except bradley beal. He can be that floor raiser if your team is trash but like I said, after 2017 forget ever playing him with other stars and excepting him to make the team better. Also I think it says a lot about Bradley Beal that westbrook in his first year in dc got the wizards to the playoffs while beal couldn’t ever do that by himself. It shows westbrook was legitimately a good player for some time but he just cannot play with most stars.</p>

<p>His best costar in his prime would definitely be a 3 and D wing. Kevin Durant was probably the best player westbrook could’ve ever hoped to be paired with in the nba.</p>

Born and raised from OKC and seeing Russ play in person is incredible. His MVP year after I thought he&rsquo;d leave like KD and he just sort of looked at okc and was like &ldquo;nah I got you, now I do what I want, this is gonna be fun&rdquo;. And went super saiyan.</p>

<p>If anyone takes prime Rose I don&rsquo;t blame them one bit, but Russ is my guy and 2017 Russ was the most fun basketball I&rsquo;ve ever been around.</p>

OKC being more athletic than the Spurs was one of the main reasons OKC gave the Spurs a lot of trouble. KD being unstoppable on the mid range even when OKC didn&rsquo;t have spacing and Westbrook on transition even with Kawhi and Danny Green amazing transation defense were huge trouble for the Spurs.</p>

      <label for="lkvcg2l" class="commentText"><p>This is the answer imo. He’s a ball dominant, terrible off ball player. To make matters worse, when he isn’t involved on the offensive end, he lapses and simply lacks effort on defense.</p>

<p>Usually, James Harden would fit this description as well, but he’s Harden is actually quite impressive in the sense he can be a facilitator when there are other scorers on the team (compare his Houston days to Clippers, Philly days).</p>

<p>Other good answers would be Iverson and Carmelo, just see how quickly their careers flamed out when they were no longer the best players on their own team (oddly enough, they played decently with each other so that’s partly why I picked Westbrook over them).</p>

<p>KD, on the other hand, had to let Russell shoot more than him even when the former is the better scorer.

      <label for="lkvinvu" class="commentText"><p>As a cerified Harden fanboy I want to add that he was amazing in the Nets playing with 2 extremely ball heavy players.</p>

<p>Before the injury he was in the MVP race, being the assist leader of the League and essentially playing floor general.</p>

<p>He has fitted greatly with super different players like CP3, Russ, KD and Kyrie.</p>

If the criteria for being not a good fit is not being an upgrade over any player, obviously no player anywhere near the top 50 is going to make the cut. If you have to bench or trade some of your best players to play someone else, it&rsquo;s not really an instant fit.</p>

      <label for="lkw2t01" class="commentText"><p>Except you are ignoring that most player archetypes can play together rather well. If you added prime Steph Curry to the current Warriors, they would not bench old Steph, they&rsquo;d just play two Stephs. Same with say prime Lebron on the Lakers, and honestly basically every wing player ever can fit alongside even two other star wings.</p>

<p>The question is still kinda stupid, because honestly there are very few types of star players who don&rsquo;t fit in any system, and they&rsquo;re basically all non-shooting specialists (either non-shooting bigs or non-shooting passers).</p>

It could work but it&rsquo;s not something you&rsquo;d actually want to rely on and is GM malpractice to go into a season with that level of offensive talent instead of having multiple guys injured so that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re left with come post season.</p>

      <label for="lkvqkfy" class="commentText"><p>This is actually even a consideration for LeBron vs MJ. Thinking Basketball made the point that MJ would probably slot easier into any given team, whereas maximizing LeBron&rsquo;s skill set sort of presupposes building the entire team around him. (Luka is very similar in that regard.) For instance,</p>

<p>Pippen was kind of like a proto-poor-man&rsquo;s LeBron for MJ in that he could bring the ball up and run the offense, score, rebound, and defend, which goes to show MJ&rsquo;s compatibility with that type of player. Whereas pairing LeBron and Pippen, while being devastatingly effective, probably wouldn&rsquo;t synergize quite as much in terms of the whole being more than the sum of the parts.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/FzzlvnncLOQ?list=PLtzZl14BrKjSMb4IFWSy0qh_nFGiy7PoZ&amp;t=1392" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/FzzlvnncLOQ?list=PLtzZl14BrKjSMb4IFWSy0qh_nFGiy7PoZ&amp;t=1392</a></p>

<p>That was a great series from Thinking Basketball.  People should watch the entire series.  Anyway&hellip;</p>

<p>I disagree LeBron teaming with Pippen wouldn&rsquo;t be as effective.  I think it would be more effective.  For starter, LeBron is a better 3pt shooter.  You can&rsquo;t have too much passing, defense, and rebounding on a team.  But you can have too much scoring.  Having a single engine on a team isn&rsquo;t sustainable because players need rest.  Even if Pippen is a poor man&rsquo;s LeBron, having him just means LeBron can save himself for later instead of being run at 100% full game.  The diminishing return really starts at the 3rd guy, not 2nd guy.  And that length advantage at the <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> spot is suffocating.  There&rsquo;s also the option of playing them at <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>, which opens the 2 spot for more shooting.
 With Jordan, then the 4 must bring shooting if playing the modern game.  You can certainly find one, but it limits your options.  I think it&rsquo;s safe to say it&rsquo;s easier to find a great 3pt shooting SG than a great 3pt shooting PF.  LeBron/Pippen combo is just more versatile.  Versatility is very underrated.</p>

<p>So I disagree with the idea that MJ can slotted into more team.</p>

His skill set slots in amazingly with all teams, but unfortunately you just need Kobe and LeBron as primary ball handlers and scorers to keep Melo in check.</p>

<p>While he’s not improving the warriors as much as a KD did he’s still fitting incredibly well, if not just slightly stepping on Draymond’s passing reps but he’d prob be spoon feeding Draymond easy ass looks off of cuts and off all screens/movement. Harden and can make any big(especially athletic ones) look amazing and the fit with Steph and Klay is obvious.</p>

But one thing thing that kind of goes unnoticed ( maybe not) is that KD opened the door to really flourish as that 5 because KD complimented their  “weakness’” when dray would slide over. KD was a good to great rebounder, decided to be a good to great shot blocker. Yeah harden rebounded well for a guard, but it’s a different animal when you are the <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> vs the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>. It was KD’s defense that made a huge impact. Also his offense. It was just the perfect fit.</p>

      <label for="lkv6luj" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t agree, you need someone who is missing skills expected for their position since that means the team needs someone else to be more than their role. For example, Westbrook necessitates your team needs more shooting in other roles if you want to preserve spacing (which you absolutely does). Ball dominant players potentially lose efficacy for sure but they can still fit on a team as long as they aren&rsquo;t missing skills.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The conflict was more dramatic in Rodman’s second and last season with the Spurs. He clashed with the team’s front office, faced multiple suspensions, took a leave of absence, injured his shoulder in a motorcycle crash, and played just 49 games during the season. It was in the playoffs, however, that Rodman’s wild card behavior became too much. Sitting on the floor with his shoes off during a timeout in a game against the Lakers resulted in a suspension. The Spurs fell short against the Rockets, specifically center Hakeem Olajuwon, in the 1995 Western Conference Finals, prompting Rodman to criticize Hill and his calls against the Houston team.</p>

<p>Specifically, Rodman called Hill a “loser” and even blasted then-general manager Gregg Popovich, saying their choices “sucked.” In Bad as I Wanna Be, Rodman said Coach Pop “wanted to be the guy who tamed Dennis Rodman.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Military was going to make me a good little boy, a good soldier,” Rodman wrote of Popovich. “He lost sight of everything else, and then when he decided he couldn&rsquo;t do anything with me, he badmouthed me and gave me away for next to nothing. Then he pretended it was good for the team.”</p>

<p>There is a strong statistical case that he was better at rebounding than anyone else has ever been in any other skill relative to others. That is the gap between him and everyone else is bigger than the gap between Steph and everyone else in shooting, etc.</p>

Players today are not used to having a dominant, post center and would have to adjust or relearn their game. In the meantime, I can totally see Wilt sulking, complaining about not getting the ball, being an ahole to teammates, coaches and the press and generally a cancer.</p>

<p>Wilt and Shaq might not play as much slow post back to the basket. But they&rsquo;d use their strength and athleticism to blow through defensive walls and get their points.</p>

<p>Not to mention Wilt as a defensive player would be a MONSTER in current league, and he was a great passer for his era which would probably translate well. </p>

AI and Westbrook have that tunnel vision issue where they are the whole offense and it’s spectacular but it means they have to take over everything. They aren’t especially effective off ball players due to the shooting efficiency concerns. Westbrook more than AI. Rodman is tough because it’s so hard in this current nba to have a non-scorer on the court in huge bunches. He’s not a spacer and with team rebounding and longer rebounds I think that part of his game goes from all time elite and crucial to just very good/helpful. He’s also too undersized at the 5 in large stretches.</p>

Ball-dominant guards who are below-average shooters aren’t nearly as coveted anymore. You add in his poor one-on-one defense and he wouldn’t fit too well on a lot of modern schemes. </p>

<p>That said, he would probably play point forward a la LeBron today and in that scheme he’d still be excellent, as long as he had two guards who were solid shooters starting with him.</p>

<p>With that said id say Bill Russel needs some offensive talen around him. Like he is amazing on defen se, but you still gotta score the ball. Which isnt particularly dificult, but you arent winning if you have him as one of your top offensive guys no matter how good his defense is.</p>

      <label for="lkvka81" class="commentText"><p>Melo, Iverson, Westbrook, Lillard, Trae Young. First two the og 00s inefficient iso players and ball hogs/offensive black holes. Last two while nowhere as ball hogs, still way too ball dominant and not very effective in modern league that is (or at least becoming) much more about ball movement and roles are getting redefined and much more versatile (most successful teams don&rsquo;t want their PGs dictate all offense and prefer to run their offense over multiple players or not even through PG (Draymon Green, Jokic, LeBron teams, etc.) so small, not very good off ball players that are defensive liabilities are very getting outdated very fast (Doncic gives some vibes of one but he isn&rsquo;t. He isn&rsquo;t small and outside of defense, he is versatile with very high ball iq). And Wesbrook is like a link between both. Not to mention the constant, ego, team chemistry and off court issues that come with AI, Melo and to some extent - Wesbrook.</p>

<p>Players like Carmelo and Kobe have shown they can succeed taking on smaller / different roles on Olympics teams. And I can&rsquo;t imagine someone like Draymond struggling. </p>

<p>Ball-dominant pass-first point guard who is a turnstile on defense, with a persistent back condition.</p>

<p>Sure, you could put him into the corner and just have him shoot 3s like the Lakers tried to do when they traded for him, but at that point, is his three point shooting going to make up for his defensive deficiencies if you&rsquo;re not going to let him run the offense?</p>

      <label for="lkwh33y" class="commentText"><p>Luka is the obvious answer in today’s NBA. His on off numbers with additional offensive pieces is shockingly bad, along with the eye test. He’s a great floor raiser but a very poor ceiling raiser. He’s great on the ball in a heliocentric scheme but is very poor off ball, doesn’t shoot well off the catch, prefers to catch and play in iso, doesn’t cut well off ball, and is a very poor defender. Needs a very particular roster of high level 3 and D players. You would get significantly diminishing returns from him if you put him on a loaded roster.</p>

      <label for="lkwhq5k" class="commentText"><p>Lots of people, who are either extermely ball dominant, lack the versatility or have too big of an ego.</p>

<p>Kobe, Shaq, Westbrook, AI, Giannis, Embiid, Vince Carter, Melo and many others. Even Jordan would not be an easy fit on every team. The man averaged 23 FGA in his career (which is the second highest of all time if I remember correctly). You would have to give him most of the touches.</p>

<p>There are way more players that can&rsquo;t fit in any situation than the other way around.</p>

<p>Great playmakers or off ball players will always be a good fit on any team, because they can adapt to different stiyles.</p>

<p>An underrated good fit is James Harden, imo. While his playoff issues are well-known, he is one of the very few high-level players that has been able to play different roles depending on the situation and his abilities. He has been an elite 6thman, elite scorer and elite playmaker.  He made the Nets click when he joined the team, was pretty good with the 76ers (for the most part) and he easily fit in with star-studded Clippers last year as well.</p>
