    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Many fans say that certain all time greats like LeBron or MJ are so talented that they would fit in most schemes and be very productive no matter which team or era (of the past) they played in</p>

<p>This made me wonder which is the best NBA all time great that would absolutely not fit in on most other teams or would need quiet a bit of time adjusting to the new team&rsquo;s schemes and style</p>

<p>Basically a great player that really isn&rsquo;t versatile or is someone that you feel was only productive because the team around them complimented their style of play very well</p>

<p>I would give my pick, but I genuinely have no clue who this describes. Who would your pick be?</p>

      <label for="lkvdvb3" class="commentText"><p>2010-2017 westbrook was a massive floor raiser who could play with stars but after that he just consistently made his team worse given the salary he was paid.</p>

<p>The only exception to this is when he went to the wizards. And why is that? Because the wizards were completely devoid of talent except bradley beal. He can be that floor raiser if your team is trash but like I said, after 2017 forget ever playing him with other stars and excepting him to make the team better. Also I think it says a lot about Bradley Beal that westbrook in his first year in dc got the wizards to the playoffs while beal couldn’t ever do that by himself. It shows westbrook was legitimately a good player for some time but he just cannot play with most stars.</p>

<p>His best costar in his prime would definitely be a 3 and D wing. Kevin Durant was probably the best player westbrook could’ve ever hoped to be paired with in the nba.</p>

      <label for="lkvcg2l" class="commentText"><p>This is the answer imo. He’s a ball dominant, terrible off ball player. To make matters worse, when he isn’t involved on the offensive end, he lapses and simply lacks effort on defense.</p>

<p>Usually, James Harden would fit this description as well, but he’s Harden is actually quite impressive in the sense he can be a facilitator when there are other scorers on the team (compare his Houston days to Clippers, Philly days).</p>

<p>Other good answers would be Iverson and Carmelo, just see how quickly their careers flamed out when they were no longer the best players on their own team (oddly enough, they played decently with each other so that’s partly why I picked Westbrook over them).</p>

<p>KD, on the other hand, had to let Russell shoot more than him even when the former is the better scorer.

<p>Before the injury he was in the MVP race, being the assist leader of the League and essentially playing floor general.</p>

<p>He has fitted greatly with super different players like CP3, Russ, KD and Kyrie.</p>

<p>While he’s not improving the warriors as much as a KD did he’s still fitting incredibly well, if not just slightly stepping on Draymond’s passing reps but he’d prob be spoon feeding Draymond easy ass looks off of cuts and off all screens/movement. Harden and can make any big(especially athletic ones) look amazing and the fit with Steph and Klay is obvious.</p>

      <label for="lkv3z2c" class="commentText"><p>I can see that. But one thing thing that kind of goes unnoticed ( maybe not) is that KD opened the door to really flourish as that 5 because KD complimented their  “weakness’” when dray would slide over. KD was a good to great rebounder, decided to be a good to great shot blocker. Yeah harden rebounded well for a guard, but it’s a different animal when you are the <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> vs the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>. It was KD’s defense that made a huge impact. Also his offense. It was just the perfect fit.</p>

<p>And that’s why harden may not have been as good, besides Javale, they never had a rolling/stetch 5. Would harden needed one of those.</p>

<p>Yeah they would have been better with harden than Barnes and Bogut ( what they gave up to get KD) but I’m not sure they win back to back. Their defense would struggle</p>

      <label for="lkv5vji" class="commentText"><p>Dray flourished on defense before KD and after was there and regressed offensively when KD got there. Plus Dray is great at cutting and getting in good position for a pass. Which obviously is great for a passer like Harden.</p>

<p>Plus who’s beating them? Maybe the 2017 Cavs. But no other teams really stand up to the warriors with Harden from 17-19. Hell peak Harden is an iron man and probably would be healthy for the 2019 finals and help them win it.</p>

      <label for="lkv6luj" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t agree, you need someone who is missing skills expected for their position since that means the team needs someone else to be more than their role. For example, Westbrook necessitates your team needs more shooting in other roles if you want to preserve spacing (which you absolutely does). Ball dominant players potentially lose efficacy for sure but they can still fit on a team as long as they aren&rsquo;t missing skills.</p>

His skill set slots in amazingly with all teams, but unfortunately you just need Kobe and LeBron as primary ball handlers and scorers to keep Melo in check.</p>

<p>But you absolutely need to play Dirk alongside an elite defensive center</p>

<p>If you don’t have an elite defensive center he just gets run off the court</p>

<p>So as a top ~20 all time player probably Dork</p>

<p>And what kinda team doesnt allow for their big to do playmaking? Even at lesser volume, no team can have too many playmakers.</p>

<p>Its just the more you add on to a team, the less their return on investment is.</p>

<p>But unique skill guys in general can always find a spot.</p>

<p>Like Pippen for instance can always be a 6th or 7th man type that comes in when you need hustle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The conflict was more dramatic in Rodman’s second and last season with the Spurs. He clashed with the team’s front office, faced multiple suspensions, took a leave of absence, injured his shoulder in a motorcycle crash, and played just 49 games during the season. It was in the playoffs, however, that Rodman’s wild card behavior became too much. Sitting on the floor with his shoes off during a timeout in a game against the Lakers resulted in a suspension. The Spurs fell short against the Rockets, specifically center Hakeem Olajuwon, in the 1995 Western Conference Finals, prompting Rodman to criticize Hill and his calls against the Houston team.</p>

<p>Specifically, Rodman called Hill a “loser” and even blasted then-general manager Gregg Popovich, saying their choices “sucked.” In Bad as I Wanna Be, Rodman said Coach Pop “wanted to be the guy who tamed Dennis Rodman.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Military was going to make me a good little boy, a good soldier,” Rodman wrote of Popovich. “He lost sight of everything else, and then when he decided he couldn&rsquo;t do anything with me, he badmouthed me and gave me away for next to nothing. Then he pretended it was good for the team.”</p>

      <label for="lkv2k95" class="commentText"><p>With today&rsquo;s sensibilities in regards to spacing the floor, emphasis on 3-point shooting etc. I think a good answer might be guys like Julius Erving, James Worthy, Rick Barry. Great players for their era, but none of them could space the floor like we&rsquo;d prefer a small forward to these days.</p>

Especially if you could fill all other four spots with shooters including a centre who can defend and stretch the floor like Myles Turner or Brook Lopez. But that comes back to the point of the thread&hellip; if a team doesn&rsquo;t have the right pieces, adding Dr. J into the lineup may not be an instant fit.</p>

And yes, if Rick Barry was born in the year 2004 instead of 1944 he probably would have put more of a focus on 3-point shooting. But the simple truth was he shot 27 percent from 3 for his career. Take that for what it is.</p>

<p>Wally Szczerbiak was considered a sniper from 3, he was a 40% 3 over his career. He was hitting 40% of his 3s on 2.2 attempts per game, in today&rsquo;s game it would be like saying Obi Toppin and Bobby Portis were snipers from 3.</p>

Players today are not used to having a dominant, post center and would have to adjust or relearn their game. In the meantime, I can totally see Wilt sulking, complaining about not getting the ball being an ahole to teammates, coaches and the press and generally a cancer.</p>

      <label for="lkvgjw4" class="commentText"><p>AI, Westbrook, Rodman is where my mind goes right away. AI and Westbrook have that tunnel vision issue where they are the whole offense and it’s spectacular but it means they have to take over everything. They aren’t especially effective off ball players due to the shooting efficiency concerns. Westbrook more than AI. Rodman is tough because it’s so hard in this current nba to have a non-scorer on the court in huge bunches. He’s not a spacer and with team rebounding and longer rebounds I think that part of his game goes from all time elite and crucial to just very good/helpful. He’s also too undersized at the 5 in large stretches.</p>

      <label for="lkvgy0l" class="commentText"><p>To answer this question, I will take two points from the replies below.</p>

<p>One is, that if you are an all time player, you will fit into any roster and be useful/would raise the level of that team. That is what makes you an all time great.</p>

<p>Second, is the selection of Kobe. But my logic will probably vacillate from the normal thought process.</p>

<p>Its that yes, an all time great will TECHNICALLY make any team better, but its mostly their attitude problem that would make them far from an instant fit. Hence, my second point, that Kobe, even though my favourite player, would not be an instant fit on most teams.</p>

<p>Thinking from this logic, any all-time great with a huge ego would be a hindrance before help.</p>

<p>So MJ also comes in that category. Without Phil Jackson, neither he nor Kobe won a Chip. And it was not just the awesome coaching, but his ego management. That is where LeBron is an easier fit, because he is a pass-first guy who is more of a family man. There is a fierce leader aspect of leadership, that I outwork you all, so you better listen to me, and a family man&rsquo;s, that you are all my brothers/sons. We will do it together. LeBron, although lacking a bit on the former aspect especially in recent times, has always had the latter, which Phil had to imbibe in MJ and Kobe.</p>

<p>Russ seems to be a nice answer, but I still feel its the system issue for him and not because of his disqualification from my rubric specifically.</p>

<p>Rodman would be a nice addition anywhere, hence I disagree with a comment below. Because all he needs you is to allow him to do whatever he wants, outside the court.</p>

<p>I feel Shaq can be an issue at times, because his out of court antics, for example not taking care of his health hinder his on court performance. But the Diesel won it all with two teams, so who knows.</p>

<p>Wilt seems to be another player. Because his playstyle was much more of &ldquo;Give me the ball and I will win you the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like sure some can be lacking on defense, but what they provide would still make them fit really well and realisticly a decent defensive scheme is gonna cover 1 or 2 mediocre defenders on any team.</p>

<p>With that said id say Bill Russel needs some offensive talen around him. Like he is amazing on defen se, but you still gotta score the ball. Which isnt particularly dificult, but you arent winning if you have him as one of your top offensive guys no matter how good his defense is.</p>

Last two while nowhere as ball hogs, still way too ball dominant and not very effective in modern league that is (or at least becoming) much more about ball movement and roles are getting redefined and much more versatile (most successful teams don&rsquo;t want their PGs dictate all offense and prefer to run their offense over multiple players or not even through PG (Draymon Green, Jokic, LeBron teams, etc.) so small, not very good off ball players that are defensive liabilities are very getting outdated very fast (Doncic gives some vibes of one but he isn&rsquo;t. He isn&rsquo;t small and outside of defense, he is versatile with very high ball iq). And Wesbrook is like a link between both. Not to mention the constant, ego, team chemistry and off court issues that come with AI, Melo and to some extent - Wesbrook.</p>

      <label for="lkv6d31" class="commentText"><p>Okay sure, but the draymond doesn’t really fit this specific question. Draymond green is one of the greatest role players of all time, and from the years of 2015 and onwards, EVERY team in the league was trying to find a guy like Draymond to play at the 4. He was part of the uprising of the 4 and sometimes 5 out offense. There really wasn’t a team out there that he wouldn’t have been a perfect fit for.</p>

<p>A better answer is someone like Westbrook who has all the accolades to prove his greatness, but we saw time and time again that his play style simply wasn’t the answer for teams like the rockets and lakers to win a title with. Rather than make the lakers better, he made them significantly worse</p>

Draymond isnt a plug and play guy because there are plenty of teams that he wouldnt work if that team doesnt have shooters. He doesnt shoot the ball and most of his points ate because they abandoned him. He would not pair with several top 15 in the league: giannis, sga, ans embiid are some examples</p>

Ball-dominant guards who are below-average shooters aren’t nearly as coveted anymore. You add in his poor one-on-one defense and he wouldn’t fit too well on a lot of modern schemes. </p>

<p>That said, he would probably play point forward a la LeBron today and in that scheme he’d still be excellent, as long as he had two guards who were solid shooters starting with him.</p>

I don&rsquo;t know why he does it. It&rsquo;s strange to me. Someone with that much skill and talent just can&rsquo;t control himself in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="lkvduwi" class="commentText"><p>LeBron is actually a solid answer. He doesn&rsquo;t make the teams worse just because of how good he is, but if your goal is to maximize what you can get out of a team, you&rsquo;re more limited on the players you can plug in around him. We saw this in Miami. Wade can&rsquo;t be the best version of Wade with LeBron on the court. But that still works because of the raw talent on the floor.</p>

      <label for="lkvi4gp" class="commentText"><p>Only because he&rsquo;s so talented and there&rsquo;s not much better than having a LeBron-centric offense&hellip;but he absolutely does not fit every team. Again, we have real world evidence of this. Bosh and Wade both couldn&rsquo;t play to their peak abilities in order to fit LeBron in. Again, that still works because of the sheer amount of ability between all of them, but LeBron is much less portable than some superstars like Steph or Jordan because those players are easily maximised with off-ball play. LeBron is at his best when he&rsquo;s on-ball and calling the shots. That very obviously limits what you can get out of other ball dominant players.</p>

<p>So if you&rsquo;re actually interested in digging into your question, the arguable GOAT is clearly a solid answer specifically because there are multiple other all-time level players that fit into teams without requiring other top-level players to take a step back.</p>

<p>Dwight had some real limitations on offense but dominated because of physical tools. He also had a personality that could rub his teammates the wrong way. &amp;lt;phrasing&amp;gt;</p>

<p>Giannis can do a lot but he&rsquo;s seems like he&rsquo;s at his best when he can drive and dominate touches. I&rsquo;m not sure what other team he can fit on. Hell, adding Dame was an awkward fit.</p>

      <label for="lkv7p2b" class="commentText"><p>I think Dwight Howard would fit on nearly any team if he played optimally. His main issue imo was that he wanted to post up a lot instead of just set screens and be the best roll man ever.</p>

<p>Also the Dame fit was awkward mainly because of Dame was it not? Dame could only do well when Giannis wasn’t playing. Giannis does well with or without him.</p>
