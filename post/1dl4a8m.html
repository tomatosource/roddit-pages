      <label for="l9meztu" class="commentText"><p>I repost/update this this like once a year cause its always so crazy to me. In 2006, Wade had 152 dunks. Only 9 players surpassed his 06 total in 2024, all PFs or Cs. The highest listed guard this year was Scottie Barnes with 73, and then Anthony Edwards with 67.</p>

<p>Kobe&rsquo;s best season was 116, Lebron 145, Westbrook 69, Rose 32, Morant 58. To repeat, Wade once had <strong>152</strong> as a 6&rsquo;3&rdquo; guard. He had 6 seasons with 95 dunks or more. A lot of people these days dont realize how absurd his downhill attacking was. There&rsquo;s been no one even close to him since.</p>

      <label for="l9prmwb" class="commentText"><p>Eh, he was good at splitting defenders and getting to the rim, but his dunks were much more due to his long wingspan and less his pure athleticism. Dude doesn&rsquo;t really wow you with his hang time or how high up he gets. </p>

<p>The reason people compare Ant to Jordan is the opposite - he doesn&rsquo;t have the top tier handles right now, but his ability to explode is unreal. When he decides to, out of nowhere he&rsquo;s dunking over forwards / centers with his head at the rim. This is coming from someone who grew up in Chicago watching Jordan and the Bulls</p>

His prime he was insane and honestly not given enough credit. People wanna crown Harden ahead of him but clearly never actually watched Wade play. Not even mentioning him averaging a block a game for his size is absurd. I just can&rsquo;t believe his knees held up even as long as they did with all the issues combo with how much he dunked.</p>

      <label for="l9n7g65" class="commentText"><p>Russ is a great athlete and one of the best in the NBA’s history for sure. Wade would just look like he got shot out of a cannon. One second he was on top of the key and looked like he might just pull up for a shot, the next he was dunking on your center.</p>

<p>I think Harden is amazing and maybe his career totals will be better than Wade’s, but Wade was better than he was at his prime. Wade has 2 great Finals performances (thanks Bron) with one being an all time great performance where he led his team at 24 to a ring. If Wade never teamed up with Bron he probably has high counting stats and looks better relative but doesn’t have as many rings</p>

      <label for="l9rckad" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s a pretty great observation. DWade was so strong so he could blow through a lot of defenders, but he really didn&rsquo;t and mostly used his incredible footwork to dodge a lot of contact while driving and maintain speed. It always felt like he was moving around contact. Hard to describe, but I know exactly what you mean, and you really don&rsquo;t see that much in today&rsquo;s game.</p>

<p>Kyrie when he is on reminds me a little of DWade and might be the closest modern example of what you are describing. I kinda see it in De&rsquo;Aaron Fox at times but he reminds me of Wall/Westbrook most of the time. Benn Mathurin shows it occassionally.</p>

      <label for="l9nv3cz" class="commentText"><p>I wouldnt be surprised. Many lists have him #1 all time for guard dunks since its been counted (I think like &lsquo;98). Of course it depends on your definition of a guard, but he&rsquo;s got more all time than guys like Vince Carter, Kobe, Jason Richardson, TMac, etc. Probably only Jordan clears him for guard dunks at any height all time. People have counted MJ dunks in the 90s and he was still putting up like 75-100 a year iirc.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget watching a rookie DWade (with some help from Lamar Odum) give a really good Pacers team everything they could handle in the playoffs. DWade might be one of my favorite players ever, he was so smooth.</p>

      <label for="l9mkxes" class="commentText"><p>/r/NBA at a fundamental level doesn’t seem to understand how good prime Wade was.</p>

<p>This is why I don’t understand the bitching about the 2006 finals. There’s been several posts and videos going over each individual Mavericks player fouling Wade and all but a handful are legitimate. Wade had the quickest first step in the league and was on top of that an absolutely nuclear athlete and the physically strongest guard in the league. Nobody could stay in front of him and so they did the only thing they could do- foul.</p>

<p>But what made Wade special was how relentless he was. Sometimes you get the feeling that Anthony Edwards who has very comparable physical and athletic profile settles for his jumpshot and doesn’t fully utilize his athletic gifts. There was none of that with Wade. His jumpshot was in service of his driving game and not the other way around.</p>

<p>Oh and I get downvoted every time I say this but he outplayed Dirk in both finals.</p>

<p>2006 isn’t really up to debate but Wade in 2011 averaged 27/7/5 on 61% TS to Dirks 26/10/2 on 54% TS.</p>

He&rsquo;s certainty a good player, but the refs made him untouchable. In a close series, those calls make a big difference. He wasn&rsquo;t good enough to have more FTs than our whole team.</p>

<p>People complain about Luka, Embiid, or Harden&rsquo;s style of play. They exist because the NBA allowed Wade to get away with running into players as a bailout.</p>

<p>The Mavericks simply could not guard him. If the Mavericks had a player that could drive like Wade he would get a similar amount of free throws but no such man existed on the planet in 2006.</p>

<p>Neither of us are impartial. The best thing you can do to solve this is look at each individual foul and see if it is in fact a foul. People have done this. The results do not favor you.</p>

      <label for="l9nl4ad" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve seen people look at fouls in the series and come to the opposite conclusion. You can find plenty of evidence both ways depending on your viewpoint.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also seen Tim Donaghy claim that those finals were rigged, although you are fair to question his integrity on the subject.</p>

<p>I agree with you that we aren&rsquo;t going to come to an agreement since we&rsquo;re both biased. I disagree that you being able to point to a youtube video from another potentially biased nobody is any definitive proof, especially when fouls in the NBA are subjective to the referees calling them.</p>

<p>Also, saying that i&rsquo;m ignoring the point and then attacking me personally (because that is clearly about basketball) is not going to convince me that you are even confident in your own opinion.</p>

      <label for="l9mdrov" class="commentText"><p>No he’s not . He’s a 5x all star and only has 1 all nba selection. And availability is the best ability . When Wade was the same age as Mitchell he already won a ring as the #1 and had another deep playoff run in 05’. And he was 3rd in MVP + DPOY at 27</p>

<p>Wade was all nba 2nd team and 8th in MVP voting by his second season. He was 5x all nba (2x first team) and 3rd and 5th in MVP voting before Lebron even came. Like I said that’s a solid tier and a half better than a guy who’s a lock for the all star team but doesn’t get all nba locks.</p>

<p>Perennial all nba is someone like Tatum, AD , Embiid, SGA, Luka, Giannis and Jokic.</p>

<p>Yet Tatum has 4 all nba selections (3x first team) and has led his team to a ring and 4 ECF appearances as the #1 option and best player. (I won’t count 2018 because he was a rookie)</p>

<p>Mitchell is a tier below Tatum until further notice. Tatum can do everything Mitchell can. He’s one of the most complete players in the league on offense and defense</p>

Mitchell has improved more than Tatum has. This year before his injury Mitchell was 5th in epm and 6th in scoring and was leading Tatum in most categories while Tatum had elite spacing all around him. Mitchell is just a different tier than he was 3 years ago. Mitchell probably would have taken tatums first team if never got injured.</p>

<p>You’re crazy lol . Mitchell if he played 65 games would’ve def been all nba but he would’ve most likely been 3rd team . Maybe 2nd team if the Cavs got the 2nd seed instead of the Knicks. But that’s all hypotheticals. Tatum has produced in terms of reality</p>

They&rsquo;re both small, muscular guards with unusually long wingspans that have the explosiveness and talent to get to the rim at will. But that being said, prime Dwade is objectively better than Mitchell. It&rsquo;s kinda like how people get way too excited about the Ant and MJ comparisons</p>

      <label for="l9nhf48" class="commentText"><p>Exactly, Wade is Ant&rsquo;s best historical comparison. Wade is a better distributor, but not as good of a shooter. Other than that they are very similar. Both get downhill in the same way, both are good defenders who can also block shots at a smaller size. Ant still has a ways to go to get on Wade&rsquo;s level, but he&rsquo;s closing the gap a little every year.</p>
