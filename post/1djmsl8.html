Even ITT you can tell no one has watched the video and people are just making comments about the pistons and spurs based off the title/thumbnail, even though that’s only like 10% of the video. 90% of the video is a breakdown of how good Jrue and White and Mazzulla were in game 5, and how JB expertly denied Luka the ball.</p>

<p>Jrue and White having 4 offensive boards EACH in game 5 won them the game.</p>

No matter what happens, Curry is fucking running around everywhere poking at every crack in the defense and if you just slip a little, he punishes you. He&rsquo;s constantly relocating and creating something out of nothing, it opens up the offense to such a huge degree with his off-ball action. It&rsquo;s kind of bullshit it took him until 2022 to get a FMVP.</p>

      <label for="l9c2hvz" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I&rsquo;m not nearly as optimistic about a repeat as some of my other brethren are, solely because of the situation with our bigs, where one is incredibly injury prone and has basically never played 20 straight games in an incredibly long time and the other is 38.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really care right now though, all I ever wanted was 1 title with Tatum and Brown, and it&rsquo;s done now and as a Bucks fan can attest to, winning a championship is worth all the bad luck that comes afterward that is seemingly bestowed upon every champion in recent memory. .</p>

<p>Yeah, the pressure on them for winning got to almost unbearable levels. Now they can elevate their game without being judged by that factor. Whether they will deliver more titles, is yet to be seen, but I&rsquo;m sure they want to and will continue to fight for it.</p>

Obv the Celtics came closest being in the finals in &lsquo;22 and then winning in &lsquo;24 so it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see what happens especially with the very short off-season for some of their key players.</p>

      <label for="l9f71xv" class="commentText"><p>I think why I think they have a really solid chance is just thinking - what teams really have a chance to improve? And will it be enough?</p>

<p>In the East, I can see a healthy Knicks, a sun-run from the 76ers + new maxed player, and a really competitive series with Pacers where injury luck could flip it. All of those seem like less than 50% likelihood.</p>

<p>In the West, Nuggets might be losing KCP, Mavericks could improve, OKC could certainly improve as well with a big trade. Maybe the wolves put it together. But Celtics already have it together, and have that continuity that dynasty teams crave</p>

      <label for="l9f0w9e" class="commentText"><p>Nuggets bench got noticeably depleted. No real replacement for Bruce Brown, Reggie is alright but it&rsquo;s not the same. No replacement for Jeff Green, not that he was amazing but they just didn&rsquo;t have that reliable Forward type to give minutes to. Braun elevated to the main bench guy in his 2nd year.</p>

<p>Then, there&rsquo;s the Jamal Murray thing. The Nuggets whole system is based on the 2-man game between him and Jokic. If he&rsquo;s banged up or not playing, the whole system doesn&rsquo;t really work, as we saw in the seasons he didn&rsquo;t play. That&rsquo;s the benefit the Celtics have, if one of them is hurt (like KP), generally they will still be okay. I think Tatum going out would be the only true death knell. Everyone can talk about who played best but he draws a lot of defensive attention, still scores, keeps the offense flowing and plays incredibly flexible defense. He may not be an on-ball bloodhound like Brown but he does all the little shit like White and Horford do. Jrue is the real deal, being top level at the on-ball stuff AND the little stuff.</p>

      <label for="l9buhey" class="commentText"><p>Yea, I do think that the 1989 Pistons, 2004 Pistons, and 2014 Spurs are where this team enters the conversation for what they look like all-time. What has been interesting is that there are C&rsquo;s fans, in specific Celtics fans circles, out there that have been comparing Tatum to Isiah Thomas. Of those teams, Thomas was probably the best player, (2014 Duncan was older and 2014 Kawhi was younger).</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s really good company and a really good sign that this team is even more &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; than these other teams. Also, this Celtics team had a very similarly dominant season to the 2014 Spurs.</p>

      <label for="l9cyw22" class="commentText"><p>The crazy thing about this team is that not only the talent is there - let&rsquo;s be conservative and say they have guys ranked 5-10, 25-25, and like 3 around 40-50 - they&rsquo;re all versatile. 4 guards/wings who can pass, shoot, dribble, defend almost anybody, and protect the rim, all unlocked by a 7-3 unicorn who can punish switches and shoot from 30 feet.</p>

<p>Everybody is not only extremely talented, but they&rsquo;re the ultimate team player, guys who can fit on any team, guys who make everyone else&rsquo;s job easier. There might be better players out there than Jrue Holiday and Derrick White, but if you put them on the team it would be worse.</p>

<p>The 2014 Spurs beat the 2014 Miami Heat with a prime Lebron James, Dwayne Wayde, Chris Bosh, and a splash of Ray Allen.</p>

<p>The 2014 Western Conference was one of the strongest in generations, the East this year was just good.</p>

<p>Name me one player on the Celtics team that is a &ldquo;supercharged&rdquo; version of 2014 Kahwi Leonard, or even a &ldquo;supercharged&rdquo; version of 2014 Tim Duncan.</p>

<p>Its a Ridiculous statement.</p>

      <label for="l9e7mhe" class="commentText"><p>All teams can do is play the team in front of them, and not for nothing they had the best record against the West. So against the “real” competition in the West they were still performing on that level. If you watched the video you’d see how he talks about how it’s not just one player, it’s more than the sum of its parts and that’s what makes this team special. If they weren’t at this level we’re talking about, they don’t go 16-3 in the playoffs, much less 4-1 in the Finals. That net rating difference mentioned above isn’t anything to scoff at either. It’s hard to compare teams from era to era, like I said earlier all teams can do is play the ones in front of them and the competition level is always unique year to year because of that. Not worth debating who’s better, they were both all time greats in their respective era</p>

      <label for="l9eg0bh" class="commentText"><p>Respectfully, the stats don’t back that up, no matter how great and aesthetically pleasing it was to watch them. Spurs ranked 24th in net rating that year, Celtics ranked 1st. 5th best scoring margin all time regular season, and over that team’s by almost 300 points. Also edging out same stat in playoffs over them but still good for 6th all time. Spurs we’re 22nd in defensive rating, Celtics 3rd in theirs. 1.222 points per possession, most in NBA history. 3rd most wins at home, higher winning % on back to backs than the Spurs. Most 50 Pt wins NBA history, most 40 Pt wins in NBA history, most 30 point wins in NBA history and most 25 Pt wins in NBA history. Even with all this, I still don’t think you can compare the two on a “who’s better” basis. You’re saying that video didn’t provide evidence of that, but that video did nothing but show you how advanced this team is and that we haven’t seen a team LIKE this one since the 2014 Spurs. It’s not saying who’s better or worse cause, again, it is a dumb debate to get into.</p>

And positionally too, all the pieces fit together, especially from a size/strength/IQ standpoint for each position group. White and Holiday perfectly balance each other out in terms of skill set on and off the ball on both offense and defense. Same with Tatum and Brown. Same with Horford and KP.</p>

They can stop someone with incredible vision and a playmaking legend like Luka but not at Jokic&rsquo;s size. I think the Celtics needed to prioritize shutting off Gordon more in the regular season matchups, which I think is sneakily a huge part of what got Minnesota over the hump. That, and Jamal Murray slumping.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s been nothing but complimentary to Luka his whole career but Mavs fans are doing insane mental gymnastics to justify the idea that he hates them.</p>

Ben for some reason just mostly ignored them all year, and mostly last year too. Which is don’t get, the Celtics are a BBall breakdown dream.</p>

      <label for="l9f1f71" class="commentText"><p>lol at the beginning of the playoffs, when they talked about every matchup, he would basically just gloss over every Celtics series. Heat/Celtics? He was like &ldquo;do we even need to talk about this, come on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think the Celtics were a boring conversation to have for him because he doesn&rsquo;t really do the narrative stuff which is all the doubters of the team had to hang their hats on.</p>

      <label for="l9c7vks" class="commentText"><p>This is team is balanced and loaded from top to bottom. Well deserving of the title and will contend for many more years to come. But, no team will ever come close to the Pistons 04 team in terms of balance, underdog status, and lack of star power combination. Boston has top 10/ top 20 players. Detroit did not. The numbers look more balanced because Tatum didn’t need to put up big numbers. He’s a perennial MVP player. He’s in the conversation at least. Those Pistons were never even close to being in that MVP conversation at any point in their careers.</p>

So they fit well together and balanced each other out. Not sure any had been to an all star game till after they won.</p>

      <label for="l9eo5e6" class="commentText"><p>Yea this is an absolutely fair take. While watching the finals all I could really think about was how dominant they were for a team that didn&rsquo;t have a singular player that was consistently taking over. I thought back to teams in the past that were similar and the only one that I could think of at the time was the &lsquo;04 Pistons.</p>

<p>At least the Spurs had Tim Duncan who is in the top 10 of all time though he was on the decline when he won the 2014 title. I&rsquo;m not going to act like I know enough about teams in the 80&rsquo;s so I won&rsquo;t mention them</p>
