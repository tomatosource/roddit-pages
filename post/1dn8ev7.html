      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dn8ev7/the_case_for_drafting_zach_edey/"><p>The case for drafting Zach Edey</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I would like for the Lakers Front Office to consider drafting Zach Edey. Now I know the Lakers Scouting office is one of the league&rsquo;s most understaffed, so I am lending my assistance.</p>

<p>Now other possible locations that Edey could fit in would be the OKC Thunder at #12, Orlando Magic at #18 and the Phoenix Suns at #22.  I think the Thunder have better options at #12, so I believe the next logical spot is for the Lakers at #17.  But really, Edey could help any team that needs a backup center.</p>

<p>Anthony Davis struggled last season against the Nuggets and Kings. Davis has a hard time guarding Jokic(285 lbs) and Sabonis (240 lbs) for 36 minutes. Enter Zach Edey at 7&rsquo;4&rdquo; and 290 lbs.</p>

<p>Zach Edey was the most dominating player in the NCAA tournament. He single-handedly carried Purdue (who otherwise had no business being in the tournament) to the championship game. And in that game, Zach Edey could not be stopped, even by Clingan who is being projected to be a top-10 pick (and possible #1) supposedly due in part to his defense.</p>

<p>Now Zach Edey does not have a 3 point shot and will most likely not develop one. Therefore, Edey will not work in a 5-out offense that most teams in the NBA are gravitating towards.</p>

<p>Zach Edey is slow due to his size. So he will not be a switchable defender.</p>

<p>Zach Edey is a college senior, so he is an old rookie but he will be more NBA ready i.e. Jaime Jaquez Jr. Also, an athlete that can last 4 years in college makes it most likely that he is intelligent.</p>

<p>What Zach Edey does bring is another big body to put on the Jokics, the Sabonises, the Embiids, the Wembys. All Zach Edey has to do is wear these guys out for 15 minutes a game so that Anthony Davis is fresh and can take over center responsibilities in the 4th quarter.</p>

<p>The Clippers make it work with Ivica Zubac. The Timberwolves make it work with Rudy Gobert. I see no reason Zach Edey can&rsquo;t provide a positive change of pace for a few minutes a game. Zach Edey does not have to play every game, just situationally where the other team has a big center.</p>

<p>At pick #17, I don&rsquo;t see any other prospect being ready to contribute immediately. I don&rsquo;t really see any potential superstars at #17 either.</p>

<p>Zach Edey is canadian, so you know he is going to be a really nice guy. I have yet to meet a mean canadian.</p>

<p>I rest my case for Zach Edey. I hope the Lakers Front Office considers my petition.  But Edey could actually help any team from pick #7 on up.</p>
