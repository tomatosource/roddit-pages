<p>“Everything that happened was meant to be, and I have faith that God in all his goodness is looking out for me,” said the man who will now have to spend the next several years of his life living in central Florida and playing for a franchise that squandered the prime of several generational superstars.</p>

<p>Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal suffered a frustrating setback during his team&rsquo;s victory over the Toronto Raptors Tuesday night, when he was sidelined for the entire second half of the game with a pulled pork sandwich.</p>

<p>O&rsquo;Neal, who scored 12 points and grabbed three rebounds during the first half of the game, returned to the bench at the beginning of the third quarter, clutching at the pulled pork sandwich and informing trainers that it was &lsquo;incredibly tender&rsquo;.</p>
