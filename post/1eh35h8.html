<blockquote>
<p>For the moment, Richardson was feel-good story. He had overcome mountainous obstacles and proved many critics wrong, refuting their belief of him deteriorating as a basketball player after his earlier cocaine abuse.</p>

<p>He signed a new four-year, $3 million contract in early September, participated in an NBA anti-drug video entitled <em>Cocaine Drain</em>, and, according to Net officials, passed every one of the weekly drug tests mandated by his contract.</p>

<p>Richardson had no plans of reverting back to his old lifestyle, a lifestyle that had turned him to a period of complete darkness and away from his family, friends, and teammates.</p>

<p>Buck Williams, Richardson&rsquo;s former teammate and close friend, said that &ldquo;he seemed to have the world by the coattails.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Until he relapsed once again.</p>

<p>This appears to be the backstory of what you are talking about.</p>

      <label for="lfwm9bq" class="commentText"><p>Also found this on it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Milwaukee Bucks were subjected to another form of learning yesterday at their training camp at Marquette University. The normal morning practice was replaced by a four-hour workshop devoted to drug awareness and education. It included a 40-minute video, three months in the making, titled &ldquo;Cocaine Drain.&rdquo; Three counselors from the National Basketball Association&rsquo;s adult substance and abuse program will conduct similar workshops at the other 22 camps.</p>

<p>Micheal Ray Richardson of the Nets, John Lucas of the Houston Rockets and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar of the Los Angeles Lakers all related their past experiences with cocaine on the video as a warning.</p>

<p>Richardson&rsquo;s drug problems caused the Nets to waive him out of the league during the 1982-83 season. He said that he then attended a drug-rehabilitation program so that he could resume his career. &ldquo;When they put me out of the league, I started spending all my cash. I hit rock bottom and that&rsquo;s when I started to realize it wasn&rsquo;t for me,&rdquo; Richardson said.</p>

<p>How much money did he spend on drugs? &ldquo;I guess about 60 or 70 grand easy,&rdquo; he told Charles Grantham, the executive vice president of the National Basketball Players Association, who produced the video. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of guys that spent two or three million, so $60,000 is not really that much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lucas said he tried cocaine because &ldquo;I became bored by what I was doing. I wanted to seek some adventure.&rdquo; He then added: &ldquo;I let my teammates down, I let myself down. I lost some money. Lost my job. A career. Fortunately, I got it back.&rdquo; As for advice on staying away from drugs, Lucas said: &ldquo;The friends &hellip; creates what you are. If you&rsquo;re around people who don&rsquo;t do that, then you won&rsquo;t have that problem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And how did Abdul-Jabbar get involved with drugs?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found myself coming out of college and all of a sudden I had some money in my pocket and I was curious enough to try it. I had one frightening experience where I ended up altering my personality so much that I was some type of race car driver and I ended up spinning my car out&hellip; . I could have wrecked the car and could have injured myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The video also includes advice against drug use by some big names in pro basketball, past and present, who have never been linked to drug use.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t see myself doing something that I can get arrested for and my freedom taken away,&rdquo; said Julius Erving of the Philadelphia 76ers.</p>

<p>Merrill Lynch, which sponsored the production, plans to make the tape available to schools and colleges throughout the nation.</p>
