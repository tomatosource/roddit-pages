<p>History shows that the main beneficiaries of the hand-checking rules change were small, quick, weaker guards like Iverson, Nash, and Tony Parker.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty simple - the smaller a guy is, the more you&rsquo;ll be able to steer him with the strength of your hand/forearm. You can push 190 lbs further than you can push 230 lbs.</p>

<p>Bigger, stronger guards like Kobe and Joe Johnson weren&rsquo;t affected much, as their strength allowed them to deal better with defensive contact. This is also why you don&rsquo;t see that &ldquo;power guard&rdquo; build anymore (besides Luka) - without a need to counter hand-checking, there&rsquo;s not much advantage to it.</p>

I also don’t think the hand-checking is doing as much to his off-the-dribble game because of the three-point threat, he doesn’t rely as much on blow-bys as some others.</p>

      <label for="lo9leco" class="commentText"><p>it definitely had an impact, but it also may be true that it is overstated to an extent, relative to other changes.  I don&rsquo;t see where he said it was &ldquo;trivial&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m not one of those fans who thinks one era was &ldquo;better&rdquo; or &ldquo;harder&rdquo; than another.  All eras had specific challenges and favored certain skillsets more than others.</p>

<p>In the 80s and 90s it was generally harder to be as dynamic offensively due to both hand checking and stricter standards for travelling and carrying.  You needed to have good positional size, strength, and length as a defender or you would get targeted on the block - even many point guards had post games back then, because you could always run iso and it was illegal for the defense to do any kind of digging or soft help.  Teams tended to favor tough rugged defenders at all positions to the detriment of ball skills, outside of a couple stars.</p>

<p>And in the 2000s and especially 2010s it became much harder to be an iso style player (especially starting around 2004 when the pistons really pioneered a kind of proto matchup zone, and then in 2007 when the Celtics really perfected it).   But it became easier to be an attacking down hill style player with a re-emphasis on the hand-checking prohibition (which technically started in the 90s but wasn&rsquo;t enforced all that well).  It also became in general much harder to exist as a non-shooter without hurting your team because deep sagging into the paint became legal and normal.  But it was easier to exist as a smaller player or weaker defender, because defense was more team-oriented.</p>

<p>It also changed the nature of defender that was desired.  For instance Marcus Camby was considered kind of a disappointing player, and then those rule changes came in and it turned out that kind of C was extremely valuable against more dynamic offenses.</p>

      <label for="lo9fv7h" class="commentText"><p>Agree with most of this… palming was a dumb rule to begin with, imo.  The sport was bound to naturally evolve out of that.</p>

<p>Eliminating zone, defensive 3 in the key, and allowing all manner of screens has essentially turned the game into all offense. Its kind of wild how athletic you have to be to play “legal” defense as a guard/wing</p>

<p>EDIT: I think they should widen the court, extend the short corner to regular 3 distance and allow at least 5 seconds in the key for defenses… it adds to the pace and space movement while still allowing defenses to defend the rim at a high level.</p>

<p>It just creates a better chess match.</p>

<p>I’m not suggesting it will eliminate lay ups… just that you’ll have to have certain personnel to take advantage.  Today you can run DHO with a non shooter setting illegal screens and force a 2 on 1 at the rim or a wide open 3 for a pull up master</p>

Again, I&rsquo;m not saying eliminating hand checking didn&rsquo;t matter, only that it&rsquo;s overrated in comparison to making zones legal, which basically ended the dominance of post play offenses as we knew it up until that point.</p>

      <label for="lo9gbsi" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I get people don’t like Embiid’s foul baiting but it’s mostly contact on the arm in a normal shooting motion or the rip through move and neither would be impacted by hand checking much beyond maybe making it harder to get to his spots</p>

<p>Honestly it probably benefits Embiid. If he&rsquo;s getting hand-checked, he can&rsquo;t blow his knees out every season trying to do guard shit.</p>

<p>Nobody can match his combo of strength + ball handling + speed</p>

<p>He’d dribble sideways like Magic Johnson and you wouldn’t be able to get around his big ass shoulder to get to the ball</p>

<p>and then you turn around and realize you have to dribble the ball up the court with Lebron James hand-checking you </p>

      <label for="lo9pg9m" class="commentText"><p>Hand checking is overrated. Players doing rip through would just make the other players foul out. I respect the previous generation as much as the other guy, but go watch those games where defence reigned supreme. Bogged down spacing, usually teams would play 2 big men who can’t shoot and a wing player who can’t shoot, and teams playing so slow, having to allow the bigs to get to the post up and coaches being more strict about play calls, made the defence look better than it was. If nba teams today played multiple guys who cant shoot and won’t shoot play 30+ minutes, defences would look a lot more effective</p>

      <label for="lo9oo0o" class="commentText"><p>Nah. Curry might suffer a little but definitely not as much as guys who rely on blowing by defenders, which Curry does not. Curry is also stronger than a lot of other smaller guards, he shrugs off contact well and has a strong upper body. Plus hand checking is not going to hurt his off-ball shooting at all considering teams already do it.</p>

<p>Consider, Abdul-Rauf was a successful player with a similar style despite being smaller and worse at almost every skill compared to Curry. Curry would be fine.</p>
