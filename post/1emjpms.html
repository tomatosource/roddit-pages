      <p>“I go back to a role where 7 seconds to go, give me the ball. Watch me rock. Uh, isolation, step back. I get to hoop. You know, that&rsquo;s what people forget about. Like, it&rsquo;s cool.

      <label for="lgzef8z" class="commentText"><p>Amin Elhassan often likes to tell the story about when Tony Parker first came into the NBA from France and met his new teammate Bruce Bowen:</p>

<p>Tony was apparently <strong>starstruck</strong> when he met Bowen because Bruce started his pro career in France, and he remembered Bowen as a star player / prolific scorer for French teams like Le Havre, Évreux and Besançon, and assumed his role was similar in the NBA.</p>

<p>Imagine his surprise when he saw Bowen playing for the Spurs, almost exclusively spotting up for 3 and doing all the dirty work on the defensive end.</p>

<p>I always felt the story really illustrates two things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There is a stupidly wide gap between the level of basketball talent in the NBA and the rest of the professional basketball world</p></li>

<li><p>the most successful NBA players who aren’t anointed the volume scoring role are the ones who know to play within their role, despite technically being capable of much more offensively</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A recent-ish Alex Caruso quote also really helps drive home point 2:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“A big reason guys get stuck in the G-League is because they don’t realize the position they’re trying out for. It’s like going to a job interview thinking you’re going to be the CFO of the company, and they’re looking for someone to clean the bathrooms.”</em></p>

      <label for="lgzpirx" class="commentText"><p>Austin Rivers said the same thing. That he was even guilty of, thinking that you&rsquo;d have the ball in your hands 50% of the time on offense, and everyone else would do the rebounding, defense, off ball movement, screens, etc. while you found your footing in the NBA.  Even top picks have to work their way in, and start with a sacrifice first mindset.</p>

      <label for="lgzok3r" class="commentText"><p>I mean P bev said he&rsquo;s had a phenomenal career in the NBA which is just a bold face lie. He&rsquo;s never amounted to anything in the playoffs and every team he&rsquo;s ever been on chokes. He&rsquo;s been a nuisance in the locker room and on the court yet has no play to back it up. He&rsquo;s been more of a problem for the team he&rsquo;s playing for than the one he&rsquo;s playing for. His best season was like 12 pts a game off the bench for the clippers in peak choke era. Bro is a punk that got ran out of the league. Imagine been worse than Dillon Brooks. Career 8pts a game avg commits more fouls than good defensive plays
Edit: actually he played 11 games that season with 12 PPG his best season was like 2015 with the rockets 10 PPG</p>

He’s a film study guide on defense, clawed his way out of Russia and into the league and has hung around as a role player for 11 years. But you look at basketball from the lens of a TikTok kid. Superstars have retired earlier than him because they did not know their roles and ran out???. He left because he’s finished in the nba. He’s set for life and ready to have. He’s not a could be like melo or begging for a spot like Dwight on X so don’t downplay him.</p>

<p>Deep down I can never bring myself to hate him because I do find him hilarious if we’re being completely honest, but injuring Westbrook the way he did is genuinely inexcusable IMO</p>

<p>And while I think the hatred was overblown because people already didn’t like him beforehand, I also think the way he treated that reported and kicked her out was completely classless</p>

Some teams, the superstars just do their iso plays and you go stand in the corner to bail them if they kick it out or all you do is screens only. No ball movement. It sucks.</p>

      <label for="lgzjh57" class="commentText"><p>I like how more and more nba players explain this and show that players aren&rsquo;t as obsessed with winning as people think</p>

<p>Hopefully some dumbass fans stop thinking jerami grant, who dipped from a WCF team to the pistons, in order to be a featured scoring option, would want to join a contender</p>

<p>And Pat Bev has a history of shitting on his former team after he gets traded or doesn&rsquo;t get another offer.</p>

      <label for="lgzfplu" class="commentText"><p>Bev had offers, and he definitely hasn’t been relegated to corner duty his whole career. Even as recently as the wolves he had secondary ball handler duties (primary when dlo was off the court)</p>

<p>Dude just wants a bigger role and knew he wasn’t getting that in the NBA, it’s just realism</p>
