<p>EDIT: I feel like I have to clear up some misconceptions. To have plausible deniability, <em>it should be sonething you are actually willing to consume</em>. It can&rsquo;t be ghost pepper-level spicy unless you actually like eating ghost peppers. Also, <strong>I am not a lawyer</strong>, if you want to do this, consult one.</p>

<p>I truly hope that people aren&rsquo;t getting their advice from online comment sections. But knowing how many unfortunately do: DO NOT TELL BLATANTLY OBVIOUS LIES TO JUDGES. They are not idiots. Internet wisery does not work on them. And that is a crime with far more serious implications and punishments.</p>

<p>There isn’t any clause that says judges must accept inane bullshit the first time it’s tried - they’re quite free to just dismiss it outright. </p>

<p>All it really accomplishes is making sure the judge knows you think they’re a complete moron. Rarely a great legal move to begin your case by pissing off the judge for no reason.</p>

De niro was right, trump and his cronies are a bunch of two bit gangsters that need to be dealt with the same way we dealt with the mob. Swiftly and without fear of reprisals because you know the cause is just. I am forced to conclude these judges care more about themselves then the good of the country and therefore they are cowards who history will not look kindly upon in the future because they failed to uphold the law when they had the chance and instead delegitimized the entire legal system on behalf of a con man and theif trying to destroy America.

<p>Or they do as you ask, and the entire justice system is suddenly illegitimate in the eyes of half the country, and everything goes straight to hell.</p>

<p>Or you can do things by the book, without personal discretion, and have a much higher chance of &ldquo;trump in prison&rdquo; without the whole &ldquo;burn everything to the ground&rdquo; issue.</p>

<p>Trump&rsquo;s supporters will see a discretionary detention by a judge as political violence, and WILL respond in kind. It&rsquo;s not just the judge&rsquo;s life at stake. People will see their candidate taken from them arbitrarily, decide that democracy is dead, and act accordingly.</p>

<p>Voting is the pressure valve for political violence, preventing a candidate from campaigning/ being elected will not end well.</p>

<p>Judges, in general, aren&rsquo;t stupid. They absolutely do not take kindly to these &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo; moments that Reddit loves so much.</p>

<p>Yall are gonna get sued so hard one day taking Reddit advice on legal matters x-x</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was an accidentally high dose, I&rsquo;m lucky I didn&rsquo;t eat it myself. I labelled it poison precisely because it was dosed with laxatives for personal use and I didn&rsquo;t want my coworkers exposed to what could be unpleasant for them&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l69bfsm" class="commentText"><p>And do you have any medical records or a history showing that you regularly buy these laxatives? No? Then case closed.</p>

<p>See my middle paragraph. Judges aren&rsquo;t stupid, they&rsquo;ve heard this all before. You intentionally harmed someone and caused them to lose wages to missed work and racked up medical debt. Maybe you&rsquo;ll get lucky and be assigned a judge on their first day on the job, but more likely you&rsquo;ll get one that&rsquo;ll throw the book at you for lying to him.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t lie in court, especially when you&rsquo;re lying this badly. It won&rsquo;t end well.</p>

It can cause excessive vomiting which can lead to complications like a ruptured esophagus.

      <label for="l69inv6" class="commentText"><p>Make some chilli. Spice accordingly. Then bring a tub of sour cream and some tortillas with you. This is how my family eats it: make it really hot then mix the sour cream in to mellow out the spice and scoop with tortillas or bread. It&rsquo;s absolutely delicious, but if you were to just eat the chilli on its own, you would be regretting it big time. Obviously I know that the tub of sour cream and tortillas are meant to go with the meal, but it&rsquo;s not my fault that (coworker) didn&rsquo;t know and decided to just eat MY chilli on its own.</p>

The defendant isn’t required to testify in court, and that can’t be held against them. Furthermore, it’s the prosecution’s job to provide proof beyond reasonable doubt; essentially, they would have to prove that you don’t like spicy food, which is essentially impossible.</p>

And it seems unlikely a court would make you heat a spicy sandwich in the courtroom to prove it&rsquo;s something you enjoy.

<p>If writing &ldquo;poison&rdquo; was all that was needed to exonerate oneself, then it could be argued that if someone else saw the sign and added poison to the food, thinking that even the owner wasn&rsquo;t going to eat it, and the owner died from it, no one would be responsible for murder because whoever added the poison wouldn&rsquo;t think they were harming anyone.</p>

<p>The intent is critical. If you put a spicy soup in the fridge and someone eats it, they&rsquo;re the asshole. If you put a spicy soup in the fridge <em>so that</em> someone eats it, you&rsquo;ve committed a crime.</p>

<p>Or there are bags that are not steel to which one could add a padlock on the zipper.</p>

<p>While stealing someone else’s food is apparently not illegal, damaging their lunch bag probably is at least a nuisance crime of vandalism or willful property damage or something.</p>

<p>They should set up a nanny cam to record evidence and put a “this room is recorded” sign up to cover their butts and make the video admissible.</p>

<p>I also totally understand the anger that would build up from being stolen from over and over again, nobody stopping them because &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just food get over it&rdquo; and knowing they won&rsquo;t stop when you make it clear it&rsquo;s happening by taking time to label the food. It&rsquo;s intensely dehumanising to be stolen from repeatedly, especially if they knew the coworker.</p>

<p>I think this guy did something wrong but completely understandable. Whenever I see this post people defend the victim a lot and I get that it&rsquo;s disproportionate but I still don&rsquo;t think the perpetrator should be punished.</p>

If someone is constantly getting their food taken <em>and</em> being reminded that no one else gives a shit, that’s going to light a fire under their ass to take matters into their own hands.</p>

<p>I’ve witnessed people being on the bad end of a laxative prank, it’s totally plausible to think the perpetrator (not the thief) underestimated the potency of laxatives. Not saying that excuses putting the thief in the hospital, but explains it as a misjudgment rather than an intended effect.</p>

It&rsquo;s not someone stealing here and there because they&rsquo;re hungry or lazy. They&rsquo;re targeting that guy in particular, and considering he&rsquo;s probably complained about it, they know exactly whose lunch they&rsquo;re stealing. Not saying that justifies putting someone in the hospital, but it&rsquo;s clearly a deliberate pattern of theft and bullying.</p>

      <label for="l69esjx" class="commentText"><p>I think that comes from the “it’s their own fault” camp.</p>

<p>Like, because the perpetrator got harmed due to their own actions, despite being both asked to stop and warned, people generally don’t think the guy who did the poisoning did anything wrong because they effectively gave the thief an out.</p>

<p>It’s sorta like how generally speaking, someone who gets mauled by a guard dog while breaking into a place with a beware of dog sign is usually gonna get way less sympathy than someone who gets mauled in the wild.</p>

<p>The combo of being warned and being “in the wrong” makes people feel the consequences are effectively self inflicted rather than the fault of the one who got the dog</p>

      <label for="l6915q7" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s such a strong taboo around eating the last of the shared food in the office that you can actually get negatively stigmatized in an unspoken way for eating the last of something the next day if it&rsquo;s still in the fridge, which is fucking weird. You always hear about people getting their food eaten from the mutual fridge, but I&rsquo;ve never heard it happen. It&rsquo;s more likely that people either won&rsquo;t be allowed to take lunch away from their desk, or won&rsquo;t have time to finish their food, and there&rsquo;s kind of a soft taboo against packing a lunch in some offices rather than going out or joining a group order. There&rsquo;s also a kind of weird thing where occasionally managers will pick a random date and make a big deal out of throwing stuff out that&rsquo;s in the fridge, no matter what it is.</p>

<p>There is no American continent in English, since it’s divided into North and South America, while there is only one continent of America in Spanish</p>

<p>This causes confusion since you wouldn’t think the continents are something that vary from country to country</p>

<p>The Wikipedia page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas" target="_blank">the Americas</a> refers to it as a landmass comprised of North and South America. In Spanish Wikipedia, <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/América" target="_blank">America</a> is referred to as the second largest continent, these are both considered the same page when you use the switch language thing on the site</p>

<p>People are all &ldquo;I believe in prison abolition and against retributive justice&rdquo; only to then turn around and say the guy who poisoned someone over a stolen meal is based actually. This is not me treating people as monoliths, every time this is posted I&rsquo;ve seen people say the guy was in the right while criticising retributive justice in another post.</p>

Whenever this topic comes up on Reddit people confuse the two, and the threads are full of horrible advice with redditors assuring each other this is fine and you will definitely get away with it.</p>

<p>If you poison someone, even mildly, even someone who sucks and totally deserves it, there&rsquo;s a very real possibility you will face criminal charges or have to pay their hospital bills. Don&rsquo;t poison food that you expect somebody to steal.</p>

<p>But also this isn&rsquo;t retributive justice, this is behaviour adjustment. It&rsquo;s still bad, treating your coworkers like lab rats or puppies in training, but this didn&rsquo;t occur after the incident of food theft. This occurred because the food was stolen and consumed by the thief. This is just like making a Nintendo cartridge taste bitter so kids don&rsquo;t swallow it.</p>

<p>suggest an alternative that doesn&rsquo;t involve some authority figure who previously hasn&rsquo;t cared suddenly magically caring because you said so. if you don&rsquo;t, and you just say &ldquo;don&rsquo;t do X&rdquo; but don&rsquo;t offer a &ldquo;do Y instead&rdquo;, i&rsquo;ll have to conclude that you don&rsquo;t actually give a shit about the victim, you&rsquo;re only invested in the abuser&rsquo;s safety.</p>

<p>edit, since you blocked me over this: they don&rsquo;t count because they don&rsquo;t stop the abuse, and therefore they&rsquo;re equivalent to a request to just keep enduring the abuse. this isn&rsquo;t rocket science lmao. but the block does show just how much good faith you really have here</p>

<p>edit 2: yeah, after letting them express their point. but sure, that&rsquo;s the same thing to you, right?</p>

<p>stop being a fucking bully. why is that so difficult to you? why are you this fucking invested in keeping the abuser safe without any consideration whatsoever given to the victim, <em>even when it is pointed out to you black and white,</em> that you&rsquo;re immediately jumping to abuse reddit&rsquo;s block functionality just to try to enforce the last word and get your way?</p>

It&rsquo;s a long war against the bullied, and it&rsquo;s very often purely psychological&ndash;like stealing someone&rsquo;s lunches over and over and over again. And nothing ever seems to stop them, because whatever the bully is doing simply isn&rsquo;t <em>that bad</em>, so they can keep at it forever and ever. It&rsquo;s just words. It&rsquo;s just a lunch. You can&rsquo;t talk them into not doing it. Doesn&rsquo;t work. They&rsquo;ll say whatever it necessary to shut up the authority for that moment, then they&rsquo;ll wait a bit, and start right up. And repeat.</p>

<p>And they do it because the authority <em>takes your position</em>.</p>

<p>So, your position fundamentally is that bullies should be allowed to harass and belittle anyone forever, so long as authorities don&rsquo;t immediately shitcan them. You may say you don&rsquo;t <em>want</em> that, but that&rsquo;s the net result.</p>

<p>You know what <em>does</em> get bullies to stop? Immediate, negative response. Like finding out the food they stole had laxatives and they shit themselves. Then they stop.</p>

<p>Try and find a jury that doesn&rsquo;t hate food thieves. Go ahead, try. As the defendant, you have the right to a trial by Jury. If the worst thing that happened is that they shat themselves and had an upset tummy and got scared and went to the hospital, you&rsquo;d probably get away with it. At the very least, prosecution would offer a pretty generous plea deal to avoid the expense of going to trial and losing.</p>

<p>Now, the part that&rsquo;s risky is what if they have a bad reaction to the laxatives? What if you get the dosage wrong? What if they suffer some rare side effects? What if they die or get seriously injured? If there are actual damages, then the jury will not be as sympathetic.</p>

<p>Not to mention, your workplace is not bound by the legal system, they are fully within their rights to fire you for poisoning another employee.</p>

There is no universe in which I think any person would expect that a normal, healthy person would get sent to the hospital for unexpectedly taking laxatives. If I didn&rsquo;t know that the person used a fake &ldquo;poison do not eat&rdquo; marking for several weeks beforehand, and I didn&rsquo;t know the type of person who would do stuff like this, I would be really concerned for them, but because I DO know the type of person who would steal someone&rsquo;s lunch for a month and how they think and that they were given a warning, I&rsquo;d be at least willing to entertain the idea that they weren&rsquo;t actually in danger and they just went to the hospital and pretended to think they were dying over normal stomach cramps and diarrhea just to get their way.</p>

<p>&hellip;what? Laxatives are a drug, which can only be used sparingly and in medical contexts. They have specific fucking warnings on the bottles.</p>

<p>People like you are why toy broomsticks have to have &ldquo;warning: does not actually fly&rdquo; stickers put on them.</p>

      <label for="l68dpz2" class="commentText"><p>I’m not justifying their actions, since morally they’re wrong to put potential poisons in their food just to stop it from being stolen, but what I think a lot of people gloss over is the impact of micro-aggressions over a long period of time.</p>

<p>Having your lunch taken once is annoying. Twice? Sure, but still tolerable. Constantly for several weeks? Then it becomes a threat to one’s sanctity. It’s a pattern they are powerless to stop, and removing agency from a person is scary. They can’t have control over their own belongings, and this is deeply upsetting.</p>

<p>While it may seem superficial and minor, that’s only per instance. When culminating every small event, and how they have a compounding effect on a person’s psychological wellbeing, we find that the series of events is as impactful as one dramatic event. It’s abuse at that point.</p>

<p>And when people are being constantly abused, they may find themselves looking toward solutions that would otherwise be heinous or unthinkable. It’s more a shift in societal mindset to acknowledge the severity of a series of smaller abuses being equal to the severity of sparse larger abuses.</p>

Unless you are starving, stealing the lunch of a coworker (who probably has to go hungry for the workday themselves as a result) is really low. Stealing food that is clearly labeled as poison is not only anti-social but also profoundly stupid.</p>

<p>Also, being stolen from repeatedly, after being warned against it is genuinely dehumanising. Especially food in a work environment, it&rsquo;s a small pleasure being consistently taken away. It makes you want to do whatever you can to feel like you have control. I&rsquo;d treat it like a form of abuse.</p>

<p>I worked at a place once where it wasn&rsquo;t feasible to leave and get food on lunch because all the places that sold food were too far away to pull that off. I would have been absolutely pissed if I found out I just don&rsquo;t get lunch now because someone took my food&hellip;</p>

<p>I suggest getting a cooler and a bunch of icepacks and leaving it in your car if at all possible.</p>

<p><strong>A police officer who was accused of poisoning a colleague&rsquo;s drink has been found not guilty.</strong></p>

<p>In April, Gary Quigley admitted lacing an energy drink with car screen wash and placing it in a fridge in a police office in Stratford, London, last year.</p>

<p>He changed his plea in May, denying administering a noxious substance with intent. He was cleared following a trial at Southwark Crown Court.</p>

<p>Metropolitan Police said the detective constable remained suspended from duty.</p>

<p>At the trial, the court was told the man who drank from the bottle was taken to hospital and later discharged.</p>

<p>A police spokesman said Mr Quigley, who works in the Met&rsquo;s Child Abuse Investigation Command, was &ldquo;suspended pending the outcome of misconduct proceedings&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And yet, I never attempted to poison anyone. Clearly, I must be a saint, with iron will. Or maybe I&rsquo;m just a normal fucking person who doesn&rsquo;t try to poison others.</p>

      <label for="l6aozc5" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not 6 dollars worth of food they&rsquo;ve been doing this over and over again for weeks it&rsquo;s probably added up to hundreds already.</p>

<p>People keep calling it &ldquo;petty theft&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s targeted and consistent. It&rsquo;s bullying at the very least, abuse via malnourishment at the worst.</p>

Or you can let your leftovers sit a bit too long before bringing them in. There are any number of ways to accidentally poison yourself with food.</p>
