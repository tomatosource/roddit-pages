      <label for="l5pk8rc" class="commentText"><p>It should be obvious but it’s important to make it clear. The world absolutely cannot afford to normalise the use of any kind of nuclear weapon - not even smaller tactical nukes.</p>

<p>If Russia are dumb enough to go that far, there need to be extreme consequences. Militarily, of course, but also economically. Existing sanctions have still left them some room to manoeuvre, but if they went nuclear, everything would need to be tightened up. Anybody who buys oil from Russia would be subject to the same sanctions (including China, India, and Turkey).</p>

<p>Militarily, destroying every last Russian position in Ukraine would be appropriate (it’s appropriate now…). I don’t think it would stop there, either - any future Russian bullshit, like incursions in to other countries airspace, would be immediately shot down and possibly prompt retaliatory strikes on their navy or other assets around the world. Every time you breach our airspace, you lose the planes, and a ship.</p>

<p>Again - we cannot normalise the use of nuclear weapons whatsoever. That is already maximum escalation short of WW3, and must be met with a maximum response short of WW3.</p>

<p>Should a nuclear event occur and beyond the necessary military response - any business or subsidiary or parent of that business doing business with Russia should be sanctioned and given a rapid ultimatum to stop doing business with Russia immediately and permanently, or be banned from any western economies. This includes nations - to the scale in which any business with Russia must halt or all industries within that nation will also be sanctioned.</p>

<p>Russia is a cancer, and I&rsquo;m sorry to the portion of the population there that isn&rsquo;t in support of the genocidal lunatics in charge, but if they start tossing around nukes then the only sane strategic decision is a decapitation strike that hits all their ability to use nuclear weapons, all at once.</p>

<p>Use of nuclear weapons needs to be met with total annihilation.  That&rsquo;s the precedent to set.</p>

<p>People forget this, but that was the understanding at the time.</p>

<p>There were even close call incidents. I think 1983 or so the Soviets saw something coming on radar, and the guy in charge could have triggered the whole thing, but luckily he didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Yes, but by the time there were thousands and thousands of nukes on both sides, nobody believed they could just launch a first strike without getting hit in turn. You can throw thousands of missiles at their launch sites…and they’ll see them coming and launch their own. Submarines in particular almost guarantee a second-strike capability.</p>

      <label for="l5pv8ie" class="commentText"><p>As it turns out there are actually 2 well known close call incidents, the one you refer to is probably the closer one, a soviet early warning satellite malfunctioned, and the officer judged the apparent incoming missiles to be a false alarm, decided to go against protocol and not order a retaliatory nuclear strike. Stanislav Petrov is a hero for this imo.</p>

<p>The other one was during the Cuba crisis, a soviet nuclear submarine&rsquo;s communications between them and the USSR had gone down due to technical problems and unknown to them Cuba had been naval blockaded by the US. The US detected the submarine so were dropping signalling depth charges to try to force the submarine to surface.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the explosions were interpreted by the captain of the sub that nuclear war had already started, and he ordered the subs largest nuclear weapon fired on the aircraft carrier leading the blockade. However amazingly, that specific sub was the ONLY one of the flotilla that required not 2 senior officers to agree to fire their nuclear weapons, but 3. Meaning <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Arkhipov" target="_blank">Vasily Arkhipov</a>, who was the executive officer of the sub, had to agree to fire. He did not, and a argument broke out between them. Fortunately Vasily had gained significant reputation from courageous action in a previous incident, and was also chief of staff of the whole flotilla. This appears to have been what allowed him to sway the captain to surface and make contact with Moscow before firing. Obviously they did not order them to fire, and nuclear war was averted.</p>

      <label for="l5pt1ey" class="commentText"><p>Not decades ago, but more likely now. There is a good amount of information regarding the degradation of Russias nuclear capacity due to lack of maintenance. Apparently once you have nukes, you then spend massive amounts or resources keeping them exactly functional for decades on end. Russia doesn’t even have wheels for troop transport, and experts believe their nuclear arsenal is vastly non-functioning. Add to that the 5 Eyes ability to know exact what Russia is doing all the time…yeah, it might be possible for a first strike.</p>

<p>It’s still insane, but nukes are basically just weaponized human insanity.</p>

<p>Same with a regime change, Putin isn&rsquo;t just a man per se. His entire cabinet is filled with people that were installed by him, and you can&rsquo;t just dismantle an entire government like Russia, with the worlds largest nuclear arsenal and not expect a pretty drastic response.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we can only hope to avoid the use of these weapons at all. If they are used, all bets are off. It would mean that Russia isn&rsquo;t adverse to using them, and that war with the west would be inevitable.</p>

      <label for="l5pexxw" class="commentText"><p>What we see in the news is largely theater and posturing with a shred of truth- something to keep in mind.</p>

<p>Russia&rsquo;s military doctrine, &ldquo;escalate to de-escalate,&rdquo; coupled with the narcissistic/dictator behavior of Putin makes this entire war a wild card- a situation that is only more unstable the more he loses.</p>

<p>A logical man would not use nukes. A logical man likewise would not invade Ukraine and target civilian infrastructure (literally repeating history from Germany/United Kingdom from WW2). A logical man would posture and slowly pull back to claim victory, instead of burning through his military and economic reserves.</p>

<p>And yet here we are.</p>

<p>Logic has a back seat to this battle, and emotion, ego, and pride is at the forefront. That, coupled with a genuine disconnect to the Russian Government&rsquo;s military culture from those in the West (be it the Public or government leaders), acceptable losses, and methods of dealing with conflict make this scenario far more unstable than I think many people are willing to admit. Goodness, there&rsquo;s a book &ldquo;War Day&rdquo; which details how a nuclear war started through a bunch of misunderstandings- Russia being backed into a corner with NATO deploying an anti-nuclear satellite umbrella- so they launched.</p>

<p>That makes complete sense, given Russia&rsquo;s military doctrine.</p>

<p>Add in the abrupt reveal of Russia developing an nuclear anti-satellite weapon earlier this year, and that raises all the red flags for me (career in Emergency Management here, and long-time prepper.) Because the vast majority of reports simply listed an Electromagnetic Pulse as a side-effect, glossing over the potential impact.</p>

<p>If you put a nuke on a satellite, that&rsquo;s the <em>primary</em> effect. And an EMP attack is truly the stuff of nightmares that can destroy the power grid of a nation. (There was actually a Federal Commission to study the phenomenon, and I was privileged enough to have spoken with the late head of said Commission.)</p>

<p>TLDR? The entire situation, taken in context, is a lot more tenuous than I think many people understand due to differing cultures and military doctrines. To acknowledge this is to not hope for escalation. I certainly don&rsquo;t hope for such a thing.</p>

<p>But you&rsquo;d better believe I don&rsquo;t like how things are looking and have adjusted my behavior accordingly, and rapidly.</p>

<p>Very blurry line, with massive potential consequences if Russia decided they should respond directly to the UK.</p>

<p>Ukraine was a calculated risk, the narrative swings so often that it’s hard to say if Putin made a mistake or not, yet to be seen. And it’s certainly nothing like going to war with the entire west at once.</p>

<p>Putin values his own life and power too much, despite his ego and propaganda he is well aware the consequence of launching a nuke at a NATO country is Russia being nuked into nonexistence from multiple sides</p>

<p>Also remember that despite the looks, Putin is not a man alone in this decision, he’s gotta answer to the oligarchs and the oligarchs may not be interested in a nuclear winter. He leans too far in that direction and might have poison or a plane crash in his future.</p>

<p>Edit: if you don&rsquo;t believe me, the fact is the oligarchs that are not allied to Putin are exiled, imprisoned and/or get killed. E.g. see <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2022/09/22/accidental-defenestration-and-murder-suicides-too-common-among-russian-oligarchs-and-putin" target="_blank">https://www.euronews.com/2022/09/22/accidental-defenestration-and-murder-suicides-too-common-among-russian-oligarchs-and-putin</a></p>

<p>Oligarchs might be able to influence Putin a little bit, but their money and power is due to the grace of Putin, and they are aware of that. You know, behave or end up in prison and/or dead.</p>

<p>Which really just leads me more and more to think that Russia&rsquo;s nuclear arsenal by now is by and large dysfunctional and broken so all Russia can do now is try to keep up the illusion that they are still a major nuclear power.</p>

<p>Especially considering the corruption surrounding their military since the officers and soldiers never expected there to be an ACTUAL war, the people responsible for nukes would be even less expecting for a NUCLEAR war to break out or any nuke to even be used in a test (since prior to the war tests were banned), making them warheads that just &ldquo;stood around the entire time&rdquo;, pure showpieces, so who will care if something goes missing or just doesn&rsquo;t get the maintenance it should?</p>

<p>There was a huge scandal in the Chinese military recently because almost all of their nuclear silo hatches were broken and refused to open. I doubt Russia&rsquo;s arsenal is in a much better state.</p>

What is there to use nukes on?  Unless the intent is assured destruction and we’re just ending society…who or what would Putin aim the nuke at?  It’s not like WW2 where total war allowed cities to become mega factories or you were trying to break a nation to surrender (yes he could break Ukraine but it wouldn’t end the war like it did with Japan, only worsen it…).
A carrier group would hurt, but Ukraine doesn’t have that….
Where’s the tactical target of a nuke?</p>

They don’t need to nuke anyone really. They need to win conventionally in post Soviet countries, with a hybrid war with west using refugees on the border, provocations like recent “we will change maritime borders in Baltic see unilaterally “, green men without insignia in some shithole village in Estonia, no one will want to start ww3. The mere defeat of Ukraine, full destruction of its cities and Russia at the borders of Poland, Rumania , etc , will already change electoral processes, with people voting for parties who will want to negotiate with Russia (like Orbab). They will get OST-block and Balkans back under their influence without any rockets. It’s already happening , if you look at Slovakia and North Macedonia. With many such countries in EU and NATO, both organizations will become even more difficult to work, and potentially collapse. I think people need to think much more about helping Ukraine.</p>

      <label for="l5pnsap" class="commentText"><p>Two points:</p>

<p>Neither side in such a confrontation can back down. Fundamental to MAD, is that use of nuclear weapons is suicide; if one side is able to use them, the other must respond. Brinksmanship is already a tool of Russia in trying to impose its will; see: daily threats of nuclear use. Whether it’s ultimately vain or not, Russian authorities actively seek to deescalate through escalation. To support the idea that Russia has a lower threshold: it is believed Russian/Soviet doctrine is liberal on use of tactical nuclear weapons while strategic nuclear weapons are on the board for any, to paraphrase Putin, threat to the Russian state or territories (this is already fluid as parts of Ukraine already meet this threshold, in Russia’s eyes).</p>

<p>Much more importantly, and practically, you should be very alarmed at how fast WW3 war games and major exercises devolve into the use of nuclear weapons. On both sides, NATO and Warsaw Pact, nuclear escalation and usage would quickly spiral out of control. Everyone knows Able Archer for nearly creating a nuclear misstep, fewer know a sobering result of the actual exercise: the Supreme Allied Commander Europe requested the use of nuclear weapons by the end of the first day/start of the second because they could not stop the Soviets from pouring through the Fulda Gap. </p>

<p>For the Warsaw side of the argument, look into the leaked Seven Days to the River Rhine exercise. It simulated a very similar situation with the Soviets war gaming which targets and countries to hit with nuclear weapons.</p>

      <label for="l5poc27" class="commentText"><p>In their mind, he is restoring justice. Societ Union (aka Russia in Russian mind) lost 27 million people in WW2, putting itself into huge demographic crisis, which on par with ideology and trying to catch up with the west in space has led to them (as they would say) loosing their big country they deserved and had right to. Yes, Soviet Union lost civilization war, but after ww2 with ost-block they became a true empire. They think that the west has violated this justice by taking away these countries of their “sphere of interest”. So, the big majority absolutely agrees with him that there is no price they are not willing to pay in this holy war. As for most soldiers themselves, they come from such shitholes, you can only try to imagine: no inside toilets, no gas, often no electricity, no jobs, no future. Military career is the only way out, and indeed they poor incredible amount of money into their province with this war. So these people, who have never seen any money, got actually nice short term contracts , with rotations and nice salary, and nice amount given to their families if they die (there was a lot of jokes at the beginning of war, but now it changed a lot apparently). So, these people adore Putin, while Russians in richer Western part don’t want to fight themselves mostly, but love to either watch and support it on television or they don’t care about this at all, and war is far and is not their business, as rockets only fall on Ukriane. The few anti war liberals in Moscow and St. Petersburg , either hate war cause it’s bad for economy mostly, or are genuine humans, and they leave the country.</p>

      <label for="l5pppfs" class="commentText"><p>IMO all of this is because Putin weaponized leftover, Cold War hate of west. Generally hate/fear are eminent feelings, and will overweight brewing disaffection with life, wile rich getting more rich and poor getting screwed over and over.
Tho you can weaponize that hate only so much before you need to put money where your mouth is. And this is exactly that, Putin Putin’ money where his mouth should be,… but his army was in worst shape than he had been told, and now running out of war hardware, trained people and everything, he’s trying to double it down on his nuclear rhetoric, like a desperate gambler. While he is starving his country down. He is not trying to win but find out that will left him some dignity.</p>

      <label for="l5pqf26" class="commentText"><p>Zero is a special number.</p>

<p>If Nuclear weapons are involved, there is zero ceiling. no where to go, but vast destruction.</p>

<p>What should be employed as a &ldquo;warning shot&rdquo; is treaty fast track that Russia&rsquo;s currency value is zero. Save their place, but their currency is more worthless than whatever notes they try to print it on. A stipulation of that treaty is that all signatories treat all non signatories currency as value of zero. The economies who support the use of nuclear weapons on the field NEED to be frozen out of all other economies. Divide the world? YES. Nuclear weapons on the planet currently have enough fire power to engulf all urban regions on the planet in JUST THE FIREBALLS ALONE. Allowing or supporting the use of nuclear weapons is signing on to HUMAN DOOMSDAY.</p>

<p>As the signatories above a certain threshold are gathered, present publicly to the world the economies already willing to shut down all trade to countries not involved, issue an ultimatum to Russia: Overthrow Putin or face the NEXT escalation. Zero negotiations, zero maneuvers, zero time. INVOKE Civil War in Russia to save the world.</p>

<p>The next escalation is what Russia invited&hellip;doomsday. It could start with cute military operations, but if Russia sees America lurch, it&rsquo;s likely to launch it&rsquo;s biggest, stealthiest weapons at the Pentagon, DC, and the coasts. Plus perhaps revealing his hand for whatever Putin&rsquo;s been hinting at in terms of &ldquo;new physics&rdquo;. There may not be a world after this.</p>

<p>We need to get this zeroing of currency done, AND we need to replace all overseas dependancies with on shore dependancies ASAP. Because we can&rsquo;t rely on China and India joining the treaty, and we can&rsquo;t guarantee they won&rsquo;t help keep Putin in power. Spend on training, breeding (oh shut up, make families whole and spend on them at least to the level you spend on the military or we will lose, we are already well behind the curve in population density, and there WILL be losses), and building of manufacturing and infrastructure.</p>

<p>&hellip;The second Russia says &ldquo;fuck it&rdquo; and uses a nuke on the field, the Doomsday Clock will be frozen, a half second to midnight, while the world gasps waiting for the next shoe to drop. And that shoe better be Putin&rsquo;s head, or we&rsquo;re all doomed.</p>
