      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fiuj1t/were_currently_in_lebrons_longest_finals_drought/"><p>We&rsquo;re currently in LeBron&rsquo;s longest Finals drought of his career.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>LeBron debuted in the 2003-2004 season and he led the Cavs to the Finals in his 4th season. He would make the Finals again in his 8th season and played until June every year until 2018 (his 15th season) with both the Heat and Cavs. He went to the Finals in his 17th season with the Lakers.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Before late April 2024 when the Lakers got bounced out of the playoffs, LeBron&rsquo;s longest Finals drought was only 3 seasons! It also marked the first time in a decade in which he didn&rsquo;t make the Finals for at least half of his career. (10 Finals appearances in now 21 seasons)</p>

<p>Especially since he’d be joining a good team no matter where he went (given the discussed strength of the west).</p>

<p>Which team would he have joined and how dominant would they have been as a unit in his prime. He would’ve elevated one of them. It’s not a foregone conclusion that he wouldn’t have found massive success out west earlier in his career.</p>

<p>Edit: see my clarification below - it’s not drop one of his East teams in the west. It’s what if he joined a real team that existed in the west.</p>

<p>Most success period is because things went your way. The facts are that Lebron was the best player in the league and played on the best teams in his conference therefore he deserves praise for that. 8 straight finals doesn&rsquo;t happen if Lebron isn&rsquo;t on his A game and consistent for the decade, why not give him credit for that? You act like that&rsquo;s an easy feat to accomplish.</p>

I just don’t see the point in constantly mentioning hypotheticals to discredit Lebron.</p>

<p>If you guys are gonna mention hypotheticals then hypothetically do you think Kevin Durant or Stephen curry are going to 8 straight finals in the east?</p>

<p>Warriors already went to 6 themselves, Spurs in his prime went to 5. Add LeBron, it could’ve happened.</p>

      <label for="lnkful5" class="commentText"><p>You should be certain. He lost to the western conference finals winner almost every year… and sometimes, teams lower in the west matched up better vs him. </p>

<p>Lebron made the finals 9 times, and lost 6 to the west - despite having a far easier road to the finals. </p>

<p>Lebron’s Lakers have been consistently better than his 2018 Cavs, 2007 Cavs,  and arguably 2015 as well - he’s just not in the east. The Heatles probably make it out of the west 2011-2013. His other teams? Don’t think so. Don’t think he even makes it out in 2016, since draymond was only suspended due to it being the finals </p>

<p>It isn’t drop the Heatles in west. It’s take prime LeBron and add him to one of those real teams, some of which already made the finals 4-5 times <em>without</em> him.</p>

<p>Add him to one of the:</p>

<p>-Curry/Thompson/Green/(KD) Warriors</p>

<p>-KD/Westbrook/Harden Thunder</p>

<p>-Duncan/Parker/Manu Spurs</p>

<p>-Harden/CP3 Rockets</p>

<p>There’s no scenario where he gets on a big Finals run?  I’m not saying it’s guaranteed, but I can imagine it’s in the realm of possibility.</p>

The argument of Draymond in 2016&hellip;the guy got himself suspended, nobody made him attack people. 2015 if Kyrie and Love hadn&rsquo;t gone down the. You could say the cavs would&rsquo;ve won then. Gsw would&rsquo;ve beat the Raptors if it weren&rsquo;t for injuries, etc. </p>

<p>Finals wins rely on being healthy and available. You can&rsquo;t cite the Draymond suspension to discredit what the cavs did because you&rsquo;re discrediting the finals winner almost every year</p>

<p>LeBron 100% does not make anywhere near the amount of finals as he does if he was in the west</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s no disrespect I still think he would of course have made some but anyone who&rsquo;s trying to even dream that he replicates anywhere near what he did east in the west is a straight glazer</p>

      <label for="lnkpnn2" class="commentText"><p>With a bunch of them he likely wins a title year one and has a good chance to repeat his first two years in the league.</p>

<p>Basically any of the decent teams would have resulted in an automatic dynasty, him landing with some talented big like KG, Webber, Duncan, Shaq, Dirk, Gasol, Yao etc as well as some supporting cast would have been mental.</p>

<p>Even some of the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; teams in the West were way better than the Cavs team he landed on.  That suns team with a bunch of young guys including Marion, Stoudemire, Marbury, Joe Johnson and LeBron would have been a frickin dynasty if they could have kept it together.</p>

<p>Or the suns with a lineup of Miller, LeBron, Melo, Nene and Camby with Birdman off the bench.  Not as dominant as some of the other possible options but a million times better than the Cavs shit show he dragged to the finals.</p>

      <label for="lnku5h3" class="commentText"><p>Not out of the realm of possibility at all, it&rsquo;s plausible that he could have more than that if he landed on the right team.  I just think it&rsquo;s spaced out somewhat differently.  Probably gets to the finals earlier and more often early in his career, just has a couple gaps here and there rather than like a billion straight.</p>

<p>The spurs were like 40-1 at home. They didn’t even finish with the best record.</p>

<p>James harden would have been multiple finals appearances had they were in the East</p>

<p>Shit even years when you need like .53 to make playoffs while the East is like .48 to make playoffs. Its disgusting</p>

<p>During this time period I can’t even remember one historic eastern team</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve massively struggled to even make playoffs pretty much every year which has added a ton more miles to him</p>

<p>In East I think he&rsquo;d have coasted to top 6 seeds and saved his legs way more.</p>

<p>They just learned to use a draft pick on one, and they have another from actually using a draft pick on Reaves. That’s two! Huge improvement from them.</p>

<p>Trust me, I am baffled by the Lakers approach and didn’t mean to suggest at all that their roster construction has been improved. They finally seem to be working on it a few years too late.</p>

<p>Edit: Seriously though, how scary would LeBrons and AD have been surrounded by shooters for the kick out.</p>

      <label for="lnkv4m4" class="commentText"><p>Yeah but there was a guarantee that trading for Westbrook was incredibly stupid. Everyone could see it and I really don&rsquo;t know what the Lakers were doing. Even without hindsight AD/LeBron are not real shooters LeBron is ball dominant and Westbrook doesn&rsquo;t really do anything if he doesn&rsquo;t dominate the ball and pass to shooters. To top it all off Bron is better than Westbrook at basically everything. What did they think they were gonna do bench Russ and he&rsquo;d be cool? Turn one of the two into a stand in the corner and shoot guy? Lmfao its crazy. Specifically Bron and Westbrook have no business on the court together</p>

<p>Its rare that an NBA front office does something this mind boggling and you have to think that pressure was coming from somewhere weird because it made absolutely no sense on paper or in practice. I really have no idea what the plan was unless they low key were planning on trading LeBron then somehow it all fell apart but they already had Westbrook</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The plan was to have Westbrook lead the floor when Lebron was resting. Limiting Lebron to 30 mpg in the regular season would have done wonders for his ability to deliver in bursts during the regular season and keep him in better shape for the playoffs.</p>

<p>The twist was Anthony &ldquo;Street Clothes&rdquo; Davis never being healthy. With AD out, Lebron had to play. That means the ball would be in Lebron&rsquo;s hands, and Westbrook would have to play a different role where he wasn&rsquo;t a great fit. That wasn&rsquo;t a Westbrook problem, it was a team composition problem.</p>

<p>In order to get paid the most possible, LBJ has to stay with the Lakers. However his common routine of showing up to a team, then taking over GM duties and destroying it beyond comprehension has raised it&rsquo;s ugly head yet again.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t find LBJ&rsquo;s streak of Finals to be all that impressive. He played in the Eastern Conference, which was historically weak, plus David Stern and Nike had the refs massage the games as much as possible to ensure LBJ made the Finals for ratings/marketing/ROI</p>

<p>- LeBron having 10 Finals appearances to MJ&rsquo;s 6 is largely due to the 2010s East being much weaker than the late 80s/early 90s East</p>

<p>- LeBron having a 4-6 Finals record to MJ&rsquo;s 6-0 is largely due to the 1990s West being much weaker than the 2010s West</p>

<p>If you swapped them they&rsquo;d both get very similar results to what the other did and anyone who unironically thinks that MJ is a tier above LeBron or that LeBron is a tier above MJ is just being a fanboy</p>

      <label for="lnjxbtp" class="commentText"><p>West front offices have just been so much better than East front offices for some reason</p>

<p>If you look at the best players of the 2010s not named LeBron they basically ALL started off and were developed in the West:</p>

<p>- Curry(Warriors)</p>

<p>- KD(Sonics)</p>

<p>- Harden(Thunder)</p>

<p>- Kawhi(Spurs)</p>

<p>- CP3(NO Hornets)</p>

<p>- Westbrook(Thunder)</p>

<p>- AD(Pelicans)</p>

<p>LeBron&rsquo;s own front office in Cleveland further supports the &ldquo;East FO sucks&rdquo; theory lol</p>

<p>Would be one thing if the Eastern teams had good players and just didn&rsquo;t make the most of them but the West somehow managed to draft 80% of the best players</p>

      <label for="lnk2jay" class="commentText"><p>Yes, the west has been the tougher conference of course. However, since the year 2000, the west has been represented by 6 teams, while the east has been represented by 10 teams in the finals. The west has won 16 times while the east has won 9 times.14 of those wins have come from 3 teams respectively (LAL,SAS,GSW). And that’s without contributing WCF appearances. While the competition is harder, how competitive has the west really been for the rest of the wc teams?</p>
