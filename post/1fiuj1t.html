      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fiuj1t/were_currently_in_lebrons_longest_finals_drought/"><p>We&rsquo;re currently in LeBron&rsquo;s longest Finals drought of his career.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>LeBron debuted in the 2003-2004 season and he led the Cavs to the Finals in his 4th season. He would make the Finals again in his 8th season and played until June every year until 2018 (his 15th season) with both the Heat and Cavs. He went to the Finals in his 17th season with the Lakers.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Before late April 2024 when the Lakers got bounced out of the playoffs, LeBron&rsquo;s longest Finals drought was only 3 seasons! It also marked the first time in a decade in which he didn&rsquo;t make the Finals for at least half of his career. (10 Finals appearances in now 21 seasons)</p>

<p>Especially since he‚Äôd be joining a good team no matter where he went (given the discussed strength of the west).</p>

<p>Which team would he have joined and how dominant would they have been as a unit in his prime. He would‚Äôve elevated one of them. It‚Äôs not a foregone conclusion that he wouldn‚Äôt have found massive success out west earlier in his career.</p>

<p>Edit: see my clarification below - it‚Äôs not drop one of his East teams in the west. It‚Äôs what if he joined a real team that existed in the west.</p>

      <label for="lnlg6zs" class="commentText"><p>Bruh, he wouldn&rsquo;t. The Warriors went to 5 straight Finals and it took them having a 73-9 team and adding the 2nd best player in the league into their squad.</p>

<p>The fact that he went 3-5 in the Finals in that stretch is enough evidence alone that he wouldn&rsquo;t have made it 8 straight in the West, even with superteams. He had prime Wade and Bosh and lost to the Mavs in 2011, he also had prime Kyrie and Love and lost to the Warriors twice. Unless he somehow had managed to make a significantly better superteam out West, which is something we have no reason to believe in, there&rsquo;s zero percent chance he would&rsquo;ve made 8 straight Finals.</p>

<p>Not sure why you‚Äôre so certain that it‚Äôs otherwise impossible. He easily could‚Äôve elevated that franchise in 2021. The only uncertain year is 2020. But LeBron was pretty damn amazing that year, if anyone could‚Äôve done it, it would be the literal guy that powered to a championship.</p>

      <label for="lnllwf7" class="commentText"><p>Huh? What type of crazy ass logic is that? The Warriors went to 5 straight, broke down completely due to injuries, then went back after 2 years, you are also acting like 2 extra Finals in the West is just a light breeze. Even IF they had LeBron, they wouldn&rsquo;t have made the Finals in 2020 with Steph and Klay hurt. They likely wouldn&rsquo;t have made the Finals in 2019 either, as LeBron himself got hurt that year and they wouldn&rsquo;t have KD in this batshit crazy scenario.</p>

<p>There is no realistic scenario in which LeBron could&rsquo;ve made eight straight Finals in the West. Even if he could&rsquo;ve predicted the future and made the best possible choice back in 2010, which was join OKC, they wouldn&rsquo;t have made eight straight because Russ got hurt in 2013 and KD got hurt in 2015 plus they would&rsquo;ve lost Harden AND Ibaka because of the salary cap.</p>

<p>LeBron in the west would imply he was on a team in the west. So, yes. The warriors are a reasonable example in this fictional imaginary scenario. KD picked them, LeBron could‚Äôve too.</p>

      <label for="lnlrxvp" class="commentText"><p>Well lets talk within the realm of possibilities and redone Lebron career in the West, it&rsquo;s a fun exercise.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs imagine an alternate reality where LeBron James was drafted by a Western Conference team. To match the success of franchises like the Warriors or Spurs, LeBron would have needed to join a team in full rebuild mode. Not likely the Spurs, since they were always competitive and not in position for a #1 pick. But if the Warriors had somehow landed that top pick in 2003 and drafted LeBron, they would‚Äôve struggled for years before drafting Steph, Klay, and Draymond in <sup>2009</sup>&frasl;<sub>2011</sub>.</p>

<p>The thing is, LeBron has never been known for patiently waiting through a rebuild. He‚Äôs always been about finding the best situation, often joining more competitive teams with better assets. But teams that trade away key assets for stars usually don‚Äôt have a long championship window. So, in the West, LeBron probably would‚Äôve jumped from team to team, just like he did in the East, chasing rings.</p>

<p>I think eventually he would have landed on a good team‚Äîlet‚Äôs say OKC in 2012. Pairing him with KD and Westbrook would‚Äôve created a superteam. However, with LeBron‚Äôs contract, OKC would‚Äôve been capped, forcing them to lose key players and depth. Still, they probably would‚Äôve won 2-3 championships.</p>

<p>If LeBron had spent his whole career in the West, I think he would‚Äôve made the Finals about 5 times, with two different teams and timelines, and won around 3 rings. His Finals record would be better, but he‚Äôd have fewer rings overall.</p>

<p>Plus, his career might‚Äôve been shorter since playing in the West would require him to work harder in the regular season just to make the playoffs. He wouldn‚Äôt have been able to coast on defense like he did in the East, which helped him extend his career, so no longetivity.</p>

<p>In the end, it‚Äôs all hypothetical bullshit, but the weaker Eastern Conference was perfect for LeBron‚Äôs career. Staying there allowed him to make all those Finals runs and stretch out his prime, he should have stayed there.</p>

<p>Most success period is because things went your way. The facts are that Lebron was the best player in the league and played on the best teams in his conference therefore he deserves praise for that. 8 straight finals doesn&rsquo;t happen if Lebron isn&rsquo;t on his A game and consistent for the decade, why not give him credit for that? You act like that&rsquo;s an easy feat to accomplish.</p>

<p>Assuming health? Yeah, it&rsquo;s much more believable than LeBron making it 8 straight in the West.</p>

<p>It has nothing to do with LeBron himself, the East was that bad in the 2010s. From 2011-2018, LeBron faced ONE All-NBA First Team player on his way to the Finals and his teams often had an All-NBA player alongside him.</p>

<p>Basically any of the decent teams would have resulted in an automatic dynasty, him landing with some talented big like KG, Webber, Duncan, Shaq, Dirk, Gasol, Yao etc as well as some supporting cast would have been mental.</p>

<p>Even some of the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; teams in the West were way better than the Cavs team he landed on.  That suns team with a bunch of young guys including Marion, Stoudemire, Marbury, Joe Johnson and LeBron would have been a frickin dynasty if they could have kept it together.</p>

<p>Or the suns with a lineup of Miller, LeBron, Melo, Nene and Camby with Birdman off the bench.  Not as dominant as some of the other possible options but a million times better than the Cavs shit show he dragged to the finals.</p>

The only difference that it would&rsquo;ve made if he was out West is that the Western Conference would&rsquo;ve gone 8-0 in those eight years.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s wild how yall take anything as a slight on LeBron, it has nothing to do with him, the East was just fucking terrible and he took advantage of it. Him and Wade could&rsquo;ve joined the 50 wins Blazers together in 2010 and they still wouldn&rsquo;t have made it four straight from 2010-2014, already ending the streak there.</p>

      <label for="lnkv4m4" class="commentText"><p>Yeah but there was a guarantee that trading for Westbrook was incredibly stupid. Everyone could see it and I really don&rsquo;t know what the Lakers were doing. Even without hindsight AD/LeBron are not real shooters LeBron is ball dominant and Westbrook doesn&rsquo;t really do anything if he doesn&rsquo;t dominate the ball and pass to shooters. To top it all off Bron is better than Westbrook at basically everything. What did they think they were gonna do bench Russ and he&rsquo;d be cool? Turn one of the two into a stand in the corner and shoot guy? Lmfao its crazy. Specifically Bron and Westbrook have no business on the court together</p>

<p>Its rare that an NBA front office does something this mind boggling and you have to think that pressure was coming from somewhere weird because it made absolutely no sense on paper or in practice. I really have no idea what the plan was unless they low key were planning on trading LeBron then somehow it all fell apart but they already had Westbrook</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The plan was to have Westbrook lead the floor when Lebron was resting. Limiting Lebron to 30 mpg in the regular season would have done wonders for his ability to deliver in bursts during the regular season and keep him in better shape for the playoffs.</p>

<p>The twist was Anthony &ldquo;Street Clothes&rdquo; Davis never being healthy. With AD out, Lebron had to play. That means the ball would be in Lebron&rsquo;s hands, and Westbrook would have to play a different role where he wasn&rsquo;t a great fit. That wasn&rsquo;t a Westbrook problem, it was a team composition problem.</p>

You don&rsquo;t pay an 18mpg guy the max unless you gave out a bad contract that you can&rsquo;t get out of and they were never supposed to be coming off the bench to begin with</p>

<p>The ball was in Westbrook&rsquo;s hand as the primary playmaker all through the Christmas day game; LeBron willingly took an off ball role just to play to Westbrook&rsquo;s &ldquo;strengths&rdquo; but it turns out he was hot garbage once his athleticism began to wane. It was only with the turn of the New Year that we took the ball out of his hands and put it back in LeBron&rsquo;s hands that we started playing a little better.</p>

      <label for="lnm8qqc" class="commentText"><p>Meh. If you look more closely at that offseason the bigger issues were that they cheaped out after signing Westbrook giving up Caruso and not resigning Dennis with his Bird rights leaving them with no depth or tradeable assets. The Westbrook trade would not have been so damaging if they evaluated it for what it was, the ability to get a decent player but at a premium cost, not a true max superstar.</p>

<p>Even if they hadn&rsquo;t acquired Westbrook the plan was to trade Kuzma for Hielf and Alex Len. I doubt they are significantly better tjan where they ended up in 2023 with that deal, especially if you factor in all the injuries that Bron and AD have had.</p>

      <label for="lnm0ywb" class="commentText"><p>I feel like this is some revisionist history. ¬†They had just made a first round exit when they traded for Westbrook. ¬†They were old as shit, and were already going to lose one of their key young players (Schroeder). ¬†You could say &ldquo;if they stayed healthy they could win it all&rdquo;, but that&rsquo;s basically saying &ldquo;theyll be successful if their biggest weakness doesnt come back to bite them&rdquo; which is something you could say about 8 different teams each year. ¬†</p>

<p>In hindsight it seems like a dumb move, but I could easily see people saying &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe they ran it back after a first round exit&rdquo; if they had done nothing. ¬†</p>

      <label for="lnm3pc9" class="commentText"><p>Yeah a lot of people were sick of the inconsistency from the role players after that Suns series. Kuz especially was very disappointing and people were ready to move on. I personally just wanted to keep KCP, but I think the bigger issue was the short offseason after the bubble. That meant we never really got to see that 2021 team at full strength.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve massively struggled to even make playoffs pretty much every year which has added a ton more miles to him</p>

<p>In East I think he&rsquo;d have coasted to top 6 seeds and saved his legs way more.</p>

<p>They just learned to use a draft pick on one, and they have another from actually using a draft pick on Reaves. That‚Äôs two! Huge improvement from them.</p>

<p>Trust me, I am baffled by the Lakers approach and didn‚Äôt mean to suggest at all that their roster construction has been improved. They finally seem to be working on it a few years too late.</p>

<p>Edit: Seriously though, how scary would LeBrons and AD have been surrounded by shooters for the kick out.</p>

Like he would have had to still face those exact teams before making the Finals, and it was shown repeatedly that LeBron running a train on the East doesn‚Äôt apply to the best teams in the West.</p>

<p>LeBron is unbelievably great, but I think the Finals Appearance datapoint is a fraudulent one because how far you go in a single elimination tournament doesn‚Äôt mean anything - it just means you dodged the better teams until later. Were the 2018 Cavs better than the 2018 Rockets just because they played the Warriors a week later?</p>

Luckily the east has gotten more competitive. But west is still good. LeBron doesn&rsquo;t play winning basketball any more also in his secondary role as GM has traded all assets so they can&rsquo;t improve.

The spurs, thunder, warriors, rockets, and even the Mavs grizzlies and blazers were all fighting for their lives while the fucking hawks got 60 wins in the East</p>

      <label for="lnkl0xp" class="commentText"><p>This is the net impact of the Over 38 Rule.</p>

<p>In order to get paid the most possible, LBJ has to stay with the Lakers. However his common routine of showing up to a team, then taking over GM duties and destroying it beyond comprehension has raised it&rsquo;s ugly head yet again.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t find LBJ&rsquo;s streak of Finals to be all that impressive. He played in the Eastern Conference, which was historically weak, plus David Stern and Nike had the refs massage the games as much as possible to ensure LBJ made the Finals for ratings/marketing/ROI</p>

      <label for="lnjxxj0" class="commentText"><p>Two things that shouldn&rsquo;t be controversial in the GOAT debate IMO:</p>

<p>- LeBron having 10 Finals appearances to MJ&rsquo;s 6 is largely due to the 2010s East being much weaker than the late 80s/early 90s East</p>

<p>- LeBron having a 4-6 Finals record to MJ&rsquo;s 6-0 is largely due to the 1990s West being much weaker than the 2010s West</p>

<p>If you swapped them they&rsquo;d both get very similar results to what the other did and anyone who unironically thinks that MJ is a tier above LeBron or that LeBron is a tier above MJ is just being a fanboy</p>

      <label for="lnjxbtp" class="commentText"><p>West front offices have just been so much better than East front offices for some reason</p>

<p>If you look at the best players of the 2010s not named LeBron they basically ALL started off and were developed in the West:</p>

<p>- Curry(Warriors)</p>

<p>- KD(Sonics)</p>

<p>- Harden(Thunder)</p>

<p>- Kawhi(Spurs)</p>

<p>- CP3(NO Hornets)</p>

<p>- Westbrook(Thunder)</p>

<p>- AD(Pelicans)</p>

<p>LeBron&rsquo;s own front office in Cleveland further supports the &ldquo;East FO sucks&rdquo; theory lol</p>

<p>Would be one thing if the Eastern teams had good players and just didn&rsquo;t make the most of them but the West somehow managed to draft 80% of the best players</p>

The west has won 16 times while the east has won 9 times.14 of those wins have come from 3 teams respectively (LAL,SAS,GSW). And that‚Äôs without contributing WCF appearances.
