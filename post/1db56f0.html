</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Before the league would potentially patch this strategy like with Shaq dominating the paint.</p>

<p>What if a plan for NBA games (mostly within the postseason/Playoffs and the Finals) would be to ideally use a bench/expendable player to whisper some trash talk to a MVP player on the opposing team hoping to break their composure, having them initiate the punch first and have them be ejected if not, suspended for multiple games even. The trash talking can take place during a other player’s free throws as you’d be postioned either boxing out for the rebound or just standing by half-court next to the targeted player. Or whenever the opportunity is open.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the trash talk would have to resort to very foul language that’d be directed to their family members, etc (like the time with that Pacers fan to LeBron’s son.) And prior to the trash talk plan, you would have to tell your teammates about it too; to not interfere nor defend you from the most likely beating/shoving you’ll be receiving from the player you’re trying to eject. Otherwise your teammates will get ejected too. Also obviously you would have to be manipulatively composed via not fighting back, playing victim and making it seem like you said/did nothing even though you truly did provoke and created the agitation.</p>

<p>The hope is that they swing on you before snitching to a referee as these days in this modern era, there are many surveillance on the court via multiple angles plus a slo-mo replay system. So if you perhaps used your jersey to cover your mouth as if just wiping off sweat but really spitting some offensive derogatory, that could help your case. And if courtside fans were to also snitch on you as you’re playing a road game, then you can try to testify that the fans are just being biased because of their home court, etc. Worth a shot.</p>

<p>As how the league may patch this exploit is by having all players be mic’ed up oppose to just several; that wired thingy inside the jerseys. Ideally, they might resort to just fining players as you can make the case that it’s “just words” possibly and that trash talking has been part of sports and competition (despite this method is arguably different from standard trash talking).</p>

<p>This strategy of course would be rendered useless against very stoic and composed players that are locked in (like a John Stockton), but if you were to hypothetically agitate a player like Draymond Green for example, then you would succeed in mitigating their team a starter/vital player. Afterwards you’d then guard their other vital starter and try it once more, getting them either a foul, tech, flagrant, ejection, suspension. All to acquire and advantage/edge through a dirty and unethical method.</p>
