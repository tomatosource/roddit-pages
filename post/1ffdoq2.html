    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>If you said yes, congratulations, You just traded Bill Russell.</p>

<p>In the 1956 draft, the St. Louis Hawks traded the 2nd overall pick (Russell) to the Celtics for Cliff Hagan and Ed Macauley. They would join Bob Pettit and go on to win the 1958 NBA Championship and went to the finals in 1957, 1960, and 1961. Both Hagan and Macauley were inducted into the HOF.</p>

<p>That has to be the best outcome in NBA history for a trade that was clearly lost.</p>

<p>No one knew Bill Russell will become Bill Russell.</p>

<p>You can ask the same Currently.</p>

<p><strong>If you know if you trade 2025 #2 pick for HOF level players, you would go to finals <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>. And will win it all once. Will you do it?</strong></p>

<p>2025 #2 pick will probably be one of (Traore, Harper, Bailey, Hugo,). (Since Flagg will 90% be #1 pick)</p>

<p>Who knows, maybe that #2 pick will become a Future Top 10 player all time.</p>

      <label for="lmu6ld2" class="commentText"><p>Has nothing to do with hindsight. St Louis (along with most of America) in the 50’s was racist as fuck and didn’t want a black man on their team. They gifted him to Boston out of their own hate and the Celtics taught everyone 2 important lessons throughout the 60’s</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Don’t just give away good players for free</p></li>

<li><p>Racism is stupid and bad</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Probably why that story about the person who shit in Russell’s bed is such an important story, those morons did such an ironic thing out of hate when they got the greatest basketball gift of that generation because of that same bigotry causing stupid and ignorant decisions. At least Red Auerbach had some sense and decency.</p>

<p>The racist people in Boston didn’t deserve the championships he won them, and Russell is a hero for everything he did on and off the court.</p>

      <label for="lmv4hsn" class="commentText"><p>Which is exactly why Bill loved the Celtics, not necessarily the city of Boston. Which was my point how they didn’t deserve the championships. Those banners are hung for Bill, Red, and the Celtics. Not the city of Boston or its fans.</p>

<p>It’s an important distinction and why it’s sometimes frustrating to discuss when being a fan of the franchise, because you get lumped in with “Boston is racist though” because the city has a terrible history, while the franchise is one of the most progressive, as you pointed out.</p>

<p>I’m a fan of the Celtics, they just happen to be from Boston. But I do understand the overlap of a city being a part of the identity with a sports team, so it’s certainly a complicated subject to discuss.</p>

<p>Only Kareem can hold a candle to him in that regard.</p>

<p>The relative gap between him and wilt is pretty insane. The absolute gap is probably equivalent to Lebron or MJ at their best compared to like 4th best player on the league (if we say Steph and KD are Lebrons 2nd and third, and Hakeem and the Admiral are MJs). Ofc their overall impact is higher. Like MJ or Lebron were probably +10-11 players at their best. Bill was probably a +8 type of guy. It&rsquo;s just value was much harder to get on offence in those days and even wilt more than half of his impact came on defence. Really only West and Big O were actually offneisve superstars. Probably the only 2 before Kareem.</p>

      <label for="lmv9imd" class="commentText"><p>He certainly has that reputation. He&rsquo;s very much a player in the Carmelo Anthony, Adrian Dantley school of players imo. He&rsquo;s a better rebounder, and his assist numbers weren&rsquo;t quite so comically low. But based on his scoring volume the amount of playmaking he was doing was pathetic and the lakers offence performed better without him. He puts up big numbers but the offence he generates isn&rsquo;t actually that efficient because he&rsquo;s taking up so much oxygen he&rsquo;s making it hard for others to thrive.</p>

<p>Typically offensive superstars through the history of the league have been at least +4 ish on offence. Now obviously because of the era it was so much harder to be that. But only West and Big O were hitting those numbers in impact estimates on offence before Kareem.</p>

      <label for="lmut69m" class="commentText"><p>I think most franchises would do it for one ring.</p>

<p>A guaranteed ring in this day and age where even a successful draft pick is usually waiting around for his team to rebuild and sign overpriced free agents for a chance to compete is a no brainer.</p>

<p>If you include the fact the #2 pick doesn’t have the best track record (probably have to go back to Durant 16 years ago for an impact player on a championship team), it’s an easy trade to make.</p>

<p>Raptors are a good example of this too. They were competitive for a long time up until the Kawhi year, and they haven’t been competitive since.

<p>I like watching basketball. I like watching my team win. When I get to spend 50+ nights are year watching my team win I have a good time, even if it ends with us getting our backs blown out by the Heat or whatever. Obviously winning a whole Finals series is a lot better than watching us beat the Hornets on November 23rd or whatever but it’s still really nice to win a lot more than you lose and spend most of the season with the hope you can compete for a title even if it usually ends in a letdown, rather than never having hope in the first place and watching your team suck ass most of the time.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how un-guaranteed a ring is - even the franchise GOAT, and arguable league GOAT, couldn&rsquo;t do it until the team won the lottery 2 additional times. And even then, it took a miraculous comeback to barely win 1 time.</p>

<p>CLE would&rsquo;ve been better off trading LeBron in exchange for a guaranteed title. And that&rsquo;s freakin LeBron!</p>

If you guarantee me a championship, I’m doing it. The only exception is trading away a franchise legend, but I’m sentimental like that.

      <label for="lmv5iva" class="commentText"><p>The trade is totally understandable. A trade benefits a team more but it doesn&rsquo;t mean the other team loses. It&rsquo;s no comparison but I think of the Wiggins-Love trade. Cavs traded away an unproven rookie with very high ceiling for an established all star with lower ceiling. If Wiggins turned into an MVP in Wolves it&rsquo;d look like Cavs lost the trade, but the trade need to be done as the title contending window might not come again in decades.</p>
