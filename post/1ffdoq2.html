      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ffdoq2/if_you_had_the_2nd_overall_pick_in_the_draft_and/"><p>If you had the 2nd overall pick in the draft and knew if you traded it, you would win a championship, go to 4 out of the next 5 finals, and the two players you traded for would both make the HOF (one of them being a home town hero), would you make that trade?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>If you said yes, congratulations, You just traded Bill Russell.</p>

<p>In the 1956 draft, the St. Louis Hawks traded the 2nd overall pick (Russell) to the Celtics for Cliff Hagan and Ed Macauley. They would join Bob Pettit and go on to win the 1958 NBA Championship and went to the finals in 1957, 1960, and 1961. Both Hagan and Macauley were inducted into the HOF.</p>

<p>That has to be the best outcome in NBA history for a trade that was clearly lost.</p>

<p>No one knew Bill Russell will become Bill Russell.</p>

<p>You can ask the same Currently.</p>

<p><strong>If you know if you trade 2025 #2 pick for HOF level players, you would go to finals <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>. And will win it all once. Will you do it?</strong></p>

<p>2025 #2 pick will probably be one of (Traore, Harper, Bailey, Hugo,). (Since Flagg will 90% be #1 pick)</p>

<p>Who knows, maybe that #2 pick will become a Future Top 10 player all time.</p>

      <label for="lmu6ld2" class="commentText"><p>Has nothing to do with hindsight. St Louis (along with most of America) in the 50’s was racist as fuck and didn’t want a black man on their team. They gifted him to Boston out of their own hate and the Celtics taught everyone 2 important lessons throughout the 60’s</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Don’t just give away good players for free</p></li>

<li><p>Racism is stupid and bad</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Probably why that story about the person who shit in Russell’s bed is such an important story, those morons did such an ironic thing out of hate when they got the greatest basketball gift of that generation because of that same bigotry causing stupid and ignorant decisions. At least Red Auerbach had some sense and decency.</p>

<p>The racist people in Boston didn’t deserve the championships he won them, and Russell is a hero for everything he did on and off the court.</p>

<p>Only Kareem can hold a candle to him in that regard.</p>

<p>The relative gap between him and wilt is pretty insane. The absolute gap is probably equivalent to Lebron or MJ at their best compared to like 4th best player on the league (if we say Steph and KD are Lebrons 2nd and third, and Hakeem and the Admiral are MJs). Ofc their overall impact is higher. Like MJ or Lebron were probably +10-11 players at their best. Bill was probably a +8 type of guy. It&rsquo;s just value was much harder to get on offence in those days and even wilt more than half of his impact came on defence. Really only West and Big O were actually offneisve superstars. Probably the only 2 before Kareem.</p>

<p>A guaranteed ring in this day and age where even a successful draft pick is usually waiting around for his team to rebuild and sign overpriced free agents for a chance to compete is a no brainer.</p>

<p>If you include the fact the #2 pick doesn’t have the best track record (probably have to go back to Durant 16 years ago for an impact player on a championship team), it’s an easy trade to make.</p>

      <label for="lmus7bf" class="commentText"><p>Yes, absolutely. A lot of people/teams are way too concerned about perfection at the expense of good, solid success. If you guarantee me a championship, I’m doing it. The only exception is trading away a franchise legend, but I’m sentimental like that. I’m not trading Kobe/Dirk/Duncan/etc. Any young player/draft pick for a guaranteed title is worth it.</p>

      <label for="lmuwz1r" class="commentText"><p>Yes absolutely. Did you consider the teams that have the 2nd pick most years?  They’re not close to the finals.</p>

<p>Think about it in terms of Chet Holmgren.  He’s awesome.  He’s so fucking good.  I don’t think he’s better than <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> next finals.</p>

<p>Bill Russell isn’t most seasons.  Sometimes it’s fucking Hasheem Thabeet.  Sometimes it’s MARVIN BAGLEY</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also get mad that my second pick was the third pick.</p>
