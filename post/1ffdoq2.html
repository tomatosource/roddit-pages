      <p>If you said yes, congratulations, You just traded Bill Russell.</p>

<p>In the 1956 draft, the St. Louis Hawks traded the 2nd overall pick (Russell) to the Celtics for Cliff Hagan and Ed Macauley. They would join Bob Pettit and go on to win the 1958 NBA Championship and went to the finals in 1957, 1960, and 1961. Both Hagan and Macauley were inducted into the HOF.</p>

<p>That has to be the best outcome in NBA history for a trade that was clearly lost.</p>

<p>No one knew Bill Russell will become Bill Russell.</p>

<p>You can ask the same Currently.</p>

<p><strong>If you know if you trade 2025 #2 pick for HOF level players, you would go to finals <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>. And will win it all once. Will you do it?</strong></p>

<p>2025 #2 pick will probably be one of (Traore, Harper, Bailey, Hugo,). (Since Flagg will 90% be #1 pick)</p>

<p>Who knows, maybe that #2 pick will become a Future Top 10 player all time.</p>

      <label for="lmu6ld2" class="commentText"><p>Has nothing to do with hindsight. St Louis (along with most of America) in the 50’s was racist as fuck and didn’t want a black man on their team. They gifted him to Boston out of their own hate and the Celtics taught everyone 2 important lessons throughout the 60’s</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Don’t just give away good players for free</p></li>

<li><p>Racism is stupid and bad</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Probably why that story about the person who shit in Russell’s bed is such an important story, those morons did such an ironic thing out of hate when they got the greatest basketball gift of that generation because of that same bigotry causing stupid and ignorant decisions. At least Red Auerbach had some sense and decency.</p>

<p>The racist people in Boston didn’t deserve the championships he won them, and Russell is a hero for everything he did on and off the court.</p>

      <label for="lmv4hsn" class="commentText"><p>Which is exactly why Bill loved the Celtics, not necessarily the city of Boston. Which was my point how they didn’t deserve the championships. Those banners are hung for Bill, Red, and the Celtics. Not the city of Boston or its fans.</p>

<p>It’s an important distinction and why it’s sometimes frustrating to discuss when being a fan of the franchise, because you get lumped in with “Boston is racist though” because the city has a terrible history, while the franchise is one of the most progressive, as you pointed out.</p>

<p>I’m a fan of the Celtics, they just happen to be from Boston. But I do understand the overlap of a city being a part of the identity with a sports team, so it’s certainly a complicated subject to discuss.</p>

<p>Cunningham&rsquo;s performance convinced Alabama boosters to allow the team to integrate. Bryant had recruited black players before, but the boosters had threatened to defund the team if those black recruits were allowed to play</p>

<p>Only Kareem can hold a candle to him in that regard.</p>

<p>The relative gap between him and wilt is pretty insane. The absolute gap is probably equivalent to Lebron or MJ at their best compared to like 4th best player on the league (if we say Steph and KD are Lebrons 2nd and third, and Hakeem and the Admiral are MJs). Ofc their overall impact is higher. Like MJ or Lebron were probably +10-11 players at their best. Bill was probably a +8 type of guy. It&rsquo;s just value was much harder to get on offence in those days and even wilt more than half of his impact came on defence. Really only West and Big O were actually offneisve superstars. Probably the only 2 before Kareem.</p>

      <label for="lmv9imd" class="commentText"><p>He certainly has that reputation. He&rsquo;s very much a player in the Carmelo Anthony, Adrian Dantley school of players imo. He&rsquo;s a better rebounder, and his assist numbers weren&rsquo;t quite so comically low. But based on his scoring volume the amount of playmaking he was doing was pathetic and the lakers offence performed better without him. He puts up big numbers but the offence he generates isn&rsquo;t actually that efficient because he&rsquo;s taking up so much oxygen he&rsquo;s making it hard for others to thrive.</p>

<p>Typically offensive superstars through the history of the league have been at least +4 ish on offence. Now obviously because of the era it was so much harder to be that. But only West and Big O were hitting those numbers in impact estimates on offence before Kareem.</p>

      <label for="lmwaemg" class="commentText"><p>St Louis picked Willie Naulls in the same draft.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Naulls" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Naulls</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Naulls was selected by the St. Louis Hawks in the second round of the 1956 NBA draft with the ninth overall pick. He called it a &ldquo;culture shock&rdquo; to see the segregation that existed in St. Louis, the likes of which he had not seen since he was eight before moving to Southern California. He spent just 19 games with the Hawks before being traded to the New York Knicks, with whom he would spend most of his career.</p>

<p>A guaranteed ring in this day and age where even a successful draft pick is usually waiting around for his team to rebuild and sign overpriced free agents for a chance to compete is a no brainer.</p>

<p>If you include the fact the #2 pick doesn’t have the best track record (probably have to go back to Durant 16 years ago for an impact player on a championship team), it’s an easy trade to make.</p>

      <label for="lmyiy75" class="commentText"><p>Boston, Denver, and even Milwaukee/Dallas/San Antonio all have won fairly recently so they probably won’t mind a rebuild.</p>

<p>But would the wolves trade Ant for one guaranteed ring? They were close last year but still didn’t get to the finals and gobert and Conley are just getting older right?</p>

<p>Would Sacramento trade any one of their young stars? Probably.</p>

<p>OKC and Shai? Orlando and wagner/Paolo? New York and Brunson?</p>

<p>I think all these teams that haven’t won that has a young star would definitely trade them for a guaranteed ring. We’re so caught up with dynasties in the past (Celtics, lakers, bulls, lakers, spurs, lakers, heat, warriors) that a lot of people can’t see those days might be behind us. With the contracts and player movement being the way it is and the increase in player primes (both peak and longevity) as well as the decrease in immediate impact rookies and propensity for load management/shut down/group rebuild, the league is wide open as ever and at the same time, championship windows are smaller than ever.</p>

<p>Even with the Celtics, remember there was a lot of chatter about trading Jaylen brown because he couldn’t dribble left or possibly Tatum having reached his peak because he couldn’t win it all. The nuggets were supposed to be a dynasty because they had a superstar surrounded by young key pieces that were for the most part locked in with contracts, but they couldn’t get to the wcf.</p>

<p>If your goal is to make money and have exciting young players put up a feel good story and do the whole homegrown talent/college team vibes, you wouldn’t trade a 2pick or young star for a guaranteed ring, because you might be the next dynasty. But to win three or even go b2b, you need so many things going right that you may end up like the process and never get closer than a “deep” playoff run.</p>

<p>You can ask the same Currently.</p>

<p>If you know if you trade 2025 #2 pick for HOF level players, you would go to finals <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>. And will win it all once. Will you do it?</p>

<p>2025 #2 pick will probably be one of (Traore, Harper, Bailey, Hugo,). (Since Flagg will 90% be #1 pick)</p>

<p>Who knows, maybe that #2 pick will become a Future Top 10 player all time.</p>

<p>All the debate about whether or not you should mortgage your future is a luxury only teams like the Warriors can have. The rest of us are dying out here just trying to win a single chip.</p>

<p>And even with the Warriors, y’all are still talking about extending the dynasty as long as possible and getting Steph a chance at 1 more ring.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how un-guaranteed a ring is - even the franchise GOAT, and arguable league GOAT, couldn&rsquo;t do it until the team won the lottery 2 additional times. And even then, it took a miraculous comeback to barely win 1 time.</p>

<p>CLE would&rsquo;ve been better off trading LeBron in exchange for a guaranteed title. And that&rsquo;s freakin LeBron!</p>

      <label for="lmvth8r" class="commentText"><p>I think there’s a small wrinkle here because mystery box isn’t a championship, it’s a top 25 all time player who builds a decade long dynasty with your franchise. If you’re LA or Boston you already have the championships, you take the mystery box. The rest of the league should take the guaranteed ring though.</p>

      <label for="lmw7571" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s a risk too. For every Russel there are a couple of Shaqs and that&rsquo;s a factor in the risk, but for teams that already have two full hands worth of rings imo its worth rolling the dice on getting <em>that guy</em>. Everyone else should take the guaranteed chip.</p>

      <label for="lmvw2hk" class="commentText"><p>I think the hypothetical is more interesting if you know you&rsquo;re getting a ring with the trade AND you know the other team is getting 11 rings. If I know that part, that potential dynasty is really hard to turn down especially if I know part of it came directly at my own team&rsquo;s expense.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s where a kind of taboo subject comes in IMO: Championships are forever and people can never take it away from you, but they&rsquo;re not obligated to remember you. What percentage of NBA fans know the Hawks won the 1958 championship, or that the Hawks even played in St. Louis at all? Definitely some, <em>maybe</em> a majority, but definitely not even close to all of them. Some rings do get forgotten by many, but no one is ever forgetting Russell and the dynasty. If I know that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s capable of, I&rsquo;m taking my chances.</p>

<p>Would you trade a ring, and 5 NBA finals appearances for Luka? He&rsquo;s about best case scenario for &ldquo;Draft pick that instantly blows the doors off the league&rdquo; in the modern era.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s been a legitimate top 5 MVP candidate since his 2nd season.</p>

<p>There are plenty of owners that don&rsquo;t care about championships, they don&rsquo;t want to go into the tax, they don&rsquo;t want to tank for a prolonged time to build a core of good young players and assets.</p>

<p>They would happily take Wemby in this scenario because he is going to sell a shit ton of tickets and merch for at least his young athletic portion of his career. He&rsquo;s going to get you to the playoffs, there&rsquo;s going to be fans that hang onto their fandom just for that.</p>

<p>You can put a mid tier star next to them, pay them both a shit ton to lock them up, and boom, your job and PR is reasonably safe for years.</p>

      <label for="lmuo7gz" class="commentText"><p>He most certainly would still have many rings. After that trade, the Hawks won a chip, went to four finals in 5 years, and went to the semifinals 10 times in Russell’s 13 years. Add him on top of that and the story of his career is exactly the same.</p>

<p>Red Auerbach, the legendary head coach / GM of the Celtics, was the reason why the Celtics were the only team willing to play 5 black players on the court at the same time, while every other franchise insisted on always having a white player on the court at all times. This was another little discussed element of the Celtics&rsquo; runaway success in the 1960s.</p>

      <label for="lmywens" class="commentText"><p>What you said about St Louis is very true, but the Hawks actually drafted a black player (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Naulls" target="_blank">Willie Nauls</a>) with the ninth overall pick in the exact same draft (‘56) that they traded Russell to the Celtics. From Wikipedia, Nauls “called it a “culture shock” to see the segregation that existed in St. Louis, the likes of which he had not seen since he was eight before moving to Southern California.”</p>

<p>The Celtics FO was definitely very progressive for the times. As far as I know, the Hawks FO were not, but it is not true that they were not willing to draft a black player (Nauls was also not the first black player to play for the Hawks).</p>

<p>However, Nauls only played 19 games with the Hawks before being traded, making 4 all star teams with the Knicks and then winning three rings with the Celtics.</p>

      <label for="lmvuprv" class="commentText"><p>This doesn’t change your main point of your post, but you probably should be more clear that Ed Macauley was at the very end of his career and only played 3 seasons with the Hawks before retiring. He wasn’t even there for some of those Finals appearances, so he had no impact for part of your post. He was already a guaranteed HOF by the time he arrived with the Hawks. </p>

<p>You are making it seem like the Hawks got a HOF career out of him when they didn’t. A few years ago, the Heat got in a sign and trade a potential future HOF in Kyle Lowry, but it wasn’t like they got a HOF caliber player, which is similar to Macauley’s situation here. </p>

<p>The trade was essentially Russell for Hagan and an aging Macauley.</p>

      <label for="lmvx7bb" class="commentText"><p>Yea I’m with you. Just saying the phrasing might make it seem like Macauley contributed a bit more than he actually did. The key is he was already a HOF before the trade. Hagan was the big one because the Hawks actually got a HOF career out of him. Hagan honestly should have gotten consideration do the all time lists. Probably as good as some of the Celtics but just without the rings. </p>

<p>I would say Macauley’s contribution is like Al Horford’s contribution to the Celtics the last few years. Still important, great leader and veteran, and potentially a future HOF but not as important as their stars and not playing at a HOF level anymore. </p>

<p>However, it was an 8-team league, and St. Louis already had a 23-year old MVP in Bob Pettit.</p>

<p>I think you could argue that only 1 Championship with a 23-year old MVP in an 8-team league could be bit of a disappointment.</p>

      <label for="lmv5iva" class="commentText"><p>The trade is totally understandable. A trade benefits a team more but it doesn&rsquo;t mean the other team loses. It&rsquo;s no comparison but I think of the Wiggins-Love trade. Cavs traded away an unproven rookie with very high ceiling for an established all star with lower ceiling. If Wiggins turned into an MVP in Wolves it&rsquo;d look like Cavs lost the trade, but the trade need to be done as the title contending window might not come again in decades.</p>

      <label for="lmxxuru" class="commentText"><p>In a 30-team league, I absolutely do that trade.</p>

<p>In an 8-team league, one championship every 8 years should be a team&rsquo;s average.</p>

<p>Also, making a Finals isn&rsquo;t nearly the same accomplishment.</p>

<p>For example, in the 1956-57 season, those Hawks made the Finals, but their regular season record was 34-38.  Six of the league&rsquo;s 8 teams made the playoffs, and St. Louis actually won the Western Division (after winning some tiebreaker matches).  That propelled them straight to the Western Division Finals.  In the playoffs, all it took for them to reach the NBA Finals was winning a single 5-game series against another sub .500 team.</p>

<p>All that to say, the outcome of the trade can&rsquo;t be looked at through the lens of today.  Yes, St. Louis got a single title and some Finals appearances, but Bob Pettit was, by far, the main reason for that.  Macauley was already well on the decline (he only played 2 more full seasons and was not as good as earlier in his caeer), and Hagan was solid, but never a top player in the league.  He made two 2nd-Team All-NBAs, but was never 1st-Team, even in an 8-team league.</p>

<p>I think you have to expect Pettit (who was a 23-year old MVP in 55-56, the year before the trade) to get at least 1 title in an 8-team league, so I really don&rsquo;t think you can call this a &ldquo;success&rdquo; at all.</p>

      <label for="lmvzelu" class="commentText"><p>Fun fact but probably should also point out there were only 11 or so NBA teams back then so that wouldn&rsquo;t work out quite the same nowadays and you would always take the Championship.  Its so hard to win a championship now even having the best player like Jokic or Giannis who haven&rsquo;t won more then 1 yet.</p>

<p>Ideal scenario probably would be lose 2 finals in a row, win the next finals, and next lose the 1 finals after. This would show the front office we are still contenders but would need to re-tool the roster</p>

      <label for="lmxaipv" class="commentText"><p>Knowing what they knew, its still a good trade. Its just risk management and the celtics hit the jackpot</p>

<p>Tho this hit weird since im from stlouis. Do the hawks go to atl if the hawks win those bill russel championships? If so, Id never be a celtics fan since stl would have a team. And then maybe the hawks become the staple the celtics are today. And holy fuck, I can only imagine the culture around town if home grown legend Jayson Tatum was playing for the stl hawks. And saying that, id definitely make the trade.</p>

<p>Plus in hindsight, the stl team beat the fucking goliaths that were that celtics team. They were the only team to beat Russel in the finals or he&rsquo;d have been 12-0 instead of 11-1 (tho the injury to russel sucks).</p>
