</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Basically, the title</p>

<p>Some people said it is usually the prime years of an nba player, especially for a star or superstar.</p>

<p>But why those ages? What are the things included in that age range?</p>

<p>Is it just the intersection between your peak athleticism and more matured mental state?</p>

<p>Even if Steph, KD, Lebron are still all star level players with their 35+ ages.</p>

<p>They were still a lot better when they were in that 26-33 yrs old age range interval.</p>

<p>That is also why we are expecting players like Wemby, Paolo, Ant, etc (who are already good players) to have a superstar leap more.</p>

<p>So, what are the things included in that age range? Is it limited to baskeball only? Or other sports have that too?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes this is the main reason.</p>

<p>Also yes, in most sports you peak at your mid 20s to early 30s.  The exception is sports that require extreme athleticism (such as gymnastics) or a lighter body (such as diving) in which case it&rsquo;s common to peak in your teens.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough in games like chess or go, players peak at the same age range as physical sports although they decline much slower.  This shows that humans not only decline physically but mentally too, once they get close to 40.</p>

Sure, your chances to live to the old age are much bigger right now, but plenty of people did this in Medieval times too. It&rsquo;s really skewed in our perception since the average life span was around 20-30 years old, but most people misunderstand this statistic. It&rsquo;s not because majority couldn&rsquo;t live past 35 years, but because child mortality was waaaay bigger, which drastically reduced average life span. Of course, when it comes to 50 years and older, our medicine is very important</p>

<p>Think about it. Your work in the office, school, a video game, a sport, anything - having more experience in a task makes you better at that task.</p>

<p>Players peak athletically closer to 22-24 than 30, realistically, but having FARRRR more experience in ages 27-30 is really fucking important</p>

<p>And you never lose that experience. So longevity (being elite after 32ish)  has to do with either slowing that athletic decline (LeBron a poster boy of this) and/or adapting your game to fit your athletic decline (Second threepeat Jordan becoming the greatest midrange shooter ever).</p>

However, you now have around 5-7 seasons of NBA experience, hopefully including a taste of the playoffs. In additional to mental maturity, your actual basketball skills have also expanded and/or have been polished. Your cerebral reading of the game at the NBA level should also be vastly improved.</p>

<p>For players that truly master their mental/physical basketball skills, they can still be extremely effective well into their mid and late 30s despite athletic decline.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying super stars become Michael Jordan when they reach their late 20s, but it takes time to reach a point where training and skills are an afterthought, and when players reach that point, that is when they are ready to compete at the level for championships.</p>

      <label for="lo0bvrr" class="commentText"><p>Because that’s the age that coincides with the 10,000 hours rule as well as how long it takes to achieve that physical peak(3-4 years of hard weight lifting with your fully grown body). After that the wear and tear starts to subtract from the physical side of things more and more each year while your mental side of things is slowly reaching absolute peak. Sometimes you can make up for the athletic shortcomings with elite mental game and elite fundamentals, especially if you were a supreme athlete and even after a significant drop off are still way above average. The thing is though, those are the outliers. Typically the best years by all ways of measuring are that 27-32 range.</p>

<p>Give or take 1-2 years on either end depending on the person and their genetics / lifestyle</p>

<p>In my personal opinion I think it&rsquo;s because that&rsquo;s the time in your life when your physical ability is still high but mentally you&rsquo;re more mature and experienced in whatever sport you&rsquo;re doing.</p>

<p>Even men who aren&rsquo;t athletes tend to hit their prime around this time as well. this age range is when men will typically start to fill out their frames more, be much more mature mentally and start to have disposable income to dress better / take better care of themselves.</p>

<p>Curry is a very clear example of a young man&rsquo;s frame filing out as he hits his prime. Almost every year since his first mvp he seemed to be a bit more muscular and fuller. It was very noticeable since he has such a lean build.</p>
