      <label for="ll6h5vd" class="commentText"><p>I agree Fournier doesn&rsquo;t have the level for NBA anymore. But &ldquo;nobody picked him for a reason&rdquo; , no it doesn&rsquo;t prove anything.
NBA franchises are making a lot of stupid decisions. A lot of great players can&rsquo;t find a franchise, and a lot of trash players stay in the leagues for years. When it comes to bench level players, a lot of them can easily be replaced by players who left the league or never played in the NBA.</p>

      <label for="ll6i30o" class="commentText"><p>I think the difference between the end-of-bench guys you have on a team and the ones who are available (like Fournier) is very small when you consider on-court output. So then decisions start to account for potential (Fouriner is unlikely to noticeably improve) and attitude. It&rsquo;s easy for fans to see the on-court impact, harder to see the potential and especially attitude portions. I think when you consider all factors, teams make pretty good decisions overall because they have such huge financial incentive to do so.</p>

      <label for="ll6mjpg" class="commentText"><p>I agree there&rsquo;s a lot of other factors.
And that&rsquo;s why a guy like Boban is still in the league.</p>

<p>But take Yabusele. He waited years before getting a new NBA contract. But he got the same level in Madrid the last 2 seasons. Why now and not before? Why not before the olympics or last season? 2 possibilities:</p>

<p>1- Yabusele already had NBA level for the last 2 seasons, and franchises are not scooting correctly veteran players playing in the euroleague. They need a poster dunk on Lebron to finally remember Yabusele exists.</p>

<p>2- Yabusele still doesn&rsquo;t have NBA level and Philadelphia just gave him a contract he doesn&rsquo;t deserve, just because of the sudden hype.</p>

<p>In both cases, it means franchises are not always picking the best players.</p>

      <label for="ll6zwpq" class="commentText"><p>I think a big part is that it takes players a while to adjust and it&rsquo;s a bit of a gamble which players can adjust from euro style to be productive in NBA vs not. A lot of times you spend the first half year or year of someone hopping over from Euroleague with them just trying to figure out pace and differences in how rules are called. For fringe players most franchises don&rsquo;t want to spend that time/resources on a player that 1) probably isn&rsquo;t going to get better and 2) might take a while to figure things out.</p>

<p>Philly is in a situation where they have to get creative with their front court depth due to lack of resources outside of minimum contracts and are in a win now mode. They can gamble on Yabusele becoming a productive player because it&rsquo;s a minimum contract with some upside and little downside outside of a roster spot. Yabusele is the one taking a bigger gamble here going back on just a vet min.</p>

<p>A lot of top Euroleague players aren&rsquo;t willing to hop over on make-good contracts or deal with going to a foreign culture or instability in the NBA.</p>

After a couple years he really found his footing and became a great cog.</p>

His one-on-one defense was fine when he was in his physical prime, but I have never watched a player in the NBA as clueless as he is regarding team defense. It felt like he missed every rotation, bit on every pump fake, and failed to call out every screen he encountered.</p>

<p>So when he lost a step, it turned his very bad defense into being completely unplayable due to his defense. Combine that with his offense going from microwave to damp campfire and you get him being out of the NBA.</p>

That&rsquo;s why he shine in FIBA national team and not in NBA. Those saying he is a bad defender probably don&rsquo;t watch him playing. He was often chosed as the one to defend on the best player of the opposent during his time in celtics and magic. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, he isn&rsquo;t a good defender but he isn&rsquo;t bad neither.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s a good deal for him and the NBA. And thibodeau definitely ruined his career. Knicks is a team that kill French players</p>
