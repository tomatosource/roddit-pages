      <p>What talented players do you think passed up shots because of their unselfishness? I&rsquo;m not thinking players without confidence like Ben Simmons who was too passive to be a big success. I remember Derrick Mckey from Seattle and Indiana who just didn&rsquo;t take enough shots to really make an impact. Rik Smits I remember was a similar player who could dominate but sometimes just passed up a shot for a pass to a teammate.</p>

Before Curry, teams simply didn&rsquo;t do that, but now almost every coach and system sees that it&rsquo;s just nonsensical mathematically to not let good 3pt shooters shoot every time they&rsquo;re open. Nash&rsquo;s career 3pt% is almost identical to Steph&rsquo;s.</p>

* <sup>13</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub> - 47.2% on 5.9 per 36<br>
* <sup>14</sup>&frasl;<sub>15</sub> - 49.2% on 6.7 per 36<br>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t really get it right until he had declined significantly late in his career.  I&rsquo;d argue he could have pushed it a little further than that too.</p>

      <label for="loqe80r" class="commentText"><p>The crazy thing too is that teams often had three point specialists who weren&rsquo;t especially good defenders, so limiting their attempts wasn&rsquo;t a very good decision if you were going to leave them in the game for long or combine them with other mediocre defenders.  In the recent down years of the Spurs I remember line ups where Marco Belinelli, Patty Mills, and Bryn Forbes were on the court at the same time, in a season where the Spurs were last in 3pt attempts per game in the league. It made no sense.</p>

<p>If Korver starts trying to take 8-10 a game in the first half of his career he gets benched immediately and shut down. It was basically unheard of. (Ray got to 8 3PA twice in his career).</p>

      <label for="loqpauh" class="commentText"><p>Well sort of.  They may not have pressured him into shooting more (like for instance how teams of late have generally tried to do with a player like Luke Kennard) but I doubt most coaches would have scolded him for letting go of a few hot ones if they&rsquo;ve seen him make that particular type of shot with any kind of regularity.  Especially if overall he&rsquo;s still the best statistical shooter on the team.</p>

<p>As I type this however, I am starting to recall how little regard some coaches even as late as the early 2010s had for math, and some weird almost superstitious fear of higher variance shots.</p>

      <label for="loqd05i" class="commentText"><p>It really is incredible in retrospect how long it took coaches to catch on to the fact that it just made sense mathematically to let their best shooters take threes&hellip;  There&rsquo;s a great interview with Steve Kerr in The Last Dance documentary where he says that threes just weren&rsquo;t considered good shots in the 90s, even by hall of fame level coaches like Phil Jackson. Hell, even in the last 7 or 8 years, Popovich and the Spurs have often been reluctant to shoot more threes. Literally 30+ seasons passed before a team realized that high volume three point shooting from good shooters was a smart strategy that could win championships. Before then, it was very common for analysts to say &ldquo;jump shooting teams don&rsquo;t win championships.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="loqkbt4" class="commentText"><p>Teams in the &lsquo;80s and &lsquo;90s definitely could&rsquo;ve given themselves an edge by shooting more threes, but I think the big thing was the rule changes in the early 2000s. Once hand-checking was gone and formerly illegal defense was allowed, shooting a ton of 3s simultaneously became easier to pull off (since it&rsquo;s tougher to bump someone off their spot on the perimeter without fouling) and more important (since being allowed to soft double, play zone, or collapse multiple guys to the rim <em>really</em> punishes teams who don&rsquo;t space the floor).</p>

<p>The NBA&rsquo;s offensive explosion over the last few years absolutely could&rsquo;ve happened in 2004 with the right team, it just took a while for the league to figure out that you could win that way (and for player development/emphasis on shooting 3s to catch up— a lot harder to build a 4-out or 5-out team when there were relatively few stretch-fours and basically zero stretch-fives).</p>

<p>There were nights where he&rsquo;d be an unstoppable 25 points and others where he seemed determined not to shoot at all. Those other nights drove me NUTS. I remember Paul Silas blasting him for it at least once too.</p>

<p>Batum also did it in his last year here as well, but that was him actively not wanting to play basketball here.</p>

      <label for="loq99z8" class="commentText"><p>Kevin Garnett with the Celtics</p>

<p>He was on a career decline but still had some 20 PPG seasons and playoffs in front of him. But when you have legendary scorers like Paul Pierce and Ray Allen, you kinda feel inclined to swing the rock. Still, I think if KG would’ve been as active as a scorer as his Minnesota days, Boston could’ve won two championships instead of one</p>

<p>their problem was that they couldn’t stop anybody defensively. their defense was ass.</p>
