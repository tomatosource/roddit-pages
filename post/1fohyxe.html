    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>What talented players do you think passed up shots because of their unselfishness? I&rsquo;m not thinking players without confidence like Ben Simmons who was too passive to be a big success. I remember Derrick Mckey from Seattle and Indiana who just didn&rsquo;t take enough shots to really make an impact. Rik Smits I remember was a similar player who could dominate but sometimes just passed up a shot for a pass to a teammate.</p>

      <label for="loq3s7k" class="commentText"><p>Well it was, but it&rsquo;s also true that his shot distribution (paint vs mid range vs 3pt) was pretty conventional at the time.  I suppose you could say he should have shot more shots overall though.  But I mean he was a wildly effective offensive player in his prime.</p>

<p>* 09/10  - 53.6% on 4.2 attempts per 36<br>
* <sup>13</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub> - 47.2% on 5.9 per 36<br>

* <sup>19</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> - 41.8% on 8.9 per 36</p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t really get it right until he had declined significantly late in his career.  I&rsquo;d argue he could have pushed it a little further than that too.</p>

      <label for="loqd05i" class="commentText"><p>It really is incredible in retrospect how long it took coaches to catch on to the fact that it just made sense mathematically to let their best shooters take threes&hellip;  There&rsquo;s a great interview with Steve Kerr in The Last Dance documentary where he says that threes just weren&rsquo;t considered good shots in the 90s, even by hall of fame level coaches like Phil Jackson. Hell, even in the last 7 or 8 years, Popovich and the Spurs have often been reluctant to shoot more threes. Literally 30+ seasons passed before a team realized that high volume three point shooting from good shooters was a smart strategy that could win championships. Before then, it was a very common for analysts to say &ldquo;jump shooting teams don&rsquo;t win championships.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Steve Nash, maybe? He could have certainly put up more FGA. In fact I think he’s even said so himself. Though it’s hard to call that a detriment.</p>

      <label for="loqberc" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve thought for years now that if Nash were around now he&rsquo;d easily double his 3pt attempts. Before Curry, teams simply didn&rsquo;t do that, but now almost every coach and system sees that it&rsquo;s just nonsensical mathematically to not let good 3pt shooters shoot every time they&rsquo;re open. Nash&rsquo;s career 3pt% is almost identical to Steph&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>He was on a career decline but still had some 20 PPG seasons and playoffs in front of him. But when you have legendary scorers like Paul Pierce and Ray Allen, you kinda feel inclined to swing the rock. Still, I think if KG would’ve been as active as a scorer as his Minnesota days, Boston could’ve won two championships instead of one</p>

<p>There were nights where he&rsquo;d be an unstoppable 25 points and others where he seemed determined not to shoot at all. Those other nights drove me NUTS. I remember Paul Silas blasting him for it at least once too.</p>

<p>Batum also did it in his last year here as well, but that was him actively not wanting to play basketball here.</p>
