      <label for="l6y4v6t" class="commentText"><p>And the fact that Clark&rsquo;s been getting bullied by the pro&rsquo;s till give her a piece of humble pie is a good narrative.</p>

<p>I remember when Kevin Garnett was the first teenager in decades to make the leap straight from high school and, yeah, you&rsquo;re gonna get picked on by these players because of the hype placed on you. I remember when Cedric Ceballos fucking pimped Garnett&rsquo;s ass on an and-1 and clearly saying, &ldquo;this ain&rsquo;t high school, boy!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s part of the growing process. The sooner you can develop callouses on that shit, the better off you&rsquo;ll be so that you can shit on the next person in line. I&rsquo;m not surprised Clark is getting manhandled right off the bat. She came in with the most hype of any player in that league, and all the pros had been wanting to come for her since she exploded. They&rsquo;re testing her to she what she&rsquo;s really made of.</p>

<p>NBA discourse is shit but in a very different way</p>

<p>This WNBA discourse is more akin to a damn race war.</p>

<p>We’re not getting hate like Embiid hate for being a flopper, or Tatum hate for being a fraud. We’re getting discussions on whether Black lesbians are jealous of Clark, whether Clark is being anointed as a savior because she’s white and straight, discussions of societal racism against Black women, etc. Absolutely none of this has a thing to do with <strong>ball</strong>. It’s bad lmao.</p>

<p>And yes we’ve gotten hints of this in the past with like, Perk talking about race in last year’s MVP race, but this extends beyond the media and into the actual players which is what makes it far more significant</p>

<p>I agree with that statement.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s still different than Bird actively trying to diffuse the race narratives the media was pushing by doing a joint press conference with Isiah during the playoffs where he made it clear they were cool—even dapping up at the end</p>

<p>The only reason this isn&rsquo;t the case in the NBA is because Jokic and Luka are European. If Jokic was born in Indiana instead of Serbia the Jokic vs Embiid discourse would make the current variant look like a fucking joke</p>

      <label for="l6yc8zx" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not even prophetic, we knew this years ago. Bill is just not afraid to give honest takes because he&rsquo;s a psycho and listens to Meshuggah.</p>

<p>Women, especially competitive women, do not <em>fucking</em> like each other. Especially women competing for male competition, because men are the ones who watch sports and they&rsquo;re the ones who watch the WNBA. That point has kind of gotten lost here, if this was an office and two of the women in the office full of men were constantly shit talking each other and throwing shade no one would second guess it. That&rsquo;s entirely normal behavior. Now we have a sports league where all the players are women competing against each other for male ticket sales and attention. This has bred this really weird, resentful dynamic. And there has been talk about some really shitty things in the WNBA especially when it comes to on the court trash talk and some of the personalities in the league for years.</p>

      <label for="l6yeux4" class="commentText"><p>This is kinda tangential to his point, but one thing I&rsquo;ve felt for a while is that it feels like many women in male-dominated industries (athletics, in this case) seem to have even <em>more</em> toxic masculinity than the men. Like they have to overcompensate to survive kinda thing.</p>

<p>I just know that a lot of the women I&rsquo;ve encountered in women&rsquo;s athletics are just <em>way</em> more psycho competitive and driven (in a negative sense) than the men. It feels like the men can turn it off but the women have had to make it their whole identity. Especially the women for whom it&rsquo;s their career, like the coaches and athletic staff (I work in higher ed). It can get <em>really</em> toxic and it just kinda sucks.</p>

<p>Obviously that&rsquo;s not universal or necessarily even broadly true, it&rsquo;s just something I&rsquo;ve observed.</p>

The idiots would have called it woke and the other dumdum would have said they&rsquo;re forcing it down people&rsquo;s throat. ESPN is all about personality, because they&rsquo;re a drama channel moreso than sport, and none of the WNBA stars before were hitting millions view on social media the way CC is right now. Now that CC is here and drawing interest, ESPN and SAS are giving them their spotlight. The alternative is ESPN treating it like hockey and tbh, they could have.</p>

      <label for="l6y086x" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, the viewership plays a big role in deciding what gets talked about on shows. All of the talk on social media and news outlets about the foul on Clark this weekend is the only reason why Clark was the leading topic and a lot of these sports shows today, not because these talking heads suddenly got way more interested in the WNBA.</p>

<p>Admittedly SAS could&rsquo;ve tried talking about it more three years ago but it wouldn&rsquo;t have made much of a difference regarding the WNBA. It&rsquo;s really Clark and the attention she&rsquo;s been getting that&rsquo;s responsible for the sudden increase in viewership and attention for the WNBA.</p>

<p>I saw Fever v. Storm a few weeks ago and the biggest thing that stood out was difference in passing quality and finishing at the rim.</p>

      <label for="l6xx0iu" class="commentText"><p>The angle at which many of the players are shooting the ball from is inherently a lower % shot, the literal physical differences between many of the players in the WNBA and the difference beween the women&rsquo;s game and men&rsquo;s game is an interesting wrinkle to it all. It&rsquo;s certainly more  of a team game across the league, closer to college basketball than NBA basketball which is typically going to be more individually-dominated most of the time.</p>

<p>And yeah the depth of talent isn&rsquo;t that of the NBA but that&rsquo;s not super surprising really when you think about it, and the NBA is in the middle of an extended golden run of widespread and deep talent so it&rsquo;s gonna skew that comparison a bit as well.</p>

<p>If you want to watch the really good teams play in the WNBA, watch New York or Las Vegas. They&rsquo;re legitimately better to watch because they know what they&rsquo;re doing and have players that can consistently execute. Both teams are the WNBA equivalent of super teams, with Las Vegas having Kelsey Plum and A&rsquo;ja Wilson among others, and New York having Sabrina Ionescu, and Breanna Stewart among others. Phoenix and Connecticut are pretty good as well.</p>

<p>Rather than the BS that the WNBA apologists keep spewing that we should be happy to watch subpar athletic performances, they should just realize that sports are as much about narratives as they are play on the Court. The reason the WNBA is having a moment right now isn&rsquo;t because Caitlin Clark is single-handedly elevating the level of play in the WNBA. Its because of the narratives around her.</p>

<p>The WNBA executives and players need to watch some WWE. Learn how to build compelling narratives and rivalries that make people want to tune in. Stop gaslighting fans that the level of play in the WNBA is as good as the NBA. Everyone can easily see that its not.</p>

      <label for="l6y1bpp" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t really agree with this. There are several examples of women&rsquo;s sports being comparable from an entertainment aspect. Someone brought up tennis and gymnastics. I think these are great examples. Women tennis players can&rsquo;t necessarily compete directly against men, but it is still very entertaining and competitive. Another few I can think of are MMA and Judo. Weili Zhang is must-watch. And there are a lot of very cool judo fights between women. Granted, judo is not as popular in America, but it is one of the most popular sports worldwide. I think my overall point is that basketball just doesn&rsquo;t have the infrastructure built for them to succeed. You aren&rsquo;t going to attract talent with how much they&rsquo;re being paid right now.</p>

<p>He comes in with all of this hype and attention, then people following start wondering why the Spurs can&rsquo;t win games with him. One guy doesn&rsquo;t instantly turn around a bad team.</p>

<p>The truth is, the Spurs completely gutted their roster to go into rebuild mode and have a shot at that top 3 lottery pick and a 17% chance of Wemby.</p>

<p>They struck gold there, but it&rsquo;ll take a few years to rebuild the team, figure out which pieces fit, and use all the draft assets they acquired during the process. This isn&rsquo;t a miracle situation like 1997 when they had Tim Duncan joining a veteran-laden, playoff-ready team.</p>

<p>Fever were bad team before Clark, and they are still a bad team with her but that should change over time.</p>

      <label for="l6y0rks" class="commentText"><p>except that&rsquo;s not true. there has been slow but steady growth in women&rsquo;s sports in general <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/352067/the-wnbas-meteoric-rise-in-popularity-in-one-chart#:~:text=As%20Sportsnaut%20reports%2C%20WNBA%20ratings,in%20more%20than%20a%20decade." target="_blank">for years now.</a></p>

<p>WNBA ratings by year according to <a href="https://sportsnaut.com/wnba-tv-ratings/amp/" target="_blank">Sportsnaut</a></p>

<ul>
<li>2023: 505,000 avg. viewers (ESPN, ABC, ESPN2)</li>
<li>2022: 372,000 avg. viewers (ESPN, ABC, ESPN2)</li>
<li>2021: 306,000 avg. viewers (ESPN, ABC, CBS</li>
<li>2020: 205,000 avg. viewers  (ESPN, ABC, ESPN)</li>
</ul>

<p>There is undeniable growth because of the recent draft class which was good and of course because of caitlin clark&rsquo;s talent. But there was also a clear trend.</p>

<p>The NBA wasn&rsquo;t always as popular as it is now. It took special talents and good draft classes and investment by the media. Look how jealous the former player get at what the current players make now. The skill level in the NBA is so far ahead of what it used to be for the average player. I suspect the WNBA will continue to grow and the talent will grow as well. That takes investment from the media. For me, I cannot wait to watch Juju Watkins get into the league.</p>

Genuinely curious, was it operating at a loss for its&rsquo; entire existence until a watershed moment? The WNBA gets those ratings and is getting increasing exposure because of betting and the NBA footing the cost of everything.</p>

      <label for="l6y9c23" class="commentText"><p>So much of this growth has been pushed inorganically and it shows in the way you&rsquo;re describing it. &ldquo;It takes investment from the media.&rdquo; The media didn&rsquo;t start covering the NBA because it wanted the NBA to grow, they covered it when there was demand from fans. That&rsquo;s why we barely have any footage of early NBA stars. We&rsquo;re even missing many years of the finals because it wasn&rsquo;t important enough to show on TV. It&rsquo;s obvious to anyone who follows sports that ESPN specifically has been heavily pushing various women&rsquo;s sports and giving them far more coverage than more popular men&rsquo;s leagues like the NHL and MLS.</p>

      <label for="l6y3xcj" class="commentText"><p>Thank you for bringing out the data because people are being very obtuse about the WNBA product when it&rsquo;s a VERY young league. Case in point, I am literally older than the WNBA and haven&rsquo;t hit my thirties yet.</p>

<p>When the NBA first started out, it was facing the same exact struggles the WNBA is facing, something that took years and gaining generational talent to grow out of.</p>

<p>This is just the natural progression of growth rather than it being some gender war talking point.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m like the stereotypical audience for WNBA programming and live in a city with team that dominated the league for years, and only have ever gone to 2 games. Idk, it just isn&rsquo;t as fun or engaging as the NBA. I love that people are watching now but also don&rsquo;t really feel the need to be one of them&hellip;</p>

      <label for="l6y27cv" class="commentText"><p>That wasn&rsquo;t really the topic at hand, and he was making a point that was irrelevant to what was being argued.</p>

<p>SAS and Shannon were saying it was a problem that these women were hitting Clark with cheap shots and they thought it was out of jealousy for Clark.</p>

<p>Monica was saying that they&rsquo;re painting the women in the WNBA with a broad brush as most of them are probably fine with Clark and the extra benefits the players are getting partially due to increased viewership due to Clark. She also was saying that the player who had the cheapshot on Clark has a history of cheap shots so you can&rsquo;t definitively say it was from a place of jealousy of Clark, and also that the fact that it took 11 games where there to be an outcry over one cheap shot against Clark shows it&rsquo;s not as big an issue as being suggested.</p>

<p>One of her final points was also that the league is pretty physical and over the history of the game, there have been a lot of plays similar to this Clark play that have happened, but people who are new to the league don&rsquo;t know that and are using the one play to paint all WNBA players with a broad brush of being jealous of Caitlin Clark.</p>

<p>SAS and Shannon kept responding to Monica claims by talking about Clark being responsible for more attention and viewership for the WNBA, and Clark being the golden girl of her league, which is obviously true, but it didn&rsquo;t refute what Monica was saying about people using the one cheap shot to make it seem like Clark is constantly getting cheap shotted and the WNBA is mostly full of women jealous of Clark.</p>

      <label for="l6y6vi7" class="commentText"><p>I agree with 99% of that but it&rsquo;s obvious Chennedy Carter is jealous of Clark. She literally spent the day on social media shitting on her saying all she can do is shoot 3s. It&rsquo;s not like Clark has ever really talked shit to her or anybody for people to have such animosity towards her. I can also see why she&rsquo;s jealous. Chennedy Carter is actually a much better player than Caitlin Clark is right now- she has a better mid-range, she&rsquo;s faster, more athletic, and she&rsquo;s a vet, she just has the experience. But absolutely no one knows who she is. For someone like Carter who definitely has a Draymond crash out personality, it makes sense that she&rsquo;s jealous of Clark. It doesn&rsquo;t make it right though.</p>

      <label for="l6xvm73" class="commentText"><p>Exactly. God I’m so tired hearing the crocodile tears from the WNBA about being treated unfairly. They get <strong>better</strong> treatment than other leagues. Is SAS talking about professional water polo? How come First Take doesn’t lead with the Snooker championships? Ultimate Frisbee? Ping Pong?</p>

<p>People are acting like the WNBA <em>deserves</em> equal coverage and money just because they exist. When they wouldn’t even exist as a professional league if it weren’t for getting special treatment.</p>

<p>It’s not some gotcha moment that more people tune in when for the first time in WNBA history they have a player on the floor that actually makes the product somewhat watchable. And for me, it’s still not watchable even when she’s out there. Every time I’m in this dearth of sports and throw on the WNBA I’m reminded of how awful it is.</p>

Instead it&rsquo;s &ldquo;she&rsquo;s doing things that would even be impressive if she were a man&rdquo;.  If someone came into the WNBA that could jump like Ja Morant, people would be equally excited no matter the race.</p>

<p>Monica isn&rsquo;t getting on SAS for not covering the WNBA until this season. She is getting on him for claiming he is this big WNBA support when he isn&rsquo;t. She didn&rsquo;t just randomly go &ldquo;why aren&rsquo;t you watching until this season!&rdquo;.

<p>If you go down the WNBA drama rabbit hole on youtube get ready, its way crazier than Suns players banging Nash&rsquo;s wife. That league isn&rsquo;t ready for a super bright spotlight.</p>

      <label for="l6ybc85" class="commentText"><p>I don’t care for SAS at all but yesterday I was listening to ESPN radio and whoever was the host had Monica on to talk about the Caitlin Clark thing and it legit sounded like she was snacking on something mid call. Like she purposely was giving dense answers and chewing obnoxiously loud to make it a point that she’s “over this convo”. It was weird af and it felt like the host wanted to say something but they felt they couldn’t.</p>

      <label for="l6xnbk8" class="commentText"><p>No she didn’t. Nobody cared about the wnba three years ago. They aren’t going to cover something that the majority of viewers aren’t interested in.</p>

<p>They are covering it now because CC has brought interest to the game. She’s acting like the wnba should have been covered more even back when nobody have two shits about it which is a dumb argument.</p>

<p>It’s not “disrespectful to the woman who laid the groundwork for Caitlyn” that the wnba is finally getting more coverage. And I’m sorry but the woman who have been playing for the last five years or whatever haven’t laid the groundwork for anything.</p>

<p>Eventually, with all of the newfound interest people will start looking back to the history of the game and past wnba greats will get their flowers, but that’s never going to happen if the league and its players keeps getting in its own way.</p>

<p>Eventually, people are going to stop caring as much about CC if they are getting chastised for being a fan.</p>

<p>This is the last chance the wnba has to become something and they are going to blow it</p>

I have never heard a &ldquo;welcome to the league&rdquo; story about getting chokeslammed on a rebound or bulldozed when the ball isn&rsquo;t even in play. Even petty-ass Shaq didn&rsquo;t do that when Bynum dunked on him. This is just trifling behavior from the vets.</p>

      <label for="l6xte9f" class="commentText"><p>WNBA players don’t understand that sports is not welfare. A shit league that is still shit doesn’t deserve coverage or funding especially when they resist improvement.</p>

<p>And they’re angry the most popular player is white, lmao. She was super popular in college as well and then people trying to say she sucks, well she broke so many records in college she has the resume of any Pro All Star player. She’ll adjust and play through the brutal flagrant fouls that Candace Wiggins talked about for not fitting in and also due to jealousy.</p>

      <label for="l6y19yw" class="commentText"><p>I’ll be happy if the WNBA gets popular but people act like the media and fans should treat both leagues equally even though one is objectively more popular and makes more money than the other. It’s just such a weird way to look at it.</p>

<p>It’s the same as the people who insist on claiming that WNBA players are better than most men…they would lose to a good boys high school team. It doesn’t take away from their skill and determination but it’s just so weird to argue so hard for something that clearly isn’t true.</p>
