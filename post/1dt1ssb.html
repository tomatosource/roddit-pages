</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Particularly as Denver is a small market and not really an FA destination so they might never get another Jokic-level player for the next 50 years so this isn&rsquo;t even like the Lakers where they can expect to get Shaq or LeBron falling into their lap when they hit FA at some point</p>

<p>Insane not to prioritize the current window when it might be the best run you ever have in this case</p>

<p>Imagine if this was LeBron or Steph all ESPN would be doing all day long is running segments on how horrible this is by the FO and why they need to leave now</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a huge set of restrictions that prevents roster movement, so teams won&rsquo;t mess with it.</p>

      <label for="lb8caev" class="commentText"><p>4 tiers: non-tax teams (under the soft cap-141mil), luxury tax teams (teams between soft cap and 1st apron) 1st apron teams (teams that exceed the luxury bracket-178mil), 2nd apron teams (teams that exceed 188mil)</p>

<p>The numbers are for this coming year are not exact.</p>

<p>Each tier also has new roster penalties applied such as losing some or all of mid-tier player exceptions that luxury teams can currently use.</p>

<p>They also have trade penalties. 2nd apron teams will have to receive matching salary in a trade, so trades can’t be used by 2nd apron teams to dump bad contracts and do 1 year roster turnovers. It’s going to require a lot more cap management for competitive teams</p>

<p>I think it will also greatly increase the value of draft picks. 1st and 2nd apron teams will basically be reduced to the draft as their only way to fill their rosters out. Several GM’s have been collecting picks the last few years; I believe in anticipation for this change</p>

      <label for="lba0xti" class="commentText"><p>More than anything I think it’s going to make it basically impossible to keep a good team together for more than a couple seasons which kind of sucks for everyone. It’s also going to make teams move towards slowly and more organically growing good teams as opposed to spending big for stars. If you try to get like three max players they better all be top ten players because the rest of your team is gonna suck unless you killed it in the draft and have a bunch of great players on rookie deals.</p>

<p>It hurts teams like the lakers the most, who mostly rely on just signing a big name whenever they’re down.</p>

<p>But even if you build your team almost completely organically and get all your stars through the draft you’re still only gonna have like a three year window where you can keep them all.</p>

<p>Say what you will about cp3, but he actually killed it as president of the players union, cj McCollum has let the players get bent over.</p>

<p>Outside of potentially Boston, who got like the luckiest most lopsided trade ever, I doubt we see dynasties ever again. And while talent will be more spread out, the quality of teams that win the finals is probably going to go down compared to before this cba. Which sucks, I want to watch great teams play each other in the playoffs, not pretty good teams just so like the pistons/wizards/hornets can win a couple more regular season games a year.</p>

<p>I doubt we ever see a three peat again. It would take so many stars aligning. Like you would legit have to have an okc type situation where you draft kd, Westbrook, and harden, and also somehow know to keep harden as a sixth man until it’s time to pay him so you can get a massive discount while also having the foresight to trade Westbrook for winning players at the same time before everyone figures out what a negative he is in the playoffs.</p>

Would it have been amazing to win more championships with Giannis, of course, but they did win once and it was incredible.

<p>I still really like him and think he can improve, but we&rsquo;re definitely paying a bit too much for a glorified role player.  Tough to replace what he offers though.</p>

      <label for="lb80dsn" class="commentText"><p>I thought it was a huge overpay and one of the worst contracts in the NBA.</p>

<p>At the time he had missed like half of his eligible games due to injury, defensive liability, didn’t use his size for rebounding, no playmaking ability and not a threat to score at the rim.</p>

      <label for="lb6qc0v" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t get why MPJ gets so much hate. KCP, MPJ, and Jamal all dissappeared for long stretches of the wolves series. But somehow KCP and Jamal just get a pass and MPJ gets the blame? At least MPJ showed up for The Lakers series and played 81 regular season games for us. That is ALOT more than Jamal can hang his hat on last season.</p>

<p>For the record I love them both it just seems like the MPJ slander is getting out of hand.</p>

      <label for="lb853oj" class="commentText"><p>i think the majority of the commentary i see on it is about MPJ&rsquo;s contract, and his game&rsquo;s value relative to his contract. Which i feel like is appropriate, as opposed to just shitting on his game or stats or saying hes not good enough. And i agree his contract is definitely an obstacle to roster building.</p>

<p>I mostly commented bc i don&rsquo;t think i agree that MPJ slander is getting out of hand, but i definitely do think it&rsquo;s interesting how quiet the sub has been about Murray&rsquo;s performance. Some offensively cold games from a defensively minded role player i feel was maybe a little underdiscussed. But i feel like i haven&rsquo;t seen any threads or anything about how bad Murray was in the playoffs this year. I mean it was bad man. and tbf yeah he was injured, and i was in the game threads mad at other team fans shitting on him without mentioning that he was injured. but man it was still bad and i feel like there wasn&rsquo;t even like actual non-meme discussion about it here.</p>

      <label for="lb7wza8" class="commentText"><p>Yeah the Celtics are likely dependent on continuing to win. If they stop winning, they’ll likely move off one or both of the KP and Holiday deals and look to reset their cap penalties before attempting to retool.</p>

<p>The major difference is Denver just wasn’t as well positioned to try something like that after their championship. It wasn’t a question of extending someone like White or Holiday who are obviously no brainers on the deals they got and could probably be flipped for positive value, it was deciding if they’d overpay to keep Bruce Brown. With a weaker roster leading to a worse season, it then made it even harder to justify keeping KCP who while being a great role player also is not on the level of Holiday and White.</p>

<p>It also doesn’t help that MPJ has a max eating their space. I feel like they need him to turn into a legit 3rd option, but he’s still more a high end role player. It would be like if White never built up the confidence to raise his scoring volume, but was extended assuming that he might.</p>

You can see that in the Nuggets, Bucks, Lakers and Warriors, all these teams were built using the previous cba as their roster construction guide. Now the cap is different and the 2nd apron/other new cba construction/cap stuff would smash their skull if they continued on business as usual. It&rsquo;s going to be a bit awkward and painful because every new cba comes with growing pains and a need to build out the roster under a different set of rules/different cap.</p>

      <label for="lb7efsj" class="commentText"><p>The Nuggets have almost never paid the luxury tax, so I think it’s safe to say it’s a huge reason. The other reasons are the bad contracts for Zeke Nnaji and MPJ, but when you have Jokic you need to be able to figure out better ways to work around that. Hopefully they can snag someone on the cheap, otherwise this is a disaster of a couple off seasons that are weirdly being excused by Nuggets fans insisting that Kroenke isn’t cheap.</p>

To be clear I have 0 love of Kroenke (I live in Denver and cannot watch the team on cable because of him), but I&rsquo;m also not going to blame him for things I&rsquo;m not completely certain he&rsquo;s doing.</p>

<p>The second apron is a massive problem for teams that don&rsquo;t think they already have their roster locked in for the foreseeable future, and bringing KCP back was not going to put us there.</p>

How is this not a time to be going all in? If they believe in their young players, they should believe in them as role players.</p>

<p>That KCP contract is also ultimately tradeable if you ever really wanted to get under the tax. There is no excuse for it unless another good move is made.</p>

They don&rsquo;t believe in their own roster - they just saw it implode in the 2nd round, they don&rsquo;t see a way to fix it under the new CBA, and they see all these other teams getting better. They are not stupid, the writing is on the wall for everyone with eyes to see.</p>

<p>So they play a stalling game, hoping that in a year or two some of the young players make a serious leap, while simultaneously praying Jokic stays in shape and motivated enough to keep playing on a high level. For me its an utter negligence and a waste of Jokic&rsquo;s prime, but I get their point of view.</p>

<p>You are seeing jokic, Murray Gordon, kcp, and mpj as a contending team and thus keep the band together.</p>

<p>The GM sees hey our team got beat in the second round, if we bring back kcp we almost severely hamper our ability to add anyone else because of the 2nd apron. Other teams are loading up in the west and Denver can&rsquo;t because of the 2nd apron. That&rsquo;s the decision you have to make.</p>

<p>Match that with a team like Boston who has a championship core right now so they don&rsquo;t care about reaching the 2nd apron they can strike while the irons hot</p>

      <label for="lba0rih" class="commentText"><p>You are looking at it the wrong way. The point of view the GM is showing right now is preventing them from adding anyone else to the roster. They are telling everyone “we don’t care about adding more talent around Jokic, Murray and AG as long as this MPJ contract is on the books.”</p>

<p>Being under the second apron won’t change that. They are basically praying for huge internal improvements for possibly the best two years of Jokic’s career.</p>

<p>Anyone who looks at the Nuggets as a second round team is idiotic. They won the title just last season. They lose in game 7 to a team specifically designed to beat them, after having a 20 point lead. They are the only team in the NBA that didn’t lose a game to the current champs. You go all in just like the Celtics are when these opportunities come around.</p>

<p>And it’s not the GM’s decision anyways, it’s Kroenke’s, which is my whole point from the start.</p>

      <label for="lb7nfmy" class="commentText"><p>Nah I think some of yall are letting the owners off way too easier because of this second apron thing. If you think about what the penalties are, it&rsquo;s really not that big of a deal for a team in the nugget&rsquo;s position.</p>

<p>1 Can&rsquo;t use the mid-level exception. Who are they realistically going to use this on anyway? Last year it was reggie who they just gave up their last remaining tradeable picks to get off of. Whoever it ends up being I guarantee they&rsquo;re far less valuable than KCP.</p>

<p>2 Can&rsquo;t aggregate together salaries. What salaries do the nuggets even have to aggregate together? It&rsquo;s the top 4 guys who presumably are not getting traded then Zeke Nnaji at $8M and a bunch of rookie contracts. I guess this takes the option of combining MPJ and Zeke to trade for a higher salaried player but the nuggets have no picks to trade anyway so who are they going to go after?</p>

<p>3 2032 first round pick gets frozen.</p>

<p>Would the team really be less flexible if they just had KCPs salary to trade, as well as Reggie and the picks they gave up to get rid of him but were in the second apron? maybe slightly? To me, this is clearly a cost cutting move 100% I doubt the second apron penalties really factored in at all.</p>

Unless your owner is willing to pay insane taxes it&rsquo;s just going to keep good teams from sticking together for any length of time. It might be good for parity but excessive player movement was already something fans complain about and now it&rsquo;s going to get even worse.</p>

This new CBA, as talked about on a ton of sports podcasts, will probably do more to hurt small and mid market teams than help then because they won’t be able or likely to pony up for it. I’m legit looking at OKC (and partly Jazz) who are going to have a stranglehold on picks and great players but won’t have a chance at keeping as many as they could under the old system.</p>

<p>There has been open speculation by NBA insiders The last 24 hours questioning why it hasn&rsquo;t been done. Especially since he is currently playing for team Canada and scrimmaging with them.</p>

<p>What is happening in Denver is very confusing. People here seem to be blaming it on the new CPA, that is not the case. Signing kcp would push them into the second apron, but the only real penalty would be stopping them from using the mid-level exception. The trade restrictions aren&rsquo;t really onerous unless they are blowing it up.</p>

<p>Tim Bontemps absolutely eviscerated them. Pointing out that that this is not a new CBA issue and they are just being cheap owners. This is a very different case than letting Brown walk last year.</p>

      <label for="lb7uxhn" class="commentText"><p>KCP is also going to be 34 years old by the end of this contract and he is already regressing way more quickly than I have seen discussed. Trading from the second apron would require taking a single equal salary in return and there is no way that anyone would give a positive player next year unless we include a first round pick, and then we’d still be in the second apron with fewer assets and a fresh question mark getting paid $20M.</p>

      <label for="lb8vw89" class="commentText"><p>Defensively he did regress this year though, it’s true. The team started this year with a huge push campaigning for this to be KCPs first team all defense year and he just never came close to matching that expectation. He’s still a good defender, but you can tell he slowed down last year even from the year prior to that. I liked KCP and wish we could have resigned him, but if there was one starter who we could possibly replace it was him.</p>

Sure you pay KCP for 2 years and then get fucked by all the constraints imagineable but now youve gotten worse in a conference which keeps getting better with no way of improving anyways. Its not like the added flexbility allows you guys to get someone better than KCP.</p>

      <label for="lb9xiet" class="commentText"><p>Yeah but you guys didnt have a championship winning starting 5. Lets say you guys beat Boston and DJJ plays a vital role, he isnt getting shipped out for Marshall. The Nuggets dont have to pivot, all they have to do is keep talent around Jokic for the next 2 years or so and try and win another championship. They dont have the assets to pivot either unless they move off of Jamal Murray or Aaron Gordon, which they shouldnt.</p>

<p>Sacrificing talent for flexibility is pointless when you cant do anything with that extra flexibility, Denver has no way of adding a KCP level player to their roster or rounding out their bench without KCP, they are just worse while in a time that Jokic is at his best.</p>

<p>The Mavs had a bunch of assets and picks to get some players and they managed to round out the roster, the Nuggets in a different spot.</p>

      <label for="lb6two7" class="commentText"><p>Second apron has less to do with costs and more to do with flexibility.</p>

<p>There’s an old analogy about a flour sack: First you dump out the flour. Then you shake it and some more comes out. Then you shake it some more and a bit more comes out. And you can always kinda shake it a bit more a get a bit more flour. It’s never truly empty.</p>

<p>And that’s how the old cap worked. Even if you were capped out you could use the MLE to add another piece, or pick up a guy off waivers, or dump a player for cap room or absorb a contract for talent. The sack was never truly empty.</p>

<p>But the second apron is different: Your exceptions are gone. Trades have to be dollar-for-dollar. You can’t pick up guys off waivers mid season. The sack is truly empty. Your roster situation is fucked. And so front offices are pulling out all the stops to avoid it.</p>

<p>You saw this with the Clippers and PG. Ballmer paid <span class="math inline">\(2B cash for that team.  Then he went out and paid \)</span>1.6B cash to build the stadium. And when James Dolan started to make his life difficult to try to protect his Forum concert revenue, Ballmer reached into his pocket and pulled out <span class="math inline">\(400m to just buy the damn Forum from him. So trust me when I say he’d have had no problem coming up with another \)</span>100m in salary + cap tax to give PG the money he got instead of the money they were offering.</p>

<p>It wasn’t about money. It was about not getting yourself painted into a corner with the second apron.</p>

<p>At some point though Mike Malone needs to have his hand forced to develop the young guys - part of winning a championship is having talent that outperforms their contract when the rest of your cap space is tied up in the big players. The easiest way to do that is with rookie-scale contracts because there&rsquo;s no guarantee you&rsquo;ll hit on a Bruce Brown every offseason.</p>

<p>It’s really reckless of Booth to think that picks 22-30 are able to consistently find heavy rotation players. He’s trying to replicate the two timelines luck that GS had with the lucked into ‘22 ring. Jokic has a handful of years at this level and it’s being wasted on ‘hopes’ of 2-4 more rookies becoming a playoff caliber players before they have 3y of experience under their belt.</p>

<p>If they let him walk then they have options to add players that aren&rsquo;t draft picks, but they lose a critical piece.</p>

      <label for="lb6vfvr" class="commentText"><p>It’s more a condemnation of Booth if there is no pivot to replace depth, KCP is just the most recent. 4 heavy rotational players since 2023 have been replaced with rookie aspirations so far. Maybe moves are to be made still (Russ I guess 🤷), I can only hope something is done with Nnaji’s 8m. But as of now the Nuggets are relying on 2 PGs, Center, 2 wings and Guard on rookie contracts to take a large enough jump to be trusted in the West Playoffs.</p>

<p>Maybe if they saw ATL or the Bulls the first round I’d feel better, but none of the 1-8 in the West allows room for error. Rookies will get played off the court if they aren’t ready.</p>

<p>Only Malone has to deal with playing rookies as his 6th man of the bench. It&rsquo;s completely insane what Denver&rsquo;s FO has given both him and Jokic. The only reason Denver won was basically Nikola Jokic historic 4 year run that made him a complete monster able to carry a roster without any all star, all defensive or all nba talent.</p>

      <label for="lb8ckv9" class="commentText"><p>If the Nuggets choose not to invest in those guys, develop them, work on lineups, tinker with what works/what doesn’t then that’s a Malone and FO issue. Especially if your franchise is led by a 3-time MVP who was picked 41st during a taco bell commercial and you can’t find playable role players in the 20s…sounds like some complaining.</p>

They “got close” to matching which probably means 3 years at slightly less money and a team option instead of a player option. That means his overall money could have been 40 something million instead of 66 million. Huge difference and that’s not even factoring in no state income tax which is another 5 percent he gets to keep.</p>

<p>The sad truth is that of all of their starters, KCP is the most replaceable from a skill &amp; production standpoint.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s under-appreciated how difficult it is to assemble such a coherent complementary roster &ndash;and to retain players like KCP who&rsquo;s value is amplified by them.</p>

Murray had an off series, they lost a tough matchup and now we’re supposed to act like their bench (that’s been bad for 5 years) is the thing that doomed them. In reality they were depending on the same 5 guys they always have and 2 of them were kind of off. The team was fine.</p>

      <label for="lb6at06" class="commentText"><p>This is not cost cutting and it annoys me so many people think it is. Signing KCP locks us into the 2nd apron, which severely limits our trade possibilities and only allows us to sign people for vet min. Before people forget, our bench also sucks ass and desperately needs someone who can come off and create for themselves.</p>

<p>You can argue whether it&rsquo;s more important to keep KCP or reinforce our bench, but to think this is like a money-saving tactic of the FO is stupid.</p>

      <label for="lb7bm8c" class="commentText"><p>What moves will they be able to make when they have 1 tradable pick and no tradable players with reasonably high salary except for Zeke who they will have to give assets to get rid of.They only have TPMLE with which they can&rsquo;t get a player of similar value considering that last time they used it on Reggie Jackson who they had to salary dump for 3 2nd rounders, which is baffling to me that it cost that much considering that the Clippers paid 1 2nd rounder and got Mason Plumlee back when salary dumping him even though he had 10 mil on his contract.
If they resigned KCP they would&rsquo;ve at least been able to trade him in a year or two this way they don&rsquo;t have tradeable salaries or picks beacuse Calvin Booth wasted all of them on deals where he got fleeced or made picks which didn&rsquo;t pan out.</p>

      <label for="lb6gjlv" class="commentText"><p>Man, the panic from /r/DenverNuggets is spilling over into this sub.</p>

<p>Losing KCP was expected. Being in the 2nd apron made it incredibly hard to re-sign him. The team has been investing in young talent and just landed a potential stud in the draft in DeRon Holmes.</p>

<p>Yeah, it’s gonna be rough seeing Braun or Watson play significant minutes this season. But they’re both good on defense, and have shown flashes of improving on the offensive end.</p>

<p>The core of Jokic/Murray/MPJ/Gordon is still top-5 in the league. But Braun needs to step up into his starting role at SG going into his 3rd season, and Watson needs to provide a consistent spark off the bench.</p>

<p>The offseason isn’t over yet, and the Nuggets are still in the top-4 discussion in the West with OKC/Dallas/Minny. (OKC/DAL look like the clear favorites, but the next few spots are wide open)</p>

This should’ve happened a decade ago before the KD warriors ruined the league for a few years. It was genuinely unwatchable at times unless you were a dubs fan. The league is going to have more and more parity as we go on because when a player on a championship winner plays himself into a contract, the team is unlikely to be able to afford him.</p>

We were usually 20th-28th in spending and the Spurs did something that is just not replicable at all winning as much as we did.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s gotten even harder in the last decade with how much the Cavs and Warriors pushed spending up to basically buy chips each year, small market teams will struggle keeping great role players in their core.</p>

<p>Idk much about Denvers ownership but Stan Kroenke seems to have a lot of stake in a lot of teams in different leagues around the world among other things so its easy to say he spreads his worth out.</p>
