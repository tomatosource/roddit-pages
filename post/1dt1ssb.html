</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Particularly as Denver is a small market and not really an FA destination so they might never get another Jokic-level player for the next 50 years so this isn&rsquo;t even like the Lakers where they can expect to get Shaq or LeBron falling into their lap when they hit FA at some point</p>

<p>Insane not to prioritize the current window when it might be the best run you ever have in this case</p>

<p>Imagine if this was LeBron or Steph all ESPN would be doing all day long is running segments on how horrible this is by the FO and why they need to leave now</p>

Would it have been amazing to win more championships with Giannis, of course, but they did win once and it was incredible. It is so hard to win a championship in sports, let alone do it multiple times. It’s insane to expect a team like the Nuggets, Bucks or whoever to just win multiple like it’s a guarantee. </p>

<p>I still really like him and think he can improve, but we&rsquo;re definitely paying a bit too much for a glorified role player.  Tough to replace what he offers though.</p>

But somehow KCP and Jamal just get a pass and MPJ gets the blame? At least MPJ showed up for The Lakers series and played 81 regular season games for us. That is ALOT more than Jamal can hang his hat on last season.</p>

<p>For the record I love them both it just seems like the MPJ slander is getting out of hand.</p>

      <label for="lb853oj" class="commentText"><p>i think the majority of the commentary i see on it is about MPJ&rsquo;s contract, and his game&rsquo;s value relative to his contract. Which i feel like is appropriate, as opposed to just shitting on his game or stats or saying hes not good enough. And i agree his contract is definitely an obstacle to roster building.</p>

<p>I mostly commented bc i don&rsquo;t think i agree that MPJ slander is getting out of hand, but i definitely do think it&rsquo;s interesting how quiet the sub has been about Murray&rsquo;s performance. Some offensively cold games from a defensively minded role player i feel was maybe a little underdiscussed. But i feel like i haven&rsquo;t seen any threads or anything about how bad Murray was in the playoffs this year. I mean it was bad man. and tbf yeah he was injured, and i was in the game threads mad at other team fans shitting on him without mentioning that he was injured. but man it was still bad and i feel like there wasn&rsquo;t even like actual non-meme discussion about it here.</p>

      <label for="lb7wza8" class="commentText"><p>Yeah the Celtics are likely dependent on continuing to win. If they stop winning, they’ll likely move off one or both of the KP and Holiday deals and look to reset their cap penalties before attempting to retool.</p>

<p>The major difference is Denver just wasn’t as well positioned to try something like that after their championship. It wasn’t a question of extending someone like White or Holiday who are obviously no brainers on the deals they got and could probably be flipped for positive value, it was deciding if they’d overpay to keep Bruce Brown. With a weaker roster leading to a worse season, it then made it even harder to justify keeping KCP who while being a great role player also is not on the level of Holiday and White.</p>

<p>It also doesn’t help that MPJ has a max eating their space. I feel like they need him to turn into a legit 3rd option, but he’s still more a high end role player. It would be like if White never built up the confidence to raise his scoring volume, but was extended assuming that he might.</p>

You can see that in the Nuggets, Bucks, Lakers and Warriors, all these teams were built using the previous cba as their roster construction guide. Now the cap is different and the 2nd apron/other new cba construction/cap stuff would smash their skull if they continued on business as usual. It&rsquo;s going to be a bit awkward and painful because every new cba comes with growing pains and a need to build out the roster under a different set of rules/different cap.</p>

The other reasons are the bad contracts for Zeke Nnaji and MPJ, but when you have Jokic you need to be able to figure out better ways to work around that. Hopefully they can snag someone on the cheap, otherwise this is a disaster of a couple off seasons that are weirdly being excused by Nuggets fans insisting that Kroenke isn’t cheap.</p>

<p>1 Can&rsquo;t use the mid-level exception. Who are they realistically going to use this on anyway? Last year it was reggie who they just gave up their last remaining tradeable picks to get off of. Whoever it ends up being I guarantee they&rsquo;re far less valuable than KCP.</p>

<p>2 Can&rsquo;t aggregate together salaries. What salaries do the nuggets even have to aggregate together? It&rsquo;s the top 4 guys who presumably are not getting traded then Zeke Nnaji at $8M and a bunch of rookie contracts. I guess this takes the option of combining MPJ and Zeke to trade for a higher salaried player but the nuggets have no picks to trade anyway so who are they going to go after?</p>

<p>3 2032 first round pick gets frozen.</p>

<p>Would the team really be less flexible if they just had KCPs salary to trade, as well as Reggie and the picks they gave up to get rid of him but were in the second apron? maybe slightly? To me, this is clearly a cost cutting move 100% I doubt the second apron penalties really factored in at all.</p>

      <label for="lb7kxfs" class="commentText"><p>Everyone was so happy about the CBA being a specific middle finger to the Warriors but I think with time it&rsquo;s going to become less and less popular. Unless your owner is willing to pay insane taxes it&rsquo;s just going to keep good teams from sticking together for any length of time. It might be good for parity but excessive player movement was already something fans complain about and now it&rsquo;s going to get even worse.</p>

      <label for="lb7n2y8" class="commentText"><p>Exactly this. This new CBA, as talked about on a ton of sports podcasts, will probably do more to hurt small and mid market teams than help then because they won’t be able or likely to pony up for it. I’m legit looking at OKC (and partly Jazz) who are going to have a stranglehold on picks and great players but won’t have a chance at keeping as many as they could under the old system.</p>

<p>This cba never would&rsquo;ve worked when TV money was less so teams had greater variation in revenue- the league needed to some extent the major markets that could earn money to spend more than the smaller markets.</p>

      <label for="lb6s8up" class="commentText"><p>It wasn&rsquo;t actually signed . There were reports that they were close to an agreement not that an agreement is in place.</p>

<p>There has been open speculation by NBA insiders The last 24 hours questioning why it hasn&rsquo;t been done. Especially since he is currently playing for team Canada and scrimmaging with them.</p>

<p>What is happening in Denver is very confusing. People here seem to be blaming it on the new CPA, that is not the case. Signing kcp would push them into the second apron, but the only real penalty would be stopping them from using the mid-level exception. The trade restrictions aren&rsquo;t really onerous unless they are blowing it up.</p>

<p>Tim Bontemps absolutely eviscerated them. Pointing out that that this is not a new CBA issue and they are just being cheap owners. This is a very different case than letting Brown walk last year.</p>

Trading from the second apron would require taking a single equal salary in return and there is no way that anyone would give a positive player next year unless we include a first round pick, and then we’d still be in the second apron with fewer assets and a fresh question mark getting paid $20M.</p>

<p>At some point though Mike Malone needs to have his hand forced to develop the young guys - part of winning a championship is having talent that outperforms their contract when the rest of your cap space is tied up in the big players. The easiest way to do that is with rookie-scale contracts because there&rsquo;s no guarantee you&rsquo;ll hit on a Bruce Brown every offseason.</p>

      <label for="lb6rgij" class="commentText"><p>We won with a #4 AG, #7 Jamal, #8 KCP, #14 MPJ and #42 Jokic. Without the outlier we used all former top 15 picks to win a championship. If we didn’t draft them doesn’t change that high draft picks made up the starting 5 and played the biggest role.</p>

<p>It’s really reckless of Booth to think that picks 22-30 are able to consistently find heavy rotation players. He’s trying to replicate the two timelines luck that GS had with the lucked into ‘22 ring. Jokic has a handful of years at this level and it’s being wasted on ‘hopes’ of 2-4 more rookies becoming a playoff caliber players before they have 3y of experience under their belt.</p>

<p>part of winning a championship is having talent that outperforms their contract when the rest of your cap space is tied up in the big players</p>

<p>What players were developed during Bucks championship run? Or Warriors most recent run? Or Boston&rsquo;s run?</p>

<p>Only Malone has to deal with playing rookies as his 6th man of the bench. It&rsquo;s completely insane what Denver&rsquo;s FO has given both him and Jokic. The only reason Denver won was basically Nikola Jokic historic 4 year run that made him a complete monster able to carry a roster without any all star, all defensive or all nba talent.</p>

They “got close” to matching which probably means 3 years at slightly less money and a team option instead of a player option. That means his overall money could have been 40 something million instead of 66 million. Huge difference and that’s not even factoring in no state income tax which is another 5 percent he gets to keep.</p>

<p>Also, Florida always is going to be more appealing compared to other places a player doesn&rsquo;t want to live because they don&rsquo;t have state income tax.  That&rsquo;s a 4 million dollar bonus on a $100 million contract compared to Colorado.</p>

<p>There’s an old analogy about a flour sack: First you dump out the flour. Then you shake it and some more comes out. Then you shake it some more and a bit more comes out. And you can always kinda shake it a bit more a get a bit more flour. It’s never truly empty.</p>

<p>And that’s how the old cap worked. Even if you were capped out you could use the MLE to add another piece, or pick up a guy off waivers, or dump a player for cap room or absorb a contract for talent. The sack was never truly empty.</p>

<p>But the second apron is different: Your exceptions are gone. Trades have to be dollar-for-dollar. You can’t pick up guys off waivers mid season. The sack is truly empty. Your roster situation is fucked. And so front offices are pulling out all the stops to avoid it.</p>

<p>You saw this with the Clippers and PG. Ballmer paid <span class="math inline">\(2B cash for that team.  Then he went out and paid \)</span>1.6B cash to build the stadium. And when James Dolan started to make his life difficult to try to protect his Forum concert revenue, Ballmer reached into his pocket and pulled out <span class="math inline">\(400m to just buy the damn Forum from him. So trust me when I say he’d have had no problem coming up with another \)</span>100m in salary + cap tax to give PG the money he got instead of the money they were offering.</p>

<p>It wasn’t about money. It was about not getting yourself painted into a corner with the second apron.</p>

Murray had an off series, they lost a tough matchup and now we’re supposed to act like their bench (that’s been bad for 5 years) is the thing that doomed them. In reality they were depending on the same 5 guys they always have and 2 of them were kind of off. The team was fine.</p>

      <label for="lb6hum1" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think this take acknowledges the CBA restrictions at their salary tier.</p>

<p>The sad truth is that of all of their starters, KCP is the most replaceable from a skill &amp; production standpoint.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s under-appreciated how difficult it is to assemble such a coherent complementary roster &ndash;and to retain players like KCP who&rsquo;s value is amplified by them.</p>

      <label for="lb6at06" class="commentText"><p>This is not cost cutting and it annoys me so many people think it is. Signing KCP locks us into the 2nd apron, which severely limits our trade possibilities and only allows us to sign people for vet min. Before people forget, our bench also sucks ass and desperately needs someone who can come off and create for themselves.</p>

<p>You can argue whether it&rsquo;s more important to keep KCP or reinforce our bench, but to think this is like a money-saving tactic of the FO is stupid.</p>

If they resigned KCP they would&rsquo;ve at least been able to trade him in a year or two this way they don&rsquo;t have tradeable salaries or picks beacuse Calvin Booth wasted all of them on deals where he got fleeced or made picks which didn&rsquo;t pan out.</p>

      <label for="lb6gjlv" class="commentText"><p>Man, the panic from /r/DenverNuggets is spilling over into this sub.</p>

<p>Losing KCP was expected. Being in the 2nd apron made it incredibly hard to re-sign him. The team has been investing in young talent and just landed a potential stud in the draft in DeRon Holmes.</p>

<p>Yeah, it’s gonna be rough seeing Braun or Watson play significant minutes this season. But they’re both good on defense, and have shown flashes of improving on the offensive end.</p>

<p>The core of Jokic/Murray/MPJ/Gordon is still top-5 in the league. But Braun needs to step up into his starting role at SG going into his 3rd season, and Watson needs to provide a consistent spark off the bench.</p>

<p>The offseason isn’t over yet, and the Nuggets are still in the top-4 discussion in the West with OKC/Dallas/Minny. (OKC/DAL look like the clear favorites, but the next few spots are wide open)</p>

      <label for="lb7965w" class="commentText"><p>Feels like a common refrain for people defending the nuggets is that the second apron changes enforces too much of a penalty. And yes the penalties are harsh but again this is Jokic&rsquo; prime &hellip; you can be in the second apron for two years without losing your first rounder 7 years in the future .. even if you lose your first rounder 7 years in the future it&rsquo;s still worth it to keep Jokic surrounded with talent</p>

<p>Now if the nuggets figure out some moves to make it all work or their young guys step up massively then ok guess they knew best. But honestly, they should have still said fuck it and went into the second apron and keep KCP and just figure out the consequences later. Once you lose the salary slot you can&rsquo;t get it back as easily. Now they&rsquo;re down a Bruce Brown and a KCP level talent from their championship squad</p>

We were usually 20th-28th in spending and the Spurs did something that is just not replicable at all winning as much as we did.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s gotten even harder in the last decade with how much the Cavs and Warriors pushed spending up to basically buy chips each year, small market teams will struggle keeping great role players in their core.</p>

<p>Idk much about Denvers ownership but Stan Kroenke seems to have a lot of stake in a lot of teams in different leagues around the world among other things so its easy to say he spreads his worth out.</p>

<p>This is a core of 1st and 2nd contracts already squished in because 2 of our centers got paid decently handsomely</p>

<p>Straightup not having IQ and RJ on the books means you could at least tank <em>truly</em> hard for a 2nd cost-controlled All-Star for the first 4 years. If you don&rsquo;t overpay your role players while you&rsquo;re not a contender, they go elsewhere. If you don&rsquo;t overpay them when you&rsquo;re a contender, you also lose them</p>
