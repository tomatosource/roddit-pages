</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Particularly as Denver is a small market and not really an FA destination so they might never get another Jokic-level player for the next 50 years so this isn&rsquo;t even like the Lakers where they can expect to get Shaq or LeBron falling into their lap when they hit FA at some point</p>

<p>Insane not to prioritize the current window when it might be the best run you ever have in this case</p>

<p>Imagine if this was LeBron or Steph all ESPN would be doing all day long is running segments on how horrible this is by the FO and why they need to leave now</p>

<p>Yeah he won a chip but Denver could have had the opportunity to win multiple. They will have a good shot at contending but it will be tough to improve that bench significantly while being in the 2nd apron</p>

<p>Then he went on to help the Nuggets win their first title, then immediately after played 81 games in the regular season (missed the 1 game because of a shoe issue lol)</p>

<p>I wouldn’t say it’s getting worse and worse at all. His health is the best it has been in years. He had a great series against the Lakers and a shit one against Minnesota, it happens</p>

      <label for="lb6s0uo" class="commentText"><p>It’s less about how many games he played a season and more about the production he provides on the court within those 81 games. He is too one-dimensional of a player to be deserving of a max.</p>

<p>When he first signed that contract, there was hope that he would develop his game into a well-rounded player, but as time has gone by, it is becoming more clear his ceiling is a sharpshooter who can’t consistently defend that’s getting paid 50 million a year</p>

      <label for="lb6trkz" class="commentText"><p>Fair point. All I’ll say is that I don’t really regret the contract as a Nuggets fan, he was pivotal to the title run even if he didnt stuff the box score and all I can really do is continue to have faith in him.</p>

<p>Even if his game has theoretically peaked, he’s still a matchup nightmare due to his shooting prowess and height combined. I’d say his health is the more important factor for the Nuggets continued success rather than him adding more elements to his game (though obviously that would be great too)</p>

<p>In a theoretical extension, probably he doesn’t get as much money. But who knows, new NBA money means anyone can throw a gigantic bag at him and it’s just another KCP/Bruce Brown situation</p>

<p>I still really like him and think he can improve, but we&rsquo;re definitely paying a bit too much for a glorified role player.  Tough to replace what he offers though.</p>

      <label for="lb6osxf" class="commentText"><p>It looked horrible at the time imo. He was coming off one semi healthy season and they extended him a year earlier than they needed. He has improved but not in a way to make him a 38-42M player. He can’t dribble more than twice, play defense consistently and his effort varies by the matchup. He’s essentially a 6th man scorer that can’t set himself up. If not for Jokics ability to throw him open he’d be highly inefficient since he can’t create space on his own.</p>

But somehow KCP and Jamal just get a pass and MPJ gets the blame? At least MPJ showed up for The Lakers series and played 81 regular season games for us. That is ALOT more than Jamal can hang his hat on last season.</p>

<p>For the record I love them both it just seems like the MPJ slander is getting out of hand.</p>

      <label for="lb6b5jg" class="commentText"><p>Championship teams that were built under the last cba are scrambling to get value and retool to work under this cba. You can see that in the Nuggets, Bucks, Lakers and Warriors, all these teams were built using the previous cba as their roster construction guide. Now the cap is different and the 2nd apron/other new cba construction/cap stuff would smash their skull if they continued on business as usual. It&rsquo;s going to be a bit awkward and painful because every new cba comes with growing pains and a need to build out the roster under a different set of rules/different cap.</p>

Every time I see someone acting like this is purely about Kroenke not wanting to pay the tax I roll my eyes. Might that be part of it? Sure, but removing most of the tools that allow the GM to make a team better is a big fucking deal.</p>

Slightly outdated internet sources say Colorado does not have a separate tax bracket for jock taxes but state income tax is a flat 4.4%.  For 41 home games, that&rsquo;s <span class="math inline">\(484k saved on \)</span>22M.  By moving from Western conference to Eastern, that cuts out a minimum of 4 California games, which are taxed at the standard state income tax rate of 13.3%, highest in the country by far.

      <label for="lb7efsj" class="commentText"><p>The Nuggets have almost never paid the luxury tax, so I think it’s safe to say it’s a huge reason. The other reasons are the bad contracts for Zeke Nnaji and MPJ, but when you have Jokic you need to be able to figure out better ways to work around that. Hopefully they can snag someone on the cheap, otherwise this is a disaster of a couple off seasons that are weirdly being excused by Nuggets fans insisting that Kroenke isn’t cheap.</p>

      <label for="lb6s8up" class="commentText"><p>It wasn&rsquo;t actually signed . There were reports that they were close to an agreement not that an agreement is in place.</p>

<p>There has been open speculation by NBA insiders The last 24 hours questioning why it hasn&rsquo;t been done. Especially since he is currently playing for team Canada and scrimmaging with them.</p>

<p>What is happening in Denver is very confusing. People here seem to be blaming it on the new CPA, that is not the case. Signing kcp would push them into the second apron, but the only real penalty would be stopping them from using the mid-level exception. The trade restrictions aren&rsquo;t really onerous unless they are blowing it up.</p>

<p>Tim Bontemps absolutely eviscerated them. Pointing out that that this is not a new CBA issue and they are just being cheap owners. This is a very different case than letting Brown walk last year.</p>

They “got close” to matching which probably means 3 years at slightly less money and a team option instead of a player option. That means his overall money could have been 40 something million instead of 66 million. Huge difference and that’s not even factoring in no state income tax which is another 5 percent he gets to keep.</p>

<p>At some point though Mike Malone needs to have his hand forced to develop the young guys - part of winning a championship is having talent that outperforms their contract when the rest of your cap space is tied up in the big players. The easiest way to do that is with rookie-scale contracts because there&rsquo;s no guarantee you&rsquo;ll hit on a Bruce Brown every offseason.</p>

      <label for="lb6k0t5" class="commentText"><p>Malone has a notoriously short hook with young players and really only plays 8 guys in the playoffs. Keeping his rotation too tight cost them this year in the playoffs. Playing his starters too many minutes in the regular season while trying to get a top seed gassed the starters, and it showed in the Wolves series.</p>

<p>Last year, 2023 run, Braun had several defensive lapses in the playoffs, and Malone freaked out and took him out of the rotation for like 2-3 games. These were mental mistakes that Jamal Murray and MPJ routinely make as vets while giving 50% of Brauns defensive effort. This is Malone&rsquo;s attitude as a coach. It&rsquo;s extremely old school and is not the most conducive to developing young players, in my opinion.</p>

<p>The only starters you could argue Malone &ldquo;developed&rdquo; are Jokic, Murray, and MPJ. But at least woth Jokic and Murray he had no choice but to let them develop because they were not contending at the beginning of his tenure. Jokic is basketball Mozart who was a ROY candidate and good from day one. Murray has always had the greenlight to do what ever he wants on the court from Malone. If anything Malone needed to rein him in more than he has. And MPJ is another guy who&rsquo;s gotten the short hook from Malone early in his career.</p>

<p>I would say his development of young talent has been spotty at best.</p>

If we didn’t draft them doesn’t change that high draft picks made up the starting 5 and played the biggest role.</p>

<p>It’s really reckless of Booth to think that picks 22-30 are able to consistently find heavy rotation players. He’s trying to replicate the two timelines luck that GS had with the lucked into ‘22 ring. Jokic has a handful of years at this level and it’s being wasted on ‘hopes’ of 2-4 more rookies becoming a playoff caliber players before they have 3y of experience under their belt.</p>

<p>If they let him walk then they have options to add players that aren&rsquo;t draft picks, but they lose a critical piece.</p>

<p>No one knows what the right answer is, but there is no version of reality where Denver can keep KCP and also add a bunch of veterans to fill out the bench</p>

      <label for="lb6vfvr" class="commentText"><p>It’s more a condemnation of Booth if there is no pivot to replace depth, KCP is just the most recent. 4 heavy rotational players since 2023 have been replaced with rookie aspirations so far. Maybe moves are to be made still (Russ I guess 🤷), I can only hope something is done with Nnaji’s 8m. But as of now the Nuggets are relying on 2 PGs, Center, 2 wings and Guard on rookie contracts to take a large enough jump to be trusted in the West Playoffs.</p>

<p>Maybe if they saw ATL or the Bulls the first round I’d feel better, but none of the 1-8 in the West allows room for error. Rookies will get played off the court if they aren’t ready.</p>

<p>part of winning a championship is having talent that outperforms their contract when the rest of your cap space is tied up in the big players</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What players were developed during Bucks championship run? Or Warriors most recent run? Or Boston&rsquo;s run?</p>

<p>Only Malone has to deal with playing rookies as his 6th man of the bench. It&rsquo;s completely insane what Denver&rsquo;s FO has given both him and Jokic. The only reason Denver won was basically Nikola Jokic historic 4 year run that made him a complete monster able to carry a roster without any all star, all defensive or all nba talent.</p>

Signing KCP locks us into the 2nd apron, which severely limits our trade possibilities and only allows us to sign people for vet min. Before people forget, our bench also sucks ass and desperately needs someone who can come off and create for themselves.</p>

<p>You can argue whether it&rsquo;s more important to keep KCP or reinforce our bench, but to think this is like a money-saving tactic of the FO is stupid.</p>

If they resigned KCP they would&rsquo;ve at least been able to trade him in a year or two this way they don&rsquo;t have tradeable salaries or picks beacuse Calvin Booth wasted all of them on deals where he got fleeced or made picks which didn&rsquo;t pan out.</p>

      <label for="lb7cvnl" class="commentText"><p>The hope is that if they do get Westbrook, he will be tied into the Reggie Jackson deal. As for everything else, you&rsquo;d need to wait until FA is over to judge, but I understand both approaches in this situation, and I think only time will tell which one would have been the best decision.</p>

<p>Nuggets this season felt like it was really lacking at the margins with the bench, and signing KCP means you would go yet another season only able to make lateral moves with vet min signings. Maybe it works out, maybe it doesn&rsquo;t. Meanwhile letting KCP go you take a bet Christian Braun will be able to fill in for the role in some capacity, and now you have more flexibility to sign bench players worth more than a vet min. It&rsquo;s also important to say that KCP is 31, and his stats this season were worse than his stats in the championship season. If you sign him on the hopes of trading him later, he might decline even further and all of a sudden you have to take a trade on a loss.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying which decision is right, this is something we have to wait to find out. I&rsquo;m just saying there&rsquo;s more nuance to this than most people just assume.</p>

<p>The sad truth is that of all of their starters, KCP is the most replaceable from a skill &amp; production standpoint.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s under-appreciated how difficult it is to assemble such a coherent complementary roster &ndash;and to retain players like KCP who&rsquo;s value is amplified by them.</p>

      <label for="lb6gjlv" class="commentText"><p>Man, the panic from /r/DenverNuggets is spilling over into this sub.</p>

<p>Losing KCP was expected. Being in the 2nd apron made it incredibly hard to re-sign him. The team has been investing in young talent and just landed a potential stud in the draft in DeRon Holmes.</p>

<p>Yeah, it’s gonna be rough seeing Braun or Watson play significant minutes this season. But they’re both good on defense, and have shown flashes of improving on the offensive end.</p>

<p>The core of Jokic/Murray/MPJ/Gordon is still top-5 in the league. But Braun needs to step up into his starting role at SG going into his 3rd season, and Watson needs to provide a consistent spark off the bench.</p>

<p>The offseason isn’t over yet, and the Nuggets are still in the top-4 discussion in the West with OKC/Dallas/Minny. (OKC/DAL look like the clear favorites, but the next few spots are wide open)</p>

      <label for="lb78mhq" class="commentText"><p>They were instrumental because they had no one else and Jokic can squeeze at least a little production out of anyone much the same way LeBron could. Green and Braun sucked and wouldn’t have realistically helped any other team they averaged 7/3/1 between them. Green has been a minimum player for 8 seasons now. Realistically he and Braun were worse than Pritchard and Hauser this year, and they only got minutes because Boston had zero depth. Bruce was the one good player which is why he was immediately poached.</p>

      <label for="lb6two7" class="commentText"><p>Second apron has less to do with costs and more to do with flexibility.</p>

<p>There’s an old analogy about a flour sack: First you dump out the flour. Then you shake it and some more comes out. Then you shake it some more and a bit more comes out. And you can always kinda shake it a bit more a get a bit more flour. It’s never truly empty.</p>

<p>And that’s how the old cap worked. Even if you were capped out you could use the MLE to add another piece, or pick up a guy off waivers, or dump a player for cap room or absorb a contract for talent. The sack was never truly empty.</p>

<p>But the second apron is different: Your exceptions are gone. Trades have to be dollar-for-dollar. You can’t pick up guys off waivers mid season. The sack is truly empty. Your roster situation is fucked. And so front offices are pulling out all the stops to avoid it.</p>

<p>You saw this with the Clippers and PG. Ballmer paid <span class="math inline">\(2B cash for that team.  Then he went out and paid \)</span>1.6B cash to build the stadium. And when James Dolan started to make his life difficult to try to protect his Forum concert revenue, Ballmer reached into his pocket and pulled out <span class="math inline">\(400m to just buy the damn Forum from him. So trust me when I say he’d have had no problem coming up with another \)</span>100m in salary + cap tax to give PG the money he got instead of the money they were offering.</p>

<p>It wasn’t about money. It was about not getting yourself painted into a corner with the second apron.</p>

      <label for="lb6oeog" class="commentText"><p>It’s not their fault, the new nba rules make it so it’s hard to keep it going. This should’ve happened a decade ago before the KD warriors ruined the league for a few years. It was genuinely unwatchable at times unless you were a dubs fan. The league is going to have more and more parity as we go on because when a player on a championship winner plays himself into a contract, the team is unlikely to be able to afford him.</p>

<p>Nuggets are gonna be fine with Braun as a starter instead. He did way better on Ant and was locking up KD last season. Westbrook is gonna be a good fit off the bench despite what experts here say.</p>

They could have made the season (ehem) <em>splashier</em> by keeping the core together but no. Hope the FO is cooking up something else (let it be a big) because losing Klay’s volume and probably letting Wiggs walk away ain’t it, despite the tough year both those guys have just had.</p>

      <label for="lb7965w" class="commentText"><p>Feels like a common refrain for people defending the nuggets is that the second apron changes enforces too much of a penalty. And yes the penalties are harsh but again this is Jokic&rsquo; prime &hellip; you can be in the second apron for two years without losing your first rounder 7 years in the future .. even if you lose your first rounder 7 years in the future it&rsquo;s still worth it to keep Jokic surrounded with talent</p>

<p>Now if the nuggets figure out some moves to make it all work or their young guys step up massively then ok guess they knew best. But honestly, they should have still said fuck it and went into the second apron and keep KCP and just figure out the consequences later. Once you lose the salary slot you can&rsquo;t get it back as easily. Now they&rsquo;re down a Bruce Brown and a KCP level talent from their championship squad</p>
