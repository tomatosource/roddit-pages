You can see in OPs clip that although  his legs run like everyone elses, after he leaves the ground his calves and ankles almost twitch into position, he has an infinite range of motion to choose from too because he&rsquo;s so flexible, to bend an unpredictable angle to float in a shot. He&rsquo;s either an alien level freak with unteachable skills or he practiced his jump game ruthlessly. Whatever he did, he has extremely fast reflexes and unbelievable body awareness, especially in his lower extremities.</p>

<p>Young Jordan&rsquo;s dunks sounded thunderous. He&rsquo;s the only guy that is not a center that broke the board for a reason. It probably had to do with how he used to come off twisting after hanging from the rim (surprised he never developed hip and back problems from that).</p>

<p>When someone has mad hops and often fakes then shoots on the way down - that gives the appearance of floating because he’s using more of the entire jump and sometimes shooting on the way down.</p>

      <label for="lopt3vu" class="commentText"><p>Yep body control is extremely important. It&rsquo;s why players like Kyrie and D Rose were able to double and even sometimes triple clutch layups while twisting and turning their body to avoid the defense.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny because people wouldn&rsquo;t really define someone like Kyrie as super athletic because he doesn&rsquo;t jump out the gym or dunk much but those people also don&rsquo;t realize the sheer athleticism it takes to pull off some of those layups he does.</p>

<p>When I was younger I couldn&rsquo;t even do the shit he was doing while practicing on the court by myself lol nevermind with fucking 7 footers in the paint towering over me trying to swat my shit to Narnia.</p>

      <label for="lornvhv" class="commentText"><p>I knew Kyrie was special when I saw his high school highlights before going to Duke and he had that ridiculous reverse spin layup off the backboard. I know people can do that but the way he casually did it in an actual useful situation in a game setting just screamed natural talent and touch. It was just second nature to him and his control of the ball and his own body was already better than most seasoned pros.</p>

      <label for="lopmbjo" class="commentText"><p>This is my take too. His upper body control and strength to put up a shot while his body is descending gives him this extra second or so of “floating” effect.</p>

<p>All of the layup transitions and switching hands all happen because he has such insane strength to still put the shot up after all of the pageantry in the shot.</p>

      <label for="lopeima" class="commentText"><p>My attention span has slowly been killed by years of using this little pocket device. But if I catch some Michael Jordan highlights - my brain just eats it up and I keep watching like I did in the locker room in highschool with those MJ DVDs. I think its just the way he moved, no one has ever moved with the sheer <em>inertia</em> MJ had. It wasn’t perfection of the physical human body like Lebron, but rather otherworldly.</p>

<p>I don’t understand why the NBA doesn’t have a subscription service to old games so I could fall asleep to old HD NBA games. I’ve recreated it at home but its hard to find really high quality old games.</p>

      <label for="lop2qjh" class="commentText"><p>Quick story:  I am from Chicago.  In 1988-89 I was playing College Basketball at IIT.  In the Summer the NBA had a ProAm Summer League going at IIT’s gym.  The Summer League was for D1 college players and NBA players living in Chicago.  They would play games with a mix of NBA and college players.  The Flying Illini would show up.  It was that good.</p>

<p>Since I was going to school at IIT I, sometimes, got to play with the big dogs.  Most of the time I held my own but one day guess who shows up.</p>

<p>Yep.  And wouldn’t you know it… he is on the team I am playing against.  I am about 6’3” so, of course, I am playing shooting guard.  Well since he showed up late, as usual, he walks in the gym.  Crowd goes crazy when they see him.  He walks right up to the scorers table and checks in.  I am now guarding the greatest basketball player ever.  The exact one you see in this video.</p>

<p>I lasted two plays.  Two dunks.  Both baseline. Faster than anything I had ever seen in my life.  And this was in front of a black crowd y’all.  I had to leave the building.</p>

      <label for="lopueqe" class="commentText"><p>MJ is big.  He looks skinny on screen, but he is much bigger in person.  He is a legit 6’5” and wiry strong.  When he was driving past me I bumped into him trying to body him up a bit. (I am 6’3” 205) It was like hitting a taut collection of metal cables.  It was weird.</p>

<p>MJ is unbelievably quick.  It’s was weird because I am pretty sure I could out sprint him at the top end. But good God was he quick.  It was weird.  Like he was there and then ‘poof’ the crowd is cheering and he is coming down from his takeoff.</p>

<p>He did hit me in the ass after the 2nd play like “Nice try kid”.</p>

<p>Overall, he came in around 2nd Quarter.  Left shortly after the 3rd quarter.  Dropped like 30 on everyone and then drove away in his Ferrari.</p>

<p>Funny anecdote, Kenny Norman was on my team.  When MJ was checking in he asked who is guarding him.  Someone pointed to me and he was like, “Nope” smiled at me and walked away shaking his head.</p>

<p>He’s that good folks. I’ve played against Shawn Kemp, Chris Jackson and a bunch of former Illini players.  Ain’t no one close man.  He is the GOAT.</p>

<p>It’s not even close.  In short, he is even better than he looks.  What was the most remarkable was his skill.</p>

<p>IIRC at the time you played him he hadnt even started his offseason strength training regimen then (which happened after he lost to the Pistons in 7).</p>

      <label for="lorrs5n" class="commentText"><p>I would rather guard LeBron.  No doubt I would get cooked, but I *might* be able to pull something off when he wasn&rsquo;t paying attention.  High level basketball is a game of mistakes.  When everyone is good, there is not a lot of margin for error, so when it happens you pounce on it.</p>

<p>MJ was different.  Like I said, his skill was what elevated him.  Everyone thinks it was his athleticism.  To be honest, I know guys who could jump higher, run faster and maybe were even a slight bit quicker (Mahmoud Abdul Raouf was the quickest player I have ever seen).  MJ not only was all of those, but his b-ball skills were off the charts.  He made no mistakes.  None.  Not even an inch was given.</p>

<p>Most people don&rsquo;t know this, but his skill level with ball handling, dribbling, passing, etc. was maybe the best ever.  He just didn&rsquo;t show off like Steph or even someone like Zeke back in the day.  I am not exaggerating.  He may have been the most skilled player ever.  He toyed with the likes of Larry Bird, etc.</p>

<p>He just made no mistakes.  There is more than enough footage of pros talking about this.   That is the real reason he looks so smooth.  He was uber confident in his skills.  Ever remember someone stealing the ball from MJ?  How many bad passes did you see him throw? How many times did you see him accidentally kick the ball into the stands?</p>

<p>There is a reason Bobby Knight called him, while he was playing on the Olympic team which was beating the NBA pros, the best basketball player he has ever seen.  That&rsquo;s from Bobby Knight.  Arguably the greatest basketball coach of all time.  There is a story a Bobby K. speaking to Isiah Thomas about MJ, before MJ got into the league, Knight was like, &ldquo;Zeke&hellip;  This kid Jordan&hellip;  This is something different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not make mistakes.  That was what was scary about him.  So, if I had to guard one verse the other, I would go with Lebron.  He proly would  take me for granted and forget I was there, which would leave the door open for me to sneak/sneak.  Not MJ.  No way.  He NEVER messed around.  He was always serious.  When he got mad?</p>

<p>Go listen to Kevin Garnett talk about how when he talked smack to MJ as a rookie.</p>

      <label for="lorbwpk" class="commentText"><p>Last funny aside.  You all know Craig Robinson?  Michelle Obama’s brother?  The guy who coached at Princeton?  At the time he was still playing semi-pro ball for some Euro teams.  In the off season, he was a part time assistant coach at IIT at the time.  He was there watching.  As I was walking off the court he says, “Jordan’s a MF’er isn’t he?”  And he just giggled and walked away.</p>

<p>Was a sad day for sure.  😀. Had a bunch of kids from the ‘jets just riding me.  Some of the stuff they were saying, I have to admit, was pretty damn funny.</p>

<p>Hey.  If it was going to be anyone… might as well be the greatest ever to do it.</p>

<p>He was just better than everyone else and everyone knew it.  Pros, vets, playground legends and college players alike. If you’ve played ball at a high level you think you’re good.  But then there is MJ.</p>

<p>They didn’t call him Black Jesus for nothing.</p>

<p>Also people who think he was just an asshole are crazy. Jordan was honestly relatively humble considering his stature (given all that comes with it)</p>

<p>Was incredibly charismatic and kind/fair to the media, always gave his opponents respect and never felt like he was doing it as part of media training.</p>

<p>Played hard all the time and once he won he didn&rsquo;t stop. Yes he has flaws but as much as the word is overused today - he had a genuine aura</p>

Different times, you could get away with it. Today, you can&rsquo;t. As much as Kobe is looked at with rose colored glasses, he was a villain most of his career. MJ had a way that he looked down on people connected to him but also charmed people separated from him but his ego was joy filled and that came out. I don&rsquo;t think he was humble at all he just never let emotions control him.</p>

<p>Saying that, a guy like Lebron certainly is a better human and shit if he keeps playing at a high level may be not better at his peak but equally impressive and I&rsquo;m a Jordan stan.</p>

      <label for="loo5nsh" class="commentText"><p>I agree on Lebron - but he also stands on the shoulders of those before him, as we all do. Jordan honestly was a great role model - now the gambling and drinking was not as widespread among the general public when he was playing, more confined to serious NBA fans or the inner circle.</p>

<p>BUT as a cultural phenomenon he was pretty clean in the public eye, and became a (even if it was designed this way) a great role model for kids specifically regarding trying their best and working hard.</p>

<p>I think Jordan had a genuine humility about certain things though - like I never got the sense that Jordan fully thought he was bigger than the game etc. He always gave a TON of respect to legends and knew his rightful place. Of course he&rsquo;s insanely competitive and that leads to its own stuff but given the pedestal he was on at the time, IMO he could have been much more of an arrogant asshole. I always point to his interviews post the bad boy losses, very composed and mature. But yes as you said lol he&rsquo;s a big charmer.</p>

      <label for="looqc8y" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s also about era and upbringing. Jordan grew up in a strictly patriarchal environment, that shaped his mindset. He clearly respected legends from the past and didn&rsquo;t cheat the game. Even his teammates said he always practiced and sometimes went harder in practice than during the games. His trainer also said that Jordan always wanted to play every game cause he knew there could be fans that only had that one chance to see him perform. So it&rsquo;s not black and white. Jordan had certain virtues, but he also had flaws like every other human being. </p>

<p>Which is an artifact at the time, with the current media climate those &ldquo;like Mike&rdquo; commercials would fall flat, because even his stellar PR team wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to put a lid on all the off court drama with the media environment today.</p>

<p>Star athletes (rightfully ) weren&rsquo;t held to the same level of scrutiny as they are currently.  The league and the sports media had a much different relationship.  The media largely acted as PR for the league because in order to get access couldn&rsquo;t bite the hand that feeds you.   If you went after the golden goose that was making everyone money then access to players and staff was gonna dry up, if you didn&rsquo;t get outright blackballed.</p>

<p>24 hr sports news wasn&rsquo;t constantly reaching for shit to fill the airwaves and social media influencers weren&rsquo;t pushing drama for clicks, etc.    As someone who watched a lot of sports then, it&rsquo;s still kind of shocking how relentlessly negative and nitpicking the discourse around sports (and the NBA in particularly ) is these days, it&rsquo;s really quite distasteful.  There is an immense amount of talent on display and nobody can just sit back and appreciate it because everyone is constantly being bombarded by negativity and gaslighting designed to drive engagement.</p>

<p>IMO that difference in discourse is a significant contributor to the rose colored glasses people have for the 80s and 90s.  We collectively celebrated great players rather than focusing on tearing them down, and it just made it more enjoyable to experience.</p>

      <label for="looroib" class="commentText"><p>I agree with a lot of what you said, but the media definitely still acts as a PR for the league. There are certain criticisms that cannot be put out there against certain stars. Like Lebron&rsquo;s PED usage and no accusations have come out of all his paramours because they want LeBron to have a certain image. The NBA discourse is more like WWE or reality TV, that&rsquo;s the way they&rsquo;ve chosen to promote the league. Maybe that&rsquo;s what you need to do in the modern 24 hr sports news cycle. </p>

<p>The media isn&rsquo;t a monolith like it used to be.  Many (most?) sports writers have zero affiliation or direct interaction with the league or the players.  How exactly is the NBA going to exert control over writers they have no relationship with?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like Lebron&rsquo;s PED usage</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no actual sound evidence of this being true, otherwise it would be EVERYWHERE.  The LeBron haters on social media would be fucking feasting if there was anything more than a conspiracy theory to circlejerk to.  Dude is the most scrutinized athlete in history and no evidence beyond third hand relationships has ever been presented.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and no accusations have come out of all his paramours because they want LeBron to have a certain image.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, is there actually any credible evidence of this?  They have had no problem calling out other athletes for shit like this, so how does it make sense that every sports writer across dozens of different mediums all be secretly conspiring to protect LeBron from some embarrassment?  What the fuck do they care if he ends up divorced?  It&rsquo;s not going to impact his career or legacy, or the NBA at all.</p>

<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t even slightly believable then, let alone now.  Whats the more likely answer, that some clout chasing bozo is lying for attention, or that LeBron and Wade are out having 50 person orgies at some rando&rsquo;s house without any actual evidence of it ever happening, despite literally every single person in the world carrying a camera and recording device in their pocket.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>LeBrons name was on the biogenesis ledger when he was in Miami.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a great example of my point, people on social media play the telephone game to the point where the actual truth is misrepresented to the point that it is unrecognizable.  Acquaintances of his were on the biogenesis ledger and he was investigated as part of the investigation into those people, and the most important people always leave out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10089341-dea-lebron-james-was-investigated-never-did-anything-wrong-in-2013-biogenesis-probe" target="_blank">https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10089341-dea-lebron-james-was-investigated-never-did-anything-wrong-in-2013-biogenesis-probe</a></p>

<p>The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration briefly investigated LeBron James <strong>and cleared him of any wrongdoing</strong> as part of the 2013 Biogenesis investigation, according to federal documents obtained by ESPN&rsquo;s Mike Fish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s hoaxes like this going around on social media, which further confuse people that don&rsquo;t fact check the shit they are told:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lebron-james-olympic-drugs/" target="_blank">https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lebron-james-olympic-drugs/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also delonte West sleeping with Lebron&rsquo;s mom, that&rsquo;s one of the reasons he left Cleveland, but that story also disappeared.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The story came out, both LeBron and Delonte refused to comment on the matter.  What exactly was there to discuss after that point?</p>

<p>Sure, but having one member of the media doing it is much different than the entire media doing so.</p>

<p>Was it swept under the rug or was there a lack of evidence outside of unsubstantiated rumors so people just dropped it?  IDK how worked up you expect people to get over vague rumors.</p>

These days, they play <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the games, or less, with this huge salaries, without mentioning lack of effort in most of the regular season games. Exception confirms the rule.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s only understandable for fans to think players care about their money, even though they have plenty of it, and their stats, more than them or the game itself.</p>

<p>Plus players like LeBron and Giannis average like 5 more games/season than Barkley, Clyde, Hakeem, and the &ldquo;fragile&rdquo; KD only averages 1 less game/season than them.  I really don&rsquo;t think that load management is the primary difference between eras.</p>

I know the story right now is that LeBron speaks out on issues, builds schools, has maintained a good family life, but I think its very naive to think our image of either person is accurate. LeBron is not “certainly” a better person.</p>

This was a guy that claimed he was more than an athlete and yet when it came down to it, supported China because the bag was at stake. He has also been very passive aggressive throughout his career and thrown teammates under the bus, gotten them traded lol. GM LeBron isn&rsquo;t just a meme. LeBron has been the most powerful politician in pro sports for many years. At least Jordan didn&rsquo;t pretend to be a nice guy. He didn&rsquo;t pretend to be more than an athlete, Republicans do buy sneakers like the rest of them. He cared about his brand and marketability which has actually opened doors for all these other athletes in various sports to make loads of money while trying to act like they had more virtue than athletes from the past. </p>

<p>Again though I might just be a hater and he does seem like a good father and his kids seem humble and well adjusted as far as super rich kids go so I guess that says a lot</p>

      <label for="loowvil" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve said this before many times and I&rsquo;ll keep saying it,</p>

<p>MJ (and the 90s Bulls) put basketball in the world map. Everyone knows who he is. Even those that don&rsquo;t watch basketball know who he is. Pep Guardiola says one of his heroes is Jordan. When people are throwing &ldquo;greatest&rdquo; discussions on anything for comparison, his name gets thrown in (e.g. &ldquo;Michael Joran of this, MJ of that&rdquo; etc.). MJ and the Bulls helped spread the popularity of Basketball outside the US. They even served as the inspiration for the manga / anime Slam Dunk.</p>

<p>One thing I can&rsquo;t help but wonder is that if he was playing in this era, would he have adapted well to the long range shooting / 3 point era? I mean the 2nd  half of his career, he perfected the art of the midrange. I guess it&rsquo;s safe to say he would&rsquo;ve transitioned into a 3 pt shooter.</p>

Besides his competitive drive and work ethic that would&rsquo;ve led him to develop a &ldquo;deficiency&rdquo;, his shooting form was excellent and he excelled at fade-aways so I think it would&rsquo;ve come naturally if he decided to emphasize it in practice.</p>

Look at jeremy lin, who i’m a fan of, but a couple years in the league and he had the same jacked body as everybody else. Lin got busted for some PED thing in an asian league in the last year or so. It’s gotta be a popular thing in the pro’s. </p>

He didn’t go from stick to massive in a few months. He went from stick to solidly toned over the course of 2 years. If you saw him on the street in a t shirt i doubt his physique would even turn your head.</p>

<p>Now, if you were to bring up his conditioning, i couldn’t fight you on that point.</p>

      <label for="loqco9a" class="commentText"><p>Lightning in a bottle one in several billion genetic anomalies that we&rsquo;re born with not just one gift, like most gifted people, but a series of gifts that work in tandem and amplify one another. And those gifts just so happen to have a broad mainstream use, and they fit exactly perfect for a particular field.</p>

<p>MJ not only was a once in 50-100 years physical specimen that was built to play basketball, (6&rsquo;6&rdquo;, 4.3 speed, 48&rdquo; vert, gymnast-like agility, massive wingspan with gigantic hands) he had the relentless warrior mentality of a conquer to pair with an insane work ethic and the athletic IQ and instincts as well. Einstein not only having genius level intellect, but also being a creative genius and using those two areas of the brain simultaneously to have several eureka moments over a lifetime, that are still relevant today and people are still trying to improve upon or replace with better theories.</p>

<p>I think that’s why we appreciate him. He really tried as hard as humanly possible, even exceeding Jordan’s bag in some areas, but try as he might, he could never copy the original.</p>

<p>I think Sports go through Golden Ages just like any other human endeavor. The combination of media and entertainment in pop culture was at a crescendo in the 80-90-00s. It cannot be replicated, only appreciated</p>

Kobe is Kakashi, who while he lacks the natural deep reservoir of chakra that the greats have, he makes up for it by having probably the deepest bag in the shinobi world thanks to his sharingan.</p>

      <label for="loqc9yq" class="commentText"><p>My favorite part about watching MJ play offense, which I never hear anyone talk about, is how quickly he played. Most guys with a bag as deep as his fall in the trap of being a ball stopper. They get the ball and it just sticks, they start sizing up their defender going ISO, and the whole defense rotates and catches up. See Jason Tatum, KD, many other modern players. Jordan never was like that, he just got the ball and instantly made a play no matter what it was. He would almost never catch it and face up, make 50 ball fakes before shooting a terrible contested shot.</p>
