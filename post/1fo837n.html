      <label for="loo49a9" class="commentText"><p>Yep - Jordan was something else.</p>

<p>Also people who think he was just an asshole are crazy. Jordan was honestly relatively humble considering his stature (given all that comes with it)</p>

<p>Was incredibly charismatic and kind/fair to the media, always gave his opponents respect and never felt like he was doing it as part of media training.</p>

<p>Played hard all the time and once he won he didn&rsquo;t stop. Yes he has flaws but as much as the word is overused today - he had a genuine aura</p>

      <label for="loo4o0t" class="commentText"><p>Yea the asshole thing wasn&rsquo;t really known or played over and over. Public MJ was different than private MJ. Different times, you could get away with it. Today, you can&rsquo;t. As much as Kobe is looked at with rose colored glasses, he was a villain most of his career. MJ had a way that he looked down on people connected to him but also charmed people separated from him but his ego was joy filled and that came out. I don&rsquo;t think he was humble at all he just never let emotions control him.</p>

<p>Saying that, a guy like Lebron certainly is a better human and shit if he keeps playing at a high level may be not better at his peak but equally impressive and I&rsquo;m a Jordan stan.</p>

      <label for="loo5nsh" class="commentText"><p>I agree on Lebron - but he also stands on the shoulders of those before him, as we all do. Jordan honestly was a great role model - now the gambling and drinking was not as widespread among the general public when he was playing, more confined to serious NBA fans or the inner circle.</p>

<p>BUT as a cultural phenomenon he was pretty clean in the public eye, and became a (even if it was designed this way) a great role model for kids specifically regarding trying their best and working hard.</p>

<p>I think Jordan had a genuine humility about certain things though - like I never got the sense that Jordan fully thought he was bigger than the game etc. He always gave a TON of respect to legends and knew his rightful place. Of course he&rsquo;s insanely competitive and that leads to its own stuff but given the pedestal he was on at the time, IMO he could have been much more of an arrogant asshole. I always point to his interviews post the bad boy losses, very composed and mature. But yes as you said lol he&rsquo;s a big charmer.</p>

Michael didn’t until a later point in his career so that he could withstand the physical punishment from the Pistons and Knicks.

You can see in OPs clip that although  his legs run like everyone elses, after he leaves the ground his calves and ankles almost twitch into position, he has an infinite range of motion to choose from too because he&rsquo;s so flexible, to bend an unpredictable angle to float in a shot. He&rsquo;s either an alien level freak with unteachable skills or he practiced his jump game ruthlessly. Whatever he did, he has extremely fast reflexes and unbelievable body awareness, especially in his lower extremities.</p>
