    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>What are some of your favorite instances of teams using certain stats or players in weird/unexpected ways in order to succeed? Some personal choices (and probably some of the more iconic examples):</p>

<ul>
<li>Teams like the Rockets and Warriors choosing to chuck volume threes because they realized it was as effective as shooting two pointers at 55%-65% accuracy</li>
<li>LeBron and Wade committing to driving downhill constantly after their first Heat season instead of choosing to shoot much lower % long range shots</li>
<li>Most of the NBA getting bigs to intentionally foul Shaq because letting him shoot free throws literally made him a less efficient scorer</li>
</ul>

      <label for="lf1osft" class="commentText"><p>That was a straight cheat code against teams that didn&rsquo;t have a great inside game, but not even having a reserve that could play physical in the paint doomed them against LA. iirc they went into the playoffs with only a 38yo Tyson Chandler at center and ran a Jeff Green/Covington/PJ Tucker center rotation. I think you have to at least keep one backup level C even if you plan to play small full-time in most matchups. That was Houston&rsquo;s big mistake</p>

      <label for="lf1ndlq" class="commentText"><p>These ideas don&rsquo;t originate with Mazzulla, but he does incorporate them more than other teams:</p>

<ul>
<li>Going back to post-ups. Yea, they are an inefficient play on the whole, but they aren&rsquo;t inefficient when you get the right player in the right spot against the right opponent. Putting Porzingis in the high post against smaller defenders, putting Tatum in the low post vs. smaller defenders, and putting Jrue in the low post</li>
<li>Having big men shoot above the break 3&rsquo;s and cheat back on defense after the shot. Above the break 3&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t as efficient as corner 3&rsquo;s, but when your big men shoot them and cheat back on defense, this enables you to more frequently have your best paint defender back in transition AND it allows those on the corners to crash the offensive boards. Efficient offensive play that sets up a more efficient transition defense</li>
</ul>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to add a team-building concept that Brad Stevens has used extremely effectively.</p>

<ul>
<li>Signing guys on non-guaranteed multi year deals at the end of the season. Brad Stevens does this at the end of every year. He does this because min deals are pro-rated, so they have a much lower cap hit than a regular min deal. In addition, these players are eligible to be traded in the off-season. In order to dodge the tax one year, Brad had 5 players on pro-rated min deals and they had a COMBINED cap hit of less than one regular vet min deal. 3 of those players were then used as matching salary in the off-season to get Malcolm Brogdon who would later be traded for Jrue Holiday, (the other 2 were Hauser and Kornet). I&rsquo;ve started calling this the &ldquo;Brad Stevens Minimum&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s a concept he uses every year without fail. Nemias Queta is the most recent &ldquo;Brad Stevens Minimum&rdquo;</li>

      <label for="lf1nqes" class="commentText"><p>This probably doesn’t count, but I love some of the things that Paul Westhead (championship coach of the 1980 Lakers) did with his career after he was fired a year later.</p>

<p>Coaching at a mid major in Loyola Marymount in the 80s, he played at a pace and with a three point emphasis that was completely alien at the time. His teams were averaging 23 three point attempts per game back when basically nobody prioritized them at all, and he led them to an elite eight even after their best player died.</p>

<p>He then had a horrendous stint with the Nuggets where he tried to do the same thing and allowed 130 points per game, and fell to the point where he was coaching the Panasonic Super Kangaroos. But, he finished things off with a WNBA title on a team that shot way more threes than any team before it. Really bizarre career overall</p>
