      <label for="lqzfkgl" class="commentText"><p>Honestly no. But don’t blame you for thinking that. Giannis and khris have insanely good chemistry and am pretty sure are the longest tenured duo in the nba behind steph and draymond now. They play off each other incredibly well and khris throws the best alley oops to Gianni’s, which is obviously a big part of his game.</p>

<p>Khris is also severely underrated by most people in his midrange game. He had the best FG% there last year and from high volume. I mean a couple years ago he was a single FT away from being a 50/40/90 player. I’m sentimental towards khris but if you watch every night you know how much he means to Giannis on and off the court.</p>

<p>Having jrue would’ve been nice, but we is just not a 3rd option offensive player which we sorely needed, and I think Celtics fans would agree. Would make that trade again every time. Biggest mistake was hiring AG. Terrible HC</p>

Khris is also insanely clutch in the playoffs, even at the highest level dropping 40 in the finals. PG had been treated unfairly at times, but you just can’t hit the side of the backboard in an elimination game lol. I’d take khris every time</p>

<p>Not to mention his 2021 playoff run where he had ridiculous performances as a nr.1 option</p>

      <label for="lqzwx9e" class="commentText"><p>Tbh though I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d compare them. Khris is a better player to me because while neither PG or Khris are championship quality 1st options Khris has consistently been better at coexisting as #2.</p>

<p>If I had to pick a first option I&rsquo;d take PG, but if I had to take a second option it&rsquo;d br Middleton. And given that I&rsquo;m not really winning shit with either as thag first option imo Middleton is better. In the best case scenario for each player he&rsquo;s been proven to be better for the sake of winning.</p>

      </div>
      <label for="lqzzxnp" class="commentText"><p>But that&rsquo;s very circumstantial. PG is probably a championship level second option with better health. Khris might not be one if other teams were healthier. I don&rsquo;t subscribe to the idea that Khris is consistently the better second option. I think that&rsquo;s confirmation bias.</p>

<p>And Paul George as a first option was able to take the 2021 Suns to 6 games without an appropriate second option. Earlier in his career he led the Pacers to 2 conference finals as well. I think the team around him has to be maybe Boston level good, but between 2016-22 I think PG could win you a chip (rather 21 or 22 where the competition was considerably easier) whereas I don&rsquo;t think Middleton could.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s also contextual, I haven&rsquo;t seen barely any of Middleton as a first option. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;d rather argue talent.</p>

The bucks and the packers both pride themselves on being very family oriented orgs, which you kind of have to do to compete with places like LA, NY, Miami etc lol.

<p>Giannis and khris have insanely good chemistry</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People are missing some of the lineup data on, like, even last year&rsquo;s Khris and Giannis. There were plenty of 12-20 net rating Bucks lineups last year when Khris played. They form an awesome perimeter defensive foundation while Khris also fits with Giannis&rsquo; offensive skillset like a corresponding puzzle piece.</p>

      <label for="lr1zd36" class="commentText"><p>Correct but the same time, Khris is aging and he came from injury. Last season, he was also kinda rusty coming back (as expected). They are in a win now situation. I think Bucks should be conference finals type of team. Especially in the East. Should be them vs Celtics. Well prior to Knicks upgrade this season.</p>

<p>Khris is also severely underrated by most people in his midrange game. He had the best FG% there last year and from high volume. I mean a couple years ago he was a single FT away from being a 50/40/90 player. I’m sentimental towards khris but if you watch every night you know how much he means to Giannis on and off the court.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&rsquo;s such a savvy scorer who can carry a team from game-to-game. Middleton has always been very underrated. I like watching him against the Pacers because his game is just so nice but he is horrifying because he is a master of the old man game.</p>

<p>But &ldquo;a fly ball <em>out of</em> left field&rdquo; makes absolutely no sense whatsoever lol. But it got me wondering the origins of &ldquo;out of left field&rdquo;, and it&rsquo;s unclear.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Marcus Callies, an associate professor of English and philology at the University of Mainz in Germany, wrote that &ldquo;the precise origin is unclear and disputed&rdquo;, referring to Christine Ammer&rsquo;s conclusion in The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms.[13] Callies suggested that the left fielder in baseball might throw the ball to home plate in an effort to get the runner out before he scores, and that the ball, coming from behind the runner out of left field, would surprise the runner.[13]</p>

<p>According to the 2007 Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English, the phrase came from baseball terminology, referring to a play in which the ball is thrown from the area covered by the left fielder to either home plate or first base, surprising the runner. Variations include &ldquo;out in left field&rdquo; and simply &ldquo;left field&rdquo;.[14]</p>

<p>At the site of the University of Illinois Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois, a 2008 plaque marks the site of the former West Side Park, where the Chicago Cubs played from 1893 to 1915. The plaque states that the location of the county hospital and its psychiatric patients just beyond left field is the origin of the phrase &ldquo;way out in left field.&rdquo;[15]</p>

Beal has no chronic injuries like khris does, and at least a portion of those games are shitty wizards teams shutting him down to tank.</p>

Old, banged up Beal put up 16/3/4 on bad efficiency.  For two guys where their playoff performance is all that matters at this stage in their careers that&rsquo;s a pretty remarkable difference.</p>

I too wouldn&rsquo;t wanna to to the Wiz just for fun! Washington hasn&rsquo;t been good for&hellip;.a long damn time. Literally would be going from the rooter to the tooter.</p>

<p>Note: I hate how he said it was a 360 as it wasn&rsquo;t a full circle moment for him. It was more like a 90 degree angle - came outta nowhere</p>

My only gripe is it seems like whenever he talks, he&rsquo;s <em>only</em> talking about the business side. It&rsquo;s almost entirely unemotional when he talks about where he&rsquo;s at, where he was or where he could have ended up. Many different ways to look at Brad and what he gives on the court but I&rsquo;m not sure his attitude is ever going to change to where he will &ldquo;sell out&rdquo; for on court W&rsquo;s.</p>

Also did we forget to mention the current champions are the FUCKING CELTICS? It won&rsquo;t guarentee a series win but if we lose a guy who&rsquo;s known as a celtics killer in the playoffs the Bucks are DEF screwed</p>

<p>This is nothing secrete, btw. This has been known since his 2nd contract. It’s not a clause in his contract, but an understanding he has with the team.</p>
