They both got a million lob dunks against Gobert but now Boston is putting Tatum and Brown on them so they can switch the screen. Either Dallas&rsquo;s role players need to hit their threes or Luka and Kyrie need to have some big scoring games to get their offense going and force Boston to change their defensive strategy.</p>

      <label for="l7lm864" class="commentText"><p>Not enough credit is being given to the Celtics coaching staff for this win.</p>

<p>It’s not even “Dallas’s role players need to hit their 3s”. It’s about which 3s Celtics are conceding. And to whom.</p>

<p>Celtics aren’t giving up easy corner 3s. They’re helping off of players they know aren’t great shooters above the break 3s. Some of the hardest shots for shooters are the ones being given up.</p>

<p>but lets say it wasnt part of the problem. what defensive plays has he made to actually win games that series. or any series. i mean dallas big men have been playing on par with rudy. you cant be dpoy and not make any plays if your such a negative on offense.</p>

<p>ofc kat and ant played bad. but at least they have the ability to win games and and they have. ppl saying kat needs to go but the fact rudys going to be 30min starter next playoffs will hurt the team again&hellip; i mean unless they can muster up the strength to sit him out depending on matchups but he doesnt seem like the type to take that news in stride</p>

<p>Idk if serious is the right word, more that those 2 guys have elite strengths but pretty glaring flaws as well, that get exposed the farther you go into the playoffs.</p>

<p>Both really improve the floor of your team, especially in tandem, but can struggle in the wrong matchup, as we just saw.</p>

      <label for="l7lv6ez" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I was thinking about that during the game. Both Ant and Tatum were forced to defer more and &ldquo;make the right play&rdquo; but Tatum is a bit better at it at this point of his career and also his teammates were rewarding him for it while Ant&rsquo;s weren&rsquo;t, which led to comments about Ant needs to be more assertive and take more shots. I imagine the similar comments would have been made if Boston lost and Tatum was looking to defer like he did rather than force it, even though it&rsquo;s the right play.</p>

They aren&rsquo;t a great above the break shooting team, especially when the shooters they will most likely be relying on are DJJ and Washington.</p>

<p>There are assists to be had, it&rsquo;s just for guys taking shots they aren&rsquo;t typically great at. Plus the freebies that Kyrie missed</p>

<p>This just isn&rsquo;t a style the Mavs have been playing. The lobs aren&rsquo;t there and the corner 3&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t there, but they will be given above the break 3&rsquo;s.</p>

The only one that came off a switched pick and roll was Luka&rsquo;s second assist where Lively slipped out of the screen and got behind Holiday for a dunk</p>

      <label for="l7lgusg" class="commentText"><p>Right, the point is Maxi&rsquo;s injured shoulder seems to have left him unwilling to shoot any threes at all. That changes everything about the offense when he&rsquo;s in the game. He came up huge from three earlier this playoff run so it&rsquo;s not crazy to believe he could&rsquo;ve made a big impact in a game or two given how Boston is defending.</p>

<p>thats why they get the ball and they get to decide who gets it. they get the last shot. they get to shoot 20 times even if theyre off. unless the role players completely sold they gotta take the blame its on kyrie luka they didnt play well. more less liked stars would be called chokers for this</p>

My point was that 2 of our regular outside shooters were giving up open looks, those would not appear on a “potential assists” list. Luka’s “potential assists” were 6, bc his teammates shot 6 times off his passes. But a teammate who chooses not to shoot does not appear as a “potential assist”. (At least from my understanding, maybe I am misinformed)</p>

      <label for="l7lgryt" class="commentText"><p>Playoff basketball really does require extremely smart players, throughout your entire lineup. Defenses have to be locked in for the full 24 seconds, they need to know their assignments, what the current defensive strategy, what they are willing to concede and what they aren&rsquo;t, need to see all the switches that will and won&rsquo;t happen.</p>

<p>Playoffs really are chess matches out there. You can see why years of experience for your role players matters so much (obviously it matters for stars). The weakest player on your defense is going to be relentlessly targeted, so everyone has to know their job.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really a thing of beauty watching basketball at this level. My pea brain only picks up on this stuff when things are at half speed with a voice over explaining it. In real time I miss nearly all of it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I consider myself to be pretty good at being able to analyze a game while watching it. At least as well as you can in the moment.</p>

<p>My advice for you and other people who want to get better at it is to not look really at the ball at the start of a possession, especially in the half court. Look at the matchups first. See if there&rsquo;s any off ball screening happening, check the offenses alignment. Try to think about what the defense wants to do. And when the play actually happens think about what led to the result. Was the defense happy with the shot, make or miss? How did they defend the main action?</p>

<p>Then watch how those things progress in a game, and you&rsquo;ll get to join other people in laughing when people on the radio scream &ldquo;no adjustments!!! Fire the coach!!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>2018-19 - decent first round - completely threw the 2nd round vs Bucks</p>

<p>2019-20 - didn&rsquo;t play, team was injured, he was also eventually</p>

<p>2020-21 - was playing great until the Giannis injury, including a sweep of Boston (they would have won it all that year if that didn&rsquo;t happen</p>

<p>2021-22 - (got swept) Was meh, amazing game 1, bad g2/g3 and mediocre g4 (had a garbage roster tbf and a very poor supporting cast outside of KD and himself)</p>

<p>2022-23 - didn&rsquo;t play</p>

<p>2023-24 - has been amazing in 2 out of the 3 series</p>

<p>KD, Kyrie, Bruce Brown, Seth Curry, Patty Mills, Clax and Drummond.</p>

<p>And also with the insane defensive attention KD was getting even when he didn&rsquo;t have the ball that one is on Kyrie, he needed to be better than 21.3 points on decent effeciency.</p>

<p>They had 3 6&rsquo;1 players on the starting lineup which means a lack of cutting options + 2 players who couldn&rsquo;t shoot.</p>

<p>I mean they double/tripled KD and didn&rsquo;t leave Kyrie ever so it made no difference + the paint was constantly clogged due to Drummond/Clax being on. Its actually impressive they kept every game so close</p>

      <label for="l7m1jok" class="commentText"><p>As someone who&rsquo;s listened to his podcast he outright did not release an episode for close to 2 weeks during the Mavs &amp; Wolves series when the Mavs beat them 4-1. No podcast episodes praising the Mavs for the win. He finally released one the day before the finals which was the finals preview episode.  If you listen to the Youtube video that he finally uploaded on the Mavs it felt very forced if you listen to his tone of voice and the upbeat spark that he usually has is gone when he talked about the Mavs in that one. Even some of the Youtube comments called him out stating, &ldquo;Finally had upload one related to the Mavericks didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>4 of the last 5 videos made by Ben Taylor about the Mavs have only been after loses, which is insane because the Mavs have been the hottest team the last few months. The one video he did make about the Mavs was him just commentating over live play sounding dead af, but he sure perks up and gives it his all when we lose.</p>

<p>Check his podcast episode schedule and notice that he never lets it go past more than a week without releasing an episode but somehow it gets to 15 days when the Wolves &amp; Mavs play. I even checked and he hasn&rsquo;t gone further past 2 weeks since 2021. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s coincidental at all.</p>

<p>He clearly praises Luka&rsquo;s talent as an individual, called him a top 15 offensive player of all time and gives him his props but it&rsquo;s obvious he&rsquo;s not a fan of that heliocentric style.</p>

<li>How the Mavs adjusted in game 2 vs OKC</li>
</ul>

<p>So <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> podcasts are talking about the Mavs and you&rsquo;ve just written an entire essay on how he doesn&rsquo;t talk about them.</p>

<p>That is how he always sounds when he does those watchalongs. <a href="https://youtu.be/cVgYKkVCEdY" target="_blank">Are you going to claim that he hates the Nuggets too?</a> Or <a href="https://youtu.be/96F5WlrEgYQ" target="_blank">What about the Celtics?</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Check his podcast episode schedule and notice that he never lets it go past more than a week without releasing an episode but somehow it gets to 15 days when the Wolves &amp; Mavs play.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was 8 days. 20th of May was the episode about Nuggets Wolves Game 7, the 28th was about the Mavs cooking the Wolves. They are sometimes slow uploading to youtube so if you watch them there that&rsquo;s why.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He clearly praises Luka&rsquo;s talent as an individual, called him a top 15 offensive player of all time and gives him his props <strong>but it&rsquo;s obvious he&rsquo;s not a fan of that heliocentric style.</strong></p>

<p>Anyone who actually watches his content and listens to the podcast knows that that statement is false.</p>

<p>Yep, he clearly hates him. That&rsquo;s why he gave him is own tier in a top 25 under 25 ranking, has consistently put him in the upper echelon of all players in the NBA and believes he is a top 15 offensive player of all time before he&rsquo;s even entered his prime.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what a hater does, right?</p>
