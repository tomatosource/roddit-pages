</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Ryan Dunn on the Suns, Reed Sheppard on the Rockets, Stephon Castle on the Spurs, Dillingham on the Wolves, Risacher on the Hawks, Edey on the Grizzlies, etc. I&rsquo;m looking at these rookies and how theyre so far playing and if most of their play styles translate to the regular season, these rookies could be small yet important pieces that have the ability to change the entire identity of a team for the better. Whether if they&rsquo;re a starter, or coming off the bench and giving that team more depth.</p>

<p>I feel like this rookie class is about to shock some people by how much they could potentially affect a team. Are there any rookies that will look like full-blown stars this season? Probably not. (And I know it&rsquo;s preseason), but we have rookies playing great defense and putting up 15-20 points a night on good efficiency right now against real NBA players. Of course, we have to wait for the regular season to start to see if it all translates, but this has been a super promising rookie class so far.  I don&rsquo;t remember so many rookies last year giving these kinds of performances in the preseason every other night. It was mostly just 2 or 3 rookies last year that looked super promising at this time during the preseason.</p>

<p>The entire gripe in this draft was that a) there were no elite level prospects and b) there was a ton of uncertainty at the top. Nobody ever denied that a few players would pan out, the difficulty was figuring out which ones. 7-8 had just as good odds of success as 1-2 in this draft, and that made it a shitty draft.</p>

<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s the way it came off, but wasn&rsquo;t trying to. I was just saying if what we&rsquo;re seeing from preseason translates (and it could or could not), then the draft would likely surprise people. 2020 was supposed to be a shit draft too</p>

<p>But I get it. You see something like I did in 2020. Where I saw a lot of high level role players. Here in 2024 I kinda see it, but the prospects are further. They feel like they got more holes or flaws than the 2020 prospects. Where it&rsquo;s hard to predict which ones will develop. Hence me calling it a crap shoot. Where the 28th pick(Dunn) has as good a chance to develop into something substantial the same as the 5th pick(Holland) despite similar profiles and massive gap in draft spots.</p>

If Dunn can carve a Iguodala role for the suns that might help them come playoff time, Memphis is such a good developmental team so Edey will probably be good there, Ware with Miami could be a gem, etc.</p>

      <label for="lry8rw6" class="commentText"><p>Itâ€™s a draft full of role players and no stars (at least no obvious ones).   Like I think Castle will be good after a couple years like a starter or 6th man on a playoff team (kind of what like Nembhard is for the Pacers)â€¦which is usually a great draft pick but at 3 youâ€™re usually getting a quickly to become star player.</p>

<p>The media thrives on hype and clicks so they hate this draft.  Thereâ€™s no top guys who (at least very unlikely) become generational stars but there was so much quality depth that even teams drafting in mid 2nd round are getting guys ready to contribute.</p>

But I don&rsquo;t disagree with your overall assessment that there&rsquo;s a whole lot of guys who are going to be contributors in this year&rsquo;s draft, like actually quite a few, but that you have to really dig deep to find the makings of a potential star player (again, I really think Castle can be)</p>
