<p>Historically Carlisle offenses are not like that at all so it’s cool to see him adapt his coaching style to both the way the league is evolving and to match his personnel</p>

I’m telling you other than watching Frank Layden back in the day (where my old heads at) I’ve never seen a coach have as much fun coaching a group of guys as Rick has the last 2 years.  Also never seen Rick so relaxed.  Great coaches adapt to the current game and Rick has not only adapted to it, he has down right fully embraced it.</p>

<p>Brown especially is underappreciated by some fans because he never really had to step out of Tatum&rsquo;s shadow. I&rsquo;d take him over Kyrie right now, but because Kyrie has been a star elsewhere and is now playing second fiddle people look at the Mavs as a two superstar team and the Celtics as a one star team. If Brown had balled out on the Wizards and then moved to the Celtics in year 4 we&rsquo;d look at him a lot differently imo.</p>

<p>And often it is the top players who can sway a series, but you can’t completely omit depth. Phoenix having no real PG, a non-dominant Center, and no great 2-way wings (Durant isn’t the same guy defensively), it just wasn’t a recipe for success. A classic failed superteam model.</p>

<p>Every successful super team has had a great 2-way player (Garnett for Boston, LeBron for Miami and Cleveland, Durant for GS) and Phoenix just doesn’t have that.</p>

      <label for="lmg4hyt" class="commentText"><p>Even if you look at the most recent dynasty I think this is apparent - the finals Warriors from 15 and 16 had a really well-rounded rotation of players, and would&rsquo;ve made deep runs every year even if they didn&rsquo;t sacrifice a lot of that depth for Durant.</p>

<p>And then even after they <em>did</em> get Durant, once their depth started to leech away you could see the cracks forming; they were a historic collapse away from losing against a less &lsquo;talented&rsquo; (but obviously incredible) Rockets team in 18, dropped games in 19, and I clearly remember realising that the 538 model favoured the Raptors <em>even if Durant was to return</em>; that&rsquo;s not to say that <em>in reality</em> the Raptors were better than a full-strength Warriors team (and the 538 team did constantly talk about places where they disagreed with the output of the model, even though in general it was pretty good) - because the Raptors had an incredible, well-rounded <em>team</em> and by that point the Warriors had an insanely talented top few guys and some very thin support.</p>

<p>It does seem like we&rsquo;ve been becoming more and more aware of how much modern defence is a team thing and you&rsquo;re moreso only as strong as your weak links rather than vice versa, but offence being more of a team game these days isn&rsquo;t so much of a talking point despite the focus on pace-and-space.</p>

      <label for="lmg8hlz" class="commentText"><p>Any team with Porzingis on it needs to be built to survive without him.  He has proven to be one of the most injury-prone and unreliable players in the NBA.  His body has never shown it can come close to holding up to the demand of a 20+ game playoff run, so banking all your successes on that happening is almost always going to be a losing strategy.</p>

<p>As a Celtics fan I look at Porzingis as a bonus.  He basically takes the team from &ldquo;great&rdquo; to &ldquo;unbeatable&rdquo;.  But it&rsquo;s virtually a guarantee he is going to miss / be injured for big important playoff games again this year and they need to be able to win without him.</p>

<p>They are probably my bet to finish with the #1 offense this year, and they remind me of the SSOL Suns.</p>

Pacers can correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong but the roster has guys more geared towards offense than 2 way guys. I think there&rsquo;s room for the roster to grow since they&rsquo;re so young and they have the size to potentially be good on the defensive end. </p>

Like, the only player that comes even close to his playmaking load is Diaw, whereas McConnel &amp; Nembhard were able to step up sufficiently for Hali. It&rsquo;s interesting how modern skill profusion has taken all the excellent extra passing of the SSOL teams &amp; turned it into a similar team with 3 guys capable of averaging 12+ assists per 100 on an elite offense which <em>also</em> has high level connective &amp; play finishing type guys.

Experience won out in the end because the pacers panicked and Carlisle shut his brain off. With better late game execution I seriously think that series goes to 6 or 7</p>

<p>The pacers are the perfect counter to Boston because they play so fast and everyone can shoot. Even turner is a legit shooter and not just a corner merchant</p>

      <label for="lmg7w3v" class="commentText"><p>Yeah we&rsquo;ve been saying the same thing for months, but fans from other teams just thought we were trying to hype up our own title run in an admittedly weak year.</p>

<p>The Pacers were the only team that didn&rsquo;t take a game off us but they were also the only team to play us tough all series long. The other teams we faced really only showed up for 1 game and then hung their &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t get swept&rdquo; banners.</p>

<p>Average margin of victory in wins:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>MIA - 22.0</p></li>

<li><p>CLE - 15.0</p></li>

<li><p>IND - 6.8</p></li>

<li><p>DAL - 12.5</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It was interesting to watch. People were so committed to shitting on Indiana as a means of discrediting Boston&rsquo;s title aspirations but then they all hyped up Dallas with a majority of fans picking the Mavericks to win. Indiana ended up being a lot tougher for us to handle, it was probably the only series where we were forced to shorten our rotations (Hauser struggled against their pace) and at times dig into the deep bench (shout out that 1 good Brissett game).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d go further and say the &lsquo;bloodbath&rsquo; West ended up being a little overrated this year with the slow decline of LeBron/Curry/Durant, meaning it&rsquo;s now a conference dominated by teams without much experience.</p>

<p>When you actually break down the Western Conference:</p>

<ol>
<li>OKC - Never won a playoff series before 2024</li>
<li>DEN</li>
<li>MIN - Never won a playoff series before 2024</li>
<li>LAC - Led by a star(s) in their mid-30s</li>
<li>DAL</li>
<li>PHO - Led by a star(s) in their mid-30s</li>
<li>NOP - Never won a playoff series before 2024</li>
<li>LAL - Led by a star(s) in their mid-30s</li>
<li>SAC - Never won a playoff series before 2024</li>
<li>GSW - Led by a star(s) in their mid-30s</li>
</ol>

<p>Add in Denver never having beaten a +50 win team in the Jokic era and Dallas is the only team remaining.</p>

<p>That offense isn&rsquo;t going anywhere and their defensive rating improved by 3.6 points per 100 possessions after the All-Star break.</p>

<p>They struggled in moments in the playoffs when they shouldn&rsquo;t have, but a lot of that was a lack of experience and not a lack of talent imo.</p>

      <label for="lmg9mzn" class="commentText"><p>Yeah it will be interesting to see.</p>

<p>Milwaukee earned a lot of respect from Boston fans in 2018. Milwaukee lost in the first round so no one really took that team seriously but they probably started their breakout in their series against us and then they went on to win 60 games the next season.</p>

<p>Atlanta was similar last year. Despite losing in the 1st round, they earned a lot of respect last year and it looked like they were bouncing back to their 2020 form&hellip; but then they didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>But I agree with you, I think Indiana should be seen as a top team next year as well.</p>

Indiana has a good chance of being the #1 seed in the East next year, and I definitely see them being a top 3 seed.

<p>Sixers I don&rsquo;t see higher than a 4 seed. I bet they conserve their guys and give them a lot of rest time to make sure everyone is healthy for the playoffs. Bucks could see in a similar boat. Floating around the 4 seed and not pushing Dame/Giannis to go full balls to the walls every night</p>

<p>In the playoffs, Nesmith showed some real defensive abilities, Nembhard looked serviceable, and Haliburton didn&rsquo;t look like an entire cone. They looked better imo than they did at the start of last season, which is where the &ldquo;no defense&rdquo; narrative came from</p>

<p>Provisionally, and strictly from a regular season perspective, I have Celtics, Knicks, and Pacers as Top 3, because I feel the best about their age profile, collective team fit and identity, their depth, and their health.</p>

      <label for="lmg54d3" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not gonna lie to you, at this point, I think Indy might be flat out better. Indy has a lot of really underrated players, have a deep bench, and don&rsquo;t have the fit issues Cleveland has.</p>

<p>I was really high on Cleveland going into last season, but after watching them this year, it doesn&rsquo;t look great. They have 4 star level players, but fit wise, it seems like it would be best to really only have 2 of those  4 at a time</p>

      <label for="lmg5lnl" class="commentText"><p>Cleveland won 48 games despite Donovan missing 27 games and Garland breaking his jaw midseason. People are not giving Cleveland nearly enough credit because they were so good with so many injuries that people don&rsquo;t even acknowledge how injured they were.</p>

<p>If I was betting on it I&rsquo;d probably lean Indy, but not by much.</p>

      <label for="lmg63m8" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t disagree that they were injured.</p>

<p>But their best stretch of the season was with Mitchell and Allen playing, and Garland and Mobley out hurt. In the playoffs, Mobley looked much better not playing alongside Allen. When all 4 were healthy (or as healthy as they were), it didn&rsquo;t look convincing.</p>

<p>I think there is fit issues. Their 2 bigs and 2 guards don&rsquo;t seem to play well together, like Trae and Murray in Atlanta. I don&rsquo;t see Kenny A fixing that, but we&rsquo;ll see.</p>

      <label for="lmg9pul" class="commentText"><p>There was also a coaching issue that everyone in this thread is annoying. Bickerstaff has no idea how to coach an offense, his whole M.O. was defense/“scrapping”. That’s why we had to be “Mitchell merchants”, because that’s what his lack of offensive creativity called for. With Atkinson, I think our offense will look a whole lot better. Off ball guard play will improve, and he’ll actually get Mobley touches to develop, which JB didn’t do, because half of the time he was coaching for his job. Time will tell, but JB is a third-rate coach and had no qualifications to coach a team that talented. Atkinson does.</p>

      <label for="lmg73fy" class="commentText"><p>Pacers also played down to their their opponents a lot this past year.  I&rsquo;m not sure we will be a dominant team in the regular season.  But we will be a team that will cause problems for other teams just because they play at a faster speed than most teams.  Could be dangerous with the right matchups in the playoffs.  It&rsquo;s just fun to be relevant again.</p>

      <label for="lmg456s" class="commentText"><p>He dominated like quarter and half. Which we absolutely benefited from, it was gutsy and incredible. But simply saying we “had Porzingis” is misleading, is my point. Also watching him get back in transition after tweaking the injury was like watching a snail try to do so. I’m glad he played and contributed but he was not himself and I don’t think what he gave us invalidates what Mazzulla said. I should say he gave us something like 2+ quarters across five games of his actual self to be more accurate.</p>

      <label for="lmg3pa0" class="commentText"><p>It was a great like two quarters of him playing at his best, absolutely amazing, and he deserves credit for it. It matters, sure. He also missed two games entirely, was close to a non-factor in another but saw the court just as a courtesy to him for his contributions this season, and really only mattered for half <em>at best</em> of the two games he put up actual numbers/minutes. The second of those games he clearly was moving like he was in molasses for part of it before having to leave entirely. I don’t think it’s enough to change “the Packers played us hardest”.</p>

<p>And to be clear, I think the Mavs are obviously better than the Pacers lol. Just how the games played out.</p>

Fun cohesive team, love siakam, and their role players are great too. Respect&hellip;but fuck Hali and Indy&hellip;respectfully. Haliburton does seem like a great teammate and fun to play with, but for right now? I hate him.</p>

      <label for="lmg632c" class="commentText"><p>I keep saying it and plenty of people act like I&rsquo;m nuts, but if the Pacers had beaten us they would&rsquo;ve absolutely dominated Dallas as well. The Pacers offense is incredible, and they&rsquo;re decent enough on defense that if they get a few stops they&rsquo;ll be up by 10-20 in no time flat. With their pacing they would&rsquo;ve run the Mavs off the floor. Yes, Luka would&rsquo;ve still gotten his, but with how the rest of the Mavs were playing, including Kyrie, those games would&rsquo;ve all ended up like 120-100 in favor of the Pacers.</p>

<p>Not all sweeps are the same. We let Dallas get one so we could win at home. We swept Indiana and it was the most stressful series of the postseason for us. No way that series was supposed to be a sweep even after Hali went down.</p>

      <label for="lmg12qg" class="commentText"><p>Remember how much Lakers fans got clowned for this sentiment after the Nuggets series?</p>

<p>Anyways, I still would have much preferred to see the Celtics play a healthy Knicks team for that series instead. I like Hali and Siakam but I just think the Knicks would have given them a better series. Oh well, maybe this year</p>

<p>It’s also why I think the rush to anoint Boston as an all-time great team was so silly. They looked vulnerable against the 47-win Pacers and never faced a &amp;gt;50 win team in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="lmfy6ch" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not even a Boston fan but this is a destitute take. They&rsquo;re frauds for playing the teams that their seeding matched them up against? They&rsquo;re frauds for winning the finals against the team that won the west? Maybe next year they should just play a series against every team instead of bothering with the playoffs. </p>

      <label for="lmfxtm9" class="commentText"><p>Such a primitive way of looking at things. You obsess over 1 player as opposed to looking at the entire team. Last I checked basketball was a team sport.</p>

<p>I got a newsflash for you buddy, the current Indiana Pacers are a much better, deeper team than either your precious Lakers or Warriors.</p>

<p>What these fools don&rsquo;t understand is when a team makes fucking <em>52%</em> of their 2s outside the restricted area&hellip; that&rsquo;s like, not normal. Fucking Nembhard man, what a baller.</p>

      <label for="lmfz975" class="commentText"><p>Yeah but it&rsquo;s more about the fact Jimmy Butler, Terry Rozier, Donovan Mitchell, Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen, and Tyrese Halliburton all suffered injuries and were therefore out against the Celtics, not to mention guys like Giannis, Dame, Embiid, Brunson, OG Anunoby, Mitchell Robinson and Julius Randle were also out.</p>

      <label for="lmg12ge" class="commentText"><p>Well guess what, you can do the exact same thing for the 2021 Bucks, the 2019 Raptors, the 2015 Warriors etc. Luck is absolutely a factor in who wins the title.</p>

<p>Like honestly, who gives a fuck? You play whose put in front of you and I fail to see how it&rsquo;s the Celtics problem that other teams&rsquo; players weren&rsquo;t healthy. Not like they themselves were healthy either, Porzingis played in 4 games.</p>

<p>OP is mad that we didn&rsquo;t have to beat a singular OG force like LeBron or Steph, but we beat Luka, whose a better player at this point in time anyways.</p>
