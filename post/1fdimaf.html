<p>Historically Carlisle offenses are not like that at all so it’s cool to see him adapt his coaching style to both the way the league is evolving and to match his personnel</p>

I’m telling you other than watching Frank Layden back in the day (where my old heads at) I’ve never seen a coach have as much fun coaching a group of guys as Rick has the last 2 years.  Also never seen Rick so relaxed.  Great coaches adapt to the current game and Rick has not only adapted to it, he has down right fully embraced it.</p>

      <label for="lmh5xgw" class="commentText"><p>One of the really important and cool things is that Rick, despite his usual controlling style of coaching, has essentially given over the offense to Tyrese. He’s implemented a few concepts but Rese is the one who makes most of the calls and dictates what we’re doing or aiming for on that end. There’s been a few interviews about it but it’s basically free form intuition based basketball that starts with Rese and trickles down.</p>

<p>I’m not saying he’s the best player or anything like that. But this historic offense is a lot more about Ty than Carlisle</p>

      <label for="lmg9w9x" class="commentText"><p>The thing with the Pacers is that they aren&rsquo;t trying to force shot creating to go to a specific place. They take so many mid-range shots, and have such an easy trigger to get shots up, its not very efficient on a per-attempt basis but they get such a high volume and their success is almost independent of the defense. Most teams try to get 1 or 2 types of high efficiency shots, and if you can prevent those looks, they end up with a hope-and-pray shot or a clock violation. But the Pacers just let everyone shoot wherever.</p>

      <label for="lmg6fne" class="commentText"><p>Tatum and Brown are superstars! They&rsquo;ve been playing together so long they have incredible chemistry, which is what so many superstar-laden teams lack.</p>

<p>Brown especially is underappreciated by some fans because he never really had to step out of Tatum&rsquo;s shadow. I&rsquo;d take him over Kyrie right now, but because Kyrie has been a star elsewhere and is now playing second fiddle people look at the Mavs as a two superstar team and the Celtics as a one star team. If Brown had balled out on the Wizards and then moved to the Celtics in year 4 we&rsquo;d look at him a lot differently imo.</p>

      <label for="lmg9gve" class="commentText"><p>I was a little surprised they didn’t win a single game after winning 3 against the Wolves in the regular season</p>

<p>And often it is the top players who can sway a series, but you can’t completely omit depth. Phoenix having no real PG, a non-dominant Center, and no great 2-way wings (Durant isn’t the same guy defensively), it just wasn’t a recipe for success. A classic failed superteam model.</p>

<p>Every successful super team has had a great 2-way player (Garnett for Boston, LeBron for Miami and Cleveland, Durant for GS) and Phoenix just doesn’t have that.</p>

      <label for="lmga63k" class="commentText"><p>People also truly underestimate chemistry and players who know what their roles are and play them well. The Pacers have lots of great role players who know their roles especially on offense and their team has good chemistry. Knicks too. When players truly buy in, it helps the team tremendously. Phoenix never really seemed to have their guys buy in (like Beal) and their role players never stepped up. With Indy, the guys know they will have a chance to touch the ball on offense if they move around.</p>

      <label for="lmgayhj" class="commentText"><p>Talent depth matters so much. Part of what made the Cs so dangerous isn’t just that the starting 5 can shoot, it’s that anyone can make a play with the ball in their hands. It means any overreaction to any play, any slight out of position, can be punished by anyone. Smart, team basketball with at least solid scorers and playmakers at every position is so much more dangerous than people think</p>

      <label for="lmg4hyt" class="commentText"><p>Even if you look at the most recent dynasty I think this is apparent - the finals Warriors from 15 and 16 had a really well-rounded rotation of players, and would&rsquo;ve made deep runs every year even if they didn&rsquo;t sacrifice a lot of that depth for Durant.</p>

<p>And then even after they <em>did</em> get Durant, once their depth started to leech away you could see the cracks forming; they were a historic collapse away from losing against a less &lsquo;talented&rsquo; (but obviously incredible) Rockets team in 18, dropped games in 19, and I clearly remember realising that the 538 model favoured the Raptors <em>even if Durant was to return</em>; that&rsquo;s not to say that <em>in reality</em> the Raptors were better than a full-strength Warriors team (and the 538 team did constantly talk about places where they disagreed with the output of the model, even though in general it was pretty good) - because the Raptors had an incredible, well-rounded <em>team</em> and by that point the Warriors had an insanely talented top few guys and some very thin support.</p>

<p>It does seem like we&rsquo;ve been becoming more and more aware of how much modern defence is a team thing and you&rsquo;re moreso only as strong as your weak links rather than vice versa, but offence being more of a team game these days isn&rsquo;t so much of a talking point despite the focus on pace-and-space.</p>

      <label for="lmgdeze" class="commentText"><p>I think the &ldquo;big 3&rdquo; or &ldquo;superstar era&rdquo; was always overblown a bit.  Tons of teams have assembled 2-3 superstars and won nothing.  All the teams that actually win titles tend to have high quality role players and strong depth.</p>

<p>Pretty much every season, without fail, you can look to the 8-man rotation as more indicative of championship odds than the Top 3.  That&rsquo;s why I think teams like the Suns, Sixers, and at this point the Nuggets are more pretenders that legit shots, no matter how good the top of their rosters are.</p>

      <label for="lmg8hlz" class="commentText"><p>Any team with Porzingis on it needs to be built to survive without him.  He has proven to be one of the most injury-prone and unreliable players in the NBA.  His body has never shown it can come close to holding up to the demand of a 20+ game playoff run, so banking all your successes on that happening is almost always going to be a losing strategy.</p>

<p>As a Celtics fan I look at Porzingis as a bonus.  He basically takes the team from &ldquo;great&rdquo; to &ldquo;unbeatable&rdquo;.  But it&rsquo;s virtually a guarantee he is going to miss / be injured for big important playoff games again this year and they need to be able to win without him.</p>

      <label for="lmfut01" class="commentText"><p>Indiana&rsquo;s depth of offensive talent, pace of play, and free flowing style where they don&rsquo;t run plays is so difficult to guard.</p>

<p>Of all the teams we played this past year, they were the one who we just never figured out how to slow down offensively.</p>

<p>They are probably my bet to finish with the #1 offense this year, and they remind me of the SSOL Suns.</p>

      <label for="lmg6cuf" class="commentText"><p>Eh the <sup>2019</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> raps went pretty hard into transition and also had a top defense. It&rsquo;s a personnel and scheme thing. Pacers can correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong but the roster has guys more geared towards offense than 2 way guys. I think there&rsquo;s room for the roster to grow since they&rsquo;re so young and they have the size to potentially be good on the defensive end. </p>

      <label for="lmgdfv9" class="commentText"><p>Siakam, Nesmith, and Nemhard are all solid defenders on and off ball. Haliburton has size even if he isn&rsquo;t great defensively. Turner has lost a half step but is still a good rim protector and fairly mobile big. I think their defense is better next year and their offense should be top 3.</p>

<p>Biggest questions are the two most recent lottery picks. Will either pop in year two or three? That will determine ceiling I think.</p>

Like, the only player that comes even close to his playmaking load is Diaw, whereas McConnel &amp; Nembhard were able to step up sufficiently for Hali. It&rsquo;s interesting how modern skill profusion has taken all the excellent extra passing of the SSOL teams &amp; turned it into a similar team with 3 guys capable of averaging 12+ assists per 100 on an elite offense which <em>also</em> has high level connective &amp; play finishing type guys. It&rsquo;s Showtime Lakers esque</p>

      <label for="lmg8lsp" class="commentText"><p>The only worry for you guys is that other teams now have a year of film to watch and plan for.  Not saying these are the same at all, because I think your offense is better than ours from &lsquo;21, but the Hawks had that insane run second half of &lsquo;21 and into the playoffs where we looked like a really good team.  Then the blueprint was created on how to stop our high PnR and other actions with Trae ball handling and we crumpled.</p>

Experience won out in the end because the pacers panicked and Carlisle shut his brain off. With better late game execution I seriously think that series goes to 6 or 7</p>

<p>The pacers are the perfect counter to Boston because they play so fast and everyone can shoot. Even turner is a legit shooter and not just a corner merchant</p>

<p>It would be different, but I&rsquo;m not sure it plays out any better.  Nembhard gave the Pacers every little bit of what Haliburton would have give them, and he&rsquo;s simply not getting those touches with a healthy Hali.</p>

<p>Mazzulla is saying it because it was actually true - the Pacers <em>were</em> the second best team in the playoffs last season.  They looked like it and they played like it.  They&rsquo;re much more dangerous this year than anybody seems to be giving them credit for IMO.</p>

<p>That offense isn&rsquo;t going anywhere and their defensive rating improved by 3.6 points per 100 possessions after the All-Star break.</p>

<p>They struggled in moments in the playoffs when they shouldn&rsquo;t have, but a lot of that was a lack of experience and not a lack of talent imo.</p>

<p>Milwaukee earned a lot of respect from Boston fans in 2018. Milwaukee lost in the first round so no one really took that team seriously but they probably started their breakout in their series against us and then they went on to win 60 games the next season.</p>

<p>Atlanta was similar last year. Despite losing in the 1st round, they earned a lot of respect last year and it looked like they were bouncing back to their 2020 form&hellip; but then they didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>But I agree with you, I think Indiana should be seen as a top team next year as well.</p>

      <label for="lmg7w3v" class="commentText"><p>Yeah we&rsquo;ve been saying the same thing for months, but fans from other teams just thought we were trying to hype up our own title run in an admittedly weak year.</p>

<p>The Pacers were the only team that didn&rsquo;t take a game off us but they were also the only team to play us tough all series long. The other teams we faced really only showed up for 1 game and then hung their &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t get swept&rdquo; banners.</p>

<p>Average margin of victory in wins:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>MIA - 22.0</p></li>

<li><p>CLE - 15.0</p></li>

<li><p>IND - 6.8</p></li>

<li><p>DAL - 12.5</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It was interesting to watch. People were so committed to shitting on Indiana as a means of discrediting Boston&rsquo;s title aspirations but then they all hyped up Dallas with a majority of fans picking the Mavericks to win. Indiana ended up being a lot tougher for us to handle, it was probably the only series where we were forced to shorten our rotations (Hauser struggled against their pace) and at times dig into the deep bench (shout out that 1 good Brissett game).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d go further and say the &lsquo;bloodbath&rsquo; West ended up being a little overrated this year with the slow decline of LeBron/Curry/Durant, meaning it&rsquo;s now a conference dominated by teams without much experience.</p>

<p>When you actually break down the Western Conference:</p>

<ol>
<li>OKC - Never won a playoff series before 2024</li>
<li>DEN</li>
<li>MIN - Never won a playoff series before 2024</li>
<li>LAC - Led by a star(s) in their mid-30s</li>
<li>DAL</li>
<li>PHO - Led by a star(s) in their mid-30s</li>
<li>NOP - Never won a playoff series before 2024</li>
<li>LAL - Led by a star(s) in their mid-30s</li>
<li>SAC - Never won a playoff series before 2024</li>
<li>GSW - Led by a star(s) in their mid-30s</li>
</ol>

<p>Add in Denver never having beaten a +50 win team in the Jokic era and Dallas is the only team remaining.</p>

<p>I think they had a very real chance of winning against Mavs if they got there too.</p>

<p>That level of pace and switching is even greater than the Celtics and we exhausted Luka completely. Only question would be if Kyrie falters the same way against them that he did with us.</p>

Indiana has a good chance of being the #1 seed in the East next year, and I definitely see them being a top 3 seed. They are gonna take the regular season more seriously than the other East contenders, and have a surprisingly great year like last year&rsquo;s Twolves or the 2019 Bucks.</p>

<p>Sixers I don&rsquo;t see higher than a 4 seed. I bet they conserve their guys and give them a lot of rest time to make sure everyone is healthy for the playoffs. Bucks could see in a similar boat. Floating around the 4 seed and not pushing Dame/Giannis to go full balls to the walls every night</p>

Celtics are clearly the #1, behind them will be a bloodbath. Orlando can’t be ignored either. Seeds 2-7 can truly be any order and I don’t think many would be surprised with any order.</p>

      <label for="lmg632c" class="commentText"><p>I keep saying it and plenty of people act like I&rsquo;m nuts, but if the Pacers had beaten us they would&rsquo;ve absolutely dominated Dallas as well. The Pacers offense is incredible, and they&rsquo;re decent enough on defense that if they get a few stops they&rsquo;ll be up by 10-20 in no time flat. With their pacing they would&rsquo;ve run the Mavs off the floor. Yes, Luka would&rsquo;ve still gotten his, but with how the rest of the Mavs were playing, including Kyrie, those games would&rsquo;ve all ended up like 120-100 in favor of the Pacers.</p>

<p>Not all sweeps are the same. We let Dallas get one so we could win at home. We swept Indiana and it was the most stressful series of the postseason for us. No way that series was supposed to be a sweep even after Hali went down.</p>

<p>Eta: They would&rsquo;ve dominated. They played them twice in the regular season, once in February and once in March. They beat them by 17, then 20+. Luka had 39 and 33, Kyrie had 20 and 29. They would&rsquo;ve run them off the floor just like they HAD been running them off the floor.</p>

<p>The Pacers were a couple of calls and plays from taking us 7, or just sweeping us even without Hali. They absolutely were the best team we played in the postseason. Just because Mavs fans don&rsquo;t want to accept that they would&rsquo;ve gotten blown away either way isn&rsquo;t my problem. It&rsquo;s just facts.</p>

      <label for="lmhsjm8" class="commentText"><p>no way the Pacers would dominate them. Maybe a close series but Boston was a terrible match up for the Mavs and it was never going to be that close. Everyone on the Mavs was playing lights out until they met Boston and then the role players started shitting to bed. I don&rsquo;t believe the moment would&rsquo;ve been too big for them had they been facing the Pacers vs the best team in the league. Kyrie absolutely plays better as well.</p>

<p>I hate indiana right now because im historically a bucks fan and also root for the knicks on the side (not die hard, just love basketball) but as a basketball fan i really do enjoy the Pacers brand of bball. Fun cohesive team, love siakam, and their role players are great too. Respect&hellip;but fuck Hali and Indy&hellip;respectfully. Haliburton does seem like a great teammate and fun to play with, but for right now? I hate him.</p>
