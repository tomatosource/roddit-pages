</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>With the NBA officially starting tomorrow, I&rsquo;d like to showcase how the lottery picks of the 2024 draft class performed during the preseason. It&rsquo;s a small sample size but I think it&rsquo;d be cool to see anyway. I&rsquo;m just including PPG/RPG/APG and shooting splits along with MPG and games played. Not including fouls or turnovers since I don&rsquo;t think those things are that important when looking at rookies.</p>

<p>#1) Zaccharie Risacher: 16.0/5.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.5 on <sup>60</sup>&frasl;<sub>44</sub>.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>66</sub>.7 shooting splits in 22.9 mpg (2 games played)</p>

<p>#3) Reed Sheppard: 6.5/3/2.5 on 44/18/0 shooting splits in 21.3 mpg (4 games played)</p>

<p>#4) Stephon Castle: <sup>11</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>.6 on 44.7/25/70.8 shooting splits in 21.1 mpg (5 games played)</p>

<p>#12) Nikola Topic (didn&rsquo;t play due to injury)</p>

<p>#13) Devin Carter (didn&rsquo;t play due to injury)</p>

<p>#14) Bub Carrington: 7.<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.4 on <sup>35</sup>&frasl;<sub>28</sub>.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>71</sub>.4 shooting splits in 22.1 mpg (5 games played)</p>

<p>Some things that stood out to me:</p>

<p>Sarr looks much better now than he did during summer league. So many people were already calling him a bust after he went 0/15. His ball handling and finishing at the rim is still rough but he is a great defender.</p>

<p>Salaun is MPJ lite. That&rsquo;s it</p>

<p>Risacher is a better ball handler than I thought he would be. I always viewed him as someone who is gonna be working off ball 99% of the time but he&rsquo;s actually not bad.</p>

<p>Holland and Buzelis were what I thought they would be. Ball handling forwards who can&rsquo;t shoot. Holland has the dawg in him tho.</p>

<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t know if I have seen a single Cody Williams highlight during the preseason. He&rsquo;s been damn near invisible.</p>

<p>Castle will be the best player in this class. His ball handling, his passing ability, his willingness to drive and take contact, and his defense are crazy for a rookie. Truly Jimmy Butler-esque. If that 3 ball improves it will be scary times.</p>

      <label for="lt0pprj" class="commentText"><p>Cody did have a 17 point game. I don&rsquo;t expect Cody to average over 7 points his rookie year, as he was drafted as a project. If he gains weight, learns to shoot above average, and improves his ball handle, he has All Star potential as his ceiling. Because he has a jumpshot, and has good athleticism</p>

      <label for="lt0vtif" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s going to be absolutely fine as a shooter, but as a smaller player, who&rsquo;s coming into the league with a reputation as a knockdown sniper, he&rsquo;s going to be facing a level of defensive intensity, and size and athleticism, that could cause him to go through a bit of an adjustment Due to his mediocre physical measurables</p>

<p>His stroke is clean as hell. He&rsquo;ll be fine in the end. But I wouldn&rsquo;t be super shocked if his three-point shooting was rough for the first half of the year while he adjusts to getting looks off against just bigger and more athletic players</p>

      <label for="lt1ap7z" class="commentText"><p>He went 2 for 11, which is an extremely small sample size. Every make or miss is 9 percent. I would wait for like at least a 40 game regular season sample of 100 plus three point attempts before making any conclusion. Even then, I would still say it takes at least 2-3 years (perhaps more if you are in a situation like Jermaine O’Neal) to really decide if the pick is good or not. </p>

      <label for="lt15wfc" class="commentText"><p>Risacher has unsurprisingly been the best player so far from the class. Castle reaffirmed that he was going to be an absolute dawg. My biggest surprise is how good Salaun looks, he needs to finish better at the rim and build his body better but his shooting is nuts and is a very solid rebounder, very good pickup by Charlotte so far.</p>

      <label for="lt0r8nu" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think grouping Buzelis and Holland together as forwards who can&rsquo;t shoot is fair. Holland&rsquo;s shooting is far behind and he shot 11% on mostly spot-up wide open threes. Buzelis was taking multiple pull-ups and side-step threes against tight perimeter defense.</p>

<p>Buzelis absolutely has to improve his efficiency but he&rsquo;s a LOT closer to being a serviceable shooter than Holland, even tho I love Ron&rsquo;s motor and rim pressure and I had him as a top 5 prospect</p>

      <label for="lt0uzl0" class="commentText"><p>Damn Castle looked really good for the Spurs. I think he is going to be such a good fit with Vic. Was one of the best players on the floor for them on both ends even when shots didn&rsquo;t fall. He stabilized every rotation and lineup he played with. Gets to the rim any time he wants, stupidly mature and intelligent already. I can see little weird bits of butler, sga, and holidays games in the raw outline of what he could become. (Not saying he will be as good as any of those guys just that he has a unique game)</p>

<p>Sarr is going to be such an amazing defensive player. I&rsquo;m waiting to see with the offense but iv never doubted the defense at any point and nothing in pre season has changed that.</p>

<p>Salune looked way more calm and not out of control in preseason then I had seen him most of the time in France. If the mental and processing part of the game clicks to match his energy and size watch out</p>

<p>Zacch looked as expected. Smoothe, intelligent, knows where to be and what to do on both ends. Just going to be a super solid pro and good starter at worst even if the shot making and self creation never comes along.</p>

<p>This year&rsquo;s draft may not end up with a super star but a lot of these guys are going to make impacts way faster then people thought. Iv always loved the depth and quality of this draft when looking beyond &ldquo;finding a star&rdquo;.</p>
