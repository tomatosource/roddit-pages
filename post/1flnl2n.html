</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Before anybody hits me with the inevitable accusation that I&rsquo;m a grandpa who has just discovered the internet, I was born in the 1990s.</p>

<p>Here is a partial list of notable players that Russell had to get through to win his 11 rings:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Wilt Chamberlain - an all-time great, an MVP candidate even in his last season in <strong>1973</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Jerry West - another all-time great, still an All-Star caliber player in his last season in <strong>1974</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Elgin Baylor - same as above, still an All-Star in his last full season in <strong>1970</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Walt Frazier - consistently 1st team All-NBA all the way out to  <strong>1975</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Willis Reed - star player with a career cut short by injury, still good enough to win Finals MVP in <strong>1973</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Dave DeBusschere - perennial All-Star out to <strong>1974</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Chet Walker - a 7x All-Star, still an All-Star by <strong>1974</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Dave Bing - a 7x All-Star, still an All-Star by <strong>1976</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Gail Goodrich - perennial All-Star in the 70s, out to <strong>1975</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Oscar Robertson - an all-time great, still good enough to be an All-Star on a contending team out to <strong>1972</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Nate Thurmond - a 7x All-Star, still an All-Star and All-Defensive player by <strong>1974</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now this is just a partial list of guys Bill Russell beat head-to-head in the playoffs, who went on to achieve major accolades in the 1970s, a generally more respected era of basketball.</p>

<p>This list doesn&rsquo;t even include guys like Rick Barry (who Russell was 14-5 against in his career), who played on at an All-Star level out to <strong>1978</strong>, or the many contemporaries he beat who were too old to be successful beyond 1970 (e.g. Bob Pettit, Dolph Schayes, Walt Bellamy).</p>

<p>The fact that Bill Russell was drafted in 1956 makes too many people from recent generations disregard his achievements, often overlooking the fact that Russell dominated everyone in his era AND the next era.</p>

<p>When we think 1970s basketball, we think of Kareem, Gervin, Walton, Elvin Hayes, but we also think of guys like Frazier and Goodrich, without realizing that Russell went up against some of these guys and still dominated.</p>

<p>I say this all to say that Russell&rsquo;s unprecedented 11 rings in 13 seasons should be held in much higher regard than they currently are. Yes, there were fewer teams, and yes he had plenty of help, but ultimately he was the leading force of a dynasty that we will never see the likes of again, and he dominated numerous stars from thr 1950s, 60s, and 70s along the way.</p>

<p>One Bill Russell stat that says it all: the Celtics were a below league average defense in 1955 and in 1970. With Russell from 1956 to 1969, they were the <strong>best defense in the league every year except 1968</strong>, when they were 2nd.</p>

      <label for="lo5arlz" class="commentText"><p>See this is why people discredit Russell. It&rsquo;s not that Russell was the better leader it&rsquo;s that Russell&rsquo;s defensive value eclipsed Wilts offence and defence combined.</p>

<p>All those all-stars bill played with? Whilst they were leading the Celtics to league worst ORTG, Bill Russell was leading a defence so dominant they were still first in netrtg.</p>

<p>The relative gap between Russell and wilt is the largest a gap has been between the 2 best players in the league in the shot clock era. Kareem is the only one close because of the post russell era was pretty weak especially with the aba/nba split.</p>

<p>There is no argument for Wilt&amp;gt;Russell. You can maybe say they are equal if you really value the scoring that much (but like if you normalise his 50ppg season to per 36 or even per hundred rates it would be like the 4th-6th most impressive scoring season just this year - very overrated). But teammates? Wilt had better teammates after leaving the warriors. Bill still 3-1 him in that period. Playmaking? Bill was the more valuable hub until 67. Which gives wilt 2 seasons of being a better playmaker and a notably better scorer.</p>

<p>Bill didn&rsquo;t win a chip 2 seasons in his career. Both were due to injury. There were 3 legit hall of famers bill played with in his career, Cousy, Jones and Havlicek. Which is pretty comparable to the guys West and wilt played with. Only big O had worse teammates. The rest are in the hall because of the titles they won not because of their play. Heisohn was just an inefficient volume scorer.</p>

<p>Personally the thing I find most compelling about Russell&rsquo;s goat candidacy is that you could have put him on any team in the league and they&rsquo;d have won 6 chips in his 13 seasons. There is no other player you can say that about. Cause frankly we saw it. He played on the worst offence and still won because he was so dominant.</p>

<p>meanwhile russell elevated his scoring from the regular season to the playoffs, from the playoffs to the finals, and from finals to game 7. he always played best when they needed him to. opposite energy from wilt.</p>

<p>One is undoubtedly the first GOAT of basketball, the other is a stat chasing loser</p>

<p>they changed the rules and how the game was officiated just for him, and changed how the game was officiated back to the way it was before him after he left the game .</p>

<p>during Wilt’s time you couldn’t back your man down using strength , the defender had to willingly give up ground or it was an offensive foul</p>

<p>“when i played they changed all the rules to make harder for me to dominate and they changed the rules to make it easier for you to dominate .”</p>

<p>and Wilt told Jordan that directly .</p>

<p>People bring up how good Russels team was by citing how many HOF they had. Brother, do you think half of those people would be in the HOF if they didn&rsquo;t win 120397120397 titles by being on Bill Russells team?</p>

      <label for="lo8m1st" class="commentText"><p>To be fair though, most NBA players are in their 20s, and know very little about the full context of the league in the 60s and 70s. The average NBA player today is familiar with Allen Iverson, but most know very little about someone like Clyde Frazier, who at his peak was a superstar two way player with few peers.</p>

<p>You could have put Russell on the absolute worst team in the league and changed nothing else and they&rsquo;d have still won the chip probably every season in his peak and in half the other seasons of his career.</p>

<p>The Celtics had the worst offensive rating in the league and still ahd the best netrtg because he was that good defensively.</p>

      <label for="lo5bqt2" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s funny the people back then knew Bill was the best but they couldn&rsquo;t really explain why. It&rsquo;s not until the modern era where we have really understood defrtg and how impactful being an elite rim protector is even when you aren&rsquo;t blocking by detering attempts, and forcing misses is. How we&rsquo;ve seen over the nearly 80 years of the league that the archetype that Russell is the pinnacle of (and one that is far beyond the rest) is the second most valuable archetype (hyper defensive impact good offensive bigs - Hakeem, Duncan, KG, Drob) behind only dual threat 2-way creators and scorers (Lebron, MJ, Kareem, Shaq - for reference those are the only 4 that qualify for that archetype).</p>

<p>And Russell played in an era where being better on defence mattered infinitely more. So his impact was amplified.</p>

      <label for="lo4pc7k" class="commentText"><p>Great point, the game has changed so much over the course of its history. Not only because of sports science and tactical shifts, but also the rules were very different in Russell’s era, even in ways we don’t realize. It’s very easy to see that they didn’t have a 3 point line, but people poke fun at the dribbling of that era not knowing that the carrying rules were much stricter</p>

<p>I think it’s also important to acknowledge the impact that players from the past had on the game. Russell was an early pioneer of pick and roll defense, for instance. Without guys like him, we wouldn’t have the game that we do today. I wish we, as fans, appreciated each generation of players for what they were rather than constantly comparing them to each other</p>

      <label for="lo800zi" class="commentText"><p>Agreed.</p>

<p>To me, LeBron was always more like Magic. Oversized PG from the Midwest that was a fierce competitor but not quite psychopath like MJ, Zeke, Kobe etc., good with business ventures away from basketball&hellip;.MJ (IMO) was a little better at his job but Bron is more versatile and more of a floor raiser.</p>

<p>Besides Magic, I&rsquo;d compare him to Wilt. A freak of nature that is 1 of 1. Kobe and MJ were great athletes but it&rsquo;s more the mental side with them. Lots of guys had their physical profile but not their mental. Bron is like Magic in Karl Malone&rsquo;s body but with Shawn Kemp or MJ explosiveness.</p>

<p>My argument is that the popular idea that Russell just beat up on some no-name, undersized, frequently Caucasian bums and part-timers from the 50s and 60s is false, given that he ran through a good chunk of players who were still elite performers in the 1970s, a generally more respected era of basketball.</p>

Not until Magic and Bird did the league become revived.

You can understand that the league is much stronger now while also acknowledging that there was respectable talent back then. OP listed great players from that era who could do well in the league today, and instead of nuance, people dismiss them as blacksmiths, cobblers, milkmen and plumbers, which was actually somewhat more accurate to the NBA of the 40s and 50’s. It’s easier to be flippant and dismissive than to have a balanced take. </p>

<p>Besides I don’t think many knock him because of his competition but more so his lack of offensive game. He adds some value with decent passing for a big and his offensive rebounding but he hovered around 12 pp/75 on his career at just slightly above league average TS%. Those are Tyson Chandler but much less efficient level scoring output. A more efficient Ben Wallace level output. Similar to guys like Joakim Noah, Luc Longely, I’m actually struggling to find someone who matches perfectly. Jamaal Magloire’s best years seem close.</p>

<p>No doubt that relative to era he might be the most impactful player for his team ever. But I’m not sure questions about his play having the same lift on lesser teams, or in other eras, etc is really unfair.</p>

<p>With Russell though he really did carry the team. The Celtics had one of the worst offensive ratings each season but the defense from Bill was so good they still had the best net rating. And without Bill their defense was mid. So one player took the Celtics from a below average/bad team to one of the most dominant dynasties ever.</p>

      <label for="lo5plpv" class="commentText"><p>So for some reason Russell is carrying the best defense even though he had other solid defenders and gets no downside for the fact he is a huge reason why their offense would be bad also?! </p>

<p>In an era of big man driven scoring he was incapable of scoring the ball if not on the break. He played alongside other offensive carries who could do that work for him while he does what he’s best at. </p>

<p>He’s more or less a better version of Draymond green. He’s an undersized Center capable of covering Centers anyway because of his athleticism and high defensive IQ. </p>

<p>If he grew up today I would assume he would’ve focused a bit more on his handles and passing and I expect him to end up more like Draymond. His career is one of legends, but he is more or less a top top top top top level role player then GOAT.</p>

      <label for="lo5c103" class="commentText"><p>Yes like I think if you ask most intermediate NBA fans they would not be unsurprised by anything OP said. We know he is one of the best defenders in NBA history and obviously a guy who won 11 rings in 13 years had a great record against almost every great of his era.</p>

<p>The question is if you transported him to the modern era, would he be Tyson Chandler on steroids, a better Rudy Gobert or more like AD? (I’m personally sure a more mobile Gobert is his floor)</p>

<p>Because all those guys are great but only one is perennial All NBA guy and even AD has rarely  been considered a top 5 guy and never in the best player of his era discussion like Russell.</p>

<p>For his generation there’s no doubt Russell is a goat though. I just can’t think of many guys who are historically elite defenders but not an elite offensive hub who have been considered as good as Russell.</p>

<p>Again, have no doubts he’d be a first ballot HoF even today but I am not sure he’s on even the fringe of the GOAT discussion like he currently is.</p>

<p>Ben Wallace. Maybe Chandler. Gobert is significantly bigger than Russell and like you say, AD is miles beyond as a two-way player.</p>

      <label for="lo51f48" class="commentText"><p>Also worth noting that the Celtics didnt trash teams most years. More often they overachieved and won in the clutch by the skin of their teeth.</p>

<p>I mean, Russell won his last ring against Wilt, West, Elgin.</p>

<p>By the mid 60’s, talent had improved massively. Look at the 65 all star roster. Of the 20 players, 9 would be superstars today, and at least another 4 all stars. Im not blowing smoke:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1965_NBA_All-Star_Game" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1965_NBA_All-Star_Game</a></p>

<p>Superstars in any era: Russ, Wilt, Nate Thurmond, West, Oscar, Elgin, Willis Reed, Jerry Lucas, Bob Pettit.</p>

<p>Likely all stars: Gus Johnson, Walt Bellamy, Sam Jones, Hal Greer.</p>

<p>Biggest argument against Celtic Dynasty is that only had 8-14 (from memory) teams in the league in Russels 13 years, so fewer rounds to the playoffs.</p>

<p>Edit. Some of you have made some very valid points, I will cushion off and say I overhyped his team a tad. However, I stand by what I say at the core, it’s hard to put him up by the likes of MJ and LeBron when you look at him offensively.</p>

      <label for="lo4hwan" class="commentText"><p>Then why do we talk so much more about Wilt, Elgin, and Jerry than all of Russell&rsquo;s teammates combined? Bill was inarguably the linchpin of the team - you have to have great teammates to win a team sport, but the people who won with Bill could not have won without Bill.</p>

<p>And as for &ldquo;subpar&rdquo; on one end, dude has an exceptional case to be the greatest defensive player ever to such an extent that you pretty much have to disqualify his era in order to consider anyone else, and he was still consistently a top 20 scorer in the league for the first half of his career, a top 20 facilitator (as a center) for his entire career, and top 5 in field goal efficiency for his first four years (though four years also being his lowest in assists. He was an elite two way player for the bulk of his career and as he aged and the team came to rely on his defense and need less of his scoring, he tooled his game to fill the gaps that needed to be filled on whatever the team deficiencies were year to year.</p>

<p>The year he retired he was top five in MVP voting. He retired because he didn&rsquo;t think he could still be the best player in the world - not because he couldn&rsquo;t hack it anymore. There&rsquo;s no way you can look at that and the story his stats tell across his career and think that think that the absence of a 30 ppg game season was an incapability rather than a calculation he had foregone in pursuit of fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh rings because who cares how you win if you win?</p>

<p>He was *not* subpar on offense within the league he played - he&rsquo;s only &ldquo;sub par&rdquo; compared to other more offensively dominant GOAT candidates; none of whom can even see the candle they can&rsquo;t hold to his defensive dominance.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s gotta be your GOAT ofc (he&rsquo;s not mine but I&rsquo;m higher on him than most), but dudes career is so mindbending I gotta take the time to advocate for it when I get the opportunity cause it&rsquo;s way too easy to see the championships and then reject the conclusion that he&rsquo;s actually the best because of that because it&rsquo;s a boring answer even though all the other stuff that went into winning those championships blow your mind when you try to compare them to anyone else.</p>

A game 5 win by the Bulls and they most likely win the series.  Bulls matched up well with the Pacers and the Rockets too so they had a good chance of winning the ring that season.</p>

<p>Moreover, the quality of the team exists mainly in hindsight. The media at the time more or less dismissed them as getting lucky, especially when it came to officiating.</p>

      <label for="lo4xqtj" class="commentText"><p>This is deceptive.  Wilt played with Elgin Baylor for a few years at the very end of Baylor&rsquo;s career.   And Wilt&rsquo;s prime was his 11 years with the Warriors and the 76ers, before he got to LA, and before his knees started giving out.   For his best years he was playing with Guy Rogers as his second best player on the team, i.e, with scrubs.</p>

<p>The brilliance of the 1960s Celtics dynasty had several sources: 1) Bill Russell, 2) a strong deep supporting roster that played together year after year and never had any roster turnover, and 3) the best coach in the league.  To give all the credit to Bill cheapens the accomplishments of the other 6 Celtics Hall of Famers of that era and the Celtics organization.</p>

<p>And if you are using Baylor and West as a head to head comparison, ask yourself how many seasons Wilt, Baylor and West were together while Bill Russell was leading the Celtics?  The answer is one.  One season.  1968-1969.   Wilt didn&rsquo;t go to the Lakers until 1968.   So it&rsquo;s not that useful.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s still a top 10 player of all time because of his legacy, importance to the game, and defensive dominance. But he has no real for GOAT. We can appreciate what he brought to the game, but the goat debate is only Lebron and Jordan.</p>

<p>Like even if the era WAS awful, that would not preclude all-star selections or awards at all. There still has to be all-stars and awards regardless of the talent level of the league lol.</p>

<p>It’s like me saying I’m a great athlete because I got 4 Varsity letters when the argument isn’t that I never did but that I’m overrated for getting so many letters because my school had 14 people in it. The argument isn’t that I didn’t get accolades but that they’re not as meaningful as if I’d done it at say, Monteverde.</p>

<p>The whole point of highlighting Russell&rsquo;s opponents with major accolades in the 1970s is to illustrate that Russell beat several players that were dominant in the NEXT era beyond his retirement, implying he would&rsquo;ve been a top player even in a stronger era.</p>

<p>Kareem, Dr J, Walton, Gervin, Moses, Maravich, Barry, Hayes, Frazier, are all much more highly regarded and less frequently accused of playing against bums than anyone from the 1960s.</p>

      <label for="lo4yk60" class="commentText"><p>You are right that the 70s was weak, but the 60s was not much better, simply because not enough kids were playing basketball and developing basketball skills to create a critical mass of talent and roster depth necessary even for the 8-12 teams that the NBA had at the time.  It was like the leather helmet era of football.</p>

<p>Here are some other all time greats in how many of playoff series were competitive enough to be pushed to a game 7:</p>

<p>Michael Jordan: 37 playoff series 3 game sevens (8%)</p>

<p>Lebron James: 54 playoff series 8 game sevens (15%)</p>

<p>Magic Johnson: 40 playoff series 4 game sevens (10%)</p>

<p>Kobe Bryant: 43 playoff series 6 game sevens (14%)</p>

<p>Bill Russell: 29 playoff series 10 game sevens (34%)</p>

<p>Bill Russell’s playoff series were simply far more competitive than anyone else’s, yet somehow he never lost a game 7 when all the people I mentioned did</p>

      <label for="lo7rtxv" class="commentText"><p>Maybe competitive was not the right word, but rather, the odds. The odds of any given team winning a title is mathematically greater in an 8 team league than a 30 team league</p>

<p>Even going back to the competitive part, the Celtics generally had the highest portion of the all-nba players on the roster during the bill russell era. So whether you have 8 teams or 100 teams, the team with the deepest pool of talent is likely going to win. This was the 60s version of a super team. I don’t knock bill Russell but we need to look at the context behind his success</p>

He was ranked the 7th best high jumper in the world in 1956 and turned down a chance to compete in the Olympics as a high jumper. There are videos of him sprinting down the court insanely fast while dribbling the ball, faster than big men do today other than maybe Giannis. In one surviving video, Russell literally jumps from near the free throw line OVER a dude for an easy layup. I know it sounds unbelievable, but it can easily be found online.</p>

      <label for="lo4ksy7" class="commentText"><p>Russell is fairly ranked IMO. I love the guy but he was only 1st team all nba 4x as he was competing with Wilt the whole way for best player in that era and until the 90s people had Wilt ahead of him.</p>

<p>Only 3 players in NBA history have been the undisputed best player of their era: Kareem, MJ, and Lebron. I don’t really think there’s an argument for anyone else being GOAT.</p>

<p>Also, decades aren’t some dividing line in the league. There were players in his league that played throughout the 70’s. Some into the 80’s. NBA level talent is NBA talent. Eras are defined by who dominated and teams build rosters to accentuate, copy or try and stop who’s at the top</p>

      <label for="lo4tfgv" class="commentText"><p>I appreciate your post and I’ll happily support generational GOATs as a concept. However if you read the history of the time, there were enough teams and the guys just weren’t on the same level. Another thing that gets slept on until you read the Celtics historical stuff is that those teams were stacked so while Russell was undoubtedly their best player, he really didn’t have to carry much of the offensive workload and had to play significantly fewer playoff rounds/games.</p>

<p>I think of Russell like Ty Cobb or Cy Young or Walter Johnson or Bart Starr. Like the dudes were absolutely incredible but the 57-69 NBA bears very little resemblance to even the 80s much less today. You can call him the greatest winner of all time and that’s a pretty big compliment but GOAT feels like a stretch.</p>

<p>Wilt also played and dominated against those same guys including Kareem. Yet, people say Wilt was only dominant because he played against plumbers. I think most people put them Wilt and Russell side by side in top 10 debates, which is reasonable. I don&rsquo;t think either have a convincing argument over Jordan, Lebron, and imo Kareem.</p>

His championships are also not as impressive as there were 8-10 teams back then. The average height of an NBA player was about 6&rsquo;5 back then, which is more than I thought, but that is  2-3 inches less than it is now. He may be the GOAT defender, but no way I&rsquo;m taking him over LeBron or Jordan.</p>

      <label for="lo787g1" class="commentText"><p>I think Russell is held in proper esteem. All-time great? Yeah. Pioneer of the game? Sure. But the NBA had less than 10 teams in most of his championship years. Setting aside the fact that athletes in general are stronger, faster, and more athletic than in the 60’s because of advances in medical and training science, Russell just didn’t face the same breadth of competition that exists in the modern NBA.</p>

<p>Most all-time lists have him top 10. I think that’s fine. If he played today with modern training, he’d probably be an all-star to all-nba level player. Maybe a handful of DPOY’s. That level made him one of the best in the 60’s. And that’s fine. The league has changed. And that’s fine too.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s one: in 1969, there were 14 teams in the NBA. 1967? 10 teams. 1957, Bill Russell&rsquo;s first year? 8 teams. The man won a ton, but he objectively went through way, way less competition to do it. For many of those years, 2-4 of those teams were absolute dog shit expansion teams.</p>

For comparison, look what Wilt was able to do the competition, including averageing around 30ppg against Russel himself.</p>

<p>Russel was on the best team and that&rsquo;s why he won. Indivudally, he was a bum compared to all the other top 10 goat candidates.</p>

<p>IMO, those 11 titles are probably only equal to like 4-5 modern titles, and at that point I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s really in the GOAT argument at all.</p>

      <label for="lo51bgs" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not trying to be snarky but the problem is you said Bill Russell went through all those players and teams. No he didn&rsquo;t. The Boston Celtics did. The question that still plagues Russell is how much did he benefit on being the best player on a dynasty team.</p>

<p>It seems to me that Russell is evaluated differently than every other MVP level player. For those players we evaluate them on the basis of being the type of player who takes over a game and dominates. With Russell we evaluate him on the basis of low well he blended into a system and played that role. Ironically Russell being the best winner and best team player in NBA history may disqualify him from being the GOAT.</p>

<p>Pointing to his winning is not a great metric for evaluating his greatness. He won 11 titles in 13 years. Ok, you know who the second greatest winner ever is? Sam Jones. He won 10 titles in 12 years.</p>

<p>With all the other great players on history I have the feeling that putting them on any other team you&rsquo;d still get the same career out of them. With Russell i think it is quite a reach to say if he was on any other team that team would be the dynasty the Celtics were so the main argument your making for Russell being the GOAT, his winning, actually disproves it.</p>

<p>Humans are just simply faster, quicker, stronger, more coordinated, and have better endurance.</p>

<p>Is there some reason you believe basketball to be an exception to this?</p>

<p>Further, skill has progressed too. 3s are more valuable shots than 2s. Defensive strategy has progressed significantly. Offenses forcing switches is a new and effective strategy.</p>

<p>What part of the game do you think these ol’ folks have an advantage in?</p>

      <label for="lo8nhgm" class="commentText"><p>Don&rsquo;t change the argument, I didn&rsquo;t say that the old folks have an advantage, I said you were wrong about there being no good players back then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humans are just simply faster, quicker, stronger, more coordinated, and have better endurance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that every athlete in the modern era is better than every athlete in an older era.</p>

<p>Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell were extremely athletic by any standard. Bill Russell was ranked the second best high jumper in the United States and 7th in the world. He turned down competing to play his rookie year in the NBA. At least one time he jumped over a man in an NBA game. I know 50&rsquo;s high jumping isn&rsquo;t the definitive case for the argument, but it&rsquo;s still impressive and puts him over the majority of today&rsquo;s league in terms of athleticism.</p>

<p>Wilt was one of the strongest and most athletic players in the history of the league. He used to work out with Arnold Schwarzenegger who said he was blown away by Wilt&rsquo;s strength, and that he saw Wilt to do a tricep extension with 180 lbs. Wilt was recorded to have a 6&rsquo;6.75” for high jump, 47’5.25” shot-put and 46’2” triple jump. He had seasons where he played 48 minutes a game. There have been other unverified witness accounts that he benched 500 lbs and had a 50 inch verticle. Regardless of the fact those last 2 could be somewhat inaccurate, he was undoubtedly a beast and would leave many of today&rsquo;s players in the dust athletically.</p>

<p>You honestly don&rsquo;t think Wilt and Bill Russell couldn&rsquo;t be effective players in today&rsquo;s game? I know Russell&rsquo;s offense wouldn&rsquo;t translate, but I have no doubt he could make up for it with adjustments and with his incredible athleticism.</p>

<p>Frazier, Bellamy, Thurmond, Unseld, and others were also very athletic. There are plenty of players of today less athletic than any of the aforementioned: Doncic, Jokic, Steph, to name a few from the top of the league.</p>

<p>Guys like Sam Jones, Jerry West and John Havlicek would be sharp shooters in any era. Jerry West, for example, played on the same all star team as Kareem Abdul Jabaar, held his own and they were considered equals. And Kareem of course was still a great player in the era of MJ. And I can go on and on, but I&rsquo;ve made my point. That the league is much stronger right now is a reason many greatly underestimate the talent of the top players of the 60&rsquo;s. To say none of them were any good is ignorant and disrespectful.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not changing the argument lol. If new players have tons and tons of advantages over old players, and old players have no advantages over new players, then by the standards of new players, the old players are not good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that every athlete in the modern era is better than every athlete in an older era.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it does. When it comes to professional athletics, the cream rises to the top. The top performing athletes of today absolutely smoke the top performing athletes of the 1960s. We have seen this is countless sports. In 1960, Armin Hary set the world record in the 100m dash with a time of 10.25 seconds. With that time, he would not have even made the semifinals, much less the finals, much less winning with record time. He would not have made it out of the first round. So yeah, absolutely everyone in the semifinals, not even the finals, ran faster than Armin Hary at his best. Why would you think basketball would be any different?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell were extremely athletic by any standard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, not at all. They were extremely athletics for their time. That gets overstated by old people from the same time who want to believe they were athletic too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bill Russell was ranked the second best high jumper in the United States and 7th in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the time? Sure. What do you think has happened to high jump records since the 1960s? Nothing?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still impressive and puts him over the majority of today&rsquo;s league in terms of athleticism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It simply does not do this at all.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>100% of this is myth, except for stuff that isn&rsquo;t impressive. Jumping over a person is not a feat of athleticism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You honestly don&rsquo;t think Wilt and Bill Russell couldn&rsquo;t be effective players in today&rsquo;s game?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They would get absolutely run off the court trying to defend 3pt shooters in switches, yes. It would be an absolute demolition. It would not be remotely close. They are also not good with ball skills like passing and dribbling compared to todays players. They are a walking turnover who cannot defend or score.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Frazier, Bellamy, Thurmond, Unseld, and others were also very athletic. There are plenty of players of today less athletic than any of the aforementioned: Doncic, Jokic, Steph, to name a few from the top of the league.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a joke. Firstly, people underrating Steph&rsquo;s athleticism will never get old to me. He has the best cardio in the league. The other issue for you is that you are naming players with incredible skills. The reason they are NBA players is they have immense skill that absolutely none of these bums from 1960 could get close to. Passing, dribbling, and obviously shooting. No contest.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Nephew, what a joke this is. They are not sharp shooters at all in this era. None of these guys could shoot like modern players. Bird wouldn&rsquo;t even compare to a modern day shooter at all. Buddy Hield is a far superior shooter to anyone on your list, and no one talks about Buddy as some superstar shooter.</p>

      <label for="lo4o6rs" class="commentText"><p>Idk for me, you can see Bill enter the league as one of the top players of his era in terms of efficiency and still pretty elite among his peers in terms of scoring and then that scoring goes down a smidge and his assist numbers go up.</p>

<p>If the goal of playing the sport of basketball is to win basketball games and win basketball championships, why should we look at the things Bill didn&rsquo;t do while winning that his peers did while failing to win and infer that he couldn&rsquo;t do them. I don&rsquo;t know that he could have averaged 50 ppg in a season, but it seems self evident to me that he chose to score less because his team didn&rsquo;t need that from him to win and they cared more about winning.</p>

<p>And considering he didn&rsquo;t just win more than anyone else in the history of the sport, but he won more than anyone else in the history of all North American sports (one other hockey guy also has 11 but did it in 20 years instead of 13) and the only two he lost were when he played on a cast and when he was a first year player coach who forgot to do substitutions and timeouts, I think people just want to be able to DQ him as the GOAT because it&rsquo;s not fun to think that the greatest player in your sport&rsquo;s history retired more than 50 years ago especially if the game has evolved and his highlights don&rsquo;t look like the new highlights do.</p>

<p>I feel like with evolutions in strategy and training and education and sports medicine and the resources well paid athletes have that prior eras didn&rsquo;t have access to, the only fair way to try to compare apples to oranges is to look at what they had the ability to do and what they actually did and by that metric there really isn&rsquo;t much more anyone could have possibly wanted from Bill. That doesn&rsquo;t have to mean he is the GOAT (he&rsquo;s not mine), but I don&rsquo;t think people who are ruling him out because of how he&rsquo;d compare to players in 2024 are considering what that&rsquo;s gonna mean for Jordan or Lebron in 2075</p>
