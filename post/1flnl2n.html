      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1flnl2n/bill_russells_goat_candidacy_is_unfairly/"><p>Bill Russell&rsquo;s GOAT candidacy is unfairly discredited due to lazy assumptions about his era</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Before anybody hits me with the inevitable accusation that I&rsquo;m a grandpa who has just discovered the internet, I was born in the 1990s.</p>

<p>Here is a partial list of notable players that Russell had to get through to win his 11 rings:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Wilt Chamberlain - an all-time great, an MVP candidate even in his last season in <strong>1973</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Jerry West - another all-time great, still an All-Star caliber player in his last season in <strong>1974</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Elgin Baylor - same as above, still an All-Star in his last full season in <strong>1970</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Walt Frazier - consistently 1st team All-NBA all the way out to  <strong>1975</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Willis Reed - star player with a career cut short by injury, still good enough to win Finals MVP in <strong>1973</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Dave DeBusschere - perennial All-Star out to <strong>1974</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Chet Walker - a 7x All-Star, still an All-Star by <strong>1974</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Dave Bing - a 7x All-Star, still an All-Star by <strong>1976</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Gail Goodrich - perennial All-Star in the 70s, out to <strong>1975</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Oscar Robertson - an all-time great, still good enough to be an All-Star on a contending team out to <strong>1972</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Nate Thurmond - a 7x All-Star, still an All-Star and All-Defensive player by <strong>1974</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now this is just a partial list of guys Bill Russell beat head-to-head in the playoffs, who went on to achieve major accolades in the 1970s, a generally more respected era of basketball.</p>

<p>This list doesn&rsquo;t even include guys like Rick Barry (who Russell was 14-5 against in his career), who played on at an All-Star level out to <strong>1978</strong>, or the many contemporaries he beat who were too old to be successful beyond 1970 (e.g. Bob Pettit, Dolph Schayes, Walt Bellamy).</p>

<p>The fact that Bill Russell was drafted in 1956 makes too many people from recent generations disregard his achievements, often overlooking the fact that Russell dominated everyone in his era AND the next era.</p>

<p>When we think 1970s basketball, we think of Kareem, Gervin, Walton, Elvin Hayes, but we also think of guys like Frazier and Goodrich, without realizing that Russell went up against some of these guys and still dominated.</p>

<p>I say this all to say that Russell&rsquo;s unprecedented 11 rings in 13 seasons should be held in much higher regard than they currently are. Yes, there were fewer teams, and yes he had plenty of help, but ultimately he was the leading force of a dynasty that we will never see the likes of again, and he dominated numerous stars from thr 1950s, 60s, and 70s along the way.</p>

<p>One Bill Russell stat that says it all: the Celtics were a below league average defense in 1955 and in 1970. With Russell from 1956 to 1969, they were the <strong>best defense in the league every year except 1968</strong>, when they were 2nd.</p>

      <label for="lo4axl6" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not lazy at all, the average competition back then was significantly worse than today. On top of that, for a lot of those rings they had to win 2 total playoff rounds. Threepeating in the modern era is way more impressive than what the Celtics did in the blacksmith and cobbler dominated NBA.</p>

      <label for="lo4cjf6" class="commentText"><p>My argument isn&rsquo;t that his rings are equivalent in value to rings won today. Of course the game has come a long way.</p>

<p>My argument is that the popular idea that Russell just beat up on some no-name, undersized, frequently Caucasian bums and part-timers from the 50s and 60s is false, given that he ran through a good chunk of players who were still elite performers in the 1970s, a generally more respected era of basketball.</p>

<p>Also, playoff games were still on tape delay through 1986</p>

      <label for="lo4hdmp" class="commentText"><p>yep, russell was bigger and more athletic than anyone else so he got to dominate on defence. ben simmons doesn‚Äôt enjoy that because nowadays the average height in the league is half a foot more than it was in the 60‚Äôs.</p>

<p>yes, if you put prime durant in the 60‚Äôs he‚Äôs the MVP every year. hell, if you put neemias queta in the 60‚Äôs he‚Äôd average 30 as well. the skill gap is monumental.</p>

<p>easiest answer ever if you want to use your brain. russell and wilt were bigger and more athletic in a league full of math teachers. that‚Äôs why no one else did it- because no one else had their gifts. it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that if either of them were in the league today they‚Äôd be at the end of the bench.</p>

<p>Rocket Richard or Bart Starr can stand head and shoulders above the rest for their era.

      <label for="lo4fc6r" class="commentText"><p>It‚Äôs kind of funny you say he got discredited for his era then your main argument is pointing to accolades from that era like all-stars.</p>

<p>Like even if the era WAS awful, that would not preclude all-star selections or awards at all. There still has to be all-stars and awards regardless of the talent level of the league lol.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs like me saying I‚Äôm a great athlete because I got 4 Varsity letters when the argument isn‚Äôt that I never did but that I‚Äôm overrated for getting so many letters because my school had 14 people in it. The argument isn‚Äôt that I didn‚Äôt get accolades but that they‚Äôre not as meaningful as if I‚Äôd done it at say, Monteverde.</p>

      <label for="lo4d765" class="commentText"><p>Throw Tatum into the league back then and i promise you hed be the best player in that era.</p>

<p>Bills argument is how much he won and his defensive impact.</p>

<p>The thing is that its super easy to be a great defender in a league full of guys with offensive limitations.</p>

<p>The only notable offensive force from the time was Wilt and the man averaged as much as he did simply because he was bigger and more athletic than almost everyone else.</p>

<p>But when faced with someone like Russel that could actually stand up to him, his numbers started looking far worse.</p>

<p>When you goat casse is built on the foundation of you being an amazing defender in a league full of mediocre at best offensive talent, then its a very shaky casse.</p>

<p>And if you wanna argue this point, just note that these guys averaged over 20 rebounds a game.</p>
