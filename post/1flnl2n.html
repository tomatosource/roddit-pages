</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Before anybody hits me with the inevitable accusation that I&rsquo;m a grandpa who has just discovered the internet, I was born in the 1990s.</p>

<p>Here is a partial list of notable players that Russell had to get through to win his 11 rings:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Wilt Chamberlain - an all-time great, an MVP candidate even in his last season in <strong>1973</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Jerry West - another all-time great, still an All-Star caliber player in his last season in <strong>1974</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Elgin Baylor - same as above, still an All-Star in his last full season in <strong>1970</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Walt Frazier - consistently 1st team All-NBA all the way out to  <strong>1975</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Willis Reed - star player with a career cut short by injury, still good enough to win Finals MVP in <strong>1973</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Dave DeBusschere - perennial All-Star out to <strong>1974</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Chet Walker - a 7x All-Star, still an All-Star by <strong>1974</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Dave Bing - a 7x All-Star, still an All-Star by <strong>1976</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Gail Goodrich - perennial All-Star in the 70s, out to <strong>1975</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Oscar Robertson - an all-time great, still good enough to be an All-Star on a contending team out to <strong>1972</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Nate Thurmond - a 7x All-Star, still an All-Star and All-Defensive player by <strong>1974</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now this is just a partial list of guys Bill Russell beat head-to-head in the playoffs, who went on to achieve major accolades in the 1970s, a generally more respected era of basketball.</p>

<p>This list doesn&rsquo;t even include guys like Rick Barry (who Russell was 14-5 against in his career), who played on at an All-Star level out to <strong>1978</strong>, or the many contemporaries he beat who were too old to be successful beyond 1970 (e.g. Bob Pettit, Dolph Schayes, Walt Bellamy).</p>

<p>The fact that Bill Russell was drafted in 1956 makes too many people from recent generations disregard his achievements, often overlooking the fact that Russell dominated everyone in his era AND the next era.</p>

<p>When we think 1970s basketball, we think of Kareem, Gervin, Walton, Elvin Hayes, but we also think of guys like Frazier and Goodrich, without realizing that Russell went up against some of these guys and still dominated.</p>

<p>I say this all to say that Russell&rsquo;s unprecedented 11 rings in 13 seasons should be held in much higher regard than they currently are. Yes, there were fewer teams, and yes he had plenty of help, but ultimately he was the leading force of a dynasty that we will never see the likes of again, and he dominated numerous stars from thr 1950s, 60s, and 70s along the way.</p>

<p>One Bill Russell stat that says it all: the Celtics were a below league average defense in 1955 and in 1970. With Russell from 1956 to 1969, they were the <strong>best defense in the league every year except 1968</strong>, when they were 2nd.</p>

      <label for="lo5arlz" class="commentText"><p>See this is why people discredit Russell. It&rsquo;s not that Russell was the better leader it&rsquo;s that Russell&rsquo;s defensive value eclipsed Wilts offence and defence combined.</p>

<p>All those all-stars bill played with? Whilst they were leading the Celtics to league worst ORTG, Bill Russell was leading a defence so dominant they were still first in netrtg.</p>

<p>The relative gap between Russell and wilt is the largest a gap has been between the 2 best players in the league in the shot clock era. Kareem is the only one close because of the post russell era was pretty weak especially with the aba/nba split.</p>

<p>There is no argument for Wilt&amp;gt;Russell. You can maybe say they are equal if you really value the scoring that much (but like if you normalise his 50ppg season to per 36 or even per hundred rates it would be like the 4th-6th most impressive scoring season just this year - very overrated). But teammates? Wilt had better teammates after leaving the warriors. Bill still 3-1 him in that period. Playmaking? Bill was the more valuable hub until 67. Which gives wilt 2 seasons of being a better playmaker and a notably better scorer.</p>

<p>Bill didn&rsquo;t win a chip 2 seasons in his career. Both were due to injury. There were 3 legit hall of famers bill played with in his career, Cousy, Jones and Havlicek. Which is pretty comparable to the guys West and wilt played with. Only big O had worse teammates. The rest are in the hall because of the titles they won not because of their play. Heisohn was just an inefficient volume scorer.</p>

<p>Personally the thing I find most compelling about Russell&rsquo;s goat candidacy is that you could have put him on any team in the league and they&rsquo;d have won 6 chips in his 13 seasons. There is no other player you can say that about. Cause frankly we saw it. He played on the worst offence and still won because he was so dominant.</p>

      <label for="lo5hbpu" class="commentText"><p>russell understood that he could get everyone buy in on defense if he let them take the reins on offense, and back then defense really did win you chips.</p>

<p>meanwhile russell elevated his scoring from the regular season to the playoffs, from the playoffs to the finals, and from finals to game 7. he always played best when they needed him to. opposite energy from wilt.</p>

<p>One is undoubtedly the first GOAT of basketball, the other is a stat chasing loser</p>

<p>they changed the rules and how the game was officiated just for him, and changed how the game was officiated back to the way it was before him after he left the game .</p>

<p>during Wilt’s time you couldn’t back your man down using strength , the defender had to willingly give up ground or it was an offensive foul</p>

<p>According to NBA players, the GOAT debate consists of only two players and everyone else is in a distant rearview mirror.</p>

<p>Michael Jordan edged out LeBron James as the greatest player in NBA history, according to a poll of 133 players conducted by The Athletic. Jordan received 45.9 percent of the vote, while James came in at 42.1 percent.</p>

<p>Kobe Bryant was a distant third place at 9.8 percent, while Stephen Curry, Magic Johnson and Paul Pierce each received 0.8 percent—the equivalent to one vote apiece.</p>

How we&rsquo;ve seen over the nearly 80 years of the league that the archetype that Russell is the pinnacle of (and one that is far beyond the rest) is the second most valuable archetype (hyper defensive impact good offensive bigs - Hakeem, Duncan, KG, Drob) behind only dual threat 2-way creators and scorers (Lebron, MJ, Kareem, Shaq - for reference those are the only 4 that qualify for that archetype).</p>

<p>And Russell played in an era where being better on defence mattered infinitely more. So his impact was amplified.</p>

The whole “Ruth didn’t have to play against an entire race lol” argument is a pretty popular one nowadays and makes it difficult for a lot of people to anoint him, right or wrong.</p>

      <label for="lo4lhxs" class="commentText"><p>i mean among people who talk about baseball a lot, sure, but i&rsquo;m pretty sure if you polled Americans in general it&rsquo;d be Ruth without much argument. like the &ldquo;segregation lowered the competition level&rdquo; argument is pretty compelling to <em>me,</em> but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s one most people are thinking that hard about</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s like how in NBA media, MJ is still probably the consensus GOAT but there&rsquo;s a legitimate contingent who think it&rsquo;s LeBron, but if you asked people on the street I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d get a single person saying LeBron outside of Cleveland</p>

      <label for="lo4pc7k" class="commentText"><p>Great point, the game has changed so much over the course of its history. Not only because of sports science and tactical shifts, but also the rules were very different in Russell’s era, even in ways we don’t realize. It’s very easy to see that they didn’t have a 3 point line, but people poke fun at the dribbling of that era not knowing that the carrying rules were much stricter</p>

<p>I think it’s also important to acknowledge the impact that players from the past had on the game. Russell was an early pioneer of pick and roll defense, for instance. Without guys like him, we wouldn’t have the game that we do today. I wish we, as fans, appreciated each generation of players for what they were rather than constantly comparing them to each other</p>

<p>Blocks would be one of the most era inflated stats. People also took all their shots at the rim back then so more shots to block. Russell would still be a generational rim protector today but those block numbers should not sway any opinion.</p>

<p>My argument is that the popular idea that Russell just beat up on some no-name, undersized, frequently Caucasian bums and part-timers from the 50s and 60s is false, given that he ran through a good chunk of players who were still elite performers in the 1970s, a generally more respected era of basketball.</p>

<p>Besides I don’t think many knock him because of his competition but more so his lack of offensive game. He adds some value with decent passing for a big and his offensive rebounding but he hovered around 12 pp/75 on his career at just slightly above league average TS%. Those are Tyson Chandler but much less efficient level scoring output. A more efficient Ben Wallace level output. Similar to guys like Joakim Noah, Luc Longely, I’m actually struggling to find someone who matches perfectly. Jamaal Magloire’s best years seem close.</p>

<p>No doubt that relative to era he might be the most impactful player for his team ever. But I’m not sure questions about his play having the same lift on lesser teams, or in other eras, etc is really unfair.</p>

We know he is one of the best defenders in NBA history and obviously a guy who won 11 rings in 13 years had a great record against almost every great of his era.</p>

<p>The question is if you transported him to the modern era, would he be Tyson Chandler on steroids, a better Rudy Gobert or more like AD? (I’m personally sure a more mobile Gobert is his floor)</p>

<p>Because all those guys are great but only one is perennial All NBA guy and even AD has rarely  been considered a top 5 guy and never in the best player of his era discussion like Russell.</p>

<p>For his generation there’s no doubt Russell is a goat though. I just can’t think of many guys who are historically elite defenders but not an elite offensive hub who have been considered as good as Russell.</p>

<p>Again, have no doubts he’d be a first ballot HoF even today but I am not sure he’s on even the fringe of the GOAT discussion like he currently is.</p>

<p>With Russell though he really did carry the team. The Celtics had one of the worst offensive ratings each season but the defense from Bill was so good they still had the best net rating. And without Bill their defense was mid. So one player took the Celtics from a below average/bad team to one of the most dominant dynasties ever.</p>

<p>When Russell played, he was probably more dominant defensively than anyone has been offensively. There were times in the mid 60s where the Celtics were bad to very bad offensively, and they still blew teams out all year because their defense relative to the league was better than anything we’ve seen before or since</p>

<p>Look at the 64 Celtics <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/1964.html" target="_blank">https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/1964.html</a></p>

      <label for="lo4hwan" class="commentText"><p>Then why do we talk so much more about Wilt, Elgin, and Jerry than all of Russell&rsquo;s teammates combined? Bill was inarguably the linchpin of the team - you have to have great teammates to win a team sport, but the people who won with Bill could not have won without Bill.</p>

<p>And as for &ldquo;subpar&rdquo; on one end, dude has an exceptional case to be the greatest defensive player ever to such an extent that you pretty much have to disqualify his era in order to consider anyone else, and he was still consistently a top 20 scorer in the league for the first half of his career, a top 20 facilitator (as a center) for his entire career, and top 5 in field goal efficiency for his first four years (though four years also being his lowest in assists. He was an elite two way player for the bulk of his career and as he aged and the team came to rely on his defense and need less of his scoring, he tooled his game to fill the gaps that needed to be filled on whatever the team deficiencies were year to year.</p>

<p>The year he retired he was top five in MVP voting. He retired because he didn&rsquo;t think he could still be the best player in the world - not because he couldn&rsquo;t hack it anymore. There&rsquo;s no way you can look at that and the story his stats tell across his career and think that think that the absence of a 30 ppg game season was an incapability rather than a calculation he had foregone in pursuit of fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh rings because who cares how you win if you win?</p>

<p>He was *not* subpar on offense within the league he played - he&rsquo;s only &ldquo;sub par&rdquo; compared to other more offensively dominant GOAT candidates; none of whom can even see the candle they can&rsquo;t hold to his defensive dominance.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s gotta be your GOAT ofc (he&rsquo;s not mine but I&rsquo;m higher on him than most), but dudes career is so mindbending I gotta take the time to advocate for it when I get the opportunity cause it&rsquo;s way too easy to see the championships and then reject the conclusion that he&rsquo;s actually the best because of that because it&rsquo;s a boring answer even though all the other stuff that went into winning those championships blow your mind when you try to compare them to anyone else.</p>

You don&rsquo;t even have to scour or calculate for it - it&rsquo;s just on the Bill Russell basketball reference page. What are you talking about?</p>

<p>And as for &ldquo;Wilt averaged better&rdquo; - yes, he did. He averaged a lot more. And won WAAAAAAAY less - literally only when Bill got injured or retired. And when Wilt scored his most ever, his peers voted Bill Russell the MVP (1962) because in spite of the stat sheet, the goal is to win the game and Bill was the most valuable to winning the game. You&rsquo;re docking a player who did the most winning of anyone in any North American sports league ever for not putting up enough of the right stats when the reason we value having those stats is that they contribute to winning!</p>

<p>Would Bill be the most valuable player in the 2024 NBA? No of course not - neither would Wilt or Kareem or Shaq or even Jordan for that matter because you spend your whole life learning to play the game as it exists when you play it and training for the strategies that apply to the present.</p>

<p>Bill was as dominant in his era as anyone ever has been in any team sport on the continent and demonstrated across his career an ability to modulate his role and adjust his responsibilities to facilitate winning. He did just about everything that was available to be done during his career.</p>

<p>If what you want to hold against him was that he wasn&rsquo;t 60 years ahead of the game when no one could make him lose a game 7 in his entire life at the game he actually had an opportunity to play, that&rsquo;s fine; just remember to judge today&rsquo;s players by tomorrow&rsquo;s standards when the game continues to evolve.</p>

      <label for="lo5bha1" class="commentText"><p>Bill Russels ts% was below league average for his career.He had 3 seasons where he was somewhat efficient. Gobert has been much more efficient in this era than Bill was in his. I would understand the argument that he was sacrificing his scoring so he could win, but he literally couldnt score. Gobert is 2x the scorer Bill was. He was a player like Gobert that was built like MPJ. Theres no need to make up stuff that he was a good scorer, or that he was efficient. If you want to make an argument, than use his rings,his defense or rebounding, but dont try to make him into more than he actually was.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s reductive reasoning.  They aren&rsquo;t remotely similar as players besides being primarily known as defenders.</p>

<p>Russell&rsquo;s offense wasn&rsquo;t even limited.  People look at his TS% or PPG and think he&rsquo;s bad but relative to his era he was a average efficiency scorer who scored at a above average rate.  He was also a great passer especially in transition.  His offensive profile is similar to Draymond, Millsap or Horford, players who aren&rsquo;t gonna put up gaudy numbers but are still effective on offense.</p>

<p>Also it can&rsquo;t be understated how great Russell&rsquo;s defense was and how ahead of his time his understanding of defense was.  He was the only player back then that fully grasped how efficiency worked, understood how and when to blitz ball handlers and crafted different defensive coverages for different teams.  There&rsquo;s a reason why he was effective as both a coach and a player at the same time.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>People also constantly bring up his team to discredit him without considering context.  Fact of the matter is he was the dominant force behind by far the #1 defensive team for more than a decade.  His team&rsquo;s were often even average or below average offensively but it didn&rsquo;t matter because he was that great on defense and due that greatness, his teams can consistently win rings.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m not arguing that he&rsquo;s the GOAT, but saying he&rsquo;s a &ldquo;slightly better Gobert&rdquo; is again ridiculously disrespectful.</p>

      <label for="lo4i2or" class="commentText"><p>The 60s Celtics regularly ranked near the back of the league offensively.</p>

<p>Poor analogy with Steph. The Warriors always ranked at the top of the league defensively. His teammates (Klay, Dray, Iguodala, Bogut) were amazing defenders and around Curry, formed some of the league’s best defenses while Curry carried the offense.</p>

<p>Did Russell’s teammates make them a leading offense while he carried the defense?</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>Here’s the Celtics’ league ranking in offensive and defensive rating in every season Russell won a championship.</p>

<ul>
<li>‘57: 5th, 1st (out of 8)</li>
<li>‘59: 5th, 1st</li>
<li>‘60: 5th, 1st</li>
<li>‘61: 8th, 1st</li>
<li>‘62: 7th, 1st (out of 9)</li>
<li>‘63: 9th, 1st</li>
<li>‘64: 9th, 1st</li>
<li>‘65: 7th, 1st</li>
<li>‘66: 8th, 1st</li>
<li>‘68: 8th, 2nd (out of 12)</li>
<li>‘69: 10th, 1st (out of 14)</li>
</ul>

<p>Keen observers may notice that the Celtics never had an above average offense. Not once. So what exactly did that supporting cast carry them to?</p>

<p>They had the top ranked defense in the league in <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> championship seasons. Why? Bill.</p>

<li>The 2004 Pistons were an outlier. -3.7 rDRTG in 2003, -7.5 in 2004, -4.8 in 2005. So, a wise question is… why were they so much better? Was it because Ben Wallace was so much better in 2004 than he ever was before or after? Not really any evidence to support that.</li>
<li>Let’s compare that with the Celtics. <a href="https://thinkingbasketball.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Bos-Russell-D-vs-all-teams.png" target="_blank">Here’s a plot showing their rDRTG in the Russell seasons compared to all of NBA history</a>. Yeah.</li>

      <label for="lo4xqtj" class="commentText"><p>This is deceptive.  Wilt played with Elgin Baylor for a few years at the very end of Baylor&rsquo;s career.   And Wilt&rsquo;s prime was his 11 years with the Warriors and the 76ers, before he got to LA, and before his knees started giving out.   For his best years he was playing with Guy Rogers as his second best player on the team, i.e, with scrubs.</p>

<p>The brilliance of the 1960s Celtics dynasty had several sources: 1) Bill Russell, 2) a strong deep supporting roster that played together year after year and never had any roster turnover, and 3) the best coach in the league.  To give all the credit to Bill cheapens the accomplishments of the other 6 Celtics Hall of Famers of that era and the Celtics organization.</p>

<p>And if you are using Baylor and West as a head to head comparison, ask yourself how many seasons Wilt, Baylor and West were together while Bill Russell was leading the Celtics?  The answer is one.  One season.  1968-1969.   Wilt didn&rsquo;t go to the Lakers until 1968.   So it&rsquo;s not that useful.</p>

      <label for="lo4bj3b" class="commentText"><p>There were 8-12 teams during Bill Russell&rsquo;s era. That is literally all that needs to be said. Purely making your argument based on all-stars makes no sense. Somebody had to be an all-star. Like do we think Jamaal Magloire 1 time all star is better than Jamal Murray 0 time all star?</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s still a top 10 player of all time because of his legacy, importance to the game, and defensive dominance. But he has no real for GOAT. We can appreciate what he brought to the game, but the goat debate is only Lebron and Jordan.</p>

      <label for="lo4pstb" class="commentText"><p>The 8-12 team argument is always a bit weird to me. Even today, there’s only really 8-12 teams a year who have a legit shot to win a championship. Yes there are 30 teams, but your championship chances won’t change if teams like the Pistons, Wizards, Hornets, Bulls, Hawks, even good ones like the Cavs don’t exist. </p>

<p>To illustrate this point, imagine if the NBA decided to add like 30 new G league teams to make it a 60 team league. Sure there are twice as many teams, but it isn’t twice as hard to win. In fact, your chances won’t change at all since those 30 new teams have no chance. </p>

<p>Now over the long run, yes it will matter since teams can get better but over a 10 year run, it isn’t as big of a deal as it seems. The bigger issue to me has always been there was no free agency during this era, which meant players could not change teams. That to me is a much bigger thing than the 8-12 teams because those teams had a harder time getting better. </p>

      <label for="lo4rryd" class="commentText"><p>Yes but the player talent pool increased to support the 30 team league. Sure if you went straight from 8 teams to 30 in 1966 it would have been harder. But its not 1966, and there&rsquo;s enough talent worldwide to support the 30 teams. I think many expansion era periods kind of did have a level of watering down in talent. However, I think 2000s and on that normalized. And around 2014, there was a rapid increase in overall talent outside of the star players.</p>

<p>Outside of the Warriors 2017-2019, The West has been an 8-team bloodbath. I mean the 2014 Spurs got taken to 7 by a 49 win 8 seed. Multuple 8-1 seed upsets happened. Its just a different landscape now.</p>

      <label for="lo4smj2" class="commentText"><p>Right so the issue isn’t the 8-12 team league. The issue is the talent increased in basketball from the 1960s to today.</p>

<p>The 8-12 team league didn’t matter because even if there was 30 teams in 1960s, the Celtics would have the same chance at winning with 8-12 teams as with 30 teams because the new teams wouldn’t have the talent anyways to compete with the Celtics so it doesn’t change anything (especially with no free agency to move to these teams). </p>

<p>If that’s the issue I agree with you but I don’t think that’s a problem with the number of teams. That’s just a problem with the fact there weren’t as many people playing basketball and training for it in the 1960s compared to today so the overall level of talent was lower. </p>

<p>Even bad teams back then had a Hall of Famer or two on the roster. That&rsquo;s the nature of a super small league comprised of the best in the world. If 22 teams just collapsed today, one of the 8 remaining teams would still look like ass, despite being stacked as hell.</p>

      <label for="lo51f48" class="commentText"><p>Also worth noting that the Celtics didnt trash teams most years. More often they overachieved and won in the clutch by the skin of their teeth.</p>

<p>I mean, Russell won his last ring against Wilt, West, Elgin.</p>

<p>By the mid 60’s, talent had improved massively. Look at the 65 all star roster. Of the 20 players, 9 would be superstars today, and at least another 4 all stars. Im not blowing smoke:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1965_NBA_All-Star_Game" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1965_NBA_All-Star_Game</a></p>

<p>Superstars in any era: Russ, Wilt, Nate Thurmond, West, Oscar, Elgin, Willis Reed, Jerry Lucas, Bob Pettit.</p>

<p>Likely all stars: Gus Johnson, Walt Bellamy, Sam Jones, Hal Greer.</p>

<p>Biggest argument against Celtic Dynasty is that only had 8-14 (from memory) teams in the league in Russels 13 years, so fewer rounds to the playoffs.</p>

This new generation also laughably accuse Jordan of playing with weak competition. Regardless, the floor talent has risen.</p>

<p>It’s like me saying I’m a great athlete because I got 4 Varsity letters when the argument isn’t that I never did but that I’m overrated for getting so many letters because my school had 14 people in it.

      <label for="lo4rdfw" class="commentText"><p>1 per year is legit so much more than any other all time great.</p>

<p>Here are some other all time greats in how many of playoff series were competitive enough to be pushed to a game 7:</p>

<p>Michael Jordan: 37 playoff series 3 game sevens (8%)</p>

<p>Lebron James: 54 playoff series 8 game sevens (15%)</p>

<p>Magic Johnson: 40 playoff series 4 game sevens (10%)</p>

<p>Kobe Bryant: 43 playoff series 6 game sevens (14%)</p>

<p>Bill Russell: 29 playoff series 10 game sevens (34%)</p>

<p>Bill Russell’s playoff series were simply far more competitive than anyone else’s, yet somehow he never lost a game 7 when all the people I mentioned did</p>

<p>There are guys who are much better players in a team concept, and that&rsquo;s perfectly fine, and even preferable in most cases. But if we&rsquo;re going to call the guy the GOAT then I can&rsquo;t look past this</p>

<p>Only 3 players in NBA history have been the undisputed best player of their era: Kareem, MJ, and Lebron. I don’t really think there’s an argument for anyone else being GOAT.</p>

<p>Also, decades aren’t some dividing line in the league. There were players in his league that played throughout the 70’s. Some into the 80’s. NBA level talent is NBA talent. Eras are defined by who dominated and teams build rosters to accentuate, copy or try and stop who’s at the top</p>

      <label for="lo4tfgv" class="commentText"><p>I appreciate your post and I’ll happily support generational GOATs as a concept. However if you read the history of the time, there were enough teams and the guys just weren’t on the same level. Another thing that gets slept on until you read the Celtics historical stuff is that those teams were stacked so while Russell was undoubtedly their best player, he really didn’t have to carry much of the offensive workload and had to play significantly fewer playoff rounds/games.</p>

<p>I think of Russell like Ty Cobb or Cy Young or Walter Johnson or Bart Starr. Like the dudes were absolutely incredible but the 57-69 NBA bears very little resemblance to even the 80s much less today. You can call him the greatest winner of all time and that’s a pretty big compliment but GOAT feels like a stretch.</p>

<p>Wilt also played and dominated against those same guys including Kareem. Yet, people say Wilt was only dominant because he played against plumbers. I think most people put them Wilt and Russell side by side in top 10 debates, which is reasonable. I don&rsquo;t think either have a convincing argument over Jordan, Lebron, and imo Kareem.</p>

It&rsquo;s A LOT easier to win a title only beating out 7 other teams than 29.</p>

<p>IMO, those 11 titles are probably only equal to like 4-5 modern titles, and at that point I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s really in the GOAT argument at all.</p>

      <label for="lo4o6rs" class="commentText"><p>Idk for me, you can see Bill enter the league as one of the top players of his era in terms of efficiency and still pretty elite among his peers in terms of scoring and then that scoring goes down a smidge and his assist numbers go up.</p>

<p>If the goal of playing the sport of basketball is to win basketball games and win basketball championships, why should we look at the things Bill didn&rsquo;t do while winning that his peers did while failing to win and infer that he couldn&rsquo;t do them. I don&rsquo;t know that he could have averaged 50 ppg in a season, but it seems self evident to me that he chose to score less because his team didn&rsquo;t need that from him to win and they cared more about winning.</p>

<p>And considering he didn&rsquo;t just win more than anyone else in the history of the sport, but he won more than anyone else in the history of all North American sports (one other hockey guy also has 11 but did it in 20 years instead of 13) and the only two he lost were when he played on a cast and when he was a first year player coach who forgot to do substitutions and timeouts, I think people just want to be able to DQ him as the GOAT because it&rsquo;s not fun to think that the greatest player in your sport&rsquo;s history retired more than 50 years ago especially if the game has evolved and his highlights don&rsquo;t look like the new highlights do.</p>

<p>I feel like with evolutions in strategy and training and education and sports medicine and the resources well paid athletes have that prior eras didn&rsquo;t have access to, the only fair way to try to compare apples to oranges is to look at what they had the ability to do and what they actually did and by that metric there really isn&rsquo;t much more anyone could have possibly wanted from Bill. That doesn&rsquo;t have to mean he is the GOAT (he&rsquo;s not mine), but I don&rsquo;t think people who are ruling him out because of how he&rsquo;d compare to players in 2024 are considering what that&rsquo;s gonna mean for Jordan or Lebron in 2075</p>

      <label for="lo51bgs" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not trying to be snarky but the problem is you said Bill Russell went through all those players and teams. No he didn&rsquo;t. The Boston Celtics did. The question that still plagues Russell is how much did he benefit on being the best player on a dynasty team.</p>

<p>It seems to me that Russell is evaluated differently than every other MVP level player. For those players we evaluate them on the basis of being the type of player who takes over a game and dominates. With Russell we evaluate him on the basis of low well he blended into a system and played that role. Ironically Russell being the best winner and best team player in NBA history may disqualify him from being the GOAT.</p>

<p>Pointing to his winning is not a great metric for evaluating his greatness. He won 11 titles in 13 years. Ok, you know who the second greatest winner ever is? Sam Jones. He won 10 titles in 12 years.</p>

<p>With all the other great players on history I have the feeling that putting them on any other team you&rsquo;d still get the same career out of them. With Russell i think it is quite a reach to say if he was on any other team that team would be the dynasty the Celtics were so the main argument your making for Russell being the GOAT, his winning, actually disproves it.</p>

      <label for="lo4d765" class="commentText"><p>Throw Tatum into the league back then and i promise you hed be the best player in that era.</p>

<p>Bills argument is how much he won and his defensive impact.</p>

<p>The thing is that its super easy to be a great defender in a league full of guys with offensive limitations.</p>

<p>The only notable offensive force from the time was Wilt and the man averaged as much as he did simply because he was bigger and more athletic than almost everyone else.</p>

<p>But when faced with someone like Russel that could actually stand up to him, his numbers started looking far worse.</p>

<p>When you goat casse is built on the foundation of you being an amazing defender in a league full of mediocre at best offensive talent, then its a very shaky casse.</p>

<p>And if you wanna argue this point, just note that these guys averaged over 20 rebounds a game.</p>
