</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>In this series, we&rsquo;re going to take a look at some &ldquo;futures&rdquo; <a href="https://decider.com/2018/09/11/rounders-at-20-most-influential-gambling-movie/" target="_blank">bets</a> to gauge the best picks for different awards. Now, these aren&rsquo;t pure predictions as much as indications of value. Someone may be the most likely pick to win MVP at 5:1 odds, but if another player has nearly as good of a chance and is listed at 50:1, that longshot is the better &ldquo;bet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been running this series for three years now and have had some surprising success.</p>

<p>In 2021: if you bet <span class="math inline">\(100 on each post, you'd have made \)</span>2,000 profit, buoyed by Tyler Herro winning <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ph5khd/oc_the_best_bet_series_predicting_the_sixth_man/" target="_blank">Sixth Man of the Year</a>.</p>

<p>In 2022: if you bet <span class="math inline">\(100 on each post, you'd have made another \)</span>2,000 in profit, buoyed by Mike Brown&rsquo;s trophy for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/xm19cz/oc_best_bet_series_predicting_the_coach_of_the/" target="_blank">Coach of the Year</a>.</p>

<p>Last year: if you bet <span class="math inline">\(100 one each post, you'd have made... \)</span>25 in profit. Sooo&hellip; basically enough for a chipotle burrito and guac. But still, a profit is a profit, so let&rsquo;s see if we can keep the streak going this year. For each category, I&rsquo;ll take a look at some viable candidates first, and then make an official recommendation at the end.</p>

<hr>

<p>######<strong>STUDYING THE TRENDS</strong></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no shortage of discussions regarding the NBA MVP trophy, but if there&rsquo;s any trend that may be overlooked, it&rsquo;s the idea that chasing the award has become a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/c23gl4/has_chasing_the_mvp_become_a_young_mans_game/" target="_blank">young man&rsquo;s game</a>.</p>

<p>Consider the case of the 1990s when this trend was perhaps most notable. During that decade, there were more MVP trophy winners in their 30s than in their 20s. In fact, the youngest MVP winner was 27 (Michael Jordan in 1991). As a whole, the average age of the MVP winner that decade was 30.8. If you think including 90s Jordan throws off the curve too much, the average age of a non-Jordan MVP was actually older still, at 31.2.</p>

<p>Ever since we hit the year 2000, there hasn&rsquo;t been much love for the 30-somethings. The old men are usually resting for the playoffs rather than chasing award trophies. In fact, Steve Nash is the last 30 year old to win MVP, all the way back in 2006.</p>

<hr>

<p>######<strong>THE PRIME SUSPECTS</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also fun to create fantasy narratives for long shots, but the truth of the matter is, the &ldquo;bar&rdquo; to win MVP is extremely high &ndash; especially these days. The top superstars are putting up historically good stats on historically good efficiency. They&rsquo;re in the MVP conversation year in and year out, and that won&rsquo;t change barring injury.</p>

<p>That certainly applies to reigning MVP <strong>Nikola Jokic</strong> (+400). We touted him last year at +425 and that paid off. Yet somehow, despite his third MVP trophy, he <em>still</em> seems underrated here. +400 odds (meaning you bet <span class="math inline">\(100 to win \)</span>400) implies that Jokic would win an MVP in 1 out of 5 seasons. In reality, he&rsquo;s won MVP in 3 out of 4 seasons. At age 29, there&rsquo;s not much reason to think his fortune will change substantially. If he stays healthy, he&rsquo;s absolutely going to be in the mix again.</p>

<p>Other heavy hitters and former winners who will return to the spotlight include <strong>Giannis Antetokoumpo</strong> (+650) and <strong>Joel Embiid</strong> (+750). They&rsquo;ve both proven that they can reach the MVP threshold themselves. They&rsquo;re both on teams that can contend for a top 2 seed. For both, and especially for Joel Embiid, the key will be staying fit and healthy for 70+ games this year.</p>

<p>In terms of their NBA careers, these three superstars (Jokic, Giannis, and Embiid) are all in the thick of the historic primes. However, the question is: are they started to crest over the edge of that? As mentioned before, no 30 year old has won MVP since 2006. All three (Jokic, Giannis, and Embiid) would be 30 by the time this MVP is announced. Either they&rsquo;re going to break the streak &ndash; or they&rsquo;re going to hand the baton off to the next generation.</p>

<hr>

<p>######<strong>STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION</strong></p>

<p>For years, we&rsquo;ve all presumed that <strong>Luka Doncic</strong> (+370) would be the next man up. In fact, he&rsquo;s the preseason favorite for MVP for the 4th season out of the last 5 despite never actually winning or even being a runner-up before. It will happen eventually, we all presume. But the danger here is: if it didn&rsquo;t happen <em>last</em> year (when he shot a career high 38% from 3 and averaged 34-9-10), when will it? For Doncic, it may take a # 1 or # 2 seed to finally get over the hump.</p>

<p>One team and one player standing in the way of that top seed will be Oklahoma City and <strong>Shai Gilgeous-Alexander</strong> (+550). Gilgeous-Alexander averaged 30-6-6 last season and finished as the runner-up to Jokic. SGA&rsquo;s statistical profile may have peaked &ndash; and his team may have peaked with the # 1 seed. In theory. But last year, OKC won the top seed based on a tie-breaker against Denver. This season, their superior depth may allow them to sprint ahead and grab the # 1 seed by 5+ games. More than anything else, that would be SGA&rsquo;s best campaign lane.</p>

<p>Of course, grabbing the # 1 seed by 10+ games didn&rsquo;t help <strong>Jayson Tatum</strong> (+2000) that much last year. Despite the best record in the league, he only finished 6th in MVP voting. Still, Tatum is always going to be in the All-NBA conversation because he&rsquo;s going to put up good stats on a great team. If Jokic or Doncic suffer an injury, he could end up being a serious candidate for MVP, too. The question with Tatum is whether or not he has another level in him or whether he&rsquo;s plateaued. Now entering Year 8, he may be closer to a finished product than others.</p>

<p>In contrast, most bettors think that there&rsquo;s still another leap ahead for Minnesota star <strong>Anthony Edwards</strong> (+1200). The idea that Minnesota can grab the # 1 seed is feasible. But in terms of playmaking and efficiency, the 23 year old still has some ground to make up on the elite of the elite. On the bright side, this whole group (Doncic, SGA, Tatum, Edwards) is firmly in their 20s which is right in the thick of the recent historic trends for MVP winners.</p>

<hr>

<p>######<strong>OLD DOGS</strong></p>

<p>As mentioned repeatedly already, MVP winners tend to be younger these days. The salty old dogs are too busy resting their weary bones and preparing for the playoffs.</p>

<p>Still, out of respect, let&rsquo;s throw out the numbers for some legends like <strong>Steph Curry</strong> (+5500), <strong>Kevin Durant</strong> (+8000), <strong>Kawhi Leonard</strong> (+10000), and <strong>LeBron James</strong> (+15000). That is, by far, the highest odds LeBron James has ever had for an MVP trophy. I&rsquo;m not going to defy the trends enough to bet on any of those individually, although perhaps Steph Curry would be the most appealing out of this pack. If the Warriors can rise up back into the top 4 range without Klay Thompson, all the love and narrative would tip back in Curry&rsquo;s direction.</p>

<hr>

<p>######<strong>PLANTING THE SEED</strong></p>

<p>While Jayson Tatum didn&rsquo;t win the MVP last season despite the best record in the league (by far), that still represents a solid path to a campaign victory. Allen Iverson won the MVP trophy as a # 1 seed. Dirk Nowitzki won the MVP trophy as a # 1 seed. Derrick Rose won then MVP trophy as a # 1 seed. With all due respect to those three, I don&rsquo;t believe anyone thought they were the BEST player in the league at the time, but they got a tip of the cap and a trophy for their regular season and team accomplishments.</p>

<p>The same could apply to a number of other candidates, including: <strong>Jalen Brunson</strong> (+1800), <strong>Ja Morant</strong> (+2500), <strong>Donovan Mitchell</strong> (+10000), <strong>Devin Booker</strong> (+12500), <strong>Zion Williamson</strong> (+12500), and even <strong>Trae Young</strong> (+15000) or <strong>Paolo Banchero</strong> (+30000) if you want to get wild.</p>

<p>The most interesting darkhorse bet may end up being <strong>Victor Wembanyama</strong>, but he&rsquo;s actually not much of a dark horse anymore at +1000 odds (10:1). In fact, that&rsquo;s the 6th highest on the entire board. It&rsquo;s possible that Wemby leaps up into the MVP discussion in Year 2 like LeBron James and Luka Doncic did, but the Spurs would likely need at least a .500 record to make him truly viable.</p>

<hr>

<p>######<strong>AT LONG LAST, THE OFFICIAL PICK IS&hellip;</strong></p>

<p>This is one of the more difficult races to project. Honestly, my strongest hunch here is that we&rsquo;ll get a wide-open and widely-debated race throughout the course of the year. The votes could be split off between 4-5 candidates.</p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s a muddled race down the stretch, I like the odds for <strong>Shai Gilgeous-Alexander</strong> (+550) to win by a nose. Logically speaking, he checks almost every box. He&rsquo;s 26 years old, which is right in the meaty part of the MVP curve. He&rsquo;s going to anchor a team that will likely win a # 1 seed. And unlike other presumptive top seed Jayson Tatum (who has Jaylen Brown as Option 1B), Gilgeous-Alexander is the clear star in his team&rsquo;s pecking order. In terms of weighing odds and payouts, SGA appears to be the smartest bet on the board.</p>
