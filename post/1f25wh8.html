<p>ETA: Because nobody can read, I really feel the need to point out I‚Äôm not saying those guys were bad. They were extremely good. That‚Äôs literally the whole point of the comment. That they were so good despite not having much in the way of physical advantages over everyone in this allegedly unbelievably physically hard era. You can all stop telling me how good they were.</p>

<p>Stockton was listed at 170 lbs. Other defensive guards like Gary Payton were 180 lbs, Dumars was 190, Blaylock was 180, Jordan 198.</p>

<p>Compare that to now, Ant is 225, Jrue is 229, Smart is 220, Dort 215. All that strength while having the quickness to chase guys around screens on the perimeter. You put these guys in the 90s, let them hand check and push players around, they&rsquo;d easily won dpoy every year.</p>

<p>Exactly. If these guys can, not only survive, but be the best defensive guards of that era, I don&rsquo;t see the reason why guys from today wouldn&rsquo;t survive the physicality of that era.</p>

Drexler was 225.  There‚Äôs other defensive guards back then that were in the 200+ range like Alvin Robertson, Dennis Johnson.  Guys like Bobby Phills and jim Jackson were all in the 6‚Äô5 6‚Äô6 220-225 range as well.  Mitch Richmond, Isaiah rider were big guards too 220+ and posted up smaller guards quite often.</p>

<p>But yes players have gotten more muscular.  Part of this is the standard strength training programs every team has for its players</p>

<p>His point is that if smaller, less bulky guards like Stockton could be elite on both ends during the most physical era of basketball, then a guard like Ant or Jrue would more than have the physical tools and toughness to compete.

      <label for="lk4okww" class="commentText"><p>I know everyone else is getting all bent out of shape trying to act like you were saying Stockton and Price were bad, which is a silly misinterpretation. But I do want to point out that the 20 years ago time frame brought up by KG is after each of them had retired.</p>

<p>20 years ago saw AI, McGrady, Michael Redd, Jamaal Magloire, Brad Miller, Sam Cassell, and Steve Francis as All Stars. I loved some of those guys as players (and don&rsquo;t get me wrong, they&rsquo;d all be able to play in today&rsquo;s NBA) but this wasn&rsquo;t the same level of physicality that was saw with, say, the Bad Boy Pistons. AI wasn&rsquo;t dirty like Isiah or Stockton. Brad Miller and Magloire were talented but not like Ewing/Hakeem/Robinson/etc. missing out on All-NBA Third Team while getting MVP votes because center was insanely stacked as a position.</p>

<p>The 2000s had some all-time great players (KG himself, Shaq, Duncan, Nowitzki, Kobe, AI, Yao, etc.) but it wasn&rsquo;t such a dominant time that the current crop of players couldn&rsquo;t compete. Mehmet Okur was an All-Star in 2007. We&rsquo;re not even in a great era for center depth (the top tier is elite, at least) and there&rsquo;s no way an Okur level of skill would make an All-Star team right now using the rules/playstyles from either decade. Edwards made a dumb comment, but KG is also being silly here.</p>

      <label for="lk49ano" class="commentText"><p>Right, and you know what happened after Karl Malone hit guys with a common foul? Guy gets up, shoots FTs, keeps playing. Do you expect modern guards to curl up in a ball and cry when they cop hard fouls and don‚Äôt see guys getting a flagrant for it?</p>

      <label for="lk4pbv9" class="commentText"><p>John Stockton might not have been blazing fast or athletic but he when a player says people in that era where more physical, you probably shouldn‚Äôt pick one of the most durable players of all time as an example to disapprove it.</p>

<p>Players don‚Äôt get physically beat up anywhere near as much as they used to but don‚Äôt come close to playing a full season. Stockton missed 22 games in 19 seasons. Kind of proving the point that players back then might have been less athletic but where physically more durable/stronger</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s one of the reasons I think Time Machine scenarios are silly. If you bring any team from 20+ years ago, as they were, straight to today, they would get blitzed and smacked around by most of the teams nowadays simply due to the evolution of the game. Good luck trying to beat anyone in 2024 shooting 9 threes a game.</p>

<p>¬†I‚Äôm not sure that his comments are positive or indicative of anything being better than they are today. Social media keeps people more honest than back then and this generation of players have grown up with it since children. Of course the locker room is a different place.¬†</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not sure you understand where he came from but you can always read his bio on Wikipedia. I guarantee almost no NBA player today had to go through what he went through as a youngster, which is why he was so tough and could play at that height.¬†</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt disagree with what you are trying to say but the example doesn‚Äôt make much sense if you are going only by his height.¬†</p>

<p>A much better example would be Dell Curry, and that makes more sense too since his two sons are playing in today‚Äôs era.¬†</p>

It was obviously a different style of game but if you raised any of these players in that same environment they‚Äôd thrive. All time greats would be great in any era but the players now are objectively just better at basketball than previous generations. In 20 or 50 years the players will be better than now. In any sort of competitive environment people will always continue to improve over time.</p>

Honestly not sure which era gets the credit for him, but I think it&rsquo;s fair to note that one of the only contenders for GOAT is literally showing how great players can evolve to work in multiple eras of the sport.</p>

<p>Are there some outliers? Yes. Always felt Reggie Miller&rsquo;s game would work so much better now; Blake Griffin once had a season where he attempted more 3s per game than Reggie did in any year for his entire career. He only took more than 6 per game once. And he&rsquo;s still fifth all-time in 3-pt makes. He played forever and was never really hurt. His shooting numbers would have been wild in the modern era.¬†</p>

<p>Even the &ldquo;bruisers&rdquo; like Mahorn and Laimbeer were ~240, that&rsquo;s the same as Cody Zeller and Mike Muscala.  You think players like Jokic, Beef Stew, Nurkic, Reid, Valanciunas, Giannis and Bam are gonna be intimidated by those guys just cause they talk shit and play dirty?</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe best fantasy is written in the language of dreams. It is alive as dreams are alive, more real than real &hellip; for a moment at least &hellip; that long magic moment before we wake.</p>

<p>Fantasy is silver and scarlet, indigo and azure, obsidian veined with gold and lapis lazuli. Reality is plywood and plastic, done up in mud brown and olive drab. Fantasy tastes of habaneros and honey, cinnamon and cloves, rare red meat and wines as sweet as summer. Reality is beans and tofu, and ashes at the end. Reality is the strip malls of Burbank, the smokestacks of Cleveland, a parking garage in Newark. Fantasy is the towers of Minas Tirith, the ancient stones of Gormenghast, the halls of Camelot. Fantasy flies on the wings of Icarus, reality on Southwest Airlines. Why do our dreams become so much smaller when they finally come true?</p>

<p>We read fantasy to find the colors again, I think. To taste strong spices and hear the songs the sirens sang. There is something old and true in fantasy that speaks to something deep within us, to the child who dreamt that one day he would hunt the forests of the night, and feast beneath the hollow hills, and find a love to last forever somewhere south of Oz and north of Shangri-La.</p>

<p>They can keep their heaven. When I die, I&rsquo;d sooner go to middle Earth.‚Äù

      <label for="lk5esh9" class="commentText"><p>It is somewhat related. Whenever the NBA Finals are still in session and not yet won everyone has a fantasy about their team winning. The players themselves have a fantasy in their minds about winning.</p>

<p>And then it is won.</p>

<p>And then we move on.</p>

<p>The reality of the victory not quite measuring up to the euphoria that preceded it.</p>

      <label for="lk771xk" class="commentText"><p>he writes a decent book but I can&rsquo;t disagree with this quote more. By way of counterpoint - &ldquo;Large Red Man Reading&rdquo; by Wallace Stevens:</p>

<p>There were ghosts that returned to earth to hear his phrases,
As he sat there reading, aloud, the great blue tabulae.
They were those from the wilderness of stars that had expected more.</p>

<p>There were those that returned to hear him read from the poem of life,
Of the pans above the stove, the pots on the table, the tulips among them.
They were those that would have wept to step barefoot into reality,</p>

<p>That would have wept and been happy, have shivered in the frost
And cried out to feel it again, have run fingers over leaves
And against the most coiled thorn, have seized on what was ugly</p>

<p>And laughed, as he sat there reading, from out of the purple tabulae,
The outlines of being and its expressings, the syllables of its law:
Poesis, poesis, the literal characters, the vatic lines,</p>

<p>Which in those ears and in those thin, those spended hearts,
Took on color, took on shape and the size of things as they are
And spoke the feeling for them, which was what they had lacked.</p>

      <label for="lk4s4ir" class="commentText"><p>To be fair though - Kd, LeBron, Curry all touched the era that KG is talking about and are still dominating today&rsquo;s players, and they&rsquo;re mostly dominating because of the jump shot, while all being really great finishers every season. Then you have guys like Holiday and Horford who are top role players still. They don&rsquo;t call travels and carries much, but then on the other side, you can replace physicality with really elaborate defensive schemes. I think a bunch of guys from this era would struggle but also a bunch of their guys wouldn&rsquo;t last today - their era basically ended when the Warriors cooked the slow teams shooting middies. Ironically Edwards would probably be better with a football background just barreling into people. No matter the era, it&rsquo;s gonna be tougher for other guys to compete for some new reason.</p>

      <label for="lk4tf92" class="commentText"><p>The league is definitely more talented today. The late 90s and early 2000s were especially rough. Everyone wanted to copy MJ, iso, 2pt. jump shot era. So many inefficient chuckers. Final scores in the Easter conference were often in the 60s and 70s.</p>

<p>The only teams that played attractive basketball were the C-Webb kings and Nash&rsquo;s Suns. The only thing worse now is the officiating and soft whistle. League has gone too far the other way. But in every skill aspect, the league is better today.</p>

      <label for="lk4zf5j" class="commentText"><p>I do think the league is more skilled, specifically I think the skill floor of the league is much higher.</p>

<p>But I think people often confuse skill with regulation and the whistle. Antman couldnt touch the ball back in the 90s without being called for a travel lol. A lot of the &ldquo;skill&rdquo; that people use to differentiate the modern NBA from before is just a change in how the game is called. Give any of the 90s superstars the same whistle and I guarantee they could do the same shit</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the exact same reason we&rsquo;ve seen scoring explode with defence being unable to stop it. Wtf is a defender supposed to do when a player can literally stop the ball mid air with their hand under the ball, and then continue the dribble. Or literally just take an extra step. That&rsquo;s unstoppable</p>

In a playoff series you go cold jacking up threes you&rsquo;re done.  Whereas a power game inside will never reach the high end of a team thats shooting well from 3&hellip;  It will be more consistent.</p>

<p>James Harden&rsquo;s playoff choke jobs are an indictment of the jack up the 3 ball a 1000 times game.</p>

      <label for="lk5i4k2" class="commentText"><p>It was consistent. Consistently bad.</p>

<p>The narrative you‚Äôre sharing is the one that teams held onto in the mid-‚Äò10s when the 3 point revolution started. As if it was consistency vs volatility. But a good 3 point shooting team is not actually that much more volatile. Offenses score a lot of points, consistently, when they shoot lots of 3s. That‚Äôs why everyone shoots lots of 3s now. The brief period in the ‚Äò10s when some teams were shooting 3s and some weren‚Äôt saw the teams that weren‚Äôt shooting get obliterated. ‚ÄúWhat happens if your shot goes cold‚Äù is that you hope the other team isn‚Äôt shooting 3s, because you still might win if your opponent is prioritizing ‚Äúthe power game‚Äù.</p>

<p>To give you a sense of how much things have changed, the team that shot the fewest 3s this year shot 31.6 per game. That is what the 2015 Warriors shot when they and the Rockets ‚Äúrevolutionized‚Äù the game by prioritizing 3s. And the team that shot the fewest 3s in that 2015 season shot 15.6 per game. That is just a hair below what the ‚Äò96 Bulls shot.</p>

<p>The teams that prioritized consistency over ‚Äúvolatility‚Äù from 3s all got massacred because they were fucking bad. It is a dumb strategy that isn‚Äôt based on math. And so the teams that said ‚Äúyeah you fucking nerds don‚Äôt understand that I need the stability of post touches over the volatility of an effective 3 pointer‚Äù died.</p>

      <label for="lk4pke1" class="commentText"><p>So much of that, though, is down to a lack of spacing/modern offense. If you plugged in whatever current &ldquo;soft&rdquo; team that you wanted, they&rsquo;d manage to still look like a functional offense against the defensive juggernauts of that era. That championship Pistons team was fun, but a product of a time where the entire league was around its slowest pace and teams couldn&rsquo;t pull Ben Wallace away from the basket. In recent years, you have fans clowning on Gobert because he gets brought out to the perimeter and sometimes gets blown by&hellip; teams now could do that exact same thing to Wallace in his prime. Current defenses are much more versatile and have to be markedly more mobile than mid-2000s defenses did.</p>

      <label for="lk6ve1f" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d argue that modern offenses are much more complex than just relying on drive and kick. You&rsquo;ve got Denver and Sacramento regularly running the offense through having a center at the high post hanging out with the ball and not driving while everyone else makes off-ball cuts. The Warriors went the better part of a decade having great offenses based on off-ball movement, rather than a heliocentric guard running into the paint and dishing to guys camped on the perimeter. Even though the 76ers have wanted to shift to more Maxey drives, the offense really revolves around Embiid, who rarely goes that route.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/drives?SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;dir=D&amp;sort=DRIVES" target="_blank">https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/drives?SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;dir=D&amp;sort=DRIVES</a></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s the teams&rsquo; drives per game, and outside of the Thunder (with SGA) and Pacers (with Haliburton and McConnell&rsquo;s weird style), most good teams just aren&rsquo;t relying on one driver controlling the offense and making it about them penetrating. The Knicks are the next highest competitive team on that list, and Brunson is driving more to get himself into spots to use his stops/footwork and make insane shots around bigger defenders than the classic drive and kick.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/drives?SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;dir=D&amp;sort=DRIVES" target="_blank">https://www.nba.com/stats/players/drives?SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;dir=D&amp;sort=DRIVES</a></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s player drives per game, and outside of a couple crazy outliers, most guys aren&rsquo;t driving more than about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> of the possessions where they are initiating offense. Disappointingly, we don&rsquo;t have tracking data going back that long, but even looking at a decade ago&hellip; it&rsquo;s the same story. You have a handful of guys (Ty Lawson, Jeff Teague in his ATL days, and Tony Parker) who are driving a ton, while talented folks like Chris Paul, Kemba, Derrick Rose, John Wall, and Westbrook simply have it as a backup option.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s just so much diversity of offensive sets that to suggest a sizable amount of it comes down to drive and kick that&rsquo;d be shut down by hand checking seems like it&rsquo;d be hyper-focused on a specific roster. Like, that seems somewhat true of the SGA-lead Thunder&hellip; but also, SGA is an incredible outlier within the NBA talent pool at being able to create space between himself and his defender while also making good decisions when he runs into traffic. No other team is as drive-reliant, but 20 years ago, Shai would have been getting past guys regardless. He&rsquo;s an infinitely better ballhandler than you or I will ever be and consistently put up crazy numbers in the playoffs when teams are gameplanning specifically to shut him down.</p>

      <label for="lk5m0qy" class="commentText"><p>The rulings did change. A step back in the modern era allows you to push off the front foot and jump backwards. Because players are allowed to land with both feet, they are squared and are given more room. A step back in previous eras only allowed players to take one step backwards with the non pivot before it was called a travel. This made the stepback a harder shot as the shooter wouldn&rsquo;t be squared as easily and there would be less room.</p>

<p>What the league did was redefine the gather. The result was this looser acceptance of legal movement</p>

Like, a lot of the &ldquo;skill&rdquo; we respect today was either illegal, would have got you benched, or wouldn&rsquo;t have been as effective since defense could get in your shorts. Other skills we demand today, especially for bigs, were not a thing then. So to say players are more skilled today is to compare them with players playing a different game. By definition they are not &lsquo;less&rsquo; skilled.</p>

<p>Another way to put it, if you applied the same rules (making the gather step/step backs/eurosteps illegal; allowing greater defensive physicality) then many of the so-called &lsquo;more&rsquo; skilled players today would have half their game eliminated.</p>

<p>His major point 1: You can&rsquo;t say people are &lsquo;more skilled&rsquo; now, because the game is different. Their &lsquo;skills&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed 30 years ago, and they lack many skills that players had 30 years ago&hellip; because the game is totally different.</p>

<p>If you came down and took a 30 footer 5 seconds into the shot clock, you&rsquo;d be benched and never play again. If you did a Harden stepback, you&rsquo;d be called for traveling. Etc.</p>

<p>His major point 2: The locker rooms were much more intense and gate keepy. They weren&rsquo;t coddling or welcoming to people a lot of the time. You essentially had to steal someone&rsquo;s job. KG really got messed with as a rookie. Guys as big as ZBo got power slammed onto the cement floor in a locker room. You had to play 82 games. You couldn&rsquo;t hog the ball. Etc.</p>

<p>Their point about a lot of kids having better family situations plays into it today too.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, he&rsquo;s right. He was much more nuanced and thoughtful than Ant was. He just didn&rsquo;t get it across as well as he could have.</p>

<p>You take a softer 19-year-old from today, who has only learned individual skills, and put him in 1996, odds are they don&rsquo;t last. They could be broken mentally in the locker room, or be absolutely hamstrung by the coach for taking bad shots and playing in a way that wouldn&rsquo;t translate to the game back then. They&rsquo;d have no midrange or post game to fall back on. They&rsquo;d be so fucked.</p>

<p>The level of talent from 1st guy to last on every roster now is probably more skilled than 1st guy to last guy on a team 30 years ago, but lots of incredibly skilled players existed, and their skill set is completely different than today.</p>

      <label for="lk49aot" class="commentText"><p>Ant is running his stupid mouth because he got the media covered as &ldquo;the next American star&rdquo;. Medical science and training technology are far more advanced now; you can not compare between eras. Ant can do what he does and have the platform to shit his shit because of the previous era.</p>

<p>but I also dont agree with KG. Players today play like this because of the environment. if you put them in the league 20 years ago. A lot of them would adapt, and some of them would surely thrive.</p>

<p>there&rsquo;s a lack of creativity in today&rsquo;s game compared to 2000s</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a wild take. The 2000s, as a decade, is literally the slowest paced decade in NBA history. Teams were all doing slow-it-down iso sets constantly. Even when they didn&rsquo;t have the players to effectively pull that off. Like the Harden Rockets could eventually get an incredibly strong offense out of excessive Harden isos&hellip; but the 2006 Blazers attempting only 76 field goals for 89 points a game was not a winning strategy. The team averaged 18 assists per game. Nobody should have to watch Juan Dixon as the 4th highest minutes on a team (and second for guards) with an AST:TO ratio of 2:1.5. That showed a lack of creativity. Teams nowadays have all different styles of offensive sets, need to have adaptable defenses because other teams will constantly throw new things at them to throw off the defense, and have dramatically different roster constructions (from double big to small ball, from high-usage guards to DHO/offensive hub bigs, etc.)</p>

<p>The 2010s did have adjustments, as we went from the dark ages to the pace and space era&hellip; but I can&rsquo;t figure any way to defend the idea that the 2000s had anything resembling creativity compared to other decades of basketball.</p>

He‚Äôs saying there‚Äôs a bigger leash on players now where guys like harden and Luka can just dribble the air out of the ball and play in a heliocentric offense, don‚Äôt need to really know and memorize offense and defensive game plans, teams are surrounded by youngins because there‚Äôs a huge lack of veterans on teams to mentor/guide players etc..</p>

<p>You‚Äôre mythologizing the 90‚Äôs as some kind of golden era where everyone played amazing defense and fought like lions at mid-court simply because they were better. In reality, a vast majority of the changes were simply in mindset and priorities, which would be baked into the players by the time they got to high school.</p>

<p>The reason players flop and whine isn‚Äôt because they‚Äôre objectively weaker people. They flop and whine because, as it turns out, foul baiting is a very powerful tactic. Abusing it is statistically a great way to play, so players learn to rely on it and get upset if it doesn‚Äôt work. If you put that in the 90‚Äôs, you‚Äôd see the league playing out the same way.</p>

<p>The players aren‚Äôt the problem. The rules are, and they influence how those players grow and change.</p>

      <label for="lk4kg4w" class="commentText"><p>Just because players play the game the way it is now doesn&rsquo;t mean they couldn&rsquo;t play the way it was played back then. Some definitely couldn&rsquo;t, but you can&rsquo;t just make a blanket statement like that. The game has changed, for better or worse, but if you take any player from back in the day and plop them in today&rsquo;s game, I&rsquo;m almost certain they would play like today&rsquo;s players do.</p>

      <label for="lk4v0mc" class="commentText"><p>This only happens in the NBA.  Young guys disrespecting the old guys before them.  Those plumbers and fireman put the league on their back for these kids to make 100‚Äôs of millions of dollars.  Nobody in baseball says Babe, Hank, Willie had less skill. Nobody in football said LT, Reggie White, Marino and Montana had less skill.  No other sport does this except the NBA.  Respect the eras. Enjoy the top level skill now and enjoy that HUGE paycheck.  NBA has been fun to watch regardless of year or era.  Watching Jordan overcome the Pistons was awesome. Watching Shaq and Kobe was awesome.  Watching Curry shoot lights out, awesome.  Been fun watching the NBA since the 90‚Äôs regardless of skill and physicality.</p>

      <label for="lk5tb28" class="commentText"><p>I mean he is speaking truth from experience. Main reason it won‚Äôt resonate with most people here is because more times than not these subs are filled with a younger generation of fans. Y‚Äôall gotta understand how even the most underdog team back then would put the work in now, one main example the 2004 pistons, a good chunk of y‚Äôall were toddlers or not even born. That team beat the power house lakers, that team beat a laker team with 4 first ballot hall of famers, Shaq, Kobe, Malone, Payton. Not to mention a team like the Kings, Nets, Rockets, teams that would weren‚Äôt on the top of the totem poll but would for bust some ass nowadays.</p>
