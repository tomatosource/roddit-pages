      <label for="lh7wihp" class="commentText"><p>I feel he also believes he is better now.</p>

<p>If you listen to these older guys interviews, especially LeBron, they will almost never say they were better players when they were younger, instead they&rsquo;ll talk about mentally leveling up due to experience and being better now.</p>

<p>Durant might also believe LeBron is better, I saw him talking about how LeBron has become much more skilled in his older age.</p>

<p>The 2024 team does feel more rounded out with an MVP level Center and AD to back him up, and if you listen to KD interviews he is very high on both of them.</p>

<p>He also has a teammate here, in Booker, that he loves compared to however he feels about Westbrook now.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s not surprising he believes this team is the best.</p>

      <label for="lh7yc9f" class="commentText"><p>Yeah for sure, I’ve always felt you gotta wait for guys to be retired or at least further along before you can get their honest opinion on things</p>

<p>I remember LeBron saying that he thought his 2020 version was his best. Like, I get it, but nah lol. Very curious to see what he’ll consider his peak after he retires.</p>

<p>Another example that interested me was KCP saying that the 2023 Nuggets &amp;gt; 2020 Lakers. Easy to say when you played for the Nuggets - I wonder if he’ll maintain that belief later on, though.</p>

<p>Point is, yeah I agree.</p>

Heat Lebron was a beast, but he had a great team around him. 2018 was the true LeThanos year—hard carrying every night, game winner after game winner, dropping 51 on like 80% TS in game 1 against GSW’s all star team. He was a basketball terminator.</p>

      <label for="lh7z7er" class="commentText"><p>Agreed. A lot of these players would rectify a lot of their takes after a few years.</p>

<p>Having played in such a high intensity game where they manage to ward off adversity also plays a part for the Durant take.</p>

<p>It also probably has to do a bit with ego, it&rsquo;s difficult for such high level athletes to believe that they are getting worse unless there is a huge drop-off in their game or athleticism.</p>

Team USA always has a physical advantage up and down the roster. There are more playable guys and fewer playable minutes. No 82 game season, no 7 game series. No bloated, long term extensions to worry about. It’s the perfect environment for experience to shine.</p>

      <label for="lh8apk3" class="commentText"><p>Absolutely. I’m 31 now but can still remember each and every teammate I had growing up in my teens. The summer training camps we went to, the sneaking out with the girls team, the wins and the losses, the jokes, and the love of it all. It’s like having 15 extra brothers that spent everyday together for years.</p>

<p>Also, I have a silly theory people who played team sports are better drivers cause we are trained to know where every player (car) around you is at all times, what they’re likely next move will be based on the current situation, and how to react smoothly and “with the flow”.</p>

      <label for="lh8bhte" class="commentText"><p>For real you know KD, Curry, and Lebron have respected each other for the longest time. They bring it every time they match up in the regular season. They always tried to team up when it’s ASW too. To have them all at the end of their primes have one last go around, playing at the highest level, and showcasing all their talents in a huge game on the global stage - that’s got to be special. This may be their last time playing together at this level, and it might be all of their last Olympic game. It’s definitely bittersweet</p>

People misunderstood that and thought he meant literally just randomly chucking up the ball or picking a random player to iso every time.</p>

There was a possession where SGA pushed him off to get separation, got called for a foul but Aleksa still returned and blocked his shot, just as the whistle was getting blown. Dude is a stud and a late bloomer too unfortunately, he rounded up into who he is as a <sup>27</sup>&frasl;<sub>28</sub> year old.</p>

<p>This version of him, I believe would be a solid NBA player, but because he wasn’t anywhere near it at a younger age, I doubt he’ll ever get a chance. But he would be a solid guard off the bench for any team, I am 100% sure of it.</p>

Micic had one of his worst games in recent memory and while Aleksa was going off Bogi and Jokic had better games in their lives, just to name the most obvious examples.</p>

<p>Serbia played amazing, no question and team USA looked ass at times on defense, but its really hard to overcome that difference in individual quality for a team like serbia, they simply ran out of steam in the 4th, you could really see it imo. The same thing happend to them at the 96 olympics when they were leading through 3 quarters against a team with shaq, glove, stokton, mailman, pip, grant hill, penny, hakeem, miller, charles and ehoever the fuck I forgot.</p>

<p>that Steph 3 for the lead, Embiid wanted it, LeBron looked at him like nah set the screen for Steph</p>

      <label for="lh7suui" class="commentText"><p>I think this is why Kerr has not played Tatum in a point forward role like LeBron, which a lot of fans have been demanding.</p>

<p>Tatum, over the years, has leveled up as a passer but I would still describe him as a system passer where with time and chemistry he became better at making reads and decisions in the Celtics system.</p>

<p>In comparison LeBron is an instinctive passer who doesn&rsquo;t need too much chemistry or hard sets and his feel for the game allows him to make all these decisions.</p>

<p>Tatum should definitely get SOME playing time, though. People point to Haliburton as a perfect example of a team player by supporting his teammates with great vibes - but Tatum and Haliburton are not in the same hierarchy of the NBA.</p>

<p>Tatum is a top 5-7 guy in the league, with much higher expectations since being drafted and a champion now, while Hali is top 20 player. Different situations.</p>

      <label for="lh82hq1" class="commentText"><p>Yeah he should be getting minutes.</p>

<p>Booker has mostly been good at spacing the floor and fine defensively but Tatum can definitely be a better connective tissue guy than ANT for that second unit which already has an elite iso-scorer in KD.</p>

<p>ANT&rsquo;s off-ball defense and sub-par playmaking are his biggest issues and Tatum fixes that.</p>

<p>Tatum&rsquo;s biggest issue is his shooting slump though and maybe Kerr does not want to play him too much with two other non shooters in AD and Bam.</p>

<p>So Tatum is kind of in that in-between place where starting him with LeBron creates a bit of redundancy, but he can&rsquo;t play with too many non-shooters right now.</p>

<p>I have not checked but those three guard lineups with Booker/Steph/Jrue were probably employed for teams with 3 guards, otherwise it would be fine to slot in Tatum for Booker/Jrue since the starting lineup has enough shooting with Embiid playing well.</p>

Here’s Shumpert talking about the <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/NQGV9nE-u0E?si=wY8Bm094hy_sNimQ" target="_blank">command</a> that LeBron has. Bron is probably the only player on the team that can get the ball just by saying “hand,” or yell “corner” at Booker and know he’s going to go without question. LeBron was directing all the other players on top of defending Jokic in 4Q. I love Tatum, but LeBron is still better at everything.</p>

      <label for="lh82gl6" class="commentText"><p>Yep, pretty much exactly this. Tatum deserves all the credit in the world for making a conscious effort at improving his playmaking and distribution. For all the contributions that KP, Jrue, etc. made as new pieces, the biggest change between this Celtics team that won the championship and all the past ones that fell short was Tatum progressing as a facilitator enough to where he can be your secondary playmaker, and even run the offense for limited spurts.</p>

<p>However, none of that changes the fact that, at his core, he&rsquo;s a shoot-first player. That&rsquo;s not an indictment of him, just to be clear, just recognizing the fact that he&rsquo;s never going to be as good in that specific role as more pass-first players might. Same thing works in reverse - the pass-first players that are on a comparable tier are never going to be as good at creating their own offense as Tatum is.</p>

<p>However: As a LBJ/LAL fan, I think we&rsquo;ve all seen the limits of Lebron&rsquo;s simplified, matchup-hunting offense in today&rsquo;s NBA. The analytics clearly show it&rsquo;s not as effecient. Even simple play-call setup motions had a higher success rate. JJ knows this, as did every LAL fan that watched the latter part of this past season.</p>

      <label for="lh82po5" class="commentText"><p>it&rsquo;s not as consistently dominant as it used to be, when things slowed down LeBron would just break that dry spell, i don&rsquo;t trust that as much, and that was clear in the Nuggets series, esp game 2, when they had the huge lead</p>

<p>but it&rsquo;s still dominant, Lakers had a 120 offensive rating with LeBron on the court, top 3 in the league</p>

<p>2023 - top 2</p>

      <label for="lh8lvpa" class="commentText"><p>No, when you need a bucket, such as in a playoff game or a must win elimination Olympic game, that offense works best because you want to put the ball in your best players&rsquo; hands with a favorable matchup.</p>

<p>As someone else mentioned, that offense gets exposed when you have lesser guys getting looks off of your best player, but on this team and on the best NBA teams, this is still an efficient offense in clutch moments.</p>

<p>He’ll be a month short of 40 in 2028 and yes, I know, LeBron!, but as an old, 40 matters for 99.9999999% of the human race. Anthony Davis was a few inches from ending the man’s career in the 3rd quarter. “Anything is possible.”</p>

<p>KD is extremely aware of basketball history and he’s <em>planning</em> to be in LA in 2028. But he knows nothing is guaranteed and this <em>might</em> be his last taste of the greatest cake.</p>

<p>I’d be a little sad, too.</p>

<p>Steve Kerr’s roster management (I’m being polite) has shown that this team doesn’t need 12.</p>

<p>Personally, I think KD ends up playing in leagues all over the world when he stops feeling NBA worthy. Play a season in Spain. In China. Have ball, will travel.</p>

<p>LeBron is almost 40. KD is 35. If team usa was a powerhouse you&rsquo;d see tatum/booker/ant/Hali leading the charge. Do you think those guys are gonna get it done against france and Serbia? Usa basketball isn&rsquo;t what it was.</p>

<p>Exactly. Some in this thread seem to think KD’s referring to iso ball when he says they didn’t call many plays, but that’s not what he means at all. He’s talking about read and react ball, exactly as you describe. Best kind of ball there is.</p>

<p>Imo USA kinda looked like crap on offense the first 3 quarters outside Steph&rsquo;s heroics. They looked far better in the preceding few games, but seemed tight and a little rattled for the first half against Serbia. DWade noted that Bam was imploring them to get some off-ball motion happening in the 2nd iirc, and you could see why.</p>

<p>KD loves that style of play <em>because he&rsquo;s built for it, literally being able to shoot over anyone</em>. Bron knew Stephs game enough to pass him open a couple times in the 4th, and Joel walked into a couple early shots&hellip; and Serbia just couldn&rsquo;t match the talent down the stretch.</p>

<p>But I don&rsquo;t think KD&rsquo;s bball philosophy here is necessarily a winning formula.</p>

<p>Read &amp; react also only works if you have 0-1 ballstoppers on the floor. Everyone HAS to always be looking for the additional pass, with maybe 1 guy who can be a play finisher (3&amp;D wing or a big). So KD’s not wrong, it’s a winning formula, and there’s probably 30% of the league who can play this way.</p>

      <label for="lh7to1w" class="commentText"><p>I legit think if KD had a chance to join another super team he would. Why? We’ve always known he absolutely loves the game of basketball ball.  On the court and all of its complexities.  On a super team he gets a chance to play with other guys who see the game the way he does.<br>
Watching these games has been a huge amount of fun. Watching the players friendships and love of the game is infectious. It would be crazy to see team USA if they had 2 years to practice together.</p>

<p>Did you call Dame, Giannis and Middleton a superteam? How about the epic disaster of Kawhi, PG-13, Harden, Westbrook. Lebron, AD, Russ?</p>

<p>If not, then why is Booker, KD, and 37 year old CP3 a superteam?</p>

<p>Like his college coach had an assistant monitor him to make sure he only practiced free throws after games instead of shooting around for hours.</p>

<p>Wiping out a 15 pt lead to win the game against a team that had a 3x MVP and his teammates shooting over 45% from 3 - 10% over the NBA league average - is insane no matter how you look at it</p>

<p>Down 7 with 6 mins left after KD hit that 3 where Jokic tried running through Embiid to contest it Embiid attacked Jokic, he scored 7 straight points in under 2 mins with a huge block, that is probably one of the best clutch stretches of his career and he did it for Team USA with Steph, KD, Lebron, everyone chest bumping and high fiving him, had to feel amazing for him</p>

The high level defense from Booker and Holiday was big time as well, Embiids dominance being able to play in the paint and shoot the ball well, still can’t believe he’s playing for team USA against France in the finals 😭</p>
