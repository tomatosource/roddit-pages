      <label for="lh7wihp" class="commentText"><p>I feel he also believes he is better now.</p>

<p>If you listen to these older guys interviews, especially LeBron, they will almost never say they were better players when they were younger, instead they&rsquo;ll talk about mentally leveling up due to experience and being better now.</p>

<p>Durant might also believe LeBron is better, I saw him talking about how LeBron has become much more skilled in his older age.</p>

<p>The 2024 team does feel more rounded out with an MVP level Center and AD to back him up, and if you listen to KD interviews he is very high on both of them.</p>

<p>He also has a teammate here, in Booker, that he loves compared to however he feels about Westbrook now.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s not surprising he believes this team is the best.</p>

      <label for="lh7yc9f" class="commentText"><p>Yeah for sure, I’ve always felt you gotta wait for guys to be retired or at least further along before you can get their honest opinion on things</p>

<p>I remember LeBron saying that he thought his 2020 version was his best. Like, I get it, but nah lol. Very curious to see what he’ll consider his peak after he retires.</p>

<p>Another example that interested me was KCP saying that the 2023 Nuggets &amp;gt; 2020 Lakers. Easy to say when you played for the Nuggets - I wonder if he’ll maintain that belief later on, though.</p>

<p>Point is, yeah I agree.</p>

      <label for="lh7z7er" class="commentText"><p>Agreed. A lot of these players would rectify a lot of their takes after a few years.</p>

<p>Having played in such a high intensity game where they manage to ward off adversity also plays a part for the Durant take.</p>

<p>It also probably has to do a bit with ego, it&rsquo;s difficult for such high level athletes to believe that they are getting worse unless there is a huge drop-off in their game or athleticism.</p>

<p>Like just imagining the freight train of 2010 Lebron on this team would be crazy he might have dropped 40 today because no one on that Serbia team was stopping that.</p>

The summer training camps we went to, the sneaking out with the girls team, the wins and the losses, the jokes, and the love of it all. It’s like having 15 extra brothers that spent everyday together for years.</p>

<p>Also, I have a silly theory people who played team sports are better drivers cause we are trained to know where every player (car) around you is at all times, what they’re likely next move will be based on the current situation, and how to react smoothly and “with the flow”.</p>

We roasted him so hard.. also kind of sad thinking about it now I guess …it means nobody ever took him to McDonald’s before.</p>

      <label for="lh8bhte" class="commentText"><p>For real you know KD, Curry, and Lebron have respected each other for the longest time. They bring it every time they match up in the regular season. They always tried to team up when it’s ASW too. To have them all at the end of their primes have one last go around, playing at the highest level, and showcasing all their talents in a huge game on the global stage - that’s got to be special. This may be their last time playing together at this level, and it might be all of their last Olympic game. It’s definitely bittersweet</p>

<p>that Steph 3 for the lead, Embiid wanted it, LeBron looked at him like nah set the screen for Steph</p>

      <label for="lh7suui" class="commentText"><p>I think this is why Kerr has not played Tatum in a point forward role like LeBron, which a lot of fans have been demanding.</p>

<p>Tatum, over the years, has leveled up as a passer but I would still describe him as a system passer where with time and chemistry he became better at making reads and decisions in the Celtics system.</p>

<p>In comparison LeBron is an instinctive passer who doesn&rsquo;t need too much chemistry or hard sets and his feel for the game allows him to make all these decisions.</p>

<p>Ant got 13 minutes, Dwhite got 6, Bam had 9. I get that he’s been great Past few games. Frontrunner at that. But Tatum deserved some minutes from Ant this game.</p>

<p>The bench struggled with scoring, let tatum move the ball, the bench lacks playmaking.</p>

<p>You got KD and Ant just taking turns isoing and missing, AD Bam just standing in the paint. And white a utility player. those bench were all -15, Except Kd. Tatum letting him handle the ball can actually provide more ball movement.</p>

      <label for="lh82hq1" class="commentText"><p>Yeah he should be getting minutes.</p>

<p>Booker has mostly been good at spacing the floor and fine defensively but Tatum can definitely be a better connective tissue guy than ANT for that second unit which already has an elite iso-scorer in KD.</p>

<p>ANT&rsquo;s off-ball defense and sub-par playmaking are his biggest issues and Tatum fixes that.</p>

<p>Tatum&rsquo;s biggest issue is his shooting slump though and maybe Kerr does not want to play him too much with two other non shooters in AD and Bam.</p>

<p>So Tatum is kind of in that in-between place where starting him with LeBron creates a bit of redundancy, but he can&rsquo;t play with too many non-shooters right now.</p>

<p>I have not checked but those three guard lineups with Booker/Steph/Jrue were probably employed for teams with 3 guards, otherwise it would be fine to slot in Tatum for Booker/Jrue since the starting lineup has enough shooting with Embiid playing well.</p>

      <label for="lh85ptv" class="commentText"><p>The fact that he isn&rsquo;t shooting every time he touches the ball is why he&rsquo;s in the game. When your four others are Curry/KD/Bron/Embiid, your fifth guy should be a hustle defensive guy who can play within the flow of the offense which Book has done perfectly. Yes White &amp; Holiday could be that guy too, but Booker demands more attention on offense by simply existing. The dude&rsquo;s a walking bucket in the NBA, he can get his stroke going at any moment.</p>

      <label for="lh8f6jv" class="commentText"><p>Exactly.   I remember Phil Jackson always liked long players like Pippen, Harper and Jordan who could cause havoc on defense by cutting off passing lanes and bothering jumping shots.  I mean that&rsquo;s the advantage that US players have, they are tall, long but still very mobile and athletic.  We weren&rsquo;t really using our strengths to our advantage by playing Tatum more.  Tatum is such a great defender and also a good rebounder.  If he had gotten more minute throughout the tournament I&rsquo;m sure his offensive game would have returned too, just like Curry&rsquo;s did.</p>

      <label for="lh82gl6" class="commentText"><p>Yep, pretty much exactly this. Tatum deserves all the credit in the world for making a conscious effort at improving his playmaking and distribution. For all the contributions that KP, Jrue, etc. made as new pieces, the biggest change between this Celtics team that won the championship and all the past ones that fell short was Tatum progressing as a facilitator enough to where he can be your secondary playmaker, and even run the offense for limited spurts.</p>

<p>However, none of that changes the fact that, at his core, he&rsquo;s a shoot-first player. That&rsquo;s not an indictment of him, just to be clear, just recognizing the fact that he&rsquo;s never going to be as good in that specific role as more pass-first players might. Same thing works in reverse - the pass-first players that are on a comparable tier are never going to be as good at creating their own offense as Tatum is.</p>

      <label for="lh81y8e" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, LBJ gets a nod for marshaling the forces out there for sure. Down the stretch, with the best talent in the world on the floor, who&rsquo;s games he knew well, they could work it out.</p>

<p>However: As a LBJ/LAL fan, I think we&rsquo;ve all seen the limits of Lebron&rsquo;s simplified, matchup-hunting offense in today&rsquo;s NBA. The analytics clearly show it&rsquo;s not as effecient. Even simple play-call setup motions had a higher success rate. JJ knows this, as did every LAL fan that watched the latter part of this past season.</p>

<p>No cameras but they were out for blood trying to prove themselves the best.</p>

<p>When team MJ scored (MJ played PG while Stockton was recovering), Magic:</p>

<p>MJ to Magic and Bird, <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my league!  You brought it up but it&rsquo;s over now!  Your time is over, it&rsquo;s my turn now!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Exactly. Some in this thread seem to think KD’s referring to iso ball when he says they didn’t call many plays, but that’s not what he means at all. He’s talking about read and react ball, exactly as you describe. Best kind of ball there is.</p>

<p>Casuals thinking no plays means iso or top of the key pnr. In the last 5mins of the 4th they ran a wing split action with KD and Steph with Emiid and Booker on the other side of the court. Bron makes the read and the action develops from there</p>

      <label for="lh80ypi" class="commentText"><p>Counterpoint here:</p>

<p>Imo USA kinda looked like crap on offense the first 3 quarters outside Steph&rsquo;s heroics. They looked far better in the preceding few games, but seemed tight and a little rattled for the first half against Serbia. DWade noted that Bam was imploring them to get some off-ball motion happening in the 2nd iirc, and you could see why.</p>

<p>KD loves that style of play <em>because he&rsquo;s built for it, literally being able to shoot over anyone</em>. Bron knew Stephs game enough to pass him open a couple times in the 4th, and Joel walked into a couple early shots&hellip; and Serbia just couldn&rsquo;t match the talent down the stretch.</p>

<p>But I don&rsquo;t think KD&rsquo;s bball philosophy here is necessarily a winning formula.</p>

<p>Read &amp; react also only works if you have 0-1 ballstoppers on the floor. Everyone HAS to always be looking for the additional pass, with maybe 1 guy who can be a play finisher (3&amp;D wing or a big). So KD’s not wrong, it’s a winning formula, and there’s probably 30% of the league who can play this way.</p>

<p>They trust him a lot because his defense and hustle is the inverse of Micic’. But he can also knockdown open shots and drive straight to the basket when he sees a lane.</p>

On the court and all of its complexities.  On a super team he gets a chance to play with other guys who see the game the way he does.<br>
Watching these games has been a huge amount of fun. Watching the players friendships and love of the game is infectious. It would be crazy to see team USA if they had 2 years to practice together.</p>

<p>Did you call Dame, Giannis and Middleton a superteam? How about the epic disaster of Kawhi, PG-13, Harden, Westbrook. Lebron, AD, Russ?</p>

<p>If not, then why is Booker, KD, and 37 year old CP3 a superteam?</p>

When you tell the average Joe the best basketball player in the world (and arguably the best two) are Europeans, they wouldn&rsquo;t believe you. Talent has shifted for sure.</p>

<p>LeBron is almost 40. KD is 35. If team usa was a powerhouse you&rsquo;d see tatum/booker/ant/Hali leading the charge. Do you think those guys are gonna get it done against france and Serbia? Usa basketball isn&rsquo;t what it was.</p>

That&rsquo;s why y&rsquo;all looked like ass for the first 3 quarters, and if that <em>was</em> the team running plays, then the issue was by all means lack of execution. Straight up AAU team out there. We were tactically outclassed.</p>

      <label for="lh7sici" class="commentText"><p>The fact they were down so much as favorites made the situation feel so much more desperate as they were scraping to come back. Came back down 13 in the 4th quarter and escaped the slander. Yes they always should have won, but this was easily the most fun game of the entire Olympics because Serbia made them dig down and fight incredibly hard.</p>
