I don’t have any data to support this though because post scoring and FG% near the rim didn’t exist back then but 2PT% could be a correlated proxy for it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In his best year, McHale averaged 26 ppg, with otherworldly field goal percentage of .604. Olajuwan&rsquo;s best scoring year was 27ppg and .517 He never cracked .550 in his career, whereas McHale had six .550 plus years, and two where he shot better than .600.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no question Olajuwan was an excellent post player, great to watch, a scoring machine and a better all round player than McHale thanks to his explosiveness, shot blocking and transition game, but when it comes down to technical perfection in the post, its very hard to argue with those shooting percentages.</p>

<p>I think there is a very good argument that McHale is the most effective post player of all time.</p>

      <label for="lna91rh" class="commentText"><p>Yea I know what you are saying. You’ll need advanced stats for that which don’t exist for that era. </p>

<p>One thing I want to point out was Hakeem’s teammates were quite bad post Ralph Sampson but around 1994, although his teammates were bad 1 on 1, they were well constructed as a team due to the fact they played one of the first 4 out offenses at times in the NBA (led the league in 3 point attempts and makes those championship years). </p>

<p>Not saying his teammates were on the level of Bird because they weren’t but just saying they also aren’t as bad as like their individual accolades suggest. </p>

      <label for="lnaaak1" class="commentText"><p>He also was being defended by the other teams best post defender. The chief had the other teams center on him, so McHale often hade a smaller pf.</p>

<p>The first rockets title team was interesting. Sam Cassell (a forgotten irrational confidence guy) was his best offensive teammate that yr. A young Horry’s ability to step out helped. That was like the magic finals team without a hedo.</p>

<p>In other words, replace Hakeem with say..Mutumbo and that team is a lottery team.</p>

      <label for="lna2ecl" class="commentText"><p>Better <em>moves</em> is McHale.  Shot a higher percentage with worse spacing and he was a little shorter, weaker and couldnt jump as high.  Add the fact that Olajuwon played with a ton of high volume shooters (the rockets led the league in threes made multiple years) I got McHale.</p>

<p>Now Olajuwon scored more frequently in the post and mostly had to go against centers, he’s a reasonable answer.  Maybe it’s pedantic to parse it this way but Olajuwon was similarly effective but McHale had a better combo of footwork, touch, balance, composure.  They affected the game similarly but McHale had better moves if that made sense.</p>

<p>So Michale if he’s 6ft or closer to the rim. Hakeem, everywhere else.  </p>

<p>Edit:: thought how it was even a tougher comparison, McHale never really had to lead the team. Hakeem was the go-to scorer, go-to defender and last shot taker. Michale nearly always had Larry legend to kick out to.</p>
