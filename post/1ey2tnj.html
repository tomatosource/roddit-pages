</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Obviously NY producers some good hoopers at the NBA level, but we haven&rsquo;t had anyone who came up through the NYC hoops system (as in went to a NY High School not moved away like Melo or MJ) who went on to be a superstar at the NBA level since Dr J or Kareem. Marbury could have been what Iverson became but made some bad decisions. Kemba was good for a couple of seasons but never superstar level.</p>

<p>What do you think is the problem with NY hoops for creating pro players who go on to be superstars? LA meanwhile has had plenty of recent superstar level guys like Kawhi, Harden and Westbrook. Even Jersey right next door produced guys like Kyrie and Shaq</p>

      <label for="ljap4t9" class="commentText"><p>If you’re a really good young basketball player in a big market like New York and start making a buzz, some private prep feeder school is going to poach you.  I’ve seen it first hand.  The best players in NYC don’t make it to local high schools, they end up going to prep schools in Connecticut or Florida.  Just look at how many players were born in NYC and then went to high school somewhere else.  Just a random example would Mo Bamba.  Parents were immigrants from Ivory Coast.  He was born and raised in Harlem - and then went to a random boarding high school in Pennsylvania that also gave Cam Reddish and 
Dereck Lively. </p>

<p>erasmus hall at least is now starting to send players to play football at ohio state since curtis samuel tore it up for them so there&rsquo;s at least something of a D1/NFL pipeline now but seeing the basketball schools like lincoln, christ the king, etc. no longer sending guys to the league is really sad</p>

<p>the last one out of the city at least to my knowledge was james bouknight who&rsquo;s already out of the league</p>

      <label for="lje5zr0" class="commentText"><p>Donovan Mitchell is an example. In a previous era he might have been born in New York City and come up in New York City. But in the late 90s he was born just outside the city in Westchester, played with the kids in New York City growing up and was a standout in NYC AAU, but then went to Greenwich County Day school in Greenwich, CT and the Canterbury school in New Milford.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say he was &ldquo;poached&rdquo; - his dad was a pro athlete and he knew the game they were playing. But it shows the shift in the center of gravity of elite NYC high school basketball to the suburban prep schools, and how the track takes top prospects away from the city.</p>

      <label for="ljbevzm" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I’m from AUS and visited NYC for the first time last year. The lack of any publicly accessible sporting ground was wild. It’s a very dense city of course but you could really feel that if you didn’t have money to pay for facilities (not including the travel and time costs for working parents) then you wouldn’t have much hope in major sports besides maybe basketball. Made me appreciate how easily accessible sport is in Australia as a hobby or to even practise (club/kit fees here I assume is also lower than US but I don’t know for sure). Makes sense that warmer and less dense states with greater green space produce better athletes. It’s cheaper and more accessible and probably feels safer for younger kids than NYC.</p>

The rest of what you say is true though. Though, in pretty much everywhere else in the US, you have to drive to find green space. But also, everyone has cars so maybe that&rsquo;s not a big deal. Also, regardless, there just isn&rsquo;t that much green space in nyc so it doesn&rsquo;t matter that you can walk or subway everywhere.</p>

      <label for="ljc1oto" class="commentText"><p>NYC lacks a lot of good public sporting facilities (and the space for each high school to have a football field), but I would say for a city of it&rsquo;s size and density, it does fairly well on greenspace. Central Park right in the middle of Manhatten and it&rsquo;s preservation is amazing, plus other smaller parks. Brooklyn has Prospect Park.</p>

There are tons of small parks and certainly there is central park. In fact, I think central park is only the 7th biggest park in nyc if we include all the boroughs which is crazy.</p>

<p>Just not true lol.</p>

<p>Looking at just Manhattan for simplicity, there&rsquo;s 19 public parks with soccer fields, 120+ public basketball courts, around 40 public baseball fields, and plenty of facilities for all sorts of other sports. And obviously more in the less dense outer boroughs.</p>

Almost everywhere is fenced off and pay to use and while they do have a few green spaces most of them are dirty and overgrown. The difference is insane coming from back home where every neighbourhood has a massive park, well maintained with multiple rugby, football fields, basketball courts etc</p>

      <label for="ljbmqz2" class="commentText"><p>To jump on a point from earlier in the thread about investment in education,  New Jersey is unique in that each municipality is its own school district.  This adds expense but it means you have less enormous schools.  So whereas in another state 3 towns would have a school with 3000 kids New Jersey will hand 3 schools with each 1000. As a result there are more opportunities for kids to have spots on teams and develop. And this carries over to all extracurricular activities.</p>

It&rsquo;s not quite like Texas(they got the full trifecta of population, fanaticism, and money), but the sport having its roots here has never loosened its grip on the people. That and Ohio is a more populous state than people realize I think, since it&rsquo;s way down the list size wise; the big 3 metros are all pretty sizable.</p>

      <label for="ljbauq9" class="commentText"><p>Fwiw, the Steph and LeBron thing is especially weird because these are the two best of their generation and had one of the most famous rivalries. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;d be curious to know if there&rsquo;s ever been a coincidence about the two best players of a generation in any sport that beats that one. </p>

<p>Markus Naslund and Peter Forsberg were competing for NHL MVP a couple decades ago. They were both from Ornskoldvik, Sweden, population about 30,000. But as good as he was, Naslund wasn&rsquo;t quite a generational talent. Not sure what some other examples would be?</p>

      <label for="ljag3ao" class="commentText"><p>This is the answer.</p>

<p>Having worked in NYC public schools many are so small they don’t have enough students to create a team. It’s also not uncommon for a school to lack an actual gym or to share the gym with a bunch of others schools that are in the same building. Then of course schools would have to pay coaches and have funds for uniforms and travel. If the school isn’t paying for those things then families would which is hard because many schools are filled with low income students whose families don’t have the money. Add in a large population of immigrants who don’t necessarily value or understand after school sports or need older kids at home to help. And those immigrant families are increasingly from places where soccer is the big sport. Plus the are arts are incredibly popular and often more supported than sports so kids and school funds go to music/theater/arts etc.</p>

<p>At one point in the last year or so, the Warriors could have put five players on the court who were the sons of former NBA players (Steph, Klay, GPII, Wiggins, Trayce Jackson Davis).</p>

<p>Even if not from families of millionaires, basketball, along with nearly every other sport, is becoming more specialized, requiring year-long training and playing, and therefore more expensive. The kids who can play for the school and AAU and other clubs and training camps will have a much greater advantage over the kids playing on the blacktop.</p>

All things being equal, if two people have similar levels of natural talent, one kid getting raised with prep school coaching and consistent food on the table will likely pan out better than someone who doesn’t have either of those things. Ofc outliers like Giannis and (to a lesser extent, but still true) LeBron exist, but they’re some of the most incredible athletes to ever play in the nba</p>

      <label for="ljbdyet" class="commentText"><p>Seriously. NY point guards were a thing in the league for quite some time - Stephon was a legit superstar for a stretch for sure.</p>

<p>But beyond that and extending past the superstar label - Kenny Anderson, Rafer Alston, Mark Jackson, Pearl Washington, Tiny Archibald there was a legacy of NYC point guards in the league. Kemba Walker being the most recent and he was a genuine all star guard.</p>

<p>Plus Ron Artest had a stretch as one genuinely one of the best players in the league with the Pacers IMO.</p>

<p>The league now is just made up of AAU players, sons of athletes, and prodigy euro kids that go pro at 15. So you don’t see certain backgrounds as much these days.</p>

      <label for="ljak2gh" class="commentText"><p>I think two things are mainly responsible - talent drain and grassroots basketball.  Many talented prep players leave the area so they are not distracted by outside influences.  But personally I believe grassroots basketball is the biggest culprit.  Many, many teams in NY aim to be the best as it is profitable for them to charge kids to be part of the program, extra training, etc.  The focus is on winning and not on development.  Many teams choose to fudge the ages and grades of their players in order to win tournaments ( It is very common for 12-13 year old kids to play on U10 teams especially if small).  These kids go out and dominate but don&rsquo;t understand how to play the game.  They never really learn team offense/defense concepts that they will need to compete at a higher level.</p>

      <label for="ljbh2aw" class="commentText"><p>Once HS players started traveling across the country to attend different schools, that changed the whole dynamic. When I was in HS in California our school was in the same league as Jason Kidd&rsquo;s HS. His senior year (91-92),they brought in a 6-6 ringer from Rhode Island, I believe. As if it wasn&rsquo;t enough to have Jason Kidd! The guy they brought in didn&rsquo;t make the NBA, or even star in college, but the fact that a guy went clear across the country chasing his hoop dreams was prophetic of what was to come in the ensuing years.</p>

<p>So, it&rsquo;s totally possible that NYC has some major talent (like Chicago), but will the schools in those cities be able to recruit a top player and keep him from going to Mater Dei in SoCal or Montverde or Oak Hill academies? Or IMG? Definitely not.</p>

I have looked up zero stats to prove this but I’m sure in sunnier states or areas, there is more opportunity to play whenever you want due to more outdoor courts or being able to play during the “winter season”. I’m sure there’s moments in NY where the weather stops them from playing or practicing and they might not have access to an indoor gym.</p>

      <label for="ljatv1d" class="commentText"><p>I’d offer 2 ideas:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pro sports are increasingly a factory system that starts at a young age. The more you fill the top of the funnel, and the more infrastructure is in each step
To increase the odds that kids successfully pass from one stage to the next, the higher the odds of a superstar outcome.</li>
</ol>

<p>Those factors can range from availability of community parks, quality of coaches, quality of travel system, competition from other sports, competition from other pastimes, level of financial investment required to participate and/or receive personalized coaching or high level camps. I would guess that NYC would compare poorly to other relatively large metros across most of all of those factors.</p>

<ol>
<li>Culture. Wealthy parents are not letting their kids become professional athletes. Everyone is influenced by the priorities and culture of their surroundings, including what professions are “acceptable”. I would guess that kids from NYC over-index on careers in corporate finance, private equity, investment banking, consumer finance, consulting, and the like. I would guess they under-index on sports, entertainment, tech, biotech, etc.</li>

<p>Maybe white kids, but as someone black and from new york sports/entertainment is seen as the best way out for most of those in minority communities. Whether that be rap, basketball or football.</p>

      <label for="ljbu5ad" class="commentText"><p>To add to your comment, why do people think everyone from nyc is rich? I grew up mad poor.  So many people living here below the poverty line making ends meet.  So many immigrants coming in every day hustling and working multiple jobs just trying to earn enough to make rent and save some money.  </p>

<p>New York has a ton of opportunity and my parents worked their asses off and were able to climb up the work ladder here.  But I’d say <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> or NYC is in that boat.  Even if you work in finance, shit ain’t easy trying to live in manhattan and raise a family.  They have their own struggles with work life balance and keeping up with the joneses.  </p>

<p>Sorry just had to rant.</p>

      <label for="ljc21mb" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I completely understand you as well, my grandparents came from Haiti worked as janitors &amp; they saved up &amp; eventually bought a Brooklyn apartment back in the 70’s &amp; a bunch of my extended family ended up staying in the building trying to get their footing in the U.S. &amp; for the most part raised me while my mom was in the military overseas a lot. I grew up around a bunch of working class black immigrants the carribean. </p>

<p>I feel like because NYC is one of the most well known cities in the U.S. that it just gets a lot of assumptions made about it &amp; there are always a surprising amount of people who just think NYC = Manhattan. I’m with you though, my experience in NYC is usually pretty different than what Reddit says.</p>

<p>As for Basketball, my brother &amp; cousin were heavy into basketball as its encouraged, more so recreationally &amp; the thing about playing organized sports in NYC is you have to actively seek it out from a young age if you really want to go far in it &amp; probably pay atleast until you get older. A lot of kids just stick to playing recreationally </p>
