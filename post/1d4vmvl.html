</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>My BF of 2 years has an 11yo daughter that just started her first ever menstrual cycle 3 days ago. He has full custody of her and they started making transitions to move in with me and my 8yo son about 2 weeks ago. Up until this point, everything was going fairly well. The kids got along and I thought Diane was a nice enough kid.</p>

<p>Anyways, she walks out of her bedroom 3 days ago and tells me she thinks she started her period and was asking me the general questions on how to wear a pad, what she can/can&rsquo;t do, etc. All is well. I let her stay home from school after calling my BF at work to confirm plans and give him the run down. She was crampy. I work from home so it was no issue. All day she interrupted my business calls to talk about her period. It was annoying but I just dealt with it because it&rsquo;s her first menstrual so obviously there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of questions. This wasn&rsquo;t even the problem. It was what followed it. She was in a great mood all day. But as soon as my BF and my son got home from work, my home turned in to a warzone. My son asked if she wanted to play with him and she screamed in his face &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my period&rdquo; and literally slammed him out of her doorway. He went flying, hit the wall. Bruised his shoulder and hit his head off the door frame. My BF went to talk to her and she starts crying. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my period, I don&rsquo;t want him near me&rdquo;. He gave her a pass for her behavior, which already pissed me off. The next day we planned a beach day (like a week ago planned it), Diane starts flipping out to a point of a full tantrum. Screaming AT me and my BF telling us that no, we would not still be going to the beach because she&rsquo;s on her period and she can&rsquo;t swim and since she can&rsquo;t, none of us can and she &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t care&rdquo; if that bothers us. My BF cancels the trip, or tried. I told him I was still bringing my kid regardless. We get back home at 3pm. When I left, I had a pot of chili in the slow cooker for dinner. I find half the pot gone. Diane had been eating out of the slow cooker. My BF told me that Diane said the only thing she wanted was chili and that since she was on her period, he had to let her. He listened to her. There wasn&rsquo;t enough to feed everyone now. We send the kids to bed at 8pm. She comes out at 9, telling her father that she needed ice cream or she &ldquo;was going to snap&rdquo;. He originally said no; she starts tweaking out. Crying, screaming. Wakes up my son. He ends up going and getting her the fucking ice cream instead of being a parent and snipping that shit in the bud.</p>

<p>Then this morning. My BF tells her she can stay home from school again because she&rsquo;s still on her period. I tell him no. I&rsquo;m working today and she interrupted me all day on my last workday. She starts flipping out, screaming at me that I&rsquo;m &ldquo;not doing anything to make her comfortable when that&rsquo;s what she needs right now&rdquo;. My BF sides with her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s her first period, we need to learn to navigate it.&rdquo; I told him again that she was NOT staying here today. He gets angry with me and says I&rsquo;m making his life harder than it has to be. His kid is still screaming at me. So, I snapped and told them to pack all their shit and leave and that I was fucking done. Said that I&rsquo;m glad she started her period so soon in to moving in so that I could get a proper assessment of how it would be full time and I would be damned I put up with this bullshit every month. They both immediately calmed down. She starts crying, saying she was just &ldquo;trying to make me understand&rdquo;. He&rsquo;s telling me I&rsquo;m being ridiculous. I stood firm however and told them to get out. They are now gone and my house is peaceful. I don&rsquo;t want them back here. My BF has been blowing my phone up since, telling me this is just a bump in the road but I have never been so disgusted by anyone in my entire life. AITA for not letting them return and telling him I&rsquo;m done?</p>

<p>I did speak to her about her aggression yesterday. I told her it wasn&rsquo;t okay to put her hands on people, to scream in my face, to demand we cater to her and break things. She says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my period, nothing I do right now can be held against me because I have no control&rdquo;. Which is enough to prove to me that she does have control, she&rsquo;s using this as an excuse.</p>

      <label for="l6h9s3t" class="commentText"><p>NTA I think this is not just her period but signs of a much bigger problem where she&rsquo;s manipulative AF and your BF always caves in to her when she acts badly instead of being a parent and putting a stop to the behavior. And he&rsquo;s also showing you that he will always take her side over you no matter how bad her behavior is. She&rsquo;s also going to bully your son. He deserves to have a peaceful and safe home and not to have to live with a bully. Living with them will be hell if you let them stay. You have the opportunity in this moment to dodge the bullet.</p>

      <label for="l6hl1qg" class="commentText"><p>NTA and I agree, this behavior seems wholesale manipulative. Hormonal or not, physically body checking your son and then claiming &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t hold me accountable because of a bodily function&rdquo; is not okay and needs to be stamped out yesterday. Also note that when she realized you were serious about consequences she immediately realized she&rsquo;d gone too far and tried to back track, while blaming you (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just trying to make you understand&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Time to tell her that no one GAF about her period. Women have had them for millions of years. We don’t get to smack a bitch because we’re surfing the crimson wave. Not even when it’s more like a tsunami.</p>

<p>Thank gods my daughter didn’t pull that shit when she got her first period.</p>

My sister was always waaaayyyyy too permissive/dismissive to her daughter&rsquo;s behavior, and when they moved in with me, I decided to nip that in the bud immediately. It took three months of her trying me before she eventually gave up and started acting right. I only had to throw down once, but she got the message, lol. She still walks all over my sister, but ALWAYS treats me with respect.</p>

I won&rsquo;t put up with that. Now, we&rsquo;ve always gotten along like champs, but if you want to start acting snotty to me, I have NO problems being the heavy. From this point forward you get to decide if we&rsquo;ll continue to have a pleasant relationship or a contentious one. The one thing you won&rsquo;t get is a pass from me.&rdquo; Since then she&rsquo;s never been a problem with me. She&rsquo;s now 27 and ♪awesome♪!</p>

      <label for="l6i3pz5" class="commentText"><p>Word for word my exact thoughts, except for having a child of my own.</p>

<p>Due to PCOS and an abnormally shaped uterus I have excruciating periods (my doctor asked me to describe my symptoms and apparently you&rsquo;re <em>not</em> supposed to be unable to remain standing during cramps? Was news to me before the pill.) and have experienced them almost monthly for the past 15 years.
You know what happens when it comes? I put on a pad, I take some ibuprofen, and I get on with my week; like every woman has since the dawn of mankind from puberty to menopause, because the world doesn&rsquo;t stop just because you&rsquo;re hormonal and in pain 🙄 Consequences still apply!</p>

<p>Scream and demand things at work? You won&rsquo;t have a job or means to feed and shelter yourself, so dad will have to keep a room available for her and have something planned to support her when he dies.</p>

<p>Shout at and bodycheck people? No one will be her friend and eventually she&rsquo;ll be old enough to be charged with assault, though she may get some time off if she can get the judge to laugh when they hear her defence.
At some point she&rsquo;s going to find out there are people with even worse tempers who don&rsquo;t believe in calling the authorities, so I hope daddy dearest is saving up for court <em>and</em> medical expenses.</p>

Turned out to be endometriosis, wouldn&rsquo;t find out until I was in my early 20s. I also had anxiety and crying spells.</p>

<p>Makes me wish I&rsquo;d known I could have taken the Pill to treat both much sooner. I was so relieved when my daughter didn&rsquo;t inherit my problems.</p>

I would call her bluff: tell the BF if the kid is legitimately unable to control her behavior/impulses during her period, something is very wrong and the girl needs immediate psychiatric evaluation. Act super concerned and do not let it drop, pointing out that never in OP&rsquo;s years of menstruating has she lost control like that. Women in professional settings are not slapping people who behave poorly and saying they can&rsquo;t be held accountable because they&rsquo;re having their periods. Believe me, we would all have taken the opportunity to slug a douchebag customer/student/coworker if lack of consequences due to periods were a thing.</p>

<p>I sat my niece down and asked her if any of the older women in our family, especially me, have ever acted that way. My niece said no, but all her friends are telling her to do it.</p>

<p>I <em>want</em> to gather all her friends with their parents and sit down and talk to them about this, but my niece said that out of all her friends, only she was given the proper talk of body function and what to expect, and what might happen.</p>

<p>All her friends didn&rsquo;t know that they should be changing their pads and tampons regularly. She told them that. She also told her friends that the ones on tiktok were not giving true advice, but her friends all say it must be true because their mums would get very angry on their period.</p>

<p>I am informed my brothers to make sure they keep an eye on their daughters and, if any hint of the manipulations, to let me know. Their wives are sorta on board, but I spent 6hrs last weekend seeing the rot being told on tiktok about periods&hellip; one girl about 14, was saying you can&rsquo;t get pregnant a few days before, during, or 3 days after the period&hellip; I am getting way too old to deal with misinformation</p>

<p>There is a level of being understanding and sympathetic. 11 can be a bit young/immature to feel ready to have their first period&hellip;.. But it has happened. Nothing OP or anyone else could have done to stop it.</p>

<p>However, there is a difference between expecting grace/empathy and weaponizing the situation. She is using the experience to bully everyone to her will.</p>

<p>More than that, even if she isn&rsquo;t bullying/manipulating intentionally, she&rsquo;s going to have about 12 a year until menopause. Is bf going to coddle her twelve weeks out of the year for decades to come? OP setting boundaries is setting the kid up for success. For, as much as many menstruating people would love special time off and nuanced care, modern, capitalist society doesn&rsquo;t afford that. Uterus havers need to learn how to manage their cycle and their emotions, bc a cis-male dominated world is not going to help them or pity them.</p>

<p>OP, did you consider reminding your partners daughter that you get periods too? That you have cramps and pain and the headache of changing out menstrual products too much and yet you&rsquo;d never shove her or scream at her just because of your period? It seems like she&rsquo;s not recognizing that around half the human population has periods, yet very few are nightmare humans during them. Some cultures make women live in a separate building during their period, even. She may have misunderstood how big of a deal this was because of friends or media or something.</p>

<p>There are only sad reasons why the mother would not want 50% custody of her daughter at the bare minimum.</p>

<p>OP calls the child &ldquo;a nice enough kid&rdquo; which indicates there was likely no connection between OP and the child in the first place. I don&rsquo;t think she wants to be this child&rsquo;s maternal figure.</p>

      <label for="l6i20b3" class="commentText"><p>Had an ex who was absolutely fine until I&rsquo;d sold my house and moved in with her and suddenly she becomes awful to deal with- jealous and controlling and selfish and moody. Split up.</p>

<p>Two years later reconnected and spent about 4 years with two houses absolutely fine. Moved in with her again convinced the problems the first time wouldn&rsquo;t reoccur. Guess what happened.</p>

<p>Fundamentally she always knew I&rsquo;d have the balls to stand up to her if she was being an arsehole go home and dump her and just carry on with life and find a new girl reasonably easily.  When I&rsquo;d given up my own place and let go of the majority of my possessions then the moodiness and gaslighting and manipulation started and just ranked up to a level that I&rsquo;d lost any kind of affection for her and was conscious that my anxiety and stress was though the roof all the time even when she was having  a day where she was pleasant towards me.
I think this was all learnt behaviour from her mum. Her dad had had loads of heart problems and blood pressure problems since being relatively young and I put it down to him deciding to stay with such a manipulative and demanding spouse and trying to keep the lid on things.</p>

      <label for="l6i94xj" class="commentText"><p>Yeah you’re trying to mix and raise two kids in a house together during their formative years and have completely opposite standards for your children. I’m glad this has happened to cause you to reconsider, because it’s fairly minor and reversible and break up worthy before you got even further enmeshed. I’m glad your son sees you standing up for decency, too.</p>

She is acting out drama that’s she’s seen somewhere else because she is an attention seeker and thinks she’ll get special treatment. The tough approach was the right call. Someone — her father, who sounds like he indulges her drama all the time — needs to set her straight. “This is a perfectly normal part of your life, so get used to it, and drop the drama act or you will lose friends over your behaviour.”</p>

<li><p>She hit your son, actually threw him at the wall - an 8 year old child. That&rsquo;s is not a safe environment for your son</p></li>
</ol>

<p><em>It definitely does not matter it&rsquo;s her first period</em></p>

For other women it can be debilitating and stop them in their tracks. It can also fluctuate every month!</p>

<p>But none of that gives anyone an excuse to put hands on someone else. Higher emotions, more sensitivity, sure. But violence is not acceptable.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve cried because of my period. Been in fetal position, waiting for the pain to pass. I&rsquo;ve gritted my teeth and done presentations at school and at work during horrible cramps because the world keeps going even if your uterus wants to kill you.</p>

Likely in part to the family history of endometriosis, but the past three years they are ridiculously heavy and I have killer cramps. And yet if I&rsquo;m on my cycle during in-office days I just pop a couple of Motrin, dress comfy yet casual, and curl up in my office chair. My life can&rsquo;t stop just because my uterus lining is sloughing off.</p>

<p>Honestly, I&rsquo;m just thankful that it&rsquo;s only been a few years of this ridiculousness and that it might be due to approaching 50; dealing with any of it since age 12 has been enough, I&rsquo;m ready to join the Menopause Club.</p>

It took way too many years of MH crises to realize they were happening the week before and of my period. I wasn’t really suicidal just suffering from PMDD. Im pissed and annoyed that nobody clocked that and I went through hell for so long and had to figure it out myself. Smh.</p>

<p>Because of the endometriosis I’m on treatment that totally stops my periods so no more PMDD thank god. My life is a hell of a lot more stable now.</p>

I do empathize with the bf a <em>tiny</em> bit, raising a girl by his onsies and her hitting puberty is probably super stressful, but he&rsquo;s completely off the rock with his enabling.  OP doesn&rsquo;t hit HIM and scream everything she&rsquo;s on his period, why does he think it&rsquo;s okay that his daughter uses her period as an excuse to be abusive?</p>

She&rsquo;s probably lashing out because she&rsquo;s resentful and angry that this is her reality, but nobody parented her through it or comforted her about it.</p>

<p>It was 100% the job of the adults to ask what was going on with her, ask why she was acting the way she was acting, and explain what the reality of a period actually is and what accomodations are acceptable.
She literally said she just wanted them to understand.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s 11 confronting a huge life change that even adult women hate and struggle with. Of course she&rsquo;s mad that she will never again be able to just go to the beach without timing it correctly or managing her period somehow.</p>

<p>Like&hellip;.neither of these adults stepped up to the plate and everyone&rsquo;s mad at a child???</p>

<p>i started my period at 10. you know what i did? asked my parents to stay home bc i thought it was a stomach ache. woke up, mom gave me a pad, and told me “you’re not sick, so i won’t ban you from electronics”. i stayed home 2 days bc the pain was so intense. i have NEVER in my life EVER acted like that! and i’ve had pcos for years, it causes mood swings!</p>

<p>she’s probably hormonal, but i also think she’s attempting to get away with more now. eating almost all of a dinner YOU prepared, demanding shit, i could NEVER! my dad would’ve yelled and whooped me for that level of disrespect (i don’t agree with physical discipline but he did). regardless, her behavior is just not okay. she can’t go about life treating everyone horribly for a week out of every month (or longer! some people’s hormones kick in a week or so before the actual start date. i have a week of cramping before i bleed)</p>

<p>Dad has to step up and be a parent and not let his kid get away with this shit.</p>

She’s far too old for that kind of behaviour to be dismissed as a mistake and I think her father enabling her means that you were right and NTA. The living situation is untenable. I also think the relationship is tbh. Like, think about how this could evolve. If your partner is rolling over now and siding against you, after she has genuinely caused harm to YOUR child, how far could it go?</p>

<p>Obviously, slapping is not &ldquo;playing&rdquo;.  This behavior should have been stopped right that minute, and she should not have been allowed to move into a home with another child (let alone you) until everyone was convinced that she wouldn&rsquo;t resort to violence for small conflicts.</p>

Someone needs to talk to her about reasonable accommodations, and that they don’t include completely throwing all acceptable behavior out of the window.</p>

<p>Hell, a lot of people wouldn’t even consider letting her stay home from school, so she’s already getting way more accommodation than many. I get the sense that her idea of PMS and menstruation is totally out of balance with reality, and probably came from some social media bubble or other tweens (or selfish adult behavior in her life).</p>

<p>I honestly feel for her in a way, despite how absolutely wrong all of her actions are. The adults in her life totally let her down, and continue to do so.</p>

Guess what, people make mistakes and handle certain things not to your liking/standards, but more importantly people can and do change. I know it&rsquo;s a weird concept to 99% of the people in here, but it&rsquo;s true.</p>

<p>Was the 11 year old on her first period being annoying, mean, and irrational? (Wow that&rsquo;s crazy&hellip;) YES.</p>

<p>Did the dad handle it poorly and not to your liking? YES.</p>

<p>Did his daughter <em>intentionally</em> &lsquo;assault&rsquo; your son like others are saying? Fuck no, unless you left out context.</p>

<p>Did you ever have an adult conversation with your SO before making a snap decision? Sure doesn&rsquo;t sound like it.</p>

<p>This sub always talks about boundaries, which are obviously needed, but did you even set any? You went from &ldquo;omg this 11 year old on her first period is annoying and  (probably) accidently minorly hurt my kid&rdquo; to &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fucking kicking them out and flushing 2 years down the toilet&rdquo; in a matter of what, 36 hours? And now you have everyone in here telling you that you did the right thing??????? Feel like I&rsquo;m taking crazy pills reading these comments patting you on the back. Guess everyone in this sub has the perfect relationship with zero hitches and their SO does and handles everything exactly how they want without even talking about it.</p>

      <label for="l6hgw61" class="commentText"><p>Ding ding ding! She’s emulating what she’s seen as being referenced as “a woman on her period”. Her comment that she can’t be held responsible for anything she does because she has no control is utter bs. And a huge red flag. Someone or something taught her that entitlement.</p>

<p>Her father should have put a stop to that IMMEDIATELY. He needed to teach her that her behavior was unacceptable, instead of just trying to appease the monster he let her transform into.</p>

<p>OP is absolutely in the right. You assault my child, you get out of my house. Period.</p>

      <label for="l6hs1q5" class="commentText"><p>Going against the grain, I guess. YTA and so is your bf.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s. 11. She just realized her life as she knew it is over, she will be dealing with blood and pain every month for decades. Her childhood will never be carefree ever again; she&rsquo;s going to have to go to school in what feels like a diaper, and the adults she is looking to are not consoling her or providing guidance.
She&rsquo;s scared, upset, bitter, who knows? Not you guys because you didn&rsquo;t sit and talk with her about how she feels.</p>

<p>How hard would it have been when she interrupts your work to say, &ldquo;Hey, this is a BIG change. I know it&rsquo;s scary, but I&rsquo;ve been doing this for years. Why don&rsquo;t you and I have a special girls&rsquo; night? Pick a dessert and let&rsquo;s go out tonight and talk about it. I&rsquo;ve got your back, and I can answer any questions or worries you have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When she&rsquo;s upset about the beach, how hard is it to say, &ldquo;I know it sucks to miss out on things because of your period. I&rsquo;ve been there. We will have to time it better next time! Once you&rsquo;re older, there are ways to still swim using more advanced menstrual products but just be patient with yourself through these changes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dad just panicked and let her try to become a tyrant when she just needed to be sat down and told that, unfortunately, she still has to be kind to people even if she&rsquo;s hurting because it&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s fault that our gender got the short end of the stick.</p>

<p>Now for the rest of her life, she&rsquo;ll remember her first period as the time she was scared/angry and got kicked out of her home when she just wanted someone to understand her.</p>

<p>Good job guys.</p>

You made the right decision; now it&rsquo;s his turn to step up and parent his brat. IF that happens, then you can postpone their moving in until the lesson has been learned.

She’s also in a new house where she doesn’t know her role yet. Her dad has also never dealt with an 11 year old with her first period. Instead of talking to her dad and coming up with a plan you just threw up your hands and threw them out. This wasn’t some ongoing pattern it was a couple of days. Did you expect blending a family would be all sunshine and rainbows? Meet with your bf and see if you can come up with a plan</p>

Did you sit her down and explain that it is something that you go through every month, that you understand what she&rsquo;s going through and that it happens to millions of women every month and there lives simply continue?</p>

<p>Yes, I expect the downvotes, but she&rsquo;s a little girl of 11 with little girl emotions and probably a lot of social media voices in her head.</p>

<p>Whether you allow them back is up to you. She will have to understand that she will not get special treatment every month, but she&rsquo;s 11 years old! Don&rsquo;t expect her to act rationally, teenagers never do!</p>

Yea she is acting crazy, but to just write her off as horrible? Yall are horrible and OP is over reacting. Dad also has no idea how to parent this kind of situation and instead of giving some grace and working on having the next one go better you want nothing to do with them anymore? Absolutely ridiculous and they will be better without someone this cold in their lives in the long run. Feel so sorry for the poor little 11 YEAR OLD girl without her mother around&hellip;</p>

      <label for="l6hq96r" class="commentText"><p>YTA - it’s her first period, not a garden party. She ate all the chili, order Panera. This is a major, uncomfortable event in her life, and you have had a low effort, meh, whatever, I give the bare minimum of f’s attitude. Get her some ice cream. Puberty is rough. Expecting her to act like she’s 31, not 11, is short sighted. “Get out of my house!” So dramatic. It’s puberty, not a bad grade on a test, or a broken nail. Work in a room with a door on it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which is enough to prove to me that she does have control, she&rsquo;s using this as an excuse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like you’re just making an excuse, too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My BF has been blowing my phone up since, telling me this is just a bump in the road but I have never been so disgusted by anyone in my entire life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He’s right. And you’ve never been so disgusted by anyone in your entire life? Well that’s dramatic. Have you never heard of Donald Trump, John Wayne Gacey, Richard Ramirez, the <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> hijackers, or Adolf Hitler? A grumpy 11 year old on her first period is the most disgusting in your life thus far…</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She starts crying, saying she was just &ldquo;trying to make me understand&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you’re acting like you don’t, and you haven’t handled this very well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He ends up going and getting her the fucking ice cream <strong>instead of being a parent</strong> and snipping that shit in the bud.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well that’s harsh and extremely judgmental. I know plenty of people who would do that for their adult wives. Why does being a good parent to you mean ruling with an iron fist? You haven’t enjoyed her first period behavior. You have done so little to find gentle ways to navigate this. Reddit is going to tell you NTA, and that this may be an early warning sign of sociopathic behavior. But the truth is you’ve been acting like the AH. “I want to go to the beach, I want chili, I want to work in a room she has ample access to, I want to judge your parenting, I’m kicking you two out.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>she starts tweaking out. Crying, screaming. Wakes up my son.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tweaking out? That a judgmental way of putting it. Dude, she’s on her first period, and YTA. It takes just a little planning to setup a child on their first period for success. Get a few cartons of ice cream, cookies, make sure she’s comfortable, get her some movies, period supplies, period meds, a heating pad for her back. You however took a low effort approach and it blew up in your face.</p>

<p>Dude its her 1st period and at a young-ish age. Yes she needs to be talked to and she should be in trouble however, If you are allowing the BF and family to move in you need more patience and understanding. SHE&rsquo;S 11 and now she is going to associate her possible stepmom to kicking her and her dad out over a bad phase of behavior? WTF. OP is 100% the AH imo. Im a stepdad and my daughter had her thing at a young also and was confused and emotional (not this bad at all) but thats when you lay down rules, grounding. loss of electronics etc over bad behavior,. You dont kick a kid and her dad out of the house??? Thats going to cause long term emotional damage. A kid and their room is their sanctuary and safe space and you tossed destroyed that over what? a few weeks of annoyances and bad attitudes&hellip;. uh welcome to kids, they need to be corrected but instead you acted like a spoiled child yourself. Sorry about some turmoil and your precious chili but not all kids are well behaved, you dont throw them out over that&hellip;. they need help. wth is going on???</p>
