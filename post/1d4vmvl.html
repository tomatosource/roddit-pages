</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>My BF of 2 years has an 11yo daughter that just started her first ever menstrual cycle 3 days ago. He has full custody of her and they started making transitions to move in with me and my 8yo son about 2 weeks ago. Up until this point, everything was going fairly well. The kids got along and I thought Diane was a nice enough kid.</p>

<p>Anyways, she walks out of her bedroom 3 days ago and tells me she thinks she started her period and was asking me the general questions on how to wear a pad, what she can/can&rsquo;t do, etc. All is well. I let her stay home from school after calling my BF at work to confirm plans and give him the run down. She was crampy. I work from home so it was no issue. All day she interrupted my business calls to talk about her period. It was annoying but I just dealt with it because it&rsquo;s her first menstrual so obviously there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of questions. This wasn&rsquo;t even the problem. It was what followed it. She was in a great mood all day. But as soon as my BF and my son got home from work, my home turned in to a warzone. My son asked if she wanted to play with him and she screamed in his face &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my period&rdquo; and literally slammed him out of her doorway. He went flying, hit the wall. Bruised his shoulder and hit his head off the door frame. My BF went to talk to her and she starts crying. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my period, I don&rsquo;t want him near me&rdquo;. He gave her a pass for her behavior, which already pissed me off. The next day we planned a beach day (like a week ago planned it), Diane starts flipping out to a point of a full tantrum. Screaming AT me and my BF telling us that no, we would not still be going to the beach because she&rsquo;s on her period and she can&rsquo;t swim and since she can&rsquo;t, none of us can and she &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t care&rdquo; if that bothers us. My BF cancels the trip, or tried. I told him I was still bringing my kid regardless. We get back home at 3pm. When I left, I had a pot of chili in the slow cooker for dinner. I find half the pot gone. Diane had been eating out of the slow cooker. My BF told me that Diane said the only thing she wanted was chili and that since she was on her period, he had to let her. He listened to her. There wasn&rsquo;t enough to feed everyone now. We send the kids to bed at 8pm. She comes out at 9, telling her father that she needed ice cream or she &ldquo;was going to snap&rdquo;. He originally said no; she starts tweaking out. Crying, screaming. Wakes up my son. He ends up going and getting her the fucking ice cream instead of being a parent and snipping that shit in the bud.</p>

<p>Then this morning. My BF tells her she can stay home from school again because she&rsquo;s still on her period. I tell him no. I&rsquo;m working today and she interrupted me all day on my last workday. She starts flipping out, screaming at me that I&rsquo;m &ldquo;not doing anything to make her comfortable when that&rsquo;s what she needs right now&rdquo;. My BF sides with her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s her first period, we need to learn to navigate it.&rdquo; I told him again that she was NOT staying here today. He gets angry with me and says I&rsquo;m making his life harder than it has to be. His kid is still screaming at me. So, I snapped and told them to pack all their shit and leave and that I was fucking done. Said that I&rsquo;m glad she started her period so soon in to moving in so that I could get a proper assessment of how it would be full time and I would be damned I put up with this bullshit every month. They both immediately calmed down. She starts crying, saying she was just &ldquo;trying to make me understand&rdquo;. He&rsquo;s telling me I&rsquo;m being ridiculous. I stood firm however and told them to get out. They are now gone and my house is peaceful. I don&rsquo;t want them back here. My BF has been blowing my phone up since, telling me this is just a bump in the road but I have never been so disgusted by anyone in my entire life. AITA for not letting them return and telling him I&rsquo;m done?</p>

<p>I did speak to her about her aggression yesterday. I told her it wasn&rsquo;t okay to put her hands on people, to scream in my face, to demand we cater to her and break things. She says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my period, nothing I do right now can be held against me because I have no control&rdquo;. Which is enough to prove to me that she does have control, she&rsquo;s using this as an excuse.</p>

      <label for="l6h9s3t" class="commentText"><p>NTA I think this is not just her period but signs of a much bigger problem where she&rsquo;s manipulative AF and your BF always caves in to her when she acts badly instead of being a parent and putting a stop to the behavior. And he&rsquo;s also showing you that he will always take her side over you no matter how bad her behavior is. She&rsquo;s also going to bully your son. He deserves to have a peaceful and safe home and not to have to live with a bully. Living with them will be hell if you let them stay. You have the opportunity in this moment to dodge the bullet.</p>

      <label for="l6hl1qg" class="commentText"><p>NTA and I agree, this behavior seems wholesale manipulative. Hormonal or not, physically body checking your son and then claiming &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t hold me accountable because of a bodily function&rdquo; is not okay and needs to be stamped out yesterday. Also note that when she realized you were serious about consequences she immediately realized she&rsquo;d gone too far and tried to back track, while blaming you (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just trying to make you understand&rdquo;)</p>

<p>I sat my niece down and asked her if any of the older women in our family, especially me, have ever acted that way. My niece said no, but all her friends are telling her to do it.</p>

<p>I <em>want</em> to gather all her friends with their parents and sit down and talk to them about this, but my niece said that out of all her friends, only she was given the proper talk of body function and what to expect, and what might happen.</p>

<p>All her friends didn&rsquo;t know that they should be changing their pads and tampons regularly. She told them that. She also told her friends that the ones on tiktok were not giving true advice, but her friends all say it must be true because their mums would get very angry on their period.</p>

<p>I am informed my brothers to make sure they keep an eye on their daughters and, if any hint of the manipulations, to let me know. Their wives are sorta on board, but I spent 6hrs last weekend seeing the rot being told on tiktok about periods&hellip; one girl about 14, was saying you can&rsquo;t get pregnant a few days before, during, or 3 days after the period&hellip; I am getting way too old to deal with misinformation</p>

<p>There is a level of being understanding and sympathetic. 11 can be a bit young/immature to feel ready to have their first period&hellip;.. But it has happened. Nothing OP or anyone else could have done to stop it.</p>

<p>However, there is a difference between expecting grace/empathy and weaponizing the situation. She is using the experience to bully everyone to her will.</p>

<p>More than that, even if she isn&rsquo;t bullying/manipulating intentionally, she&rsquo;s going to have about 12 a year until menopause. Is bf going to coddle her twelve weeks out of the year for decades to come? OP setting boundaries is setting the kid up for success. For, as much as many menstruating people would love special time off and nuanced care, modern, capitalist society doesn&rsquo;t afford that. Uterus havers need to learn how to manage their cycle and their emotions, bc a cis-male dominated world is not going to help them or pity them.</p>

Act like a fucking psychopath and use her period as a reason to excuse her acting like a psychopath. She doesn’t hit anyone, yell at anyone, and demand extra special treatment because it’s shark week. That is crazy behavior. None of the women in my family have acted that way during shark week, most of us have gotten our periods young too. And there’s a bunch of different mental illnesses and mental disabilities sprinkled out throughout all of us too, and we don’t act like that. Like holy fuck you just dodged a nuke.</p>

<p>OP, did you consider reminding your partners daughter that you get periods too? That you have cramps and pain and the headache of changing out menstrual products too much and yet you&rsquo;d never shove her or scream at her just because of your period? It seems like she&rsquo;s not recognizing that around half the human population has periods, yet very few are nightmare humans during them. Some cultures make women live in a separate building during their period, even. She may have misunderstood how big of a deal this was because of friends or media or something.</p>

<p>Certainly not!  Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous.  He is going to expect OP to do that.</p>

<p>At no point did BF offer to stay home with her, and make sure that she was cared for, while also allowing OP to work.</p>

<p>There are only sad reasons why the mother would not want 50% custody of her daughter at the bare minimum.</p>

<p>OP calls the child &ldquo;a nice enough kid&rdquo; which indicates there was likely no connection between OP and the child in the first place. I don&rsquo;t think she wants to be this child&rsquo;s maternal figure.</p>

      <label for="l6hmjev" class="commentText"><p>I think every woman can agree that periods suck to some extent. For some women, it&rsquo;s not too bad, just an annoyance and something to deal with. For other women it can be debilitating and stop them in their tracks. It can also fluctuate every month!</p>

<p>But none of that gives anyone an excuse to put hands on someone else. Higher emotions, more sensitivity, sure. But violence is not acceptable.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve cried because of my period. Been in fetal position, waiting for the pain to pass. I&rsquo;ve gritted my teeth and done presentations at school and at work during horrible cramps because the world keeps going even if your uterus wants to kill you.</p>

<p>I have never known someone to use their cycle to excuse violent behavior. The fact that her father gave that a pass is a problem. I wouldn&rsquo;t feel like my younger kid would be safe, unless I&rsquo;m around. The BF can&rsquo;t be trusted to see to his safety, because he&rsquo;ll just give her a pass.</p>

PMDD can be a utter hell and make you aggressive but people suffering from that are not aware that’s what’s happening and certainly not saying “”you can’t hold it against me because I’m on my period””.

I too was a different person but most concerningly my mental health <strong><em>plummeted</em></strong> smh. It’s scary. It took way too many years of MH crises to realize they were happening the week before and of my period. I wasn’t really suicidal just suffering from PMDD. Im pissed and annoyed that nobody clocked that and I went through hell for so long and had to figure it out myself. Smh.</p>

<p>Because of the endometriosis I’m on treatment that totally stops my periods so no more PMDD thank god. My life is a hell of a lot more stable now.</p>

They don&rsquo;t make you scream at, or hit people, and PMS is not an excuse to do so.  Girls who let other girls get away with it and boys who just write it off as PMS are a huge problem.  I do empathize with the bf a <em>tiny</em> bit, raising a girl by his onsies and her hitting puberty is probably super stressful, but he&rsquo;s completely off the rock with his enabling.  OP doesn&rsquo;t hit HIM and scream everything she&rsquo;s on his period, why does he think it&rsquo;s okay that his daughter uses her period as an excuse to be abusive?</p>

She&rsquo;s probably lashing out because she&rsquo;s resentful and angry that this is her reality, but nobody parented her through it or comforted her about it.</p>

<p>It was 100% the job of the adults to ask what was going on with her, ask why she was acting the way she was acting, and explain what the reality of a period actually is and what accomodations are acceptable.
She literally said she just wanted them to understand.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s 11 confronting a huge life change that even adult women hate and struggle with. Of course she&rsquo;s mad that she will never again be able to just go to the beach without timing it correctly or managing her period somehow.</p>

<p>i started my period at 10. you know what i did? asked my parents to stay home bc i thought it was a stomach ache. woke up, mom gave me a pad, and told me “you’re not sick, so i won’t ban you from electronics”. i stayed home 2 days bc the pain was so intense. i have NEVER in my life EVER acted like that! and i’ve had pcos for years, it causes mood swings!</p>

<p>she’s probably hormonal, but i also think she’s attempting to get away with more now. eating almost all of a dinner YOU prepared, demanding shit, i could NEVER! my dad would’ve yelled and whooped me for that level of disrespect (i don’t agree with physical discipline but he did). regardless, her behavior is just not okay. she can’t go about life treating everyone horribly for a week out of every month (or longer! some people’s hormones kick in a week or so before the actual start date. i have a week of cramping before i bleed)</p>

<p>Please change all locks and get a security system. I doubt that he is just letting you go. You have to protect yourself and your kid, so take the proper measures. Don&rsquo;t forget that you only know how the other person is when you break up with them.</p>

Going by a comment you made, she acted violently even before she started her period, and now she&rsquo;s just using her period as an excuse to be an utter monster. Claiming she has no control over herself when she has her period is not only bullshit but plays into the worst misogynistic tropes about women.</p>

<p>You have to protect your own child. Her committing battery against your kid is inexcusable.</p>

<p>I can definitely see someone, abandoned by her mom, left with a milk-toast dad, and having to get period advice from a disinterested woman that she&rsquo;s about to move in with as being at the absolute end of her rope. But she&rsquo;s been raised to never process her emotions fully, and dumping a ton of crap on her at this age is a perfect storm.</p>

<p>She needs help, for one reason or another, and if OP doesn&rsquo;t want to be saddled with it, then she&rsquo;s right to kick them out.</p>

Her comment that she can’t be held responsible for anything she does because she has no control is utter bs. And a huge red flag. Someone or something taught her that entitlement.</p>

<p>Her father should have put a stop to that IMMEDIATELY. He needed to teach her that her behavior was unacceptable, instead of just trying to appease the monster he let her transform into.</p>

<p>OP is absolutely in the right. You assault my child, you get out of my house. Period.</p>

      <label for="l6hrs1x" class="commentText"><p>She is acting out the role of “girl on her period.” At some point she learned that this is somehow an appropriate way to behave while menstruating. Someone needs to talk to her about reasonable accommodations, and that they don’t include completely throwing all acceptable behavior out of the window.</p>

<p>Hell, a lot of people wouldn’t even consider letting her stay home from school, so she’s already getting way more accommodation than many. I get the sense that her idea of PMS and menstruation is totally out of balance with reality, and probably came from some social media bubble or other tweens (or selfish adult behavior in her life).</p>

<p>I honestly feel for her in a way, despite how absolutely wrong all of her actions are. The adults in her life totally let her down, and continue to do so.</p>

It is really strange that your ex never considered that you as a woman and having grown up with other women and girls, would know a thing about periods. So that it was possible that you were not being unreasonable. Also, I have never seen or heard anyone acting aggressive and sabotaging others because they are on their period and say to cut them slack, because period.</p>

<p>Diane will eventually learn that only daddy is going to dote on her like she is his pregnant, demanding wife, when she uses having her period as an excuse to torment others.</p>

      <label for="l6hfmo9" class="commentText"><p>NTA. The way I see it, this is less about her period and more about your boyfriend&rsquo;s parenting style. Yes, your first period can be a bit traumatic and you have to learn to adjust, but you can&rsquo;t just turn into a monster. It&rsquo;s a parent&rsquo;s job to help their child navigate the situation and the new feelings it brings up. It is not the parent&rsquo;s job to allow them to assault siblings or demand whatever they want. He is setting the precedent for how her period will be treated every month, and it is not a good precedent.</p>

<p>Just block the bf. He is part of the problem. And to assault your son. Nope, sorry. She should have been punished then.</p>

      <label for="l6hgjd5" class="commentText"><p>A period is NOT an excuse to be an abusive, entitled asshole. Regardless if it is her first one, she is using it as an excuse to act like a cunt and your ex-BF was enabling that behavior instead of correcting her and flexing his authority as a parent.</p>

<p>That said, some people do have what is called Pre Menstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD), which is like a severe form of PMS. It results in violent mood swings, irritability, and irrational behavior. I believe it&rsquo;s related to a hormonal imbalance. Based on how manipulative she was with this, I doubt this is the case.</p>

<p>NTA. You saved yourself a lot of stress and heartache down the road. Until your ex grows up and stops letting his kid run the house, this is only going to get worse.</p>

      <label for="l6hgqv4" class="commentText"><p>This is not about how she behaved while on her period. This is about your (ex) BF’s reaction.  He needed to tell her that her behavior was unacceptable, and to hold the line as a parent.</p>

<p>You are right that it is great that this happened now. Because this isn’t about periods. This is about your BF being a permissive parent to his child, which is not the way you parent. Living together would be a disaster, as you have a son you are parenting differently.</p>

<p>NTA. Good for you, actually.</p>

      <label for="l6hml9q" class="commentText"><p>Where did she hear she can&rsquo;t be held responsible? You state this is her first period but she HAS to have learned that from someone. Maybe her birth mom?</p>

<p>NTA I started my period when I was 7 years told. No one believed me, made me go to church. I remember being in a cold sweat, in a lot of pain and just uncomfortable. I got home and my foster mom made me pull down my underwear. Long story short I was told immediately what was going on and what to expect. But the point that stuck home was my mother said</p>

<p>&ldquo;Having your period is not an excuse to treat others like total shit. This will happen every month, you will feel differently but you must not show it. You must go about your day and IF you are ever in a bad mood then you need to learn how to calm down&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have never ONCE acted crazy on me period. Even when I was diagnosed with several diseases. No one has ever been able to tell when I PMS.  If I could manage at AGE 7 she can most certainly manage at 11. I had my childhood stolen from me at a young age, you have no idea the trauma that brings. I was made fun of in school because sometimes i would leak. I also learned to use Tampons when I was 11 in order to go swimming with my friends, I understand not everyone is comfortable with that but since I started so young I was ready.</p>

      <label for="l6hnl2o" class="commentText"><p>NTA but the issue isn’t how she acts on her period, it’s that your bf isn’t parenting her.</p>

<p>My first period, i was a MONSTER. I literally had no control bc i had never experienced such intense, hormonal emotions. My grandfather, who was absolutely sick of my shit (no one was putting up with it, nor should they have, and i still was a monster), came over and kissed me on my head and whispered “we do love you” after the horrible way I’d been treating them and i just burst. I broke completely. We were on a family vacation and it was the worst trip of all our lives for multiple reasons. My periods were still incredibly rough through middle school and high school….. and then again after becoming a mother 😒, but once i got through that first experience it definitely got easier. And as bad as any other time got, it was nothing like that first time.</p>

<p>The point is, my family didn’t put up with my behavior, we fought and it was hell on earth, but they still showed love and support. They only called out my shitty behavior but didn’t pick on me or drag it out. Having both discipline and support was really important for me through that transition. It taught me how to behave through my extreme emotions, but it also showed me i was loved and supported. Your bf can still give that to his daughter without giving into her every whim. Those hormonal emotions are horrible, no one should be feeding into them.</p>

<p>That moment of a genuine expression of love when i was at my lowest was all i really needed, and it made things so much more bearable. It definitely felt better than getting my way would have, bc getting my way wasn’t actually what i wanted or needed. He did it at the right moment, when i was done yelling, i was done talking to all of them, i was just hate and rage and resentment. He really saw me in that moment though, that i was suffering and alone in it, that memory is everything to me even though it was something i already knew.</p>

      <label for="l6hnyl7" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m wondering if she heard or read somewhere online that periods can make women irritable and that women should &lsquo;get a pass&rsquo; when they&rsquo;re on their period for their behavior.</p>

<p>I know everyone is different, but that&rsquo;s not how I or anyone I knew behaved when we got our period, for me I was just in bed all day, was never actually violent.</p>

<p>Well, hope they figure it out, but not your problem anymore.</p>

      <label for="l6hqbp1" class="commentText"><p>The fact that she expressed that she couldn&rsquo;t be held accountable for her actions, combined with her worsening behavior when her father got home, adds up to this being hogwash. She kept her mood in check with you alone, because she knew you wouldn&rsquo;t permit her to behave poorly. She acted like a brat when her father was home to see what he&rsquo;d allow, and he gave her the green light to become a monster.<br>
You did the right thing by protecting your son. NTA. The biggest a-hole here is your boyfriend. Kids are kids, and they largely behave based on what is permitted by their parents. He&rsquo;s too permissive, and her behavior is going to be atrocious as a result. While I&rsquo;m sure this time is uncomfortable and scary for your boyfriend, he&rsquo;s establishing a precedent that will get harder and harder to break the longer it goes on.</p>
