</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>My BF of 2 years has an 11yo daughter that just started her first ever menstrual cycle 3 days ago. He has full custody of her and they started making transitions to move in with me and my 8yo son about 2 weeks ago. Up until this point, everything was going fairly well. The kids got along and I thought Diane was a nice enough kid.</p>

<p>Anyways, she walks out of her bedroom 3 days ago and tells me she thinks she started her period and was asking me the general questions on how to wear a pad, what she can/can&rsquo;t do, etc. All is well. I let her stay home from school after calling my BF at work to confirm plans and give him the run down. She was crampy. I work from home so it was no issue. All day she interrupted my business calls to talk about her period. It was annoying but I just dealt with it because it&rsquo;s her first menstrual so obviously there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of questions. This wasn&rsquo;t even the problem. It was what followed it. She was in a great mood all day. But as soon as my BF and my son got home from work, my home turned in to a warzone. My son asked if she wanted to play with him and she screamed in his face &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my period&rdquo; and literally slammed him out of her doorway. He went flying, hit the wall. Bruised his shoulder and hit his head off the door frame. My BF went to talk to her and she starts crying. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my period, I don&rsquo;t want him near me&rdquo;. He gave her a pass for her behavior, which already pissed me off. The next day we planned a beach day (like a week ago planned it), Diane starts flipping out to a point of a full tantrum. Screaming AT me and my BF telling us that no, we would not still be going to the beach because she&rsquo;s on her period and she can&rsquo;t swim and since she can&rsquo;t, none of us can and she &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t care&rdquo; if that bothers us. My BF cancels the trip, or tried. I told him I was still bringing my kid regardless. We get back home at 3pm. When I left, I had a pot of chili in the slow cooker for dinner. I find half the pot gone. Diane had been eating out of the slow cooker. My BF told me that Diane said the only thing she wanted was chili and that since she was on her period, he had to let her. He listened to her. There wasn&rsquo;t enough to feed everyone now. We send the kids to bed at 8pm. She comes out at 9, telling her father that she needed ice cream or she &ldquo;was going to snap&rdquo;. He originally said no; she starts tweaking out. Crying, screaming. Wakes up my son. He ends up going and getting her the fucking ice cream instead of being a parent and snipping that shit in the bud.</p>

<p>Then this morning. My BF tells her she can stay home from school again because she&rsquo;s still on her period. I tell him no. I&rsquo;m working today and she interrupted me all day on my last workday. She starts flipping out, screaming at me that I&rsquo;m &ldquo;not doing anything to make her comfortable when that&rsquo;s what she needs right now&rdquo;. My BF sides with her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s her first period, we need to learn to navigate it.&rdquo; I told him again that she was NOT staying here today. He gets angry with me and says I&rsquo;m making his life harder than it has to be. His kid is still screaming at me. So, I snapped and told them to pack all their shit and leave and that I was fucking done. Said that I&rsquo;m glad she started her period so soon in to moving in so that I could get a proper assessment of how it would be full time and I would be damned I put up with this bullshit every month. They both immediately calmed down. She starts crying, saying she was just &ldquo;trying to make me understand&rdquo;. He&rsquo;s telling me I&rsquo;m being ridiculous. I stood firm however and told them to get out. They are now gone and my house is peaceful. I don&rsquo;t want them back here. My BF has been blowing my phone up since, telling me this is just a bump in the road but I have never been so disgusted by anyone in my entire life. AITA for not letting them return and telling him I&rsquo;m done?</p>

<p>I did speak to her about her aggression yesterday. I told her it wasn&rsquo;t okay to put her hands on people, to scream in my face, to demand we cater to her and break things. She says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my period, nothing I do right now can be held against me because I have no control&rdquo;. Which is enough to prove to me that she does have control, she&rsquo;s using this as an excuse.</p>

      <label for="l6h9s3t" class="commentText"><p>NTA I think this is not just her period but signs of a much bigger problem where she&rsquo;s manipulative AF and your BF always caves in to her when she acts badly instead of being a parent and putting a stop to the behavior. And he&rsquo;s also showing you that he will always take her side over you no matter how bad her behavior is. She&rsquo;s also going to bully your son. He deserves to have a peaceful and safe home and not to have to live with a bully. Living with them will be hell if you let them stay. You have the opportunity in this moment to dodge the bullet.</p>

      <label for="l6hl1qg" class="commentText"><p>NTA and I agree, this behavior seems wholesale manipulative. Hormonal or not, physically body checking your son and then claiming &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t hold me accountable because of a bodily function&rdquo; is not okay and needs to be stamped out yesterday. Also note that when she realized you were serious about consequences she immediately realized she&rsquo;d gone too far and tried to back track, while blaming you (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just trying to make you understand&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Time to tell her that no one GAF about her period. Women have had them for millions of years. We don’t get to smack a bitch because we’re surfing the crimson wave. Not even when it’s more like a tsunami.</p>

<p>Thank gods my daughter didn’t pull that shit when she got her first period.</p>

My sister was always waaaayyyyy too permissive/dismissive to her daughter&rsquo;s behavior, and when they moved in with me, I decided to nip that in the bud immediately. It took three months of her trying me before she eventually gave up and started acting right. I only had to throw down once, but she got the message, lol. She still walks all over my sister, but ALWAYS treats me with respect.</p>

I won&rsquo;t put up with that. Now, we&rsquo;ve always gotten along like champs, but if you want to start acting snotty to me, I have NO problems being the heavy. From this point forward you get to decide if we&rsquo;ll continue to have a pleasant relationship or a contentious one. The one thing you won&rsquo;t get is a pass from me.&rdquo; Since then she&rsquo;s never been a problem with me. She&rsquo;s now 27 and ♪awesome♪!</p>

I would call her bluff: tell the BF if the kid is legitimately unable to control her behavior/impulses during her period, something is very wrong and the girl needs immediate psychiatric evaluation. Act super concerned and do not let it drop, pointing out that never in OP&rsquo;s years of menstruating has she lost control like that. Women in professional settings are not slapping people who behave poorly and saying they can&rsquo;t be held accountable because they&rsquo;re having their periods. Believe me, we would all have taken the opportunity to slug a douchebag customer/student/coworker if lack of consequences due to periods were a thing.</p>

<p>I sat my niece down and asked her if any of the older women in our family, especially me, have ever acted that way. My niece said no, but all her friends are telling her to do it.</p>

<p>I <em>want</em> to gather all her friends with their parents and sit down and talk to them about this, but my niece said that out of all her friends, only she was given the proper talk of body function and what to expect, and what might happen.</p>

<p>All her friends didn&rsquo;t know that they should be changing their pads and tampons regularly. She told them that. She also told her friends that the ones on tiktok were not giving true advice, but her friends all say it must be true because their mums would get very angry on their period.</p>

<p>I am informed my brothers to make sure they keep an eye on their daughters and, if any hint of the manipulations, to let me know. Their wives are sorta on board, but I spent 6hrs last weekend seeing the rot being told on tiktok about periods&hellip; one girl about 14, was saying you can&rsquo;t get pregnant a few days before, during, or 3 days after the period&hellip; I am getting way too old to deal with misinformation</p>

<p>There is a level of being understanding and sympathetic. 11 can be a bit young/immature to feel ready to have their first period&hellip;.. But it has happened. Nothing OP or anyone else could have done to stop it.</p>

<p>However, there is a difference between expecting grace/empathy and weaponizing the situation. She is using the experience to bully everyone to her will.</p>

<p>More than that, even if she isn&rsquo;t bullying/manipulating intentionally, she&rsquo;s going to have about 12 a year until menopause. Is bf going to coddle her twelve weeks out of the year for decades to come? OP setting boundaries is setting the kid up for success. For, as much as many menstruating people would love special time off and nuanced care, modern, capitalist society doesn&rsquo;t afford that. Uterus havers need to learn how to manage their cycle and their emotions, bc a cis-male dominated world is not going to help them or pity them.</p>

She gets cramps, gets cranky, and hides out in her room more than usual when it’s shark week. You know what she doesn’t do? Act like a fucking psychopath and use her period as a reason to excuse her acting like a psychopath. She doesn’t hit anyone, yell at anyone, and demand extra special treatment because it’s shark week. That is crazy behavior. None of the women in my family have acted that way during shark week, most of us have gotten our periods young too. And there’s a bunch of different mental illnesses and mental disabilities sprinkled out throughout all of us too, and we don’t act like that. Like holy fuck you just dodged a nuke.</p>

<p>OP, did you consider reminding your partners daughter that you get periods too? That you have cramps and pain and the headache of changing out menstrual products too much and yet you&rsquo;d never shove her or scream at her just because of your period? It seems like she&rsquo;s not recognizing that around half the human population has periods, yet very few are nightmare humans during them. Some cultures make women live in a separate building during their period, even. She may have misunderstood how big of a deal this was because of friends or media or something.</p>

      <label for="l6hl3o0" class="commentText"><p>I think it depends on if this behavior is new or not. For some people hormones can really mess with your emotions during your period. Its not an excuse to act awful of course but recognizing the issue and addressing it is much more beneficial to everyone in the long run.</p>

<li><p>She hit your son, actually threw him at the wall - an 8 year old child. That&rsquo;s is not a safe environment for your son</p></li>

For other women it can be debilitating and stop them in their tracks. It can also fluctuate every month!</p>

<p>But none of that gives anyone an excuse to put hands on someone else. Higher emotions, more sensitivity, sure. But violence is not acceptable.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve cried because of my period. Been in fetal position, waiting for the pain to pass. I&rsquo;ve gritted my teeth and done presentations at school and at work during horrible cramps because the world keeps going even if your uterus wants to kill you.</p>

I too was a different person but most concerningly my mental health <strong><em>plummeted</em></strong> smh. It’s scary. It took way too many years of MH crises to realize they were happening the week before and of my period. I wasn’t really suicidal just suffering from PMDD. Im pissed and annoyed that nobody clocked that and I went through hell for so long and had to figure it out myself. Smh.</p>

<p>Because of the endometriosis I’m on treatment that totally stops my periods so no more PMDD thank god. My life is a hell of a lot more stable now.</p>

They don&rsquo;t make you scream at, or hit people, and PMS is not an excuse to do so.  Girls who let other girls get away with it and boys who just write it off as PMS are a huge problem.  I do empathize with the bf a <em>tiny</em> bit, raising a girl by his onsies and her hitting puberty is probably super stressful, but he&rsquo;s completely off the rock with his enabling.  OP doesn&rsquo;t hit HIM and scream everything she&rsquo;s on his period, why does he think it&rsquo;s okay that his daughter uses her period as an excuse to be abusive?</p>

She&rsquo;s probably lashing out because she&rsquo;s resentful and angry that this is her reality, but nobody parented her through it or comforted her about it.</p>

<p>It was 100% the job of the adults to ask what was going on with her, ask why she was acting the way she was acting, and explain what the reality of a period actually is and what accomodations are acceptable.
She literally said she just wanted them to understand.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s 11 confronting a huge life change that even adult women hate and struggle with. Of course she&rsquo;s mad that she will never again be able to just go to the beach without timing it correctly or managing her period somehow.</p>

<p>Like&hellip;.neither of these adults stepped up to the plate and everyone&rsquo;s mad at a child???</p>

<p>i started my period at 10. you know what i did? asked my parents to stay home bc i thought it was a stomach ache. woke up, mom gave me a pad, and told me “you’re not sick, so i won’t ban you from electronics”. i stayed home 2 days bc the pain was so intense. i have NEVER in my life EVER acted like that! and i’ve had pcos for years, it causes mood swings!</p>

<p>she’s probably hormonal, but i also think she’s attempting to get away with more now. eating almost all of a dinner YOU prepared, demanding shit, i could NEVER! my dad would’ve yelled and whooped me for that level of disrespect (i don’t agree with physical discipline but he did). regardless, her behavior is just not okay. she can’t go about life treating everyone horribly for a week out of every month (or longer! some people’s hormones kick in a week or so before the actual start date. i have a week of cramping before i bleed)</p>

<p>I can definitely see someone, abandoned by her mom, left with a milk-toast dad, and having to get period advice from a disinterested woman that she&rsquo;s about to move in with as being at the absolute end of her rope. But she&rsquo;s been raised to never process her emotions fully, and dumping a ton of crap on her at this age is a perfect storm.</p>

<p>She needs help, for one reason or another, and if OP doesn&rsquo;t want to be saddled with it, then she&rsquo;s right to kick them out.</p>

      <label for="l6hrs1x" class="commentText"><p>She is acting out the role of “girl on her period.” At some point she learned that this is somehow an appropriate way to behave while menstruating. Someone needs to talk to her about reasonable accommodations, and that they don’t include completely throwing all acceptable behavior out of the window.</p>

<p>Hell, a lot of people wouldn’t even consider letting her stay home from school, so she’s already getting way more accommodation than many. I get the sense that her idea of PMS and menstruation is totally out of balance with reality, and probably came from some social media bubble or other tweens (or selfish adult behavior in her life).</p>

<p>I honestly feel for her in a way, despite how absolutely wrong all of her actions are. The adults in her life totally let her down, and continue to do so.</p>

      <label for="l6hs1q5" class="commentText"><p>Going against the grain, I guess. YTA and so is your bf.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s. 11. She just realized her life as she knew it is over, she will be dealing with blood and pain every month for decades. Her childhood will never be carefree ever again; she&rsquo;s going to have to go to school in what feels like a diaper, and the adults she is looking to are not consoling her or providing guidance.
She&rsquo;s scared, upset, bitter, who knows? Not you guys because you didn&rsquo;t sit and talk with her about how she feels.</p>

<p>How hard would it have been when she interrupts your work to say, &ldquo;Hey, this is a BIG change. I know it&rsquo;s scary, but I&rsquo;ve been doing this for years. Why don&rsquo;t you and I have a special girls&rsquo; night? Pick a dessert and let&rsquo;s go out tonight and talk about it. I&rsquo;ve got your back, and I can answer any questions or worries you have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When she&rsquo;s upset about the beach, how hard is it to say, &ldquo;I know it sucks to miss out on things because of your period. I&rsquo;ve been there. We will have to time it better next time! Once you&rsquo;re older, there are ways to still swim using more advanced menstrual products but just be patient with yourself through these changes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dad just panicked and let her try to become a tyrant when she just needed to be sat down and told that, unfortunately, she still has to be kind to people even if she&rsquo;s hurting because it&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s fault that our gender got the short end of the stick.</p>

<p>Now for the rest of her life, she&rsquo;ll remember her first period as the time she was scared/angry and got kicked out of her home when she just wanted someone to understand her.</p>

<p>Good job guys.</p>

      <label for="l6hwnnw" class="commentText"><p>Literally 11 years old. Her dad doesn’t set clear boundaries or let her know what behavior is and isn’t acceptable, there aren’t repercussions for acting out, and nobody seems to be offering compassion for her dealing with difficulty and pain paired with the understanding that she still needs to act in ways that don’t hurt others. There’s a very wide middle ground between the choices “allow a child to tantrum and rampage” and “throw a child onto the street” and it doesn’t seem like that middle ground got explored at all.</p>

<p>The problem is the dad’s unwillingness to parent and allowance of harmful behavior, not a young child acting immature and unreasonable.</p>

She’s also in a new house where she doesn’t know her role yet. Her dad has also never dealt with an 11 year old with her first period. Instead of talking to her dad and coming up with a plan you just threw up your hands and threw them out. This wasn’t some ongoing pattern it was a couple of days. Did you expect blending a family would be all sunshine and rainbows? Meet with your bf and see if you can come up with a plan</p>

      <label for="l6hml9q" class="commentText"><p>Where did she hear she can&rsquo;t be held responsible? You state this is her first period but she HAS to have learned that from someone. Maybe her birth mom?</p>

<p>NTA I started my period when I was 7 years told. No one believed me, made me go to church. I remember being in a cold sweat, in a lot of pain and just uncomfortable. I got home and my foster mom made me pull down my underwear. Long story short I was told immediately what was going on and what to expect. But the point that stuck home was my mother said</p>

<p>&ldquo;Having your period is not an excuse to treat others like total shit. This will happen every month, you will feel differently but you must not show it. You must go about your day and IF you are ever in a bad mood then you need to learn how to calm down&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have never ONCE acted crazy on me period. Even when I was diagnosed with several diseases. No one has ever been able to tell when I PMS.  If I could manage at AGE 7 she can most certainly manage at 11. I had my childhood stolen from me at a young age, you have no idea the trauma that brings. I was made fun of in school because sometimes i would leak. I also learned to use Tampons when I was 11 in order to go swimming with my friends, I understand not everyone is comfortable with that but since I started so young I was ready.</p>

      <label for="l6hnl2o" class="commentText"><p>NTA but the issue isn’t how she acts on her period, it’s that your bf isn’t parenting her.</p>

<p>My first period, i was a MONSTER. I literally had no control bc i had never experienced such intense, hormonal emotions. My grandfather, who was absolutely sick of my shit (no one was putting up with it, nor should they have, and i still was a monster), came over and kissed me on my head and whispered “we do love you” after the horrible way I’d been treating them and i just burst. I broke completely. We were on a family vacation and it was the worst trip of all our lives for multiple reasons. My periods were still incredibly rough through middle school and high school….. and then again after becoming a mother 😒, but once i got through that first experience it definitely got easier. And as bad as any other time got, it was nothing like that first time.</p>

<p>The point is, my family didn’t put up with my behavior, we fought and it was hell on earth, but they still showed love and support. They only called out my shitty behavior but didn’t pick on me or drag it out. Having both discipline and support was really important for me through that transition. It taught me how to behave through my extreme emotions, but it also showed me i was loved and supported. Your bf can still give that to his daughter without giving into her every whim. Those hormonal emotions are horrible, no one should be feeding into them.</p>

<p>That moment of a genuine expression of love when i was at my lowest was all i really needed, and it made things so much more bearable. It definitely felt better than getting my way would have, bc getting my way wasn’t actually what i wanted or needed. He did it at the right moment, when i was done yelling, i was done talking to all of them, i was just hate and rage and resentment. He really saw me in that moment though, that i was suffering and alone in it, that memory is everything to me even though it was something i already knew.</p>

Nowhere in there did you tell your BF y&rsquo;all need to sit down and have a legitimate talk about the parenting strategy here as you two are clearly not on the same page. So then you make a long-term snap decision out of anger? Obviously the BF didn&rsquo;t do what you expected him to do, that&rsquo;s why you have that convo then go from there!!</p>

<p>Daughter is being an asshole, boyfriend is being an asshole, and so are you.</p>

Did you sit her down and explain that it is something that you go through every month, that you understand what she&rsquo;s going through and that it happens to millions of women every month and there lives simply continue?</p>

<p>Yes, I expect the downvotes, but she&rsquo;s a little girl of 11 with little girl emotions and probably a lot of social media voices in her head.</p>

<p>Whether you allow them back is up to you. She will have to understand that she will not get special treatment every month, but she&rsquo;s 11 years old! Don&rsquo;t expect her to act rationally, teenagers never do!</p>
