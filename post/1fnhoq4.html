<p>The idea that people on r/nba have that Stockton is better than Isiah is beyond ridiculous and pure stat sheet watching.</p>

      <label for="loilfp6" class="commentText"><p>During his peak, Thomas raised his play considerably in the playoffs. He was also the primary option for an offensively-challenged team, which meant he faced double teams much more than Stockton, who played with Karl Malone. So Thomas’s three year peak playoff performance in 1988, 1989, and 1990 was better than any three year period of Stockton’s playoff performance.</p>

<p>But Thomas’s career was cut short by injuries, while Stockton’s career was extraordinarily long. At age 31 Thomas was significantly hobbled, and he played his last game at age 32.</p>

<p>Stockton, however, played at a high level through age 39, and played his last game at age 41. So Stockton’s cumulative career stats are far more impressive.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in 1991-92 there was no question that Stockton was playing better than Thomas. The only way Thomas could have made the 1992 Olympic Dream Team is if he had been grandfathered in based on past achievements like Larry Bird, whose play had also been diminished by injuries. But as good as Thomas was, he was never on the level of Larry Bird.</p>

<p>Indeed, many people don’t realize that Thomas was passed over for the Dream Team twice, the first time for Stockton and the second time for Clyde Drexler. And both Stockton and Drexler deserved the honor more than Thomas at that point in their respective careers.</p>

<p>Would he probably be looked at in a better light if he padded his stats but never won, maybe. But he won 2 championship in the era of Magic, Bird, and Jordan.</p>

      <label for="loj7gup" class="commentText"><p>Zeke deserves his flowers but I’d still take Stockton over him. (Cue the downvotes).</p>

<p>We’re talking about a guy that was heavily undersized in a physical era, didn’t start his first three seasons and still averaged 7&amp;7(while only playing 21mins/game). Add to that 16 more seasons and it’s incredible for someone to average a double double over that long of a career (One of only two players to average double figures assists over a whole career).He’s the definition of consistency. Stockton has numerous records and accolades like all time leader in steals and assists (around 3,800 more assists than second place J.Kidd and more than 550 more steals than second place J Kidd.)</p>

<p>Once he became a starter he averaged around 15 pts a game on less than 10 shots with 57% shooting. 8 years in a row led the league in assists (record).</p>

<p>Yes, those are some of the stats you probably mean when you mention stat watching? So let’s talk about some things that don’t come up often when looking at stat sheets. He was known for setting some of the hardest picks in the league (according to charles barkley). Payton said he was the hardest player to guard (harder than MJ). The Jazz made the playoffs 19 years in a row. Phil Jackson said both finals against Utah were the hardest of the Bulls 6 titles not to mention nearly every game in the first matchup was decided in the final minute. He missed only 22 games over a 19 year career (18 in 1 season due to an injury, so 4 missed games over 18 years aside from that season).</p>

<p>I could keep going with all the accolades he has and pull more stats out but I think you get the idea. Stockton was one of if not the purest PG the NBA has seen. Zeke was a great PG, Top 10
PG all time, but Stockton was miles ahead.</p>

<li><p>In &lsquo;88, the reffing nonsense at the end of Games 6 and 7 screwed Detroit, plus Isiah&rsquo;s insane injury in Game 6.</p></li>

<li><p>In &lsquo;91, Isiah had wrist surgery halfway through the year, and at that point they were better than the Bulls.
