      <label for="loilfp6" class="commentText"><p>During his peak, Thomas raised his play considerably in the playoffs. He was also the primary option for an offensively-challenged team, which meant he faced double teams much more than Stockton, who played with Karl Malone. So Thomas’s three year peak playoff performance in 1988, 1989, and 1990 was better than any three year period of Stockton’s playoff performance.</p>

<p>But Thomas’s career was cut short by injuries, while Stockton’s career was extraordinarily long. At age 31 Thomas was significantly hobbled, and he played his last game at age 32.</p>

<p>Stockton, however, played at a high level through age 39, and played his last game at age 41. So Stockton’s cumulative career stats are far more impressive.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in 1991-92 there was no question that Stockton was playing better than Thomas. The only way Thomas could have made the 1992 Olympic Dream Team is if he had been grandfathered in based on past achievements like Larry Bird, whose play had also been diminished by injuries. But as good as Thomas was, he was never on the level of Larry Bird.</p>

<p>Indeed, many people don’t realize that Thomas was passed over for the Dream Team twice, the first time for Stockton and the second time for Clyde Drexler. And both Stockton and Drexler deserved the honor more than Thomas at that point in their respective careers.</p>

<p>Would he probably be looked at in a better light if he padded his stats but never won, maybe. But he won 2 championship in the era of Magic, Bird, and Jordan.</p>

<p>And if you compare that to Jordan and the Bulls, the gap between Jordan and his next highest scoring teammate was quite large.</p>

<p>The pistons were all in on the sacrifice for the team aspect. It was set up in such a way that if any of the starters got subbed out, the efficiency of the team didn&rsquo;t drop all that much compared to the superstar led teams when they were down their key player(s).</p>

<p>They have a bad reputation for the physical and rough style they deployed (and all the shit housing that came with it) but as a unit, the championship pistons were without equal.</p>

      <label for="loj7gup" class="commentText"><p>Zeke deserves his flowers but I’d still take Stockton over him. (Cue the downvotes).</p>

<p>We’re talking about a guy that was heavily undersized in a physical era, didn’t start his first three seasons and still averaged 7&amp;7(while only playing 21mins/game). Add to that 16 more seasons and it’s incredible for someone to average a double double over that long of a career (One of only two players to average double figures assists over a whole career).He’s the definition of consistency. Stockton has numerous records and accolades like all time leader in steals and assists (around 3,800 more assists than second place J.Kidd and more than 550 more steals than second place J Kidd.)</p>

<p>Once he became a starter he averaged around 15 pts a game on less than 10 shots with 57% shooting. 8 years in a row led the league in assists (record).</p>

<p>Yes, those are some of the stats you probably mean when you mention stat watching? So let’s talk about some things that don’t come up often when looking at stat sheets. He was known for setting some of the hardest picks in the league (according to charles barkley). Payton said he was the hardest player to guard (harder than MJ). The Jazz made the playoffs 19 years in a row. Phil Jackson said both finals against Utah were the hardest of the Bulls 6 titles not to mention nearly every game in the first matchup was decided in the final minute. He missed only 22 games over a 19 year career (18 in 1 season due to an injury, so 4 missed games over 18 years aside from that season).</p>

<p>I could keep going with all the accolades he has and pull more stats out but I think you get the idea. Stockton was one of if not the purest PG the NBA has seen. Zeke was a great PG, Top 10
PG all time, but Stockton was miles ahead.</p>

<p>I believe Isiah is the better player but I’m not going to hate on somebody thinking the two are equals.</p>

<p>On top of Isiah’s skillsets, which came very rare for a guard at that size in that era, his toughness and leadership were instrumental to Pistons beating teams like Celtics, Lakers and Bulls (repeatedly).</p>

<p>He was just so quick in blitzing through the defenders, scoring over walls that are ready to throw him down, while finding open guys.</p>

<li><p>In &lsquo;91, Isiah had wrist surgery halfway through the year, and at that point they were better than the Bulls. He rushed back for the playoffs, but then suffered a massive foot sprain in the round before facing Chicago that was so bad he missed multiple games and lost lots of playing time when he did return. Isiah was in BAD shape by the time he squared up with the Bulls, and 3 of the 4 games that series were close.</p></li>

I think the narratives that the NBA and Nike have built up over time about MJ&rsquo;s inevitable ascension have glossed over and effectively erased a ton of context (<em>notably that Chicago won the war of attrition starting in &lsquo;91 as Boston, Detroit, and LA all fell off to massive injuries</em>), the likes of which leads me to disagree with you.</p>

      <label for="lojzhgy" class="commentText"><p>Fair enough, BUT&hellip;</p>

<p>How would the league adapt to stop a &ldquo;star-less&rdquo; team that was deep as hell with B-plus guys who all worked hard, were pathological in their pursuit of winning, were all smart and diabolical in ways that directly made opponents worse, gave up minutes to each other without whining (<em>AD was the closest, and he got traded</em>), were tough as you can imagine on the interior, had a slew of good defenders, had multiple good outside shooters (<em>rare for the time</em>), and had numerous streaky scorers who Isiah expertly conducted to maximize the impact as different guys would get hot?</p>

<p><strong>Please don&rsquo;t downvote &ndash; tell me the plan/adjustment from opposing franchises.</strong></p>

      <label for="lokfspd" class="commentText"><p>Fair enough, but I was there, and coaches/GMS really didn&rsquo;t know what to do with them other than hope Isiah kept getting injured. Chicago was hoping/waiting to move forward once Detroit fell apart since they were older and Isiah had already been injured a few times, and Boston was always one Larry Bird ahead of everyone if his back held up (<em>the Celtics were the best team in the East in &lsquo;91 until Bird went into traction midseason right around the same time as Isiah&rsquo;s wrist surgery in January</em>).</p>

      <label for="lolduie" class="commentText"><p>The &lsquo;87 Lakers were better than the Pistons and Celtics; 13 games better than the Pistons in fact. Their top eight was incredible.<br>
The &lsquo;88 Pistons probably win the title with healthy Isiah in Game Six or Seven.<br>
The &lsquo;89 Pistons win the title in almost any scenario, but I will say based on what you&rsquo;re writing, it&rsquo;s fair to point out the Lakers were destroyed by injuries in the Finals.<br>
The &lsquo;90 Pistons probably win the title too, though most of those Finals games were close. You could make the case the Lakers were a better team than the Blazers (still probably get beat by Detroit) and the Spurs, who blew Game Seven against Portland, would have been a very interesting matchup as well.<br>
The &lsquo;91 Celtics were old and creaky despite their hot start, and Bird didn&rsquo;t have a great playoffs (they might have been screwed in Game Six vs. Detroit though). The &lsquo;91 Bulls absolutely crushed the Pistons in part because Pippen could carry the ball up court against a three-guard defense, and that screwed up Detroit&rsquo;s rotations. Jackson worked on Pippen all year to become <em>the man</em> in Jordan bench situations, and it paid off.</p>

<p>Could they have won five in a row? Sure, the same way the Bulls could have won eight in a row. I think when we look at a hypothetical extra title or two for a team, sometimes we forget that changes mentalities of those players as well. The &lsquo;88 Pistons were something like 13 and 5 seconds away from winning a championship. I&rsquo;d have to imagine that motivated them a whole whole lot in &lsquo;89, etc.</p>
