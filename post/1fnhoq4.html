      <label for="loifl68" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s insane how underrated Isiah is because of a bunch of Basketball Reference watchers looking at his stats. He was the 2nd best PG of that era and nobody ever questioned it.</p>

<p>The idea that people on r/nba have that Stockton is better than Isiah is beyond ridiculous and pure stat sheet watching.</p>

      <label for="loilfp6" class="commentText"><p>During his peak, Thomas raised his play considerably in the playoffs. He was also the primary option for an offensively-challenged team, which meant he faced double teams much more than Stockton, who played with Karl Malone. So Thomas’s three year peak playoff performance in 1988, 1989, and 1990 was better than any three year period of Stockton’s playoff performance.</p>

<p>But Thomas’s career was cut short by injuries, while Stockton’s career was extraordinarily long. At age 31 Thomas was significantly hobbled, and he played his last game at age 32.</p>

<p>Stockton, however, played at a high level through age 39, and played his last game at age 40. So Stockton’s cumulative career stats are far more impressive.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in 1991-92 there was no question that Stockton was playing better than Thomas. The only way Thomas could have made the 1992 Olympic Dream Team is if he had been grandfathered in based on past achievements like Larry Bird, whose play had also been diminished by injuries. But as good as Thomas was, he was never on the level of Larry Bird.</p>
