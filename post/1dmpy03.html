</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Since we are in NBA draft season, I would love some old heads to educate me and everyone on how a barely 6-foot combo guard became the #1 draft in one of history&rsquo;s most stacked NBA drafts.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t old enough to watch like that, but I never understood how this happened, especially given how dominant the big guys were in the league then, with Shaq, Keem, Robinson, Mourning, etc.</p>

<p>Honestly, even if he was a prospect in today&rsquo;s climate, I have a hard time believing any exec would want to draft an undersized combo guard, which is so crazy to me that he pulled it off in 1996.</p>

<p>Were his scoring and skillset so incomprehensible and unprecedented in basketball history that it was a sure thing they would translate over? That&rsquo;s all I can pinpoint about what made a player like Iverson the #1 prospect in 1996.</p>

<p>I would love to learn more about this! Thank you!</p>

      <label for="l9x6ykd" class="commentText"><p>His speed, quickness and handles were almost unprecedented at the time. His toughness was renowned, as well.</p>

<p>Keep in mind this was also before efficiency was valued like it is in today&rsquo;s NBA. Back then, teams simply wanted guys who could score, even if they were doing it off of crazy volume. Iverson could do that.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s gotten to a point today where Iverson has actually become underrated in some circles. People focus so much on him being an inefficient chucker (which is overstated given the era that he played in) that they tend to forget or gloss over some of the ridiculous things he did on the basketball court. Plus, if he were playing in the modern game, I have no doubt he would have learned to become more efficient.</p>

      <label for="l9x882u" class="commentText"><p>The games were lower scoring and slower paced, which actually helped Iverson because it allowed him to burn defenders in 1v1 halfcourt sets. He was virtually unguardable at his peak and teams would even have specialists (e.g. Tyronn Lue) to try and defend him. It wasn&rsquo;t quite like Shaq giving a lot of centers jobs in the NBA just to foul him, but it was a thing.</p>

<p>Like, peak Iverson genuinely struck fear into the hearts of his opponents, which is crazy to think about given the fact that he was 160 pounds soaking wet.</p>

      <label for="l9xfkhs" class="commentText"><p>Also the &ldquo;illegal defense&rdquo; was still a thing. So it was MUCH harder to build a wall. Had to either hard double (which AI had very little trouble splitting), or a sacrificial lamb on an island and hope to stop him at the rim.</p>

<p>Also his touch around the rim was uncanny. Only player I&rsquo;ve seen since with a finishing package like Allen is Kyrie. Both guys are so fluid and instinctual. They get in the lane, improvise and&hellip;.it just works.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should all feel fortunate that Allen Iverson wasn&rsquo;t 6&rsquo;5&rdquo;&ndash;Kobe</p>

<p>Game recognize game. Kobe talked a lot about what a problem AI was and how Allen&rsquo;s dominance in the early 2000s pushed him to be better.</p>

      <label for="l9xeuya" class="commentText"><p>Make no mistake. Iverson was not simply chucking shots. He could do it all, he could take it to the rack and finish around bigger players and he took a beating by doing so night in and night out. He got a lot of points at the free throw line. He was an offsnevice focal point because of how skilled he was, not because he sat outside and chucked 3s. He was also a shark on defense, attacking passing lanes and frequently leading the league in steals. People forget about his defense</p>

<p>It helps to know: Allen Iverson wasn’t seen as a combo guard at the time. He was viewed exclusively as a scoring point guard.</p>

<p>What turned out to be his major issue (defense) wasn’t viewed as a problem either. He was small but very athletic. He racked up so many steals that he even won conference Defensive Player of the Year. At the time, the concern about freelancing and hunting for steals wasn’t as prevalent.</p>

      <label for="l9x7num" class="commentText"><p>I got it, so that changes things a bit if they view him as a point guard. Kevin Johnson, Tim Hardaway, Isiah Thomas, etc., proved that small guards can work in that era, so seeing a crazy athlete like A.I. who can score was probably &ldquo;WOAH.&rdquo; The DPOY was a cherry on top, too, to feel more secure in the pick.</p>

      <label for="l9x8ewz" class="commentText"><p>Definitely a point guard. I think he probably would have gone # 1 for most teams but it also helped from a need perspective that the Sixers had decent forwards/bigs (Jerry Stackhouse, Derrick Coleman, Clarence Weatherspoon) and no real PG.</p>

<p>This was back a time when Cs and PFs were huge, so Camby being like 215-220 pounds soaking wet coming out of college was seen as a red flag. People actually had the same worries about KG back then, but obviously he was fine.</p>

One of them. Can’t ask for more out of a #1 Pick than a Top 5 Franchise Talent ever. He was a man amongst Boys and was dead Loyal. Almost a Tupac Figure in the NBA he was Drafted for his Celebrity as well as Performance. He just seemed so much older than his Peers. From the Docus’ and Videos I’ve seen on him. A real Classic Hero. And a Legend, bigger than the Sport. I doubt 6ers say yes to anyone else even in a ReDraft which is the idea. Maybe Kobe for sure. But that’s saying a lot.</p>

      <label for="l9xcnca" class="commentText"><p>Wow, I didn&rsquo;t know Kenny Anderson was drafted that high! Okay, it&rsquo;s making a lot more sense now.</p>

<p>One of my replies said he was viewed as a point guard prospect, not a two-guard, and drafting a smaller point guard high wasn&rsquo;t too out of the ordinary like you shared.</p>

<p>Add in the fact that this is the most athletic and quick point guard nobody had ever seen who can SCORE at a proven high-clip in the days when scoring was difficult, and then boom; there&rsquo;s your #1 pick.</p>
