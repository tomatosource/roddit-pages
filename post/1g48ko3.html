      <label for="ls27k8w" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t even know if it is a lack of instincts. He was the entirety of Purdue&rsquo;s gameplan, and he had to make up for a lot of general team deficiencies on defense, while staying in the game.</p>

<p>Of UConn&rsquo;s starting 5, only Alex Karaban didn&rsquo;t get drafted, and he was a projected lottery pick who decided to try to run it back again.</p>

<p>Purdue&rsquo;s only NBA talent was Zach Edey.</p>

<p>Just look at the National Championship Game. UConn&rsquo;s individual defenders were good enough to play man-to-man defense and hold Purdue&rsquo;s non-Edey 10+ minute players to: 4, 12, 0, 5, 2, 0, 0 points.</p>

<p>Clingan is a legitimately good defender, but it is way easier to put good tape up when you literally have NBA prospect level teammates at every position.</p>

The downside of Edey is that he picked up the basketball so late he is having to learn to play versus instinctive response from thousands of reps. It will be really interesting to watch his trajectory over the next few years.</p>

      <label for="ls2tlt2" class="commentText"><p>Eh, Edey is kind of slow, it&rsquo;s just not anywhere close to what people were making it out to be. Plus his length more than makes up for it.</p>

<p>Dude is going to have a solid NBA career if he stays healthy. Definition of &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t teach size&rdquo;. Also it kind of shows that the traditional big isn&rsquo;t completely dead, they just need to be at least 7&rsquo;2&rdquo;, move a little bit, and be an automatic bucket around the rim.</p>

<p>Honestly, if Edey can improve his playmaking, I kind of think his floor could be Portland Arvydas Sabonis (I&rsquo;m not saying Soviet Sabonis, I&rsquo;m talking about 2000s Sabonis), which would be a very solid NBA player.</p>

<p>Plus, if you pull your center out of the lane and the other center follows, you can maybe get a drive that has about a 60% chance of scoring with 14 seconds left on the shot clock. Everyone knows points scored by guards and small forwards are worth more.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s going to be an elite defender among centers, and he will definitely have some Rudy-in-the-playoffs type of moments against the Lukas and SGAs of the world. But he&rsquo;s not going to be a liability save for those very specific circumstances.</p>

      <label for="ls1tm7l" class="commentText"><p>Switches are a big thing but people just went 180º on this. As long as you have wings that can protect this C and play an aggressive defense as well, you will negate a lot of the perimeter loss while making infiltrations and drives almost prohibitive. If teams go small to explore the perimeter, you just need to feed Edey down low and punish the smaller side.</p>

<p>Lively isn’t exactly a stretch 5 (even being faster than Edey) and the fact went to the Finals playing drop while fielding two defensive weaknesses in Luka and Kyrie. Having an all-switch party like the Celtics is the exception, not the norm and every team in the league will be exploited by the Celtics.</p>

<p>I assume Edey can score if he catches the ball further out than that though. IIRC he was even practicing his threes.</p>

<p>And not to say I&rsquo;m saying Edey is exactly the same as Curry, just to say the concerns kind of can make sense. We&rsquo;ll see when he has to defend 1-5, 2-5 pick and rolls against starters going 100%, too.</p>

<p>But 20 years ago, Jokic would’ve been getting well over 10 post-up possessions per game</p>

<p>Jokic and Embiid were both at 1.14 points per possession on post-ups last year - that level of efficiency, and being the hub of your team, is what’s needed in 2024 for you to get &amp;gt;5 post possession per game</p>

      <label for="ls1x5dz" class="commentText"><p>There are really 3 requirements to get 5+ post-up possession per game in the modern NBA</p>

<ol>
<li><p>be very efficient</p></li>

<li><p>be the heliocentric hub of your offense</p></li>

<li><p>be an above average passer</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Porzingis meets requirement 1 easily. He is the most efficient of all players with more than 1 possession per game at 1.30ppp.</p>

<p>But he fails 2 by a lot, and can’t really fulfill 3 that well - so he only gets about 3 possessions per game</p>

<p>And that’s for the most efficient guy in the league at them</p>

<p>So do I believe it’s reasonable to think Edey can meet requirement 1 - yeah I do.</p>

<p>Do I think we have evidence that he can fulfil requirement 2 or 3, no.</p>

<p>So do I think it’s likely they’re giving a - in your example - 1.05ppp center 5 post up possessions per game or more… no I think that’s very unlikely</p>

<p>1.05ppp is hard by the way - of the 12 players with more than 3 possessions per game, only 4 (Jokic, Embiid, Davis and Porzingis) surpassed 1.05ppp, and Davis was only just above that at 1.06ppp</p>

<p>So you can’t just assume he can give you 1.05ppp</p>

      <label for="ls1uk1v" class="commentText"><p>I somewhat agree but also disagree when you say &ldquo;running your offense through a rookie&rdquo; as Edey isn&rsquo;t your typical rookie. He played 4 years with the last 2 being extremely dominant and should be seen as more polished than anyone else you could draft. Do I think they should run 6 possessions a game thru him like the other dude suggested? Yeah ofc not that&rsquo;s glazing, but he shouldn&rsquo;t be seen as your typical rookie.</p>

<p>And the Yao comparisons are fucking crazy too. I see him as likely a above average starter that can get you some buckets but you don&rsquo;t want to run your offense thru him but a couple possessions would be good against smaller lineups and bench lineups.</p>

Just because the &ldquo;meta&rdquo; in basketball is outside-in play does not mean that all teams should do this.  Mirror metas &ndash; whether it&rsquo;s sports, video games, war, etc. &ndash; just lead to mismatches and specifically underdogs attempting Herculean efforts to beat stronger opponents.</p>

<p>The Grizzlies were pretty close to an NBA Title playing Grit and Grind for several years.  With that roster as constructed, Memphis would not have been a playoff team had they went all in as an outside shooting team.</p>

<p>Similarly, people wonder why guys like DeAndre Ayton &ldquo;underperform.&rdquo;  Meanwhile, he performs hyper-efficiently and at an elite level; the issue is Portland lets smalls chuck inefficient shots rather than their highly-efficient big shoot 20+ times a game.</p>

      <label for="ls1u10y" class="commentText"><p>I mean someone always breaks the mold. I don’t know if Edey is that guy but if the effectiveness is there then Memphis should look for him.</p>

<p>I don’t think he needs full possessions to be effective, just touches. If you can get him the ball, the defense often collapses around him and he can kick out and the ball gets swung around to the open man.</p>

<p>As recently as 2020-21 Embiid had 12 post ups per game, Vuc had 11, Joker and AD had 9. I could see Edey getting 6-8 post ups even if it’s just to abuse opposing bench players.</p>

<p>Porzingis for example fits the first requirement better than anyone else with &amp;gt;1 possession per game - at 1.30ppp he led the league amongst that group.</p>

<p>Can I believe it’s likely Edey meets requirement 1 - sure. Do I think we have any evidence to believe he’ll meet 2 or 3… no</p>

His only question mark and why I doubted him was because of how well he could move compared to NBA players and he has already proven that he has a Yao Ming-like quality to him where he is slow moving up and down the court but has super quick feet and is very agile in the post.  I’m confident he can learn the rest from good coaching.</p>

<p>It’s almost unbelievable how well Edey carries his size.</p>

<p>He has the tree trunk legs like Yao too but even has that big upper body already you don’t often see from enormously tall guys, at least when they’re younger. He’s almost like a much more athletic Mark Eaton just as far as size and movement.</p>

<p>You can make up for a pretty sizable speed deficit by being more efficient, and not having wasted motion.</p>

Of the last 10 POTY winners, you have 3 0-time all stars not even on a team right now, Garza and Tshiebwe who averaged 5 MPG last year in few games, 2 role players with no all stars, the unknown Edey, and then Zion and Brunson.</p>

Thats definitely not a good a rate as the first overall picks but it’s the exact same as the second overall picks this century.</p>

<p>There clearly is a correlation to the best college players also being good NBA players because in a given draft maybe 3 guys on average will make an all star game which is a much lower rate than POTY</p>

<p>Which makes sense. If a player is good enough to win the award as a freshman or sophomore, they’re clearly super talented and are likely a very high draft pick. In the past 25 years, an underclassman has won the award 8 times (I’m not including Obi Toppin who was technically a sophomore but was like 22). Five went number 1 overall (Brand, Bogut, Blake Griffin, AD, Zion). One more went 2nd (KD). The other two were top 10 picks (TJ ford at 8, and Trey Burke at 9) but weren’t as successful in part because of size (both were 6’0”).</p>

<p>Edey put 37 &amp; 10 on him in the championship game.</p>

<p>Dude averaged 25 &amp; 10 his final two years of college, and measured bigger &amp; faster than Gobert. He&rsquo;s awesome, and it&rsquo;s weird people are only just now getting it.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m sure once the regular season hits he will face tougher competition and struggle some.. but I&rsquo;ve also thought that about Edey multiple times.</p>

At Purdue sitting year one, getting minutes year 2 and becoming POY years 3&amp;4. He puts in work, very coachable and is improving at an unmatched rate. This doesn&rsquo;t get enough coverage.</p>

      <label for="ls3bmjg" class="commentText"><p>This.  Both coaches put the outcome of the entire game on that matchup, and it almost worked for Purdue.  Clingan slowed him enough that UConn never had to change its defense - a change that would have given our guards the freedom to score and make the game competitive.  But damn did he come close.  Absolutely abused Clingan.  To Clingan&rsquo;s credit, he got the job done.  The job being &ldquo;hold Edey to 37, not 47&rdquo;.  Bent but didn&rsquo;t break.</p>

<p>Always irked me after when people said the game wasn&rsquo;t competitive.  Literally both coaches said verbatim this was the strategy.  Edey was Lake Mead and Clingan Hoover dam.  If the damn broke, the final score looks VERY different.  37 and 10 is about as close as you get to breaking it, and he had several looks in the first half that just didn&rsquo;t go in that might have made the difference.  Football is a game of inches, basketball a game of matchups and that was a thinner margin that the final score showed.</p>

I don’t think he’ll ever be an all star but at the least he’ll have a long NBA career as a bench player imo (7+ seasons)</p>

<p>A very likely scenario is that Edey becomes a really effective regular season grinder who can help starters / other guys rest by making it very repeatable to get reasonable EFG and low TO (TBD on this, but it is easy to overlook and can be huge) possessions.</p>

      <label for="ls25dzt" class="commentText"><p>The &lsquo;post touches&rsquo; thing was always overstated because people ignored what a dominant P&amp;R big he projected to. Crushing original screens, good understanding of rescreens and dribble hand-offs, adequate speed to the basket, can&rsquo;t get knocked off his line easily, takes up huge space and knows how to use this to create driving paths for his guard, huge high passing window, soft catching hands, soft touch around the basket, excellent offensive rebounder, especially in scramble-situations like a P&amp;R drive where you can&rsquo;t put a box-out on him early.</p>

<p>I think Ivey&rsquo;s draft tape showed some of this more than Edey&rsquo;s&hellip; You watch Edey&rsquo;s highlights and you mostly see those post-ups, because he&rsquo;s so dominant at them. But go back a year and watch Ivey&rsquo;s, and you see Edey doing such smart things on the P&amp;R, especially using his size to create driving lanes.</p>

      <label for="ls37hcn" class="commentText"><p>Even then I do think he’ll get relatively more post touches than we tend to usually see. He’s so brutally strong, that’s what stands out to me more than almost anything. He isn’t just a typical big body out there, he’s basically a stone in the block.</p>

<p>His screens are and will be nightmarish but his post-up is so grand to me as anachronistic as it is these days because there’s just no moving him and his baby hook is butter. He has terrific touch. If he gets any sort of deep position you’re absolutely fucked, and it seems very difficult to keep him from doing that.</p>

<p>They’re going to end up eventually having to bring help as Edey gets better and if he can find gaps in the defense to get the ball to the open man especially on a cut - something Shaq did incredibly well that and that he’s very underrated at - it seems all but a wrap to me. He’s like a Boban who can stay on the court for 30+ minutes.</p>

<p>The best post-up players in the game get fewer possessions running it than run of the mill big men got a decade ago - you have to be able to do other things to be even a decently productive contributor on the offensive end as a big man</p>

<p>Not really, guys got too good at shooting.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll need rule changes, not a single player to kill small ball. The thing about small ball isn&rsquo;t really that the players are smaller, it&rsquo;s that they&rsquo;re more mobile and better at basketball. You used to have to give up significant size for that, but the tradeoff isn&rsquo;t as costly as it used to be.</p>

<p>The counter to him will be what it is for every giant man. Drag them out on the perimeter and make them run around a lot. If he can survive that then he&rsquo;s just goated. Going big into him is only going to make his life easier.</p>

<p>Lots of these guys can play but there is more of a what if regarding a lot of them.</p>

<p>Not shocked that most players were selected based off of fit than anything.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d argue Charlotte would have been the first team he could have been selected by. They have problems with Williams staying healthy and he could have been a great fallback guy.
Bridges and Miller already existed so Salaun being picked is questionable at best.</p>

<p>But I for one am shocked the Spurs didn&rsquo;t draft him at all and instead traded dillingham to Minnesota for whatever reason.</p>

      <label for="ls26ejh" class="commentText"><p>I love the guy. Call it now. 8-time+ all-star easy. I think he will immediately be able to come in and score on 75% of NBA starting centers. Defensively, the Grizzlies have some guys to cover him. He’s a good passer out of the post, so he’s nearly impossible to double. He’s going to be great. Bookmark this comment for the future all. I’m glazing this man like a donut. No way he flares out.</p>

<p>Everyone can get played off the court in moments, but 95% of the time he will be great. Doesn’t foul. Elite conditioning. He’ll play in drop like Joker or Gobert. He’ll be fine.</p>

      <label for="ls2ebxj" class="commentText"><p>I have said it way before the draft that Edey was my #1 pick if i could draft. I have proof in many discussions on this board or nba draft but I&rsquo;m 100% convinced guy will be a star in this league.</p>

<p>All that I have seen and his motor and effort makes me believe he has superstar potential and talent to boot.</p>

<p>I was truly disappointed when he didnt fall to Orlando and when Orlando didnt trade up to get him (which I was calling for before the draft). But i felt pretty vindicated when he started to shoot righr before the draft in discussions and boards. Alot of teams messed up imo.</p>

      <label for="ls2qks1" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s some complete surprise that he&rsquo;s the most NBA-ready player from this draft, and consequently will be one of the best rookies.  The real question is, three years from now, will he be in lockstep with the picks that were getting NBA reps when he was still bullying college kids</p>

      <label for="ls47ec1" class="commentText"><p>Carlisle is correct 100%.  As someone who barely watches NCAA basketball, you can tell when a player is NBA ready and Edey always looked ready for me.  I think people judged him because of his look, but his game was always solid and the guy is 7&rsquo;4.</p>

<p>Come on now.  How can a 7&rsquo;4 guy be that polished and people still judge his abilities.  SMFH! Edey is a solid pick for any team.</p>

<p>Lucky that I was able to see him all through college. He beat everyone’s predictions and barriers. Every single one. He improved his game every single year.</p>

<p>I couldn’t believe my ears hearing people say he wasn’t draft worthy or high first round worthy.</p>

<p>Steal of the draft.</p>
