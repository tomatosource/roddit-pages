He&rsquo;s not a good defender. When Doncic has a guy in front of him that tries to go around he&rsquo;s either getting beat or trying to reach around like you did in high school. Put him in as many actions as you can</p>

<p>Simmons also noted it was so noticable in person how often anyone was blowing by him and how all he tried was matador defense.</p>

<p>Luka looks like he couldn’t care less about playing defense 80% of the time. It’s just noticeable laziness</p>

      <label for="l8dl1oh" class="commentText"><p>Yup. Luka literally looks like a paper towel on most defensive plays and when he actually tries, he just becomes an amatuerish foul machine.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s a star and he&rsquo;s someone who has a bright future. But this should be a humbling experience for him because he&rsquo;s basically having his weaknesses put on blast on the biggest stage right now.</p>

He just made his 5th All-NBA First Team, he&rsquo;s a top 5 player that many consider the second best player in the league. He has a bright future, sure, but that phrase is usually reserved for people that are ascending towards superstardom</p>

      <label for="l8dlgyv" class="commentText"><p>The problem with Luka is he might be a worse off-ball defender than he is on-ball. He consistently doesn’t get back on D, doesn’t rotate/help when necessary, falls asleep and allows open cuts/threes. He seems to hurt them defensively and consistently give up buckets even when they try to hide him off-ball.</p>

<p>Guys like Nash and Steph at least put in effort and could play solid/smart team defense off-ball when you were able to hide them.</p>

<p>Celtics have scored 107, 105, and 106</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re just putting him in action and killing dropping 120 a game</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s pretty similar to Cavs/Warriors 2016</p>

<p>yeah the cavs put Steph into actions, but all that resulted in was a 89-93 game</p>

<p>this series has just been about Mavs role players not being able to contribute at a consistent level offensively</p>

Luka is giving up layups and open corner 3s because he’s either not trying or doesn’t know what he’s doing off ball. That’s before your point of hunting him. Even at Jokic’s worst which imo was Utah games 2-3-4 in 2021, I never thought it was exclusively his fault that those points were being scored.</p>

      <label for="l8dskaf" class="commentText"><p>Yes but I think in Jokic’s case, because he’s a center and hunted on ball, there is at least a chance for his teammates to protect him against bad matchups/mistakes like KCP screen navigation or AG stepping up in short roll. Lukas mistake off ball are killer because Lively and Gaff cannot watch their man, the ball, and Lukas man in a possession. Luka giving up an off ball cut to the rim doesn’t give Lively a chance to save the play because it’s not his job to make sure Jaylen Brown isn’t cutting. When you’re getting cooked off ball you don’t give your teammate a chance to bail you out. Also the threshold of Luka and Jokic playing defense is so low that it’s embarrassing for Luka to be this bad. You don’t need to be Scottie Pippen man. Just don’t be a the sole reason you hemorrhaged points</p>

      <label for="l8e2n72" class="commentText"><p>Tbf, I t gets harder to hunt him if he hides at dunker spot next to the center under the rim. That is a crowded paint already. You either draw center out by shooters or need more than one handler helping the ball moving around and get in even to hunt. We got both the multiple ball handlers and the shooters, they don&rsquo;t. Today Dallas tried that again, kept their center under the rim and hide Luka to dunkers spot, leaving one shooter in the corner open. With those DWhite misses it seemed like working, we couldn&rsquo;t hunt him for a while, it didn&rsquo;t take long though. They could do that all game long against Wolves.</p>

      <label for="l8e83oj" class="commentText"><p>I think you&rsquo;re right. Idk that could be it. Tbh it felt a lot like Smart used to do on the Celtics. He&rsquo;d have a call that he exaggerated the contact on because it wasn&rsquo;t obvious, and the refs wouldn&rsquo;t call it. Then, he would continue to over do the flopping in an attempt to make them call it. But maybe it was a give me the same type of call beat.</p>

Rockets weren’t anywhere close to GSW in terms of talent in those days. Like Harden was legit carrying them in 2015. He did get better tho and while he’s never been necessarily good, he wasn’t abysmal defensively for his entire prime.</p>

      <label for="l8dz7t7" class="commentText"><p>He’s hurt and the entire offense.</p>

<p>He’s never going to be a great defender. He just doesn’t have the lateral quickness to be one. But with the amount of energy he has to expend on offense it’s really hard to stay locked in on defense. That’s evident in the fact that he’s worse off ball than on ball. He just isn’t locked in on that end because if he played both ways locked in, through injury, while being the entire offense dealing wth brown Tatum white and holiday he’d be on oxygen by half time.</p>

<p>Blaming his conditioning is sorta fair but so few players in the NBA have the conditioning to do that on both ends for the 45 minutes he had to play to win</p>

      <label for="l8dkm21" class="commentText"><p>Can confirm this, which is fucking laughable honestly. We got sent home by them so things were going the other way and I was getting downvoted for pointing out he was a terrible defender.</p>

<p>I mean, I can accept anything up to calling him a mediocre defender, but the amount of people saying he was good caught me off guard.</p>

<p>If he&rsquo;s a good defender then this league would be cooked and the scorelines would be All Star Games week in and week out.</p>

He’s getting paid millions of dollars to a play a game - and part of that job is to be in good physical condition. Plenty of great scorers were also good defenders. He doesnt even need to be “good” on defense, just be average.</p>

<p>Imagine being a teammate of his and giving your all on defense and then seeing his effort.</p>

      <label for="l8dn0nb" class="commentText"><p>Also he has Kyrie Irving, why does Luka need to initiate the offense and dribble for half the shot clock every single possession? Elite 2-way players are typically able to find opportunities to rest on offense by being effective players off-ball offensively and using their off-ball shooting/scoring ability to open up teammates without needing to use tons of energy handling the ball.</p>

<p>If Luka had any off-ball offensive skills he would be able to play off Kyrie more and wouldn’t have to always use so much energy to score.</p>

<p>I have faith that Luka will get a wake up call and realize that he needs to cede some offensive output to get some effort in on defense. All the great players make that realization at some point. If he doesn’t though, every time he’s matched up with an elite team (which is going to be the case if they keep getting deep finals runs) will make sure to take advantage of his terrible defense.</p>

Part of it is that he’s injured. But it seems to me part of it is that he is frustrated. His shot selection the last 2 games hasn’t been great, he was taking and front rimming a bunch of shots tonight he normally makes, and his defense is getting exposed more and more. I didnt watch tonight’s, but his body language in the last 2 post game pressers hasn’t been great. His quotes before the finals had a lot of confidence, and to me, it looks like that is slipping. Slipping confidence leads to more mistakes</p>

<p>But even when he&rsquo;s healthy, he&rsquo;s pretty trash on defense. It&rsquo;s effort.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;s getting blown by, or gambling for steals &hellip;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s that he doesn&rsquo;t rotate and help the helpers behind him. Mavs help D has actually been quite good adjusting for Luka&rsquo;s ineptitude. They were effective vs Clippers, Thunder and Wolves because they could lay off of non-shooters in the lineups like Giddey and Gobert.</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t do that vs a Celtics team that runs 5 shooters most of the time.</p>

They legitimately would have been better off getting a guy who was 80% the offensive player he was and actually a competent defensive player because the amount of fouls and points he&rsquo;s causing is more of a negative right now. Yeah he&rsquo;s putting up numbers, but he&rsquo;s the obvious weak link the Celtics offense wants to attack and when they get hot, he&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s going from a good run, to &ldquo;oh shit I just blinked and the Celtics are up 20&rdquo;.</p>

      <label for="l8dkujb" class="commentText"><p>Mannix said in this pod he doesn&rsquo;t see any improvement at all from Luka&rsquo;s defense since he came in the league. That is just objectively not true. He was bad this series but he has improved overall quite a bit compared to last year. He was &ldquo;good for Luka&rdquo; in the previous series of these playoffs. He made a meaningful impact in several of the games in the 4th quarter.</p>

<p>I just can&rsquo;t take someone&rsquo;s basketball criticism serious when you can tell they either just dislike the player or are talking out their ass based on the last few games they watched.</p>

<p>Mavs role players and bench contribution was almost non-existent to a point where it was embarrassing.</p>

<p>Kyrie completely sucked in game 1 and 2. If he had just played 20% better, we would have gotten at least 1 road game and it would have been a completely different series.</p>

<p>Only thing which should really bother all Mavs fans in regards to Lukas is his inability to get and stay in shape.</p>

His offense clearly outweighs not being there on defense when boston is the only team that can attack with 5 and expose any bad defender out there.</p>

<p>Hes not good at defense but thats not the reason they are losing this series, Boston is not punishing him for it either.</p>

      <label for="l8dp4cj" class="commentText"><p>Watch his off-ball defense and you’ll see why people are criticizing. He has consistently failed to rotate/help, consistently fallen asleep and allowed open cuts/threes, consistently failed to get back on D, etc.</p>

<p>Yes, he’s not constantly getting abused one on one, but his poor off-ball defense and rotations has allowed tons of wide open shots and layups/dunks. Some at important/pivotal moments in the game. The last two games have been very close in the 4th quarter, so every bucket matters. And a single stop can end a Celtics scoring run, just like a single bucket can lead to a huge run.</p>

<p>Sure, the Celtics aren’t scoring 150, but that’s not because the Mavs are playing amazing team defense. Luka has been slowing the pace of the game down a ton offensively, and the Celtics (a great 3 pt shooting team) have just struggled shooting at times and have been missing a ton of wide open threes.</p>

Have him sink and another defender close out even if theyre late its a better option.  Luka cant be hidden well here regardless.   Luka is the most consistent player in this series by far and his offense will always outweigh his defense regardless.  No guard is giving up 45 on their own</p>
