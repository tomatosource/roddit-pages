      <label for="l8gegv2" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s the combination of foot-speed and intelligence and chest strength that&rsquo;s kinda rare and make him perfectly equipped for Embiid. Siakam and Haliburton just outspeed him and will out-cardio him too. But Luka is kind of a chest strength check that a lot of great perimeter players fail and Horford is really well-equipped for.</p>

<p>If you catch a night where Horford only has to play 25 minutes and he&rsquo;s really engaged, I&rsquo;ve seen it be doom for even someone like DeAaron Fox in 2022.</p>

And like, I’m not saying I’m fine with the mavericks being stomped. But, this is a fantastic team and I don’t think there’s much shame in being beat by THIS TEAM. Like, people are talking shit about PJ and Kidd etc. we’re in the finals. There’s not a ton we need to improve on. It’s just, the Celtics are absolutely outstanding</p>

      <label for="l8e2n72" class="commentText"><p>Tbf, I t gets harder to hunt him if he hides at dunker spot next to the center under the rim. That is a crowded paint already. You either draw center out by shooters or need more than one handler helping the ball moving around and get in even to hunt. We got both the multiple ball handlers and the shooters, they don&rsquo;t. Today Dallas tried that again, kept their center under the rim and hide Luka to dunkers spot, leaving one shooter in the corner open. With those DWhite misses it seemed like working, we couldn&rsquo;t hunt him for a while, it didn&rsquo;t take long though. They could do that all game long against Wolves.</p>

<p>Obviously their roster is ideal for attacking weak perimeter defenders, but lessons can be learned regardless.</p>

<p>It’s not like those other teams the Mavs faced didn’t try to involve Luka in defensive actions</p>

<p>I mean&hellip; they did, but they absolutely could&rsquo;ve done it much more.  The Wolves offense against the Mavs especially could&rsquo;ve used a lot of adjustment.</p>

He consistently doesn’t get back on D, doesn’t rotate/help when necessary, falls asleep and allows open cuts/threes. He seems to hurt them defensively and consistently give up buckets even when they try to hide him off-ball.</p>

<p>Guys like Nash and Steph at least put in effort and could play solid/smart team defense off-ball when you were able to hide them.</p>

Even Steph became a decent defender and he doesn&rsquo;t have the size and strength Luka has.</p>

<p>Celtics have scored 107, 105, and 106</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re just putting him in action and killing dropping 120 a game</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s pretty similar to Cavs/Warriors 2016</p>

<p>yeah the cavs put Steph into actions, but all that resulted in was a 89-93 game</p>

      <label for="l8dk85g" class="commentText"><p>Alright, that&rsquo;s an overreaction. We&rsquo;ve definitely seen teams go at Jokic and Curry like this. Nash played in an era where they didn&rsquo;t hunt mismatches as much.</p>

<p>Luka should be playing more like Harden where he&rsquo;s poor defensively but teams don&rsquo;t attack him every play cause he can be alright if he wants to be. But he&rsquo;s completely given up on that this series.</p>

<p>Not Harden. Not Nash. Not Isaiah fucking Thomas lol.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also never seen a player give less of a fuck on defense in the <em>NBA Finals</em>. He straight up just doesn&rsquo;t rotate. He stands there.</p>

      <label for="l8dks76" class="commentText"><p>I’m not even talking about mismatching hunting. Luka is giving up layups and open corner 3s because he’s either not trying or doesn’t know what he’s doing off ball. That’s before your point of hunting him. Even at Jokic’s worst which imo was Utah games 2-3-4 in 2021, I never thought it was exclusively his fault that those points were being scored.</p>

<p>I bet if curry and jokic never won they would have the same narrative.
Also find it funny that everyone seems to make the blame on luka for everything when hes been there best player. And probably the best player in the finals while injured</p>

Rockets weren’t anywhere close to GSW in terms of talent in those days. Like Harden was legit carrying them in 2015. He did get better tho and while he’s never been necessarily good, he wasn’t abysmal defensively for his entire prime.</p>

If 95% of players just tried their hardest they could be serviceable. There have been players with similar frames that were worlds better on defense than Luka. This is on him.</p>

<p>I don’t think Trae can be a good defender even with a lot of effort. Dude is just too small to defend well against NBA players.</p>

<p>But Luka has size, so I suspect “not sucking” is a viable goal for him.</p>

<p>On a positive note, maybe he’ll realize he has to get in shape and play defense… right?? I mean he has to… right??</p>

      <label for="l8dz7t7" class="commentText"><p>He’s hurt and the entire offense.</p>

<p>He’s never going to be a great defender. He just doesn’t have the lateral quickness to be one. But with the amount of energy he has to expend on offense it’s really hard to stay locked in on defense. That’s evident in the fact that he’s worse off ball than on ball. He just isn’t locked in on that end because if he played both ways locked in, through injury, while being the entire offense dealing wth brown Tatum white and holiday he’d be on oxygen by half time.</p>

<p>Blaming his conditioning is sorta fair but so few players in the NBA have the conditioning to do that on both ends for the 45 minutes he had to play to win</p>

<p>It’s insane how people are bringing up this topic. “He has to spend much more energy on offense” is not a defensible position. They’re in the finals. His physical conditioning is the easiest thing to fix.</p>

<p>Bonus would be that he would be less injury prone if he was fitter.</p>

He was at the very least not a net negative through the rest of the playoffs and seemed to be trying for large portions of those games but this series I don&rsquo;t even know what to think. He treats every dribble drive like he&rsquo;s got Dwight Howard waiting in the paint not a rookie Lively and Gafford. Hope he skips the Olympics to work on his game. Enjoy Cancun Luka. Your game is awesome when it works but you gotta be better if you&rsquo;re gonna win it all. Was a fun playoff run and the team all learned a lot and if Dallas can retain the pieces next season should be a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Except Lively and Gafford aren&rsquo;t even at the rim.  They are stuck stood in the corner next to Al/KP.  The &ldquo;rim protection&rdquo; is DJJ and THJ and Josh Green.</p>

<p>Because the celtics don&rsquo;t just hunt mismatches on the ball for an iso chance.  They also set up mismatches off the ball, and send that player to the dunker&rsquo;s spot while Al/KP bring their big out to the perimeter.  Except because it&rsquo;s a mismatch down low it let&rsquo;s the C&rsquo;s do something unique and put the dunker&rsquo;s spot on strong side instead of weak, which makes the drop pass easier, the outlet pass easier, and the contested rebound easier.  Because JT and JB are not worried about THJ &ldquo;helping&rdquo; at the rim.</p>

He’s getting paid millions of dollars to a play a game - and part of that job is to be in good physical condition. Plenty of great scorers were also good defenders. He doesnt even need to be “good” on defense, just be average.</p>

<p>Imagine being a teammate of his and giving your all on defense and then seeing his effort.</p>

      <label for="l8dn0nb" class="commentText"><p>Also he has Kyrie Irving, why does Luka need to initiate the offense and dribble for half the shot clock every single possession? Elite 2-way players are typically able to find opportunities to rest on offense by being effective players off-ball offensively and using their off-ball shooting/scoring ability to open up teammates without needing to use tons of energy handling the ball.</p>

<p>If Luka had any off-ball offensive skills he would be able to play off Kyrie more and wouldn’t have to always use so much energy to score.</p>

His closest comparison is James Harden and Harden eventually become a solid defender in the playoffs so hopefully Luka does the same. Take the regular season off from D and step it up in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="l8dknao" class="commentText"><p>People have said this before - it’s okay to not be a good defender, but if you don’t even rotate you’re just playing 4-5 in the worst possible way.</p>

<p>I have faith that Luka will get a wake up call and realize that he needs to cede some offensive output to get some effort in on defense. All the great players make that realization at some point. If he doesn’t though, every time he’s matched up with an elite team (which is going to be the case if they keep getting deep finals runs) will make sure to take advantage of his terrible defense.</p>

      <label for="l8dkujb" class="commentText"><p>Mannix said in this pod he doesn&rsquo;t see any improvement at all from Luka&rsquo;s defense since he came in the league. That is just objectively not true. He was bad this series but he has improved overall quite a bit compared to last year. He was &ldquo;good for Luka&rdquo; in the previous series of these playoffs. He made a meaningful impact in several of the games in the 4th quarter.</p>

<p>I just can&rsquo;t take someone&rsquo;s basketball criticism serious when you can tell they either just dislike the player or are talking out their ass based on the last few games they watched.</p>

      <label for="l8dlzox" class="commentText"><p>People don’t say the lights are brighter in the finals  just because. Experience matters, he’s looked worse and worse every game. Part of it is that he’s injured. But it seems to me part of it is that he is frustrated. His shot selection the last 2 games hasn’t been great, he was taking and front rimming a bunch of shots tonight he normally makes, and his defense is getting exposed more and more. I didnt watch tonight’s, but his body language in the last 2 post game pressers hasn’t been great. His quotes before the finals had a lot of confidence, and to me, it looks like that is slipping. Slipping confidence leads to more mistakes</p>

<p>But even when he&rsquo;s healthy, he&rsquo;s pretty trash on defense. It&rsquo;s effort.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;s getting blown by, or gambling for steals &hellip;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s that he doesn&rsquo;t rotate and help the helpers behind him. Mavs help D has actually been quite good adjusting for Luka&rsquo;s ineptitude. They were effective vs Clippers, Thunder and Wolves because they could lay off of non-shooters in the lineups like Giddey and Gobert.</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t do that vs a Celtics team that runs 5 shooters most of the time.</p>

<p>Kyrie completely sucked in game 1 and 2. If he had just played 20% better, we would have gotten at least 1 road game and it would have been a completely different series.</p>
