      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ecimej/si_tatum_after_the_22_finals_was_the_first_time/"><p>[SI] Tatum: “[After the &lsquo;22 finals] was the first time where I thought, I don’t know, maybe I’m not one of the guys that can be the best player on the championship team. Because it was so hard to get to the Finals. And we still didn’t win. Getting there, that was the hardest thing I ever had to do.&rdquo;</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>From his <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/the-celtics-define-greatness-in-any-era" target="_blank">sports illustrated interview</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>As familiar as Tatum became with Celtics greats, he never felt like one of them. Statistically, Tatum is on a path to be one of the most prolific. Maybe the most. At 26, he’s already in the franchise’s top 20 in scoring, rebounds and assists. Only Bird and Pierce have racked up more points in their first 500 games.</p>

<p>But success in Boston isn’t based on numbers. It’s about banners. And as the failures piled up—three conference-final losses and a six-game flop to the Golden State Warriors in the 2022 Finals in Tatum’s first six seasons—doubt slowly crept in. In the weeks after the loss to the Warriors, Tatum admitted to a full-blown crisis of confidence.</p>

<p>“That was the first time where I thought, I don’t know, maybe I’m not one of the guys that can be the best player on the championship team,” Tatum says. “Because it was so hard to get to the Finals. And we still didn’t win. Getting there, that was the hardest thing I ever had to do. I was drained. That summer I had moments thinking that maybe you have to be a legend to win a championship. And there were moments where I wondered if I was going to be that guy, just because of how hard it is.”</p>

      <label for="lf07lh1" class="commentText"><p>To be fair he’s had far better playoff runs and didn’t win the title then. Think it showed to him this year how important it is to have a stacked cast of other stars if you aren’t quite on the legend / superstar level.</p>

      <label for="lf083ck" class="commentText"><p>I never understood the narrative around Boston and not winning a title before this year. Some people saying they needed to split the Jays up because they hadn’t been able to win one. They were (and still are) at relatively young ages to win a title that it always seemed inevitable to me that they would win if they were left together. </p>

      <label for="lf0a84t" class="commentText"><p>Only because we&rsquo;d all be clowning the JB reaction. Its not really controversial to say JT is the best player and the main reason pretty much everything about the team works. JT does everything for that team he&rsquo;s basically a superstar level glue guy lol which sounds weird to say but basically he plays all over the court doing anything they need to do to win and does it at a high level. Everyone else out there is meant to play in their lane and do what they do best but they expect him to do everything best</p>
