      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ecimej/si_tatum_after_the_22_finals_was_the_first_time/"><p>[SI] Tatum: “[After the &lsquo;22 finals] was the first time where I thought, I don’t know, maybe I’m not one of the guys that can be the best player on the championship team. Because it was so hard to get to the Finals. And we still didn’t win. Getting there, that was the hardest thing I ever had to do.&rdquo;</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>From his <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/the-celtics-define-greatness-in-any-era" target="_blank">sports illustrated interview</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>As familiar as Tatum became with Celtics greats, he never felt like one of them. Statistically, Tatum is on a path to be one of the most prolific. Maybe the most. At 26, he’s already in the franchise’s top 20 in scoring, rebounds and assists. Only Bird and Pierce have racked up more points in their first 500 games.</p>

<p>But success in Boston isn’t based on numbers. It’s about banners. And as the failures piled up—three conference-final losses and a six-game flop to the Golden State Warriors in the 2022 Finals in Tatum’s first six seasons—doubt slowly crept in. In the weeks after the loss to the Warriors, Tatum admitted to a full-blown crisis of confidence.</p>

<p>“That was the first time where I thought, I don’t know, maybe I’m not one of the guys that can be the best player on the championship team,” Tatum says. “Because it was so hard to get to the Finals. And we still didn’t win. Getting there, that was the hardest thing I ever had to do. I was drained. That summer I had moments thinking that maybe you have to be a legend to win a championship. And there were moments where I wondered if I was going to be that guy, just because of how hard it is.”</p>

Its not really controversial to say JT is the best player and the main reason pretty much everything about the team works. JT does everything for that team he&rsquo;s basically a superstar level glue guy lol which sounds weird to say but basically he plays all over the court doing anything they need to do to win and does it at a high level. Everyone else out there is meant to play in their lane and do what they do best but they expect him to do everything best</p>

<p>I think it’s more evidence that you’re a casual fan rather than anything you said being true. Using a 5 game stretch to say he’s not the first option is objectively dumb, especially when he still led the team in every stat in that stretch.</p>

I&rsquo;ll cut you some slack and assume you probably don&rsquo;t watch a ton of basketball and when you do you probably don&rsquo;t watch a ton of celtics games, so you probably have a more limited idea/way to guage the players on the team. I will tell you though that there are plenty of vocal critics of Tatum, it&rsquo;s definitely not illegitimate or baseless. But even the most critical of them would scoff at someone suggesting that he&rsquo;s the 2nd worst starter&hellip;</p>

      <label for="lf0ws7n" class="commentText"><p>I think Tatum/Brown and their consistent run of success up through 2022 and obviously now, that they have a chip, really isn&rsquo;t appreciated enough for how impressive and actually how historic it really is. The fact they&rsquo;ve <em>always been there</em>, always been in the convo, putting themselves within grasp, since they were teenagers/early 20s, is an incredibly impressive feat. Credit to Boston for continuing to trust and believe in those two and continuing to believe in their project&hellip;.proper team building is what put them in position to make the moves they did for Jrue and KP that put them over the top.</p>

      <label for="lf0wqbq" class="commentText"><p>I hope history doesn’t forget how damn important JT was in the finals. The number 1 reason Dallas even made the finals is cuz no team out west could stop the Luka and Lively/Gafford PnR. The only reason that didn’t work in the finals was cuz Tatum was actually able to match up defensively and on the boards against centers. Jaylen deservedly got a ton of credit for his POA defense on Luka but the difference between Bostons D and OKCs D (who had Dort playing great on Luka) is that Tatum was able to hold up on the other end of it.</p>

<p>There’s not many guys who can competently defend both centers and Luka straight up, out rebound centers, and then be the de facto pg on the other end. <em>That</em> is the reason Boston won.</p>

Maybe for Supper start support is a better phrase. Regular season he was definitely a super star player. Top 6 MVP is a bit complicated because in my opinion the rest of your team plays to big of a factor for an individual award but he is definitely been a top 10-15 player for the last 3 seasons.</p>
