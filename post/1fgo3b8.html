      <label for="ln5qke1" class="commentText"><p>I got to meet him when I was volunteering for my local Parks and Rec department this summer, down here in Marietta, GA. Very humble guy.</p>

<p>We were doing check ins for an event and this lady walks up with a tall guy, like taller than my booth window so I can just see his torso. And she says &ldquo;Yes hello, two for Wilkins please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, naturally, I pull up my iPad and find Wilkins and I say &ldquo;[her name] and Dominique?&rdquo; and she confirms that and I sorta giggle because I&rsquo;ve lived in Atlanta for most of my adult life and I say &ldquo;ha, that&rsquo;s funny like the Human Highlight Reel Dominique Wilkins? They have the same name. You guys must get that all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And who else but goddamn Dominique Wilkins himself leans down so I can see his face in the booth window and says &ldquo;yes, that&rsquo;s me!&rdquo; And I just fanboy all over the place.</p>

<p>I check him and (I wanna say it was) his daughter in, he asks if I&rsquo;d like a picture or an autograph and I just shake my head and say &ldquo;no, it&rsquo;s okay, just a handshake&rdquo; and he gives me one and that&rsquo;s my story of how I met Dominique Wilkins by pure happenstance.</p>

<p>he faced the bulls in the playoffs once in his career (a first round sweep). probably loses that series even against the 94 Bulls missing MJ, but regardless that hawks team wasnt a contender so it’s not really changing anything</p>

<p>and it’s not like you could argue that wilkins wouldve been considered “the guy” of the era without jordan. hakeem, malone, stockton, all better lol</p>

      <label for="ln6tm6q" class="commentText"><p>I think that&rsquo;s underselling what he accomplished tbh. Sure, he played 15 seasons, <em>technically,</em> but two of those were heavily abbreviated seasons where he was not eligible for most seasonal accolades (and seasonal accolades are pretty much the only ones worth a damn). But even then, almost all of his 70 career accolades, bar 2, were won on the Bulls. That means he won 68 accolades in just 11 full, eligible seasons.<br>
LeBron is about to enter his 22nd season and currently sits on 65 career accolades. So, he didn&rsquo;t just win less while playing 50% longer&hellip;.he won less while playing <em>100%</em> longer. And yes, without a championship for the Lakers (unlikely) he will definitely still be behind him at the end of season 22.</p>

<p>And to compare the ATG, top ten players, career accolades vs seasons played:<br>
LeBron - 65 accolades in 21 seasons - avg 3.1 per season<br>
Kobe - 60 accolades in 20 seasons (18 eligible) - 3.0 per season (3.3 per eligible)<br>
Kareem - 69 accolades in 20 seasons - 3.4 per season<br>
Duncan - 58 accolades in 19 seasons  - 3.1 per season<br>
Shaq - 47 accolades in 19 seasons - 2.5 per season<br>
Magic - 42 accolades in 13 seasons (12 eligible) - 3.2 per season (3.5 per eligible)<br>
Bird - 36 accolades in 13 seasons (11 eligible) - 2.8 per season (3.3 per eligible)<br>
Wilt - 53 in 14 seasons (13 eligible) - 3.8 per season (4.1 per eligible)<br>
Russell - 45 accolades in 13 seasons (3.5 per season)<br>
vs<br>
MJ - 70 accolades in 15 seasons (13 eligible) - 4.7 per season (5.4 per eligible)<br>
and his 68 in 11 seasons for the Bulls is 6.2 per season</p>

<p>The other top ten guys are averaging 3.2 accolades per eligible season while MJ is at 5.4 and almost double that on his crazy Bulls run.</p>

      <label for="ln73wsf" class="commentText"><p>Yes. People vastly underrate what Jordan accomplished. His run was insane. He three peated, retired, came back after two years of playing baseball, then three peated again. The only reason anyone besides the Bulls won a championship in the 8 year span is because he felt like playing baseball for a bit. To be consistently the most dominant scorer for that long, on high efficiency, while also being one of the best defensive players in the league consistently, has not been replicated since in the modern era. LeBron has one argument going in his favor and that&rsquo;s longevity. Undeniably it is impressive for him to still be this good at this point in his career. It still doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that he has objectively accomplished less than Jordan  despite playing that much longer. If LeBron had won 50% more MVPs, scoring titles, DPOYs, 1st team All-NBA/Defense, and rings, he&rsquo;d be the GOAT unquestionably. But not only has he not won more accolades, he hasn&rsquo;t even won as many accolades. I don&rsquo;t see the debate here, LeBron is clearly behind Jordan all time.</p>

LeBron has won several championships where his team is the underdog.</p>

<p>MJ won every single one of his championships where his team was <em>often</em> the favorite (hint the Bulls were stacked). MJ also couldn’t get thru the East by himself for 6 seasons and couldn’t win until he got proper teammates.</p>

<p>Both MJ and LeBron are in tier of their own but this is a TEAM sport. Stop overgrazing, building up mythos and not giving context for these guys when they have their contemporaries to do it for them and they both are so amazing they don’t need it.</p>

      <label for="ln703at" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s glazing to say MJ had far less help than LeBron over the entire course of their respective careers&hellip;.<br>
Jordan played with:<br>
14 All Star teammates (those who made a AS game at some point) for a total of 61 career appearances<br>
LeBron played with:<br>
33 All Star teammates for 142 career appearances<br>
Jordan played with:<br>
5 All NBA teammates for 23 career nominations<br>
LeBron played with:<br>
23 All NBA teamamtes for 162 career nominations<br>
Jordan played with :<br>
7 All Defense teammates for 34 career nominations<br>
LeBron played with:<br>
18 All Defense teammates for 120 career nominations</p>

<p>The fact is that LeBron hunted top tier teammates, convincing them to join up with him and he&rsquo;s done it time and time and time again since his initial Cavs failures. People say he was justified because of those failures, that they were because he had trash teams. But that&rsquo;s very far from the truth. In his last two seasons during that first Cavs stint, they won 66 and 61 games respectively, both times securing the #1 seed in the <em>entire league.</em> No team that wins that many games is trash, in fact only exceptional teams have that kind of success. And that 66 win team in 2009 swept their first two opponents in the playoffs. Their overall record to that point was 74-16. The Dwight led Magic, their opponents in the Conference Finals, weren&rsquo;t nearly as impressive leading up to that series with an overall record of 67-28. Cavs should have ran through them. It should go down as one of the biggest choke jobs of all time. LeBron was averaging 41ppg the first five games on 50% shooting yet he scored 17 less than that in the elimination game on just 40% shooting. Instead it was Dwight who dropped 40. Big time choke job and probably where the LeChoke nickname was born. He did it again the following season, shooting just 38% in that elimination game against the Celtics and famously quitting in the second half of that game.<br>
He should have taken a lot of blame for those losses. That 2010 team had four players not named LeBron James who had been All Stars in their careers. So to say those teams were trash is just utter nonsense, they were damn good teams. LeBron just underperformed in those crucial elimination games, averaging 26ppg on just 50.9% true shooting. Jordan averaged 33.3ppg on 56.9% TS in elimination games prior to his first championship.</p>

<p>Also, his teams were the favorites because of him. I recall Ben Taylor doing a video where he analyzed playoff risers and fallers and MJ was the clear biggest riser. Jordan’s teams maximized what each of their players were best at for the ultimate goal - winning. LeBron for a good chunk of his career had a playoff choker reputation and even afterward, his teams weren’t as good as the sum of their parts except in a couple years (2nd stint Cavs)</p>

      <label for="ln72m6d" class="commentText"><p>Not quite true.<br>
Yeah, that team won 54 games after MJ retired. But look at the team:<br>
MVP candidate Pippen having the best season of his entire career.<br>
Horace Grant - All Star and All Defense that season.<br>
Armstrong - All Star that season.<br>
They literally had <em>three All Stars</em> in the same season, something MJ never enjoyed in any season of his career but something LeBron has enjoyed several times.<br>
Of course they also brought in Kukoc who was coming off perhaps the greatest FIBA career of all time and who would, not long after, be awarded 6MOY in the NBA. Kerr was also a key addition, the all time career 3PT percentage leader to this day. And they had a couple of solid big guys come in as well. Their combined production actually outstripped that of Jordan himself the previous season. So you could say the team did a pretty damn good job of rebuilding straight away. Also, they got bounced in the second round so not exactly title contenders.<br>
Fast forward to the following season and they lost their power forward in Grant to the Magic. It was a big loss as they found themselves barely above 0.500 when MJ returned. With a very rusty Jordan they would go on a 13-4 run to end the season. That&rsquo;s 0.765 in case you are wondering. But Grant was missed big time in the playoffs, especially considering they went up <em>against</em> him in their loss to Orlando.<br>
Now Grant is probably one of the most underrated players in history. He was a multiple All Defense player, All Star and just an all around winning player, doing a lot of stuff that just doesn&rsquo;t show up on the stat sheet. So the Bulls desperately needed someone to fill that role and they saw it in Rodman, who at the time was a laughing stock and locker room cancer, causing trouble everywhere and getting up to probably the weirdest stuff we&rsquo;ve ever seen off a basketball court. He was a walking tragedy&hellip;so much so that Jackson had to convince MJ &amp; Pippen to give him a chance. Now of course nobody is going to pretend that Grant is a better player than Rodman, one of the greatest defenders and rebounders of all time but in terms of overall value and contribution to winning, Grant was definitely on the same level as Rodman was <em>at that point in their respective careers</em> and of course was light years ahead of him in terms of his offense. As a comparison, Rodman contributed 5.8 win shares in his last season with the Spurs and then an average of 6.7 win shares while on the Bulls. Grant had 10.0 win shares in his last Bulls season and averaged 7.6 win shares from 96-98, eclipsing Rodman&rsquo;s efforts while also beating him in every other advanced metric in that time.<br>
The point I am making is that it was as close to a &lsquo;value for value&rsquo; replacement as you could get for two guys in the same position despite their very different games. Which means that, ignoring MJ, replacing Grant with Rodman is pretty much the same team from 94 that won 54 games. Except we can&rsquo;t ignore MJ, he is the <em>real and almost sole difference</em> between the 94 and 96 teams. <em>That</em> is the comparison you should be making, not comparing the 93 and 94 teams, which as I said above were quite different from one another. So what difference did Jordan make? Well, you should know the answer. They won 72 games, breaking the all time record, and strolled to the NBA championship. They then won 69 games the next season and 62 the next to complete the threepeat. <strong>THAT</strong> is the difference Jordan made, not this utter nonsense that LeBron fans keep parroting.</p>

      <label for="ln4l7h5" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s entirely pathetic to hear recycled arguments where people grade things on a curve.  Everything LeBron did was exceptional, even his losses were amazing, whereas the victories of others have to be discounted. It&rsquo;s a team sport when I want to make excuses but it was all because of my King when he won. Bring something else to the table please.</p>

<p>You’re living in the past fighting battles for another grown man who doesn’t even know you instead of appreciating the game and giving everyone their flowers. I think LeBron’s the goat but I have no problem with people who think MJ is. I do have a problem when people glaze and take shit out of context to tear down other players.</p>

      <label for="ln76nkr" class="commentText"><p>Out of curiosity, why exactly do you consider LeBron the GOAT? Without delving into hypotheticals of course, which seems to be a staple of pro LeBron arguments, just stick with facts, how has his entire career eclipsed Jordan&rsquo;s?<br>
Jordan won more in just 11 full seasons with the Bulls than LeBron has won in 21 seasons in his career. Overall he won more accolades than any other player in history.<br>
He has more of the four major accolades than any other player in history.<br>
He was simply the greatest winner the game has ever seen (winning encompasses more than rings).</p>

<p>Statistically, he is clearly superior to LeBron, besting him in all advanced metrics which aggregate box score data to define overall player impact. There is not a single metric that puts LeBron ahead of Jordan on a per game/season basis. And let&rsquo;s face it, those are far more important and contribute far more to a team&rsquo;s rate of winning than career totals which do absolutely nothing for a team, especially when they are shared among multiple teams in LeBron&rsquo;s case. They are absolutely and categorically an individual achievement. On the other hand, per game or per season numbers absolutley contribute to a team&rsquo;s ability to win games and win championships&hellip;.they also much more accurately define player skill level in any given attribute. There are 100s of players with more career points, rebounds or whatever than other players yet the one who has less is clearly the better player in that particular discipline. Is Malone a better scorer than Jordan because he has more points? Of course not, that&rsquo;s nonsense. The best example is probably Rodman. He&rsquo;s just 24th in career rebounds yet most consider him one of the top rebounders of all time and his per game and advanced numbers (rebound %) much better reflect that. So those are the stats you should be comparing and, again, MJ has better numbers than LeBron in each and every one of those advanced metrics. In fact he has better numbers than any player in history who has played out their careers, or nearly played out their careers, so discounting someone like Jokic who is still at his peak, so his numbers will absolutely go down (his BPM for example is 9.9 right now which is #1 all time&hellip;but at the same age MJ&rsquo;s was 11&hellip;that is a HUGE difference and just shows how much better he was at his peak, the true advanced stat king).</p>

<p>So Jordan is a far greater winner as well as being statistically more dominant. He tops those categories not only in comparison to LeBron but in comparison to any player in history.<br>
Is that not the <em>definition</em> of greatness?</p>

<p>What LeBron is doing at his age is phenomenal but being really good as an old man doesn&rsquo;t make you the greatest player ever, it&rsquo;s the sum total of your career, with the most important aspect of that career being winning and he clearly does not hold a candle to MJ in that regard. Nobody does. That is why he is the GOAT&hellip;.that is why the majority of the sporting world not only considers him the greatest basketball player of all time but also the greatest single athlete of all time (google it if you don&rsquo;t believe me).<br>
This whole debate is purely media driven, it gets clicks and clicks make money. In the end that&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s about, despite how absurd the notion might be that LeBron is actually a greater player&hellip;.the truth doesn&rsquo;t matter to them, it&rsquo;s all about encouraging engagement to drive profits.                     &lsquo;</p>

<p>-edit-<br>
OK this is absolutely hilarious. I posted this comment and literally one second later saw a typo and corrected it. Would have taken five seconds. I save the edit and my comment has already been downvoted. You literally CANNOT read what I wrote in that time. So you are downvoting my comment simply because it&rsquo;s clear from the first few sentences that I don&rsquo;t think LeBron is the GOAT. You didn&rsquo;t even read nor consider my reasoning. That is the problem with LeBron stans. They simply have no ability to see reason. They just see &lsquo;MJ is the GOAT&rsquo; and simply hit the downvote button. It&rsquo;s childish, it&rsquo;s immature and quite frankly pretty damn pathetic&hellip;</p>

<p> Bc the years he won it he was at the peak of his powers statistically for sure and sure he lost but I think the general consensus is there are some legit excuses for some of the losses. </p>

<p> I mean GS and KD teamed up bc they couldn&rsquo;t beat Lebron. A healthy Cavs team wins in 2015 as well. 2007 was probably the worst roster to make it to the finals in NBA history. </p>

<p>The problem with this narrative is that LeBron himself made super teams following defeats. So why is it okay for LeBron to do it but nobody else can? When LeBron wins as a result of him stacking the deck it&rsquo;s okay, but when he loses it&rsquo;s not fair. Interesting.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You can&rsquo;t prove that they do just like I can&rsquo;t prove we win in 2016 without Draymond getting suspended. This is another example of bias. I&rsquo;m willing to accept the outcome whereas you have to curve your assessment.</p>

<p>you forgetting Kyrie averaged 30ppg in those three comeback games and hit what was pretty much the Finals winner in game 7<br>
Also, &lsquo;healthy cavs wins in 2015&rsquo; is a purely subjective opinion and cannot be proven to be true in any way, shape or form. But LeBron stans love falling back to hypotheticals to back up their weak arguments&hellip;it&rsquo;s a staple of their entire deluded philosophy lol</p>

      <label for="ln5whgp" class="commentText"><p>I can appreciate LeBron as much as the next guy. But I really don&rsquo;t see how this is an argument. Jordan has more accolades, more rings, he has the stats, and numerous people he played against have literally likened him to a God. LeBrons only advantage in the argument is that he has more volume stats. He&rsquo;s losing on every other front. If you put these two and what they&rsquo;ve accomplished side by side there&rsquo;s not much to debate, Jordan just has a better resume. LeBron should be compared to Kareem, Bird, and Magic. He compares way more favorably to them than he does Jordan.</p>

I don’t really follow hockey but I’d imagine it’s the same for Gretzky but Jordan just had the mental angle that like only .01 percent of human history had, like Napoleon or something.</p>

Because if he is Dominique’s game is nothing like Giannis but I do think Dominique would kill in the league today because he was a good enough shooter and he would still be one of the best athletes and if you’ve ever watched some of his games you know that players not being able to handcheck and play defense like they did then would give him even more offensive freedom.</p>

      <label for="ln6bkph" class="commentText"><p>I don’t care about your stats… people don’t talk about lebron this way…. Kobe is close but not like Mike.  Mike was so much more talented than anyone in the game when he was playing…. No one was able to achieve that since…. Of course if you take Michael and you put him in today’s game, he won’t be nearly as good.  Obviously skills and talent of the league grow over time and they learned from players like Mike.</p>

<p>BUT to be THAT much better than your competition is crazy to think about.</p>
