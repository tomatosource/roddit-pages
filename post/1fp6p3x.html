<p>As Kareem has risen in the GOAT debate since - because he really didn’t feature much there back then, which may surprise some - Wilt has fallen off just about as much, which is unfortunate.</p>

<p>People used to acknowledge that GOAT was largely about the player, and championships are a team accomplishment. Of course winning has always been a part of it, but simply counting titles is a pretty superficial way of determining greatness. </p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a lack of respect for the older generations who helped make the league what it is today.</p>

      <label for="lovj2k0" class="commentText"><p>In fairness to Kareem, I think part of the reason for his 21st century boost isn’t just Rings, Erneh, though that’s part of it, but a greater appreciation over time for longevity and for certain advanced stats.  Though Wilt tends to feature highly on some of those too, like win shares (Wilt is 3rd all-time in total win shares, 4th all-time in win shares/48).</p>

<p>But yeah Wilt is oddly disrespected. People talk about pace leading to his 50 point 25 rebound games, but how many players were doing that? He was a comical outlier.</p>

      <label for="lowby18" class="commentText"><p>I love Kareem, and I think we are being generous to call his behavior in the 70s-90s as prickly. Kareem was an asshole to pretty much everyone - media, NBA players, fans, etc.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Qvs5AvhyZrI" target="_blank">Charles Barkley&rsquo;s story on meeting Kareem</a> (at 9:33) is actually very civil compared to other stories about him being rude to just about anyone who interacted with him.</p>

<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t blame him for feeling the way he did or wanting privacy or anything like that, but I think the primary reason he wasn&rsquo;t in the GOAT conversation until the last 10 or so years is nobody liked him. Not his peers, not the media who could portray him positively, and not the fans who he would blow off.</p>

<p>I think the #2 reason why he gets more respect now is that to put LeBron in the conversation with MJ means we have to value longevity and sustained greatness, which has to elevate Kareem using that logic.</p>

To be fair, by all evidence he does seem to have strong asshole tendencies. But he&rsquo;s mostly known for his free throw shooting form which really discounts how great of an overall scorer he was and how amazing he was that &lsquo;74-&lsquo;75 season. He played 40 min a game for 80 games with a stat line of 30/6/6 that season, which is pretty damn great.</p>

      <label for="lowwbkh" class="commentText"><p>Good call out. Rick Barry is vastly underrated as a basketball player, he&rsquo;s solidly a top 5 player of the 70s IMO, behind Kareem and Dr J for sure, and in contention with a few others for the next tier. But he&rsquo;s arguably the biggest asshole of all NBA superstars, and had that racist comment toward Bill Russell in an NBA broadcast. He had a quote that&rsquo;s perfect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t bother me that I&rsquo;m not beloved. It bothers me that I&rsquo;m not even liked.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lovmq6a" class="commentText"><p>The big thing working against Wilt is that his stats are largely seen as too crazy to be true and a lot of his most absurd stats (e.g. 100 points in Hershey) weren&rsquo;t recorded or broadcast, often weren&rsquo;t seen by media members aside from his team&rsquo;s media, and many of the games had low attendance meaning it&rsquo;s very difficult to verify any of it.</p>

<p>Combine those two things and it&rsquo;s easy to see why Wilt&rsquo;s legacy has diminished over the years compared to Kareem, MJ, LeBron, Duncan, Kobe, Shaq, Hakeem, etc.</p>

      <label for="lovnh22" class="commentText"><p>I agree. I think Lebron has affected the discourse now with his ability to perform at such a high level for such an extended period. People are now reflecting and seeing Kareems accomplishments in a different light, and they seem to weigh heavier based on the moment.</p>

<p>I think something similar happened with MJ - people were calling asking if he was the GOAT in 90, but he hadn&rsquo;t won a championship. By 98, we still thought he was the GOAT, but after two 3 peats (with a semi-retirement/ baseball career sandwiched in the middle), people started reflecting differently on how championships factored into this decision. Wilt with only 2 championships suddenly became a notch or so lower in the publics perception, for better or worse</p>

      <label for="lowq917" class="commentText"><p>This is a great point and illustrates that our greats affect the metrics we even use for the discourse. When Russell vs Wilt was the discussion then people talked about points, rebounds/defense and leadership as the main metrics. Then Magic and Bird opened the discussion to the total offensive output to acknowledge their passing and shooting skills. Then Jordan won 6 out of 6 Finals so we started including Finals performances into account. Now with LeBron we&rsquo;ve evolved to efficiency/usage and longevity as metrics. Every new great player makes us reevaluate what it means to be great, and we judge the players of the past within this new framework.</p>

      <label for="lowgm3r" class="commentText"><p>Well, you&rsquo;re not being entirely accurate. When Wilt won his second championship, there were 17 teams.</p>

<p>But I think the point the other commenter is making is that with a smaller number of players in the league, you&rsquo;re going up against hall of famers basically every night. </p>

<p>So for someone like Bill Russell to win 11 championships against the absolute best players in the world every game, that&rsquo;s an incredibly small margin of error. He was constantly against the best of the best of his era. </p>

<p>The fact that he and his Celtics were that much better just shows how consistently great they were and how they were able to maintain an almost unbelievable level of performance despite the pressure. It would have been easy for them to have off nights and lose to other stacked teams, but they almost never did, not when it really mattered. </p>

<p>Similarly, Wilt Chamberlain had to face Russell and other great centers frequently. And he still put up absolutely amazing stats. So it&rsquo;s not like he was just dunking on nobodies. Sure, he may have benefited from a smaller talent pool at times, especially early in his career. But he put up many great performances against top players like Russell, Reed, Bellamy, Thurmond, etc.</p>

<p>In fact, an old Wilt played well against a young Kareem. Who played well against Olajuwon, who played well against Shaq. So we can see a direct line that shows these guys could compete with superstars from later generations.</p>

      <label for="low82iz" class="commentText"><p>Eh, it makes a a lot of sense when you consider the context.</p>

<p>For example, in his 100-point game, he was guarded by backup C Darrall Imhoff, who fouled out after 20 minutes, leaving 6&rsquo;8&rdquo; Cleveland Buckner—who wasn’t even a true center—to d him up. Also, in the 61-62 season, there were only like 4 players in the league 7 feet or taller compared to today which is around 50+. His rebounding is definitely a bit inflated by this height advantage and also by the fact that the league’s FG% was just 41% (47% today), meaning there were far more missed shots to grab.</p>

<p>Not to mention other things like how stats were far less scrutinized back then, there&rsquo;s an argument his stats are literally inflated. And then the question of &hellip;did the 100pt game really even happen? Not saying I don&rsquo;t believe it btw, just saying it&rsquo;s fair to be skeptical of Wilt&rsquo;s &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; looking stats because they basically played and lived a different game.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Right now currently according to Basketball reference there are 38 players who are 7 feet who are taller in the league. From 1962 to 2022 the average NBA center height increased from 6&rsquo;10.1 to 6&rsquo;10.3. Such evolution in height even though the league is bazillion times more international than in the 60s. Also having more 7 feet or more players doesn&rsquo;t really account for more roster spots.</p>

<p>Again the whole &ldquo;well did it really happen&rdquo; is exactly what I was referring to, people see the 100 pt numbers then look to debunk it because it seems to extreme and that debunking (without any proof) is used to lessen Wilts accomplishments based more on the perception that 100 pts seems like a lot versus his actual play.</p>

      <label for="lovzfxp" class="commentText"><p>Ooooorrrr&hellip; we know better now and can figure out that Wilt&rsquo;s early years, where most of his bonkers stats come from, were a definitive case of stat padding via force-fed post possessions; in an era where all stats were inflated to hell and back cause of teams playing <strong>120-130 possessions per game</strong>; that never led to better than mediocre offenses. Wilt&rsquo;s teams literally got better the less he shot the ball. And the MVP voters of the time were right, Bill&rsquo;s defense was always more valuable than Wilt&rsquo;s scoring.</p>

<p>1967 Wilt is a GOAT season candidate, and his Lakers years are genuinely underrated, but he was not even the GOAT of the 60s, let alone in all time GOAT convos. Just pointing at raw PPG without context to prop him up is like saying prime Harden was better than prime Curry or prime Lebron.</p>

<p> Anyone who watched Wilt understands that he was forced to have a huge scoring load because his teammates were not good offensively compared to him, so coaches made offenses centered around him. Increasing ball movement improved the offense because teams were doubling and tripling Wilt, and Alex Hannum introduced a scheme to take advantage of those mismatches instead of just powering through it because ‘it’s Wilt.’ Wilt was an absolute monster on both ends in the early 60s, and arguably the greatest peak ever. In 62, Wilt’s 50 ppg season, he went up against the most stacked Celtics team ever and took them to 7 games with multiple close calls that could’ve won him the series. The only reason Wilt didn’t run rampant over the entire league is because the second best player’s specific skill set was built to limit Wilt and let their teammates have bigger impacts on games.  </p>

<p>Peak Harden was a monster, and arguably better offensively in the regular season than peak lebron. However, he was trash defensively… Curry had better efficiency than Harden with lower USG - and didn’t need ref calls to be effective, making him more dependable in the playoffs (unlike elite players who depend on flopping like harden / Embiid) </p>

<p>You didn&rsquo;t watch Wilt either, unless you&rsquo;re literally 70+. And every team Wilt got traded from did just as well the season after his departure, so skip the &lsquo;he was carrying bums&rsquo; narrative. And the entire point I was making IS that it took Wilt decreasing his own shots under Hannum and allowing the ball to move in order to finally have an abover average offense, ergo his high scoring seasons weren&rsquo;t valuable, winning basketball.</p>

<p>Ok so in Curry&rsquo;s case efficiency matters, but Wilt&rsquo;s numbers coming in at barely league average (and sometimes below average) efficiency&rsquo;s just fine. I&rsquo;m not gonna even discuss the Lebron point cause it is fucking laughable.</p>

<p>Then there was a second rise of Kareem when lebron got longevity, so now both the Jordan and Lebron camps have Kareem in the top 3.</p>

      <label for="lowwddg" class="commentText"><p>Unironically, the Westbrook triple double seasons severely hurt Wilt&rsquo;s legacy because now everyone thinks gaudy stats are not only easy to get, but that it&rsquo;s a sign of a bad player.</p>

<p>They forget that Wilt still won 2 titles, was constantly losing to the 1960s iteration of the KD Warriors in the playoffs, and won 4 MVPs at a time where his playstyle and personality would&rsquo;ve likely cost him the award a couple of times due to the players voting on it.</p>

      <label for="lovp1d4" class="commentText"><p>Just wanted to add that there&rsquo;s a pretty good documentary about Bill Russell on Netflix. For a man that was treated so poorly by a lot of people he pretty much responded with love and respect. Dude went through actual racial prejudice and never wanted to be in a position above the people that wronged him, just wanted everyone to see each other as equals.</p>

<p>And never did autographs. Not even for friends. I think he said something in the doc like he doesn&rsquo;t view himself as important enough that his name on paper has value. Extremely humble dude for someone at the very top of his game.</p>

Like Bill Russell, Jerry West, in the N.B.A., I&rsquo;d be the best, like Wilt the Stilt blocking shots, my shooting eye would be so hot or like Norm Nixon, you&rsquo;d hear them say, that nothing could stop my fadeaway, I said, shoot, swoop, loop-de-loop, to take Darryl Dawkins to the hoop, I said slam, pow, to hear the sounds, of the swish of the nets from the turnaround, to give the game all that I got, to never miss a jump shot.</p>

The game where Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points, 28 of those points were from free-throws, and every single one was granny-shot.

Every time I see anyone in the NBA shooting below 80 percent I wonder if anyone has every tried to talk them about shooting underhand. I get the social pressure and the clowning etc, because its unorthodox but it&rsquo;s so crazy to me that missing damn near half your free throws feels less embarrassing! They&rsquo;re just leaving points on the floor. I always tried to convince my teammates through college to give it a  shot if they struggled at the line but time after time, they wouldn&rsquo;t do it. Still crazy to me.</p>

Someone like Steph could have set his mind to almost any mechanical movement from jump shots to golfing to darts and would have excelled.  You can get better with training but your genes will set your ceiling.</p>

      <label for="lovf3h6" class="commentText"><p>I was a 90+ percent free throw shooter.  That actually understates it, I was well above 90.  It&rsquo;s not really mental, so much as doing <em>exactly</em> the same thing every time.  If your shot is <em>identical</em> every time you throw it, if your feet are in exactly the same position, if your arms move in exactly the same way, etc&hellip;  The ball will go to exactly the same place.  Then, all you need to do is make micro-adjustments.  And, once you&rsquo;ve got that dialed in&hellip;  You don&rsquo;t miss.</p>

<p>During the game, everything is spontaneous.  Your shots are all coming in wild and unexpected ways.  But, at the line, you can take your time and do everything carefully.  That&rsquo;s how you hit your free throws.</p>
