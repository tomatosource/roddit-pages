Everyone there would say they were much happier before becoming sick. I’m sure this all depends on the exact disability but yeah, there is no magic light where you find happiness and contentment. It really does suck from top to bottom. Feel good stories are the exception, not the norm. Media outlets aren’t gonna run a story on a person who became disabled and then lived their while life depressed in their room</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m depressed and then feel guilty for being upset. So anyways thanks for this comment.</p>

I could tell you without doing trial studies that if a significant event was life altering it is going to impact your overall level of happiness for the rest of your life. I’ve never seen or heard of anyone that has lost limbs that weren’t emotionally changed for the better or worse.</p>

My mom was that super active in her kids lives mom to the point she would be the one to volunteer in Girl Scout&rsquo;s, Cub Scout&rsquo;s, the PTA, basically all our extracurriculars while also working and also managing to find time for her hobbies. Super active and social and <em>lively</em> before the heart attack. After her life became a routine of eating, meds physical therapy that only kept her body from completely locking up, more meds ,watching the same movies in a routine through the week and even more meds for a decade and a half until she finally died. I&rsquo;m afraid of the concept of ever being resuscitated because of this, made me face the reality early on that a lot of people don&rsquo;t come back who they were.</p>

<p>Yeah, after what happened with my relative my other parent and all their friends got their advanced health directives in place.</p>

<p>There are several physicians in their friend group and I think pretty much all of them declined to have any life saving measures taken if they have a health event.</p>

There&rsquo;d be grief and hardships must definitely, but there are much worse things that could happen than having no arms. My foot is cramping up just watching her, so that&rsquo;s my biggest worry about not having arms, if they didn&rsquo;t adapt to being used more and differently. </p>

<p><em>Casts himself in the role of a character who thoroughly licks her feet.</em></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be deceived, this choice was made to directly reinforce the artistic integrity of the work and had nothing to do with him being a self interested goopy little foot cretin. Think about it, that&rsquo;d be like casting yourself in a role that says the N word 50 times in 2 minutes because you wanted an N word pass. Absolutely ridiculous! Nobody would ever stoop that low.</p>

      <label for="l5pow7r" class="commentText"><p>When I was young from 3rd to 8th grade we used to do a week where a local school for the disabled brought in their students to hang out. It would all accumulate in a dance at the end of the week. All week they would come to classes, which were usually just hanging out, and spend time together.  There was a young girl like this that I never forgot. She could draw beautiful pictures and write better with her feet than I ever could. She did everything with them including eating with a fork and spoon. It was quite neat to watch her doing stuff and learning new stuff by the time we would see her the next year. Her dexterity and flexibility were super impressive. She could jump straight up with her legs from the laying position. Just everything ahe did was impresssive like this. She&rsquo;d be in her late 30s now and I hope she&rsquo;s still out there living her best llfe.</p>

<p>transatlantic accent</p>
</blockquote>

<p>fashionably used by the American upper class and entertainment industry of the late 19th century to mid-20th century, that blended elements from both American and British English. The accent was embraced in private independent American preparatory schools, especially by members of the Northeastern upper class, as well as in schools for film, radio, and stage acting</p>

      <label for="l5pmhpd" class="commentText"><p>That is really mind blowing. It reminds me of an article I read years ago about a guy who similarly, used his feet for everything and he repaired watches with his feet.  Examples of the triumph of the human spirit. Nobody would blame them for going to easy route and taking a job, stomping, grapes, but they refused to let their disability dictate their career options.</p>

      <label for="l5pszjn" class="commentText"><p>&ldquo;  Inspiration porn is a term used to describe society’s tendency to reduce people with disabilities to objects of inspiration. You’ve all seen the memes, “the only disability in life is a bad attitude.” Or a picture of a small child running on prosthetic legs accompanied by the caption “what’s your excuse?” These images make the people viewing them feel great, but often they take images of people with disabilities simply living their daily lives and make them extraordinary. But at what cost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I love that ableist people were making this kind of content then and keep on making it today&hellip; to make abled bodied feel better about themselves and also to refuse to actually change a society in any form. Instead to keep accommodating abled bodied people, while telling disabled people &ldquo;hey we are all equal. You are Inspirational! It is all a matter of attitude! 😉&rdquo;. </p>
