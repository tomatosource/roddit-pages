<p>If he was an 85%+ free throw shooter that alone would change a lot for my opinion on his outlook.</p>

<p>But playing next to a 4 like Jaren Jackson is literally the perfect NBA pairing for him.</p>

      <label for="lg6evqt" class="commentText"><p>Over his 4 years in college he shot 71% on 6.8 attempts a game.</p>

<p>Pretty decent for a big man, don&rsquo;t know if he can increase that to 80% but maybe mid-70s should be possible and that means defenses wouldn&rsquo;t just be able to hack at him in the post.</p>

<p>For reference, someone like Shaq was shooting 52% from the line. Yao was shooting 83% from the line. Wemby is currently at about 80%. I think Edey ends up somewhere in the middle of those two extremes (Shaq and Yao).</p>

      <label for="lg6904a" class="commentText"><p>I forget the number but I think for bigs if they&rsquo;re like about 80% FT, guys scoring at the rim like Edey cause a lot of problems for defenses because at a certain point fouling is going to mean its still an efficient possession for the offense. And, if Edey is playing 24+ mpg, that&rsquo;s a lot of time for that threat to be out there. 300 lb and 7&rsquo;4&rdquo; is like Shaq/Yao size. Those two both used their gargantuan stature differently, but we haven&rsquo;t seen this in a while. Edey is not athletic like Shaq.</p>

<p>Luckily Edey will struggle on defense, we will see to what extent.</p>

<p>Edey seems like a good guy and a pro, and the haters he got in college really make me want to see him find success.</p>

      <label for="lg52u3q" class="commentText"><p>This is the sanest answer here.  </p>

<p> The Grizzlies coaching staff have all been emphasizing flexibility (adaptability) with the lineups. If we need to play small ball with Jaren Jackson at the 5 and Brandon Clarke or GG Jackson at the 4 then we will. But having the option to play a huge, bulky center to set hard screens and dominate on the glass is exactly what we needed. </p>

<p> He may not average double digit scoring, but on offense, he will elevate Ja&rsquo;s and Bane&rsquo;s games because of the monster screens and because of Ja&rsquo;s willingness to take more difficult shots when we have a good chance of getting the rebound.</p>

      <label for="lg60ap8" class="commentText"><p>At the <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>, they should be able to play JJJ/Clarke, JJJ/Edey, Santi/Clarke, Santi/Edey, JJJ/Santi, and GG with all 4 of them. I doubt Diakite will see any minutes barring injury, but LaRavia could get some minutes at the 4 as well. Certainly a crowded rotation, but I would expect JJJ and Edey to be the normal starters, and JJJ/Edey/Clarke to get the most minutes (JJJ as a clear number 1 of the three).</p>

      <label for="lg58nqu" class="commentText"><p>The scenario is he’s gonna get eaten alive on the PnR. His post moves will mostly translate (though he’ll have to adapt to doubles coming faster) and the rebounding will be there, but anytime Newton/Cam/Castle drove on him in the title game, he kept getting caught between them and Clingan/Slamson for easy UConn buckets. His defensive instincts just aren’t there.</p>

<p>I still give him the inside track for RotY since he’ll get the opportunity and will put up stats, but I think he’ll be a sieve.</p>

      <label for="lg5q430" class="commentText"><p>Agreed. I think Edey’s floor is at least a better, bigger Zubac and his ceiling is all star level if he ever maximizes his skill + size combination. </p>

<p>He has the potential to be a great Jokic defender. 7’4”, 7’11” wingspan, 300 lbs, very strong, and actually moves well for a guy his size. If the Grizzlies ever get matched up with Denver in the playoffs, he could on paper be a huge difference maker. </p>

<p>The Grizzlies can also run the Bucks big blueprint. Use Edey as the anchor, drop big who does more of the physical work like Lopez. Use JJJ as a help defender/clean up guy, like the Bucks use Giannis for. </p>

      <label for="lg6zg2z" class="commentText"><p>Well I think he has a somewhat similar skillset to Zubac, but he’s bigger and more physically talented with higher defensive upside. I think Edey at his worst case scenario, is a bigger Zubac given some of the similarities in their game. But he could be too big of a defensive liability, to where he would not get better than a solid NBA starter.</p>

<p>That’s why I am saying a bigger Zubac as his floor = a conservative estimation imo.</p>

      <label for="lg73j3l" class="commentText"><p>I just mean, I think that’s probably a median outcome for him (solid NBA starter). It’s certainly not his floor imo, there’s a non-zero chance he doesn’t make it in the league because of his slowness, or ends up as a backup center. That’s all I mean. If someone’s floor is Zubac, that’s an extremely easy top 5 pick in a draft like this. </p>

<p>Edey can definitely match or surpass Lively’s counting stats though and I think he will probably be on the court more than Lively was. He’s going to be a very solid contributor right out of the gate, just in a specific role.</p>

<p>Lively will be better switching on to the perimeter, Edey better at turning OREB into put backs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say Edey is far more advanced as a post player. You can argue that the NBA doesn&rsquo;t play that way, but guys like him don&rsquo;t come around often.</p>

Edey’s ideal role, being a ball-dominant big man that you run the offense through, is almost certainly not going to be the role he plays in the pros. He may very well still have an excellent rookie season, but their numbers will be much closer than their college matchup</p>

<p>Edey really didn&rsquo;t start taking this seriously until his sophomore year in college. He has improved at a much higher rate if we&rsquo;re looking at what he was at 16 to now. I don&rsquo;t know if putting a cap on his development due to his age applies the same way.</p>

<p>There comes a point in every players career where they have to prioritize being the very best at what they are already capable of over adding new wrinkles. There is plenty of time for both of these guys to improve and develop</p>

<p>Lively seemed very one dimensional. Great rim runner. He&rsquo;s wasn&rsquo;t all that useful in half court offense and can easily hack-a-Shaq him as a 59% ft shooter. Luckily you have Luka and Kyrie to do the gritty half-court work for you.  </p>

<p>He was also a rookie - plenty of room for improvement and I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll see it this coming season. Getting all that playoff experience going finals is like a hyperbolic time chamber for these young fellas.</p>

      <label for="lg5cgrd" class="commentText"><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say Lively is &ldquo;one-dimensional,&rdquo; but I mostly concur with what some of the others are saying.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m actually very high on Lively&ndash;brilliant pick, and a perfect match for what the Mavs needed.  From watching him play a few times, I specifically think Mark Williams has a much higher ceiling.  Lively seems more like a perfect role guy&ndash;rim running, rim protecting, low turnover&ndash;while Williams seems to have the same attributes with a more dominant physical presence on both ends and a little softer of a touch around the rim.</p>

<p>I think Williams could be an all-star.  I don&rsquo;t really see that talent in Lively, but hey&hellip;</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t watched Duren play too much, but he&rsquo;s put up some big numbers&ndash;which isn&rsquo;t really everything but it&rsquo;s something.</p>

<p>Notice I said &ldquo;might&rdquo; be the worst of the three.</p>

      <label for="lg4y2vq" class="commentText"><p>He is 100% from 3 on the Playoffs.
He attempted in total 3 3s making one, but at least one of the other was with very low clock and just had to heave it.
He is not a great free throw shooter, but that 3 on the playoffs was kinda a designed play where he was put on the strong side corner, which imo is huge because they actually think he CAN make those 3s even being a poor ft shooter.</p>

<p>That being said, i would be actually surprised to see him being like a real threat from 3 point, but i guess we will see this year if he gets a longer leash.</p>

      <label for="lg4nv1f" class="commentText"><p>Is there even a consensus on the 3 players you are comparing him to? I mean, Duren has the best numbers but there&rsquo;s lots of questions over his BBIQ and actual value, or is it just big numbers on a bad team. Williams is the best defender defender of the 3, but hasn&rsquo;t gotten a whole lot of the spotlight or played in important games, and Lively has the worst numbers, but has played a really important role on a very good team and may actually be the most suited to playing C in the modern NBA.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think either of those guys is a fair comparison for Edey. He&rsquo;s the same age as Williams and 2 years older than Lively and Duren.
He will be underachieving if he&rsquo;s not the most NBA ready of this draft class.</p>

<p>As long as he gets minutes, he should be putting up 10-12ppg and 8-10rpg out of the gate. The question will be what he looks like on defence, and whether he has the versatility, on both ends, to help the Grizz win when he&rsquo;s not getting the ball in the post, and if he is played out of his comfort zone on defence.</p>

      <label for="lg56975" class="commentText"><p>He was drafted to play the Steven Adams role. He&rsquo;s most likely gonna start and get a ton of rebounds. His presence on the court will elevate Ja and Jaren in a way not many other players can. Assuming he sets the picks he did in college/SL and is as elite of a rebounder as he&rsquo;s shown, he&rsquo;s gonna be huge for us. For Ja, he&rsquo;s gonna get more space with monster screens, he&rsquo;s gonna have the biggest player in the league to dump off to when driving, and he&rsquo;s gonna get more opportunities with all the expected rebounds. With Edey Jaren will be able to move back to roaming PF where he won DPOY. Edey can do the dirty work below the basket and eat fouls. Just a perfect match considering Jaren&rsquo;s biggest issues are rebounding and fouling. The reason we were such a good team the past years before last was solely because of what Adams did for us in his dirty work role. Once he went down, we were cooked. Edey should be able to fill his role but also adds some more levels to it with his elite size and interior dominance. Is there any player in the league rn who was a more dominant interior scorer than Edey in college? I think this is the biggest X Factor with him. His scoring is gonna help our half court playoff offense immensely. Whenever our offense goes stagnant, we have the biggest player in the league with elite touch around the rim waiting for us to pass to. Jenkins is a great coach and now our roster is more versatile than ever before. So many different lineups and mismatches can be made.</p>

<p>This article while being biased and wordy gives the defense to his biggest arguments against him. Specifically, if you scroll down to that 4-year college big argument defense. His interior dominance is generational in ways Hansborough/Garza just weren&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;d also argue he&rsquo;s a lot less slow footed than many people believe. But yes I&rsquo;m very optimistic, he was number two on my draft board behind only Sheppard. The fact that he went to my team, which is probably his best possible fit in the league, makes me even more optimistic. I&rsquo;ll also add that since he&rsquo;s much newer to basketball than most, and was awful in HS, improving every year in college makes him different. Not like he was a HS phenom who went to college and stayed all 4 years. He was a nobody and even now is still relatively new to the sport.</p>

      </div>
      <label for="lg6c88g" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ll revert to the article posted earlier here:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zach Edey is not Luka Garza. He is not Oscar Tshiebwe. He is not Kofi Cockburn. He is not Frank Kaminsky. He is not Ethan Happ. He is not Jahlil Okafor. He is not Tacko Fall. He is not Drew Timme. </p>

<p>Over the last three years, I’ve seen a bevy of shameless Edey comparisons. People basically compare him to slow, post-up oriented bigs who dominated college and failed in the NBA, and use this availability heuristic to prove that Edey is destined to fail too.</p>

<p>Edey is genuinely not in the same stratosphere as these players. Besides being generationally large (seven foot FIVE!!) with generational production, Edey clears these players in yet another very unique way: interior dominance.</p>

<p>To me, interior dominance is the single most important offensive trait for a big. You need to be able to score inside at a consistent level, against a variety of different coverages. From Sengun (50 dunks in his pre-draft year) to Bam (100 dunks in his pre-draft year), strong interior performance is both sticky and highly undervalued by draftniks. </p>

<p>For instance, perhaps the most ubiquitous Edey negative comparison is Luka Garza. Let me put that comp to rest real quick: Edey had 86 halfcourt dunks in his senior season, and Garza had 8 halfcourt dunks in his senior season. Just a vastly different level of athlete and interior force.</p>

<p>Edey just had the most dominant interior season of the modern era. 109 dunks, 80 FTR, most FTs in a season, 80% at the rim; these are video game numbers. Trust me when I say that no one in at least a few decades comes close to those kinds of numbers. Don’t ignore that ridiculous free throw rate; Edey made the most FTs of the modern era by virtue of his one-of-a-kind controlled physicality. Tshiebwe, Garza, Hansborough, Kaminsky all had some slight issues with their offensive interior dominance, and yet this is Edey’s biggest strength. How quickly we forget, the game is about a bucket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edey is just different. It&rsquo;s unfair to compare him to any previous guys because he&rsquo;s one of a kind. Elite touch around the rim, elite strength below the basket, largest player in the league, a foul magnet for opposing bigs, good FT shooting. He was unstoppable in college. Okay the NBA will have bigger players, but he&rsquo;s still gonna be the bigger guy and his interior scoring skill and strength will translate. If he gets the ball within a few feet of the basket he&rsquo;s gonna draw a foul or score.</p>

<p>This could almost be used verbatim to describe Boban. Boban was capable of dominating offensivley but his lack of mobility kept him from dominating the league.</p>

<p>To me Edey is way closer to the Boban end of the spectrum than to the Wemby end of the spectrum in terms of speed and quickness.</p>

      <label for="lg522l2" class="commentText"><p>I think his value will depend a lot on his positioning and screen setting. If he can offer something similar to Steven Adams where he sets hard screens, boxes out effectively, and is decent at rebounding, he will be incredibly valuable, given that he already has some semblance of a post game and is a good FT shooter for a center. My understanding is that he has good BBIQ for a college player and very good endurance. Hopefully, he can be effective in a drop scheme because I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll be quick enough for other defensive styles.</p>

<p>Long term, I don&rsquo;t expect Edey to be an All-Star (maybe in a weak year where his team does well). He&rsquo;s been a consistent 70% FT shooter on a lot of attempts in college, so I think he&rsquo;ll have the benefit of not being a hacking target. If he&rsquo;s big as hell, smart, hits his free throws, screens well, and capable of moving his feet, he&rsquo;ll start in the NBA for a while.</p>

He&rsquo;s gonna be starting but won&rsquo;t get more than like 24 minutes a game at the most. Gonna start halves, maybe finish a few games against certain matchups but overall he&rsquo;s gonna probably be in the 20 minutes a game mark, a little over 20 perhaps, so that is something to keep in mind.</p>

<p>But I expect him to put up healthy numbers in those minutes and the Grizz should win a lot, so he can win ROY.</p>

      <label for="lg5mpnx" class="commentText"><p>Edey hype has gone way off the rails. He’s barely a rotation player, if that. I don’t think people realize how badly he will be targeted and annihilated on opposing teams’ pick and rolls. He’s too slow and won’t be able to effectively defend some of the better bigs in the league because they aren’t half a foot shorter than him like in college. Any stretch PF or C will nullify his paint presence as well. It’s not his offense that anyone should be focused on, it’s the potential for disaster on defense.</p>

<p>More importantly, look at the careers of 7’4”+ guys in the history of the league. Most are injury plagued and had short careers. Couple of good players (Yao being the best by far) in there but I’m saying the odds are stacked against him.</p>

If anything, I&rsquo;d be worried that he doesn&rsquo;t fit the mold of a modern center enough to get a lot of opportunity. He&rsquo;s more like the kind of center that has been phased out for the past 10 years or so and isn&rsquo;t much like a guy like Lively at all. Which is a shame because I&rsquo;d like to see him play more.</p>

<p>Personally, I&rsquo;m skeptical about his NBA-readiness, but for better or worse, he&rsquo;s our guy.</p>

      <label for="lg4npyg" class="commentText"><p>Think people need to manage their expectations a bit. It&rsquo;s not even guaranteed that he&rsquo;ll be the starter (although I do expect him to eventually become that), Memphis may elect to play a smaller faster lineup with BC and Jaren in the frontcourt or even Jaren as the lone big and play GG at the 4. He&rsquo;d be the day 1 starter on a lot of bad teams but this is a proper playoff team in Memphis and he&rsquo;ll have to earn his spot</p>
