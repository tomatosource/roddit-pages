      <label for="lekcv3l" class="commentText"><p>I feel like the excerpt quoted doesn&rsquo;t really do justice to Chris Mullin&rsquo;s full take here. There&rsquo;s a lot of additional context to what he said but as is often the case, that all gets reduced to the one sentence that&rsquo;ll draw the most significant reaction.</p>

<p>In the full interview, he delves deeper into how things have changed in today&rsquo;s modern international climate, including the hurdles the 2024 USA team must jump that his didn&rsquo;t:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No. 1 is these rosters are full of NBA players. So there are better players on the team and there is more talent [elsewhere]. No. 2, the fear factor does not exist because they’ve competed against or with these players that they’ve matched up against. They feel they belong. So as opposed to coming into the game in awe and wanting to meet people, they’re trying to come in and win that game. That’s a totally different mindset than from decades ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That being said, if anyone is expecting Chris Mullin to sit back and <em>not</em> playfully talk trash about being matched up with any prospective opponents (in theory or otherwise), then you may be unfamiliar with Chris Mullin&rsquo;s game (which would make sense, since he&rsquo;s kind of old now).</p>

He’s regularly involved with the Warriors still and does our pre and postgame show. He’s more than familiar with today’s basketball landscape. He’s definitely not a full on “back in my day” type of ex player</p>

<p>Oscar Roberson is an old head curmudgeon?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure Roberson&rsquo;s opinion has changed since then, but one of the most memorable moments from 2016 for me was when Steph was obliterating the league, old dudes were crawling out of the woodwork to knock him down. Oscar Robertson said this about Steph:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I&rsquo;ve got a guy who&rsquo;s great shooting the ball outside, don&rsquo;t you want to extend your defense out a little bit? I just don&rsquo;t think coaches today in basketball understand the game of basketball. They don&rsquo;t know anything about defenses. They don&rsquo;t know what people are doing on the court. They talk about analytical basketball and stuff like that. They double-teamed me an awful lot during my career. I look at games today, and they&rsquo;ll start a defense at the foul line. When I played, they were picking you up when you got the ball inbounds. So it&rsquo;s a different strategy about playing defense. He&rsquo;s shot well because of what&rsquo;s going on in basketball today. In basketball today, it&rsquo;s almost like if you can dunk or make a 3-point shot, you&rsquo;re the greatest thing since sliced bread. &hellip; When I played years ago, if you shot a shot outside and hit it, the next time I&rsquo;m going to be up on top of you. I&rsquo;m going to pressure you with three-quarters, half-court defense. But now they don&rsquo;t do that. &hellip; [Modern-day teams] run one play. Well, maybe two plays. They&rsquo;ve got a high-pick with the center, then the shooters run baseline trying to get open with blocks from the forwards. I mean that&rsquo;s it. You don&rsquo;t see hardly any reverse plays at all, no double screens, no weak side and whatnot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to pretend that I watched Oscar Robertson&rsquo;s games. It would be silly to do so, because most of his games were not televised. Basketball simply wasn&rsquo;t that important as a sport back then. However, from what I know, he definitely sounds like a delusional old head, considering he played in an era famous for its lack of defense and insane pace. Additionally, offensive schemes have developed immensely since he played, and the idea that modern teams &ldquo;run one or two plays&rdquo; is especially ridiculous. To be talking about the Warriors and then say they don&rsquo;t run double screens or weakside cuts is&hellip; yeah. Finally, there&rsquo;s the idea that all players had to do was to press up on Curry is just amazing. Yeah, go ahead and try that. One of the following will happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>Steph blows by you</li>
<li>Steph breaks your ankles and shoots a three</li>
<li>Draymond sets a screen, and you can&rsquo;t get around it because you were up too close on Steph. Then, Steph dumps the ball off to Draymond on the roll to the basket, and he kicks it to Klay or a curling Steph.</li>
</ul>

<p>I remember this happening because it was the last of a series of players criticizing modern basketball, and Steph Curry in particular. I can&rsquo;t find when Robertson said this, but one article mentions a recent Magic game, which occurred on February 25th. Steph had 51. Two days later, the Warriors and OKC fought a battle in OT on national TV. I don&rsquo;t even have to tell you what happened next&ndash;that&rsquo;s how legendary that game is, now. As a fan at the time, it was an incredible moment, and it felt like Steph was demolishing old-school basketball. That&rsquo;s not an inaccurate description of what happened. Also, this critcism was (kinda) discussed nationally and on local TV&hellip; I think Jim Barnett (local color guy and NBA vet) even tweeted something like, &ldquo;how do you stop that, Oscar?&rdquo; after the OKC game. It was a ton of fun! For me, I&rsquo;ll always remember this as the quintessential &ldquo;old head is jealous&rdquo; moment.</p>

<p>The 2024 team will face 61. And this also doesn’t mention how the complimentary talent around those guys is also better, even if they don’t play in the NBA.</p>

<p>To be clear, I’m not saying the 2024 team would win because of this but these old heads (fans and players) just don’t seem to understand the massive difference in competition each team faced/will face</p>

<p>He’s not being dumb and this type of light trash talk is the most normal thing in the world. He’s gonna rep his iconically good team and he should. I’m more interested in if anyone on the Dream Team doesn’t think they’re the best ever.</p>

<p>And they beat them by a million.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 2024 team will face 61. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>South Sudan is not loaded with high-level NBA talent. Wenyen Gabriel is a career 4ppg guy, who played in 5 games last season while shooting 36%.</p>

<p>The Croatian team that played America in 1992 had 3 HOFers: Drazen Petrovic, Toni Kukoc, and Dino Radja. Petrovic was coming off a 21/3/3 NBA season. Kukoc debuted in the NBA in 1994, averaging 11/4/3. Radja debuted in the NBA in 1993, averaging 15/7/1. The Croatian team also had 2 more NBA players: Zan Tabak (8 NBA seasons) and Stojko Vrankovic (5).</p>

<p>America beat them by 33 in round robin play, and then by 32 in the final.</p>

<p>America also beat Lithuania, which had 2 HOFers (Marcuilionis and Sabonis), by 51 in the semifinals.</p>

<p>Nothing against Gabriel and Carlik Jones, but they aren&rsquo;t HOFers. Those 3 Croats and 2 Lithuanians are. And the Dream Team crushed them.</p>

      <label for="leles7j" class="commentText"><p>I do think there is a mental side of things that is tough to quantify. 1992 was the first time ever NBA players had been allowed to play in the Olympics. They had a point to prove to the rest of the world, just how much better they are than the rest of the world and played with that type of cut throat attitude you simply can’t fake. Winning wasn’t enough, they had to win by 30.</p>

<p>2008 redeem team had that after being embarrassed in 2004. You could see the difference in mentality in the South Sudan warmup game. One team is treating it like the biggest game in country history, while one was playing like they had to be there (which tbf it was a warmup game). I anticipate the US doesn’t play with that attitude in the actual Olympic matches, but they won’t be able to replicate the attitude of the 1992 team</p>

      <label for="leki84b" class="commentText"><p>I think the 2024 team is the first team in three decades to even be remotely comparable to dream team 1, but thats all it is, remotely comparable.</p>

<p>Like yes it was stacked with hall of famers but that actually undersells how extraordinary Dream team 1 was, because it was not just stacked with all time greats, but all time greats at or near their peaks. . Even if you just focus on Jordan/Magic/Pippen/Barkley/Robinson as a theoretical starting 5, that&rsquo;s</p>

<ul>
<li>the greatest player of all time at his absolute peak.
-the greatest point guard of all time, slightly past his prime (and forced to retire early due to HIV) but still seriously great.</li>
<li>one of the top 5 power forwards of all time at his absolutely peak.</li>
<li>one of the top 5 small forwards of all time approaching his absolute peak.</li>
<li>one of the top 10 centres of all time heading towards his peak.</li>
</ul>

<p>The idea that you were running into not just the biggest names in basketball history but, other than bird, those guys at or near their absolute best is what made dream team 1 so stupendous.  Whilst LeBron and Curry are comparable overall playersto Jordan and Magic the difference is they are doing this when they are well past their prime whilst &lsquo;92 was probably Jordan at his absolute peak. And whilst Barkley and Durant are probably of similar stature when you put their careers side by side, again, &lsquo;92 was absolute prime Barkley rather than later in his career.</p>

He was just not talked about enough despite putting up numbers. Both shot over 50% from the field and blazed on defense.</p>

<p>That team would have been nuts.</p>

<p>But you are underrating the 96 team here man. That team had loads of talent.</p>

      <label for="lekpbk4" class="commentText"><p>Possible yeah, but he shot over 50% two times in his career and those were the first two championship years. 90-91 he was at 52% shooting, the highest he would ever go and right behind Jordan by a bit. 91-91 was very close to 93-94 with better shooting. 93-94 was pretty damn good year too, but I wouldn&rsquo;t say he was better at all.</p>

<p>His prime can for sure be debated, but both players would never shoot better than their 90-91 years, and they were also at or near their most athletic at this point in time. Some would obviously point to Jordan&rsquo;s later 80s as his most athletic, but he was fully a mature player by his first.</p>

      <label for="lekq91m" class="commentText"><p>Except obviously MJ (and whatever the position it&rsquo;s just silly to compare him in his prime to anyone on the current team except Lebron) I disagree with every single one of those comparisons, including Robinson &amp;gt; Embiid.</p>

<p>If you assess peak by how close in time they were to an mvp award, the 1992 team is just so far ahead its not funny.</p>

<p>Magic  (1990)
Jordan (1991) (1992)
Barkley (1993)
Robinson (1995)</p>

<p>Compared to</p>

<p>Lebron (2013)
Curry (2016)
Durant (2014)
Embiid (2023)</p>

<p>So of those only Embiid is arguably at or near his peak.</p>

<p>And if you do it by All NBA first and second teams the difference is even more obvious. <em>Every</em> person on the 1992 all nba first team made the dream team, and <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> from the all nba second team made it. So literally speaking the team included nine of the ten best performing players in the world at that point in time.</p>

<p>The current dream team consists of one current all nba first teamer (Tatum) and three all nba second team players.</p>

      <label for="lekxegy" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I just disagree,</p>

<p>Hell if (for no reason I can possibly see) you want to do it off finals mvps or recent trips to the finals the 1992 team is still way ahead. Even allowing for Jordan  taking all the final MVPs the dream team had the next two best performing players in the finals in 1991 (Magic, Pippen) 1992 (Drexler, Pippen) and 1993 (Barkley, Pippen)</p>

<p>The more I look at it the more convinced I am there is simply no contest, by any possible measure 1992 is a better group of players closer to their peak.</p>

<p>And by the way  go have a look at magic&rsquo;s stats in the 1991 playoffs and say he was dropping off. He was not great defensively but he was still an offensive superstar, he absolutely carried that lakers team to the finals.</p>

      <label for="lel8ui3" class="commentText"><p>According to the (excellent) Jack Mccallum book on that 92 team, Jordan was obviously Jordan, but Barkley and Pippen were really the two  guys on that team who made it impossible to play against.</p>

<p>If any of the other stars were cold, Barkley would just bully people out of the way to the ring and score, and the moment any opposing player looked liked getting into a rhythm Pippen would be on them and that would be the end of that. Not only was he an incredible combination of length and agility, thanks to years spent playing the most difficult game of one on one conceivable at the bulls practice sessions, Pip was simply the best man on man defender in the world by that time. Nothing phased him, if he was locked in on someone they weren&rsquo;t going to score.</p>

<p>Those two were  offensive and defensive cheat codes that took the opposition&rsquo; already low chances of winning to absolute zero.</p>

<p>is ridiculous, when you&rsquo;re comparing 2024 Lebron vs 1992 Barkley. Barkley won MVP in the 92-93 season. You think Lebron is sniffing MVP next year?</p>

<p>Career-wise sure Lebron &amp;gt; Barkley, but you should be evaluating them in the moment - like you did with Steph and Magic.</p>

<p>Because if you want to talk career-wise, Magic &amp;gt; Steph.</p>

      <label for="lempt09" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s actually the point he was trying to make. The title is clickbait and doesn&rsquo;t do him justice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No. 1 is these rosters are full of NBA players. So there are better players on the team and there is more talent [elsewhere]. No. 2, the fear factor does not exist because they’ve competed against or with these players that they’ve matched up against. They feel they belong. So as opposed to coming into the game in awe and wanting to meet people, they’re trying to come in and win that game. That’s a totally different mindset than from decades ago.</p>

      <label for="lel2mot" class="commentText"><p>I’m sure there were more capable players that could have played in the nba but simply didn’t. Most international players had no interest in the nba until later in their careers. Kukoc, Petrovic for example were prolific international players and didn’t enter the nba until 25 years of age. Sabonis was 31. That won’t happen today. Scouting is a big part of this too, doubt Jokic, or Giannis is even found pre 2000s.</p>

      <label for="lekloby" class="commentText"><p>They also disrespect how good players have gotten. Lebron is a genetically engineered freak of nature the likes that never really existed before, Curry is a trained sniper the likes that really never existed before. The only archetype they’d be ready for are Bam, AD and Embiid and then those fuckers go to the wing and shoot threes. The game has changed.</p>

Dude&rsquo;s almost 30, that&rsquo;s like the scientific benchmark for an NBA player&rsquo;s prime years.</p>

Most of those guys on the Dream Team were at their peak. They would have every player to defend the 24 team, including Jordan on Steph, Pippen on Lebron, and David Robinson on Embiid or AD. And then you had everyone else&hellip; the weakest dude would have been Chris Mullin&hellip; who never missed. I haven&rsquo;t even mentioned Bird and Magic or Barkley  (who is a nastier version of Draymond from an attitude perspective)</p>

They weren&rsquo;t completely washed (well Larry may have been by 90s NBA standards), but compared to current day Anthony Edwards they may as well have been. MJ literally told them both to their faces he just replaced them as the face of the league during all the scrimmages and prep for Barcelona.</p>

<p>Kind of ironic people are making fun of the &lsquo;24 team for <em>almost</em> losing to pros, but give the &lsquo;92 team a pass for losing to kids. Both were exhibition games, so either none of these games matter or both count towards each team&rsquo;s legacy.</p>

      <label for="lelifdx" class="commentText"><p>Personally, I am not judging them. I&rsquo;m not really concerned. I&rsquo;m just going by the personnel here. There is no way this team matches up against that team, and it&rsquo;s pretty obvious to me. 2012 and 1996 are really the only teams that have a chance. And 2012 is a bit short on the bigs while 96 actually adds Hakeem and has Penny and Hill in their short primes.</p>

<p>Anyway you have it this team does not compare to those teams IMO. That doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t like them lol. I&rsquo;m a MN fan so Edwards is there, despite being young and not quite flowing well in these games all the time.</p>

<p>And then throw Lebron and Tatum and Durant and you have these supersized wings who can shoot and the 94 team is getting strangled. Lebron sees Barkley or Pippen and it’s bbq chicken.  That’s if 92 doesn’t need oxygen masks chasing shooters off the 3pt line.</p>

      <label for="lekn6x1" class="commentText"><p>Definitely. Both those centers are not up to the standard of prime Robinson and Ewing. Embiid&rsquo;s game is weaker without the flops, and Drob and Ewing certainly are not gonna take any shit for flops.</p>

<p>Literally, 92 was basically the prime for a lot of these guys, and they were massive and absurdly athletic. Most of the team were MVPs lol.</p>

<p>96 actually matches up way better. Hakeem and Shaq are added to the Jazz combo and Pippen with Barkley still there. Then add Hill and Penny in their short primes. Yeah that squad could actually pose a problem.</p>

<p>But Magic, Jordan, Pippen, Malone/Barkley/ Robinson/Ewing is absolutely a nutter combo from those years. The defense would have been nuts.</p>

      <label for="lekjaaz" class="commentText"><p>I think going big actually hurts 92. Because the strategy for 24 would be go under everything and make Jordan shoot 3s (he shot 27% that year). That becomes easier if you have Ewing and Malone on the floor.  Rotate Holiday/White/Edwards on MJ and go under everything with Tatum Lebron Durant AD Bam.</p>

<p>If I am 92 I need MJ in space attacking the rim. Give me Stockon MJ Drexler Pippin and Barkley and just play hyper aggressive spaced out small ball. But then again, Pippin Chuck and Drexler hit a combine 162 threes.  No space and now they just small.</p>

<p>We have evolved as a basketball culture.</p>

<p>And the 92 team has 2 rotation guys who were literally retired(magic and bird). Imagine thinking you can get past a usa basketball level player in retirement?</p>

<p>As a team they shot 40% from 3 in 92. They also don&rsquo;t need to screen Jordan if you&rsquo;re leaving him up top with Booker.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What are you all talking about? Magic was literally the runner up in the MVP going into the olympics. He didn&rsquo;t retire because of a decline ability. There was actually a very famous reason he retired.</p>

      <label for="leknim7" class="commentText"><p>Nice imagination you got there.</p>

<p>MJ was a better athlete in every single way than Curry.  When he locked in on D, it was over.  If FVV can smother Steph, then you better believe he can neutralize Curry.  Although I think John Stockton would do just fine on Curry, he&rsquo;s got the endurance to chase him all over the court and avg 2.5-3 stl per game in his prime&hellip;.which he was in for Dream Team.</p>

<p>Pippen had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd2GgvXt3SM" target="_blank">the best season of his career</a> the year before Dream Team, he was 28 yrs old, avg 22pts, 8.7rbs, 5.6ast, 2.9stl, 0.8blk per game&hellip;.Lebron is 39&hellip;.no BBQ there buddy.  Pip was 3rd in MVP voting, 4th DPOY, All-NBA 1st and All-Def 1st team that year</p>

<p>Pippen could also guard Tatum, GL Channy.</p>

<p>Durant&rsquo;s not even playing, he might rip another achilles if he does.</p>

<p>Lebron, Malone and Robinson will be the strongest guys on the floor.  No one&rsquo;s gonna stop Malone when he gets on his spot&hellip;he&rsquo;s too strong, too wide and his shot is automatic.</p>

<p>Robinson also had a career year before Dream Team: 29.8pts, 10.7rbs, 4.8ast, 1.7stl, 3.3blk honestly can&rsquo;t see Sloppy Joe or Street Clothes stopping him in any meaningful way.  The Admiral was a beast who never took a night off.</p>

<p>All that to say it wouldn&rsquo;t be a no brainer, it&rsquo;d be very interesting.  After seeing Germany, and South Sudan give USA something to think about, you gotta wonder how competitive 94&rsquo; vs 24&rsquo; really would be.</p>

      <label for="lekkbz6" class="commentText"><p>What are you talking about. People have really let this era talk get out of hand. Raw athleticism has not shifted significantly over the last few decades. We have track and field records from back then that have stood the test of time. There&rsquo;s a limit of how fast and strong the human body can be, and those guys in the 90s were towards the peak of that.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a fact that none of the centers on the team today can move like prime Robinson. It&rsquo;s a fact that curry is smaller and weaker than prime Magic Johnson. Jordan, Pippen, and Drexler are easily faster and more explosive than Lebron at 39. Booker and Tatum simply aren&rsquo;t elite for their athleticism. What are we doing here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look how 6&rsquo;2&rdquo; G-Leaguers who are winning dunk contests now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&rsquo;re saying this like Spudd Webb wasn&rsquo;t winning dunk contests back then. Creativity has improved, but a 40 inch vertical is a 40 inch vertical.</p>

Or you think 40 year old Lebron is comparable to prime jordan and drexler? Tatum and Booker aren&rsquo;t elite athletically either.</p>
