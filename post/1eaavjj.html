<p>The 2024 team will face 61. And this also doesn‚Äôt mention how the complimentary talent around those guys is also better, even if they don‚Äôt play in the NBA.</p>

<p>To be clear, I‚Äôm not saying the 2024 team would win because of this but these old heads (fans and players) just don‚Äôt seem to understand the massive difference in competition each team faced/will face</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No. 1 is these rosters are full of NBA players. So there are better players on the team and there is more talent [elsewhere]. No. 2, the fear factor does not exist because they‚Äôve competed against or with these players that they‚Äôve matched up against. They feel they belong. So as opposed to coming into the game in awe and wanting to meet people, they‚Äôre trying to come in and win that game. That‚Äôs a totally different mindset than from decades ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He‚Äôs not being dumb and this type of light trash talk is the most normal thing in the world. He‚Äôs gonna rep his iconically good team and he should. I‚Äôm more interested in if anyone on the Dream Team doesn‚Äôt think they‚Äôre the best ever.</p>

Dra≈æen at his peak was rotting on Blazers bench despite having very good numbers in limited minutes. He made all NBA instantly when he got minutes. A LOT all time great basketball players from Europe never played in the NBA. In today&rsquo;s league Dejan Bodiroga would be a perennial MVP candidate¬†</p>

And then you had everyone else&hellip; the weakest dude would have been Chris Mullin&hellip; who never missed.

<p>And then throw Lebron and Tatum and Durant and you have these supersized wings who can shoot and the 94 team is getting strangled. Lebron sees Barkley or Pippen and it‚Äôs bbq chicken.  That‚Äôs if 92 doesn‚Äôt need oxygen masks chasing shooters off the 3pt line.</p>

      <label for="lekcv3l" class="commentText"><p>I feel like the excerpt quoted doesn&rsquo;t really do justice to Chris Mullin&rsquo;s full take here. There&rsquo;s a lot of additional context to what he said but as is often the case, that all gets reduced to the one sentence that&rsquo;ll draw the most significant reaction.</p>

<p>In the full interview, he delves deeper into how things have changed in today&rsquo;s modern international climate, including the hurdles the 2024 USA team must jump that his didn&rsquo;t:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No. 1 is these rosters are full of NBA players. So there are better players on the team and there is more talent [elsewhere]. No. 2, the fear factor does not exist because they‚Äôve competed against or with these players that they‚Äôve matched up against. They feel they belong. So as opposed to coming into the game in awe and wanting to meet people, they‚Äôre trying to come in and win that game. That‚Äôs a totally different mindset than from decades ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That being said, if anyone is expecting Chris Mullin to sit back and <em>not</em> playfully talk trash about being matched up with any prospective opponents (in theory or otherwise), then you may be unfamiliar with Chris Mullin&rsquo;s game (which would make sense, since he&rsquo;s kind of old now).</p>

The Dream team rules because it was the first olympic men&rsquo;s basketball squad with the big NBA names competing. U.S.A. men&rsquo;s basketball has competed with multiple teams that clear the Dream Team since then.</p>

<p>Not that I hold it against Chris Mullin to say the Dream Team was the greatest. I expect Chris Mullin (one of the athletes most people don&rsquo;t bring up regarding the Dream Team) to defend the squad he was part of. Nothing against him.</p>

      <label for="lek98st" class="commentText"><p>Man i hate old heads who all think that literally every single fucking thing in their era was better man. Was the Dream Team more dominant? of course, no fucking shit it is, they played 9 nba players in the ENTIRE tournament. currently there is 61, some countries themselves have 9 nba players, the opponent talent they were basically facing is like separating the cities of the Canadian team. 24 USA vs Vancouver, obviously USA would win those games easily lol.</p>

<p>And the gap between 24 and 92 is not big at all. Bird was barely good enough to not be called washed, magic was basically not even playing basketball at that time. ewing and robinson are nice but i also think embiid ad bam are as good if not better than that frontcourt, especially today. 24 lebron is better than karl malone any day of the week. steph obviously clears stockton. kd clears mullin. tatum is similar levels to pippen imo, not as good defensively but better offensively. no one really compares to what charles does in 24 usa, but those players don‚Äôt really exist anymore either. and haven‚Äôt even mentioned basically any of the newer players in 24.</p>

<p>obviously nobody is as good as 92 jordan as thats his prime but theres a case that 24 usa is just better as an overall.</p>

<p>Of course, Mullin does, indeed, believe his original Dream Team is better than the current team. But Chris Mullin has <em>always</em> been the type of guy to exude that type of confidence, often with a gleam in his eye.</p>
