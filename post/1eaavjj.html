      <label for="lek4qdc" class="commentText"><p>In 1992, the Dream Team faced 9 NBA players.</p>

<p>The 2024 team will face 61. And this also doesn’t mention how the complimentary talent around those guys is also better, even if they don’t play in the NBA.</p>

<p>To be clear, I’m not saying the 2024 team would win because of this but these old heads (fans and players) just don’t seem to understand the massive difference in competition each team faced/will face</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No. 1 is these rosters are full of NBA players. So there are better players on the team and there is more talent [elsewhere]. No. 2, the fear factor does not exist because they’ve competed against or with these players that they’ve matched up against. They feel they belong. So as opposed to coming into the game in awe and wanting to meet people, they’re trying to come in and win that game. That’s a totally different mindset than from decades ago.</p>

<p>He’s not being dumb and this type of light trash talk is the most normal thing in the world. He’s gonna rep his iconically good team and he should. I’m more interested in if anyone on the Dream Team doesn’t think they’re the best ever.</p>

Most international players had no interest in the nba until later in their careers. Kukoc, Petrovic for example were prolific international players and didn’t enter the nba until 25 years of age. Sabonis was 31. That won’t happen today. Scouting is a big part of this too, doubt Jokic, or Giannis is even found pre 2000s.</p>

      <label for="leki84b" class="commentText"><p>I think the 2024 team is the first team in three decades to even be remotely comparable to dream team 1, but thats all it is, remotely comparable.</p>

<p>Like yes it was stacked with hall of famers but that actually undersells how extraordinary Dream team 1 was, because it was not just stacked with all time greats, but all time greats at or near their peaks. . Even if you just focus on Jordan/Magic/Pippen/Barkley/Robinson as a theoretical starting 5, that&rsquo;s</p>

<ul>
<li>the greatest player of all time at his absolute peak.</li>
</ul>

<p>-the greatest point guard of all time, slightly past his prime (and forced to retire early due to HIV) but still seriously great.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>one of the top 5 power forwards of all time at his absolutely peak.</p></li>

<li><p>one of the top 5 small forwards of all time approaching his absolute peak.</p></li>

<li><p>one of the top 10 centres of all time heading towards his early peak.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The idea that you were running into not just the biggest names in basketball history but, 0thwr than bird, those guys at or near their absolute peaks as players is what made dream team 1 so stupendous. The current team is extremely impressive on paper it is simply not comparable to that. Whilst LeBron and Curry are probably the only two guys who could possibly be argued to be comparable to Jordan and Magic but the difference is they are doing this when they are well past their prime whilst &lsquo;92 was probably Jordan at his absolute peak. And if you want to compare them, whilst Barkley and Durant are probably of similar stature, again, &lsquo;92 was absolute prime Barkley rather than later in his career.</p>

<p>That team would have been nuts.</p>

      <label for="lekpbk4" class="commentText"><p>Possible yeah, but he shot over 50% two times in his career and those were the first two championship years. 90-91 he was at 52% shooting, the highest he would ever go and right behind Jordan by a bit. 91-91 was very close to 93-94 with better shooting. 93-94 was pretty damn good year too, but I wouldn&rsquo;t say he was better at all.</p>

<p>His prime can for sure be debated, but both players would never shoot better than their 90-91 years, and they were also at or near their most athletic at this point in time. Some would obviously point to Jordan&rsquo;s later 80s as his most athletic, but he was fully a mature player by his first.</p>

<p>If you assess peak by how close in time they were to an mvp award, the 1992 team is just so far ahead its not funny.</p>

<p>Magic  (1990)
Jordan (1991) (1992)
Barkley (1993)
Robinson (1995)</p>

<p>Compared to</p>

<p>Lebron (2013)
Curry (2016)
Durant (2014)
Embiid (2023)</p>

<p>So of those only Embiid is arguably closer to his peak from the 2024 team.</p>

<p>And if you do it by All NBA first and second teams the difference is even more obvious. <em>Every</em> person on the 1992 all nba first team made the dream team, and 4 out of the 5 were on the all nba second team. So literally speaking the team included 9 out of the ten best players in the world at that time.</p>

<p>The current dream team consists of one current all nba first teamer (Tatum) and three all nba second team players.</p>

      <label for="lekr8jj" class="commentText"><p>All-NBA is not the greatest metric since it is based on the regular season. Barkley was good but it&rsquo;s still a mismatch vs Lebron and how do you even argue KD vs Pippen?</p>

<p>You also can&rsquo;t go by year since Steph dropped off much less in 8 years compared to Magic in like a year and a half(??).</p>

      <label for="lekxegy" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I just disagree,</p>

<p>Hell if (for no reason I can possibly see) you want to do it off finals mvps or recent trips to the finals the 1992 team is still way ahead. Even allowing for Jordan  taking all the final MVPs the dream team had the next two best performing players in the finals in 1991 (Magic, Pippen) 1992 (Drexler, Pippen) and 1993 (Barkley, Pippen)</p>

<p>The more I look at it the more convinced I am there is simply no contest, by any possible measure 1992 is a better group of players closer to their peak.</p>

<p>And by the by,  go have a look at magic stats in the 1991 playoffs and say he was dropping off. He was not great defensively but he was still an offensive superstar.</p>

      <label for="lel8ui3" class="commentText"><p>According to the (excellent) Jack Mccallum book on that 92 team, Jordan was obviously Jordan, but Barkley and Pippen were really the two  guys on that team who made it impossible to play against.</p>

<p>Barkley would just bully people out of the way and get to the ring whenever they needed two points, and the moment any opposing player looked liked getting into a rhythm Poppen would be on them and it would be game over.</p>

      <label for="lekcv3l" class="commentText"><p>I feel like the excerpt quoted doesn&rsquo;t really do justice to Chris Mullin&rsquo;s full take here. There&rsquo;s a lot of additional context to what he said but as is often the case, that all gets reduced to the one sentence that&rsquo;ll draw the most significant reaction.</p>

<p>In the full interview, he delves deeper into how things have changed in today&rsquo;s modern international climate, including the hurdles the 2024 USA team must jump that his didn&rsquo;t:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No. 1 is these rosters are full of NBA players. So there are better players on the team and there is more talent [elsewhere]. No. 2, the fear factor does not exist because they’ve competed against or with these players that they’ve matched up against. They feel they belong. So as opposed to coming into the game in awe and wanting to meet people, they’re trying to come in and win that game. That’s a totally different mindset than from decades ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That being said, if anyone is expecting Chris Mullin to sit back and <em>not</em> playfully talk trash about being matched up with any prospective opponents (in theory or otherwise), then you may be unfamiliar with Chris Mullin&rsquo;s game (which would make sense, since he&rsquo;s kind of old now).</p>

<p>And then throw Lebron and Tatum and Durant and you have these supersized wings who can shoot and the 94 team is getting strangled. Lebron sees Barkley or Pippen and it’s bbq chicken.  That’s if 92 doesn’t need oxygen masks chasing shooters off the 3pt line.</p>

      <label for="lekjaaz" class="commentText"><p>I think going big actually hurts 92. Because the strategy for 24 would be go under everything and make Jordan shoot 3s (he shot 27% that year). That becomes easier if you have Ewing and Malone on the floor.  Rotate Holiday/White/Edwards on MJ and go under everything with Tatum Lebron Durant AD Bam.</p>

<p>If I am 92 I need MJ in space attacking the rim. Give me Stockon MJ Drexler Pippin and Barkley and just play hyper aggressive spaced out small ball. But then again, Pippin Chuck and Drexler hit a combine 162 threes.  No space and now they just small.</p>

<p>We have evolved as a basketball culture.</p>

<p>And the 92 team has 2 rotation guys who were literally retired(magic and bird). Imagine thinking you can get past a usa basketball level player in retirement?</p>

<p>As a team they shot 40% from 3 in 92. They also don&rsquo;t need to screen Jordan if you&rsquo;re leaving him up top with Booker.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What are you all talking about? Magic was literally the runner up in the MVP going into the olympics. He didn&rsquo;t retire because of a decline ability. There was actually a very famous reason he retired.</p>

<p>MJ was a better athlete in every single way than Curry.  When he locked in on D, it was over.  If FVV can smother Steph, then you better believe he can neutralize Curry.  Although I think John Stockton would do just fine on Curry, he&rsquo;s got the endurance to chase him all over the court and avg 2.5-3 stl per game in his prime&hellip;.which he was in for Dream Team.</p>

<p>Pippen had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd2GgvXt3SM" target="_blank">the best season of his career</a> the year before Dream Team, he was 28 yrs old, avg 22pts, 8.7rbs, 5.6ast, 2.9stl, 0.8blk per game&hellip;.Lebron is 39&hellip;.no BBQ there buddy.  Pip was 3rd in MVP voting, 4th DPOY, All-NBA 1st and All-Def 1st team that year</p>

<p>Pippen could also guard Tatum, GL Channy.</p>

<p>Durant&rsquo;s not even playing, he might rip another achilles if he does.</p>

<p>Lebron, Malone and Robinson will be the strongest guys on the floor.  No one&rsquo;s gonna stop Malone when he gets on his spot&hellip;he&rsquo;s too strong, too wide and his shot is automatic.</p>

<p>Robinson also had a career year before Dream Team: 29.8pts, 10.7rbs, 4.8ast, 1.7stl, 3.3blk honestly can&rsquo;t see Sloppy Joe or Street Clothes stopping him in any meaningful way.  The Admiral was a beast who never took a night off.</p>

<p>All that to say it wouldn&rsquo;t be a no brainer, it&rsquo;d be very interesting.  After seeing Germany, and South Sudan give USA something to think about, you gotta wonder how competitive 94&rsquo; vs 24&rsquo; really would be.</p>

      <label for="leklvw0" class="commentText"><p>These comments are actually insane. People doubling down on &ldquo;progression of the game&rdquo; as if that changes the fact that Jordan could jump over Devin Booker, and Embiid/AD have glass knees, and are supposed to be able to run around with Robinson and prime Ewing.</p>

      <label for="lekn6x1" class="commentText"><p>Definitely. Both those centers are not up to the standard of prime Robinson and Ewing. Embiid&rsquo;s game is weaker without the flops, and Drob and Ewing certainly are not gonna take any shit for flops.</p>

<p>Literally, 92 was basically the prime for a lot of these guys, and they were massive and absurdly athletic. Most of the team were MVPs lol.</p>

<p>96 actually matches up way better. Hakeem and Shaq are added to the Jazz combo and Pippen with Barkley still there. Then add Hill and Penny in their short primes. Yeah that squad could actually pose a problem.</p>

<p>But Magic, Jordan, Pippen, Malone/Barkley/ Robinson/Ewing is absolutely a nutter combo from those years. The defense would have been nuts.</p>

      <label for="lekkbz6" class="commentText"><p>What are you talking about. People have really let this era talk get out of hand. Raw athleticism has not shifted significantly over the last few decades. We have track and field records from back then that have stood the test of time. There&rsquo;s a limit of how fast and strong the human body can be, and those guys in the 90s were towards the peak of that.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a fact that none of the centers on the team today can move like prime Robinson. It&rsquo;s a fact that curry is smaller and weaker than prime Magic Johnson. Jordan, Pippen, and Drexler are easily faster and more explosive than Lebron at 39. Booker and Tatum simply aren&rsquo;t elite for their athleticism. What are we doing here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look how 6&rsquo;2&rdquo; G-Leaguers who are winning dunk contests now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&rsquo;re saying this like Spudd Webb wasn&rsquo;t winning dunk contests back then. Creativity has improved, but a 40 inch vertical is a 40 inch vertical.</p>

<p>Ewing Malone Robinson is an excellent rotation of big guys. But Embiid AD and Bam is an excellent rotation as well.</p>

<p>92 has prime flame throwing MJ. And 24 has old Lebron. Which is the only clear advantage 94 has.</p>

      <label for="lekma6b" class="commentText"><p>This take is hilarious. Magic was coming off a runner up MVP season. Bird and KD are both injured or not playing much. Nobody on this team is even going to move prime Barkley, Robinson, or Malone lmao. Embiid is going to flop for sure, and then be guarded by an animal. Malone literally has no answer but Lebron on the other team, and Lebron right now is pretty old. If you think fucking Curry is going to get free threes off Jordan you are smoking some prime green bro.</p>

<p>Jordan couldnt guard a simple crossover by AI , and Drexler had his way with him as well just based off of pure athleticism but hes gonna somehow keep up with Curry&rsquo;s handles and counter moves?</p>

<p>Im not saying whos gonna win, but this glazing over the 90s is cringe.</p>

      <label for="lekqmv3" class="commentText"><p>Magic Johnson did not play in the <sup>1991</sup>&frasl;<sub>1992</sub> season because he got aids. What the fuck are you taking about? A year or two earlier? Sure. But cool if you thinking playing in the all star game was enough to play against guys in 2024 nba.</p>

<p>Prime Barkley was 6’4” and a bad defender who couldn’t shoot.  He wasn’t this beast. He dominated in an era where people drank beer at half time. He gives up 6 inches to Tatum. 8 to Durant. He gets played off the court.</p>

<p>Curry Durant Lebron are all the second best player in 92 by a significant margin right now. Not in their primes. Now.</p>

<p>No one on that team can check curry besides Jordan. And then he has no energy to carry those non shooters on offense. Curry is getting 12 wide open threes a game because they don’t know to get modern defense.</p>

<p>Ewing Malone and Robinson played in an era where you couldn’t double team. They would get swarmed in the post even if they could consistently score against Embiid AD and Bam. All elite defenders. But chances are they struggle through doubles because no one on 92 can shoot a lick.</p>

<p>Basketball has evolved. Get with the times Skip. Non MJ 90s hoops was shit.</p>

<p>Barkley through 91-92 had THREE YEARS ABOVE 60% eFG lmao. Unheard of basically for almost anyone but Shaq in the NBA bud. You obviously right there prove you know jack shit about the NBA.</p>

<p>Magic just got off winning the MVP and then second to Jordan in the year before HIV.</p>

<p>Malone and DRob were yet to win their MVPs. DRob is competing with Rodman, Dikembe, and Hakeem every single year for DPOY lol. Embiid, AD, and Bam are not on his level at all child.</p>

<p>Even injured Bird was shooting well at this point in his career from 3. Durant is fucking injured lol. Lebron is old. Curry is older, and he&rsquo;s also small. In a 5v5 game with the best, he&rsquo;s not getting those threes off lmao.</p>

<p>The idea that Barkley getting played off the court by these guys is the funniest shit I have ever heard in my life. He&rsquo;d win MVP for his Phoenix run, but many thought he should have beat Magic a couple years before this when he had more first place votes.</p>

<p>MUPPET LIFE lmao. You got no answers for prime Malone either.</p>

Dream Team has amazing scoring from mid-range to paint area, but modern concepts would be pulling out Robinson and Ewing to the 3 point line and forcing them to switch on Curry.</p>

      <label for="lek98st" class="commentText"><p>Man i hate old heads who all think that literally every single fucking thing in their era was better man. Was the Dream Team more dominant? of course, no fucking shit it is, they played 9 nba players in the ENTIRE tournament. currently there is 61, some countries themselves have 9 nba players, the opponent talent they were basically facing is like separating the cities of the Canadian team. 24 USA vs Vancouver, obviously USA would win those games easily lol.</p>

<p>And the gap between 24 and 92 is not big at all. Bird was barely good enough to not be called washed, magic was basically not even playing basketball at that time. ewing and robinson are nice but i also think embiid ad bam are as good if not better than that frontcourt, especially today. 24 lebron is better than karl malone any day of the week. steph obviously clears stockton. kd clears mullin. tatum is similar levels to pippen imo, not as good defensively but better offensively. no one really compares to what charles does in 24 usa, but those players don’t really exist anymore either. and haven’t even mentioned basically any of the newer players in 24.</p>

<p>obviously nobody is as good as 92 jordan as thats his prime but theres a case that 24 usa is just better as an overall.</p>

      <label for="lekawva" class="commentText"><p>This feels like this is one of those cases where the headline is a little misleading and lacks the full context of Mullin&rsquo;s interview. For instance, here&rsquo;s a little bit of what else he had to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No. 1 is these rosters are full of NBA players. So there are better players on the team and there is more talent [elsewhere]. No. 2, the fear factor does not exist because they’ve competed against or with these players that they’ve matched up against. They feel they belong. So as opposed to coming into the game in awe and wanting to meet people, they’re trying to come in and win that game. That’s a totally different mindset than from decades ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, Mullin does, indeed, believe his original Dream Team is better than the current team. But Chris Mullin has <em>always</em> been the type of guy to exude that type of confidence, often with a gleam in his eye.</p>
