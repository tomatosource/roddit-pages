So we just gotta do it again next year.”</p>

<p>With all the talk about the Celtics not being battle/tested, Tatum ended the press conference with this mic drop during media availability today.</p>

<p>1 game away from Banner 18th, but I have a feeling this squad will be hungry for more next year.</p>

<p>I’m convinced the only reason people hate on him is because he’s wearing a Celtics jersey. Even that Kobe tweet thing isn’t exactly something to <em>hate</em> a player for. Tatum doesn’t have a single “scandal” to hate on.</p>

      <label for="l8hj93h" class="commentText"><p>I think the part people get on his back about is the fact he posted it online for everyone to see. Your friend texting his dad on Father&rsquo;s Day is different than if he was going around telling everybody he does it. (I assume you only know about it because you know him well)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like those videos people post of them doing &ldquo;random&rdquo; good deeds. Then you think about it and start to question why they were recording it in the 1st place.</p>

<p>This was by design. The hope when building a roster is that you can easily win a championship. Don&rsquo;t know why people act shocked or can&rsquo;t connect the dots here.</p>

      <label for="l8hiqag" class="commentText"><p>Here’s the thing that being a Boston sports fan and witnessing the city’s remarkable success the past 20 years has taught me (I don’t want to sound like a dickhead flexing rings):</p>

<p>We’ve had teams everyone counted out do the Impossible. Teams that were the odds on favorite blow it. We’ve had incredibly clutch moments from once in a generation superstars. Litany of hall of famers. Epic Game 7 wins, heartbreaking losses. We’ve been David <em>AND</em> Goliath. Every cliche and “intangible” and circumstance and advantage/disadvantage.</p>

<p>You can think you have it all, or think you have no chance, but each circumstance has its breaking point. The best thing any team builder can do is hope that you check off every box possible. It never ceases to amaze me how in a title run there’s a play or scheme that ends up being the difference that no one saw coming. Sports are so much about having the best possible “average” and running the system hoping you come out better than the other team.</p>

<p>The 2024 Celtics team, on the precipice of a title, truly feels like they checked every box you could ask of a team. You have young and hungry guys. Seasoned vets. Stars who know they are stars and role players who know they are role players. Guys who have been there and guys who are doing it the first time. Guys who know what losing feels like. Someone who has climbed the mountain top. Defensive pride. Scoring from anyone almost anywhere. A coach with a scheme that he unwavering believes in.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that in the years I’ve watched sports, this Celtics team feels the most complete, and they are showing that on the biggest stage.</p>

      <label for="l8hkh76" class="commentText"><p>Wade was past his prime in general; his knees were giving out. But it was still a super dominant run and a very good Heat team they beat in the finals. Plus that was one of the toughest Western Conferences ever. 50-win team in the first round as the 1 seed is rough.</p>

      <label for="l8hfn1d" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I was rooting for the Wolves but in hindsight a Nuggets-Celtics matchup would’ve been more fun.  Wolves are kinda the perfect team to guard the Nuggets with their bigs, mcdaniels and naw for Murray, but Celtics would have a tougher time with Jokic at least.  Would definitely be a close series, I think I still might favor this Celtics team because I think they could shut Murray down.</p>

Athletic length on defense that can clutter the paint. 3 level scorer PG that has strength to take on holiday/brown and can quick twitch even White. Shooting from KAT would need to be on point but could easily space the floor so much and without KP, Horford would be exposed.</p>

<p>Oh and also their best player tries on defense and isn’t some traffic cone trash</p>

<p>They basically wrapped up the championship in the reg season by being awesome all year, having the ability to rest players down the stretch and roll through the playoffs unopposed, with a little bit of luck to see all the other great players get injured.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s impressive but its anti-climatic. People like the drama of a challenger. They still probably win either way, but if Cavs/Indy were healthy they probably each take an extra game or two.</p>
