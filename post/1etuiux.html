<p>You’re probably wondering why did I put their total assists on there. Well for one I like stats and two because to show how insane LeBron’s assist totals are to go along with his already prolific scoring totals. It’s up there in the Wayne Gretzky/Jerry Rice/Barry Bonds type of absurd career stats you can’t help but just be in awe of.</p>

      <label for="lig92f5" class="commentText"><p>NHL, NFL, and MLB value longevity more than NBA for whatever reason. I think its just because the numbers are high.  If you put Lebron&rsquo;s numbers and equated them to MLB&hellip;.and he was say&hellip; top 3 in hits, #1 in home runs,  #1 in WAR&hellip;he&rsquo;d be kind of unquestionably considered the best player ever.</p>

      <label for="ligqi5v" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s partially because basketball WAR is messier and noisier than baseball WAR which makes it hard to reference. Like VORP is the closest but has Stockton 3rd which doesn&rsquo;t come close to passing the sniff test in a sport where the greats have all managed to get a ring and he couldn&rsquo;t even paired with Malone (and made it to the finals fewer times in a long career than Lebron in 3). But if basketball did have a respectable equivalent to WAR, I agree it&rsquo;d be clear Lebron is insanely far ahead of the field and it&rsquo;s not even close.</p>

      <label for="lihmpmh" class="commentText"><p>Basketball just has the nastiest narrative driven dialogue about it imo due to prime First Take and other shows ESPN used to have that wouldn’t even talk about actual basketball but just spew narratives. Every other sport there’s much more nuance to greatness rather than “X has more rings than Z”. It’s always been such a lazy way to assess players. When I was a kid all I would hear about Lebron was “if he wants to be better than Jordan he needs 7 rings.” And I’d always just wonder like why? Lebron has 4 championships. 2016 being probably the most iconic championship in league history. We’re supposed to just disregard everything he’s done simply because he has 2 less championships? </p>

      <label for="lihon8q" class="commentText"><p>Part of it is because 1 dominant player in basketball can have far more impact in the outcome of a game than 1 dominant player besides a pitcher in baseball. But yes, you&rsquo;re right, basketball is by far the worst covered sport when it comes to analysis, coverage, discussions, etc. Everything is geared to denigrate and teardown newer, more advanced players in comparison to older generations. And it seems to be primarily players from the 90s that get romanticized.</p>

      <label for="liki5iv" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not really mixed at all. Jordan has a higher PER, WS/48 and BPM (offensive and defensive) in the regular season and playoffs. The widely accepted advanced stat that LeBron has over Jordan is VORP, but VORP is a cumulative stat, so the player with the most games obviously will be ahead.</p>

<p>Jordan does indeed have better traditional stats, advanced stats, more MVPs, more seasons leading the league in any statistical category, defensive accolades (DPOY and All-Defensive selections) and championships. Anyone saying that nostalgia is the only reason people have Jordan as the GOAT is completely clueless about anything related to basketball.</p>

<p>Lebron&rsquo;s 3 best WS/48 seasons are better than Jordan&rsquo;s but Jordan takes over after 4th best.</p>

<p>These are just the publicly available ones. As much as PER is a dumb as shit stat their best two seasons are equal. It&rsquo;s actually amazing that Lebron did this while passing much more.</p>

<p>Lebron was 20% more than league average TS at his peak, while Jordan capped out at 14%. Lebron blows him out in relative efficiency (and absolute efficiency is further apart of course).</p>

<p>And Lebron manages to be in the mix for best seasons ever by these advanced stats despite the fact that Lebron is getting compared to much better players than Jordan.</p>

<p>They are fighting back and forth in advanced stats. The only really consistent thing is Lebron is more efficient and passes more, and Jordan scores more.</p>

<p>Or MLB where some people would say Bonds is the GOAT, despite only getting out of the first round <em>once</em> and having no championships (of course baseball doesn&rsquo;t really have anything close to a consensus.

<p>Gretzky is the all-time leader in points while being 1st in PPG, 7th in goals per game and 1st in assists per game, he also won 8 MVPs in his first 8 seasons, comparing him to LeBron is straight up disrespectful.</p>

<p>LeBron doesn&rsquo;t have the most MVPs, he never won a crazy amount in a row and he is not the all-time leading scorer because he averaged the most points, there is literally no comparison.</p>

If LeBron had four rings, but had won 8 MVPs in a row in his first 8 years, he would be the GOAT too. Gretzky could have zero rings and he would still be the GOAT, hence why even comparing him to LeBron is disrespectful.</p>

<p>Rings is literally irrelevant and have always been for GOAT debates, even for NBA fans. Michael Jordan was universally considered the GOAT when he had 3 rings, Gretzky would&rsquo;ve been the GOAT with zero.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s IRONIC and hilarious, because it&rsquo;s a thousand times harder to stay durable in the NBA, compared to NHL, NFL and MLB</p>

<p>Most of the players in those sports only plays ONE side of the ball, and definitely not as physically enduring like Basketball.   And LeBron is a completely different player.  He been doing EVERYTHING in Basketball for 2 decades and counting.. while also running the show.  Played every position and also guarded every position on defense.  He still plays really good defense, which is just mind boggling.</p>

<p>LeBron&rsquo;s longevity and such CONSISTENT DOMINANCE is unparalleled to anything in the history of sports.   Context matter</p>

<p>Yes, i&rsquo;m sure being durable in the NBA is harder than being durable in the NFL where people are intentionally hitting you, causing shit like CTE and having the average career length be 3 years.</p>

      <label for="lih5g0c" class="commentText"><p>In those sports in general it’s also more clear that a single player can’t really carry a team to a championship, whereas in the NBA one player can sort of singularly dominate more. MLB specifically, and then in NFL a quarterback could do a substantial amount but even then they aren’t going to be able to do it alone, and in NHL it’s maybe the least true but still not to the level of basketball.</p>

<p>So with that said, for a lot of people I think LeBron’s Finals record is a hit to his legacy compared to Jordan.</p>

<p>Of course in the NBA players can’t do it alone but a single person can utterly guide a franchise. Like take LeBron or Jordan or Kareem or others off their teams and it’s just not even close to the same team.</p>

MJ shouldn&rsquo;t be rewarded for  losing earlier in playoffs, and Lebron shouldn&rsquo;t be punished for taking his teams to the finals. The best net rating team that MJ beat in finals was the 97 Jazz. They would have the 10th  highest net rating among Lebrons finals opponents. MJ played against 8 hall of famer players total in those 6 finals. Lebron faced 8 hof players (KD, Steph, Draymond, Klay) in the 17 &amp; 18 finals alone. The finals record argument contains no nuance.</p>

<p>Lebron gets punished for losing to a team that broke the freakin league and losing to the 5 time champion Spurs at age 22. The 2007 Cavs are basically her equivalent of Jordan winning a title at UNC</p>

Of course there is the pistons which were a dynasty but they kind of faded when the bulls came around. The Celtics were kind of already dead too by the time MJ&rsquo;s bulls were real contenders. Also net rating is disingenuous as it was a slower era, tho even considering eras I think lebron&rsquo;s finals opponents dwarfs any team MJ faced in the finals or even playoffs post first title.</p>

It&rsquo;s also unsurprisingly the seasons he scored the most points, tho imo Jordan was a better offensive player around 91-92 than 87-88 for example. I didn&rsquo;t really mention that era because the bulls didn&rsquo;t really dominate and frankly they didn&rsquo;t have the tools to compete with the juggernauts of Celtics pistons and bucks. 80s basketball is some of the most fun basketball ever played, honestly idk how people remember 90s so fondly, 80% of offense was extremely basic tactics or isolation. Defense was quite cool but it was ugly basketball imo and didn&rsquo;t commit as much into defense as early mid 2000s which kind of became fun in its own way.</p>

<p>I think there is an argument to be made for LeBron as the greatest ever, but I think for most the Finals record is the sealing factor for Jordan largely. If LeBron was like 8-4 or whatever it would be a very different conversation.</p>

<p>NHL, NFL, and MLB value longevity more than NBA for whatever reason.</p>

<p>From the words of the great Chuckster, I&rsquo;ve got two words to explain why, Karl Malone and John Stockton.</p>

<p>You see how gaudy the numbers of those two scumbags have due to their ridiculous longevity despite never actually being the best player in their positions during their era (Chuck was a better than the rapist, Late-career magic &amp; prime Glove were better than Stockton), and you see why volume due to longevity&rsquo;s not that valued.</p>

Has spent over 20 years ( since High school ) in the public eye, Since the advent of social media (facebook in 2003). Zero issues and he lived up to All the hype, and then some is amazing.</p>

<p>Lebrons numbers are great, can’t be matched. But to me GOAT is more than just numbers. MJ is legendary, mythical status. He was a world celebrity before the internet age. That is hard to do. Not having social media for Jordan actually helped his mythical status. His stories became god like. He still keeps a low profile, so even today when people see him they go crazy. He also grew the NBA to a world sport. It blew up in popularity because of Jordan. The pop culture + NBA resume = GOAT.</p>

      <label for="lijtzdb" class="commentText"><p>I just did a quick check but I think he can pass the regular season totals of Bron. Bron has 40k, Luka has like 11k. If he averages like 29.5 with 70 games a year, until he is 38-39, I think he passes him if my math is correct. He got 34 ppg, couple more 30-35 seasons and some 25-30 seasons should do it. But I guess he won&rsquo;t play until 40, or even 38 like Bron</p>

      <label for="liiea1v" class="commentText"><p>Wemby is almost 21 already and has put up 1522 points in his first season. He&rsquo;s nowhere close to being on pace and this is more just a &ldquo;he&rsquo;s young&rdquo; thing. Lebron put up more points in his age 19 season than Wemby did in his age 20 season on top of having a seasonal edge. Wemby is still behind Luka in pace and don&rsquo;t expect him to catch up. If Wemby plays another 20 seasons, he needs to average over 23.75 points while playing every game in order to catch up.</p>

<p>Buffett being richer than Lebron, doesn’t make Lebron any less of a billionaire.</p>

<p>Every NBA players net worth relies on basketball, once they reach a certain level of success/wealth, they stop practicing as much and training as hard.</p>

<p>LeBron is the richest (I assume) NBA player currently playing, and his dedication is higher than 99% of the league.<br>
It should be the other way round.</p>

<p>One more finals run and he’s 23rd all time.</p>

<p>If he makes it to three more finals (which I know isn’t easy) he’ll be top 10. Which puts in perspective because at that point he’d still need about 8 more to catch Bron who is still adding.</p>

      <label for="lik0xvt" class="commentText"><p>The thing about Kareem is that the 3 point line didn&rsquo;t exist until about halfway into his career. He spent his college years and prime years during the 70&rsquo;s, dominating games using the hookshot for two points at a time.</p>

<p>By the time the 3 point shot came in, his playstyle and the lakers strategies didn&rsquo;t require Kareem to add 3 point shooting to his arsenal. The guy only shot 18 3&rsquo;s in his career after the line was added to the NBA and he made 1. So his scoring record has that asterisk attached to it.</p>

<p>It made sense that eventually someone with the same longevity as Kareem would get close to his scoring record, but I seriously doubt anyone expected Lebron to smash past it in the fashion that he has done.</p>

<p>The fact that, as of yet, only Lebron has surpassed Kareem speaks volumes about how incredible and consistent both of them are. And when you consider Lebron is making his way to 50k, that&rsquo;s just absurd.</p>

<p>The only way someone surpasses Lebron is by them being the next &lsquo;king&rsquo;. They need consistent scoring, career longevity, deep runs into the playoffs every season, no big injuries etc. It took so long for Kareem to be surpassed, even with longer seasons and the 3 point line. I don&rsquo;t mean to sound ridiculous when I say this, but I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a man born from his mother who can supplant Lebron right now. They&rsquo;d have to clone his ass lmao.</p>

      <label for="lijkwsx" class="commentText"><p>Yeh I&rsquo;m thinking the same. To beat Lebron they would need perhaps a 4 point line, or even faster pace game to get more possessions to score, which will be harder on the body and decrease longevity. Also would need a complete 20 years or more at a high scoring rate. Just very difficult when factored in</p>

<p>If Kareem started at 18 and had equal opportunity at the 3 point line, I think there would still be a gap. </p>
