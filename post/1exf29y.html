<p>According to him they stopped talking for the last 4 months of the season after Jeremy pushed back on Kobe for talking disrespectfully, but at the same time Kobe was also injured the last 4 months of the season and didn&rsquo;t seem like he talked to any teammates</p>

<p>Most of the haters never even watch kobe. Its entirely a generational thing, of kids who grew up with kd, lebron and cury, looking up stats and not being able to comprehend how someone who looks like a bad shooter could possibly be in the same league as them let alone be called better than lebron for years.</p>

<p>Kobe was one of those you just had to watch to undertand</p>

It’s not a reflection of what happened in the room.</p>

<p>The accuser had friends who were reportedly willing to testify against her credibility. She had also been bragging about having a plan to have sex with Eminem and trap him.</p>

<p>DNA evidence showed she had sexual contact with a bunch of other people shortly after the alleged assault</p>

<p>There was also inconsistencies in her story and she blatantly lied too and admitted it.</p>

The voters have been seduced by his remarkable athleticism and spectacular steals, but he hasn’t played sound, fundamental defense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mesmerized by the ball, he’s gambled too frequently, putting us out of position, forcing rotations that leave a man wide open, and doesn’t keep his feet on the ground.”</p>

<p>Jackson said this in his book “The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul.”</p>

      <label for="lj5lea4" class="commentText"><p>It tracks, I mean Kobe’s best defensive years were right before his offensive primacy took off, 00-01/02 were really good, maybe even underrated in recent years, as a PoA/wing defender.</p>

<p>Kobe always played his best defense during championship contention years, like 08-10 wasn’t bad either, lost a step athletically, but he developed in reading offenses, being sharper on rotations, and directing people on defense to make up for it.</p>

<p>Also, the book says he’s overrated certainly, but not that he’s bad.</p>

      <label for="lj5murb" class="commentText"><p>Good summary. When players pick up heavier offensive loads, their defense almost always becomes worse/is a lower priority. Kawhi carried this reputation as a DPOY/elite defensive player for many years when he already took a big step down on defense.  Kawhi post 2019, became a better offensive player and passer but is significantly worse on defense and has lost a lot of athleticism. LeBron also became a worse defender when he improved offensively, although he and Kawhi are still capable of turning it on in stretches on defense. Giannis is another player who is still good defensively, but because of his larger offensive load, he is not quite what he was at his 2018-2021 defensive peak. </p>

I’m not saying those statements aren’t true, but I think you get these very candid statements because he was angry and didn’t feel the need to mince words since he was no longer working with the team.</p>

<p>The fact that he ended up coming back to the team less than 2 years later and he and Kobe rebuilt their relationship is kind of crazy given just how much shit they talked in that last year.</p>

<p>If you google Zach Lowe Kobe defense, you find a grant land article he wrote criticizing Kobe’s defense in 2013.</p>

<p>“If Bryant makes first or second-team All-Defense again this season, I’m officially ignoring this honor indefinitely when it comes to assessing a player’s status and career accomplishments. There will be no more “Player X has seven first-team All-Defense appearances” in this space as a way of justifying a man’s place in the NBA hierarchy.</p>

<p>Bryant isn’t the first player coasting to undeserved All-Defense appearances based on reputation, but if he makes it again this season, it will be his most egregious appearance ever, and one of the most egregious in league history.”</p>

<p>From like 2011 or 12 onward he was really bad as an off-ball defender, but even in 2013 he was good enough on-ball to be the primary defender on PG’s. He wasn’t All-NBA level in the 2010’s (his last two selections were a joke) but he was good when he tried.</p>

      <label for="lj7a9n6" class="commentText"><p>Playing defense in a way that doesn&rsquo;t hang your teammates out to dry is important. I was reading a blog from a (edit: former Sixers scout, it wasn&rsquo;t an active Sixers scout shitting on him just for clarity, it was more of a postmortem of his time on the team) Sixers scout on Tobias Harris&rsquo; departure and he was talking about how Tobias Harris was the least instinctive defender he&rsquo;s ever watched who constantly messed up rotations and had no feel for backdoor cuts, etc.</p>

<p>Tobias Harris is like the archetype for a player who has an NBA body and athleticism, can shoot the ball, but has absolutely no feel for the game.</p>

<p>He also called him the worst entry passer he&rsquo;d ever seen, which vibes. The 5 second staredown of Jo in the post followed by the softest lollipop pass that&rsquo;s easily stolen by the help defender was prime Tobias.</p>

      <label for="lj7gnra" class="commentText"><p>you did not watch him from 05-10 then if you&rsquo;re calling Kobe a lockdown defender in that time. He dropped off massively from the early 2000s having to carry the offense. He wasn&rsquo;t a cone, but he wasn&rsquo;t lockdown nor did he deserve those first team all-defensive honors.</p>

<p>He only locked down for clutch possessions or picking optimal times to lock someone down, or if it was personal in some way. This was especially more true after 2010, he was coasting on defense like Lebron is known for it nowadays</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s almost as egregious as him getting nominated for all-star selections in the last 3 years of his career, guy was NOWHERE near all-star level after his achilles tear</p>

<p>He became a part time defender when Shaq left (still able to lock up guys in 4th quarters but wasn&rsquo;t consistent at all), he basically never ever guarded opposing stars when Ariza emerged and then when they got Artest and then Barnes. Which is FINE at the age he was, but what wasn&rsquo;t fine was he kept getting all defensive team award over guys like Sefolosha who were CLEARLY better those years.</p>

<p>He was complete defensive liability post injury, which again is totally fine at that age.</p>

      <label for="lj6c3nu" class="commentText"><p>TBH getting paid 100k/week to do defensive drills for 50 minutes a day sounds like a dream job.</p>

<p>Nowadays the average nba salary is closer to 200k/week.</p>

      <label for="lj6j0f6" class="commentText"><p>This is what NBA general managers believed in 2011 about the league and Kobe. They pretty much thought he was the best perimeter defender, and that&rsquo;s arguably not at his defensive prime, it&rsquo;s probably an opinion from the most credible people for that job and not a random internet or media casual <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/nba-gm-survey-2010-11" target="_blank">NBA GM Survey: 2010-11 edition | NBA.com</a></p>

      <label for="lj6ljs2" class="commentText"><p>Lot of press for a decade old Laker team that won 21 games. Kobe was a 1-man Human Tank job his last 3 honorary all-star seasons and this one where he jacked up 20 shots per night shooting 37% from the field and 29% from three was definitely one of them.</p>
