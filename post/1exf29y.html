<p>According to him they stopped talking for the last 4 months of the season after Jeremy pushed back on Kobe for talking disrespectfully, but at the same time Kobe was also injured the last 4 months of the season and didn&rsquo;t seem like he talked to any teammates</p>

Kobe was a 1-man Human Tank job his last 3 honorary all-star seasons and this one where he jacked up 20 shots per night shooting 37% from the field and 29% from three was definitely one of them.</p>

<p>Most of the haters never even watch kobe. Its entirely a generational thing, of kids who grew up with kd, lebron and cury, looking up stats and not being able to comprehend how someone who looks like a bad shooter could possibly be in the same league as them let alone be called better than lebron for years.</p>

<p>Kobe was one of those you just had to watch to undertand</p>

It’s not a reflection of what happened in the room.</p>

<p>The accuser had friends who were reportedly willing to testify against her credibility. She had also been bragging about having a plan to have sex with Eminem and trap him.</p>

<p>DNA evidence showed she had sexual contact with a bunch of other people shortly after the alleged assault</p>

<p>There was also inconsistencies in her story and she blatantly lied too and admitted it.</p>

The voters have been seduced by his remarkable athleticism and spectacular steals, but he hasn’t played sound, fundamental defense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mesmerized by the ball, he’s gambled too frequently, putting us out of position, forcing rotations that leave a man wide open, and doesn’t keep his feet on the ground.”</p>

<p>Jackson said this in his book “The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul.”</p>

      <label for="lj5lea4" class="commentText"><p>It tracks, I mean Kobe’s best defensive years were right before his offensive primacy took off, 00-01/02 were really good, maybe even underrated in recent years, as a PoA/wing defender.</p>

<p>Kobe always played his best defense during championship contention years, like 08-10 wasn’t bad either, lost a step athletically, but he developed in reading offenses, being sharper on rotations, and directing people on defense to make up for it.</p>

<p>Also, the book says he’s overrated certainly, but not that he’s bad.</p>

      <label for="lj5murb" class="commentText"><p>Good summary. When players pick up heavier offensive loads, their defense almost always becomes worse/is a lower priority. Kawhi carried this reputation as a DPOY/elite defensive player for many years when he already took a big step down on defense.  Kawhi post 2019, became a better offensive player and passer but is significantly worse on defense and has lost a lot of athleticism. LeBron also became a worse defender when he improved offensively, although he and Kawhi are still capable of turning it on in stretches on defense. Giannis is another player who is still good defensively, but because of his larger offensive load, he is not quite what he was at his 2018-2021 defensive peak. </p>

      <label for="lj6ohor" class="commentText"><p>It’s not that wild of a take. In 2018, I remember listening to Zach Lowe randomly mention that Kobe made his last few all defensive teams off of rep instead of actual defensive ability.</p>

<p>If you google Zach Lowe Kobe defense, you find a grant land article he wrote criticizing Kobe’s defense in 2013.</p>

<p>“If Bryant makes first or second-team All-Defense again this season, I’m officially ignoring this honor indefinitely when it comes to assessing a player’s status and career accomplishments. There will be no more “Player X has seven first-team All-Defense appearances” in this space as a way of justifying a man’s place in the NBA hierarchy.</p>

<p>Bryant isn’t the first player coasting to undeserved All-Defense appearances based on reputation, but if he makes it again this season, it will be his most egregious appearance ever, and one of the most egregious in league history.”</p>

      <label for="lj6cvjf" class="commentText"><p>He wasn&rsquo;t a fraud defender, he peaked as one of the best perimeter defender of all time, his longevity as a defender was what was grossly overrated.</p>

<p>He became a part time defender when Shaq left (still able to lock up guys in 4th quarters but wasn&rsquo;t consistent at all), he basically never ever guarded opposing stars when Ariza emerged and then when they got Artest and then Barnes. Which is FINE at the age he was, but what wasn&rsquo;t fine was he kept getting all defensive team award over guys like Sefolosha who were CLEARLY better those years.</p>

<p>He was complete defensive liability post injury, which again is totally fine at that age.</p>

Pseudo big man D) who were levels above , and if you mean guards Gary Payton , Tony Allen , even guys like Marcus smart /Jrue peaked higher, I’d put mj over him too even tho I don’t think mj it s a goat tier perimeter defender.</p>

Gary Payton talked about how players nowadays don&rsquo;t ask for help. Like they are too good to ask. He brought up how Kobe asked him how to play better defense, and Payton showed him. Then he started making first team al ldefense for years.</p>

They pretty much thought he was the best perimeter defender, and that&rsquo;s arguably not at his defensive prime, it&rsquo;s probably an opinion from the most credible people for that job and not a random internet or media casual <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/nba-gm-survey-2010-11" target="_blank">NBA GM Survey: 2010-11 edition | NBA.com</a></p>

      <label for="lj6ljs2" class="commentText"><p>Lot of press for a decade old Laker team that won 21 games. Kobe was a 1-man Human Tank job his last 3 honorary all-star seasons and this one where he jacked up 20 shots per night shooting 37% from the field and 29% from three was definitely one of them.</p>
