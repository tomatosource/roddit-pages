      <label for="lj5vowx" class="commentText"><p>From JLin&rsquo;s account he seemed like one of the teammates Kobe actually liked more that season in that they stayed up all night talking about the games.</p>

<p>According to him they stopped talking for the last 4 months of the season after Jeremy pushed back on Kobe for talking disrespectfully, but at the same time Kobe was also injured the last 4 months of the season and didn&rsquo;t seem like he talked to any teammates</p>

      <label for="lj7l1zq" class="commentText"><p>I see so much similarity between this and playing for my rugby team. There were people on the team who were really good, and they used to go hard in practice, and the only way to earn their respect was to push them hard and get them mad. When they realized you were there to make the team better, and you were gonna fight for a spot on the roster they welcomed you.</p>

<p>you gotta guard the shield, not everyone is worthy to wear it.</p>

      <label for="lj983on" class="commentText"><p>Yeah that&rsquo;s one strategy, but not the only way to success. When I joined my college rugby team, it was a similar style of leadership. We went back and forth between bad and decent in my early seasons. As my generation came into leadership, we had a much different approach. More encouraging, getting young guys with potential involved quickly. Less hardass seniors.</p>

<p>My last season we started obliterating people and got nationally ranked in DII. The winning culture continued and they made it to the championship game the year after I graduated, with some freshmen taking on big roles.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying the tough love leadership style doesn&rsquo;t work with the right people, but it&rsquo;s definitely not the only way to be successful.</p>

I&rsquo;m sure Kobe have done way worse shit to teammates throughout the years that deserves criticism but that video alone was nothing. Soft ass sub.</p>

      <label for="lj8nuy7" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s because almost no one on this sub actually played basketball at a competitive level (like junior high/high school team level).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;nice&rdquo; environment that redditors would approve of. It&rsquo;s a lot of coaches yelling at you, punishing you with wind sprints, etc. Sometimes you get into it with teammates at practice and talk shit, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you hate each other. So many times did I see teammates going at each other like they wanted to fight, only to be chummy the second practice ends.</p>

<p>I think you can definitely argue that a lot of that stuff is toxic, but that&rsquo;s just how it is in competitive sports.</p>

Yes he was successful and was respected by his team and some of them liked him, but he also mentally abused many of his teammates and exacerbated rifts and hurt team chemistry at times. We don‚Äôt need to hold back criticism bc he is dead. He did what he did while alive and had the chance to give his side of the story while alive but even he knew he was a dick</p>

<p>I think Houston&rsquo;s model said he should have been drafted at like 15th, and honestly that draft overall was fairly weak so in hindsight might have been better to even draft him higher than that</p>

      <label for="lj7m4rh" class="commentText"><p>He was such a celebrity in the early 2010s. Linsanity was the most impactful one month stretch I‚Äôve ever seen for a player‚Äôs career. The fact that he was on the Knicks, popping off, hitting game-winners, and one of the very few Asian players to make the NBA, made him almost as much of a household name as Melo or KD at least in NY. He also was on YouTube stuff and spreading his brand.</p>

<p>Then he helped his image further by being on the Lakers with Kobe as a starting PG. Lin maximized the hell out of his NBA career which was overall not really anything too special (as far as NBA careers go).</p>

<p>¬†&rdquo;During the July 2003 interview with investigators, Bryant initially told investigators that he did not have sexual intercourse with his accuser, a 19-year-old woman who worked at the hotel where Bryant was staying. When the officers told Bryant that she had taken an exam that yielded physical evidence, such as semen, Bryant admitted to having sexual intercourse with her, but stated that the sex was consensual.¬†When asked about bruises on the accuser&rsquo;s neck, Bryant admitted to &ldquo;strangling&rdquo; her during the encounter, stating that he held her &ldquo;from the back&rdquo; &ldquo;around her neck&rdquo;, that strangling during sex was his &ldquo;thing&rdquo; and that he had a pattern of strangling a different sex partner (not his wife) during their recurring sexual encounters. When asked how hard he was holding onto her neck, Bryant stated, &ldquo;My hands are strong. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Bryant stated that he assumed consent for sex because of the accuser&rsquo;s body language.&ldquo;¬†</p>

Everyone who is in an NBA forum knows that Kobe Bryant was accused of rape. Yet we can&rsquo;t have a single discussion about his basketball skills without someone making a comment about his rape case. News flash: repeating that Kobe Bryant is a rapist is doing nothing for any rape victims. Most people here just want to talk about basketball, there are rapists in the league and a dozen domestic abusers. Some people associated with this league are or have been shit people. This isn&rsquo;t a ethics subreddit, no one gives a shit</p>

The voters have been seduced by his remarkable athleticism and spectacular steals, but he hasn‚Äôt played sound, fundamental defense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mesmerized by the ball, he‚Äôs gambled too frequently, putting us out of position, forcing rotations that leave a man wide open, and doesn‚Äôt keep his feet on the ground.‚Äù</p>

<p>Jackson said this in his book ‚ÄúThe Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul.‚Äù</p>

<p>Kobe always played his best defense during championship contention years, like 08-10 wasn‚Äôt bad either, lost a step athletically, but he developed in reading offenses, being sharper on rotations, and directing people on defense to make up for it.</p>

<p>Also, the book says he‚Äôs overrated certainly, but not that he‚Äôs bad.</p>

      <label for="lj5murb" class="commentText"><p>Good summary. When players pick up heavier offensive loads, their defense almost always becomes worse/is a lower priority. Kawhi carried this reputation as a DPOY/elite defensive player for many years when he already took a big step down on defense.¬† Kawhi post 2019, became a better offensive player and passer but is significantly worse on defense and has lost a lot of athleticism. LeBron also became a worse defender when he improved offensively, although he and Kawhi are still capable of turning it on in stretches on defense. Giannis is another player who is still good defensively, but because of his larger offensive load, he is not quite what he was at his 2018-2021 defensive peak.¬†</p>

      <label for="lj7vy9v" class="commentText"><p>LeBron‚Äôs peak offensive years were his 2nd stint Cavs years imo, where was notably worse on defense ¬†He became even more skilled and refined with superior footwork after he left Miami.</p>

<p>¬†He was at his best at the rim in Miami and while he did shoot 40% one year from 3, it was a on lower volume at 3 attempts a game.¬†</p>

<p>¬†LeBron‚Äôs always been a great passer, but he took it up another level as a passer in his 2nd stint Cavs day. He also was otherworldly in the playoffs on offense. Entire playoff run of 34/9/9 in 2018 while having mastery of the mid range, post, shooting, driving, and passing.¬†</p>

      <label for="lj7yh4h" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I could see that. But at the same time, he was averaging crazy numbers in his first Cleveland stint in the hardest era to score. Efficient 30+ ppg in 2005-06 I believe? No one else was doing that back then besides Kobe who wasn‚Äôt close to his efficiency.</p>

<p>I do think second Cavs stint Lebron may have been the best shooter of his career overall though, and was probably his most versatile scoring version. His whole career really is just one long prime.</p>

      <label for="lj9n1m2" class="commentText"><p>Yup agreed. 2016-2018 was peak LeBron offensively. People really underestimate the improvement in passing and post play, LeBron&rsquo;s offensive play in that era can only be described as complete mastery. 2013 was more LeBron&rsquo;s defensive and athletic prime.</p>

      <label for="lj7mnvu" class="commentText"><p>Kobe haters will take this as a damnation, but if anything it was more Kobe had fallen from his peak defensive form when balancing his offensive load. Frobe was a legitimate All NBA defensive guard and a perennial DPOY candidate. 02-06 Kobe was struggling a bit with his aging body and the balancing of the work load. A lot of what Phil highlights is Kobe trying to overcompensate on D to make something happen quicker. Kobe in his latter campaigns with Pau was a better albeit different defender. This is where I think Kobe was a bit overrated, he had his Frobe moments, but he wasn&rsquo;t that lockdown defender every possession anymore. I do think his team defense was much better then, but there it was a bit of the reputation effect. However he was still definitely a plus defender and I&rsquo;d argue he should have been fringe defensive teams and not a lock for the first team.</p>

I‚Äôm not saying those statements aren‚Äôt true, but I think you get these very candid statements because he was angry and didn‚Äôt feel the need to mince words since he was no longer working with the team.</p>

<p>The fact that he ended up coming back to the team less than 2 years later and he and Kobe rebuilt their relationship is kind of crazy given just how much shit they talked in that last year.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIf Bryant makes first or second-team All-Defense again this season, I‚Äôm officially ignoring this honor indefinitely when it comes to assessing a player‚Äôs status and career accomplishments.

<p>Bryant isn‚Äôt the first player coasting to undeserved All-Defense appearances based on reputation, but if he makes it again this season, it will be his most egregious appearance ever, and one of the most egregious in league history.‚Äù</p>

I was reading a blog from a (edit: former Sixers scout, it wasn&rsquo;t an active Sixers scout shitting on him just for clarity, it was more of a postmortem of his time on the team) Sixers scout on Tobias Harris&rsquo; departure and he was talking about how Tobias Harris was the least instinctive defender he&rsquo;s ever watched who constantly messed up rotations and had no feel for backdoor cuts, etc.</p>

<p>Tobias Harris is like the archetype for a player who has an NBA body and athleticism, can shoot the ball, but has absolutely no feel for the game.</p>

<p>He also called him the worst entry passer he&rsquo;d ever seen, which vibes. The 5 second staredown of Jo in the post followed by the softest lollipop pass that&rsquo;s easily stolen by the help defender was prime Tobias.</p>

      <label for="lj7gnra" class="commentText"><p>you did not watch him from 05-10 then if you&rsquo;re calling Kobe a lockdown defender in that time. He dropped off massively from the early 2000s having to carry the offense. He wasn&rsquo;t a cone, but he wasn&rsquo;t lockdown nor did he deserve those first team all-defensive honors.</p>

<p>He only locked down for clutch possessions or picking optimal times to lock someone down, or if it was personal in some way. This was especially more true after 2010, he was coasting on defense like Lebron is known for it nowadays</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s almost as egregious as him getting nominated for all-star selections in the last 3 years of his career, guy was NOWHERE near all-star level after his achilles tear</p>

<p>He became a part time defender when Shaq left (still able to lock up guys in 4th quarters but wasn&rsquo;t consistent at all), he basically never ever guarded opposing stars when Ariza emerged and then when they got Artest and then Barnes. Which is FINE at the age he was, but what wasn&rsquo;t fine was he kept getting all defensive team award over guys like Sefolosha who were CLEARLY better those years.</p>

<p>He was complete defensive liability post injury, which again is totally fine at that age.</p>

<p>NBA coaches vote on All-Defense because they would know better than anyone. The media likes flashy steals and blocks, but fans and media never remember the players who truly locked down on defense even without shiny numbers to show for it. People argue for LeBron DOPY and then show his chase down block on Iggy as evidence, ‚Äúhow has this guy never won it?!‚Äù Yeah, leave this one to the coaches. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

<p>Yes, I‚Äôll trust them. Is that even a question? Kobe is 12x All-Defense, come to terms with that.</p>

But you can‚Äôt make a strong case for Artest over Kobe in any of those All-Defensive Teams, Kobe was playing extremely well on the defensive end in those years and deserved the awards. He fell to 2nd Team in 2012, and continued to fall from there. As he should.</p>

      <label for="ljbtxoi" class="commentText"><p>look at some of these votes jesus</p>

<p>the LeBron hate boner was raging in full force, how could Miami not have decisively been voted the team most improved during the off season of the heatles being formed?</p>

      <label for="ljccr43" class="commentText"><p>I understand GM‚Äôs being mad at the Heat or LeBron, but that in my opinion doesn‚Äôt intersect with Kobe being voted among leagues best perimeter defenders, assuming they would be voting for LeBron, Kobe would still be voted second it‚Äôs not a situation which is either one or the other. It‚Äôs NBA general managers in the end and not a random fan, they might have been biased but the same argument can be said about Phil or whoever else.</p>

<p>The Heat were a top heavy team, their depth wasn‚Äôt great especially in their first year together, it‚Äôs not crazy to have doubts how it work with all of them together, it‚Äôs not uncommon with top heavy teams even recently with players at their prime not working, even the Heat didn‚Äôt win instantly, they should all get credit for making it work in the end because they all played their roles well which were somewhat different to what they were used to.</p>

      <label for="lj8eti5" class="commentText"><p>The Jeremy Lin situation will always be interesting to me. Being paired up with Carmelo Anthony, James Harden, and Kobe Bryant has got to be the absolute worst run of luck for his skillset. Literally having to play next to the 3 most ball-dominant, ego-centric players, while also being one of the only asians in the league is crazy.</p>

      <label for="lj7i3p4" class="commentText"><p>Let sleeping dogs lie. Kobe became worse on defence as time went on but he would bring it if you went after him. The only person that really went at Kobe and got the better of him was Gilbert Arenas. Pierce also did but I always thought Kobe did a good job there.</p>

<p>Kobe was absolutely capable when the spotlight shined on him. You aren&rsquo;t going to see massive defensive lowlights in the playoffs like how people target Harden, Gobert, Embiid etc. That being said, Kobe&rsquo;s on a different level. Kobe simply faltered as his body could no longer keep up.</p>
