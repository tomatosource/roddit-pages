<p>According to him they stopped talking for the last 4 months of the season after Jeremy pushed back on Kobe for talking disrespectfully, but at the same time Kobe was also injured the last 4 months of the season and didn&rsquo;t seem like he talked to any teammates</p>

      <label for="lj7l1zq" class="commentText"><p>I see so much similarity between this and playing for my rugby team. There were people on the team who were really good, and they used to go hard in practice, and the only way to earn their respect was to push them hard and get them mad. When they realized you were there to make the team better, and you were gonna fight for a spot on the roster they welcomed you.</p>

<p>you gotta guard the shield, not everyone is worthy to wear it.</p>

      <label for="lj8nuy7" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s because almost no one on this sub actually played basketball at a competitive level (like junior high/high school team level).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;nice&rdquo; environment that redditors would approve of. It&rsquo;s a lot of coaches yelling at you, punishing you with wind sprints, etc. Sometimes you get into it with teammates at practice and talk shit, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you hate each other. So many times did I see teammates going at each other like they wanted to fight, only to be chummy the second practice ends.</p>

<p>I think you can definitely argue that a lot of that stuff is toxic, but that&rsquo;s just how it is in competitive sports.</p>

      <label for="lj8dbty" class="commentText"><p>Kobe being a dick is a very consistent story throughout his career from his teammates and coaches. Yes he was successful and was respected by his team and some of them liked him, but he also mentally abused many of his teammates and exacerbated rifts and hurt team chemistry at times. We don‚Äôt need to hold back criticism bc he is dead. He did what he did while alive and had the chance to give his side of the story while alive but even he knew he was a dick</p>

      <label for="lj7pyv3" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s also one of the reasons people started buying more heavily into advanced statistics, I think it was Daryl Morey who was talking about how at the time they didn&rsquo;t really use the advanced statistics we use now when evaluating player talent, and when their model said draft Jeremy Lin he&rsquo;s going to be really good they assumed their model was wrong  because they trusted their eyes and their inherent biases ended up greatly influencing their decisions.</p>

<p>I think Houston&rsquo;s model said he should have been drafted at like 15th, and honestly that draft overall was fairly weak so in hindsight might have been better to even draft him higher than that</p>

The fact that he was on the Knicks, popping off, hitting game-winners, and one of the very few Asian players to make the NBA, made him almost as much of a household name as Melo or KD at least in NY. He also was on YouTube stuff and spreading his brand.</p>

<p>Then he helped his image further by being on the Lakers with Kobe as a starting PG. Lin maximized the hell out of his NBA career which was overall not really anything too special (as far as NBA careers go).</p>

      <label for="lj6g0q3" class="commentText"><p>At this point its not that at all.</p>

<p>Most of the haters never even watch kobe. Its entirely a generational thing, of kids who grew up with kd, lebron and cury, looking up stats and not being able to comprehend how someone who looks like a bad shooter could possibly be in the same league as them let alone be called better than lebron for years.</p>

<p>Kobe was one of those you just had to watch to undertand</p>

      <label for="lj7j4kj" class="commentText"><p>I mean, that and the rape</p>

<p>¬†&rdquo;During the July 2003 interview with investigators, Bryant initially told investigators that he did not have sexual intercourse with his accuser, a 19-year-old woman who worked at the hotel where Bryant was staying. When the officers told Bryant that she had taken an exam that yielded physical evidence, such as semen, Bryant admitted to having sexual intercourse with her, but stated that the sex was consensual.¬†When asked about bruises on the accuser&rsquo;s neck, Bryant admitted to &ldquo;strangling&rdquo; her during the encounter, stating that he held her &ldquo;from the back&rdquo; &ldquo;around her neck&rdquo;, that strangling during sex was his &ldquo;thing&rdquo; and that he had a pattern of strangling a different sex partner (not his wife) during their recurring sexual encounters. When asked how hard he was holding onto her neck, Bryant stated, &ldquo;My hands are strong. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Bryant stated that he assumed consent for sex because of the accuser&rsquo;s body language.&ldquo;¬†</p>

<p>¬†Fucking weird ass Kobe rape apologists. You motherfuckers would&rsquo;ve cheered that shit on if it was your sister/daughter/mother/girlfriend</p>

      <label for="lj7t25t" class="commentText"><p>People consistently bringing up Kobe&rsquo;s rape cause in r/NBA doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me. Everyone who is in an NBA forum knows that Kobe Bryant was accused of rape. Yet we can&rsquo;t have a single discussion about his basketball skills without someone making a comment about his rape case. News flash: repeating that Kobe Bryant is a rapist is doing nothing for any rape victims. Most people here just want to talk about basketball, there are rapists in the league and a dozen domestic abusers. Some people associated with this league are or have been shit people. This isn&rsquo;t a ethics subreddit, no one gives a shit</p>

It‚Äôs not a reflection of what happened in the room.</p>

<p>The accuser had friends who were reportedly willing to testify against her credibility. She had also been bragging about having a plan to have sex with Eminem and trap him.</p>

<p>DNA evidence showed she had sexual contact with a bunch of other people shortly after the alleged assault</p>

<p>There was also inconsistencies in her story and she blatantly lied too and admitted it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mesmerized by the ball, he‚Äôs gambled too frequently, putting us out of position, forcing rotations that leave a man wide open, and doesn‚Äôt keep his feet on the ground.‚Äù</p>

<p>Kobe always played his best defense during championship contention years, like 08-10 wasn‚Äôt bad either, lost a step athletically, but he developed in reading offenses, being sharper on rotations, and directing people on defense to make up for it.</p>

<p>Also, the book says he‚Äôs overrated certainly, but not that he‚Äôs bad.</p>

      <label for="lj5murb" class="commentText"><p>Good summary. When players pick up heavier offensive loads, their defense almost always becomes worse/is a lower priority. Kawhi carried this reputation as a DPOY/elite defensive player for many years when he already took a big step down on defense.¬† Kawhi post 2019, became a better offensive player and passer but is significantly worse on defense and has lost a lot of athleticism. LeBron also became a worse defender when he improved offensively, although he and Kawhi are still capable of turning it on in stretches on defense. Giannis is another player who is still good defensively, but because of his larger offensive load, he is not quite what he was at his 2018-2021 defensive peak.¬†</p>

<p>¬†LeBron‚Äôs always been a great passer, but he took it up another level as a passer in his 2nd stint Cavs day. He also was otherworldly in the playoffs on offense. Entire playoff run of 34/9/9 in 2018 while having mastery of the mid range, post, shooting, driving, and passing.¬†</p>

      <label for="lj7yh4h" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I could see that. But at the same time, he was averaging crazy numbers in his first Cleveland stint in the hardest era to score. Efficient 30+ ppg in 2005-06 I believe? No one else was doing that back then besides Kobe who wasn‚Äôt close to his efficiency.</p>

<p>I do think second Cavs stint Lebron may have been the best shooter of his career overall though, and was probably his most versatile scoring version. His whole career really is just one long prime.</p>

      <label for="lj7mnvu" class="commentText"><p>Kobe haters will take this as a damnation, but if anything it was more Kobe had fallen from his peak defensive form when balancing his offensive load. Frobe was a legitimate All NBA defensive guard and a perennial DPOY candidate. 02-06 Kobe was struggling a bit with his aging body and the balancing of the work load. A lot of what Phil highlights is Kobe trying to overcompensate on D to make something happen quicker. Kobe in his latter campaigns with Pau was a better albeit different defender. This is where I think Kobe was a bit overrated, he had his Frobe moments, but he wasn&rsquo;t that lockdown defender every possession anymore. I do think his team defense was much better then, but there it was a bit of the reputation effect. However he was still definitely a plus defender and I&rsquo;d argue he should have been fringe defensive teams and not a lock for the first team.</p>

I‚Äôm not saying those statements aren‚Äôt true, but I think you get these very candid statements because he was angry and didn‚Äôt feel the need to mince words since he was no longer working with the team.</p>

<p>The fact that he ended up coming back to the team less than 2 years later and he and Kobe rebuilt their relationship is kind of crazy given just how much shit they talked in that last year.</p>

<p>If you wanted to prove Phil&rsquo;s point you have to find wing defenders who were <em>definitively</em> better than Kobe in his prime.</p>

<p>If you google Zach Lowe Kobe defense, you find a grant land article he wrote criticizing Kobe‚Äôs defense in 2013.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIf Bryant makes first or second-team All-Defense again this season, I‚Äôm officially ignoring this honor indefinitely when it comes to assessing a player‚Äôs status and career accomplishments. There will be no more ‚ÄúPlayer X has seven first-team All-Defense appearances‚Äù in this space as a way of justifying a man‚Äôs place in the NBA hierarchy.</p>

<p>Bryant isn‚Äôt the first player coasting to undeserved All-Defense appearances based on reputation, but if he makes it again this season, it will be his most egregious appearance ever, and one of the most egregious in league history.‚Äù</p>

<p>From like 2011 or 12 onward he was really bad as an off-ball defender, but even in 2013 he was good enough on-ball to be the primary defender on PG‚Äôs. He wasn‚Äôt All-NBA level in the 2010‚Äôs (his last two selections were a joke) but he was good when he tried.</p>

I was reading a blog from a (edit: former Sixers scout, it wasn&rsquo;t an active Sixers scout shitting on him just for clarity, it was more of a postmortem of his time on the team) Sixers scout on Tobias Harris&rsquo; departure and he was talking about how Tobias Harris was the least instinctive defender he&rsquo;s ever watched who constantly messed up rotations and had no feel for backdoor cuts, etc.</p>

<p>Tobias Harris is like the archetype for a player who has an NBA body and athleticism, can shoot the ball, but has absolutely no feel for the game.</p>

<p>He also called him the worst entry passer he&rsquo;d ever seen, which vibes. The 5 second staredown of Jo in the post followed by the softest lollipop pass that&rsquo;s easily stolen by the help defender was prime Tobias.</p>

He dropped off massively from the early 2000s having to carry the offense. He wasn&rsquo;t a cone, but he wasn&rsquo;t lockdown nor did he deserve those first team all-defensive honors.</p>

<p>He only locked down for clutch possessions or picking optimal times to lock someone down, or if it was personal in some way. This was especially more true after 2010, he was coasting on defense like Lebron is known for it nowadays</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s almost as egregious as him getting nominated for all-star selections in the last 3 years of his career, guy was NOWHERE near all-star level after his achilles tear</p>

      <label for="lj6cvjf" class="commentText"><p>He wasn&rsquo;t a fraud defender, he peaked as one of the best perimeter defender of all time, his longevity as a defender was what was grossly overrated.</p>

<p>He became a part time defender when Shaq left (still able to lock up guys in 4th quarters but wasn&rsquo;t consistent at all), he basically never ever guarded opposing stars when Ariza emerged and then when they got Artest and then Barnes. Which is FINE at the age he was, but what wasn&rsquo;t fine was he kept getting all defensive team award over guys like Sefolosha who were CLEARLY better those years.</p>

<p>He was complete defensive liability post injury, which again is totally fine at that age.</p>

The only person that really went at Kobe and got the better of him was Gilbert Arenas. Pierce also did but I always thought Kobe did a good job there.</p>

<p>Kobe was absolutely capable when the spotlight shined on him. You aren&rsquo;t going to see massive defensive lowlights in the playoffs like how people target Harden, Gobert, Embiid etc. That being said, Kobe&rsquo;s on a different level. Kobe simply faltered as his body could no longer keep up.</p>

      <label for="lj8eti5" class="commentText"><p>The Jeremy Lin situation will always be interesting to me. Being paired up with Carmelo Anthony, James Harden, and Kobe Bryant has got to be the absolute worst run of luck for his skillset. Literally having to play next to the 3 most ball-dominant, ego-centric players, while also being one of the only asians in the league is crazy.</p>

<p>Those of you who played in high school and college surely you would have a hour every blue moon and just do defensive drills? Right? Or is it all just offense üò©</p>
