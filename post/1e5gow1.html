<p>I think we learned from our mistake by drafting a more seasoned prospect in Knecht.</p>

<p>Ball was a bust at #2, at least a bunch of their players were enticing enough for AD filler.¬† LA does have a history of drafting well, but not to the point where they can shit on Portland as if they have some kind of spotless track record¬†</p>

Lonzo showed he could play basketball at a high level but doesn&rsquo;t have the knees to. And him, Ingram and Randle were good enough to be traded for a HoF player that got them a ring. Should that really be criticized as &ldquo;not developing them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t trying to put that on you, moreso the lakers fan who was shitting on Scoot and kicked this thread off.¬†</p>

<p>The lakers deserve props for making those picks and making the right moves with the pieces they acquired. I&rsquo;m just pointing out that they aren&rsquo;t some mecca of home-grown basketball talent, haven&rsquo;t been for decades.</p>

<p>For the Blazers, developing the players they have is literally their only option. Of course your draft record looks good on paper when you don&rsquo;t even keep most of your picks, or package them for more proven talent whenever possible. The Blazers cannot afford to go that route¬†</p>

<p>I think the worst mistakes the Pistons have made semi-recently were Khris Middleton traded for Brandon Jennings and trading Saddiq Bey into Wiseman.</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t waste a hot rookie if you consistently pick poorly and/or never develop potential stars!</p>

Balanced out with taking Meyers Leonard #11 in-between them and following those up with Justin Jackson (#15), Harry Giles (#20), Caleb Swanigan (#26).</p>

<p>Simon&rsquo;s and Will Barton are the impressive draft steals in recent Blazer history, but dude you&rsquo;re barely better than league average on the hit rate of your picks.</p>

It is just the math of how much they think the games would help his development (probably not much) versus the risk of injury when he is slotted to play a ton of minutes this season. He is still there with the team practicing to build chemistry. As a fan it is pretty lame but from the team perspective it makes sense.</p>

      <label for="ldmdcdz" class="commentText"><p>Counting stats are the ultimate cope with Scoot, his TS in that stretch was under 50%, which is mind-bogglingly bad. On league-average efficiency, a player with his attempts should have averaged 20 PPG. That is an insane gap, it&rsquo;s actually more than the gap between Joel Embiid and league average, just in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>Trust me, as a Rockets fan I&rsquo;m very familiar with the counting stats cope, it&rsquo;s the go-to when I want to feel better about Jalen Green. As disappointing as Green has been, though, he was actually just right under league average (~55% TS) his rookie year, also on a tanking team. Hope that gives some context for how monumentally awful Scoot has been.</p>

<p>I also watched Scoot quite a bit post all star break, I would still check in when nothing else was happening on league pass. I never saw anything that lined up with the draft profile, I hope he can turn it around next year.</p>

One example was Brandon Ingram, who was literally the worst player in the league during his first half season. He didn&rsquo;t have efficiency <em>or</em> the counting stats, and not even a flash here or there, leaving us with no cope at all. It took a little while, particularly with some injuries, but he did improve.</p>

Besides the fact that Scoot was playing with a monumentally terrible roster, plenty of good players put up terrible TS% their first few years. Jalen Green even at least had Sengun, Christian Wood, Theis, Eric Gordon&hellip;Scoot&rsquo;s team was worse than that and I don&rsquo;t think he meshes well with Simons/Brogdon who were the team&rsquo;s best players.</p>

<p>Smart, Ingram, Ball, Kemba, were all under 50% for their rookie season to name a few. D-Lo barely scratched 50% too.</p>

<p>Lol I can&rsquo;t wait for the season to start.  Keeping the receipts.</p>

<p>Scoot was a 19 year old point guard running a shit team.  He had a disastrous start to the season but looked like a completely different player by the end of the year. He averaged 18-4-8 on 55%TS the final 15 games against a bunch of west teams fighting for the playoffs.  During that stretch we had multiple games we started <strong>5</strong> rookies, and none of them shooters.</p>

his rookie cards in my collection, but in general I&rsquo;m hopeful he turns it around.</p>

<p>I did a <a href="https://stathead.com/basketball/versus-finder.cgi?player_id2=podzibr01&amp;player_id1=hendesc01&amp;request=1&amp;utm_campaign=2023_01_wdgt_player_comparison&amp;utm_source=bbr&amp;utm_medium=sr_xsite&amp;utm_id=hendesc01" target="_blank">comparison </a> between him and Podz who we all rave about - now I know they play different positions, but I think when you factor in Scoot&rsquo;s usage rate being twice as high along with all the injuries the Blazers were dealing with, I think with a healthy roster he&rsquo;s going to have a significantly better sophomore year.</p>

      <label for="ldmqy0u" class="commentText"><p>That is the thing here. Scoot still isn&rsquo;t great, but it was night and day between December and March. There is a lot of talk about him turning it around, but watching all the games Blazers fans would tell you he has already started down the (long) road of doing just that. It was funny down the stretch last year seeing &ldquo;wait. I thought Scoot was trash&rdquo; in every game thread. So many people paid attention for the first couple weeks when he was horrible and then never watched again. An interesting breakdown would be Podz/Keyonte George/Bilal/Scoot because the first 3 are all seen as promising prospects while Scoot doesn&rsquo;t have that narrative.</p>

<p>Cam Whitmore had a pretty good rookie season off the bench&hellip; His rookie season was better than any of Reddish&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s also a freshly minted 20 year old&hellip;.</p>

<p>He needs to learn to play within a system, and share the ball, but the dude can score and has amazing athleticism.</p>

Bam, Herro, Nunn, and JJJ got good minutes as rookies, so did Winslow and J rich (who was even a second rounder) all as rookies under spo. Achua was getting minutes even iirc.

<p>This recency bias is only because spo hasn&rsquo;t played Jovic and KZ as rookies.</p>

You draft 3 Jaquezs in a row youd think thats a success, until you realize you have no star and no youre stuck in limbo paying 3 players who are good but not great hoping for a disgruntled star to walk through the door. Historically speaking, alot of championship teams are won by drafting a superstar and hanging onto to them. In the past like 15 years only what, the bubble Lakers won without a player they drafted being a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> option.</p>

<p>It does come down to draft position. Second round sure whatever. Using a top five or top ten pick on a player like Jacquez is a waste in most drafts</p>

      <label for="ldn42g2" class="commentText"><p>I get it, but the hit rate on non-lottery players is so insanely low that even just getting a rotation guy in that spot is a win.  For the guys who make the leap from those spots, it feels like it&rsquo;s mostly about non-athletic skills (passing, shooting), hard work, and other factors than it is about being super athletic.</p>

<p>I agree that championship teams generally need an All-NBA player, often one they drafted.  But those guys are usually high lottery picks, so it&rsquo;s not like many teams have the opportunity to get them anyway.</p>

      <label for="ldnn6tv" class="commentText"><p>The hit rate on these great college Juniors and Seniors isn&rsquo;t always great either (e.g Agbaji, Rui, Duarte). All players who were picked top like 16 in spite of being on the older side and have all been traded before their rookie deal ended. Don&rsquo;t let recency bias fool you, Jacquez, just like any other player drafted later in the draft, is an exception not the norm. And you have to consider the perspective of the GM&rsquo;s as well, these guys are tasked by the owners to either a.) Spend money and build a contender or b.) be competitive but not as much money, and in general shooting for the stars is better than drafting a player that is a bit more likely to carve out an NBA role. However, don&rsquo;t get it twisted, a team like the Lakers passing on Jaquez for JHS is a crime, but a team like the Jazz picking up Keyonte right before makes alot of sense to me.</p>

      <label for="ldnym09" class="commentText"><p>Every team has a different strategy and at the end of the day it comes down to making the right picks and player development.  The Heat have done an excellent job lately both picking up young guys and developing them (Bam, Herro, and Jovic) and getting older players (Jaime and some of the undrafted guys).  Some teams suck at it.  That&rsquo;s the fun of the draft.</p>

      <label for="ldnixdo" class="commentText"><p>Very tough to tell.</p>

<p>Most similar comp is modern Jimmy Butler but less alpha and a better three point shooter. When Butler was injured last year he started for us and we didn&rsquo;t lose a step and arguably were faster and more downhill.</p>

<p>Strong defender and decent rebounder, very smart player and plays bigger than he is like Jimmy does and can outmuscle folks around the rim.</p>

<p>Negatives are that he tended to disappear in games where he didn&rsquo;t get a ton of usage and it felt like he lost some confidence by the end of the year. Teams started to plan better against him after he started hot so an extra summer of tools is good for him.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s generally a very good defender but can be exploited on some matchups especially when there is a lot of size. Another year in the Heat system with Spo tinkering and a roster with slightly more size should help.</p>

<p>Jimmy numbers (roughly 20-22/5/5) are def within reach as far a ceiling but he would get there through his long ball, not with a dominant mid game and forcing contact. He def does not have the Jimmy alpha thing where he can take over a game because you could see that in Jimmy before his game was complete so it&rsquo;s not <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.</p>

<p>TL;DR - his ceiling is likely quality starting SF in a championship roster. Would be really surprising if he can take his game to all NBA/all-star level but still a valuable player.</p>

      <label for="ldo0qp5" class="commentText"><p>I truly believe his ceiling is literally Mexican Jimmy Butler. Has a similar height to Jimmy, play style, has a longer wingspan than Jimmy, was drafted at 22 like Jimmy. While he averaged 12ppg throughout the season, he actually already has shown the capability to average more 16.3ppg. When Jimmy was out and Jaime moved to the starting lineup in Jimmy&rsquo;s place, Jaime averaged 16.3ppg on 59.5 ts%. His efficiency, minutes and ppg and usage dropped when he got back from that groin injury and Butler came back. Only thing is I think having to share the floor with Jimmy will hold Jaime back. They&rsquo;re just not compatible playing together with our current roster build.</p>

<p>Honestly, I think Miami is a great place for him to become a star, but will hold him back statistically for his first 3 years. He has the perfect player to learn from and a team known for creating great 3pt shooters to fix his shot, but he won&rsquo;t shine until Jimmy moves to the bench or takes a drastically reduced role.</p>

      <label for="ldplgas" class="commentText"><p>Likely outcome would be starter-level and borderline All-Star. He&rsquo;s shown he can be a good third or even second option on offense. He moves well off the ball, loves to go downhill, and before his injury, he was shooting 37.5% from three. He plugs into any offense really well. He&rsquo;s already a good defender and is only going to get better in the Heat system, plus the work ethic and maturity is a big plus. Depending on how the team&rsquo;s constructed later in his career, he could very well be a 20-6-5 guy, maybe actually make an All-Star or two.</p>

<p>You can give those kids 30 minutes a nights in competitive games where they can be the focal point of the offense or defense and develop their skills without watering down the NBA itself with projects.</p>

<p>Hopefully, the 50 games G-League schedule also eases teens in to the grueling 82+ game NBA schedule giving them a bit more time to develop with a little less wear and tear on their bodies.</p>

<p>How much the NBA would have suffered is certainly up for debate&hellip;would it have been a crushing blow to the NBA itself to <em>not</em> have Wemby play last year? I don&rsquo;t think so because you should be capturing a lot of that revenue through the Austin Spurs.</p>

<p>Now this would make Rookie of the Year a bit odd, but you can easily just say it&rsquo;s their first full season counts as their rookie year.</p>

<p>You are proving my point for me here.</p>

<p>Ticket prices are down because nobody goes to see the Austin Spurs because the Austin Spurs do not have any star power to draw viewers.</p>

<p>If Wemby was on the Autin Spurs, they could charge more for those tickets in the exact same way [Caitlyn Clark joining the Indiana Fever.](<a href="https://frontofficesports.com/caitlin-clark-wnba-ticket-prices/#:~:text=That's%20typical%20of%20the%20league,reigning%20champion%20Aces%20(%2425)." target="_blank">https://frontofficesports.com/caitlin-clark-wnba-ticket-prices/#:~:text=That&rsquo;s%20typical%20of%20the%20league,reigning%20champion%20Aces%20(%2425).</a>)</p>

<p>Bolstering the G-League is half the point of this proposal.</p>

<p>(The other half being developing young talent outside the NBA in order to stop diluting the NBA product itself with projects)</p>

<p>The G-league is primarily a developmental league, there&rsquo;s no reason to promote it/bolster it&rsquo;s popularity. The point of the NBA is to increase eyes and interest in its main league so they can generate revenue and find sponsors/tv contracts. Stashing a player in the G-league until they turn 20 does nothing to help that.</p>

      <label for="ldnhb65" class="commentText"><p>It improves the NBA itself as a whole.</p>

<p>If what you were saying was true, Wemby would have been drafted 2 years ago at 18, instead of last year at 19, but the NBA has rules preventing 18 year olds from playing in the NBA.</p>

<p>My proposal is extending the same rule <em>for the same exact reasons</em> one more year while also allowing the NBA to re-capture the &ldquo;lost&rdquo; revenue by allowing both 18 <em>and</em> 19 year old Wemby to play in the G-League on the Austin Spurs instead of playing for the Metropolitans 92 when he was 18.</p>
