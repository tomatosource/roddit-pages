</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Anyone read this? Quite a fun and easy read for an all-star player that dealt with major addiction problems.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s very open about everything and isn&rsquo;t afraid to admit being unfaithful, being addicted to pain killers, and gambling.</p>

<p>Two fun snippets:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Personality-wise, Jason [Kidd] fits in great with me and Steve [Nash]. We all live close to one another, drive to practices together, and play a ton of golf. However, there is tension between Jason and Kevin Johnson, which is weird because they both went to Cal. KJ is more political in his interactions—he eventually will become the mayor of Sacramento—but Jason is more blunt. One time during training camp, Steve is guarding KJ full-court, and KJ gets really pissed, and pretty soon we have to separate them. There is a period after that where Kevin doesn’t want to practice with us at all. He goes off and shoots somewhere else instead.</p>

<p>The thing about Wes [Unseld], though, is he is a lot of fun, but you can only push him so far. That man knows how to stand his ground. I see that one day in January when Bernard King comes into practice determined to be a major disruption. Bernard is coming off an injury and hasn’t been cleared yet. He is trying to force the team to waive him. The Bullets are holding firm, so Bernard shows up to practice unannounced. Wes tells him he can’t play, but Bernard comes onto the court anyway. “I’m fucking Bernard King!” he says. Bernard jumps into practice and is intentionally messing up in the drills. He throws a ball into the stands. Finally, Wes has enough. He lunges at Bernard, grabs his jersey, and twists it around his neck. A few players and I jump in to break it up. Wes comes into the locker room after practice. Bernard is sitting in there with us. “Bernard, you have to see the doctor before you can come back,” Wes says calmly. “You’re not even supposed to be in the locker room.” Bernard talks some shit, but by then he is smart enough not to try to get physical with Wes. At any rate, Bernard accomplishes his mission. The Bullets waive him the next day, and he signs with the Nets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dell and Sonya have one baby. His name is Stephen. I haven’t been around babies a whole lot, but I love being with Stephen. If Dell and Sonya want to go out to dinner, they ask me to babysit. I change his diapers and everything. Otherwise, Dell takes Stephen everywhere. Dell, Muggsy, and I will be riding in the car, thinking we are great players. Little do we know the best player in the car is sitting in the baby seat.</p>

      <label for="l7bvitg" class="commentText"><p>Side note, but speaking of that general timeframe of the Suns, between ‘97 (first year without Barkley) and 2000 the Suns had these guards:</p>

<p>-Sam Cassell</p>

<p>-Jason Kidd</p>

<p>-Steve Nash</p>

<p>-Kevin Johnson</p>

<p>-Penny Hardaway</p>

<p>They even went 56-26 in ‘98 with Kidd, Johnson, and Nash all on the team. They went just 41-41 during Barkley’s last year. Pretty interesting time for the Suns.</p>

<p>Coaches and boosters kept telling him &ldquo;obviously I don&rsquo;t have a problem with it but <em>others</em> do&rdquo;. Also him being able to get access to cash whenever we wanted at Kentucky wasn&rsquo;t a surprise but interesting that he&rsquo;d acknowledged it.</p>

<p>problem is negative people from both groups of people would have had problem with that making it incredibly difficult. brittney griner also had similar thing with mulkey at baylor. griner and general news took it harshly too.</p>
