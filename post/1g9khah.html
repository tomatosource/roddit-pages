      <label for="lt70neh" class="commentText"><p>This. Bums on social media will talk about “Kobe’s era” forgetting that LeBron won 4 MVPs during Kobe’s prime to Kobe’s 1. LeBron was already the best player in the world by the late 00s, he just didn’t have the team to win the chip with. Kobe was better in Beijing, I’ll give him that, but that’s about it. Rings culture is the only reason why people pretended like Kobe was better in 09 and 10.</p>

<p>The Kobe people are like the Lost Cause people with the Civil War. The Lost Causers convinced people that Robert E. Lee was a better General than US Grant even though Grant dragged his ass. Now the Kobe Lost Causers are trying to convince people Kobe was better than LeBron.</p>

      <label for="lt7mw7x" class="commentText"><p>I mean I think Robert Lee is universally considered a better general. But come on it wasn&rsquo;t a fair fight the north had WAY more money, troops and better technology. They also had way more casualties and really grant won by just going total war on the south, burning and destroying whatever land they couldn&rsquo;t pillage.</p>

<p>Never heard of lost cause.
But lebron&amp;gt; kobe I&rsquo;m sorry but its tough to argue otherwise. Kobe is probably the most overrated player amongst mainstream/casual sports fans. Like a decent amount say hes better than mj, when literally everything from passing, athleticism, speed, defense both on ball and off ball, drawing fouls, mid range, scoring, everything except 3 pt shooting Jordan is clearly better. Even leadership wise Phil said mj was a better leader and had more charisma. And regarding 3pt percentage mj was better relative to his era than kobe, albeit on much lower volume, which in large part was also due to 3 point shots being taken far less during that time.</p>

<p>The same thing is done vs kobe and lbj, lebron was better as a rebounder, way better as a passer, at least equal as a scorer if not better (slightly lower volume but much more efficient even taking into account kobe playing in an era that was less efficient). Maybe one or two years at his peak kobe is better as a scorer especially one on one but unlike lebron and mj he was nowhere near as good in the early and latter parts of his career.</p>

<p>Replying so I can come back to this comment later on my laptop with rebuttals to this sentiment. Military historians have generally revised their opinion on this &ldquo;Lee was a great general hampered by inferior tech/troops&rdquo; sentiment</p>

      <label for="lt7trzf" class="commentText"><p>Oh hell no he wasn’t. I can reply more later but Lee did not just lose because of a lack of advantages. Lee fucked up Gettysburg hard and then he got wrecked by Grant in the wilderness campaign on Lee’s home turf.</p>

<p>This is obviously a YouTube video but it’s well researched and goes into why Grant was so much better than Lee: <a href="https://youtu.be/O1MQflqi2VM?si=ruAF11YyARnlJzPW" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/O1MQflqi2VM?si=ruAF11YyARnlJzPW</a></p>

<p>There’s plenty of academic sources that go into it too if you prefer those.</p>

<p>The Lost Cause was an effort by the descendants of Confederates to re-write history to convince people that the South wasn’t that bad and make them look as good as possible. Some of the stuff in your comment is straight up Lost Cause myth.</p>

<p>At the very least it is not a universal opinion like you said, the fact that we’re having this debate shows that it’s not unanimous. At this point the consensus opinion amongst military historians is that Grant was better.</p>

Two years ago when he broke the scoring record people kept bringing up that LeBron shot 3s and Kareem didn’t.

<p>2020-21: 422 FGM / 823 FGA in 45 games.</p>

<p>2021-22: 640 FGM / 1221 FGA in 56 games.</p>

<p>2022-23: 609 FGM / 1219 FGA in 55 games.</p>

<p>2023-24: 685 FGM / 1269 FGA in 71 games.</p>

<p>So if he has 2 more mostly healthy seasons he can get it.</p>

<p>EDIT: He already holds the record for most FGA as well. All these are regular season only.</p>
