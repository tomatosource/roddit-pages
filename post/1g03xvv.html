</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I have decided to preview the upcoming NBA season and thought the best way to do would be put the teams into five tiers. The first tier is Tier 5 which are the teams that I expect to have  the best chance to getting the number 1 pick in the 2025 NBA Draft. Fans of these teams should expect to have some free time in April because these teams will not be in the playoff hunt and will be sending their scouts to the college campuses across the nation trying to find their next cornerstone of their franchise. Here are the teams in a tier I call: &ldquo;Failing for Flagg&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Brooklyn Nets (32-50, Finished 11****</strong><strong>^(th)</strong> <strong>in Eastern Conference</strong><br>
<strong>Head Coach</strong>: Jordi Fernandez Torres<br>
<strong>Over/Under Win Total</strong>: 18.5 wins<br>
<strong>Projected Starting Lineup</strong>: G Dennis Schroder, G Cameron Thomas, F Cameron Johnson, F Dorian Finney-Smith and C Nic Claxton<br>
<strong>Projected Payroll for 24-25 Season</strong>: $170,371, 360 (21^(st) in the NBA)</p>

<p> After making the playoffs for five consecutive years, the Nets have decided to press the button on the rebuilding process. This summer, they traded away their leading scorer Mikal Bridges to the crosstown Knicks for four future first round picks and some other salary filler. To make sure that they can increase their chances of picking toward the top of the 2025 NBA Draft you can probably expect for them to trade other players that may have value to other teams such as Dennis Schroeder, Cameron Johnson, Bojan Bogdanovic and if some team still believes in Ben Simmons.</p>

<p><strong>My Prediction: 15-67</strong></p>

<p><strong>Washington Wizards (15-67, 14****</strong><strong>^(th)</strong> <strong>in Eastern Conference)</strong><br>
<strong>Head Coach</strong>: Brian Keefe<br>
<strong>Over/Under Wins</strong>: 20.5 Wins<br>
<strong>Projected Starting Lineup</strong>: G Malcolm Brogdon, G Jordan Poole, F Kyle Kuzma, F Alex Sarr and C Jonas Valanciunas<br>
<strong>Projected Payroll</strong>: $168,797,622 (23^(rd) in the NBA)</p>

<p>The Wizards had the second worst record in the NBA last season and had their worst record in sixteen years. The Wizards were expected to tank last season to gain draft position and were rewarded with the second overall pick which they use to select forward Alex Sarr. Scouts were very divided about Sarr and what he may project to be in the NBA. He should have plenty of opportunities to make mistakes because this team is in the early stages of their rebuild. I would imagine that the Wizards will also try to make sure they get the best shot at receiving the number one pick in the 2025 NBA Draft.<br>
The Wizards have some promising players such as Cory Kispert, Bilal Coulibaly and if Sarr can develop that could be the foundation of a decent NBA team but it looks like it will be another long year in DC.</p>

<p><strong>My Prediction: 22-60</strong></p>

<p><strong>Portland Trail Blazers (21-61, 15****</strong><strong>^(th)</strong> <strong>in Western Conference)</strong><br>
<strong>Head Coach</strong>: Chauncey Billups<br>
<strong>Over/Under Wins</strong>: 22.5 wins<br>
<strong>Projected Starting Lineup</strong>: G Scoot Henderson, G Afernee Simons, F Shaedon Sharpe, F Jeremi Grant and C Deandre Ayton<br>
<strong>Projected Payroll</strong>: $171,435,753 (22^(nd) in the NBA)</p>

<p>The Trailblazers in their first year after Damian Lillard was traded were what you expected them to be which was bad! Also, if you look at the fact their three of their projected starters (Ayton, Sharpe and Simons) all played less than 60 games you can understand how this team won only 21 games. In addition, Scoot Henderson who was the 3^(rd) overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft had a very slow start shooting less than 35 percent from the field for the first two months of the season. Portland will still be trying to collect lottery balls for the NBA Draft in 2025, but they will also be evaluating to see what players will be on the team when they return to contention. It is pivotal year for young players Sharpe, Henderson and first round pick Donvan Clingan. In addition, the Trailblazers may trade veterans Deandre Ayton and Jeremi Grant who could possibly fetch them some future trade picks that could aid in this rebuild.</p>

<p><strong>Predicted Record: 24-58</strong></p>

<p><strong>Detroit Pistons (14-68, 15****</strong><strong>^(th)</strong> <strong>in Eastern Conference)</strong><br>
<strong>Head Coach</strong>: J.B. Bickerstaff<br>
<strong>Over/Under Wins</strong>: 24.5 wins<br>
<strong>Projected Starting Lineup</strong>: G Cade Cunningham, G Jaden Ivey, F Ausar Thompson, F Tobias Harris, C Jalen Duren<br>
<strong>Projected Payroll</strong>: $131,902,093 (30^(th) in the NBA)</p>

<p>The Pistons made some significant changes to a team that has once again pressed the &ldquo;start over&rdquo; button on a rebuild. Head Coach Monty Williams was paid to go away and his replacement J.B. Bickerstaff inherits a team that has really has no true identity. The Pistons ranked near the bottom of the league in several offensive and defensive categories.</p>

<p>Fans of the Pistons should hope for Jaden Ivey to justify why he was a top five pick in the 2022 NBA Draft, hope that Tobias Harris and Tim Hardaway Jr can provide some veteran leadership and consistent scoring and hope that Bickerstaff can do the same job that he did in Cleveland when he took them from a 19 win team in his first year and lead them to 51 wins by his third year.</p>

<p><strong>My prediction</strong>: <strong>27-55</strong></p>

<p><strong>Atlanta Hawks (36-46, Finished 10****</strong><strong>^(th)</strong> <strong>in Eastern Conference)</strong><br>
<strong>Head Coach</strong>: Quinn Snyder<br>
<strong>Over/Under Win Total</strong>: 36.5 wins<br>
<strong>Projected Starting Lineup</strong>: G Trae Young, G Bogdan Bogdanovic, F Zaccharie Risacher, F Jalen Johnson and C Clint Capella<br>
<strong>Projected Payroll</strong>: $174, 509, 429 (19^(th) in the NBA)</p>

<p>The Hawks finally ended the Dejounte Murray/Trae Young experiment after two seasons which produced an under .500 record and three playoff wins total. The Hawks traded Murray to New Orleans for some added depth to this roster. Also, joining the Hawks is the number overall pick in the 2024 NBA Draft Zacchaire Risacher who had an up and down debut in the NBA Summer League this summer. The Hawks ranked near the bottom in several defensive categories last season and while they added some defensive minded players in the offseason such as Lance Nance Jr and Dyson Daniels in the the Murray trade.<br>
The Hawks will look to forward Jalen Johnson to be their second-best player after Young and if he can continue to get better then maybe the Hawks can contend. If he does not, this can be another team that could trade veteran players such as Capella or Bogdanovic so that the young players can get a chance to play.</p>

<p><strong>Predicted Record: 29-53</strong></p>

<p><strong>Toronto Raptors (25-57, 12</strong><strong>^(th)</strong> <strong>in the Eastern Conference)</strong><br>
<strong>Head Coach</strong>: Darko Rajakovic<br>
<strong>Over/Under Win Total</strong>: 30.5 Wins<br>
<strong>Projected Starting Lineup</strong>: G Immanuel Quickley, G Gradey Dick, F RJ Barrett, F Scottie Barnes and C Jakob Poetl<br>
<strong>Projected Payroll</strong>: $168,064,508 (24^(th) in the NBA)</p>

<p>The Raptors have probably changed their roster the most since last October. They traded away Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby during last season who were cornerstones of their roster for several years. It is clear that a youth movement has started in Toronto and the Raptors are trying to see what players will be apart of this new era of Raptor basketball.<br>
One of the players that fans will be watching is forward RJ Barrett. Barrett was acquired from the Knicks in the OG Anunoby trade and appeared to be more consistent that he was when he was with the Knicks. He increased his stats in several categories and emerged as their second best player behind Scottie Barnes.<br>
It is possible if they get some quality and consistent production this team could be a play-in team but if not they will miss the playoffs for third consecutive season.</p>

<p><strong>My prediction: 34-48</strong></p>

Obviously a great player, but I feel like there&rsquo;s gonna be other lottery picks in the top 10 that are beyond even that. Kinda like the 2009 draft with Harden and Curry being the best players out of the lottery.</p>

I feel like fans haven’t really internalized the impact of the flattened lottery odds, ie that you don’t need to go full process to be in the mix for a top pick.</p>
