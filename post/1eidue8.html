      <label for="lg5s8ui" class="commentText"><p>I mean 8 out of the 12 players made All-NBA this season. Out of the ones that didn’t, Bam was an all-star this year and made All-Defensive First team, Jrue made All-Defensive Second Team, and Derrick White made All-Defensive Second Team, and Embiid literally just won MVP last year (and averaged 35 in the games he played this season).</p>

<p>So, team USA has 9 (including Embiid) of the 16 best players in the league last year and 3 of the top 10 defenders in the league.</p>

<p>No one should really be beating this team. This is probably the best US team ever.</p>

      <label for="lg5ztiv" class="commentText"><p>I wanna agree. Everyone is unbeatable until they get beaten. But I think as long as Lebron is available as a stabilizing force, USA is UNBEATABLE. I just can&rsquo;t see this many players going cold at the same time. There are like 9 players that can take over a game entirely by themselves. I just can&rsquo;t see all 9 going cold. Maybe they get panicked but Lebron is there to be the floor general and I don&rsquo;t see it.</p>

      <label for="lg74qzz" class="commentText"><p>Maybe I didn’t really articulate what I meant very well. Lebron actually isn’t a great example of a juggernaut TEAM (over the full course of his career) because he wasn’t even favored in most of the finals he played in. Lebron was only actually upset in the finals one time.</p>

<p>In fact he was a pretty big underdog in several of the finals he was in. Juggernauts are favored because they are more likely to win and generally they do win more often. We just remember the upsets more because they are exciting and unexpected. But usually championships/accolades/etc. are won by a fairly small group of teams/players that are pretty predictable.</p>

<p>Even March Madness which is famous for its upsets has seen 25 out of the last 39 tournaments (going back to the start of the current format in 1985) won by 1 seeds.</p>

<p>If there was really a 2016 Cavs for every 2016 Warriors then those upsets wouldn’t be so special.</p>

      <label for="lg61o0p" class="commentText"><p>The difference is the 92 team was built to dominate against lesser teams and we were in a better situation. Our only competition was the Soviets and Yugoslavians who both collapsed prior to the Olympics. This team is built to compete with actual strong teams, way more thought out into it than the 92 teams.</p>

      <label for="lg79xlq" class="commentText"><p>The fuck lmao? No, they built that team to dominate literally fucking anybody. You nephews jesus man lay of the drugs bud.</p>

<p>This is not way more thought out. I know you are probably in high school, but that&rsquo;s not how this works. Most of the dudes here are just top players. They aren&rsquo;t even playing well. So obviously, this team wasn&rsquo;t super thought out. It was wrapped together just like they all are.</p>

It was a collection of the biggest stars out there, knowing they&rsquo;d absolutely dominate and put on a show.  The most effort they put into roster construction was &ldquo;okay, we need two centers, and 2 point guards and&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Magic had already retired (granted because of HIV) and hadn&rsquo;t played in a year.  Bird was 35 and just retired.  Laettner was there to represent the NCAA.</p>

<p>With a tight rotation, yeah the Dream Team is a monster.  Jordan and Pippen and the centers would be pretty dominant at defense in any era.  But they weren&rsquo;t a team of 12 players where all 12 players could provide value in a competitive game.  They weren&rsquo;t built as a team.</p>

<p>Exactly. It worked so well that it remained Team USA&rsquo;s strategy for the next 12 years, with less success every time.</p>

      <label for="lg7auzt" class="commentText"><p>This team isn&rsquo;t even close to VARIOUS starting 5&rsquo;s of 92 lmao. You had prime Jordan, of which nobody on this team will guard well. You had prime Pippen, who will guard anybody on this team outside the center. Pip was also shooting around 50% in those years. That&rsquo;s better than a lot of the people on this team, and he would be like the 5TH! guy you go to on offense lmao.</p>

<p>You had prime Robinson, again, of which nobody on this team is even close to that package, and if not him than a near prime Ewing, still better than any center on this team. Not sure how AD would fare against Ewing here, who was a bit of a bully at times.</p>

<p>You had prime Chuck, one of a few players in history to basically shoot 60% and dominate inside&hellip; like Zion with a brain. You had Malone, who nobody on this team is guarding either lol. Dude was a fucking beast. If anything Malone is the prototype for Lebron, but he&rsquo;s a little bigger and not quite as good all around. But he&rsquo;s definitely as good as Lebron at driving to the rim.</p>

<p>Stockton and Mullin could easily be thrown to for 3s, but in a 5v5 scenario you ain&rsquo;t going to be chucking threes on the defensive prowess of 92 lmao. That&rsquo;s something people here don&rsquo;t understand. That 92 team was absolutely coherent and nuts on defense when set up right. They aren&rsquo;t going to allow any bullshit. You aren&rsquo;t just chucking threes up with them in your face and shooting 40% lol.</p>

<p>Shit we haven&rsquo;t even got around to Magic. With Magic on point there is going to be insane trouble trying to contain Jordan and Barkley. If they can&rsquo;t get it up then you have massive DRob or Ewing to poke it in. Or you can just throw to Malone for the drive or Mullins for a three. Hell, you can put injured Bird out there for threes. It&rsquo;s not like he wasn&rsquo;t one of the greatest three shooters in history lol.</p>

<p>You have an old ass Lebron and a slightly injured KD with Edwards as your main persona&rsquo;s. Great yes, but these people are not in their primes. Not even fucking close. Edwards is not in his prime either. He&rsquo;s too young.</p>

<p>92 would dominate this team. If everybody on each team was in their primes it might be a different story. It would be close then. But that&rsquo;s now how this works either. If fucking 92 had prime Bird then LOL.</p>

<p>Now if you wanna talk 96 that matchup is probably pretty damn close. 12 is also pretty good but you do have some young kids on that one too.</p>

      <label for="lg7ge28" class="commentText"><p>Bruh that &lsquo;92 team never seen anyone 6&rsquo;11&rdquo; knocking down threes and playing like a guard.</p>

<p>They were great for their time but they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to keep up with the current team US on three point shooting alone. I&rsquo;m an old head too but there is 30 years of development between that team and the current one. Nobody guards anybody 1-on-1 anymore because it&rsquo;s impossible to do so. It&rsquo;s all in defensive schemes and it would be far too easy to scheme a lot of them out of the game especially since they wouldn&rsquo;t&rsquo;t have to worry about three point shooting outside of Bird and literally no midrange for any of the Centers let alone threes.</p>

<p>&lsquo;92 is faaaaar too limited for modern day game&hellip;</p>

<p>Also nowhere near as deep. They did not have an NBA Champion logging in DNP minutes while the Finals MVP couldn&rsquo;t even make the team. They had guys like Christian Laettner or Chris Mullins on the bench which sure were great role players but they were not close to the current team USA bench.</p>

<p>How many of those 92 guys would make the current team USA? Gotta be able to hit the three no matter the position so that is a lot of people out right off the bat.</p>

You are obviously a child, but even then it&rsquo;s ridiculous to not understand that lmao. Nobody on that team has inflated stats. The entire starting 5 would be MVPs outside Pippen, who was close to winning one and considered the best perimeter D man in NBA history or very close.</p>

<p>Prime fucking Jordan. Nobody is guarding him on this team. Not a single fucking person is going to have a good time.</p>

<p>DRob. There is no center even close to his package of defense and offense. AD is just not up there but decent still.</p>

<p>Barkley in his prime was also better than just about anybody inside. 60% shooting against some of the biggest defenders in league history.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s okay to be a muppet. I don&rsquo;t blame you. These are your heroes, but some of us just look at it objectively having watched all of them play.</p>

<p>JxmyHighroller had a good video on this topic last week. While this team does have the most accolades by a hair, that&rsquo;s mostly because this team is very old with most of the team being past their prime. Meanwhile, the Dream Team had most of the team in the middle of their prime, so if you look at how the players of each team performed in the season leading up the the Olympics the Dream Team absolutely dominates every other Olympic team by a massive margin. Like this team has an average BPM of 4.92 and some of the other Olympic teams were in the 5s&hellip;but the Dream Team was at 7.07, clearing every other team by more than a full point.</p>

<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth dream team had 9 all NBA from the 92 season and all of them were first or second team, which is insane. The ones that didn&rsquo;t make all NBA were Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Christian Laetner.  Magic was still magic, but Larry and Christian were mostly ceremonial picks.</p>

<p>The redeem team only had 6 all-NBA from the previous season.</p>

<p>Boozer, Redd and Prince were really good players. But some other dream teams are just too deep.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like using those 3 against the 2008 team is fair they were picked to fill holes. It&rsquo;s like what this team did with Jrue and Derrick White.</p>

<p>Boozer was averaging <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> that year which is basically what Bam is doing.  And Red and Prince were solid, not like they are getting cleared by some of the less super star players like Derrick White and Jrue.</p>

<p>Overall, crazy take that makes it sound like you weren’t watching nba back then. “Top heavy” lol</p>

      <label for="lg5xxed" class="commentText"><p>This is my biggest criticism of how people analyze previous eras. Anyone who wasn’t a top 10 player is viewed in today’s eyes as lesser. But there were Derrick White’s in previous eras that don’t seem as valuable today but absolutely were. Tayshaun Prince literally was a taller Derrick White for the Pistons teams that made like 7 straight ECFs. Carlos Boozer was, as the kids say, a fucking problem. Michael Redd scored 57 points against the Jazz less than 2 years before the 08 Olympics. And that’s 57 points in the slow ass 06 pace of play. He’s actually one of those players who should be commonly answered for the question we get every week “what player from previous eras would do very well in this era”</p>

<p>Also that 08 team had 8 first ballot hall of famers. I’m not saying this Olympics team is necessarily worse. But the way some people frame it as it’s not even a conversation is crazy</p>

      <label for="lg6ksre" class="commentText"><p>This thread is making me realize I&rsquo;m an old head on this subreddit now&hellip; no way a highly upvoted comment is scoffing at Boozer Redd and Tayshaun as if they were mediocre players, when Derrick White (who is great in his own right) is on this current team. And White&rsquo;s definitely a tier below Boozer and Redd at least. This is also coming from someone who thought Boozer was overrated back then</p>

<p>I would say that it wasn&rsquo;t that long ago but tbf 16 years is quite far. Boozer&rsquo;s own sons are coming to the league now lol</p>

      <label for="lg6q3sd" class="commentText"><p>Also an old head here, but disagree that White is definitely a tier below Boozer. They are different kinds of players.</p>

<p>Boozer is a better first option than White, but neither are good enough to be a first option on a true contender.</p>

<p>Boozer is a better second option than White, but neither are good enough to be a second option on a contender.</p>

<p>Third option gets murky because it depends a lot on who the first two are.</p>

<p>But White is a better fourth and fifth option than Boozer, and performs that role at a championship level. White is also a better bench player than Boozer imo.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I would argue White is a much more winning player than Boozer. It is difficult for me to envision the role Carlos Boozer would play on a championship team other than like riding the bench as a late-career ring chaser.</p>

<p>He was more capable than White offensively, and if i&rsquo;m choosing between the two to be the best player on my team, im going with Boozer. But I don&rsquo;t have high hopes for that team. He never did any of the little things because he viewed himself as a marquis guy.</p>

<p>Tayshaun is a good comp for White I think. Michael Redd I would argue was just better than Derrick Whites, but injuries were always the problem with him.</p>

      <label for="lg7cap4" class="commentText"><p>I disagree, look at Team USA or the Boston Celtics.</p>

<p>Boozer would be a fourth or fifth option on the current celtics. They certainly need Derrick White in that role and it is part of why they won the championship. If it was Boozer, I think they would be a worse team.</p>

<p>Same with team USA. I think replacing white with Boozer on team USA would make them a worse team.</p>

      <label for="lg7cmb1" class="commentText"><p>The issue is how many teams are built like the Celtics or team USA?</p>

<p>The only teams that would want White over Boozer is a team that already has a star PF and not enough guard depth, or a team that’s absolutely stacked like the Celtics.</p>

<p>Majority of the team in the NBA would improve more with Boozer than White, how can you say White is the better player if that’s the case? I watched this man drop 42/12/6 and 35/13/5 to close out the Rockets and go head to head with Tim Duncan in the playoffs. Ain’t no way is Derrick White a better basketball player.</p>

      <label for="lg7hy3d" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not really saying White is <em>better</em> at basketball than Boozer. More that it&rsquo;s not so simple to compare players who are in different roles. I think the simplest way to put it is that Boozer is a better individual basketball player and White is a better team basketball player. Another way to put it would be that White is a ceiling raiser and Boozer is a floor raiser.</p>

<p>Majority of teams in the NBA would improve more with Boozer than White, yes I probably agree with that, but I&rsquo;d contest that it&rsquo;s probably a bit closer than you think. Off the top of my head, here are teams I think would be helped more by adding White than adding Boozer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lakers</li>
<li>Timberwolves</li>
<li>Bucks</li>
<li>76ers</li>
<li>Heat</li>
<li>Nuggets</li>
<li>Suns</li>
</ul>

<p>What I notice is that a lot of these teams already have at least two players who are better individually than Boozer and are all close to contending or currently contending.</p>

<p>I think if you have a first and second option already who are both better than Boozer, you are better off adding White. And in today&rsquo;s NBA, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re winning with Boozer as a second option.</p>

<p>So Boozer might increase any given team&rsquo;s wins by more than Derrick White would. But Derrick White very well might increase any given teams championship odds more than Boozer would.</p>

      <label for="lg6rs6y" class="commentText"><p>I think White is actually on a pretty similar level with them.  Boozer and Redd were poor man&rsquo;s all stars then.  Boozer was more celebrated because we cared more about raw numbers, but if you&rsquo;re looking at impact, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much difference.</p>

<p>Put it this way: do you think Boozer or Manu was the better player?  White plays like Manu (although obviously not as good).</p>

<p>Also keep in mind White&rsquo;s spot was supposed to be Kawhi.</p>

      <label for="lg6qj1k" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s more a discussion of team construction.  Previous years did have comparable and arguably better talent in their primes.  I don&rsquo;t think they were built as thoughtfully, or at least, the stars from then didn&rsquo;t offer shooting the way this team&rsquo;s stars do.</p>

<p>Part of that is just how the game has changed, but also most of those guys weren&rsquo;t as adaptable to different styles as Steph and KD are.  If you&rsquo;re boiling it down to the basics, those two are why this team is better (assuming Steph stops playing poorly).</p>

<p>The better way to put it is that this is probably the most balanced team we&rsquo;ve had.  If we&rsquo;re lacking anything, it&rsquo;s a little bit on wing players (which would&rsquo;ve been solved with Kawhi instead of White).  But we&rsquo;ve got 3 elite, mobile defensive bigs, likely the best overall shooting from any of our teams, and playmaking wings.</p>

<p>If you made radar charts of each of the teams, this one would cover more ground than the rest.  I think that&rsquo;s what Wade is talking about.</p>

<p>In 16 years we&rsquo;ll have new versions of these guys and they new generation will think they are better too lol.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all I mean. They obviously didn&rsquo;t have the championship pedigree, that say Jrue has, but they were guys who could play a team style ball.</p>

<p>Personally, I feel like you guys are holding too high of a standard. I&rsquo;m not claiming these guys were the <em>best</em> glue players or even better than Jrue or White. Just that they were the kind of guys you could plug and play on a team USA, do useful things, and <em>don&rsquo;t</em> have to be a primary ball handler. All of these guys fit this role at some point in their careers.</p>

<p>The real mega lineup: Bron at PG, KD at SG, Embiid at SF, AD at PF, Bam at C.</p>

<p>Also, we&rsquo;re far more likely to see 4 guards with LeBron at center. This is still Steve Kerr we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>

<p>Kobe and Lebron and Wade and Carmelo at basically their peak. Dwight and CP3 and Deron Williams at their peak (and remember: Deron Williams was a 20-10 guy and he was basically == to CP3 at this stage; he just fell off like crazy a few years later). Jason Kidd was also really good.</p>

<p>The team had 2 weak links: Boozer and Michael Redd; but they barely played anyways. I still think the top 10 of the 08 roster is better than the 12 of this roster. I&rsquo;d take a 2008 LeBron vs a 2024 LeBron. I&rsquo;d take Kobe and D Wade over anyone on the 2024 USA roster&hellip; I&rsquo;d take 2008 Dwight WAY over Bam and AD. I don&rsquo;t think its even rlly close.</p>

<p>Superstars on the list looking back before their prime? Big guys too old or overrated? Or was it bad coaching/strategy + cockiness/ego isoball? Even that doesn&rsquo;t feel like enough to go 5-3 and have like half of and the largest Team USA loss in history.</p>

<p>If you made basketball attribute radar charts for each of our best Olympics teams, this year&rsquo;s team would cover the most area.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that makes them the best.  It&rsquo;s hard to pick out-of-prime Lebron over prime MJ.  But it does make them the most balanced.  On paper, this team should not have any shortcomings.</p>

<p>Redd or Prince basically took KDs spot. Boozer was more of a traditional big man and KD was definitely seen as too young to play PF/C in the Olympics</p>
