But that was short lived.</p>

<p>And before knicks fans point things out, I know i know, no ihart or mitch rob. As a result center was an existential crisis for the roster. But damn idc how good bridges is or was 5 was too many if you arent valuing the whole nova knicks things.</p>

<p>Brunson took less bit also locked in a lot of money right now, which is very valuable for a small guard coming pff a great season that ended with a serious injury.  Just ask Isaiah Thomas.</p>

This recent extension was definitely with a handshake agreement that the team would try to maximize the window. If they hemmed and hawwed he probably waits until next offseason and his trade value is much murkier as an expiring. Instead they have him on a steal of a deal for next 4 years.</p>

      <label for="lsnem8f" class="commentText"><p>Elite level trolling. Just say you don&rsquo;t watch him play. Brunson averaged 28.7ppg on 48% fg, 53% efg then raised his level of play in the playoffs to 32ppg on the same efficiency (with worse players around him due to injury)! 1: how&rsquo;re you gonna find someone better and who would give you that guy? And don&rsquo;t even mention picks. We had top 10 picks for a decade plus and the best player we drafted was RJ Barrett.</p>

<p>JB has improved every single year in the league and was also on fire with Dallas in the playoffs. He is a 3 level scorer and is efficient from every spot on the floor. He was 5th in MVP voting and all NBA last year lol. Like man what more do you want? You need prime mj, LeBron or Luka? Cus I&rsquo;m sure those are the only players you actually watch play.</p>

When you add a guy like KAT it fundamentally changes how the team plays. They kinda talked about it today on their podcast a bit. Josh was talking about how there’s different angles to make passes to that he’s never had to do before, and just about how their positioning on the court is completely different with KAT then ihart or Mitch.</p>

<p>I’m a little concerned about Mikal’s jumper but if it really gets too bad I’m sure Jalen and Josh will bully him into fucking with it</p>

      <label for="lsmwfz3" class="commentText"><p>Not to the Suns. If they go after Booker or KD, which they will, they can pay the premium. And I have a feeling they will get their wish in 3-4 years, barring any inexplicable development. Aka Ryan Dunn becoming the next Kawhi, an endless stream of players betting on themselves like Tyus, and/or some high profile ring chasers.</p>
