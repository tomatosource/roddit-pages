</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I say best situation and not just roster when including coaching and team chemistry.</p>

<p>With Butler and Prime Harris you could argue that Sixers squad had more top end talent but when you look at the overall rotation, I think it can be said this is the best team Embiid will have ever played with. PG is their third option.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a bit skeptical of Oubre myself, but can&rsquo;t argue he had some of the best basketball in a winning environment of his career last season. Yabusele&rsquo;s translation back to NBA ball will be a question, but from his International team play to the Olympics and play for France, the things he&rsquo;s done well are things he&rsquo;s doing consistently in all environments and important skills for what the Sixers need at that 4 spot.</p>

<p>They have depth, they have shooting, they have size, and they have more than two guys who can create shots for themselves. On paper, I think this is the best team Embiid has ever had to play with. What do you all think?</p>

      <label for="lir0sdg" class="commentText"><p>This is not the best team embiid has had around him, but it is the best team because this embiid is better than 2019 embiid by alot.. So if you take both embiids out, the 2019 roster (i think right year?) is probably better, with jimmy, Tobias still good, Simmons being labeled as the next lebron.. JJ redick was lights out,</p>

      <label for="liraza8" class="commentText"><p>The 18-19 team may have been more talented, but the fit was terrible. Their best lineup included Embiid, Simmons, and Butler, and while they are (or were) all excellent defensively, their three point shooting ranged from below average to non-existent. It’s hard to consistently create offense with that kind of spacing</p>

<p>As an aside, the defense was worse than I remembered. 14th in DRTG, so overall they were only 11th in net rating that season.</p>

I remembered the starting lineup being good, but pretty much any combination of lineup involving the bench must&rsquo;ve been pretty bad then, because that&rsquo;s a huge dropoff overall.</p>

<p>And yeah I know that Embiid stat, but I still was pretty disappointed in his offensive performance when I watched the series.</p>

      <label for="lirs5v7" class="commentText"><p>I would argue you have it backwards, in this series Embiid&rsquo;s shooting stats are misleading. He was expected to work with absolutely zero spacing. JJ was the only starter who could shoot 3s. Harris is not a great 3 point shooter, Butler straight up refused to shoot 3s and the other starter was Ben Simmons. Embiid put up an incredible effort against a league-winning defence that was all over him, while also anchoring the Sixers defence. The plus/minus reflects that.</p>

<p>Butler was good but he was definitely not the best player. His defence on Kawhi was atrocious, he was getting roasted on every play. The big adjustment that kept the Sixers in the series was keeping Butler off Kawhi and putting Simmons on him instead.</p>

      <label for="lirugmm" class="commentText"><p>The Jimmy year was terrible. The bench was bad. The fit was bad. Embiid himself was not the force he is today. I think they were only real contenders in the 2nd Harden year. I respect the Heat and the Heat culture but being 3-2 up vs the Celtics is probably the only time they were favorites to reach the finals. We could&rsquo;ve had a Jokic vs Embiid finals matchup (although the Nuggets were more ready for a championship at that point).</p>

      <label for="lis53rc" class="commentText"><p>How is this team by far better than two years ago? James Harden two years ago and PG now are retry equivalent. Maxey is better now, but not by much. Everyone wants to hate on Tobias, but he’s a better player than Caleb Martin against everyone except the Celtics. PJ was thought of as a great championship role player.</p>

<p>I think this year’s team is more talented, but is less likely to be healthy come playoff time.</p>

      <label for="lira3nr" class="commentText"><p>Yes. And the two main reasons it&rsquo;s better than 2019 are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Joel Embiid was not an MVP level player in 2019. He was a dominant two-way player and definitely got votes, but not the player he has been for the past four years. He&rsquo;s basically been a consensus top three player since 2020-2021 and until last year finished second or first in MVP voting during that time.</p></li>

<li><p>The 2019 team was not nearly as good of a fit. Even if you think Butler in 2019 is a better player than George in 2024 (and the numbers don&rsquo;t make that an easy statement to make) he&rsquo;s a MUCH worse fit. The talent that Ben (at the time) and Jimmy had just raised the team&rsquo;s ceiling. But Jimmy would go weeks without attempting a three. We know about Ben and shooting. Joel basically only had Redick to space the floor.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This year&rsquo;s squad has two of the top three off dribble and off catch three point shooters in the league in Maxey and George. And George also still has the ability to be a decent primary scorer, high level secondary scorer, or absolutely elite tertiary scorer. While Maxey should be able to play more off-ball and shoot off the catch more where he&rsquo;s, again, elite. Add the depth with Martin and Oubre and you got a team. Just gotta hope the big fella can stay healthy.</p>

      <label for="lircoex" class="commentText"><p>Yes definitely. Absolutely no excuses this year, he’s had several very good teams around him and still has not made it out of the second round, I would not be surprised if the ECF ends up being NYK/Boston. Embiid really needs to beat the choker allegations; he was the only person on the USMNT to not make it out of the second round and so far is the only MVP ever to not make it out.</p>

      <label for="lir1vqk" class="commentText"><p>They did not have great shooting at all, they had Redick (a great shooter) and Tobi (an ok shooter). Butler isn&rsquo;t a shooter, Simmons obviously never could shoot, and Embiid was primarily a back to the basket post player at this point in his career. Only Mike Scott could shoot off the bench, and that bench was terrible, none of them would&rsquo;ve played on a normal contender.</p>

<p>Drummond is a good rebounder and solid backup for Embiid but Yabusele was out the league for a reason. He’s a 6’8 post player whose game doesn’t work in the league. Basically smaller Monroe. You have a lot of bad defensive guards and no backup wings which is a big problem</p>

      <label for="lireh0u" class="commentText"><p>I’m so confused by what you’re saying about the bench. We’re probably not trotting out all bench lineups. Last year one of Maxey and Joel were always on the floor, add in PG and there’s more flexibility. Things will be staggered.</p>

<p>When Maxey is on the bench PG and Joel can play, or PG and Maxey can play when Joel is on the bench. Not to mention the versatility of Caleb Martin, and Kelly Oubre. And we can see what an improved Yabusele can bring to the squad. There’s so many good lineups you can make with a mix of starters and bench players.</p>

<p>And the injury thing is always a concern. Of course the bench won’t work if the best players are injured or out. But this is all on paper anyway and none of it matters until the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="lirgbr2" class="commentText"><p>All you’re saying is you have to keep multiple starters in to balance out the weak bench. You can’t run Maxey with two other small guards and can’t play Embiid with Drummond so you can’t run a mostly bench lineup. You can go maybe 8 deep most nights which is not a good  or deep bench</p>

<p>The 2019 could do the same thing and stagger Embiid, Butler and Simmons. It’s no different.</p>

<p>It’s does matter before the playoffs because two of your stars are injury prone. There’s a big difference between home court and the play in and the bench will play a role in regular season wins assuming the stars aren’t very healthy</p>

      <label for="liraaaw" class="commentText"><p>Jackson shouldn&rsquo;t really get playoff minutes, he&rsquo;s just there to fill in minutes during the regular season. Lowry is ok on defense still, very smart, draws charges, even if he&rsquo;s lost a step. Gordon&rsquo;s a negative on defense but at least provides high quality shooting. Sixers would be far from the first contender to have playoff bench pieces that are a negative defensively, anyways. Drummond is a good backup big, though a lot of backup bigs can get played off the court in certain matchups. Plus, Sixers also have a bunch of picks and a moveable contract in KJ Martin to acquire a bench wing.</p>

<p>Not saying the bench is amazing, but it&rsquo;s a pretty clear upgrade over the 2019 bench, those guys were literal 0 way players.</p>

<p>Gordon: 8/2/1 on 51% TS
Lowry: 7/4/4 on 54% TS
Jackson: 4/1/1 on 43% TS
Drummond and Yubesele didn’t play</p>

<p>2019 playoff stats:</p>

<p>Ennis: 8/4/1 on 57% TS
Scott: 6/3/1 on 59% TS
Boban (he played more minutes than Monroe: 6/3/1 on 66% TS</p>

<p>Look the 2019 team had a weak bench but I just don’t see how this years is any better. Lowry will be 39, Gordon 36, Jackson 35, and Drummond 31 when the playoffs start so you shouldn’t expect improvement from last year, and all were pretty garbage in the playoffs (except Drummond obviously). You say 2019 had 0 way players but the evidence suggest this years teams has a bunch of 0 way players as well</p>

      <label for="lirvsja" class="commentText"><p>The regular season numbers and roles clearly show the bench players the Sixers have played significantly better last year than the 2019 bench did for the Sixers. Playoff series are small sample sizes, especially for bench players who receive spot minutes. Even someone who played a good amount of minutes like Lowry makes one more 3 and he&rsquo;s at 58% TS instead of 54%. And it completely ignores the context in which they play. Lowry was forced to play in a starting role against a solid Knicks team in his only series and Gordon played his only series against the best defense in the league, while the 2019 players played on a roster where they came off the bench, had a series against a mediocre Nets team, and played more minutes in garbage time as well.</p>

<p>And yeah Jackson sucks, but he&rsquo;s a 3rd string guard on this team. Not sure why you included him, considering I just told you he&rsquo;s just there as a regular season guard.</p>

<p>The fact you&rsquo;re including Boban is hilarious, he got DNP&rsquo;d in game 7 of the Toronto series for a reason. Most of his scoring was against the 6 seed Nets who the Sixers comfortably beat regardless, and most of his scoring that he did in that Toronto series was in garbage time. I think even you know that was a bullshit inclusion, he&rsquo;s a basketball meme.</p>

<p>The evidence doesn&rsquo;t show anything like that because defense is barely reflected in box scores, and doesn&rsquo;t capture everything on offense either. How are you going to tell if someone is a bad defender or not through stat lines, particularly for perimeter players who don&rsquo;t generate tons of steals/blocks? I&rsquo;ve actually watched most of these players, while you&rsquo;re relying on box scores to tell you everything.</p>

<p>The only playable shooter on that 2019 bench was Mike Scott, and he was a bad defender and had terrible decision making. Gordon is comparable to him stat wise but has more playoff experience and has a tougher shot diet from 3, he can launch from well above the break. Ennis was primarily a transition and cutter guy, shot on very low volume and didn&rsquo;t shoot well for the Sixers, and was a mediocre defender at best. Lowry is a better shooter, also has more playoff experience, and is a much better playmaker. Drummond has been one of the best backup bigs in the league for a while who dominates the glass, Boban was nothing more than a fun 3rd string big to watch who was exposed if the opponent ran a pick and roll.</p>

      <label for="lis6023" class="commentText"><p>You’re the one who specifically brought up the playoffs. Now you’re saying those stats don’t matter.</p>

<p>To compare regular season benches you aren’t even looking at the right players. For example Mcconell played in 76 games and Monroe played in 3.</p>

<p>You say the Twolves defense was elite but what about the Raptors defense that won a title?</p>

<p>Backup bigs get DNPs all the time in the playoffs, most of them are matchup dependent and that applied to Boban, and Monroe. Boban literally played more minutes in the playoffs so if that’s a bullshit inclusion so is Monroe.</p>

<p>I never said anything about box scores regarding their defense. I’ve watched Lowry for years on the Heat, and Gordon and Jackson are well established players who I’ve also seen play plenty of times. They are all poor defenders. Drummond can be decent but it depends on the matchup. I don’t disagree with you about the 2019 bench being poor defenders either. Boban was definitely a bad defender, and the others weren’t good, although I have seen McConnell play good defense when he’s not at a huge size disadvantage</p>

      <label for="lis9r4w" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m saying small playoff sample sizes will have issues if you take the numbers from those series and act like that&rsquo;s who they are all the time. Is Lowry a 33% shooter like he was in the Knicks series, or is he an above average shooter like he has been throughout his career typically? Is Caleb Martin actually a near 20 ppg scorer like he was against the Celtics in 2023? The answer is obvious, don&rsquo;t be obtuse. You have to look at the bench players who played in the playoffs, take into account both their regular season production and postseason production, and see what role they played on the team on the whole.</p>

<p>I literally have not talked about Monroe at all. TJ was unplayable against the Raptors like I said. He would&rsquo;ve been decent against some other teams I think, and was actually very good against the Celtics in the previous year, but the Raptors were a very bad matchup for him. TJ had no chance in the Raptors series and his size is pretty much always an issue anyways, playoff teams love to pick on small guards who are bad defenders and switch wings onto them.</p>

<p>The Raptors defense was elite, but they played against the Raptors for <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> games those playoffs and played against the Nets for <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> games, compared to <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> games for Gordon who only played against Minnesota. Your numbers are going to be worse if you face an amazing defense the entire time. Ennis was not a positive offensive player even if his numbers in a select 11 games were passable, he didn&rsquo;t space the floor, create, screen, or playmake.</p>

<p>Boban didn&rsquo;t play actual minutes. He played minutes against a low seed and garbage time. The bullshit inclusion is you acting like he played well by using those numbers, even though anyone actually watching the series at the time would tell you he&rsquo;s unplayable against good playoff teams. Drummond is easily better than him, but I could definitely see Drummond potentially getting played off the floor against certain teams. However, Boban gets played off the floor by pretty much any good team.</p>

<p>You literally spouted a bunch of box score numbers and then came to the conclusion that the &ldquo;this years teams has a bunch of 0 way players&rdquo;. Lowry is a fine defender, bit slow on ball but good team defender that generates charges. Again, no idea why you keep bringing up Jackson, he&rsquo;s a third string guard, I&rsquo;m not talking about Furkan Korkmaz here. You have no idea about the 2019 bench so you just defaulted to agreeing lmao.</p>

<p>Sixers at best can trade their 2029, 2030, and 2031 firsts (or pick swap 30 and trade 2029 and 2031) with a 2026 first (least favorable from LAC, Houston, or OKC) and a 2028 first from LAC and 7 2nds starting in 2027. They can&rsquo;t use their 2026 and 2028 picks in pick swaps (due to decaying protections) until the 2025 and 2027 picks have conveyed.</p>

<p>The most you guys can get is a 8 mil wing with Martin&rsquo;s contract, Sixers are above first apron and cannot take back more money than they send out + no S&amp;Ts and no trade exceptions.</p>

      <label for="lir2q0y" class="commentText"><p>Exactly.  Anyone who says the current roster is better has no clue.  They had a similar talent set except all their players were in their prime instead of in their mid to late 30s.</p>

<p>Obviously the current team has experience and that 2019 failed due to lack of experience though. Do I think Playoff P and Eric Gordon are going to get them past the Celtics in the Playoffs? No</p>

      <label for="lir9y7v" class="commentText"><p>2019 obviously, but also 2023 was really good with Harden and Maxey. Harris, Tucker, and Melton were all solid contributors that season. Their deeper bench was full of veterans and complimentary players. It was actually a pretty well-rounded group and they came super-close to taking down the Celtics if not for a couple of epic Jayson Tatum performances in games 6 and 7.</p>

Playoff time he was literally left all alone in the corner with Robert Williams hard doubling Embiid all over the court because PJ was just that washed. Won&rsquo;t even touch on Tobias being a solid contributor</p>

<p>Tatum also had an alltime bad game 6 shooting <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>21</sub> out there, this comment is all kinds of inaccurate</p>

      <label for="lirz5vq" class="commentText"><p>Tatum was awful for the first 3 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> quarters of game 6, but literally had one of the best closings to a 4th quarters ever. He went off to end that game and carried it into an incredible game 7 performance all around.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to believe it, but that was a really good Sixers team. Excellent top end talent and solid role players to fill in around them. There is no guarantee they are better this year than they were then.</p>

      <label for="lirke1l" class="commentText"><p>When you consider Embiid&rsquo;s on growth, yes. He&rsquo;s a drastically better player than he was in 2019.</p>

<p>The pieces also fit better offensively. Simmons was a terrible fit for obvious reasons, but Harris was also a PF who didn&rsquo;t want to shoot as many 3s as he should&rsquo;ve. Jimmy was awesome, but he&rsquo;s also very reluctant to space the floor.</p>

<p>Maxey and PG are lights out shooters. Paul George led all forwards in C&amp;S 3PT% at 45.4%, and was third across all positions. Fifth across all positions and sitting right behind Steph Curry in the rankings? Tyrese Maxey.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I also think this East is fucking awesome at the top. I take the top of the East over the top of the West, the West is just significantly deeper.</p>

      <label for="lir3zzt" class="commentText"><p>Everything else has the analysis of hindsight&ndash;injuries to Embiid and others&ndash;to soften the expectations. George could get hurt in January, miss the postseason, and everyone saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to this would be pretty good and well wrong.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say this is his most talented roster&ndash;having guys like Harden and Butler are pretty good, and they were younger than George is now. Probably the one objective advantage is that he&rsquo;s not being coached by Doc Rivers.</p>

You&rsquo;re looking at Jimmy Butler with 2024 eyes and he was comfortably like the 4th option on that team unless he was closing or it was the playoffs. The bench was nobody.</p>

<p>Talent wise, yes that was the best team if we ignore the bench. Fit wise, on paper, this is the best situation he&rsquo;s had. But again, it&rsquo;s on paper. We could find out that for some reason Embiid/Maxey/George can&rsquo;t play together. They could still have serious rebounding issues and the trade deadline could be a dud for them. But on paper, it&rsquo;s the best team they&rsquo;ve had in a very long time</p>

      <label for="lis3wbo" class="commentText"><p>As a very critical Sixers fan.   Yes,  very much so.  This is the most “nba veteran” filled roster we’ve had.  Morey had his first offseason to actually build a team in his vision.   People overrated the hell out of the 2019 team because of Jimmy’s presence.</p>

<p>No more Tobias 40 million giving us limited cap flexibility and trade options.</p>

      <label for="lirrsl0" class="commentText"><p>it’s better than last year but honestly still not great imo.</p>

<p>PG will be 35 by the postseason. their roster still lacks playmaking - the best passer they have is Lowry who’s a 6’0” guard that’s going to be 39 in March. PG is a decent playmaker but Clippers fans can tell you he is not great as a primary initiator, and at age 23 going into Year 5 idk if Maxey is quite ready for that burden either. ditto for McCain who’s a rookie. maybe they’ll be okay splitting those duties but Embiid’s biggest weakness aside from injuries has always been diagnosing and passing from double teams. they really need to maximize their playmaking, and I don’t see an elite or even very good one on their roster right now like they had in previous years with guys like Simmons, Harden or Butler.</p>

<p>figuring out a backup 5 for Embiid has been a problem for Philly since before most of this sub was even born. they brought back Drummond (31) and he’s prob the best Embiid backup Philly has had, but I don’t think he’s playable in the playoffs, just too easy to exploit defensively.</p>

<p>I’m not really a fan of the role players they have. Gordon (35) and Reggie (34) are old and inconsistent players who aren’t great defenders. Caleb Martin loves cooking the Celtics but at the core he’s a good defensive wing with bad handles and a janky jumpshot who prob benefited from Spo maximizing him (another problem, Martin along with PG and maybe Council are the only decent wing defenders they have). Oubre is an inconsistent scoring wing with questionable defensive chops and IQ. RoCo barely even played last year on a thin Philly roster and he’s 33. Yabusele is a fun gamble but he’s a complete wild card, no clue if he’ll be in the rotation or warming the bench. btw, I haven’t listed a single good rebounder among these role players other than Drummond who’s obviously unplayable next to Embiid, and Yabusele who I just mentioned.</p>

<p>my main problem with them is they have a lot of vets who are past their prime, and a few guys who look like solid prospects (Council, KJ, Bona and McCain), but the only guys who look like definite starters for them in their actual primes are Embiid and Maxey. look at how many guys I discussed above are on the wrong side of 30.</p>

<p>Maxey, Oubre, George, ????, Embiid.</p>

<p>Do you slide George to PF and start Caleb Martin at SF? Is Yabusele starting PF? </p>

<p>For center rotation, you got Embiid and Drummond, then rookie Adem Bona. What happens when Embiid rests or gets hurt?</p>

<p>Who knows what shape Covington will be in, or if KJ Martin can contribute real minutes (I’m doubtful). I just think size is going to be a problem, and Embiid/PG are going to have a huge defensive load.</p>
