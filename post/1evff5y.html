</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I say best situation and not just roster when including coaching and team chemistry.</p>

<p>With Butler and Prime Harris you could argue that Sixers squad had more top end talent but when you look at the overall rotation, I think it can be said this is the best team Embiid will have ever played with. PG is their third option.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a bit skeptical of Oubre myself, but can&rsquo;t argue he had some of the best basketball in a winning environment of his career last season. Yabusele&rsquo;s translation back to NBA ball will be a question, but from his International team play to the Olympics and play for France, the things he&rsquo;s done well are things he&rsquo;s doing consistently in all environments and important skills for what the Sixers need at that 4 spot.</p>

<p>They have depth, they have shooting, they have size, and they have more than two guys who can create shots for themselves. On paper, I think this is the best team Embiid has ever had to play with. What do you all think?</p>

      <label for="lir0sdg" class="commentText"><p>This is not the best team embiid has had around him, but it is the best team because this embiid is better than 2019 embiid by alot.. So if you take both embiids out, the 2019 roster (i think right year?) is probably better, with jimmy, Tobias still good, Simmons being labeled as the next lebron.. JJ redick was lights out,</p>

      <label for="liraza8" class="commentText"><p>The 18-19 team may have been more talented, but the fit was terrible. Their best lineup included Embiid, Simmons, and Butler, and while they are (or were) all excellent defensively, their three point shooting ranged from below average to non-existent. It’s hard to consistently create offense with that kind of spacing</p>

<p>As an aside, the defense was worse than I remembered. 14th in DRTG, so overall they were only 11th in net rating that season.</p>

I remembered the starting lineup being good, but pretty much any combination of lineup involving the bench must&rsquo;ve been pretty bad then, because that&rsquo;s a huge dropoff overall.</p>

<p>And yeah I know that Embiid stat, but I still was pretty disappointed in his offensive performance when I watched the series.</p>

<p>I agree 100% about Maxey. He&rsquo;s a point guard on paper but he needs to learn to look for the open man when he&rsquo;s driving to the rim. Was frustrating to watch him try to finish against 3 Knick defenders in the playoffs. I know he&rsquo;s really fucking good at getting to the rim but if you&rsquo;ve got 3 guys trying to stop you there&rsquo;s going to be an open kick out 3 pointer somewhere and good point guards find that guy. Right now he&rsquo;s more of a pure scorer than a distributor. That&rsquo;s the next step forward he needs to make.</p>

      <label for="lir10c0" class="commentText"><p>This is by far the best situation and best team he’s had. I think the Sixers have been contenders in 3 seasons one was the Jimmy year, the next was the Simmons melt down year, and the last was the second Harden year when they were up 3-2 on the Celtics.</p>

<p>This is the best team and probably the best coach and it doesn’t include Tobias.</p>

      <label for="lirugmm" class="commentText"><p>The Jimmy year was terrible. The bench was bad. The fit was bad. Embiid himself was not the force he is today. I think they were only real contenders in the 2nd Harden year. I respect the Heat and the Heat culture but being 3-2 up vs the Celtics is probably the only time they were favorites to reach the finals. We could&rsquo;ve had a Jokic vs Embiid finals matchup (although the Nuggets were more ready for a championship at that point).</p>

      <label for="liu6ot6" class="commentText"><p>The thing is they were gonna face the mighty Warriors if they did reach the finals. That&rsquo;s if they beat the Bucks and Giannis in the ECF. Embiid was good but not the scoring machine he is today. That is if they ever made it past Kawhi. With the Cs, the road to the finals was one win against a team having an off year. Embiid was clearly the best player playing in the playoffs that year. Reigning MVP and he had Harden who was great in 2 games but shite in 3. I feel like the 6ers in 2019 look much better today because of how much Jimmy and Embiid have accomplished since then.</p>

<p>I agree Kawhi went straightup MJ mode and gave me nightmares, but Embiid was +86 in that series.</p>

<p>In game 7, he was +10 and played over 45min. Greg Monroe went -9 in 01:41.</p>

<p>Same reason I don’t think there’s a player alive who could win with even prime Westbrook. If you think about it, Westbrooks offensive game is basically Ben Simmons with Kobe’s confidence. Both were freak athletes that never really developed any actual basketball skills, the difference is Ben will not shoot, Russ cannot shoot but will always make sure to take the most shots on the team while the defense basically cheers him on and begs him to shoot and he’ll shoot like 30% ts wide open.</p>

      <label for="lit9enl" class="commentText"><p>I largely agree but like actual prime Westbrook was only a reasonable amount below league average efficiency and could make free throws, and I think they coulda made some kinda championship run if they kept harden and had other actual spacers on the team. </p>

<p>If I was starting from scratch and trying to build a championship team tho, I wouldn&rsquo;t want a player like him anywhere near it. It’s similar how I feel about Sabonis. Incredibly talented and pretty fun player, it’s just that having a center who’s poor defensively just makes building a really good team so much more complicated.</p>

Imagine how good the thunder would have been if they traded Russ for a haul before everyone figured out he was never going to develop, like at all, and kept harden. Prime kd and harden with some solid role players that aren’t gonna take 30 shots a game when they can’t shoot for shit would’ve destroyed the league and then kd never leaves.</p>

<p>He was just slightly below average a couple seasons, but you also have to remember that a huge portion of those were basically uncontested shots.</p>

      <label for="lirke1l" class="commentText"><p>When you consider Embiid&rsquo;s on growth, yes. He&rsquo;s a drastically better player than he was in 2019.</p>

<p>The pieces also fit better offensively. Simmons was a terrible fit for obvious reasons, but Harris was also a PF who didn&rsquo;t want to shoot as many 3s as he should&rsquo;ve. Jimmy was awesome, but he&rsquo;s also very reluctant to space the floor.</p>

<p>Maxey and PG are lights out shooters. Paul George led all forwards in C&amp;S 3PT% at 45.4%, and was third across all positions. Fifth across all positions and sitting right behind Steph Curry in the rankings? Tyrese Maxey.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I also think this East is fucking awesome at the top. I take the top of the East over the top of the West, the West is just significantly deeper.</p>

      <label for="lira3nr" class="commentText"><p>Yes. And the two main reasons it&rsquo;s better than 2019 are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Joel Embiid was not an MVP level player in 2019. He was a dominant two-way player and definitely got votes, but not the player he has been for the past four years. He&rsquo;s basically been a consensus top three player since 2020-2021 and until last year finished second or first in MVP voting during that time.</p></li>

<li><p>The 2019 team was not nearly as good of a fit. Even if you think Butler in 2019 is a better player than George in 2024 (and the numbers don&rsquo;t make that an easy statement to make) he&rsquo;s a MUCH worse fit. The talent that Ben (at the time) and Jimmy had just raised the team&rsquo;s ceiling. But Jimmy would go weeks without attempting a three. We know about Ben and shooting. Joel basically only had Redick to space the floor.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This year&rsquo;s squad has two of the top three off dribble and off catch three point shooters in the league in Maxey and George. And George also still has the ability to be a decent primary scorer, high level secondary scorer, or absolutely elite tertiary scorer. While Maxey should be able to play more off-ball and shoot off the catch more where he&rsquo;s, again, elite. Add the depth with Martin and Oubre and you got a team. Just gotta hope the big fella can stay healthy.</p>

Absolutely no excuses this year, he’s had several very good teams around him and still has not made it out of the second round, I would not be surprised if the ECF ends up being NYK/Boston. Embiid really needs to beat the choker allegations; he was the only person on the USMNT to not make it out of the second round and so far is the only MVP ever to not make it out.</p>

      <label for="liraaaw" class="commentText"><p>Jackson shouldn&rsquo;t really get playoff minutes, he&rsquo;s just there to fill in minutes during the regular season. Lowry is ok on defense still, very smart, draws charges, even if he&rsquo;s lost a step. Gordon&rsquo;s a negative on defense but at least provides high quality shooting. Sixers would be far from the first contender to have playoff bench pieces that are a negative defensively, anyways. Drummond is a good backup big, though a lot of backup bigs can get played off the court in certain matchups. Plus, Sixers also have a bunch of picks and a moveable contract in KJ Martin to acquire a bench wing.</p>

<p>Not saying the bench is amazing, but it&rsquo;s a pretty clear upgrade over the 2019 bench, those guys were literal 0 way players.</p>

<p>Gordon: 8/2/1 on 51% TS
Lowry: 7/4/4 on 54% TS
Jackson: 4/1/1 on 43% TS
Drummond and Yubesele didn’t play</p>

<p>2019 playoff stats:</p>

<p>Ennis: 8/4/1 on 57% TS
Scott: 6/3/1 on 59% TS
Boban (he played more minutes than Monroe: 6/3/1 on 66% TS</p>

<p>Look the 2019 team had a weak bench but I just don’t see how this years is any better. Lowry will be 39, Gordon 36, Jackson 35, and Drummond 31 when the playoffs start so you shouldn’t expect improvement from last year, and all were pretty garbage in the playoffs (except Drummond obviously). You say 2019 had 0 way players but the evidence suggest this years teams has a bunch of 0 way players as well</p>

      <label for="lirvsja" class="commentText"><p>The regular season numbers and roles clearly show the bench players the Sixers have played significantly better last year than the 2019 bench did for the Sixers. Playoff series are small sample sizes, especially for bench players who receive spot minutes. Even someone who played a good amount of minutes like Lowry makes one more 3 and he&rsquo;s at 58% TS instead of 54%. And it completely ignores the context in which they play. Lowry was forced to play in a starting role against a solid Knicks team in his only series and Gordon played his only series against the best defense in the league, while the 2019 players played on a roster where they came off the bench, had a series against a mediocre Nets team, and played more minutes in garbage time as well.</p>

<p>And yeah Jackson sucks, but he&rsquo;s a 3rd string guard on this team. Not sure why you included him, considering I just told you he&rsquo;s just there as a regular season guard.</p>

<p>The fact you&rsquo;re including Boban is hilarious, he got DNP&rsquo;d in game 7 of the Toronto series for a reason. Most of his scoring was against the 6 seed Nets who the Sixers comfortably beat regardless, and most of his scoring that he did in that Toronto series was in garbage time. I think even you know that was a bullshit inclusion, he&rsquo;s a basketball meme.</p>

<p>The evidence doesn&rsquo;t show anything like that because defense is barely reflected in box scores, and doesn&rsquo;t capture everything on offense either. How are you going to tell if someone is a bad defender or not through stat lines, particularly for perimeter players who don&rsquo;t generate tons of steals/blocks? I&rsquo;ve actually watched most of these players, while you&rsquo;re relying on box scores to tell you everything.</p>

<p>The only playable shooter on that 2019 bench was Mike Scott, and he was a bad defender and had terrible decision making. Gordon is comparable to him stat wise but has more playoff experience and has a tougher shot diet from 3, he can launch from well above the break. Ennis was primarily a transition and cutter guy, shot on very low volume and didn&rsquo;t shoot well for the Sixers, and was a mediocre defender at best. Lowry is a better shooter, also has more playoff experience, and is a much better playmaker. Drummond has been one of the best backup bigs in the league for a while who dominates the glass, Boban was nothing more than a fun 3rd string big to watch who was exposed if the opponent ran a pick and roll.</p>

      <label for="lir3zzt" class="commentText"><p>Everything else has the analysis of hindsight&ndash;injuries to Embiid and others&ndash;to soften the expectations. George could get hurt in January, miss the postseason, and everyone saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to this would be pretty good and well wrong.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say this is his most talented roster&ndash;having guys like Harden and Butler are pretty good, and they were younger than George is now. Probably the one objective advantage is that he&rsquo;s not being coached by Doc Rivers.</p>

      <label for="lir9y7v" class="commentText"><p>2019 obviously, but also 2023 was really good with Harden and Maxey. Harris, Tucker, and Melton were all solid contributors that season. Their deeper bench was full of veterans and complimentary players. It was actually a pretty well-rounded group and they came super-close to taking down the Celtics if not for a couple of epic Jayson Tatum performances in games 6 and 7.</p>

Playoff time he was literally left all alone in the corner with Robert Williams hard doubling Embiid all over the court because PJ was just that washed. Won&rsquo;t even touch on Tobias being a solid contributor</p>

<p>Tatum also had an alltime bad game 6 shooting <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>21</sub> out there, this comment is all kinds of inaccurate</p>

      <label for="lis1wgw" class="commentText"><p>A lot of people are going to say the 18-19 team and I feel like we may have selective memory on how bad the fit of that team was. It was just going out and getting names and not worrying about how they would all play together. You&rsquo;re looking at Jimmy Butler with 2024 eyes and he was comfortably like the 4th option on that team unless he was closing or it was the playoffs. The bench was nobody.</p>

<p>Talent wise, yes that was the best team if we ignore the bench. Fit wise, on paper, this is the best situation he&rsquo;s had. But again, it&rsquo;s on paper. We could find out that for some reason Embiid/Maxey/George can&rsquo;t play together. They could still have serious rebounding issues and the trade deadline could be a dud for them. But on paper, it&rsquo;s the best team they&rsquo;ve had in a very long time</p>

      <label for="lit3os3" class="commentText"><p>No lmao. They let harden go for no reason when he was down to take less money, then they lost to us with a total point differential of one, if they just kept harden they probably would’ve been in the conference finals last year. Instead they effectively punted on a year of embiids prime, but also the year he played the best he ever has.</p>

<p>So they’re in full on desperation mode to give embiid something to work with. It’s not a coincidence that pg had his most efficient season ever at 34 the one year he played with harden. He’s never going to look as good as last year again.</p>

<p>They’re basically betting on three things, embiid stays healthy, maxey can develop into a pure pg (I love maxey but he’s not yet), and PG not declining at all. All of those things have to come true, that’s terrible odds. Plus harden will actually play every game while PG is injury prone. Also with embiid being injury prone, harden could actually keep them afloat when he was out, PG can’t.</p>

<p>Also it might take a couple months but PG is eventually going to demand they run the offense through him more and let him iso. Like that is going to happen.</p>

<p>It’s better than having no harden and max Tobias though</p>

      <label for="lir5yaa" class="commentText"><p>All they did was swap Tobias Harris for Paul George, who’s 34 years old now and is injury prone/has a history of disappearing in the playoffs lol. It’s not like they signed Kawhi or even prime Harden to a max contract this offseason, it’s literally just Paul George. 2019 and 2023 Sixers were better than this year’s Sixers.</p>

Maxey just had a phenomenal season and now he’s the third option. No way he’ll just be happy about that. I bet it’ll be a locker room disaster.</p>

      <label for="lirrsl0" class="commentText"><p>it’s better than last year but honestly still not great imo.</p>

<p>PG will be 35 by the postseason. their roster still lacks playmaking - the best passer they have is Lowry who’s a 6’0” guard that’s going to be 39 in March. PG is a decent playmaker but Clippers fans can tell you he is not great as a primary initiator, and at age 23 going into Year 5 idk if Maxey is quite ready for that burden either. ditto for McCain who’s a rookie. maybe they’ll be okay splitting those duties but Embiid’s biggest weakness aside from injuries has always been diagnosing and passing from double teams. they really need to maximize their playmaking, and I don’t see an elite or even very good one on their roster right now like they had in previous years with guys like Simmons, Harden or Butler.</p>

<p>figuring out a backup 5 for Embiid has been a problem for Philly since before most of this sub was even born. they brought back Drummond (31) and he’s prob the best Embiid backup Philly has had, but I don’t think he’s playable in the playoffs, just too easy to exploit defensively.</p>

<p>I’m not really a fan of the role players they have. Gordon (35) and Reggie (34) are old and inconsistent players who aren’t great defenders. Caleb Martin loves cooking the Celtics but at the core he’s a good defensive wing with bad handles and a janky jumpshot who prob benefited from Spo maximizing him (another problem, Martin along with PG and maybe Council are the only decent wing defenders they have). Oubre is an inconsistent scoring wing with questionable defensive chops and IQ. RoCo barely even played last year on a thin Philly roster and he’s 33. Yabusele is a fun gamble but he’s a complete wild card, no clue if he’ll be in the rotation or warming the bench. btw, I haven’t listed a single good rebounder among these role players other than Drummond who’s obviously unplayable next to Embiid, and Yabusele who I just mentioned.</p>

<p>my main problem with them is they have a lot of vets who are past their prime, and a few guys who look like solid prospects (Council, KJ, Bona and McCain), but the only guys who look like definite starters for them in their actual primes are Embiid and Maxey. look at how many guys I discussed above are on the wrong side of 30.</p>

      <label for="liucwm7" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s actually a decent question, it&rsquo;s hard to say really until we see how good Paul George still is. I have some questions about our depth too, it&rsquo;s just a complete overhaul of the team and it feels like we&rsquo;re light at some positions.</p>

<p>Injury risks aside, the three star thing we have going on is quite balanced. A point guard, a wing and a center. In theory it should work really well. I want to see Paul George on defense though we have desperately needed wing defenders forever. Trading Mikal Bridges was a war crime.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really like Kyle Lowry as a backup. He&rsquo;s 39 for fucks sake he&rsquo;s not the guy he was. IDK why Morey loves old as fuck players, goddamn PJ Tucker couldn&rsquo;t move his old ass out of the corner if he wanted to.</p>

Embiid was still raw as hell, there was genuinely no bench (we didn’t play TJ McConnell for some reason), and Simmons didn’t peak yet (that was next year). Butler averaged like 18 ppg and, notably, was not the defender we thought he’d be, while Harris and Redick where varying degrees of turnstiles. The defense was 14th in the league.</p>

<p>My favorite sixers team ever was the brief stint between the Butler and Harris trades. The Wilson Chandler era.</p>

<p>Do you slide George to PF and start Caleb Martin at SF? Is Yabusele starting PF? </p>

<p>For center rotation, you got Embiid and Drummond, then rookie Adem Bona. What happens when Embiid rests or gets hurt?</p>

<p>Who knows what shape Covington will be in, or if KJ Martin can contribute real minutes (I’m doubtful). I just think size is going to be a problem, and Embiid/PG are going to have a huge defensive load.</p>
