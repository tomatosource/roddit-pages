      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1evff5y/is_the_upcoming_202425_nba_season_the_best/"><p>Is the upcoming <sup>2024</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub> NBA season the best situation Joel Embiid has had surrounding him in Philadelphia?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I say best situation and not just roster when including coaching and team chemistry.</p>

<p>With Butler and Prime Harris you could argue that Sixers squad had more top end talent but when you look at the overall rotation, I think it can be said this is the best team Embiid will have ever played with. PG is their third option.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a bit skeptical of Oubre myself, but can&rsquo;t argue he had some of the best basketball in a winning environment of his career last season. Yabusele&rsquo;s translation back to NBA ball will be a question, but from his International team play to the Olympics and play for France, the things he&rsquo;s done well are things he&rsquo;s doing consistently in all environments and important skills for what the Sixers need at that 4 spot.</p>

<p>They have depth, they have shooting, they have size, and they have more than two guys who can create shots for themselves. On paper, I think this is the best team Embiid has ever had to play with. What do you all think?</p>

      <label for="lir10c0" class="commentText"><p>This is by far the best situation and best team he’s had. I think the Sixers have been contenders in 3 seasons one was the Jimmy year, the next was the Simmons melt down year, and the last was the second Harden year when they were up 3-2 on the Celtics.</p>

<p>This is the best team and probably the best coach and it doesn’t include Tobias.</p>

      <label for="lir0sdg" class="commentText"><p>This is not the best team embiid has had around him, but it is the best team because this embiid is better than 2019 embiid by alot.. So if you take both embiids out, the 2019 roster (i think right year?) is probably better, with jimmy, Tobias still good, Simmons being labeled as the next lebron.. JJ redick was lights out,</p>

Only Mike Scott could shoot off the bench, and that bench was terrible, none of them would&rsquo;ve played on a normal contender.</p>

<p>Drummond is a good rebounder but Yabusele was out the league for a reason. He’s a 6’8 post player whose game doesn’t work in the league. Basically smaller Monroe. You have a lot of bad defensive guards and no backup wings which is a big problem</p>

      <label for="lir0nxe" class="commentText"><p>The <sup>18</sup>&frasl;<sub>19</sub> team was complete ass outside of the starting lineup. Washed Greg Monroe and Boban were Embiid’s backups. The 6th man was Mike Scott. People only remember the SI cover and the fact they took the champs to the brink</p>

      <label for="lir3zzt" class="commentText"><p>Everything else has the analysis of hindsight&ndash;injuries to Embiid and others&ndash;to soften the expectations. George could get hurt in January, miss the postseason, and everyone saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to this would be pretty good and well wrong.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say this is his most talented roster&ndash;having guys like Harden and Butler are pretty good, and they were younger than George is now. Probably the one objective advantage is that he&rsquo;s not being coached by Doc Rivers.</p>

      <label for="lir5yaa" class="commentText"><p>All they did was swap Tobias Harris for Paul George, who’s 34 years old now and is injury prone/has a history of disappearing in the playoffs lol. It’s not like they signed Kawhi or even Harden to a max contract this offseason. 2019 and 2023 Sixers were better than this year’s Sixers.</p>

      <label for="lir4b8x" class="commentText"><p>So what’s the starting lineup?</p>

<p>Maxey, Oubre, George, ????, Embiid.</p>

<p>Do you slide George to PF and start Caleb Martin at SF? Is Yabusele starting PF? </p>

<p>For center rotation, you got Embiid and Drummond, then rookie Adem Bona. What happens when Embiid rests or gets hurt?</p>

<p>Who knows what shape Covington will be in, or if KJ Martin can contribute real minutes (I’m doubtful). I just think size is going to be a problem, and Embiid/PG are going to have a huge defensive load.</p>
