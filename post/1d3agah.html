      <label for="l66wdrw" class="commentText"><p>As a Slomo apologist I&rsquo;m so happy for him right now. At the beginning of this series they were literally daring him to shoot, like the Mavs defense was almost clearing the way for him. But despite a very poor shooting season he made them pay and forced them to go back to actually defending him. He&rsquo;s really stepped it up in this series especially.</p>

      <label for="l663e0e" class="commentText"><p>It may be naivety, but I truly do believe Minnesota can at least have this series extend to Monday. Looking at the box score, nothing that <em>they did</em> jumps out as being an outlier. Maybe KAT missing only 4 shots isn&rsquo;t sustainable, but 25 points isn&rsquo;t an insane output from him. Ant had 29, but he wasn&rsquo;t the most efficient. McDaniels, Naz and NAW hit timely shots, but they only combined for 22 points. In fact, Hardy scored one point fewer for Dallas off the bench than all of the Wolves&rsquo; bench. There were still plenty of silly mistakes and fouls, yet they still held on. For them, I don&rsquo;t think anything was out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>For Dallas, maybe you say that Kyrie doesn&rsquo;t shoot that poorly again. Putting Jaden on him instead of Ant may have been a decision made a game or two late, but his length really disrupts Kyrie. Luka was always going to get his, so putting Ant on him and not having him chase Kyrie all game saved his legs. The rest of the starts apart from Luka didn&rsquo;t shoot great either, apart from the Landlord of course. No Lively II out there absolutely made a difference, and maybe he is the difference between this being a sweep or not, we&rsquo;ll find out on Thursday.</p>

<p>If Dallas doesn&rsquo;t win tomorrow, I think this goes seven. For some reason throughout these playoffs Minnesota plays better on the road, and I think if they can win Game 5, they have a really good chance to make it to seven. If that happens, Boston will be celebrating wildly, bc the last thing Dallas (or Minnesota) can afford is to have a dogfight of a 7 game series while Boston is chilling at home waiting for the victor.</p>

      <label for="l66554h" class="commentText"><p>Lively has hands.  Gafford is great on D but he’s a statue unless it’s a lob.</p>

<p>Minn knows that.</p>

<p>Kyrie being cold is insane given his performance this series.</p>

<p>This all comes down to the stars bc these teams have great benches.</p>

<p>If the 1 or 2 options on either team have a bad game, chances are it will go to the other team.  We’ve seen that every game.</p>

<p>I don’t think there is a secret to beating either of these teams except you can’t have your bench replace lackluster star performance. That bench needs to complement the star performance.</p>

<p>A hot shooting PJ, Naz or McDaniel cant replace the scoring of Ant or Kat or Kyrie.</p>

      <label for="l665a3s" class="commentText"><p>Oh trust me I know about Lively II, I&rsquo;m a Duke fan. Very happy for him, although he&rsquo;s doing this against my favorite player (Ant) 😂</p>

<p>The rest of what you said is spot on, although I think Minnesota has a slightly better supporting cast. It&rsquo;s not a secret that if Ant and KAT played better the first three games this series is tied at the very least. We&rsquo;ll see how sustainable it is for them to outplay or at least match Luka and Kyrie.</p>

      <label for="l66hj9g" class="commentText"><p>For me its the combo of KAT shooting 70%/80% while Kyrie shot 33%/16.7%. And Luka really didn&rsquo;t shoot well either &ndash; <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> from 3 is serviceable I guess, but he also shot 33% overall, and I really don&rsquo;t think the best scoring backcourt duo shooting 33% overall is something you should count on happening twice. Especially with PJ also shooting below 25% in the same game.</p>

      <label for="l682icz" class="commentText"><p>Agreed, I’m not sure this is the momentum swing people are making it out to be. Quiet nights for Kyrie + Luka, no Lively, KAT heating up and the Wolves <em>barely</em> close it out. Single losses against the Clips and Thunder didn’t really faze the momentum in those series. You have to acknowledge the guy that’s 14-1 in closeout games at this point</p>

      <label for="l67scaj" class="commentText"><p>Never in a game all season have Gobert, Kat and Ant all been in foul trouble. Wolves gave up 30 points off turnovers and shot <sup>16</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub> from the line. The only things that were normal this game were the defense and Ant’s energy. I don’t think you’re naive for thinking this.</p>

      <label for="l66m4gq" class="commentText"><p>Maybe this is a low-value add, as it is less about the game from a statistical perspective and more about it from an entertainment one.</p>

<p>This series has been so good, despite the Wolves not playing to the standard they set against the Nuggets. I am really hoping we get 3 more.</p>

<p>The games are close and entertaining but the last 4 or so minutes are excruciating when the game isn&rsquo;t a blowout. Foul baiting 3s that get rewarded based on the super star, fouling out of players than sometimes feels charitable, excessive FTs, and, in this particular game, taking several minutes to put .2 sec on the clock for what could only be described as an actual impossible to win scenario. The tough part is, I get it, this play is rewarded and sometimes results in a comeback, so why not try it?</p>

      <label for="l66ji6y" class="commentText"><p>Mavs stats from last night were pretty grim. Kyrie and Luka both shot 33% overall, PJ shot under 25%, and the only Mavs starter with a +/- above zero was DJJ at +3. Truly a miserable performance from the whole group. I would be shocked to see that happen twice, no matter how well the Wolves defend.</p>

      <label for="l6ac9yd" class="commentText"><p>Regardless of the collapse of the mavs stars, Minnesota won game 4 because lively wasn’t there. Lively locked up Ant and the rim and paint in general in the first 3 games. If he was there, Ant, KAT and Conley wouldn’t have been able to go downhill so easily, Lively would’ve easily prevented like 10-20 downhill points easily from them 3. Not to mention he’s much better offensively in terms of playmaking, screens, lobs, etc.
Lively is miles better than all of Dallas’s other bigs in terms of rim protection and offense. Mavs would have convincingly won Game 4 with lively. If he is out tomorrow, I think Minnesota will win.</p>

      <label for="l66rctz" class="commentText"><p>Yeah that&rsquo;s sort of my point. The games have been decided by which superstar duo shows up, and Lively can tip the scales if all 4 show up at once.</p>

      <label for="l66a0fb" class="commentText"><p>Missing lively for sure but I think we can absolutely close this team out as long as we get a good Luka/average Kyrie(or vice versa). The Timberwolves were playing defense like a team who’s season is about to end, so you gotta tip the hat. Having to adjust in game to not having our second big plus Maxi’s first return to play mid-WCF.. just added up to a bad night offensively. Our bench definitely heating up though. On to Minny, let’s go Mavs!</p>

      <label for="l66d38f" class="commentText"><p>FWIW I would say this game&rsquo;s Wolves defense was more inline with what happened the first two series, they didn&rsquo;t make it to the conference finals on accident</p>

      <label for="l66jl2q" class="commentText"><p>True, and they did play incredibly well but we also are up 3-1 for a reason. We just weren’t able to exploit the weaknesses in the defense that we have been all series long in the minutes that Gafford leaves the floor. Lively is a big part of that, so it’s going to take another adjustment to figure out what small lineup (if any) works if he can’t go.</p>
