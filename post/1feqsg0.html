      <p>As a middle aged man it&rsquo;s interesting to me see the enduring cultural legacy of Michael Jordan. I will be driving by playgrounds or schools and see high school, middle school and even elementary school kids wearing the jersey and branded gear of a man whose career ended over twenty years ago. And whose best playing days were a nearly thirty years ago.</p>

<p>In contrast there was absolutely nothing like this when I was their age. I would not see other kids wearing Wilt Chamberlin jerseys or Oscar Robertson jerseys or Kareem Abdul-Jabaar jerseys.</p>

      <label for="lmp8ytq" class="commentText"><p>&ldquo;Jordan&rdquo; is a brand more than a player at this point. Both my kids are under 10, both play basketball competitively, and few of the kids on their teams even know Jordan as a player, even if many of them are wearing his shoes. Just one data point, but it&rsquo;s not all that different from when you were a kid, it&rsquo;s just that Jordan transcended from being an athlete to being a brand.</p>

You can wear a shoe without really knowing the athlete behind it but people aren’t buying jerseys in the same way they buy shoes from a brand. Jerseys <em>are</em> player specific.</p>

      <label for="lmpk2iu" class="commentText"><p>This is why lebron will never be unanimously considered the goat. Jordan has become almost mythical. It’s probably partially because of Nike and partially because he was dominant near the beginning of the modern NBA and he has been the golden standard ever since. Also partially because he led one of the most impressive runs in sports</p>

      <label for="lmqh787" class="commentText"><p>I think Nike tried to make him the next Jordan. He was wearing a signature shoe in his first NBA game, but Nike never committed to lebron like they did jordan. They started using the jumpman logo instead of the Nike logo starting with the Jordan 3s and they never stopped using the Nike logo with lebron.</p>

<p>And then he didn’t win a championship until he left Cleveland to go to a team that would give him help… and even though Jordan had help too it looks better because the help came to him. Jordan was better set up for success and he had a more successful career, but I’m taking prime lebron over prime Jordan 1 on 1</p>

      <label for="lmqaqi6" class="commentText"><p>From Chicago and as much as I loved Mike, I took him for granted when he returned after the first retirement. I guess I&rsquo;m middle-aged too and came of age when he truly took flight. When he retired, I wrote an essay that my school put in the lobby, I submitted a picture that was on the wall at Michael Jordan Steakhouse (not an artist but just a kid that loved Mike). By the time he returned, I was still a Bulls fan but started becoming a SHAQ and Reebok fan. I was aware of Mike&rsquo;s greatness and collected a LOT of his memorabilia as a kid. I wore an olive green suit to my 8th grade graduation because of Mike.</p>

<p>Michael and David Falk made his brand. When the Jordan 7 came out he didn&rsquo;t even have Nike Air branding/logo on the shoe. I&rsquo;m just going to mention some of the the campaigns and the sponsorships that I remember he had during the first Three-Peat. This is all happening before we even had internet, social media didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p>-NIKE
-Gatorade
-McDonald&rsquo;s (McJordan Special)
-Wheaties (I ate Wheaties because of Mike)
-Chevy (Blazer) They shot a commercial around my elementary school, he wasn&rsquo;t there.
-Upper Deck
-Illinois Lottery (local endorsement, but I had this cool flip book that showed the process of him dunking)
-Ball Park Franks
-Rayovac Batteries
-Appeared in Michael Jackson&rsquo;s video for Jam (world premiered on a Sunday night after whatever came on after the Simpson&rsquo;s)</p>

<p>When he retired, there was the video game Michael Jordan &lsquo;Chaos in the Windy City&rsquo; exclusive to Super Nintendo. I had that game and Shaq-Fu on Sega Genesis (It came with a CD). I don&rsquo;t even have to mention Space Jam being released in the season when he came back and eventually went 72-10.</p>

<p>In high school I worked at Foot Locker when Brand Jordan was launched. I remember in our store having Michael Jordan Cologne, Hanes Michael Jordan Collection, Oakley Sunglasses, and all of the Brand Jordan gear that was released during that time. The main difference was that while we had Jordan&rsquo;s, we had Air Pippen II, and Rodman&rsquo;s Converse. I&rsquo;m only mentioning the Bulls because they were so dominant and popular that multiple players on the team had signature shoes.</p>

<p>I could go on and on about how he transcends everything. There&rsquo;s a reason why Kobe wore 24 and eventually wore Nike, there&rsquo;s a reason why LeBron chose to wear 23, wear Nike, and do Space Jam 2. Mike left footprints, created the blueprint, inspired so many to fly. I&rsquo;ll never forget that my first college roommate was in the United States from Hong Kong to learn English. He barely knew English, but when I told him I was from Chicago, he said &lsquo;Michael Jordan&rsquo;. From 2 different worlds but Mike brought us together.</p>

<p>I love seeing Carlos Alcaraz wear all the Jordan stuff because someone put him on game, but also I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if people like Juan Carlos Ferrero grew up knowing about him and shared the legend of him. Seeing Roger Federer mention Mike as one of his heroes just shows how influential he was as an athlete, and how he transcends sports.</p>

They even had that cartoon called Pro Stars that had Mike, Wayne Gretzky, and Bo Jackson. The reason we didn&rsquo;t see the Kareem, Dr. J., even Magic and Bird much was because of the timing. Mike arrived at the right time, and had the marketability that took over Gen X, Millenials as we were using VHS and going online.</p>

Basketball shoes weren’t a big part of sneaker culture before Jordan made them so. Shoes didn’t sell out like they do now before Jordan. I remember mfs getting murdered for 12s growing up and it was crazy. Space Jam is still beloved today. It was something that can’t be recreated.</p>

<p>This was due to space jam as we used to have space jam trading cards and you could win a tape of the movie if you collect all of them. I used to watch that shit everyday with a plate of fries.</p>

<p>So if I, a brown child that has no concept of basketball, America, professional sports and what not, knew about Jordan? That tells you what you need to know. I just knew he was someone special.</p>

      <label for="lmq598z" class="commentText"><p>I think we&rsquo;re starting to see a little of that with Kobe. No where near the same as the Jordan brand, but similar in that the brand mythology has a draw to young people that never actually saw him play at his peak, if at all. I was at DSG over the weekend checking out shoes and it was wild how many young kids were so eager to get a pair of the Kobes that just dropped.</p>

      <label for="lmrmw51" class="commentText"><p>This brings up another thing: that this generation has only seen the good highlights of Jordan and they’re comparing them to 40-year old Lebron’s worst moments.</p>

<p>When they think of him, they think of the shot over the Jazz, the layup where he switches hands, the dunks. When they think of Lebron, they remember the good and the bad.</p>
