      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dfxb82/did_the_philadelphia_76ers_hand_boston_the/"><p>Did the Philadelphia 76ers hand Boston the championship?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>After seeing Joel Embiids comments the other day I couldn’t help but think it was actually the sixers that handed Celtics the championship</p>

<p>In 2007 a young Al Horford was drafted by the Atlanta Hawks, he would then leave to go to Boston for 3 seasons. The sixers acquired Al Horford in free agency and then decided to trade him to the Oklahoma City Thunder who would then go on to trade him back to the Celtics.</p>

<p>In 2009 they drafted Jrue Holiday who later on was a big part in helping two of their conference rivals winning championships while they failed to get out of the first/second round.</p>

<p>In 2015 the Philadelphia 76ers used their 3rd overall pick to draft Jahlil Okafor while the New York Knicks used their 4th overall pick to draft Kristaps Porzingus who would later on join the Celtics and be a huge part in their historic season.</p>

<p>In 2016 the Philadelphia 76ers used their 1st overall pick on Benjamin Simmons, while the Boston Celtics would use their 3rd overall pick to draft Jaylen Brown who some would argue has been their best player in this soon to be championship run.</p>

<p>In 2017 the Philadelphia 76ers would use their second straight 1st overall pick to draft Markelle Fultz while the Boston Celtics would use their 3rd overall pick to draft Jayson Tatum who is currently a top player in the league and does everything he needs to do in order for his team to win.</p>

<p>With that being said, through bad trades and horrible drafting, it begs the question did the sixers hand the Celtics the championship?</p>

<p>You could also argue the whole reason the Bucks traded for Dame was because the Heat beat them in 5 in the first round last year as the 8th seed.  It also probably was what got Budenholzer fired, leading to their current coaching instability.</p>

<p>His left is actually a lot better and his handle has vastly improved. The knock on him was he couldn’t shoot out of college, and now he’s the best shooter on our team. Dude relentlessly improves year after year.</p>

Celtics liked Tatum so much more than Fultz that they traded the #1 pick in a draft with a &ldquo;consensus&rdquo; #1.

<p>He had a shit work ethic in high school, had a shit work ethic in college, I don’t know why it came as a surprise that as soon as he got that max he started to have a shit work ethic in the NBA.</p>

<p>Also, I get that Fultz was seemingly oozing with talent but even in 2017 I couldn’t see why we had our point guard of the future who needed the ball in his hands to be effective and our solution was to draft another ball dominant guard instead of a wing player who by most people’s accounts was just as talented to round out the team.</p>

      <label for="l8mehk4" class="commentText"><p>I followed the Huskies pre-Fultz. They were terrible but their games were available on my college’s free Tv service. Marquese Chriss, Dejonte Murray, Matisse Thybulle. They just needed a “star” to maximize all their role players and then Fultz committed. (Murray and Chriss were both drafted so they never player with Markelle) Once he was committed I immediately followed him on his socials. Dude seemed to have grown up around dirt bikes and quads. He plays his freshman year, declares for the draft, and then in between declaring and working out for teams every picture or reference to dirt bikes, ATVs, motorcycles, whatever was erased from his socials. Just completely wiped that part of his internet presence away. Then he has a terrible couple of work outs for the Lakers, Celtics and Sixers. When the Sixers chose to trust the game tape over the workouts, they got burned.</p>

<p>I’m more curious as to how if/how he passed any sort of physical. He looked OK in the summer league but he only played in 3 games - 2 of which were in Vegas. He clearly looked like not only a different player but just deflated/defeated. I don’t know for sure what happened but soemthing definitely did.</p>

      <label for="l8mag4c" class="commentText"><p>Okafor was a non-shooting big who came into the league at exactly the wrong time and who couldn&rsquo;t productively be on the court at the same time as Embiid (and the Sixers still had Nerlens Noel also). It was easy to predict his stint in Philly would go badly.</p>

<p>Philly hoarding bigs while not getting Porzingis isn&rsquo;t <em>quite</em> as bad as the Wolves hoarding PGs while not getting Curry, but it&rsquo;s closer than you think.</p>

<p>The sixers acquired Al Horford in free agency</p>

<p>Still one of the dumbest signings I can recall.</p>

<p>Shit, people talk about Portland&rsquo;s 2016 offseason as legendarily bad, but in hindsight that offseason from Philly was up there.  Maxed Tobias, let Jimmy walk, gave Ben Simmons a max extension, and signed Horford who was a terrible fit next to Embiid.  What a disaster.</p>

It kinda seemed like they signed Horford just so that the Celtics couldn&rsquo;t. Can&rsquo;t blame Al for taking the bag, but he was never going to be a good fit in that lineup.</p>

      <label for="l8mgzl7" class="commentText"><p>Horford/Embiid might&rsquo;ve worked with a normal guard, but with Simmons in the mix it was doomed from the start. We wasted so much time and assets hoping that Simmons would change or get better and he just never did.</p>

<p>The team that lost to the Raptors also was hamstrung by Simmons, but more-so in the sense that Brett Brown and Simmons felt he should be the primary ball handler when it really should&rsquo;ve been Jimmy (as he proved time and time again after he left). The story goes that Brett went to Jimmy during the series and tried to make the change but Jimmy basically said it was too late to totally change what they were doing.</p>

<p>The Sixers really have just made the wrong decision time and time and time again over the last 10 years with the sole exceptions of Embiid and Maxey.</p>

Jrue Holiday being on the celtics instead of say the clippers had zero impact on Bucks season. Whether the Celtics or Mavs win why should the Bucks care. There season was always ending the same way. Next year is next year and maybe that will change but Jrue being on the celtics did not come back to bite them yet.</p>

      <label for="l8mdu90" class="commentText"><p>I disagree. Bucks fans love Jrue. I think there are a lot of Bucks fans that get annoyed at the rest of the NBA media and fans for saying we made a mistake by trading him. Jrue was a huge reason we won in 21 - that’s undeniable and will never be forgotten. But his playoff performances following that were quite bad when we needed him to step up as the 2nd option. Getting Dame for Jrue was an upgrade that anyone would’ve taken for their team - there were just other circumstances this year surrounding the Bucks that lead to their poor performance. Jrue being traded from the Blazers to the Celtics was a huge opportunity for him. The Celtics were an already established contender, and Jrue could flourish in a role where he didn’t have to be the 2nd option. So him playing well in his role is no surprise to Bucks fans, but some are obviously annoyed when it gets pushed back on the Bucks org that they “made a mistake.” The comparing of non-similar scenarios for Jrue’s current success is what people don’t like.</p>

<p>Not only does it affect the seeding in your conference, if you face them in the playoffs then it could end yojr season.</p>

<p>So to say that &ldquo;milwaukee shouldnt care because they didnt face us&rdquo; is pretty fucking terrible reasoning.</p>

When these trades happen there is an agreement on who is going to be taken. The Celtics wouldn’t have made the trade if the Sixers wanted Tatum. Lol. They would have just drafted Tatum at 1. The lakers could have drafted Tatum.</p>

<p>And what they handed them a championship seven years later after the Celtics kept choking. Rofl.</p>

      <label for="l8mdx15" class="commentText"><p>Missed a detail: The 76ers traded the Celtics to move up for the number 1 pick to grab Fultz and let the Celtics take Tatum (who we were always taking). This trade also helped us get Derrick white a few years later.</p>

<p>The C&rsquo;s won the No. 1 pick in the draft lottery but traded it to the Philadelphia 76ers for the No. 3 pick and a future first-rounder that became No. 14 in 2019 (Romeo Langford).</p>

<p>Langford was part of the compensation package dealt to San Antonio in the Derrick White trade.</p>

<p>“ On February 10, 2022, Langford was traded, alongside Josh Richardson, to the San Antonio Spurs in exchange for Derrick White.”</p>

      <label for="l8mhp83" class="commentText"><p>They traded Offense for Defense when Jrue was the only Competent perimeter defender. That’s why I said they got greedy the only player they “upgraded” with was Lillard and that wasn’t much of a trade off. Beasley was a shell of himself and the other players that were supposed to step up didn’t.  So there wasn’t much change from last year with the same results. And yes I know they were doing well under the previous coach but where they ended up was the same 🤷🏾‍♂️.</p>
