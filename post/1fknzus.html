      <p>I wish they would at least alternate each year, or god forbid ESPN could have longer halftime segments where they discuss the game.</p>

<p>But Amazon and NBC coming in, and TNT basically out, I‚Äôm wondering if the Finals coverage could improve or change networks. If not now, in the future.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any links to relevant articles about this stuff? Or know the latest news from a podcast?</p>

<p>Other than pregame lineups what&rsquo;s the issue with Finals coverage? I feel like a bunch of people simultaneously complain when the broadcast booth says anything while also complaining when they say nothing because the break is all commercials.</p>

Imagine you go to see snoop or ice cube, but then what? Dre&rsquo;s here too? EM?! LL COOL J? Miss HILL? Is that K Dot&rsquo;s entrance music?! and then to close out the show they all leave and Macklemore does maybe 4 or 7 songs.</p>

<p>Other than the hypothetical bizarro world where TNT leases out the Inside crew for the Finals, that&rsquo;s the natural end point of their season.</p>

This is what I&rsquo;m talking about, you guys like Inside because they&rsquo;re funny so you&rsquo;ll look past stuff you&rsquo;d hate elsewhere. TNT focuses on the gambling just as much as any other major sport is starting to focus on it.</p>

<p>And I don&rsquo;t see what ESPN talking about the Lakers throughout the week on talk shows has to do with Finals coverage specifically. This is solely talking about them during the Finals.</p>

      <label for="lnxrxnh" class="commentText"><p>First, the analyst situation sucks. Burke isn&rsquo;t good enough to carry a broadcast on her own. Especially one of magnitude. The analyst chair(s) have been a revolving door. It was time for JVG and Jackson to go (Jackson for sure, he was awful in the Heat Nuggets Finals) but in classic ESPN fashion, they didn&rsquo;t have a clear plan for next up.</p>

<p>Second, Breen has lost a step. Dude was GUSHING over the Knicks when they were in the process of being shown the door by Indy. Pay the team off and spin in forward. Breen just stayed slobbing on the Knicks.</p>

<p>Third, support coverage is worst in the business. NBAtv does a better job than ESPN&rsquo;s studio programming. Malika is bland, Richard Jefferson treats it like a happy hour, Perkins is all over the place with takes that are so absurd one wonders if he even watches the league. Woj is gone now but even then had no place for a definite role when his wheelhouse is front office/transactions; not analysis. Bob Meyers is still too close to the Warriors and also not suited for game analysis, he&rsquo;s a front office guy. Not to mention how pre game and halftime are literally just commercials/sponsored elements with like 30 seconds of &ldquo;analysis&rdquo; or actual human entertainment sprinkled in. There is no added value, in fact, it takes away from the experience. Doesn&rsquo;t build up the game or inform the audience as to what has occurred. Also, they don&rsquo;t do a wrap show because it usually just throws to Human Thumb Van Pelt.</p>

<p>Competition forces innovation. ESPN has no one forcing them to change/get better. The product has just continued to decline.</p>

<p>It was a major disappointment to see that the Finals wasn&rsquo;t rotated. Would love to see what another network, especially NBC that does so well with SNF, could do with them.</p>

<p><strong>Who will televise the Finals in the new deal?</strong></p>

<p>ABC will continue to be the home of the NBA Finals, as it has been since 2003.</p>

<p><strong>What about the rest of the playoffs?</strong></p>

<p>Under the new deal, ABC will have a conference final in &ldquo;10 of 11&rdquo; seasons that the deal runs &ndash; it&rsquo;s currently unclear what year &ndash; and NBC and Amazon will each get a conference final in six of the 11 years, meaning in one season each will have a conference final, and ABC won&rsquo;t have one.</p>

<p>Across the first two rounds of the playoffs, Disney will get 18 games a year, while NBCUniversal will air 28 across NBC and Peacock and Amazon will stream one-third of all games across them &ndash; with the league&rsquo;s release calling those totals &ldquo;approximate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This shit is so obnoxious.  Basically you have to subscribe to all of Disney, Prime, and Peacock in addition to a full cable/YTTV type service to watch the NBA playoffs.</p>

<p>Peacock and Prime are a different topic, but as far as I know Thursday Night Football games on Prime air free on Twitch (which I&rsquo;d assume will carry to NBA).</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d need Disney+/ESPN+ for anything they choose to stream there.  You can bet they will soon enough if not right away.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d need Peacock for those games.</p>

<p>And you&rsquo;d need Amazon Prime for those games.  They&rsquo;re not paying for an NBA package just to give it away.  The TNF/Twitch thing won&rsquo;t last forever - seems they&rsquo;re just doing more of a promo with the one game as they realize it&rsquo;s not a Prime seller by itself.</p>
