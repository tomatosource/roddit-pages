      <label for="l7g5a2g" class="commentText"><p>I think for all nba third team there should be a different threshold for games played. Zach Lowe talked about it on his podcast but just allowing more flexibility for games played on those 5 spots if someone who played 60 games had an incredible season instead of putting someone who had a good season but hit the threshold, especially because All-NBA is linked to the super max. I think it’s fair. (Zach Lowe talked more in-depth on his podcast if you wanted to see what he suggested I’m just summarizing what I remember.</p>

Then maybe guys would stop sitting out one or two playoff games due to small injuries. I say this because so many players seem to get little nicks and bumps after playing so many regular season games. Let’s get them playing more in the playoffs.</p>

<p>whatever the case, players bodies&rsquo; will get ample amounts of rest and therefore significantly reduce fatigue injuries. who knows we might&rsquo;ve experienced full on prime D Rose with a league like this.</p>

<p>65 games makes no sense arbitrarily, as 66 games would be 80%, 65 is only 79%. Make it a number based off of a real round percentage of games and not just arbitrarily chosen</p>

Missing 17 games (played 65), means they missed 20.7% of the season. The NBA is basically saying, if you miss at least 20% of the season, you can&rsquo;t qualify for EOS awards.</p>

      <label for="l7fs7d4" class="commentText"><p>I know it goes against popular opinion here but I don’t love it. If voters are trusted to vote, they should be able to vote with context and take too much missed time into account. When contract incentives are tied to awards and you have players playing through injury to meet an arbitrary games quota, I don’t think that’s an ideal solution.  It did its job this year but might not always.</p>

<p>I hate the load management garbage as much as anyone, but if the difference between an award going to player X or Y comes down to player X missing one additional game compared to player Y and being auto-disqualified, then…idk. There are going to be weird situations down the road even if it hasn’t happened yet.</p>

      <label for="l7ftcjk" class="commentText"><p>It definitely had its pros and cons. On one hand, we got the stars playing in more games than they have in a while, which is always a win. On the other, you had guys who were near the games played threshold who clearly weren&rsquo;t 100% when they came back, which isn&rsquo;t exactly great for a number of reasons (greater risk of re-injury, them outright just not being as good, etc.).</p>

<p>All in all, I think it was a good change. However, I do think they need to make a few more tweaks to make it as good of a rule as it could be.</p>

<p>My take on modern medical staffs is that they&rsquo;re generally a lot more cautious than they used to be, meaning such a thing as the above should be pretty rare nowadays.  Or am I wrong in that..?</p>

      <label for="l7fthhs" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t know how many players were actually motivated by it, as much as teams adjusting policy in line with the league&rsquo;s quasi-scientific report that load managing didn&rsquo;t actually prevent injury.</p>

<p>As a Clippers fan, they were very clear about &ldquo;taking the regular season more seriously&rdquo;, and I don&rsquo;t think that had to do with the 65-game rule. However, I think some teams should absolutely rest older players with injury history on one night of back to backs, particularly if its against an easier opponent. I would rather be a little disappointed to not see Kawhi play a mid-February game against the Spurs than see him play 30-minutes at a hugely reduced ability for two playoff games.</p>

<p>I would imagine the league would rather have a healthy lineup of stars in the playoffs, too, so rather than change awards criteria, they should shorten the season. Since they won&rsquo;t do that, they should at least eliminate all travel back-to-backs, and stop gaslighting their audience into believing load management is a player decision.</p>

People already took into account games played for awards.  the NBA just did it so they can say they did something when somebody complains about scheduled rest.  basically all it will do is convince guys like Haliburton this year to play through injuries  when they should probably rest which doesn&rsquo;t seem like the smartest thing </p>

      <label for="l7fz5yt" class="commentText"><p>Hmmm I think games played should be a factor, just not sold on the arbitrary nature of a strict number as the rule.</p>

<p>Consider the hypothetical where a player plays the first 64 games averaging 35/10/5 and the team is say 59-5 and have easily secured top seed.  Then gets a contact injury putting him out for the remainder of regular season. I still think that even factoring in games played you can make probably an extremely good argument that player is the MVP.</p>

<p>Likewise, factoring in games played without the strict rule I think you can still easily discard a 30/10/6 player in top seed who played 66 games through load management in favour of a 32/8/8 on a 2nd seed 1 game behind who played 80 games…even though the first will have cleared the 65 games threshold.</p>

      <label for="l7g4hid" class="commentText"><p>not much of a fan, people seem to think it worked but we had an atypically healthy year for star players (meaning major injuries). We can compare games played from this year to last but for example lebron, KD, AD all played more games this year but it was because they didn&rsquo;t suffer a major injury. The clippers guys did seem to be pushed to play more but we can argue if that was even a good thing considering how it may have impacted kawhi. I think it&rsquo;ll take a few years to get a clearer picture of if it&rsquo;s actually making players play more because there&rsquo;s just not enough data rn</p>

<p>The award stuff is silly because voters already considered games played in a more nuanced way than a hard cut-off. Hali clearly came back early to meet the requirement which was a combination of the games played rule and contracts tied to all NBA appearances so blame can go either way.</p>

I’d rather see haliburton focus on being as healthy as possible for the stretch run and playoffs then limp around for 21 minutes a game in random regular season games, which is what ended up happening. The NBA is effectively punishing players who don’t want to play through injury which is a terrible incentive system</p>
