      <p>It seems players in the NBA in 2023-24 regular season hit 76.3% of their first attempts, 81.0% of their second attempts and 87.6% of their third attempts. The last one makes sense for the type of player who would likely get fouled while shooting a 3 pointer. The thing that intrigues me the most is that while 75.7% of 3PT plays (2PT + And-1) are completed, just 72.5% of 4PT plays are completed. This is based on my own program and I expect it to be about 99.9% accurate to the attempts and makes, but that last figure is a bit baffling. Other figures: 78.1% of free throws for 2PT shooting fouls, 85.8% for 3PT shooting fouls, and 80.6% for fouls from team penalty situations (personal fouls that generate free throws).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m assuming the jump in efficiency from first to second attempt is mainly due to the player getting into a rhythm, being able to adjust if he misses the first one, and their cardio/heart rate going down for the second one.</p>

<p>As for why 4 pts play have the lowest completion rate of all of them, my theory is that since 4 pts play are so rare, the player gets hyped up and kinda loses focus, or nerves come into play like they&rsquo;re thinking &ldquo;ok i&rsquo;ve done the hard part now dont fuck up the easy part&rdquo; and CLANK!</p>

<p>Is there any way you could separate the second attempts into 2 categories depending on if they make the first one or not? I would guess a make first would lead to a ~84% second attempt, while a miss would lead to a ~78% second attempt, because obviously someone making the first would be a better free throw shooter on average, but still missing the first one gives you a chance to adjust.</p>
