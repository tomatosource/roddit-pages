      <label for="lsxl9ca" class="commentText"><p>Well, I mean, far be it for me to argue with these two dudes, but it&rsquo;s not a 3 on 3 game. You rotate somebody else down from the wing/top to at least contest Klay in that weak side corner. Then somebody else rotates to that guy&rsquo;s guy, and so on. Of course, if the Mavs execute perfectly, they will eventually end up with a good shot, but a disciplined defense can at least make it something like a semi-contested Quentin Grimes 3 from above the break rather than a wide open Klay from the corner.</p>

      <label for="lsxo5cv" class="commentText"><p>I think people are missing what his actual impact is which is him actually moving off ball and making our offensive sets less stagnant. He and Kyrie are able to draw 2 off screens and can create easy looks for the bigs in a different way. In periods without Luka last year, there was way too much on Kyrie&rsquo;s plate as a small guard. In most matchups (especially regular season) he was able to dominate, but in the playoffs it gets harder. Having Klay will help that a lot.</p>

<p>Also beyond Klay, Quentin Grimes is going to make a massive impact. Their chemistry has looked great together and having another guy who can actually dribble and pass in transition is going to help tremendously. Last season a big aspect of our improvement was transition play. It can be even better with Klay this year.</p>

<p>And even that point about a semi-contested Quentin Grimes 3. Before it would be a Josh Green 3 or DJJ - two guys you feel uneasy dribbling and with DJJ cant make good passes. Grimes can take that pass and drive to the hoop and then maybe get it back to Klay/others. There is way more potential for ball movement because these are 3 and D guys that know how to dribble and pass now. I thought Klay made some really nice passes in the preseason game against you guys as well. That&rsquo;s the difference Klay and the new team will make.</p>

      <label for="lsyfcw0" class="commentText"><p>You do realize Klay’s movement off ball was part of the Warriors scheme and if you want Klay moving off ball, Dallas would need to implement sets with those actions. Dallas runs a 4 out high pnr scheme and guys can’t just be cutting through the roll man’s space. He’ll have some effect with being a vet and knowing how to space without the ball but unless they’re switching their offense they’re still going to be trying to collapse the defense, draw help and spray to shooters.</p>

      <label for="lszr0hm" class="commentText"><p>Dallas has already implemented sets with those actions. I am a Mavs fan I watch their preseason games. Not all off ball movement is cutting through the paint. As I described, screens up to the 3, Uphill DHOs, are actions that free space into the paint.</p>

<p>Something I’ve noticed in preseason now is that almost every players is getting involved in actions with the big now that we have more potent shooters/passers with Grimes, Klay, Marshall. We’re not going to become the Warriors but it’s crazy to think he can only benefit a motion offense with movement.</p>

<p>I mean the guy he’s replacing in DJJ got most of his points off cuts to the hoop.</p>

      <label for="lsyj7zj" class="commentText"><p>I mean, I do realize they have a brain and that’s my point. Are you new to basketball? They might run a set here or there for Klay but they’re not going to be changing their scheme for a mid 30s rotation player when they currently have one of the best offenses in the league. Plus he’s elite at what they want from a wing. They’re going to park his ass in the corner and have him space/play pop a shot. They’re not going to be running a motion offense all of a sudden because they got a guy that knows the system. Teams don’t bend to guys like Klay (who he is at this point), he bends to them-and it’s going to be better for both. Jesus</p>

      <label for="lszqmvb" class="commentText"><p>But the fact you think those sets here and there do nothing or that people are completely parked in the corner is the issue. You think only the warriors offense has off ball movement? These are things important to ANY offense not just motion offenses.</p>

<p>The Mavericks offense also is not just a PnR offense it has a high volume of Dribble Hand offs and guys coming off screens into the ball. It’s not going to work exactly like the Warriors, and Klays movement be as featured heavily because as you said he’s a mid 30s role player.</p>

<p>But we don’t need him to try having all star Klay impact anymore. We need him to maximize and diversify our offensive abilities which he absolutely can do and nothing you said points otherwise.</p>

      <label for="lsykeby" class="commentText"><p>This is absolutely correct but the problem is of all the playoff teams, the Mavs might have the lowest volume of off-screen actions. Kidd just doesn’t use them much. If Klay is being used as a spacer like DJJ was then he’ll do a better job of that, sure, but he’s not pressuring the defense nearly as much as when he’s flying around screen. And considering spacing is basically the only thing he’s good for these days, not milking the most out of him there means it’s hard to see him being all that impactful overall.</p>

      <label for="lszq0mv" class="commentText"><p>Well yes because we literally did not have the personnel to do so. If you watched any of our preseason games, you would see that it is something that has been incorporated into our offense. This was my entire point… it was something we didn’t have and now it’s something we do have. Another reason why I brought up transition play to because he has a similar effect there.</p>

      <label for="lsxsoep" class="commentText"><p>They will very likely be the team that gives the opposing coaches the most headache trying to defend them. The Mavs typically generate the most open corner 3s in the league. The issue with what you are saying is the defense has to react to what they expect the play to develop. Luka does a great job manipulating the defense with his eyes and hitting the open man. Even if the player guarding Klay has to stay a step closer to him than he did guarding someone like DJJ, that makes a big difference in terms of spacing. The issue last season was they were one of the worst in terms of accuracy on corner 3s despite how much of them were wide open.</p>

As the season went on he adjusted his game , let the shots come to him, and even did more facilitating (because even if he’s not shooting well, he’s still klay Thompson and demands a certain level of attention for the defense) and played pretty solid. If he can continue that and not play with a sense of entitlement I think he could be really effective. But we’ll see</p>

      <label for="lsxr8ba" class="commentText"><p>His legs aren&rsquo;t what they use to be.  That was the strength of his jumpshot, to get up quick and release.  He was also a solid two way player, but with him losing a step, his defense has suffered as well.  So people had a standard for what Klay played like, he hasn&rsquo;t played up to that standard, so they think he&rsquo;s washed due to that and age.</p>

<p>Kyrie came from a situation that arguably 50 times more toxic and dysfunctional and went to the Finals the first year we were able to make it about just basketball for him. Not saying it will be the same for Klay but if it is he could easily have a really solid year as a floor spacing role player.</p>

      <label for="lsyjk9o" class="commentText"><p>Totally reasonable. I would say people tend to have Klay below those other 2 (which isn’t a knock) is because they could shoot at an elite level in multiple ways where as Klay is more catch and fire/1 dribble and up. The others were more dynamic and still had the same skill Klay has</p>

      <label for="lsxy6gg" class="commentText"><p>Today I learned every year does not include 2020 when we ran the nuggets out of the building. Must suck to be at the end of your potential reign already. Wasted an all time talent in Jokic by only having 1 championship and never really competing in any other year.</p>
