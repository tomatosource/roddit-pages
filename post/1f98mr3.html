<p>Which makes sense, because the sort of body it takes to make it to the NBA without being exceptionally skilled at basketball is one that doesn&rsquo;t make it to the NFL. Won&rsquo;t see a 7 foot beanstalk running around the gridiron</p>

He played one year of basketball in college, red-shirted his rookie NFL season, then in his first real football season he broke the record for most receding yards by a tight end. If you go by Gil’s scenario, I feel like we can find a Jimmy Graham.</p>

<p>Interesting note, despite having more receiving yards than any previous tight end, Jimmy Graham did not have the most receiving yards for a tight end that season. Rob Grobkowski had his breakout season at the same time and beat out Jimmy Graham. The tight end record was broken twice in the same season lol</p>

      <label for="lljyhaw" class="commentText"><p>Ben Simmons career high is 42 points. I&rsquo;d be shocked if anyone in the NFL could step into the NBA and score 42 points. </p>

<p> Historically there have been a few NFL players that were decent college basketball players&ndash;namely Julius Peppers and Antonio Gates. I&rsquo;m not aware of any current NFL players that played college basketball.  </p>

<p> I think the best shot for a truly good NFL player would be a skill player that can play guard. NFL linemen just aren&rsquo;t tall enough to be bigmen in the NBA. For some reason, DeJuan Blair always stands out to me as an example of &ldquo;what if an NFL player played in the NBA.&rdquo; Dude had legit skills as a bigman, but he was 6&rsquo;7&rdquo; and 270 and wasn&rsquo;t quick enough to make up for his lack of height. </p>

<p>Also, lets face it, with the difference in money and health quality of life, if an NFL player could ball at an NBA level, they&rsquo;d never set foot on a football field again. </p>

<p>Drake London definitely would have played college basketball as a top 100 recruit if he only focused on it. Isaiah Mobley (Evan’s brother) who went to USC has said this on record since he practiced with him. </p>

<p>He’s probably the best NFL basketball player. Also had some sick dunks in high school (you can check out his dunk contest vs Jaime Jacquez in hs).</p>

<p>The best NBA player who played football is definitely Jalen Suggs and it isn’t close. Suggs actually probably could have been a safety in the NFL, which suits his play style. </p>

      <label for="llkaz9e" class="commentText"><p>No Suggs was better than LeBron at football. Suggs was the Minnesota Football Player of the Year, the state champion winning QB, and recruited by top D1 colleges for football while playing basketball.</p>

<p>LeBron was good but he wasn’t the best player in his state (might have been the best WR/TE though) and he didn’t win any state titles in football. He might have been better if he only focused on it and may transition better due to his athleticism but Suggs definitely had a more decorated football career. </p>

<p>Just because LeBron is way better at basketball doesn’t mean he was better at football. </p>

      <label for="llkbxv3" class="commentText"><p>Yea that’s kinda my point. So he wasn’t as good at football as Suggs. </p>

<p>I’m sure Tyreek Hill could have been the fastest person in the world too if he focused on it, but it doesn’t mean he was a better sprinter than Noah Lyles. I’m not using projections here. I’m using actual play. </p>

<p>Suggs didn’t even choose to play college football so I don’t even see what you mean. It’s not like he cared that much either or he would have not gone to Gonzaga. Suggs was a 5 star basketball recruit himself who was also destined for the NBA. He wasn’t as good as LeBron but he was NBA destined in high school too. Also there are plenty of lower ranked football recruits than Suggs literally in the NFL so I don’t see what you mean he would have stalled out at the college level. </p>

      <label for="llk3qe8" class="commentText"><p>Thanks for this additional information. I didn&rsquo;t know that about either Drake London or Jalen Suggs. Just curious, where are you seeing thay Suggs was a high level safety? All I&rsquo;m seeing is that he was a dual-threat quarterback. </p>

<p>Based purely on athletic profile, I think Zion is another player that&rsquo;s an interesting &ldquo;what if&rdquo; for football. He already is built like a D-End, and he could probably get even more tailor-made for football if he was able to go full bulk-out. Defensive line seems like one of the positions where freaky athleticism can go a long way. In reality though, Zions body would probably get completely broken by football. </p>

      <label for="llk9dxx" class="commentText"><p>Suggs played two ways in high school, both as a QB and DB. For his recruitment, he was listed as a dual threat QB, where he got some nice D1 offers from good schools. However, to actually make the NFL as a QB is quite hard, and I think his best pathway would have been his other position he played in high school. </p>

<p>He has the ball skills, size, and athleticism to play safety and even as a QB, he liked to run and take hits so he wasn’t afraid of contact. So I think DB, particularly safety, would have been a better pathway. He also has an advantage since he played QB before to be able to read plays. </p>

<p>There are several starting NFL safeties who played QB in high school, such as Kam Chancellor, who is someone I think Suggs could have played like. Chancellor was also listed as a QB recruit in high school before converting in college. </p>

<p>Agree with Zion, although injuries would have been the issue. I wonder if he ever played football growing up. Don’t know if he did but I assume he at least tried it. I know Charles Barkley tried it and quit after 1 day lol. </p>

      <label for="llmm3id" class="commentText"><p>Charlie ward was strictly a defender in the nba &amp; he was a great defender &amp; true pg in college. He averaged 10pts 5asts &amp; 3stls a game at fsu as a senior, that’s much better numbers that peppers or graham had in basketball. Hell he averaged almost as many rebounds as graham &amp; peppers as a 6’2 pg. &amp; he had the ball handling &amp; passing ability to play at the nba level unlike them</p>
