So while his home totals went way up in his DPOY season, his away totals also went way down. Not quite balancing out because his overall steals average did go up .3 and his blocks up .1 But nothing crazy either.</p>

      <label for="l9tyr7z" class="commentText"><p>From the article, it looks like Tom and his friend watched the tapes independently and then compared their notes, and they found what seem to be dead-ball turnovers (i.e. passes out of bounds, travels, etc.) get added to Jordans steals numbers</p>

<p><a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/a-closer-look-at-michael-jordans-1988-dpoy-award-raises-questions-about-its-validity-has-lebron-james-been-chasing-a-ghost-140452567.html" target="_blank">https://sports.yahoo.com/a-closer-look-at-michael-jordans-1988-dpoy-award-raises-questions-about-its-validity-has-lebron-james-been-chasing-a-ghost-140452567.html</a></p>

<p>All in all, by our count, the box score showed 59 steals on 41 live-ball turnovers, resulting in a whopping 18 excess steals.</p>

<p>Who benefited from all those extra steals? We brought our attention to Jordan’s accounting. In the six games, the box scores indicated that Jordan’s total steal count was 28. After comparing our notes from the film study, we each counted 12 steals. An astounding difference of 16 excess steals. Almost every excess steal was being allocated to Jordan.</p>

<p>A pattern emerged as the games began to pile up in our film review. It appeared that Jordan benefited from deflections being erroneously recorded as steals. In games where there was a surplus of Jordan steals, we noticed that the turnover/steal counts would closer align after we counted the defensive plays that Jordan poked the ball out of bounds or back into the hands of the opposing team — even if there was no change of possession.</p>

<p>Steals should not be awarded in these instances, but Jordan seemed to benefit from the apparent generosity. And here’s the thing: when other players made the same deflections on both teams, their steal counts tended to be scored by the book — that is, correctly. Twelve steals in six games for Jordan (two steals per game) would be much more in line with his road average that season (2.3) rather than his official home average of four steals.</p>

<p>We already know that stat keepers are still fudging assists all the way through the current year, so is this a problem that has existed off and on? Always? Is there anything besides points that we can absolutely say hasn&rsquo;t been negatively impacted by poor scorekeeping?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jordan might be the most petty athlete to walk the face of the earth</strong>, and it might’ve been a contributing factor to why he achieved so much in a time where all of our eyes were fixated on him. Even with all the public knows about him, the bits and pieces that have been doled out through the years or revealed in some way, it craves more because Jordan gave out only crumbs.</p>

<p><strong>Even his flaws have somehow turned into badges of honor through the years, his beefs and feuds causing many of his fanboys to take up his own grievances as their own.</strong></p>

<p>It goes back to a monoculture that cannot be reclaimed, a time where perhaps sports emotions felt more pure and raw rather than filtered and cultivated by PR teams and well-timed social-media blasts.</p>

<p>So because <strong>Jordan was petty and held beefs, his followers had no problem doing the same.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>CLEARLY the words of a man who &ldquo;glazes&rdquo; Jordan🙄</p>

      <label for="l9ssqwo" class="commentText"><p>The NBA has come a long way since. No way someone gets a steal on a dead ball turnover and it doesn’t get caught.</p>

<p>There’s always going to be some degree of a judgement call on edge case assists, or whether an edge case tip (rebound) or deflection (steal) was controlled just enough or not quite. But those are tiny compared to giving a steal on a travel or a block on a foul.</p>

But the more recent easy access to full game tape as well as video clips linked to the play-by-play we have now makes it much more difficult still for anything untoward to happen — that goes hand in hand with routine review of games and box score adjustments that the league now does.</p>

      <label for="l9uku9q" class="commentText"><p>Then can he go through and check the home stats for a bunch of other stars from that era and find those discrepancies?  So he can find a way to normalize the stats for everyone and then take another look at Jordan&rsquo;s stats considering that?  Go watch five games of Mark Eaton film to make sure all his blocks were legit (article points out his home/road splits were just as egregious as Jordan&rsquo;s).  Make sure all of Hakeem&rsquo;s steals were legit.</p>

<p>All the games he looked at were at Chicago.  Can he prove that the scorekeepers in visiting arenas didn&rsquo;t do the opposite and artificially deflate Jordan&rsquo;s stats?  You don&rsquo;t think some scorekeeper in the Boston Garden at that time didn&rsquo;t knock a steal or assist or two off Jordan from time to time?</p>

<p>Every star had home cookin in terms of stats in that era.  A tiny percentage of regular season games were on national TV.  No one outside the local markets were watching these random games.  That&rsquo;s acknowledged in the article talking about guys from the 1960s.</p>

<p>This whole thing just seems like he had a conclusion (stats were cooked) and worked backwards from it and found a way to work in Jordan because he knew that would get headlines.  That DPOY &ldquo;may be the most consequential Defensive Player of the Year award in NBA history&rdquo;?  Give me a break.</p>

      <label for="l9unct2" class="commentText"><p>Jordan was THE guy the NBA marketed and made the NBA huge at that time. Finding out his stats were falsely inflated is a lot more significant than finding out Mark Eaton or some other random players stars were inflated. We still compare Jordan to players today he is considered universally to be the GOAT NBA player. If his stats are inflated it means a lot more to general NBA discourse as his stats and accomplishments are still brought up to this day to compare to modern players (LeBron). If other player stats were inflated from that time period it honestly just looks worse for Jordan when comparing him to modern players. Michael Jordan has been the global face of the NBA for decades, it is meaningful.</p>

I mostly followed as a kid thru the New York Times, some of the box scores came a day later (drove my dad nuts I used our NYT sub for sports box scores).</p>

<p>My vision of MJ’s greatness was thru 5 regular season games on NBC, the box scores, game recaps (on NYT), and televised playoff games.</p>

<p>If you tell me some of his recorded stats are questionable, ok.  But if we go back further I’m sure it gets worse.</p>

Tom&rsquo;s article has a section where he talks with Bob Ryan about things, and Bill Russell and Wilt&rsquo;s rebounds come up:</p>

<p><a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/a-closer-look-at-michael-jordans-1988-dpoy-award-raises-questions-about-its-validity-has-lebron-james-been-chasing-a-ghost-140452567.html" target="_blank">https://sports.yahoo.com/a-closer-look-at-michael-jordans-1988-dpoy-award-raises-questions-about-its-validity-has-lebron-james-been-chasing-a-ghost-140452567.html</a></p>

<p>He remembers similar controversies surrounding Wilt Chamberlain’s and Bill Russell’s rebounding numbers in the 1960s. Their respective teams traded accusations that the opposing scorekeeper padded the stats to help their giant. Looking back, the numbers are indeed startling. Between them, Russell and Chamberlain registered 26 games with 40-plus rebounds. None of the 26 games were tabulated on the road, per Stathead.com tracking.</p>

<p>By 1995-96 for the second 3-peat the Bulls were on WGN which was available via your cable package. I was much older and very into basketball, and on  my school team.</p>

<p>Jordan was good, but he wasn&rsquo;t other worldly. I think if people watch that second 3-peat you will not be impressed. I will argue that 1993 season it felt every Bulls game I saw Jordan was unstoppable.</p>

<p>Yes, if 6-0 doesn&rsquo;t happen, we think of him differently. But it did happen, and he&rsquo;s the GOAT</p>

No one was surprised that Warriors won 2 championships with KD but also no one really cares because they were obviously so much better. The Knicks were the biggest rival to the Bulls in the East during that era and their second best player was Jon Starks LOL compared to the Bulls having Pippen it’s no competition.</p>

Nephews want to talk about “witnessing”, you actually were when it came to Jordan, not this self proclaimed nonsense. Dig up all the tapes and recount all the steals, boards, assists, turnovers you want. Hell, take back the DPOY if you want. What’s that gonna do? Nothing, Jordan will remain unsurpassed for yet another generation. End of story.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s not like this will be the catalyst for any change because the NBA has already taken huge strides in accurately collecting data</p>

<p>How do we not know that the NBA themselves already knew of this stuff and that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;ve pushed for changes when it comes to collecting data?</p>

      <label for="l9t6hnv" class="commentText"><p>Tired of this narrative. Every star got extra stats back in the day.  MJ won DPOY fair and square.  Players like Hakeem, Mark Eaton had their rebounds, blocks and steals juiced too.  I would argue that juicing your stats was the only way to win any award back in the day.  Most players just didn&rsquo;t have MJ&rsquo;s mentality and didn&rsquo;t do everything to get the scorekeeper to juice the stats.</p>
