So while his home totals went way up in his DPOY season, his away totals also went way down. Not quite balancing out because his overall steals average did go up .3 and his blocks up .1 But nothing crazy either.</p>

      <label for="l9tyr7z" class="commentText"><p>From the article, it looks like Tom and his friend watched the tapes independently and then compared their notes, and they found what seem to be dead-ball turnovers (i.e. passes out of bounds, travels, etc.) get added to Jordans steals numbers</p>

<p><a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/a-closer-look-at-michael-jordans-1988-dpoy-award-raises-questions-about-its-validity-has-lebron-james-been-chasing-a-ghost-140452567.html" target="_blank">https://sports.yahoo.com/a-closer-look-at-michael-jordans-1988-dpoy-award-raises-questions-about-its-validity-has-lebron-james-been-chasing-a-ghost-140452567.html</a></p>

<p>All in all, by our count, the box score showed 59 steals on 41 live-ball turnovers, resulting in a whopping 18 excess steals.</p>

<p>Who benefited from all those extra steals? We brought our attention to Jordan’s accounting. In the six games, the box scores indicated that Jordan’s total steal count was 28. After comparing our notes from the film study, we each counted 12 steals. An astounding difference of 16 excess steals. Almost every excess steal was being allocated to Jordan.</p>

<p>A pattern emerged as the games began to pile up in our film review. It appeared that Jordan benefited from deflections being erroneously recorded as steals. In games where there was a surplus of Jordan steals, we noticed that the turnover/steal counts would closer align after we counted the defensive plays that Jordan poked the ball out of bounds or back into the hands of the opposing team — even if there was no change of possession.</p>

<p>Steals should not be awarded in these instances, but Jordan seemed to benefit from the apparent generosity. And here’s the thing: when other players made the same deflections on both teams, their steal counts tended to be scored by the book — that is, correctly. Twelve steals in six games for Jordan (two steals per game) would be much more in line with his road average that season (2.3) rather than his official home average of four steals.</p>

<p>We already know that stat keepers are still fudging assists all the way through the current year, so is this a problem that has existed off and on? Always? Is there anything besides points that we can absolutely say hasn&rsquo;t been negatively impacted by poor scorekeeping?</p>

      <label for="l9urg3x" class="commentText"><p>The super lopsided splits were pretty much only in ‘88, and those were only stocks. Even Habestrom acknowledged it as an outlier.</p>

<p>On the whole, Jordan’s career home/road splits aren’t out of line with what you saw from other all-time players.</p>

<p>So, probably not much.</p>

I addressed every basketball-related point you made, none of which you could respond to, which ended in you continually diverting from the topic and concern-trolling about my mental health for a solid two hours of your life, likely as some odd cope over getting dragged on the specifics of the conversation. Mind you, I remained civil for as long as you were.</p>

<p>edit: I invite anyone to go look at the conversation from yesterday this guy is talking about. It&rsquo;s even more hysterical when <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dluqmb/comment/l9raiqi/" target="_blank">you look at what started it all</a> and the fact that this dude tries to retroactively suggest that it makes him correct. Bringing up home/road splits as evidence that someone did not favor from scorekeeping bias is completely wrong, because ROAD SCOREKEEPERS WERE ALSO BIASED in favor of the superstars. There&rsquo;s no one who has a hard time understanding this besides this guy. I&rsquo;m not blocking him because I genuinely want him to be able to show the full thread to someone who cares about him. If all the stuff in his response that he wrote after this edit makes sense, I&rsquo;m happy for him.</p>

      <label for="l9whyld" class="commentText"><p>I never said road scorekeepers can’t be or aren’t biased, nor do I deny it.</p>

<p>Since you <em>insist</em> on having the same (non)conversation in another thread, fine, I’ll copy and paste the responses that apparently broke your brain yesterday, and caused you to claim you didn’t read. No point starting anew:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Boss, this isn&rsquo;t something you can disagree with. You need to actually read that article if you think that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Boss, I both read and agree with the article. I just don’t co-sign the other, far-reaching conclusions some people derive from it. Something I’ve continually attempted to convey here, which keeps falling on deaf ears.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since you read the article you no doubt remember the analogy of Bill Laimbeir accurately explaining to the basketball media that the total number of points given up is not an accurate measurement of how good a defense is, it&rsquo;s totally fallacious and citing that shows you don&rsquo;t actually understand what makes a defense successful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I agree raw totals/counting stats do not accurately capture how good a defence is. 10000000% agree. They are influenced by many other factors, not least of which are pace and overall offensive climate of the league.</p>

<p>I have no idea, none whatsoever, how that analogy is relevant here. I am not touting the primacy of raw counting stats.</p>

<p>I am not even suggesting that other forms of statistical manipulation haven’t taken place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Citing home/road splits as evidence that there is not a statkeeping bias in someone&rsquo;s favor is exactly the same</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not claiming there’s no stat-keeping bias. And who knows, Jordan may have benefited more from it than anyone else.</p>

<p>What I am claiming, very plainly, is that:</p>

<p>•	⁠his stats in 1988 were clearly manipulated beyond the extent of the average star in the average year. We can conclude that with some measure of certainty.</p>

<p>•	⁠the rest of Jordan’s statistics, or splits on the whole, do not feature the same smoking guns. That doesn’t definitively prove there was no bias. It simply means they do not feature the same smoking guns. Which means ‘88 was a statistical outlier. Nothing loftier than that.</p>

<p>•	⁠We cannot conclude, based on his manipulated defensive stats in ‘88, that he uniquely benefited from a broader scorekeeping bias  over the whole of his career. That part is less clear. Even Haberstrom doesn’t argue it was conclusive, or anything close to that.</p>

<p>^ these are all important because the person I’ve responded to was taking the content in the article to reach conclusions that don’t follow from it (that Jordan was stealing accolades from Pippen). That’s why I cited it.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean there wasn’t a broader scorekeeping bias. It doesn’t mean the splits I cite are conclusive proof <em>against</em> a scorekeeping bias. It’s merely a pointer that the season stats in ‘88, the main focus of the article, can’t be extrapolated much to the rest of Jordan’s career. That’s all. It’s several-fold less cartoonish than you’re making it out to be.</p>

<p>Surreal stuff. I’m not asking you to steelman my positions but at least try to characterize them accurately. Not much to ask for.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You need to catch up and realize this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’re probably too immersed in this to admit fault.</p>

<p>Oh well, let’s see how far this goes.</p>

      <label for="l9wifcc" class="commentText"><p>con’t, and your last attempt to keep it even remotely about basketball:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your comment cited home/away splits as evidence that MJ was not getting favorable treatment from scorekeepers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did no such thing (edit: now that these replies are placed B2B it really comes evident that I did no such thing, LOL).</p>

<p>What I did argue, as I keep reiterating, is that his remaining home-road splits cannot be used as <em>evidence</em> he was given a favourable shake the rest of the time. It doesn’t mean he <em>wasn’t,</em> for other reasons <em>not</em> captured by the splits. I imagine he was, as most stars likely were around that time.</p>

<p>It just doesn’t constitute direct evidence for it.</p>

<p>‘88, meanwhile, does (at least in my opinion) constitute good evidence. That’s all. Nothing else in the statistical record is comparable as a smoking gun to ‘88, and there’s no compelling evidence to suggest Jordan stole accolades from Pippen (which is what the initial commenter stated).</p>

<p>Hoping thay cleared things up for you. Let me know which specific thing you disagreed with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stop doing that. It&rsquo;s a fallacy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn’t. Stop misrepresenting my more nuanced position with loose paraphrases. It’s a fallacy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I hope that helped. No one wants to read your hormonal outburst.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right. Yet you’re still here.</p>

<p>What’s more likely is that you did in fact read it and can’t address the points therein, so you fall back on generalities, mockery and mental health putdowns. Hoping this is just your online persona, and not how you treat the people in your personal life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jordan might be the most petty athlete to walk the face of the earth</strong>, and it might’ve been a contributing factor to why he achieved so much in a time where all of our eyes were fixated on him. Even with all the public knows about him, the bits and pieces that have been doled out through the years or revealed in some way, it craves more because Jordan gave out only crumbs.</p>

<p><strong>Even his flaws have somehow turned into badges of honor through the years, his beefs and feuds causing many of his fanboys to take up his own grievances as their own.</strong></p>

<p>It goes back to a monoculture that cannot be reclaimed, a time where perhaps sports emotions felt more pure and raw rather than filtered and cultivated by PR teams and well-timed social-media blasts.</p>

<p>So because <strong>Jordan was petty and held beefs, his followers had no problem doing the same.</strong></p>

      <label for="l9ssqwo" class="commentText"><p>The NBA has come a long way since. No way someone gets a steal on a dead ball turnover and it doesn’t get caught.</p>

<p>There’s always going to be some degree of a judgement call on edge case assists, or whether an edge case tip (rebound) or deflection (steal) was controlled just enough or not quite. But those are tiny compared to giving a steal on a travel or a block on a foul.</p>

      <label for="l9tfyei" class="commentText"><p>Play-by-play was absolutely the first big step. But the more recent easy access to full game tape as well as video clips linked to the play-by-play we have now makes it much more difficult still for anything untoward to happen — that goes hand in hand with routine review of games and box score adjustments that the league now does.</p>

The Home/Away numbers had an even higher disparity than these and, if memory serves, a Grizzlies fan proved the whole thing was nonsense and Jackson was just playing better at home. You need to watch the tapes, you can’t just assume that the numbers are too crazy to be real because it has been shown that type of disparity can be real.</p>

      <label for="l9v58px" class="commentText"><p>No, you want ammo to crown LeFlop the GOAT. It&rsquo;s beyond obvious - there&rsquo;s literally a video in 2017 of Tom Haberstroh calling LeFlop the GOAT, there&rsquo;s a separate video of him calling Kobe not clutch in front of Tracy McGrady - who called his dumb ass out. </p>

<p>There are entire YouTube channels set up with hundreds of thousands if not millions of views, pointing out the evidence that Klutch Sports and their bosom boys in the media (Tommy boy, Nick Wright, JJ Reddick - he got a head coaching job out of it!) are trying their hardest to tear Jordan down because they&rsquo;ve finally accepted LeFlop will never catch him in the GOAT debate no matter what he does. No one cared when LeFlop won his 3rd or 4th championship, no one cared when he passed Kareem, no one cared when he hit 40K points. And so the new angle is to downplay and tear down Jordan&rsquo;s (forget the 90s, they played against plumbers, the league was expanded, Pippen was the only reason MJ won, and now this). </p>

<p>Do you know that Tommy boy devoted an entire section of his article to complain that people call MJ the GOAT because he won a DPOY and LeBron didn&rsquo;t? In an article that is supposed to be about Jordan&rsquo;s DPOY season, he still apparently feels the need to take an entire section to build LeFlop up and tear MJ down. Kinda suspicious as to his motives, huh? </p>

<p>Also where is Tom&rsquo;s evidence? Why didn&rsquo;t he include video evidence of his assertions? Why should I believe a guy who would gladly gargle LeFlop&rsquo;s balls given the opportunity??</p>

<p>And then to extrapolate that to Jordan didn&rsquo;t deserve the award, and if he didn&rsquo;t deserve the award then LeFlop is <em>the real</em> GOAT.</p>

<p>Go read the actual article. Go look into Haberstroh&rsquo;s past comments and statements. Show me the video evidence. Otherwise who cares what a lazy fuck like you thinks</p>

<p>Uh, because the NBA owns the video rights to the games and he doesn&rsquo;t want to get sued for unauthorized redistribution? But I get it, it must be hard to realize something like that with so many conspiracies crowding out the useful knowledge.</p>

Then next we start talking about his push off in game 6 of the 98 finals and we make the NBA call an offensive foul and now we get the teams back together and they play a game 7 for the 98 finals on July 30th, MJs entire legacy is on the line here obviously</p>

<p>If you tell me some of his recorded stats are questionable, ok.  But if we go back further I’m sure it gets worse.</p>

Tom&rsquo;s article has a section where he talks with Bob Ryan about things, and Bill Russell and Wilt&rsquo;s rebounds come up:</p>

<p><a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/a-closer-look-at-michael-jordans-1988-dpoy-award-raises-questions-about-its-validity-has-lebron-james-been-chasing-a-ghost-140452567.html" target="_blank">https://sports.yahoo.com/a-closer-look-at-michael-jordans-1988-dpoy-award-raises-questions-about-its-validity-has-lebron-james-been-chasing-a-ghost-140452567.html</a></p>

<p>He remembers similar controversies surrounding Wilt Chamberlain’s and Bill Russell’s rebounding numbers in the 1960s. Their respective teams traded accusations that the opposing scorekeeper padded the stats to help their giant. Looking back, the numbers are indeed startling. Between them, Russell and Chamberlain registered 26 games with 40-plus rebounds. None of the 26 games were tabulated on the road, per Stathead.com tracking.</p>

<p>Jordan was good, but he wasn&rsquo;t other worldly. I think if people watch that second 3-peat you will not be impressed. I will argue that 1993 season it felt every Bulls game I saw Jordan was unstoppable.</p>

      <label for="l9uku9q" class="commentText"><p>Then can he go through and check the home stats for a bunch of other stars from that era and find those discrepancies?  So he can find a way to normalize the stats for everyone and then take another look at Jordan&rsquo;s stats considering that?  Go watch five games of Mark Eaton film to make sure all his blocks were legit (article points out his home/road splits were just as egregious as Jordan&rsquo;s).  Make sure all of Hakeem&rsquo;s steals were legit.</p>

<p>All the games he looked at were at Chicago.  Can he prove that the scorekeepers in visiting arenas didn&rsquo;t do the opposite and artificially deflate Jordan&rsquo;s stats?  You don&rsquo;t think some scorekeeper in the Boston Garden at that time didn&rsquo;t knock a steal or assist or two off Jordan from time to time?</p>

<p>Every star had home cookin in terms of stats in that era.  A tiny percentage of regular season games were on national TV.  No one outside the local markets were watching these random games.  That&rsquo;s acknowledged in the article talking about guys from the 1960s.</p>

<p>This whole thing just seems like he had a conclusion (stats were cooked) and worked backwards from it and found a way to work in Jordan because he knew that would get headlines.  That DPOY &ldquo;may be the most consequential Defensive Player of the Year award in NBA history&rdquo;?  Give me a break.</p>

      <label for="l9unct2" class="commentText"><p>Jordan was THE guy the NBA marketed and made the NBA huge at that time. Finding out his stats were falsely inflated is a lot more significant than finding out Mark Eaton or some other random players stars were inflated. We still compare Jordan to players today he is considered universally to be the GOAT NBA player. If his stats are inflated it means a lot more to general NBA discourse as his stats and accomplishments are still brought up to this day to compare to modern players (LeBron). If other player stats were inflated from that time period it honestly just looks worse for Jordan when comparing him to modern players. Michael Jordan has been the global face of the NBA for decades, it is meaningful.</p>

<p>I for one think it would have some implications on the rest of Jordan’s career and the league as a whole. Like if he did it one year did he do it any others? Who else in the league did this? When did it start?</p>

<p>But I found this boring since it was ancient…</p>

<p>I shouldve said this “it doesn’t impact todays league”</p>

<p>And most importantly, I don’t think this is that big a secret. We all heard rumor or players complaining regarding this.</p>

<p>This revealing, at least to me, is very staged just for the off season. Which kinda turn me off on this. Weak draft and dominating champion run. Very boring offseason</p>

<p>The only Biggest real plot is where Bronny ends up</p>

MJ helped transcend the NBA into an international business, it helped Nike with basketball sneakers and apparel, brought eyeballs to the TV and stadiums, etc.  look at the billion dollar contracts that the NBA is being courted with…This would not be possible without MJ.  (Can’t forget Magic, Kareem, Bill, Larry and the rest but MJ elevated the business of the NBA to a new level).</p>

<p>Kobe did the same with the Asian market and was trying to get his feet wet with helping promote the WNBA.</p>

No one was surprised that Warriors won 2 championships with KD but also no one really cares because they were obviously so much better. The Knicks were the biggest rival to the Bulls in the East during that era and their second best player was Jon Starks LOL compared to the Bulls having Pippen it’s no competition.</p>

Would everyone even agree on where the discrepancies are? Also how do we know scorekeepers aren’t being disingenuous to players on the away team? This really just makes a whole lot of questions vs what I think of MJ as a player or defender</p>

Nephews want to talk about “witnessing”, you actually were when it came to Jordan, not this self proclaimed nonsense. Dig up all the tapes and recount all the steals, boards, assists, turnovers you want. Hell, take back the DPOY if you want. What’s that gonna do? Nothing, Jordan will remain unsurpassed for yet another generation. End of story.</p>

      <label for="l9szsrf" class="commentText"><p>Who cares about all of this? It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re going to take away his DPOY because I <em>highly</em> doubt that Jordan himself told them to do that</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s not like this will be the catalyst for any change because the NBA has already taken huge strides in accurately collecting data</p>

<p>How do we not know that the NBA themselves already knew of this stuff and that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;ve pushed for changes when it comes to collecting data?</p>
