    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Let&rsquo;s have some 90s Big Men matchup.</p>

<p>David Robinson, the admiral. And Charles &ldquo;the round mound  of rebound&rdquo; Barkley both won 1 MVP in their career.</p>

<p>They both also make the finals/conf finals. Only to lose to a superior superstar rival.</p>

<p>But in a vacuum,</p>

<p>Who do you think ws the better player between David Robinson and Charles Barkley?</p>

<p>Especially for those who saw their live matchups back then.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>And I like Barkley more, but there&rsquo;s just no denying that Robinson was the better player. Even on the offensive end he was better than Barkley, and he was certainly far better defensively.</p>

      <label for="l8zh3bp" class="commentText"><p>I would say it’s difficult to say he was better than Barkley on offense.</p>

<p>Robinson was very good on offense in the regular season, posting higher volume seasons(although on lower efficiency) than Barkley.</p>

<p>But he absolutely fell apart in the playoffs because his game wasn’t nuanced enough and based on bully ball against weaker and slower defenders, offensive rebounding and finishing off actions.</p>

<p>I’d rather have Robinsons offense as a secondary piece though as it’s more versatile. Barkley couldn’t shoot despite shooting a lot of 3s for some reason.</p>

      <label for="l8zf138" class="commentText"><p>It’s clearly Robinson. He is one of the greatest defenders of all time, and although his scoring never held up in the playoffs because of a lack of great post moves or a speciality on offense, he still authored plenty of great regular seasons on that end on higher volume than Barkley, although lower efficiency(but still good, 4-6 percent ahead of league average)</p>

<p>Barkley was a below average defender as he was too small for PF but too slow for a regular SF. He played on 9 below average defensive teams in 10 seasons. His efficiency was remarkable but he never ramped his volume up enough to be a true scoring great like a Harden, Durant, MJ etc</p>

<p>He was also ball dominant which would make it difficult to build a truly great team around him. He was mostly based on isolation scoring. His offensive rebounding and passing would be useful next to another star, but aside from that he’s completely useless without the ball in his hands.</p>

<p>Robinson was an excellent secondary piece as he later showed with Duncan because of his defense, passing and ability to scale down his scoring. Because his game was so simple eg finishing, face up shooting, outbacks. Barkleys game required running down the shot clock and spreading the court for him</p>
