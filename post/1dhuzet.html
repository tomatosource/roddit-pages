      <p>Let&rsquo;s have some 90s Big Men matchup.</p>

<p>David Robinson, the admiral. And Charles &ldquo;the round mound  of rebound&rdquo; Barkley both won 1 MVP in their career.</p>

<p>They both also make the finals/conf finals. Only to lose to a superior superstar rival.</p>

<p>But in a vacuum,</p>

<p>Who do you think ws the better player between David Robinson and Charles Barkley?</p>

<p>Especially for those who saw their live matchups back then.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>Comparable offensively, maybe a slight edge to Charles.  But prime Drob was the best defender in the NBA and easily top 20 defender of all time.  Any edge to Charles on the offensive end gets eviscerated by the huge gap on defense as Charles was an average defender at best.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like comparing Giannis to KAT defensively.  People underestimate how hard Robinson had to carry the sorry ass spurs before TD came.  They literally went from a 60 win team to a 20 win team when he got injured which luckily allowed them to draft Duncan in the first place.</p>

<p>And I like Barkley more, but there&rsquo;s just no denying that Robinson was the better player. Even on the offensive end he was better than Barkley, and he was certainly far better defensively.</p>

      <label for="l8zh3bp" class="commentText"><p>I would say it’s difficult to say he was better than Barkley on offense.</p>

<p>Robinson was very good on offense in the regular season, posting higher volume seasons(although on lower efficiency) than Barkley.</p>

<p>But he absolutely fell apart in the playoffs because his game wasn’t nuanced enough and based on bully ball against weaker and slower defenders, offensive rebounding and finishing off actions.</p>

<p>I’d rather have Robinsons offense as a secondary piece though as it’s more versatile. Barkley couldn’t shoot despite shooting a lot of 3s for some reason.</p>

      <label for="l8zipvs" class="commentText"><p>You raise a good point with regard to offence, and looking back at the numbers, it&rsquo;s clear that peak Barkley was a more efficient scorer.</p>

<p>That said, when you brought up bully ball, Barkley is the first name that comes to mind whenever somebody mentions bully ball. Barkley and Shaq. Barkley was a master at throwing his weight around in the post to get close to the basket. It wasn&rsquo;t like the smooth footwork of McHale and Hakeem but the brute force of a bear that seemed to get Barkley those shots close to the basket.</p>

<p>Robinson didn&rsquo;t have foot work as good as Hakeem&rsquo;s. That&rsquo;s certainly true, but he wasn&rsquo;t just a bully ball guy. He could face up and put the ball on the floor, a lot like Amare could, and to get guys to come out to him to beat them on the dribble, he had to have a reliable jumped. To that end, he took a lot of jumpers.</p>

<p>He was also a great play maker. To Barkley&rsquo;s case, he was also a great play maker and got to 4 apg by his third year at age 23, where it took DRob 5 seasons and age 28 to get there.</p>

<p>Re-examining the offensive side with your input, I&rsquo;d have to agree with you. There&rsquo;s a clear edge for Barkley. If DRob had entered the NBA earlier, I think things would have been a little different, but we can&rsquo;t go by what-ifs here.</p>

<p>However, I think DRob was a legit first option, and had he been surrounded like shooters and a great point guard, like Barkley had in Phoenix, he would have thrived.</p>

<p>Looking at the defensive end, I don&rsquo;t think there is much of a debate there. Though Barkley certainyl got his fair share of steals and an impressive amount of blocks for an undersized forward (a lot of those, like Bird, coming from high BBIQ), he was never a legit consideration for an All Defensive team, whereas DRob was a DPOY.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d still say DRonn &amp;gt; Barkley easily, but my score card (based on your points) would have to be adjusted to go Barkley&rsquo;s way.</p>

      <label for="l8zf138" class="commentText"><p>It’s clearly Robinson. He is one of the greatest defenders of all time, and although his scoring never held up in the playoffs because of a lack of great post moves or a speciality on offense, he still authored plenty of great regular seasons on that end on higher volume than Barkley, although lower efficiency(but still good, 4-6 percent ahead of league average)</p>

<p>Barkley was a below average defender as he was too small for PF but too slow for a regular SF. He played on 9 below average defensive teams in 10 seasons. His efficiency was remarkable but he never ramped his volume up enough to be a true scoring great like a Harden, Durant, MJ etc</p>

<p>He was also ball dominant which would make it difficult to build a truly great team around him. He was mostly based on isolation scoring. His offensive rebounding and passing would be useful next to another star, but aside from that he’s completely useless without the ball in his hands.</p>

<p>Robinson was an excellent secondary piece as he later showed with Duncan because of his defense, passing and ability to scale down his scoring. Because his game was so simple eg finishing, face up shooting, outbacks. Barkleys game required running down the shot clock and spreading the court for him</p>
