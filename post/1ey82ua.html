<p>I think that’s a fair encapsulation of all the post-wars going on today and just the general perception of him. </p>

<p>He was a great player.</p>

<p>He was an asshole.</p>

<p>He was a champion.</p>

<p>He was an inefficient player.</p>

<p>He’s one of the best ever.</p>

<p>He’s overrated by many.</p>

<p>All of these statements can be true at the same time. </p>

      <label for="ljdy1vv" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t know why you got downvoted, but it&rsquo;s true. Kobe&rsquo;s off nights were baaaaad, which is how he got the chucker reputation. Like some of those FG statlines would have you thinking Westbrook&rsquo;s bad nights were decent. Kobe still owns the record for most missed shots in a single game (30), and I&rsquo;d bet most people on this sub don&rsquo;t even know what game that was. Not even his last game had this many missed shots and mf took 50 that game.</p>

<p>Basically, in a very simplistic way to sum up Kobe&rsquo;s career, he has very high highs and very low lows. He&rsquo;s streaky, as Phil once said.</p>

      <label for="ljdx4wr" class="commentText"><p>That is the route they chose to take, the statement they chose to put out we have to consider it!</p>

<p>I was reading this article about the apology last night to refresh my memory and it talks about how different it was from other statements made in similar cases. It is absolutely not the norm to admit to wrongdoing in a settlement statement, and this was a statement that was not a condition of the settlement.</p>

      <label for="lje5c5x" class="commentText"><p>You’re leaning on this article like it’s the smoking gun. Just because the statement was different dont mean it’s proof of guilt or some shit. It was carefully crafted to acknowledge her perspective without admitting some real shit. That’s what lawyers and PR teams do in when shit hits the fan…they walk the line. And you’re saying it wasn’t part of the settlement but you think they didn’t negotiate that whole thing behind closed doors? Come on. It was strategic and both sides needed a way to close this mess.</p>

<p>You’re treating this like Kobe confessing is a fact when really it’s about making the whole thing go away. If he was truly guilty, why didn’t he face criminal charges? They didn’t just disappear by magic. You can’t pick and choose which details matter and which don’t based on your bias. The article doesn’t change the reality that this case was built on shaky ground and a settlement can happen for so many freaking reasons</p>

      <label for="ljeb16j" class="commentText"><p>But you’re picking and choosing details! Kobes’s statement is an important detail that you’re waving away. This is the chosen narrative by Kobe and you’re waving it away, not based on concrete evidence. Your bias is present as well as mine is, and of course mine is, it can’t not be.</p>

<p>There is no evidence that the response was part of the settlement, which is a possibility sure, but you’ve decided that it is based on biases. You provide no evidence that discounts this statement, it’s just conjecture. All you say is “come on,” and that shows that neither you or I really know what happened.</p>

<p>Whether or not it was part of the settlement isn’t the most pertinent detail though, in my opinion, as I’ll explain.</p>

<p>You say this is what PR and lawyers are for but this article is about how this response was different. That is why I posted this article, not as a smoking gun, but to provide this perspective.</p>

<p>Because you say that they craft these to not admit real shit but Kobe did admit in this statement that he understood that it had not been consensual. This precisely is what I think is important here. You say why did he not face charges (I think you mean convicted because he was charged)? I can say, why did he admit to wrongdoing in his statement, in contrast to how other cases are commonly settled, if he did not do anything? Or if it’s how you say, why would he agree to admit wrongdoing if he was not in danger of being found guilty?</p>

<p>As I already said, we can’t know for certain what happened, but to ignore what Kobe himself said is irresponsible. This is not about passing judgements, it’s about what we can learn from situations like this. Sexual assault cases almost never lead to convictions, and the women (and less often but still important men) affected, especially in high profile cases, often have their lives destroyed.</p>

<p>Kobe’s accusers name was mistakenly made public three different times in this case when it was supposed to be kept private! Three times! This caused her to be targeted on a national stage. Imagine what that’s like if he did do it, and she was seeking some sort of justice, and all of a sudden the entire country is coming down on her, scrutinizing her sexual past, calling her a whore for having multiple partners and acting like that would disprove an assault.</p>

<p>The accuser had friends who were reportedly willing to testify against her credibility. She had also been bragging about having a plan to have sex with Eminem and trap him.</p>

<p>DNA evidence showed she had sexual contact with a bunch of other people shortly after the alleged assault</p>

<p>There was also inconsistencies in her story and she blatantly lied too and admitted it.</p>

<p>Why even put yourself in that situation.  For someone who was so calculating and demanding on the court he was Charmin soft in the head when it came to picking random girls to have non-consensual rough sex with.</p>

      <label for="ljcy091" class="commentText"><p>You’re oversimplifying shit just to fit your narrative of some weird deep desire to call someone a rapist without proof. Jumping straight to “bruises and blood = rape” is straight missing that people can engage in rough sex and still be consensual. Assuming you know exactly what went down based on some details is reckless. Super reckless. Yeah it’s easy to say he shouldn’t have been in that situation but being in a messed up situation don’t make someone a rapist. Just cause it’s messy doesn’t mean it’s as cut-and-dried as you trying to make it.</p>

<p>The ‘mamba’ nickname is associated mostly with his mentality, but I think it’s also a perfect descriptor for the way he could contort and turn at explosive speeds while slashing through packed defenses.</p>

      <label for="ljd9289" class="commentText"><p>Which areas of his offensive game do you consider superior to Kevin Durant&rsquo;s?</p>

<p>Durant has WAY better career shooting percentages, and despite never being on a shit team that let him jack 20-30 shots per game with horrible efficiency, Durant still has a considerably higher career PPG, better assist numbers, and can fill pretty much every offensive role on the floor.</p>

      <label for="ljdxkvb" class="commentText"><p>This is gonna sound like a meme response, but I genuinely think Durant cares about his percentages too much to the detriment of his overall offensive game. He’ll consistently give you 30 on good percentages but he lacks the willingness or aggressiveness to really really start chucking even when his team would benefit. There’s even quotes of him saying he doesn’t like taking end of quarter/half heaves because it brings down his 3 pt percentages.</p>

<p>There’s a reason he only has 9 50 point games and Kobe has 29 even though Kobe objectively played in a lower pace era and before the explosion of the three ball. Durant has a higher floor as a scorer because he’ll almost never have a bad shooting night, but he’ll also never give you a 60 point game on 40 attempts either. For how good of a scorer he is, a career high of 55 is surprisingly low.</p>

Listen to the way his peers speak about him. Literally all of them. He consistently made more tough shots than anyone in the league in his era. A lot of which while being the focal point of the entire defense on a nightly basis. Makes sense to look at his 3 point shot in the same way as some catch and shoot player right? Foh, Kobe was masterful and a certified top 10 player ever with a top 3 offensive package.</p>

      <label for="lje2dpq" class="commentText"><p>I’ll maintain that Kobe went from being overrated to severely underrated very quickly. It seems like his last couple years really ruined his legacy as the younger fans came in. Fans now when looking at old greats also just look at stats and see that he’s inefficient compared to today’s players without knowing the context of what early 2000s basketball was.</p>

<p>Kobe wasn’t perfect but he was the highest volume shooter in history and he always maintained a higher efficiency average than the rest of the league despite his difficult shot diet.</p>

<p>That is absolutely valuable especially during the early 2000s era</p>

<p>The fact that we won multiple chips with Derek Fisher&rsquo;s geriatric ass getting blown by 10 times each game is a miracle.</p>

Odom was definitely the third best player, but he was super inconsistent (makes sense knowing all his off court issues).</p>

<p>Had a Duncan fan tell me Derek Fisher was better than Tony Parker and Stephen Jackson lol.</p>

Sasha Vujacic, Jordan Farmar, Shannon Brown, Ronny Turiaf, Luke Walton, Vladimir Radmanovic, even Fisher, Odom and Bynum had only a year or 2 left in them. Odom was an average player before the Lakers, Fish was a bench player on average Jazz teams.</p>

He’s maybe the best tough shot maker of all time but one big issue of his was he tended to take a ton of tough shots and wasn’t the greatest at generating clean looks. He was elite anyways and a winner so it doesn’t matter but in the all time conversation it’s hard for me to give him the same credit as other top tier offensive players because he couldn’t consistently generate open looks for himself or others like a lot of them could. Still, with his skills and shot making along with volume, his peaks and heaters are still among the greatest scoring games and multi-game stretches ever</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s too bad the lakers couldn&rsquo;t build a better team around him at the time. Sure, he is &ldquo;only&rdquo; a top 10 player all time, but hes my numero uno when it comes to funnest player to ever watch since I started watching the league in the late 90s</p>

      <label for="ljeqcwb" class="commentText"><p>Yeah he went on a real heater, but &ldquo;only&rdquo; averaged 31ppg in 2007. Previous season he averaged 35ppg, which was crazy. Highest scoring average since MJ in 1987. Only Harden has scored more since. He was 27-28 at the time, prime NBA age.</p>

<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t matter&hellip;.in both 2006 and 2007 Lakers got whooped by Nash and the Suns in round 1.</p>

      <label for="ljbx5qw" class="commentText"><p>I’ve been a bit hard on Kobe lately when a post comes up, but for me it’s more Kobe fans constantly having this superior attitude about Kobe.</p>

<p>As a Lebron fan, I will give Kobe my utmost respect and to be honest I don’t care if you think Kobe was better or the goat along with other great players.</p>

<p>But I think the issue is Kobe fans constantly put him into this  obnoxious pedestals  whether  on or off the court that sometimes is even disrespectful to players from the past.</p>

<p>I agree  Kobe 2008-2010 was arguably  best player in the game, but I feel when I was watching ball back in 2006-2007 and after 2010 when Lebrkn and to Miami, Kobe never was this clear cut or never was talked like this unstoppable god. Like with Dirk, people forget Dirk led the Mavs consistently in the west and was hands down MVP in 2007 even if they choked against GS in the first round that year.</p>

<p>And yes he had talent, but I love Laker fans hyping Kobe carrying Pau and Odom when for me Dirk carried and probably made guys like Josh Howard, the Jet, and Devin Harris better. Now Terry and  Harris were  solid players, Harris an all star at one point, but he never live duo to it. Josh Howard was a great player for Mavs but fell off for some reason. Maybe injures but I’m just saying for me Dirk did something I think Kobe did and people act like Kobe was million times better than him. Let’s not forget in 2011 with argaubly an older team with older role players, he swept the Lakers fresh off a title win in 2010 and beat Lebron in 2011 to wins ring.</p>

<p>And Kobe is better than Dirk for anyone who will be sensitive, but I’m just saying people acting like Kobe was only one even during his time doing great things. I just feel alone fans think he was the only great clutch player and was head above everyone else. I just never saw this mystical feel with Kobe like I feel I have seen with some MJ videos.</p>

<p>And this is relates to Lebrkn as a fan of his. I will always defend Lebrkn and think he is personally top3 all times but why I agree he isn’t the GOAT is he showed more imperfections like Kobe and pretty much of the legends outside MJ. I feel it’s hard for fans to realize the difference between a player even with MJ is close so you can’t really 100% know the outcomes.</p>

<p>I just feel if Kobe fans and to be fair even Lebron fans didn’t glorify these players as unstoppable and admitted and accepted flaws as they note achievements everything would be better.l with discourse.</p>

<p>Lastly, I feel for Kobe fans as well because I get Lebron fans being annoying haye and can’t take criticism arguably worse cosndkering what Kobe fans have faced for a while;l, but I feel Kobe fans for years have brought this idolizing Kobe with this cringe Taylor swift attitude.</p>

<p>We see it today in the Lin thread, how many of these guys were assuming people were incels or like participants trophies for criticizing Kobe’s methods.</p>

      <label for="ljc0jmi" class="commentText"><p>Dirk had Jason Kidd and Shawn Marion, which you conveniently left out, along with Tyson Chandler (DPOY) and Jason Terry (6MOTY). Kobe during the 2008-2010 season lost a starter in each of those runs and was fielding Vladimir Radmanovic, Sasha Vujacic, Jordan Farmar, Derrick Fisher, Shannon Brown and Luke Walton as his support (outside of Gasol/Odom). Let me not forget Odom was literally on CRACK.</p>

      <label for="ljc7u5f" class="commentText"><p>Oh wow Bynum, Ariza, Artest all sucked and finishing fisher who was on like 5-6 championship teams with Kobe.</p>

<p>And yeah I admittedly forgot about the 2011 Mavs players but I didn’t say they were one crap team Dirk Carried but I’m just saying he did a similar thing Kobe did carrying a well balanced rooster of role players.</p>

<p>And it comes to the point Kobe fans talking shit about every player he played  with and that Kobe did everything and carried everyone even compared to Jordan and the bulls.</p>

<p>There’s no point because all Kobe fans want is world of basketball to revolve around Kobe and think that’s only way of basketball is only  him as this unstoppable god and disrespecting other greats like they aren’t close to Kobe.</p>

      <label for="ljc8bi1" class="commentText"><p>Bynum did suck in those runs, he was hurt all the time. Ariza was a bit player, Artest old. Fisher got beat constantly by opposing PGs and hitting a few game winners doesn’t make him amazing. Dirk had one single run with Jason Kidd, Shawn Marion, a DPOY and a 6MOY vs 3 straight runs by Kobe. At no point did I disrespect any greats but Kobe’s supporting cast outside of Pau (who had bad series against the Suns and Spurs btw) was not good.</p>

      <label for="ljd9oqx" class="commentText"><p>Please take a look at the 2006-2007 Lakers roster. Kobe never had a shot at MVP that season. If you weren’t a top 2 seed back then you weren’t gonna get it and that roster never had a chance for that. The fact that Kobe was even 3rd in MVP voting on a 42 win team back then tells you everything you need to know</p>
