<p>I think that’s a fair encapsulation of all the post-wars going on today and just the general perception of him. </p>

<p>He was a great player.</p>

<p>He was an asshole.</p>

<p>He was a champion.</p>

<p>He was an inefficient player.</p>

<p>He’s one of the best ever.</p>

<p>He’s overrated by many.</p>

      <label for="ljdy1vv" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t know why you got downvoted, but it&rsquo;s true. Kobe&rsquo;s off nights were baaaaad, which is how he got the chucker reputation. Like some of those FG statlines would have you thinking Westbrook&rsquo;s bad nights were decent. Kobe still owns the record for most missed shots in a single game (30), and I&rsquo;d bet most people on this sub don&rsquo;t even know what game that was. Not even his last game had this many missed shots and mf took 50 that game.</p>

<p>Basically, in a very simplistic way to sum up Kobe&rsquo;s career, he has very high highs and very low lows. He&rsquo;s streaky, as Phil once said.</p>

      <label for="ljbm0gt" class="commentText"><p>People usually say Kobe “admitted it” but that was a settlement statement that lawyers handle and by design, whether it’s about sexual assault or not, they are crafted to acknowledge a perspective while not admitting guilt. It’s not a reflection of what happened in the room.</p>

<p>The accuser had friends who were reportedly willing to testify against her credibility. She had also been bragging about having a plan to have sex with Eminem and trap him.</p>

<p>DNA evidence showed she had sexual contact with a bunch of other people shortly after the alleged assault</p>

<p>There was also inconsistencies in her story and she blatantly lied too and admitted it.</p>

They had sex and she had bruises and blood was everywhere.  Idk how many times you’ve had sex with a non-virgin not on her period but if shes bleeding and bruised she didnt want it.</p>

<p>Why even put yourself in that situation.  For someone who was so calculating and demanding on the court he was Charmin soft in the head when it came to picking random girls to have non-consensual rough sex with.</p>

      <label for="ljcy091" class="commentText"><p>You’re oversimplifying shit just to fit your narrative of some weird deep desire to call someone a rapist without proof. Jumping straight to “bruises and blood = rape” is straight missing that people can engage in rough sex and still be consensual. Assuming you know exactly what went down based on some details is reckless. Super reckless. Yeah it’s easy to say he shouldn’t have been in that situation but being in a messed up situation don’t make someone a rapist. Just cause it’s messy doesn’t mean it’s as cut-and-dried as you trying to make it.</p>

<p>Durant has WAY better career shooting percentages, and despite never being on a shit team that let him jack 20-30 shots per game with horrible efficiency, Durant still has a considerably higher career PPG, better assist numbers, and can fill pretty much every offensive role on the floor.</p>

      <label for="ljdxkvb" class="commentText"><p>This is gonna sound like a meme response, but I genuinely think Durant cares about his percentages too much to the detriment of his overall offensive game. He’ll consistently give you 30 on good percentages but he lacks the willingness or aggressiveness to really really start chucking even when his team would benefit. There’s even quotes of him saying he doesn’t like taking end of quarter/half heaves because it brings down his 3 pt percentages.</p>

<p>There’s a reason he only has 9 50 point games and Kobe has 29 even though Kobe objectively played in a lower pace era and before the explosion of the three ball. Durant has a higher floor as a scorer because he’ll almost never have a bad shooting night, but he’ll also never give you a 60 point game on 40 attempts either. For how good of a scorer he is, a career high of 55 is surprisingly low.</p>

<p>Kobe could breakdown a double team or shoot over it. He had the ability to do that, and that&rsquo;s a better percent than passing to someone else on the team to take a long 2 from Lamar Odom or Mihm or Parker cuz that&rsquo;s the era he played in and what the Triangle created.</p>

Kobe had the staggering numbers of 5, 5.3, 5.5, 4.9 and 5 assists per game in his 5 championship seasons. If you think that comes anywhere close to the assist numbers of Jokic, Bird and Lebron in theirs, boy do I have news for you:</p>

<p>Kobe&rsquo;s absolute career high in assists was 6.3 in <sup>2013</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub>, Jokic&rsquo;s worst was 6.1 (disregarding their first 2 years as bench players).</p>

<p>Lebrons worst was his rookie year, at 5.9. He&rsquo;s been better than kobe&rsquo;s career best in 17 seasons.</p>

<p>Bird&rsquo;s career average is exactly the same as Kobes career best.</p>

<p>Doncic has had 1 year (rookie) where he averaged less than kobe, at 6.0.</p>

<p>Again, I never said he was bad. I was saying there&rsquo;s far better passers, and passing should matter when talking about offense.</p>

      <label for="ljds71r" class="commentText"><p>This is such a tired take, he has the most assists as 2 guard in nba history. He also didnt average more assists because of how triangle offense worked, he WASNT SUPPOSED TO assists that much you had PGs to do that. If he was playing today in heliocentric era he would get more asissts and would pass more.</p>

      <label for="ljd61q5" class="commentText"><p>Shut up. Running to look at basketball reference and using that as the sole determinant of a players abilities is casual and just corny. Listen to the way his peers speak about him. Literally all of them. He consistently made more tough shots than anyone in the league in his era. A lot of which while being the focal point of the entire defense on a nightly basis. Makes sense to look at his 3 point shot in the same way as some catch and shoot player right? Foh, Kobe was masterful and a certified top 10 player ever with a top 3 offensive package.</p>

      <label for="lje2dpq" class="commentText"><p>I’ll maintain that Kobe went from being overrated to severely underrated very quickly. It seems like his last couple years really ruined his legacy as the younger fans came in. Fans now when looking at old greats also just look at stats and see that he’s inefficient compared to today’s players without knowing the context of what early 2000s basketball was.</p>

<p>Kobe wasn’t perfect but he was the highest volume shooter in history and he always maintained a higher efficiency average than the rest of the league despite his difficult shot diet.</p>

<p>That is absolutely valuable especially during the early 2000s era</p>

      <label for="ljg8yt8" class="commentText"><p>And reffing has pushed offense to new heights.  There is a reason a bunch of players are scoring more now than they have in 40+ years. Offense is allowed to get away with more than they have in the past, foul baiting is as bad as it’s ever been, and they call breathing fouls on jump shooters.  I’m not saying if it’s right or wrong, but objectively it very much seems more difficult to score 50 in Kobe’s prime than it is right now.</p>

<p>Almost all the players thought Kobe was best in the league.</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t believe people try to argue Duncan or Lebron were better than Kobe during those years.</p>

<p>The fact that we won multiple chips with Derek Fisher&rsquo;s geriatric ass getting blown by 10 times each game is a miracle.</p>

Odom was definitely the third best player, but he was super inconsistent (makes sense knowing all his off court issues).</p>

<p>Had a Duncan fan tell me Derek Fisher was better than Tony Parker and Stephen Jackson lol.</p>

And incredible regular season success, followed by great playoff success. If the warriors didn’t exist he would be viewed completely differently.</p>

<p>A team Lebron was 1-3 against in the finals btw. And without a BS Draymond suspension likely 0-4.</p>

      <label for="ljbx5qw" class="commentText"><p>I’ve been a bit hard on Kobe lately when a post comes up, but for me it’s more Kobe fans constantly having this superior attitude about Kobe.</p>

<p>As a Lebron fan, I will give Kobe my utmost respect and to be honest I don’t care if you think Kobe was better or the goat along with other great players.</p>

<p>But I think the issue is Kobe fans constantly put him into this  obnoxious pedestals  whether  on or off the court that sometimes is even disrespectful to players from the past.</p>

<p>I agree  Kobe 2008-2010 was arguably  best player in the game, but I feel when I was watching ball back in 2006-2007 and after 2010 when Lebrkn and to Miami, Kobe never was this clear cut or never was talked like this unstoppable god. Like with Dirk, people forget Dirk led the Mavs consistently in the west and was hands down MVP in 2007 even if they choked against GS in the first round that year.</p>

<p>And yes he had talent, but I love Laker fans hyping Kobe carrying Pau and Odom when for me Dirk carried and probably made guys like Josh Howard, the Jet, and Devin Harris better. Now Terry and  Harris were  solid players, Harris an all star at one point, but he never live duo to it. Josh Howard was a great player for Mavs but fell off for some reason. Maybe injures but I’m just saying for me Dirk did something I think Kobe did and people act like Kobe was million times better than him. Let’s not forget in 2011 with argaubly an older team with older role players, he swept the Lakers fresh off a title win in 2010 and beat Lebron in 2011 to wins ring.</p>

<p>And Kobe is better than Dirk for anyone who will be sensitive, but I’m just saying people acting like Kobe was only one even during his time doing great things. I just feel alone fans think he was the only great clutch player and was head above everyone else. I just never saw this mystical feel with Kobe like I feel I have seen with some MJ videos.</p>

<p>And this is relates to Lebrkn as a fan of his. I will always defend Lebrkn and think he is personally top3 all times but why I agree he isn’t the GOAT is he showed more imperfections like Kobe and pretty much of the legends outside MJ. I feel it’s hard for fans to realize the difference between a player even with MJ is close so you can’t really 100% know the outcomes.</p>

<p>I just feel if Kobe fans and to be fair even Lebron fans didn’t glorify these players as unstoppable and admitted and accepted flaws as they note achievements everything would be better.l with discourse.</p>

<p>Lastly, I feel for Kobe fans as well because I get Lebron fans being annoying haye and can’t take criticism arguably worse cosndkering what Kobe fans have faced for a while;l, but I feel Kobe fans for years have brought this idolizing Kobe with this cringe Taylor swift attitude.</p>

<p>We see it today in the Lin thread, how many of these guys were assuming people were incels or like participants trophies for criticizing Kobe’s methods.</p>

      <label for="ljc0jmi" class="commentText"><p>Dirk had Jason Kidd and Shawn Marion, which you conveniently left out, along with Tyson Chandler (DPOY) and Jason Terry (6MOTY). Kobe during the 2008-2010 season lost a starter in each of those runs and was fielding Vladimir Radmanovic, Sasha Vujacic, Jordan Farmar, Derrick Fisher, Shannon Brown and Luke Walton as his support (outside of Gasol/Odom). Let me not forget Odom was literally on CRACK.</p>

      <label for="ljc7u5f" class="commentText"><p>Oh wow Bynum, Ariza, Artest all sucked and finishing fisher who was on like 5-6 championship teams with Kobe.</p>

<p>And yeah I admittedly forgot about the 2011 Mavs players but I didn’t say they were one crap team Dirk Carried but I’m just saying he did a similar thing Kobe did carrying a well balanced rooster of role players.</p>

<p>And it comes to the point Kobe fans talking shit about every player he played  with and that Kobe did everything and carried everyone even compared to Jordan and the bulls.</p>

<p>There’s no point because all Kobe fans want is world of basketball to revolve around Kobe and think that’s only way of basketball is only  him as this unstoppable god and disrespecting other greats like they aren’t close to Kobe.</p>

      <label for="ljc8bi1" class="commentText"><p>Bynum did suck in those runs, he was hurt all the time. Ariza was a bit player, Artest old. Fisher got beat constantly by opposing PGs and hitting a few game winners doesn’t make him amazing. Dirk had one single run with Jason Kidd, Shawn Marion, a DPOY and a 6MOY vs 3 straight runs by Kobe. At no point did I disrespect any greats but Kobe’s supporting cast outside of Pau (who had bad series against the Suns and Spurs btw) was not good.</p>

      <label for="ljd9oqx" class="commentText"><p>Please take a look at the 2006-2007 Lakers roster. Kobe never had a shot at MVP that season. If you weren’t a top 2 seed back then you weren’t gonna get it and that roster never had a chance for that. The fact that Kobe was even 3rd in MVP voting on a 42 win team back then tells you everything you need to know</p>

      <label for="ljevf3x" class="commentText"><p>Part of being a great NBA legend is wanting others to enjoy play with you. The Lakers couldn&rsquo;t get anyone to play with Kobe from 2005 to 2008&hellip;.why do you think their rosters sucked so bad? Do you really think Smush Parker started for the Lakers because their GM became stupid? They had no one else.</p>

<p>Once Kobe chilled out a bit Gasol came over, so did Odom and Metta. And Phil came back too. All of a sudden 3 NBA Finals and 2 titles.</p>
