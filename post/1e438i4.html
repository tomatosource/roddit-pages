      <p>USA Booker continues to look like an amazing “role player” for the USA team. Great scoring without playing much on-ball, good connective passing, and great defense and hustle.</p>

<p>Bam, Hali, and Book all had a +9 +/- coming off the bench for USA. They played with a much faster pace than the starting lineup and it worked great. Curious to see what lineups and rotations the team settles on, but the faster pace of the young guys has looked like the best version of this team so far.</p>

      <label for="ldchper" class="commentText"><p>Most stars can play like a complimentary player on a stacked team if they decide to buy in. It’s always more so a question of willingness instead of ability.</p>

<p>Edit: I don’t even know how this is debatable. We’ve seen Harden, CP3, Carmelo, etc all buy in and be able to play a different brand of basketball. This notion that star players are immutable and unable to adjust their games when surrounded by all-star talent is insane.</p>

He could be decent at some of those but we never see it. Overall he’s probably the best on the ball offensive player in the league right now but decidedly below average off ball. He doesn’t really do much.</p>

      <label for="ldd9g0a" class="commentText"><p>Sure but I’m saying that he’s pretty much never developed his skill as an off ball player at all in his career and even pre-NBA so thinking he would immediately be elite at it is kind of ridiculous. It’s just not part of his skill set at this point. He’s still Luka but in his career he always shoots worse catch and shoot compared to off the dribble and he’ll never be a great defender. He’s one of the true heliocentric players where the offense is entirely based on him, but also when he doesn’t have the ball he does nothing. If he took time to develop it more it would be damn good but I don’t think he’s a seamless fit into the team. He’s just not elite at the traits of an offball roleplayer mold. He also plays pretty slowly which may disrupt other people’s rhythm though he likes passing fast on breaks.</p>

      <label for="lddc9sv" class="commentText"><p>Yes he hasn’t worked on it but it’s not particularly hard to become a better off-ball player. You’re judging him based on what you see vs. his potential, of course on a team where he’s the #1 option he’s going to rest when he’s off-ball. I saw the same takes when Harden joined us with Embiid and Harden was fine when he played off-ball and because players who are great shooters + have high Iq will be able to adjust.</p>

<p>These type of conversations remind me of the people who are convinced Curry can’t play on ball. Just because a star player has a specific role to fulfill on their current team doesn’t mean they can’t play other styles of basketball if need be.</p>

The lack of off ball movement and the lack of defense is really alarming for a guy like him. If he had to be a role player then he is definitely one of the worst stars to put in that spot.</p>

You seriously think if Luka was put in a system where all he has to do is catch and shoot and given 2 months to work on it he wouldn’t be a good C&amp;S player?

      <label for="ldekahj" class="commentText"><p>Idk I watched 2 seasons of the Suns trying to move CP3 off-ball and it was like he was allergic to C&amp;S. I think some players can adapt well and quickly, but it&rsquo;s not at all a given. </p>

<p>And the better they are at their primary role, the larger dropoff you&rsquo;ll see when they try to adapt to a role they&rsquo;re less familiar with. Luka is a masterful on-ball player. Thinking he can be even nearly as good off-ball (in a short period of time) seems like it&rsquo;s selling short the work and experience that went into him being so good on-ball. And if he&rsquo;s not exceptional off-ball, you actually might prefer a role player there who can play better defense.</p>

<p>I’m far from a Booker stan and I don’t think he’s a great defender but he’s arguably the most versatile star in the nba (between him and Tatum for me right now though Embiid can also be argued).</p>

<p>And one of the best things about him is his ability to play on or off ball</p>

      <label for="lddvd6n" class="commentText"><p>What&rsquo;s I&rsquo;d give for hali and him to be on a team together.</p>

<p>I cannot think of a pg who fit better with booker offensively (the defence would need work and great wings to make up for it but shit it&rsquo;s be entertaining)</p>

<p>Like bookers at his best off ball in a faster pace style and hali is all about playmaking in a very run and gun style.</p>

<p>Bookers also good at kick and drives amd hali is a good catch and shoot player.</p>

      <label for="ldd4cj2" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s literally all on-ball action. Ant plays like a first option, the team revolves around him. That&rsquo;s fine, he&rsquo;s good enough to have that role. But he&rsquo;s not going to be the 1st option when LeBron, Steph, and especially KD are on the floor and so far, he has not shown to be able to play a complementary role. Which is no knock against him, he&rsquo;s very young and not many superstars are able to shift gears and change their game completely into becoming a role player.</p>

<p>Which is why Booker started on the 2020 team and Tatum was off the bench. It&rsquo;s not that Booker was better than Tatum, he was the role player playing off KD and Dame while Tatum led the 2nd unit and has the counting stats to match. Ant is likely to be in that same role off the bench. It&rsquo;s not an insult to the player, it&rsquo;s the best position for the team to win.</p>

      <label for="ldc60qd" class="commentText"><p>Off the top of my head he also had a meaningless jumper at the end, so 6 points now we’re getting pretty close….</p>

<p>But he wanted nothing to do when passed the ball while USA was giving up their 20 point lead</p>
