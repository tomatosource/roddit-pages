      <label for="lc33jae" class="commentText"><p>I think you&rsquo;re missing the point where he has a legitimate better opportunity to win More rings with Dallas than with Golden State. Despite his streaky shooting he did average 39% from three last year. Lakers fans were begging for this dude. GSW wasn&rsquo;t set up this year for him to just catch and shoot threes like he did earlier in his career. Prime Golden State years, he scored 60 points on 11 dribbles. Find me a game from 2023 GSW where Klay has an opportunity to score big on 11 dribbles. You&rsquo;re also forgetting that they extended Wiggins and Jordan Poole, before they extended Thompson. I will say, GSW front office did play hardball with Steph, but he ultimately ended up staying. Weird to me that Klay didn&rsquo;t see this coming from GSW front office, but maybe he did, it wouldn&rsquo;t really change how he feels. The warriors told him he would be coming off the bench too, And I&rsquo;m sure that didn&rsquo;t sit well with him.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d feel fucking ashamed because I&rsquo;m self-aware for the most part.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re conveniently forgetting the part where the employee (Klay) was getting paid a fuck ton on vacation, while the guy who brings the coffee, &ldquo;his rook&rdquo;, by the way, actually helped the company get a big break and actually showed potential.</p>

      <label for="lc2gh30" class="commentText"><p>Klay left because he didn&rsquo;t want to be apart of the Warriors organization any longer. It&rsquo;s not just about the cash. I think the discussions surrounding Klay&rsquo;s exit have been a bit too focused on $$$ and it does matter but to me it matters more from events that occurred prior to whatever final negotiations occurred in-season/offseason. Inlcuding the Poole/Wiggins extension.</p>

<p>He wanted to leave. Any discussions held in the offseason which by all accounts were pretty minimal seems like a mere formality. Bridges were burned at that point. Yeah, the Warriors could&rsquo;ve given him an exorbitant deal and maybe he takes that but all things equal, he was and is done with the Warriors.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not the way this relationship should&rsquo;ve ended, and it&rsquo;s sad, but think it&rsquo;s best for both parties.</p>

<p>And he wanted to get paid handsomely after last 5 years.</p>

<p>Dude was delusional about his value.</p>

<p>Warriors wanted him to take a discount. But he was butt hurt for wiggins getting paid. Wiggins was 2nd beat player in 2022 championship run.</p>

      <label for="lc395tt" class="commentText"><p>Objectively speaking, did the Warriors want him to take a discount given what the other market offers turned out to be? I think its closer to not wanting him to ask for a premium. I love Klay and what he has done so far but he overvalued himself and just could not be happy seeing others succeed when his status was stagnant.</p>

      <label for="lc2928n" class="commentText"><p>For Klay I think the biggest issue he had contractually was the years. Him getting that third year makes his offer on the surface level look like the warriors value him like how he feels. Draymond got 4 years, Poole Wiggins. Think as long as the money itself was a certain baseline per year he wasnât too concerned with that. Getting a two year deal from the warriors standpoint makes all the sense in the world if this was 2k. But with Klay ego I see why heâs like nah fuck that</p>

      <label for="lc2vork" class="commentText"><p>Itâs crazy that heâs been back for 2.5 seasons &amp; has been looking worse since returning. I think he gets a pass for the first 1.5 because he was still finding his groove &amp; even led the NBA in 3 pointers made in 2023. This past season he absolutely made the team WORSE when he was on the floor &amp; hunting for shots. Iâm a warriors fan &amp; and Klay Fan but I donât feel the slightest bit sad in this situation because all I can think about is the 3-19 game vs the lakers &amp; the 0-10 game vs the kings. If he canât contribute in important games then heâs absolutely useless on the team. And wanted superstar money? Sheeesh Good luck playing in Dallas Klay!</p>
