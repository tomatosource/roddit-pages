We&rsquo;ve seen it a thousand times where celebrities are super popular and within 2-3 years it turns right around to becoming popular to hate them. He&rsquo;s so confident, is genuinely funny and charming, he needs to not let it get to his head and get to comfortable saying dumb shit.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s peaking right now in terms of popularity, has very few haters. Saying things like only MJ would be skilled enough to play in today&rsquo;s NBA from his generation is exactly how you turn that popularity into hate instead after an early playoff exit or 2.</p>

<p>Because he is even bigger. The man almost averages a 34 point triple double, he&rsquo;s in his own category.</p>

<p>Besides, Luka does not talk much shit. You need to separate what he does on the court with how he is portrayed in the media. Luka seems to me wants to be left alone for the most part outside the court, he&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t talk nearly as much as Ant.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t see Luka doing podcasts and cons etc. Ant likes the attention, Luka doesn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s just something that can backfire on Ant and he needs to be careful.</p>

      <label for="lk9rbhy" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m looking at it from a media and fans perspective. We&rsquo;re talking public perception here.
The shittalk Luka does on the court in terms of trash talking doesn&rsquo;t really have any bearing on how the fans see him.</p>

<p>Ant has some baggage he&rsquo;s gotten away with, his homophobic comments and the whole &ldquo;send da video&rdquo; conversation is not a great look along with his recent comments about everyone but Jordan not having skills for today&rsquo;s game. Those things can be brought up again in the future if the public perception does turn against him.</p>

<p>He is very fun, he&rsquo;s charming and great for the media to play with right now, but he just needs to be careful to not get too comfortable.</p>

<p>Luka doesn&rsquo;t really engage at all like Ant does. He complains a lot to the refs, but that&rsquo;s not something the media is going to care about. They can&rsquo;t really pile on him for that or spin it. It doesn&rsquo;t make for a good headline when you want to trash someone and create controversy.</p>

<li><p>even if we limit to 2 seasons, being selected for All-Star and 1st Team All-NBA twice is very obviously a different level of achievement than two All-Stars and one 2nd Team. and Luka has now done that 5 seasons in a row. the fact of the matter is individually Luka was way ahead of where Ant was at the same age</p></li>

<li><p>no, the WCF run wouldn’t dispel anything bc the WCF run itself is the source of the hype behind Ant right now.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>the NBA star treatment is simple - build them up to tear them down. they built him up during the playoffs, and now Ant happens to be speedrunning the “get torn down” process bc the media overrated him like crazy by calling him the new MJ, and Ant really doesn’t think hard enough about what he says or does off the court</p>

      <label for="lk96tx8" class="commentText"><p>bro no one is saying it isn’t an accomplishment to get the WCF, you’re just making things up.</p>

<p>the thing people are arguing is that the hype that Ant has gotten for that accomplishment doesn’t match up with his actual on-court performance right now. you have people genuinely calling Ant a top 5 player or the best in the world, and he’s clearly nowhere near that right now</p>

<p>and honestly he brought some of this backlash to the hype upon himself with his dumb comments about players in MJ’s era not having skill. super easy way to get the media to turn against you especially when so many prominent media members are literally players who played in that fucking era</p>

<p>He played well, but it didn&rsquo;t quite turn out like that.</p>

<p>Yet Luka got snubbed for the MVP, but dragged Dallas to the finals. Giannis got a bum ass Greek team to the Olympics and Jokic managed to get Serbia a medal.</p>

<p>The people who starred for the US in the Olympics were the three old heads with a Booker cameo. The young player who showed out during the tourney was Wembey.</p>

<p>So really the NBA status quo didn&rsquo;t change. The OGs are still LeBron, Steph and Durant. The next wave of stars is Jokic, Giannis and Luka. The next big thing looks like Wemby.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s primed for a monster season, but the media clowns always do this. Pump someone up, if they don&rsquo;t deliver tear them down, if they do but the narrative isn&rsquo;t convenient, try to discredit them.</p>

<p>Players can either shrug it off, or embrace the bullshit, play the PR game and excel enough that they get pet talking head dickriders in the press and lifetime haters.</p>

There are literally millions of viewers who only watch the conference finals and finals and maybe the semi’s. Marketing those stars especially someone so easily marketable as Ant is important. And when hes winning multiple series as the best player yeah hes gonna get the spotlight. Its stupid to talk about them winning games against Denver and remind people Giannis is better than him. </p>

<p>Saw him throwing shade on the suns for getting knocked out in game 7. He said it was a disgrace.🗣️</p>

<p>Fast forward to timberwolves losing in game 5 and of course YouTube petty ass algorithm popped that shit into a Great Number of feeds.  Because it aged like milk🙄</p>

<p>Then he says only MJ had skill back in the day and what in the absolute fuck. Done went and pissed Magic off.</p>

<p>He’s organic no gmo but also no filter and yes he will drop the N bomb when and wherever he deems it appropriate.</p>

<p>I’m probably a Luka Stan more than anybody but if I had to pick a next face of the league it would be True Glue Jrue Holiday. And Celtics beat the mavericks ass but how can u not love the baby faced assassin. And yes I know he old asf but he is the embodiment of what a team sport looks like.</p>

<p>Easy answer is Wemby&rsquo;s already better if: He plays like he did the 2nd half of last season, all of next season (And continues to improve too? it&rsquo;s over.)</p>

<p>Obvious bias aside, I see Wemby as the superior talent, but Edwards is as good a prospect as we&rsquo;ve seen in at least a decade</p>

<p>Ant is fringe top 10. He’s in a similar tier as a guys like Booker, KD, AD, Brunson, etc.</p>

<p>Now, next year, there’s a decent chance he solidifies himself in the top 10 (both due to improvement and other top players’ declines). He could possibly even close in on top 5 (if Embiid starts to fall off). Top 1 is ludicrous barring INSANE improvement.</p>

<p>He was the only capable playmaker on that team and they beat a pretty good Sixers team. It was a wild carry job by him offensively. Hard to see 15 players better than that</p>

<p>I think you are overreacting to one year (and this year wasn’t anything out of this world) sorry you gonna have to do this for more than one year to be top 15. Even ANT made back to back all star teams.</p>

<p>Kyrie OFF court -2, ON +6</p>

<p>Ant OFF court +4, ON +7.5</p>

<p>Kyrie played a whole lot of minutes without Luka, Ant plays with KAT, Gobert, Conley, Reid and Mcdaniels, outside of Luka and Kyrie, these would almost certainly replace most of the dallas starting lineup</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Because of the Wolves record + games played, and he is obviously more popular with the media, all nba is a media award btw, besides Kyrie missed too many games to qualify.</p>

<p>what shows a lack of basketball knowledge is using all nba as a pure justification, is Tatum better than Embiid because Embiid didnt qualify this year?</p>

<p>Ant averaged 25.<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>.1 on 57.5% TS, to put it into perspective Ant played 21 more games than Kyrie and only had 0.6 more winshares lol.</p>

<p>Kyrie would have made 2nd team easily if he met the games played quota.</p>

<p>Insane how overrated Ant has become, when Gobert leaves we will actually see the drop off from that team</p>

      <label for="lk9jjmd" class="commentText"><p>In no particular order, these players were (imo) definitely better than ant last season:
Jokic, Luka, Giannis, SGA, Tatum, Embiid, Book, AD, Lebron, Brunson, KD, Steph
And these were arguable:
Mitchell, Brown, Kawhi, Wemby (im big on him lol)</p>

<p>If I were to predict for next season, these players would remain or begin to be definitely better:
Jokic, Luka, Giannis, SGA, Tatum, Embiid, Book, Wemby (8 players)
And these will be arguable:
Brown, Brunson, AD, Lebron, Steph, KD, Kawhi (7 players)</p>

<p>So in my opinion Ant will be somewhere between the 9-15 range next season, and I&rsquo;d probably have him closer to 15 than 9, but it depends how much he improves. I love ant but it&rsquo;s still a little early for him to be top 5, he&rsquo;ll def be there when he&rsquo;s in his prime tho (barring major injury)</p>

He does “enough” defense and puts up a lot of points even when the dude’s leg can’t go a game without a blood spot showing up. People always say he’s fat but the dude hustles even when injured and puts in the minutes and puts up the buckets. If you want him to expend more energy on defense, you won’t get the highest avg ppg player in the league.</p>

<p>Ant is an amazing player and growing his game quickly. Dude will be a top player in his career. But the media pushed him way too quickly. And oddly at that as he’s had some pretty interesting off court issues.</p>

      <label for="lk9b5zr" class="commentText"><p>Book is definitely better at playing with other stars and playing off ball. But if you are starting a team from scratch and you have to choose Ant or Book to be your star this season, I think it is quite close tbh. Ant&rsquo;s rim pressure and defense is in another league while Books shooting and playmaking is another league. I think if Ant played with a roster that had good spacing (so not the wolves), his ability to get to the rim would make his scoring pretty resilient to fluctuation, while book might be more volatile since he relies on jump shooting. And I&rsquo;m biased, so I&rsquo;m taking Ant lol.</p>

Just cuz bookers jumper is sweeter and he&rsquo;s suns&rsquo; prized lightskin brat doesn&rsquo;t make him the best SG in the game.

Ppl here are so starved of drama they need a guy to hate on every year, Edward&rsquo;s is an all NBA franchise player at 23 with arguably already being Minny&rsquo;s best post season performer already, pretending he isn&rsquo;t at least top 10 like some comments here (putting booker over him, the guy he literally outplayed and sweeped like 3 months ago) is just some scatterbrained BS. They pulled this Ants the most overrated young player in the league last year as well and he only upped him game. Y&rsquo;all feed into the same media cycle you claim to hate</p>

      <label for="lk8to61" class="commentText"><p>Kawhi (when healthy) is cheating. Kawhi hasn’t been healthy in years.</p>

<p>Mitchell and LeBron are debatable. Mitchell’s a better perimeter scorer, but Ant’s size and defense makes it at least debatable. LeBron is great, but he needs to coast a lot these days. He doesn’t have the legs to bring it every night for 35+ minutes. Ant’s ability to be a workhorse makes it pretty arguable he’s ahead of LeBron. Steph is a hybrid of Mitchell (defense) and LeBron (age).</p>

<p>I’d personally say the following are definitely better:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jokic</li>
<li>Luka</li>
<li>Giannis</li>
<li>SGA</li>
<li>Embiid (assuming he’s mostly healthy)</li>
<li>Tatum</li>
</ul>

<p>The next group is more arguable</p>

<ul>
<li>Curry</li>
<li>LeBron</li>
<li>AD</li>
<li>KD</li>
<li>Booker</li>
<li>Brunson</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d consider this group Ant is likely better but there’s some discussion</p>

<ul>
<li>Kawhi</li>
<li>Mitchell</li>
<li>Brown</li>
<li>Wemby</li>
</ul>

      <label for="lk9i2yb" class="commentText"><p>I agree with everything u said but u can&rsquo;t start off your comment with &ldquo;Kawhi (when healthy) is cheating&rdquo; and then include &ldquo;Embiid (assuming he&rsquo;s mostly healthy)&rdquo; in ur list. If you told me rn that i get to pick between embiid and ant for a whole season (regular and playoffs) I&rsquo;m taking Ant SOLELY for health reasons. I might be biased but I think embiid is entering Kawhi territory with his health and that should knock him down on these lists. Kawhi has had two seasons in his career of 70+ games, Embiid has never done that. It&rsquo;s common knowledge now that Embiid has never EVER had a healthy playoff run and it&rsquo;s resulted in second round exit after second round exit. As of rn the sixers look more and more like the clippers where they had this crazy high ceiling and their star(s) health held them back. I do agree that when he&rsquo;s healthy he is absolutely probably top 2 in the league, but the best ability is availability at the end of the day. Out of the &ldquo;definitely better&rdquo; tier you had, 3 people won a championship, 1 led his team to the finals, and 2 have never been past the second round. SGA hasn&rsquo;t been past the second round because he is a young, budding star who only just now had his first elite year with an even younger supporting cast and is primed to be a playoff contender for the foreseeable future, while Embiid is entering the tail end of his prime and his health continues to become more and more of an issue.</p>

      <label for="lk9ia99" class="commentText"><p>Kawhi last 3 seasons was injured and had worse stats than Tatum pretty much across the board and his team has won a lot less. Tatum has also been 1st team All-NBA the past 3 years.</p>

<p>In the playoffs it’s not even close, Tatum has been to 3 straight ECF, 2 finals, has an ECF MVP (2022) and a ring (2024), Kawhi has been injured the past 3 years.</p>

<p>The case for Kawhi over Tatum is if you’re living in the past</p>
