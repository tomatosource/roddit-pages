</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Looking back at basketball reference, Ewing made one All-NBA fist team and six second teams. So obviously, he was great but who would be his modern comp?</p>

<p>What was the perception of Ewing during his peak? I know he was up against Hakeem &amp; Robinson for All-NBA teams. What else is notable?</p>

<p>Oddly enough he didn&rsquo;t made an all defensive team the year he averaged 4 (!) blocks per game, in 89-90.</p>

      <label for="lmlpdn3" class="commentText"><p>I think he would actually play kind of similarly to Embiid but maybe a lesser version - solid mid range jump shooter with some post moves and a great shot blocker/defender. Not as good of a playmaker as Embiid. AD isn&rsquo;t a bad comparison either but I feel like AD was more mobile and had more PF qualities than Ewing.  I think Ewing would be a bit below Jokic/Embiid currently but he would be a step above the Sabonis/Bam tier for sure. Closer to the former than latter.</p>

      <label for="lmlrcte" class="commentText"><p>He would be today clinching the 3rd best Center spot. Honestly only really elite Cs today are Jokic and Embiid. The rest are just very good. Center position has the weakest high end depth of positions. Ewing would be by a considerable margin below those two, but also by a considerable margin above guys like Bam or Sabonis. He would be 3rd in an island.</p>

Ewing was a good shooter but never considered shooting threes. He was incredibly athletic but would only have handled the ball in the post most of the time. If someone with Ewing&rsquo;s ability were coming up today, he&rsquo;d be better than Embiid on offense and defense and would have great ball handling skills as well.</p>

Rick Smits on Indiana always gave Ewing problems, but they don&rsquo;t get past Miami and Mourning without Ewing.  Patrick went down in the Indiana series and Camby stepped in and was a better match up.</p>

<p>Then, in the Finals, the Knicks had no chance without Ewing.  With Ewing and Camby possibly being on the floor together they may have been a match for San Antonio.</p>

And he wasn&rsquo;t in an era where people would pretend he&rsquo;s a power forward to get him more votes.</p>

<p>I would argue the comp is less individually talented James Harden. The eternal bridesmaid that got <em>this</em> close but had to spend his whole prime losing to the dynasty. Obviously Harden&rsquo;s indicidual hardware clears Ewing, but nobody got screwed by Jordan more than Ewing and nobody got screwed by the Warriors more than Harden. Ewing never got help nearly as talented as Harden got at their peak though.</p>

<p>This is trivial to the point of not being worth saying. If it wasn&rsquo;t for illegal defense rules no one would have ever followed him out to the arc. He averaged like 1 make per season in his career.</p>

      <label for="lmlqd0i" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think there was much overlap in shaq and ewings prime. (Ewing drafted in 84?, shaq 92?) But Ewing was def third fiddle to Robinson and Hakeem.</p>

<p>Ewing still a beast and likely a top 7ish center of all time, and top 30ish player. Just played in the golden age of centers.</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t their teams make the finals in consecutive years?  I feel like that&rsquo;s where there&rsquo;s overlap</p>

      <label for="lmlox0c" class="commentText"><p>Ewing was the sweatiest man I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>

<p>He was good enough that, when healthy, beating the knicks in a series meant something. but he was always that ever so sliver of not good enough to be a dominant player.</p>

<p>maybe AD as another poster mentioned isn&rsquo;t a bad comp.</p>

      <label for="lmlviea" class="commentText"><p>Ewing was a two-way center with dominant defense, leading teams that won or lost on rebounding. To me growing up he was a legend - he was such a hometown hero, I don&rsquo;t recall really separating him from his team and comparing him to other centers - the other best centers were in the West anyway. That said, when I think about what impressed me at the time about Hakeem or David Robinson that Ewing didn&rsquo;t do - he wasn&rsquo;t as athletic or as quick and effective in the post as Hakeem or David Robinson, he was less of a help defender and relied more on defense in the paint, but he was a much better shooter and in any given season it was a coin toss who would be the best on defense overall - though of course in the long run I don&rsquo;t think Ewing comes out on top of that.</p>

<p>And over time the effect of his shooting was held back by three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>He shot long midrange jumpers rather than 3-pointers, because it was the 80s and 90s and nobody knew better.</li>
<li>He&rsquo;s the prototype for Dirk Nowitsky, but he&rsquo;s not Dirk Nowitsky. He wasn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> good at shooting midrange baseline jumpers.</li>
<li>He was his team&rsquo;s primary offensive option forever, and he would have benefited a ton from more spacing so he could get better looks or at least some other threat to draw away the defense that never materialized.</li>
</ol>

<p>It sucks that the one play that was on the line for him was a failed dunk - he was never really about dunking over four people, his signature was that smooth 7-footer pull-up jumper. <em>Then</em> he would get the rebound over four other people on the other end.</p>

<p>Embiid stands out as a comp because he has that combination of dominating defense, shooting, strength, and lack of foot speed. And Embiid is also assumed to be an eternal primary option on a team where that setup appears to just not quite work.</p>

<p>Ewing is like if Embiid were 20% less gifted (and incredibly hard-nosed and stoic instead of very publicly emotional) or Al Horford were 50% better.</p>

<p>Ewing is good for sure, but he never even finished top 3 in MVP voting once.  Giannis has won 2 and finishes top 3 basically every year.  Ewing has also never made an all defensive first team, Giannis has won a DPOY.  Giannis is in the middle of his prime and he already has more all-NBA selections and will, barring injury, earn many more.  Your severely underselling Giannis here.  Giannis was the best player on the planet for a stretch, Ewing was never considered top 5.</p>
