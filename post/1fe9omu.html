</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Looking back at basketball reference, Ewing made one All-NBA fist team and six second teams. So obviously, he was great but who would be his modern comp?</p>

<p>What was the perception of Ewing during his peak? I know he was up against Hakeem &amp; Robinson for All-NBA teams. What else is notable?</p>

<p>Oddly enough he didn&rsquo;t made an all defensive team the year he averaged 4 (!) blocks per game, in 89-90.</p>

      <label for="lmlpdn3" class="commentText"><p>I think he would actually play kind of similarly to Embiid but maybe a lesser version - solid mid range jump shooter with some post moves and a great shot blocker/defender. Not as good of a playmaker as Embiid. AD isn&rsquo;t a bad comparison either but I feel like AD was more mobile and had more PF qualities than Ewing.  I think Ewing would be a bit below Jokic/Embiid currently but he would be a step above the Sabonis/Bam tier for sure. Closer to the former than latter.</p>

Ewing was a good shooter but never considered shooting threes. He was incredibly athletic but would only have handled the ball in the post most of the time. If someone with Ewing&rsquo;s ability were coming up today, he&rsquo;d be better than Embiid on offense and defense and would have great ball handling skills as well.</p>

      <label for="lmlrcte" class="commentText"><p>He would be today clinching the 3rd best Center spot. Honestly only really elite Cs today are Jokic and Embiid. The rest are just very good. Center position has the weakest high end depth of positions. Ewing would be by a considerable margin below those two, but also by a considerable margin above guys like Bam or Sabonis. He would be 3rd in an island.</p>

And he wasn&rsquo;t in an era where people would pretend he&rsquo;s a power forward to get him more votes.</p>

<p>I would argue the comp is less individually talented James Harden. The eternal bridesmaid that got <em>this</em> close but had to spend his whole prime losing to the dynasty. Obviously Harden&rsquo;s indicidual hardware clears Ewing, but nobody got screwed by Jordan more than Ewing and nobody got screwed by the Warriors more than Harden. Ewing never got help nearly as talented as Harden got at their peak though.</p>

      <label for="lmlu1ga" class="commentText"><p>The second Finals trip is an interesting case.  Rick Smits on Indiana always gave Ewing problems, but they don&rsquo;t get past Miami and Mourning without Ewing.  Patrick went down in the Indiana series and Camby stepped in and was a better match up.</p>

<p>Then, in the Finals, the Knicks had no chance without Ewing.  With Ewing and Camby possibly being on the floor together they may have been a match for San Antonio.</p>

AD is a superior defender and they are probably even at offense. Patrick Chewing is remembered by non-Knicks fans for not delivering in the clutch. Missed a fucking layin at the buzzer</p>

<p>This is already a bad argument on its own. But you do realize the season AD won a title was also shortened, right?</p>

<p>This is genuinely the worst context to be arguing about a strike shortened season lol.</p>

<p>Good enough to be a team leader, even lead a team to the Finals, but probably needs an extra star player next to him to win it all.</p>

      <label for="lmlviea" class="commentText"><p>Ewing was a two-way center with dominant defense, leading teams that won or lost on rebounding. To me growing up he was a legend - he was such a hometown hero, I don&rsquo;t recall really separating him from his team and comparing him to other centers - the other best centers were in the West anyway. That said, when I think about what impressed me at the time about Hakeem or David Robinson that Ewing didn&rsquo;t do - he wasn&rsquo;t as athletic or as quick and effective in the post as Hakeem or David Robinson, he was less of a help defender and relied more on defense in the paint, but he was a much better shooter and in any given season it was a coin toss who would be the best on defense overall - though of course in the long run I don&rsquo;t think Ewing comes out on top of that.</p>

<p>And over time the effect of his shooting was held back by three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>He shot long midrange jumpers rather than 3-pointers, because it was the 80s and 90s and nobody knew better.</li>
<li>He&rsquo;s the prototype for Dirk Nowitsky, but he&rsquo;s not Dirk Nowitsky. He wasn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> good at shooting midrange baseline jumpers.</li>
<li>He was his team&rsquo;s primary offensive option forever, and he would have benefited a ton from more spacing so he could get better looks or at least some other threat to draw away the defense that never materialized.</li>
</ol>

<p>It sucks that the one play that was on the line for him was a failed dunk - he was never really about dunking over four people, his signature was that smooth 7-footer pull-up jumper. <em>Then</em> he would get the rebound over four other people on the other end.</p>

<p>Embiid stands out as a comp because he has that combination of dominating defense, shooting, strength, and lack of foot speed. And Embiid is also assumed to be an eternal primary option on a team where that setup appears to just not quite work.</p>

<p>Ewing is like if Embiid were 20% less gifted (and incredibly hard-nosed and stoic instead of very publicly emotional) or Al Horford were 50% better.</p>

<p>This is trivial to the point of not being worth saying. If it wasn&rsquo;t for illegal defense rules no one would have ever followed him out to the arc. He averaged like 1 make per season in his career.</p>

<p>The mid-range game was the real threat.</p>

      <label for="lmm72gi" class="commentText"><p>Man, I’m glad someone finally brought this up. Ewing’s sweat was on another level. Like, we’re talking <strong>legendary</strong> perspiration here. I remember watching a game back in the mid-90s when I noticed he looked like he stepped out of the pool before the national anthem was even done. He wasn’t just sweaty <em>during</em> the game—Ewing was pre-sweating in the locker room, like he had an advanced warm-up regime based purely around hydration loss. I imagine his jersey had to be industrial-grade moisture-wicking fabric, but by the end of the first quarter, it looked like he came out of the Hudson.</p>

<p>It wasn’t just during intense games either—he’d be in warmups, casually jogging back and forth, and this guy looked like Ted Cruz getting interrogated for capital murder. And don’t get me started on the free throws. Oh boy, free throws were like a waterfall moment. The man would step to the line, and suddenly it was like the Hoover Dam burst open. You’d see the towel boys scrambling to wipe the floor after each one, like they were cleaning up after a broken water main. Sometimes I wondered if that was part of his defense strategy, making the ball slippery for the other team. I&rsquo;m pretty sure some centers couldn&rsquo;t even catch the ball properly because Ewing’s sweat was so pervasive.</p>

<p>I swear, one time, he went for a dunk, and a literal <em>mist</em> of sweat sprayed off him in slow motion, like he was some sort of moisture deity. The poor kid in the front row had to squint through it like he was caught in a rainstorm at Madison Square Garden. And the most bizarre part is how he never seemed to get dehydrated, like the guy had a secret camel-like ability to store water somewhere in his body.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t be surprised if they had to squeegee the locker room floor after he walked out of there. It wasn’t just a physical thing, it was a <em>presence</em>. Ewing didn’t need to assert dominance; his sweat did it for him. Maybe that’s why he was always just a little short of being the guy—he lost half his energy just cooling himself off. No one else was ever close to that level of pure athletic evaporation.</p>

Coming out of college he was an athletic, high-flying player.  Still, during the Knicks run, he was a very good center who had good post moves and a good jumper.</p>

<p>He was considered a step below Hakeem and Robinson and then Shaq when he came into the league.  However, he had reputation as being a mediocre playoff performer.  As a Knicks hater, I always enjoyed how his teams always came up short.</p>

      <label for="lmm2vre" class="commentText"><p>Pat Ewing played in the golden era of Big Men.</p>

<p>He came in a league with Kareem and Moses, following a rookie Hakeem, and then preceding a rookie David Robinson, before then seeing Shaq, Mourning, and Mutumbo drafted during his prime.</p>

<p>So it is easy to lose sight of how good Ewing was.</p>

<p>But he was fucking incredible. An amazing rebounder. And amazing defender. And incredible all around scorer. Great in the post. Solid mid range. Got a nice little hook.</p>

<p>If he hadn&rsquo;t been competing with Hakeem, Robinson, Mourning, and Mutumbo for DPOY and All Defensive teams, he&rsquo;d have been wowing people with his defence.</p>

<p>In the context of his era, his rebounding numbers may seem a little low, but he was also collecting boards on a deep rebounding team. Oakley. Mason. Charles Smith. etc. But he was a very strong rebounder.</p>

<p>His blocks are lower than his peers (DRon, Hakeem, Mutumbo), but he averaged 2.4 on his career, compared to Dwight&rsquo;s 1.8 (keeping in mind that Dwight won 3 DPOY awards) and compared to Gobert&rsquo;s 2.1 on his career (without that number being weighed down by lower late career stats like Ewing&rsquo;s is).</p>

<p>So he averaged more blocks than two guys who have combined for a total of 7 DPOY awards. Yes, there were more post shots and drives to block, so his number will naturally be higher for those reasons, but his average is also dragged down by his last three season.</p>

<p>You put him in this league, he&rsquo;s going to tear up the post likely better than Embidd does and defend well enough to be in the DPOY conversation every season. Ewing was also a decent passer, but plays were either run through the point or Mason, so he didn&rsquo;t get the assist numbers that other play-making C&rsquo;s got.</p>

<p>But dude was a beast. He simultaneously played in the right era and the wrong era.</p>

      <label for="lmm1uld" class="commentText"><p>Ewing was a defensive anchor that gave you 25ppg.  He was certainly a star player that any team would&rsquo;ve loved to have.  However there was Hakeem and Robinson who you&rsquo;d probably put above him.  He probably wins a championship if Jordan never existed which you can say about quite a few people.</p>

      <label for="lmlzt0a" class="commentText"><p>Probably the best modern day comparison in Kawhi without the 3, but it&rsquo;s not a good one.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s important to remember that there really is no &ldquo;modern-day equivalent&rdquo; to 99% of the guys from the 80s and 90s, because the game is so damn different than it is now. Hell, positions aren&rsquo;t even really the same any more- back then, they were rigidly defined; now, the best teams move fluidly.</p>

<p>Think about it this way: Rodman- the greatest rebounder in history- wouldn&rsquo;t have made today&rsquo;s NBA, because other than his defense, he lacked the skills early, and didn&rsquo;t make a massive jump in his game until 1990. Del Curry was a &ldquo;3 point specialist&rdquo; off the bench who played 21 minutes per game and never averaged more than 5.2 3PAs per game.</p>

<p>Unless you lived it and remember it, you don&rsquo;t understand just how massively different the game is now- other than the fact that it&rsquo;s still dribbling and putting a ball through a hoop, the game now is basically completely different than it was in the 80s and 90s.</p>

      <label for="lmlo1yi" class="commentText"><p>Ewing&rsquo;s best season would be Giannis&rsquo; down year.</p>

<p>Ewing is good for sure, but he never even finished top 3 in MVP voting once.  Giannis has won 2 and finishes top 3 basically every year.  Ewing has also never made an all defensive first team, Giannis has won a DPOY.  Giannis is in the middle of his prime and he already has more all-NBA selections and will, barring injury, earn many more.  Your severely underselling Giannis here.  Giannis was the best player on the planet for a stretch, Ewing was never considered top 5.</p>

Patrick had incredible power though. Comparing across generations is always difficult. Patrick honed his athleticism to the tasks asked of him (interior defense and post moves) </p>
