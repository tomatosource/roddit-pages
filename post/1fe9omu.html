</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Looking back at basketball reference, Ewing made one All-NBA fist team and six second teams. So obviously, he was great but who would be his modern comp?</p>

<p>What was the perception of Ewing during his peak? I know he was up against Hakeem &amp; Robinson for All-NBA teams. What else is notable?</p>

<p>Oddly enough he didn&rsquo;t made an all defensive team the year he averaged 4 (!) blocks per game, in 89-90.</p>

      <label for="lmlpdn3" class="commentText"><p>I think he would actually play kind of similarly to Embiid but maybe a lesser version - solid mid range jump shooter with some post moves and a great shot blocker/defender. Not as good of a playmaker as Embiid. AD isn&rsquo;t a bad comparison either but I feel like AD was more mobile and had more PF qualities than Ewing.  I think Ewing would be a bit below Jokic/Embiid currently but he would be a step above the Sabonis/Bam tier for sure. Closer to the former than latter.</p>

      <label for="lmlsyik" class="commentText"><p>You can&rsquo;t compare him to Embiid as Embiid is today because the game has changed so much. Ewing was a good shooter but never considered shooting threes. He was incredibly athletic but would only have handled the ball in the post most of the time. If someone with Ewing&rsquo;s ability were coming up today, he&rsquo;d be better than Embiid on offense and defense and would have great ball handling skills as well.</p>

      <label for="lmmaw8f" class="commentText"><p>Regarding playmaking, I think it is important to note that playmaking expectations of today are dramatically different compared to Ewing&rsquo;s era</p>

<p>For example, among the ten highest points/game from last season, Tatum had the fewest assists/game at 4.9</p>

<p>If you go back to the 1990 season (Ewing&rsquo;s highest scoring season), that would rank as the second highest assists/game among the top 10 scorers.</p>

<p>(Or if you flip it, MJ&rsquo;s 6.3 assists/game in 1990 would have ranked 6th in 2024 among the top scorers instead of leading it by 2 whole assists/game)</p>

Center position has the weakest high end depth of positions. Ewing would be by a considerable margin below those two, but also by a considerable margin above guys like Bam or Sabonis. He would be 3rd in an island.</p>

      <label for="lmmhhoq" class="commentText"><p>For context on stats here:</p>

<p>Ewing in 97-98 was 44% from 10-16 feet and 59% from 16-3P. He was 35 at the time, we don’t have stats for shooting from before 96-97.</p>

<p>Overall, though, prime Ewing had a wild 115 FG+, which is about where prime KD is. KD also has similar midrange splits during his OKC/GSW years.</p>

<p>Embiid last year was 47% from 10-16 feet and 52% from 16-3P. I think it’s fair to say that prime Ewing would have the same shooting touch as current Embiid.</p>

      <label for="lmmeppa" class="commentText"><p>Embiid is the more talented pure shooter and scorer, but I think Ewing had a lot more physical and mental toughness than Embiid. Think sort of like the mental difference between Kobe and DeRozan. Ewing had more of that sturdy, ferocious, dependable warrior demeanor about him. I don&rsquo;t get as much of a sense of that from Embiid, and it&rsquo;s important, especially for a big who&rsquo;s supposed to be dominating and protecting the paint and the boards. Ewing was the defensive anchor of the 90s Knicks whose run of success depended primarily on defense, and one of those teams (I think the 93 team) has one of the top defensive ratings in NBA history. That all starts and ends with Ewing&rsquo;s enormous defensive presence.</p>

<p>Also, after playing 50 and 63 games in his first two seasons, Ewing went on to have a 10 year run from his age 25 - 34 seasons in which he averaged playing 80 games per season, 37 minutes per game, before his health and availability took a nose dive starting in his age 35 season. (During this run, his per-game averages were 24 ppg, 10.6 rpg, 2.8 bpg, 2.2 apg, 1.0 spg.) That relates to his toughness, since mid-career he started having knee issues and lost a lot of mobility compared to his younger years, but he always played through it. I&rsquo;d take a fully healthy Embiid over Ewing since a fully healthy Embiid is a multi-MVP caliber player, but taking health and availability into consideration, I&rsquo;d easily take Ewing&rsquo;s prime over Embiid&rsquo;s.</p>

      <label for="lmlviea" class="commentText"><p>Ewing was a two-way center with dominant defense, leading teams that won or lost on rebounding. To me growing up he was a legend - he was such a hometown hero, I don&rsquo;t recall really separating him from his team and comparing him to other centers - the other best centers were in the West anyway. That said, when I think about what impressed me at the time about Hakeem or David Robinson that Ewing didn&rsquo;t do - he wasn&rsquo;t as athletic or as quick and effective in the post as Hakeem or David Robinson, he was less of a help defender and relied more on defense in the paint, but he was a much better shooter and in any given season it was a coin toss who would be the best on defense overall - though of course in the long run I don&rsquo;t think Ewing comes out on top of that.</p>

<p>And over time the effect of his shooting was held back by three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>He shot long midrange jumpers rather than 3-pointers, because it was the 80s and 90s and nobody knew better.</li>
<li>He&rsquo;s the prototype for Dirk Nowitsky, but he&rsquo;s not Dirk Nowitsky. He wasn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> good at shooting midrange baseline jumpers.</li>
<li>He was his team&rsquo;s primary offensive option forever, and he would have benefited a ton from more spacing so he could get better looks or at least some other threat to draw away the defense that never materialized.</li>
</ol>

<p>It sucks that the one play that was on the line for him was a failed dunk - he was never really about dunking over four people, his signature was that smooth 7-footer pull-up jumper. <em>Then</em> he would get the rebound over four other people on the other end.</p>

<p>Embiid stands out as a comp because he has that combination of dominating defense, shooting, strength, and lack of foot speed. And Embiid is also assumed to be an eternal primary option on a team where that setup appears to just not quite work.</p>

<p>Ewing is like if Embiid were 20% less gifted (and incredibly hard-nosed and stoic instead of very publicly emotional) or Al Horford were 50% better.</p>

And he wasn&rsquo;t in an era where people would pretend he&rsquo;s a power forward to get him more votes.</p>

<p>I would argue the comp is less individually talented James Harden. The eternal bridesmaid that got <em>this</em> close but had to spend his whole prime losing to the dynasty. Obviously Harden&rsquo;s indicidual hardware clears Ewing, but nobody got screwed by Jordan more than Ewing and nobody got screwed by the Warriors more than Harden. Ewing never got help nearly as talented as Harden got at their peak though.</p>

<p>This is trivial to the point of not being worth saying. If it wasn&rsquo;t for illegal defense rules no one would have ever followed him out to the arc. He averaged like 1 make per season in his career.</p>

<p>The mid-range game was the real threat.</p>

Rick Smits on Indiana always gave Ewing problems, but they don&rsquo;t get past Miami and Mourning without Ewing.  Patrick went down in the Indiana series and Camby stepped in and was a better match up.</p>

<p>Then, in the Finals, the Knicks had no chance without Ewing.  With Ewing and Camby possibly being on the floor together they may have been a match for San Antonio.</p>

<p>This is already a bad argument on its own. But you do realize the season AD won a title was also shortened, right?</p>

      <label for="lmm72gi" class="commentText"><p>Man, I’m glad someone finally brought this up. Ewing’s sweat was on another level. Like, we’re talking <strong>legendary</strong> perspiration here. I remember watching a game back in the mid-90s when I noticed he looked like he stepped out of the pool before the national anthem was even done. He wasn’t just sweaty <em>during</em> the game—Ewing was pre-sweating in the locker room, like he had an advanced warm-up regime based purely around hydration loss. I imagine his jersey had to be industrial-grade moisture-wicking fabric, but by the end of the first quarter, it looked like he came out of the Hudson.</p>

<p>It wasn’t just during intense games either—he’d be in warmups, casually jogging back and forth, and this guy looked like Ted Cruz getting interrogated for capital murder. And don’t get me started on the free throws. Oh boy, free throws were like a waterfall moment. The man would step to the line, and suddenly it was like the Hoover Dam burst open. You’d see the towel boys scrambling to wipe the floor after each one, like they were cleaning up after a broken water main. Sometimes I wondered if that was part of his defense strategy, making the ball slippery for the other team. I&rsquo;m pretty sure some centers couldn&rsquo;t even catch the ball properly because Ewing’s sweat was so pervasive.</p>

<p>I swear, one time, he went for a dunk, and a literal <em>mist</em> of sweat sprayed off him in slow motion, like he was some sort of moisture deity. The poor kid in the front row had to squint through it like he was caught in a rainstorm at Madison Square Garden. And the most bizarre part is how he never seemed to get dehydrated, like the guy had a secret camel-like ability to store water somewhere in his body.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t be surprised if they had to squeegee the locker room floor after he walked out of there. It wasn’t just a physical thing, it was a <em>presence</em>. Ewing didn’t need to assert dominance; his sweat did it for him. Maybe that’s why he was always just a little short of being the guy—he lost half his energy just cooling himself off. No one else was ever close to that level of pure athletic evaporation.</p>

Coming out of college he was an athletic, high-flying player.  Still, during the Knicks run, he was a very good center who had good post moves and a good jumper.</p>

<p>He was considered a step below Hakeem and Robinson and then Shaq when he came into the league.  However, he had reputation as being a mediocre playoff performer.  As a Knicks hater, I always enjoyed how his teams always came up short.</p>

      <label for="lmm2vre" class="commentText"><p>Pat Ewing played in the golden era of Big Men.</p>

<p>He came in a league with Kareem and Moses, following a rookie Hakeem, and then preceding a rookie David Robinson, before then seeing Shaq, Mourning, and Mutumbo drafted during his prime.</p>

<p>So it is easy to lose sight of how good Ewing was.</p>

<p>But he was fucking incredible. An amazing rebounder. And amazing defender. And incredible all around scorer. Great in the post. Solid mid range. Got a nice little hook.</p>

<p>If he hadn&rsquo;t been competing with Hakeem, Robinson, Mourning, and Mutumbo for DPOY and All Defensive teams, he&rsquo;d have been wowing people with his defence.</p>

<p>In the context of his era, his rebounding numbers may seem a little low, but he was also collecting boards on a deep rebounding team. Oakley. Mason. Charles Smith. etc. But he was a very strong rebounder.</p>

<p>His blocks are lower than his peers (DRon, Hakeem, Mutumbo), but he averaged 2.4 on his career, compared to Dwight&rsquo;s 1.8 (keeping in mind that Dwight won 3 DPOY awards) and compared to Gobert&rsquo;s 2.1 on his career (without that number being weighed down by lower late career stats like Ewing&rsquo;s is).</p>

<p>So he averaged more blocks than two guys who have combined for a total of 7 DPOY awards. Yes, there were more post shots and drives to block, so his number will naturally be higher for those reasons, but his average is also dragged down by his last three season.</p>

<p>You put him in this league, he&rsquo;s going to tear up the post likely better than Embidd does and defend well enough to be in the DPOY conversation every season. Ewing was also a decent passer, but plays were either run through the point or Mason, so he didn&rsquo;t get the assist numbers that other play-making C&rsquo;s got.</p>

<p>But dude was a beast. He simultaneously played in the right era and the wrong era.</p>

He was such a great shooter, but it was not en vogue for centers to shoot 3s at that point, so he took long distance 2s and was pretty much money, consistently.  His offensive game now would have exploded for sure, and that&rsquo;s taking into account that he was already an awesome offensive player during that generation.</p>

<p>On defense, he would be amazing in any generation.</p>

      <label for="lmmh0f3" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s my favorite player of all-time, grew up with him and all that.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it a few times here, but he really would be Anthony Davis more than anything else. Of course, some differences because of how different this era is, but not as different as you&rsquo;d think.</p>

<p>Both elite defender and rim protector (he had the record for most blocks in the finals for awhile).</p>

<p>He was supposed to be a bit one-dimensional defender, but he actually really stepped up his offense in the NBA, probably because he didn&rsquo;t have much support and had to and developed a good midrange game. Really like AD.</p>

<p>He had a lot of deep playoff runs, and they were mostly stopped by Jordan or the eventual champions most of the time, he rarely flamed out early like Embiid. But he also didn&rsquo;t really raise his game in the playoffs, also kind of like Embiid.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d have Jokic as #1 in his own tier. I personally put Embiid a tier below because of his health and inconsistency, but acknowledge a healthy Embiid can be as dominant, or more than Joker.</p>

<p>So my plays like big man tier, an amalgamation of the last few years</p>

<ol>
<li>Jokic</li>
<li>Ewing/Embiid, depends how much you value consistency, health and playoff success. Ewing had 10 straight years of 70+ games and being an all-star, and only 2 first round eliminations (88 celts, 91 bulls)</li>
<li>AD - I like AD, but he just is so injured. Granted he played well last year though so he could move to that 2nd tier if he gets better.</li>
<li>Bam/Sabonis</li>

      <label for="lmmiu01" class="commentText"><p>Ewing was one of the greatest college players ever.  The center of the great Georgetown teams and biggest force in the Big East when that league was coming up and became a big deal.  His teams made three National Championship games in his four years and his senior year they were thought to be unbeatable until they lost in the national championship to one of the great shooting performances in Final Four history.  Villanova’s upset win was a huge upset in 85.  After Bird/Magic he was arguably the next best college player until Laettner.  Definitely more accomplished (because of the 84 final head to head va Olajuwon’s Houston team) than Jordan or Akeem or Ralph Sampson.</p>

      <label for="lmmkki5" class="commentText"><p>Stoic and a great defender/leader with atypical offensive skillset for a No. 1 option big man, who oddly became a pretty endearing “underdog” story as did the entire Pat Riley and later Van Gundy Knicks squads constantly going up against, and coming up just short mostly to Jordan’s Bulls, but also in the Finals vs the Rockets when Jordan retired the first time, and then in 99 when the Bulls were broken up for good.</p>

<p>Was he ever as good a pure center as Hakeem or The Admiral? Probably not quite, but he was imo an All-time great and an incredibly easy root.</p>

<p>I became a Knicks “fan” in those years, always rooting for them to pull off the upset, but it never materialized.</p>

<p>Those Bulls v Knicks series on NBC were all-time TV watching. The Knicks v Pacers series were great as well.</p>

<p>Edit: And that sweat! Holy Moly!</p>

      <label for="lmml2h7" class="commentText"><p>Ewing is a guy who, whatever you think of him, you have to give a lot of credit because his knees went at a young age and the guy willed himself into becoming a completely different player while rarely missing games.</p>

<p>As for his game translating to today, that’s impossible because it is a completely different sport but, like any other great player he would have adapted. In the 90s Ewing was thought to be the best jump shooting center of all time. For me, as Knick fan who grew up with Ewing, he was hall of very good but not great. He missed too many late game free throws and shots to really be put in the pantheon. Hakeem also killed him in 94 and there were series where Rik Smits outplayed him. Even Bill Cartwright gave him problems, playing him even for far too many games. His legacy is really helped because the one center he had the number of, Alonzo Mourning, he faced in the playoffs year after year but, Zo was an overrated player himself who has greatly benefited from Pat Riley’s mythmaking of “Heat Culture”. Shaq would destroy Pat every time they played and it wasn’t pretty against the Admiral either.</p>

<p>The Knicks have been so bad since Ewing that it’s really helped grow astronimically but, at the time Patrick’s career was considered a disappointment with him not having what it takes to get over the hump.</p>

      <label for="lmlzt0a" class="commentText"><p>Probably the best modern day comparison in Kawhi without the 3, but it&rsquo;s not a good one.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s important to remember that there really is no &ldquo;modern-day equivalent&rdquo; to 99% of the guys from the 80s and 90s, because the game is so damn different than it is now. Hell, positions aren&rsquo;t even really the same any more- back then, they were rigidly defined; now, the best teams move fluidly.</p>

<p>Think about it this way: Rodman- the greatest rebounder in history- wouldn&rsquo;t have made today&rsquo;s NBA, because other than his defense, he lacked the skills early, and didn&rsquo;t make a massive jump in his game until 1990. Del Curry was a &ldquo;3 point specialist&rdquo; off the bench who played 21 minutes per game and never averaged more than 5.2 3PAs per game.</p>

<p>Unless you lived it and remember it, you don&rsquo;t understand just how massively different the game is now- other than the fact that it&rsquo;s still dribbling and putting a ball through a hoop, the game now is basically completely different than it was in the 80s and 90s.</p>

<p>but like, just watch his dunk highlights: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW5fDLlhD28" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW5fDLlhD28</a></p>

<p>these are relatively pedestrian compared to what we see guys able to do today. different era and all that sure, but still&hellip; just compare: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtECjHJsTFA" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtECjHJsTFA</a></p>

      <label for="lmm1yjt" class="commentText"><p>This link has more young Ewing dunks, when he was more athletic <a href="https://youtu.be/wR9BOmSnFGI?si=KES6dzWU3gYb09tM" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/wR9BOmSnFGI?si=KES6dzWU3gYb09tM</a> I do mean athleticism relative to their peers.  Comparing them to each other, Giannis is faster and plays lighter. Patrick had incredible power though. Comparing across generations is always difficult. Patrick honed his athleticism to the tasks asked of him (interior defense and post moves) </p>

      <label for="lmlo1yi" class="commentText"><p>Ewing&rsquo;s best season would be Giannis&rsquo; down year.</p>

<p>Ewing is good for sure, but he never even finished top 3 in MVP voting once.  Giannis has won 2 and finishes top 3 basically every year.  Ewing has also never made an all defensive first team, Giannis has won a DPOY.  Giannis is in the middle of his prime and he already has more all-NBA selections and will, barring injury, earn many more.  Your severely underselling Giannis here.  Giannis was the best player on the planet for a stretch, Ewing was never considered top 5.</p>

<p>Ewing better defender.</p>

<p>I’m definitely taking Jokic over him.</p>
