    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Looking back at basketball reference, Ewing made one All-NBA fist team and six second teams. So obviously, he was great but who would be his modern comp?</p>

<p>What was the perception of Ewing during his peak? I know he was up against Hakeem &amp; Robinson for All-NBA teams. What else is notable?</p>

<p>Oddly enough he didn&rsquo;t made an all defensive team the year he averaged 4 (!) blocks per game, in 89-90.</p>

      <label for="lmlviea" class="commentText"><p>Ewing was a two-way center with dominant defense, leading teams that won or lost on rebounding. To me growing up he was a legend - he was such a hometown hero, I don&rsquo;t recall really separating him from his team and comparing him to other centers - the other best centers were in the West anyway. That said, when I think about what impressed me at the time about Hakeem or David Robinson that Ewing didn&rsquo;t do - he wasn&rsquo;t as athletic or as quick and effective in the post as Hakeem or David Robinson, he was less of a help defender and relied more on defense in the paint, but he was a much better shooter and in any given season it was a coin toss who would be the best on defense overall - though of course in the long run I don&rsquo;t think Ewing comes out on top of that.</p>

<p>And over time the effect of his shooting was held back by three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>He shot long midrange jumpers rather than 3-pointers, because it was the 80s and 90s and nobody knew better.</li>
<li>He&rsquo;s the prototype for Dirk Nowitsky, but he&rsquo;s not Dirk Nowitsky. He wasn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> good at shooting midrange baseline jumpers.</li>
<li>He was his team&rsquo;s primary offensive option forever, and he would have benefited a ton from more spacing so he could get better looks or at least some other threat to draw away the defense that never materialized.</li>
</ol>

<p>It sucks that the one play that was on the line for him was a failed dunk - he was never really about dunking over four people, his signature was that smooth 7-footer pull-up jumper. <em>Then</em> he would get the rebound over four other people on the other end.</p>

<p>Embiid stands out as a comp because he has that combination of dominating defense, shooting, strength, and lack of foot speed. And Embiid is also assumed to be an eternal primary option on a team where that setup appears to just not quite work.</p>

<p>Ewing is like if Embiid were 20% less gifted (and incredibly hard-nosed and stoic instead of very publicly emotional) or Al Horford were 50% better.</p>

<p>I hate how much of his career/legacy is defined by losing to Jordan and that shot.  He actually has a bunch of awesome games in elimination games but got the reputation of a choker.  Even in that Pacers game that he missed the last second fingerroll, he had 29/14/5 with 4 blocks and shot <sup>12</sup>&frasl;<sub>23</sub>.</p>

He had a bad game 7, but it’s not like he sold the whole series. Riley should have pulled the plug at a dozen shots, as they had other options, but decided to try to ride it out.</p>

      <label for="lmp6lwl" class="commentText"><p>I swear he was my 2nd favorite player after Ewing, but he probably is the worst player I&rsquo;ve ever loved in hindsight. In  reality, he was Josh Hart if some coach was foolish enough to believe Josh Hart was a 2nd option. Played hard, so so hard. A prototypical overachiever, but he was just far below the talent level required of the role they gave him. And as much as we loved his grit and defense, EVERY scoring guard who wanted to score mopped the floor with him. Jordan? OK, what can you do. But there were others too and in big games. Not to mention that choke job in the finals.</p>

<p>And it definitely isn&rsquo;t all his fault, but when you look back and realize that for a while, he was the best sidekick the Knicks can muster, know wonder Julius couldn&rsquo;t win at the highest level. He never had true all-star level help. True allstar, IK Josh and Mason made an appearance but cmon, you know the difference.</p>

<p>Ewing peaked at FOUR blocks a game. Embiid has never had more than 2.5 in his rookie season and has regressed in all block stats. Different setups obviously, but Ewing was the superior defensive player IMO. Their rebounds and steals are close enough.</p>

<p>Embiid is a foul merchant who sits at the free throw line to earn efficiency. Ewing absolutely never had that.</p>

<p>Embiid has averaged OVER 10 FREE THREE THROWS FIVE TIMES IN HIS SHORT CAREER, a feat few people can claim. He beat 11 a game three times.</p>

<p>Ewing never went to the foul line more than 7.9 times a game in any season.</p>

<p>Huge fucking difference. Like seriously Embiid has THREE straight 11 FTA seasons going right now lmao. He also happens to be an excellent free throw shooter.</p>

<p>Giving him the edge is basically just because of his free throws, similar to why a lot of nephews worship Kobe. Joel shot 88% from the line last season. That&rsquo;s absolutely excellent for anybody.</p>

<p>But is he really better than peak Ewing? I don&rsquo;t really think so. They match up quite well in fact. Different era&rsquo;s so the three is more prominent, but Ewing at least would have been putting them up he was a good shooter.</p>

<p>I think your point about spacing and using him as the primary scorer was kind of the Knicks detriment, and could explain why rethinking their offensive strategy with him gone could have created opportunities.</p>

      <label for="lmmx8m4" class="commentText"><p>Which is one of the worst terms ever created. Patrick won the most playoff games out of any knick ever. In fact he won over 3x more playoff games than the knicks have since he left. The 99 season the knicks won 3 games without him in the ECF and 1 in the finals which is the basis for the Ewing theory. 4 playoff wins out of the 79 he won!</p>

      <label for="lmpjf6h" class="commentText"><p>Came here to suggest Embiid as well as a life long Bulls fan who watched his team battle Ewings Knicks.</p>

<p>I always loved that rivalry the most because both teams played hard as fuck without being deliberately dirty. Tensions definitely boiled over on occasion but it wasn&rsquo;t like the fucking Pistons intentionally trying to hurt people.</p>

<p>We really lived in an era of giants with Hakeem, Admiral, Shaq and Ewing, etc.</p>

<p>Embiid is a great comparison as I&rsquo;m not sure Patrick could switch out and guard perimeter guys, no center could back then, so two way guys like AD or Bam who aren&rsquo;t bad comps but the looming swatting nature of Ewing harkens more to Gobert but he lacks the offense, leaving us with Joel.</p>

      <label for="lmlpdn3" class="commentText"><p>I think he would actually play kind of similarly to Embiid but maybe a lesser version - solid mid range jump shooter with some post moves and a great shot blocker/defender. Not as good of a playmaker as Embiid. AD isn&rsquo;t a bad comparison either but I feel like AD was more mobile and had more PF qualities than Ewing.  I think Ewing would be a bit below Jokic/Embiid currently but he would be a step above the Sabonis/Bam tier for sure. Closer to the former than latter.</p>

      <label for="lmmaw8f" class="commentText"><p>Regarding playmaking, I think it is important to note that playmaking expectations of today are dramatically different compared to Ewing&rsquo;s era</p>

<p>For example, among the ten highest points/game from last season, Tatum had the fewest assists/game at 4.9</p>

<p>If you go back to the 1990 season (Ewing&rsquo;s highest scoring season), that would rank as the second highest assists/game among the top 10 scorers.</p>

<p>(Or if you flip it, MJ&rsquo;s 6.3 assists/game in 1990 would have ranked 6th in 2024 among the top scorers instead of leading it by 2 whole assists/game)</p>

      <label for="lmnmiun" class="commentText"><p>imo it&rsquo;s also due to big men needing to pass out of the post earlier now due to zone defense coverage. Back when they could only man and hard double, it was a lot easier to see where the double was coming from and because of the lack of zone, doubles would come later than they do now. So it was easier and better to get a shot at the rim vs. kicking it out for a lower percentage midrange 2. A lot of 90&rsquo;s centers averaged more assists in the years the 3 point line was shortened.</p>

      <label for="lmmhhoq" class="commentText"><p>For context on stats here:</p>

<p>Ewing in 97-98 was 44% from 10-16 feet and 59% from 16-3P. He was 35 at the time, we don’t have stats for shooting from before 96-97.</p>

<p>Overall, though, prime Ewing had a wild 115 FG+, which is about where prime KD is. KD also has similar midrange splits during his OKC/GSW years.</p>

<p>Embiid last year was 47% from 10-16 feet and 52% from 16-3P. I think it’s fair to say that prime Ewing would have the same shooting touch as current Embiid.</p>

<p>The previous year where he shot 40% he attempted almost 7 times as many shots.</p>

<p>The best evidence we actually have is that Ewing shoots 74% from the line and Embiid shoots 83%. Embiid is a very good shooter.</p>

<p>We also have some insight from the shorter three point line. Ewing stepped out to shoot them then. It was a disaster.</p>

Center position has the weakest high end depth of positions. Ewing would be by a considerable margin below those two, but also by a considerable margin above guys like Bam or Sabonis. He would be 3rd in an island.</p>

Ewing was a good shooter but never considered shooting threes. He was incredibly athletic but would only have handled the ball in the post most of the time. If someone with Ewing&rsquo;s ability were coming up today, he&rsquo;d be better than Embiid on offense and defense and would have great ball handling skills as well.</p>

      <label for="lmmeppa" class="commentText"><p>Embiid is the more talented pure shooter and scorer, but I think Ewing had a lot more physical and mental toughness than Embiid. Think sort of like the mental difference between Kobe and DeRozan. Ewing had more of that sturdy, ferocious, dependable warrior demeanor about him. I don&rsquo;t get as much of a sense of that from Embiid, and it&rsquo;s important, especially for a big who&rsquo;s supposed to be dominating and protecting the paint and the boards. Ewing was the defensive anchor of the 90s Knicks whose run of success depended primarily on defense, and one of those teams (I think the 93 team) has one of the top defensive ratings in NBA history. That all starts and ends with Ewing&rsquo;s enormous defensive presence.</p>

<p>Also, after playing 50 and 63 games in his first two seasons, Ewing went on to have a 10 year run from his age 25 - 34 seasons in which he averaged playing 80 games per season, 37 minutes per game, before his health and availability took a nose dive starting in his age 35 season. (During this run, his per-game averages were 24 ppg, 10.6 rpg, 2.8 bpg, 2.2 apg, 1.0 spg.) That relates to his toughness, since mid-career he started having knee issues and lost a lot of mobility compared to his younger years, but he always played through it. I&rsquo;d take a fully healthy Embiid over Ewing since a fully healthy Embiid is a multi-MVP caliber player, but taking health and availability into consideration, I&rsquo;d easily take Ewing&rsquo;s prime over Embiid&rsquo;s.</p>

      <label for="lmm72gi" class="commentText"><p>Man, I’m glad someone finally brought this up. Ewing’s sweat was on another level. Like, we’re talking <strong>legendary</strong> perspiration here. I remember watching a game back in the mid-90s when I noticed he looked like he stepped out of the pool before the national anthem was even done. He wasn’t just sweaty <em>during</em> the game—Ewing was pre-sweating in the locker room, like he had an advanced warm-up regime based purely around hydration loss. I imagine his jersey had to be industrial-grade moisture-wicking fabric, but by the end of the first quarter, it looked like he came out of the Hudson.</p>

<p>It wasn’t just during intense games either—he’d be in warmups, casually jogging back and forth, and this guy looked like Ted Cruz getting interrogated for capital murder. And don’t get me started on the free throws. Oh boy, free throws were like a waterfall moment. The man would step to the line, and suddenly it was like the Hoover Dam burst open. You’d see the towel boys scrambling to wipe the floor after each one, like they were cleaning up after a broken water main. Sometimes I wondered if that was part of his defense strategy, making the ball slippery for the other team. I&rsquo;m pretty sure some centers couldn&rsquo;t even catch the ball properly because Ewing’s sweat was so pervasive.</p>

<p>I swear, one time, he went for a dunk, and a literal <em>mist</em> of sweat sprayed off him in slow motion, like he was some sort of moisture deity. The poor kid in the front row had to squint through it like he was caught in a rainstorm at Madison Square Garden. And the most bizarre part is how he never seemed to get dehydrated, like the guy had a secret camel-like ability to store water somewhere in his body.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t be surprised if they had to squeegee the locker room floor after he walked out of there. It wasn’t just a physical thing, it was a <em>presence</em>. Ewing didn’t need to assert dominance; his sweat did it for him. Maybe that’s why he was always just a little short of being the guy—he lost half his energy just cooling himself off. No one else was ever close to that level of pure athletic evaporation.</p>

      <label for="lmmos15" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m glad someone brought up how sweaty he was. That was really one of the more memorable things about Ewing. I actually felt pretty bad for him later in his career when he was lumbering up and down the court with giant knee braces and just sweating profusely. Looked pretty miserable.</p>

<p>But yeah, he was always a tier down from the best players in the league. Lot of Knicks fans understandably showing up in this thread and upvoting every positive comment about how Ewing got screwed over, wrong era, blah blah blah. Truth is he was just a really good player, not a great one. He was automatic when it came to like a 10-foot jumper, but his offensive game wasn&rsquo;t super well-rounded and he had trouble getting good offense in the playoffs at really tight moments. Dominant on defense when it came to protecting the paint, but lacked the versatility that guys like Hakeem or David Robinson had.</p>

<p>Comparing him to AD in terms of overall skill and accomplishment is pretty fair IMHO, but Knicks fans are all over this thread trashing that take.</p>

<p>Ewing had a series-winning putback dunk against the Pacers. Not to mention putting up 24 points, 22 rebounds, 7 assists, and 5 blocks. He lead those teams on a bunch of deep playoff runs in the 90s, and in a lot of games he carried the offense down the stretch.</p>

And he wasn&rsquo;t in an era where people would pretend he&rsquo;s a power forward to get him more votes.</p>

<p>I would argue the comp is less individually talented James Harden. The eternal bridesmaid that got <em>this</em> close but had to spend his whole prime losing to the dynasty. Obviously Harden&rsquo;s indicidual hardware clears Ewing, but nobody got screwed by Jordan more than Ewing and nobody got screwed by the Warriors more than Harden. Ewing never got help nearly as talented as Harden got at their peak though.</p>

Rick Smits on Indiana always gave Ewing problems, but they don&rsquo;t get past Miami and Mourning without Ewing.  Patrick went down in the Indiana series and Camby stepped in and was a better match up.</p>

<p>Then, in the Finals, the Knicks had no chance without Ewing.  With Ewing and Camby possibly being on the floor together they may have been a match for San Antonio.</p>

<p>This is trivial to the point of not being worth saying. If it wasn&rsquo;t for illegal defense rules no one would have ever followed him out to the arc. He averaged like 1 make per season in his career.</p>

<p>The mid-range game was the real threat.</p>

      <label for="lmm2vre" class="commentText"><p>Pat Ewing played in the golden era of Big Men.</p>

<p>He came in a league with Kareem and Moses, following a rookie Hakeem, and then preceding a rookie David Robinson, before then seeing Shaq, Mourning, and Mutumbo drafted during his prime.</p>

<p>So it is easy to lose sight of how good Ewing was.</p>

<p>But he was fucking incredible. An amazing rebounder. And amazing defender. And incredible all around scorer. Great in the post. Solid mid range. Got a nice little hook.</p>

<p>If he hadn&rsquo;t been competing with Hakeem, Robinson, Mourning, and Mutumbo for DPOY and All Defensive teams, he&rsquo;d have been wowing people with his defence.</p>

<p>In the context of his era, his rebounding numbers may seem a little low, but he was also collecting boards on a deep rebounding team. Oakley. Mason. Charles Smith. etc. But he was a very strong rebounder.</p>

<p>His blocks are lower than his peers (DRon, Hakeem, Mutumbo), but he averaged 2.4 on his career, compared to Dwight&rsquo;s 1.8 (keeping in mind that Dwight won 3 DPOY awards) and compared to Gobert&rsquo;s 2.1 on his career (without that number being weighed down by lower late career stats like Ewing&rsquo;s is).</p>

<p>So he averaged more blocks than two guys who have combined for a total of 7 DPOY awards. Yes, there were more post shots and drives to block, so his number will naturally be higher for those reasons, but his average is also dragged down by his last three season.</p>

<p>You put him in this league, he&rsquo;s going to tear up the post likely better than Embidd does and defend well enough to be in the DPOY conversation every season. Ewing was also a decent passer, but plays were either run through the point or Mason, so he didn&rsquo;t get the assist numbers that other play-making C&rsquo;s got.</p>

<p>But dude was a beast. He simultaneously played in the right era and the wrong era.</p>

      <label for="lmm0t71" class="commentText"><p>Most of Ewing&rsquo;s NBA highlights were when the Knicks were good.  At that point he had bad knees and had lost a lot of his explosiveness.  Coming out of college he was an athletic, high-flying player.  Still, during the Knicks run, he was a very good center who had good post moves and a good jumper.</p>

<p>He was considered a step below Hakeem and Robinson and then Shaq when he came into the league.  However, he had reputation as being a mediocre playoff performer.  As a Knicks hater, I always enjoyed how his teams always came up short.</p>

      <label for="lmmyt6e" class="commentText"><p>The debate seems to have settled on David Robinson&rsquo;s side in retrospect, but I remember as a kid it being pretty contentious who was the 2nd best center in the league after Hakeem. Ewing was for sure the bigger star than Robinson at the time, but I remember a lot of the discourse around him being that he was a perennial loser who couldn&rsquo;t get it done when it mattered.</p>

<p>Once I got old enough to actually like watch games and have opinions, I felt like he was being asked to carry way more of an offensive burden than he should have. He had a great post game and solid midrange, but he has some all-time great defensive seasons (largely overshadowed by Hakeem and Mutombo).</p>

<p>Felt like Spree and Houston unlocked what that team was supposed to be, but by the time they got there, Ewing was kind of washed.</p>

<p>As far as modern(ish) comps, maybe like a better version of Nets Brook Lopez.</p>

      <label for="lmnv5qt" class="commentText"><p>Ewing was underrated because of the era he played in. I&rsquo;ve seen people in this sub compare Dwight Howard and Ewing and conclude that Dwight Howard was the superior player, because of career accolades during their primes.</p>

<p>Ewing was going up against some of the best centres to ever play the game. There were no great centres in the NBA when Dwight Howard was in his peak.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching the NBA since the late 80&rsquo;s&hellip; there&rsquo;s no fucking contest between Dwight Howard and Patrick Ewing. I&rsquo;m certain anyone who actually watched a lot of games of both of these guys play, would definitely pick Patrick Ewing over Dwight Howard.</p>

<p>I think if Patrick Ewings career timeline had fallen into the 2000s, he would have had a shit load of All-NBA First team accolades and I think he&rsquo;d be remembered differently and closer to how good he actually was.</p>

<p>He’s not remembered as fondly as he might be because he came in as hyped as any player ever, and never quite lived up to it, especially playing under the bright lights of NYC where they expected him to be the root of a dynasty. He also played in a golden age of centers, so he’s also underrated a bit there, particularly on D.</p>

      <label for="lmnkhgh" class="commentText"><p>A few notes on Ewing:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Before the knee injuries (which he continued to play through in the later half of his prime), he was a great athlete for his size. Not as mobile as someone like hakeem, but a true 7 footer playing above the rim on both ends of the floor, and ran the break very well (the 88-89 Knicks for example won 52 games and ranked 5th in pace). Take a look at his 89-90 season. He was a flat out beast.</p></li>

<li><p>He legitimately carried the Knicks on his back on offense during his prime which led to some inconsistent efficiency. Never had a real second option (see Starks in the 94 finals) and thus couldn&rsquo;t be that selective with his shooting. If guys like Houston and Sprewell got there a few years earlier, it would&rsquo;ve benefited him quite a bit and I think he&rsquo;d have a ring.</p></li>

<li><p>Anchored all time great defenses for several years. Knicks made the playoffs 14 straight years with Ewing, which was second to only the blazers during that span. While he isn&rsquo;t quite on that hakeem/robinson level, still a top 10 center of all time and in the top 30-35 all time. He gets his due but I do think he&rsquo;s still under appreciated at times.</p></li>

      <label for="lmmh0f3" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s my favorite player of all-time, grew up with him and all that.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it a few times here, but he really would be Anthony Davis more than anything else. Of course, some differences because of how different this era is, but not as different as you&rsquo;d think.</p>

<p>Both elite defender and rim protector (he had the record for most blocks in the finals for awhile).</p>

<p>He was supposed to be a bit one-dimensional defender, but he actually really stepped up his offense in the NBA, probably because he didn&rsquo;t have much support and had to and developed a good midrange game. Really like AD.</p>

<p>He had a lot of deep playoff runs, and they were mostly stopped by Jordan or the eventual champions most of the time, he rarely flamed out early like Embiid. But he also didn&rsquo;t really raise his game in the playoffs, also kind of like Embiid.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d have Jokic as #1 in his own tier. I personally put Embiid a tier below because of his health and inconsistency, but acknowledge a healthy Embiid can be as dominant, or more than Joker.</p>

<p>So my plays like big man tier, an amalgamation of the last few years</p>

<ol>
<li>Jokic</li>
<li>Ewing/Embiid, depends how much you value consistency, health and playoff success. Ewing had 10 straight years of 70+ games and being an all-star, and only 2 first round eliminations (88 celts, 91 bulls)</li>
<li>AD - I like AD, but he just is so injured. Granted he played well last year though so he could move to that 2nd tier if he gets better.</li>
<li>Bam/Sabonis</li>

      <label for="lmmiu01" class="commentText"><p>Ewing was one of the greatest college players ever.  The center of the great Georgetown teams and biggest force in the Big East when that league was coming up and became a big deal.  His teams made three National Championship games in his four years and his senior year they were thought to be unbeatable until they lost in the national championship to one of the great shooting performances in Final Four history.  Villanova’s upset win was a huge upset in 85.  After Bird/Magic he was arguably the next best college player until Laettner.  Definitely more accomplished (because of the 84 final head to head va Olajuwon’s Houston team) than Jordan or Akeem or Ralph Sampson.</p>

<p>Was he ever as good a pure center as Hakeem or The Admiral? Probably not quite, but he was imo an All-time great and an incredibly easy root.</p>

<p>I became a Knicks “fan” in those years, always rooting for them to pull off the upset, but it never materialized.</p>

<p>Those Bulls v Knicks series on NBC were all-time TV watching. The Knicks v Pacers series were great as well.</p>

      <label for="lmml2h7" class="commentText"><p>Ewing is a guy who, whatever you think of him, you have to give a lot of credit because his knees went at a young age and the guy willed himself into becoming a completely different player while rarely missing games.</p>

<p>As for his game translating to today, that’s impossible because it is a completely different sport but, like any other great player he would have adapted. In the 90s Ewing was thought to be the best jump shooting center of all time. For me, as Knick fan who grew up with Ewing, he was hall of very good but not great. He missed too many late game free throws and shots to really be put in the pantheon. Hakeem also killed him in 94 and there were series where Rik Smits outplayed him. Even Bill Cartwright gave him problems, playing him even for far too many games. His legacy is really helped because the one center he had the number of, Alonzo Mourning, he faced in the playoffs year after year but, Zo was an overrated player himself who has greatly benefited from Pat Riley’s mythmaking of “Heat Culture”. Shaq would destroy Pat every time they played and it wasn’t pretty against the Admiral either.</p>

<p>The Knicks have been so bad since Ewing that it’s really helped his reputation grow astronimically but, at the time Patrick’s career was considered a disappointment with him not having what it takes to get over the hump. It also says a lot about Patrick that his teammates never exactly loved him. The dude played selfishly a lot. He also had stone hands which killed the Knicks at inopportune times.</p>

<p>I know it sounds like I hate Patrick but, I don’t. I respect the hell our of him for getting every ounce out of a body that was failing him while rarely taking a night off but, it’s also gotten to point with him where the legend has become fact and people are printing it.</p>

He relied on his fade away in these spots even when it wasn&rsquo;t going in. Charles Smith can&rsquo;t make a layup! He was definitely a center! They needed way more shooters around him.</p>

      <label for="lmmvqfv" class="commentText"><p>Ewing was one of my favorites growing up. A hard-nosed two way player who dominated the paint for rebounds. He definitely had the offensive prowess, but his defense is usually what showed up most.</p>

<p>He had a good mid range for his position which was uncommon at the time, it really gave him an advantage at times depending on the opponent.</p>

<p>Embiid is a decent comparison but just not as athletic.</p>

      <label for="lmmvro4" class="commentText"><p>I feel like of the four (Shaq, Hakeem, David Robinson, Ewing) great centers in the 90s Ewing gets the least love. People take easy shots at his greatest because he&rsquo;s one of those unfortunate legends of the 90s without a ring,(Thanks a lot MJ) but there&rsquo;s no denying his greatness. And you could make an argument he was the most skilled of those four. Put some respect on Pat&rsquo;s name.  Long Live Hoya Paranoia!</p>

<p>He also undoubtedly played with the least amount of help during his prime years. Look at the other three&rsquo;s teammates AND coaches.</p>

The closest comparison to that I can think of is Carmelo having to settle for second team even at his peak because he just wasn&rsquo;t a better forward than Durant or LeBron.</p>

      <label for="lmn2kgq" class="commentText"><p>Patrick Ewing was an exceptional player, known for his scoring, rebounding, and shot-blocking ability. A modern comparison might be someone like Joel Embiid, who also combines scoring prowess with strong defense. During his peak, Ewing was seen as a dominant force and a cornerstone for the New York Knicks, consistently competing at a high level despite facing other legendary centers like Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson. His omission from the All-Defensive team in 89-90 despite averaging 4 blocks per game is indeed surprising, highlighting just how competitive the era was.</p>

      <label for="lmn8eo2" class="commentText"><p>Ewing was a tremendous post defender and shot blocker on the man he was guarding down low, but he was not fast and was not a notable help defender.  He was perfectly suited for his era, but I don&rsquo;t think he would have been as effective on defense in today&rsquo;s game.</p>

<p>On offense he would still be effective today because he had a great midrange game, and there is always room for that, but he would not be the lead scorer that he was back in the 1990s.  Threes and dunks are simply more efficient.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I have a modern comp for him.  Maybe Embiid, but not as good at either end.</p>

<p>Remember that he never won an MVP or DPOY so he was not considered amongst the greatest centers of that 80s-90s era like Robinson, Kareem, Malone, or Hakeem.</p>

<p>That said, his success level is similar to what Embiid is right now where he is a top player and helps his team get into the playoffs but cannot win it when it counts.</p>

<p>Skill-wise, he&rsquo;s probably closer to something like DeAndre Ayton but with more power and physicality.</p>

      <label for="lmnbnyo" class="commentText"><p>Great midrange shooter, have somewhat of a soft touch, but he dunks really hard and is a great rim protector. This may not be a popular opinion, but as much as people compare Embiid to Hakeem due to his footwork and some guard moves, I think Embiid is the more similar to Ewing than Hakeem. Embiid is basically whatif Ewing became more perimeter orienated and has the ball more in his hands. Both of these guys have a tendency to shoot alot of midrange jumpers, and also both these guys are mobile and coordinated for big men standards but not at the level of Hakeem and Robinson. Also despite Ewing never winning an mvp or being a socring leader and Embiid never getting out of the second round, the general census views both of them being all time great big men, but also being overshadowed but another center (aka Hakeem and Jokic). They are usually viewed as the 2nd best center of their generation, sometimes number 1, but usually in the minority</p>

      <label for="lmncqbf" class="commentText"><p>Thing to remember is that Ewing played during an era when Center was the marquee position.  In a sense, it was like the Point-Forward of the era.  And, Ewing was a clear #3 throughout most of his career (after Hakeem and Moses, then Hakeem and D.Robinson, then Shaq and Mourning), although he may have been a #1 for one or two seasons.  And, obviously he never won a championship although he came agonizingly close a couple of times.  He was very highly regarded on both ends of the floor but without either the skills or the killer instinct to get his team to the very top.</p>

<p>In that way, my comp would be someone like Jimmy Butler, Paul George, or Joel Embiid.</p>

Like Ewing, Embiid has a weak post up game but has a sweet jumper and can face up opposing big men. Embiid has a much better handle and can shoot 3’s but that’s merely a product of the era he’s playing in.</p>

      <label for="lmo79yx" class="commentText"><p>Nice stats in his prime (though I want more than .500 FG% from an interior player). Always struck me as very very good, but not truly great. If he’d been more athletic and mobile (and achieved some better playoff results), that would’ve pushed him higher. My recollection of the time is that he was considered one of the best centers in the league and the NYK franchise player, but basically no one made the mistake of putting him alongside or above Hakeem the Dream, Shaq, or even David Robinson. I’d put him and Alonzo Mourning as tier 2 90s centers.</p>

      <label for="lmodnvk" class="commentText"><p>The fact that he made only one All-NBA fist team and was on the top-5 in the MVP list 6x is crazy.</p>

<p>The year he didn&rsquo;t made an all defensive team averaging 4 blocks per game, he averaged 1 steal, and 10.9 rebounds, while Hakeem averaged 4.6 blocks, 2.1 steals, and 14 rebounds, and Robinson averaged 3.9 blocks, 1.7 steals, and 12 rebounds. There were only two all-defensive teams in that year, and I think he was one of the reasons the league created the 3rd all-defensive team next year.</p>

      <label for="lmp07nw" class="commentText"><p>Believe it or not, prime-Ewing’s player comp would be Giannis. His athletic prime was in Georgetown when he was running and jumping like a 7-foot pogo stick. Because of the era that he played in, he was forced to bulk up really fast and busted both of his knees in his first two years in the league. Ewing’s greatness lies in the fact that he got all those accolades DESPITE not having any knees to play on throughout his entire career.</p>

      <label for="lmp3g50" class="commentText"><p>I was listening to a song a while ago (20 years ago) and the guy rapping said something like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put 2 holes in your head bigger than Patrick Ewings nostrils!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This made me laugh cuz well Pat has a big nose, not bigger than mine tho.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to see Ewing taking a few steps out more and hitting 3&rsquo;s in today&rsquo;s game.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;d also fucking merc you on the post with his mid range mixed in. He was a monster.</p>

<p>He was also likeable. And I&rsquo;m a Celtic homer.</p>
