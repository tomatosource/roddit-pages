<blockquote>
<p>So Gores made a final run at Williams, who had gotten favorable news about his wife’s condition, and offered him a financial package that shook the league’s foundation. He got his man but not the results he desired. Williams initially told the team he was not interested in coaching, then he spent much of the season acting like it.</p>

<p><em>Will Gores get out of the way this time, after hiring Trajan Langdon as president of basketball operations and eating some $65 million still owed to Williams?</em></p>

<p>I’m always suspicious of owners who seem to crave the spotlight. Their egos often outpace their acumen when it comes to building a championship team. If Gores thinks it’s a flex that he’s able to eat $65 million for a departed coach, he’s wrong. It’s an embarrassment that he ever put himself in this position. It’s also confirmation that, generally speaking, owners are best seen and not heard from.</p>

      <label for="l9g68vv" class="commentText"><p>I really don&rsquo;t understand the culture of firing coaches every season. Why is it always the coach&rsquo;s fault? If Monty was coaching literally any team in the playoffs this year, would that playoff team&rsquo;s results in the post season be much different than what they already were? I highly doubt it. A good coach is great to have, but a lot of times, teams fail because of the players and because the team is poorly constructed.</p>

<p>Doubt he cares though. This was a historic heist. Being an ex-NBA coach has to be the best job in the entire world.</p>

      <label for="l9g6ghr" class="commentText"><p>For the most part, I agree with your sentiment on coaches being consistently scapegoated when front offices make poor roster decisions.</p>

<p>However, Monty was making terrible coaching and personnel decisions all on his own from day one to his last day in Detroit:</p>

<p>Troy Weaver was in the process of moving Killian Hayes off the team last summer, but Monty insisted he would be a key part of the rotation. And he was (until he got waived midseason and no other NBA team picked him up)</p>

      <label for="l9g9rhr" class="commentText"><p>I legitimately think he was trying to get fired on purpose though. He was playing guys like Killian Hayes and Isaiah Livers over Ivey, while just having terrible rotations in general. He definitely didn’t want to be there.</p>

<p>But generally firing coaches is much easier than replacing a whole team, that’s the primary answer.</p>

<p>In general I agree it’s not all on the coach. We have seen some instances of a good coach keeping a mediocre team above where they would be with other coaches because of good overall structure and game planning.</p>

      <label for="l9gh877" class="commentText"><p>People on this subreddit have zero sense of nuance and context. Yes Monty did a bad job, it sounds like he was pretty open about not wanting to coach, then really indirectly pressured into it by the biggest paycheck ever and an offer for relief on his outside life circumstances that was holding him back from coaching. This is also just as much of an indictment on the Pistons as it is his, they shouldn’t have spent literally the most amount of money possible for somebody they were warned beforehand they weren’t 100% committed to coaching and then be surprised at the results. Hate him all you want, is anyone turning down 78 million to coach a team that’s already expected to be bad?</p>

<p>Dwayne Casey had a better record while missing Cade for a full season, Ivey and Duren were in their rookie seasons, and no Ausar. Nobody thought this was going to be a great team last year, but there is no excuse for last year’s regression, not just in record, but in player development.</p>
