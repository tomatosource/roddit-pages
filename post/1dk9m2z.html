<blockquote>
<p>So Gores made a final run at Williams, who had gotten favorable news about his wife’s condition, and offered him a financial package that shook the league’s foundation. He got his man but not the results he desired. Williams initially told the team he was not interested in coaching, then he spent much of the season acting like it.</p>

<p><em>Will Gores get out of the way this time, after hiring Trajan Langdon as president of basketball operations and eating some $65 million still owed to Williams?</em></p>

<p>I’m always suspicious of owners who seem to crave the spotlight. Their egos often outpace their acumen when it comes to building a championship team. If Gores thinks it’s a flex that he’s able to eat $65 million for a departed coach, he’s wrong. It’s an embarrassment that he ever put himself in this position. It’s also confirmation that, generally speaking, owners are best seen and not heard from.</p>

From all reports coming out lately is he had no friends left in the organization after last year because he refused to build any relationships or show any leadership the role. The roster was bad but Monty did an all time bad coaching job. Stop with your crocodile tears for something you have no clue about</p>

      <label for="l9g68vv" class="commentText"><p>I really don&rsquo;t understand the culture of firing coaches every season. Why is it always the coach&rsquo;s fault? If Monty was coaching literally any team in the playoffs this year, would that playoff team&rsquo;s results in the post season be much different than what they already were? I highly doubt it. A good coach is great to have, but a lot of times, teams fail because of the players and because the team is poorly constructed.</p>

<p>Doubt he cares though. This was a historic heist. Being an ex-NBA coach has to be the best job in the entire world.</p>

      <label for="l9g6ghr" class="commentText"><p>For the most part, I agree with your sentiment on coaches being consistently scapegoated when front offices make poor roster decisions.</p>

<p>However, Monty was making terrible coaching and personnel decisions all on his own from day one to his last day in Detroit:</p>

<p>Troy Weaver was in the process of moving Killian Hayes off the team last summer, but Monty insisted he would be a key part of the rotation. And he was (until he got waived midseason and no other NBA team picked him up)</p>

<p>But generally firing coaches is much easier than replacing a whole team, that’s the primary answer.</p>

<p>In general I agree it’s not all on the coach. We have seen some instances of a good coach keeping a mediocre team above where they would be with other coaches because of good overall structure and game planning.</p>
