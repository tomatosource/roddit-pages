      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1f5m57u/its_amazing_how_nba_history_is_written_and/"><p>It’s amazing how NBA history is written and partitioned so neatly into decades.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>What I mean is the 60s (decade of Celtics and Lakers) literally starts with the Celtics winning in 1960 and ends with in a 1969 classic Lakers vs Celtics featuring all the 60s legends Chamberlain, Balyor, West, Russell, Havlicek, with the Celtics winning.</p>

<p>The 70s (decade of parity and KAJ) literally starts with the Knicks then KAJ winning. And ends with it featuring a Finals in 1979 with two teams and player’s representative of parity (no real superstars and two small market teams that aren’t dominant franchises/dynasties).</p>

<p>The 80s, without missing a beat, starts with Bird Magic being drafted and Magic/Lakers winning in the first year of the decade. The rest of the decade is history, with the Lakers or Celtics featured every single year.</p>

<p>The 90s (91, cheating a bit but close enough) starts with none other than the Bulls/Jordan beating the old 80s Lakers dynasty, seriously can this be any more well written?</p>

<p>The 90s ends and 2000s starts with Shaq/Kobe/Duncan (without a doubt the top 3 2000s players) all winning their first titles and ends with one of them winning as well.</p>

<p>The 2010s decade again starts (ok 2011, cheating a bit here) with Lebron making his second and first amongst his 8 consecutive finals and ends with Lebron winning.</p>

<p>The 2020s (seems like it will be the age of parity again) starts with 5 different teams winning.</p>

<p>No insight, just a bit amazed how neatly these decades fall into place. And yes there’s a lot of ‘historians writing a story’ bias but I mean it’s still quite amazing imo.</p>

Lebron was the best player for most of the 00s. The 10s is Lebron and Steph but again these guys are still the faces of the league well into the 20s.</p>

      <label for="lkvd1t3" class="commentText"><p>The Bad Boys are the line IMO. They were as close to being a dynasty as possible without actually being one. Frankly even if they had won the 87 ECF game 7 and lost in the finals, I think the 4 straight finals would’ve put them over the hump too for me even if it were only 2 titles. But I’m also willing to consider the 2010s heat a dynasty with that resume-4 straight finals with back to back titles and 2 losses- and I know others don’t consider that enough.</p>

      <label for="lkvgdi6" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I think even Isiah Thomas has said this. He&rsquo;s mentioned that the fact that he got hurt in the 1988 Finals always still eats at him, because if they won that series, they&rsquo;d have been considered a full-blown late-80&rsquo;s dynasty. </p>

<p>The Bad Boys Pistons are still very well known, but I think most people think of them more of a stop-gap and a stepping stone for the Bulls, than a dynasty on their own. But if they won in 1988, that definitely wouldn&rsquo;t be the case. </p>

      <label for="lktzkb5" class="commentText"><p>The 80s is a particularly amazing and very convenient snapshot of NBA history cause Magic and Bird effectively traded rings and MVPs for nearly the entirety of it, and then both retired just a year apart. Counting ‘79-80 and ‘89-90, they won a combined 6 MVPs and 8 championships in the decade, with multiple top <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> MVP finishes as well. Just thorough domination.</p>

<p>It’s just remarkable given how closely they were already tied to the hip before even playing an NBA game. Also they just happen to be #1 and #2 all-time in career regular season win percentage, because why not?</p>

<p>And then of course there was the emergence of a certain guy named Michael Jordan…</p>

      <label for="lkvdrzq" class="commentText"><p>Yeah and they both benefitted from some intervention by the league with bird rights and the Gail Goodrich ruling, as well as salary rules that made it possible to keep awesome role players around for way longer than possible now. Keeping guys like AC Green, Michael Cooper, Dennis Johnson and Danny Ainge <em>alongside</em> a true big 3 for years and years would never be possible today so it’s unfair to compare to modern day, where contenders have to constantly shuffle roster spots 4-15.</p>

The Cavs also had 3 all stars all playing on the same team in their prime, Boston won the title last year with 3-4 all stars in their primes and an incredible deep bench. Miami had two all time players when Lebron was there AND an all star + even recruited Ray in the last years. You had Shaq and Kobe greatest 1-2 punch of all time etc etc. The league today is more top heavy not less.</p>

<p>So when it&rsquo;s the 80s it&rsquo;s &ldquo;the league intervened to create dynasties,&rdquo; but when GS does it it&rsquo;s just a &ldquo;coincidence&rdquo;?</p>

White never has and it’s been years since KP or Holiday have, and never with the Celtics. I agree they are all star <em>caliber</em> tho, all of them. Like Scottie Barnes made the all star team last year, and he’s worse than all three of those guys.</p>

<p>Since the 20th century was 1901-2000 but the 1900s is still 1900-1999, then I think &ldquo;the last decade of the 20th century&rdquo; would be 1991-2000 but &ldquo;the nineties&rdquo; would be 1990-1999.</p>

<p>So the first decade of the first century is 1-10 AD, but &ldquo;the ones(?)&rdquo; would just be 1-9 AD.</p>

For example, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve worked at this job for the last decade.&rdquo;  This means I&rsquo;ve worked at this job for 10 years, from 2015 to 2024.  That is a decade of job experience.</p>

<p>We reference the 00s (for example) as specifically those 10 years.  So that&rsquo;s a decade because it&rsquo;s 10 years.  It&rsquo;s irrelevant whether the calendar starts at year 1 or year 0 because we are not referencing whether this is the xth number of decade in our current calendar.  We are simply grouping a period of 10 years together.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s the first decade?  The first decade would be the first 10 years the universe came into existence, which I don&rsquo;t know what BCE it was.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1954 (<em>shot clock sped everything up</em>),</p></li>

<li><p>1957 (<em>Russell joining the league transformed league defenses and offenses, plus it was right in here that several super-talented black players came in that changed how black players were used and &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; to play: Stokes, Russell, Wilt, Oscar</em>),</p></li>

<li><p>1970 (<em>new ball immediately impacted offensive efficiencies and massive talent dilution due to over-expansion and ABA getting more talent</em>),</p></li>

<li><p>1977 (<em>the merger caused a lot of changes</em>),</p></li>

<li><p>1983 (<em>several things happened in 83 and 84 that moved things in a much better direction, including completely radical cap/CBA and how much several new stars cared/tried: Bird, Magic, Isiah, MJ</em>),</p></li>

<li><p>1987, 1995 (<em>this is when real shifts occurred in how 3-pt shooting was used</em>)</p></li>

<li><p>1992 (<em>right around 92-93 several things happened that dropped talent, focus, and seriousness in the league, causing huge drop in the product for about a decade</em>)</p></li>

At least in baseball, you can look at WAR and OPS+ which give a decent picture of just how dominant a player was in their era. The whole idea of comparing players is really dumb unless they were peers.</p>

      <label for="lkufx59" class="commentText"><p>Meh. Hockey hasn’t changed that much. Baseball hasn’t changed that much. Soccer hasn’t changed that much. Tennis hasn’t changed that much. You can’t even compare basketball eras because of the massive changes to defensive rules and the addition of the three-pointer. I’ll give you the football angle, but we can still have an intellectual conversation comparing Dan Marino to Tom Brady. It’s impossible to compare the Oscar Roberson era to even the Allen Iverson era, much less today’s NBA. People genuinely struggle to picture LeBron playing in the Jordan era or Wilt playing today.</p>

      <label for="lkv7i6r" class="commentText"><p>Forgive me, but I’m going to have a hard time taking you seriously when you exaggerate with things like my take on hockey being one of the worst sports takes ever. We have people on this sub advocating for Kobe Bryant being the most overrated player of all time or saying that LeBron James wouldn’t be successful in the 90s era of  basketball, but me saying hockey, which you yourself say is a different style across 25 years, hasn’t changed that much is the worst take you’ve ever heard. Let’s talk about styles. NBA basketball: the 60s and 70s compared to the 80s. The 80s compared to the 90s. The 90s compared to the 2000s and then compared to now. We’re talking very different and distinct eras of basketball that are nearly impossible to compare with each other. When people try to compare the players from those eras, it turns into bitter, spirited debate. We see it on this sub all the time. The other sports subs aren’t filled with this level of era debate vitriol. That’s my entire point and I feel like people are  just splitting hairs here to argue with a stranger on the Internet.</p>

<p>A better analogy would be trying to compare Tom Brady to Fran Tarkenton or Joe Namath</p>

<p>Also the Marino comp benefits from Marino feeling like a semi modern QB that’s been transported back in time (a similar thing is going on with Tarkenton too but not Namath)</p>

My point being, any NFL fan would agree that you could drop Jerry Rice, Barry Sanders, Joe Montana, etc. into any era of football and that they would be a superstar. Same logic for baseball with Nolan Ryan, Barry Bonds, Ricky Henderson, etc. NBA fans will fight you tooth and nail over a superstar being transported to another era of the NBA and still being a superstar. You don’t see that level of divisive debate with the other sports among their respective eras.</p>

With today’s quarterback friendly rules and the focus on building from the offensive line out, any of the old school successful quarterbacks would continue to be successful in today’s game. Oscar Robertson played during a time where he was dominating 5‘10“ white guys. That doesn’t necessarily translate to today’s NBA and always leads to a spirited debate amongst NBA fans.</p>

Fucking hell, Gardner Minshew has been somewhat successful as a starter in today’s league. You really think Terry Bradshaw couldn’t throw a few touchdowns in his prime in today’s game?</p>

      <label for="lkvefas" class="commentText"><p>It’s not even just the game itself, but salary rules have changed so much that it’s impossible to truly compare title runs for different players. Free agency didn’t exist until 1988 and the 1998 holdout completely changed everything about how the salary cap works. It used to be if you drafted a whole bunch of great players you could keep them pretty much as long as you wanted to, obviously now you can’t. Comparing title runs and even regular season win totals is totally different because of that.</p>

      <label for="lkueiok" class="commentText"><p>Well. The difference in the game between 68 and 75 is lower than between 2011 and 2015.
Same with per 3pt and post.</p>

<p>I think this is bad partition.</p>

<p>Better would be pre ABA.
ABA till 3pt line.
3pt till 91
91-99

<p>It&rsquo;s like the neatest little bow you could put between 80s-90s but I guess OP didn&rsquo;t have any more room for explanation.</p>

      <label for="lkut8rl" class="commentText"><p>Judging NBA seasons by decades is an arbitrary way to assess the league’s history. The start and end of a decade don’t align with the careers of players, team dynamics, or significant rule changes, making it a somewhat artificial way to evaluate trends or shifts in the game. More meaningful analysis would focus on specific eras defined by key players, teams, or historical events that shaped the league, rather than simply dividing history into ten-year chunks.</p>
