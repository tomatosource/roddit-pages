      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1d6kxjp/horford_rest_factor/"><p>Horford Rest Factor</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>As much as KP coming back excites me, Horford entering these finals having played so few minutes is almost as big of a deal in my opinion.</p>

<p>Horford entering 2022 finals - 624 playoff minutes</p>

<p>Horford 2023 playoffs - 617 playoff minutes</p>

<p>Horford 2024 playoffs - 425 playoff minutes</p>

<p>And the CF is the most grueling series as the games are all every other day, whereas the finals mostly have two days off in between each game.</p>

<p>Those nearly 200 fewer minutes played than through 2022 CF are huge.</p>

<p>Only 3 days off between end of Heat and beginning of Warriors series in 2022 vs 9 days off between series this year. That&rsquo;s massive.</p>

<p>And Celtics rested Al 4 of the last 5 games of the regular season. Which we didn&rsquo;t do in 2022. Al played 5 of the last 6 games that season.</p>

      <label for="l6t4qpm" class="commentText"><p>Both teams will have the advantage of lots of rest before the Finals. I <em>think</em> that benefits us more, since the Mavs aren&rsquo;t relying on anyone as old as Horford and it gives KP more time to ramp up and get back into game shape, but it also gives Luka, Lively, and Kleber time to recover from their respective injuries. We&rsquo;ll see whether it matters</p>

<p>Regardless, here&rsquo;s hoping this Finals series is the healthiest either of these teams have been thus far. I&rsquo;m so sick of running through teams with injuries that we would&rsquo;ve beaten completely healthy</p>

      <label for="l6ta6ww" class="commentText"><p>Both teams will have rested this is true.</p>

<p>But Mavs played 17 playoff games and played 3 days longer in the CF.</p>

<p>Also I don’t think any of their starters will benefit from the rest as much as an older guy like Horford.</p>

<p>The combo of low minutes to this point and the big layoff between series is huge.</p>

      <label for="l6tg308" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s arguable that Luka could be the biggest beneficiary as he&rsquo;s been playing with injury and he carries such a heavy load in games that he almost has no chance to really recover too much as long as Mavs are playing games. Horford is old but he&rsquo;s also realistically the Celtics 6th best/most important player so it might be less of a swing factor than Luka being able to rest. The difference between 80% Luka and 100% Luka probably affects the Mavs chances of winning more than the Celtics and the difference between 40% Horford and 100% Horford but that&rsquo;s just my guess and those numbers are pretty arbitrarily chosen by me.</p>

<p>But yeah, I don&rsquo;t think anyone can really know for sure who&rsquo;s benefitting the most and since both teams will have pretty comparable periods to rest, we should really see both teams at close to their max abilities.</p>

      <label for="l6tgfd2" class="commentText"><p>All of that’s fair. My original post really wasn’t meant to be a Celtics rest vs Mavs rest discussion but it headed that way.</p>

<p>I was more commenting about how Horford playing so few minutes and getting so much rest might be as big for the Celtics as KP’s return.</p>
