      <label for="l6igf4x" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a messy situation in something like that. It&rsquo;s more than just the scenario seems, it takes money to maintain/build the infrastructure for the utility. </p>

<p>If it was allowed to share utilities like that, the utilities would be losing money. The bill is more than just your usage, there&rsquo;s standard fees for even having the service to support the infrastructure. If a bunch of homes started sharing, utilities would have to raise fees to compensate. It&rsquo;s easier to just bar sharing utilities. I know personally my water bill is around $50 a month, and the actual usage piece is maybe a few dollars of that.</p>

<p>$400 to reconnect sounds steep, and being disconnected in the first place seems awfully harsh. Assuming they never got a warning or were told hey we understand the situation but you can&rsquo;t do that. So I don&rsquo;t know if they threw the book at them immediately or gave them a warning.</p>

<p>Technically, in most places within city limits if there are no utilities active you cant even stay in the house regardless. So truly I get it, it&rsquo;s a tough situation between helping somebody in need and following the rules that are there for a good reason. They just helped them in a way they weren&rsquo;t allowed to. Might have been better to reach out to support organizes, churches, and etc looking for any financial support available given their circumstances to get the water paid.</p>

<p>Your summation isn&rsquo;t at all what I said. Without everybody paying their part, the services wouldn&rsquo;t be able to be provided in the first place. Only one person in a neighborhood could have a service then provide that to everybody else and the money wouldn&rsquo;t be available to keep the infrastructure going. That&rsquo;s the whole point.</p>

<p>Nah it definitely is. In my country I could get as much water as I want from my neighbour and no one would bat an eye. In fact I do. When we moved in they allowed us to use their faucet in the garden to water ours, because we don&rsquo;t have one. Doing it for two years now. Stuff like this does not happen at a scale that actually has a big negative impact</p>

      <label for="l6jgzya" class="commentText"><p>Because utilities are normally considered so necessary for a citizen&rsquo;s well-being that they must be provided (for a fee). Utilities are also not normally profitable, so in order to make money, a free market would charge people way more than most would consider acceptable.</p>

<p>Example: My current electricity bill is around <span class="math inline">\(100 on average a month. That is barely profitable and would be unacceptable to a public company who has shareholders. Because I need electricity I would be willing to pay say... \)</span>1000 a month. Having it be a government- allowed monopoly I get electricity for $900 cheaper.</p>

<p>Also, creating and maintaining infrastructure is stupid expensive. It is absolutely a bad business to try to set up. So how did the government get electricity to everyone (more or less) even incredibly rural areas? By promising them a monopoly with some regulations. You can argue this is basically a government-run business with extra steps and there is some truth to this.</p>

Or will you just need to dig up pipes and put in new ones to it connects to a new companies plant when you change service providers? Same with power. Is there just going to be like 30 power lines for each company running down each street?</p>

<p>Most utilities need to be provided by a single entity operating and maintaining infrastructure. Unfortunately, too many voters don&rsquo;t want to see a higher tax bill so they vote against public utilities, or don&rsquo;t vote for politicians pushing it, even though it would be cheaper for states to run these services.</p>

Forcing people to use one company isn&rsquo;t free market. Making it illegal to collect rain water isn&rsquo;t free market. If you&rsquo;re going to cut people&rsquo;s water off for non payment then don&rsquo;t penalize them for getting it a different way.</p>

      <label for="l6j56re" class="commentText"><p>This has to vary based on state and region. I know in some places in the Midwest, like Iowa, you can live in a house without water access even within &ldquo;city&rdquo; limits because the laws there allow it and there&rsquo;s also no legal definition for a city. Seriously ,100 people live in one area? It&rsquo;s a city! Additionally, I think there needs to be some clarification if the water company is a private or public utility, and what laws involve each based on the state. In many cases there would be a lot more scrutiny against a public utility involved in this situation than a private one, although exceptions exist like Mississippi.</p>

      <label for="l6j4xwh" class="commentText"><p>No excuses. Netflix figured out how to make people stop sharing without fining them. Utilities companies should think outside the box too. Like, maybe a standard fee, with the potential of discounts or even credits to your account for using less than the average person. If my utility discount was gonna be fucked up from helping my neighbors, I&rsquo;d certainly think twice. That&rsquo;s just one POSSIBLE solution that took 3 seconds to draft in my head. Imagine what the executives at a utilities company could come up with if they spent a day thinking about it&hellip;</p>

<p>I expected it would be something like that. Getting some water from a hose is a lot different than connecting that hose up to your whole home.</p>

<p>I sympathize with the dude, but you gotta know that&rsquo;s not gonna fly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He noted that Spirit Lake charges just a $15 flat monthly fee per residence for water service</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fuck that&rsquo;s cheap anyway. I&rsquo;d just help the dude out and give him $15 if that were the case. I&rsquo;m pretty sure there&rsquo;s government programs specifically in place to help people who can&rsquo;t afford utilities anyway.</p>

<p>Nonpayment guy from the story was probably a lot farther behind than $15. But yeah, that is cheap as chips. 12k gallons a month is enough for four or five people at the national average.</p>

<li>Letting someone use your hose is ok.</li>
<li>Connecting your house water supply directly to their house is a bit more problematic since people generally aren’t allowed make their own infrastructure to service 3rd parties as a reseller (or gifting).</li>
</ol>

<p>The receiver isn’t going to get good water pressure, but nothing in the pipes prevents connecting the outside faucets on two house together and letting one house pressurize the other. (You can also do this with electricity and a “devil” extension cord).</p>

<p>I’m going to guess this is what was actually done here. The guy had his water turned off because he owed the city money, and this “generous” person was helping them skirt the debt.</p>

<p>Here is one similar case <a href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2014/aug/13/man-fined-500-for-sharing-city-water-with/" target="_blank">https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2014/aug/13/man-fined-500-for-sharing-city-water-with/</a></p>

<pre><code>The Spirit Lake city ordinance makes it “unlawful” for anyone to tamper with city water connections or connect or deliver water from them to any property not provided with city water service.

<p>Cops showed up&hellip;and cut the water with your local utilities dept? Because a neighbor used your hose? That&rsquo;s a first, &amp; I find very hard to believe.

They don&rsquo;t have that authority, and also would have to have a probable cause to even get involved.

<p>It’s not just letting someone use their hose, but using a hose to connect two taps to pressurize the pipes of the second house.</p>

<p>Technically this sort of trick would work with electricity and a “devils” extension cord ⚡️ . But either is going to run afoul of abusing the city infrastructure and building(?) codes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Spirit Lake man lost a court appeal challenging a fine he received for connecting his neighbor to his city water service via a hose, after the neighbor had been cut off for nonpayment.</p>

<p>Michael Freitas claimed that the city couldn’t constitutionally bar him from making a charitable gift of the water to his neighbor by running a hose across the alley. But the Idaho Court of Appeals, in a unanimous decision, upheld an earlier Kootenai County jury verdict that left Freitas with a $500 fine.</p>

<p>People make shit up all the time on social media, for nothing more than clicks, interaction, or shits and giggles. It&rsquo;s just what a lot of people do.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s either more to this story, or she made it up, because I highly doubt simply sharing some water from the hose lead to that. Now, if he hooked their hose up to something and was using it to feed the whole house somehow, that&rsquo;s different.</p>

<p>they want simple minded thugs to threaten the citizens</p>

<p>remember when the cops dragged a doctor off of a plane to make room for airline employees? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_United_Express_passenger_removal" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_United_Express_passenger_removal</a></p>

      <label for="l6jex83" class="commentText"><p>Bro there has to be more to the story.</p>

<p>Do you really think the cops found out by themselves, found the the lady guilty without going through court, and then shut off the water themselves?</p>

<p>The municipal court, cops, water dept, and utility company all came to the same decision, they wouldn&rsquo;t bother if it was just letting a little old dude take a shower and have a drink. They were probably pressurizing the house using a hose. </p>

Was it the water company going &ldquo;Huh, this guy suspiciously hasn&rsquo;t died of dehydration yet. Let&rsquo;s send someone to investigate?&rdquo; or was it some Karen going &ldquo;Look at that self righteous woman sharing that water with a person in need. I bet she&rsquo;s doing it to make me look bad because I&rsquo;m not sharing my water. I&rsquo;m going to put a stop to this!&rdquo;</p>
