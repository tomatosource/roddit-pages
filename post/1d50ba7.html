      <label for="l6igf4x" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a messy situation in something like that. It&rsquo;s more than just the scenario seems, it takes money to maintain/build the infrastructure for the utility. </p>

<p>If it was allowed to share utilities like that, the utilities would be losing money. The bill is more than just your usage, there&rsquo;s standard fees for even having the service to support the infrastructure. If a bunch of homes started sharing, utilities would have to raise fees to compensate. It&rsquo;s easier to just bar sharing utilities. I know personally my water bill is around $50 a month, and the actual usage piece is maybe a few dollars of that.</p>

<p>$400 to reconnect sounds steep, and being disconnected in the first place seems awfully harsh. Assuming they never got a warning or were told hey we understand the situation but you can&rsquo;t do that. So I don&rsquo;t know if they threw the book at them immediately or gave them a warning.</p>

<p>Technically, in most places within city limits if there are no utilities active you cant even stay in the house regardless. So truly I get it, it&rsquo;s a tough situation between helping somebody in need and following the rules that are there for a good reason. They just helped them in a way they weren&rsquo;t allowed to. Might have been better to reach out to support organizes, churches, and etc looking for any financial support available given their circumstances to get the water paid.</p>

They&rsquo;re applying the costs inefficiently in a way that tends to result more in company profits than doing so directly on metered use because the connection fees are more abstract.</p>

<p>The perspective you&rsquo;ve learned is the perspective of corporate profits, not reality. The mechanism that captured you is also pretty much how public regulators get captured. You&rsquo;ve accepted a company position at face value because nobody provided you the alternative that&rsquo;s good for the people and not the shareholders.</p>

<p>Your summation isn&rsquo;t at all what I said. Without everybody paying their part, the services wouldn&rsquo;t be able to be provided in the first place. Only one person in a neighborhood could have a service then provide that to everybody else and the money wouldn&rsquo;t be available to keep the infrastructure going.

<p>Nah it definitely is. In my country I could get as much water as I want from my neighbour and no one would bat an eye. In fact I do. When we moved in they allowed us to use their faucet in the garden to water ours, because we don&rsquo;t have one. Doing it for two years now. Stuff like this does not happen at a scale that actually has a big negative impact</p>

<p>His argument was that since he wasn&rsquo;t selling the wheat (instead just using it to feed his animals), he didn&rsquo;t need to abide by the regulations since they were specifically targeting interstate commerce.</p>

<p>The court ruled against him, with the argument that him growing his own feed meant that he was buying less wheat from the market than he normally would, and so it was indirectly impacting the national wheat market.</p>

      <label for="l6jr3bq" class="commentText"><p>The size concern is valid. Nationalizing across the whole US would be a bigger undertaking then doing it across every country in europe combined.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reason that the national railroad system was such a milestone and yet still large swaths of the US even in the trains heyday were sometimes still 100s of miles away from a track.</p>

<p>Whereas it happens every single time such an entity is privatized, at least in the USA where what some whiners call &ldquo;strict regulation&rdquo; is more like a set of loose moral guidelines.</p>

As you said one person doing this won&rsquo;t change anything, but a law has to exist in the books to prevent people from doing this for reasons stated elsewhere in this thread. For rule of law to exist laws must be enforced for everyone, this is just an unfortunate consequence of that. Anyways, its also obviously not illegal to give a poor person water, just kinda inconvenient.</p>

      <label for="l6jteqq" class="commentText"><p>Not the person you responded to, but I can shed a bit more light on it besides just &ldquo;money&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Having a 3rd party &ldquo;purveyor&rdquo; control the water between the regulated water distributor and the end user is a nightmare. Situations like what OP posted are not the reason the rules were made the way they are, it was the many bad situations that happened or could happen that created the rule. Two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>The situation in the post IS dangerous (not as dangerous as not having water). Hoses are not properly disinfected and pick up all kinds of nasty stuff. Fortunately when we drink out of the hose it is typically not a big deal because the water is fresh from the main and therefore chlorinated. However, if the mom daisy chained the hose to the neighbors hose bib (which is the common way of doing such things) then the water in the hose can sit stagnant, lose the chlorine residual, and become dangerous. For situations like OPs, having water is clearly safer than not having water and worth the risk to the receiving party. But for every situation like this there are situations of people who simply don&rsquo;t want to pay and are sharing with their neighbors, unknowingly creating a dangerous drinking water situation. So the rule is &lsquo;hey don&rsquo;t do that, we are going to punish you if you do&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Back in the wild wild west of water distribution systems, any ol&rsquo; yahoo could dig a well and create a water district to serve their community. The problem with this was there were bad actors who were only after profit. Dig a well, do zero testing, get 100 people in Podunk, Kansas to give you money for water, and profit. The provider didn&rsquo;t care if it had elevated arsenic. Or, just as common, was someone hooking up to a good water system and redistributing the water to their encampment (re: a mining town). Those went completely unregulated because the mining company was the end user. Eventually we wised up and created regulations for safe drinking water. Basically: &ldquo;Hey mine owner, you are operating a water distribution system. We are going to have to actually check that you aren&rsquo;t going to kill the people who are drinking from it.&rdquo; In the situation above, because the mom is redistributing the water, she is acting as a water purveyor. It was obviously not the explicit intent of the regulation, but at what point should water go unregulated? Redistributing to 100 people? 10? 1? As a result, the regulated water distributor has the rule, &lsquo;hey don&rsquo;t do that, we are going to punish you if you do&rsquo;.</li>
</ol>

<p>On a side note, I don&rsquo;t think water should be shut off to an occupied home. But hey, I&rsquo;m not in charge. To the people who argue, &ldquo;well then nobody will pay for water!&rdquo;: I don&rsquo;t have all the answers. I just know that creating a situation that could result in death over a few hundred dollars seems like a solvable problem in our current society.</p>

<p>But the original comment actually went on to explain the problem of what happens when that isn&rsquo;t the case. The cost of utilities would go up and now you&rsquo;re also tied together with your neighbors so if one of them isn&rsquo;t paying everybody is fucked.</p>

<p>I literally work with water utilities for a living and have to help them set their rates and work on where their money is going etc.</p>

<p>Most water offices are either non-profit, barely make a profit, or absolutely lose their butts. Water offices are almost certainly <em>not</em> making some great profit, they are not trying to milk you dry like internet companies and phone companies etc are</p>

<p>Water offices are usually ran on shoe string budgets and have several charges on each of their rates.</p>

<ul>
<li>Base rate -&amp;gt; This is usually your flat rate regardless of whether you use water. This usually covers water too, like <span class="math inline">\(40 flat and covers up to 3,000 gallons of water. Regardless of whether you use 0 gallons or 2,500 gallons, your bill is \)</span>40</li>
<li>Usage charges -&amp;gt; This is your charge for gallons over the minimum, usually something like $7 per thousand after the first 3,000 gallons etc</li>
<li>State fees -&amp;gt; These are your mandated state charges that are not going to your water office. Usually <span class="math inline">\(2-3, don't think I've ever seen one over \)</span>5</li>
<li>Taxes -&amp;gt; These are your city, county, state etc taxes, and again, are not going to the water office</li>
</ul>

<p>The water office is basically only charging you for the flat rate which covers the infrastructure, and charges you usage which is just going to cover the cost it costs them to buy or pump the water you are using</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve worked thousands of water offices, and I can literally think of like 1 water office that actually turned any real profit, and that was only because it was a privately run Hydroelectric company that was making most of the profit off the hydro electric side</p>

      <label for="l6j56re" class="commentText"><p>This has to vary based on state and region. I know in some places in the Midwest, like Iowa, you can live in a house without water access even within &ldquo;city&rdquo; limits because the laws there allow it and there&rsquo;s also no legal definition for a city. Seriously ,100 people live in one area? It&rsquo;s a city! Additionally, I think there needs to be some clarification if the water company is a private or public utility, and what laws involve each based on the state. In many cases there would be a lot more scrutiny against a public utility involved in this situation than a private one, although exceptions exist like Mississippi.</p>

It&rsquo;s not like they make it. So it&rsquo;s equipment, people, filtering, pipes etc etc and it all boild down to what? You rates.</p>

<p>Like, literally. My rate for exectricity is 4.38 a kilowatt for example. If I use two I&rsquo;ll pay twice of that. It&rsquo;s as fucking simple as that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>my water bill is around $50 a month, and the actual usage piece is maybe a few dollars of that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this is crazy. Is this some american thing? I&rsquo;m in EU and you <em>sometimes</em> have like a membership fee which is cents and then all else is the actual price of the actual thing you&rsquo;re buying.</p>

People in the US pay way lower taxes, but these utilities still need their costs subsidized, so the costs are bundled in here instead. You could totally argue it would be better just to play higher taxes to reduce complexity, but it can still be explained in its current state.</p>

You didn&rsquo;t maintain your property properly and ended up letting a lot of clean water to go into the sewer unnecessarily. They still have to treat the water even if you don&rsquo;t use it.

<p>Fuck that&rsquo;s cheap anyway. I&rsquo;d just help the dude out and give him $15 if that were the case. I&rsquo;m pretty sure there&rsquo;s government programs specifically in place to help people who can&rsquo;t afford utilities anyway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He noted that Spirit Lake charges just a <span class="math inline">\(15 flat monthly fee per residence for water service, which covers 12,000 gallons of water, plus another \)</span>1.25 for each additional 1,000 gallons used.&rdquo;</p>

<li>Letting someone use your hose is ok.</li>
<li>Connecting your house water supply directly to their house is a bit more problematic since people generally aren’t allowed make their own infrastructure to service 3rd parties as a reseller (or gifting).</li>
</ol>

<p>The receiver isn’t going to get good water pressure, but nothing in the pipes prevents connecting the outside faucets on two house together and letting one house pressurize the other. (You can also do this with electricity and a “devil” extension cord).</p>

<p>I’m going to guess this is what was actually done here. The guy had his water turned off because he owed the city money, and this “generous” person was helping them skirt the debt.</p>

<pre><code>The Spirit Lake city ordinance makes it “unlawful” for anyone to tamper with city water connections or connect or deliver water from them to any property not provided with city water service.

<p>Cops showed up&hellip;and cut the water with your local utilities dept? Because a neighbor used your hose? That&rsquo;s a first, &amp; I find very hard to believe. What municipality would support that? I also don&rsquo;t know any cops that would care because it&rsquo;s a civil matter. They don&rsquo;t have that authority, and also would have to have a probable cause to even get involved. Your utilities dept only shuts off your water if you don&rsquo;t pay&hellip;sorry but I think your 11 year old brain was misremembering.</p>

<p>It’s not just letting someone use their hose, but using a hose to connect two taps to pressurize the pipes of the second house.</p>

<p>Technically this sort of trick would work with electricity and a “devils” extension cord ⚡️ . But either is going to run afoul of abusing the city infrastructure and building(?) codes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Spirit Lake man lost a court appeal challenging a fine he received for connecting his neighbor to his city water service via a hose, after the neighbor had been cut off for nonpayment.</p>

<p>Michael Freitas claimed that the city couldn’t constitutionally bar him from making a charitable gift of the water to his neighbor by running a hose across the alley. But the Idaho Court of Appeals, in a unanimous decision, upheld an earlier Kootenai County jury verdict that left Freitas with a $500 fine.</p>

<p>The municipal court, cops, water dept, and utility company all came to the same decision, they wouldn&rsquo;t bother if it was just letting a little old dude take a shower and have a drink. They were probably pressurizing the house using a hose. </p>
