<p>additional fun ornithological facts: Bird in his rookie year came 4th in MVP with 15 first place votes and the Celtics went from a 29-53 the previous season to 61-21, before losing in the ECF to the Sixers</p>

Take a team that made the finals twice in the past 3 years and add an all-time great player who led his own team to the finals nearly by himself and you get a squad that swept the Showtime Lakers. In 3 playoff series, they lost a single game. Moses Malone averaged 26 points, 16 rebounds, and 3 and half stocks.</p>

<p>Because of the hate (he deserved) he is receiving, people will lean on Timmy, Dirk, KG, And even Current Giannis better than him.</p>

<p>Even Karl VS Chuck is a huge debate today.</p>

<p>Some people are not even considering him as the best Malone. (Some argue Moses is the best Malone).</p>

<p>15-20 years ago we didn’t know/care about Karl’s abhorrent behavior, most ranked Moses higher because Karl was a huge choker.</p>

<p>Edit: Bill Simmons put Karl at #22 and Moses at #15 all-time in 2008 and didn&rsquo;t mention anything off the floor.</p>

      <label for="llboeey" class="commentText"><p>We are forgetting that he was in a historically good situation for a player like him and that Stockton hit a ton of big baskets (despite usually being the passer) and Malone came up small in big moments.</p>

<p>In game 6 in &lsquo;98, the last dance, when MJ steals the ball from him leading to the shot Karl is just standing with the ball, looking at nothing in particular.  Stockton had just hit a three to give the Jazz the lead.  Stockton hit a buzzer beater in &lsquo;96 to send the Jazz to the conference finals, the buzzer beater over Barkley to send em to the finals, Stockton has as many clutch shots as anybody in the history of the game, Malone, despite 40k points, doesn&rsquo;t have shit.</p>

<p>We forgot that Malone choked hard pretty much every time, we forgot that he had one of the greatest point guards feeding him his whole career, we forgot he had a great shot blocker behind him for the first few seasons (Eaton) and another great shooter and secondary ball handler (Hornacek), a bunch of solid wings (Russell, Benjamin, Anderson) and all the continuity with his pg and coach anybody could hope for.</p>

<p>I always expected him to become overrated as the context is forgotten and the lionization of MJ continues, it&rsquo;s just a bummer that he isn&rsquo;t dinged <em>at all</em> for being a shitty person.</p>

<p>I think Moses is an interesting point given he is quite accomplished, yet he is not heavily debated as one of the best. I guess this is what happens over time. If you are not #1 during your time, it just won’t carry to other generations.</p>

<p>Karl Malone was not better than any of the guys you named.  Of course Giannis is better, how is this even a question?  I&rsquo;m just gonna assume you aren&rsquo;t old enough to have watched Malone and Stockton play, it wasn&rsquo;t as impressive or dominant as any of those other guys.  It just wasn&rsquo;t as impactful.</p>

People joke about being a hater of certain star players, but he is one of the very few players I legitimately hate. I&rsquo;m glad joining a stacked Lakers team didn&rsquo;t get him a ring. MJ keeping him from a ring is really cool, too. Not having a ring also makes it harder to move him to the all-time list.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to nerd about stats on bball-ref and give him his spot in history, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with making arguments for him when discussing best power forwards in history or whatever. It&rsquo;s quite another thing to give the person any attention today.</p>

<p>The dude should never have had a career in the first place after getting a 12 year old pregnant, no way that would have flown today. It&rsquo;s not like he paid his dues either, he never apologised or took any responsibility. He also treated Vanessa like shit and was a cunt all around.</p>

<p>[EDIT] : Since I&rsquo;m already getting downvoted, let me clarify my point. I&rsquo;m refering to the fact that Kobe is a self-admitted rapist and not just to the fact that someone pressed charges against him.</p>

<p>Kobe wrote in his public letter after the cancellation of the criminal case : &ldquo;I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A non-consensual sexual intercourse is a rape.</p>

<p>I have a hard time understanding why there is some people around there hating Karl Malone (for good reason tbf) but idolizing a self-admitted rapist at the same time.</p>

      <label for="lldrf9o" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s not admitting to rape, it&rsquo;s admitting that he believes the woman is sincere in her accusation, just mistaken. Anthony Rapp accused Kevin Spacey of attempted rape, and he was obviously sincere, but Spacey was able to prove it never happened.</p>

<p>The sex began consensually by both accounts, her account is that Kobe got too rough and she said to stop and he didnt. It&rsquo;s completely understandable people dont consider that comparable to raping a 12 year old.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a huge ulterior motive (7 figures) to accuse a celebrity of rape (look at Trevor Bauer, baseballer who was extorted by a false accuser), so a higher standard of evidence is required. He would almost certainly not have been convicted in a criminal trial.</p>

      <label for="llbr7fo" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve always thought Karl Malone was considered the second best PF in history after Duncan.</p>

<p>I would also argue Karl is not the best Malone. Moses is probably the most underrated player in NBA history. I think there are 2 reasons for this. His only title was on the 76ers which was considered to be Erving&rsquo;s team even though Malone won the finals MVP averaging 25.8 PPG and 18 RPG. He played for a long time and people seem to remember him from his Hawks days and on.</p>

      <label for="llbsm9z" class="commentText"><p>When I, someone who never saw him play, put the hate aside and think about &ldquo;Karl Malone the player,&rdquo; I think of him as a fantastic, potentially top 15 all time, regular season player. Again, if we&rsquo;re totally ignoring what a monster he is, the biggest thing that harms his legacy is his postseason career. I&rsquo;m not even talking about losing in the Finals, there&rsquo;s no shame in losing to the 90&rsquo;s Bulls, I&rsquo;m more talking about the fact that the Jazz had a whole lot of first round exits. The fact that, year in, year out, they are a great team, but they keep having these playoff flubs, in my opinion, really hurts him. His performance also got noticeably worse in the postseason, as his production would stay largely the same, but his shooting percentages would drop significantly. Personally, I think it&rsquo;s telling that, for as good as the 97 Jazz were, they hadn&rsquo;t made the finals during/after either of MJ&rsquo;s retirements.</p>

      <label for="llds46r" class="commentText"><p>Even without any off-court issues, Karl Malone never won a ring in significant part because of his own playoff choking. The Jazz have the 4th highest win/loss all time but only 2 finals appearances and 0 championships, and that&rsquo;s not a coincidence. All the other players you mentioned except Chuck have a finals MVP (3, in Duncan&rsquo;s case). I think it&rsquo;s reasonable for Malone and Barkley to be in contention for 5th PF all-time.</p>

I mean it’s fair to have healthy discourse about Duncan’s overall ranking and career but this guy is on a mission to undermine and discredit how great of a player Tim Duncan was. He’s the GOAT PF and it’s nearly a consensus on that fact. KG &amp; Dirk were absolutely amazing and we were spoiled to have all 3 competing in the West up until 2007. With that being said, Duncan was 100% deserving on his 1st Team selections and saying KG and Dirk should have been the forwards selected on the majority of those 1st Teams is absurd.</p>

      <label for="lle7w4h" class="commentText"><p>Duncan was a poor choice for the 2004, 2005 and 2007 selections as well as 98. Lebron and KG deserved those more in the 2000s. And Grant Hill in 1998.</p>
