      <label for="l6gyxi5" class="commentText"><p>Pretty anticlimactic ending to what turned out to be a rather anticlimactic series. The Nuggets series showed us what the Wolves can be when everything&rsquo;s clicking, but between this series and the 3 game slide in that series, it&rsquo;s clear they&rsquo;ve still got some stuff to figure out with respect to consistency, especially on the offensive end. Obviously Luka popping off as he did to start off wasn&rsquo;t ideal, but the reason the lead felt as insurmountable at the half as it did was because of their offense, not their defense.</p>

<p>Ultimately, though, definitely feel like this has to count as a successful season for the Timberwolves, even if it might not feel like it at the moment. He&rsquo;s not quite there yet, but Ant 100% is going to end up being a perennial MVP candidate at some point IMO, and they showed that this core is capable of making a deep run, even against quality competition. Sustaining it is obviously a separate matter that&rsquo;s easier said than done, but we can&rsquo;t say anything about that till this time next year comes around.</p>

      <label for="l6h0mse" class="commentText"><p>Good thoughts.</p>

<p>If the Timberwolves were built to beat the former Champ Nuggs, it also looks like the Mavs were remade to beat the Timberwolves come trade deadline.   This wasn&rsquo;t the same team.  Namely due to what their now two massive rim protectors and offensive finishers showed.   Nobody talks about them, but they stopped Timber&rsquo;s attempts to run things so much through their couple bigs.  Finch&rsquo;s decision to run so much through Gobert early in game 5 was maybe not a great call given what the two Mavs bigs had been showing. Maybe he thought Lively wouldn&rsquo;t be back healthy enough, but&hellip;</p>

<p>I think Lively shot 100% this series.  Nobody talking about this?</p>

<p>I always see Gobert 1 foot from the rim with ball and can&rsquo;t fathom how he can&rsquo;t finish.  But there were two monsters playing defense for Mavs.   Well, between Gobert and Towns they couldn&rsquo;t stop Lively or Gafford at all or near the rate they were shut down at the rim.  They played perfect all series.  One of them is a rookie.</p>

      <label for="l6h07f1" class="commentText"><p>It really is a thing of beauty to just watch Luka and Kyrie just absolutely deconstruct a defensive scheme with no counterpunch or adjustment from Finch and company.</p>

<p>Finch is too good of a coach to just absolutely rollover the way the Timberwolves did.</p>

      <label for="l6h0xmg" class="commentText"><p>The Timberwolves essentially lost this series in the first two games, especially in Game 2 when they had an 18 point lead in the third quarter. Winning one of those gives you cover in a game like this where, let&rsquo;s be honest very few teams would&rsquo;ve beaten the Mavs with Kyrie and Luka playing that well.</p>

<p>The Timberwolves remain a factor as long as Ant continues his development and management continues to build around him. The Mavs, meanwhile should give the Celtics a run for their money and could potentially beat them with the tandem of Kyrie/Luka plus Derek Lively doing his thing at both ends.</p>

<p>But we have to be honest,  the best offensive backcourt made him look like a joke throughout this series.</p>

      </div>
      <label for="l6h23nw" class="commentText"><p>Not much to really say. This felt like the first LeBronto closeout game where the best player made some wild shots to start and kept on pouring it on alongside a Kyrie Irving.</p>

<p>Luka and Kyrie both put on an absolute clinic like they have been doing all season long and the Wolves got trounced. Practically the entire 2nd half the Mavs were shooting standing 3-pointers with how well Luka was able to exploit the Wolves blitzing and the game was well over by that point.</p>

<p>Ant and KAT got it going at last but the Wolves suffered heavily from McDaniels&rsquo; foul trouble that had him play just 11 minutes before his 5th foul and an awful lack of spacing killed them in the end. The first couple games the Wolves made it close because their role players had it going, now their shooting froze and it was the end.</p>

<p>Plenty of great things to say about the Wolves season obviously, they were built to match up against the reigning champs well as many perceived before the season began and they showed their mettle with an impressive sweep over the Suns and a triumphant 7-game series against the defending champ Nuggets. But the Mavs were a terrible matchup for them and really, their best players did not consistently deliver whilst their lack of creativity of offense got constantly punished by the Mavs&rsquo; ability to protect the rim which was an area of concern all season long. And in the end they also started piling up way too much foul trouble to truly sustain a period of excellence for an entire playoff run.</p>

<p>This only trails their 2004 season in playoff success, and for a relatively inexperienced team (despite a good number of veterans) they definitely surpassed expectations. Their defense was a joy to watch, but their stagnant offense and a lack of a go-to action caught up to them.</p>

<p>In regards to the offseason, getting a secondary (or primary) playmaker next to Mike Conley should be their plan A. Kyle Anderson is a free agent and Alexander-Walker is going to be an expiring, so there&rsquo;s some room for the Wolves to make good changes if they desire to. And they will be one of many teams in the west next year that&rsquo;ll be starving to replicate and one up their playoff success from this year, so that&rsquo;ll be certainly exiting.</p>

<p>Last but not least, huge congratulations to the Mavericks. They had a seriously injury-riddled stretch in the 1st half of the season that almost put them out of the playoff picture entirely, but they recuperated, added Gafford and Washington at the trade deadline and with Luka and Kyrie at the helm they&rsquo;re now in the Finals. Who would&rsquo;ve thought from a year ago when they were. And now we&rsquo;ll get Kyrie in Boston for the Finals and Luka&rsquo;s debutant Finals series against a juggernaut Celtics team.</p>

<p>Like many series this playoffs, this series wouldn&rsquo;t need much for the eventual outcome to be changed. They are both extremely formidable teams, but my pick is the Celtics in 6. This is quite the exciting matchup, a 7-day break without basketball is disappointing but fingers crossed the Finals is worth the wait.</p>
