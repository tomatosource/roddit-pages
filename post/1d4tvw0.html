      <label for="l6h7bbh" class="commentText"><p>Never would I have thought in October this team would be in the finals.</p>

<p>Luka and Kyrie are so goddamn good, and everyone on the team has been so instrumental, truly a full effort from everyone.</p>

<p>This is the most fun ive had watching sports in so long, hoping they can take it home but for now I’m just enjoying the fact they got back after losing to a euroleague team in the preseason.</p>

<p>Lively and PJ are my next jerseys too, so happy they’re here</p>

      <label for="l6hbj90" class="commentText"><p>Honestly I, like a lot of others, wrote the Mavs off and didn’t pay attention to them because Luka looked injured af to me and I assumed there was no way he was going to last as many games as he has. Mavs have stunned me after hearing how the Wolves and the Nuggets were the real contenders all season long. The crazy thing about Luka is that even though this is his first finals, he seems perfectly mentally prepared for it due to his experience. What was completely remarkable to me was how he and Kyrie don’t seem phased by anything even when the chips are down. You can see what a difference the mental game makes. They’ve had bad games, yes, but it never seems like those guys fold, ever.</p>

      <label for="l6imu73" class="commentText"><p>An underrated part of that is places like Germany which limit or put a cap on how high ticket prices are. It doesn’t price out fans.</p>

<p>now, that has led continental Euro leagues to get less revenue than the Prem and thus they’ve theoretically fallen behind, but maybe not by that much as, well, look at the champions league</p>

      <label for="l6ijf8d" class="commentText"><p>Luka is the best player in the league, far and away. He&rsquo;s the now and the future. I can&rsquo;t stand hearing about how great Ant Edwards is gonna be - the media already turned him for the worst, THEY made HIM image obsessed because they feed into it. Luka might be drawing detriment to his image but his playoff performance is LEGENDARY SO FAR.</p>

When I was hearing buzz about the Mavs that they had a good shot of making it to the finals (back in R2), I thought they were the least likely to make it because of how reliant they are on Luka, and he did seem pretty hobbled. Now here they are, looking as good as any team.</p>

      <label for="l6h07f1" class="commentText"><p>It really is a thing of beauty to just watch Luka and Kyrie just absolutely deconstruct a defensive scheme with no counterpunch or adjustment from Finch and company.</p>

<p>Finch is too good of a coach to just absolutely rollover the way the Timberwolves did.</p>

I think the Mavs just elevated while the Wolves shrinked, I do think it is something that critics of the Wolves were worried all year and it showed that series. But the Wolves have a blueprint and can get better without any moves, so there is hope to look for in the future.</p>

Acting like it was just a &lsquo;expected&rsquo; result because you are a worse team is just weird and comes from a result based thinking that is behind every hot take around here.</p>

      <label for="l6idc3g" class="commentText"><p>To be honest though if you were looking closely at the Nuggets vs Wolves series it wasn&rsquo;t too much of a shock the Wolves were setting up for a let down. I just didn&rsquo;t expect it to be the way it was.  To be honest both teams in the Nuggets vs Wolves series were.</p>

<p>You go up 2-0 on the opponent&rsquo;s floor only to come home and lose both games with one being a blow out and then allow the opponent to get up 3-2.  They were fortunate to be able to get the last two games, but in most cases that&rsquo;s a recipe for a collapse.</p>

<p>When they were hitting they looked super good, but they had serious problems with sustaining their performance.   Even in Game 7 Ant was not really playing at a super star level for most of the game.  It&rsquo;s just that Denver&rsquo;s supporting cast was also crapping the bed at the same time.</p>

<p>It just finally caught up with them.   Both the Wolves and Denver were showing problems in that series. If anything it seemed like both teams were trying their hardest to throw that series since they were taking turns looking like crap.</p>

<p>The Wolves had a lot of depth, but the stars were really up and down all series long.</p>

<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t shock me that the Mavs who have been playing great as of late were able to do what they did.  In the playoffs consistency is more important than having big highs.  The Wolves were just not consistent enough.</p>

      <label for="l6i7tqf" class="commentText"><p>What type of statement is that? The point of the best of seven series is to see who wins more and by definition the team who wins more is the better team, it’s like that in all sports. This was even admitted by Jokic in the nuggets wolves series, he admitted they’re the better team because they won best of seven. And that was close 4-3.
Mavs have a much better duo, much better defense, better offense and don protection, etc
Regardless I don’t want to argue with a a stranger on the internet bc I can tell by your question you don’t have common sense</p>

      <label for="l6ibgb9" class="commentText"><p>Because winning a series does not necessarily means one team is automatically better than the other. Last year&rsquo;s Heat is a great example, nobody would put them as the best of the East and they made the Finals.<br>
Matchups can have a greater effect, injuries can happen, I just think it is myopic to look at the result of a series and just be like &ldquo;this team is just better&rdquo;, it allows zero nuance and why even be in this thread then? You already know that one team is better than the other, god knows we already have 10 other threads to say that Gobert sucks on the frontpage, why do it here too.</p>

<p>Teams like the wolves will spazz out and they can’t lock back in. Mavericks have had tons of teams like this. Up until basically this year, the big knock was we couldn’t close. We made dumb, inexperienced team mistakes.</p>

      <label for="l6gyxi5" class="commentText"><p>Pretty anticlimactic ending to what turned out to be a rather anticlimactic series. The Nuggets series showed us what the Wolves can be when everything&rsquo;s clicking, but between this series and the 3 game slide in that series, it&rsquo;s clear they&rsquo;ve still got some stuff to figure out with respect to consistency, especially on the offensive end. Obviously Luka popping off as he did to start off wasn&rsquo;t ideal, but the reason the lead felt as insurmountable at the half as it did was because of their offense, not their defense.</p>

<p>Ultimately, though, definitely feel like this has to count as a successful season for the Timberwolves, even if it might not feel like it at the moment. He&rsquo;s not quite there yet, but Ant 100% is going to end up being a perennial MVP candidate at some point IMO, and they showed that this core is capable of making a deep run, even against quality competition. Sustaining it is obviously a separate matter that&rsquo;s easier said than done, but we can&rsquo;t say anything about that till this time next year comes around.</p>

      <label for="l6h0mse" class="commentText"><p>Good thoughts.</p>

<p>If the Timberwolves were built to beat the former Champ Nuggs, it also looks like the Mavs were remade to beat the Timberwolves come trade deadline.   This wasn&rsquo;t the same team.  Namely due to what their now two massive rim protectors and offensive finishers showed.   Nobody talks about them, but they stopped Timber&rsquo;s attempts to run things so much through their couple bigs.  Finch&rsquo;s decision to run so much through Gobert early in game 5 was maybe not a great call given what the two Mavs bigs had been showing. Maybe he thought Lively wouldn&rsquo;t be back healthy enough, but&hellip;</p>

<p>I think Lively shot 100% this series.  Nobody talking about this?</p>

<p>I always see Gobert 1 foot from the rim with ball and can&rsquo;t fathom how he can&rsquo;t finish.  But there were two monsters playing defense for Mavs.   Well, between Gobert and Towns they couldn&rsquo;t stop Lively or Gafford at all or near the rate they were shut down at the rim.  They played perfect all series.  One of them is a rookie.</p>

      <label for="l6j3he6" class="commentText"><p>In the third quarter they went hard on doubling Luka and the pace for the Mavs slowed. But once Luka subbed out and Kyrie came in the tempo kicked right back up. When they’re both in it’s a matter of choosing in what way they’re going to cook you.</p>

If the argument against Gobert is that it doesn&rsquo;t matter how good his defense is when his offense is that bad and there wouldn&rsquo;t be that much to counter it because it is a choice to be made by the coach.<br>
But discrediting his defense just because generational offensive players showed why they are generational is too much and it is what happens around here.</p>

Then add in the other shit they asked of him and it wasn&rsquo;t really all that fair of an ask even from a great defender.</p>

<p>That said, Lively going <sup>16</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> from the field in the series is not a great look for him as an elite rim protector.</p>

      <label for="l6hbp3w" class="commentText"><p>He just isn&rsquo;t quick. The previous 2 series he was playing catchup defensively so much because opposing bigs are more nimble and quick offensively than he is defensively.</p>

<p>Go back to the Nuggets series and see just how often he was trailing the play because Jokic is so much quicker at getting to the 3-point line to set pindowns. Or go back to Game 1 of this series where he like every Wolves big was so slow at getting up on the screen that people legitimately thought the Wolves&rsquo; gameplan was to play drop coverage on Luka and Mike Conley had to explicitly state that wasn&rsquo;t the plan. Or go back to literally any play where Luka and Kyrie have him on an island defensively, which admittedly is less his fault and more elite offense. He&rsquo;s just not quick enough to be able to consistently and quickly react to actions set on the perimeter.</p>

<p>There were other issues of course but that was it. He&rsquo;s definitely a thoroughly deserving DPOY (in the end, it&rsquo;s a regular season award anyway) but given how formidable the Wolves&rsquo; perimeter defense was it&rsquo;s hard not to say he didn&rsquo;t perform up to standards defensively.</p>

Winning one of those gives you cover in a game like this where, let&rsquo;s be honest very few teams would&rsquo;ve beaten the Mavs with Kyrie and Luka playing that well. The Timberwolves remain a factor as long as Ant continues his development and management continues to build around him. The Mavs, meanwhile should give the Celtics a run for their money and could potentially beat them with the tandem of Kyrie/Luka plus Derek Lively doing his thing at both ends.</p>

<p> You mean the Mavs won those first few games? There&rsquo;s a reason they&rsquo;re considered the most clutch team in basketball right now. In the final minutes of close games they make all the right decisions, and there&rsquo;s a huge sample size there.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m probably being pedantic, but I hate how it&rsquo;s always &ldquo;what the wolves did wrong&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;what the Mavs did right&rdquo;.</p>

      <label for="l6ivto1" class="commentText"><p>I said in the game thread last night, the Wolves might want to hire Hakeem to coach up Rudy in the off season. Given the ample opportunities he gets in every game because he&rsquo;s such a liability on offense, developing some level of feetwork would be huge for Rudy, as well as the evasive fakes that Dream was known for.</p>

<p>He just seems so uncomfortable with the ball in hand, keeps everything inside his body and has a poor base to get around. Even the few euro steps he&rsquo;s done over the past 3-4 games, it looks like he&rsquo;s barely stepping/extending outside of his frame. When he goes up for a layup/shot, he stays completely rigid and goes UP but never tries to bring the ball in at an angle.</p>

<p>This will probably fall on deaf ears cuz dude is making 40m/yr and he doesn&rsquo;t need to do anything besides what he has been doing, which is defense.</p>

      <label for="l6h23nw" class="commentText"><p>Not much to really say. This felt like the first LeBronto closeout game where the best player made some wild shots to start and kept on pouring it on alongside a Kyrie Irving.</p>

<p>Luka and Kyrie both put on an absolute clinic like they have been doing all season long and the Wolves got trounced. Practically the entire 2nd half the Mavs were shooting standing 3-pointers with how well Luka was able to exploit the Wolves blitzing and the game was well over by that point.</p>

<p>Ant and KAT got it going at last but the Wolves suffered heavily from McDaniels&rsquo; foul trouble that had him play just 11 minutes before his 5th foul and an awful lack of spacing killed them in the end. The first couple games the Wolves made it close because their role players had it going, now their shooting froze and it was the end.</p>

<p>Plenty of great things to say about the Wolves season obviously, they were built to match up against the reigning champs well as many perceived before the season began and they showed their mettle with an impressive sweep over the Suns and a triumphant 7-game series against the defending champ Nuggets. But the Mavs were a terrible matchup for them and really, their best players did not consistently deliver whilst their lack of creativity of offense got constantly punished by the Mavs&rsquo; ability to protect the rim which was an area of concern all season long. And in the end they also started piling up way too much foul trouble to truly sustain a period of excellence for an entire playoff run.</p>

<p>This only trails their 2004 season in playoff success, and for a relatively inexperienced team (despite a good number of veterans) they definitely surpassed expectations. Their defense was a joy to watch, but their stagnant offense and a lack of a go-to action caught up to them.</p>

<p>In regards to the offseason, getting a secondary (or primary) playmaker next to Mike Conley should be their plan A. Kyle Anderson is a free agent and Alexander-Walker is going to be an expiring, so there&rsquo;s some room for the Wolves to make good changes if they desire to. And they will be one of many teams in the west next year that&rsquo;ll be starving to replicate and one up their playoff success from this year, so that&rsquo;ll be certainly exiting.</p>

<p>Last but not least, huge congratulations to the Mavericks. They had a seriously injury-riddled stretch in the 1st half of the season that almost put them out of the playoff picture entirely, but they recuperated, added Gafford and Washington at the trade deadline and with Luka and Kyrie at the helm they&rsquo;re now in the Finals. Who would&rsquo;ve thought from a year ago when they were. And now we&rsquo;ll get Kyrie in Boston for the Finals and Luka&rsquo;s debutant Finals series against a juggernaut Celtics team.</p>

<p>Like many series this playoffs, this series wouldn&rsquo;t need much for the eventual outcome to be changed. They are both extremely formidable teams, but my pick is the Celtics in 6. This is quite the exciting matchup, a 7-day break without basketball is disappointing but fingers crossed the Finals is worth the wait.</p>

      <label for="l6hajzx" class="commentText"><p>Experience matters. Mavericks offensive duo is more experienced in playoffs compared to our offensive duo (KAT and Ant). Not happy about refereeing, series could be closer than it looks, but mavs prevailed at the end of the day. Before this series started, I had the same sentiments about Mavs having the experience. That&rsquo;s why building a winning team matters. We did well this year, I have no complaints. We knocked down the reigning champs. I hope we stay competitive like this for the coming seasons, then our time will come. Good luck to Mavs</p>
