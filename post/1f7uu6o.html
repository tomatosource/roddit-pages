      <label for="lladg3e" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m confused as to why so much of the talk about Gobert getting &lsquo;played off the court&rsquo; in the playoffs is about his defense when it&rsquo;s obviously his absolutely fucking horrendous offense that&rsquo;s the main issue.</p>

<p>Jason Kidd in particular has been incredible at gameplanning to exploit this in both of the playoffs series he&rsquo;s coached against him. I would even say Rudy was really good defensively in both of those series, but the Mavs under Kidd (among others) have excelled at forcing Rudy to be a playmaker and a scorer and he absolutely cannot handle that at any sort of volume, and it drags the rest of his team down and clogs everything up.</p>

<p>To me this is the much more pressing question about how viable Rudy is to be one of your highest paid players in a playoff series, not the fact that he gets cooked on some switches sometimes. He&rsquo;s not even that bad on the perimeter.</p>

      <label for="llao6s9" class="commentText"><p>I really think the disdain for Gobert is rooted in his offense. Mitchell didn&rsquo;t want to pass to him, D&rsquo;Lo didn&rsquo;t want to pass to him, Edwards complained about the lack of spacing when Gobert first got there and didn&rsquo;t pass to him. His hands are awful so he&rsquo;ll drop passes or fumble the ball or get stripped but even when he holds onto to the ball, it looks bad. Awkward footwork and zero touch. Despite that, he&rsquo;s always calling for the ball and gets visibly upset when he doesn&rsquo;t get it. It&rsquo;s somewhat ironic to see even Dwight pile on recently because he became disliked as a teammate and across the league for similar reasons.</p>

<p>It starts there, but despite that he gets max contracts and the media gives him credit via awards so the dislike and jealousy grows such that they start picking apart even what he does well. He does have defensive plays on the perimeter where he gets beat that are really loud for how awkward he looks in them. That make it easy to criticize, but I genuinely think if players had more respect for his offensive game, they wouldn&rsquo;t be as mad about him getting all these defensive awards.</p>

<p>As to why his offense doesn&rsquo;t get more criticism, I guess it&rsquo;s because nobody is out there praising his offense so there&rsquo;s not as much a impetus to say it&rsquo;s overrated. But I generally agree with you that his offense is the thing that&rsquo;s probably worse than people realize and where his actual liability on the basketball court is.</p>

      <label for="llar90x" class="commentText"><p>His inability to play offense is definitely a part of the hate equation. I think a lot of players view him as a big body that tries hard on defense (because that&rsquo;s all he can really do on the court.) To the DPOY skeptics he&rsquo;s just a role player that&rsquo;s getting a lot of hype</p>

      <label for="llb1vi4" class="commentText"><p>I think part of the problem is that his offense is so bad that it makes his defense less effective in playoff situations. He&rsquo;s tall and strong and so should be a threat offensively but isn&rsquo;t at all so opposing teams can feel free to do 5 out or space the floor in ways they wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise.</p>

<p>That forces him on the perimeter which isn&rsquo;t bad per se since he&rsquo;s a relatively good defender on the outside for a more traditional big. But it does mean that teams have a much easier time getting him away from the paint on defense which is where he&rsquo;s elite (and presumably why he&rsquo;s getting paid as much as he does) and his perimeter defense, while good, isn&rsquo;t on the same level as some of the other best defenders of the generation like Dray or AD who aren&rsquo;t as easily game planned around.</p>

      <label for="llajk4m" class="commentText"><p>&ldquo;horrendous offense&rdquo; I mean he&rsquo;s doing exactly what he&rsquo;s supposed to be doing and at a high level. He is not a jump shooter, and the wolves don&rsquo;t need him to be. They have many other guys who can shoot from inside. Robert for his career is 13.2 points per game in the playoffs at 65%. How the heck is that horrendous? If you&rsquo;re looking for him to force or create shots that&rsquo;s just not what they need from him and not his role.</p>

<p>I mean he plays his role perfectly, I am not sure what more people can ask. Big guy who plays big, gets offensive rebounds, makes his close shots, and protects the rim, without stepping outside his role</p>

      <label for="llakrvi" class="commentText"><p>If you think Rudy&rsquo;s offensive woes are just about jump shooting, then I&rsquo;m not sure you&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time watching him lol. His stats are misleading in terms of his overall offensive impact, it&rsquo;s all putbacks and lobs (and even his lob catching leaves a lot to be desired).</p>

<p>His offensive gravity on the court is negative because you quite literally don&rsquo;t have to guard him outside of the restricted area. If you sag off a guy like Draymond, he&rsquo;ll tear you apart with his playmaking. If you sag off a guy like Rudy, you can genuinely just forget he&rsquo;s there and direct your attention elsewhere. If you force Rudy into a position where he has to dribble the ball at all, your defense has already won. That is going to be a problem for any team&rsquo;s offense in the playoffs, where coaches are specifically game planning around things like this, no matter how you slice it.</p>

      <label for="llan0ee" class="commentText"><p>This… and the fact that little forwards can keep him off the rim…(in part because usually referees allow smaller players to get away with more physically and he is not a superstar). All the same if he can’t exploit matchups he is an offensive liability. I don’t think anyone expects him to be KD but if he can be a version of shaq when someone 6’8” or shorter is guarding him.</p>

      <label for="llb3yva" class="commentText"><p>Yea, Clippers small ball vs Utah didn&rsquo;t work because Gobert was a bad defender, it was because he couldn&rsquo;t abuse the mismatch on the other end.</p>

<p>I like how he brought up the GSW vs AD playoffs series because that&rsquo;s basically the other main example of how a defender is so good your whole offensive strategy is to play around him.</p>

<p>Also to the point about not being able to guard Jokic, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a big issue with Gobert. A lot of the the top modern defensive centers (Gobert, AD, Bam) spec tons of points into agility so they aren&rsquo;t traffic comes on the perimeter that they have to give up points in strength. It&rsquo;s basically the reverse of the Shaq era, so if someone who can play bully ball comes in all these skinner faster centers will have issues. Yes you&rsquo;ll have issues against a true bully ball center but the current NBA meta doesn&rsquo;t have quite as many of those going around.</p>

      <label for="llaw4va" class="commentText"><p>Because he consistently gets targeted in the playoffs by pretty much every team the plays him. I swear this narrative is flipped, if you actually watch basketball (in the playoffs) and don’t just read advanced stats you will see that Rudy is/has been played off the court many times for his defence. Hell, this year he wasn’t even the best defender on his team let alone the league. He can’t guard good bigs, he gets absolutely killed when in the pnr by any team with a good offensive guard.</p>

<p>He is by far the most overrated player and it’s purely from these stat watching fans that beers actually watch him being targeted and abused and put in every action in games that matter.</p>

<p>Think about any other dmvp, opposition teams schemes to get them out of the action, today is continuously schemed to be out IN the action, this is why nba players hate in him and don’t respect him, they know he isn’t good.</p>

I do agree that he&rsquo;s not good on certain matchups and schemes that require him to leave the paint because he&rsquo;s not quick or agile enough in those environments. That doesn&rsquo;t make him trash though because most everyone in the league has weaknesses that other teams target.</p>

      <label for="llb28yz" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s like you didn&rsquo;t even watch the video. Daniel goes into this, basically saying that all elite rim protectors are targeted in the playoffs (he points out Draymond and AD). Even when Gobert is iso&rsquo;d on, he&rsquo;s still great because his length lets him give shooters space while still being in closeout range, and his mobility allows him to track down drivers and contest at the rim.</p>

<p>The issue is that while he&rsquo;s a great defender in open space, he&rsquo;s the best rim protector,  so teams will prefer to make him defend in open space even if he&rsquo;s good at it.</p>

      <label for="llafzfe" class="commentText"><p>I think it is a reasonable argument to be honest. He has a huge impact around the rim but is not a good perimeter defender. He is an asset in the paint and a liability on the perimeter. The collective team defense can be very good if you can find a way for him to stay close to the rim. I don’t think that’s even disputed. If you are giving an individual award I can see why people would say he is undeserving because he relies heavily on a team scheme for him to maximize his potential. Some people think, “Well, it is a 5 on 5 game - he does have a huge impact when used correctly.“ Others think, “It is an individual award and he is not able to defend well the on perimeter and there are other players who can protect the rim and defend on the perimeter who are more deserving.” Personally, I think both are valid arguments.</p>

<p>He deserves every single DPOY, if there was a DPOY-playoffs he wouldn&rsquo;t get many votes though. It&rsquo;s just the nature of the game and of the award.</p>

      <label for="llapwam" class="commentText"><p>I think it is hilarious that I am getting downvoted. I haven’t even communicated an opinion as much as I have highlighted that there are two different perspectives that are supportable by the largely undisputed facts around his skillset.</p>

<p>If you are looking at it strictly as a regular season award (*more below), then he deserves the awards as he contributes to a regular season winning defense.</p>

<p>*I have yet to find the criteria. While it is a regular season award, I think it is justifiable to contextualize the contributions historically and balance defensive versatility more. Winning the playoffs is always the end goal, so I can see why someone would look at the skills that translate to playoff success and prioritize those attributes. There is still a case to be made that all of the regular season wins that he contributes to creates an easier playoff path and that offsets with his reduced contributions individually in the playoffs.</p>

<p>If you think raw stats are all that matters, then he remains the overwhelming favorite to continue to win the award.</p>

      <label for="llar3ke" class="commentText"><p>I think people are downvoting you because of your initial argument;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No one seriously says that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Loads of people seriously say that. People fucking hate Gobert, both fans and players alike.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What you will hear is that Gobert is not a 1 man defensive machine that he was and is portrayed as. Solid player. Deserves 4 DPoYs? No but it is what it is</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then you kind of flip flop on defending and criticising Gobert, which is fine, but the argument is a bit all over the place. It&rsquo;s hard to follow the red thread in your arguments and I&rsquo;ve had to read both your posts twice.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re saying anything controversial in essence really, but people will see something they dislike initially, then downvote everything that follows. Complaining about getting downvoted is certainly the fastest way to get downvoted as well.</p>

<p>Istead of using * to insert sidenotes, use &amp;gt; at the start of a sentence and use quotes instead, it&rsquo;s easier on the eyes to follow.</p>

      <label for="llajysb" class="commentText"><p>He is a brilliant defender in the regular season when everyone plays a new team every night.</p>

<p>He is exploitable on defense when teams scheme and gameplan against specific matchups, he&rsquo;s vulnerable on the switch at the perimeter when the best players are going at him possession after possession in the playoffs.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the same with other big men throughout history. Shaq himself, unless he slimmed down 30kgs would have been very vulnerable to the switch. You can&rsquo;t just get by without being able to guard the perimeter at all in today&rsquo;s game. Someone like Steph would switch onto Shaq every single possession and have either a lay-up or an easy 3.</p>

<p>Gobert is extremely effective against certain match-ups and very ineffective against others.</p>

      <label for="llaj6qf" class="commentText"><p>&ldquo;solid&rdquo; rebounder&hellip;. he lead the league at 14.7 one year, and is consistently in the top 5 in his career. That would make him quite literally a top 5 rebounder in the world. And he is average 3.4 offensive rebounds per game for his whole career. That&rsquo;s really good. People really underestimate how big of an impact an offensive rebound is.</p>

<p>If you look at any of the other &ldquo;top defenders&rdquo; last year, like the &ldquo;Dorture Chamber&rdquo; they all got cooked by Luka.</p>

      <label for="llaksz8" class="commentText"><p>The defensive breakdown was great. It really showed how different parts of a defense work together as a greater whole and that players aren’t just playing in a vacuum. Stat watchers will often act as if direct numbers are the only thing that matters, and why these numbers exist isn’t investigated.</p>

<p>My only gripe was the comparisons to other defensive players, especially Draymond Green. A guy known as &lsquo;Tripple Single&rsquo; who is a worse scorer, screensetter and rebounder than Gobert isn’t in a different offensive tier. On the defensive side of the ball he’s clearly worse, so that part made little sense.</p>

<p>Bam would have been a decent comp in addition to AD, because those players are centers who have roughly comparable schematic roles.</p>

      <label for="llav4yb" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s ironic that you complain about &ldquo;stat watchers&rdquo; and then make fun of Draymond for his underwhelming box score stats and compare him to Gobert offensively. Draymond, especially in his prime, is tiers above Gobert on offense.</p>

<p>Draymond setting a high screen is an advantage for the offense. He&rsquo;s converted more 4 on 3 plays into into dunks or made baskets than probably any other big in history. Gobert in the same situation turns the ball over half the time. Draymond&rsquo;s ability as a ball handler and decision maker gives an offense more options and amplifies the effectiveness of cutting and shooting on the team while Gobert&rsquo;s limitations give the defense more options.</p>

<p>Draymond is a competent ball handler and playmaker who can keep the offense moving and is an above average passer for his position. He also has great timing/awareness with his illegal screens, which is a valuable skill even if I hate it.</p>

<p>Gobert can barely catch the ball, cannot dribble, has terrible touch around the rim, cannot make anything but basic passes, and a way less effective screener than someone his size should be. He’s probably the worst offensive player getting starter minutes in the league, definitely among playoff teams.</p>
