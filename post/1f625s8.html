</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Lebron is a GOAT candidate. Steph is  in Top 12 all time contention. And KD is In Top 15 talks. They are all pushing 40 yrs old. And they will probably retire in 5 years.</p>

<p>But, who is next.</p>

<p>The next batch of Americans in their 20s are:</p>

<p>Booker - 27 yrs old</p>

<p>Mitchell - 27 yrs old</p>

<p>Brown - 27 yrs old</p>

<p>Tatum - 26 yrs old</p>

<p>Ja - 25 yrs old</p>

<p>Ant - 23 yrs old</p>

<p>Paolo - 21 yrs old</p>

<p>Etc.</p>

<p><strong>&mdash;</strong></p>

<p>However, as of the moment. No one believes any of this guy will be in convo for Top 20 all time. Let alone Top 15 all time.</p>

<p>So, do you think the next great American Player will be a 2025-2026 draftee (Like Cooper Flagg or Cameron Boozer)</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>He is already in the league. But still reaching his prime. Maybe Ant Edwards?🤔</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

I think MVP-less guys like Kawhi, CP3, Scottie Pippen, Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, John Stockton, Zeke, Dwade, etc. are comfortably top 40 and above AD&rsquo;s career projection at the moment (although Pippen and Stockton never had huge runs as the main guy, they had extended success as a secondary star as still one of the best players in the league)</p>

      <label for="lkxx464" class="commentText"><p>Yea I get that your criteria is different than mine. Off the top of my head, there probably isn’t a top 40 player who didn’t fit the criteria you mentioned (MVP/DPOY or a deep playoff run as the number 1 option) except for Scottie Pippen and John Stockton (Stockton would be somewhat comparable here if AD continues his play).</p>

<p>However, I feel like if AD continues to play the way he does for the next 5-6 years, he’s going to make more All Star games and All NBA/All Defensive teams that his career will be comparable to those top 40 players like Iverson you mentioned.</p>

<p>It’s true Iverson made a deep playoff run to the Finals as the main guy, something that AD never has, but AD’s accomplishments as a number 2 option plus his overall accolades will make him comparable in 5-6 years (not now though). This is assuming he doesn’t fall off a ton, which is always possible with injuries.   </p>

<p>Speaking of age adjusted comparisons, Anthony Edwards is a better player than both Harden and Kawhi were at his current age. </p>

<p>Harden was a sixth man at the same age that Ant just made All NBA second team. </p>

<p>So if those 2 can continue to improve to their peak levels, Edwards is definitely a candidate when he’s already ahead of them age adjusted. </p>

<p>I don’t think you can be that confident. While I agree with you progression isn’t linear nor the same for everyone, I actually see Ant being a clear cut MVP candidate one day. I actually think Ant can do this within 2-3 years. </p>

<p>To me, he has all the tools to be as good as prime Harden, which again no one could have predicted when Harden was 23. </p>

      <label for="lkx4zyt" class="commentText"><p>To be fair, Ant is significantly younger than Booker/Tatum/Brown/Mitchell (who are in their primes now)</p>

<p>My hot take is:</p>

<p>Ant/Paolo (21-23 yrs old rising stars) will surpass the level of Booker/Tatum/Brown/Mitchell (27 -29 yrs old in their prime stars)</p>

<p>And yes, I also believe the incoming rookies in 2025-2026 draft (Flagg, Ace, Dylan, AJ, Cameron) will have more promise and potential to be the next great American superstars.</p>

<p>A few of these names won’t even be considered top 3 picks by the time their draft comes around. </p>

<p>Ace Bailey is a huge candidate to either be the 2nd pick or fall like Cam Reddish and other similar players before him. He’s a true high variance player since his entire profile is athletic shot making. </p>

If the Celtics become a dynasty and Tatum is at the head of it he is going get put in those conversations regardless of if he as a individual player is good enough to be in them.</p>

<p>Paolo is a 6’10 forward who can do a bit of everything and has a great feel for scoring. He is a really good player already and is still extremely young with a great team around him.</p>

      <label for="lkx8h5m" class="commentText"><p>Somebody in the Celtics subreddit asked yesterday where Tatum ranks all-time and I figured if he doesn’t have any major injuries derail him, and he wins 1 more ring (and finals MVP), by the end of 2029 he can have a solidly top 50 career of all-time and will be 31 years old.</p>

<ul>
<li>2 championships</li>
<li>1 finals MVP</li>
<li>7 or 8 All-NBA selections (at least 3 first team)</li>
<li>8 or 9 All Star selections</li>
<li>Over 20,000 career points (3rd or 4th in Celtics history</li>
<li>Most 3PM in Celtics history</li>
<li>Around top 15 in career playoff points if the Celtics make a few deep runs in the next 5 years</li>
<li>Possibly the most playoff wins of the 2020’s(?)</li>
</ul>

<p>And he’ll still be 31 and have time to add to this resume. That 2nd championship would carry a lot of weight, which imo would need to happen this year or next before the next bunch of 23-24 year olds enter their prime and Wemby has a team around him, but that resume is just as good as a number of guys on the current top 75 team. Maybe no MVP but the 2 rings and a FMVP will go a long way for Tatum. There simply aren’t a lot of players with multiple championships, 8 All-NBA selections and 20k career points.</p>

      <label for="lkxe2x8" class="commentText"><p>That’s the number 1 thing that would keep him out of top 20 imo.</p>

<p>But the other thing to consider is championships also matter in all-time discussions</p>

<p>Right now among his peers,</p>

<p>Giannis has 8 All-NBA and 1 championship</p>

<p>Jokic has 6 All-NBA and 1 championship</p>

<p>Tatum has 4 All-NBA and 1 championship</p>

<p>Embiid has 5 All-NBA and an MVP</p>

<p>Luka has 5 All-NBA</p>

<p>Tatum winning multiple championships will at least be in discussions by the end of the decade if Embiid and Luka never win one and Tatum has just as many All-NBA selections. Idk a good comp but I think there would be debate about it even if it doesn’t seem that way right now</p>

      <label for="lkxfue5" class="commentText"><p>I think people would recognize that Tatum has had a much better team around him which is frankly accurate. There is a reason Charles Barkley is much more heralded than Isiah Thomas to the point it literally isn&rsquo;t even a discussion. The only one on your list I might consider dinging is Embiid due to consistent playoff failures and even then some people will (and maybe rightfully) counter with his on/offs. Just like in current state, Celtics fans would debate it while others won&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Besides Giannis, Jokic, Embiid, and Luka you&rsquo;re also looking at SGA who broke out this year. Tatum has peaked at 4th in MVP voting. Meanwhile if we look at someone like KD, he&rsquo;s gotten 1st once, 2nd 3 times and he&rsquo;s on the lower end of that award as far as top 20 goes. Unless Tatum improves significantly on an individual level, there&rsquo;s pretty much zero chance he can hit that tier.</p>

      <label for="lkxleej" class="commentText"><p>I think there are other factors to consider, like total playoff stats too, which Tatum is racking them up more than the other players of this generation at the moment. It’s really dependent on how successful the Celtics are for the next 5 years and if Tatum has longevity play in his favor for simply compiling stats and accolades while never being the best player in the league.</p>

<p>And I guess no MVP would hurt him from ever being top 20, but it would certainly be a discussion among his peers. Like I said, a finals MVP would really help Tatum’s argument, but without it, I don’t see how he ever passes Embiid or Luka especially if they win a title as well.</p>

<p>Great idea.</p>

<p>Paolo Banchero on-court: -2.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub> for his career (-0.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub> last year)</p>

<p>Paolo Banchero&rsquo;s ass on the bench: +3.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub> for his career (+<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub> last year)</p>

<p>Absolutely nowhere near top 20 trajectory. This is a textbook illusion where people credit a star for damage done by role players. Banchero is closer to a Derozan trajectory and is even below that than a top 20 ATG trajectory.</p>

<p>Tier one: Kareem, Jordan, Lebron</p>

<p>That leave one slot for Duncan, Kobe, Robertson, and Steph. You’re putting Steph over them all?</p>

<p>But first off take Hakeem out of this. He doesn’t need to be in this convo.</p>

It’s hard to predict because every generation is probably only going to have one or two of those guys.
Just going back a few eras and starting with the 80s you just have Magic and Bird.
Then you only have Jordan for the 90s. Then the 2000s popped the fuck off and gave us Kobe, Shaq, and Duncan.
Then it was sort of just Lebron who bridged that era with the modern Steph and KD generation.</p>

<p>I’d say Ant maybe has the best chance but predicting someone to be top 15 all time when they’re 22 is tough.</p>

<p>The top 20 is already extremely hard to get into and there&rsquo;s a batch of 5-6 non Americans from this generation that&rsquo;s gonna make it even harder within the next 10 years or so.</p>

<p>I just don&rsquo;t see it with any of the current young Americans, Ant is probably the most likely but I&rsquo;d still easily bet against him being in that range by the end of his career. Zion could have been there but his career has obviously been derailed so much by injuries, AD to a lesser extent.</p>

      <label for="lkyam07" class="commentText"><p>At this point of the NBA history, a player have to bet the undisputed best player in the league to have a shot at top 15 all time. The only exception is maybe KD, who was top 3 for ~12 years, and gets some extra credit for being second to Lebron for a long time.</p>

<p>If we look at the line of Jokic (29), Luka (25) and Wemby (20), and don’t see any of the listed players surpass the his wall of EU greatness. The only two players in the league seem to have a chance to break that wall for a year or two are Embiid and Shai.</p>

<p>So the chance for a US top 15 player seem to be someone in the upcoming drafts who is able to compete with Wemby, or an early retirement/decline/injury to Luka AND Wemby stopping development or injuring himself badly, which could create a vacuum of talent in a few years.</p>

<p>Also, when Curry was Zion Williamon&rsquo;s age, no one expected him to be a top 10-15 player of all time. Curry in his first few seasons, like Zion currently, was constantly held back by injuries. I honestly think it&rsquo;s too early to say Zion can&rsquo;t be a top 10-15 all time great player. Zion certainly has the talent. Maybe he will get a mid career resurgence like Curry and dominate the league?</p>

      <label for="lkx8muz" class="commentText"><p>Steph just isn’t in top 12 contention, he’s comfortably top 10, and KD solidly top 15. I think from that list Ant and Paolo will go on to have the best careers, but this league is so rapidly changing so who knows.</p>

<p>Edit: not saying brunson is on his way to top 20 all time, but OP put guys like Booker and Mitchell on their list. In no way is brunson a level below them.</p>

<p>Nikola jokić is 29, in his prime, and is on track to potentially go down as an all time great.</p>

<p>3 MVPs and a ring, he should be #1 on this list and he doesn’t even get a mention… 🤦‍♂️ lol</p>

<p>Top <sup>15</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> would be within reach if he is able to sustain for a duration.</p>
