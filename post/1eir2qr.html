<p>Why does everyone say this? You also had Baron Davis (who has been vocal in his support of Lin) comment on the contract too. Everyone was interviewing the knicks players specifically about the poison pill and they all said they didn&rsquo;t like it. You have NBA players right now criticizing the CBA because it makes it so teams can&rsquo;t stay together. That is the literal same thing. Melo criticized the structure of the contract, but said Lin should get his money and expected him to be back in NY. They literally all met with Woodson to plan out the season later on.</p>

      <label for="lg8pxpy" class="commentText"><p>Exactly. I don&rsquo;t understand why people just ignored the entire context of his quote. He literally said in the same answer Lin should get paid but the poison pill that the FO has to match is ridiculous. Even if it&rsquo;s bad to comment on someone&rsquo;s contract, Melo wasn&rsquo;t doing it to to say Lin was overpaid or didn&rsquo;t deserve his money. He was talking about the mechanics of the deal and no one ever put the quote in context when talking about it.</p>

<p>He even stated later that “It was ridiculous for them to do what they did as far as throwing that out there and making it tough on us to sign him back,”  “That’s why it’s called free agency, though.”</p>

He was referencing the pill preventing us from re-signing Lin, which they already reported Dolan having cold feet over, was ridiculous. Yes you can argue he didn&rsquo;t need to say that but it wasn&rsquo;t like he just said fuck Lin for getting paid. He literally said in the same answer Lin should take whatever deal is best for him but there is an entire context to the answer that always get left out.</p>

<p>I was in public school at that time and everyone was talking about it. Asian kids were basically called Lin not in a racist way but because it was surreal.</p>

<p>That three over Raptors to win the game, you could see all the Toronto fans, who have a huge Chinese population, going crazy.</p>

<p>Then LeBron and the Heat showed up and put an end to it to make a statement. Was fun while it lasted. Probably the best NYK moment up until last year in decades.</p>

<p>The real problem was they fired D&rsquo;antoni during ASB and hired Mike Woodson, not as offensively gifted, the whole team is trying to adjust, and then Lin tore his meniscus in late March. In a sense the Heat did end Linsanity, but other factors contributed to that more than just one game.</p>

I don’t see Melo being this butt hurt about Linsanity if Lin wasn’t of Asian descent. Even Kobe wanted to pretend he didn’t know who Jeremy was, until lit the Lakers ass up the next time they played.</p>

<p>I’ve seen this casual racism happen to so many of my Asian friends play at local rec centers and parks.</p>

      <label for="lg8ulk7" class="commentText"><p>There was a lot of racism in the media, but this is more so to do with Melo being a selfish asshole and Kobe being the same lmao. Kobe would&rsquo;ve done the same to any upstart player, that&rsquo;s just who he was. Lin also has a very tame personality and is a small guard and came out of nowhere. Melo just wanted to dominate the ball and the spotlight. Amar&rsquo;e is super happy for Lin, as are the rest of his black teammates.</p>

<p>Compare this to Yao Ming. Yao faced racism initially from the likes of Chuck and Shaq, but once he proved his worth people really respected him. This happens to a lot of European players (Dirk, Gasol, Wemby etc.). At the end of the day, if you can ball people shut up. Unfortunately Lin never reached the same heights again, but the racism he faced was a lot more from media figures (Whitlock, ESPN) and even refs than other players.</p>
