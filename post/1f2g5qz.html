Star power ? For example Kobe is an icon that is bigger than basketball and one of the biggest star the sport has ever seen. Does it play into its ranking ? For some people, Kobe is top 3. It&rsquo;s so subjective. My only thing, is if OP feels like Hakeem is in top 10 for sure, who does he remove and why ? this way there is a real discussion</p>

      <label for="lk6h762" class="commentText"><p>The goat conversation shifts between ages, but Russell is in the mix among the older crowd. To a certain extent it’s a popularity contest, so the more people grew up watching a player the better their standing is there. Before MJ blew up it was between Kareem and Russell, then it was a three way thing.</p>

<p>If we go by accolades, Russell has as many MVP awards as MJ and completely beats him out in rings. Russell was the best at winning, which depending on what goat means to people can massively boost him or seem irrelevant.</p>

<p>Ben Taylor (the guy who does Thinking Basketball) laid it out about 5 years ago. The tl;dr is that Russell was the unquestioned best of his era for his ability to impact winning overall, and that the gap between him and the second-best defender ever is larger than the gap between, say, MJ and the second-best scorer ever:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the height of their dynasty, the Celtics were comically dominant. From 1962-65, their average margin-of-victory (MOV) was over 8 points per game. During the same time span, only two other teams even eclipsed 4 points per game – the ’64 Royals and the ’64 Warriors. And all of Boston’s separation was created by its historic defense, anchored by Russell:</p>

      <label for="lk6efg4" class="commentText"><p>Russell’s accolades came from a time when he wasn’t just competing against lower talent but less people. 11 championships, 9 of them came when the league had 8 or 9 teams. 2 came when the league had 14. 5 MVPs, all when the league had 8-9 teams.</p>

      <label for="lk6m7ko" class="commentText"><p>I’m not sure the “fewer teams” point is actually a strike against him. Fewer teams means the talent that <em>was</em> in the league was more concentrated. A big talking point for quite some time was how expansion teams diluted the talent of the league. This is something that gets brought up after every round of expansions.</p>

<p>I just don’t think there’s any fair or objective way to rank players from past eras against modern players. Russell was the most impactful player of his era, <em>by far</em>. He also played against substantially less talented competition. But what would Bill have been able to do if he played his career with modern sports science, dietitians, charter flights, and real sneaker tech? Or fans that didn’t try to assault him and hurl slurs at him <em>in his own arena</em>?</p>

      <label for="lk67j04" class="commentText"><p>More than half of those players are either Celtics or Lakers. I mean, if Hakeem were drafted to any of those franchises, do you think he would have won fewer championships? Hakeem was a better offensive and defensive player than Duncan. Hakeem beat Shaq in the Finals. Swept them in fact, with an inferior team. If you are using team accolades as part of it I think you are favoring some players drafted in better situations or with better management.</p>

I&rsquo;m not on board with comparing him with similarly skilled players that have clearly won more of everything and put him above them because he had it harder. It&rsquo;s not fair at all.</p>

He was being pushed hard as the new face and the Magic team was the vehicle. It just wasn&rsquo;t a team built well enough to compete with those rockets. Let&rsquo;s be real though, if Mike stays in Chicago, they likely run the whole decade and the goat debate is a dead issue.</p>

      <label for="lk6hmpi" class="commentText"><p>Yup. Here’s a forgotten Hakeem fact:</p>

<p>In his second year in the league, Hakeem was the best player on a team that destroyed Magic/Kareem/Worthy Lakers in only 5 games. Hakeem have them 31/11/2/2/4</p>

<p>This took them to the Finals where the matchup with the 86 Celtics - their best iteration of the Bird era - and pushed them to 6 despite not having anyone else put up even 16ppg in the series.</p>

<p>Hakeem pulled all that off with his only star teammate being Ralph Sampson. Sampson was a star with sky high upside, but he wasn’t a superstar and didn’t make All-NBA or anything like that in 86.</p>

<p>You give a baby Hakeem just a <em>star</em> and that’s what happened. Then Sampson gets hurt and he has nothing to work with for nearly a decade. You let him play for years with teammates like Oscar, Magic, Worthy, Wilkes, etc like Kareem had and you’re telling me he doesn’t win a ton of extra rings?</p>

<p>Or Manu, TP, DRob, Kawhi, and Pop as the coach?</p>

<p>Having a young Kobe as your #2 option, or getting to run with Pippen, Rodman, and Harper with Phil Jackson?</p>

<p>Bird had such good teammates it was Cedric Maxwell who took home the FMVP of his first title let alone McHale, Parish, Tiny, DJ</p>

      <label for="lk6qonh" class="commentText"><p>Rudy T&rsquo;s plays during 94-95 season were dump the ball inside to Hakeem, and he&rsquo;ll pass out when he&rsquo;s crowded, the others need to just make the shots when open. He had help with Drexler the next season, but his teammates weren&rsquo;t at the level of Duncan or Shaq when they won their championships.</p>

<p>Additionally, Hakeem&rsquo;s growth as a mature level headed player is also an interesting story itself. He was a hot-headed player with a really bad temper. It was easy to get into his head during his early years. He grew into a leader during those 2 championship years and got rid of his bad reputations.</p>

<p>Arguably, Shaq is probably the strongest player ever although Wilt might have something to say about that. But he never grew his game probably because he didn&rsquo;t need to. He would need to develop some fade-away or more reliable floater or hook farther away from the basket if he is to play in today&rsquo;s game.</p>

<p>Duncan was a beast. A lot of the youngbloods have never seen him play during his younger years. He was strong, fast, and had finesse, but stoic with a killer mentality. Probably the best 4 ever to play the game. His game was already almost complete in every facet when he joined the NBA. He polished it to perfection his whole career. The bank shots, the fade away, the handles, the blocks, the offesnive/defensive positionings, and awareness. But Duncan had Manu, and David Robinson, and Tony Parker, and a more mature Robert Horry, Kawhi Leonard, Avery Johnson, and others.</p>

<p>Hakeem was Duncan&rsquo;s predecessor. Of all the centers from the dinosaur age, Hakeem would&rsquo;ve transitioned easily into today&rsquo;s game. Imagine Embiid, but better in every way. Hakeem used to study point guards to see how he could incorporate guard moves into the center position. He would face up a defender and do crossovers to get to the basket, stop and run his dreamshake routines with the fake and counter and fake and counter moves. They were really poetry in motion. Or he could take a sweet hook, or take that smooth fade-away. He always thought that he was a guard trapped in a center&rsquo;s body.</p>

<p>Hakeem is in the argument for being the best center of all time with KAJ imo. Only other arguments other than those two is Shaq if you really value peak, or Wilt if you don’t devalue his era, but if so then you should have wilt or Russell as the goats lol.</p>

<p>I’m really not sure what kind of revisionism has happened but I don’t think anyone could’ve argued Kobe or Duncan being better overall than Hakeem until the last couple years especially Duncan.</p>

<p>The only argument with Hakeem should be if he’s top 5 and it’s not an argument that he’s top 10</p>

      <label for="lk6rzta" class="commentText"><p>He’s well above KD and it’s not close. He’s better than Shaq too when factoring in Lakers Shaq would be borderline unplayable. Shaq played against bums in his prime. The Nets had Todd McCullough starting against him in back to back finals is all I need to say about how garbage the center position was from about 1998-2003. Shaq gained weight so he wouldn’t be pushed around.</p>

<p>When I say Lakers Shaq should be borderline unplayable, I mean it. Players shoot the 3 way to well in today’s game to allow for Shaq to shoot 50% from the line. Hack a Shaq would be way more effective because now you’re getting <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> points back potentially every time he goes to the line. Imagine being up in the 4th by 15 points and then Steve Kerr sends in 4 bums to foul Shaq and force him to shoot 40-50 free throws in the fourth quarter so Curry can go <sup>12</sup>&frasl;<sub>30</sub> from 3 and win the game. The modern game where role players can actually shoot a 3 rather than having only 1-2 guys on a team as 3 point specialists makes Hack a Shaq extremely effective and would play Shaq off the court in the final 6 minutes of a playoff game.</p>

<p>Lakers Shaq would also get targeted and abused on the perimeter. Hakeem was elite at perimeter and interior defense. He would be amazing in any era. Can’t say that about Lakers Shaq. Hakeem is a better player than Shaq.</p>

But the argument for Kareem is more MVPs and more Championships along with being the best college basketball player ever. There are obviously counter arguments, but if you value accolades highly I can see picking Kareem</p>

      <label for="lk66ezv" class="commentText"><p>Kareem being completely removed from the GOAT conversation over the last couple of decades is astonishing to me. We marvel at LeBron’s longevity, but Kareem was a factor for 20 years, playing the post in a very physical era, after playing 4 years in college…and that gets forgotten. I grew up a Pistons fan, and I was 9-10 years old during the Bad Boys era. Kareem was scary even at 42.</p>

<p>I actually think he and Hakeem would be scarier now, with the emphasis on spacing. In their primes, both had good enough footwork and quickness to play on both ends of the floor, and I can’t see it being harder for them to score or rebound now than it was back then.</p>

      <label for="lk6e8si" class="commentText"><p>Kareem being the GOAT was always a fringe thing thanks to his relationship with media and he started gaining steam thanks to Lebron bringing longevity to the forefront of people&rsquo;s minds. His GOAT candidacy was subsequently squashed when Lebron beat him in longevity and he no longer has a real argument thanks to someone beating hin at his own arguments. It&rsquo;s similar to how Kobe automatically has zero claim to GOAT due to MJ being better or Curry being outperformed by Lebron H2H consistently. You can&rsquo;t be the GOAT if you&rsquo;re clearly #2 to someone else.</p>

      <label for="lk6ljpd" class="commentText"><p>I’m not saying I disagree with you, but Lebron won his last Finals MVP at 35 and it seems unlikely he’ll win another championship at this point. Kareem won his last finals MVP at 38 and then won 2 <em>more</em> championships after that. </p>

<p>The idea that LeBron has superior longevity to Kareem is mostly based on LeBron going to the NBA straight from high school and Kareem playing 4 years of college ball (where he’s basically the undisputed GOAT). We don’t know where Lebron’s career will end up, but it omits some important details to claim that he’s conclusively beaten Kareem in terms of longevity already.</p>

His problem is that his best years coincide with MJ taking a break. So we know he was not definitively the best player in basketball even when he was (sounds weird by you know what I mean). Guy is well respected but truth is MJ’s 90s had a weaker cast of superstars than at almost any point I can think of. MJ and Shaq are really the only 90s guys in that top 10</p>

<p>I don’t think Hakeem’s career was any sort of low point for superstar competition. His career overlapped 6 of those 9 guys (didn’t overlap James, Chamberlain, or Russel), although he missed the peaks of Duncan and Abdul-Jabbar.</p>

<p>MJ, LBJ, KAJ, Magic, Larry, Timmy, Kobe, Shaq, Hakeem, Wilt, Bill, Steph</p>

<p>Among those 12, the only players getting serious GOAT Votes are</p>

<p>MJ and Lebron (Top Voters)</p>

<p>KAJ (distant 3rd</p>

<p>Wilt and Russell (The former because of his stats, and the latter for his rings as the best player)</p>

<p>So, that will leave,</p>

<p><strong>Magic, Larry, Timmy, Kobe, Shaq, Hakeem, Steph</strong></p>

<p>Usually, Steph is out for now for most people. Because of lack of all nbas (Luka surpassed him now, and Luka isnt even in his absolute prime yet), and multiple FMVPs</p>

<p>But there is one name to be kicked out left.</p>

<p>Usually, it is either Hakeem, Kobe, Shaq, or Timmy depending on what you value. (Magic and Larry are always in top 10 list I see)</p>

<p>Due to some circumstances, Hakeem has less success and accolades. Compared to Kobe, Shaq, and Timmy. But people can argue, he had tougher circumstances, and more bad luck.</p>

<ol>
<li>The Russell-led Celtics defense was the best defense in NBA history, when controlling for era, by a MILE. And they never slipped even when other Celtics all-stars (Cousy, Heinsohn, Havlicek, Jones) were out.</li>
</ol>

<p>But when Russell was out, they dropped from a 59-win pace to a 35-win pace.</p>

<ol>
<li>Russell played, on average, more games against elite centers b/c the league was smaller, and he absolutely vaporized them. So in addition to being the greatest team defender ever, he was also the best 1v1 defender ever.</li>

He unfortunately didn’t have a front office that built enough for Hakeem to win every year. Top 10s are really about the best player along with the best achievements. You need both. Two rings just doesn’t cut it into the top 10</p>

<p>Having said that I think Hakeem, if he managed his career like Lebron or was in LA, he would be a top 5 player. Luck of pairing with the right teammates and front office is important</p>

      <label for="lk6olql" class="commentText"><p>Front office wasn’t bad. They made finals in 86. Ralph Sampson just got hit with injuries. Then a couple of drug suspensions to other players. Turned it around in early 90’s. Won two championships.</p>

<p>Tried the Barkley trade, got close in 97. Pippen move after didn’t work.</p>

<p>Hakeem and rockets didn’t have great luck. Still did well with 2 rings.</p>

Wilt and Russell are affected by lack of competition, and Duncan was one of Kobe’s frequent victims in the 2000s. And Shaq? That’s crazy. Just plain crazy. Dude tore his house up when Kobe won his 5th because he knew what that meant 🤣</p>

If we’re going with the top 10 that people usually choose: Jordan, bron, Kobe, magic, bird, wilt, Shaq, Duncan, Kareem, Russell; the major difference is everyone on that list has 4+ rings, Hakeem has 2.

      <label for="lk6lv3u" class="commentText"><p>I think Hakeem is slightly underrated because he is often lumped together with Shaq and Robinson, two great players that Olajuwon beat head-to-head.</p>

<p>Top 10 is always gonna be nebulous but if you’re just talking about bigs, I think Hakeem deserves to be compared to the big 3 of Kareem, Wilt, and Russell. The beauty of GOAT sports debate is that you usually get to a point where players are cross-generational so there’s no way to really determine who’s the absolute best of the 4 (Russell and Wilt playing in different eras with less talent; Kareem playing on a dynastic team at a time with there were 2 great teams and 20+ also-rans; Hakeem having exceptional two-way statistics but was held back to some unquantifiable extent by less talent around him).</p>

<p>Personally, I think the biggest what if for Hakeem is winning the titles during Jordan’s baseball years. I think Hakeem would have absolutely cooked whoever the Bulls would throw at him (they never really had a great center in their dynastic years) and, if they had beaten the Jordan bulls, not only would Hakeem be consistently added to the wilt/Kareem/Russell tier of GOAT centers, but Jordan losing in the finals probably means that later in life, LeBron passes him as the consensus all-time GOAT.</p>

<p>But by the other hand, if Jordan stays and wins 8 straight, then fast-forward to present day and there’s a legitimate question whether Hakeem or James Harden is the best Rocket of all time. So yeah, big “what if”. Lot of variance in how that plays out.</p>

<p>Overall, top 10 isn&rsquo;t enough spots for how many great players we&rsquo;ve seen. IMO he is in that tier with Kobe, Duncan, Russell, Steph, Shaq. Top 10 worthy for sure</p>

The only argument anyone can try to make against MJ is “competition” (though I disagree) but that hurts Kareem even more. Otherwise if competition isn’t a sticking point, then MJ has far outclassed LeBron in every notable accolade in a shorter career and many major stats.

<p>He was a fantastic player and a dominant one but his prime was relatively short and the only reason he has titles to his name is because Jordan decided to play baseball for a bit.</p>

<p>He was a dominant Center of his era but I would dare to say his career path was far more similar to that of Dwight Howard than the one of Kareem or Shaq. Great build up and insane peak followed by immediate and very sharp decline.</p>

<p>He was obviously better than Dwight at his peak but he was not Kareem.</p>

<p>The only reason people take Hakeem over Charles Barkley is Sir Charles didn&rsquo;t get a chance to have his prime without Jordan in the picture.</p>

Jordan was a scoring Champion from second year onwards. Kareem, LeBron have more points than anybody and primes lasting 20 years.</p>

<p>What you mention are the markings of a great HoF level player. But we are still removed from the top 10 all time. He played in the top 10 all time level only for 2-3 seasons.</p>

<p>Top 7 in MVP voting for 5 years ain&rsquo;t cutting it. Jokic is amassing a better resume than him atm.</p>

      <label for="lk696kf" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s just funny to me that as soon as it comes to Hakeem, now everyone wants to talk about skill. Hakeem&rsquo;s accolades fall just short of being top 10 worthy. He simply does not have enough rings or MVPs to truly be solidified in that discussion. However everyone wants to put him in there solely because of his skill level and they will even put him ahead of people that have way more accolades than him. And for some reason this is only allowed when it applies to him. Because if I were to say I have Steph in the top 10 and above Magic because he was more skilled or I have Kobe above Duncan because he was more skilled, I would get attacked and everyone would be bringing up the accolades.</p>
