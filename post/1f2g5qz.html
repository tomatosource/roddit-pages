It&rsquo;s so subjective. My only thing, is if OP feels like Hakeem is in top 10 for sure, who does he remove and why ? this way there is a real discussion</p>

      <label for="lk6h762" class="commentText"><p>The goat conversation shifts between ages, but Russell is in the mix among the older crowd. To a certain extent it’s a popularity contest, so the more people grew up watching a player the better their standing is there. Before MJ blew up it was between Kareem and Russell, then it was a three way thing.</p>

<p>If we go by accolades, Russell has as many MVP awards as MJ and completely beats him out in rings. Russell was the best at winning, which depending on what goat means to people can massively boost him or seem irrelevant.</p>

I mean, if Hakeem were drafted to any of those franchises, do you think he would have won fewer championships? Hakeem was a better offensive and defensive player than Duncan. Hakeem beat Shaq in the Finals. Swept them in fact, with an inferior team. If you are using team accolades as part of it I think you are favoring some players drafted in better situations or with better management.</p>

      <label for="lk6hmpi" class="commentText"><p>Yup. Here’s a forgotten Hakeem fact:</p>

<p>In his second year in the league, Hakeem was the best player on a team that destroyed Magic/Kareem/Worthy Lakers in only 5 games. Hakeem have them 31/11/2/2/4</p>

<p>This took them to the Finals where the matchup with the 86 Celtics - their best iteration of the Bird era - and pushed them to 6 despite not having anyone else put up even 16ppg in the series.</p>

<p>Hakeem pulled all that off with his only star teammate being Ralph Sampson. Sampson was a star with sky high upside, but he wasn’t a superstar and didn’t make All-NBA or anything like that in 86.</p>

<p>You give a baby Hakeem just a <em>star</em> and that’s what happened. Then Sampson gets hurt and he has nothing to work with for nearly a decade. You let him play for years with teammates like Oscar, Magic, Worthy, Wilkes, etc like Kareem had and you’re telling me he doesn’t win a ton of extra rings?</p>

<p>Or Manu, TP, DRob, Kawhi, and Pop as the coach?</p>

<p>Having a young Kobe as your #2 option, or getting to run with Pippen, Rodman, and Harper with Phil Jackson?</p>

<p>Bird had such good teammates it was Cedric Maxwell who took home the FMVP of his first title let alone McHale, Parish, Tiny, DJ</p>

As far as which center all time I’d like to have on my team, I feel like Hakeem could be #1 or 2. But legacy-wise, he may not have the sheet counting stats that other guys do</p>

<p>This seems like a strange thing to say given he&rsquo;s #1 all time in blocks, and top 15 in pts, rebounds and steals as well.</p>

<p>KD is not (the Warriors move ruined his legacy and keeps him out of top 10 forever as does his constant &ldquo;super&rdquo; team hopping).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m biased though so I can see holes in my arguments too.</p>

      <label for="lk66ezv" class="commentText"><p>Kareem being completely removed from the GOAT conversation over the last couple of decades is astonishing to me. We marvel at LeBron’s longevity, but Kareem was a factor for 20 years, playing the post in a very physical era, after playing 4 years in college…and that gets forgotten. I grew up a Pistons fan, and I was 9-10 years old during the Bad Boys era. Kareem was scary even at 42.</p>

<p>I actually think he and Hakeem would be scarier now, with the emphasis on spacing. In their primes, both had good enough footwork and quickness to play on both ends of the floor, and I can’t see it being harder for them to score or rebound now than it was back then.</p>

      <label for="lk6e8si" class="commentText"><p>Kareem being the GOAT was always a fringe thing thanks to his relationship with media and he started gaining steam thanks to Lebron bringing longevity to the forefront of people&rsquo;s minds. His GOAT candidacy was subsequently squashed when Lebron beat him in longevity and he no longer has a real argument thanks to someone beating hin at his own arguments. It&rsquo;s similar to how Kobe automatically has zero claim to GOAT due to MJ being better or Curry being outperformed by Lebron H2H consistently. You can&rsquo;t be the GOAT if you&rsquo;re clearly #2 to someone else.</p>

      <label for="lk6cbfq" class="commentText"><p>There are like 12 names mentioned always in Top 10 list.</p>

<p>MJ, LBJ, KAJ, Magic, Larry, Timmy, Kobe, Shaq, Hakeem, Wilt, Bill, Steph</p>

<p>Among those 12, the only players getting serious GOAT Votes are</p>

<p>MJ and Lebron (Top Voters)</p>

<p>KAJ (distant 3rd</p>

<p>Wilt and Russell (The former because of his stats, and the latter for his rings as the best player)</p>

<p>So, that will leave,</p>

<p><strong>Magic, Larry, Timmy, Kobe, Shaq, Hakeem, Steph</strong></p>

<p>Usually, Steph is out for now for most people. Because of lack of all nbas (Luka surpassed him now, and Luka isnt even in his absolute prime yet), and multiple FMVPs</p>

<p>But there is one name to be kicked out left.</p>

<p>Usually, it is either Hakeem, Kobe, Shaq, or Timmy depending on what you value. (Magic and Larry are always in top 10 list I see)</p>

<p>Due to some circumstances, Hakeem has less success and accolades. Compared to Kobe, Shaq, and Timmy. But people can argue, he had tougher circumstances, and more bad luck.</p>

      <label for="lk670eb" class="commentText"><p>Who you gonna take out? that’s the problem. Shit is dense at the top and not a lot of room for anyone.  His problem is that his best years coincide with MJ taking a break. So we know he was not definitively the best player in basketball even when he was (sounds weird by you know what I mean). Guy is well respected but truth is MJ’s 90s had a weaker cast of superstars than at almost any point I can think of. MJ and Shaq are really the only 90s guys in that top 10</p>

<p>90s, 10s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 60s, 80s, 90s, 00s</p>

<p>10th is a toss-up 70s, 90s, 10s.</p>

<p>I don’t think Hakeem’s career was any sort of low point for superstar competition. His career overlapped 6 of those 9 guys (didn’t overlap James, Chamberlain, or Russel), although he missed the peaks of Duncan and Abdul-Jabbar.</p>

      <label for="lk67fdb" class="commentText"><p>Hakeem was the most complete player, dominate on both sides. He unfortunately didn’t have a front office that built enough for Hakeem to win every year. Top 10s are really about the best player along with the best achievements. You need both. Two rings just doesn’t cut it into the top 10</p>

<p>Having said that I think Hakeem, if he managed his career like Lebron or was in LA, he would be a top 5 player. Luck of pairing with the right teammates and front office is important</p>

<p>I have Shaq outside at 11. He was dominant but in a one dimensional I&rsquo;m literally bigger than yall kinda way and his career had a really tapered off end that doesn&rsquo;t even compare to Kobes</p>

<p>He was a fantastic player and a dominant one but his prime was relatively short and the only reason he has titles to his name is because Jordan decided to play baseball for a bit.</p>

<p>He was a dominant Center of his era but I would dare to say his career path was far more similar to that of Dwight Howard than the one of Kareem or Shaq. Great build up and insane peak followed by immediate and very sharp decline.</p>

<p>He was obviously better than Dwight at his peak but he was not Kareem.</p>

<p>The only reason people take Hakeem over Charles Barkley is Sir Charles didn&rsquo;t get a chance to have his prime without Jordan in the picture.</p>

      <label for="lk696kf" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s just funny to me that as soon as it comes to Hakeem, now everyone wants to talk about skill. Hakeem&rsquo;s accolades fall just short of being top 10 worthy. He simply does not have enough rings or MVPs to truly be solidified in that discussion. However everyone wants to put him in there solely because of his skill level and they will even put him ahead of people that have way more accolades than him. And for some reason this is only allowed when it applies to him. Because if I were to say I have Steph in the top 10 and above Magic because he was more skilled or I have Kobe above Duncan because he was more skilled, I would get attacked and everyone would be bringing up the accolades.</p>

      <label for="lk65x5k" class="commentText"><p>I agree with this. His championship runs were against some of the toughest opponents ever. He really didn&rsquo;t have much of a 2nd fiddle and all dominated during the era of big men. He also has records that might never be broken and 1 of 4 to have a quadruple double (probably should be 2).</p>
