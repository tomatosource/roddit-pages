<p>The current pantheon is like max 15 dudes and Hakeem is certainly in it IMO</p>

<p>Back end/fringe area there is like Big O and KD, and Hakeem is def above them</p>

<p>But yes I definitely agree that it&rsquo;s harder and harder to compare, and limiting at 10 is not realistic anymore because it devolves into ridiculous splitting of hairs (like have fun trying to make a clear argument as to which of Steph, Shaq, Duncan, and Kobe are/aren&rsquo;t top 10 since that group probably starts in the 8-9 range).  And yet here I am continuing to talk about it because I just can&rsquo;t help myself lmao</p>

      <label for="lk72fug" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t do GOAT debates <em>because</em> of the argument for championships. I understand the argument if a guy has no championships, but when you have 3+ championships to your name I really feel like everything after that is a moot point. Like people are so serious in their GOAT debates that they specifically say one player is better than the other because of more championships even it&rsquo;s literally 1 more championship.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not arguing for anyone&rsquo;s case here, but in my opinion championships should not be such a deciding factor, and when they are I think Finals MVPs are a much better thing to look at because the argument is for the <em>player</em> not for the <em>team.</em> MVPs is a fair thing to use in an argument, but it makes cross-era comparison much more difficult because you have to look at how many other players were in the running and what type of numbers they were putting up.</p>

<p>I just hate all of these top-10 debates and yet I always find myself in the center of them haha</p>

<p>There are points where the finals MVP result has been dubious or something worth debating, and that has made me feel as though it&rsquo;s not a good metric either. Kareem &amp; Magic in 80 is always at the forefront of my mind in this case.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s better to look at the players themselves and what value they brought to their teams, rather than purely counting stats or achievements. There&rsquo;s more to the game than the wikipedia pages after all.</p>

      <label for="lk84c92" class="commentText"><p>Oh I fully agree, I don&rsquo;t think Finals MVP&rsquo;s should be used. My whole point was that if championships are even going to be brought up at all then Finals MVPs would be a better thing to use than purely rings, IMO.</p>

<p>But that also only goes for the real GOAT debates. Because, for example, a player like Ben Wallace has a ring and he was an absolutely massive part of the team that got that ring, despite not winning finals MVP. But again, that&rsquo;s an entirely different debate because I think there&rsquo;s maybe <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> guys in the top 25 that don&rsquo;t have a ring in the first place.</p>

<p>But you&rsquo;re absolutely right, in a debate about the best player of all time Championships and similar accolades should absolutely be noted, but they should not hold more weight than the actual player&rsquo;s accomplishments and everything he contributed to the team.</p>

We marvel at LeBron’s longevity, but Kareem was a factor for 20 years, playing the post in a very physical era, after playing 4 years in college…and that gets forgotten. I grew up a Pistons fan, and I was 9-10 years old during the Bad Boys era. Kareem was scary even at 42.</p>

<p>I actually think he and Hakeem would be scarier now, with the emphasis on spacing. In their primes, both had good enough footwork and quickness to play on both ends of the floor, and I can’t see it being harder for them to score or rebound now than it was back then.</p>

      <label for="lk6e8si" class="commentText"><p>Kareem being the GOAT was always a fringe thing thanks to his relationship with media and he started gaining steam thanks to Lebron bringing longevity to the forefront of people&rsquo;s minds. His GOAT candidacy was subsequently squashed when Lebron beat him in longevity and he no longer has a real argument thanks to someone beating hin at his own arguments. It&rsquo;s similar to how Kobe automatically has zero claim to GOAT due to MJ being better or Curry being outperformed by Lebron H2H consistently. You can&rsquo;t be the GOAT if you&rsquo;re clearly #2 to someone else.</p>

<p>The idea that LeBron has superior longevity to Kareem is mostly based on LeBron going to the NBA straight from high school and Kareem playing 4 years of college ball (where he’s basically the undisputed GOAT). We don’t know where Lebron’s career will end up, but it omits some important details to claim that he’s conclusively beaten Kareem in terms of longevity already.</p>

      <label for="lk6ztnv" class="commentText"><p>Gotta disagree on your last point. Yes, Lebron came to the league earlier, but that also put A LOT more pressure on him at a young age.</p>

<p>Playing a 82 game schedule at 18 and doing it for 22 years (and I know that he missed plenty of games) is A LOT tougher on your body than college basketball at any point. The wear and tear is higher being in the league from 18-22 than going to college in the same time span. Especially in the 2000s, which was still very physical, but ugly basketball due to the many rule changes that messed up the game for 5+ years.</p>

      <label for="lk6z4b6" class="commentText"><p>Is it really that surprising? The issue with Kareem is that he wasn&rsquo;t considered the best player on his own team a 3-4 years after Magic arrived.  It&rsquo;s still crazy to me that Magic got the FMVP as a rookie, while Kareem was still the best player in that series&hellip;but Magic (and Bird) basically became the best 2 players in the league by their 3rd? or 4th year in the league.</p>

<p>Also, it will automatically hurt your legacy when you spend half of your career with the player that most people considered the 4th best player of all time (right behind Kareem). Magic is a lock for top 5 in almost every single GOAT list (and debate).</p>

<p>Kobe and Shaq also have that issue. It&rsquo;s difficult to separate those two from each other. Their greatness led them to those rings, but it automatically diminishes their individual greatness.</p>

<p>KD is in a similar spot as well. He went to the best team with one of the greatest players of all time and won as that teams best player, but those rings don&rsquo;t count as much to many people. It rarely gets mentioned when it comes to Curry&rsquo;s legacy, but he was more than willing to team up with KD, which led to more rings, but less individual accomplishments.</p>

<p>But I think most would agree that Kareem has the best overall basketball career. He was dominant in high school, college and the NBA. Lebron never went to college, so he is out of that discussion by default.</p>

<p>Is this disputable? I&rsquo;ve seen him as high as 5 or 6 on some people&rsquo;s lists, and with 1/2/3 being some order of bron/mj/kareem, I feel like 6 is a pretty damn high ranking in terms of respect.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s being really generous and I love Pau lol</p>

<p>Regardless, I&rsquo;ll give you 1994, but the 1995 Rockets pretty much lost nothing, had a lot of its younger players improve and added Clyde to the team</p>

Star power ? For example Kobe is an icon that is bigger than basketball and one of the biggest star the sport has ever seen. Does it play into its ranking ? For some people, Kobe is top 3. It&rsquo;s so subjective. My only thing, is if OP feels like Hakeem is in top 10 for sure, who does he remove and why ? this way there is a real discussion</p>

Picking MJ and LeBron and KAJ apart based on accolades, peak, longevity and collective success is a much more messy discussion of specifics.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d have him fourth on my personal ranking, but I&rsquo;d argue a lot less against someone picking Russell as number one than someone picking Kareem.</p>

I mean, if Hakeem were drafted to any of those franchises, do you think he would have won fewer championships? Hakeem was a better offensive and defensive player than Duncan. Hakeem beat Shaq in the Finals. Swept them in fact, with an inferior team. If you are using team accolades as part of it I think you are favoring some players drafted in better situations or with better management.</p>

      <label for="lk6hmpi" class="commentText"><p>Yup. Here’s a forgotten Hakeem fact:</p>

<p>In his second year in the league, Hakeem was the best player on a team that destroyed Magic/Kareem/Worthy Lakers in only 5 games. Hakeem have them 31/11/2/2/4</p>

<p>This took them to the Finals where the matchup with the 86 Celtics - their best iteration of the Bird era - and pushed them to 6 despite not having anyone else put up even 16ppg in the series.</p>

<p>Hakeem pulled all that off with his only star teammate being Ralph Sampson. Sampson was a star with sky high upside, but he wasn’t a superstar and didn’t make All-NBA or anything like that in 86.</p>

<p>You give a baby Hakeem just a <em>star</em> and that’s what happened. Then Sampson gets hurt and he has nothing to work with for nearly a decade. You let him play for years with teammates like Oscar, Magic, Worthy, Wilkes, etc like Kareem had and you’re telling me he doesn’t win a ton of extra rings?</p>

<p>Or Manu, TP, DRob, Kawhi, and Pop as the coach?</p>

<p>Having a young Kobe as your #2 option, or getting to run with Pippen, Rodman, and Harper with Phil Jackson?</p>

<p>Bird had such good teammates it was Cedric Maxwell who took home the FMVP of his first title let alone McHale, Parish, Tiny, DJ</p>

      <label for="lk6rzta" class="commentText"><p>He’s well above KD and it’s not close. He’s better than Shaq too when factoring in Lakers Shaq would be borderline unplayable. Shaq played against bums in his prime. The Nets had Todd McCullough starting against him in back to back finals is all I need to say about how garbage the center position was from about 1998-2003. Shaq gained weight so he wouldn’t be pushed around.</p>

<p>When I say Lakers Shaq should be borderline unplayable, I mean it. Players shoot the 3 way to well in today’s game to allow for Shaq to shoot 50% from the line. Hack a Shaq would be way more effective because now you’re getting <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> points back potentially every time he goes to the line. Imagine being up in the 4th by 15 points and then Steve Kerr sends in 4 bums to foul Shaq and force him to shoot 40-50 free throws in the fourth quarter so Curry can go <sup>12</sup>&frasl;<sub>30</sub> from 3 and win the game. The modern game where role players can actually shoot a 3 rather than having only 1-2 guys on a team as 3 point specialists makes Hack a Shaq extremely effective and would play Shaq off the court in the final 6 minutes of a playoff game.</p>

<p>Lakers Shaq would also get targeted and abused on the perimeter. Hakeem was elite at perimeter and interior defense. He would be amazing in any era. Can’t say that about Lakers Shaq. Hakeem is a better player than Shaq.</p>

      <label for="lk6prsf" class="commentText"><p>This is the proof that Hakeem is so underrated here lol.</p>

<p>Hakeem is in the argument for being the best center of all time with KAJ imo. Only other arguments other than those two is Shaq if you really value peak, or Wilt if you don’t devalue his era, but if so then you should have wilt or Russell as the goats lol.</p>

<p>I’m really not sure what kind of revisionism has happened but I don’t think anyone could’ve argued Kobe or Duncan being better overall than Hakeem until the last couple years especially Duncan.</p>

<p>The only argument with Hakeem should be if he’s top 5 and it’s not an argument that he’s top 10</p>

      <label for="lk6lv3u" class="commentText"><p>I think Hakeem is slightly underrated because he is often lumped together with Shaq and Robinson, two great players that Olajuwon beat head-to-head.</p>

<p>Top 10 is always gonna be nebulous but if you’re just talking about bigs, I think Hakeem deserves to be compared to the big 3 of Kareem, Wilt, and Russell. The beauty of GOAT sports debate is that you usually get to a point where players are cross-generational so there’s no way to really determine who’s the absolute best of the 4 (Russell and Wilt playing in different eras with less talent; Kareem playing on a dynastic team at a time with there were 2 great teams and 20+ also-rans; Hakeem having exceptional two-way statistics but was held back to some unquantifiable extent by less talent around him).</p>

<p>Personally, I think the biggest what if for Hakeem is winning the titles during Jordan’s baseball years. I think Hakeem would have absolutely cooked whoever the Bulls would throw at him (they never really had a great center in their dynastic years) and, if they had beaten the Jordan bulls, not only would Hakeem be consistently added to the wilt/Kareem/Russell tier of GOAT centers, but Jordan losing in the finals probably means that later in life, LeBron passes him as the consensus all-time GOAT.</p>

<p>But by the other hand, if Jordan stays and wins 8 straight, then fast-forward to present day and there’s a legitimate question whether Hakeem or James Harden is the best Rocket of all time. So yeah, big “what if”. Lot of variance in how that plays out.</p>

<p>MJ, LBJ, KAJ, Magic, Larry, Timmy, Kobe, Shaq, Hakeem, Wilt, Bill, Steph</p>

<p>Among those 12, the only players getting serious GOAT Votes are</p>

<p>MJ and Lebron (Top Voters)</p>

<p>KAJ (distant 3rd</p>

<p>Wilt and Russell (The former because of his stats, and the latter for his rings as the best player)</p>

<p>So, that will leave,</p>

<p><strong>Magic, Larry, Timmy, Kobe, Shaq, Hakeem, Steph</strong></p>

<p>Usually, Steph is out for now for most people. Because of lack of all nbas (Luka surpassed him in all nba first now, and Luka isnt even in his absolute prime yet), and multiple FMVPs</p>

<p>But there is one name to be kicked out left.</p>

<p>Usually, it is either Hakeem, Kobe, Shaq, or Timmy depending on what you value. (Magic and Larry are always in top 10 list I see)</p>

<p>Due to some circumstances, Hakeem has less success and accolades. Compared to Kobe, Shaq, and Timmy. But people can argue, he had tougher circumstances, and more bad luck.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not really a knock on Kobe - top 10 is just a very exclusive club. The top ~7 or so are pretty much inarguable (MJ, Lebron, KAJ, Wilt, Russell, Magic, Bird), and there&rsquo;s only more competition for the remaining 3 spots with every season.</p>

<p>For example, IMO Curry has achieved enough to be argued for top 10. Jokic may one day get there too if he can sustain his current production.</p>

<p>90s, 10s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 60s, 80s, 90s, 00s</p>

<p>10th is a toss-up 70s, 90s, 10s.</p>

<p>I don’t think Hakeem’s career was any sort of low point for superstar competition. His career overlapped 6 of those 9 guys (didn’t overlap James, Chamberlain, or Russel), although he missed the peaks of Duncan and Abdul-Jabbar.</p>

      <label for="lk67fdb" class="commentText"><p>Hakeem was the most complete player, dominate on both sides. He unfortunately didn’t have a front office that built enough for Hakeem to win every year. Top 10s are really about the best player along with the best achievements. You need both. Two rings just doesn’t cut it into the top 10</p>

<p>Having said that I think Hakeem, if he managed his career like Lebron or was in LA, he would be a top 5 player. Luck of pairing with the right teammates and front office is important</p>

<p>Tried the Barkley trade, got close in 97. Pippen move after didn’t work.</p>

<p>Hakeem and rockets didn’t have great luck. Still did well with 2 rings.</p>

      <label for="lk8241k" class="commentText"><p>Hakeem&rsquo;s body of work is a strange one.</p>

<p>There were long stretches where he was relatively inefficient as a scorer, even adjusted to his era. But he was also a solo star on his team, so it&rsquo;s a bit of the same argument you hear about AI. He always had the flashy post moves, but the fadeaways were far less efficient than his highlights would have you believe, and it felt like he could be bullied into taking more jumpers than looks directly at the rim.  Compared to his usage, his ability to draw free throws was pretty middling.</p>

<p>Then he found what really worked, especially in the playoffs, and had one of the great multi-year runs ever for a center, or for any star.</p>

<p>Top 10 comes down to how many centers you would put in the top 10.  I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s ahead of Kareem, Shaq, Russell, or Wilt.  But if half your top 10 is centers?  Sure. Though Joker is quickly climbing that ranking while being essentially the inverse center prototype.  And if you want to look only at a player&rsquo;s absolute peak year, then 94-95 Hakeem is in that conversation.</p>

<p>Personally I do have him as my defensive GOAT though, and I&rsquo;m glad he got the DPOY trophy named after him. Looking back at his Steal+Block numbers is still so crazy.  Would have loved to see him in the modern era, like Rudy Gobert if he had the speed to lock guys down on the perimeter too.</p>

<p>Hmm this isn&rsquo;t true. He wasn&rsquo;t hyper efficient throughout his career, but always above average up until the tail end of his career. You can see here in the TSAdd column or comparing his TS% to league avg TS%: <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/o/olajuha01.html#adj_shooting" target="_blank">https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/o/olajuha01.html#adj_shooting</a></p>

      <label for="lk8n4v2" class="commentText"><p>Compared to league average, yes he was a just a bit above average scorer. In his prime years, 26-29, he was in the low to mid double digits. But that is compared to league average of any player, any shot.</p>

<p>Compared to his peers, i.e. the great centers of that era? Those same stats don&rsquo;t hold up.</p>

<p>David Robinson had almost overlapping prime with Hakeem. His TS-added numbers dwarf Hakeem&rsquo;s. Hakeem&rsquo;s best years are less than half of Robinson&rsquo;s. Shaq&rsquo;s rookie year beats Hakeem&rsquo;s best years, and his 2nd year is 10x greater than some of Hakeem&rsquo;s prime years.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that Hakeem&rsquo;s game was bad. But I think there&rsquo;s a disconnect between how elite people say his post game was, and what the actual results were on paper. The beauty of the dream shake made a lot of defenders look like they had feet made of concrete, but it also ended in a low percentage fadeaway more often than the highlight reels show, and more often than the most agile center in NBA history ought to have settled for.</p>

<p>In a way, the amazing championship runs where he cooked every great center in the league also show the degree to which he wasn&rsquo;t maximizing his game all those other years.</p>

<p>EDIT: went and looked at one more comparison.  Different era, but another great center to consider.  People often put the Dream Shake up there with the Sky Hook.  But the Sky Hook was so unstoppable AND it yielded a very high FG% on a tough shot.  Kareem&rsquo;s TSadded stats are honestly insane.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/abdulka01.html" target="_blank">https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/abdulka01.html</a></p>

<p>The Dream Shake and Hakeem&rsquo;s ballet in the post just never came together as the same level of threat, as beautiful as it was.</p>

      <label for="lk6ue9v" class="commentText"><p>I think Hakeem is, if anything, a bit overrated, in the sense that he&rsquo;s one of those dudes where everyone is always saying, &ldquo;Is he underrated? He&rsquo;s underrated, right?&rdquo; and then always talking about how he probably belongs in the top 10 all time.</p>

<p>As someone who watched Hakeem, most of his amazing strengths (GOAT footwork for a big guy, Dream Shake/post game, blocks/steals) overshadow a lot of his weaknesses (absolute black hole on offense for a large chunk of his career, poor perimeter defense for how quick he was, hunting for blocks/steals and being out of position, bad temper).</p>

<p>Most fans don&rsquo;t remember 80s to early 90s Hakeem. They only remember the 2 year championship run, where he was at his absolute peak as the best 2 way player in the world, which was one of the greatest peaks for any big man, but his legacy received a bump more than anybody else&rsquo;s because of Jordan&rsquo;s retirement and the rapid expansion of the league in the early-mid 90s, which absolutely watered down rosters for a bit.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re splitting hairs here by default, because he is one of the greatest players of all time and we are comparing him to all of the other greatest players of all time. I think he is just outside of the top 10.</p>

<p>He benefits greatly from being one of the most athletically gifted and skilled players ever, and he has incredible highlights, so it&rsquo;s easy to romanticize who people wanted him to be rather than who he actually was.</p>

<p>Bill Simmons treating him like he was a mythological creature in all of his books and podcasts also has probably helped his legacy a lot.</p>

<p>The vibe of this post is probably coming off more negative than I&rsquo;d like it to be, but I think you have to judge guys on the career they actually had. Tim Duncan should be higher on the top 10 all time list, for example. If we do some sort of a fantasy draft where we are putting every player ever at their peak into the draft, building teams and playing a season, Hakeem is going to be drafted several spots higher than where he should be on the all time list because god damn, just look at him, and I think that&rsquo;s what people struggle with.</p>

<p>Especially, everyone remembers the Dream Shake and Hakeem defeating D-Rob on his way to the championship, but no one talks about how their matchups went across their whole career, which tells a different story (Hakeem is still greater, it&rsquo;s just that it was closer than it seems now). Hell even Shaq in the 95 finals gets misrepresented, he put up pretty comparable stats to Hakeem overall. Nothing to be ashamed of.</p>

<p>HAKEEM OLAJUWON </p>

      <label for="lk7lj6m" class="commentText"><p>Hakeem is probably the &ldquo;best&rdquo; center(peak Shaq may want a word but imo that&rsquo;s it) of all time. However he&rsquo;s not the greatest of all time if that makes sense. So he&rsquo;s routinely near the bottom end of the top 10 which I&rsquo;d about where he deserves to be.</p>

<p>Guys he&rsquo;s definitely not greater than, MJ, Kareem, Bron, Magic, Larry.</p>

<p>Guys he probably isn&rsquo;t greater than: Duncan, Shaq, Kobe.</p>

<p>Which really just leaves 2 spots and I&rsquo;m not mad at anyone for putting Hakeem there. This is also excluding Russell and Wilt.</p>

      <label for="lk7zqzj" class="commentText"><p>There was a thread a while back tracking about how Kareem has surged in the Top 10 lists, and many people didn&rsquo;t have him in the top 3 in the early 2000s. As our understanding of the game has changed, what we value in players has as well which can cause historical players to fluctuate more.</p>

<p>Hakeem is an interesting case, He&rsquo;d be a dominant isolation scorer, rim defender, and pick and roll disrupter. It&rsquo;s unclear what he looks like against today&rsquo;s defense rules. My hunch tells me it would look a lot like Joel Embiid where he is unstoppable one v one but his stickiness and lack of passing acumen would hurt him. Like Embiid, he&rsquo;d be spectacular but you do wonder about the passing.</p>

<p>Easily a 1A championship player, but as it pertains to where he&rsquo;d be in the top 10. For the record I love Hakeem and I think it&rsquo;d be a ton of fun to watch him play today.</p>

<p>Also LeBron and for some, Curry, have entered the top 10 and Hakeem used to be frequently around ~7 on a lot of people&rsquo;s lists.</p>

      <label for="lk81qks" class="commentText"><p>I really dislike GOAT discussions/top 10 discussions. It&rsquo;s apples and oranges. Do you take a top 2-way guard like Kobe or a 2-way post player like Hakeem? I don&rsquo;t know, what does your roster need? Is Steph better than Magic? I don&rsquo;t know. Do you need a shooter or a playmaker?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll compare him to other bigs, though. He&rsquo;s right up there with Kareem, Shaq, Duncan, Jokic &amp; Russell in terms of bigs you&rsquo;d want to build a team around. He&rsquo;s as good as any one of them on any given night.</p>

      <label for="lk9mac8" class="commentText"><p>I think his peak was ridiculously high. He just didn&rsquo;t have enough help in his career initially and when he finally broke through, his dominance didn&rsquo;t last past those two years. If he like Magic was given a contending team out of college, we may even be discussing him as the goat. </p>

I&rsquo;d say in my mind filrmly above him are Jordan, Lebron, Shaq, Tim Duncan and Magic Johnson. He&rsquo;s in line with KD, Kobe, Kareem, Wilt and Larry Bird. Throw in Curry, Bill Russell who are very polarizing on new school vs old school line of thought and he could be anywhere from 7-12 on the list</p>

      <label for="lk7a7hc" class="commentText"><p>I would say he probably doesn’t get enough credit. It’s kind of unfortunate that his career was so thoroughly eclipsed by Jordan. His 2 titles and 1 MVP came with an unspoken asterisk that Jordan had “inexplicably” quit in his prime to play minor league baseball.</p>

      <label for="lk8509x" class="commentText"><p>The 80s Rockets were set to join the Celtics and Lakers as a big time team after making the 1986 Finals, and Olajuwon would have had a much higher profile in the universe that happened, but they got absolutely destroyed by the double whammy of Ralph Sampson&rsquo;s injury woes and being one of the hardest-hit teams by drug-related suspensions and crackdowns.  In 1987, two significant rotation players, Lewis Lloyd and Mitchell Wiggins, received 2-year suspensions after they had already lost John Lucas to drugs one year before. Meanwhile, Sampson had played his final season of missing less than 20 games - he went from a 19 and 11 guy playing 79 games in &lsquo;86 to averaging 35 games a year from that point forward.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s basically four members of the 9-man rotation from their finals team ripped out of commission, and while they continued to be a marginal playoff team due to having a top-5 player in Hakeem, they never quite recovered until the supporting cast was completely rebuilt with Otis Thorpe, Vernon Maxwell and Kenny Smith in the 90s.</p>

<p>It was a lost ~5 years in Hakeem&rsquo;s prime that wasn&rsquo;t really anyone&rsquo;s fault.</p>

      <label for="lka00x0" class="commentText"><p>Also, Hakeem arguably wasn&rsquo;t playing team basketball and was a drsg on the morale and and chemistry in the early 90s after he got frustrated by dragging around a lousy team.</p>

<p>Then he had a year where he missed a couple of months. And while the Rockets initially looked awful without him, they soon started prospering and adjusted to where they were just as good without him. After that, he changed his attitude which seemed to rub off on the rest of the squad.</p>

      <label for="lk7eiw4" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d put him as the 4th best center:</p>

<p>Russell</p>

<p>Wilt</p>

<p>Kareem</p>

<p>Hakeem</p>

<p>So once you add Jordan in there, and maybe a couple of others, you&rsquo;re in the 7-10 range, but prime Hakeem (especially playoff Hakeem) was an absolute shut down and close out center.</p>
