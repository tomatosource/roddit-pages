<p>Regardless, I&rsquo;ll give you 1994, but the 1995 Rockets pretty much lost nothing, had a lot of its younger players improve and added Clyde to the team</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what most Laker fans say until I challenge them to name 10 better players in those seasons.  None have ever done it.  They tend to overlook the injuries that Garnett and CP3 had.</p>

<p>They traded their 2nd best player (Thorpe) for Drexler, and Maxwell went MIA.</p>

<p>As a result, they started 2 small forwards instead of a small forward and power forward.</p>

<p>I mean it&rsquo;s not that hard lol</p>

<p>Kobe, Lebron, Dwade, Dwight, Kd, Carmelo, Dirk, Nash, Duncan, Bosh just off the top of my head for 2010</p>

<p>And then probably plenty of guys with comparable output</p>

Russell is easily the most disrespected player of all time, but comparing one of the three goat candidates and the best defender to ever play the game with someone not clearly in the top is a reach.

      <label for="lk6h762" class="commentText"><p>The goat conversation shifts between ages, but Russell is in the mix among the older crowd. To a certain extent it’s a popularity contest, so the more people grew up watching a player the better their standing is there. Before MJ blew up it was between Kareem and Russell, then it was a three way thing.</p>

<p>If we go by accolades, Russell has as many MVP awards as MJ and completely beats him out in rings. Russell was the best at winning, which depending on what goat means to people can massively boost him or seem irrelevant.</p>

<p>Ben Taylor (the guy who does Thinking Basketball) laid it out about 5 years ago. The tl;dr is that Russell was the unquestioned best of his era for his ability to impact winning overall, and that the gap between him and the second-best defender ever is larger than the gap between, say, MJ and the second-best scorer ever:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the height of their dynasty, the Celtics were comically dominant. From 1962-65, their average margin-of-victory (MOV) was over 8 points per game. During the same time span, only two other teams even eclipsed 4 points per game – the ’64 Royals and the ’64 Warriors. And all of Boston’s separation was created by its historic defense, anchored by Russell:</p>

It&rsquo;s so subjective. My only thing, is if OP feels like Hakeem is in top 10 for sure, who does he remove and why ? this way there is a real discussion</p>

I mean, if Hakeem were drafted to any of those franchises, do you think he would have won fewer championships? Hakeem was a better offensive and defensive player than Duncan. Hakeem beat Shaq in the Finals. Swept them in fact, with an inferior team. If you are using team accolades as part of it I think you are favoring some players drafted in better situations or with better management.</p>

      <label for="lk6hmpi" class="commentText"><p>Yup. Here’s a forgotten Hakeem fact:</p>

<p>In his second year in the league, Hakeem was the best player on a team that destroyed Magic/Kareem/Worthy Lakers in only 5 games. Hakeem have them 31/11/2/2/4</p>

<p>This took them to the Finals where the matchup with the 86 Celtics - their best iteration of the Bird era - and pushed them to 6 despite not having anyone else put up even 16ppg in the series.</p>

<p>Hakeem pulled all that off with his only star teammate being Ralph Sampson. Sampson was a star with sky high upside, but he wasn’t a superstar and didn’t make All-NBA or anything like that in 86.</p>

<p>You give a baby Hakeem just a <em>star</em> and that’s what happened. Then Sampson gets hurt and he has nothing to work with for nearly a decade. You let him play for years with teammates like Oscar, Magic, Worthy, Wilkes, etc like Kareem had and you’re telling me he doesn’t win a ton of extra rings?</p>

<p>Or Manu, TP, DRob, Kawhi, and Pop as the coach?</p>

<p>Having a young Kobe as your #2 option, or getting to run with Pippen, Rodman, and Harper with Phil Jackson?</p>

<p>Bird had such good teammates it was Cedric Maxwell who took home the FMVP of his first title let alone McHale, Parish, Tiny, DJ</p>

      <label for="lk6qonh" class="commentText"><p>Rudy T&rsquo;s plays during 94-95 season were dump the ball inside to Hakeem, and he&rsquo;ll pass out when he&rsquo;s crowded, the others need to just make the shots when open. He had help with Drexler the next season, but his teammates weren&rsquo;t at the level of Duncan or Shaq when they won their championships.</p>

<p>Additionally, Hakeem&rsquo;s growth as a mature level headed player is also an interesting story itself. He was a hot-headed player with a really bad temper. It was easy to get into his head during his early years. He grew into a leader during those 2 championship years and got rid of his bad reputations.</p>

<p>Arguably, Shaq is probably the strongest player ever although Wilt might have something to say about that. But he never grew his game probably because he didn&rsquo;t need to. He would need to develop some fade-away or more reliable floater or hook farther away from the basket if he is to play in today&rsquo;s game.</p>

<p>Duncan was a beast. A lot of the youngbloods have never seen him play during his younger years. He was strong, fast, and had finesse, but stoic with a killer mentality. Probably the best 4 ever to play the game. His game was already almost complete in every facet when he joined the NBA. He polished it to perfection his whole career. The bank shots, the fade away, the handles, the blocks, the offesnive/defensive positionings, and awareness. But Duncan had Manu, and David Robinson, and Tony Parker, and a more mature Robert Horry, Kawhi Leonard, Avery Johnson, and others.</p>

<p>Hakeem was Duncan&rsquo;s predecessor. Of all the centers from the dinosaur age, Hakeem would&rsquo;ve transitioned easily into today&rsquo;s game. Imagine Embiid, but better in every way. Hakeem used to study point guards to see how he could incorporate guard moves into the center position. He would face up a defender and do crossovers to get to the basket, stop and run his dreamshake routines with the fake and counter and fake and counter moves. They were really poetry in motion. Or he could take a sweet hook, or take that smooth fade-away. He always thought that he was a guard trapped in a center&rsquo;s body.</p>

<p>This seems like a strange thing to say given he&rsquo;s #1 all time in blocks, and top 15 in pts, rebounds and steals as well.</p>

Kareem who is 2nd in points, 3rd in rebounds and 3rd in blocks despite them not recording blocks his first 4 years.</p>

      <label for="lk6rzta" class="commentText"><p>He’s well above KD and it’s not close. He’s better than Shaq too when factoring in Lakers Shaq would be borderline unplayable. Shaq played against bums in his prime. The Nets had Todd McCullough starting against him in back to back finals is all I need to say about how garbage the center position was from about 1998-2003. Shaq gained weight so he wouldn’t be pushed around.</p>

<p>When I say Lakers Shaq should be borderline unplayable, I mean it. Players shoot the 3 way to well in today’s game to allow for Shaq to shoot 50% from the line. Hack a Shaq would be way more effective because now you’re getting <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> points back potentially every time he goes to the line. Imagine being up in the 4th by 15 points and then Steve Kerr sends in 4 bums to foul Shaq and force him to shoot 40-50 free throws in the fourth quarter so Curry can go <sup>12</sup>&frasl;<sub>30</sub> from 3 and win the game. The modern game where role players can actually shoot a 3 rather than having only 1-2 guys on a team as 3 point specialists makes Hack a Shaq extremely effective and would play Shaq off the court in the final 6 minutes of a playoff game.</p>

<p>Lakers Shaq would also get targeted and abused on the perimeter. Hakeem was elite at perimeter and interior defense. He would be amazing in any era. Can’t say that about Lakers Shaq. Hakeem is a better player than Shaq.</p>

<p>Hakeem is in the argument for being the best center of all time with KAJ imo. Only other arguments other than those two is Shaq if you really value peak, or Wilt if you don’t devalue his era, but if so then you should have wilt or Russell as the goats lol.</p>

<p>I’m really not sure what kind of revisionism has happened but I don’t think anyone could’ve argued Kobe or Duncan being better overall than Hakeem until the last couple years especially Duncan.</p>

<p>The only argument with Hakeem should be if he’s top 5 and it’s not an argument that he’s top 10</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not arguing for anyone&rsquo;s case here, but in my opinion championships should not be such a deciding factor, and when they are I think Finals MVPs are a much better thing to look at because the argument is for the <em>player</em> not for the <em>team.</em> MVPs is a fair thing to use in an argument, but it makes cross-era comparison much more difficult because you have to look at how many other players were in the running and what type of numbers they were putting up.</p>

<p>I just hate all of these top-10 debates and yet I always find myself in the center of them haha</p>

      <label for="lk66ezv" class="commentText"><p>Kareem being completely removed from the GOAT conversation over the last couple of decades is astonishing to me. We marvel at LeBron’s longevity, but Kareem was a factor for 20 years, playing the post in a very physical era, after playing 4 years in college…and that gets forgotten. I grew up a Pistons fan, and I was 9-10 years old during the Bad Boys era. Kareem was scary even at 42.</p>

<p>I actually think he and Hakeem would be scarier now, with the emphasis on spacing. In their primes, both had good enough footwork and quickness to play on both ends of the floor, and I can’t see it being harder for them to score or rebound now than it was back then.</p>

      <label for="lk6e8si" class="commentText"><p>Kareem being the GOAT was always a fringe thing thanks to his relationship with media and he started gaining steam thanks to Lebron bringing longevity to the forefront of people&rsquo;s minds. His GOAT candidacy was subsequently squashed when Lebron beat him in longevity and he no longer has a real argument thanks to someone beating hin at his own arguments. It&rsquo;s similar to how Kobe automatically has zero claim to GOAT due to MJ being better or Curry being outperformed by Lebron H2H consistently. You can&rsquo;t be the GOAT if you&rsquo;re clearly #2 to someone else.</p>

<p>The idea that LeBron has superior longevity to Kareem is mostly based on LeBron going to the NBA straight from high school and Kareem playing 4 years of college ball (where he’s basically the undisputed GOAT). We don’t know where Lebron’s career will end up, but it omits some important details to claim that he’s conclusively beaten Kareem in terms of longevity already.</p>

      <label for="lk6ztnv" class="commentText"><p>Gotta disagree on your last point. Yes, Lebron came to the league earlier, but that also put A LOT more pressure on him at a young age.</p>

<p>Playing a 82 game schedule at 18 and doing it for 22 years (and I know that he missed plenty of games) is A LOT tougher on your body than college basketball at any point. The wear and tear is higher being in the league from 18-22 than going to college in the same time span. Especially in the 2000s, which was still very physical, but ugly basketball due to the many rule changes that messed up the game for 5+ years.</p>

      <label for="lk6z4b6" class="commentText"><p>Is it really that surprising? The issue with Kareem is that he wasn&rsquo;t considered the best player on his own team a 3-4 years after Magic arrived.  It&rsquo;s still crazy to me that Magic got the FMVP as a rookie, while Kareem was still the best player in that series&hellip;but Magic (and Bird) basically became the best 2 players in the league by their 3rd? or 4th year in the league.</p>

<p>Also, it will automatically hurt your legacy when you spend half of your career with the player that most people considered the 4th best player of all time (right behind Kareem). Magic is a lock for top 5 in almost every single GOAT list (and debate).</p>

<p>Kobe and Shaq also have that issue. It&rsquo;s difficult to separate those two from each other. Their greatness led them to those rings, but it automatically diminishes their individual greatness.</p>

<p>KD is in a similar spot as well. He went to the best team with one of the greatest players of all time and won as that teams best player, but those rings don&rsquo;t count as much to many people. It rarely gets mentioned when it comes to Curry&rsquo;s legacy, but he was more than willing to team up with KD, which led to more rings, but less individual accomplishments.</p>

<p>But I think most would agree that Kareem has the best overall basketball career. He was dominant in high school, college and the NBA. Lebron never went to college, so he is out of that discussion by default.</p>

<p>MJ and Lebron (Top Voters)</p>

<p>KAJ (distant 3rd</p>

<p>Wilt and Russell (The former because of his stats, and the latter for his rings as the best player)</p>

<p>So, that will leave,</p>

<p><strong>Magic, Larry, Timmy, Kobe, Shaq, Hakeem, Steph</strong></p>

<p>Usually, Steph is out for now for most people. Because of lack of all nbas (Luka surpassed him in all nba first now, and Luka isnt even in his absolute prime yet), and multiple FMVPs</p>

<p>But there is one name to be kicked out left.</p>

<p>Usually, it is either Hakeem, Kobe, Shaq, or Timmy depending on what you value. (Magic and Larry are always in top 10 list I see)</p>

<p>Due to some circumstances, Hakeem has less success and accolades. Compared to Kobe, Shaq, and Timmy. But people can argue, he had tougher circumstances, and more bad luck.</p>

<ol>
<li>The Russell-led Celtics defense was the best defense in NBA history, when controlling for era, by a MILE. And they never slipped even when other Celtics all-stars (Cousy, Heinsohn, Havlicek, Jones) were out.</li>
</ol>

<p>But when Russell was out, they dropped from a 59-win pace to a 35-win pace.</p>

<ol>
<li>Russell played, on average, more games against elite centers b/c the league was smaller, and he absolutely vaporized them. So in addition to being the greatest team defender ever, he was also the best 1v1 defender ever.</li>

<p>He&rsquo;s in the GOAT tier with Kareem, MJ &amp; LeBron.</p>

      <label for="lk67fdb" class="commentText"><p>Hakeem was the most complete player, dominate on both sides. He unfortunately didn’t have a front office that built enough for Hakeem to win every year. Top 10s are really about the best player along with the best achievements. You need both. Two rings just doesn’t cut it into the top 10</p>

<p>Having said that I think Hakeem, if he managed his career like Lebron or was in LA, he would be a top 5 player. Luck of pairing with the right teammates and front office is important</p>

<p>Tried the Barkley trade, got close in 97. Pippen move after didn’t work.</p>

<p>Hakeem and rockets didn’t have great luck. Still did well with 2 rings.</p>

      <label for="lk6lv3u" class="commentText"><p>I think Hakeem is slightly underrated because he is often lumped together with Shaq and Robinson, two great players that Olajuwon beat head-to-head.</p>

<p>Top 10 is always gonna be nebulous but if you’re just talking about bigs, I think Hakeem deserves to be compared to the big 3 of Kareem, Wilt, and Russell. The beauty of GOAT sports debate is that you usually get to a point where players are cross-generational so there’s no way to really determine who’s the absolute best of the 4 (Russell and Wilt playing in different eras with less talent; Kareem playing on a dynastic team at a time with there were 2 great teams and 20+ also-rans; Hakeem having exceptional two-way statistics but was held back to some unquantifiable extent by less talent around him).</p>

<p>Personally, I think the biggest what if for Hakeem is winning the titles during Jordan’s baseball years. I think Hakeem would have absolutely cooked whoever the Bulls would throw at him (they never really had a great center in their dynastic years) and, if they had beaten the Jordan bulls, not only would Hakeem be consistently added to the wilt/Kareem/Russell tier of GOAT centers, but Jordan losing in the finals probably means that later in life, LeBron passes him as the consensus all-time GOAT.</p>

<p>But by the other hand, if Jordan stays and wins 8 straight, then fast-forward to present day and there’s a legitimate question whether Hakeem or James Harden is the best Rocket of all time. So yeah, big “what if”. Lot of variance in how that plays out.</p>

      <label for="lk7eyfg" class="commentText"><p>Kobe MJ Bird Hakeem Lebron are my Top 5.</p>

<p>Championships and MVPs and other accolades are a circumstance of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your front office / coaching staff</li>
<li>Your teammate willingness to defer to you</li>
<li>Your willingness to defer to teammates</li>
<li>Your conference</li>
<li>Your team’s injury history</li>
<li>Your opponent’s injury history</li>
<li>Your own injury history</li>
<li>Your media narrative</li>
<li>Etc</li>
</ul>

<p>None of that relates to how good a basketball player you are, and there’s too much stochasticity there. Efficiency and stuff doesn’t even matter. If you win, you win. You can’t construct a valid counterfactual saying that if you were more efficient you would have won more. Maybe you’d score fewer points. Maybe your teammates would brick those shots, and your overall team efficiency lower. Etc, etc.</p>

<p>As long as you have demonstrated sustained success, that’s largely good enough for me — but even if you hadn’t, I’d take context into consideration. If KG stayed with the Wolves his entire career, I would not fault him for that. This is why T Mac is HOF despite accomplishing relatively little. Tony Parker and Manu sacrificed a lot playing their roles for 15-20 years. They should not be faulted for that. TD benefited from this sacrifice. He shouldn’t be credited as much as he has been.</p>

<p>Those 5 players have few to 0 holes in their games. Where they have holes, it appears to be by choice, or because their other skill sets were so polished that it was absolutely unnecessary to develop or showcase other things further. Jokic is fast climbing up my list of all-time players. KD and Pete Maravich sit high on this list for me. Ginobili is higher than most would expect for me. Kyrie, for all his handle and body weight shifting, is up there, but lacks a lot on the other side of the ball, in the post, and above the rim.</p>

<p>Comprehensive game are things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read defenses</li>
<li>Play passing lanes</li>
<li>Time / block shots</li>
<li>Rotations</li>
<li>Keep up man-to-man</li>
<li>Defend off ball</li>
<li>Defend the post</li>
<li>Defend the perimeter</li>
<li>Shoot 3s / long range</li>
<li>Shoot midrange</li>
<li>Flat foot vs fade away</li>
<li>Drive in both directions / off both hands</li>
<li>At the rim</li>
<li>Above the rim</li>
<li>Footwork</li>
<li>Acrobatic finished</li>
<li>Low Post</li>
<li>High Post</li>
<li>Back to basket</li>
<li>Triple threat</li>
<li>Shot fakes</li>
<li>Pick and Pop / Pick and Roll</li>
<li>Body weight and movement</li>
<li>Play off ball</li>
<li>Distribute</li>
<li>Transition</li>
<li>Score agnostic of defense</li>
<li>A showman’s criteria, but: telling defender what you’re going to do and doing it even though defender should be prepared</li>
<li>Etc</li>
</ul>

<p>I afford people like Shaq, Giannis, Harden, Wilt, Russell, Kareem the “dominant but considerably less skilled” title. Curry for me sits pretty high on both lists.</p>

<p>I think it’s crazy, the concept that if Ray Allen misses that shot in Miami, Lebron is viewed as a lesser player — because he has one less ring and one less FMVP. How his judgment depends on the performance of another player is crazy. Even crazier is the thought that TD would have 6, and he’d be elevated. Judgment of Tim Duncan changes based on a non-star player on THE OPPOSING team, and a play in which Tim Duncan had 0 involvement? Wasn’t even on the floor for? Crazy.</p>

<p>The criteria of all time player evaluation has always totally perplexed me. If you want to talk “greatest career” and such, cool. But even then you all are inconsistent.</p>

      <label for="lk6ue9v" class="commentText"><p>I think Hakeem is, if anything, a bit overrated, in the sense that he&rsquo;s one of those dudes where everyone is always saying, &ldquo;Is he underrated? He&rsquo;s underrated, right?&rdquo; and then always talking about how he probably belongs in the top 10 all time.</p>

<p>As someone who watched Hakeem, most of his amazing strengths (GOAT footwork for a big guy, Dream Shake/post game, blocks/steals) overshadow a lot of his weaknesses (absolute black hole on offense for a large chunk of his career, poor perimeter defense for how quick he was, hunting for blocks/steals and being out of position, bad temper).</p>

<p>Most fans don&rsquo;t remember 80s to early 90s Hakeem. They only remember the 2 year championship run, where he was at his absolute peak as the best 2 way player in the world, which was one of the greatest peaks for any big man, but his legacy received a bump more than anybody else&rsquo;s because of Jordan&rsquo;s retirement and the rapid expansion of the league in the early-mid 90s, which absolutely watered down rosters for a bit.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re splitting hairs here by default, because he is one of the greatest players of all time and we are comparing him to all of the other greatest players of all time. I think he is just outside of the top 10.</p>

<p>He benefits greatly from being one of the most athletically gifted and skilled players ever, and he has incredible highlights, so it&rsquo;s easy to romanticize who people wanted him to be rather than who he actually was.</p>

<p>Bill Simmons treating him like he was a mythological creature in all of his books and podcasts also has probably helped his legacy a lot.</p>

<p>The vibe of this post is probably coming off more negative than I&rsquo;d like it to be, but I think you have to judge guys on the career they actually had. Tim Duncan should be higher on the top 10 all time list, for example. If we do some sort of a fantasy draft where we are putting every player ever at their peak into the draft, building teams and playing a season, Hakeem is going to be drafted several spots higher than where he should be on the all time list because god damn, just look at him, and I think that&rsquo;s what people struggle with.</p>

I&rsquo;d say in my mind filrmly above him are Jordan, Lebron, Shaq, Tim Duncan and Magic Johnson. He&rsquo;s in line with KD, Kobe, Kareem, Wilt and Larry Bird. Throw in Curry, Bill Russell who are very polarizing on new school vs old school line of thought and he could be anywhere from 7-12 on the list</p>

<p>Kobe Bryant</p>

<p>Tim Duncan</p>

<p>Michael Jordan</p>

<p>HAKEEM OLAJUWON </p>

<p>These are their statlines for their highest scoring successful finals runs: </p>

<p>Kareem Abdul Jabbar: 31.<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>.0/3.3</p>

<p>Kobe Bryant: 30.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub>.9</p>

      <label for="lk6qnpf" class="commentText"><p>My opinion on the top 10 rankings is that the top 3 are LBJ, MJ and Kareem. Ranks 4-12 are up for grabs and very opinionated because different fans value different things. I think Curry will end his career in that range (or already is)</p>

      <label for="lk6r59d" class="commentText"><p>You have Lebron above MJ…and Kareem in Top 3? Feels a little inconsistent. The only argument anyone can try to make against MJ is “competition” (though I disagree) but that hurts Kareem even more. Otherwise if competition isn’t a sticking point, then MJ has far outclassed LeBron in every notable accolade in a shorter career and many major stats. Talk me through your reasoning (if you don’t mind)?</p>

      <label for="lk6feo3" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ll get downvoted because this is Hakeem appreciation post but I would argue otherwise, I think Hakeem tends to be overrated.</p>

<p>He was a fantastic player and a dominant one but his prime was relatively short and the only reason he has titles to his name is because Jordan decided to play baseball for a bit.</p>

<p>He was a dominant Center of his era but I would dare to say his career path was far more similar to that of Dwight Howard than the one of Kareem or Shaq. Great build up and insane peak followed by immediate and very sharp decline.</p>

<p>He was obviously better than Dwight at his peak but he was not Kareem.</p>

<p>The only reason people take Hakeem over Charles Barkley is Sir Charles didn&rsquo;t get a chance to have his prime without Jordan in the picture.</p>

      <label for="lk6fpxp" class="commentText"><p>He’s my 4th or 5th best all time behind Jordan, Lebron, and Kareem.  Maybe Magic maybe not.  Absolutely dominant defensively and a menace on offense.  Wouldn’t consider anyone else above him.  I know the old guys are there, wilt/russel/oscar, but it’s hard for me to understand that era so I put them just after Hakeem.</p>

      <label for="lk6z8z6" class="commentText"><p>For his complete skillset and dominance on both sides of the floor alone I would’ve ranked him top 10 for sure. For absolute peak season he’s also unquestionably in the top 10. But his accolades are bit lacking compared to other top 10ish players and that is a tremendously important factor when ranking top 10 all time. Personally I would put him at 12 behind Timmy, Shaq, Kobe and Steph but I’m fine with ppl putting him above Shaq, Kobe and Steph.</p>
