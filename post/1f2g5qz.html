Without even considering players like Steph or KD where their rankings is debatable still. I agree that Hakeem is underestimated from a popularity perspective, I&rsquo;m still not sure he&rsquo;s top 10 seeing the players ahead of him imo, and there&rsquo;s no shame in that</p>

Star power ? For example Kobe is an icon that is bigger than basketball and one of the biggest star the sport has ever seen. Does it play into its ranking ? For some people, Kobe is top 3. It&rsquo;s so subjective. My only thing, is if OP feels like Hakeem is in top 10 for sure, who does he remove and why ? this way there is a real discussion</p>

      <label for="lk67j04" class="commentText"><p>More than half of those players are either Celtics or Lakers. I mean, if Hakeem were drafted to any of those franchises, do you think he would have won fewer championships? Hakeem was a better offensive and defensive player than Duncan. Hakeem beat Shaq in the Finals. Swept them in fact, with an inferior team. If you are using team accolades as part of it I think you are favoring some players drafted in better situations or with better management.</p>

<p>Between 1970 and 1980 the league added 8 teams (going from 14 to 22). Plus with the ABA (existing up until 1976) there was a lot of top end talent in a different league.</p>

<p>The NBA talent pool was probably it&rsquo;s weakest in the 70s</p>

<p>and btw between 1989-2004 the league only added 4 teams, there wasn&rsquo;t that much expansion in the 90s</p>

      <label for="lk66ezv" class="commentText"><p>Kareem being completely removed from the GOAT conversation over the last couple of decades is astonishing to me. We marvel at LeBron’s longevity, but Kareem was a factor for 20 years, playing the post in a very physical era, after playing 4 years in college…and that gets forgotten. I grew up a Pistons fan, and I was 9-10 years old during the Bad Boys era. Kareem was scary even at 42.</p>

<p>I actually think he and Hakeem would be scarier now, with the emphasis on spacing. In their primes, both had good enough footwork and quickness to play on both ends of the floor, and I can’t see it being harder for them to score or rebound now than it was back then.</p>

      <label for="lk67fdb" class="commentText"><p>Hakeem was the most complete player, dominate on both sides. He unfortunately didn’t have a front office that built enough for Hakeem to win every year. Top 10s are really about the best player along with the best achievements. You need both. Two rings just doesn’t cut it into the top 10</p>

<p>Having said that I think Hakeem, if he managed his career like Lebron or was in LA, he would be a top 5 player. Luck of pairing with the right teammates and front office is important</p>
