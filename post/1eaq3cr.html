<p>This is related to Paul George&rsquo;s earlier comments today:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I was in LA, all I was hearing was I should’ve been a Laker. I was on the B team, that’s how the vibe and love felt. Now being in Philly, everyone appreciates me being here.</p>

      <label for="lenli6m" class="commentText"><p>The Clippers had been terrible almost the entire time Harper had been there though. Their win totals during the Harper years were 30, 31, 45, 41 and 27. They missed the playoffs in three of those years and were eliminated quickly in the 1st round in the other two. I&rsquo;m sure a lot of players would have felt locked up in that situation, especially given who their owner was back then.</p>

His business plan was pretty obvious: be in a hugely populated city filled with a lot of transplants who want to see NBA basketball without paying Laker prices and just collect huge checks by keeping costs as low as possible. For decades the most expensive free agent the Clippers had ever signed was Eric Piatkowski. The Clippers would draft players, they&rsquo;d play out their rookie contracts and then they&rsquo;d go elsewhere (if their career hadn&rsquo;t been totally derailed by injuries by that point, of course).</p>

      <label for="lenhg9q" class="commentText"><p>The thing that really changed everything for the Clippers was when the league gave them Chris Paul. This made them an actually relevant team for the first time ever, and people began paying attention to them. This meant that all the out in the open racist stuff that Donald Sterling had been doing for decades wasn&rsquo;t able to fly under the radar anymore, and the next time he did something it became a big news story. He&rsquo;d been doing that shit for decades and nobody cared because most people didn&rsquo;t know anything about the Clippers and may not have even known they were a team in the NBA.</p>

<p>In LA it was pretty much the same thing, where it was all Laker fans who never bothered to care about the Clippers as they were at the bottom of the league every year, and every time one of their players hit free agency they just left. Once the Clippers actually became a good team, then Laker fans started to take notice and the rivalry was on, which meant that Clipper players started getting shit around town. But yeah, back in the Ron Harper, Benoit Benjamin days, I guarantee you those guys could be out in LA and absolutely nobody would have a clue who they were.</p>

      <label for="lenmbxm" class="commentText"><p>It didn&rsquo;t really sound like PG was dissing the Clippers though, he was just talking about how being out in LA everyone hated him cause he played for the Clippers. It wasn&rsquo;t like he said the Clippers sucked and he hated playing for them, unless I missed something. Like you said, it&rsquo;s not really newsworthy to hear that LA is all Laker fans.</p>

      <label for="leni873" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s probably telling the truth, sort of, in that I&rsquo;m guessing nobody ever recognized him when he was out in LA during his Clipper days, so there probably weren&rsquo;t people giving him a hard time about playing for the &ldquo;B team&rdquo; or whatever.</p>

      <label for="lenjgph" class="commentText"><p>I mean, a theory could be that he was on the Clippers in the immediate aftermath of Magic&rsquo;s first retirement, and maybe that sent such a shockwave through the LA sports scene that everything got turned upside down for a couple years.  Those were the years when the Clippers actually had the better record and Harper was a big part of those teams.</p>

<p>But mostly I&rsquo;d have to guess that Harper is just trying to stick up for one of his old teams in light of PG&rsquo;s less than gracious comments.  PG could have said nice things about being in Philly without disparaging his time on the Clippers but he chose not to.</p>

      <label for="lenky23" class="commentText"><p>Harper was on the Clippers when they were 22 games under .500, 20 games under .500, then they had one year where they won 45 games, then back to .500, then back to 28 games under .500. The Lakers did miss the playoffs once during this period after Magic retired, but it wasn&rsquo;t like the Clippers were actually a good team and everyone jumped on their bandwagon. I remember being in LA in those days and still nobody was talking about the Clippers, they were talking about the young up and coming players the Lakers had.</p>

      <label for="lenlp26" class="commentText"><p>In 90 and 91, he played less than half the seasons.  I think that was when he tore his ACL.  So maybe he just wasn&rsquo;t exposed to the fans as much.</p>

<p>And then in 92 and 93, they had Larry Brown as coach and somehow managed to have the best record in LA both years.  Maybe that just by itself was enough to fuel his own hype, who knows.</p>

      <label for="lenn8qb" class="commentText"><p>I legit don&rsquo;t even know if the Clippers were on TV back then, didn&rsquo;t their local TV deal start sometime in the 90s? I really, really don&rsquo;t think anyone would have recognized Ron Harper if he was out in LA anywhere, and certainly nobody was invested enough in the Clippers to give him a hard time for being on the team if they saw him. There might have been a random Clipper fan every now and then who recognized him, but they weren&rsquo;t going to give him shit for being on the city&rsquo;s JV squad.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure Harper and the rest of the Clippers flew almost totally under the radar back then. It must have been wild for him to go from that to playing on the Jordan Bulls for three years and then the Shaq Kobe Lakers. Must have been night and day.</p>

      <label for="lenomi3" class="commentText"><p>per Wikipedia, their games were broadcast on KTLA Channel 5 in 90 and 91 (started broadcasting on KTLA in 1985), KCOP Channel 13 in 92-94 (and through 1996).  Mike Fratello was the color analyst in 90-92, Bill Walton took over in 93, and Ralph Lawler was the play-by-play announcer the whole time.</p>

<p>Channel 5 and Channel 13 were historic local stations so I&rsquo;d have to assume the Clips were on tv.</p>
