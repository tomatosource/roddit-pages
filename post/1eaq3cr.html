<p>This is related to Paul George&rsquo;s earlier comments today:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I was in LA, all I was hearing was I should’ve been a Laker. I was on the B team, that’s how the vibe and love felt. Now being in Philly, everyone appreciates me being here.</p>

      <label for="lenhg9q" class="commentText"><p>The thing that really changed everything for the Clippers was when the league gave them Chris Paul. This made them an actually relevant team for the first time ever, and people began paying attention to them. This meant that all the out in the open racist stuff that Donald Sterling had been doing for decades wasn&rsquo;t able to fly under the radar anymore, and the next time he did something it became a big news story. He&rsquo;d been doing that shit for decades and nobody cared because most people didn&rsquo;t know anything about the Clippers and may not have even known they were a team in the NBA.</p>

<p>In LA it was pretty much the same thing, where it was all Laker fans who never bothered to care about the Clippers as they were at the bottom of the league every year, and every time one of their players hit free agency they just left. Once the Clippers actually became a good team, then Laker fans started to take notice and the rivalry was on, which meant that Clipper players started getting shit around town. But yeah, back in the Ron Harper, Benoit Benjamin days, I guarantee you those guys could be out in LA and absolutely nobody would have a clue who they were.</p>

      <label for="leni873" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s probably telling the truth, sort of, in that I&rsquo;m guessing nobody ever recognized him when he was out in LA during his Clipper days, so there probably weren&rsquo;t people giving him a hard time about playing for the &ldquo;B team&rdquo; or whatever.</p>

      <label for="lenjgph" class="commentText"><p>I mean, a theory could be that he was on the Clippers in the immediate aftermath of Magic&rsquo;s first retirement, and maybe that sent such a shockwave through the LA sports scene that everything got turned upside down for a couple years.  Those were the years when the Clippers actually had the better record and Harper was a big part of those teams.</p>

<p>But mostly I&rsquo;d have to guess that Harper is just trying to stick up for one of his old teams in light of PG&rsquo;s less than gracious comments.  PG could have said nice things about being in Philly without disparaging his time on the Clippers but he chose not to.</p>

      <label for="leni103" class="commentText"><p>Someone downvoted you but it&rsquo;s 100% true. He often had to spend money at the end just to barely get above the salary floor every year. His business plan was pretty obvious: be in a hugely populated city filled with a lot of transplants who want to see NBA basketball without paying Laker prices and just collect huge checks by keeping costs as low as possible. For decades the most expensive free agent the Clippers had ever signed was Eric Piatkowski. The Clippers would draft players, they&rsquo;d play out their rookie contracts and then they&rsquo;d go elsewhere (if their career hadn&rsquo;t been totally derailed by injuries by that point, of course).</p>
