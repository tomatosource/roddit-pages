</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>In a thread discussing Bronny so far lack of success, I decided to look up how many of the last few 55th picks lasted. What you find is that a significant portion of the last 8 picks in the draft never even play an NBA game.  But if we specifically look at the 55th pick, you need to go back to 2011 before you find someone who had a substantial career in the NBA (E&rsquo;Twaun Moore played 10 years in the league).</p>

<p>2011 - E&rsquo;Twaun Moore played 10 years in the league<br>
2012 - played 7 games in the NBA<br>
2013 - played 4 years (208 games) in the NBA<br>
2014 - played 1 year, 64 games in the NBA<br>
2015 - Never player in NBA<br>
2016 - played 5 games in the NBA<br>
2017 - played 1 year (10 games) in the NBA<br>
2018 - played 2 games in the NBA<br>
2019 - played 3 years (53 games) in the NBA<br>
2020 - played 2 years, 33 games, out of NBA<br>
2021 - In the NBA (198 games so far) &ndash; Aaron Wiggins with OKC currently<br>
2022 - played 1 year, 23 games in the NBA<br>
2023 - played 1 games in the NBA (so far), mostly in G-league.</p>

<p>The reality is that most 55th picks are almost never NBA type talents.  Bronny may or may have a lasting NBA career. But if he doesn&rsquo;t, it would be the norm, not the exception. Most importantly it&rsquo;s completely normal for them to struggle.</p>

<p>For real though. Aaron Wiggins is so underrated and would be able to start on several teams. Had one of the highest TS% in the league last year, hustles his ass off. Dude was such a good get at 55</p>

<p>But the point was it took me looking back all the way to 2011 before a reasonable career could be found on that pick (caveat: it looks like A. Wiggins from 2021 might also last, but it&rsquo;s still early though).</p>

<p>But this highlights that &ldquo;not NBA talent&rdquo; is the norm for this pick.</p>

Given the health scare going into his freshman year, I really think the extra time in school would have helped. Hopefully he does get to learn and play through mistakes at the G-League level instead of just playing garbage time minutes.</p>

<p>college is full of, well, college bullshit. g-leaguers and NBA benchwarmers are part of the small group of the several hundred best basketball players on the planet</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t see any reality where spending several more months on a southern california college campus would help a young prospect focus on basketball more than bouncing for a late 2nd-round draft spot and being part of the actual NBA</p>

      <label for="ldsp8kt" class="commentText"><p>I agree, but I think its about raising your skill level in a way that lets you play with other players who dont outclass you so much you dont get a chance to develop.</p>

<p>Like say I wanted to take up wrestling. If I jumped to Olympic level opponents straight away id never get a chance to build any base skills, id jist get pinned/man handled by superior opponents.</p>

<p>If I started with lower level amateurs who wouldnt immediately pin me Id atleast get a chance to develop the skills against them I could then use against better opponents assuming I improve.</p>

<p>If the rest of the field is much more advanced its harder to build up the base skills youd need to compete against them in an environment where you get a chance to develop those skills</p>

<p>Does USC give that opportunity and is the coaching strong enough to develop him? </p>

<p>Idk, and I also think you have to weigh the chance that USC commits to stronger prospects and undercuts your development too. </p>

      <label for="ldsqrve" class="commentText"><p>A lot of it (to me at least) is how few roster spots are truly up for grabs each year and the uphill climb many would have for playing time being a late 2nd rounder. Plus now it is more common for teams especially in that range to use 2nd round picks on two-way deals which doesn&rsquo;t offer long term security as you could be waived in season with no guarantees past that. Though I&rsquo;d imagine this is truly all case-by-case for each individual player.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>A couple issues here:  Bronny isn&rsquo;t an NBA prospect. He&rsquo;s technically in the league, but he&rsquo;s not actually someone with a chance of staying in the league on their own merits.  Second, he didn&rsquo;t sign a two way contract, and the stated plan is to open the season with him on the main roster. Meaning he won&rsquo;t be going to the G League to develop, at least not initially.</p>

<p>I do think coming out this year was his only chance of making a roster, since lebron won&rsquo;t have the same leverage next year, but this is just about a fun moment for lebron, and has nothing to do with what&rsquo;s best for Bronny as a human or a basketball player. But maybe he&rsquo;ll like having a bunch of NBA vets clowning him non-stop!</p>

      <label for="ldsjj7f" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think people actually understand what college basketball is and the pros and cons for a basketball player to go from college to pro development system.</p>

<p>NCAA is a mess. Coaching turnover + transfers +  conf realignment make it tough to be certain what your experience will really even be like year to year.</p>

<p>If you have the chance to have an NBA staff committed to your development that is the way to go. It&rsquo;s not an option for everyone, there are 90 two way spots plus maybe another 50ish? roster spots teams will commit to development projects, but there is zero reason it would be better for Bronny to stay at the college level unless he just liked playing in college and wanted to do it for fun.</p>

<p>NBA used to suck at development, and college was the only real option. That is not true anymore and it is an outdated way of thinking.</p>

      <label for="ldsngus" class="commentText"><p>I mean the Lakers are basically being forced to develop him though, when looking at being the 55th pick in the draft many players come back to school because getting into those first 40 picks is far more lucrative AND with a more lucrative deal comes slightly more stability in that the team that picks you now has real incentive to develop you. So yes if your father is forcing the team to draft you and not cut you then yes you will &ldquo;develop&rdquo; certain skills faster in the NBA and NBA Gleague faster and better than you would in college.</p>

<p>That said Bronny could&rsquo;ve (even at the power conference level in my opinion) gotten reps as a primary creator in college this year and potentially developed into a first round talent, instead he will be pigeon holed into an undersized 3 and D 2 guard because that&rsquo;s all he can offer at an NBA Gleague level at the moment. Sure, his shot, which has been putrid so far, will develop faster under and NBA staff, but he will get far fewer game reps as a primary creator than he could&rsquo;ve in college.</p>

      <label for="ldspe84" class="commentText"><p>I’d say 1 in every 10 players drafted in the late 2nd round (picks 51-60) have a chance at having a long term role in the nba.  Most of those players being bench players, outside of Ginobli and IT, there aren’t many starters drafted in the last 10.  It’s not out of this world to think that Bronny can develop a decent shot and become a Davion Mitchell type of player, giving him a shot at the nba</p>

<p>And for those mad about the contract, it’s pretty standard for 2nd rounders now.  At least for the raptors, Jonathan Mogbo and Jamal Shead each got 3 years 6.1 million, which is a higher AAV than Bronny’s deal</p>

<li><p>Comparing him as a prospect to any 50s range pick, he may be the worst. Look at some of those guys, they all had some case to being drafted and were much better prospects. Isaiah Wong came off a final four run with really good stats, Kyle Guy was an elite shooter on a championship Virginia team, Marcus Paige and Nigel Williams Goss were the starting PGs on national championship losing teams</p></li>

      <label for="ldsnwub" class="commentText"><p>I disagree I think the second rounders are nba type talents but they dont stick in the nba for multitude of reasons. It could be that they have better opportunity overseas whether it be more money or more playing time or they get replaced by cheaper talent. Why would teams want to pay the next contract when they can just replace it with a rookie contract. Additionally there are so many &ldquo;nba level&rdquo; talents that do not play in the nba and its because they are unable to play a role. Think Jahlil Okafor who was an absolute bucket on for the sixers but he couldn&rsquo;t play any other way other than post up scoring. Shooting and defense were a huge issue as well but no one was stopping that guy from scoring the ball.</p>

<p>Melo during his down years after OKC was still an nba level talent and still a bucket getter(ball stopper) but he could never transition into a role player and that is why he could never transition successfully in the backend of his career.. He was a one trick pony as just a scorer and provided nothing else.</p>

<p>Another more recent example would be someone like Sharife Cooper he was a phenomenal lead ball handler guard but he was maybe the 50th-60th lead guard in the world and in the nba there are only 30 lead guards and everyone else has to play a role and as a backup teams would want a more versatile piece to complement there best player and he couldn&rsquo;t play defense or shoot the ball at a nba level. He is still a nba level talent just others are better at his job than he was.</p>

<p>Put it like this if you&rsquo;re the 30th best player PnR guard in the world then your team is probably not very good and they are more of a supporting piece or a role player or running the bench offense. Hell they might not even be in the league cause they can&rsquo;t play a role beside being a lead guard (play defense or shoot the ball at a high level, role player tings)</p>

<p>Additionally I say all this just to state that there are players overseas that are NBA level talents that just play overseas. Look at the Drew League where NBA players go they don&rsquo;t win every game and the players there are definitely able to keep up with them(no they are not better or even in the same conversation). But Frank Nitty outplayed Denzal Valentine who was an NBA player and one of the best college players in his time.</p>

<p>All this to say No Bronny is not an nba level talent, but he will get a lot more chances and opportunities than other player to develop into one. See Austin Rivers who was not a good player but was able to transition into a role player as his dad kept him in the NBA.</p>

<p>Paying him $7.9 mil for 4 years was absurd.</p>

<p>Gotta make sure he’s there when his brother is drafted though. Lebron is gonna do this again in 2 years so don’t act surprised when it happens again lol</p>

<p>you think this is absurd because you aren&rsquo;t paying attention. The new CBA created a contract for second round picks called the Second Round Exception. They can be either 3 or 4 years. By signing him to the second round exception it means his contract doesn&rsquo;t count against the cap and it gives the Lakers more flexibility in free agency.</p>

<p>Nearly every second round pick that has signed a contract so far this offseason has used the Second Round Exception and has a nearly identical contract to Bronny. Its beneficial to both teams and players, which is why so many teams are using it.</p>

<p>It was exactly the same last year, both the 57th and 58th pick got the <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>.6 contract (the value increases slightly every year)</p>

      <label for="ldslba3" class="commentText"><p>Right now - sure. 45k to be precise.</p>

<p>But to my understanding the Rookie contracts start counting against the Cap by August 1st.</p>

<p>If that is correct the Lakers will be over the second apron.</p>

<p>The new CBA is a bit complicated so I might be wrong&hellip;</p>

And the other side is the league, owners and other players take their share of the money from league merch.  And in a week James Jr jerseys made 50 million bucks.   That&rsquo;s more than I bet you an average class of 2nd round players will bring to the NBA in terms of revenue&hellip; so no issue at all that he wanted the most he could get.</p>

      <label for="ldsj4l3" class="commentText"><p>This is why second picks are going to be a lot more valuable the longer this CBA is in effect. Teams that are hars strapped will eventually trade their bottom first round picks for second round picks. If your picking 28 and the cap is looming you could benefit by trading back to a high second pick 1 for 1, then throw in some more 2nd round picks that are protected to make it look nice which would never convey or be so far back in the second round that it doesnt matter.</p>

<p>When LeBron leaves, the fact that they bent over backward for him like this will absolutely be a part of their pitch for the next stars that come available. That will appeal to some players, and as a Mom n Pop organization (relative to other teams) they need that sort of reputation.</p>

They could have picked a player that had a chance to help their team and signed Bronny as a free agent.  Knicks picked 2 guys after Bronny that actually have a chance to contribute in the next few years.  But they&rsquo;re trying to win, I&rsquo;m not sure what the Lakers are doing.</p>

<p>Teams will use a late 2nd on a guy from Europe who has no intention of the NBA not just in the hope for a 1 in a million shot he does decide to come over for less, but also knowing he likely will remain in Europe and the team won&rsquo;t need to pay him a salary on that pick.</p>
