</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>In a thread discussing Bronny so far lack of success, I decided to look up how many of the last few 55th picks lasted. What you find is that a significant portion of the last 8 picks in the draft never even play an NBA game.  But if we specifically look at the 55th pick, you need to go back to 2011 before you find someone who had a substantial career in the NBA (E&rsquo;Twaun Moore played 10 years in the league).</p>

<p>2011 - E&rsquo;Twaun Moore played 10 years in the league<br>
2012 - played 7 games in the NBA<br>
2013 - played 4 years (208 games) in the NBA<br>
2014 - played 1 year, 64 games in the NBA<br>
2015 - Never player in NBA<br>
2016 - played 5 games in the NBA<br>
2017 - played 1 year (10 games) in the NBA<br>
2018 - played 2 games in the NBA<br>
2019 - played 3 years (53 games) in the NBA<br>
2020 - played 2 years, 33 games, out of NBA<br>
2021 - In the NBA (198 games so far) &ndash; Aaron Wiggins with OKC currently<br>
2022 - played 1 year, 23 games in the NBA<br>
2023 - played 1 games in the NBA (so far), mostly in G-league.</p>

<p>The reality is that most 55th picks are almost never NBA type talents.  Bronny may or may have a lasting NBA career. But if he doesn&rsquo;t, it would be the norm, not the exception. Most importantly it&rsquo;s completely normal for them to struggle.</p>

Given the health scare going into his freshman year, I really think the extra time in school would have helped. Hopefully he does get to learn and play through mistakes at the G-League level instead of just playing garbage time minutes.</p>

<p>college is full of, well, college bullshit. g-leaguers and NBA benchwarmers are part of the small group of the several hundred best basketball players on the planet</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t see any reality where spending several more months on a southern california college campus would help a young prospect focus on basketball more than bouncing for a late 2nd-round draft spot and being part of the actual NBA</p>

More than anything, Bronny needs to develop a scoring mentality and get more reps as a lead/secondary ballhandler. </p>

<p>Does USC give that opportunity and is the coaching strong enough to develop him? </p>

<p>Idk, and I also think you have to weigh the chance that USC commits to stronger prospects and undercuts your development too. </p>

<p>NCAA is a mess. Coaching turnover + transfers +  conf realignment make it tough to be certain what your experience will really even be like year to year.</p>

<p>If you have the chance to have an NBA staff committed to your development that is the way to go. It&rsquo;s not an option for everyone, there are 90 two way spots plus maybe another 50ish? roster spots teams will commit to development projects, but there is zero reason it would be better for Bronny to stay at the college level unless he just liked playing in college and wanted to do it for fun.</p>

<p>NBA used to suck at development, and college was the only real option. That is not true anymore and it is an outdated way of thinking.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>you think this is absurd because you aren&rsquo;t paying attention. The new CBA created a contract for second round picks called the Second Round Exception. They can be either 3 or 4 years. By signing him to the second round exception it means his contract doesn&rsquo;t count against the cap and it gives the Lakers more flexibility in free agency.</p>

<p>Nearly every second round pick that has signed a contract so far this offseason has used the Second Round Exception and has a nearly identical contract to Bronny. Its beneficial to both teams and players, which is why so many teams are using it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.spotrac.com/nba/draft/_/year/2024/round/2/sort/pick" target="_blank">https://www.spotrac.com/nba/draft/_/year/2024/round/2/sort/pick</a></p>

<p>It was exactly the same last year, both the 57th and 58th pick got the <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>.6 contract (the value increases slightly every year)</p>

      <label for="ldsj4l3" class="commentText"><p>This is why second picks are going to be a lot more valuable the longer this CBA is in effect. Teams that are hars strapped will eventually trade their bottom first round picks for second round picks. If your picking 28 and the cap is looming you could benefit by trading back to a high second pick 1 for 1, then throw in some more 2nd round picks that are protected to make it look nice which would never convey or be so far back in the second round that it doesnt matter.</p>

<p>When LeBron leaves, the fact that they bent over backward for him like this will absolutely be a part of their pitch for the next stars that come available. That will appeal to some players, and as a Mom n Pop organization (relative to other teams) they need that sort of reputation.</p>

      <label for="ldsc934" class="commentText"><p>Still trying to figure out why they wasted a draft pick on him at all? Are they trying to win this year?  They could have picked a player that had a chance to help their team and signed Bronny as a free agent.  Knicks picked 2 guys after Bronny that actually have a chance to contribute in the next few years.  But they&rsquo;re trying to win, I&rsquo;m not sure what the Lakers are doing.</p>

<p>I wish a more deserving guy got the chance to wash out of the league tho. It could have been any of the next 50 guys, but at the end of the day someone down the line missed a chance to get Summer League exposure because “JAMES”</p>

      <label for="ldsk9zf" class="commentText"><p>No it wasnt a big deal at all. Agents manipulate where guys fall in the 2nd round all the time. It just doesn&rsquo;t get run as a story because no one cares about the fact that players they have never heard of and wont make the league want to play in Detroit instead of Orlando because they think have a chance at more playing time.</p>
