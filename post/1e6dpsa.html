</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>In a thread discussing Bronny so far lack of success, I decided to look up how many of the last few 55th picks lasted. What you find is that a significant portion of the last 8 picks in the draft never even play an NBA game.  But if we specifically look at the 55th pick, you need to go back to 2011 before you find someone who had a substantial career in the NBA (E&rsquo;Twaun Moore played 10 years in the league).</p>

<p>2011 - E&rsquo;Twaun Moore played 10 years in the league<br>
2012 - played 7 games in the NBA<br>
2013 - played 4 years (208 games) in the NBA<br>
2014 - played 1 year, 64 games in the NBA<br>
2015 - Never player in NBA<br>
2016 - played 5 games in the NBA<br>
2017 - played 1 year (10 games) in the NBA<br>
2018 - played 2 games in the NBA<br>
2019 - played 3 years (53 games) in the NBA<br>
2020 - played 2 years, 33 games, out of NBA<br>
2021 - In the NBA (198 games so far) &ndash; Aaron Wiggins with OKC currently<br>
2022 - played 1 year, 23 games in the NBA<br>
2023 - played 1 games in the NBA (so far), mostly in G-league.</p>

<p>The reality is that most 55th picks are almost never NBA type talents.  Bronny may or may have a lasting NBA career. But if he doesn&rsquo;t, it would be the norm, not the exception. Most importantly it&rsquo;s completely normal for them to struggle.</p>

      <label for="ldt8fk0" class="commentText"><p>I mean, would it really change much? Most of us will have never even heard of the player. The 2013 pick was Joffrey Lauvergne who I couldn&rsquo;t have even told you which teams he played for. I barely remember him mentioned in passing once or twice. Out of these players, it&rsquo;s literally just Moore and Wiggins who had any relevance.</p>

      <label for="ldtlj5m" class="commentText"><p>Williams Goss, Lauvergne, Lalanne had really good careers outside of the NBA. Getting picked in 2nd round in general doesn’t translate in a contract, it’s more like an opportunity to get into a private sesh with the team and some minutes in Summer League if the team is willing to give it a shot. That’s why most of 2nd rounders prefer to go elsewhere to get a real contract.</p>

<p>But the point was it took me looking back all the way to 2011 before a reasonable career could be found on that pick (caveat: it looks like A. Wiggins from 2021 might also last, but it&rsquo;s still early though).</p>

<p>But this highlights that &ldquo;not NBA talent&rdquo; is the norm for this pick.</p>

The fact that GMs miss this late doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that taking a player for non basketball reasons is reducing your opportunities to find that guy. Even using your analysis you&rsquo;re looking at a 25% chance of getting a rotational piece (discounting last year, because it&rsquo;s way too early, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> picks hit. you had Moore, Wiggins, and Lauvergne as guys who were legitimate nba players. Lauvergne eventually chose Europe over continuing in the NBA). Compare that to tanking, which is generally considered the best way to build a team, and only gets you a 15% chance at the number one overall pick.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s true for pretty much every 2nd round pick,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>hard disagree on this one. The 31st pick, you should expect at least <em>some</em> capacity to at least play some game for stretches of time. And the vast majority of 31st picks go one to have from OK to decent careers.</p>

<p>From 2009 to 2022 only 3 of those picks never really did anything. And the other 11 had from decent to good careers. Whereas most of the 55th picks were generally unplayable.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;m trying to get at is that the later the pick, the worse the likelihood of anything good coming out of that pick. So you shouldn&rsquo;t really paint the entire second round with the same brush. Patty Mills is a huge outlier in this case. Whereas <em>not</em> being a half decent player out of the 31st pick is the outlier.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like, you shouldn&rsquo;t expect the same results out of a top 5 pick vs the 25th pick.</p>

Given the health scare going into his freshman year, I really think the extra time in school would have helped. Hopefully he does get to learn and play through mistakes at the G-League level instead of just playing garbage time minutes.</p>

      <label for="ldsp8kt" class="commentText"><p>I agree, but I think its about raising your skill level in a way that lets you play with other players who dont outclass you so much you dont get a chance to develop.</p>

<p>Like say I wanted to take up wrestling. If I jumped to Olympic level opponents straight away id never get a chance to build any base skills, id jist get pinned/man handled by superior opponents.</p>

<p>If I started with lower level amateurs who wouldnt immediately pin me Id atleast get a chance to develop the skills against them I could then use against better opponents assuming I improve.</p>

<p>If the rest of the field is much more advanced its harder to build up the base skills youd need to compete against them in an environment where you get a chance to develop those skills</p>

      <label for="ldt05cx" class="commentText"><p>having worked in a major D1 basketball program for two years long ago, I disagree with this completely</p>

<p>if a g-league or two-way player&rsquo;s sorely lacking in fundamentals, they&rsquo;ll hopefully have the time, energy, and professional help to learn the basics, develop good technique, and drill drill drill over and over until they&rsquo;ve got the fundamentals down</p>

<p>if a college player&rsquo;s lacking in fundamentals, they have only limited time and energy outside of the rest of their life. and the not-always-that-great college coaches and player development staff won&rsquo;t be as experienced or likely as available, either.</p>

<p>from a basketball standpoint, i cannot imagine a scenario where staying in college would help a prospect develop better than the g-league would, in 2024</p>

<p>Bronny is an undersized guard with an unfortunate history of illness. He’s pretty much maxed out his athletic ability already, all he can improve on are his skills, and he will never get to NBA level by playing on a trash college team. Even if it seems hopeless, Bronny’s only chance of ever becoming good enough for the NBA is by playing with/against others who are already at that level</p>

More than anything, Bronny needs to develop a scoring mentality and get more reps as a lead/secondary ballhandler. </p>

<p>Does USC give that opportunity and is the coaching strong enough to develop him? </p>

<p>Idk, and I also think you have to weigh the chance that USC commits to stronger prospects and undercuts your development too. </p>

<p>bronny wouldn&rsquo;t get anywhere near the individual attention or instruction he can at the professional level.</p>

<p>and as far as opportunities, technically you&rsquo;re right, but i don&rsquo;t know how much of an opportunity it is to play against big 10 bench scrubs compared to scrimmaging and playing against borderline NBA players in the g-league, some of whom have years of pro ball experience</p>

Plus now it is more common for teams especially in that range to use 2nd round picks on two-way deals which doesn&rsquo;t offer long term security as you could be waived in season with no guarantees past that.

<p>A couple issues here:  Bronny isn&rsquo;t an NBA prospect. He&rsquo;s technically in the league, but he&rsquo;s not actually someone with a chance of staying in the league on their own merits.  Second, he didn&rsquo;t sign a two way contract, and the stated plan is to open the season with him on the main roster. Meaning he won&rsquo;t be going to the G League to develop, at least not initially.</p>

<p>I do think coming out this year was his only chance of making a roster, since lebron won&rsquo;t have the same leverage next year, but this is just about a fun moment for lebron, and has nothing to do with what&rsquo;s best for Bronny as a human or a basketball player. But maybe he&rsquo;ll like having a bunch of NBA vets clowning him non-stop!</p>

<p>as a human being? yeah staying in college could have been a type of fun experience he&rsquo;ll now miss out on by leaving while still college-aged. i mean it could also be hazardous, as college can be.</p>

<p>but as a basketball player? i think it&rsquo;s silly to imply there&rsquo;s a better place for a basketball player to develop than in an NBA-organized developmental league</p>

<p>it complete non-sense. As a former competitive runner (ran college, no where near olympic level) my best year running was when I was unemployed (I had to wait a few months for this other extra training to start). For a dedicated person, spending extra time getting your body right, massage, extra weights/body work. More rest and sleep&hellip; makes a ton of difference.  And that&rsquo;s before you factor in the extra time putting shots up he can get&hellip; instead of studying for a mid-term.</p>

<p>The only possible &ldquo;advantage&rdquo; is come college programs have higher visibility (especially during march madness) and maybe high stakes games that can make your name a house hold one (think JJ Reddick at Duke).  And depending on your level, maybe playing time (depending on the player I imagine).</p>

<p>But from an athlete perspective? College has almost no advantages over a pro-team (as long as the pro team has actual funding).</p>

      <label for="ldsww7n" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not black &amp; white, definitely a case-by-case basis and NIL also makes the financial situations tip in favor of staying in college in some cases (Armando Bacot for example made bank being a UNC stud but has no real NBA future). Generally I agree with you that in modern times with the emphasis of player development and the increased resources and quality of coaching and ingenuity in the G League, that guys are probably better off leaving school early. The catch tho is that succeeding in the NBA isn&rsquo;t always about purely how skilled you are, there&rsquo;s a lot of luck involved in terms of the situations you&rsquo;re drafted/placed into.</p>

<p>For some guys, instead of getting lost in the shuffle out of the spotlight in the G League or at the end of an NBA bench pigeon-holed into a role they dont necessarily fit or arent comfortable with, the extra time in college rounding out their game can allow them to come into the league a more ready player in their particular style and give them a different leash developmentally. There&rsquo;s also the sort of intentional paradox of younger, more raw players getting drafted higher and losing their way in bad organizations whereas upperclassmen are getting drafted by playoff teams with competent structure and good vets around them to show them the way.</p>

<p>In Bronny&rsquo;s case in particular, yea just go play with your dad while you have the chance. You never know what life will bring and you dont wanna pass that up for more uncertainty on a mediocre college team.</p>

      <label for="ldti6o4" class="commentText"><p>the only benefit of developing in college is that allows you to get a higher draft pick&hellip; in a pro setting, you will 100% develop more quickly than in college. you have <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> to focus on basketball, you&rsquo;re playing/practicing against exponentially better competition, and you have access to much more resources in terms of advice/coaching/support.</p>

<p>the big caveat here of course is that as a pro, there&rsquo;s a lot more onus on YOU to want to improve. in college, you can kinda be forced to develop (maybe less today than in generations past). as a pro: if you want to fuck up ur life, or not care as much about basketball, or dick around, then of course you won&rsquo;t develop. but if any random 55th pick, Bronny included, says: &ldquo;i&rsquo;m committed to being the absolute best basketball player possible given my own intelligence/body/athleticism&rdquo; then they&rsquo;ll have a much better and easier time getting to that point as a pro than staying in college more years.</p>

<p>bronny trying to go to the NBA as quickly as possible is a fine choice, and as this op points out, at pick 55 or lower, there&rsquo;s something like a 90%+ chance that you&rsquo;re never going to play significant NBA minutes anyways, staying in college more years isn&rsquo;t gonna help that.</p>

      <label for="ldsjj7f" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think people actually understand what college basketball is and the pros and cons for a basketball player to go from college to pro development system.</p>

<p>NCAA is a mess. Coaching turnover + transfers +  conf realignment make it tough to be certain what your experience will really even be like year to year.</p>

<p>If you have the chance to have an NBA staff committed to your development that is the way to go. It&rsquo;s not an option for everyone, there are 90 two way spots plus maybe another 50ish? roster spots teams will commit to development projects, but there is zero reason it would be better for Bronny to stay at the college level unless he just liked playing in college and wanted to do it for fun.</p>

<p>NBA used to suck at development, and college was the only real option. That is not true anymore and it is an outdated way of thinking.</p>

      <label for="ldsngus" class="commentText"><p>I mean the Lakers are basically being forced to develop him though, when looking at being the 55th pick in the draft many players come back to school because getting into those first 40 picks is far more lucrative AND with a more lucrative deal comes slightly more stability in that the team that picks you now has real incentive to develop you. So yes if your father is forcing the team to draft you and not cut you then yes you will &ldquo;develop&rdquo; certain skills faster in the NBA and NBA Gleague faster and better than you would in college.</p>

<p>That said Bronny could&rsquo;ve (even at the power conference level in my opinion) gotten reps as a primary creator in college this year and potentially developed into a first round talent, instead he will be pigeon holed into an undersized 3 and D 2 guard because that&rsquo;s all he can offer at an NBA Gleague level at the moment. Sure, his shot, which has been putrid so far, will develop faster under and NBA staff, but he will get far fewer game reps as a primary creator than he could&rsquo;ve in college.</p>

<p>Bronny likely could’ve played well enough to end up looking like a real top 40 pick in the next year or two, but instead is being forced to be a 3 and D 2 guard that’s 6 inches too short because his dad is only playing another 2 seasons.</p>

      <label for="ldt21a4" class="commentText"><p>i find it odd when ppl look at a specific draft # when really the better view would be to look at anyone who was picked at 55 <em>OR</em> later.</p>

<p>the point is finding talent that late in the draft and someone picked at 60/undrafted was available with the 55th pick.</p>

<p>there are enough examples of finding serviceable players that late. here&rsquo;s just looking at the past 5 years. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m missing more examples within the 5 years, and I&rsquo;m sure there are players who will eventually become good enough.</p>

<ul>
<li>2023 - Trayce Jackson Davis (57th)</li>
<li>2021 - Aaron Wiggins (55th)</li>
<li>2021 - Austin Reaves (undrafted)</li>

      <label for="ldspe84" class="commentText"><p>I’d say 1 in every 10 players drafted in the late 2nd round (picks 51-60) have a chance at having a long term role in the nba.  Most of those players being bench players, outside of Ginobli and IT, there aren’t many starters drafted in the last 10.  It’s not out of this world to think that Bronny can develop a decent shot and become a Davion Mitchell type of player, giving him a shot at the nba</p>

<p>And for those mad about the contract, it’s pretty standard for 2nd rounders now.  At least for the raptors, Jonathan Mogbo and Jamal Shead each got 3 years 6.1 million, which is a higher AAV than Bronny’s deal</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In all reality if Lakers had 54,56,57,58 whatever it is, does it really matter that this specific pick was successful or not in past drafts? No.</p></li>

<li><p>Comparing him as a prospect to any 50s range pick, he may be the worst. Look at some of those guys, they all had some case to being drafted and were much better prospects. Isaiah Wong came off a final four run with really good stats, Kyle Guy was an elite shooter on a championship Virginia team, Marcus Paige and Nigel Williams Goss were the starting PGs on national championship losing teams</p></li>

There isn’t some magic forcing the 55th picks to have a certain career and without looking at the rest of that draft range, it could easily be an outlier, and you would need to look at early picks for a comparison. They were picked that late because they weren’t likely to succeed, but how less likely are they to than a lottery guy?</p>

      <label for="ldtp9ou" class="commentText"><p>This post was suppose to help justify the Bronny pick but actually makes the pick look even worse.</p>

<p>Wiggins was just a few years ago and it’s too early to write off Gui Santos and Isaiah Wong. Second rounders are also more valuable than they ever have been in NBA history</p>

      <label for="ldsnwub" class="commentText"><p>I disagree I think the second rounders are nba type talents but they dont stick in the nba for multitude of reasons. It could be that they have better opportunity overseas whether it be more money or more playing time or they get replaced by cheaper talent. Why would teams want to pay the next contract when they can just replace it with a rookie contract. Additionally there are so many &ldquo;nba level&rdquo; talents that do not play in the nba and its because they are unable to play a role. Think Jahlil Okafor who was an absolute bucket on for the sixers but he couldn&rsquo;t play any other way other than post up scoring. Shooting and defense were a huge issue as well but no one was stopping that guy from scoring the ball.</p>

<p>Melo during his down years after OKC was still an nba level talent and still a bucket getter(ball stopper) but he could never transition into a role player and that is why he could never transition successfully in the backend of his career.. He was a one trick pony as just a scorer and provided nothing else.</p>

<p>Another more recent example would be someone like Sharife Cooper he was a phenomenal lead ball handler guard but he was maybe the 50th-60th lead guard in the world and in the nba there are only 30 lead guards and everyone else has to play a role and as a backup teams would want a more versatile piece to complement there best player and he couldn&rsquo;t play defense or shoot the ball at a nba level. He is still a nba level talent just others are better at his job than he was.</p>

<p>Put it like this if you&rsquo;re the 30th best player PnR guard in the world then your team is probably not very good and they are more of a supporting piece or a role player or running the bench offense. Hell they might not even be in the league cause they can&rsquo;t play a role beside being a lead guard (play defense or shoot the ball at a high level, role player tings)</p>

<p>Additionally I say all this just to state that there are players overseas that are NBA level talents that just play overseas. Look at the Drew League where NBA players go they don&rsquo;t win every game and the players there are definitely able to keep up with them(no they are not better or even in the same conversation). But Frank Nitty outplayed Denzal Valentine who was an NBA player and one of the best college players in his time.</p>

<p>All this to say No Bronny is not an nba level talent, but he will get a lot more chances and opportunities than other player to develop into one. See Austin Rivers who was not a good player but was able to transition into a role player as his dad kept him in the NBA.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>you think this is absurd because you aren&rsquo;t paying attention. The new CBA created a contract for second round picks called the Second Round Exception. They can be either 3 or 4 years. By signing him to the second round exception it means his contract doesn&rsquo;t count against the cap and it gives the Lakers more flexibility in free agency.</p>

<p>Nearly every second round pick that has signed a contract so far this offseason has used the Second Round Exception and has a nearly identical contract to Bronny. Its beneficial to both teams and players, which is why so many teams are using it.</p>

<p>It was exactly the same last year, both the 57th and 58th pick got the <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>.6 contract (the value increases slightly every year)</p>

<p>But to my understanding the Rookie contracts start counting against the Cap by August 1st.</p>

<p>If that is correct the Lakers will be over the second apron.</p>

<p>The new CBA is a bit complicated so I might be wrong&hellip;</p>

      <label for="ldsj4l3" class="commentText"><p>This is why second picks are going to be a lot more valuable the longer this CBA is in effect. Teams that are hars strapped will eventually trade their bottom first round picks for second round picks. If your picking 28 and the cap is looming you could benefit by trading back to a high second pick 1 for 1, then throw in some more 2nd round picks that are protected to make it look nice which would never convey or be so far back in the second round that it doesnt matter.</p>

      <label for="ldsq4ev" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a 55th pick.  This 55th pick sold 50 million dollars worth of jerseys for the league in his first year and I have a feeling will sell tickets for the G league when he&rsquo;s there too.</p>

<p>Teams will use a late 2nd on a guy from Europe who has no intention of the NBA not just in the hope for a 1 in a million shot he does decide to come over for less, but also knowing he likely will remain in Europe and the team won&rsquo;t need to pay him a salary on that pick.</p>
