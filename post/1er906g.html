<p>The idea is that CP3 has churned out 5ish MVP seasons and 15+ All-Star seasons. So even with Jokic churning out 4 All-Time seasons, it will still take time to catch up to guys who have 18+ years under their belts</p>

<p>in 2022, it was Giannis and Steph</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s quite as clear-cut.</p>

<ul>
<li>Jokic was the overwhelming MVP in 2020-2021 (91 first-place votes; Steph was second with <em>five</em>, Giannis had one)</li>
<li>In 2021-2022, Jokic was MVP (Giannis had nine, Steph had one)</li>
<li>In 2022-2023, Embiid was the controversial MVP choice - a choice a Bible&rsquo;s worth of text was written about what a mistake that was come playoff time because people were tired of Jokic.</li>
<li>2023-2024, Jokic back on top</li>
</ul>

<p>Jokic struggled with national narratives for a long time because Denver games weren&rsquo;t often nationally broadcast, and most Denver fans couldn&rsquo;t even watch local games due to broadcasting rights issues. There were First Take / Reddit narratives around his conditioning, but beyond people waiting for Giannis to come back in form (still waiting) Jokic has been the league&rsquo;s top dog since 2020.</p>

<p>Edit: since the 2020-21 season began, Giannis has gotten 23 total first place MVP votes, Steph got 5 (all in 2020), Embiid 100, and Jokic 250. <strong>In conclusion, since 2020, I don&rsquo;t see how anyone can argue that Jokic has been anything but a consensus #1 player across that four-year timespan</strong> (not necessarily in a given year).</p>

      <label for="lhy94h3" class="commentText"><p>Playoffs matter a lot in most people’s eyes. No one was saying Jokic was the best player in the world in 2021, especially not after Giannis averaged 35 ppg in the finals and dropped a 50-piece in game 6, and KD had his insane Bucks series where he dropped 49/17/10 in game 5 and 48 in game 7 to almost single-handedly steal that series. Jokic was at best third, arguably lower considering Steph was also on a tear.</p>

<p>2022 it was pretty clearly Steph after leading his team to a chip and having a great finals series including that clutch game 4. Keep in mind his supporting cast wasn’t even good. That championship just keeps aging better imo.</p>

<p>2023 was clearly Jokic despite Embiid winning MVP because playoffs matter, this year it’s still Jokic although Luka made a decent push in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Unless the &ldquo;something&rdquo; is some big scandal that invalidates many of his accomplishments to date, he has no business being this low. If he quits the NBA tomorrow, 29 would be a joke.</p>

<p>The idea that we need to see Jokic hang around and be less good for another decade before we can put him ahead of guys who were clearly worse at basketball is stupid.</p>

<p>This is a pretty bad take IMO.</p>

<p>Jokic will almost certainly be there one day but Chris Paul, KG, and Barkley all have nearly twice as many games played as him.  There&rsquo;s value in longevity, especially at such an elite level of play.  In all likelihood Jokic will leapfrog those guys as time goes on and he plays in more and more games but right now if I could take Charles Barkley&rsquo;s entire career over Jokic&rsquo;s entire career up until this point then it&rsquo;s easily Barkley.  22 seasons of KG is worth more than 9 seasons of Jokic and it&rsquo;s not close.</p>

      <label for="lhxsg5s" class="commentText"><p>I mean I think that isn’t super bad. Cp3 is an outlier in his numbers where his impact is enormous yet he has no MVPs n no rings - he should probably have some . He’s also had an immensely long career. If you value careers as how much you helped your team over the course of a career then I think it’s not awful cp3 is ranked much higher by people interested in data analysis then casuals think.</p>

<p>Jokic will overtake him but as for now I imagine it’s a current list and not a list factoring in projections</p>

<p>I would put cp3 as a top 20 ever guy n I’d put jokic there too. And part of why I put jokic there is assuming he’ll keep producing</p>

<p>he’s not dominant enough</p>

<p>Jordan has 31. he has multiple playoff games with 50</p>

<p>Durant is like George Gervin. fantastic scorer, but he’s not Michael fucking Jordan</p>

<p>you don’t get credit for having the ability to be the best, you get credit for actually doing it</p>

<p>i’d argue that LeBron’s playoff scoring is better than Durant. it’s nice always being able to get a midrange jumper. it’s even nicer to be able to get to the rim at will and then finish there at an all-time rate</p>

      <label for="lhy7bv7" class="commentText"><p>To add to this Lebron volume n efficiency vs -2( good) or -4 or better ( great) defence is amazing . He doesn’t lose volume n actually I think improves on efficiency relative to defence.</p>

<p>Kd meanwhile in the playoffs has statiscally dropped efficiency by one of the biggest drops ( admittedly kd has also some of the best regular season efficiency ever)  cs good or great defences n significant increase in turnovers too.</p>

<p>Low-key the combo of rim pressure n elite playmaking is harder to stop for elite defences then kd iso scoring . Look at Jokic( or even Luka )now , especially jokic. Jokic kinda has his own version of the rim pressure plus playmaking that’s incredibly difficult to stop  by good or great defences. I think as people understand basketball more we’ll appreciate Lebron scoring tools more as generally high lvl playmaking unlocks scoring more then just a great iso scorer vs good or great playoff defences. Lebron has a history of carving up great defences.</p>

      <label for="lhxb5tq" class="commentText"><p>i wouldn’t even say it’s mamba mentality that keeps him from averaging more - it’s his addiction to efficiency. he’s actually a very selfless player and rarely demands a lot of touches to get his numbers.</p>

<p>i remember last year when book and brad were kinda struggling at the beginning of the year adjusting to their new roles, KD basically told them to not worry about him and get their rhythm and find their shot early in the game because he knew he would get his eventually.</p>

      <label for="lhyxmtf" class="commentText"><p>I mean what you’re describing is pretty much my definition of a lack of mamba mentality, but I fully admit I’m a professional Kobe hater. Kobe was willing to take sub-optimal shots because he fully believed it was more effective for him to take bad shots than for his teammates to take good shots (and frankly, he was often right about that). Or perhaps more accurately, Kobe had a willingness to attack defenses with the knowledge that if it ended up in a tough look, he’d still have a decent chance to make it. KD didn’t really show that mentality until he was in Brooklyn and Kyrie and Harden got injured. At that point, KD didn’t have nearly the athleticism that he once had, but the Bucks, who were the best defensive team in the league, were powerless to stop him. If KD had played that way  his whole career, he might have had a shot at passing Lebron’s scoring record</p>

It&rsquo;s funny how year by year, KD has been the better player by consensus in the majority of seasons, yet people still think curry is way ahead. No shade on curry, but Durant was generally considered better in the early years, when both were on GS and in these past few seasons.

      <label for="lhxdla6" class="commentText"><p>KD being better than Steph from 2016-2019 isn’t consensus (and certainly not among Warriors fans who watched them the most)</p>

<p>The Warriors generally had better stats with Steph and no KD than the other way around and part of the reason for KD winning both FMVPs is that the Cavs chose to focus on Steph as the #1 option</p>

<p>Steph and KD were always 1A and 1B those years (and you can argue who was A and who was B) but neither was clearly better</p>

<p>The 2022 ring especially but also the 2015 ring and the 2016 unanimous MVP make it hard to argue KD over Steph overall though</p>

<p>It’s more nuanced then, “Cavs didn’t guard kd as much as Steph”</p>

      <label for="lhx13c9" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s very close imo. Higher floor, lower ceiling than Curry. Far more impactful on defense, while competing with Steph&rsquo;s nuclear offensive impact by &ldquo;only&rdquo; being arguably the best pure scorer ever. Definite 1a on a championship team caliber talent. All the needed accolades.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s career narrative more than anything that lowers him in the people&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>EDIT: Someone brought up the term pure scorer and made a claim for MJ (then deleted their comment).</p>

<p>To me a pure scorer means scoring from every spot of the floor and being able to do it with the ball in your hands, regardless of the defense, regardless of era. On those terms, he&rsquo;s better than MJ because of his range.</p>

<p>Based strictly off performance with no context, MJ is a superior scorer. But when I think about this, I&rsquo;m forced to think about who MJ was guarded by compared to Durant, and the lack of zone defense in his era.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s credible to me that all things being the same, KD is a better scorer of the basketball at his peak.</p>

      <label for="lhx6lqq" class="commentText"><p>If it’s a 1v1 or anything where pure individual basketball ability shines through, I think KD is the obvious choice because of his height and defense. If it’s a team game and I get one to start a team with, I’m going with curry, although it’s definitely close. They’re in the same top 20, arguably top 10 tier all time</p>

<p>Do you mean ever, or just between him and KD? Because off the top of my head, Hakeem and Isiah Thomas have both done that</p>

      <label for="lhxi7gr" class="commentText"><p>Durant has a 5-year stretch of 4 top-2 MVP finishes (1 MVP), another top-5, and 5 All-NBA 1st selections. Curry has 2 top-2 MVP finishes total, (both MVPs) and then 2 more top-5, with 4 total All-NBA 1st.</p>

<p>Giving the edge to Curry on the premise that the gap in team success overcomes the gap in individual accomplishments is fair. But this is a comparison of individuals, so foregoing that entirely and acting like Durant has no case? That’s unreasonable.</p>

Lebron has one shit stain playoff series 2011, Kobe has 2 04 Pistons 06 suns.
Kobe is the most glazed over marketed star of all time. At least with Jordan the talent backed up the marketing.</p>

<p>Side A is adamant that he’s not top 10, oftentimes using his peer Tim Duncan as a reference point</p>

<p>Side B is adamant that he’s somewhere between top 5 and the GOAT</p>

<p>But I do agree that he shouldn’t be 7 spots behind.</p>

<p>I personally have them right next to each other.</p>

<p>I swear it’s only this sub that thinks it’s crazy Giannis is above Jokic in all time rankings lol everywhere else you look, Giannis is usually ahead</p>

      <label for="lhxu68x" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a very different situation though.  First and foremost, sports science and nutrition in general is worlds ahead of where it was 25 years ago.  I promise you that if Lebron was playing at the time time as Jordan, he would not be playing at 39 years old.  He deserves a ton of credit for working his ass off and putting a ton of effort into his body to be where he&rsquo;s at today, but without advancements in sports science, it wouldn&rsquo;t even be an option.</p>

<p>Jordan was also fully retired for the second time and was never planning on coming back long term.  There was no chance that Wizards team was going to compete and he was basically there to sell tickets and boost the team for a couple of years.</p>

<p>a redditor can literally make a post in new, titled &ldquo;this is my top 10 goats&rdquo; and there would be a comment pretty much saying &ldquo;no. this is wrong. your top 10 should be the same as my top 10. nothing else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>it is as dumb as comparing two superheroes from completely two different franchises, who have never faced before and have no side characters to based on&hellip;. and when someone legit quantify it with records and metrics, you&rsquo;d dismiss it anyways.</p>

<p>so nothing really matters. other than the Curry is top 10 and lbj is and will always be top 2 in GOATs.</p>

<p>An elite season at 39 where he became the all time leading scorer and won mvp of the Olympics is not nothing lol. You don’t have to agree, but that’s completely fair.</p>
