</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>In the lowest scoring era in NBA history since the shot clock, he averaged 24.2-8.9-6.5, all while earning an all-defensive first team nomination as the consensus best defensive PG.</p>

<p>This was in the same era that Jason Kidd (02) and Steve Nash (05) finished second and first in MVP voting averaging 14-10 and 15-11 respectively. Payton averaged fewer turnovers than both.</p>

<p>Kidd was less efficient and also an elite defender, while Nash was more efficient but a defensive liability. Payton didn’t have the narrative on his side; due to Kemp’s exit a few years earlier and Vin Baker dealing with alcoholism, he carried an aging Sonics team to 45 wins.</p>

<p>Still, while Payton is probably best known for his DPOY season on the great 1996 Sonics, it would seem like his 2000 year would compare extremely favorably with the best PG seasons of that era</p>

<p>Why do you think there is pretty limited talk about a prime Gary Payton compared to some of the other top PGs of that era? For those who watched basketball in the late 90s and early 2000s, is that season underrated, and has Payton become underrated with time?</p>

Got to a point where you couldn’t convince him that if McIlvaine got that much then surely Kemp would get so much more for the next one. Love Gary, all time Sonic but the man could not stop talking trash, even when it was friendly fire lol.</p>

Dejounte Murray averaged 9 assists in SA but he is not a great passer and a very mid playmaker. Assits don&rsquo;t tell the whole story.

      <label for="lih68q5" class="commentText"><p>Gary Payton absolutely was called one of the best PGs of his era for a decade, and he didn&rsquo;t play when Nash played for the Suns and really blew up.</p>

<p>He wasn&rsquo;t underrated. He was known. Sonics-Bulls Finals was all about Payton. He was pretty much comparable to Chris Paul in his prime as far as how people viewed him overall.</p>

<p>If you asked people who was better Kidd or Payton I think it&rsquo;d be about 50-50.</p>

      <label for="lihtuk0" class="commentText"><p>As someone who lived through that era, I&rsquo;d agree that it&rsquo;s quite split.</p>

<p>GP&rsquo;s older and his prime was a bit earlier whereas Kidd&rsquo;s is split between his PHX and NJN days.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to pick between the 2 because they were such fantastic all around players, both huge physical guards who could board and defend and playmake and score. Neither were good outside shooters but the era didn&rsquo;t require that of them. I&rsquo;d give GP the edge on D and as a slasher/scorer. But Kidd&rsquo;s burlier, the more talented natural playmaker and the much better rebounder. I am still haunted by prime Kidd&rsquo;s minimalist triple doubles doing in my early aughts Raptor squads every time they met. </p>

<p>Both won a ring in the twilight of their careers as the old steady hand on a mercenary-laden Expendables type of team. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;d give the edge personally to Kidd, just barely. GP worked his butt off and maximized his talents, but Kidd to me is the more talented player from the get-go, and improved as a shooter drastically over his career.</p>

<p>Honestly, being a big fan of both of them spoiled my expectations of this more recent era&rsquo;s big guards. I keep waiting for Westbrook&rsquo;s BBIQ to mature into GP/Kidd&rsquo;s as he grows older and slows down, but it never did (on the other hand he remains a physical freak at his age).</p>

<p>Which is my point, stop validating players over shit that doesn’t matter. Brady is ONE of the goats, but not mine, opinion based obviously. But to even say Brady is better than Mahomes is just blasphemy imo.</p>

<p>Brady had the better team on the Bucs, so he won. Giants did not have the better team (by far) and he still could not put up 17 points on an inferior defence. Does that not deserve a knock?</p>

<p>The eye test</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Didn’t know that you got extra points for 10 yard completions if they look better.  I’m sure peyton manning hangs “throws a prettier ball” next to his 5 less super bowls.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Peyton Manning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn’t even worth arguing.  The only edge peyton has over Brady is Regular season MVPs, and that’s like arguing Embiid is better than Kawahi.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Joe Montana</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You aren’t old enough to have watched Joe, and if you were you would know that Joe played in the non salary cap era with the, at the time, greatest offensive mind in the history of the sport with the greatest skill position player ever.  Joe himself has also said Brady is better.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Patrick Mahomes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mahomes has a shot and is more physically gifted, but plays with aruguably the GOAT TE, and the greatest offensive mind in the history of the league in Andy Reid.  Andy has won 10+ games with Mcnabb, Vick/Kolb, Mcnabb/Detmer, Mcnabb/Garcia, Alex smith, and Mahomes.  Andy reid’s teams have a floor of 9 wins and he was inarguably one of the 2 best coaches in the NFL without mahomes.  Belichick has a below .500 winning percentage without Brady.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The giants in 2011 and 2007</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aren’t you in a basketball sub?  How many lower seeded teams lose playoff games in a series?  Sweeps are heavily uncommon and it’s wildly known any team can win one game.  Come on nephew you gotta do better than that.  The 01 lakers lost game 1 to the Sixers who had Iverson, eric snow and the corpse of mutumbo</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does that deserve a knock?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If he didn’t win another chip then sure.  But after that he completed the greatest comeback in SB history against the same defense that blew out peyton manning the year before for his forth chip.  Then for his 5th chip he completed 28-3.  Then the next year he lost, but set Nfl records for most yards in post season history.  Then after that he wins an ugly 6th, and then for his 7th beats his 3rd major contempary for an unheralded 7th.</p>

      <label for="lihkz8l" class="commentText"><p>Agreed that GP is underrated but boiling Nash down to his raw box score stats hugely undersells his impact IMO, he was a GOAT-tier passer/playmaker and shooter on all 3 levels plus an elite ballhandler. Much like Steph with the Warriors a decade later, Nash was the engine of everything those Suns did. He was <a href="https://thinkingbasketball.net/2018/02/22/backpicks-goat-19-steve-nash/" target="_blank">consistently delivering some of the highest-quality passes ever</a>,  spawning layups out of thin air like it was nothing. His teams were consistently some of the best regular-season AND playoff offenses ever:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>His decade of offensive wizardry on two offense-first teams meant he played on the best offenses in NBA history through his career and a mind-boggling six of the 15 best “healthy” offenses ever.</p>

<p>The best four-year stretch for a playoff offense is held by Nash’s Suns, who were +10.7 in 51 playoff games between 2005 and 2008.</p>

<p>His presence in the lineup correlated heavily with his team’s success, ranking in the top-10 in both WOWY and regressed game-level data. At the lineup level, he’s second in the Databall era in scaled offensive adjusted plus-minus (APM), behind only LeBron James. And his best scaled (overall) APM seasons are in the 99th percentile historically.</p>

      <label for="lihcg9p" class="commentText"><p>GP was seen as a foe of Jordan from their finals match up. Anyone who made Jordan not look good was blacklisted by David Stern and his NBA/NBC/Nike corporate cabal. Jordan hated that Gary was better than him on defense. That was the main reason. Another was Gary&rsquo;s trash-talking and street image; they didn&rsquo;t think he was a great role model for the league.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Sonics were a disappointing franchise in the late &lsquo;90&rsquo;s. They were hyped up big when they made the finals, then they let go of Kemp, and their teams became very average and boring.</p>

      </div>
      <label for="lihta6y" class="commentText"><p>I feel like Gary Payton is a very underrated player in general just because he was a top-level 2-way player for like a decade straight. He got votes in just about every award from his prime (25-26) until he was 34.</p>

<p>He got MVP and DPOY votes for 6 or 7 straight seasons in the 90s and was All-Defense 1st team for almost a decade straight.</p>

<p>From his age 25 to age 34 seasons (the 93-94 through 02-03 seasons) he averaged:</p>

<p>20.8 Pts
7.9 Ast
4.5 Reb
2.1 Stl</p>

<p>And in the playoffs he nearly averaged the same thing on similar shooting efficiency, while going from 39 minutes a game to 42 from the regular season into the playoffs.</p>

<p>His scoring and rebounding increases by like half a point and his assists and steals drop off by about half a point. But, otherwise that, he didn&rsquo;t have that massive drop-off that a lot of players tend to experience in the post-season.</p>

<p>One thing that might&rsquo;ve held him back just a bit was that he was kind of an inconsistent shooter for a guard, and for a long time, even from the FT line.</p>

<p>Had he just been a little bit better, I feel like he and the Sonics could have snuck away with a championship over the Bulls in 96 or he, at least, could&rsquo;ve put up slightly more ridiculous scoring numbers on better efficiency for that time. He could hit 12-15 footers over smaller guards or off the dribble if he got hot. But it never really got to the point where he was at all-time shooter levels for long stretches.</p>

<p>He was ridiculously good at just about everything else, however. He was great at putting pressure on the rim and in the post because he was big enough and fast enough to create mismatches against all sorts of guards and bigs. And he was able to switch onto bigger players at times which meant teams couldn&rsquo;t always mismatch hunt him in the post.</p>

<p>His 99-00 and 00-01 seasons were the best he ever shot from deep. He averaged 34% and then 37% in those two seasons. And they were among his best from the FT line. So, it&rsquo;s no wonder they were also his highest scoring seasons. Both of those things probably have him more of a dynamic way to put up better scoring numbers. Kemp was also gone so that could&rsquo;ve contributed, too.</p>

<p>One of my favorite &ldquo;Peak Gary Payton&rdquo; games from those years is <a href="https://youtu.be/xqZEBtIlQRY?si=x65pPsbjQNwAM7XE" target="_blank">this</a> one against the Jazz in the 2000 playoffs. You can see how his defense and pace in transition were just relentless. Pair that with a game where he starts hitting jumpers at a reasonable clip for that time and he was a problem.</p>

      <label for="lih4a2j" class="commentText"><p>Great season, great player, but I think his legacy is hurt by the end of career ring chasing. Maybe not fair, but going to the Lakers with Malone, and then getting bested by the Pistons didn’t help his reputation. He was a prickly guy, too.</p>
