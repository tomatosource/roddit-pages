Jokic tries a low post shot, but it misses. He also gets his own rebound, and makes the layup. 6-3 Jokic lead. Luka answers right back with the slam, and the foul! He misses the free throw though, so it&rsquo;s still a Jokic lead, 6-5. Jokic grinds his way to the basket, and makes a layup, and gets the foul call. He makes the free throw as well, to go to the brink of the championship, 9-5. Doncic, in a do or die situation, drives and makes a layup and draws yet another foul! He makes the free throw. 9-8 Jokic lead with Jokic ball. Can he win it here? Jokic, anticlimactically turns the ball over out of bounds. Doncic goes for the 3&hellip; Bang! Luka Doncic from 3! Luka wins the championship! What a way to win it for Luka Doncic!</p>

<p>1 v 1 Championship final result: 11-9 Luka win, in a stunning comeback.</p>

<p>I thought this was hilarious, but it was even funnier when I realized none of the other players committed a turnover on out-of-bounds plays which is incredible in a 1-v-1 game.</p>

<p>How is no one else stealing inbounds passes???</p>

<p>Giannis is a great, great basketball player but I think he&rsquo;s at a severe disadvantage 1 on 1 against any other big. I can&rsquo;t imagine that Embiid matchup playing out at all like that</p>

<p>But Giannis playing a game to 11 and only having to worry about 1 guy and using all his energy to stop him, I could definitely see him making Embiid struggle. They guard each other pretty well when they do matchup.</p>

<p>But I’m not sure why you picked Giannis to be at a disadvantage against other bigs? If anything it’d be Jokic cause they’d cook him.</p>

      <label for="lmbb28p" class="commentText"><p>What are these bullshit matchups? For Curry to win, he literally should not miss a shot, as there&rsquo;s no way he&rsquo;s getting the rebound or stopping AD. It&rsquo;s the same with Embiid vs Brunson. If you want to do something like this, at least put some cap on the height limit, that&rsquo;ll be more unpredictable than what you&rsquo;ve put here.</p>
