The most popular jerseys were the basic, standard ones. The local native tribes fucking ate up the turquoise jersey, but that jersey was intended to honor them. Of course they&rsquo;d fucking rock it. But towards the end of my time there, I barely saw the gradient ones and those were VERY highly regarded.</p>

It was a fun idea the problem is that there&rsquo;s been like 3 iterations of city jerseys since then and they&rsquo;ve all been pretty forgettable. There&rsquo;s only so many good ideas to be had. Nike should have encouraged the creative jersey ideas, just without the hard rule of making a new jersey every year,</p>

      <label for="lohc7a2" class="commentText"><p>My issue is that they (Nike) along with every other major brand still using child labor to make cheaper and cheaper products.</p>

<p>Then claiming they can‚Äôt completely remove child labor from their supply line despite being what? A 10+ billion dollar a year company?</p>

<p>They push out cheaply made uniforms EVEN for the athletes and then charge a premium to the customers.(See tiny lettering for names on baseball jerseys, little to no detail on football uniforms I.E. Atlanta falcons, Az Cards..</p>

<p>And yeah their design department since about 2010 has been abysmal and uninspired as well.</p>

<p>Nike DOESNT deserve the market share it has and they should ABSOLUTELY be held responsible for the sweatshops they have in China.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre making a cheap product then selling it for cheap..</p>

<p>I‚Äôm honestly surprised they haven‚Äôt started selling pairs of shoes individually where you have to buy both the left and right‚Ä¶ They get away with literally every other form of gauging, why not that? Might as well no real power will hold them accountable for their anti consumer practices.</p>

<p>Nike isn‚Äôt alone here, Fanatics has a major hand in the cheapness..Along with basically every other company in most other industries..</p>

<p>Apologies for ranting.</p>

<p>And I know I‚Äôm gonna get downvoted, I just don‚Äôt care.. It needs to be said ALL THE TIME.</p>

<p>And I know you‚Äôre talking  tongue in cheek.. But the notion that if we removed the cheapest labor that the product will skyrocket is patently false just in case anyone takes your comment at face value. I get you‚Äôre kidding..</p>

<p>But that‚Äôs been soundly debunked. See the Nordic countries with the price of McDonald‚Äôs and what they pay their employees. Both a living wage and affordable food products. It can be done and yeah maybe the shareholders wouldn‚Äôt be making record profits every year and the companies take those record profits and buy billions in stock buy backs (Apple).</p>

<p>It‚Äôs just we‚Äôve allowed corporations to have WAYYYY too much political power and control our govt either through legislation with lobbyist literally writing it down to the period or lobbing congress to do absolutely no form of governing which benefits them about as much..</p>

<p>I haven‚Äôt even gotten into how corporations use the govt as a nanny state with tax breaks and deductibles.. Prime example of that would be GE.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs just we live in a capitalist hellscape. We need to model our govt after the Nordic countries with regulated capitalism and a true form of social democracy.</p>

<p>Again apologies for the rant it‚Äôs just a crazy complex issue that probably won‚Äôt ever been addressed or resolved here in our country..</p>

<p>So yeah Nike(along with most industries) will continue to take shortcuts and pass those costs along to everyone else while making a cheaper and cheaper product.</p>

      <label for="loh4czv" class="commentText"><p>I‚Äôll keep saying this to those who don‚Äôt work in the industry until everyone starts to understand‚ÄîNike is no longer a destination for top designers. They‚Äôve been hemorrhaging good designers for the last 6 years. Apparel designers, shoe designers, uniform designers, etc. They‚Äôre a revolving door of young, aloof designers led by an old guard too entrenched to hand over the reigns (sound familiar to other industries today?). They‚Äôre not going to recapture lightning in a bottle by pulling a member of the old guard from retirement. Their opportunity to right the ship was last decade, they failed, they have been uninterested in innovation, their once-innovated business model and motto of telling the <em>Nike story</em> relied on really great designers making really cool stuff <em>for years</em>. They don‚Äôt have that anymore. It‚Äôs not the Nike of yesteryear. You wonder why the City Edition uniforms suck every year? Because they‚Äôve stretched dwindling talent thinner every year. The City Edition, City Connect, and NFL uniform models are solely made to sell more merch every year. Despite their size, they have limited numbers of designers to create new uniforms for 3 leagues every season or two‚Äîthe process is time consuming. They do not care about what fans want, they‚Äôre not innovative enough to live on hype, and they don‚Äôt even make the best quality of stuff anymore.</p>

<p>People need to just sit back and watch a company consume itself because it became complacent and concerned with selling in an unsustainable model.</p>

<p>Nike is no longer a destination for top designers</p>

<p>and there isnt a single department where this is more evident than in the basketball shoes. Aside from very few exceptions, EVERYTHING they sell nowadays is a Kobe derivative, with some even going as far as having the same panel placement as old Kobes</p>

<p>And this also extends to Jordan brand since a lot of their recent models and almost all their current signature shoes have a fundamental flaw that is a deal breaker to many</p>

<p>If its just some nike flunky doing it then that changes how I view them.  I havent really liked most of them but my thought was that it was a local artist/designer making them and deserved some dignity.</p>

      <label for="loh7pwo" class="commentText"><p>Most CEs are designed by Nike. Teams are allowed to use an outside agency or artist, most do not because they don&rsquo;t want to pay for that process when Nike will do it as a service. There are other reasons why teams refrain from hiring third parties, but there&rsquo;s not a whole lot of incentive for teams to go and hire designers or groups because there&rsquo;s not much ROI in it for them. If they hire a third party, they pay out of their own pocket, and if that jersey sells incredibly well nearly all of that money is going into the pockets of Nike/Fanatics. So why bother? But you&rsquo;re not wrong, some teams have hired outside groups over the years, just not very many.</p>

Adidas and UnderArmour are in a similar situation as Nike, with UA in a much worse place. I have not heard of anyone looking at taking their design talent to China.</p>

My favorite looking shoe in the past few years is the son of flash: <a href="https://www.wayofwade.com/collections/wade-son-of-flash" target="_blank">https://www.wayofwade.com/collections/wade-son-of-flash</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also crazy high performance.</p>

<p>China has been making all of the apparel for the past few decades anyway, they already built the best stuff, they&rsquo;re using all of the same tech and materials in their stuff and it looks way cooler.</p>

      <label for="lohjz0b" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s genuinely shocking at just how uncomfortable Nike&rsquo;s are compared to their competition. Last year, I bought a pair of Jordan 2&rsquo;s and a pair of New Balance 550&rsquo;s. I adore wearing the 550&rsquo;s and I love wearing these out. The Jordan 2&rsquo;s are special occasion shoes because those things are extremely uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Like, I get that the Jordan 2&rsquo;s are 80s sneakers, but they feel exactly like a pair of shoes that have never been improved for forty years. Furthermore, I refuse to believe that Nike can&rsquo;t do anything, because they made Chuck Taylor&rsquo;s that are more comfortable and look like Chuck Taylor&rsquo;s.</p>

Not because of Rolex but because of Authorized Dealers do really dumb shit like make you buy 3 watches before you can get on a list for a Rolex. I think they have definitely lost their luster and prestige compared to 10-15 years ago. Grand Seiko is really doing cool things, same with Omega, Patek, and AP. A lot of other luxury brands and boutique makers have started to really shine, eating into Rolex‚Äôs market and making cooler shit.</p>

Maybe. Maybe not. When a normal person thinks of a luxury watch, they still think of Rolex first. It&rsquo;s just different when they try to buy a pair of shoes they want for $250 and get told they&rsquo;re out of stock and never coming back. Someone going to an authorized dealer and getting told there&rsquo;s a 3 month wait for the Rolex they want, doesn&rsquo;t mind as much.</p>

<p>Porsche is also the wrong comparison. Ferrari is way more restrictive on who can buy their cars and what they can do with them.</p>

      <label for="loh7c5h" class="commentText"><p>A lot of people speculating nonsense.</p>

<p>Rolex saw the market speeding up intake and began to increase production. However, the demand was a temporary spike in 2020 before a recession where demand dwindled. So they increased supply by hiring more watchmakers and making more factories which will be done by 2030.</p>

<p>Rich people love being unique‚Äîthey don‚Äôt want to be associated with poor people. Only 1% of US households earn <span class="math inline">\(800k/year. About 5% of households earn \)</span>400k/year and 80% of households earn under $100k/year. That 1% wants nothing to do with anyone underneath them, and when the others can afford the things that were exclusive to just them, they move on. Now they‚Äôre shifting more to higher priced brands like AP, PP, Chopard, Czapec, and such.</p>

<p>There will come a point when Rolex supply will far exceed demand‚Äîand you will see the brand‚Äôs value drop to Omega levels really quickly.</p>

Its a similar model to Ferrari, you have to be a loyal Ferrari customer of their commoner-tier stuff before they open the doors to more collector level cars. Rolex and Ferrari will say its a strategy to protect against brand dilution, but really it&rsquo;s just a way to ensure they have steady sales of their higher margin products.</p>

      <label for="lohjc3i" class="commentText"><p>My two cents on brand ‚Äî Nike has a rich history that it successfully mined for the past ~20 years. However, we‚Äôre entering a new cycle where people in their 20s don‚Äôt have the same nostalgic impressions of Nike.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a period around 2017 post-flyknit racers, where Nike stopped bringing new things to the table, and GR releases didn‚Äôt make a lasting impression. IMO credibility in athletic footwear laid the foundation for lifestyle, not the other way around.</p>

<p>Sneakerheads are in their 40s and 50s now. I think Nike‚Äôs time as industry tastemaker/agenda-setter already ended, but it‚Äôs not completely felt yet because the brand has decades of inertia behind it.</p>

<p>Its one of the things that make the NFL so much more successful than any other sports league in the world, they know not to diminish the important parts of there brand. Which is players on field when they are playing football. They are fine with all the extra stuff having branding on it, like awards and half time names and stuff, but not on the field in the audiences face when the entertaining part is in progress</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of how many <em>low</em> quality jerseys Nike has been producing, but this reads like a copy and paste from someone who just sees shit on Reddit that sounds smart. Nike is a <strong>publicly traded company</strong>. There is no private equity involvement here, but simply shareholders.</p>

<p>Nike&rsquo;s stock is down 20% YTD, so this move isn&rsquo;t because the brand is &ldquo;uncool&rdquo; necessarily but that they are less profitable due to mostly poor business decisions since ~2020</p>

      <label for="loh9tl7" class="commentText"><p>Jordans and the like are a small part of Nike‚Äôs sales. It‚Äôs not the artificial scarcity that‚Äôs killing them but rather that they are losing to innovative companies like Hoka, On, and the like in categories they previously dominated. There a lot more small competitors these days  instead of the Adidas vs. Nike era.</p>

<p>Also, too much focus on online sales along with killing a lot of their retail/brick and mortar business meant that they lost a lof their loyal customer base. The ousted CEO was a techie, ‚Äúdata-driven‚Äù guy who was not in touch with the realities of Nike‚Äôs market.</p>

      <label for="lohptah" class="commentText"><p>I bought a couple pairs of Nike shorts and the fucking pockets won&rsquo;t keep my wallet and phone in the pocket.</p>

<p>Like how stupid can you get at Nike? Everybody carries a wallet and phone. You think we want our shit on the ground or the floor of our car?</p>

<p>I stopped wearing them completely.</p>

<p>Like Jesus Christ. How enept can they be getting at Nike to be allowing shit like this?</p>

      <label for="lohnzna" class="commentText"><p>These big brands are kind of fucked in a bunch of very weird ways. For one their clothes has never been less original. Nike sells like New Balance and Croc looking products now, the stuff that was literally being made fun of when I was 13 when I walked into the lunch room. It&rsquo;s also all bland as fuck, and Nike looks the same as Adidas clothes, just like how McDonald&rsquo;s and Burger King and any other fast food joint now basically look identical. There&rsquo;s this very odd uniformity going on with big brands at the moment.</p>

<p>They just make the actual jersey. Teams do the rest.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why during Adidas we had sleeved jerseys that looked awesome and others that looked like pyjamas.</p>
