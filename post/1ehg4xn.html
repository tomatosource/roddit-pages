      <p>Ant has a good reg season. And even a better playoff last season. Some people even forget he is only 22 yrs old.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s use Luka, SGA, Tatum as barometers here.</p>

<p>Do you think Ant can be as good as current Luka when the former is in his 26-27 yrs old of age?</p>

<p>If not, can he settle for SGA or Tatum level instead?</p>

<p>Or he will not reach the level of any of these 3?</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>hes still a mediocre passer but his passing reads are improving</p>

<p>great on ball but mediocre off ball defense which can easily improve</p>

<p>that combined with more consistency and he can easily reach sga and tatum levels. i think he could peak at like a dwade level as an alltime shooting guard but time will tell</p>

      <label for="lfzbjuz" class="commentText"><p>I think he could reach him regardless. He has the tools to (at least) and both his age and determination is something that would allow it to happen. No one is saying he&rsquo;s there or he&rsquo;ll 100% going to reach it. But most of Ant&rsquo;s flaws are fixable, his mentality is great to build on, he&rsquo;s proven himself as a leader, scorer, and defender.</p>

<p>I think he definitely has the package to potentially reach that level. And I know how insane Wade was in his prime.</p>

      <label for="lfz7ndt" class="commentText"><p>Based on what? Wade is obviously better all time, and way more fun to watch, but hardens impact on the game at his peak was even higher than wades at his. Numbers back it up, and he has an MVP to show for it (probably should have won 2015 too but we didn&rsquo;t know warriors were going to turn into a dynasty) hardens offensive peak was (amazingly) even higher than kobes, but Kobe actually has the defensive accolades to justify keeping him over harden. Wades best season he finished 3rd in MVP voting and 3rd in dpoy, which is crazy for sure, but you might just need to look at hardens bb reference again</p>

I’m so tired of listening to this shit lol. We could talk hypotheticals all day, but all we have is what actually happened. Wade had a better peak and he was way more fun to watch.</p>

I&rsquo;m saying statistically, talent-wise, and their coaching ability was much better than many championship winning teams. I would take them over some of the winners we&rsquo;ve already had in the 2020&rsquo;s as well.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t give a shit over who was more fun to watch, I don&rsquo;t even like Harden, ya&rsquo;ll are just too big of haters to appreciate the insane level of ball he played. I don&rsquo;t even know if I&rsquo;d take him over Wade, it&rsquo;s just anoyying to watch people act like he never played championship ball level. Those rockets teams were elite. I&rsquo;d probably take them over the 06 Heat.</p>

      <label for="lfznfy2" class="commentText"><p>the only thing you’re right about is that comparing Tatum to Ant is laughable at this point</p>

<p>since Tatum has been drafted by the Celtics no team has won more total games, no team has posted a better net rating, they’ve won 50+ games 5 times and secured a top 4 seed six times, they had one of the greatest seasons of all time, they’ve won more series than any team while defeating 4 MVPs and six 50-win teams in the playoffs, they’ve been one of the last four teams standing 5 times in 7 years, and they have made 2 Finals and won a championship</p>

<p>in that timeframe Tatum is the leading scorer, rebounder and assister for the Celtics. he’s 4x All-NBA, 5x All-Star, has scored the 6th most points of any player in the league, has dropped 8 50-point games which is 6th most in the league (and he’s one of only four players with multiple 50s in the playoffs), led the league in plus-minus in 2022, led the league in total scoring in 2023, has scored more postseason points before the age of 27 than any player in NBA history, has grabbed more postseason rebounds before 27 than any player other than Bill Russell, become the only player other than LeBron to lead both teams in all five major stat categories for a full series, and become the 6th and youngest player to lead a championship team in playoff points, rebounds and assists.</p>

<p>btw, as much as y’all love talking about the teammates, there are two players that have played for the Celtics every season in this timeframe - Tatum and Brown. they’ve had 57 other teammates and three head coaches and they’ve won consistently through it all.</p>

<p>if you don’t think that’s a benchmark for attainment then I’m sorry but you’re just dumb, you say he hasn’t led them to shit but they are the most successful team in the NBA this decade. if Ant ends up with a resume that looks anything like this over the next 4-5 years that will be an absolutely resounding success.</p>

      <label for="lfzrb3t" class="commentText"><p>Celtics were also the #1 seed and made the ECF before ever drafting Tatum. Giving him all this credit for the teams success is being disingenuous. He&rsquo;s had a top 3 infrastructure around him since first stepping on an NBA court.</p>

<p>Great player yes. But he isn&rsquo;t the standard for what I&rsquo;d hold Ant to. And if Ant ends up having a worse individual career than Tatum it would be a disappointment.</p>

      <label for="lfzs7f0" class="commentText"><p>I won’t disagree he benefitted from going to a team that already had a good culture established but exactly 4 of the top 11 minute getters on the 2017 Celtics played for the 2018 Celtics so that’s just a disingenuous argument.</p>

<p>I would probably prepare myself to be disappointed if I were you then. Ant is basically exactly where Tatum was as a player at the same age - extremely talented scorer with a streaky jumpshot and tunnel vision. the difference is he’s more athletic but also five inches shorter.</p>

      <label for="lfzvfh2" class="commentText"><p>An infrastructure doesn&rsquo;t only include players, so sounds like you misunderstand the point. It includes management and coaching as well. Most teams aren&rsquo;t as lucky to go from Ainge to Brad Stevens who may be even better at team building.</p>

<p>And luckily it isn&rsquo;t just me. Essentially the whole NBA world holds Ant to a higher standards/expectations. If it doesn&rsquo;t happen, I guess everyone outside of Boston was wrong, and I don&rsquo;t see that being likely.</p>

      <label for="lfzcdmz" class="commentText"><p>I think people really put him in a box when trying to compare to players like Luka or SGA. He’s never going to have the surgical efficiency of an SGA or be the one-man offensive hub that Luka is.</p>

<p>He’s the next great force of nature shooting guard in the mold of guys like Wade, Kobe, and MJ. I’m not saying he’s going to ever match those guys careers, but that’s the kind of player he is and the style of play people should be thinking about when trying to project him as a player. Just a traditional, elite two-way shooting guard with insane clutch scoring abilities and solid playmaking/creation for others.  He’s not gonna fit that heliocentric superstar style that has developed in the last 6-7 years, the kind of player he is at the position he’s at hasn’t been seen in like a decade.</p>

<p>He’ll be an MVP candidate sooner rather than later and I think he’s well on his way to matching Tatum and SGA’s current heights by the time he’s their age four years from now.</p>

<p>People saying Tatum and SGA are currently way better are absolutely right (not even including Doncic because he’s on a completely different level than all three of these other guys imo), but that Ant is already in conversations with MVP candidates that have been in the league twice as long as him says something in and of itself.</p>

<p>Growth isn’t linear, but Ant has an incredible talent for working on weaknesses in his game and has been described by every coach and veteran mentor he’s had as a highly coachable player with an unstoppable work ethic and sponge-like ability to learn. I think he’s absolutely on an MVP-trajectory.</p>

<p>He’s 4 years younger than everyone mentioned and started playing basketball way later than them (around 13-14) I try to remember that when I see some of these passes and decisions 😭</p>

<p>There’s still some defensive issues too (mostly off-ball) but there’s been a clear jump, and he’s always been transparent about working to improve that aspect of his game, so I trust that he’ll be able to put that same effort into playmaking.</p>

<p>Most really underestimate how raw he actually is, I don’t even think it’s public knowledge that he’d only been playing basketball for a few years (like 4) before the draft,</p>

<p>It makes sense that his biggest flaw is the one that requires experience and high BBIQ, it can be taught, and he’s a great and enthusiastic student.</p>

      <label for="lfzftak" class="commentText"><p>I watched just about every game Ant played this season so I&rsquo;ll try to explain where I&rsquo;m at with him.</p>

<p>Ant has proven in the playoffs that he has top 5 upside RIGHT NOW. The problem is that he is quite inconsistent with just about everything to be honest.</p>

<p>He does not know his spots that he goes to if he needs a bucket like Luka or SGA. This results in some inconsistent scoring.</p>

<p>His pull-up shooting efficiency is real bad for high volume shooters. I think he ranked the worst this past season among his high volume peers.</p>

<p>His passing has flashes of being pretty serviceable (he&rsquo;ll never sniff Luka level passing), but he struggles to make the easy reads sometimes and still struggles with double teams. That being said, he really was not asked to deal with this until KAT got injured this year. He has made LEAPS in this department in a very short amount of time.</p>

<p>He shows flashes of being a truly elite on ball defender. You can always see when he flips it on and it is quite a treat, but he can&rsquo;t maintain that level of intensity for very long. He also dies on screens more than I would like to see.</p>

<p>His off ball defense is just not very good right now. He has a habit of ball watching and getting lost.</p>

<p>One thing I like to bring up is this: despite the Wolves being very good this season, this roster is not built around or optimized for Ant. Going into this season, it was uncertain as to who the true #1 option would be or of it would be a 1a/1b situation, so a hierarchy was not established. Ant has proven that he is the first option, but he has to share a lot of touches with KAT bc he&rsquo;s still a supermax player. Ant is also probably a top 3 slasher in the league but is greatly hindered by having Rudy Gobert and his man camped out in the paint at all times. The Wolves also only had two true shooters at most around Ant on the floor (KAT/Conley) most of the time so his gravity was not fully realized bc teams would often just leave Jaden or Slomo open and make them make shots. This is not the roster construction that Ant should have in his prime. He would be much better suited with a roster like OKC imo. Shooters everywhere and space to get to the rim/middy/drive and kick.</p>

<p>All this being said, I think all of this can be fixed. That&rsquo;s what is exciting about Ant. He&rsquo;s young enough to have more than enough time before he&rsquo;s truly in his prime to properly address these things and young enough for the front office to properly build around him before then. I do not think wolves fans are worried about his drive either.</p>

<p>To answer the question. I could see him averaging 30/7/7 with all nba level defense in his prime semi easily. I think his true ceiling is probably higher than this, but players rarely every reach their full potential. So I almost expect him to reach the SGA/Tatum level. I think he could be the best out of these three in the future, but I do not see him getting to Luka levels of offensive production. His defense could definitely close the gap for some people but Luka is truly generational imo and is also still getting better.</p>

      <label for="lfyxigr" class="commentText"><p>If playoff Ant showed up in the regular season this year he&rsquo;d probably get an MVP. He just hasn&rsquo;t put it together in the regular season. That&rsquo;s the only thing that is separating him from the best of the best.</p>

<p>I think there&rsquo;s like 6 guys that are on a similar level, (Ant being among them), after the top 3 of Jokic, Luka, and Giannis. Embiid, SGA, and Tatum are at the top of those players, but I can&rsquo;t separate Embiid from that pack because I don&rsquo;t trust him to stay healthy over the course of a regular season and long playoff run. SGA is the most likely to separate himself, but he just hasn&rsquo;t had the playoff success yet.</p>

He’s so far behind someone like Luka in terms of his vision that I don’t think he’ll ever be able to close the gap. Maybe he can improve as a passer like KD or Kawhi but I doubt he’ll ever reach elite status there.</p>

<p>He might be the few stars who does not give a fuck about making sure his statline looks good. He&rsquo;ll literally stop shooting sometimes and just decide to lock up an opposing player.</p>

<p>But if he ever wants to be MVP, he&rsquo;ll have to start caring about it IMO.</p>

He made a big improvement in playmaking towards the end of last season and during the playoffs, so I would expect a bigger emphasis on that for him during next season which will really help his progression</p>

      <label for="lfzwyq9" class="commentText"><p>Sizzling hot take here, and I know it’s not gonna be popular, but I really don’t think Ant is as far away from Tatum and SGA as most people, I just think he doesn’t get to play in the same 5 out offensive space as those two players which hugely effects how we think of all these guys. SGA and Tatum are operating in some of the most highly spaced out offenses of all time, and I think both would look a little bit worse playing with a more crowded offense in Minnesota. If Ant played with 4 other guys shooting 40 percent from 3, he’d be a lot more efficient, be much better getting to the rim, and his reads would be much more simplified. As it stands, I really don’t think Tatum and SGA have to make the same kinds of complex decisions that Ant has to make in navigating different tradeoffs - their decision making is simplified since everyone around them is knockdown and theirs more court space.</p>

<p>That being said, I’d still both SGA and Tatum are better than current Edwards but I disagree with the idea that there’s some huge gap between them. I think the gap is fairly small.</p>

<p>Not including Luka cuz to me that’s where the actual huge gap is.</p>

      <label for="lfz3kbn" class="commentText"><p>Yeah you’re tripping Ant is young and not injury prone, all he needs is a solid older woman to lock in with so he can stop fucking around and focus on basketball like Jalen Green. And he has excellent work ethic and he’s shooting a better 3 point percentage in his first 3 years than Brons first three years</p>

      <label for="lfzb0m0" class="commentText"><p>Steph curry: Committed relationship, LeBron Commited relationship, when Kobe was married (2001) he won a ring that same year and another one the next year and as soon as that scandal came out he didn’t get another ring until 2009 believe it or not off the court drama influences the court HEAVILY. Harden didn’t start falling off till he started messing around with kardashians, same with ben. Tristan Thompson fell off heavy with kardashians. This mf Jalen Green got Draya pregnant this year and literally went on one of the greatest solo regular season performances we’ve ever seen. Y’all don’t know ball</p>
