      <p>In 1967-68, Lenny Wilkens finished second in the MVP race, just behind Wilt Chamberlain. Despite this, he wasn’t selected for the All-NBA First or Second Teams. Instead, Oscar Robertson, Dave Bing, Jerry West, and Hal Greer were chosen for the guard spots.</p>

<p>He is also the player with the most All-Star appearances who never got an All-NBA Team selection.</p>

      <label for="li8j7d7" class="commentText"><p>It’s been long enough that people have forgotten about it, but Gasol also got fewer points in the voting than Larry Sanders and it doesn’t seem like he should have made the second team either (16 to 12).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.brewhoop.com/2013/5/13/4327910/nba-all-defensive-teams-larry-sanders-bucks" target="_blank">https://www.brewhoop.com/2013/5/13/4327910/nba-all-defensive-teams-larry-sanders-bucks</a></p>

<p>I don’t know what the end explanation was - Larry Sanders played exclusively center and got more votes than Gasol</p>

<p><a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_2013.html#leading_all_nba" target="_blank">https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_2013.html#leading_all_nba</a></p>

<p>This was even with six players making the first team (and five making the second) due to a tie between Noah and Chandler</p>

<p>At the very least the NBA definitely moved some things around in a way that resulted in Marc Gasol being on an all-defensive team. The very next year, coaches lost the power to vote on all-defensive teams</p>

      <label for="li8j7be" class="commentText"><p>No it’s definitely the other way around. LeBron had 52 total points from voting for all defense. Gasol had only 12, the least of anyone even on the second team. Three guys who didn’t even make either all defense team had more votes than Gasol but he made it due to position limitations. It honestly wasn’t even close when it comes to all defense voters.</p>

      <label for="lia9pek" class="commentText"><p>You do realize voters for All-Defense and DPOY are different, right? This discrepancy happening means nothing. Gasol was robbed of First Team All-Defense and deserved his DPOY, there&rsquo;s not a defensive metric that LeBron beat him. Gasol was 4th, 2nd and 1st in defensive rating, DWS and DBPM, had more stocks and had a -6.9 defensive on/off.</p>

Bill Russell only making first team All NBA in <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> of his MVP seasons is also a result of this. If media was voting for awards we can assume that Russell would have fewer MVPs. I think thats really interesting because you get the feeling that players today would vote for pure hoopers and scorers for awards.</p>

<p>has a DPOY ever guarded the worst offensive player on the other team for the majority of every game?? I doubt there is even an all-defense player that fits that description besides your hero, I&rsquo;m open to suggestions though</p>

<p>Lebron never guarded centers other than rare switches where he got bullied almost every time&hellip;..</p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t guard point guards, except on rare aggressive switches where he had no need to stay in front, just apply pressure (with a generation whistle, almost no fouls called on him the whole miami tenure lol)</p>

<p>Wade and Battier and Bosh did all the heavy lifting every possession</p>

<p>saying he actually guarded 5s and 1s is such a tell lol, watch mediocre david west put him under the hoop over and over again</p>

<p>what happened when bron guarded Jet in 2011?? shut him down right? He kept switching onto dirk too right, because 4s would have been easy to slow down&hellip;. right?</p>

<p>He really really really didn&rsquo;t, unless all you watched was highlights and analyst shows&hellip;. he sat on the worst offensive player the vast majority of every game of his career, relaxing. When he does matchup with scorers in the playoffs, they usually have great offensive series lol</p>

<p>Paul pierce, durant, paul george, Jet, just say you don&rsquo;t know how to watch defense, saves us both a lot of time and you from having to attack nothing because you have nothing better to add</p>

He had 36 points, more than everyone on second team and more than two guys on first team. In Gasol’s year, he had only 12 points, the least amount of anyone on either first or second team, and less than three players who didn’t even make either team and were left off due to position limits. That same season, LeBron had 53 points from voting so it wasn’t even close. Gasol was closer to not making either all defensive team than being on first team that year.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Behind Oscar for much of his career, yes. Cousy was out of the League by 1963, and Wilkens played from 61-75. Interestingly, in the year he was 2nd in MVP voting, Dave Bing was All NBA 1st Team.</p>

<p>The All NBA Team was based on positions, but it was just bucketed into Guards, not PG and SG as separate spots. There were a lot of good guards when he played, that switched between PG and SG, like Jerry West, Hal Greer, Earl Monroe, Hondo, etc.</p>

      <label for="libb5dh" class="commentText"><p>For some context on the Wilkens trade&hellip;</p>

<p>Leading up to Wilkens&rsquo;s final year with the Hawks there was some off-court issues that simmered between Wilkens and Hawks coach Richie Guerin. The two had enjoyed a good working relationship - Guerin had made Wilkens the team captain early on and encouraged Wilkens to consider a career in coaching. In the offseason, though, Guerin was invited to travel to South America on a basketball publicity tour sponsored by the US State Department. Guerin could invite two players and their wives, a sort of fun vacation in the offseason. Guerin, though, didn&rsquo;t extend an invite to the team captain and this upset Wilkens.</p>

<p>Supposedly Wilkens and Guerin had a private meeting and buried the hatchet, and the team went on to have a successful season - they went 56-26 and won the Western Division, but lost 2-4 in the first round of the playoffs against the Warriors. But behind the scenes, tensions persisted. Reportedly, there was a social engagement the team held for the players&rsquo; wives and at that event the topic of the South American trip came up. No idea what was said, but some of the players&rsquo; wives left early in response to the discourse, including Mrs. Wilkens.</p>

<p>At the end of the season, the St. Louis Hawks owner sold the team to a group in Atlanta. The new owners agreed to negotiate a new contract with Wilkens, but stipulated that they&rsquo;d only pay him 2/3rds of his salary and only release the last <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> at the end of the season if his attitude was deemed satisfactory.</p>

<p>It was clear that the relationship wasn&rsquo;t going to work and various teams made trade offers. The Hawks accepted an offer from the Sonics - they got Walt Hazzard in exchange for Wilkens.</p>

<p>In his first season with the Sonics, Wilkens had even better numbers than in his previous season when he was 2nd in MVP voting. That MVP year (1968) his line was 20.0/5.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>.3, and in his first year in Seattle (1969) he put up a 22.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub>.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>.2 (and was again an All Star). The next year (1970), Wilkens became a player/coach for the Sonics, becoming (if I&rsquo;m not mistaken) the second black head coach in NBA history. (Bill Russell was first, and Al Attles would join the ranks midway through the 1970 season.)</p>

<p>More details in this <em>Sports Illustrated</em> article from the 1970 preseason: <a href="https://vault.si.com/vault/1969/11/24/sweety-cakes-runs-the-sonics" target="_blank">https://vault.si.com/vault/1969/11/24/sweety-cakes-runs-the-sonics</a></p>

<p>The article had this to say about Wilkens&rsquo;s elevation to coach:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a sense, too, Wilkens&rsquo; hiring was more significant than Russell&rsquo;s was. Russell, after all, was an exceptional case; if, instead of wanting to be coach, he had expressed a desire to be Miss Massachusetts, the Celtics would no doubt have arranged for it. The Sonics had no pressure on them. They also had the perfect white candidate right at hand in Forward Tom Meschery, the mustachioed poet, who shaved off his beard so journalists would be spared the temptation of referring to him as &ldquo;the bearded bard of the backboards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>General Manager Vertlieb passed over Meschery for the top job on purely technical grounds, deciding that since Wilkens was already the floor leader at guard he was the logical man to guide the team if the Sonics wanted a player-coach. (Vertlieb appointed Meschery as Wilkens&rsquo; assistant.) &ldquo;The matter of race never entered my mind.&rdquo; says Vertlieb, the kind of man whose words can be taken at full face value. &ldquo;I always felt Lenny would be a success in whatever he tried. I just never thought of him as a coach until I needed a coach. And then I chose him because he was the best man to coach the Seattle Super-Sonics.&rdquo;</p>
