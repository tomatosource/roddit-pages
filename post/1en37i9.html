      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1en37i9/why_the_jazz_didnt_trade_lauri_and_why_lauri/"><p>Why the Jazz didn&rsquo;t trade Lauri, and why Lauri doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;ruin the tank&rdquo;</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Unless you haven&rsquo;t been on social media recently, you&rsquo;ve likely seen that the Utah Jazz just inked 27yo MIP Lauri Markkanen to a 5-year, $238 million deal. With how much attention he&rsquo;s gotten from media circuits and rumor mills over the past month or so, there&rsquo;s been a lot of discourse about this move and what it means for the direction of the franchise. I&rsquo;m a lifelong Jazz fan, and over the course of the last year, I&rsquo;ve really taken to this iteration of the team, and Lauri specifically. Out of the 55 games that he played for our team last season, I probably watched upwards of 40 in their entirety. I went to games with my dad, bought his jersey, actually got my wife to watch sports, and overall had a really great time rooting for him and the team, lumps and all. I care about this team, and don&rsquo;t look forward to the day when Lauri doesn&rsquo;t suit up for the Jazz anymore.</p>

<p> I also happen to be something of an obsessive, chronically online loser that cares way too much about tall guys putting a ball in a basket. As such, I&rsquo;ve followed and thought about the Jazz discourse over the last month quite a bit. Now that the dust has settled a bit, the most common take among the greater NBA community seems to be something like this:</p>

<p> &rdquo;Is Danny Ainge stupid? With this signing, they&rsquo;ve ruined their tank&ndash;doomed to not be good enough to contend, but also not be bad enough to have a chance at Cooper Flagg. Lauri&rsquo;s a good player, but why would the Jazz do this when they could have traded him for 4 FRPs and bottomed out for a stacked 2025 draft? He&rsquo;s not gonna be the guy that wills this franchise to a championship&ndash;the Jazz need their number one option, and he&rsquo;s not it. Enjoy the 10th pick, I guess!&rdquo;</p>

<p> If you don&rsquo;t really follow the Jazz, I get why you buy this. But the more I think about it, the more convinced I become that this is a lazy narrative that doesn&rsquo;t give consideration to the nuances and difficulties of managing an NBA roster and building a championship contender.</p>

<p> There are a lot of true statements here: the Jazz don&rsquo;t have their number one guy, they need that guy to have a shot at a championship, and they aren&rsquo;t maximizing their chances of drafting him. Lauri will win the Jazz games that they otherwise would lose. The heart of the issue here is lottery odds. There have been volumes upon volumes written about how to build a championship NBA team, and everyone seems to have a different opinion on how to get the job done that they&rsquo;re very confident in.</p>

<p> I submit to you that when all is said and done, winning an NBA championship is extremely simple: get lucky. There is no guarantee, no &ldquo;capturing the Flagg&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s just getting lucky. Are the Jazz going to get Cooper Flagg? Probably not. But you know what, Brooklyn Nets fans, I mean no disrespect here, but you probably aren&rsquo;t going to get him either. Pistons fans, you&rsquo;re probably not going to get him. Blazers fans, you&rsquo;re probably not going to get him. Someone is going to get him, but whoever you are, it&rsquo;s probably not going to be you. If you do get him, he might be everything you&rsquo;ve ever hoped for and alter the trajectory of your franchise. He also might not. Personally, I think he&rsquo;s going to be a fantastic player, but as fans of the 2017-2018 Celtics are all too aware of, fantastic players aren’t immune to breaking their legs 5 minutes into the season.</p>

<p> All of that said, there are, of course, things that you can do to maximize your odds of landing a great pick. But blindly doing everything possible to maximize your chances of winning big without considering the potential costs and benefits of your decisions is a dangerous game to play. Coming back around to Lauri, let&rsquo;s take a shot at the costs and benefits of having him on the roster:</p>

<p> As of right now, with Lauri Markkanen locked up on a long-term deal, the FanDuel sportsbook has the Jazz&rsquo;s regular season win O/U at 27.5. That&rsquo;s tied with the Bulls for the 5th worst O/U in the league (currently ranked above Detroit, Washington, Portland, and Brooklyn). When you dive into the weeds, this makes a lot of sense. The Jazz&rsquo;s 23-24 record of 31-51 is quite deceiving. After selling on two key pieces at the trade deadline, Kelly Olynyk and Simone Fontecchio, the Jazz had the worst post-deadline record in the NBA: 5-25. Before you point out that they shut Lauri down to tank, Lauri played in 13 of those games. Guess what our record was? 1-12.</p>

<p> So let&rsquo;s say we sell Lauri for a pick-based package. We&rsquo;re already pretty bad with him, but how much worse are we without him? It&rsquo;s impossible to truly quantify, but there are advanced statistics that can at least give us a reasonable estimate. According to Basketball Reference, Lauri had 6.2 win shares in the 23-24 season. According to the DunksAndThrees EPM database, he came in at 8.3 estimated wins for the season. I&rsquo;m not suggesting in any way that this is a perfect extrapolation, but let&rsquo;s split the difference and say that Lauri is worth 7 wins. Let&rsquo;s say that a replacement-level player worth 1 win (the NBA median according to DunksAndThrees) comes back as salary filler, and the Jazz have replaced 7 wins with 1. That would move our projected O/U down 6 wins, to 21.5. Where does that get us? Well, actually not very far. We leapfrog Detroit (25.5) and are tied with Portland for the 3rd worst O/U in the league. Factoring in coin flips for breaking the tie between <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>, the Jazz would go from a 9.75% chance at Flagg to a 13.25% chance&ndash;a 3.5% increase.</p>

<p>So the question that the Jazz front office faces is this: would you rather have Lauri Markkanen and a 9.75% chance at Flagg, or a 13.25% chance at Flagg and a cache of draft picks that are quite unlikely to produce another player of Lauri&rsquo;s caliber?</p>

<p> If you picked the second option, I&rsquo;m not going to point the finger and say you&rsquo;re a dumbass. You&rsquo;re just more risk-tolerant than I am.</p>

<p> Here&rsquo;s a quick thought experiment to solidify the principle: Let&rsquo;s say that I knock on your door with a choice. You either get one lottery ticket that has a 15% chance of winning <span class="math inline">\(1,000, or you get a crisp \)</span>100 bill. Be completely honest with yourself, what would you choose? In spite of the fact that the expected value of the lottery ticket (<span class="math inline">\(150) exceeds the value of \)</span>100, I would bet that at least 90% of people take the <span class="math inline">\(100. Why? For most people, that cost just isn't worth the uncertainty. Now, if it's a choice between the same lottery ticket and \)</span>10, that&rsquo;s a different story. The uncertainty is the same, but the opportunity cost is much lower.</p>

<p> Much like you probably wouldn&rsquo;t point a finger at someone taking the <span class="math inline">\(100 and say &quot;man, what a dumbass! They just missed out on a chance at \)</span>1,000!&ldquo;, I personally wouldn&rsquo;t point a finger at the Jazz FO for saying that the cost of maximizing their lottery odds is just too high.</p>

<p> I&rsquo;m not writing this novel purely in the defense of a single Utah Jazz FO decision. I&rsquo;m writing this because I think that it&rsquo;s helpful to be reminded as fans that managing an NBA franchise is hard. It&rsquo;s not as simple as flipping the &ldquo;contention/tanking&rdquo; switch. You can do everything right, but without luck on your side, you can still come up short. League executives shouldn&rsquo;t be immune to our criticism, but I do think that we can give a little bit more grace. And when we do criticize a move (or a lack of a move), we should at least recognize that we are missing a gargantuan amount of relevant information.</p>

<p> If you read all of this, thanks for humoring me.</p>

      <label for="lh3doge" class="commentText"><p>I agree with everything you are saying, but to play devil&rsquo;s advocate to engage in discussion: one of the reasons to tank in this draft is because there are about 5 guys at the top of the draft worth tanking for. Your post may be putting too much emphasis on Cooper Flagg when it&rsquo;s not <em>just</em> Cooper Flagg.</p>

<p>In fact, Ainge built a championship team off of the 3rd pick in 2 drafts that had clear #1&rsquo;s he <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> pick. Ainge is THE guy you want picking at the top of a draft because he&rsquo;s proven to be great at it.</p>

<p>The odds then aren&rsquo;t about the small chance of getting the #1 pick, but attempting to guarantee a top 5 pick imo.</p>

<p>All that said, I STILL agree with your conclusion. I&rsquo;d rather have good odds at getting a top 5 pick and a guarantee of having an All-Star level player (Markkanen) vs. just having a guarantee at a top 5 pick.</p>

<p>That said, I do think Markkanen is still a valuable trade asset and they could trade him before the 2025-2026 season to tank for the 2026 draft.</p>

      <label for="lh3r72s" class="commentText"><p>At the same time, I feel that one of the main reasons they didn&rsquo;t trade him was because the package was simply not appealing enough. If it&rsquo;s really true that neither Podziemski or Kuminga was available and they develop as expected as Steph declines, the value of those picks are significantly lower.</p>

<p>The Timberwolves look to be a top team for the period in which their picks are due. The Cavs don&rsquo;t look so shabby either with Mitchell signing an extension and the young talent they have. At best, those will convert to low-lottery picks to mid-late first rounders by the time they convey.</p>

<p>Trading Lauri and GSW retaining Podziemski and Kuminga is similarly going to be late-lottery, mid-first round picks in the post-Steph era. Even if they trade Lauri, feels like the Nets and a few other teams could be worse.</p>

      <label for="lh3eyb3" class="commentText"><p>Interesting read/skim. One thing I didn&rsquo;t see and the reason I&rsquo;d embrace the tank this year and maybe next is that it&rsquo;s not just Flagg or bust. There are some really exciting non-Flagg prospects in both of the next two classes. While the odds of getting the no.1 pick may be low either way a proper tank can get you a really decent chance at a top 4 pick.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m the Jazz I think they did the right thing in hanging onto the good player they have that is still fairly young. It&rsquo;s just gonna be a bit awkward to navigate the next couple years when these are prime tanking drafts and you have a good player in his prime and a seemingly good coach that is gonna keep trying to win.</p>

Since you said you like and care for the current iteration of this team, what do you want to happen with some of the pieces surrounding Lauri on this team, namely Clarkson, Collins and Sexton? Are you expecting them to stay with the team past the rebuild phase with the younger players on the team like George and Kessler or would it be more likely that they&rsquo;re traded?</p>

<p>It’s funny how Jazz fans are ok with this move but fans of other teams are not. Similar to OKC fans being fine with their direction of accumulating assets but the rest of the NBA fans were not, hiding their jealousy of how promising of a future OKC was getting. Jazz don’t need to take scraps for Lauri and they already have a boatload of picks.</p>

<p>Sure but this isn&rsquo;t some person, this is a front office.</p>

<p>If I am taking a risk, it&rsquo;s not just about the first pick it&rsquo;s also about drafting prospects that can be as good as Shai that went at Pick 11 or maybe luck out with a 29th pick like with Derrick white.</p>

<p>End of the day, Jazz should do what&rsquo;s best for their own business. I understand that having Lauri fills the seat and that goes a long way. I am just disappointed that I will not see him in playoff games just to see how he pans out.</p>

      <label for="lh3iydg" class="commentText"><p>Thought this was really well written. I am not an Utah jazz fan. Been a laker fan all my life but I don’t understand the hate people were giving Utah for doing this. First of all I think they are saving a little money by extending him this year instead of next year. I get they can’t trade him this season but they can certainly trade him next offseason if they really wanted too and might get even better offers since he will be under contract. </p>

<p>Also idk why people think this is gonna turn the jazz into like a 35,40 win team or something. Utah isn’t good. They are very young In a stacked west. Even if they don’t trade off guys like clarkson or collins at the deadline they are still probably bottom 2 or 3 in the west. </p>

<li>Regardless of how hard they&rsquo;re tanking, the Jazz should pay <em>somebody, .</em> The Jazz had the second-lowest salary in the league (more than a 10% gap with the next lowest team), and the way league accounting and the CBA works (where the players are guaranteed a set percentage of basketball-related income and the big market teams heavily subsidize the small market teams) you probably don&rsquo;t want to be the owner behind all the other owners in salary by a huge amount. Not for a hard reason, but for soft reasons. Pull your weight in keeping the business going.</li>
<li>It makes sense to pay somebody who has trade value. Yes it is good to have players on rookie contracts and small deals who take up less cap space, but it is also good to have some salary you can put into deals if you need to. If you have no desirable trade assets who make higher salaries, that locks you out of possible trades that might show up by surprise, as well as out of being the third team in a trade that doesn&rsquo;t match up because of salary, as teams might be locked out of salary aggregation or out of large mismatches in salary in trades by the aprons. Utah has only one other player making more than $20 million - and John Collins is only the 59th highest player in the league. Plus by paying a guy like Markkanen who is still young and who you can trade away in a year or two means you aren&rsquo;t too stuck with that contract on the books if/when you want to pay someone else more.</li>
<li>Timing matters. Ainge had great timing with the Mitchell and Gobert trades, taking advantage of the situation in a moment where he could set the market. He had great timing with the KG/Paul Pearce trade, dealing them right before it was apparent that their value wasn&rsquo;t there anymore. Forcing yourself to trade Lauri this offseason when you don&rsquo;t have to is bad timing. You don&rsquo;t want to be in a situation where the teams you are dealing with know that you are facing a deadline that is going to make you fold in negotiations, like a contract extension or trade deadline. If the Warriors were the leading suitor for Markkanen, and they figured Ainge <em>had</em> to trade Markkanen by a certain date because of the rules around extending contracts in order to trade them by the trade deadline, they can lowball Ainge a bit on what they&rsquo;re willing to offer. Even if the Jazz would have been better off in the immediate term by not extending Lauri and instead trading him essentially for picks, the signal this would send in terms of weakness in negotiation would hurt them in future deals. Plus if you do end up trading Lauri you&rsquo;ll still probably get more for him than you would have gotten before when people thought you might be in a rush.</li>

      <label for="lh3gwnc" class="commentText"><p>Laurie held out to sign so he couldn&rsquo;t be traded. Ainge didn&rsquo;t have a choice. There was no option but to convince LM to let the Jazz send him to a contender and he doesn&rsquo;t want to go&hellip; right now. It&rsquo;s not complicated.</p>

<p>But as far as the Jazz getting the best pick&hellip; If they trade Clarkson they can quite possibly be the worst team in the league. John Collins is probably gone too. But Clarkson is a playmaker. Without playmakers a team&rsquo;s offense is predictable and they get stuck in the mud.</p>

<p>You also know as soon as LM gets a hang nail, he&rsquo;s resting.</p>

      <label for="lh3wf4e" class="commentText"><p>Your analysis is good but you ignored one key component. The Thunder own the pick if it&rsquo;s 8th or worse. If Utah finished 6th and gets bad lottery luck that pick could go to OKC and that would be a waste of a bad season. I don&rsquo;t necessarily think it&rsquo;s likely but there is at least a real chance that happens with LM back.</p>

      <label for="lh3tth5" class="commentText"><p>I think you make a lot of good points but I still just don’t really agree. For one, and I know I’m in the minority on this one, but I don’t like Lauri’s contract. Nearly $50M a year for a guy who plays no defense, can’t handle the ball, and misses a quarter of every season. For two, it’s not just about the #1 pick. The top 5 are good prospects and Utah isn’t one of the 5 worst teams (Detroit, Brooklyn, Washington, Charlotte, Portland). For three, while I agree that luck has a lot to do with it, you also need to put yourself in the position to be lucky. With Lauri’s injury history and Utah’s commitment to winning, I think the Jazz are putting themselves in a position to be unlucky.</p>

<p>Let me tell you about my Knicks: we never fully committed to the tank. We just sucked naturally but tried to win. KP went down in January, and we only won 3 games after that. Meanwhile the Mavs spent the entire year pulling their starters in the 4th quarter- this is the difference between Luka Doncic and Kevin Knox.</p>

      <label for="lh3vofx" class="commentText"><p>Appreciate the analysis, and agree to an extent with the perspective of not trading Lauri. A few counterpoints:</p>

<p>-As has been mentioned a few times already, this draft is much better and deeper than just Flagg. What you should analyze is the odds of landing in the top-4 and how those odds shift depending on lotto positioning, plus also factor in the odds of being jumped by teams behind you (I don’t think there’s enough worse teams that they convey their pick to OKC this year but falling from 6 to 8 is still a bad outcome).</p>

<p>-It’s also not just about this year, it’s about next year’s draft too, which is also supposed to be deep with some high-end prospects at the top too. And next year Utah’s pick is only top-8 protected so much higher odds of losing a lotto pick next year.</p>

<p>-There’s also an unusual balancing act between “yes keep a guy who wants to stay in a small market” and “as a player is Ainge the GM you trust in that scenario?” Maybe he understands the difference between Boston and Utah but skepticism is understandable.</p>

<p>-A lot of this is moot if Utah wasn’t getting premium assets in return. A Gobert-level return was unrealistic from their end, but if GSW stopped at Moody and a couple protected picks that wasn’t going to be enough either.</p>

<p>-With the new cap rules, I don’t know that it becomes easier to trade Lauri next offseason. A growing number of teams are going to be unable to aggregate salaries to trade for him, and other teams are clearly blinking at the second apron rules. Plus instead of 1-2 rotation pieces being enough for matching salary it’s now going to be 2-4. It becomes a harder needle to thread</p>

      <label for="lh3zkxd" class="commentText"><p>This move now means if the Jazz do trade Lauri the team taking him will have to dump some salary now too, so not only will they get picks but they&rsquo;ll also receive a player or two as well to match salary.</p>

<p>Typical Ainge strengthening his chances to get as much as possible back.</p>

<p>I think he&rsquo;s eyeing up some OKC picks as, in my opinion, Lauri would work in their system whilst also bringing some extra height too. This contract now means as well as picks Utah should receive a salary dump player or two also. Not as bad as a lot of people are making out tbh.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You need more strategies for building a team than just the draft.</p></li>

<li><p>The contract gives them another asset to use how they see fit. If they successfully build through the draft over the next two years great, you have a solid core to compete in three years. If they don’t they still have a tradable 29 year old locked into a deal. They can also wait until it is expiring in 4 years and flip it then.</p></li>
