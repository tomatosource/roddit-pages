    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Uk fan here, I’ve recently started getting more and more into the nba (been watching for years but casually) and I’m just now starting to grasp certain concepts like how the salary cap works and the mechanics behind trades and stuff like that</p>

<p>However, I keep hearing that San Antonio who are historically very successful have a “small market size” and the knicks who have been shit for 20 years are in the “biggest market&rdquo;</p>

<p>Is this related to the population of the city the team is based in or popularity of basketball or something? Maybe how much fan engagement and revenue the team brings in. This is one concept I dont really get and when I tried Googling it, the results were just values of how much teams are worth</p>

      <label for="l7eemgy" class="commentText"><p>size/popularity of the city , is a general way to think about it. Small market team just means small city team - relatively small in comparison to the big cities like NY, LA, CHI</p>

      <label for="l7efgxz" class="commentText"><p>In general, yes. It supposed to be a representation of the &lsquo;market&rsquo; that teams are in. That market is generally understood as the greater metro area.</p>

<p>However, it isn&rsquo;t really best suited for basketball where there is profit sharing and a salary cap, and all the owners are billionaires. Its origins from baseball refer to how much money a team can spend in an open cap environment. That money usually is derived from the local TV deals. The Yankees were a big market team because of lucrative local TV contracts. The Pittsburgh pirates are small market because they have less revenue to spend.</p>

<p>In basketball, it&rsquo;s largely irrelevant, and used retroactively to justify media bias/coverage. In the NBA, small/big market should really just be popularity. The Boston metro area is smaller than many teams&rsquo; cities, yet people consider the Celtics a large market team.</p>

      <label for="l7efq58" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s purely about the local population that would follow/watch the team, which directly impacts how much money a team can make (and would be willing to spend).  Local tv contracts, ticket prices, merchandise sales, etc, etc.  Small market teams are at a disadvantage because it&rsquo;s a lot harder for them to make as much money as a large market team.</p>

<p>You can pretty much go by media markets, though there are some instances where teams are actually capturing multiple markets.</p>

      <label for="l7efrkl" class="commentText"><p>Simply put, it’s how many people care about the team enough to watch their games. Some cities do have more of a basketball culture than others, but it’s <em>mostly</em> just about how big the city is.</p>

      <label for="l7egmfv" class="commentText"><p>I know that no one asked, but this is pretty much single handedly why I will never believe that the NBA (or other professional sports for that matter, but it&rsquo;s usually the NBA that&rsquo;s called out) is rigged.</p>

<p>After Jordan left, the longest running dynasty was the San Antonio Spurs.</p>

<p>A vast majority of Finals don&rsquo;t go to game 7, resulting in a ton of lost revenue for the league.</p>

<p>The best prospects of the last 25 years went to Cleveleand (Lebron) and San Antonio (Wemby).</p>

<p>Indiana vs NY in this year&rsquo;s playoffs went to game 7 and Indiana won the game easily.</p>
