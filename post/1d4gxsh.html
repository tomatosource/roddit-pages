      <label for="l6ffe0d" class="commentText"><p>The pets maybe… the people would be way harder to socially engineer.  If you are 6 with your current knowledge it would be so painful to sit through 10 years of school, but I would feel like I want to to make the same high school friends but would I even like them as a 33year old meeting them when they are 6.  After that college friends I wouldn’t even really want to goto college because by that time I would have just started mining Bitcoin and made a shit load of money on stocks, baseball and football betting, but I would want to go for the friends which would still be hard to engineer especially if I was placed in a different dorm room or a different dorm building… then meeting my wife again in a totally organic way would be hard. The whole thing would be so difficult if I took that pill it would have to be assuming my life would be totally different.</p>

<p>Also.. I mean I think it would be impossible to fix most events in history but even though it would be hard I would probably want to try as hard as possible to save some people in <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> which would be hard as a 10 year old but I would have 4 years to come up with a plan…. Probably I would try my hardest to convince Rick Rescorla to schedule a test evacuation that morning at 8:00 or 8:30.  Idk how I would do it as a 10 year old but he was very cautious so I think that it would be possible to convince him.</p>

<p>Of course if this was successful you can honestly kiss literally every plan about making your life the same but better goodbye because the world is going to be wildly different.</p>

      <label for="l6fjt42" class="commentText"><p>Correct approach. All these people are talking about becoming billionaires because of their knowledge of what happens - what if that means you live a hollow, loveless, empty life with your billions? If I go back, do I never meet/fall in love with my wife? Do I find someone else or do I become jaded and never find true love?</p>

<p>This literally sounds like a sci-fi plot/twilight zone episode. Man goes back to age six and becomes the world&rsquo;s richest, most powerful man. Once he reaches the age he rewound at, he realizes he is utterly unhappy and unfulfilled because of how non-genuine and planned out his &ldquo;new life&rdquo; actually is.</p>

<p>The 10 million would make me set forever and allow me to grow from here, with my loved ones, no risks. I&rsquo;ll take that any day.</p>

I had a buddy end himself over &ldquo;the love of his life&rdquo; cheating on him. Family members that I lost in tragic accidents or that just died of natural causes before I even knew they were sick. Things like that.

      <label for="l6em0ts" class="commentText"><p>I personally don&rsquo;t see why in these hypothetical questions someone would choose to turn back time if they don&rsquo;t have control over how much they turn back. Yeah the person could get rich and stuff based on knowledge they have now but at the same the first alternative life decision they make may make them have an even worse life or outright less to immediate death. Not only that anyone you ever did like in this life becomes non existent even if you go back to a point where that person is alive. The reason being choices are what make a person who they are. If you met a person at e.g. age 7 who you became best friends with, you will never ever be best friends with that person when you turn back time. Yes you could meet the &ldquo;body&rdquo; of the person but at that stage any changes you made to your life would drastically impact their life too. They may not like the same things you remember them liking, they may not have the same friends, or even family.</p>

<p>So without all these things they are essentially a different person. You may not even get along anymore. The same goes for family, what if you have a younger sibling/ cousin in this life but when you turn back time they are never born? Even if they are born, they took will be a completely different person. You have a sibling that likes unicorns? Nope next timeline the sibling hates unicorns and is actually wanted for horrible crimes. Overall it&rsquo;s not worth it in my opinion.</p>

<p>You’re implying that the universe is not deterministic. The Big Bang contained the blueprint for the entire unfolding of the universe. There is only “one timeline”.</p>

<p>The wrinkle here is OP the time traveller. Their accumulated knowledge would change their personal timeline, and that of those impacted by them directly.</p>

<p>That best friend at age 7 would still exist, but the timeline would start changing from OP’s point of entry. That favorite younger cousin, born 5 years after OP returned at age 6 may never be born, etc.</p>

      <label for="l6es4iv" class="commentText"><p>That still doesn&rsquo;t really change anything though from my point. The reason &ldquo;I&rdquo; wouldn&rsquo;t want to go back in time is because I &ldquo;would&rdquo; experience things completely different. Even if in this hypothetical situation a hypothetical &ldquo;one timeline&rdquo; still existed, that doesn&rsquo;t really change anything from my personal point of view. Even if literally every single other person experienced the &ldquo;one timeline&rdquo;, I wouldn&rsquo;t be. So that &ldquo;one timeline&rdquo; would mean nothing to me in the slightest. My life experience would still be experienced differently by me, it would just have to be, as in my first timeline I never had the knowledge of going back in time, but in my second timeline I would have that knowledge. The future wouldn&rsquo;t be able to play out the same, as the past had been changed with just that 1 thing. So it would be impossible for a future to stay the same if the past isn&rsquo;t the same past.</p>

Also you might not end up being a 13 year old billonaire but rather the child of a billonaire atleast for the media</p>

<li><p>I don&rsquo;t know your mother&rsquo;s situation, but sometimes early detection and treatment can massively improve the prognosis.</p></li>

<li><p>You could try and help your best friend avoid drowning by either making sure they&rsquo;re lifeguard certified (ensuring strong swimming ability <em>and</em> knowledge on proper water safety) or by interfering with their ability to encounter that specific drowning event.</p></li>

<li><p>Hopefully your foreknowledge helped save your mother. But if worse came to worst, you could sabotage your father and stepmother&rsquo;s relationship. Make sure they never meet, majorly piss her off so she shows her true colors, talk trash about her to your dad, find some dirt, etc</p></li>

You&rsquo;ll have absolutely none of that. You&rsquo;d be the least enthusiastic kid and you wouldn&rsquo;t even be able to put on your favourite tunes to chill, because they haven&rsquo;t been released yet and you wouldn&rsquo;t have the money to buy the thousands of CDs required to build the same library.</p>

      <label for="l6ew4rc" class="commentText"><p>Yeah 10M now vs an open ended aging back to 6yrs old do you wake up tomorrow being 6 or your transported back in time? But even if it’s back in time you would not enjoy the time you’d always be looking for the next thing to predict! You’d become a way different person as you knowing everything you would change your own destiny good or bad a your mind would be mostly 6yrs old not whatever age you started at. No I think the best choice is the 10M now and leave your growing up as is as you might not make it to your age now as being so focused on everything you can predict and some might not be able to handle all that all the time along with pushing people away from being a know it all!!</p>

<p>The first will screw up some things you do, the whole timeline , you would become totaly another person. And have the chance to make much more than the blue option.</p>

<p>The second is just you with a younger body ( rejuvenation ) , where you kind of continue your life ( with explaining to others why you are suddenly young ) . You could be again a child , more energy and even take later a new carrier. Sad part , depending at what age you where set back into the 6y old body , you may loose your &ldquo;older&rdquo; kids of age before you.</p>

<p>With 10 mil, I could comfortably buy a house and enjoy the remainder of my life with one less source of stress.</p>

<p>With restarting my life, I could spend several decades building my life as a savant, getting into the best schools, consulting the highest ranks of government on policy, and becoming potentially wealthier than I could have ever dreamed. Or, hear me out, committed to an asylum with my parents thrown in jail for abusive parenting, advanced knowledge of terrorist attacks and insider trading</p>

Could be fun at first, seeing people you&rsquo;ve lost, trying those sweets that they don&rsquo;t make anymore. But Imagine trying to hit your same highs or avoiding your lows. The anxiety of knowing you gramps is going to die, or that friend is going to move. Things outside of your control. Imagine having to deal with those emotions. Id rather take the 10mil</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t risk making a mistake during the restart and changing something. Like not having a pet I loved. Or stopping my nephews and neices from being born. If I restart, then my family makes more money, and maybe we don&rsquo;t adopt that Beagle who stole my heart. Maybe my sister doesn&rsquo;t have to work that shitty job where she met her awesome husband. Maybe they don&rsquo;t have their babies  who taught me what it really means to love someone more than yourself.</p>

<p>I would love to restart. But gosh, I&rsquo;ve been pretty luck so far.</p>

<p>But at the same time, I could avoid being chased by that dog at the park when  I was 8.</p>

<p>I could help my aunt beat breast cancer faster by telling her sooner, I could save my grandma from dying from brain cancer by warning her when she is still self aware, I could warn my mom sooner about her breast cancer so she wouldn&rsquo;t be in the miserable state she currently is.</p>

<p>I could convince my parents to move to our current house (that my dad already owned but my grandparents lived there, and moved out when we moved there) and leave that awful house we lived at. (The house was decrepit and my mom almost died there in the end, because of a construction accident).</p>

<p>I could get even better grades that I already had with minimal effort and could do even better in highschool.</p>

<p>But&hellip;I know that none of that would work, and I would just go through all that trauma again.</p>

<p>So, in the end, I would choose the money and move out at 18 to a distant place, like I wish I could.</p>
