I suppose I&rsquo;m just wondering what it would take for you to no longer have disdain for him, considering it&rsquo;s been half a decade since he left, you&rsquo;ve won a championship against him, and he seems to have matured quite a bit.</p>

<p>Boston Celtics trade: Rajon Rondo and Dwight Powell</p>

<p>Dallas Mavericks trade: Jae Crowder, Jameer Nelson, Brandan Wright, a 2015 first-round pick (later became Guerschon Yabusele), and a 2016 second-round pick (later became Demetrius Jackson)</p>

<p>LMAO at calling that &ldquo;selling the future&rdquo;. The Celtics actually gave up real assets for Kyrie. Even without Rondo, the Mavs actually ended up on top in terms of value due to Dwight Powell.</p>

<p>The Mavs weren&rsquo;t gonna win before the Rondo trade and they weren&rsquo;t gonna win after the Rondo trade. The biggest reason you don&rsquo;t dislike Rondo more is because it ended up meaning absolutely nothing. Not only that, but there are plenty of Mavs fans that hate Rondo still.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Kyrie fucked up multiple years of title contention on the Celtics due to injury (not his fault) and his immaturity (his fault) before quitting on the Celtics and joining a division rival. Can you see the difference now?</p>

      <label for="l98zyv8" class="commentText"><p>We traded our starting PG, Jae Crowder, who was a great 3nD wing for a decade including on several quite good Boston teams, what ended up being the 16th pick in 2015, and the 45th pick in 2016. That is a pretty hefty price tag for a rental. It’s not our fault you guys screwed up the draft selections lol.</p>

<p>Ironically you gave you your starting PG, Jae Crowder, Ante Zizic, a 2018 1st, and a 2020 2nd for Kyrie, a package almost identical to the one we gave for Rondo, yet yours is “real assets” and ours isn’t lol. And I know you are going to suggest IT was WAY more valuable than a bum like Nelson, so I’ll go ahead and point out that IT had a career RUINING injury at the time of that trade that was hidden initially from the Cavs.</p>

      <label for="l995b1t" class="commentText"><p>Your starting PG averaging less than 8 points and 25 minutes a game?</p>

<p>I had a feeling you would bring up Jae Crowder. He was a throw-in averaging 10 minutes for the Mavs and he improved to a solid starter on the Celtics. And then he was signed by Ainge to the BEST value deal in the NBA at the time he was traded. Pretending Mav&rsquo;s Jae Crowder and Celtic&rsquo;s Jae Crowder are equivalent pieces at the time of the trade is either in bad faith or stupid.</p>

<p>You also say &ldquo;2018 1st&rdquo; but forget(?) to mention it was a high lottery pick and could/should have landed SGA or Mikal Bridges. And this was literally the same Nets team that gave Boston Jaylen Brown and Tatum the previous two years. A couple more losses for the Nets would have put that pick in the range of Luka/JJJ/Trae Young.</p>

<p>And you are using hindsight for IT, but nobody knew the injury would be career-ruining, including the Cavs who got to do their own physical on him.</p>

<p>I know I said above that I wasn&rsquo;t sure if you were dumb or arguing in bad faith. But nobody is this dumb, so I&rsquo;m going with bad faith.</p>

      <label for="l9974qy" class="commentText"><p>Crowder had already shown his ability and potential in the NBA, he was in his 3rd season as a member of the Mavs’ rotation, and was shooting 34% from 3 as a good defender. He wasn’t “just a throw in”.</p>

<p>Also adding multiple what ifs to the description of the pick to make it seem like a bigger asset than it was is funny. It wasn’t a “high lottery pick”, it was barely a top 10 pick. Then saying it “should have been SGA or Mikal” is actively using hindsight, something in the same exact comment you say we shouldn’t do. Then you claim if the Nets had lost more games it would have been better, like that’s not how all picks work in the NBA lmfao.</p>

<p>The Celtics knew enough to immediately trade their MVP candidate after the best season of his career, and their most successful as a team in a long time, and they knew enough to try and hide what they knew from the Cavs. That’s not hindsight.</p>

      <label for="l98q7yi" class="commentText"><p>So basketball aside, the guy has some absolutely batshit crazy beliefs that are not grounded in evidence-based research.</p>

<p>In regards to pure basketball reasons, having followed Kyrie&rsquo;s trade up to his departure, he did almost everything he could wrong with us. Keep in mind, Kyrie was probably (or at least one of) the highest profile/most hype players that the Celtics have ever traded for. We do get free agent signings, but not guys as popular and fun to watch as him. Fans were super excited when the news was announced, and they treated him extremely well when he was with us. For a player of his calibre to seemingly embrace us was unreal.</p>

<p>Makes an ad saying he wants to retire with us and even announces at a press conference that he wants to retire with us. Fans and the media are ready to anoint the guy as the leader of the team, which is what he wanted, because part of the reason he left Cleveland was to get the opportunity to become a leader for a team. And given the Celtic&rsquo;s history and solid cast of supporting players (Brown, Tatum, Horford, Hayward, Smart, etc) what team would be better?</p>

<p>But as you know, when he returns from his injury and we have a lackluster season following an ECF Game 7 postseason run, he constantly deflects blame onto other players (Tatum and Brown in specific) saying they aren&rsquo;t mature enough. During all-star weekend, he was literally caught on video talking with KD saying he was going to leave Boston and link up with him on a different team (later the Nets). In the finals, he is completely checked out and throws the series against the Bucks by constantly trying to defend Giannis 1-on-1.</p>

<p>Since then, he has shown he completely hates our fans and the team by stomping on the team&rsquo;s logo.</p>

<p>Winning the championship definitely helps, but I don&rsquo;t think fans will forgive him. There is absolutely a history and grudges do not die easily. He has yet to apologize for his immaturity in Boston, or if he has, he&rsquo;s deflected blame to someone else (like he always does).</p>

      <label for="l98r54k" class="commentText"><p>Kyrie has a penchant for doing stuff to rile up Boston fans, like calling the team a cult in a recent interview.</p>

<p>Being interviewed with Bob Cousy and speaking with Bill Russell, decided to proclaim he wanted to retire a Celtic, had a mental breakdown, full reversed on that opinion and got really weird and defensive the remainder of the year. Now, we know he was going through some stuff, I get it and respect that knowing what I know now.</p>

<p>Then on the Nets called the fandom trash again - did a couple things to instigate fan hate - one of which burning sage to eliminate bad spirits in TD Garden after Tommy Heinsohn (a beloved HOF Coach, Player and Broadcaster of the Celtics) died months prior. Tommy was always at games and is beloved by all old school fans. His rationale was probably tame and personal to his Native American heritage but in hindsight in the moment, felt like more disrespect to me. The stomping on the Leprechaun thing was another fan slight that didn&rsquo;t go unnoticed. I personally don&rsquo;t give a shit but the hardcore Larry Bird generation fans lost it. Kyrie has always been petty. He&rsquo;s much more grounded now so I ratchet my impression of him down to an annoyance.</p>

<p>At this point, its fun to boo him. Saying awful things to a player in game is super uncalled for, and I would never agree with any of that nonsense. He will never be redeemable in Celtics fans eyes, the above and other reasons, and &lsquo;Fuck Kyrie&rsquo; will be a thing fans will chant because now&hellip; we see it bothers him and makes a tiny edge of advantage for the team.</p>

Would I be disappointed if he went out the way he did in Boston? Absolutely. Would I trade him right now if I knew it would better the team? Absolutely. I would likely be more said for when we lost Dodo, who was with us during the dark years and developed from an undrafted free agent.</p>

<p>In that half decade of &ldquo;maturing&rdquo;:</p>

<ul>
<li>he posted a video claiming the holocaust was a lie,</li>

<li>decided not to get vaccinated, thus</li>
<li>chose not to play half the games of one season,</li>

Obviously I have problems with much of the things you listed, and I wasn&rsquo;t a fan of trading for him due to those reasons.

It was pure agony and then he went and burned all the bridges you possibly can on his way out. His personal growth since then means nothing to me and most Celtic fans, he’ll draw our ire anytime he plays in Boston no matter what- fans love to hate, it’s part of being a high profile athlete, whether he deserves it or not really isn’t that big a part of the equation</p>

<p>Occam&rsquo;s Razor: <em>the simplest, most elegant explanation is to be preferred over more elaborate explanations that require more presumptions.</em></p>

<p>Premise: <strong>Two years and a half years ago</strong> he lost a shit ton of money, was suspended, and became widely viewed as cancerous for any team, due to his statements/actions. People like money, and Kyrie Irving loves to play basketball. And any idiot could see that continuing in the same vein would soon cost Kyrie dearly.</p>

<p>So: either his intellect has sharpened, and he&rsquo;s become more educated, less selfish, less anti-Semitic, less of a conspiracy theorist, and embraced being a good teammate as an innate good, or&hellip;</p>

<p>those sycophants who feed his ego and delusions and prey upon his money made the prospect of losing everything dimly aware to him, managing to convince him to stop acting out and to return to playing basketball full-time&hellip; at least long enough to secure that final big contract before acting out again.</p>

      <label for="l99l77f" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s crazy I was so paranoid that they were going to blow this game that even with like 3 minutes left I wasn&rsquo;t taking it for granted. It wasn&rsquo;t until Kyrie congratulated the Celtics that I realized I could deep breathe and go up and watch the rest of the game with my mom.</p>
