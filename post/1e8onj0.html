Other fanbases claimed Sixers fans coddled Ben too much and made too many excuses for him (which was true). Then after the Hawks series, Philly fans were accused of being too harsh towards Ben when they finally snapped after years of defending him</p>

      <label for="le8ybbo" class="commentText"><p>Unfortunately I think that back injury is a lot more serious than people realize. At his prime though, he could have been great if he continued to develop himself, but he never showed the progression to be better. He came ready-made as an all-star and just never added to his offensive bag and was shown to be useless in the half-court without the ball in his hands.</p>

<p>While he was stepping away from the game, everyone called him mentally soft, and bullied him out of the league.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hindsight that was the red flag. He was improving his understanding and adjusting to the NBA in every way yet getting more conservative with his own shot and willingness to draw fouls.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re scared to shoot and scared to draw contact, I mean that doesn&rsquo;t leave much.</p>

<p>Bum Simmons hurt his back PLAYING VIDEOGAMES, he showed NO PASSION, NO HEART before the back injury. just like that other non competitive bum Markelle Chick Fila Fultz, 76ers draft guys wtih no heart and no toughness. Okafor was another big slug</p>

<p>Back Injury from playing videogames for sitiing out 1 year cause his feelings hurt from Trae Young, god dam NBA fans of today is why the sport sucks now and I went from hardcore, who played in college to point I dont even watch this crap now and not my own team cause Embumm ruined my love for 76ers completely</p>

<p>N if you don&rsquo;t like the NBA, why are you in the sub? Move on mate, find another ting to entertain yourself.</p>

      <label for="le9zx51" class="commentText"><p>After watching his (limited number of) games over the past couple of seasons, I agree. His numbers are mostly bad now, and his intangibles aren&rsquo;t amazing (but also not horrible), but as a viewer you can still consistently identify small flashes that indicate what he&rsquo;s capable of. It really seems like it&rsquo;s in there somewhere, but at this point it will probably never come out.</p>

      <label for="le9exs2" class="commentText"><p>both fultz and simmons had questionable approaches (in different ways) to practice.</p>

<p>simmons famously hired his half brother who had never played professional basketball as his skills coach, and his other half brother as his agent.</p>

<p>there&rsquo;s a lot more noise on what happened to fultz, but there were reports of his skills coach (a family friend) using unorthodox drills, like having fultz sit in a chair laid on the ground to practice shooting.</p>

<p>if he was already suffering from thoracic outlet syndrome, he should&rsquo;ve gone straight to the team instead of doing weird stuff like this to compensate. fultz just seemed to have poor judgment, which may be understandable since there were reports his mother was micromanging his life and installing security cams in his home so she could monitor him.</p>
