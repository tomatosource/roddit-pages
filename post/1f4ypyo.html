</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>In this series, we&rsquo;re going to take a look at some &ldquo;futures&rdquo; <a href="https://decider.com/2018/09/11/rounders-at-20-most-influential-gambling-movie/" target="_blank">bets</a> to gauge the best picks for different awards. Now, these aren&rsquo;t pure predictions as much as indications of value. Someone may be the most likely pick to win MVP at 5:1 odds, but if another player has nearly as good of a chance and is listed at 50:1, that longshot is the better &ldquo;bet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been running this series for three years now and have had some surprising success.</p>

<p>In 2021: if you bet <span class="math inline">\(100 on each post, you'd have made \)</span>2,000 profit, buoyed by Tyler Herro winning <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ph5khd/oc_the_best_bet_series_predicting_the_sixth_man/" target="_blank">Sixth Man of the Year</a>.</p>

<p>In 2022: if you bet <span class="math inline">\(100 on each post, you'd have made another \)</span>2,000 in profit, buoyed by Mike Brown&rsquo;s trophy for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/xm19cz/oc_best_bet_series_predicting_the_coach_of_the/" target="_blank">Coach of the Year</a>.</p>

<p>Last year: if you bet <span class="math inline">\(100 one each post, you'd have made... \)</span>25 in profit. Sooo&hellip; basically enough for a chipotle burrito and guac. But still, a profit is a profit, so let&rsquo;s see if we can keep the streak going this year. For each category, I&rsquo;ll take a look at some viable candidates first, and then make an official recommendation at the end.</p>

<hr>

<p>######<strong>STUDYING THE TRENDS</strong></p>

<p>If you look back at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Coach_of_the_Year_Award" target="_blank">previous winners</a> of the &ldquo;Coach of the Year&rdquo; trophy, you can see that they usually fall into three categories.</p>

<p>A) the coach with the best team (by far). This is an uncommon type of winner, but it&rsquo;s the easiest to predict. If you have the best team, you can make the case that you&rsquo;re the best coach. However, to really win based on this type of campaign, you have to coach the best team BY FAR. A runaway landslide winner, like Secretariat on the track. In fact, the only time Phil Jackson won &ldquo;Coach of the Year&rdquo; was when the Bulls went 72-10. Steve Kerr won the year the Warriors broke that record and went 73-9. A more obtainable number may be Mike Brown&rsquo;s 66-16 year with the Cavs back in 2008-09 or Monty William&rsquo;s 64-18 record in 2021-22. To win with this type of campaign, &ldquo;65&rdquo; wins is a good target number.</p>

<p>B) the coach with the biggest turnaround. The media loves a good narrative, so a coach who can magically flip a switch is always an obvious candidate to win. First-year coaches have an advantage in this regard.</p>

<p>C) the coach with the biggest overachievement based on preseason expectations. More than any other metric, this &ldquo;overachievement&rdquo; is the easiest path to winning the trophy. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s also the hardest to predict.</p>

<hr>

<p>######<strong>CANDIDATES TO COACH THE BEST TEAM (BY FAR)</strong></p>

<p>If &ldquo;65&rdquo; wins is the threshold for a coach to win the award, then Boston&rsquo;s <strong>Joe Mazzulla</strong> (+1000) has the best chance at that. After all, the Celtics went 64-18 last season. Typically, championship teams take their foot off the gas the following season, but Mazzulla may not have an &ldquo;off&rdquo; switch. If he drives them close to 70 wins, he&rsquo;s going to be a top candidate. It feels like the narrative on him has shifted as well, opening the door for him to be recognized.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the coach on the presumed best team in the West has <em>already</em> been recognized, as Oklahoma City&rsquo;s <strong>Mark Daigneault</strong> (+1400) won this trophy last year. It&rsquo;d be extremely hard for him to pull off a repeat. In fact, it&rsquo;s never been done before by Phil Jackson or Gregg Popovich or any coach in the history of the award.</p>

<p>There are some other teams that may contend for the # 1 seed, including: New York&rsquo;s <strong>Tom Thibodeau</strong> (+1000), Philadelphia&rsquo;s <strong>Nick Nurse</strong> (+1200), Minnesota&rsquo;s <strong>Chris Finch</strong> (+1600), Milwaukee&rsquo;s <strong>Doc Rivers</strong> (+2500), and Dallas&rsquo; <strong>Jason Kidd</strong> (+2500). All five likely have a better shot than Daigneault because their top seed would represent a mild surprise.</p>

<hr>

<p>######<strong>CANDIDATES TO COACH THE BIGGEST W-L TURNAROUND</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to a turnaround artist, you have to ask two questions. 1) Can a team vault forward in the standings? And 2), Will the <em>coach</em> be the one getting credit for that?</p>

<p>Given that, new coaches will always have an edge in terms of narrative. Their arrival is easier to track and thus their impact is easier to acknowledge. That bodes well for a new coach like Charlotte&rsquo;s <strong>Charles Lee</strong> (+5000). The Hornets were only 21-61 last year, but injuries played a large role in that. If they can get healthy and get their youngsters to keep improving, this team could flirt with a play-in spot. For Lee to actually <em>win</em> the trophy, you&rsquo;d presume they&rsquo;d need to make the playoffs though. Going 38-44 doesn&rsquo;t usually garner a lot of national attention.</p>

<p>There are a few other veteran coaches who may be in line for a big W-L turnaround as well. The Spurs should improve on their 22-60 record. The Grizzlies should improve on their 27-55 record. The question here is: will their coaches <strong>Gregg Popovich</strong> (+2000) and <strong>Taylor Jenkins</strong> (+900) get the credit for that? Or is that jump too obvious/expected? Both coaches have a lot of respect from the media, so a campaign run is possible. Jenkins is a co-favorite for the award for that reason.</p>

<p>Of course, no one would be a bigger media darling than <strong>J.J. Redick</strong> (+1200) if the Lakers improve from 47-35 and vault up to the 55-win range. But given the age and depth of the roster, that feels more like Hollywood fantasy than reality.</p>

<hr>

<p>######<strong>CANDIDATES TO COACH THE HIGHEST OVERACHIEVEMENT</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to guess which teams will have the best record this year &ndash; it&rsquo;s easy to guess what teams will improve in the standings from last year &ndash; but it&rsquo;s a lot harder to guess what teams will beat current expectations. If we knew that, we&rsquo;d put all our money on over/unders (that is, the Vegas line for predicted win totals.)</p>

<p>We actually ran that exercise with another series and tried to isolate the best &ldquo;overs&rdquo; on the board.</p>

<p>Some of those picks were among playoff teams that were already pretty good though, including Cleveland&rsquo;s 48.0 and Phoenix&rsquo;s 46.5. I like the chances for both teams to exceed those marks. Both teams also have &ldquo;new&rdquo; coaches in <strong>Kenny Atkinson</strong> (+2500) and <strong>Mike Budenholzer</strong> (+2500) as well, which helps add to the narrative appeal. In terms of betting though, we&rsquo;d need a stark jump to make headlines. Cleveland or Phoenix winning 52 games and finishing as the # 3 seed isn&rsquo;t going to be enough; they&rsquo;d need to be either a # 1 or # 2 seed to really get the campaign engines revved up.</p>

<p>The bar will certainly be lower than that for <strong>Quin Snyder</strong> (+4000) in Atlanta. Last year, the team struggled, and this year they&rsquo;ll enter with an over/under of only 36.0 wins. I expect the team to clear that mark and even cross 40 wins. But again, we need some sort of threshold for attention here. The 8th seed would be nice, but not anything to write home about. The 7th seed? 6th seed? Would that be enough to make waves? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>If expectations are the name of the game, then I&rsquo;m dubious about the chances of some of the favorites. Houston&rsquo;s <strong>Ime Udoka</strong> (+900) and Orlando&rsquo;s <strong>Jamhal Mosley</strong> (+1000) <em>already</em> squeezed improvement out of their roster last season and set the bar higher. It&rsquo;ll be difficult for them to keep leaping past it with another big improvement. (Of course, that&rsquo;s what I thought about OKC and Mark Daigneault last season.)</p>

<hr>

<p>######<strong>AT LONG LAST, THE OFFICIAL PICK IS&hellip;</strong></p>

<p>Logically, Taylor Jenkins (+900) may be the most likely winner. That said, I like betting on long shots for this award more than any other. The logic is: if you bet on a coach with long odds, you&rsquo;re betting on a coach with low <em>expectations</em>. And as we stated prior, exceeding expectations is a great way to win this particular trophy.</p>

<p>This strategy worked the first year with Mike Brown (who won at 25:1) and nearly worked last season with Chris Finch (who was listed at 20:1 for Minnesota).</p>

<p>Rather than aim for that narrow bull&rsquo;s eye, let&rsquo;s spread the wealth and take shots with FOUR of those long shots: <strong>Kenny Atkinson</strong> (+2500),  <strong>Mike Budenholzer</strong> (+2500), <strong>Quin Snyder</strong> (+4000), and <strong>Charles Lee</strong> (+5000). That&rsquo;s not hedging our bets or playing it safe; even with four picks, that&rsquo;s a collective risk. In fact, if you weight it evenly, winning any of the four would pay over 8X on your bet.</p>

<p>Funny enough we picked Mike Budenholzer and 3 of his former assistants (from Atlanta). It was mostly a coincidence, but it&rsquo;s a testament to the effectiveness of his coaching tree.</p>
