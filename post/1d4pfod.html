      <label for="l6g03va" class="commentText"><p>I had my German 2 teacher exempt me from my final exams and gave me an A after the assistant principal force me to back out of going to Germany because i was ‚Äúto sad and would ruin the trip for other students‚Äù  so 5000 saved up for nothing.  She felt so bad and bitched out the assistant principal and wanted to help me come to Germany but the damage was already done. I lost my passion to learn German since i didn‚Äôt have a goal and hearing that i was just going to ruin the trip hurt. So my teacher help me and i panic knowing i was going to fail l.  I love my German teacher&hellip;she was the best person i ever had  Edit: a update cus i didn‚Äôt expect people to like my story hah. I‚Äôm actually relearning German after 2 years so i can go with my own group. I want to explore a new place and i think it will be good for me since I‚Äôve been in a bad depressive rut the last 4 years. Also hopefully it will help me feel better and maybe help me with some trauma with my abusive dad.   I have also had a Spanish teacher in an old high school i went for in freshman year who hated my guts and would get me in trouble for anything. She wrote me up for ISS(in school suspension) for drawing on my homework. It was awful so having my two German teachers who were like 2 parents to me was amazing.</p>

<p>For instance, if your world history teacher was competent, your class studied how Hitler tricked his way into power and dismantled German democracy, how 1800s states used propaganda, racism and religion to excuse their imperialist greed, how various 1900s genocides evolved from mere bigotry to death camps. You should have studied those things so that as a voting adult citizen&hellip; you know how to spot fascists, how to spot when your state is manipulating you, how to spot the beginnings of a genocide before it gets to the death camps. Then using that awareness, you would then be able do something as a citizen and a voter to stop such atrocities from repeating.</p>

<p>Social studies doesn&rsquo;t make you a better English major. It makes you a better citizen.</p>

<p>OP could very likely get better, and you have no idea why they&rsquo;re depressed. They could have a bad home, they could have lost someone close that was essential to their well-being.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You people like to pretend they are going to make an effort when they are 18 years old, but after their whole lifes doing nothing the majority of them Will be Happy at mediocrity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it seems you know OP&rsquo;s personally, and know their history? If not, how are you able to speak on how they&rsquo;ve &ldquo;been all their life&rdquo;. I suggest you leave conversations about this topic to people that know what they&rsquo;re talking about, and make an effort to not judge people&rsquo;s entire personality off of a meme.</p>

<p>If the teacher saw they had good grades the entire term and suddenly a health issue is causing them to fail, a passing grade to keep them floating until the health issue is resolved is not going to ruin the sanctity of academia.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the exactly the type of person who should be in the profession. Take your garbage sentiment to /r/teachers with the rest of the bottom of the barrel losers who shoe-horned themselves into a career they hate.</p>

<p>God forbid we help those in need of a little push. As another commenter said, being held back a year surely won&rsquo;t help depression, and this little act of <em>decent humanity</em> may very well be the little push someone struggling needs to get well.</p>

It&rsquo;s a mark of your achievement ,unless some pathetic weak spined teacher starts handing out good marks for teenagers feeling depressed, which is about half of them.</p>

<p>If you have serious mental health problems then you should have extra opportunities and assistance to get the grades fairly. This is squarely not fair on anybody who has actually tried and succeeded through their own hard work.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually pathetic that there are people who push back against the idea of rewarding hard work. Having depression doesn&rsquo;t entitle you to have the world bend over backwards for you, the world outside doesn&rsquo;t give a shit if you&rsquo;re depressed and part of having that condition is learning to navigate that reality.</p>

<p>If the fact that the teacher noticed this student needed some attention, i&rsquo;m guessing it was bad enough to be considered clinical depression.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not OP&rsquo;s fault you guys use the term &ldquo;depressed&rdquo; in the wrong context, to the point you don&rsquo;t know what it actually means. It&rsquo;s a pretty serious condition that tends to snowball if not intervened, and holding a person accountable for being ill, without willingness to help them does nothing but push them further over the edge.</p>

<p>Oh, i&rsquo;m sure changing a few bits in a digital system was million dollar expense. Better to push this kid further into depression so they will be dependent on psychiatric care for the rest of their life. That surely will cost society less in the long run, no?</p>

<p>I would have been absolutely mortified if my teachers started handing me good grades on the merit of a mental health condition though.

<p>It&rsquo;s not about handing out good grades, it&rsquo;s about preventing a possible catastrophic event, for the sake of the depression. They could repeat year, and get all the stigma and shame that comes with that, on top of their depression. Or their teacher could give them their one chance to turn things around, and a hefty motivation to get better, all the while costing society absolutely nothing. It would cost society more to hold them back.</p>

<p>And since you seem to argue for the moral good, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter to you how it actually will benefit them, and society in the long run, and that you&rsquo;re just on some sort of vindicative witch hunt.</p>

<p>Btw, i come from Norway, a nation where we take care of those struggling. And believe me, giving people a platform to stand on, when they&rsquo;ve lost their own really does work. America should start to realize that, if it&rsquo;s not too late for you guys. Cheers! ü§ô</p>

<p>I can probably speak for a LOT of mentally ill people when I say that this type of empathic teachers have saved lives. Like, actually saved people from death.</p>

<p>I fought so hard to keep up in school. Every day was hell for years. My locker was an explosion of papers on the floor, as I was too stressed to even put them into folders. When I dropped out my mom bawled as she emptied my locker, cause she finally understood the mess inside my head. On a rare occasion I would meet a teacher who saw how much I was struggling, and proceeded to change an F to an E or allow me to skip an assignment, just so that I could breathe.</p>

<p>The other students had so much time and energy that they‚Äôd go out to party and hang out with friends. I had hot flashes and trembled every night in bed because of how nervous I was about school the next day.
 I promise you, I worked twice as hard to get through school, I deserved the few ‚Äúfree‚Äù grades that were handed to me.
Those rare acts of kindness saved me from YEARS of extra studying, if I had failed I would have had to redo my entire education. Today I am healthy and am finally about to graduate on top of my class. I see a future now. If I was still stuck at high school levels at age 22 I promise you I wouldn‚Äôt been here today.</p>

<p>Sometimes you gotta go what‚Äôs right morally, instead of following the rules.</p>

<p>Truly repugnant you&rsquo;d want to limit the opportunities of a child over worthless high school classes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it isn&rsquo;t earned then it isn&rsquo;t earned, life gets harder after school, letting kids slip through is just setting them up for failure in the long run.</p>

<p>Ultimately, i think that people should be successful based on their merits and I balk against all instances when that isn&rsquo;t the case (such as nepotism, teachers faking grades, whatever). Believing that success ought to be based on merit is not a niche opinion so:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No one, and I mean no one cares</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is categorically <strong>not</strong> true. Lots of people care and if I was a student who grafted my way to being successful and someone next to me who failed the class achieved the same grade as me because the teacher felt sorry for them, I&rsquo;d feel pretty betrayed and cheated.</p>

<p>The only one limiting the opportunities of a child is the one who is pushing them through when they are not capable or prepared to be.  LIfe only gets harder when academic demands are based on competencies you never gained in prior grades.</p>

My psychology teacher told me this, then winked at me and told me he couldn‚Äôt hold me back just because he misplaced my book when I gave it back to him.

I still remember how happy I was knowing I got 81% but after knowing I was about to be held back because of the one exam that I didnt know anything about, I talked to my principal to do something about it, who told us there was nothing she could do and all the grades had been made official. The news reached my teacher who taught us that language &amp; on the next day my parents get a call that I had passed because my teacher corrected a mistake that she made while grading. I didnt know back then but after I passed high school &amp; a change in educational surrounding, I figured out what happened and even tho she left before I passed high school, I am still grateful to her.</p>

      <label for="l6gpqsa" class="commentText"><p>I was going through bad depression in middle school due to my parents being in a custody battle. I was stuck at my moms and I wanted to be at my dads, and my mom was making home life hell.</p>

<p>I was skipping school, not doing class work. Halfway through 8th grade I got to go live with my dad.</p>

<p>I had to take ‚Äòsummer school‚Äô to get into high school and not fail 8th grade.</p>

<p>Life was better but I wasn‚Äôt exactly settled in yet, new school, new people, struggling to fit in.</p>

<p>My history teacher made me give him my book bag one day. I had just been stuffing assignments in it loosely, he went through and found anything from his class, and gave me a grade for it, and I passed.</p>

<p>After that I found my groove and my grades improved, I managed to do well enough to keep a B average for the rest of high school.</p>

<p>Sometimes teachers know. Sometimes kids need help.</p>

      <label for="l6h8rl3" class="commentText"><p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of good teachers out there that are insanely under-appreciated. They do an incredibly important job (more than just imparting knowledge) and get very poorly I feel.</p>

<p>Yes, I know there&rsquo;s a lot of bad teachers out there but there&rsquo;s plenty of gems too.</p>

Two of my professors who knew me well emailed me and helped me not fail the classes. I got a D in one and a C in the other and I fully deserved an F in both. But it saved my ass and I will be forever grateful for them for being such good people. I retook the D class and ended up getting an A the following year.</p>

      <label for="l6gw239" class="commentText"><p>In 11th grade, I got a D in AP U.S. History on the 3rd quarter because I never studied or did the assigned readings before class. I had Bs in the first 2 quarters. (For every other class in school I have always gotten good grades without doing homework because I have an excellent memory, and can recall everything a teacher says or writes in the board.)</p>

<p>I worked my tail off to study and prepare in the 4th quarter. The teacher called me up to show me my final grade for the quarter, and I noticed and pointed out a math error. I should have scored 89.2% (a B), but he wrote 89.5% (an A). He looked me straight in the eye and said he didn&rsquo;t make a mistake. I thanked him and sat back down. That &ldquo;non-mistake&rdquo; meant I got a B for the semester instead of a C, and a B for the year. It saved my GPA. (I ended up getting a 5 on the AP, too.)</p>

      <label for="l6gxjvm" class="commentText"><p>I struggled with early algebra. So bad I was basically 2 years behind. Knowing what I know now as an adult about how to teach kids and how much patience is required. My 9th grade math teacher was not qualified to be a teacher. She had no patience if you did not pick things up immediately and only ever gave the time of day to students who were excelling. Long story short I was still picking up bits and pieces as I went but I always struggled.</p>

<p>Fast forward to my 11th grade year. I fucking love physics. But with a weak math background it was not great.</p>

<p>Another long story short my physics teacher Mr. Tesla, yes that was his name. Played world of warcraft and we clicked really well talking about it outside of class. Another long story short. He found out I love physics and was good at highschool level concepts but the actual math and calculations behind them I was not great with.</p>

<p>One hour.</p>

<p>One fucking hour with a teacher that game a shit and it all suddenly clicked. 2 and a half years of hair ripping frustration and all I needed was some individualized attention from a teacher who cared.</p>

<p>He had me do a few practice problems from different grade levels and he just walked me though them, He gave me a few corrections and suddenly I was able to do them. The grade 9 and 10 problems no issues. A bit of help on the grade 11 questions. Turns out I knew most of what to do I just had a few things out of whack.</p>

<p>With a little help. Bam. I was now able to do 11th grade algebra. All the things that I just needed some clarification on. Took about an hour to go over.</p>

      <label for="l6h1xgz" class="commentText"><p>Learning about school systems where you can be kept back a year is fascinating, as someone from a country where it doesn&rsquo;t happen, but instead uses a &ldquo;Skill level&rdquo; approach.</p>

<p>Usually from Secondary school onwards, (Not Primary) where pupils in the same year group, Years 7 to 11, are subdivided on the basis of ability. Lower achieving students are taught in different classes, and at a different rate, often with extra help provided. For example, Set 1 would ve highest achieving pupils, while Set 5 would be the lowest achieving, with the 3 between being intermediate. (I was often set 3) Preventing the need for them to be kept back, and remain with pupils their own age. There also the fact the grading system isn&rsquo;t as harsh (50% is still a passing grade for example)</p>

<p>The system, like any isn&rsquo;t flawless of course, and there are cases where some pupils <em>are</em> set back, but there are also cases where pupils are set <em>forward</em> if they&rsquo;re higher than set 1. Both are rare though.</p>

<p>The idea of being set back is such an alien concept to me.</p>

      <label for="l6g0b4s" class="commentText"><p>As a teacher, I can confirm that I spend hours, if not days, trying to determine if retaining a student will be good for them in the long run.   After much reflection, I usually decide that ain‚Äôt nobody got time for that shit and send them along.    (Edit so I don‚Äôt have to repeat the same argument over and over.)  1. It was a comment made factiously.   2.  In regard to people decrying moving a student forward instead of retaining them.   Recent studies have investigated retention in the context of state and district policies to require students to achieve a certain score for promotion. For example, Roderick and Nagaoka (2005) studied the effects of the Chicago Public Schools policy that bases promotion in grades 3, 6, and 8 on standardized test scores.   Using comparison groups of students who just missed the promotion cutoff, these researchers found that 3rd graders struggled during the repeated year, had higher rates of special education placement, and two years later showed no advantage over those who had been promoted.   Retained 6th graders had lower achievement growth than similar students who were not retained.  Retention can increase the likelihood that a student will drop out of school. Students who drop out are five times more likely to have been retained than those who graduate (National Center for Education Statistics, 2006). Using data from Chicago, Jacob and Lefgren (2007) concluded that students retained in 8th grade were more likely to drop out than their peers, a finding that was not true for retained 6th graders. They speculated that the 6th graders had more opportunities to catch up.   Studies with the strongest research methods compare students who were retained with similar students who were not retained. They ask whether repeating a grade makes a difference in achievement as well as personal and social adjustment over the short run and the long run.   Although individual studies can be cited to support any conclusion, overall the preponderance of evidence argues that students who repeat a grade are no better off, and are sometimes worse off, than if they had been promoted with their classmates.</p>

<p>In the few cases where I did this, I had (imo) valid reasons, put in a lot of consideration, wasn&rsquo;t hurting anyone else but did it for the &ldquo;greater common sense good&rdquo; which was mostly obvious to all parties/people involved (most cases were discussed and in accordance with other teachers).</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see how such acts (obviously not happening on a weekly basis but made form time to time with careful judgement and considering many factors) is making the school experience significantly worse for others though &ndash; do you mean because it devalues their good marks?</p>

<p>Copying wasn&rsquo;t necessary in my classes since I never gave homework &ndash; if you mean cheating during tests, I tried to prevent that from happening for fairness reasons, even though I have my doubts about the whole testing in general.</p>

This means the teachers are going to need to spend more time on that student, relative to the other students, than they otherwise would have, depriving the other students of the possible one on one time that they would have gotten.</p>

<p>Either that, or the problem just gets pushed down the road another year, and so on. Nobody wins when students are forced through. There&rsquo;s a reason &ldquo;no child left behind&rdquo; is largely considered a failure.</p>

      <label for="l6h9xqu" class="commentText"><p>I absolutely agree, that is not the way to go.</p>

<p>I think my post lacked nuance and now creates confusion &ndash; I taught at vocational school level which is different than primary or secondary for many reasons, and I also taught a subject that was not really relevant for their final qualification.</p>

<p>Moreover, I&rsquo;m talking less than a dozen cases in 10 years, carefully considered, never a huge absolute difference in marks and the whole thing not hurting anyone else since my subject did not matter much.</p>

<p>For further clarity: People in vocational school would in 99.9% of the cases anyway pass to the next year even with horrendous marks, as employers are not interested in keeping them longer than the given amount of years in an apprenticeship. Marks therefore had a mostly moral quality except for the few modules that were relevant for passing the final test (which was not the case with my subject).</p>

<p>Absolutely. I was a result of the failed attempts at creating gifted programs. Classes never received adequate funding for those, so I was just pushed to higher courses and treated like an oddity. As a side-effect, I was rescheduled and sat through classes with students like the ones you passed so that my classes in higher grade levels would work with my school schedules at the current level.</p>

<p>Do you mean because it devalues their good marks?</p>

<p>How insulting.</p>

<p>It made my life a hellish few years of suffering through constant interuptions and outbursts and being picked on and missing out on lots of class instruction due to having to sit in with the rough cases that were meant to fail but not permitted to. I was taken away from my own social circle and put in with one or two others like me in a class stacked with the &ldquo;bad kids.&rdquo; I went home daily in tears that I wasn&rsquo;t even able to get through lessons in classes because the teacher would spend it yelling and losing her focus with these rejects. And the teachers grew so fed up with these students they retired shortly after, so their teaching quality was pretty well reduced as they packed up to get out during those years. All I wanted was to get through the day with normal students who didn&rsquo;t behave like they had a mental disability. Tough luck for me.</p>

<p>My life would <em>directly</em> have been better without teachers who were so &ldquo;kind&rdquo; in giving those assholes chance after chance.</p>

<p>But do feel comforted that you made life easier for someone who made it worse for others. Never a regret! :)</p>

<p>Well u/miss_review, go on and answer me, coward. Understand how it could impact others now? Think it&rsquo;s me &ldquo;being jealous of grades not being recognized&rdquo;? Think I&rsquo;m just cruel or mean-spirited? You can look in a mirror for the cause of that.</p>

      <label for="l6h8d4m" class="commentText"><p>That sounds terrible. Once again, I&rsquo;m sorry that you had such a shitty experience. The school system fails almost everyone in different ways, that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why I quit that job.</p>

<p>I think we&rsquo;re talking about different things, though. I taught vocational school, so my students were 16-20 years old, most of them motivated and strong  when I taught in IT (app developers, system technicians etc.) When I taught at retail school, it was the opposite, students were not motivated and not good at school because they often had had a traumatic childhood and came from poor families, many of them also refugees.</p>

<p>As a disclaimer: I handed out &ldquo;better&rdquo; marks less than a dozen times in 10 years of teaching, just to put it in perspective.</p>

<p>In IT, I e.g. handed out a &ldquo;better&rdquo; mark for a student who was depressed (but great in his subject nonetheless) so he missed many classes &ndash; I wouldn&rsquo;t let him fail for that, because I saw he was still smart and capable and suffering from sth unrelated. That was my reasoning, and his classmates were happy for him, as they realized marks are not a zero-sum-game and some things are more important than numbers. This student was a kind, intelligent and very polite person who never harassed anyone in class.</p>

<p>In retail, we would sometimes mildly elevate final marks so students who were close to failing could still pass their apprenticeship because it&rsquo;s of no use if they have to stay for one more year because their argumentative skills or their math skills were not top notch when all they did in reality was stacking shelves and work at the checkout (a 3 years apprenticeship being quite over the top for a shop assistant anyway tbh). Many of were refugees who just wanted to work and needed the money and were excellent at their day-to-day jobs as well as socially, just not intellectually (which shouldn&rsquo;t matter that much for shop assistants really). We never let people pass who were far from having sufficient marks, that was obviously not possible even if we would have wanted to &ndash; I&rsquo;m talking of small margins, where you can sway both ways.</p>

<p>Last but not least, it has been proven many times that marks are highly subjective and extremely arbitrary (this was openly acknowledged by everyone in my teacher training including professors) &ndash; it&rsquo;d be best to just abandon that whole idea completely. It&rsquo;s just hurtful for everyone involved.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really trying to explain myself here in a constructive way, I hope that came across. I don&rsquo;t think what I did has much to do with your experience, which I&rsquo;m sorry for.</p>

      <label for="l6hao0z" class="commentText"><p>Oh no. You don&rsquo;t get to suddenly backtrack and go &ldquo;oh but I meant an entirely different kind of schooling and circumstance&rdquo; after the shit you typed in the prior comment.</p>

<p>Especially that shitty implication that I was just being bothered because I was somehow jealous of my grades meaning less if they passed or whatever character jab that was meant to be. Such arrogance and assumption about what happened in my life. Everything stayed difficult for me and I made it work. I could care less about the idiots teachers passed if they had just stayed out of my way. I escaped them in college when they finally failed out.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t care if it was vocational school that you meant. Life doesn&rsquo;t magically get easier for everyone who who has to employ or work with those students when they are passed through without proper performance. And what you describe in your other comment is a school where even &ldquo;horrendous&rdquo; marks are passed.</p>

<p>Soak up your upvotes in your undeleted comments. I hope they make you feel good.</p>
