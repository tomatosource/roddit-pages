      <label for="l6g03va" class="commentText"><p>I had my German 2 teacher exempt me from my final exams and gave me an A after the assistant principal force me to back out of going to Germany because i was ‚Äúto sad and would ruin the trip for other students‚Äù  so 5000 saved up for nothing.  She felt so bad and bitched out the assistant principal and wanted to help me come to Germany but the damage was already done. I lost my passion to learn German since i didn‚Äôt have a goal and hearing that i was just going to ruin the trip hurt. So my teacher help me and i panic knowing i was going to fail l.  I love my German teacher&hellip;she was the best person i ever had  Edit: a update cus i didn‚Äôt expect people to like my story hah. I‚Äôm actually relearning German after 2 years so i can go with my own group. I want to explore a new place and i think it will be good for me since I‚Äôve been in a bad depressive rut the last 4 years. Also hopefully it will help me feel better and maybe help me with some trauma with my abusive dad.   I have also had a Spanish teacher in an old high school i went for in freshman year who hated my guts and would get me in trouble for anything. She wrote me up for ISS(in school suspension) for drawing on my homework. It was awful so having my two German teachers who were like 2 parents to me was amazing.</p>

<p>And not to mention how fucked up it is that you call a depressed kid a future drug dealer. Just because it was true for you, doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s the norm.</p>

      <label for="l6gywgb" class="commentText"><p>Depression is a medical disorder, that affects a person motivation to do even the simplest of tasks. You should be careful attributing and identifying a person by a highly treatable illness, that very much affects how they perform, but doesn&rsquo;t at all reflect their true personality.</p>

<p>OP could very likely get better, and you have no idea why they&rsquo;re depressed. They could have a bad home, they could have lost someone close that was essential to their well-being.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So it seems you know OP&rsquo;s personally, and know their history? If not, how are you able to speak on how they&rsquo;ve &ldquo;been all their life&rdquo;. I suggest you leave conversations about this topic to people that know what they&rsquo;re talking about, and make an effort to not judge people&rsquo;s entire personality off of a meme.</p>

Those other students gained the reward of knowledge, and experience, while the teacher gave a struggling(not as in stupid, but as in treatable mental illness) a break.</p>

<p>God forbid we help those in need of a little push. As another commenter said, being held back a year surely won&rsquo;t help depression, and this little act of <em>decent humanity</em> may very well be the little push someone struggling needs to get well.</p>

      <label for="l6h27ox" class="commentText"><p>Hard work is a major component to being successful, in the context of education, yes, getting good grades ought to be rewarding. It&rsquo;s a mark of your achievement ,unless some pathetic weak spined teacher starts handing out good marks for teenagers feeling depressed, which is about half of them.</p>

<p>If you have serious mental health problems then you should have extra opportunities and assistance to get the grades fairly. This is squarely not fair on anybody who has actually tried and succeeded through their own hard work.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually pathetic that there are people who push back against the idea of rewarding hard work. Having depression doesn&rsquo;t entitle you to have the world bend over backwards for you, the world outside doesn&rsquo;t give a shit if you&rsquo;re depressed and part of having that condition is learning to navigate that reality.</p>

<p>If it isn&rsquo;t earned then it isn&rsquo;t earned, life gets harder after school, letting kids slip through is just setting them up for failure in the long run.</p>

<p>Ultimately, i think that people should be successful based on their merits and I balk against all instances when that isn&rsquo;t the case (such as nepotism, teachers faking grades, whatever). Believing that success ought to be based on merit is not a niche opinion so:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No one, and I mean no one cares</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is categorically <strong>not</strong> true. Lots of people care and if I was a student who grafted my way to being successful and someone next to me who failed the class achieved the same grade as me because the teacher felt sorry for them, I&rsquo;d feel pretty betrayed and cheated.</p>

<p>The only one limiting the opportunities of a child is the one who is pushing them through when they are not capable or prepared to be.  LIfe only gets harder when academic demands are based on competencies you never gained in prior grades.</p>

My psychology teacher told me this, then winked at me and told me he couldn‚Äôt hold me back just because he misplaced my book when I gave it back to him.

I still remember how happy I was knowing I got 81% but after knowing I was about to be held back because of the one exam that I didnt know anything about, I talked to my principal to do something about it, who told us there was nothing she could do and all the grades had been made official. The news reached my teacher who taught us that language &amp; on the next day my parents get a call that I had passed because my teacher corrected a mistake that she made while grading. I didnt know back then but after I passed high school &amp; a change in educational surrounding, I figured out what happened and even tho she left before I passed high school, I am still grateful to her.</p>

<p>I had to take ‚Äòsummer school‚Äô to get into high school and not fail 8th grade.</p>

<p>Life was better but I wasn‚Äôt exactly settled in yet, new school, new people, struggling to fit in.</p>

<p>My history teacher made me give him my book bag one day. I had just been stuffing assignments in it loosely, he went through and found anything from his class, and gave me a grade for it, and I passed.</p>

<p>After that I found my groove and my grades improved, I managed to do well enough to keep a B average for the rest of high school.</p>

Mental illness should be treated before you focus on anything else, and getting set back because of it has a tendency to snowball. It&rsquo;s part of the reason why mental illness is so hard to fix, because every little thing it ruins in your life just makes it worse.</p>

<p>I worked my tail off to study and prepare in the 4th quarter. The teacher called me up to show me my final grade for the quarter, and I noticed and pointed out a math error. I should have scored 89.2% (a B), but he wrote 89.5% (an A). He looked me straight in the eye and said he didn&rsquo;t make a mistake. I thanked him and sat back down. That &ldquo;non-mistake&rdquo; meant I got a B for the semester instead of a C, and a B for the year. It saved my GPA. (I ended up getting a 5 on the AP, too.)</p>

      <label for="l6gxjvm" class="commentText"><p>I struggled with early algebra. So bad I was basically 2 years behind. Knowing what I know now as an adult about how to teach kids and how much patience is required. My 9th grade math teacher was not qualified to be a teacher. She had no patience if you did not pick things up immediately and only ever gave the time of day to students who were excelling. Long story short I was still picking up bits and pieces as I went but I always struggled.</p>

<p>Fast forward to my 11th grade year. I fucking love physics. But with a weak math background it was not great.</p>

<p>Another long story short my physics teacher Mr. Tesla, yes that was his name. Played world of warcraft and we clicked really well talking about it outside of class. Another long story short. He found out I love physics and was good at highschool level concepts but the actual math and calculations behind them I was not great with.</p>

<p>One hour.</p>

<p>One fucking hour with a teacher that game a shit and it all suddenly clicked. 2 and a half years of hair ripping frustration and all I needed was some individualized attention from a teacher who cared.</p>

<p>He had me do a few practice problems from different grade levels and he just walked me though them, He gave me a few corrections and suddenly I was able to do them. The grade 9 and 10 problems no issues. A bit of help on the grade 11 questions. Turns out I knew most of what to do I just had a few things out of whack.</p>

<p>With a little help. Bam. I was now able to do 11th grade algebra. All the things that I just needed some clarification on. Took about an hour to go over.</p>

The population is getting dumber and the bar lowered for everything and stuff like this is a reason why.

      <label for="l6g0b4s" class="commentText"><p>As a teacher, I can confirm that I spend hours, if not days, trying to determine if retaining a student will be good for them in the long run.   After much reflection, I usually decide that ain‚Äôt nobody got time for that shit and send them along.    (Edit so I don‚Äôt have to repeat the same argument over and over.)  1. It was a comment made factiously.   2.  In regard to people decrying moving a student forward instead of retaining them.   Recent studies have investigated retention in the context of state and district policies to require students to achieve a certain score for promotion. For example, Roderick and Nagaoka (2005) studied the effects of the Chicago Public Schools policy that bases promotion in grades 3, 6, and 8 on standardized test scores.   Using comparison groups of students who just missed the promotion cutoff, these researchers found that 3rd graders struggled during the repeated year, had higher rates of special education placement, and two years later showed no advantage over those who had been promoted.   Retained 6th graders had lower achievement growth than similar students who were not retained.  Retention can increase the likelihood that a student will drop out of school. Students who drop out are five times more likely to have been retained than those who graduate (National Center for Education Statistics, 2006). Using data from Chicago, Jacob and Lefgren (2007) concluded that students retained in 8th grade were more likely to drop out than their peers, a finding that was not true for retained 6th graders. They speculated that the 6th graders had more opportunities to catch up.   Studies with the strongest research methods compare students who were retained with similar students who were not retained. They ask whether repeating a grade makes a difference in achievement as well as personal and social adjustment over the short run and the long run.   Although individual studies can be cited to support any conclusion, overall the preponderance of evidence argues that students who repeat a grade are no better off, and are sometimes worse off, than if they had been promoted with their classmates.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see how such acts (obviously not happening on a weekly basis but made form time to time with careful judgement and considering many factors) is making the school experience significantly worse for others though &ndash; do you mean because it devalues their good marks?</p>

<p>Also, for what collective are you speaking? The high-achievers?</p>

<p>Copying wasn&rsquo;t necessary in my classes since I never gave homework &ndash; if you mean cheating during tests, I tried to prevent that from happening for fairness reasons, even though I have my doubts about the whole testing in general.</p>

<p>Absolutely. I was a result of the failed attempts at creating gifted programs. Classes never received adequate funding for those, so I was just pushed to higher courses and treated like an oddity. As a side-effect, I was rescheduled and passed through classes with students like the ones you passed so that my classes in higher grade levels would work with my school schedules at the current level.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>How insulting.</p>

<p>It made my life a hellish few years of suffering through constant interuptions and outbursts and being picked on and missing out on lots of class instruction due to having to sit in with the rough cases that were meant to fail but not permitted to. I was taken away from my own social circle and put in with one or two others like me in a class stacked with the &ldquo;bad kids.&rdquo; I went home daily in tears that I wasn&rsquo;t even able to get through lessons in classes because the teacher would spend it yelling and losing her focus with these rejects. And the teachers grew so fed up with these students they retired shortly after, so their teaching quality was pretty well reduced as they packed up to get out during those years.</p>

<p>My life would <em>directly</em> have been better without teachers who were so &ldquo;kind&rdquo; in giving those assholes chance after chance.</p>

<p>But do feel comforted that you made life easier for someone who made it worse for others. Never a regret! :)</p>

      <label for="l6gwkgh" class="commentText"><p>If a student didn&rsquo;t grasp the previous year&rsquo;s materials good enough to pass, then they&rsquo;re going to need even more attention the next year. This means the teachers are going to need to spend more time on that student, relative to the other students, than they otherwise would have, depriving the other students of the possible one on one time that they would have gotten.</p>

<p>Either that, or the problem just gets pushed down the road another year, and so on. Nobody wins when students are forced through. There&rsquo;s a reason &ldquo;no child left behind&rdquo; is largely considered a failure.</p>
