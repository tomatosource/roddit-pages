<p>Of course, the nature of the play-in&rsquo;s sudden-death format means that even a 7-seed could fall out of the playoffs through injury or miraculous 3pt shooting, but it&rsquo;s unlikely, and I think it much more likely that the current top 8 stay the top 8.</p>

<p>Purely considering these bottom 7 teams, they have stayed bad or become worse. The Bulls lost DeRozan, Atlanta lost Dejounte Murray, Brooklyn lost Mikal Bridges, Toronto lost both Anunoby and Siakam and the last three teams are so poorly run I doubt any of them crack 30 wins.</p>

<p>Considering the East playoffs teams of last year, the Celtics will likely stay atop the East standings due to their stacked roster, the Knicks loom dangerously with the addition of aforementioned Mikal Bridges, and the 76ers have acquired the third star that Tobias Harris was supposed to be in Paul George. The young teams of Orlando, Indiana and Cleveland will only improve, and the Bucks and the Heat, while starting to get long in the tooth, have good enough teams to get to a positive record, even with the potential decline of Lillard and Butler.</p>

<p>My question really is: Who of these 8 teams going to fall off a cliff hard enough to be worse than the Raptors or the Hawks?</p>

      <label for="lldmw2f" class="commentText"><p>Spurs had damn near the worst record in the NBA any no real pieces to put around Wemby when they tanked for him. Then in his rookie season they were clearly still in the tank and didn&rsquo;t give Wemby any good supporting pieces.  The Hawks on the other hand were fighting for a play in stop last season and we&rsquo;re only that low to begin with because theyre franchise All-NBA/all star had an injury and missed the most games of his career.  Not exactly a 1-1 comparison.  The Hawks are going to be better next year, even without Risarcher, but add in the #1 pick and they&rsquo;ll probably leap frog a team or 2.</p>

<p>I also don’t know if I’d say the roster has gotten worse really. They lost Caleb Martin sure and that will hurt but that’s really it.</p>

<p>Tbh Terry rozier is like 2023 playoff gabe Vincent but season round. Herro and Duncan robinson are still there. Haywood highsmith is their 3 and D guy. Nikola jovic will develop a little more. He’s already a capable stretch 4 on offense. You got bam anchoring the defense.</p>

Rozier never got a chance to get going with that weird neck / nerve issue (which is still a concern), Jimmy missed 22 games, Josh Richardson and Herro played 43 and 42 games, respectively, Jovic 46, Robinson was in and out with a back issue all season…Bam missed 11 games.</p>

<p>And the roster is definitely upgraded, Ware, Larsson, and Keshad Johnson all look like they’re going to contribute as rookies.</p>

<p>The o/u aren’t perfect but they’re usually a pretty good barometer and I can’t remember a year where there was such a big drop between the top 8 and the rest in the East.</p>

<p>On a side note, it’s interesting too that only 2 of the bottom 8 teams are in the West (Blazers, Jazz).</p>

      <label for="llbzk7r" class="commentText"><p>We&rsquo;d have to have a dream scenario in terms of injury luck. Like Mark Williams and LaMelo would have to play 75+ games. We have a pretty terrible backup C situation. Nick Richards is horrendous unless the opposing team straight up doesn&rsquo;t have a center. We are likely not getting much out of our rookie this year. I&rsquo;m having a hard time putting us over Atlanta unless we are 100% healthy all year.</p>

<p>But I think the 10 seed is in play pending how bad the other 5 bottom tier Eastern teams are (Toronto, Chicago, Brooklyn, Washington, Detroit). But that 10 seed is going to be a 30-35 win team.</p>

      <label for="llcnqet" class="commentText"><p>The good: he is a nice offensive rebounder (if he holds onto the ball), and finishes a good amount rebound putbacks and alleyoops, runs the floor pretty well and gets off his feet quickly. Will sometimes drop a <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> on a really bad defensive opponent by running faster and jumping higher.</p>

<p>The bad: terribly jumpy on defense so constantly out of position, and severely lacking in IQ. Terrible hands and fumbles rebounds and passes, has no idea where he&rsquo;s supposed to be on offense and actively blocks driving lanes for his teammates. Doesn&rsquo;t screen well enough.</p>

<p>Basically, he&rsquo;s your typical project seven foot big man that you might get excited for if he was 20&hellip; but he&rsquo;s 26 going on 27 in November. Generally I don&rsquo;t mind him on the roster, but he&rsquo;s a third-string caliber C at best. Starting him for most of last season was our #1 issue.</p>

<p>-the hawks could make a push but they’d be not favorites against any of those top 8 teams in a play in game barring injury</p>

<p>-the raptors I also don’t see it unless rj barrett is gonna continue his ridiculous play from when he was traded to Toronto. The rj barrett-scottie Barnes-poetl fit is disgusting if rj resorts back to his old self.</p>

<p>Think the Hawks will have enough wing defense around Trae to make a real push. Their chances are very dependent on how good Jalen Johnson is next season.</p>

<p>RJ&rsquo;s play will be more replicable than you think because the Raptors fundamentally used him differently. He was an on-ball and catch and shoot 2 guard in New York. He&rsquo;s more of an off ball play finisher in Toronto. Not sure if the 3 ball will hold up like that but 36% from deep makes him enough of a threat if he continues to be that good of a slasher/cutter. Scottie becoming a better 3 point shooter raises the Raptors ceiling the highest. They&rsquo;re the least likely team of the 3 I named to make it through the play in.</p>

Our top two players, Trae and Jalen, missed 52 games combined last year, our injury luck was awful. I’m not saying this is likely but I think the hawks could definitely beat the heat in a play in game if it comes to that.</p>

      <label for="ll9r93k" class="commentText"><p>Tbh curry’s injury issues early in his career are overstated. It was one season where he missed the majority and ppl were a little scared cause a pattern had formed and he missed almost a full year. Lamelo has missed basically the entire last 2 seasons, and then only played 51 games his rookie year.</p>

<p>At least he has shown he can play a full season, but his injury concerns are much worse than what curry was dealing with.</p>

IMO they pivoted towards getting the exact pieces that would let them rack up regular season wins. Not having a second star (outside of the small chance Jalen Johnson takes a huge leap) would obviously cap their ceiling to a first round exit, but in terms of just being in the 4th-8th range I can see it.</p>

      <label for="ll9twv6" class="commentText"><p>We are banking on Johnson, but we also really really shored up depth. We only had ~8 real NBA players last year, now we go 14 deep.</p>

<p>Last years hawks we’re playin with 5th lowest games played of any starting unit a people sleeping on how much better they got with Dyson Daniels as a the perfect complement for Trae.</p>

<p>Not to mention, team is still crazy young like, Trae probably going to be their oldest starter at 26… outside JJ if Kobe Bufkin, Onyeka Okongwu, Dyson Daniels, and Vit Kreijci continue their develo mentality momentum from last season as solid, 24y/o or younger role players - they have a chance to get top 6 and surprise a team like Milwaukee or Philly in the first round. I think they match up well against Orlando and everyone forgets they beat Celtics twice in a row without Trae to end last year…</p>

      <label for="ll9us9x" class="commentText"><p>I would say if there is any east team out of last years top 8 to fall out of the playoffs this year that it would be Miami.</p>

<p>And I would say Atlanta is the most likely team to enter the top 8 out of those teams who missed last year.</p>

<p>But that’s it, no way would I favor Atlanta over miami. People really forget way too quick about 2023. It was a freakin finals run by miami lol with almost an identical roster minus Caleb Martin. And it was a legitimately hard path to the finals too. That’s only a year ago so yeah I would be shocked to say the least if miami missed the playoffs while jimmy was relatively healthy for this year.</p>

<p>This Miami roster has a serious resume, they’ve made 2 title runs and are always making the playoffs. They have jimmy butler and bam adebayo. So over the course of the season of course I will take miami over Atlanta.</p>

      <label for="ll9vp2l" class="commentText"><p>IDK I feel like the regular season and the postseason are completely different animals. An old team might be able to get up for big playoff games, but not be able to withstand the grind of getting their old joints and muscles up for 82 games throughout the season night after night. I’d agree the Heat are more dangerous in a playoff series, but I don’t think that necessarily translates into them being likely to have a better regular season record.</p>

<p>Miamis roster isn’t old, it really must be the jimmy butler effect because you and a lot of others are just saying the whole roster is old.</p>

<p>Terry rozier is in the prime of his career.</p>

<p>Tyler herro is just hitting the prime of his career.</p>

<p>Nikola jovic is a young buck.</p>

<p>Bam adebayo is in the prime of his career.</p>

<p>So <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> guys in the heats starting lineup aren’t old.</p>

<p>Then the bench is josh Richardson, Duncan robinson, Jamie Jaquez, Haywood highsmith, Kevin love or ware.</p>

<p>Again not really seeing this old roster.</p>

      <label for="llarsy7" class="commentText"><p>I think it feels “old” to everyone because Miami has been to two Finals in the last 4 years with the Jimmy - Bam - Herro core and an additional ECF on top of that. They’ve all seen so much Miami that they think it just has to be an old team, but writing us off due to “age” just shows they’re tired of seeing us, not an actual look at the team. It’s pretty trendy to want to push Miami out of the picture mentally but you just laid out the truth. And Jimmy isn’t “old” but he’s on the tail end of his prime, the sun is setting. Kevin Love is really the only old guy past his prime on the roster, we are younger than we have ever been in the Butler era with 3 rookies expected to make contributions this year.</p>

      <label for="lla2ee1" class="commentText"><p>The Pistons have been trying to win for years and just picked up Tobias. I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re &ldquo;tanking&rdquo; per se. A healthy Cade year with improvement from Ivey/Thompson could surprise people.</p>

<p>Hawks traded Murray but they were bad with him playing with Trae. There&rsquo;s a world they play better because now there isn&rsquo;t this awkward hierarchy between Trae and Dejounte.</p>

<p>Bulls lost DeRozan but didn&rsquo;t really commit to the tank. They still have Lavine, Vucevic and Lonzo. Might be stupid to even debate health for Lonzo but if he&rsquo;s 90% of who he used to be(massive if) they&rsquo;ll probably walk backwards into some wins. Also the fact they traded for Giddey and not picks speaks volumes to what they wanna be, they want a player who will help them win games or someone they can flip down the line. Expect them to try to win games because they&rsquo;re also just a really stubborn team.</p>

<p>The Hornets just changed their ownership and have 2 of the best young players in the league (Lamelo and Miller). I&rsquo;m not gonna act like I believe in their team but I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll actually be tanking because they&rsquo;ve been bad for a while. The year Lamelo was healthy didn&rsquo;t they make the play-in?</p>

<p>Of the teams we&rsquo;re banking on being in, I could see the Heat taking a step back, they have been for a few years. The 76ers are a bad Embiid injury from underperforming. I don&rsquo;t entirely believe it but it&rsquo;s in the realm of possibilities. Hasn&rsquo;t Haliburton been worse since getting injured in the middle of last season?</p>

<p>It will for sure be interesting to see who actually misses the playoffs this year. In a strong draft class will teams outside of the obvious(Brooklyn) tank super early this year? I don&rsquo;t think any team in the West will be tanking at the start of the season, Portland will fall into it and San Antonio will be competitive for a few months. In the East though, you have the competitive teams and then the ones that haven&rsquo;t been in a while, aside from the Nets I see every team fighting for the first month or so.</p>

      <label for="llaxixa" class="commentText"><p>Assuming you&rsquo;re talking about the Hornets here, that&rsquo;s exactly what we just did this off-season. Brand new staff from the owners, front office, coaching, all the way down to the medical staff. Obviously it&rsquo;s impossible to know whether the new guys are gonna be competent or not, but we&rsquo;ve finally gone for the total reset that this franchise has needed for almost a decade. And I&rsquo;d be very surprised if it&rsquo;s not better than what we used to have given how low the bar is.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t bet on us making the playoffs because of 1) Lamelo&rsquo;s health and 2) the upcoming draft being so strong which could lead us to tanking in the second half of the season if we&rsquo;re not looking like a surefire playoff team. But if things go right we clearly have the ingredients to make a strong playoff push, though that says as much about the poor state of the eastern conference than it says about us.</p>

      <label for="lle92j0" class="commentText"><p>A lot of that includes time before the Siakam and Anunoby trades. Their win% between those events and the injuries also wasn&rsquo;t good, but they also didn&rsquo;t really have time to develop chemistry and fill into their roles. The current core only has like 20 games played without Siakam taking the #1 spot. ~20 games into the season (give or take, December 5), Orlando had a win% of .700 (ended .573), Bucks .714 (ended .598), and Clippers .474 (ended .621; .639 after Harden trade). It&rsquo;s just not a big enough sample size to use win%</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;re going to be &ldquo;that good&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m hoping they aren&rsquo;t lol), but you don&rsquo;t even need to be .500 to be the 9 seed in the east. They could very easily win 38-40 games and upset the 8 seed in the play-in game to take a spot in the playoffs, which is the whole question to begin with</p>

But we have seen Miami flirt with falling in the play-in, including the year they made the Finals.  They are the most likely to fall, due to that tendency.  But it would be more them dropping the ball than any of those lower teams being good.</p>

Also the Bucks, 76ers, Magic, and Pacers are all 1 major injury away from being a possible 9 seed instead of guaranteed top 8</p>

<p>Toronto, Washington, and Brooklyn are all gonna have some growing pains as they adjust to new visions for their futures</p>

<p>Chicago is everyone&rsquo;s favorite pick to bottom out this season, and for good reason</p>

<p>Atlanta is a bit of a wildcard. Trae and Dejounte were  clunky pairing on offense, but losing him surely weakened their perimeter defense. Jalen Johnson is a great candidate for MIP but has to stay healthy.</p>

<p>So, in short, yeah. I&rsquo;m guessing the top 8 will stay that way, especially since none of them got significantly worse. If anything, they all just got better and or/more experienced</p>

<p>Basically it’s true the 1-8 is already set before the season starts. Obviously not the actual seeding but those 8 teams are locks for playoffs barring major injuries.</p>

<p>I could see him fall off a bit of a cliff. Bam, Herro, Robinson, Rozier, Jamie will be enough to get them into the playoffs along with some random role player turning into a half-star because they&rsquo;re Miami.</p>

<p>You say they are &ldquo;poorly run&rdquo;, but they have new ownership, new GM, new HC, new medical staff, and a new culture. I don&rsquo;t think this is a valid criticism because all the moves that the new regime have made seem extremely positive.</p>

<p>They are super young, and without BMiller but with a healthy LaMelo they made the play-in.  If LaMelo, and maybe even Mark Williams, can stay healthy, I think they will be a better team than the Heat.</p>

<p>There will only be one team winning the NBA championship next season, but there is more than one team <strong>in the running</strong> to do so</p>

      <label for="llbikxk" class="commentText"><p>Good &amp; funny point overall. But not sure why you’ve put the Wizards in the “poorly run” category. The new FO hasn’t put a foot wrong and the goal is absolutely to get top-3 lottery odds, not win games. Mismanagement would be trying to win 30 games.</p>

      <label for="llcn970" class="commentText"><p>How can you read those last two sentences, know what Washington has been through over the past…. decades, and wonder why people think they are poorly run?</p>

<p>They appear to be poorly run based on them being irrelevant for 99% of my lifetime. Ownership might have a plan NOW, but they’re what like 18 months into it?</p>

<p>There is one champion, but multiple teams are <strong>in the running</strong> to be a champion.</p>
