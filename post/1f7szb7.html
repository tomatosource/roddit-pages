<p>Of course, the nature of the play-in&rsquo;s sudden-death format means that even a 7-seed could fall out of the playoffs through injury or miraculous 3pt shooting, but it&rsquo;s unlikely, and I think it much more likely that the current top 8 stay the top 8.</p>

<p>Purely considering these bottom 7 teams, they have stayed bad or become worse. The Bulls lost DeRozan, Atlanta lost Dejounte Murray, Brooklyn lost Mikal Bridges, Toronto lost both Anunoby and Siakam and the last three teams are so poorly run I doubt any of them crack 30 wins.</p>

<p>Considering the East playoffs teams of last year, the Celtics will likely stay atop the East standings due to their stacked roster, the Knicks loom dangerously with the addition of aforementioned Mikal Bridges, and the 76ers have acquired the third star that Tobias Harris was supposed to be in Paul George. The young teams of Orlando, Indiana and Cleveland will only improve, and the Bucks and the Heat, while starting to get long in the tooth, have good enough teams to get to a positive record, even with the potential decline of Lillard and Butler.</p>

<p>My question really is: Who of these 8 teams going to fall off a cliff hard enough to be worse than the Raptors or the Hawks?</p>

But I definitely don’t think it’s likely to happen considering we just saw jimmy butler a year ago take the top teams in the east to school in the playoffs. I do not believe jimmy has really fallen off that badly.</p>

<p>Also whatever he&rsquo;s done in the playoffs in the last few years is pretty irrelevant when we&rsquo;re talking about regular-season seeding, especially since he <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> play like that in the regular season</p>

Rozier never got a chance to get going with that weird neck / nerve issue (which is still a concern), Jimmy missed 22 games, Josh Richardson and Herro played 43 and 42 games, respectively, Jovic 46, Robinson was in and out with a back issue all season…Bam missed 11 games.</p>

<p>And the roster is definitely upgraded, Ware, Larsson, and Keshad Johnson all look like they’re going to contribute as rookies.</p>

<p>I also don’t know if I’d say the roster has gotten worse really. They lost Caleb Martin sure and that will hurt but that’s really it.</p>

<p>Tbh Terry rozier is like 2023 playoff gabe Vincent but season round. Herro and Duncan robinson are still there. Haywood highsmith is their 3 and D guy. Nikola jovic will develop a little more. He’s already a capable stretch 4 on offense. You got bam anchoring the defense.</p>

      <label for="ll9w8sx" class="commentText"><p>The hawks really underperformed last year, and we’ve added depth and defense around Trae instead of trying to force him to share the ball with another skinny point guard. Our top two players, Trae and Jalen, missed 52 games combined last year, our injury luck was awful. I’m not saying this is likely but I think the hawks could definitely beat the heat in a play in game if it comes to that.</p>

      <label for="ll9r93k" class="commentText"><p>Tbh curry’s injury issues early in his career are overstated. It was one season where he missed the majority and ppl were a little scared cause a pattern had formed and he missed almost a full year. Lamelo has missed basically the entire last 2 seasons, and then only played 51 games his rookie year.</p>

<p>At least he has shown he can play a full season, but his injury concerns are much worse than what curry was dealing with.</p>

<p>-the hawks could make a push but they’d be not favorites against any of those top 8 teams in a play in game barring injury</p>

<p>-the raptors I also don’t see it unless rj barrett is gonna continue his ridiculous play from when he was traded to Toronto. The rj barrett-scottie Barnes-poetl fit is disgusting if rj resorts back to his old self.</p>

      <label for="ll9pcf2" class="commentText"><p>For the Hornets, I&rsquo;m not sure what the deal is with LaMelo&rsquo;s ankle but we&rsquo;ll see. If he stays healthy, the Hornets have a legitimate shot at making the playoffs through the play-in.</p>

<p>Think the Hawks will have enough wing defense around Trae to make a real push. Their chances are very dependent on how good Jalen Johnson is next season.</p>

<p>RJ&rsquo;s play will be more replicable than you think because the Raptors fundamentally used him differently. He was an on-ball and catch and shoot 2 guard in New York. He&rsquo;s more of an off ball play finisher in Toronto. Not sure if the 3 ball will hold up like that but 36% from deep makes him enough of a threat if he continues to be that good of a slasher/cutter. Scottie becoming a better 3 point shooter raises the Raptors ceiling the highest. They&rsquo;re the least likely team of the 3 I named to make it through the play in.</p>

They may get lucky and win the play in games but I don’t think the hawks are doing anything past the first round next year. That team is way too devoid of talent.</p>

      <label for="ll9pgr9" class="commentText"><p>I guess I&rsquo;m just higher on their roster&rsquo;s talent + fit + Trae as a player than others. IMO they pivoted towards getting the exact pieces that would let them rack up regular season wins. Not having a second star (outside of the small chance Jalen Johnson takes a huge leap) would obviously cap their ceiling to a first round exit, but in terms of just being in the 4th-8th range I can see it.</p>

      <label for="ll9twv6" class="commentText"><p>We are banking on Johnson, but we also really really shored up depth. We only had ~8 real NBA players last year, now we go 14 deep.</p>

<p>Last years hawks we’re playin with 5th lowest games played of any starting unit a people sleeping on how much better they got with Dyson Daniels as a the perfect complement for Trae.</p>

<p>Not to mention, team is still crazy young like, Trae probably going to be their oldest starter at 26… outside JJ if Kobe Bufkin, Onyeka Okongwu, Dyson Daniels, and Vit Kreijci continue their develo mentality momentum from last season as solid, 24y/o or younger role players - they have a chance to get top 6 and surprise a team like Milwaukee or Philly in the first round. I think they match up well against Orlando and everyone forgets they beat Celtics twice in a row without Trae to end last year…</p>

      <label for="ll9us9x" class="commentText"><p>I would say if there is any east team out of last years top 8 to fall out of the playoffs this year that it would be Miami.</p>

<p>And I would say Atlanta is the most likely team to enter the top 8 out of those teams who missed last year.</p>

<p>But that’s it, no way would I favor Atlanta over miami. People really forget way too quick about 2023. It was a freakin finals run by miami lol with almost an identical roster minus Caleb Martin. And it was a legitimately hard path to the finals too. That’s only a year ago so yeah I would be shocked to say the least if miami missed the playoffs while jimmy was relatively healthy for this year.</p>

<p>This Miami roster has a serious resume, they’ve made 2 title runs and are always making the playoffs. They have jimmy butler and bam adebayo. So over the course of the season of course I will take miami over Atlanta.</p>

      <label for="ll9vp2l" class="commentText"><p>IDK I feel like the regular season and the postseason are completely different animals. An old team might be able to get up for big playoff games, but not be able to withstand the grind of getting their old joints and muscles up for 82 games throughout the season night after night. I’d agree the Heat are more dangerous in a playoff series, but I don’t think that necessarily translates into them being likely to have a better regular season record.</p>

      <label for="ll9wt6q" class="commentText"><p>So I feel like you and a lot of others are just saying jimmy butler is old so the entire Miami team is old which isn’t true at all.</p>

<p>Miamis roster isn’t old, it really must be the jimmy butler effect because you and a lot of others are just saying the whole roster is old.</p>

<p>Terry rozier is in the prime of his career.</p>

<p>Tyler herro is just hitting the prime of his career.</p>

<p>Nikola jovic is a young buck.</p>

<p>Bam adebayo is in the prime of his career.</p>

<p>So <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> guys in the heats starting lineup aren’t old.</p>

<p>Then the bench is josh Richardson, Duncan robinson, Jamie Jaquez, Haywood highsmith, Kevin love or ware.</p>

<p>Again not really seeing this old roster.</p>

      <label for="lla2ee1" class="commentText"><p>The Pistons have been trying to win for years and just picked up Tobias. I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re &ldquo;tanking&rdquo; per se. A healthy Cade year with improvement from Ivey/Thompson could surprise people.</p>

<p>Hawks traded Murray but they were bad with him playing with Trae. There&rsquo;s a world they play better because now there isn&rsquo;t this awkward hierarchy between Trae and Dejounte.</p>

<p>Bulls lost DeRozan but didn&rsquo;t really commit to the tank. They still have Lavine, Vucevic and Lonzo. Might be stupid to even debate health for Lonzo but if he&rsquo;s 90% of who he used to be(massive if) they&rsquo;ll probably walk backwards into some wins. Also the fact they traded for Giddey and not picks speaks volumes to what they wanna be, they want a player who will help them win games or someone they can flip down the line. Expect them to try to win games because they&rsquo;re also just a really stubborn team.</p>

<p>The Hornets just changed their ownership and have 2 of the best young players in the league (Lamelo and Miller). I&rsquo;m not gonna act like I believe in their team but I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll actually be tanking because they&rsquo;ve been bad for a while. The year Lamelo was healthy didn&rsquo;t they make the play-in?</p>

<p>Of the teams we&rsquo;re banking on being in, I could see the Heat taking a step back, they have been for a few years. The 76ers are a bad Embiid injury from underperforming. I don&rsquo;t entirely believe it but it&rsquo;s in the realm of possibilities. Hasn&rsquo;t Haliburton been worse since getting injured in the middle of last season?</p>

<p>It will for sure be interesting to see who actually misses the playoffs this year. In a strong draft class will teams outside of the obvious(Brooklyn) tank super early this year? I don&rsquo;t think any team in the West will be tanking at the start of the season, Portland will fall into it and San Antonio will be competitive for a few months. In the East though, you have the competitive teams and then the ones that haven&rsquo;t been in a while, aside from the Nets I see every team fighting for the first month or so.</p>

<p>Basically it’s true the 1-8 is already set before the season starts. Obviously not the actual seeding but those 8 teams are locks for playoffs barring major injuries.</p>

<p>I could see him fall off a bit of a cliff. Bam, Herro, Robinson, Rozier, Jamie will be enough to get them into the playoffs along with some random role player turning into a half-star because they&rsquo;re Miami.</p>
