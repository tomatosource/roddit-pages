      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1f3ck15/why_are_the_jazz_wanting_to_trade_kessler_when/"><p>Why are the Jazz wanting to trade Kessler when he’s the only good defensive player on that team?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>For one, Jordan Clarkson might be the worst defender in the league. I think the world of Lauri on offense but his defense leads much to be desired. Offensively, He’s a true stretch 4 that shoots 40% from 3 on offense. Pair that with Collins who is a terrible defender as well and you got the worst defense in the league.</p>

<p>What’s the Jazz logic behind trading Kessler?</p>

<p>Edit: I think Jazz should be trying to trade Potter or Filipiwski if anyone. They kinda have a logjam of stretch 4 PFs.</p>

      <label for="lkcomjs" class="commentText"><p>If they want to trade him it&rsquo;s probably because they&rsquo;re not sold on him as a long-term part of their core after his regression this past year and are trying to get rid of him while he still has some value. Because if he has another mediocre year this upcoming year then every GM is just going to think he&rsquo;s not that good.</p>

      <label for="lkevnk1" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not arguing that the hawk should have taken Castle&hellip; But comparing castles shooting Form and jumpshot to the Thompsons is extremely disingenuous. Castle&rsquo;s always been a solid free throw shooter and again the fundamentals of his jumpshot are solid. There&rsquo;s plenty of reason to believe he can become an adequate floor spacer Even if he&rsquo;s never a true dangerous shooter. And it should also be noted. A lot of his poor shooting numbers came after he had a pretty significant early season injury. When he came back he had a rough time. By the end of the year, his shooting all over the floor had risen significantly</p>

<p>The Thompsons? Those kids Have some of the most broken jump shots I&rsquo;ve seen from prospects in a long long time. I think both of them need to literally have their shots completely reworked from scratch. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any little tweaks or mechanical fixes that are going to do it. And neither one has ever been consistent at the foul line, from mid-range, open shots, catch and shoot, on the dribble. Absolutely nothing involving them. Shooting a basketball has shown any sign or potential anywhere in their basketball careers.</p>

<p>Both guys have been very openly working with professional shooting coaches for three seasons at this point.</p>

<p>If Castle doesn&rsquo;t become a better overall jump shooter then both of the Thompsons I will publicly live stream myself eating a shoe lol</p>

<p>I actually think Castle would have been a great complimentary fit next to Young Young for what it&rsquo;s worth.</p>

I&rsquo;ve heard someone describe him as &ldquo;Lamar Ball-esque&rdquo; though both accounts are unverified</p>

<p>Additionally, he had a pretty bad sophomore slump.  In a vacuum he was still an effective rim protector, but he lost the starting lineup spot to John Collins and there wasn&rsquo;t much to note for improvements made in his game.</p>

<p>No one expected the Jazz to move Ochai Agbaji until they did, so it wouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise if they got rid of Walker sooner rather than later.</p>

He kicked the tires on him numerous times for the Celtics but the price was always too high.  And at his best, Collins fits the archetype of an Ainge player - big wing with a 3-ball.</p>

<p>Besides - he actually played quite well for Utah.  He&rsquo;s only 26 and his major crime is being overpaid.  I can totally see the Jazz extending him for a bit more reasonable money.</p>

<p>You also have the fact that the media is probably blowing the Jazz actual interest in moving him out of proportion. Similar to how they did with Lauri, except the Jazz are undoubtedly <em>more</em> open to moving Kessler.</p>

<p>That said Kessler reportedly wants to be a stretch big, but isn’t very good at it. As such he a lot of his time practicing his shooting, to not much improvement, when the coaching staff want him to improve his screening etc. Traditional big man skills.</p>

<p>The lack of traditional PG on the Jazz roster hasn’t helped, and since the Jazz want to play 5 out, they want a more mobile big that can shoot and/or pass rather than a traditional drop and dunk big like Kessler. </p>

      <label for="lkd2p25" class="commentText"><p>John Collins was a really good defender his last year or two in Atlanta, not sure how jazz fans feel about him on that end. As for trading Kessler, they are in tank/accumulate talent phase, they aren&rsquo;t worried about roster construction. Whether they should see Kessler as a long term piece or not is up for debate but they aren&rsquo;t worried about being bad in the short term, in fact thats probably the preference </p>

<p>John Collins is one of the worst defenders in Jazz franchise history.</p>

<p>Okongwu for Kessler straight up</p>

<p>Kessler fits better theoretically with Trae and okongwu makes sense next to Lauri as a switchable versatile defensive anchor 5, Lauri being 7 foot covers for his height deficiency</p>

Just because he&rsquo;s making a player available does not mean he is going to trade him, just as he did with Markannen last summer. He wants to see the offers and what other teams make available. If there&rsquo;s something mutually beneficial, maybe he does it. Maybe he doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Kessler&rsquo;s contract has only two years left. If Kessler has another bad year he&rsquo;s only good as a salary filler in a trade. Jazz can trade him now as he still had some value as a project with proven value as a rim protector for a decent return</p>

      <label for="lkcyql2" class="commentText"><p>Because it’s a terrible team whose GM is only interested in a permanent rebuild. They do nothing to take advantage of his strengths. Yes, everyone knows about his defense.. but he’s also one of the best bigs in league at running the floor and he’s really good at catching lobs.. put him in a more up tempo offense and give him an actual decent PG to get him the ball in those situations. </p>
