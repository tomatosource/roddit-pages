      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1g5zys5/klay_thompson_from_3_last_year_39_41_after_the/"><p>Klay Thompson from 3 last year: 39%, 41% after the all star break || Tim Hardaway Jr from 3 last year: 35%, 32% after the all star break</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>TL;DR- Klay was brought in to replace THJ, not Derrick Jones Jr., and even being washed he provides considerably more value for less money.</p>

<p>This post isn’t to pick on THJ but to add context to why we are optimistic about adding Klay. Regardless of who is actually listed as the starter, people that know the way Kidd coaches understand that Klay was brought in to serve the role that THJ was supposed to provide, but couldn’t because he was so unplayable last year. That being the microwave shooter to alleviate offensive pressure for Luka and Kyrie and space the floor for them. This is an entire aspect of our offense that was just completely missing during our playoff run because of THJ being so horrible.</p>

<p>“He’s not replacing THJ though he’s taking Derrick Jones Jr’s spot”</p>

<p>DJJ minutes per game last season - 23.5</p>

<p>THJ minutes per game last season - 26.8</p>

<p>Naji Marshall was brought in to replace DJJ. There are minutes to go around. Again, who’s listed as a starter in October doesn’t matter all that much in the long run.</p>

<p>We were also paying THJ more than we will be Klay.</p>

      <label for="lsfy7v9" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think it’s gonna even be that difficult. Kyrie will sub out at the 4-6 minute mark of the first and either Naji, Grimes or Exum (when he’s back from injury) will sub in. Most of Klay’s minutes will be with 1 of Luka and Kai, 2 of those wing defenders (and PJ who starts) and one of our centers.</p>

<p>Just because he starts doesn’t mean that group of 5 exclusively plays together.</p>

<p>THJ was <em>supposed</em> to be a main part of the roster. When he played he averaged more minutes than DJJ. It’s just he was really that bad that they had to stop playing him all together.</p>

      <label for="lsfyiky" class="commentText"><p>The Warriors weren’t a good team last year. Whether it was Klay adding that pressure to himself or not, seems like he felt he had to force himself as the second option to help Steph. Draymond being out for a significant part of the season likely did not help either.</p>

<p>If this Mavs team is ever in a position where it feels like Klay needs to be the second option just to make it to the play-in or even just win individual games when we have:</p>

<p>a top 2 player in the world about to enter his prime, Kyrie Irving still giving near all star level production, one of the strongest center rotations in the league, a decent rotation of wings that can put up 15-20 when required, and a backup guard rotation of Hardy, Exum, Grimes, and Dinwiddie all fighting for minutes, etc.</p>

<p>then there would be a long, long list of things going wrong and people to blame before we even got to Klay.</p>

<p>The whole point is that he’s in a position now where he won’t have to be anything more than a glorified spot up shooter. He will be at most the 3rd or 4th, sometimes even 5th option on a night to night basis.</p>

At least he will offer championship experience / mentality which all we had for that was kyrie before, we’re a pretty young team otherwise. I like to think he will be able to hit 38% of his easy ass looks here in like 20-25 mpg though.</p>

      <label for="lsf2e0e" class="commentText"><p>Because that is when THJ became so bad he became unplayable and it’s also when the version of our team that went on the run to the Finals started to form.</p>

<p>Basically we looked that good despite our main floor spacing role-player being <em>abysmal</em> at his job.</p>

<p>So because THJ was basically a net negative player during the stretch of our team being good, basically I’m trying to demonstrate the value of adding a (theoretically) 39-41% shooter on top of that Finals team.</p>

<p>During that run last year we were forced to go all in on DJJ/Defense (which obviously worked out for the most part) but our lack of versatility to have shooting bit us in the ass in the Finals. This year, again, in theory, we can basically switch between both, where it’s either Klay or Naji Marshall.</p>

<p>It’s also to demonstrate that from what Warriors fans have been telling us for months now Klay has always started off super slow even during his absolute prime, so I’m just adding context to the inevitable endless trolling that will happen early on when he’s still getting adjusted to being on a new team.</p>

      <label for="lsf4f9p" class="commentText"><p>here&rsquo;s a stat to maybe keep track of.</p>

<p>last season, in games where Klay took <em>at least</em> 10 3pa (35 games), he shot 43.4%</p>

<p>in games where he attempted 9 or less 3p (42 games), he shot 32.2%.</p>

<p>some of this is self fulfilling; when Klay is hot he shoot more. some of it, however, it about the kind of freedom Klay has had to feel historically to get comfortable as a shooter. if he missed his first two shots or was frustrated over something (which he was most of last year), his shot quality would get progressively worse and there were <strong>a lot</strong> of reasonably high volume inefficient shooting games from him.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s never done the THJ or Kyle Korver role. There&rsquo;ll be some adjustment and his reaction to having a tough night shooting isn&rsquo;t always a good one.</p>

      <label for="lsf51v5" class="commentText"><p>That’s fair honestly.</p>

<p>One thing about THJ is that he didn’t give a single fuck about how he was doing he was letting that shit fly every single fucking time he got the ball.</p>

<p>Maybe one is worse than the other, I really can’t tell. But I think Kidd and Kyrie will be good in terms of support/encouragement. Am a little anxious to see if he gets along with Luka though because ultimately that’s the most important part. Grant being ass and more importantly annoying to Luka got him shipped out to Charlotte hell in the blink of an eye.</p>

<p>i think the ultimate difference between this and Klay last year is minimal. he is prone to needing to &lsquo;shoot himself back into form&rsquo;, which means he can and will hoist 3 or 4 3p shots in a quarter, all of which are ill-advised with tons of time left on the shot clock.</p>

<p>the Mavs are banking on a change of on-court habits and off-court demeanor from Klay. maybe that&rsquo;s a good bet, maybe not, we won&rsquo;t know for a while. but it&rsquo;s not a seamless fit if they get the Klay from last season.</p>

      <label for="lsf7dec" class="commentText"><p>I don’t really know the specifics about the Warriors offense the past year or two but I think also part of it with us is that there is such an obvious hierarchy that this is Luka’s team, to some extent it’s his way or the highway and there’s no way Klay did not know this going into it. Correct me if I’m wrong but with the Warriors I feel like there was a push-and-pull between Klay feeling like he needed force himself to step up as a second option to help alleviate pressure for Steph and live up to his old reputation, while Kerr/coaching staff felt the opposite that he should take a lesser role.</p>

<p>I feel like here there’s literally no reason he should feel any pressure to assert himself as the brunt of the responsibility for everything will be on Luka &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Kyrie &amp;gt; anyone else.</p>

<p><em>In theory</em> all he has to do is wait to get the easiest shots of his life while occasionally running of screens. He shouldn’t even be in the position where he would have opportunities to take bad shots or contested fades or whatever.</p>

<p>But again what do I know</p>

Everyone thought Kyrie would be a huge diva when he came here or leave to go to the Lakers over the summer but he kind of stuck around to prove himself with us and apparently that going well was a big part of the pitch to Klay. We’ll see how that goes.</p>

<p>To be fair I also thought Grant Williams would be a great fit next to Luka and look how that went.</p>

      <label for="lsfjpzx" class="commentText"><p>I guess we’ll cross that bridge we get to it. I know it didn’t go over well in GS but as a Mavs fan you just have to think that he’d understand it’s a much different situation. The media and organization will treat him well but he in no way has any where near close to the amount of good will built in with the Warriors (and I know he was really pushing that towards the end there lol). It’s very obviously Luka’s team so if someone doesn’t like you, or there seems to be locker room/chemistry/on court fit issues they have shown that they will get rid of you very easily.</p>

<p>Apparently Kyrie’s experience about how coming here was sort of a “last chance” for his career or whatever after exploring his options and having to accept a pay cut, and then sort of ending up revitalizing his career, was a huge part of the pitch to Klay.</p>

<p>Whether Klay takes that as “I get to see prove that I’m still 2016 Klay” or “I can reinvent myself as a Heat Ray Allen type of role” remains to be seen.</p>

<p>I know Warriors fans will say it won’t work. But I just have to assume that even Klay is self aware enough to understand that that this is kind of his last run for his career and he can either adapt to contributing to a contender or go off with a whimper somewhere.</p>

      <label for="lsf1cp6" class="commentText"><p>I agree that Klay should be an upgrade from THJ, but THJ should not have been allowed to play big minutes. Even if Klay is better, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that he will be a positive player, it just means he&rsquo;s not as big a negative as THJ was. The good news is that at least Klay is making less than THJ was, though not by that much.</p>

      <label for="lsfeufg" class="commentText"><p>THJ was supposed to be the third scoring option by the team. Kidd envisioned him to be a 6th man of the year candidate when last season started. The Mavs offense generates a ton of open looks and having players who are both willing and able to score those open looks is important.</p>

<p>If THJ shooting was similar to Klay last season he absolutely would have gotten more playing time.</p>

      <label for="lsfi8q1" class="commentText"><p>The point is that he wasn&rsquo;t making shots like that, and his defense was also atrocious. He shouldn&rsquo;t have played so much, Kidd failed there. So, the bar THJ set is not exactly what Mavs fans are hoping for from Klay. For Klay to be a success he needs to be significantly better than THJ, not just a replacement/marginal upgrade.</p>

<p>The overreactions early on will be unbearable though, that’s for certain. Warriors fans have been telling us that he’s always been slow to start even in his prime, and he’s on a completely new team now.</p>

<p>I can honestly see it going either way. If he immediately starts clicking with Luka it can go great off rip but he could also just randomly have gone through a historically horrible fall off out of nowhere. We won’t know until at least a few months into the season.</p>

      <label for="lsfnrm1" class="commentText"><p>frankly i just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll be hard for luka and kyrie to get klay open looks and then get themselves and the rest of the team good looks off his gravity.</p>

<p>all klay has to do is shoot the same way he has his entire career, with no pressure to shoot consistently, because the mavs have multiple other good options on any given point.</p>

<p>there is pretty much no historical precedent for an elite shooter&rsquo;s shot falling off in the way that people think his 0/10 game means his will. he&rsquo;s going to remain an incredible shooter, it&rsquo;s simply not a skill that will go away. if it was, it would&rsquo;ve done so after his knee disappeared.</p>

<p>klay clearly had mental issues last year, imo the only question is whether those will be better in dallas or not. i think we have every reason to believe they&rsquo;ll be better. what dallas is asking from him is simple and something he&rsquo;s happy to give: effort, chill vibes, and shooting.</p>

It would have to be like a historic, actually once in a lifetime generational fall off for someone to go from shooting 41% across 27 games and then IMMEDIATELY, one game later, plummet down to being unplayable. I just don’t think it works like that.</p>

<p>And like you said he pretty much just has to stand there hitting set practice shots. I don’t care how washed a player is, if he’s one of the greatest shooters in the history of the sport he will hit those at a good rate over the course of an 82 game season.</p>

      <label for="lsfrk4s" class="commentText"><p>you&rsquo;re right. and i suppose the mental issues are a real concern, but i think people are trying to manifest them actually carrying over into mavs tenure, out of simple hatred for the guy. there&rsquo;s little reason to believe they&rsquo;ll persist, they had a lot to do with his specific relationship to gsw and the pressure he felt as their historical 2nd-3rd option. he&rsquo;s more like a 3rd-4th option for the mavs and that means he isn&rsquo;t required to produce every night for them to get Ws, just to produce a respectable average ppg and keep hitting his shots at the rate he always has. he knows he can do that, they know he can do that, the vibes should be great for him, especially when kyrie has had a similar renaissance in dallas and is himself an incredible locker room guy to have supporting klay.</p>

<p>but the games will start soon and then we&rsquo;ll know, all of this is just talk. it&rsquo;ll be fine</p>

Like you said Kyrie’s experiences with that were a huge part of that pitch to get Klay and you would have to assume that they talked about this to some extent.</p>

The only possible downside of Klay is that hes harder to bench than THJ because of his name and career, even at his current defensive worst hes still better than THJ but he might not let you play guys like Grimes or Naji more even if they might deserve it.</p>

<p>Maybe it didn’t go well in Golden State because he still felt so much pressure and expectations to be the Splash Bro, with four rings and a dynasty hanging over his head… apparently a huge part of the pitch to Klay was Kyrie explaining how chill and welcoming the environment was and how he was able to kind of reinvent himself here, and Kidd seems to be a coach that players absolutely love. So I would hope that getting him to accept more of a Heat Ray Allen role off the bench would go over a lot smoother with us.</p>

<p>Plus it’s like, so hilariously obvious that this is Luka’s team… and that if he doesn’t like you or you’re causing issues they’re not afraid to get you out of there. Surely Klay knows that going into this.</p>

<p>It doesn’t necessarily matter who starts, the role of “shooting roleplayer to space the floor for Luka and Kyrie” was supposed to be a big part of our rotation, the guy we had in that role was just so bad at it he played that role out of the rotation.</p>

<p>DJJ was “long defensive wing player”.</p>

<p>New shooting roleplayer- Klay</p>

<p>New long defensive wing player- Naji</p>

<p>It’s just a matter of which one Kidd prioritizes. Last year we basically had to go all in on the second. In theory, since we upgraded the first one, it will give him more flexibility to go back and forth.</p>

<p>THJ was worse defensively I can tell you that easily. Nobody that wasn’t watching him night night out like we were understand how bad he was and it seems like nobody else can realize that washed Klay is still significantly better than him.</p>

<p>Just to humor you though he had an 0/8 game and a <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>13</sub> game within the same week last year.</p>

Doesnt it make sense that he replaced the other guy that was only good for shooting and that they just switched the starting lineup to have one come in before the other?</p>

      <label for="lsfpin1" class="commentText"><p>DJJ started, atleast when Dallas was good, THJ didn’t. If Klay is playing starter minutes he’s not replacing a bench players role, he’s replacing the starting SF, which was DJJ.</p>

<p>I understand how Nnaji is most similar to DJJ and Klay is most similar to THJ, but if there minutes don’t reflect that then you can’t say that Klay is replacing Tim.</p>

<p>Unless of course Klay plays off the bench than he would definitely be replacing THJ.</p>

      <label for="lsfql37" class="commentText"><p>Tim literally averaged more MPG than DJJ despite DJJ starting most of the year though.</p>

<p>The role of a shooting roleplayer is supposed to be a huge part of our rotation splitting minutes with DJJ, that only wasn’t the case later on because THJ was so bad at his job.</p>

<p>If Klay is good at that job then it will go eventually balance back out to splitting the 3 spot between the shooting roleplayer and the long defensive wing.</p>

<p>Kidd has a tendency to over experiment and shit so I don’t see any of this solidifying until at least halfway through the season. I don’t see Klay playing lots of minutes either way, I fully expect Naji to be one of our most important players</p>

<p>Basically just imagine our team that made the Finals but with a shooter being able to come in for more versatility when necessary. We didn’t have that option last year. In theory, at least.</p>

<p>This whole &ldquo;Klay is replacing THJ&rdquo; is absurd. No, he is not. Everyone including Klay expects him to play 20+mpg.</p>

      <label for="lsg0pek" class="commentText"><p>Holy fuck you’re literally just ignoring everything I’m saying. THJ was playing heavy minutes, more than DJJ, until he regressed so much (<em>32% from 3 as the damn designated spot up shooter of the team</em>) that he basically had to be banished from the lineup. The role of shooter is still very important to the construction of the team. If THJ had been any better than dogwater, trust me, Kidd would have been playing him 20 minutes.</p>

      <label for="lsfreru" class="commentText"><p>Sure, yea, but Kidd over experiments with this shit anyways. By the tail end of the season I see it balancing out to splitting the 3 position between Klay when we need shooting and Naji when we need more defense no matter which is starting. I just have to hope that Klay has some level of self awareness that he isn’t fighting for his Splash Bros role anymore and that he isn’t really coming in with any pull on a team that is 100% centered around what’s best for Luka</p>
