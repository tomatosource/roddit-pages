      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ffgnyh/opponents_shot_429_at_the_rim_against_dereck/"><p>Opponents shot 42.9% at the rim against Dereck Lively in the playoffs, the lowest percentage on at least half as many attempts since this stat has been recorded</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>As a 20 year old rookie, Dereck Lively put together one of the best defensive playoff performances of the last decade (data goes back to the 13-14 season). Not just as a rim defender, but also as a closeout/switch perimeter defender, as players shot 29.9% from 3 against him</p>

<p>People have a tendency to downplay Lively as a player because of his role and the talent he plays with. The turn &ldquo;got carried by Luka and Kyrie&rdquo; seems to be the common phrase thrown around by those less knowledgeable about the team. As Mavs fans know, it&rsquo;s not an exaggeration to say, without Lively, this finals team wouldn&rsquo;t have even made the playoffs. His impact in the postseason was felt even more, as the team was +98 with his on the floor (5th in the league) and -43 when he was off the floor. Both the defense and offense took a significant leap when he subbed in.</p>

<p>DLive on the floor: 118.9 Ortng  107.4 Drtg</p>

<p>DLive off the floor: 112.4 Ortg  114.9 Drtg</p>

<p>On/off: +14.0</p>

<p>Credit to 4ps22 for bringing the original stat up on r/Mavericks</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s one thing if they actually understand Lively&rsquo;s deficiencies and accurately critiqued him, but it was mostly assumptions about his game that are shown to be false if you look into the stats</p>

      <label for="lmuogl7" class="commentText"><p>Why would it strictly refer to the regular season? It can refer to each of their entire careers. Or do you think a Finals loss as your team’s third best player outweighs 4 DPOYs, 4 All-NBAs, 7 All-Defenses? Would be a hot take but you can go ahead and try and make the argument.</p>

<p>As for your other comment, Reddit commenters also weren’t saying anything that’s not already known. Lively has a clearly limited offensive game, he’s a relatively lower ceiling player, will probably never be as good as Chet and Wemby, and is in the Gobert archetype of players. Nothing wrong with that.</p>

      <label for="lmupie2" class="commentText"><p>Accept the things Gobert struggles with in the playoffs like pnr defense and iso on the perimeter, also inability to catch low passes, all these things Lively already excels at. Not to mention he&rsquo;s got a pure shooting stroke and is developing a corner 3 down the line, already has more made 3s that Gobert&rsquo;s entire career. And he was hitting hook shots smoother that I&rsquo;ve ever seen Gobert do anything offensive. It&rsquo;s selling him way short to call him a low ceiling player</p>

<p>The culmination of all of this, we&rsquo;ve seen the consistent pattern of Gobert&rsquo;s impact metrics falling in the toilet as soon as he hits the playoffs. This year, as a rookie, Lively&rsquo;s actually got way better in the playoffs and he immediately helped his team to the finals as the 3rd most important player</p>

      <label for="lmv465j" class="commentText"><p>Holy crap, Derrick Lively hit ONE three in his entire rookie season? Wow, you completely changed my mind. Transcendent player.</p>

<p>Yeah, no. This is the problem with fans living in a bubble lol.</p>

<p>Also, jesus talk about reading way too much into a small sample.</p>

<p>Lively defended 25 iso possessions in the playoffs and gave up 0.64 PPP. A very low PPP, which is good, but that’s a stupidly low sample size. Hell, Luka and Kyrie gave up 0.66 and 0.53 PPP on even larger samples. You’d be wise not to read into it too much.</p>

<p>It’s a complete myth that Gobert struggles on the perimeter or in pick-and-roll. He holds up as well as one can expect a center to. He’s just held to an absurd standard (while Lively is held to none at all).</p>

      <label for="lmuquws" class="commentText"><p>It’s around 12 less minutes per game and he was coming off the bench. That’s pretty significant, so it’s not like he’s going against the other teams best as often as Gobert would. Ultimately you’re always going to have a small sample size issues in the playoffs which is why it’s a tough comparing them like this.</p>

      <label for="lmujolw" class="commentText"><p>Everyone knows Lively was amazing.</p>

<p>A huge talking point was how he was so impactful for the mavs in the playoffs while ONLY BEING 20.</p>

<p>His defense was great, I didn’t know it was this great, but still great. And His synergy with Luka as a roll man consistently tore up defenses, which was the core of their offense.</p>

      <label for="lmvfivb" class="commentText"><p>The biggest reason for optimism was the free throw jump he had in the playoffs, going from 50.6% in the regular season to 59% in the playoffs. Still far from good but he’s put in a lot of work on it and wouldn’t be surprised to see it in the mid-high 60s next year. He’ll need to keep improving there before they trust him with jumpers on any kind of regular basis</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s obviously never had to use it, but the form of his shot is there. He&rsquo;s not a lost cause like he-who-shall-not-be-named or (probably) the Thompson twins, and he&rsquo;s not a guy whose jumper needs to be reconstructed from scratch either like Kawhi was</p>

      <label for="lmuqumq" class="commentText"><p>Yes he is amazing on defense and thats kinda why nobody mentions his offensive limitations.</p>

<p>This is kinda an issue witht he Mavs as a whole, but they have a roster full of guys that cant do anything much by themselves. Tbf the Nuggets have this exact same issue, but the Mavs offense feels more static and predictable. Though at the same time its quite potent and when Kyrie is on, there really isnt an issue to be had.</p>

<p>It aint a big deal, just feels like the series against the Celticw would have been difrent if Lively had more of an offensive game, but as a rookie cant complain with his performance.</p>
