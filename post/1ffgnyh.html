      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ffgnyh/opponents_shot_429_at_the_rim_against_dereck/"><p>Opponents shot 42.9% at the rim against Dereck Lively in the playoffs, the lowest percentage on at least half as many attempts since this stat has been recorded</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>As a 20 year old rookie, Dereck Lively put together one of the best defensive playoff performances of the last decade (data goes back to the 13-14 season). Not just as a rim defender, but also as a closeout/switch perimeter defender, as players shot 29.9% from 3 against him</p>

<p>People have a tendency to downplay Lively as a player because of his role and the talent he plays with. The turn &ldquo;got carried by Luka and Kyrie&rdquo; seems to be the common phrase thrown around by those less knowledgeable about the team. As Mavs fans know, it&rsquo;s not an exaggeration to say, without Lively, this finals team wouldn&rsquo;t have even made the playoffs. His impact in the postseason was felt even more, as the team was +98 with his on the floor (5th in the league) and -43 when he was off the floor. Both the defense and offense took a significant leap when he subbed in.</p>

<p>DLive on the floor: 118.9 Ortng  107.4 Drtg</p>

<p>DLive off the floor: 112.4 Ortg  114.9 Drtg</p>

<p>On/off: +14.0</p>

<p>Credit to 4ps22 for bringing the original stat up on r/Mavericks</p>

<p>Lively is a freak talent. I cannot believe that tanking last month of the lost 2023 season worked. It was the ONLY way we would’ve ever had a lottery pick during the Luka era because he was too good too fast.</p>

<p>We kept our pick and our lord and savior Nico saved our franchise PBUH</p>

      <label for="lmuogl7" class="commentText"><p>Why would it strictly refer to the regular season? It can refer to each of their entire careers. Or do you think a Finals loss as your team’s third best player outweighs 4 DPOYs, 4 All-NBAs, 7 All-Defenses? Would be a hot take but you can go ahead and try and make the argument.</p>

<p>As for your other comment, Reddit commenters also weren’t saying anything that’s not already known. Lively has a clearly limited offensive game, he’s a relatively lower ceiling player, will probably never be as good as Chet and Wemby, and is in the Gobert archetype of players. Nothing wrong with that.</p>

      <label for="lmupie2" class="commentText"><p>Accept the things Gobert struggles with in the playoffs like pnr defense and iso on the perimeter, also inability to catch low passes, all these things Lively already excels at. Not to mention he&rsquo;s got a pure shooting stroke and is developing a corner 3 down the line, already has more made 3s that Gobert&rsquo;s entire career. And he was hitting hook shots smoother that I&rsquo;ve ever seen Gobert do anything offensive. It&rsquo;s selling him way short to call him a low ceiling player</p>

<p>The culmination of all of this, we&rsquo;ve seen the consistent pattern of Gobert&rsquo;s impact metrics falling in the toilet as soon as he hits the playoffs. This year, as a rookie, Lively&rsquo;s actually got way better in the playoffs and he immediately helped his team to the finals as the 3rd most important player</p>

<p>Yeah, no. This is the problem with fans living in a bubble lol.</p>

<p>Also, jesus talk about reading way too much into a small sample.</p>

<p>Lively defended 25 iso possessions in the playoffs and gave up 0.64 PPP. A very low PPP, which is good, but that’s a stupidly low sample size. Hell, Luka and Kyrie gave up 0.66 and 0.53 PPP on even larger samples. You’d be wise not to read into it too much.</p>

<p>It’s a complete myth that Gobert struggles on the perimeter or in pick-and-roll. He holds up as well as one can expect a center to. He’s just held to an absurd standard (while Lively is held to none at all).</p>

<p>Not to mention he&rsquo;s got a pure shooting stroke and is developing a corner 3 down the line</p>

<p>I keep seeing Mavs fans say this, but the man shoots under 60% from FT and has attempted 3 three-pointers in the NBA. I would not expect him to become a shooter.</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s one thing if they actually understand Lively&rsquo;s deficiencies and accurately critiqued him, but it was mostly assumptions about his game that are shown to be false if you look into the stats</p>

      <label for="lmuqumq" class="commentText"><p>Yes he is amazing on defense and thats kinda why nobody mentions his offensive limitations.</p>

<p>This is kinda an issue witht he Mavs as a whole, but they have a roster full of guys that cant do anything much by themselves. Tbf the Nuggets have this exact same issue, but the Mavs offense feels more static and predictable. Though at the same time its quite potent and when Kyrie is on, there really isnt an issue to be had.</p>

<p>It aint a big deal, just feels like the series against the Celticw would have been difrent if Lively had more of an offensive game, but as a rookie cant complain with his performance.</p>

<p>Something the Celtics took full advantage off. Really a masterclass in coaching and defensive scheming.</p>

      <label for="lmy8if6" class="commentText"><p>You know the funniest part is that the Bucks are solely responsible for this.</p>

<p>Because they got rid of Jrue when they did, the Celtics managed to get the perfect guy for their team.</p>

<p>I mean luck, opportunity and an amazing front office go a long way.</p>

<p>And my god has the Celtics FO delivered for a long time now.</p>

<p>A masterclass in building a superteam, knowing when its over and shipping them all out and then reaping more rewards than you can inagine from it and drafting as well as you can.</p>

<p>If not for their questionable ethics with IT, it would be perfect.</p>

      </div>
      <label for="ln1rm71" class="commentText"><p>Yeah it&rsquo;s not so much coaching, it&rsquo;s a byproduct of all our success. Boston has spent 8 seasons competing hard and we&rsquo;ve done it in a wide variety of ways.</p>

<p>Coaches are limited by the talent on their roster.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We had teams that lacked spacing - So we added shooters.</p></li>

<li><p>We had teams where no one else could create for themselves - So we added ball-handlers.</p></li>

<li><p>We had teams where too many guys were trying to win with the ball in their hands - So we added guys who could help off-ball.</p></li>

<li><p>We also had teams that were very top-heavy for scoring - So we added scoring depth.</p></li>

<li><p>We had teams that were too small to properly keep up with elite size - So we added size.</p></li>

<li><p>We had teams that lacked on-ball defensive pressure - So we added on-ball defenders.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Because the team has consistently had deeper playoff runs, we constantly get to see what does/doesn&rsquo;t work and learn from our mistakes. Ainge/Stevens have constantly tweaked this roster to address issues that popped up in the playoffs.</p>

<hr>

<p>For example: Our very small 2017 roster got out rebounded by Cleveland. Brad Stevens in a post game interview mentioned the rebounding was killing other facets of our game. Our perimeter players had to leave shooters open to help our big men secure rebounds, which led to Cleveland getting a lot of good 3PT looks.</p>

<p>The next season Boston rolls out one of the biggest lineups in the league, including the addition of Aron Baynes, who had a freakish impact on team rebounding.</p>

<p>&amp;gt;Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Baynes’ season was his rebounding - or rather the team’s rebounding with him on the court. Andre Drummond was a dominant rebounder again this year. He once again led the league in rebounds and rebound percentage. Aron Baynes wasn’t any where near Drummond’s level for individual statistics.</p>

<p>&amp;gt;But somehow, the Pistons were a better rebounding team with Baynes on the court than Drummond. They averaged a rebounding percentage of +1.4 percent higher than the opposing team while Drummond was on the court, +6 percent with him on the bench. Their rebounding percentage was +6.3 percent higher with Baynes on the court and only +2 percent higher with him on the bench.</p>

<p>&amp;gt;<a href="https://www.detroitbadboys.com/2017/5/5/15552092/2016-17-detroit-pistons-nba-review-aron-baynes-was-one-of-the-pistons-few-bright-spots" target="_blank">https://www.detroitbadboys.com/2017/5/5/15552092/2016-17-detroit-pistons-nba-review-aron-baynes-was-one-of-the-pistons-few-bright-spots</a></p>

<hr>

<p>Whereas a lot of other teams are really working blind. It&rsquo;s hard to plan for post-season situations when you&rsquo;ve only got regular season data to work with.</p>

<p>The regular season and playoffs are different and you don&rsquo;t know how guys will perform or gel until you see them in that playoff setting.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ben Simmons was All NBA and a consensus future face of the league&hellip; until we saw how he struggles in the playoffs.</p></li>

<li><p>Al Horford&rsquo;s counting stats looked pretty underwhelming and people used to call him &ldquo;Average Al&rdquo;&hellip; until we saw his versatility and composure shine in the playoffs.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This off season teams like OKC, Minnesota and Dallas have had a taste of success and are starting to have conversations about the playoff viability of their team.</p>

<p>This is why Dallas added Klay Thompson, Dallas was 2nd in 3PA but Boston exposed how poor Dallas&rsquo; role players were at above the break 3s. So Dallas has naturally added an elite shooter who can hit all sorts of different 3PA.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of trial and error in winning and we&rsquo;ve had a massive head start over the other top teams.</p>

      <label for="lmw7787" class="commentText"><p>to be fair, we&rsquo;re willing to live with almost anyone posting up our guards. like unless you&rsquo;re Jokic or Embiid we&rsquo;re basically fine switching 1-5 when necessary— it&rsquo;s not our primary scheme like it was in 2022, but even if Lively had more of a post game I don&rsquo;t think it would&rsquo;ve made much of a difference</p>

      <label for="lmy8c2n" class="commentText"><p>Yes and no. Currently he has no offensive game outside of lobs and putbacks. But he clearly has a very good mind for the game. That combined with his length means that even as his athleticism declines I think he could anchor defenses or at least second units well into his 30s so long as injuries don&rsquo;t take him out.</p>

      <label for="lmvx8dg" class="commentText"><p>We&rsquo;re in a era where players are playing to or near their 40s so I can see him lasting a while. Lively can start in this league until at least 32-33, then after that is a question mark depending on development, injuries, etc. He does rely on athleticism and loves dunking, but he&rsquo;s a very smart center for his age with a natural understanding of the game and I feel like he can develop a shot eventually. I think his BBIQ will continue to grow and that&rsquo;s what will carry him once his athleticism decreases. Also his wingspan is 3&rdquo; less than Gobert, so even when he becomes more &ldquo;grounded&rdquo; that length will still disrupt opponents and he&rsquo;ll be a lot stronger physically than he currently is.</p>

      <label for="lmxfz7d" class="commentText"><p>Depends on his peak weight</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s polished on defense as rookie, his defensive IQ is great, maybe because he&rsquo;s pure blood center since HS (not guard or wing that have growth spurt). Good hands, play to his strength which 7&rsquo;7 wingspan, have understanding of angle on D, etc</p>

<p>But again, if your offense limited, and just defensive specialist especially as center, one big injury can make you out of the league in instant</p>

      <label for="lmxfp0f" class="commentText"><p>Lively has thrived in a much better defined role, mostly came off the bench, and is playing with one of the top playmakers in the league. Duren has been on the worst teams in the league, and the coaching and personnel has been full of question marks. I think it&rsquo;s hard to compare the two at this point</p>
