      <label for="lojnz94" class="commentText"><p>&amp;gt; Three members of the Seattle SuperSonics say they believe Carter intentionally tipped off a play during the final minute of the Raptors’ 101-94 loss to the Sonics in Toronto.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With 29 seconds remaining in that game and the Sonics leading 97-90, the Raptors called a timeout. After returning to the court, Carter lined up along the edge of the key. He was facing the Sonics’ bench with his hands on his knees. According to a member of the Sonics, before the play began, Carter said directly to the Seattle bench, “It’s a flare. It’s a flare.” Two other members of the Sonics confirmed that Carter told the Sonics bench that the Raptors were running the flare play.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>…</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to one member of the Sonics, the bench reacted immediately to what Carter said, with Sonics players saying, “Did you hear that? Did you see that? That’s (expletive) up.”</p>

<p>Another member of the Sonics said he discussed the play with a coach after the game, and the coach said, “If you ever do that, I’ll run you out of the league.”<br>
…</p>

<p>Asked why Carter would reveal the play, the Sonics member said, <strong>“We were all under the impression that he was sabotaging his team because he was getting booed by the fans and he wanted to get traded.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

So even if it happened, which is a big if considering this story didn’t come out until after VC was traded, it literally didn’t hurt the Raptors at all:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the play, which Sonics scouts had observed was a common go-to play for the Raptors, Carter worked his way up the key on the near side as Sonics guard Ray Allen followed. At the elbow on the near side, Raptors forward Matt Bonner set a screen on Allen for Carter, who then flared toward the opposite corner. The pass from Morris Petersen was too long for Carter to handle easily, and, unable to make a clean shot attempt, he passed the ball to Bonner, who hit a 22-foot shot from the top of the key.</p>

      <label for="lokobco" class="commentText"><p>The fact that the Raptors still scored despite Vince Carter tipping off the opposition doesn’t change the fact that he did it in the first place. Which the author cited multiple Sonics with direct quotes to confirm it happening.</p>

<p>What motivation would a newspaper based in Washington state have to fabricate a story about Vince Carter? Why would multiple Sonics players make it up? If it had been a Toronto or Canadian based outlet I would have been more skeptical.</p>

      <label for="lol0i5p" class="commentText"><p>You say it’s a fact but all I see is conjecture. No one is confirming that it happened.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Allen, who was guarding Carter, said: “I didn’t hear it,</strong> but that’s what those other guys were saying (after the game), Reggie (Evans) and those other guys. But all I said was, ‘Why would he do that?’ I don’t know why he would do that.”</p>

<p>When asked to detail the incident, Evans chose not to discuss specifics.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to get involved in that stuff, man,” Evans said. “That stuff is deep. I ain’t scared of Vince or nothing like that, but that is between him and his conscience. <strong>I ain’t saying it did happen or it didn’t happen.</strong> I’ll leave that for Ray. I’ll let Ray do all that type of talking, man.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And as far as why Washington would post a hit piece like this, I’m not sure. Maybe they owed Toronto a favor. All I know it’s dubious that this didn’t come out until a month after it happened and a few days after VC was traded.</p>

      <label for="lojmtpv" class="commentText"><p>The Toronto history with Vince is touchy. At his peak, he was beloved and probably on the level of Mats Sundin, who was the star for the Leafs at the time. That a basketball player could reach those heights in Toronto was unfathomable.</p>

<p>He was also the most popular player in the world and the first guy to really imprint the Raptors as a real team in the league.</p>

<p>But the nadir was bad. He was constantly pretending to be hurt when the team would go down, only to suddenly start to feel better if we went on a run and took the lead again. His effort level was horrendous. He sandbagged his way out of Toronto and really burned a lot of people.</p>

<p>And yes, management was wholly incompetent when Vince was on his way out. He was within his rights to want to go elsewhere and not spend his career on trash teams. But he went about it the worst way possible.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to reconcile all of it but at the end of the day, he is a huge part of our history. Both good and bad.</p>

<p>Love him, or hate him. Him leaving doesn&rsquo;t happen without that management, so no matter how poorly he handled the exit, if it wasn&rsquo;t for how historically incompetent the FO was, he would never have left.</p>

<p>It all comes back to management.</p>

<p>Vince never pretended to be hurt. I watched his entire career.</p>

      <label for="lokqrm6" class="commentText"><p>He had also missed like <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the games up to that point in the season so one of the big media narratives was how can you be an all star if you’re not even on the court?</p>

<p>I wonder what MJ thought of that whole ordeal.  I remember publicly he was supportive of Vince and was basically like “I would never ask someone to give up their starting spot for me, it is ridiculous that we are even talking about this and Vince should do whatever he wants” and he seemed to be a bit embarrassed about how big of a deal everyone was making over it being his last all star game.  But underneath it’s also not hard to imaging him thinking “and I took that personally.”</p>

      <label for="lokhn4s" class="commentText"><p>My point isn&rsquo;t so much the volume of people (Vince was the leader with like 1.7M votes, which isn&rsquo;t a huge number); it&rsquo;s that the Raptors had solely popular player with a territorially unique fanbase. Which helped get ASG votes in a much weaker Eastern Conference.</p>

<p>Vince Carter was insanely popular, but I still don&rsquo;t think he was &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s most popular player&rdquo; in 2000 over Shaq &amp; Kobe. He was in that 2nd tier with Iverson imo.</p>

Also, the trade package we got, which I refuse to beleive was the best we could have gotten, was possibly uglier. We traded a player in his prime, who didn&rsquo;t want to play for us, for an older beyond his prime player, who Refused to play for us, and a future non-lottery draft pick. That type of incompetence in the FO is what lead to Vince quitting on the team, and if a deal like that happened today the team would be flamed relentlessly. </p>

Granted, I was 14 when he got traded and all I could think about was the highlights he and Jason Kidd were gonna create but I didn’t despise how he left. In retrospect, yeah it’s pretty shitty some of the things he did to force his way out. But at the same time? It wasn’t like he was getting much help on the court.</p>

Rockets rightfully didn’t want to give an injured and washed looking CP3 a long term bag. but then they proceeded to surrounded Harden with post achilles tear John Wall and Christian Wood lmaoo. I’m impressed Harden didn’t flat out refuse to play another game.</p>

<p>Harden sucked it up and played with Kyrie, blowing out his hammy in the process. came in to the Nets and seamlessly became the PG, despite coming off the greatest scoring run in modern basketball. you can say what you want about Harden as a foul baiter, but dude has never done anything like what Vince did. and Harden is tiers above Vince as a player too</p>

      <label for="lolwhn8" class="commentText"><p>This is crazy that other fanbases are bringing this up repeatedly. People in this sub and online in general will spam snake emojis and bitch about the “weakest move in NBA history” about KD’s departure from OKC when he left in FA and played hard and professional to the very last game. KD at least played hard to the end and honored his contract. He left with the freedom to go anywhere. One could argue the cheapass Thunder management let him down with moves like the Harden trade and overall bad management.</p>

<p>Compare that with Vince’s departure from the Raps, when he refused to play hard at all while still under contract, sabotaged his team, and then became such a malcontent that the Raptors got jack shit in return. Alonzo Mourning was less than worthless on the Raps and went back to the Heat, where he started playing on a All-defense level again.</p>

<p>Is it really madness?</p>

You think he was just sitting back in his PRIME YEARS happy with his supporting cast and not asking the FO to sign some help or trade for halfway decent role players? It’s not all on Vince. I would want out too if the executives were inept at putting a team together and ruining whatever bit of a legacy I could muster together at that point. He helped put Toronto basketball on the map. That shit goes both ways. Yall just wanted the man to be loyal to a shitty franchise, win 40 games, be proud to wear a jersey, collect some checks, dunk and smile. That’s insane.</p>

<p>Vince Carter was one of the most popular players in basketball at that time. I was 14 and was buying every pair of VC Shox I could find as were all of my classmates.</p>

<p>Then LeBron hit the scene, Kobe got better, T Mac separated himself and AI remained the coolest mf to ever step on a court. Vince was just the odd man out. But all this hatred I’m seeing now? Not a thing in 04-06 unless you were a Canadian or a Raps fan.</p>

<p>But he whined and played like a bitch on the court as well as with team management. He went from leading the league in in-game dunks, to actively avoiding contact and settling for jump shots.</p>

<p>Especially for Toronto, his lack of success is pretty hard to ignore even if one sets aside how he left. 6-ish years where you won one playoff series, only made it to the playoffs 3 times and one of those times the team made it, you had no part in that late season turnaround due to injury</p>

<p>More realistically, looking only at their body of work for the Raptors, it&rsquo;s Vince and then Bosh with no one particularly close to them. Once Kyle and Deebo retire, they slot in 1 and 2 by a landslide. I have Pascal at 3 but a lot of people would put Vince and Bosh or a combination of either above him. But that&rsquo;s the obvious top 5.</p>

<p>Kawhi is the biggest outlier because he only has one season. But it was a transcendent post-season following an excellent regular season. It&rsquo;s hard to gauge where he falls in the annals of our history, but he easily has the most important season in Raptors history.</p>

The part that pisses me off is the revisionist history going on right now. No ill-will towards Vince, the dude put us on the map.

<p>Nah, to be real, he helped popularized the Raptors at a crucial time, so that&rsquo;s great. Screw his bum-ass, though.</p>

He was always considered a guy who would show up to play only when he wanted to and would sit out if he stubbed a toe. His nickname online was literally Wince Carter. Then he played long enough that a new generation of basketball fans only knew him as a respected elder statesman.</p>

If Pascal and OG felt that way, then they were absolute pros at handling it, and kept it all in house. They might have been ready to leave but they still gave it their all last season when they were still on the team. I was wayyy too young to have paid attention to the NBA when Carter got traded but it definitely seems like it was a much uglier divorce based on what older fans have to say and the media coverage from that time that’s available on youtube. My bad for writing an essay lol</p>

We promised Vince we would hire Dr. J as GM, then hired Rob Babcock instead. He made one of the worst trades in NBA history trading Vince to the Nets, since we essentially got 2 old bench players and a 16th pick.  We then replaced him with Brian Collangelo, which we all are aware of his issues in Philly. Best thing Collangelo did was hiring Masai, who left for Denver, before coming back and ousting Collangelo to lead us to the 2019 chip. </p>

<p>Add in that the weather isn&rsquo;t the best(similar to the other Atlantic teams, but still not great duting the majority of the season), you are in a different country with different culture and values, and you are paid less money. You are also having to cross the border and deal all that entails, and it is a tough sell. </p>

      <label for="lok9szw" class="commentText"><p><a href="https://www.basketballnetwork.net/old-school/t-mac-wishes-he-stayed-in-toronto" target="_blank">Tracy McGrady left the Toronto Raptors in the 2000 free agency because he could not get the playing time that he thought he deserved. Toronto drafted T-Mac 9th overall in the 1997 NBA Draft, but after three seasons and 192 games, he played only an average of 24.7 minutes per game while taking just 9.4 shots per contest and averaging 11.1 points per game. Still, shortly after his retirement and 13 years after he left Toronto for his hometown Orlando Magic, McGrady said he regrets leaving the Raptors and feels that they could have contended for an NBA title had he stayed.</a></p>

<p>Maybe playing him at 24 mpg wasn&rsquo;t the best management and forced him to be in that shadow to begin with? Here&rsquo;s some stats. In three seasons he played 177 games for the Raptors. Of those 177 games, he started 53 games. 53 games is 29% of his games played. So if he felt like he was in Vince&rsquo;s shadow, it absolutely was the teams fault for starting him less than 30% of the time they had him, and for allowing him 50% play time in the games he played.</p>

<p>My arguement is it&rsquo;s absofuckinglutely the teams fault T-Mac left. After he left Toronto, he never averaged under 33mpg again until his age 30 season where he began his decline. That&rsquo;s a solid 9 years after leaving toronto that his average mpg were 10+ minutes higher than his average in Toronto.</p>

      <label for="lomf6wr" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re basically just saying what I said, but with more words. He played behind Vince, and he wanted more playing time.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like they had him rotting on the bench, Vince was the better player, so he was the face. Should they have played him more, sure, but it&rsquo;s not like they slighted him in any way.</p>

<p>He was asking what about TORONTO players don&rsquo;t like. Not giving a player the minutes they want happens on literally team, every fucking player wants more minutes.</p>

<p>Water is also wet btw.</p>

      <label for="lok9ber" class="commentText"><p>For a long time one of the major issues was that we didn&rsquo;t have a private lane at the airport so all the players had to go through customs every time coming back from the US. Wastes a lot of time and was frustrating and passed through NBA circles as a pain point. I think it&rsquo;s been improved a lot the past decade or so through usage of the private terminal and speeding up the customs process, but its still weird.</p>

<p>On top of that, it&rsquo;s still a different country. You have to get used to the money being different and converting / carrying both if you are frequently going back and forth.</p>

<p>You are taxed based off where you play. It’s been studied time and time and time again that the tax differences between Florida (none,) California, and Toronto are pretty negligible for any top earning player</p>

<p>The nba specifically plans and compensates the best they can for the legal regional tax differences</p>

That would have been one thing.  But openly giving up?  He stopped dunking towards the end of his tenure with Toronto after years of us being spoiled by his highlight reel.</p>

<p>His first game back in Toronto as the villain?  he drops 42 on us in 45 min of play.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure he had another game around the start of his time with the Nets where he had ~20 dunks or something.  Just really pissed off the Raps faithful.</p>
