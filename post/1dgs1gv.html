Because of how well respected LBJ is if you want to champion him as your GOAT you sort of elevate Kareem to bolster your argument. If Kareem was seen as just a top 20 player it makes LeBrons accomplishment kind of weak; but if you vault him to top 5 you make a strong case for LBJ at 1.</p>

      <label for="l8rz3g5" class="commentText"><p>The trick is that you&rsquo;re asking today, so people will disagree with suggestion that something is not just eternally like today lol. The consensus on how Luka Donciƒá does everything ever his whole life changed like three times this month dude.</p>

<p>(You can already see this now in this thread, people mostly answer your question not with &ldquo;which player is seen higher by most comments today than by most comments in the past&rdquo;, but rather they answer &ldquo;which player is seen higher by most comments today then I today think he SHOULD&rdquo;. As result, a lot of players mentioned definitely do not fill the description at all, but the opposite).</p>

<p>But usually, any player that fills the boxscore fits this description. Anything else that happens in the game doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore, when most commenters are looking at the past there&rsquo;s only the Wikipedia bio of the awards and the boxscore averages and that&rsquo;s it. So anyone who has a lot of this, is treated higher now.</p>

<p>Some clear examples are Iverson and Shaq, or Nash and Kobe, or Rose and LeBron. Because of 1) whole careers, 2) individual &ldquo;lines&rdquo;, 3) overall career playoff wins, people today compare these players very differently than they were at the moment it was happening.</p>

<p>A thread up here about Bill Russell is also a great example too lol. Everything is said confidently, super confidently, but it&rsquo;s all just obviously guessed based on purely the ppg and who won the titles. Russell, for example, &ldquo;just had a strong team so that&rsquo;s why he was winning&rdquo;, which is said by many commenters based purely on&hellip; the fact that his team was winning, so obviously it was a good team and anyone would win with a good team lol. There isn&rsquo;t a single sentence in that thread describing anything else than ppg and summary of accolades, as in any other thread about the past I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>

<p>Kareem wasn&rsquo;t seen as THAT much of a player at the moment he played, of course he was gigantic, but he wasn&rsquo;t exactly called the best basketball player ever. For most people, he just didn&rsquo;t have that effect that he made the league overall more exciting to everyone that Bird and Magic had. Personally I think it&rsquo;s more just about how much you enjoy watching the game on TV than his religion and views etc., but who knows.</p>

      <label for="l8s2q76" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ll get attacked for this, but Dirk is a massive one. He was an offense only superstar, nobody was comparing him with Duncan or any of the other 4s of that era, he was much more of a big scoring wing like durant/carmelo (harden seems like a great parallel as far as perception of careers go).</p>

<p>The combo of lebron&rsquo;s choke and their win jumped him into this weird unstoppable status as if he never struggled right in the middle of his prime and was never a good two-way player.</p>

<p>mav fans tend to greatly exaggerate how bad their rosters were ignoring the other 28 teams in the league besides the lakers that also never sign free agents or get guys demanding trade to them lol. Those teams were almost always full of actual nba talent, something that is still rare to this day</p>

This makes him retire underrated on the outside looking odds on being a 15 players. Over time (and ngl, the Spurs decline since his retirement) there‚Äôs been a much larger appreciation for what Timmy did over the years and has pushed a lot of people have him top 5 nowadays, some even sneak him into the top 3 spots.</p>

<p>And yes, this is a retelling of a take from Jimmy Highroller, but it fits so perfect here it needs to be said.</p>

<p>Demarcus Cousins, he&rsquo;s reaching that stage where people are forgetting how he was day to day and just looking at his box score stats which looked good on the surface so he&rsquo;s getting Jokic before Jokic statements as a guy that averaged nearly as many turnovers as assists</p>

<p>Steve Nash, I think there is a lot more pushback against the stolen MVP narrative as advanced stats looks so good for him since until the recent offensive explosion he was at the helm of like 5 of the top 10 offensive teams of all time</p>

<p>Stockton, he gets put ahead of Isiah Thomas a lot these days or gets called underrated etc due to his incredible longevity and counting stats but he was never really considered MVP level at the time and has kind of experienced a second wind reputation wise post career</p>

<p>More controversial one is Rasheed Wallace. Really good player no doubt but people often speak as though he would be a superstar if he played today and sure he&rsquo;d be a better fit but I just can&rsquo;t see it. I think he had moments of living up to his potential but he wasn&rsquo;t a 27 PPG scorer or all time defender or anything that would push him over the top. He&rsquo;d more comparable to like Towns than an Anthony Davis for example. And I don&rsquo;t buy that he would destroy Draymond Green of all people.</p>

      <label for="l8s6zl7" class="commentText"><p>Scottie Pippen at least by some people.  Scottie was a very good player, but the legacy of the Bulls dynasty brought more attention to his contributions than other great players in the 90s.  So much so, that some people have suggested that he was the 2nd or 3rd best player in the decade.  That seems way off.  Hakeem, Malone, Shaq, Barkley, and Robinson were all easily better in that decade, but maybe slightly less famous cause the Bulls dynasty is often the first thing people remember about 90s basketball.</p>

Kobe is the biggest victim of this. He‚Äôs the only player I‚Äôve seen who‚Äôs always brought up and never given credit. Players who he eliminated, players who couldn‚Äôt accomplish anything, players who couldn‚Äôt keep up with him are called better when they couldn‚Äôt even touch him at their best. How does that make sense?</p>

<p>I think most people have Kobe over the likes of KD and Steph but might have him below Shaq since prime Shaq was better than young Kobe. LeBron is obviously better and Duncan is a toss up imo.</p>

<p>Outside of those 5 who from the 21st century is listed equal to or above Kobe?</p>

      <label for="l8sagyp" class="commentText"><p>Meh, I&rsquo;m 31 and I think it&rsquo;s absolutely true that his rep went up after he died. I think so much of Kobe discourse is impossible to parse because he&rsquo;s pretty objectively overrated by the vast majority of Lakers fans (I&rsquo;m sorry, he&rsquo;s not in the conversation for GOAT) and a lot of the people who say he&rsquo;s like the 30th best player ever (which I&rsquo;m aware is also wrong) or whatever are over-correcting to try to reach some sort of middle ground in the discourse to where they *actually* think he should be, like 14th or something like that.</p>

<p>Add in the people who found him incredibly distasteful after the allegations and you get a very confusing mixture.</p>

<p>Yes most of them will confidently say he‚Äôs better than Bron, and that‚Äôs just obviously untrue and stupid. Just like many guys today rank Kyrie WAY higher than he has any business being ranked.</p>

<p>Being great at basketball does not correlate to being a great analyzer of the game, or being able to see impact in the grander scheme of things. And no I‚Äôm not trying to sit here and say my individual opinion trumps a (former) NBA players, but when every expert, analyst, and stat can agree that Lebron &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Kobe, who gives a fuck what a random player from 2006 thinks?</p>

I feel Kobe leaving us so early is worse for his legacy long term, seeing him and watching and hearing him talk about basketball for the next 40 years would have been great</p>

The discourse around him when he was at his peak was almost entirely about how he was stat padding. I think 10 years from now people will remember how electric he was and how those KD/Russ teams almost made it to the top before KD defected.</p>
