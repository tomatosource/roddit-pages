      <label for="l8sv5dd" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, though in general opinion about Kareem was in the upswing during the late 00&rsquo;s, his book solidified people&rsquo;s opinion about Kareem&rsquo;s career being top 3 all time. Most have him now as higher than Bill Russell actually, but I at least give Bill creative liberty on Bill Russell over Kareem. He might have gotten his fandom license revoked if he put Kareem over him, but it&rsquo;s really close.</p>

      <label for="l8sx6lg" class="commentText"><p>Kareem had an entire HoF career before he got to the Lakers that people forgot about which Bill highlighted in the book. He was far and away the best player of the league in the 70s (forgotten age) but because he was &ldquo;boring&rdquo; to watch while the ABA had the likes of Dr J, a much more exciting player, people discounted his 70s career a bit. It was even more egregious than discounting Bill Russell&rsquo;s greatness, because at least Bill Russell had ton of competitors back then like Wilt, Baylor, Jerry West, and others. That&rsquo;s the angle that Kareem&rsquo;s detractors took. His time with the Lakers is just a half of his top <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> career.</p>

      <label for="l8sul7t" class="commentText"><p>I think in the 80s, people put too much on that &ldquo;11 rings&rdquo; for Russell and Wilt&rsquo;s individual accomplishments. Also, people often didn&rsquo;t take college into account. But when you pan back a bit from that, it&rsquo;s pretty clear that Kareem has the most impressive resume in NBA history and has a clear cut case for the title of GOAT.</p>

<p>There are people who always had him in the top three, but you&rsquo;re right, I think a lot of people would be inclined to put him behind Russell and Wilt before.</p>

Because of how well respected LBJ is if you want to champion him as your GOAT you sort of elevate Kareem to bolster your argument. If Kareem was seen as just a top 20 player it makes LeBrons accomplishment kind of weak; but if you vault him to top 5 you make a strong case for LBJ at 1.</p>

      <label for="l8su9ok" class="commentText"><p>At the same time, most of his team accolades came in the &lsquo;80s, when he was arguably past his prime as an individual player.</p>

<p>Also, when he retired as the all-time leading scorer in the NBA (38,387 points) in 1989, consider that #2-#7 at that time was Wilt Chamberlain (31,419), Elvin Hayes (27,313), Oscar Robertson (26,710), John Havlicek (26,395), Alex English (25,613), and Jerry West (25,192). No other player had reached 25,000 points yet at that stage. Kareem&rsquo;s scoring record (and the longevity associated with that, and seeming unreachability of that mark) held a lot more weight back then and theough the &lsquo;90s than it does now.</p>

<p>Now, 35 years on since Kareem&rsquo;s retirement, we have 25 players who have scored at least 25K points, including 7 over 30K. Kareem&rsquo;s record looks less special by comparison now.</p>

      <label for="l8ss9te" class="commentText"><p>I personally think he was set up by the woman who clearly had aims of sleeping with and blackmailing a celebrity. I also believe he was the victim of an overzealous racist DA in a racist small-town suburban Colorado county</p>

<p>But I have no way of knowing for sure just the same as anyone else has no way of knowing for sure&hellip;</p>

<p>Also one last thing. He never faced any additional allegations after that incident. Nor did any one come forward claiming anything happened prior to the incident either. Not that that is necessarily evidence of innocence but I do think it&rsquo;s noteworthy and not discussed enough. All the most prolific sexual deviants of our time (Cosby, Epstein, Weinstein, Trump, Clinton, etc) had small armies of women accusing them each. Even the QB in the NFL with all the massage women that came forward. With those sorts of offenders usually comes a pattern of behavior. In other words if it was genuine there would likely have been other victims to come forward over the years. That never happened with Kobe so it makes me even more inclined to be skeptical of his accusations</p>

Williams wasn&rsquo;t seen as a good point guard, more of a mediocre place holder. That being said, we&rsquo;re all better off for having seen him play.</p>

<p>Good for a starter but not a star, flashy passes not great scorer.</p>

<p>Was a great playmaker but because of how flashy the playmaking was he was viewed even better.</p>

<p>Like rubio was never was a top 5 playmaker in the league, yet looking at his pass highlights you could easily he tricked into thinking he was top 3 (and not 3)</p>

      <label for="l8st3wp" class="commentText"><p>He was the dictionary-definition of stat-padding. People laud his year leading the league in assists, but his teammates HATED him that year. He was tired of the league calling him selfish, so he selfishly passed tons of shots and yelled at his teammates to shoot after he passed it to them so he gets credited for the assist. Remember too that this was the era when counting assists was really strict, like if the receiver dribbles the ball twice or more that it isn&rsquo;t an assist. Wilt was the king of these achievement hunting records. He still is probably the best athlete the game has ever seen, but he definitely was not a good teammate maybe except the end of his career.</p>

<p>Also if you think Hack-a-Shaq was egregious, Hack-a-Wilt was worse. In late game situations, he often didn&rsquo;t want to get the ball because he didn&rsquo;t want to be fouled and have to shoot the free throws.</p>

<p>Or at least these were the stories told by his peers back then. Of course you can choose not to believe them, but Wilt is still a top 10, maybe top 5 player. If Shaq could&rsquo;ve been the best player ever if he cared to prepare more before the season, Wilt could&rsquo;ve been the undisputed best ever if he cared more about the team aspect instead of hunting individual achievements, ironically.</p>

This makes him retire underrated on the outside looking odds on being a 15 players. Over time (and ngl, the Spurs decline since his retirement) there’s been a much larger appreciation for what Timmy did over the years and has pushed a lot of people have him top 5 nowadays, some even sneak him into the top 3 spots.</p>

<p>And yes, this is a retelling of a take from Jimmy Highroller, but it fits so perfect here it needs to be said.</p>

      <label for="l8s2q76" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ll get attacked for this, but Dirk is a massive one. He was an offense only superstar, nobody was comparing him with Duncan or any of the other 4s of that era, he was much more of a big scoring wing like durant/carmelo (harden seems like a great parallel as far as perception of careers go).</p>

<p>The combo of lebron&rsquo;s choke and their win jumped him into this weird unstoppable status as if he never struggled right in the middle of his prime and was never a good two-way player.</p>

<p>mav fans tend to greatly exaggerate how bad their rosters were ignoring the other 28 teams in the league besides the lakers that also never sign free agents or get guys demanding trade to them lol. Those teams were almost always full of actual nba talent, something that is still rare to this day</p>

<p>There were like 6-10 elite 4s in the league during the late90s and early2000s and dirk played the same position in a sense but never really matched up with any of them and played a different offensive role from any of them. Dirk/Pau/Amare comparisons were constant</p>

<p>The mvp&rsquo;s came with massive chokes in the postseason, nobody was taking dirk as a tippy top player seriously at the time, he was never a two-way superstar</p>

<p>Pau was a legit franchise player and so was amare?? Amare was a straight up mvp guy for a bit and did plenty of damage against the mavs in the playoffs. Dirk being the best of a group by the end of their careers doesn&rsquo;t mean it wasn&rsquo;t a comparison? that&rsquo;s like the whole point of this thread lol</p>

<p>i&rsquo;m talking about general consensus not spreadsheet accolade comparisons, team circumstances determine a huge amount of any accolade</p>

      <label for="l8rz3g5" class="commentText"><p>The trick is that you&rsquo;re asking today, so people will disagree with suggestion that something is not just eternally like today lol. The consensus on how Luka Doncić does everything ever his whole life changed like three times this month dude.</p>

<p>(You can already see this now in this thread, people mostly answer your question not with &ldquo;which player is seen higher by most comments today than by most comments in the past&rdquo;, but rather they answer &ldquo;which player is seen higher by most comments today then I today think he SHOULD&rdquo;. As result, a lot of players mentioned definitely do not fill the description at all, but the opposite).</p>

<p>But usually, any player that fills the boxscore fits this description. Anything else that happens in the game doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore, when most commenters are looking at the past there&rsquo;s only the Wikipedia bio of the awards and the boxscore averages and that&rsquo;s it. So anyone who has a lot of this, is treated higher now.</p>

<p>Some clear examples are Iverson and Shaq, or Nash and Kobe, or Rose and LeBron. Because of 1) whole careers, 2) individual &ldquo;lines&rdquo;, 3) overall career playoff wins, people today compare these players very differently than they were at the moment it was happening.</p>

<p>A thread up here about Bill Russell is also a great example too lol. Everything is said confidently, super confidently, but it&rsquo;s all just obviously guessed based on purely the ppg and who won the titles. Russell, for example, &ldquo;just had a strong team so that&rsquo;s why he was winning&rdquo;, which is said by many commenters based purely on&hellip; the fact that his team was winning, so obviously it was a good team and anyone would win with a good team lol. There isn&rsquo;t a single sentence in that thread describing anything else than ppg and summary of accolades, as in any other thread about the past I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>

<p>Kareem wasn&rsquo;t seen as THAT much of a player at the moment he played, of course he was gigantic, but he wasn&rsquo;t exactly called the best basketball player ever. For most people, he just didn&rsquo;t have that effect that he made the league overall more exciting to everyone that Bird and Magic had. Personally I think it&rsquo;s more just about how much you enjoy watching the game on TV than his religion and views etc., but who knows.</p>

      <label for="l8s6zl7" class="commentText"><p>Scottie Pippen at least by some people.  Scottie was a very good player, but the legacy of the Bulls dynasty brought more attention to his contributions than other great players in the 90s.  So much so, that some people have suggested that he was the 2nd or 3rd best player in the decade.  That seems way off.  Hakeem, Malone, Shaq, Barkley, and Robinson were all easily better in that decade, but maybe slightly less famous cause the Bulls dynasty is often the first thing people remember about 90s basketball.</p>

      <label for="l8rzrje" class="commentText"><p>Rodman maybe?</p>

<p>He was looked at as a great rebounder and defender at the time too; but the advanced stats available today (which typically underrate a defender’s impact already) help put into context just HOW ridiculously good he was.</p>

<p>Dude had a season with OVER 20% offensive rebound rate. Then followed that up with 19.9% and 18.9% the following two seasons.</p>

      <label for="l8s1dfd" class="commentText"><p>Tim Duncan wasn&rsquo;t considered better than Kobe for large stretches of the 2000s but he&rsquo;s considered borderline top 5 as consensus vs Kobe&rsquo;s borderline top 10.</p>

<p>Demarcus Cousins, he&rsquo;s reaching that stage where people are forgetting how he was day to day and just looking at his box score stats which looked good on the surface so he&rsquo;s getting Jokic before Jokic statements as a guy that averaged nearly as many turnovers as assists</p>

<p>Steve Nash, I think there is a lot more pushback against the stolen MVP narrative as advanced stats looks so good for him since until the recent offensive explosion he was at the helm of like 5 of the top 10 offensive teams of all time</p>

<p>Stockton, he gets put ahead of Isiah Thomas a lot these days or gets called underrated etc due to his incredible longevity and counting stats but he was never really considered MVP level at the time and has kind of experienced a second wind reputation wise post career</p>

<p>More controversial one is Rasheed Wallace. Really good player no doubt but people often speak as though he would be a superstar if he played today and sure he&rsquo;d be a better fit but I just can&rsquo;t see it. I think he had moments of living up to his potential but he wasn&rsquo;t a 27 PPG scorer or all time defender or anything that would push him over the top. He&rsquo;d more comparable to like Towns than an Anthony Davis for example. And I don&rsquo;t buy that he would destroy Draymond Green of all people.</p>

<p>As a player, I think his rep was even better in his era, as others have said.</p>

<p>As a person, though, I’d agree.  In his era, which was more prudish, he had a rep as a trash-talking loudmouth.  But today, his talking has made him a beloved American icon who could straight-up run for president.</p>

<p>And like even those who consider tin duncan boring don&rsquo;t hate him (beyond teams that got bodied by the spurs year in year out) Like even sun&rsquo;s fans don&rsquo;t dislike Tim duncan, and they got beat by a duncan 3 of all things.</p>

<p>Dudes just well loved now for being like &ldquo;the perfect team player&rdquo; and now people don&rsquo;t care as much about him not being as flashy (even if early Tim was still flashy)</p>

After coaching the Warriors to 4 rings and elevating them to be the last real Dynasty we&rsquo;ve seen, I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s comparable (deservedly or undeservedly) to Pop and Phil Jackson. It&rsquo;s not crazy to think he&rsquo;ll make it to the Hall of Fame.</p>

      <label for="l8svyrw" class="commentText"><p>Kobe is the one that comes to mind most.</p>

<p>I already got into this debate, and people didn&rsquo;t want to seem to hear it.</p>

<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing: In every big series with Shaq by his side, Kobe shot like shit, even in ones they won.</p>

<p>Kobe was see as a ball hog with an attitude problem. He was disruptive. He alienated teammates. And this was before he was winning. He missed big shots. There were criticism that Shaq couldn&rsquo;t be left on the court in the closing minutes of close games because of his free throw shooting, and Kobe couldn&rsquo;t be trusted to finish because the Lakers&rsquo; biggest shot in that three peat were made by Fisher and Horry.</p>

<p>And the rape he admitted to (let&rsquo;s not mince words here: He conceded that, though he thought the act was consensual, it was clear in hindsight that the survivor of his assault did not). And that aside, the infidelity, buying his wife off with a ring, and throwing Shaq under the bus when police questioned him won him not fans.</p>

<p>When the Lakers chose Kobe over Shaq, a lot of people thought the Lakers would regret that choice.</p>

<p>And with Kobe not doing much that first year, the Laker being in the lottery, it looked like a bad choice.</p>

<p>This started coming around for Kobe when he led the league in scoring twice. It was an impressive accomplishment, but there was still talk of ball hoggery. And his team kept losing in the first round, so he was really in T-Mac/Melo territory when he didn&rsquo;t have Shaq.</p>

<p>But those 4th and 5th titles really softened the view on Kobe. But even so, when there were GOAT debates, and LeBron/Jordan debates went on, anybody who brought up Kobe got laughed at. A head-to-head comparison of Kobe and Jordan makes it abundantly clear that Jordan is objectively better. As subjective as comparisons are, they both player the same positions in careers that overlapped, and Jordan did more with less. There&rsquo;s very little in the way of an argument to say Kobe was better than Jordan.</p>

<p>Since his passing, people remember him more fondly, and I thin Shaq has been a voice that brings Lakers fans out to say &ldquo;Yeah&hellip; Kobe should be in that conversation to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No. He shouldn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s not even the best player at his position. That is clearly Jordan. Kobe was incredible as a player, not doubt, but clearly not the GOAT.</p>

<p>But I remember before, people wouldn&rsquo;t even have Kobe in their top 10, and not people are putting him ahead of LeBron.</p>

<p>So&hellip; right or wrong, that is one that has change a LOT.</p>

Kobe is the biggest victim of this. He’s the only player I’ve seen who’s always brought up and never given credit. Players who he eliminated, players who couldn’t accomplish anything, players who couldn’t keep up with him are called better when they couldn’t even touch him at their best. How does that make sense?</p>

<p>I think most people have Kobe over the likes of KD and Steph but might have him below Shaq since prime Shaq was better than young Kobe. LeBron is obviously better and Duncan is a toss up imo.</p>

<p>Outside of those 5 who from the 21st century is listed equal to or above Kobe?</p>

      <label for="l8sagyp" class="commentText"><p>Meh, I&rsquo;m 31 and I think it&rsquo;s absolutely true that his rep went up after he died. I think so much of Kobe discourse is impossible to parse because he&rsquo;s pretty objectively overrated by the vast majority of Lakers fans (I&rsquo;m sorry, he&rsquo;s not in the conversation for GOAT) and a lot of the people who say he&rsquo;s like the 30th best player ever (which I&rsquo;m aware is also wrong) or whatever are over-correcting to try to reach some sort of middle ground in the discourse to where they *actually* think he should be, like 14th or something like that.</p>

<p>Add in the people who found him incredibly distasteful after the allegations and you get a very confusing mixture.</p>

<p>Yes most of them will confidently say he’s better than Bron, and that’s just obviously untrue and stupid. Just like many guys today rank Kyrie WAY higher than he has any business being ranked.</p>

<p>Being great at basketball does not correlate to being a great analyzer of the game, or being able to see impact in the grander scheme of things. And no I’m not trying to sit here and say my individual opinion trumps a (former) NBA players, but when every expert, analyst, and stat can agree that Lebron &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Kobe, who gives a fuck what a random player from 2006 thinks?</p>

If the big ticket was playing with someone like John Stockton, the league would have been fucked. Cos KG played great defense as well, and his engine was always on 11 - he never ran out of steam. I don’t think Giannis even clears KG. KG had a sweet inside outside game that Giannis doesn’t have, and I love Giannis as a player. U need to stop this crazy narrative about KG. He actually deserves more respect.</p>
