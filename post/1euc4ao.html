      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1euc4ao/how_do_you_rank_kevin_durant_as_an_individual/"><p>How do you rank Kevin Durant as an individual player during his GSW run?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I’ve noticed that a lot of people are completely against showing love to KD during that era because of his easy rings. However, I’ve noticed that his numbers and performances can still be of value as an individual player.</p>

<p>On the same hand, a lot of us give credit to LeBron for taking his teams to the Finals, losing them but still having some generational performances.</p>

<p>If KD is able to be successful as an individual player in both the OKC and GSW Systems (his success in OKC can deny that KD only succeeded because of Dray and Curry’s playmaking and Kerr’s coaching), then are we underrating GSW KD because of his snake decision? Or is he ranked to you just right?</p>

<p>The reason I ask is because I don’t see people discuss GSW KD in the same vain as 2018 LeBron or 2016 Curry. I’m not sure if there really is a deeper reason, so I also hope to be educated on it.</p>

<p>steph’s off-ball impact, the highest ever, makes him the GOAT plug and play player. he does not need the ball in his hands. KD does, whether he’s perimeter or PF or whatever you want to call it, his impact is limited to when he has the ball.</p>

      <label for="lij8fmy" class="commentText"><p>The reason he gets the hate is because Golden State went 73-9 the year before and knocked Durant and OKC out of the playoffs in the conference finals. Instead of trying to knock out a heavyweight with the team that drafted him, he joined the heavyweight.</p>

<p>Durant is undoubtedly one of the best scorers of all time and he is an all-time great, but it is hard to look at those seasons in Golden State the same way when he joined something that was already special. Not many people can do what KD can do and he was definitely great, but a lot of other guys could have filled that spot. Curry also stepped aside those years to let KD do his thing and sacrificed his stats for the betterment of the team.</p>

<p>2018 LeBron was a different story. Kevin Love was the only other player on that team to average double figures and he was at 14.9 ppg.</p>

<p>Edit: Have a quick look at that 2017-2018 Cavs roster. It is something else…</p>

      <label for="lij9tvi" class="commentText"><p>If you don&rsquo;t factor in the team he was on, then as a individual player he was basically as good as anyone that has ever played. In the playoffs during that stretch, he was essentially averaging 30ppg on 50-40-90 with great defense. Add on the fact that he didn&rsquo;t need to be ball dominant since he was excellent off-ball in addition to of course being excellent on-ball. Yeah it doesn&rsquo;t really get much better than that. Obviously all this gets downgraded because of the team he went to, but deservedly so since he has never initiated that level of playoff success on any other team he&rsquo;s been on.</p>

<p>And its not because I&rsquo;m bad at reading.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s either because you&rsquo;re bad at writing, or you&rsquo;re just confused as hell.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m gonna try to answer the question I think you wanted to ask.</p>

<p>KD was the best player on the Warriors when he was there. He was better than Steph. Steph crumbled alot in the playoffs back then. Not because he&rsquo;s bad, but because he had some injuries and because three point shooting by nature is highly fluctuate.</p>

<p>KD is also generally rated below Bron, because as good as KD is and was, he&rsquo;s not as good as Bron.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone who matters actually rates KD lower than Steph, or above Bron.</p>

He was the best player in the league as an individual to me because he was the closest person to having a flawless offensive skill set. I believe you could have run him to any space on the floor, and he had a move he practiced to use. One of the biggest thing I hardly see mentioned is that he&rsquo;s as much as a team player as lebron or steph it&rsquo;s just his role as a team player is to score.On a scale form 1 to 10,1 being the lowest while 10 is the highest,he gets a <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>.</p>
