      <p>I know it sounds like Seattle and LV are locks, but here is an open request to Mark Cuban: complete your divestment from the Mavs and go make a strong case for a Pittsburgh franchise you would own! I know there are some doubts on media market scale and whether Pittsburgh will generate enough of a fan base given its “football town&rdquo; label, but this is exactly why an experienced guy like Cuban is the only one that can do it. Added hometown vibes will give him a boost other ownership groups wouldn&rsquo;t be afforded. It also places one of the expansions in the East instead of 2 western teams.. think about it, Mr Cuban. I think you can make it work.</p>

      <label for="lnjma8u" class="commentText"><p>After the Mavericks won the championship, Cuban went way downhill as an owner IMO. His habit of giving up on players right before they reached their prime continued, he signed the wrong free agents, struck out on acquiring stars, etc etc. I think their everlasting love of European players made them get lucky by drafting Doncic. Otherwise, I&rsquo;d give someone else a chance to own a new franchise.</p>

<p>He also has a low-key bad investment record on Shark Tank too, lol. As a businessman he made a miracle sale of a website at the peak of the dotcom boom which quickly fell apart months later and IIRC if you discount the net-worth gain from buying the Mavericks (which he said himself wasn&rsquo;t an investment), he hasn&rsquo;t beaten inflation or the S&amp;P 500 since then. I think his main skill in life is just sounding really confident.</p>

      <label for="lnjufeu" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think he’s fallen off. He’s been consistently inconsistent the entire time. Plenty good and bad. You know how frustrating it was through Dirk’s prime where it seemed like we couldn’t find a decent center? The two times he even gets DECENT help he gets to the Finals. Dirk’s prime was over a decade long and we couldn’t get any all-Star level help for him. Dirk’s loyalty and floor-raising simply masked a lot of the bad. Overall Cuban was still good though. I wouldn’t say he was average or bad despite some major mistakes.</p>

<p>His phone call to the Hawks owner on draft day got the team Luka. That move alone is a legendary one. He bungled the Brunson thing. The Kyrie situation has worked out so far in part because of Cuban and his handling and understanding of Kyrie. The KP trade should have gotten more in return. Bringing in Nico Harrison has turned out to be a smart move. Good and bad. All that and 2 WCF appearances in the last 3 years. The team just went to the Finals. Plenty other teams would trade places.</p>

      <label for="lnjvimg" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t know where the narrative comes from that Dirk mostly had no help. Dallas always built their teams through very solid depth and had four chances to win a title in 2003, 2006, 2007, and 2011. The years they didn&rsquo;t win they either choked, got injured, or were unlucky but Dirk was in a pretty good situation looking back. Especially in the 2000s era where most teams had one star player to build around. Nowitzki also wasn&rsquo;t blameless in some of those failures and this sub would constantly dog on him for being a &ldquo;choker&rdquo; in the pre-championship years</p>

<p>For a modern comparison, think of Jokic and the 2023 Nuggets. Sure he was the only all star but it was still a really good team</p>

      <label for="lnjxb8y" class="commentText"><p>I’m not saying he had no help. He’s had good teams. But they’ve had missteps and missed opportunities with the roster too. And they just never could pair Dirk with another star in their prime or much great center help for most of his prime.</p>

      <label for="lnjw3in" class="commentText"><p>I think he was a good owner for awhile because, as I understand it, he overhauled the team&rsquo;s facilities and uniforms etc as soon as he took over and upgraded everything. Then a few years later, he stacked the team with a lot of talented players like Nash, Jamison, Walker, Lafrentz etc to go with Dirk and Finlay. Then he changed that into a more chemistry-based team that won 67 games and made the Finals. So for that first 8 years or so, he did great. It just seemed like after they finally got the title something changed and he stopped caring and cut costs and blew the team up.</p>

<p>They did go to the Finals, I think that&rsquo;s mainly due to Luka, and the Luka draft was great, but I think they took him because they&rsquo;re obsessed with International players moreso than that they knew better than other teams (sorry to say this but they also have gone out of their way to overpay or acquire white guys like Chandler Parsons which I think was a factor).</p>

<p>TBH, they might have been just as well off in just keeping Jalen Brunson given how he made the star leap instead of getting rid of him and having to roll the dice on Irving, but I feel like that&rsquo;s Cuban&rsquo;s MO.</p>

<p>Tyson is the classic example of blowing up that championship team. I bet he regrets this.</p>

<p>that was so baffling to me at the time. felt the same with the &lsquo;21 Lakers. i get retooling, but let the Champs defend and if it fails, then blow it up.</p>

<p>i&rsquo;m not saying i would make a good GM or owner. maybe if he knew the cap would spike like it was going to soon, he&rsquo;d do it differently. still was weird to me at the time. Tyson was a great center for a player like Dirk.</p>
