      <label for="lcgsf9v" class="commentText"><p>This is somewhat crazy, but they actually haven’t been that good of a drafting team over the past 5 years.</p>

<p>Their picks were as follows (it’s possible I missed someone):</p>

<p>2019:</p>

<ul>
<li>21: Darius Bazley (bust)</li>
</ul>

<p>2020:</p>

<ul>
<li>17: Alexsej Pokuševski (bust)</li>
<li>34: Theo Maledon (bust)</li>
</ul>

<p>2021:</p>

<ul>
<li>6: Josh Giddey (disappointment)</li>
<li>18: Tre Mann (bust?)</li>
<li>32: Jeremiah Robinson-Earl (fine, fringe NBA player, but Herb Jones was picked 3 picks later)</li>
<li>55: Aaron Wiggins (steal)</li>
</ul>

<p>2022:</p>

<ul>
<li>2: Chet Holmgren (great, but no-brainer)</li>
<li>11: Ousmane Dieng (disappointment so far, trending toward bust)</li>
<li>12: Jalen Williams (fantastic pick)</li>
<li>34: Jaylin Williams (solid pick)</li>
</ul>

<p>2023:</p>

<ul>
<li>10: Cason Wallace (looking good, although still early)</li>
<li>50: Keyontae Johnson (too early to say)</li>
</ul>

<p>The real key to OKC’s success is being fucking amazing at plucking value from trades/free agency. Getting SGA in the PG trade was a coup. Plucking Isaiah Joe off the scrap heap was a steal. Snagging Dort as a UDFA was fantastic. Etc.</p>

      <label for="lcgvqq3" class="commentText"><p>‘19 and ‘20, sure. All picks were busts and better players went after the Thunder picks. If you go back further, it gets worse. Mitch McGary. Or Cam Payne and Dakari Johnson in the same draft. Josh Heustis… Presti historically has done pretty poorly between picks ~10-30, with some second round gems.</p>

<p>From 2017-2021, Presti went down a dark road of … longbois who couldn’t shoot. T Ferg, Bazely…  Usually oversized for position, decent to excellent defenders, who couldn’t shoot. I think it was a moneyball thing. “Teach them to play first base.”  He even went and hired maybe the best shooting coach on the planet. </p>

<p>Didn’t work. Still couldn’t get Giddey to be a quality shooter. I think as of 2021, Seems like they are going for playmakers, players than can create open shots for others. Maybe too much, but it seems to be working better. </p>

<p>Targets now seem to be…. Culture buy in, shoots above average, playmaker. Ajay Mitchell fits that to a T. Same with Flagler. Don’t know if Flagler will make it, but 10 assists for Mitchell tonight was solid. </p>

<p>But I do agree. They have drafted probably… well below average from 2014-2019, maybe slightly above average since, and they seem to have a formula that is working pretty well since then. And the real value is the trades they made along the way.</p>

      <label for="lcgwj3r" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I didn’t want to go too far back because I feel like Presti kind of lost his mind for like half a decade, going for tools over traits.</p>

<p>They’ve definitely been better of late, and have inarguably NAILED some picks (JDub, Wiggins, etc.). I just wanted to note that their drafting isn’t the primary reason they’re (in my opinion) the favorite for the 1-seed in the West next year — they’ve done a fantastic job of crushing everything non-draft to bolster the roster while having enough bites at the apple to also supplement through the draft.</p>

<p>Also, like you said, I was a big fan of Ajay Mitchell and was so mad he ended up in OKC.</p>

<p>The biggest weakness was drafting, and since ~2020, the philosophy has changed and it’s beginning to be a strength. Considering the pick cache… that’s brutal.</p>

      <label for="lch80c9" class="commentText"><p>Thanks. The OKC beat writers are garbage aside from Rahbar. Been a Thunder fan before there was a Thunder team. In college we used to drive down from Stillwater to watch Hornets games…</p>

<p>I moved to the Bay Area in 2011…. But flew back and paid through the nose for court side tickets for what I said was the only chance at beating 73 win team, game 6….…. Only to watch Durant’s bricks vs game 6 Klay. So… been through it.</p>

<p>Also…. Never told this story before. </p>

<p>Was a bit of Durant hater after he left OKC, living in the Bay Area. There were giant billboards right outside of the Oakland stadium, right on Hwy 880. Which, in 2016, cost $5500 for 6 months of advertising. I know because I got quotes for it. I paid for licensing for an image of KD in a warriors jersey, arms crossed, and made a billboard image. </p>

<p>At the time the warriors radio advertising was indicating its hard to get tickets because limited availability. And they repeatedly mentioned sellout crowds.</p>

<p>So I used my photoshop skills, an official KD warriors image I paid for, and I made a high res billboard image. And it said, “come see a sellout every night” had KD with his arms crossed and a hidden snake on his warriors logo. Clearly, referencing KD selling out for rings vs competing for a championship in OKC. </p>

<p>I was 3 days from buying 2 billboards on 880 with a KD is a sellout message and I found out my wife was pregnant. And I didn’t do it. </p>

      <label for="lchizhx" class="commentText"><p>The real trick that Presti has mastered, is that he is always extracting value. He never lets players reach free-agency, either locks them up or trades them for a return. If he&rsquo;s not doing that, he is using his excess cap space to take on expiring contracts in return for more picks, or he&rsquo;s rehabbing players and getting them to their destinations in return for more draft capital.</p>

<p>And if he&rsquo;s not doing that, he&rsquo;s punting draft picks for multiple future picks.</p>

<p>He is also extremely opportunistic. Waiting for a team desperate enough to overpay or sell too low.</p>

<p>The man has mastered the art of extracting value. His drafting is probably league average.</p>

      <label for="lch73u3" class="commentText"><p>I’m not sure about calling Chet a no-brainer. There were lots of people who had Jabari over him and said Chet would flop because of his frame. Hell, we all thought Jabari was going #1 until the pick was announced.</p>

<p>You’re right that ‘19 and ‘20 were bad drafts for OKC, no doubt about that. But it almost doesn’t matter when you absolutely body a draft the way Presti did in 2022. Getting two foundational stars out of one draft is wild. And part of this goes to show why Presti has taken the “more bites at the apple” approach to the draft. You’re inevitably going to swing and miss, but the more draft picks you have, the more likely you’ll hit on one. And a big enough hit makes the misses irrelevant.</p>
