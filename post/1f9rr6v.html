</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>You often hear players and coaches say something along the lines of “they shot 26 free throws, and we only shot 17! That’s not fair!”. And they will say this as if FTA should be evenly distributed, when in reality, the team that gets fouled more should be the one to shoot more free throws. If your team is shooting less free throws than the other team, stop fouling them more than they foul you! It’s so strange how the concept of free throws has become something that should be evenly split, instead of given fairly to the team that is getting fouled more. It’s like a speeder complaining the guy going the speed limit didn’t get the same amount of tickets.</p>

      <label for="llnomqx" class="commentText"><p>I’d argue that the real comparison should be about fair calls (both teams are getting calls or not getting calls for the same level contact). If one team is getting away with increased physicality while the other team can’t even breathe without getting called for fouls, then that’s a huge issue</p>

<p>As you mentioned, FTA doesn’t accurately depict who’s getting more or less “help” from officiating</p>

      <label for="llnqn4v" class="commentText"><p>I mean, this is obviously true, but how does one articulate this complaint? The first thing is going to be simple volume of calls. That&rsquo;s what we see in press conferences. What we don&rsquo;t see, is the complaints with video that almost every team sends to the league office.</p>

<p>The question is just: how do you complain about call fairness? What evidence do you use? Again, the simplest is just FTA disparity. But, it is, of course, just the starting point.</p>

      <label for="llnr38m" class="commentText"><p>The NBA has the L2M report where they discuss calls and give them an incorrect or correct call or no call. That would be a start, but the issue is expanding this sort of framework to the entire game, which I feel like they aren’t going to do, since it would expose any inherent biases</p>

<p>I agree that FTA disparity is the simplest way to evaluate “fairness” right now but I think it’s flawed and can easily be argued against like what OP did</p>

      <label for="llnp543" class="commentText"><p>It doesn&rsquo;t <em>prove</em> anything in a vacuum and of course players, coaches, and fans will be biased in their perspectives. Its just the only real data that you can actually point to though.</p>

<p>IF you think you are getting a bad whistle, then of course you would imply the free throw disparity is a result of that. Sometimes its an actual issue, sometimes not.</p>

<p>But if you&rsquo;re a coach and your team lost FTA by 10-15. Than the obvious implication here is &ldquo;we all just watched this game, does anyone think the actual foul disparity should have been this big?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again, its just the only real data point you can use.</p>

      <label for="llnprcn" class="commentText"><p>Usually the complaint is more sophisticated than &ldquo;they shot more FT&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s more like &ldquo;based on the level of contact that was called on one end, if it had been called the same on the other end, the FT disparity would have been much less.&rdquo;</p>
