The 1992 Dream Team only faced 21 fringe NBA players during their entire tenure.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Throughout the 1992 Dream Team&rsquo;s entire tenure (the Tournament of the Americas and the Olympics), they only faced the following 21 players, who were all at the very least fringe NBA players: Lazaro Borrell, Andrés Guibert, Leo Rautins, Bill Wennington, Mike Smrek, Stuart Gray, Mario Butler, Jose Ortiz, Ramon Rivas, Carl Herrera, Dražen Petrović, Toni Kukoc, Zan Tabak, Stojko Vranković, Dino Rada, Uwe Blab, Detlef Schrempf, João Vianna, Rolando Ferreira, Arvydas Sabonis, Sarunas Marčiulionis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fringe&rdquo; NBA player is defined as having played at least one game in the NBA.</p>

<p>In the last five exhibition games, the 2024 team has faced the following rotational players: RJ Barrett, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jamal Murray, Kelly Olynyk, Lu Dort, Trey Lyles, Andrew Nembhard, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Dyson Daniels, Jock Landale, Josh Giddey, Josh Green, Duop Reath, Joe Ingles, Nikola Jokic, Franz Wagner, Mo Wagner, Daniel Theis, Dennis Schroder, Wenyen Gabriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rotational&rdquo; NBA player is defined as having played at least 58 games (the league minimum for statistical awards) in the last season or the previous one.</p>

<p>Pretty cool to see the absolute explosion in international talent over the last few decades, the field is going to make the US work for its gold medal.</p>

      <label for="lek2oto" class="commentText"><p>Dream Team was known for three things: passing, ridiculous effort on defense and unselfishness. Yesterday’s game shows how badly NBA needs rule changes.</p>

<p>Offense is stagnant and relies purely on individual talent to survive, because that’s enough for the NBA with all the rule changes that benefit the offense. It might be cool for young audiences to watch their favorite player dribble the air out of the ball before hoisting a three, but it doesn&rsquo;t look good with international rules. That’s why a roster that is several leagues ahead of the opposition needs to be saved by a pensioner.</p>

<p>Croatia started Kukoc, Radja and Petro and none of those guys were fringe players and all might be in the HOF now. Kukoc couldn’t score a single point in the first game and they got blown out twice. Anyone think the current squad could keep Toni off the scoreboard for 40 minutes? Not in a million years.</p>

They had secured the road to the final and avoiding the USA until that final, man had other things on his mind.</p>

<p>For all the memery Pippen and Jordan talked later on, Kukoc in the first game was not the “real” Kukoc.
16p 9a in the final was much closer to that.</p>

<p>Schroeder, Shai,  Jamal Murray alone probably clear majority of the international players from 92 at the 1 and 2 as far as just pure speed, athleticism and skill.</p>

<p>Not their fault because of eras, but its a prime example on why comparing eras is stupid.</p>

      <label for="leldjxv" class="commentText"><p>That’s actually not what I said at all. Thats what you’re arguing. All I’m arguing is prime Jordan and Pippen are better guard/wing defenders than anyone on this team. I never said explicitly in the Olympics. A players skill doesn’t change just cause they play in a different country. Jordan and Pippen might have played easier competition in their Olympics but that doesn’t make them worse defenders. We saw the quality of their defense year in and year out. Them having an “easier road” in the Olympics doesn’t change that</p>

<p>Steph maybe at the height of his powers saw that for a possession or two, before 4v3 Draymond picked it apart (as is his greatest offensive skill).</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s equivalent would be sending the Jays to just guard Shai, and completely ignoring defending Lu or pre-trade Giddey. That would be a mistake, even as spotty as Giddeys open shot is and how awkward Lu&rsquo;s dribble can be, because JDub and Chet exist.</p>

      <label for="lek9ja2" class="commentText"><p>I mean its not the rule changes that are the reason the other teams have more  ball movement. ITs that those players have played together significantly more. Team USA&rsquo;s entire thing is that they practice for basically a month together before the tournament and beat teams that have played together for years. There arent any rules in the NBA that stifle ball movement</p>

      <label for="lelgo96" class="commentText"><p>Dream Team wasn’t together long either. But the style of play was a better fit for team play. Bird never held on to the ball. MJ, no matter how much he scored, he moved well without the ball and usually scored with one or two dribbles. The C/PF position was a black hole (as post players often are) but some of them could pass.</p>

<p>Rules don’t stifle ball movement, but the possibility to dribble 10-15 seconds off the shot clock without getting pressure from the defender who is handcuffed leads to more players doing that. Ball handler has all the advantages these days. It’s not a smart move if someone is hand checking you 20ft from the basket and pushing you one way towards the help defense. So it’s no wonder these super teams end up standing and watching when one guy does his thing. </p>

<p>If the NBA used fiba rules and players were more used to the Playstyle and the plays, we&rsquo;d have no trouble running them in international comp. Also Hali would be starting.</p>

      <label for="lekefe3" class="commentText"><p>Im sorry but this is just all pretty much wrong. First of all the idea that &ldquo;Celtics Ball&rdquo; doesnt feature heavy ball movement is incorrect. They had great ball movement last year. Second the idea that players who arent used to being role players would pick it up more quickly if they had &ldquo;Fiba Rules&rdquo; is just silly. What are the specific Fiba rules you are even referring to?</p>

      <label for="leklldu" class="commentText"><p>I mean the drive and kick, read and react type offense that many NBA teams run but none as effectively as the Celtics. There&rsquo;s plenty of ball movement but it&rsquo;s less directed. In contrast, most European teams are more heavily regimented and run more set plays</p>

<p>FIBA has lots of different rules and a different officiating style. No defensive 3 seconds and more physical play means you have to be more clever to open the lane up. When you&rsquo;re running more plays everyone, even the good players, get better at playing a role.</p>

The Celtics passed relatively less than most other teams, 168.3 passes per game. The 7th least in the Association ahead of mostly the teams you would expect like Dallas, both LA teams, and Milwaukee.</p>

The Celtics offense is predicated off creating an initial advantage and starting the chain from there, usually a drive. They were 3rd in hockey assists, and in top of the league is assists/pass% off drives. The Celtics ball movement is purposeful and they aren’t gonna be in the top half of the league in passes because they generate so many wide open looks.</p>

<p>Modern offenses are far more based on ball-movement and player-movement than 90s basketball. Did the Celtics win the Championship because they clobbered teams in iso basketball? How about the Nuggets the year before them? Or the Warriors the year before? Sure there are still teams that rely on individual talent, but those teams aren&rsquo;t rewarded with winning.</p>

<p>Compare that to Michael Jordan, where the rules were designed for offensive players to take their defenders 1-on-1. It was far from a heyday of ball-movement based offenses (like the 80s). Sure they had the triangle, but compare that to the off-ball actions of today&rsquo;s NBA and it looks like a baseball game.</p>

<p>Today Team USA relies more on individual talent because they only play together for a few weeks every four years. They&rsquo;re not able to develop the type of team basketball that the rest of the world employs. Instead, they lean on their advantage over the rest of the world; they&rsquo;re superior players. It may stick out like a sore thumb, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean the NBA&rsquo;s rules are to blame</p>

<p>But isn&rsquo;t the thrust of this article that Team USA is having a harder time due to playing <em>other rotational NBA players</em>? If the NBA rules were pulling down the quality of play, then surely they would actually be in a better spot because they are playing more NBA players than before? (See also the other thread on the home page: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ead1ml/1992_dream_team_faced_9_nba_players_in_the/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ead1ml/1992_dream_team_faced_9_nba_players_in_the/</a> )</p>

<p>If other NBA players are playing a different style of play in their national teams, that sounds far more like a coaching issue than a rules issue.</p>

<p>The best passers in the nba :</p>

<p>Lebron , Hali , trae , only Lebron is effective off ball passer if this group , I’d say lamelo too
Who’s great at that but people will undervalue.  Look at this nba team only Lebron and Hali who isn’t getting to be on ball
N run n fun to show out are natural too
Lvl
Playmakers  with vision n passing etc . When Lebron is on the offence runs fine when he isn’t the passing weakness shows up more .</p>

<p>Non American best passers who are top offensive players:</p>

<p>Luka , jokic</p>

<p>Anyway I’m not sure if I explained this very well but if usa had just one other player like say a healthy lamelo who developed without injuries you’d not worry bout stagnation .</p>

<p>The fiba team with reaves Hali running iffence flowed way better then Ant hero n iso ball. The reason you saying that is cos the game these days passing is even more important but most stars on USA team aren’t stars for there passing .  Also there’s plenty of individual scoring talent too tbh.</p>

<p>Also wtf you talking bout the players are way better now kukoc ain’t doing shit</p>

</blockquote>

<p>NBA has always relied on individual talent&hellip;. that&rsquo;s why the teams with the best players usually end up performing the best. However, successful teams like the 24 Celtics and the GSW dynasty have implemented incredible ball movement. To act like Superstars haven&rsquo;t enforced their individual talent is ridiculous. Jordan averaged 26 and 27 shots in the 92 and 93 playoffs back when the pace was slower than today&hellip;</p>

<p>This has been explained already that it comes down to making shots. The entire world has talent and shot makers unlike 92 where international talent pool was minimal. When they made shots they dominated Serbia and when they didn&rsquo;t they had close games.</p>

<p>To be fair, a lot of this comes down to how favourably referees treat offensive players rather than coaching. There’s definitely a hint of irony in what I’m about to say, coming from a guy who’s favourite team was the late-2010s Harden Rockets, but it has become borderline impossible to guard good scorers over the past decade or so with the whistle they get. I personally have gotten pretty bored of watching games when defense is such a non-factor these days.</p>

      <label for="lejdmb0" class="commentText"><p>Euroleague desperately needs to figure out how to get teams to actually make money. It’s ridiculous that none of the teams are profitable.</p>

<p>It would nice if they were able to get a US TV contract eventually. There’s millions of basketball fans in the US who could be interested, especially since so many Euroleague players are former NCAA stars.</p>

<p>On a positive note, the talent pool for basketball is increasing all over the world, and the Euroleague will benefit from this increased talent pool. The best European players will go to the NBA, but there is only 450 roster spots available. There will continue to be more and more very good basketball players unable to make NBA rosters available to play in other leagues.</p>

<p>Also the G league and NCAA really only involves very young players, so they will not be taking possible players away from the Euroleague while they’re in their prime years at least.</p>

The NBA earns hundreds of millions off their international league pass streaming and NBA TV deals with international content providers. There&rsquo;s global interest in watching basketball even outside of the US.  Seems like they&rsquo;re leaving a lot of potential revenue on the table.</p>

<p>The games are on at like 1 to 3pm EST too when there is basically zero other sports on US television during the weekdays. There is definitely an opportunity to get US basketball fans to watch that they are not capitalizing on.</p>

      <label for="lejwhcj" class="commentText"><p>US is a hard market to crack from a content standpoint. There are so many people competing for consumers that the cost of advertising and marketing in traditional ways is so expensive.</p>

<p>Euro’s would have to find a way to market through social media. Then the second issue is who are you marketing? Your most profitable players are young phenoms heading to the NBA in a few years. And if you have a guy that’s 23-25yrs old or older and you start to make him the face of Euro basketball and it’s successful then NBA comes and still gets your player. It’s brutal squeeze they are in.</p>

Theres a lot of college basketball fans that don’t enjoy watching the NBA, the Euroleague play style and atmosphere is far more similar to what they like. It even has a single elimination Final Four for their championship, similar to March Madness.</p>

<p>Guys like Markus Howard, Shane Larkin, Jabari Parker, Brady Manek, Nigel Hayes, Carsen Edwards, Scottie Wilbekin, Shabazz Napier, Thomas Walkup, Keenan Evans, Kevin Punter, Isaiah Cannan, and more all play big roles on Euroleague teams.</p>

<p>I’m personally from a state w/no pro team so I grew up on college sports. Even now I watch a lot. Once the kids graduate and go off I may like an IG post etc but I’m not following their career actively. The college is the fixture. Just my personal anecdote.</p>

It&rsquo;s a much more complicated situation than something like the CBA.

Not everybody is going to land in the g league or college, and even if they do get to college they are still going to wind up back in the Euro league a lot of times.</p>

<p>More good players around the globe means talent will find their way to the Euro league. They will be fine, it’s just not going to happen overnight. International ball has only gotten better and better in the time since the dream team. That will only continue.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at it another way&hellip; Kemba Walker last year scored 28 points in an NBA game, this year he was the 15th man for a middling EL team.</p>

<p>Also it&rsquo;s really hard to understand jsut how different the game in EL is if you haven&rsquo;t watched any games. It&rsquo;s way more physical and since there are more off days in between games teams have more time to prepare tactics and every match has the intensity and attention to detail of an NBA playoff game.</p>

<p>The talent level is for sure lower than in the NBA, however it&rsquo;s not as low as most Americans think imho.</p>

<p>During the lockdown season a bunch of NBA guys went to Europe temporarily and some of them failed spectacularly because weren&rsquo;t used to the tighter spaces and smaller margins of error.</p>

<p>Man to man defense in the NBA is A LOT harder because the court is bigger, defensive 3 seconds, can&rsquo;t touch anyone etc. This makes scoring easier. It&rsquo;s why there are only a select few really good defenders in the NBA, the athleticism and intelligence required to cover all that ground are incredible.</p>

<p>If enough people wanted it it would happen, right now it&rsquo;s a matter of self-promotion for EL imho, they have to present themselves as a great league to watch, cause they are, and try and increase revenue.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m positive that the North American market could be somewhat swayed to watch more EL action, especially with the NBA regular season getting more and more lackluster with each passing year. Unfortunately EL and FIBA have historically been awful at marketing.</p>

      <label for="lek1gsm" class="commentText"><p>That would be SO COOL.</p>

<p>I was thinking of creating loan contracts between NBA and EL teams. NBA teams can draft young raw guys and instead of letting them rot in the G-League they could send them to select European clubs to further their development. This would help NBA teams field guys that are NBA ready while still catering to the development of the youth, and it would also help Euro teams get more exposure, increase revenue and decrease wage spending.</p>

<p>Football teams do it all the time, players from the top leagues go to the lower leagues on loan to get game time and show what they can do while the main club can afford to play a 33 year old guy as a starter cause they know the youngsters will be ready when the time comes.</p>

<p>Just mind boggling to me that NBA teams wouldn&rsquo;t allow for that, maybe the player union is against it (but they like 2 way contracts for some reason?).</p>

<p>And he&rsquo;s right, FIBA games are 8 minutes shorter and there are a bunch of rules that are meant to help the defense. We&rsquo;re seeing it with team USA, if that team were playing with NBA rules they would average 140 points scored per game.</p>

<p>Also Luka averaged more points and assists in his rookie season in the NBA than in any of his seasons in the EL.</p>

<p>I think the gap is still far bigger than top EL = nba role player</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s mostly a difference in physical attributes. EL players are every bit as good at shooting and passing as the average NBA player. They are oftentimes better in fact, however they are also much slower and weaker physically. Doncic is a superstar because in addition to his great fundamentals and body control he&rsquo;s also really big and strong for a forward, if he&rsquo;d had Petrusev&rsquo;s body he wouldn&rsquo;t have been nearly as good.</p>

<p>The skill level in the euro league is lower than that in the nba. It shrinks every day. But it’s there. And the skill level is certainly not higher.</p>

<p>Like&hellip; Have you seen Team USA the last 10 years? EL players have been kicking the asses of the likes of Anthony Edwards and Haliburton for years (with FIBA rules), yet y&rsquo;all keep saying they couldn&rsquo;t hack it against more athletic defenders.</p>

<p>Sure, if they played iso ball or spammed p&rsquo;n&rsquo;r they probably couldn&rsquo;t, but if you&rsquo;ve watched a team like Pao or Real Madrid this year you know that kind of offense is hard to stop for anyone, not because the players are especially good in 1v1 situations but because the tactics tend to generate good looks.</p>

The vast majority of RS games are barf-worthy in terms of the quality of the game&hellip; It&rsquo;s just a bunch of super talented players taking turns playing isos and high pick and rolls, especially among the bad teams.</p>

<p>The simple fact that there are teams that willfully tank should be enough to realize that most of the NBA regular season is BS, just cheap entertainment for the masses that are incapable of appreciating good basketball.</p>

<p>Now granted, the NBA playoffs are the highest level of basketball on the planet and nobody is disputing that, however if we&rsquo;re talking about the quality of the average game all throughout the season&hellip; College and EL kinda have the NBA beat in that respect.</p>

<p>Detlef Schrempf, Toni Kukoc, Arvydas Sabonis, Drazen Petrovic, and Dino Radja were all really good NBA players.</p>

      <label for="lejjp38" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, just as an example, Sabonis was a monster despite not getting to the NBA until he was 31. He was second in voting for ROY and 6MOY that year, and he was 13th in MVP voting at the age of 34. Not to mention that before he came to the NBA, he was absolutely dominant in La Liga.</p>

      <label for="lekel6v" class="commentText"><p>The 1991-92 season was Schrempf&rsquo;s 6th NBA season, and per-36 he averaged 19-11-4 with about 1 spg and 0.5 bpg. He was 6th man of the year in 91 and 92, and he would go on to be an All-Star in 93, 95, and 97. In 95 he also made 3rd team All-NBA.</p>

<p>Petrovic only played from 1990 through 1993 due to dying young in a car accident, but he average over 20 points per 36 minutes in every season he played in the NBA, and was 3rd team All-NBA in 93.</p>

<p>These guys were far more than &ldquo;fringe&rdquo; or even &ldquo;rotational&rdquo; NBA players.</p>

<p>Of course the world overall has much more basketball talent now than 30 years ago, but one can make that point without calling some of the great foreign players of the time &ldquo;fringe.&rdquo;</p>

The cutoffs were &ldquo;1 game in the prior season = at least fringe, enough games to qualify for stats = at least rotational&rdquo;.  Jokic is far from a rotation guy, but he fits the 2024 cutoff by playing at least 58 games in one of the last 2 seasons.</p>

<p>The 2024 US team has already played against 22 guys who had a statistically qualifying season in the last 2 years, including a few legit All-NBA caliber guys.  In 1992, the only guys who meet even the threshold of &ldquo;could qualify for a stats award&rdquo; are Schrempf and Petrovic.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s just because the others hadn&rsquo;t decided to come over yet, or were still locked into their European contracts. Buyouts weren&rsquo;t a big thing at the time and long contracts were  - Pippen infamously locked himself into a long contract that soon dropped way below market value</p>

<p>So if you were signed with a Euro team through age 29, it meant you stayed until age 29.</p>

<p>David Robinson was drafted #1 and then spent 2 years on a boat, and then won ROY. Are we supposed think he wasn&rsquo;t NBA-ready in those 2 years?</p>

      <label for="lejdwwr" class="commentText"><p>I promise you that the Euroleague stars that played back then were more than good enough. NBA money for rotation players wasn&rsquo;t very attractive in the early 90s and the salary per game was way lower since they played no more than 30-35 games in a whole season back then (including the 8 team Euroleague - before it was named). Also players who did come were marginalized in an era where only one-on-one defense was allowed and illegal defense left bad defenders on islands. What truly opened up the NBA wasn&rsquo;t just the Dream team. It was the salary jumps, international scouting which brought prospects earlier into the league and most importantly, allowing zone defense and hand checking rules.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a bad definition because you can say the 2024 men&rsquo;s team faced 22 fringe players and it&rsquo;d be correct based on this definition.  You call them fringe to give the impression that those aren&rsquo;t good NBA players.  So there should be some limiting factor such as less than however many games played in that season, or however many minutes per game in a season.</p>

      <label for="lekvxcw" class="commentText"><p>Back then, the NBA didn&rsquo;t scout players globally like now.  Their loss. If today you have a 24 year old who is considered the best player outside the USA, he will be a top 5 lottery pick.  But in 1984, that player was a 6th round, 131th pick.  Oscar Smith.  Which is not on your list because he never played in the nba even after he averaged 25 ppg in the pre season.  He got paid more in Europe.  I&rsquo;m puertorican, and you would think that a rotational player like Carlos Arroyo or JJ Barea are the goats in PR basketball, but no. The goat is that fringe player you mentioned, Jose &ldquo;Piculín&rdquo; Ortiz.  He got no playing time in Utah in 89, so he played professionally in Europe and PR for 20 years and is a legend in Spain and Greece.  He could have been easily a 20-10 center but never got the opportunity.  And you would think that the 2004  PR team that beats USA 92-73 is considered the goat team or this year team with Jose Alvarado, a rotational player, but no.  The greatest PR team is that 1988-1992 team.  The great Yugoslavia team that win the euro cup undefeated in 87, an Olympic gold in 88, another undefeated euro cup in 89, and a World Cup gold in 90 only loss 2 games in those 4 years, one in the 88 Olympics and one in the 90 World Cup.  Those 2 loses were against Puerto Rico.  PR finished 6th in the 88 Olympics, 4th in the 90 World Cup, and 6th in the 92 Olympics, and they lost by 38 twice against the dream team.  Only team besides Croatia to lose by less than 40.  And that&rsquo;s a win, losing by less than 40 against the dream team. They dominate the rebounds and inside with Ewing, Barkley, Malone, and Robinson. They drive to the basket at will with Jordan, Drexler, and Pippen.  The zone was useless with their shooting of Mullin, Bird, etc.  Their passing was superb with everyone, especially Magic, Bird, and Stockton.  Their defense was brutally aggressive all the time.  Against Cuba, they were winning by 70 with a couple of minutes left, and they continued to pressure and steal the ball and go on a fast break.  They win by 79, including a last second dunk by Drexler.</p>

<p>He doesn’t fit the definition of fringe of playing 1 game in 1992 nor is he fringe when he did play in 1995. He the real deal.</p>

      <label for="lemidvx" class="commentText"><p>It’s wild to see how international basketball has evolved. The 2024 U.S. team is up against way more talent compared to the 1992 Dream Team. Facing 22 rotational NBA players in just five exhibition games shows how much the global game has grown. Back in ‘92, the Dream Team played against 21 fringe NBA players in total. This just proves how much deeper and tougher international competition has become. The gold medal is definitely not a given anymore!</p>

You really have people discounting these teams full of guys in their prime like this current iteration isn&rsquo;t struggling with Sudan and Germany. This team is more of a transition team than anything. We have the next generation of guys who will be in their prime next go around, and guys who are out of their athletic prime even if they&rsquo;re still extremely talented players.</p>

<p>But 92, 96, 08, and 12? You have a roster full of top 75 guys all time squarely in their athletic prime.</p>

<p>No reason to believe they would roll a team because they beat up on teams that wouldn’t have been favored against our select team at the time.</p>

<p>Level of competition matters and at least makes it worth a discussion. Beating the process 6ers doesn’t mean you’re stomping out the KD warriors</p>

Pippen was almost as good as Jordan lmao both shot over 50% from the field with massive defense. Kobe never got over 46% from the field ffs and was not better than them at D. These guys were on another level in this period. Pippen&rsquo;s prime for sure he was ridiculously underrated at this point as a player.</p>

      <label for="leketdt" class="commentText"><p>Cuz all the kids gush on Kobe like he&rsquo;s going to destroy dudes lol. KD and Lebron are on another level from the other team.</p>

<p>If anything the team with Kobe is going to have a weakness IMO. His shot. Robinson can guard KD as much as possible, and Pippen would guard Lebron no doubt or Malone I guess. Jordan would match up with Kobe and that leaves CP3 on Magic or Stockton? Pretty good matchup for sure, but Barkley would probably be a pretty big one up in his prime vs anybody else.</p>

<p>Harden and Westbrook are there but neither in their prime. So IDK what that does really. Depends on the rules of the era I guess in some sense.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still taking 92 on this one they got Malone as well ffs. I don&rsquo;t even know where to put all these dudes lol. At the end of the day I think 96 vs 92 is the closest because of the bigs. AD ain&rsquo;t no Hakeem or Robinson IMO.</p>

      <label for="lekci5t" class="commentText"><p>Bird was the only real weakness because he was injured and at the end of his career. Otherwise that team was solid as hell.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think you understand how good prime Jordan, Pippen, Malone, Robinson, Stockton, and Barkley were bud. You wouldn&rsquo;t be getting shit for free against these dudes. Pippen and Jordan were coming off some of the best years of their careers. 90-91 was peak Pippen he was better than most top 10s today easily shooting over 50% from the field with massive defense.</p>

<p>But, someone posted that no team the Dream Team faced in &lsquo;92 would even make the tourney this year (of course meaning the talent level of those teams.)</p>

      <label for="lek0o8e" class="commentText"><p>This team should still be beating any team they face by 30 points.  Kerr&rsquo;s rotations have been God awful.  He won&rsquo;t bench Embiid when he&rsquo;s either sucked or been disinterested.  My starting lineup would have been Curry-Tatum-Lebron-AD-Embiid, but I&rsquo;d maybe have to throw Embiid out with the way he&rsquo;s been playing.  My lineup would provide an excellent mix of offensive and defensive skillets while Kerr is just throwing shit out there without rhyme or reason.</p>
