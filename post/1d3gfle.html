<p>Maravich scored a ton, but he did it on low efficiency (49% TS, compared to 64% for Kareem and 66% for Walton) and against weak competition.</p>

<p>He also wasn&rsquo;t half the defensive player that Walton or Kareem were.</p>

The real reason why he isn&rsquo;t in the college goat conversation is because his team was mid the whole time he was there. The team never made the NCAA tourney and barely broke even. You can&rsquo;t be in the goat convo if you didn&rsquo;t make your team at least decently good for even one year.</p>

<p>If it was me, I&rsquo;d put Alcindor as the best college player of all time, Maravich second, and Walton a close third, but really there is a top three and a gap to Bird at number four.</p>

      <label for="l69g1um" class="commentText"><p>What is going on here? How are there so many uneducated fans in here with opinions like this? Pete was not close to bill or Kareem. There is a reason he was a loser. Kareem and bill played and beat the best, and were also dominant pros when Pete was mid. It‚Äôs a disrespectful joke to even bring him up with respect to them.</p>

<p>EDIT: just to give you all some context, Pistol played in an all-white SEC. Do you think there were any good black college players in the USA in the 1969-70 era? They weren&rsquo;t in Pete&rsquo;s conference. Nevertheless, his team was barely .500. Do you really think if LSU traded out Pete for Kareem, LSU wouldn&rsquo;t be the best team (or one of the best) in the country back then?</p>

Pete&rsquo;s team was a break even team and thus never qualified for the tournament. It&rsquo;s a team game so I&rsquo;m not saying you have to win the championship, but you need to make your team at least decently good for one year to be top 2 all time. And this isn&rsquo;t even considering other factors like his dad being the coach and let him take 38 shots per game over his tenure or playing in a largely segregated conference.</p>

      <label for="l69jfwp" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t know if Pistol Pete is really in that conversation if you consider context and not just numbers. His team was never even close to qualifying for the tournament. His team was plain mediocre every year despite playing in a segregated conference. His dad was the coach and let him take 38 shots per game on average throughout his tenure and he wasn&rsquo;t even very efficient for his time. It&rsquo;s a team game so I&rsquo;m not saying you have to win the championship, but you need to make your team at least above average to be in the conversation for CBB Goat.</p>

<li>No 3pt line yet so there was always around 3-4 guys in the paint</li>
<li>He was deceptively quick for his size. His quick turnaround fade kinda resembled Dirk or Hakeem</li>
<li>Had masterful use of the mid range banked shot way before Tim Duncan</li>

<p>One of the things you wouldn‚Äôt expect given him being a gangly white red head dude is he was actually an incredible athlete. You can see it a bit here how quick he is, he also could jump high and get off the ground quickly before injuries took it away from him.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s not in the same league as the truly elite centers of all time (Kareem, Wilt, Russel, Hakeem, Shaq, Malone, Robinson + current crop), he just didn&rsquo;t play enough. Consider the achievements of the first 3, Walton isn&rsquo;t scratching the surface .His peak is extremely respected though</p>

<p>Big man, no. Center, probably. You&rsquo;ve got the 7 above who are ahead of him, Jokic at this stage as well probably. Timmy normally listed as PF but played a ton at Center.</p>

<p>Walton&rsquo;s level is probably about Willis Reed, Ewing or Mcadoo. Would personally have him ahead of them but at that tier</p>

<p>Shaq specifically had an issue with him being placed alongside Wilt, Russell and Kareem. That&rsquo;s somewhat correct IMO, and given the time, 92, kind of stank of trying to get a white dude into the ad</p>

<p>I agree with that, think that&rsquo;s a near Universal opinion. Why nobody, not even Portland fans, slight him for having huge issues with the Blazers. He was unfortunately mangled</p>

<p>But the fact he could have been among that group doesn&rsquo;t elevate him to that level, fundamentally, because he never achieved those things. I like Walton, he always seemed like a nice guy. His career achievement are dwarfed by others and his peak was not Wilt-esque. It&rsquo;d need to be to be in that group</p>

<p>Put it this way, is D. Rose a top 10 PG of all time because of the career he would have had, or is he just an unfortunate injury that robbed us of a potentially generational player?</p>

<p>I think most would have KG, Dirk, (MVP/champions with better overall NBA resumes but skipped college) Karl Malone, and Barkley ahead of him (unless you are <em>very</em> concerned with rings in the case of the last two), and still many would have guys McHale and Giannis ahead (depending on whether you think Giannis qualifies here)</p>

<p>Idk maybe peak Walton is top ten but I think there‚Äôs easily ten bigs you‚Äôd take given how limited Walton‚Äôs prime was</p>

      <label for="l68mu7l" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s strategy evolutions over time.</p>

<p>Pick and roll existed but it wasn&rsquo;t until the mid 2010s that it exploded as pretty much a default action. The rise of the pick and roll led to the jettisoning of big men that couldn&rsquo;t guard away from the basket and also couldn&rsquo;t provide threat after the pick. Defenses eventually adapted by getting more switchable and now offenses are relying less on a high pick and roll and getting into more elbow actions.</p>

It&rsquo;s just not as pronounced or obvious as it is today because the spacing just wasn&rsquo;t there. All 10 guys packed in at the foul line and below, and not all the way out to the corners, either.</p>

Never has a post come into the NBA with such a complete offensive game.  Defensively, esp. his rebounding and shot blocking was over the top. Walton needs more recognition as a pretty unique player to any NBA era</p>
