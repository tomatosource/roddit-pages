      <label for="ld880qn" class="commentText"><p>I think they had their fair shot at a repeat. I finally got around to watching that series again lately (avoided it for years) and they really just shot themselves in the foot those first two games.</p>

<p>That being said, good lord Manu Ginobili was amazing. He had a couple duds that series (think he took a knee to the thigh in Game 3) but it was crazy to watch how he dominated almost every facet of the game in games one and two.</p>

      <label for="ld8bdhr" class="commentText"><p>Manu was one of the players who benefited heavily from the elimination of hand-checking. He wasn&rsquo;t that strong, so defenders could affect him by being physical. Once that was disallowed, Manu could pretty much get anywhere he wanted.</p>

<p>Manu 2004 (last season with hand-checking): 42% FG, 54% TS</p>

<p>Manu 2005 (first season without hand-checking): 47% FG, 61% TS</p>

<p>You can find similar improvements in other weaker/finesse guards, like Iverson, Nash, Tony Parker, etc.</p>

<p>Meanwhile bigger guards like Kobe and Joe Johnson didn&rsquo;t see much change, because they were strong enough to muscle through hand-checks already.</p>

That Pistons team is arguably the best defense ever assembled. they made their money holding teams to ridiculously low numbers. Including this game, they had a 5 game run of holding teams UNDER SEVENTY POINTS right after Sheed got there.</p>

<p>Adjusting for pace, that&rsquo;s like a team holding 5 straight opponents under 77 points or less today. If you wanted to find any 5 games (regardless of opponent) where any team finished with less than 77 points, you&rsquo;d have to combine the last 3 seasons together.</p>

      <label for="ld8jluc" class="commentText"><p>This was the second of five games in which the Pistons held opponents to 69 points or less. That streak left a whole pile of disgusting box scores in its wake.</p>

<p>Against the Trail Blazers, Portland&rsquo;s leading scorer was Zach Randolph with 11. The rest of their starters: Derek Anderson &amp; Damon Stoudamire (both with 8), Darius Miles (2), and Theo Ratliff (1).</p>

<p>As you mentioned, zero players finished in double figures for the Nuggets that evening, though six different players finished with 8. A well-balanced attack.</p>

<p>Rashard Lewis led the Sonics with 16 the next game but the rest of the starters paid a price for his outburst, scoring 10 points combined (Flip Murray - 5, Antonio Daniels - 2, Vitaly Potapenko - 2, Reggie Evans - 1).</p>

<p>Kendall Gill came off the bench and led the Bulls with 12 points on 5-of-15 shooting in their loss to the Pistons. Linton Johnson was the team&rsquo;s second leading scorer, finishing with 10 points on 4-of-16 shooting.</p>

<p>Relatively speaking, Willie Green went off against Detroit in the last game of their streak, scoring 17 points on 8-of-10 shooting. Unfortunately, the rest of the 76ers shot just 17-of-54 from the field (31.4 percent).</p>

      <label for="ld8bzys" class="commentText"><p>I remember watching this exact game with a friend back then (while we played NBA Live during commercial breaks). In addition to the clamps being applied, it was a total <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHSVoUzemQ" target="_blank">Pistons dunk show</a> that night too.</p>

<p>It was games like this that used to make me wonder if I was the crazy one or whether it was the rest of America. Because I&rsquo;d hear pundits and online forums talk all year about how the Pistons played boring basketball and lacked the starpower to be a true contender yet I&rsquo;d watch games like this, where they&rsquo;d squeeze opponents like a boa constricter, and I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how anyone could write them off.</p>

<p>As an aside, this was the second of five consecutive games in which the Pistons held their opponent to 69 points or less.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Game 1: Portland (83-68)</p></li>

<li><p>Game 2: Denver (97-66)</p></li>

<li><p>Game 3: Seattle (86-65)</p></li>

<li><p>Game 4: Chicago (98-65)</p></li>

<li><p>Game 5: Philadelphia (85-69)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, as many know now, the streak ultimately came to an end when New Jersey&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYOmGxLcE68" target="_blank">Aaron Williams tipped in a Hubert Davis miss</a> in garbage time to cut the final deficit to 18 (89-71), leading Williams to fist pump in triumph.</p>

      <label for="lda3kzv" class="commentText"><p>I think they would have held up well offensively, as we kind of got a glimpse of that when the league began to open things up in the mid-2000s. Their most successful regular seasonâ€”64 wins in 2006â€”came after the defensive reigns were loosened league-wide. Chauncey and Rip in particular seemed to welcome that increased offensive flexibility.</p>

<p>In addition, I think guys like Rasheed and Mehmet Okur would lean more heavily into their perimeter leanings today (though Larry Brown fought Memo hard on that). I also always figured itâ€™d be nice to trade the handful of post touches we felt obligated to give Ben each game for a couple of rim-running lobs instead. I think his efficiency would have gone up in that case, as floor spaced pick-and-roll rim-running hadnâ€™t gone big-time in â€˜04 yet.</p>

<p>The trade off in all this is that the 2004 Pistons wouldnâ€™t be holding anyone to 70 points or less today. But I bet theyâ€™d hold up well enough.</p>

Probably mixture of coaching change and rule change.  Like RIP Sheed and Billups shooting more 3s could&rsquo;ve been awesome.  But also at what point is it the case that Sheed is just a better option at center than Ben Wallace and going full 5 out.  Interesting options</p>

      <label for="ld8bgfb" class="commentText"><p>Watching Carmelo Anthony play basketball was just torturous back then. Constantly giving up on defense, looking off every pass possible, drifting in the way of other players looking for the ball. There&rsquo;s one in there at about 1:55 where he just waddles his way into the paint so that the Pistons can have an easy triple-team on a Nene post up. Then he gives up on the play so it&rsquo;s a 5 on 3 for an easy lay-in on the other end. Then at about 5:50 he gets blown by as Tayshaun Prince gets a poster, then finally shows some hustle to run it up on offense only to get an offensive foul. Gets out-hustled down the floor by Rasheed Wallace just a bit after,</p>

<p>Not to exonerate the rest of the team, though, what the fuck was Camby thinking with all of those 20-footers?</p>

      <label for="ld8dnmi" class="commentText"><p>Those are the kinds of things that would have driven Larry Brown nuts had Detroit drafted him.</p>

<p>Then it would have become a matter of whether Carmelo Anthony would get with the program and assimilate to Pistons basketball by &ldquo;playing the right way&rdquo; or whether he&rsquo;d see spot minutes his first few years because his vision for himself differed greatly from what Larry Brown insisted upon seeing (i.e. the antithesis of all the examples you mentioned above).</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s probably a timeline out there were Carmelo Anthony absorbs everything and becomes a better, more impactful all-around player in the long run thanks to coming to Detroit and learning from the best at the time, maybe even winning a ring or two along the way.</p>

<p>On the flip side, I also think there&rsquo;s a timeline where Anthony plays behind Tayshaun Prince his first couple years and more or less bides his time until he can leave to join a team for big money that&rsquo;ll let him fly free without having to worry about playing the right way, so to speak.</p>

<p>I dunno why everyone always only what-ifs the Carmelo scenario for you guys,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it stems from the general understanding at the time that the first three picks were going to be LeBron, Darko, and Carmelo in some order; it was just a matter of which of the two (Darko or Carmelo) would claim that second spot.</p>

<p>Dwyane Wade was a bit of a wild card at the time. He was a relative elder compared to other top prospects (22 years old whereas James, Darko, Melo, and Bosh were all teens), there were some concerns about his knee (had meniscus removed at Marquette), and some teams weren&rsquo;t quite sure if he was a point guard or shooting guard, or both.</p>

<p>So contrary to the top four (Bosh was mocked pretty reliably as going to Toronto), Wade&rsquo;s stock was all over the place. Some correctly pinned him as going to Miami at five, some had him going to Chicago at seven (probably leaning into the hometown connection), and some had him dropping even further.</p>

<p>As such, I don&rsquo;t think many folks run through a Dwyane-Detroit scenario much because it just wasn&rsquo;t really a feasible consideration at the time, especially considering Detroit&rsquo;s desire to shore up their front line with Chauncey and Rip already in their backcourt.</p>

      <label for="ld82yvf" class="commentText"><p>eh, Dre Miller could generate spacing because he was usually bigger than the opposing PG and had maybe the best post game at his position. but if he&rsquo;s watching Melo jab step multiple times and take a contested jumper, he was pretty much useless on the court</p>
