    <h2>
      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dz85uw/marvin_bagley_was_at_one_point_seen_as_a/"><p>Marvin Bagley was at one point seen as a generational prospect. ESPN basketball recruiting director Paul Biancardi once called Bagley &ldquo;maybe the best prospect I’ve seen in my time at ESPN&rdquo;. He went on to have an all time great freshmen season at Duke. So how did he bust so badly in the NBA?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Bagley was considered the #1 high school basketball player in the world above the likes of Zion Williamson, RJ Barrett, Micheal Porter Jr, Deandre Ayton etc. You might think &ldquo;high school basketball means little&rdquo;. Which is often true. But Bagley was equally as dominant in his lone season at Duke. He averaged 21ppg/11rpg on 64% TS as a freshmen, winning ACC player of the year.</p>

<p>He was dominating every level of ball until he got to the NBA and became a scrub. So where did it all go wrong?</p>

If featured in an NBA offense, he still could score a lot with solid efficiency, he has shown that, NBA teams just don’t run offense through players like him.</p>

<p>Can’t really shoot, not a playmaker, his post game lacked the finesse and skill for the league.</p>

<p>Plus, he just has bad defensive instincts. One of those guys who does drop coverage without actually protecting the rim.</p>

      <label for="lcdra00" class="commentText"><p>Funny as it sounds, it seems that the scouts did not consider that he doesn&rsquo;t really play basketball well. He&rsquo;s one of many players that are just not good at reading what is going on in the play and reacting to it, and his high skill at doing one thing at once is far from enough to even it up in real NBA games. NBA teams benefit from having a center that can react to the play and just is smart rather than just jumps high (maybe not the &ldquo;eyetest&rdquo;, but the game results strongly suggest so). And next to a traditional center as a forward, Bagley as a poor dribbler, passer, screener and shooter was not very useful on offense either. His &ldquo;great rebounding&rdquo; at youth levels also seems to have turned out to be a result of physical advantage rather than some knack for understanding the play and grabbing any surprising rebounds.</p>

<p>Weird injuries possibly did not help, some of them were phrased in a way that was hard to understand why he&rsquo;s missing so much time. Could be the reason why a player touted as very determined did not develop the skills everyone was sure he&rsquo;d develop over time. But the nature of his injuries brought many to question whether Bagley is determined to play in NBA games at all. The loss of &ldquo;athleticism&rdquo; also meant that Bagley stopped being good even at the one thing he does, getting the ball, going left and scoring.</p>

      <label for="lcdxahc" class="commentText"><p>Moving up the ladder in sports really weeds out the people who dominate the game based off their size and athleticism. Those two things alone can get your very far, but, eventually, you gotta learn the game. A lot of guys get to that point and just become apathetic towards improving because they&rsquo;ve never had to. They&rsquo;ve just been dominating off their size/athleticism, so when they reach a level where everyone is as big and athletic, the holes in their game get exposed. Same goes for highly skilled dudes who don&rsquo;t have the size/athleticism to match. JJ Reddick was one of the best college players ever, but he struggled when he got to the NBA because suddenly everyone is 6&rsquo;8&rdquo; and athletic as fuck. JJ still had a great career, but he had to work hard for it. I would bet you Bagley could have a great career as well if he put in the work, but that&rsquo;s hard and a lot of these guys don&rsquo;t have it in them.</p>

We have a long history of failing to develop prospects and sometimes making decisions that actively harm them (like making Tyreke switch positions after winning ROY.) Bagley was often injured, so he never got minutes to develop on the court. And like&hellip; his attitude kinda sucked. So yeah&hellip; there was a lot working against him.</p>

One of the most impressive things about Bagley is he reclassified. I thought it was a big deal until he was drafted by the kings and I noticed he is a year older than Zion who he was originally listed as better than. He reclassify into his own age group and it was a big deal for some reason.</p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t a coincidence every team he joins love him at first and then realized he just has two moves and doesn&rsquo;t do anything outside of his meme double jump. His best stats come his first year with a new team.</p>

The conventional wisdom before maybe 2021 or 2022 was that Sac was where rookies went to die. But maybe that was the picks they made, vs the development and system. </p>

<p>But they sure have turned it around since Bags, and props to them. I love the small markets being good (MIL), getting good (MEM, OKC, IND, SAC, NO), or having hope (SA, ORL, etc). MSP omitted only because they aren&rsquo;t a small market, at all, they have 4 pro franchises.</p>

Over the past ten years, having a non-shooting big who isn’t a rim protector is not a recipe for success. Someone like Zion is an interesting test case for that reason, but he is also a 1 of 1 athlete and finisher.</p>

<p>Having Bagley out there either means playing two non-shooting bigs in the same lineup or finding one of those rare few like Brook Lopez who can be your primary run protector while also stretching the floor. There just aren’t a ton of guys who fit well.</p>

      <label for="lcduk6p" class="commentText"><p>Combination of injuries, bad defense, and being one of those players that <em>needs</em> the ball in their hands to contribute on offense, and he wasn&rsquo;t great enough at anything on offense to be worth doing so.</p>

<p>That worked in high school and college where he was playing against inferior players and could use his athleticism and size to his advantage, but in the NBA suddenly everyone has that.</p>

<p>Same story for college football players. They dominate in high school and look like &ldquo;can&rsquo;t miss&rdquo; players, only to get to college or the pros and suddenly their size/strength/athleticism advantage is gone and the thing they&rsquo;d been relying on for years was unable to fill in the gap.</p>

Marvin bagley never had a surefire translatable skill coming into the nba. We know atleast sarr is a good defender that can switch and cover crazy amounts of ground and protect the rim even if the shooting never comes around. He’s pretty similar of a prospect to bam adebayo </p>

But u gotta disregard the situation he was in it’s hard for any teenager to start in pro leagues don’t look at the stats look at the film. I’m not a huge sarr guy cause I don’t believe in his offense but if you watch his defensive film tell me he doesnt remind u of someone like bam adebayo at  Kentucky. Hes not just swatting shots he’s got real defensive iq and switchability. He looks like. 7’1 herb jones guarding the perimeter imo. Why do u think he’s not an elite defensive prospect</p>
