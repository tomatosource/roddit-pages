      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dz85uw/marvin_bagley_was_at_one_point_seen_as_a/"><p>Marvin Bagley was at one point seen as a generational prospect. ESPN basketball recruiting director Paul Biancardi once called Bagley &ldquo;maybe the best prospect I’ve seen in my time at ESPN&rdquo;. He went on to have an all time great freshmen season at Duke. So how did he bust so badly in the NBA?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Bagley was considered the #1 high school basketball player in the world above the likes of Zion Williamson, RJ Barrett, Micheal Porter Jr, Deandre Ayton etc. You might think &ldquo;high school basketball means little&rdquo;. Which is often true. But Bagley was equally as dominant in his lone season at Duke. He averaged 21ppg/11rpg on 64% TS as a freshmen, winning ACC player of the year.</p>

<p>He was dominating every level of ball until he got to the NBA and became a scrub. So where did it all go wrong?</p>

Simmons, Lonzo, Fultz, Bagley, Ayton, etc.</p>

<p>Idk if we’re even out of that era lol, and I don’t think it’s nba specific because it happens a lot in the nfl too, but I feel like that’s constantly the rationale for off the wall picks like Bagley over Luka or Trae</p>

      <label for="lceumsc" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I feel like that couple year run of Simmons/Fultz/Lonzo kinda put a damper on the whole “just develop a jump shot in the pros, it’s not that hard” mindset a lot of people had.</p>

<p>Honestly, as for Bagley, this is just a conspiracy theory with no way to prove it, but I really think Vlade is just a ridiculously stubborn person who simply refused to pick Luka as a fuck you to everyone saying “of course Vlade from Eastern Europe is going to pick Luka.” So instead he went for the 1000 IQ pick of next big man off the board next to Fox to prove everyone wrong. No Vlade, everyone was saying ”of course he’ll pick Luka” because Luka was an insanely obvious pick, not because they think you have a European bias.</p>

<p>if its SOOO simple as you make it out to be, then why&rsquo;d they think he was going to be the best player the entire time to begin with, until suddenly he wasnt?</p>

<p>Frankly I think him busting has wayy more to do with the fact that he spend the better part of a decade floundering around on dumpster fire basement dweller orgs with zero continuity or structure like the Kings, Pistons and Wizards more than anything else.</p>

<p>If he had been picked up by a team with actual competent player development, like the Raptors, Celtics, Spurs etc, I bet his career is way different right now</p>

If featured in an NBA offense, he still could score a lot with solid efficiency, he has shown that, NBA teams just don’t run offense through players like him.</p>

<p>Can’t really shoot, not a playmaker, his post game lacked the finesse and skill for the league.</p>

<p>Plus, he just has bad defensive instincts. One of those guys who does drop coverage without actually protecting the rim.</p>

<p>“If featured in an NBA offense, he still could score a lot with solid efficiency, he has shown that, NBA teams just don’t run offense through players like him.”</p>

<p>This was the part I was talking about. He’s never been able to score a lot with solid efficiency and he certainly has never shown that ability</p>

      <label for="lcewzod" class="commentText"><p>Yeah the real issue is that he can’t do anything that allows him to fit next to others on offense. If he could operate as a playmaker with that scoring or take 5 standstill 3s at even like 36% or so then he’d probably be a star. That ability to get efficient buckets from the floor is a god send come playoffs if you can do it without driving down the efficiency of your teammates.</p>

<p>Plus, he just has bad defensive instincts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He just had bad <em>basketball</em> instincts. Dude never learned how to properly play the game on either end of the court. He wanted to play the game like it was a 1v1 sport.</p>

<p>Compounding those issues was the fact that he just didn&rsquo;t care about actually putting in the work and improving his game. (Probably a key reason why he never bothered to learn the game when he was just relying on his pure physical advantage.) His mentality was absolute garbage. He felt entitled to extensive playing time and being the feature player on the team despite being absolute garbage. When he didn&rsquo;t get it, because he was garbage, he just whined and threw tantrums instead of actually trying to get better at the game and earn the playing time and offensive focus he wanted. Dude just got consistently outworked and outplayed by guys that didn&rsquo;t have nearly the natural physical tools he had.</p>

<p>His dad probably didn&rsquo;t help with that mentality thing. Absolute chip off the old block. One of the worst helicopter parents a pro athlete could ask for. If his dad had taught him hard work and learning from mistakes instead of crying until someone gives you what you want, he <em>might</em> have actually been a generational talent.</p>

<p>I think the D was/is bad enough that he wouldn’t have been a winning player regardless, but he really needed that 3-point shot to develop to be at least serviceable.</p>

<p>Edit: And I really can’t overstate how bad he was defensively. I’m a Duke fan so I watched every one of his college games and he was one of the most lost players on that end that I’ve ever seen at that stage. Especially when defending PnR action. A feast for the opponent every time. Duke had to go zone that season almost exclusively because of him.</p>

<p>His body wasn&rsquo;t even great for a big man limited wingspan, ball stopping with no signs of making plays for others. It boggles my mind that he was so highly regarded. He couldn&rsquo;t handle the ball against any type of decent defender. It seemed obvious that he just was bigger and more athletic than the guys he was up against.</p>

<p>Like I get Vlade was the only idiot that had him above Luka but even then Marvin was regarded as a top 5 pick.</p>

      <label for="lcdxahc" class="commentText"><p>Moving up the ladder in sports really weeds out the people who dominate the game based off their size and athleticism. Those two things alone can get your very far, but, eventually, you gotta learn the game. A lot of guys get to that point and just become apathetic towards improving because they&rsquo;ve never had to. They&rsquo;ve just been dominating off their size/athleticism, so when they reach a level where everyone is as big and athletic, the holes in their game get exposed. Same goes for highly skilled dudes who don&rsquo;t have the size/athleticism to match. JJ Reddick was one of the best college players ever, but he struggled when he got to the NBA because suddenly everyone is 6&rsquo;8&rdquo; and athletic as fuck. JJ still had a great career, but he had to work hard for it. I would bet you Bagley could have a great career as well if he put in the work, but that&rsquo;s hard and a lot of these guys don&rsquo;t have it in them.</p>

<p>Which honestly makes it all the more insane that a guy like Ayton can sleep walk into averaging 16 and 10</p>

<p>Dude legitimately has the touch and talent to be a David Robinson. But he never had to learn anything beside a jab step jumper, a right hook and a surprisingly effective turn around fadeaway. Those 3 moves got him drafted 1st overall and a max contract. (+ playing with Rubio and cp3 2 of the better pnr passers of their time)</p>

<p>But those same moves + no handles, no post moves and mediocre defense and ball iq won’t take him to the next level as a legitimate all star or even all nba caliber.</p>

      <label for="lceokrz" class="commentText"><p>He’s actually regressed statistically, largely on defense. He doesn’t go for enough blocks, idk if he’s worried about foul trouble, doesn’t have the verticality, or just doesn’t have the ball mind to be able to anticipate.</p>

<p>Rubio gave him a career high scoring season since Rubio couldn’t score for himself and leaned on Ayton a ton in the pnr</p>

<p>The lack of anticipation and bball iq would make sense because it extends to the rest of his game whether it’s setting screens, running a pnr, or defending a pnr. Beyond that he’s uncoordinated, despite being a relatively fluid mover for his size.</p>

<p>Pretty much Ayton is the exact same player as he was at U of A</p>

      <label for="lcdra00" class="commentText"><p>Funny as it sounds, it seems that the scouts did not consider that he doesn&rsquo;t really play basketball well. He&rsquo;s one of many players that are just not good at reading what is going on in the play and reacting to it, and his high skill at doing one thing at once is far from enough to even it up in real NBA games. NBA teams benefit from having a center that can react to the play and just is smart rather than just jumps high (maybe not the &ldquo;eyetest&rdquo;, but the game results strongly suggest so). And next to a traditional center as a forward, Bagley as a poor dribbler, passer, screener and shooter was not very useful on offense either. His &ldquo;great rebounding&rdquo; at youth levels also seems to have turned out to be a result of physical advantage rather than some knack for understanding the play and grabbing any surprising rebounds.</p>

<p>Weird injuries possibly did not help, some of them were phrased in a way that was hard to understand why he&rsquo;s missing so much time. Could be the reason why a player touted as very determined did not develop the skills everyone was sure he&rsquo;d develop over time. But the nature of his injuries brought many to question whether Bagley is determined to play in NBA games at all. The loss of &ldquo;athleticism&rdquo; also meant that Bagley stopped being good even at the one thing he does, getting the ball, going left and scoring.</p>

We have a long history of failing to develop prospects and sometimes making decisions that actively harm them (like making Tyreke switch positions after winning ROY.) Bagley was often injured, so he never got minutes to develop on the court. And like&hellip; his attitude kinda sucked. So yeah&hellip; there was a lot working against him.</p>

      <label for="lcesomu" class="commentText"><p>No no, I realize what happened. I&rsquo;ve mentioned that McNair cleaned house (minus Walton and his staff for one year) in other comments. I got my wires crossed and thought I included that here. Essentially, things started turning around when Vlade got fired, so that&rsquo;s the line of demarcation for a lot of us between Old Kings and New Kings. That&rsquo;s why I mentioned it.</p>

<p>And sure I guess, but I think I&rsquo;ve just been influenced by so many &ldquo;Wow I can&rsquo;t believe XYZ player didn&rsquo;t turn into a star&rdquo; posts over the years that featured Kings players. Like Ben McLemore, for example, who we were excited &ldquo;fell&rdquo; to us. Which bolsters your point that they were probably bad to begin with.</p>

<p>I think there&rsquo;s also the numerous &ldquo;near misses&rdquo; where the players selected right after us turned out to be All-Stars or better. Sure, lots of other teams have those examples, but when we were in the middle of that playoff drought, a lot of us focused in on our history of bad drafting as a reason we were in the morass.</p>

<p>This still infuriates me to this day. We had IT and Tyreke at the same time but we gave them away for practically nothing because they weren&rsquo;t &ldquo;real PGs&rdquo;. It was no surprise their best seasons as pros was when they escaped the Kings.</p>

<p>How someone could go &ldquo;this person&rsquo;s best asset is that he&rsquo;s too big for guards to stop his drives &hellip; let&rsquo;s make him play Small Forward&rdquo; is fucking mind-blowing.</p>

      <label for="lce6fyr" class="commentText"><p>To add on to everything else being said, I think Bagley would’ve had a nice career in a different era. Over the past ten years, having a non-shooting big who isn’t a rim protector is not a recipe for success. Someone like Zion is an interesting test case for that reason, but he is also a 1 of 1 athlete and finisher.</p>

<p>Having Bagley out there either means playing two non-shooting bigs in the same lineup or finding one of those rare few like Brook Lopez who can be your primary run protector while also stretching the floor. There just aren’t a ton of guys who fit well.</p>

      <label for="lcdv58o" class="commentText"><p>No joke. His double jump isn&rsquo;t as effective when he is going against guys taller, longer and stronger guys. One of the most impressive things about Bagley is he reclassified. I thought it was a big deal until he was drafted by the kings and I noticed he is a year older than Zion who he was originally listed as better than. He reclassify into his own age group and it was a big deal for some reason.</p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t a coincidence every team he joins love him at first and then realized he just has two moves and doesn&rsquo;t do anything outside of his meme double jump. His best stats come his first year with a new team.</p>

      <label for="lcervmj" class="commentText"><p>As a huge Kings fan at the time, I had a front row seat to this and can tell you all about it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Inability to play within a role and to his strengths. Coming into the NBA, he had some attributes that translated right away: rebounding, hustle, putbacks, allyoops, rim running, etc, but rather than getting his feet wet by relying on those, he wanted to play some small forward ball handling stuff and shoot 3s. Was basically not willing to be a role player as a rookie, which made him hard to give development minutes to because he was a negative on the court.</p></li>

<li><p>Inability to improve his game. He&rsquo;s a classic case of having elite athleticism and elite instincts that got him through college, but when he got to the first pros and took his first proverbial &ldquo;punch to the face&rdquo; he did not take it very well. When he needed to dedicate time into improving weaknesses, developing strengths, etc., he just did not have the ability to do it. He&rsquo;s largely the same player today as he was back in 2018. Possibly even worse.</p></li>

<li><p>Entitlement attitude. This goes with the first two points, but when he hit adversity in the league, he never took ownership of it. Always seemed to blame everyone but himself. Expected minutes without earning it, and expected some big contract just by showing up. When coach stopped playing him, rather than look within to see what he needed to change, he played the victim.</p></li>

<li><p>Terrible support group. Noticing a pattern with the first 3 points? A lot of that can be attributed to his bad support group, specifically his dad. Classic &ldquo;snowplow parent&rdquo; who shielded his son from any adversity and fuels, or created the victim mentality and entitlement attitude. His parents moved to Sacramento with Marvin, and Marvin lived at home with them for the first few years of his career, so I know they had a huge influence on him. I wasn&rsquo;t surprised to find out that his dad was also his coach growing up, so a lot of Marvin&rsquo;s defensive deficiencies could probably have been honed in his youth, but his Dad/coach didn&rsquo;t see a need to develop that aspect of his game. In fact I bet he got little to no actual coaching growing up, which set him up for failure when he hit the big leagues. FWIW, Marvin is not the only son whose future was ruined by his dad. There was a younger Bagley kid who had some NBA interest while playing at Arizona State. He ran into a little bit of adversity and of course his dad steered him into the transfer portal at the first sign of a bump in the road and I never heard from him again.</p></li>

<li><p>Horrific defensive instincts. Even all the previous points wouldn&rsquo;t have tanked his career if the guy could just play some defense. Marvin is a good rebounder, hustles, a good finisher, and has great off ball instincts. Even if he never developed anything past his rookie year he could have been a good NBA player if he could just play passable defense. Unfortunately his defense is among the worst I have ever seen. He gave effort, and wasn&rsquo;t terrible on-ball, but his awareness was absolutely horrible, which you can&rsquo;t have as a big man. This was his Achilles heel, and because of the 4 above points, he wasn&rsquo;t able to address it, which ultimately made him unplayable. This is where I blame his dad most of all (besides Marvin himself). As Marvin&rsquo;s coach growing up, he had the opportunity to help Marvin address this weakness, but instead opted to shield him from it until it was too late.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>While other comments have mentioned that non-stretch bigs that don&rsquo;t play defense is a bad prototype, Marvin absolutely had the talent to be an Amare Stoudemire 2.0, but he just didn&rsquo;t have the mentality to survive once he got to an area where innate talent wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine how a former NBA center whose number one skill was probably basketball IQ could have been so bad at evaluating talent.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d already been through this with Jah Okafor, and yet the James Wisemans (and even Aytons) of the world are still fooling people.</p>

<p>He could NOT shoot with his right hand.  Period.  Not even if he was 2 feet from the basket.</p>

<p>He sucked on defense.  It didn’t exactly seem like he wasn’t trying but he had no defensive fundamentals.  Doug Christie (while he was a broadcaster) broke it down once on a play where Steve Freaking Adams blew past him.  He just simply had rotten defensive skills.</p>

<p>3pt shot didn’t really translate.  This limited his value if he wasn’t standing by the basket.</p>

<p>And lastly, he had trouble staying healthy.  Even if he’d hit a decent stretch, some random injury would occur and… oh no, we suck again!</p>

<p>He came in with an attitude (and dad) thinking the league owed him.  He wasn’t good enough for that.</p>

      <label for="lcenglw" class="commentText"><p>Bagley is basically a basketball mirage. He looks like a really good NBA player from a distance, but if you look closely, his skills don’t add up to an NBA player.</p>

<p>Specifically, he’s good at a lot of things, but not NBA caliber at many things. He’s big, but not big enough to play 5. He’s a good ball handler, but not good enough to handle the ball in most situations. He has shown promise as a shooter, but he‘s not good enough to space the floor.</p>

<p>His basketball IQ is also terrible, which makes him bad at everything you need to contribute to winning basketball (playmaking and defense most notably).</p>

<p>I watched him more with Washington this year. He still has skills. He gets counting stats with ease when he is trying.  But net negative defender and spend offensive possessions waiting for his turn. He does not help other players get buckets. He does not work hard despite being a bench player on a horrible team.</p>

The conventional wisdom before maybe 2021 or 2022 was that Sac was where rookies went to die. But maybe that was the picks they made, vs the development and system. </p>

<p>But they sure have turned it around since Bags, and props to them. I love the small markets being good (MIL), getting good (MEM, OKC, IND, SAC, NO), or having hope (SA, ORL, etc). MSP omitted only because they aren&rsquo;t a small market, at all, they have 4 pro franchises.</p>

      <label for="lcefoi2" class="commentText"><p>Going to add a semi-metaphor to the skills analysis for the general question.  If you’ve never had a big brother type beating you up on the court, you may never develop the initiative to challenge yourself against the bigger, faster, stronger, and Uber-competitive full grown men of the NBA.  There is a learning curve for all, and to suddenly discover you know longer are the most gifted person on the court in near every way can mentally stymie a player.</p>

<p>And if you add that many players are still learning fundamentals in their early career, it is not easy.  Without a good support system (family, friends and/or coaching), failures can snowball and stop development cold.</p>

      <label for="lceu6ig" class="commentText"><p>Reading through the comments, I feel like everyone is just repeating each other and what has been said about Bagley in the past.</p>

<p>Bagley is simply a throwback player that is playing in the wrong NBA era. His game is best suited for the 2010 or earlier eras that valued post scoring over 3&rsquo;s. If he&rsquo;s within 10 ft of the basket, he&rsquo;s a scoring machine and relatively efficient. Outside of 10 ft, he&rsquo;s useless and teams will ignore him because his screen setting is meh and he can&rsquo;t shoot. We won&rsquo;t go into defense, passing, or anything else requiring basketball skills since we already know he doesn&rsquo;t do those well.</p>

<p>If Bagley played 15 to 20 years earlier, I think he would have had a relatively successful career that would have surpassed players like Drew Gooden, Eddy Curry, and Nick Collison. He would probably be remembered much differently if he played in an era that wasn&rsquo;t so analytically driven to increase the pace and to shoot 3s.</p>

<p>Heck, Bagley would probably have scored a stupid contract like Jerome James (5/<span class="math inline">\(30M) or Eddy Curry (6/\)</span>60M) because someone would have just parked Bagley in the post for 30 minutes a night for a season and he would probably get <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> in the early 2000 NBAs.  If Isiah Thomas was still a GM, I&rsquo;m certain he would have thrown a 4/$120M contract at Bagley if he was given the chance.</p>

<p>That worked in high school and college where he was playing against inferior players and could use his athleticism and size to his advantage, but in the NBA suddenly everyone has that.</p>

<p>Same story for college football players. They dominate in high school and look like &ldquo;can&rsquo;t miss&rdquo; players, only to get to college or the pros and suddenly their size/strength/athleticism advantage is gone and the thing they&rsquo;d been relying on for years was unable to fill in the gap.</p>

      <label for="lcdt442" class="commentText"><p>Bro what sarr is an elite defensive prospect. Just cause he is athletic doesn’t mean he’ll bust. Marvin bagley never had a surefire translatable skill coming into the nba. We know atleast sarr is a good defender that can switch and cover crazy amounts of ground and protect the rim even if the shooting never comes around. He’s pretty similar of a prospect to bam adebayo </p>
