    <h2>
      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dz85uw/marvin_bagley_was_at_one_point_seen_as_a/"><p>Marvin Bagley was at one point seen as a generational prospect. ESPN basketball recruiting director Paul Biancardi once called Bagley &ldquo;maybe the best prospect I’ve seen in my time at ESPN&rdquo;. He went on to have an all time great freshmen season at Duke. So how did he bust so badly in the NBA?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Bagley was considered the #1 high school basketball player in the world above the likes of Zion Williamson, RJ Barrett, Micheal Porter Jr, Deandre Ayton etc. You might think &ldquo;high school basketball means little&rdquo;. Which is often true. But Bagley was equally as dominant in his lone season at Duke. He averaged 21ppg/11rpg on 64% TS as a freshmen, winning ACC player of the year.</p>

<p>He was dominating every level of ball until he got to the NBA and became a scrub. So where did it all go wrong?</p>

<p>But even without it, he’s still an offensive juggernaut.</p>

<p>I know he doesn’t shoot a lot of 3s, but you shouldn’t if you shoot 60% from 2s. You’d have to shoot over 40% from 3pt to be a better shot than 60% 2pt.</p>

Here&rsquo;s a quote after he played in FIBA qualifiers in 2012:</p>

<p>Before this experience, I was more of a player on the wing who could shoot the 3, but this experience took me to a different level where I want to post up and overpower people,&rdquo; Towns said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll still shoot the 3 if I have it, but I want to play inside more and be an inside-outside threat now that I&rsquo;ve added skills to my repertoire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Idk if we’re even out of that era lol, and I don’t think it’s nba specific because it happens a lot in the nfl too, but I feel like that’s constantly the rationale for off the wall picks like Bagley over Luka or Trae</p>

<p>Honestly, as for Bagley, this is just a conspiracy theory with no way to prove it, but I really think Vlade is just a ridiculously stubborn person who simply refused to pick Luka as a fuck you to everyone saying “of course Vlade from Eastern Europe is going to pick Luka.” So instead he went for the 1000 IQ pick of next big man off the board next to Fox to prove everyone wrong. No Vlade, everyone was saying ”of course he’ll pick Luka” because Luka was an insanely obvious pick, not because they think you have a European bias.</p>

      <label for="lcglbv5" class="commentText"><p>There was a time when this was a logical thought process. At one point players didn&rsquo;t really practice shooting during their youth and HS years, so it was possible to find an athletic specimen who couldn&rsquo;t shoot not because he lacked talent/touch but because he was never taught how to. These days players are working with shooting coaches so early in their development. If they haven&rsquo;t developed a shot by their senior year of high school then it&rsquo;s doubtful they&rsquo;ll ever develop one.</p>

<p>none of these players were really seen as &ldquo;athletic freaks&rdquo; outside of maybe Bagley</p>

<p>Simmons was coveted bc of his unique combination of size and playmaking making him incredibly well rounded as a scorer/passer/defender/rebounder, Lonzo/Fultz for similar playmaking reasons, and Ayton was seen as a dominant big man archetype, but still somewhat plodding/not particularly &ldquo;athletic&rdquo;</p>

He projected so well because he was giant, strong, and quick. Look at public scouting reports for both their draft year and they call out how great an athlete these guys were.</p>

<p>an athletic freak over more developed players with less athletic ceiling in the hopes that they can develop in the pros. Simmons, Lonzo, Fultz, Bagley, Ayton, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Impressively poor selection to make your point.</p>

<p>Simmons was a great athlete and really big, but he was a playmaker. What was unique is he was going to be the next Blake Griffin (the very athletic, but playmaker) or a huge point guard.</p>

<p>Lonzo was an incredible playmaker and good shooter.</p>

<p>Fultz was a good athlete but nothing crazy. He was meant to be an on-ball PnR master who could score at all three levels.</p>

<p>Bagley makes sense.</p>

<p>Ayron was a great athlete. But specifically he was a physical specimen with his size, strength, and touch.</p>

      <label for="lcezuvd" class="commentText"><p>Generally speaking, if a player in college is incredible in college because they out-athlete everybody else and that is <em>the most defining trait</em> they’ve got, then I’m very weary of their ability to succeed at the NBA level. It’s great to be uber-athletic, but you gotta have SOMETHING else you can hang your hat on, cause that athletic gap is a lot smaller in the league.</p>

<p>There are obviously exceptions to the rule, and those are guys who are like the 1% athletes like Zion. And his athleticism was a tool in other areas, like his defense in college. Bagley never came close to that defensively.</p>

<p>But Vlade fell in love with the DoUbLe JuMP and the rest is history.</p>

<p>if its SOOO simple as you make it out to be, then why&rsquo;d they think he was going to be the best player the entire time to begin with, until suddenly he wasnt?</p>

<p>Frankly I think him busting has wayy more to do with the fact that he spend the better part of a decade floundering around on dumpster fire basement dweller orgs with zero continuity or structure like the Kings, Pistons and Wizards more than anything else.</p>

<p>If he had been picked up by a team with actual competent player development, like the Raptors, Celtics, Spurs etc, I bet his career is way different right now</p>

We had Dave Joerger at HC for Bagley’s rookie year and that was his best year but then the players ran him out and Bagley listened more to his dad (AAU coach) than he did to our staff. 3 years in and Bagley still couldn’t finish layup with his right hand, that’s just bad work ethic.</p>

      <label for="lcf6n57" class="commentText"><p>As a Kings fan, I’d say that there were a few factors. Awful development under Walton played a role (he showed signs that he might develop into a good shooter during his rookie year when Joerger was the coach). Although he’s very athletic, he doesn’t have a lot of offensive skills (his shot was the only skill that looked promising), his basketball IQ isn’t good and his defense has always been awful.</p>

      <label for="lcfg293" class="commentText"><p>There is definitely an element of lack of development. Whether that’s his fault or the teams he’s been on’s fault is up for interpretation. He definitely had a solid baseline coming out of college and never really got better and just when it seemed like he might be turning a corner he’d have a major injury.</p>

<p>I think the D was/is bad enough that he wouldn’t have been a winning player regardless, but he really needed that 3-point shot to develop to be at least serviceable.</p>

<p>Edit: And I really can’t overstate how bad he was defensively. I’m a Duke fan so I watched every one of his college games and he was one of the most lost players on that end that I’ve ever seen at that stage. Especially when defending PnR action. A feast for the opponent every time. Duke had to go zone that season almost exclusively because of him.</p>

<p>His body wasn&rsquo;t even great for a big man limited wingspan, ball stopping with no signs of making plays for others. It boggles my mind that he was so highly regarded. He couldn&rsquo;t handle the ball against any type of decent defender. It seemed obvious that he just was bigger and more athletic than the guys he was up against.</p>

<p>Like I get Vlade was the only idiot that had him above Luka but even then Marvin was regarded as a top 5 pick.</p>

<p>What? WC contributed to a top 3 defense in the NBA last year, he&rsquo;s just not a flashy shot blocker. He can also shoot league average 3pt% and keep the ball moving on offense, unlike Bagley. He would be an amazing fit on the current Kings.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>He just had bad <em>basketball</em> instincts. Dude never learned how to properly play the game on either end of the court. He wanted to play the game like it was a 1v1 sport.</p>

<p>Compounding those issues was the fact that he just didn&rsquo;t care about actually putting in the work and improving his game. (Probably a key reason why he never bothered to learn the game when he was just relying on his pure physical advantage.) His mentality was absolute garbage. He felt entitled to extensive playing time and being the feature player on the team despite being absolute garbage. When he didn&rsquo;t get it, because he was garbage, he just whined and threw tantrums instead of actually trying to get better at the game and earn the playing time and offensive focus he wanted. Dude just got consistently outworked and outplayed by guys that didn&rsquo;t have nearly the natural physical tools he had.</p>

<p>His dad probably didn&rsquo;t help with that mentality thing. Absolute chip off the old block. One of the worst helicopter parents a pro athlete could ask for. If his dad had taught him hard work and learning from mistakes instead of crying until someone gives you what you want, he <em>might</em> have actually been a generational talent.</p>

      <label for="lcervmj" class="commentText"><p>As a huge Kings fan at the time, I had a front row seat to this and can tell you all about it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Inability to play within a role and to his strengths. Coming into the NBA, he had some attributes that translated right away: rebounding, hustle, putbacks, allyoops, rim running, etc, but rather than getting his feet wet by relying on those, he wanted to play some small forward ball handling stuff and shoot 3s. Was basically not willing to be a role player as a rookie, which made him hard to give development minutes to because he was a negative on the court.</p></li>

<li><p>Inability to improve his game. He&rsquo;s a classic case of having elite athleticism and elite instincts that got him through college, but when he got to the first pros and took his first proverbial &ldquo;punch to the face&rdquo; he did not take it very well. When he needed to dedicate time into improving weaknesses, developing strengths, etc., he just did not have the ability to do it. He&rsquo;s largely the same player today as he was back in 2018. Possibly even worse.</p></li>

<li><p>Entitlement attitude. This goes with the first two points, but when he hit adversity in the league, he never took ownership of it. Always seemed to blame everyone but himself. Expected minutes without earning it, and expected some big contract just by showing up. When coach stopped playing him, rather than look within to see what he needed to change, he played the victim.</p></li>

<li><p>Terrible support group. Noticing a pattern with the first 3 points? A lot of that can be attributed to his bad support group, specifically his dad. Classic &ldquo;snowplow parent&rdquo; who shielded his son from any adversity and fuels, or created the victim mentality and entitlement attitude. His parents moved to Sacramento with Marvin, and Marvin lived at home with them for the first few years of his career, so I know they had a huge influence on him. I wasn&rsquo;t surprised to find out that his dad was also his coach growing up, so a lot of Marvin&rsquo;s defensive deficiencies could probably have been honed in his youth, but his Dad/coach didn&rsquo;t see a need to develop that aspect of his game. In fact I bet he got little to no actual coaching growing up, which set him up for failure when he hit the big leagues. FWIW, Marvin is not the only son whose future was ruined by his dad. There was a younger Bagley kid who had some NBA interest while playing at Arizona State. He ran into a little bit of adversity and of course his dad steered him into the transfer portal at the first sign of a bump in the road and I never heard from him again.</p></li>

<li><p>Horrific defensive instincts. Even all the previous points wouldn&rsquo;t have tanked his career if the guy could just play some defense. Marvin is a good rebounder, hustles, a good finisher, and has great off ball instincts. Even if he never developed anything past his rookie year he could have been a good NBA player if he could just play passable defense. Unfortunately his defense is among the worst I have ever seen. He gave effort, and wasn&rsquo;t terrible on-ball, but his awareness was absolutely horrible, which you can&rsquo;t have as a big man. This was his Achilles heel, and because of the 4 above points, he wasn&rsquo;t able to address it, which ultimately made him unplayable. This is where I blame his dad most of all (besides Marvin himself). As Marvin&rsquo;s coach growing up, he had the opportunity to help Marvin address this weakness, but instead opted to shield him from it until it was too late.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>While other comments have mentioned that non-stretch bigs that don&rsquo;t play defense is a bad prototype, Marvin absolutely had the talent to be an Amare Stoudemire 2.0, but he just didn&rsquo;t have the mentality to survive once he got to an area where innate talent wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>

      <label for="lchf6o5" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s an excellent write up, but everything that you wrote boils down to the one overarching aspect that struck me back then when I listened to a pre-draft interview with him: he&rsquo;s a dummy. You might say that&rsquo;s oversimplifying it, but my first reaction was that of a surprise. He was the first prospect where I ever thought &ldquo;damn, this guy really shouldn&rsquo;t be getting drafted&rdquo; while looking at him talking and listening to him. Playing against inferior athletic players in HS and college he had an edge, but at the highest level of anything, you need a solid head on your shoulders.</p>

<p>I was following this draft closely and wrote this when SL was starting post-draft 6 years ago:</p>

<p>*What upside? How many doofus superstars can you name?</p>

<p>Marvin Bagley&rsquo;s IQ doesn&rsquo;t even scratch the average. The first time I heard him speak I thought he&rsquo;d be perfect for the Kings. Turns out it truly was a match made in heaven. If he works his butt off and burns into his brain the basic things a smart player gets automatically, he can be a serviceable big on an average team. Ultimately I wouldn&rsquo;t be too hard on the guy for having the ambition to be a top pick. It&rsquo;s not his fault a group of monkeys drafted him to join their circus.*</p>

<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8wglif/just_a_friendly_reminder_that_struggles_in_summer/e1we22j/" target="_blank">https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8wglif/just_a_friendly_reminder_that_struggles_in_summer/e1we22j/</a></p>

<p>There is a close correlation between intelligence and excellence in team sports. Similarly, there is a a strong correlation between intelligence and the ability to defend well at the NBA level. To boot, he&rsquo;d been told his whole life that he&rsquo;s exceptional and that builds an overconfidence that simple minds have a hard time dealing with. To make a successful jump to the NBA, you&rsquo;ve got to be smart. Marvin Bagley sure doesn&rsquo;t seem like he is.</p>

      <label for="lcdxahc" class="commentText"><p>Moving up the ladder in sports really weeds out the people who dominate the game based off their size and athleticism. Those two things alone can get your very far, but, eventually, you gotta learn the game. A lot of guys get to that point and just become apathetic towards improving because they&rsquo;ve never had to. They&rsquo;ve just been dominating off their size/athleticism, so when they reach a level where everyone is as big and athletic, the holes in their game get exposed. Same goes for highly skilled dudes who don&rsquo;t have the size/athleticism to match. JJ Reddick was one of the best college players ever, but he struggled when he got to the NBA because suddenly everyone is 6&rsquo;8&rdquo; and athletic as fuck. JJ still had a great career, but he had to work hard for it. I would bet you Bagley could have a great career as well if he put in the work, but that&rsquo;s hard and a lot of these guys don&rsquo;t have it in them.</p>

<p>Which honestly makes it all the more insane that a guy like Ayton can sleep walk into averaging 16 and 10</p>

<p>Dude legitimately has the touch and talent to be a David Robinson. But he never had to learn anything beside a jab step jumper, a right hook and a surprisingly effective turn around fadeaway. Those 3 moves got him drafted 1st overall and a max contract. (+ playing with Rubio and cp3 2 of the better pnr passers of their time)</p>

<p>But those same moves + no handles, no post moves and mediocre defense and ball iq won’t take him to the next level as a legitimate all star or even all nba caliber.</p>

      <label for="lceokrz" class="commentText"><p>He’s actually regressed statistically, largely on defense. He doesn’t go for enough blocks, idk if he’s worried about foul trouble, doesn’t have the verticality, or just doesn’t have the ball mind to be able to anticipate.</p>

<p>Rubio gave him a career high scoring season since Rubio couldn’t score for himself and leaned on Ayton a ton in the pnr</p>

<p>The lack of anticipation and bball iq would make sense because it extends to the rest of his game whether it’s setting screens, running a pnr, or defending a pnr. Beyond that he’s uncoordinated, despite being a relatively fluid mover for his size.</p>

<p>Pretty much Ayton is the exact same player as he was at U of A</p>

      <label for="lcdra00" class="commentText"><p>Funny as it sounds, it seems that the scouts did not consider that he doesn&rsquo;t really play basketball well. He&rsquo;s one of many players that are just not good at reading what is going on in the play and reacting to it, and his high skill at doing one thing at once is far from enough to even it up in real NBA games. NBA teams benefit from having a center that can react to the play and just is smart rather than just jumps high (maybe not the &ldquo;eyetest&rdquo;, but the game results strongly suggest so). And next to a traditional center as a forward, Bagley as a poor dribbler, passer, screener and shooter was not very useful on offense either. His &ldquo;great rebounding&rdquo; at youth levels also seems to have turned out to be a result of physical advantage rather than some knack for understanding the play and grabbing any surprising rebounds.</p>

<p>Weird injuries possibly did not help, some of them were phrased in a way that was hard to understand why he&rsquo;s missing so much time. Could be the reason why a player touted as very determined did not develop the skills everyone was sure he&rsquo;d develop over time. But the nature of his injuries brought many to question whether Bagley is determined to play in NBA games at all. The loss of &ldquo;athleticism&rdquo; also meant that Bagley stopped being good even at the one thing he does, getting the ball, going left and scoring.</p>

      <label for="lceq5dy" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not saying <em>no</em> players developed, but they were once in a blue moon like Fox.</p>

<p>Also, Haliburton was drafted after McNair took over, so it doesn&rsquo;t really apply.</p>

      <label for="lcervmc" class="commentText"><p>I mean, McNair wasn’t developing these guys. The coaches were, which at that time was Luke Walton.</p>

<p>My point is that player selection isn’t to blame for Kings draft picks not working out. They were just bad players and would have been bad anywhere.</p>

      <label for="lcesomu" class="commentText"><p>No no, I realize what happened. I&rsquo;ve mentioned that McNair cleaned house (minus Walton and his staff for one year) in other comments. I got my wires crossed and thought I included that here. Essentially, things started turning around when Vlade got fired, so that&rsquo;s the line of demarcation for a lot of us between Old Kings and New Kings. That&rsquo;s why I mentioned it.</p>

<p>And sure I guess, but I think I&rsquo;ve just been influenced by so many &ldquo;Wow I can&rsquo;t believe XYZ player didn&rsquo;t turn into a star&rdquo; posts over the years that featured Kings players. Like Ben McLemore, for example, who we were excited &ldquo;fell&rdquo; to us. Which bolsters your point that they were probably bad to begin with.</p>

<p>I think there&rsquo;s also the numerous &ldquo;near misses&rdquo; where the players selected right after us turned out to be All-Stars or better. Sure, lots of other teams have those examples, but when we were in the middle of that playoff drought, a lot of us focused in on our history of bad drafting as a reason we were in the morass.</p>

      <label for="lce6fyr" class="commentText"><p>To add on to everything else being said, I think Bagley would’ve had a nice career in a different era. Over the past ten years, having a non-shooting big who isn’t a rim protector is not a recipe for success. Someone like Zion is an interesting test case for that reason, but he is also a 1 of 1 athlete and finisher.</p>

<p>Having Bagley out there either means playing two non-shooting bigs in the same lineup or finding one of those rare few like Brook Lopez who can be your primary run protector while also stretching the floor. There just aren’t a ton of guys who fit well.</p>

      <label for="lcfjoh0" class="commentText"><p>There&rsquo;s tons of bigs in the earlier years of the NBA who fit this profile. Like, Wayman Tisdale, Antoine Carr, etc. Players with size who could score a bit but weren&rsquo;t great defenders or very mobile. Players like that just don&rsquo;t fit with the way the game is played nowadays at the highest level.</p>

<p>I think the canary in the coal mine was Greg Munroe. Nice burly PF who could put up 17-10 and had a bit of a post game and midrange jumper. Got off to a solid start to his career but was basically unplayable after about year 5, not because of any deterioration in his health or talent, but just because he was unlucky enough to start his career shortly before the time when players like him went the way of the dinosaur.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine how a former NBA center whose number one skill was probably basketball IQ could have been so bad at evaluating talent.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d already been through this with Jah Okafor, and yet the James Wisemans (and even Aytons) of the world are still fooling people.</p>

      <label for="lcdv58o" class="commentText"><p>No joke. His double jump isn&rsquo;t as effective when he is going against guys taller, longer and stronger guys. One of the most impressive things about Bagley is he reclassified. I thought it was a big deal until he was drafted by the kings and I noticed he is a year older than Zion who he was originally listed as better than. He reclassify into his own age group and it was a big deal for some reason.</p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t a coincidence every team he joins love him at first and then realized he just has two moves and doesn&rsquo;t do anything outside of his meme double jump. His best stats come his first year with a new team.</p>

      <label for="lcenglw" class="commentText"><p>Bagley is basically a basketball mirage. He looks like a really good NBA player from a distance, but if you look closely, his skills don’t add up to an NBA player.</p>

<p>Specifically, he’s good at a lot of things, but not NBA caliber at many things. He’s big, but not big enough to play 5. He’s a good ball handler, but not good enough to handle the ball in most situations. He has shown promise as a shooter, but he‘s not good enough to space the floor.</p>

<p>His basketball IQ is also terrible, which makes him bad at everything you need to contribute to winning basketball (playmaking and defense most notably).</p>

<p>He could NOT shoot with his right hand.  Period.  Not even if he was 2 feet from the basket.</p>

<p>He sucked on defense.  It didn’t exactly seem like he wasn’t trying but he had no defensive fundamentals.  Doug Christie (while he was a broadcaster) broke it down once on a play where Steve Freaking Adams blew past him.  He just simply had rotten defensive skills.</p>

<p>3pt shot didn’t really translate.  This limited his value if he wasn’t standing by the basket.</p>

<p>And lastly, he had trouble staying healthy.  Even if he’d hit a decent stretch, some random injury would occur and… oh no, we suck again!</p>

<p>He came in with an attitude (and dad) thinking the league owed him.  He wasn’t good enough for that.</p>

      <label for="lcerck0" class="commentText"><p>Entitlement is an issue. Similar to Ayton, he stopped improving. I also think he failed to adapt to the idea of not being the best player on his team.</p>

<p>I watched him more with Washington this year. He still has skills. He gets counting stats with ease when he is trying.  But net negative defender and spend offensive possessions waiting for his turn. He does not help other players get buckets. He does not work hard despite being a bench player on a horrible team.</p>

      <label for="lcgfk7l" class="commentText"><p>Great point around him not helping others get buckets and just waiting his turn. As a Wiz fan, I&rsquo;ve been able to see lots of Gafford and a good chunk of Bagley. Gafford never ever stops moving. His motor is great and he&rsquo;s constantly looking and observing to court to see where he&rsquo;s needed. Bagley will happily run the play, but there is no dynamics, no observing and adapting. Pretty easy to see the impact Gafford&rsquo;s style had on the Mavs ability to lift the team&rsquo;s floor.</p>

      <label for="lcekjxv" class="commentText"><p>Because they are looking at a player and thinking “what if he continues to improve at his current pace”</p>

<p>It speaks to the amount of talent Bagley had to basically have been an NBA player at 18</p>
