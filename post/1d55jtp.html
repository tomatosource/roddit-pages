</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>So I (34f) am a surrogate for my BIL Simon (39m) and his wife Michelle (38f). Simon and Michelle have struggled with infertility for years. They’ve tried IVF and even surrogacy before, but the person changed her mind at the last second.</p>

<p>They have outwardly shown their jealousy of my husband James (34m) and me for having children, especially as only one of them was planned, and our oldest was born when we were sixteen.</p>

<p>They came to me last year and begged me to be their surrogate. I had doubts, as did my husband, but I felt bad for them and decided to go through with it. James supported my decision and has acted like he did with my previous pregnancies, sweet and caring.</p>

<p>Simon and Michelle, on the other hand, are very controlling. They made up meal plans for me, and I’m taking all these supplements as well as attending multiple classes. When I told them I knew what to do during pregnancy, they didn’t listen and said to me that just because I was pregnant four times doesn’t mean I’m an expert. I gave up trying to dissuade them as I knew nothing would work.</p>

<p>We started going over the birth plan earlier this week, and it caused a huge argument. They wanted me to do an unmedicated water birth, and I flat out refused. For my second pregnancy, I didn’t have enough time for any pain relief, and the pain was horrific. I have quite a high pain tolerance, but this experience was awful, and I never wanted to do that again. (Kudos to anyone who has unmedicated births) As for the water birth, I don’t like the idea of being submerged in water with blood, other fluids and possibly poop.</p>

<p>They weren’t happy about this. They said this was their baby and they should decide how they were born. I retorted and said, this is my body, and I should decide how I want to push out a human that I’m so generously carrying for them. A lot of shouting happened, and I started to get overwhelmed very quickly. I started crying, and Michelle rolled her eyes and told me to grow up. James told her to shut up, which started Simon off, and it was just a mess.</p>

<p>James and I left the house, and I was crying the whole way home and regretting ever agreeing to be their surrogate. It took James and me a few days to calm down, and during those days, we didn’t have any contact with Simon or Michelle.</p>

<p>Simon and Michelle called James’ parents and complained to them about what happened, so they called us, and we explained our side of the story. They were shocked at what happened and said they were fully on our side and that they’d talk with Simon and Michelle.</p>

<p>I’m due in two weeks, and I’m so nervous. A part of me doesn’t want them there, but I know they have to be, seeing as it’s their child. James disagrees. He said that he&rsquo;ll have them kicked out if they do anything to upset or stress me out. Even my oldest agrees with him, and he won’t even be in the room.</p>

<p>I sort of do feel like an asshole but I don’t know. It’s a hard time right now</p>

      <label for="l6jdrfi" class="commentText"><p>OP and partner should speak with the nurses right up front and warn them/express their wishes. If they want to physically be in the room and it is okay with OP, then they need to do so with their lips zipped. No wonder the last surrogate backed out. If they pulled half this crap with them as they are with OP, no sane person would give them a helpless infant to take care of.</p>

<p>They DO NOT get to dictate OPs needs during a major medical event. Period. Full stop. Whatever OP needs/wants and if supported by their medical team, OP gets. Period.</p>

<p>They both need some serious therapy. Their infertility issues have cause them to lose all common sense and decency. Not to mention the absolute gall to tell OP they know nothing about pregnancy/childbirth&hellip;sorry, but the person who has children absolutely does know about pregnancy and childbirth. They are absolute lunatics and I feel sorry for that kid.</p>

But yes if there ever is a need for a C-section being in the hospital is the best place to be.</p>

      <label for="l6jpm10" class="commentText"><p>Exactly. I’m concerned about the hypercontrolling attitude when there is a child involved.</p>

<p>I am an RN who just left a job as an OB/GYN clinic RN.  One of my biggest issues there was the obnoxious “geriatric primips” (women who are having their first baby at age 35 up).  They tended to be hypercontrolling nervous nellies who knew EVERYTHING bc they “read about it on Google!” and couldn’t be taught anything. This makes it one step worse—infertile couple, late 30s, first kid—and using surrogacy to boot. I feel so sorry for you, OP.</p>

<p>Having been an RN in L and D, I LOVED being the bad guy and keeping troublemakers out. Don’t be afraid to lay your concerns out to labor staff and then let them help. I know they will be happy to. You don’t deserve abuse when you are doing this beautiful thing for them—even if it means you do it without them.</p>

They have ZERO rights to tell you to do <em>anything</em> with your body. You are being awfully nice to do supplements and whatever other stupid shit they want. I would not. They are entirely out of line to tell you how to birth this baby - they’re being entitled, ungrateful assholes asking for stupid shit like that. Have your HUSBAND tell them they drop it now, never mention it again! And to have zero attitude except gratitude around you or the next time they hear ANYTHING about their baby will be when the hospital calls them to say he was born the day before, you’ve gone home so it’s time for them to come fetch their kid - that only exists because you are the most generous person they have ever met! Seriously!! They get one more chance to be involved then FUCK THEM. </p>

      <label for="l6jlnip" class="commentText"><p>Her gall, the woman who has never been pregnant telling a mom of FOUR that she’s not an “expert “. Well neither is she. If she was the one giving birth it’s absolutely her right to develop the birth plan. But that type of “home birth “ still carries alot of risks. I would send her some information about infant maternity mortality rates, and all of the various life-threatening medical complications that can turn an unmedicated (or medicated) vaginal birth into an emergency c-section. An emergency surgery that isn’t possible at home, and which would delay care to mother and baby as those present try to get out of kiddie pool/tub and to the hospital. You know your body, and what you can endure and they should be reminded to be grateful because I’m assuming you aren’t charging them surrogacy fees. I do kind feel worried for the baby with such arrogant parents. Let’s hope they wake up real quick and don’t assume that all the books they’ve read are going to just magically make them know what to do in every moment. It doesn’t work like that. Every child’s different. Good luck. Good vibes.</p>

      <label for="l6jv985" class="commentText"><p>A thousand times this. The birth of a child is not a spectator event, it is a <em>medical procedure.</em> Everything that happens from pregnancy through birth is up to you, and you alone.</p>

<p>They asked you to be a surrogate precisely because of your previous successful pregnancies, they should trust you to conduct your pregnancy and birth as you see fit, and if they don&rsquo;t, they should not have asked you.</p>

<p>Go low contact - send them a text or something similar once a day to let them know you and baby are fine (or have someone else do it) - until after the birth. Then let them know they can come pick up their baby.</p>

<p>The baby you are carrying is their child - you yourself do not belong to them and your decisions are your own.</p>

Get a lawyer. Seriously, I work know a surrogate and they routinely have 50+ page contracts for this exact reason.</p>

<p>I would probably hit up a family lawyerr before that baby comes out.</p>

<p>Couldn&rsquo;t possibly pay me enough to do this without a lawyer involved.
Never mind the financial Cost- because  god forbid something goes south they are absolutely gonna finger point.</p>

And you will technically be the one responsible for that child. I wish I could say these people don&rsquo;t seem like that type, but..</p>

<p>You need a lawyer and a contract even at this stage, even with two weeks left. This all needs to be hashed out and in writing. These people seem like absolutely lunatics, I would be upset to hand them a baby expecting them to raise it well to be quite honest, but it is what it is.</p>

      <label for="l6jur34" class="commentText"><p>It took my husband and I ten years to have our daughter. There was a lot of fear, trauma, and stress around the pregnancy and birth.</p>

<p>These AHs resent her for having an easier time with fertility, and they resent that they need her to have a child. They&rsquo;re being controlling, and verbally abusing her. Causing her stress raises her blood pressure, which affects circulation to the baby. Also, the baby can hear them yelling at her. So by treating her so badly they&rsquo;re also abusing their child.</p>

<p>It would be worth the $300 to consult an attorney that specializes in surrogacy, just to understand what, if any, legal obligations you have and what, if any, rights they have.  More than likely, they have absolutely no say about the pregnancy and birth, whatsoever.</p>

<p>Once you have confirmed the legal boundaries with your attorney, determine what your own boundaries are by balancing your self interests with your desire to accommodate them.  Once you have determined your boundaries, put them in writing and enforce them consistently and unequivalently.</p>

Or worse, you don&rsquo;t want something, and they force it on you to save the baby?

If not, I&rsquo;d go complete no contact, have them black listed at the hospital, and not call them until a couple hours before discharge to get the baby. At that point, I&rsquo;d have your husband get the car seat and an outfit from them, and he can pass the baby off to them. I wouldn&rsquo;t even see these terrible people again</p>

They do NOT need to be in the room or part of your birth plan.
As soon as the baby is born and you are in recovery they can come and get their baby.

<p>OP don&rsquo;t feel bad, they very likely didn&rsquo;t feel bad when they decided you should suffer during child birth to make their wishes true. Do what you know and are comfortable doing. You are providing them a huge and generous gift and they need to be willing to work with you. If they aren&rsquo;t, then don&rsquo;t feel bad about not working with them.</p>

My midwife told me <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> of her patients poop at some point because when baby’s head passes through your pelvis, your intestines get flattened and anything in there is coming out. She did tell me they never say anything unless the patient asks.</p>

<p>For the record, I pooped during both of my births and I knew I had. They didn’t say anything but I knew!</p>

I know it’s their baby, but YOU are the one giving birth and it sounds like they are going to make it infinitely more stressful for you and that’s dangerous both for you and the baby. I would wait and tell them when the baby is born or about to be born so they have no opportunity to get in the way and cause issues. It sounds like they can’t be trusted to wait outside, and you want the focus of everyone to be on you and baby, and not keeping them away. You need to put yourself first for this to ensure a safe delivery.</p>

If I were your husband, I would not let them anywhere near you while you’re in labor. They fucked that up for themselves. Big time.</p>

<p>You are the pregnant person. It’s your body. They don’t have any right to be telling you what to eat, what vitamins to take, or how you will give birth. They can suggest. They can ask. But the second they get pushy and in your fucking face is the time to go no contact until the baby is born and if they don’t like it, too bad, they can just shut the fuck up, AND BE GRATEFUL. I’m just furious for you. I’m sorry.</p>

<p>Have your husband be the point of contact for these last two weeks. And if they won’t stop, I wouldn’t even tell them you’re in labor until the baby is almost ready to be born.</p>

<p>Tell them it happened too fast because your body knows what it’s doing. And you barely had time to get to the hospital. Oops there it is. This is a fucking nightmare in the delivery room waiting to happen.</p>

      <label for="l6k1hbo" class="commentText"><p>I can’t fathom treating anyone this way after they sacrificed their body for nearly a year in order for me to have a child.</p>

<p>What you’re doing for them is such an immensely selfless gift, and they’re repaying that selflessness by asking you for even more. I’m so sorry things have turned out this way, OP. It’s appalling.</p>

<p>I hope you take the advice elsewhere in this thread and meet with an attorney as soon as you can.</p>

<p>Wow. Just wow. Your BIL and his wife are bad people. I don&rsquo;t care what your previous opinion of them has been, you now know what they&rsquo;re really like.</p>

<p>This should permanently change how you relate to and see them. It should permanently change your relationship for the worse. You&rsquo;re really learning who they actually are right now.</p>

Yes, it could/should have been ironed out earlier, but it’s too late now, and you were operating from a standpoint that they would be reasonable, which you are now learning they are not. This is on them, for being idiots, and frankly, they know nothing about a baby, or childbirth, and yes, having had four pregnancies DOES make you an “expert” about how your body handles it and what you want/don’t want. Ignore the stupidity and focus on what you need to do to get through the next month or so, because I’m guessing there will be post birth demands for breastmilk and who knows what else. Also, consider counseling for yourself, because giving up the baby to two lunatics will affect you somewhat, and you need as much support as possible.</p>

Perhaps that could be mentioned to them. However, you are not only giving them the most unselfish and beautiful gift a person could give you are a human being. They’re treating you like a robot getting frustrated that they can’t program you.</p>

<p>My advice is to have your husband contact them. Tell them exactly how YOUR birth plan will go. The most important part is the baby is going to feel everything you are feeling and if they are so hell bent on wanting the birth to be healthy as they see it then they need to not stress you and their baby out.</p>

<p>I honestly feel bad for the future of this child. I hope they will see the child as its own person and not try to control every aspect of their lives.</p>

<p>Sorry you are going through this.</p>

<p>They don’t need to be in the delivery room with you. That’s your choice. The only thing you have to do is give them the baby after you give birth. So you need to think about your comfort since you are going to be the one giving birth to their baby.</p>

      <label for="l6jj7ir" class="commentText"><p>Agree! Adoptive parent here. Didn&rsquo;t get to see my daughter being born. Didn&rsquo;t even know she had been born, actually, because we got a call about her two days after she was born. Guess how much not seeing her be born affected our lives? Surprise! NOT AT ALL. Even worse: DD&rsquo;s birth mom used alcohol and drugs throughout her pregnancy. And I REALLY had no control over that-again, didn&rsquo;t wven know I was going to have a daughter until 2 days after her birth. And I survived that and so did my daughter! These people do not have to be in the room when the baby is born and it will absolutely not be the worst thing in the world to happen to them. You know what would be the worst? If they didn&rsquo;t learn in a hurry how to not be the most entitled people in the room, especially now that they are (almost) parents. They will 100% survive not seeing the baby being born. And your delivery will probably be a thousand percent less stressful if they aren&rsquo;t there. </p>

<p>It is their child, but it is you giving birth.  They have a right to be there the moment the baby is out and out of the room where your medical procedure is taking place.  Anything more than that is a privilege that you are graciously granting them.</p>

<p>I would really try to realize your health and comfort come first as it is important to you and the baby, then make it clear to them.  Hopefully this will shock them back to reality where they appreciate the wonderful gift you are giving them.</p>

      <label for="l6jc52n" class="commentText"><p>1- your body, you’re growing the child, you decide how to birth it. No ifs, ands, or buts. Do NOT let them bully you into submitting to their wants
2- they do NOT have to be in the room. Again, this is YOUR medical event, they can collect the baby afterwards
3- I want to reiterate, DO NOT do anything that makes you uncomfortable. I’m so glad to hear your husband is being your advocate.</p>

<p>I would make a clear plan with your husband of you hard limits during birth, so it’s his responsibility during birth to make sure your boundaries are maintained.</p>

      <label for="l6jgs7d" class="commentText"><p>I once read a Dear Abby where the letter writer was distraught because her sister, who was acting as a surrogate for the LW and husband, had informed her that she didn&rsquo;t want spectators in the delivery room. She wanted to see her baby born, and her sister was depriving her of that!</p>

<p>Abby&rsquo;s response was to accept this situation gracefully, as the sister was giving her a magnificent gift. Then she said those last moments of them together in the room alone are where the sister says goodbye to that child as a mother, and becomes an aunt. It was actually quite touching.</p>

<p>Even if you only wanted your husband there you&rsquo;re NTA. You do NOT owe it to them as the parents to see the birth.  I believe it, and even Abby does too. (I&rsquo;m a very different person from Dear Abby - I&rsquo;m actually one of those liberals MAGAs are warning you about.)</p>

<p>GEE, I WONDER WHY? She probably couldn&rsquo;t deal with them and couldn&rsquo;t imagine giving a kid to them.</p>

<p>I have absolutely no idea why you agreed to be a surrogate in the first place, but my advice is to shut down contact with these a-holes and DO NOT notify them when you go into labor. The very last thing you need is to have them stressing you out in the last few weeks before you give birth. Don&rsquo;t let them anywhere near you.  They absolutely should NOT be allowed in the delivery room. Also, do not agree to pump breast milk for them. They can buy it from a regular distribution source. You should take the pills that will end lactation. Otherwise, these people will be telling you what to eat for the next 8 months.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad you have a supportive husband. You&rsquo;re almost there, and you guys can go back to your life again.</p>

<p>Learn from this. NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED.</p>

And if you have difficulty with labor because of stress, their baby could be harmed.</p>

<p>Do what is best for you and the baby. Talk to your doctor and the KSRstaff now, so they can play the bad guy for the sake of future relationships .</p>

<p>If women can kick their husbands out of the delivery room for being assholes then you are in full right to ban your brother in law(!) and SIL from being there. They have no &ldquo;god given right&rdquo; to be there just because it is their dna you are passing on for them.</p>

<p>YOUR COMFORT is most important here, you have gone above and beyond for a couple of spectators who don&rsquo;t seem to have any concerns for your wellbeing during birth.</p>

<p>NTAH - do not give in. You have put your life and health at risk for them while receiving little respect or thanks in exchange. Prioritizee yourself for once.</p>

<p>They have zero right to be in the room when you give birth unless you want them there. They have zero rights to make the birth plan for your body. Literally they have zero rights until after the child is born…and then their rights only extend to the baby. Never and not ever to your body.</p>

<p>You’re doing them a HUGE favor. Like literally the biggest favor. They need to sit down, shut up, and be grateful that you were willing to spend 40 weeks pregnant for them.</p>
