</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Here‚Äôs mine - it starts off in 2020 when I played 2k21 with Darius bazley . I was just chilling in a park and he joined . Thought it was cool as anyone would . About a year later I was at a card shop getting some cards for my collection and I found 2  of his cards for cheap . Bought them and mailed one to him which he didn‚Äôt send back since I forgot to include a stamp and envelope . Started becoming a bigger fan that season often following his stats / buying more of his cards . For Christmas 2022 got tickets vs okc and was gonna see and hopefully meet him and Shai , he got traded to the suns . I was mad asf and shed a tear . Once we got to the game the only dude warming up was the guy he got traded forüò¢  continued collecting him like normal . Was on a trip to cincinatit and they had miles Mcbride throw out the opening pitch at a red game ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è was mad since they mentioned a nba player whi was on the thunder for a bit , met Mcbride he was cool . Fast forward to December . After getting cut by the nets he signed with the Delaware blue coats who just so happened to have a game in my city the following week , went to the game walked in saw him warming up , called him over to sign  my stuff and  take  a photo  / talk with him , same thing the month after , hoping he ends up on the raptors</p>

He used to play for 20 different rec teams and some in the same leagues. He was definitely kinda average back then. I never thought for a second he was gonna turn out to be who he was.</p>

I asked him for an autograph, but he declined but was extremely rude about it. I was in HS at the time, and I could tell his entourage was a little embarrassed by his behavior. When I got home, I threw his shoes away and have never rooted for him since.</p>

      <label for="lldlfjn" class="commentText"><p>I saw Steve Blake at a grocery store in Los Angeles about 7 or 8 years ago. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn‚Äôt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.</p>
