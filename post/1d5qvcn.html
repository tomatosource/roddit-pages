      <label for="l6nab0x" class="commentText"><p>I know this comment will come off in a bad way because I&rsquo;m a Bucks fan and it sounds like sour grapes when Bucks fans critique Jrue. But Jrue is my guy, all love to him, he&rsquo;s a terrific defender.</p>

<p>That said, it&rsquo;s kinda wild to say Rudy can&rsquo;t be dpoy because he gets ISOd and scored on in the playoffs. Then turn around and say Jrue should win it, when Jrue got torched by Brown and Tatum in 2022 and got lit up by Jimmy Butler in 2023. Hell even in his wonderful 2021 run, it wasn&rsquo;t like he was locking up/the main defender on Kevin Durant in the Nets series.</p>

<p>There is not a single player in the league who can lock up literally anyone 1v1 in the league for an entire playoff series. The game is too offensively focused for that.</p>

      <label for="l6nhgma" class="commentText"><p>Seriously how did he convince everyone that all the utah wing defenders suck? Mitchell sometimes doesnt try fair enough. Conley is (or was) a premier point guard defender. Bojan is a good defender that gets no love because he is white and unathletic (did a GREAT job on Bron in 2018). Royce Oneal was on the team just to play defense. Ingles is not a terrible defender. Somehow the Gobert crew has convinced everyone that that team was filled with absolutely shit defenders and only he could save the day (except when it came to guarding Terrence Mann, but I mean jrue got scored on by Jayson Tatum so Terrence mann scoring 40 on him is the exact same thing and I JUST rewatched the game yesterday and almost all of his points were on gobert in the man to man not the zone in 2nd half)</p>

<p>usually the best you can do against the best is to make them work. maybe it’s fair to say that Rudy didn’t really make either Kyrie or Luka work, but if anyone was expecting his presence to fully stop them, then they’re just fooling themselves</p>

And unlike Rudy AND Jokic…AD is tasked with being the 1/1A offensive player and the #1 defensive player on his team. Neither Jokic and especially no Rudy are asked to carry the load on both ends. That’s even if you want to argue AD isn’t as great as either of them on either side of the court.</p>

<p>I said if we could draft across the whole NBA, I&rsquo;d pick AD first. Because ostensibly I&rsquo;d get to build a different team around him than the current Lakers. </p>

<p>In the same way as the argument you made that AD wouldn&rsquo;t succeed on the Nuggets, I&rsquo;m not sure Jokic would be what he is on the Lakers with LeBron being ball dominant and lacking Gordon as a lob threat. </p>

<p>AD is worse offensively than Jokic but better defensively. This balance may be useful to me when drafting 5 for a pickup game. </p>

<p>Because Jrue has a lot of clutch defensive playoff plays, particularly on that title run, he is always going to be viewed as a tier-1 defensive player. Ditto Draymond, or prime Kawhi, or AD, and many of the more switchable defenders in history who get clutch steals and blocks in playoff games.</p>

<p>Rudy Gobert is a great rim deterrer, but no one is making a highlight tape on defensive rim deterrence.  And he becomes close to unplayable offensively against some playoff teams because he is sooo clumsy with the ball in his hands.</p>

<p>He is the antithesis to what most NBA players view as a true baller &ndash; great at being the lynchpin of a system that carries you through a regular season, but exploited when targeted with dedicated time against one opponent, and low on other additional skills that can provide winning value through a playoff series.</p>

      <label for="l6nnvlp" class="commentText"><p>I wish I could upvote you more than once, I think you nailed it. Also, DPoY is a regular season award but we, as fans, are usually having these debates during or immediately following the playoffs so we’ve got the recency bias of what happens in the biggest moments of the most important games while the voters are being asked to ignore all that and just look at the regular season. Rudy Gobert was the best defender on the best defense in the NBA during the regular season. Rudy Gobert also has a very specific set of limitations that smart coaches and players can exploit over the course of a full playoff series that vastly reduce his defensive impact. Two things can be true at once.</p>

Giannis did well, but you obv dont want him on him all game and Khris did surprisingly well too. PJ got torched but made him work and was an ‘innings eater’. It wasnt a coincidence how dead tired kd was at the end of that one.</p>

<p>Jrue is very good against specific guards but regularly gets cooked by guys bigger than him (jimmy) or smaller/quicker than him (trae).</p>

Now, does the fact that this happens to Rudy Gobert every. damn. time. in the playoffs mean voters should maybe start taking that into account? Again, it is supposed to be a regular season award! But I don’t think I’d be able to give him my vote with a clean conscious.</p>

It is like you want him to stop every attack.
Not many teams can take away the Luka or Kyrie lob to a quality rim running big.</p>

Jimmy Butler averages like 35ppg on dumb good efficiency against Jrue and its like &ldquo;what is he suppossed to do&rdquo;, AD gets hunted on a switch by Jamal Murray (who is way worse than Luka btw) to hit a game winner and no one says hes getting exposed defensively and that he cant win DPOY. Its just a lot of double standards.</p>

<p>Is Gobert flawless? Absolutely not, does he deserve criticism specially for his series against the Mavs? Of course he does. But if hes so bad, why is it that the Wolves had one of the best defenses since the 08 Celtics and were able to win 2 playoff rounds against 2 high power offenses. If it was so easy, why didnt KD or Booker or Murray kill Gobert in our series&rsquo;.</p>

      <label for="l6nppnt" class="commentText"><p>To be fair the only ones saying AD should be dpoty was Laker fans, he came in like 4th in the voting or some shit.</p>

<p>But also, you&rsquo;re talking about two shots over a player off a switch versus being hunted multiple times over the course of multiple games. Over the course of the series the shooting against AD was poorer by everybody except those last few shots of the games. Whereas in the previous series everyone was talking about the defense of KAT on Jokic, not Gobert, so it isn&rsquo;t really an outlier with Gobert not being the defensive guy in a series.</p>

<p>The main point I have is it&rsquo;s stupid to talk about dpoty based on something that happened after the season. I hate judgment through hindsight, it doesn&rsquo;t help anything. If your best argument against someone winning a regular season award is something that happened after the season then your argument is worthless. Gobert deserved it, move on everybody.</p>

      <label for="l6nh0bm" class="commentText"><p>Here y’all go wanting to protect Rudy and acting like any criticism of him holds no merit. Let’s be honest and say that Rudy has won DPOY by default since his closest competitors are Giannis and Brook Lopez who they are hesitant to give it to since they’re on the same team. No one else has had a real argument besides Wemby and they refused to give it to a rookie.</p>

<p>That’s the truth of the matter</p>

<p>No one says he’s trash but the voters are biased towards him because he has no real competition for DPOY.</p>

<p>Either way best thing is that voters will move away from him next year and start to give it to more deserving players since he has real competition in Wemby/Chet now.</p>

<p>r/NBA: They’re just haters who don’t know ball, Rudy is an all-timer. Here’s an obscure stat that proves</p>

<p>I will say up until this Mavs series, I bought into it and was willing to believe that he truly just didn’t have the best supporting cast in Utah. But really, what other DPOY gets hunted on switches and played off the floor in the playoffs? He certainly wasn’t the reason they lost the series, but he certainly wasn’t a big enough factor to help them win.</p>

<p>So while they were winning you were believing it but as soon as they lost you stopped lol</p>

<p>They lost cause KAT and Ant were bad for a big part of the series and Gobert is a non factor on offensive and people don&rsquo;t pay attention to him.</p>

      <label for="l6nmeah" class="commentText"><p>This playoffs it wasn’t too blatant, but considering his contract and his accolades you’d want more from him.</p>

<p>And yeah, when they won against teams he matched up well with, he looked great. Then he got outplayed by a rookie and a journeyman center.🤷‍♂️</p>

<p>I also agree, he wasn’t the reason they lost. He played decently. But he needed to play better imo to justify what the Wolves gave up for him and how much they’re paying him. Otherwise, why not find a cheaper shot blocker and spend that excess money on filling other needs/extending young stars?</p>

<p>It is a regular season award, I’ll give you that. Still seems dumb to me that a guy who is significantly worse in the playoffs than many of his peers has won that many awards though. Bam, Giannis, Dray (not this year), AD are all superior defenders that should be considered over him given that they are comparable in the regular season and maintain or elevate their game in the playoffs.</p>

Expectation from a second string of team at best is way too high. Before gobert i would look at edwards for his performance against dallas instead. Nobody gonna stop a healthy luka, nobody would stop a healthy jordan,kobe,lebron,kd,curry. Its not possible. And i know this as a fan that got torched by youngin lebron with one of the best defensive teams in history. If you really want to focus on goberts negatives you should be more focused on not being able to block lob play of gafford and lively. Which in fact he managed to do vs aaron gordon in just a series before.</p>

      <label for="l6npcux" class="commentText"><p>I feel like the discussion around Rudy is just too absolute in both directions.</p>

<p>He is a GENERATIONAL rim protector and that aspect of him as a player is heavily underrated at this point. He is a free ticket to a top 5 defense.</p>

<p>On the flip side of the token, EVERY. SINGLE. YEAR. He gets taken out to the perimeter in the playoffs and gets absolutely torched. You can argue it’s a scheme thing and his team shouldn’t be forcing him to switch in those situations, but if you are the “defender of a generation” in modern NBA basketball, you need to defend the perimeter at MINIMUM at a serviceable level.</p>

<p>I think when you combine this with the fact that he is on a max deal and is completely inept on offense (that turnaround on Jokic was the fakest shot in NBA history), you can understand the criticism of Rudy.</p>

Rudy has his strengths but he can’t guards small quick n small guards.
Look at AD. Murray was killing AD. No one said a word. You can’t expect big Centers to guard these guards. It’s unfair. As Dallas, ofc you wannu attack the big with 2 of the best iso guys. BUT in the future, if teams pick on you in playoffs, then you have NO chance at DPOY!!! Ain’t no one gonnu pick on Dray/ AD / Bam / Jrue* / wenby /</p>

I don’t think Rudy should have won 4 defensive player of the year awards but just regurgitating what others are saying is worthless… plus who thinks herb jones is a defensive player of the year guy. I think Giannis is pretty much the ideal defensive player of the year.</p>
