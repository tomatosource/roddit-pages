      <label for="l6nab0x" class="commentText"><p>I know this comment will come off in a bad way because I&rsquo;m a Bucks fan and it sounds like sour grapes when Bucks fans critique Jrue. But Jrue is my guy, all love to him, he&rsquo;s a terrific defender.</p>

<p>That said, it&rsquo;s kinda wild to say Rudy can&rsquo;t be dpoy because he gets ISOd and scored on in the playoffs. Then turn around and say Jrue should win it, when Jrue got torched by Brown and Tatum in 2022 and got lit up by Jimmy Butler in 2023. Hell even in his wonderful 2021 run, it wasn&rsquo;t like he was locking up/the main defender on Kevin Durant in the Nets series.</p>

<p>There is not a single player in the league who can lock up literally anyone 1v1 in the league for an entire playoff series. The game is too offensively focused for that.</p>

<p>Bam giving up everything defensively to Jokic and Gordon throughout last years finals</p>

It’s a product of the system, and I agree, it’s deserved. I will say Smart and the Cs got torched by Curry because they decided to play their own drop vs the best shooter of all time - a terrible decision that was never going to end well.</p>

      <label for="l6nxejs" class="commentText"><p>I think there’s a bit of rose tinted glasses for Rudy this year though since he actually held up ok in a lot of games this post season. In the past though he was borderline unplayable every year in the post season. That’s what spawned a lot of the criticism for him imo. It’s obviously he worked on improving defending the perimeter in the offseason though which was cool to see. Now maybe this year he can work on his hands and be able to actually catch lobs 😂</p>

Yeah call out AD and Bam for not being as good as Gobert when they don&rsquo;t even have the fraction of recognition and defensive accolades. Almost like we should hold the 4x dpoy more accountable than the 0x ones. Shocking right?</p>

<p>usually the best you can do against the best is to make them work. maybe it’s fair to say that Rudy didn’t really make either Kyrie or Luka work, but if anyone was expecting his presence to fully stop them, then they’re just fooling themselves</p>

And unlike Rudy AND Jokic…AD is tasked with being the 1/1A offensive player and the #1 defensive player on his team. Neither Jokic and especially no Rudy are asked to carry the load on both ends. That’s even if you want to argue AD isn’t as great as either of them on either side of the court.</p>

<p>I said if we could draft across the whole NBA, I&rsquo;d pick AD first. Because ostensibly I&rsquo;d get to build a different team around him than the current Lakers. </p>

<p>In the same way as the argument you made that AD wouldn&rsquo;t succeed on the Nuggets, I&rsquo;m not sure Jokic would be what he is on the Lakers with LeBron being ball dominant and lacking Gordon as a lob threat. </p>

<p>AD is worse offensively than Jokic but better defensively. This balance may be useful to me when drafting 5 for a pickup game. </p>

      <label for="l6nie7i" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s the halo effect. Hoops players just view dudes with rings differently.</p>

<p>Because Jrue has a lot of clutch defensive playoff plays, particularly on that title run, he is always going to be viewed as a tier-1 defensive player. Ditto Draymond, or prime Kawhi, or AD, and many of the more switchable defenders in history who get clutch steals and blocks in playoff games.</p>

<p>Rudy Gobert is a great rim deterrer, but no one is making a highlight tape on defensive rim deterrence.  And he becomes close to unplayable offensively against some playoff teams because he is sooo clumsy with the ball in his hands.</p>

<p>He is the antithesis to what most NBA players view as a true baller &ndash; great at being the lynchpin of a system that carries you through a regular season, but exploited when targeted with dedicated time against one opponent, and low on other additional skills that can provide winning value through a playoff series.</p>

Also, DPoY is a regular season award but we, as fans, are usually having these debates during or immediately following the playoffs so we’ve got the recency bias of what happens in the biggest moments of the most important games while the voters are being asked to ignore all that and just look at the regular season. Rudy Gobert was the best defender on the best defense in the NBA during the regular season. Rudy Gobert also has a very specific set of limitations that smart coaches and players can exploit over the course of a full playoff series that vastly reduce his defensive impact. Two things can be true at once.</p>

<p>Gobert had a great contest on that Luka shot. If Jrue had that contest, he wouldn&rsquo;t get clowned the same way. Everyone would talk about how insane Luka is.</p>

      <label for="l6ny8o7" class="commentText"><p>The Celtics intentionally use Jrue to guard the 5 in defensive sets all the time this season, so honestly in your example Jrue is probably the better defender. That being said, rim protection is always going to be more valuable than point of attack defense in a vacuum and that’s why you see Rudy and even guys like Brook Lopez last(?) season getting DPOY hype.</p>

Giannis did well, but you obv dont want him on him all game and Khris did surprisingly well too. PJ got torched but made him work and was an ‘innings eater’. It wasnt a coincidence how dead tired kd was at the end of that one.</p>

<p>Jrue is very good against specific guards but regularly gets cooked by guys bigger than him (jimmy) or smaller/quicker than him (trae).</p>

      <label for="l6negv7" class="commentText"><p>Its fair to criticize Rudy for having bad/awful defensive moments and games. Whats dumb is that players/media turn a blind eye when it happens to someone else. Jimmy Butler averages like 35ppg on dumb good efficiency against Jrue and its like &ldquo;what is he suppossed to do&rdquo;, AD gets hunted on a switch by Jamal Murray (who is way worse than Luka btw) to hit a game winner and no one says hes getting exposed defensively and that he cant win DPOY. Its just a lot of double standards.</p>

<p>Is Gobert flawless? Absolutely not, does he deserve criticism specially for his series against the Mavs? Of course he does. But if hes so bad, why is it that the Wolves had one of the best defenses since the 08 Celtics and were able to win 2 playoff rounds against 2 high power offenses. If it was so easy, why didnt KD or Booker or Murray kill Gobert in our series&rsquo;.</p>

Throw in a supermax contract for him, and of course tons of players think he is overpaid and overrated.</p>

      <label for="l6nppnt" class="commentText"><p>To be fair the only ones saying AD should be dpoty was Laker fans, he came in like 4th in the voting or some shit.</p>

<p>But also, you&rsquo;re talking about two shots over a player off a switch versus being hunted multiple times over the course of multiple games. Over the course of the series the shooting against AD was poorer by everybody except those last few shots of the games. Whereas in the previous series everyone was talking about the defense of KAT on Jokic, not Gobert, so it isn&rsquo;t really an outlier with Gobert not being the defensive guy in a series.</p>

<p>The main point I have is it&rsquo;s stupid to talk about dpoty based on something that happened after the season. I hate judgment through hindsight, it doesn&rsquo;t help anything. If your best argument against someone winning a regular season award is something that happened after the season then your argument is worthless. Gobert deserved it, move on everybody.</p>

      <label for="l6ny1qq" class="commentText"><p>Gobert is hated bc of a lot of factors - his personality, his offense, his nationality (in my opinion). But I do think switchability is a very critical modern defensive skill and AD and Giannis are quicker footed and better at switching out into the perimeter than Rudy and that is a knock against his defense. That drop scheme Utah and Minnesota played is a requirement to maximize Rudy and it has some flaws.</p>

Also said he has no business being in the dpoty race ever again. All this while saying Rudy gets criticized too much so he doesn&rsquo;t seem like a hater. This is what he&rsquo;ll say publicly.

NBA discourse has been so dumbed down only reactionary hot takes.
People clowning Gobert and AD for Luka and Murray hitting a shot on them is some next level bullshit.</p>

      <label for="l6nh0bm" class="commentText"><p>Here y’all go wanting to protect Rudy and acting like any criticism of him holds no merit. Let’s be honest and say that Rudy has won DPOY by default since his closest competitors are Giannis and Brook Lopez who they are hesitant to give it to since they’re on the same team. No one else has had a real argument besides Wemby and they refused to give it to a rookie.</p>

<p>That’s the truth of the matter</p>

<p>No one says he’s trash but the voters are biased towards him because he has no real competition for DPOY.</p>

<p>Either way best thing is that voters will move away from him next year and start to give it to more deserving players since he has real competition in Wemby/Chet now.</p>

I never see Clint Capela on an island guarding Luka nor do I see Steven Adams on an island guarding Kyrie. It doesn’t happen.</p>

<p>AD has just been able to play enough games to qualify. Same with Embiid.</p>

Wolves literally won all the Gobert minutes handily versus the Mavs.  They lost horrendously without him on the floor, Mavs had a league-leading offensive rating when he&rsquo;s on the bench.  I don&rsquo;t get what other metric matters than how many points the other team is scoring when you&rsquo;re out there.  So much cherry picking and hating when it comes to Gobert.</p>

      <label for="l6npcux" class="commentText"><p>I feel like the discussion around Rudy is just too absolute in both directions.</p>

<p>He is a GENERATIONAL rim protector and that aspect of him as a player is heavily underrated at this point. He is a free ticket to a top 5 defense.</p>

<p>On the flip side of the token, EVERY. SINGLE. YEAR. He gets taken out to the perimeter in the playoffs and gets absolutely torched. You can argue it’s a scheme thing and his team shouldn’t be forcing him to switch in those situations, but if you are the “defender of a generation” in modern NBA basketball, you need to defend the perimeter at MINIMUM at a serviceable level.</p>

<p>I think when you combine this with the fact that he is on a max deal and is completely inept on offense (that turnaround on Jokic was the fakest shot in NBA history), you can understand the criticism of Rudy.</p>

<p>I will say up until this Mavs series, I bought into it and was willing to believe that he truly just didn’t have the best supporting cast in Utah. But really, what other DPOY gets hunted on switches and played off the floor in the playoffs? He certainly wasn’t the reason they lost the series, but he certainly wasn’t a big enough factor to help them win.</p>

      <label for="l6nkbe3" class="commentText"><p>When was he played of the floor these playoffs, people say some absolutely wild stuff.</p>

<p>So while they were winning you were believing it but as soon as they lost you stopped lol</p>

<p>They lost cause KAT and Ant were bad for a big part of the series and Gobert is a non factor on offensive and people don&rsquo;t pay attention to him.</p>

<p>What does this have to do with a reg season award ?</p>

      <label for="l6nmeah" class="commentText"><p>This playoffs it wasn’t too blatant, but considering his contract and his accolades you’d want more from him.</p>

<p>And yeah, when they won against teams he matched up well with, he looked great. Then he got outplayed by a rookie and a journeyman center.🤷‍♂️</p>

<p>I also agree, he wasn’t the reason they lost. He played decently. But he needed to play better imo to justify what the Wolves gave up for him and how much they’re paying him. Otherwise, why not find a cheaper shot blocker and spend that excess money on filling other needs/extending young stars?</p>

<p>It is a regular season award, I’ll give you that. Still seems dumb to me that a guy who is significantly worse in the playoffs than many of his peers has won that many awards though. Bam, Giannis, Dray (not this year), AD are all superior defenders that should be considered over him given that they are comparable in the regular season and maintain or elevate their game in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Defense is not only shot blocking.
They had the best defense in the regular season.
As for getting 50 mill and being horrible on offense true, but what this has to do with DPOY.</p>

      <label for="l6npqwh" class="commentText"><p>Rudy is a top 20-25 range player in nba which gets outclassed by top5 player in league, figures. Expectation from a second string of team at best is way too high. Before gobert i would look at edwards for his performance against dallas instead. Nobody gonna stop a healthy luka, nobody would stop a healthy jordan,kobe,lebron,kd,curry. Its not possible. And i know this as a fan that got torched by youngin lebron with one of the best defensive teams in history. If you really want to focus on goberts negatives you should be more focused on not being able to block lob play of gafford and lively. Which in fact he managed to do vs aaron gordon in just a series before.</p>

How many tough jumpers did they hit over McDaniels/Ant/NAW/Anderson? Just because he’s not a lockdown guard defender at 7 foot plus doesn’t mean he’s not the best rim protector in the league and the key to our defense.

Rudy has his strengths but he can’t guards small quick n small guards.
Look at AD. Murray was killing AD. No one said a word. You can’t expect big Centers to guard these guards. It’s unfair. As Dallas, ofc you wannu attack the big with 2 of the best iso guys. BUT in the future, if teams pick on you in playoffs, then you have NO chance at DPOY!!! Ain’t no one gonnu pick on Dray/ AD / Bam / Jrue* / wenby /</p>

A lot of the problems rudy has in terms of “switching” you can say the same for majority of the 5s. I think alot of it stems from rudy being overpaid ( like I said before that’s not his fault). Rudy protects the paint, he does his job extremely well. Rudy deserves criticism for not adding anything to his offensive game in 10 years . People blaming Rudy is wack and repetitive because at this point we know what he is as a player.Timberwolves got outplayed and out coached this series.  Awards are watered down, they haven’t meant much to me sense drose got mvp over bron and then Marc got dpoty over him.</p>

      <label for="l6nxg3p" class="commentText"><p>Can we get a possession count?</p>

<p>Some of y’all in here are talking about how defensive minded guards/wings still get torched by elite offensive players, but when they’re guarding them for an entire game vs a few possessions here and there for Rudy… of course the numbers will skew negatively against them.</p>

<p>Similar to what Josh said towards the end of the clip, “If you ask him to do that for a season[switch onto wings], no, I don’t think he’ll get <em>A</em> defensive team.”</p>

<p>The game is now played outside-in now. Wing/guard defenders should be placed higher in terms of DPOY voting as well as all-defensive teams because on a nightly basis they are asked to do much more.</p>

<p>Duncan, who&rsquo;s perennial all defensive 1st team, consistently got torched by Kobe, any time he was on an island.</p>

<p>We are being unfair to Rudy because he&rsquo;s a traditional defensive big, and any traditional defensive big, outside of Olajuwon, would he torched.</p>

      <label for="l6nyoxv" class="commentText"><p>I think its interesting how players and fans have radically different opinions about things like this. Neither are strictly wrong, but it does seem kinda weird that as&hellip; casual basketball watchers (lets be real most redditors are casual) that they&rsquo;re trying to make the argument that players are flat out wrong for feeling how they feel regarding things they have to do.</p>

<p>I think JB and Hart are right in that Rudy does get too much hate, and that its an impossible task to do things like guarding Luka/Kyrie for an entire series.</p>

<p>However on the flip side the game of basketball has evolved to the point that I don&rsquo;t think DPOY should be JUST the best defensive big on the best defensive team. I think someone in that lane can and should win in future years, but it has to actually be the conversation of &ldquo;Is his impact in this aspect of defense enough to outweigh players that may not be as paint dominant, but can shut down entire possessions regardless of who gets switched on him&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know If this is a factor but Gobert not being an NBA-caliber <strong><em>offensive</em></strong> player doesn&rsquo;t help. Not talking about setting screens.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m talking about him not being vertical threat, bumbling passes in traffic, being unable to punish small defenders no matter how deep in the post he is, disastrous footwork in the post, turning the ball over in the post.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s a great help defender but not 1-on-1 like AD, Bam or Wemby, he protects the rim but he&rsquo;s 7&rsquo;3 so it&rsquo;s like doesn&rsquo;t get credit for it, when we see a lot of 7-foot guys in the league who can&rsquo;t protect the rim at all.</p>

<p><em>Some</em> of the Gobert criticism is unfair for sure but not a lot of it, there&rsquo;s a disconnect between his accolades and his high level-impact or lack thereof.</p>

The things that make him great in the regular season don’t work in the playoffs when there is a lot more matchup hunting. You don’t see AD or Bam or even Jrue getting played off the court in games and it seems to happen once every postseason to Gobert. 2. Players don’t like him. 🤷‍♀️</p>
