      <label for="l6nab0x" class="commentText"><p>I know this comment will come off in a bad way because I&rsquo;m a Bucks fan and it sounds like sour grapes when Bucks fans critique Jrue. But Jrue is my guy, all love to him, he&rsquo;s a terrific defender.</p>

<p>That said, it&rsquo;s kinda wild to say Rudy can&rsquo;t be dpoy because he gets ISOd and scored on in the playoffs. Then turn around and say Jrue should win it, when Jrue got torched by Brown and Tatum in 2022 and got lit up by Jimmy Butler in 2023. Hell even in his wonderful 2021 run, it wasn&rsquo;t like he was locking up/the main defender on Kevin Durant in the Nets series.</p>

<p>There is not a single player in the league who can lock up literally anyone 1v1 in the league for an entire playoff series. The game is too offensively focused for that.</p>

It’s a product of the system, and I agree, it’s deserved. I will say Smart and the Cs got torched by Curry because they decided to play their own drop vs the best shooter of all time - a terrible decision that was never going to end well.</p>

<p>usually the best you can do against the best is to make them work. maybe it’s fair to say that Rudy didn’t really make either Kyrie or Luka work, but if anyone was expecting his presence to fully stop them, then they’re just fooling themselves</p>

      <label for="l6nie7i" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s the halo effect. Hoops players just view dudes with rings differently.</p>

<p>Because Jrue has a lot of clutch defensive playoff plays, particularly on that title run, he is always going to be viewed as a tier-1 defensive player. Ditto Draymond, or prime Kawhi, or AD, and many of the more switchable defenders in history who get clutch steals and blocks in playoff games.</p>

<p>Rudy Gobert is a great rim deterrer, but no one is making a highlight tape on defensive rim deterrence.  And he becomes close to unplayable offensively against some playoff teams because he is sooo clumsy with the ball in his hands.</p>

<p>He is the antithesis to what most NBA players view as a true baller &ndash; great at being the lynchpin of a system that carries you through a regular season, but exploited when targeted with dedicated time against one opponent, and low on other additional skills that can provide winning value through a playoff series.</p>

Also, DPoY is a regular season award but we, as fans, are usually having these debates during or immediately following the playoffs so we’ve got the recency bias of what happens in the biggest moments of the most important games while the voters are being asked to ignore all that and just look at the regular season. Rudy Gobert was the best defender on the best defense in the NBA during the regular season. Rudy Gobert also has a very specific set of limitations that smart coaches and players can exploit over the course of a full playoff series that vastly reduce his defensive impact. Two things can be true at once.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>With Gobert on the court, the Mavs scored 109 pts per 100 possessions, which would have been 28th in the league in the regular season. Say what you want about offense, but the Mavs didn&rsquo;t win by exploiting Gobert&rsquo;s defense.</p>

      <label for="l6o04js" class="commentText"><p>Really well said.  As a Warriors fan, I appreciate the duality you highlighted.  Draymond is absolutely more clutch, less exploitable (excluding his temper), more versatile, more systemic, better offensively, more intelligent, etc. He even coined the &ldquo;16 game player&rdquo; term.  I&rsquo;ll take Draymond every time.  I&rsquo;m completely biased.</p>

<p>But we didn&rsquo;t make the playoffs.  The rest of the season matters.  That&rsquo;s what those awards are for.  Can&rsquo;t be clutch if you can&rsquo;t get to clutch.</p>

<p>It assumes that basketball players can&rsquo;t view the game with objectivity as opposed to&hellip;. media members? Are you kidding me lmao.</p>

<p>There are plenty of valid critiques to Rudy and him winning DPOY. It reasonably could have gone to other players. Dismissing said critique as &ldquo;its just hooper logic&rdquo; is a lil silly my dude. Rudy is a generational defensive talent imo, but we&rsquo;re in a league currently where there are arguably 5 all time defensive players. Its alright. And FWIW Jrue was getting props ages before he&rsquo;d ever won a ring.</p>

And unlike Rudy AND Jokic…AD is tasked with being the 1/1A offensive player and the #1 defensive player on his team. Neither Jokic and especially no Rudy are asked to carry the load on both ends. That’s even if you want to argue AD isn’t as great as either of them on either side of the court.</p>

      <label for="l6o1wtt" class="commentText"><p>By far. Simmons could literally guard anyone on the floor COMPETENTLY on any given night. I’d go so far as to say that if he had zero offensive skill (despite his shooting he was an ELITE facilitator, floor general, and fast break leader) it would be reasonable to slot him on the other teams best offensive player every night, regardless of position.</p>

<p>Gobert vs Luka</p>

<p>Jrue vs Jokic</p>

<p>Jrue vs Embiid</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not fair to clown Gobert when you would clown Jrue when Embiid jizzes all over his face when he backs him down and dunks on him.</p>

<p>Gobert had a great contest on that Luka shot. If Jrue had that contest, he wouldn&rsquo;t get clowned the same way. Everyone would talk about how insane Luka is.</p>

      <label for="l6ob1ua" class="commentText"><p>Team defense is much more important than individual defense. No one is consistently stopping stars 1on1, that&rsquo;s why no team is really playing just 1on1 defense, there&rsquo;s always some strategies involved and players help, double, stay in certain part of the court,&hellip;</p>

<p>So everyone has a role on defense and while some players are more versatile, no one can really do everything. Gobert is probably the best player playing his role (rim protection), but it&rsquo;s hard to say, if that&rsquo;s the most important part. I think it depends on what the team needs and wants.</p>

Giannis did well, but you obv dont want him on him all game and Khris did surprisingly well too. PJ got torched but made him work and was an ‘innings eater’. It wasnt a coincidence how dead tired kd was at the end of that one.</p>

<p>Jrue is very good against specific guards but regularly gets cooked by guys bigger than him (jimmy) or smaller/quicker than him (trae).</p>

      <label for="l6odcfu" class="commentText"><p>I agree, but I think an interesting point to be made is the question of is there more value to the kind of contribution rudy gives, or the kind of contribution jrue gives.</p>

<p>I think you can&rsquo;t scheme jrue out of a game. You can put him in situations he&rsquo;s going to struggle in, but even when he&rsquo;s getting lit up by jimmy or Jayson, I think we&rsquo;re all in agreement that it&rsquo;s a great-offense-beats-great-defense situation. I really think jrue is the best on-ball defender in basketball, but theres about 6 to 8 guys in the NBA who can beat jrue on any given possession bc that&rsquo;s how the modern NBA is.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you totally can scheme rudy out of a game. Pull him out to the wing (or really get him in any motion) and he&rsquo;s in trouble. But I think rudy is really the only player in basketball who can pull off a great-defense-BEATS-great-offense series. Imo there&rsquo;s 0 guys who can reliably beat rudy down low, but theres about 15 teams who can get him outside the paint and make that not matter.</p>

      <label for="l6negv7" class="commentText"><p>Its fair to criticize Rudy for having bad/awful defensive moments and games. Whats dumb is that players/media turn a blind eye when it happens to someone else. Jimmy Butler averages like 35ppg on dumb good efficiency against Jrue and its like &ldquo;what is he suppossed to do&rdquo;, AD gets hunted on a switch by Jamal Murray (who is way worse than Luka btw) to hit a game winner and no one says hes getting exposed defensively and that he cant win DPOY. Its just a lot of double standards.</p>

<p>Is Gobert flawless? Absolutely not, does he deserve criticism specially for his series against the Mavs? Of course he does. But if hes so bad, why is it that the Wolves had one of the best defenses since the 08 Celtics and were able to win 2 playoff rounds against 2 high power offenses. If it was so easy, why didnt KD or Booker or Murray kill Gobert in our series&rsquo;.</p>

<p>OBA had some elements of AAU but it’s a lot closer to how people describe European style youth teams. More practices than games, same team each year etc. now, things change when you get to <sup>17</sup>&frasl;<sub>18</sub> a bit but not at as a kid</p>

The COVID microphone thing didn&rsquo;t shut down the league. It was dumb af but Gobert will always get the blame from idiots. He isn&rsquo;t a scorer. That gets zero respect from this generation of players.</p>

<p>On the flip side, Ben Simmons could go on any podcast or hang with any NBA player that has clout. Why? Because he&rsquo;s popular. Sure, players probably clown him. But to his face or on video? Hell nah. Josh Hart has zero fear going on a podcast and dissing the hell out of Gobert though.</p>

      <label for="l6o6ew2" class="commentText"><p>Yea, like when watching Hart talk about Rudy in this vid, you could tell he was trying to be as careful as he could with his words to avoid just completely vomiting out his true feelings on Rudy. I feel the most honest thing he would say was the &ldquo;idiot&rdquo; remark and then held back as much as he could. Like you said, I imagine the moment the camera stops rolling, Hart &amp; Matt would take turns completely shitting on Gobert</p>

      <label for="l6nuntx" class="commentText"><p>Entire NBA playerbase just piles on &ndash; it&rsquo;s become a huge tribal circlejerk against him.  Wolves literally won all the Gobert minutes handily versus the Mavs.  They lost horrendously without him on the floor, Mavs had a league-leading offensive rating when he&rsquo;s on the bench.  I don&rsquo;t get what other metric matters than how many points the other team is scoring when you&rsquo;re out there.  So much cherry picking and hating when it comes to Gobert.</p>

<p>Jaden got cooked, Kyle got cooked, Ant got cooked, Luka gonna cook everyone.
NBA discourse has been so dumbed down only reactionary hot takes.
People clowning Gobert and AD for Luka and Murray hitting a shot on them is some next level bullshit.</p>

      <label for="l6o2llh" class="commentText"><p>I think the point they got at but didn’t state explicitly is that they value switchability a lot in defense. Guys like Jrue and OG can guard 1-<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> while Gobert can’t.</p>

<p>While Gobert is an elite defender, I think players don’t “feel” it as much because they want him to switch on to the small guards. Nobody wants Jrue Holiday to guard them so he seems better than he is. That and the bad matchups he gets can be written off as “oh they were 7ft you can’t expect him to guard that” but for some reason that doesn’t extend to bigs guarding small guys.</p>

      <label for="l6odyy2" class="commentText"><p>Gobert absolutely does defend 1-5, he just does it differently than a Jrue or an OG.  He&rsquo;s not clamping them up on the perimeter, but his presence on the court makes driving to the hoop a much worse option. Defense is more than just one on one matchups.</p>

<p>Jrue and OG can guard 1-5, but if you put them in the low post against a big with his back to the basket with no help, they&rsquo;re getting a pair of nuts in their face every time.</p>

      <label for="l6npcux" class="commentText"><p>I feel like the discussion around Rudy is just too absolute in both directions.</p>

<p>He is a GENERATIONAL rim protector and that aspect of him as a player is heavily underrated at this point. He is a free ticket to a top 5 defense.</p>

<p>On the flip side of the token, EVERY. SINGLE. YEAR. He gets taken out to the perimeter in the playoffs and gets absolutely torched. You can argue it’s a scheme thing and his team shouldn’t be forcing him to switch in those situations, but if you are the “defender of a generation” in modern NBA basketball, you need to defend the perimeter at MINIMUM at a serviceable level.</p>

<p>I think when you combine this with the fact that he is on a max deal and is completely inept on offense (that turnaround on Jokic was the fakest shot in NBA history), you can understand the criticism of Rudy.</p>

Denver literally hunted him all series, a non Allstar hit two game winners in his face and he got swept in the postseason. So, by your logic, he’s overrated as a defender.</p>

A lot of the problems rudy has in terms of “switching” you can say the same for majority of the 5s. I think alot of it stems from rudy being overpaid ( like I said before that’s not his fault). Rudy protects the paint, he does his job extremely well. Rudy deserves criticism for not adding anything to his offensive game in 10 years . People blaming Rudy is wack and repetitive because at this point we know what he is as a player.Timberwolves got outplayed and out coached this series.  Awards are watered down, they haven’t meant much to me sense drose got mvp over bron and then Marc got dpoty over him.</p>

<p>I will say up until this Mavs series, I bought into it and was willing to believe that he truly just didn’t have the best supporting cast in Utah. But really, what other DPOY gets hunted on switches and played off the floor in the playoffs? He certainly wasn’t the reason they lost the series, but he certainly wasn’t a big enough factor to help them win.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>With Gobert on the floor, Mavs scored 109 pts per 100 possessions, which would be the 28th ranked offense in the reg season. Their offensive efficiency was absolutely terrible against Gobert. The only Twolves player with a positive +/- for the series was Gobert. Is that getting &ldquo;played off the floor&rdquo;?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know If this is a factor but Gobert not being an NBA-caliber <strong><em>offensive</em></strong> player doesn&rsquo;t help. Not talking about setting screens.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m talking about him not being vertical threat, bumbling passes in traffic, being unable to punish small defenders no matter how deep in the post he is, disastrous footwork in the post, turning the ball over in the post.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s a great help defender but not 1-on-1 like AD, Bam or Wemby, he protects the rim but he&rsquo;s 7&rsquo;3 so it&rsquo;s like doesn&rsquo;t get credit for it, when we see a lot of 7-foot guys in the league who can&rsquo;t protect the rim at all.</p>

<p><em>Some</em> of the Gobert criticism is unfair for sure but not a lot of it, there&rsquo;s a disconnect between his accolades and his high level-impact or lack thereof.</p>

Look at AD. Murray was killing AD. No one said a word. You can’t expect big Centers to guard these guards. It’s unfair. As Dallas, ofc you wannu attack the big with 2 of the best iso guys. BUT in the future, if teams pick on you in playoffs, then you have NO chance at DPOY!!! Ain’t no one gonnu pick on Dray/ AD / Bam / Jrue* / wenby /</p>

      <label for="l6nyoxv" class="commentText"><p>I think its interesting how players and fans have radically different opinions about things like this. Neither are strictly wrong, but it does seem kinda weird that as&hellip; casual basketball watchers (lets be real most redditors are casual) that they&rsquo;re trying to make the argument that players are flat out wrong for feeling how they feel regarding things they have to do.</p>

<p>I think JB and Hart are right in that Rudy does get too much hate, and that its an impossible task to do things like guarding Luka/Kyrie for an entire series.</p>

<p>However on the flip side the game of basketball has evolved to the point that I don&rsquo;t think DPOY should be JUST the best defensive big on the best defensive team. I think someone in that lane can and should win in future years, but it has to actually be the conversation of &ldquo;Is his impact in this aspect of defense enough to outweigh players that may not be as paint dominant, but can shut down entire possessions regardless of who gets switched on him&rdquo;.</p>

      <label for="l6o2xka" class="commentText"><p>The host makes so terrible points but I do agree on one thing he said. As the nba is evolving for more small ball and switch heavy defenses, the DPOY should go to the guy who can guard perimeter possessions AND protect the paint. Someone like AD, Bam, Giannis, future Wemby. Although Rudy is a better paint defender, the other guys versatility outweigh his impact most of the time.</p>

      <label for="l6nrz95" class="commentText"><p>It seems to me that there are two issues with Gobert: 1. The things that make him great in the regular season don’t work in the playoffs when there is a lot more matchup hunting. You don’t see AD or Bam or even Jrue getting played off the court in games and it seems to happen once every postseason to Gobert. 2. Players don’t like him. 🤷‍♀️</p>

      <label for="l6nxg3p" class="commentText"><p>Can we get a possession count?</p>

<p>Some of y’all in here are talking about how defensive minded guards/wings still get torched by elite offensive players, but when they’re guarding them for an entire game vs a few possessions here and there for Rudy… of course the numbers will skew negatively against them.</p>

<p>Similar to what Josh said towards the end of the clip, “If you ask him to do that for a season[switch onto wings], no, I don’t think he’ll get <em>A</em> defensive team.”</p>

<p>The game is now played outside-in now. Wing/guard defenders should be placed higher in terms of DPOY voting as well as all-defensive teams because on a nightly basis they are asked to do much more.</p>

He is a huge liability on offense and he&rsquo;s extremely slow shuffling his feet and getting back up the court to help in transition defense. He does some stuff well, but fans get frustrated with him on the court when he has flabby hands, small weak strides, and plays with almost no physicality/heart on defense (rebounding, <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> balls).</p>

      <label for="l6oaxyb" class="commentText"><p>I’m convinced Gobert just looks funky, uncoordinated, and lost at times which leads to people thinking he sucks. It’s the nba, Offense rules. Every great defender can be made to look silly. Gobert is just so much more of a focal point and looks so goofy at times. That being said, I do question his skills myself. Is he better defensively than say Bam or AD. The advanced stats say it’s clear. I won’t allow myself to think my brain knows better than data.</p>

<p>Couldn’t we blame scheme and the initial defender in every scenario too? In the nba the guards often refuse to fight over a screen . This forces the big man to switch and they guard will always have an advantage. That’s most of the times when gobert is getting cooked on the outside.</p>

      <label for="l6obalt" class="commentText"><p>Luka would have also put Dikembe Mutombo on skates, and Ben Wallace too.</p>

<p>does that mean they shouldn&rsquo;t be 4x DPOYs?  Or is judging an elite interior defender on their ability to guard someone 30 feet from the basket maybe a little silly?</p>

      <label for="l6oe4b0" class="commentText"><p>Gobert is an incredible player and an even more incredible defender.</p>

<p>He put up an DPOY performance this year. I think that VW should have got it, but Gobert was certainly a worthy candidate.</p>

<p>And when you look at the difference with him on/off (something like giving up 100 vs. 130), it&rsquo;s huge, even if he&rsquo;s getting lit on the perimeter by Kyrie and Luka because EVERYBODY gets lit up on the perimeter by Kyrie and Luka.</p>

<p>I think part of the issue is that KAT seemed to play Joker better on defence. That takes a lot of steam out of your DPOY when you are the center and your power forward is covering the other guy&rsquo;s center, who is the best player on the team.</p>

<p>But it seemed like the reason for that was more so to allow Gobert to focus on being a rim protector because, if he&rsquo;s covering Jokic and Jokic makes one of his HOF passed to a guy cutting, NOBODY is there to block that can and defend the basket. But when KAT is on Jokic, Gobert and protect the rim.</p>

<p>But that switch up likely looked bad to casual fans.</p>

<p>Still.. VW just put up such amazing personal stats, and the only thing holding him back from getting DPOY was the fact that his team was so shit.</p>

      <label for="l6oiryh" class="commentText"><p>Bad takes. Rudy getting put in a headlock causes you to dislike Rudy? He was trying to break up a fight and Draymond blindside&rsquo;s him. How are you gonna clown someone for getting out in a headlock and not mention the guy putting him in a headlock.  </p>

<p>If you watched all the wolves games you see how Rudy affects the game and guides each defensive play.  It&rsquo;s not an iso defender award because basketball is a team game.  It can&rsquo;t be a fluke if the guy has won it 4 times. </p>
