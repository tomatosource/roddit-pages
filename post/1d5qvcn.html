      <label for="l6nab0x" class="commentText"><p>I know this comment will come off in a bad way because I&rsquo;m a Bucks fan and it sounds like sour grapes when Bucks fans critique Jrue. But Jrue is my guy, all love to him, he&rsquo;s a terrific defender.</p>

<p>That said, it&rsquo;s kinda wild to say Rudy can&rsquo;t be dpoy because he gets ISOd and scored on in the playoffs. Then turn around and say Jrue should win it, when Jrue got torched by Brown and Tatum in 2022 and got lit up by Jimmy Butler in 2023. Hell even in his wonderful 2021 run, it wasn&rsquo;t like he was locking up/the main defender on Kevin Durant in the Nets series.</p>

<p>There is not a single player in the league who can lock up literally anyone 1v1 in the league for an entire playoff series. The game is too offensively focused for that.</p>

<p>AD getting embarrassed twice by Jamal Murray in end game  iso situations this year (identical situation to gobert.. but no one seems to blame AD here?)</p>

<p>Bam giving up everything defensively to Jokic and Gordon throughout last years finals</p>

It’s a product of the system, and I agree, it’s deserved. I will say Smart and the Cs got torched by Curry because they decided to play their own drop vs the best shooter of all time - a terrible decision that was never going to end well.</p>

<p>usually the best you can do against the best is to make them work. maybe it’s fair to say that Rudy didn’t really make either Kyrie or Luka work, but if anyone was expecting his presence to fully stop them, then they’re just fooling themselves</p>

      <label for="l6nie7i" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s the halo effect. Hoops players just view dudes with rings differently.</p>

<p>Because Jrue has a lot of clutch defensive playoff plays, particularly on that title run, he is always going to be viewed as a tier-1 defensive player. Ditto Draymond, or prime Kawhi, or AD, and many of the more switchable defenders in history who get clutch steals and blocks in playoff games.</p>

<p>Rudy Gobert is a great rim deterrer, but no one is making a highlight tape on defensive rim deterrence.  And he becomes close to unplayable offensively against some playoff teams because he is sooo clumsy with the ball in his hands.</p>

<p>He is the antithesis to what most NBA players view as a true baller &ndash; great at being the lynchpin of a system that carries you through a regular season, but exploited when targeted with dedicated time against one opponent, and low on other additional skills that can provide winning value through a playoff series.</p>

Also, DPoY is a regular season award but we, as fans, are usually having these debates during or immediately following the playoffs so we’ve got the recency bias of what happens in the biggest moments of the most important games while the voters are being asked to ignore all that and just look at the regular season. Rudy Gobert was the best defender on the best defense in the NBA during the regular season. Rudy Gobert also has a very specific set of limitations that smart coaches and players can exploit over the course of a full playoff series that vastly reduce his defensive impact. Two things can be true at once.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>With Gobert on the court, the Mavs scored 109 pts per 100 possessions, which would have been 28th in the league in the regular season. Say what you want about offense, but the Mavs didn&rsquo;t win by exploiting Gobert&rsquo;s defense.</p>

      <label for="l6o04js" class="commentText"><p>Really well said.  As a Warriors fan, I appreciate the duality you highlighted.  Draymond is absolutely more clutch, less exploitable (excluding his temper), more versatile, more systemic, better offensively, more intelligent, etc. He even coined the &ldquo;16 game player&rdquo; term.  I&rsquo;ll take Draymond every time.  I&rsquo;m completely biased.</p>

<p>But we didn&rsquo;t make the playoffs.  The rest of the season matters.  That&rsquo;s what those awards are for.  Can&rsquo;t be clutch if you can&rsquo;t get to clutch.</p>

<p>It assumes that basketball players can&rsquo;t view the game with objectivity as opposed to&hellip;. media members? Are you kidding me lmao.</p>

<p>There are plenty of valid critiques to Rudy and him winning DPOY. It reasonably could have gone to other players. Dismissing said critique as &ldquo;its just hooper logic&rdquo; is a lil silly my dude. Rudy is a generational defensive talent imo, but we&rsquo;re in a league currently where there are arguably 5 all time defensive players. Its alright. And FWIW Jrue was getting props ages before he&rsquo;d ever won a ring.</p>

And unlike Rudy AND Jokic…AD is tasked with being the 1/1A offensive player and the #1 defensive player on his team. Neither Jokic and especially no Rudy are asked to carry the load on both ends. That’s even if you want to argue AD isn’t as great as either of them on either side of the court.</p>

<p>Gobert vs Luka</p>

<p>Gobert vs Kyrie</p>

<p>Jrue vs Jokic</p>

<p>Jrue vs Embiid</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not fair to clown Gobert when you would clown Jrue when Embiid jizzes all over his face when he backs him down and dunks on him.</p>

<p>Gobert had a great contest on that Luka shot. If Jrue had that contest, he wouldn&rsquo;t get clowned the same way. Everyone would talk about how insane Luka is.</p>

      <label for="l6ob1ua" class="commentText"><p>Team defense is much more important than individual defense. No one is consistently stopping stars 1on1, that&rsquo;s why no team is really playing just 1on1 defense, there&rsquo;s always some strategies involved and players help, double, stay in certain part of the court,&hellip;</p>

<p>So everyone has a role on defense and while some players are more versatile, no one can really do everything. Gobert is probably the best player playing his role (rim protection), but it&rsquo;s hard to say, if that&rsquo;s the most important part. I think it depends on what the team needs and wants.</p>

<p>With that said, I prefer players like prime Dray to Gobert because not only Dray was a good rim protector but he was also one of the best perimeter defenders in the league.</p>

It was a few playoff series that generated the narrative. It was probably the Clippers series where they tried to put him on Terrance Mann and he scored 40 that started it.</p>

      <label for="l6negv7" class="commentText"><p>Its fair to criticize Rudy for having bad/awful defensive moments and games. Whats dumb is that players/media turn a blind eye when it happens to someone else. Jimmy Butler averages like 35ppg on dumb good efficiency against Jrue and its like &ldquo;what is he suppossed to do&rdquo;, AD gets hunted on a switch by Jamal Murray (who is way worse than Luka btw) to hit a game winner and no one says hes getting exposed defensively and that he cant win DPOY. Its just a lot of double standards.</p>

<p>Is Gobert flawless? Absolutely not, does he deserve criticism specially for his series against the Mavs? Of course he does. But if hes so bad, why is it that the Wolves had one of the best defenses since the 08 Celtics and were able to win 2 playoff rounds against 2 high power offenses. If it was so easy, why didnt KD or Booker or Murray kill Gobert in our series&rsquo;.</p>

The COVID microphone thing didn&rsquo;t shut down the league. It was dumb af but Gobert will always get the blame from idiots. He isn&rsquo;t a scorer. That gets zero respect from this generation of players.</p>

<p>On the flip side, Ben Simmons could go on any podcast or hang with any NBA player that has clout. Why? Because he&rsquo;s popular. Sure, players probably clown him. But to his face or on video? Hell nah. Josh Hart has zero fear going on a podcast and dissing the hell out of Gobert though.</p>

      <label for="l6n9os6" class="commentText"><p>Josh Hart clearly doesn&rsquo;t like Rudy. He called him an idiot and then clowned him for getting into a headlock. Also said he has no business being in the dpoty race ever again. All this while saying Rudy gets criticized too much so he doesn&rsquo;t seem like a hater. This is what he&rsquo;ll say publicly. I can&rsquo;t imagine what these guys say off the mic.</p>

<p>They describe him at Villanova, and it&rsquo;s very obviously the tone you have when you&rsquo;re trying to defend a close friend not being a good person because they are nice to you.</p>

I feel the most honest thing he would say was the &ldquo;idiot&rdquo; remark and then held back as much as he could. Like you said, I imagine the moment the camera stops rolling, Hart &amp; Matt would take turns completely shitting on Gobert</p>

Wolves literally won all the Gobert minutes handily versus the Mavs.  They lost horrendously without him on the floor, Mavs had a league-leading offensive rating when he&rsquo;s on the bench.  I don&rsquo;t get what other metric matters than how many points the other team is scoring when you&rsquo;re out there.  So much cherry picking and hating when it comes to Gobert.</p>

<p>Jaden got cooked, Kyle got cooked, Ant got cooked, Luka gonna cook everyone.
NBA discourse has been so dumbed down only reactionary hot takes.
People clowning Gobert and AD for Luka and Murray hitting a shot on them is some next level bullshit.</p>

Teams are not gameplanning and changing things specifically for 1 opponent for the vast majority of regular season games</p>

      <label for="l6o2llh" class="commentText"><p>I think the point they got at but didn’t state explicitly is that they value switchability a lot in defense. Guys like Jrue and OG can guard 1-<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> while Gobert can’t.</p>

<p>While Gobert is an elite defender, I think players don’t “feel” it as much because they want him to switch on to the small guards. Nobody wants Jrue Holiday to guard them so he seems better than he is. That and the bad matchups he gets can be written off as “oh they were 7ft you can’t expect him to guard that” but for some reason that doesn’t extend to bigs guarding small guys.</p>

      <label for="l6odyy2" class="commentText"><p>Gobert absolutely does defend 1-5, he just does it differently than a Jrue or an OG.  He&rsquo;s not clamping them up on the perimeter, but his presence on the court makes driving to the hoop a much worse option. Defense is more than just one on one matchups.</p>

<p>Jrue and OG can guard 1-5, but if you put them in the low post against a big with his back to the basket with no help, they&rsquo;re getting a pair of nuts in their face every time.</p>

I don’t think the same 1-on-1 stopping is valued in bigs, it’s more about being versatile it seems. So Bam, AD to an extent, Draymond etc will get love but I don’t see as much for Gobert or even Embiid from the players.</p>

How many tough jumpers did they hit over McDaniels/Ant/NAW/Anderson? Just because he’s not a lockdown guard defender at 7 foot plus doesn’t mean he’s not the best rim protector in the league and the key to our defense. He did a good job contesting the Luka game winner as well, Luka just balled out this series no matter who was on him.</p>

      <label for="l6npcux" class="commentText"><p>I feel like the discussion around Rudy is just too absolute in both directions.</p>

<p>He is a GENERATIONAL rim protector and that aspect of him as a player is heavily underrated at this point. He is a free ticket to a top 5 defense.</p>

<p>On the flip side of the token, EVERY. SINGLE. YEAR. He gets taken out to the perimeter in the playoffs and gets absolutely torched. You can argue it’s a scheme thing and his team shouldn’t be forcing him to switch in those situations, but if you are the “defender of a generation” in modern NBA basketball, you need to defend the perimeter at MINIMUM at a serviceable level.</p>

<p>I think when you combine this with the fact that he is on a max deal and is completely inept on offense (that turnaround on Jokic was the fakest shot in NBA history), you can understand the criticism of Rudy.</p>

      <label for="l6oh1zo" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, this is my problem too. The metrics, both regular and advanced, love Rudy. Led the league in RPG. 2nd in Blocks. #1 in defensive Win Shares. Wolves had the best defense in the league and 3rd best net rating. He was 18th in +/- with 75% of those ahead of him being 20+ PPG scorers. Wolves opponents shot a league low 45%. The team&rsquo;s defensive percentages nosedive when you look at on/off diff. He is objectively a <em>great</em> defender.</p>

<p>The other thing is that Rudy didn&rsquo;t vote himself DPOY! This isn&rsquo;t KAT calling himself the greatest shooting big man of all time &ndash; the media voted him DPOY of the year 4x. It&rsquo;s frankly bullshit that players seem to give him hate for winning that award just because they think someone else should get it. Rationally that should not be a knock on Rudy because the media wide narrative is that he deserves the award for some reason. You&rsquo;ve got jealous bitches like Draymond attempting to hurt and then slandering this man&rsquo;s good name every chance he gets. It&rsquo;s petty, schoolgirl bullshit.</p>

<p>That said, I don&rsquo;t think he deserves DPOY this year. I love watching his French ass get cooked by Luka and others. I don&rsquo;t even like Rudy one bit and think the media vastly overrates him.</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean he isn&rsquo;t basically a top 5 defender every single year though. Any big is gonna get cooked if you leave him 1-on-1 on the perimeter with generational scoring talents, yet only Rudy gets shit on for it. The hate just seems to have gone too far.</p>

      <label for="l6onj96" class="commentText"><p>I think the flaw in so many of these arguments is you assume the opposition is arguing that you should never get cooked as DPOY, then you present evidence of guys being cooked as why they’re wrong.</p>

<p>The problem no one believes DPOY’s should be able to guard everything 1-5. It’s a strawman you guys keep repeating because it lets you paint the opposition as ignorant &amp; yourselves enlightened.</p>

<p>They think that relative to other great defenders, he’s the easiest one to expose and the easiest one to take away his abilities &amp; when you factor in his horrible offense/contract, you’re basically forcing your entire team to be built compensating for 4 on 5 basketball on offense that can cover for his lack of spacing too &amp; then build a team full of perfect perimeter defenders so he can play drop &amp; have the defensive coaches &amp; schemes commit to it. Jrue &amp; OG are plug and play Gobert is the opposite.</p>

<p>After all that, relative to investment needed for a team he’s stupidly overrated. The cost benefit-value just isn’t there. This may be the best Minny or Rudy team we ever see and their cap only gives them maybe 1-2 more years of this.</p>

<p>Rudy Gobert is the Schwerer Gustav of NBA players.</p>

      <label for="l6oh1iz" class="commentText"><p>Because they are incoherent opinions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gobert isnt the best defender in the world, players were hunting him on the perimeter&rdquo; but also say &ldquo;AD is a better defender because he doesnt get hunted on the perimeter&rdquo; &ndash;&amp;gt; Except when Jamal Murray hit a game winner on his head and hunted him all of last years series.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jrue Holiday is the best defender in the world&rdquo; &ndash;&amp;gt; Jimmy Butler dropped 56 points on his head and thats not even a mismatch, Jrue is EXPECTED to guard perimeter players and he couldnt even do that, but doesnt get any criticism for it.</p>

<p>What they are saying doesnt add up. If a player cant be a DPOY because hes getting cooked on mismatches, how is a player who gets cooked by the guy hes suppossed to defend the best defender in the world?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know If this is a factor but Gobert not being an NBA-caliber <strong><em>offensive</em></strong> player doesn&rsquo;t help. Not talking about setting screens.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m talking about him not being vertical threat, bumbling passes in traffic, being unable to punish small defenders no matter how deep in the post he is, disastrous footwork in the post, turning the ball over in the post.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s a great help defender but not 1-on-1 like AD, Bam or Wemby, he protects the rim but he&rsquo;s 7&rsquo;3 so it&rsquo;s like doesn&rsquo;t get credit for it, when we see a lot of 7-foot guys in the league who can&rsquo;t protect the rim at all.</p>

<p><em>Some</em> of the Gobert criticism is unfair for sure but not a lot of it, there&rsquo;s a disconnect between his accolades and his high level-impact or lack thereof.</p>

<p>Gobert isn&rsquo;t an All-star or All-NBA caliber offensive player, but this reputation is absolutely out of hand lmao. The guy with the NBA record for most dunks in a season isn&rsquo;t a vertical threat? He did a great job drawing fouls against the Mavs down low. He had some bad miscues, but he was above average in post PPP. Also, on multiple occasions you could see him out his hand up calling for the ball in the post, drawing in preemptive help defense and creating an open corner 3 when the help came in. It seemed pretty obvious that for all the shit he&rsquo;s gotten in past years, he made some strides offensively this year. He wasn&rsquo;t incredible, but he was at least serviceable, and they were targeting getting Luka switched onto him and letting him post Luka up to get Luka in foul trouble at a couple points.</p>

<p>Also, you can say screening doesn&rsquo;t count, but the difference between him screening and KAT screening on PnRs was pretty noticable.</p>

A lot of the problems rudy has in terms of “switching” you can say the same for majority of the 5s. I think alot of it stems from rudy being overpaid ( like I said before that’s not his fault). Rudy protects the paint, he does his job extremely well. Rudy deserves criticism for not adding anything to his offensive game in 10 years . People blaming Rudy is wack and repetitive because at this point we know what he is as a player.Timberwolves got outplayed and out coached this series.  Awards are watered down, they haven’t meant much to me sense drose got mvp over bron and then Marc got dpoty over him.</p>

Neither are strictly wrong, but it does seem kinda weird that as&hellip; casual basketball watchers (lets be real most redditors are casual) that they&rsquo;re trying to make the argument that players are flat out wrong for feeling how they feel regarding things they have to do.</p>

<p>I think JB and Hart are right in that Rudy does get too much hate, and that its an impossible task to do things like guarding Luka/Kyrie for an entire series.</p>

<p>However on the flip side the game of basketball has evolved to the point that I don&rsquo;t think DPOY should be JUST the best defensive big on the best defensive team. I think someone in that lane can and should win in future years, but it has to actually be the conversation of &ldquo;Is his impact in this aspect of defense enough to outweigh players that may not be as paint dominant, but can shut down entire possessions regardless of who gets switched on him&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I will say up until this Mavs series, I bought into it and was willing to believe that he truly just didn’t have the best supporting cast in Utah. But really, what other DPOY gets hunted on switches and played off the floor in the playoffs? He certainly wasn’t the reason they lost the series, but he certainly wasn’t a big enough factor to help them win.</p>

<p>With Gobert on the floor, Mavs scored 109 pts per 100 possessions, which would be the 28th ranked offense in the reg season. Their offensive efficiency was absolutely terrible against Gobert. The only Twolves player with a positive +/- for the series was Gobert. Is that getting &ldquo;played off the floor&rdquo;?</p>

Look at AD. Murray was killing AD. No one said a word. You can’t expect big Centers to guard these guards. It’s unfair. As Dallas, ofc you wannu attack the big with 2 of the best iso guys. BUT in the future, if teams pick on you in playoffs, then you have NO chance at DPOY!!! Ain’t no one gonnu pick on Dray/ AD / Bam / Jrue* / wenby /</p>

      <label for="l6oe4b0" class="commentText"><p>Gobert is an incredible player and an even more incredible defender.</p>

<p>He put up an DPOY performance this year. I think that VW should have got it, but Gobert was certainly a worthy candidate.</p>

<p>And when you look at the difference with him on/off (something like giving up 100 vs. 130), it&rsquo;s huge, even if he&rsquo;s getting lit on the perimeter by Kyrie and Luka because EVERYBODY gets lit up on the perimeter by Kyrie and Luka.</p>

<p>I think part of the issue is that KAT seemed to play Joker better on defence. That takes a lot of steam out of your DPOY when you are the center and your power forward is covering the other guy&rsquo;s center, who is the best player on the team.</p>

<p>But it seemed like the reason for that was more so to allow Gobert to focus on being a rim protector because, if he&rsquo;s covering Jokic and Jokic makes one of his HOF passed to a guy cutting, NOBODY is there to block that can and defend the basket. But when KAT is on Jokic, Gobert and protect the rim.</p>

<p>But that switch up likely looked bad to casual fans.</p>

<p>Still.. VW just put up such amazing personal stats, and the only thing holding him back from getting DPOY was the fact that his team was so shit.</p>

As the nba is evolving for more small ball and switch heavy defenses, the DPOY should go to the guy who can guard perimeter possessions AND protect the paint. Someone like AD, Bam, Giannis, future Wemby. Although Rudy is a better paint defender, the other guys versatility outweigh his impact most of the time.</p>

<p>That Mavs team was very different though and Luka didn&rsquo;t have someone like Kyrie to take the pressure off him (Brunson wasn&rsquo;t <em>Brunson</em> yet).</p>

      <label for="l6oaxyb" class="commentText"><p>I’m convinced Gobert just looks funky, uncoordinated, and lost at times which leads to people thinking he sucks. It’s the nba, Offense rules. Every great defender can be made to look silly. Gobert is just so much more of a focal point and looks so goofy at times. That being said, I do question his skills myself. Is he better defensively than say Bam or AD. The advanced stats say it’s clear. I won’t allow myself to think my brain knows better than data.</p>

<p>Couldn’t we blame scheme and the initial defender in every scenario too? In the nba the guards often refuse to fight over a screen . This forces the big man to switch and they guard will always have an advantage. That’s most of the times when gobert is getting cooked on the outside.</p>

      <label for="l6oycf0" class="commentText"><p>This whole conversation just highlights how stupid the players are. Like some people actually say players should vote for awards.</p>

<p>Yea Rudy is gangly, somewhat uncoordinated, kinda annoying. I don&rsquo;t like him either. But how hard is it to understand that he is the best rim protector in the league and protecting the rim is the most impact you can have on defense?</p>

<p>Outside of Bam, how many 5&rsquo;s can you switch onto a perimeter scorer and not get exposed? Bam is also only 6&rsquo;9&rdquo;, he&rsquo;s a small 5 man. If Jrue gets caught in a switch on Embiid, he&rsquo;ll be bbq chicken too.</p>

<p>Also, like every player can get free on a defender on the perimeter almost whenever they want. Then it&rsquo;s on help defense to try and hold up. It&rsquo;s not like the best perimeter defenders are putting clamps on their man every possession; they&rsquo;re also getting beat a lot and relying a ton on their big man to defend</p>
