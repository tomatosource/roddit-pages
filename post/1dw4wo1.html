</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>-Just asking cause they’re both around the same age, except PG is a lot more healthy.</p>

<p>-Lot of clipper fans thought Harden was the better playoff this year.</p>

<p>-Harden shoots more 3s and is a great passer. What can PG do but score? His defense is long gone.</p>

<p>Don’t see how the sixers situation is any better then if they had signed harden last year?</p>

      <label for="lbs4ysd" class="commentText"><p>They do different things.  PG can be what they wanted Tobi to be.  3rd option who can create for himself when they need him to and can make open 3s created by the first two options.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how well he&rsquo;ll adapt to the third banana role though.  I think Sixers might be a little surprised by how stubborn and ball dominant he can be.  PG has all the tools to be the ultimate third option but he doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have that mindset.</p>

He&rsquo;s shown he can be effective without the ball in his hands, but I think you would prefer him to use the possessions more and probably ensure Embiid and PG do more of the finishing.</p>

      <label for="lbsi54z" class="commentText"><p>Agree, on one hand I get it because the floor is so open and almost every starting PG in the NBA is an absolute bucket getter but in that same regard it should make passing and the like all that much easier. Look at the looks Harden’s teammates get because of his gravity as a scorer especially back when he was in Houston when he was a score-first player. Rondo was huge for the 2020 Lakers because of his facilitating.</p>

He had 4.3 spot ups a game compared to 3.5 isolations a game, despite averaging 1.29 points per spot up posesssion and only 1.03 points per isolation posession. His spot up frequency was only 21%, and his eFG% goes from 66% with 0 dribbles to 46% with 3-6 dribbles lol.</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/K21In6U" target="_blank">Dude was only taking 4.3 spot up shots a game despite being like 20 points per 100 higher than the ~15 guys around him on the possessions per game list</a>. He&rsquo;s a 93rd percentile spot up shooter who settles for the same amount of spot up attempts as guys in the 40th percentile.</p>

<p>The guy turns down a ton of looks to do his wack ass isolations, and if he&rsquo;s playing 3rd option in Philly he&rsquo;s not going to let the bulk of his shots be catch and shoot as you can see by his 21% spot up frequency, despite them being a way better shot for him to take than anything else he does.</p>

      <label for="lbspb3j" class="commentText"><p>It won&rsquo;t be.  Paul George actually led the Clippers in usage last season, and James Harden&rsquo;s usage dropped to the third lowest of his career to make that possible.  If Paul George leads the Sixers in usage, something will have gone very wrong.</p>

<p>PG&rsquo;s c&amp;s attempts last season actually weren&rsquo;t the highest of his career.  It was indeed the most efficient, but if you look at his career c&amp;s shoot numbers, the good seasons coincide with playing with good playmaking.  Even as the first option in Indy, he had seasons where he took more c&amp;s 3s than he did as the third option last season.</p>

Kawhi was willing to give up most of his ball handling duties and be set up by Harden. PG would sometimes do this but would then inexplicably start isoing way too much leading to turnovers and difficult shots. If he can settle into the offball role he will be perfect for the 76ers but it’s hard to believe as a Clipper fan</p>

      <label for="lbshtfj" class="commentText"><p>In his last 3 years with the Celtics, Smart was never really asked to go with the flow. He was asked to be the lead ball-handler and initiator. He was expected to be the 3rd scorer. And he was the defensive captain. People keep talking about how Smart was the problem on the Celtics, but he gave everything he had to the team and always did what was asked of him. He did a good job starting with White in 22-23 and even played well in the playoffs.</p>

<p>I agree that Jrue is a better player, but I was arguing with the other user that Smart was better than nobody and that Smart was better than Hauser and Pritchard. Those two were borderline unplayable for multiple series these playoffs. Hauser because of his poor shooting and Pritchard because of his size/defense.</p>

<p>You are definitely right about the chemistry. The Celtics got lucky that it came together so fast. Jrue stepped right into his role and who doesn&rsquo;t love this version of KP?</p>

Smart was never the problem &amp; I agree with you there but the role players did their job when needed. Smart is obviously better than those 2 &amp; you’ll hardly see players play with that much heart</p>

And in case you forgot, after Tatum doesn&rsquo;t get called for a clear pushoff on Maxey for a lead-taking three pointer, Philly responds with Embiid pulling the corner defender and opening up Harden, Embiid sees this and makes the high IQ decision to pass it out to a wide open Harden for the game-winning shot.  They won game 4 together.</p>

<p>Harden also shot 25% in the other five games, including going 0/6 for 0 points in the fourth quarters of games 5-7&hellip; statistically worse than Ben Simmons (0/0, 5 points).</p>

<p>They both played 70+ games last year (harden sat out some games because the trade request). Prior to last year PG been averaging like 50 ish games per season for like 3 years.</p>

      <label for="lbs753p" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a positional thing.</p>

<p>Like, Rudy Gobert would massively upgrade most teams, but he would barely move the needle in Philadelphia, because he&rsquo;s not good enough to start over Embiid. Having an ultra elite backup center who plays 11 minutes a game isn&rsquo;t a huge upgrade.</p>

<p>So the better question is, is PG a better upgrade for them than Harden was.</p>

<p>Answer is yes. PG is light years better than Tobias, who he&rsquo;ll be replacing in the lineup.</p>

      <label for="lbs8chr" class="commentText"><p>PG remains a great defender when he isn&rsquo;t being played out of position and is locked in. He&rsquo;s a great defender and remains a very efficient scorer. Being underrated big time by NBA fans because they don&rsquo;t like his personality+playoff frailities.</p>

<p>Harden obviously remains an awesome offensive player and he was mostly healthy last season.</p>

<p>PG in a weakside/off ball role should be an awesome fit for the Sixers. Harden is an offensive engine. Sixers have their engines in Embiid/Maxey.</p>

      <label for="lbsi3rc" class="commentText"><p>So firstly he does not shoot more threes. Not since Houston. Not only that but he is one of the most willing and best catch and shoot three point shooters in the NBA. Whereas James seems so much more uncomfortable shooting off the catch threes as opposed to off the dribble threes.</p>

<p>Secondly saying his defense is long gone is simply incorrect if you just watch him play basketball. It&rsquo;s especially egregious when brought up as a point <em>for James Harden</em>.</p>

<p>Thirdly the issue in LA for George was that there was overlap in his and Leonard&rsquo;s game. They&rsquo;re great players, but they still needed to adjust the fit. The same is true of Harden and Maxey. Maxey is a great off ball shooter so he could do that while Harden had the ball in his hands (because Harden is definitely the better passer) but we weren&rsquo;t maximizing Maxey&rsquo;s skills. With George in Philly, we have a premier ball handler, wing, and big man. All who operate at different areas of the court, all who are able to be the best versions of themselves while both the other two players are on the court.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s what separates them from other big threes that have multiple ball dominant guards (Suns) or two paint swallowing bigs (Wolves), or two two-way wings (Clippers). Does that make them the best <em>team</em>? No. In fact they aren&rsquo;t even really a team right now they have four starters lol. But yes on paper they fit much better. Especially since Paul is still very close to the same player he was production-wise four years ago.</p>

      <label for="lbs58yx" class="commentText"><p>No, harden would’ve been going on his 4th year with the sixers and that much chemistry would’ve been worth whatever else George adds. Sixers roll out a new roster damn near every year and wonder why shit ain’t working. Harden also just outplayed George on the same team, both guys have no show nights but the difference is harden can still utilize his playmaking. When pg’s shot isn’t falling he becomes the king do forcing bad shots. He no longer is an elite defender and they will be asking him to guard the opposing teams best guys, all series against Dallas he couldn’t bother Luka or Kyrie at all and kept fouling them when they beat him of the dribble.</p>

      <label for="lbs9i7u" class="commentText"><p>No, but Paul is still an upgrade for Tobias Harris.  They already had Maxey, and while he isn&rsquo;t the distributor Harden is, it&rsquo;s another ball handler to keep PG in efficient catch and shoot situations.  I think he will play a bit better since Embiid can hit the midrange like nothing, and even hit some 3&rsquo;s.  This should keep PG out of his midrange chucks and can keep him efficient, provided he isn&rsquo;t told to iso for his baskets, which he undoubtedly will since he signed a max and will be expected to perform at that level.</p>

<p>On the contrary, maybe an on-ball wing is what the 76ers needed.  PG did well in the East before.  No LeBron in his way this time.</p>

Harden is a better playmaker sure, but he needs the ball in his hands. And PG is a much better defender compared to Harden even if he has fallen off.</p>

      <label for="lbsff45" class="commentText"><p>Harden was not better than PG this year. The Clippers lacked an excellent point guard in the 213 era, so adding Harden made a huge impact. Even when he was bad (from March until the end of the season), Harden helped unlock a lot of Clippers offensive potential that was missing under Westbrook, Reggie, Wall, Beverley, Rondo, etc.</p>

<p>Harden was good on the 76ers, too, but with Maxey there, PG has a chance to be more effective.</p>

      <label for="lbur8la" class="commentText"><p>You literally just explained why harden was more impactful on winning on the clippers lol. Do you seriously think it’s a coincidence that PG was so much more efficient his first time playing with harden? Going from getting fed easy looks by harden to trying to get looks from maxey forced into the pg role is not going to be pretty. There’s a reason PG was desperate to sign a max anywhere while harden didn’t give a shit and just signed a 1+1. I’m really looking forward to seeing the sixers going forward and pg looking way worse than last year and morey putting him on the trade block in like year 2.</p>

      <label for="lbs57gk" class="commentText"><p>Maxey - PG - Embiid &amp;gt; Maxey - Harden - Embiid, on paper.</p>

<p>There is a bit of redundancy with Maxey and Harden. Both want to be your ball dominate guard. PG fills a different role offensively, can play defense better etc. which should add up to a better roster overall.</p>

<p>Also, and this can&rsquo;t be overstated, the 76ers did a bit of addition by subtraction with getting rid of Tobias Harris. He really just wasn&rsquo;t a good player, he&rsquo;d have moments but never when the 6ers needed it.</p>

      <label for="lbsawq8" class="commentText"><p>No not really. I think in theory (and this is a <em>big</em> theory since he refuses to play the way he should) PG fits better but Harden is definitely the better player in general. Honestly I could pretty quickly see the team being worse with PG in just about every way if he starts chucking and looking for his own shot instead of staying in his lane as the 3rd option. If he tries to do more than that Harden was better in every way. The second he starts dribbling into mid range 2s and passing up open catch and shoot 3s its a disaster</p>

      <label for="lbt5pgi" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re wrong about the 3s.  PG shoots more 3s at higher efficiency than Harden.  And even more important, PG takes catch and shoot 3s.  That&rsquo;s something Harden is very reluctant to do. Also even at this stage of his career PG is a much better wing defender than Harden.  He&rsquo;s just a much better player when he doesn&rsquo;t have the ball which matters for the 3rd best player.</p>

<p>The sixers have a declining, injury prone Paul George, who was clearly worse than harden last year, on the hook for 50 mil when he’s 38. There’s so much coping going on in this thread.</p>

      <label for="lbscyou" class="commentText"><p>Fit wise, maybe(?) depends on Maxeys point guard abilities. Skill wise, Harden has a more consistent floor/ceiling than George. Watching him as a clipper, one moment he’s Kd light, next moment you don’t even realize he’s on the court. Very volatile.</p>

<p>Another small factor is his mental health. I’m a bit concerned on if he’s able to weather those storms 6er fans will give him when he’s playing bad. Not sure he has the confidence to shake that off so easily.</p>

      <label for="lbsdhly" class="commentText"><p>Yes it all boils down to play style and role. Harden is a fantastic facilitator but he completely needs the ball in his hands and Maxey can’t be on ball as much. Harden is a true negative on defense aside from being in the post and he’s not guarding anyone’s best player, Harden has also made comments alluding to not having the freedom he wanted with the ball (which is weird bc he helped Joel get MVP) when he left. The “I’m a system” talk when he’s clearly declining in his ability to carry an offense for more than a game or two. George is a better shooter, embraces the role of being a secondary option, isn’t as ball dominant and will take catch and shoot 3s, which harden for some ungodly reason completely refuses to take. That was infuriating watching him aside from like the shot against the Celtics in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="lbsj9hi" class="commentText"><p>It isn’t just PG we got, we also got 2 first round picks, 2 second round picks, and we got rid of the corpse of PJ Tucker who at this point is just paid $17 million to buy cool shoes and sit court side at games. Harden also very clearly did not want to be here and was making as many headlines than buckets. That alone was worth getting rid of Harden, because keeping him was never an option. This is more like an upgrade from Tobias Harris which… does it need to be asked?</p>

<p>Positionally, a core that consists of a guard, a wing, and a big is more balanced than a core that consists of 2 guards and a big. Philly has a defensive identity and PG fits that identity better than Harden (and Harris for that matter).</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing them get a real playmaker because even though he has made great strides Maxey is more of a shooting guard than a point guard. Someone like Tyus Jones would be fantastic with this roster although I’d like more size to pair in the backcourt with Maxey who already struggles on defense at times.</p>

      <label for="lbsjfao" class="commentText"><p>I think so. He’s a more reliable personality for one, a better defender, better off ball, and helps fill a more immediate need at wing whereas winning a title with Maxey and Harden (two small guards who aren’t particularly great on D) would’ve been more challenging. The question is availability with PG, but the fit is a good one I think</p>

PG plays with more effort at this point in their careers, and I believe he’ll be willing to take a semi backseat to the two younger, healthier stars to win. Also, him getting that money he got will make it slightly easier to take that backseat.</p>

<p>Harden and PG are two completely different players. PG doesn&rsquo;t need the ball that much and fits way better with both Embiid and Maxey (at least on paper). And even if his defense is &ldquo;long gone&rdquo; he is still MUCH better than Harden on that end.</p>

<p>BTW just to let you know Harden was the guy going for 7 points and 16% from the field in tie breaker game 5, and then 16 points and 31% from the field, in this said &ldquo;better in the playoffs&rdquo;&hellip; yes PG wasn&rsquo;t great but at least didn&rsquo;t shit the bed as much.</p>

      <label for="lbuf4yo" class="commentText"><p>They’re not the same type of player.</p>

<p>James Harden is a ball dominant playmaking point guard whose defense is not that good.</p>

<p>Paul George is not ball dominant, can play more off ball as a floor spacer, and has the skill to take over in spurts in clutch times and in the 4th quarter. He’s also taller and is a good defensive player.</p>

<p>Paul George is a better fit. Sixers already have a point guard in maxey and Embiid who demands the ball in order to be more effective</p>

<p>On Philly I know Doc talked about Hardens style cramped Maxey and the Sixers with the way he dominated the ball. As a 3rd option and floor spacer PG just makes more sense than Harden did next to Maxey.</p>

      <label for="lbuoain" class="commentText"><p>It’s the wrong comp. PG is more of an upgrade for Tobias than a replacement for harden. A backcourt of Maxey and harden was always going to be challenging in the playoffs. You can’t play two guys who are total liabilities on defense. Harden and maxey also have overlapping skillsets so removing harden from the mix allowed maxey to develop his two man game with embiid.</p>

<p>PG comes in as a legit third option who can also defend and create his own shot. What the sixers desperately needed was someone other than their two stars to literally do anything on offense. Like if they got consistent production from Tobias good chance they beat the Knicks.</p>
