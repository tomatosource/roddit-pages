</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>-Just asking cause they’re both around the same age, except PG is a lot more healthy.</p>

<p>-Lot of clipper fans thought Harden was the better playoff this year.</p>

<p>-Harden shoots more 3s and is a great passer. What can PG do but score? His defense is long gone.</p>

<p>Don’t see how the sixers situation is any better then if they had signed harden last year?</p>

      <label for="lbs4ysd" class="commentText"><p>They do different things.  PG can be what they wanted Tobi to be.  3rd option who can create for himself when they need him to and can make open 3s created by the first two options.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how well he&rsquo;ll adapt to the third banana role though.  I think Sixers might be a little surprised by how stubborn and ball dominant he can be.  PG has all the tools to be the ultimate third option but he doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have that mindset.</p>

He&rsquo;s shown he can be effective without the ball in his hands, but I think you would prefer him to use the possessions more and probably ensure Embiid and PG do more of the finishing.</p>

      <label for="lbsi54z" class="commentText"><p>Agree, on one hand I get it because the floor is so open and almost every starting PG in the NBA is an absolute bucket getter but in that same regard it should make passing and the like all that much easier. Look at the looks Harden’s teammates get because of his gravity as a scorer especially back when he was in Houston when he was a score-first player. Rondo was huge for the 2020 Lakers because of his facilitating.</p>

I don&rsquo;t agree that replacing Smart with nobody (KP in the playoffs) made the team better. That&rsquo;s just absurd and completely diminishes all of the positives that Smart brought to the Celtics throughout his career. He helped that team overachieve for years.

      <label for="lbshtfj" class="commentText"><p>In his last 3 years with the Celtics, Smart was never really asked to go with the flow. He was asked to be the lead ball-handler and initiator. He was expected to be the 3rd scorer. And he was the defensive captain. People keep talking about how Smart was the problem on the Celtics, but he gave everything he had to the team and always did what was asked of him. He did a good job starting with White in 22-23 and even played well in the playoffs.</p>

<p>I agree that Jrue is a better player, but I was arguing with the other user that Smart was better than nobody and that Smart was better than Hauser and Pritchard. Those two were borderline unplayable for multiple series these playoffs. Hauser because of his poor shooting and Pritchard because of his size/defense.</p>

<p>You are definitely right about the chemistry. The Celtics got lucky that it came together so fast. Jrue stepped right into his role and who doesn&rsquo;t love this version of KP?</p>

Smart was never the problem &amp; I agree with you there but the role players did their job when needed. Smart is obviously better than those 2 &amp; you’ll hardly see players play with that much heart</p>

The two wins were awesome, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, but he shoots above even 30% from the floor in any of the four loses and we may have eliminated them. That being said, the good thing about PG is that he&rsquo;s a direct upgrade from Tobias, and Maxey made a jump that makes the loss of Harden sting a lot less</p>

What they do say is that maybe he shouldn’t shoot 25% in the games outside of his 2 40 pointers. And Joel did make buckets. Game 4 when harden &ldquo;won it&rdquo; he had <sup>34</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>. Game 3 he had <sup>30</sup>&frasl;<sub>13</sub> with 4 blocks. Aside from game 7 where he was ass all around he had great defense. Game 6 he lead the Sixers in points and had 3 blocks.  It’s people like you who think Embiid played like dogshit.</p>

And in case you forgot, after Tatum doesn&rsquo;t get called for a clear pushoff on Maxey for a lead-taking three pointer, Philly responds with Embiid pulling the corner defender and opening up Harden, Embiid sees this and makes the high IQ decision to pass it out to a wide open Harden for the game-winning shot.  They won game 4 together.</p>

<p>Harden also shot 25% in the other five games, including going 0/6 for 0 points in the fourth quarters of games 5-7&hellip; statistically worse than Ben Simmons (0/0, 5 points).</p>

<p>Embiid has <sup>34</sup>&frasl;<sub>13</sub> in game 4, drawing the corner defender and passing to a now open Harden for the game-winner and &ldquo;Harden won the game by himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George has 33/6/8 in game 4 and it was all Harden.</p>

<p>PG in Games 1, 2, &amp; 4: <sup>26</sup>&frasl;<sub>53</sub> (.491), <sup>13</sup>&frasl;<sub>27</sub> (.481) from 3, 25.7 PPG, 4.7 RPG, 5 APG, 2 SPG.</p>

<p>If Philly had three games like that from George instead of Harris they would have crushed last year&rsquo;s Knicks and probably make the conference finals.</p>

<p>Harden had two great games for Philly and shot 25% in the other five.  Even PG&rsquo;s three bad games against Dallas weren&rsquo;t that level of bad.</p>

<p>And lest we forget how Harden finished that ^([edit: DAL]) series&hellip; <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>28</sub> (25%), <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>13</sub> from three (.077), -31.</p>

      <label for="lbs753p" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a positional thing.</p>

<p>Like, Rudy Gobert would massively upgrade most teams, but he would barely move the needle in Philadelphia, because he&rsquo;s not good enough to start over Embiid. Having an ultra elite backup center who plays 11 minutes a game isn&rsquo;t a huge upgrade.</p>

<p>So the better question is, is PG a better upgrade for them than Harden was.</p>

<p>Answer is yes. PG is light years better than Tobias, who he&rsquo;ll be replacing in the lineup.</p>

      <label for="lbsa15b" class="commentText"><p>I think this is a simple box score way of looking at it.</p>

<p>His usage percentage did go up 4% and his efficiency probably went down. A lot of that can be simply viewed as him being asked to do more, taking worse shots as the main scorer for most of the season without Embiid.</p>

<p>To me what was most impressive was his assist numbers jumping like they did. He took that bigger role and did very well at playmaking. Like I said his usage percentage when up 4% while his  assist percentage when up nearly 10% and his turnover percentage went down. That&rsquo;s incredible growth if you ask me that goes beyond him being asked to do more.</p>

He&rsquo;s a great defender and remains a very efficient scorer. Being underrated big time by NBA fans because they don&rsquo;t like his personality+playoff frailities.</p>

<p>Harden obviously remains an awesome offensive player and he was mostly healthy last season.</p>

<p>PG in a weakside/off ball role should be an awesome fit for the Sixers. Harden is an offensive engine. Sixers have their engines in Embiid/Maxey.</p>

Sixers roll out a new roster damn near every year and wonder why shit ain’t working. Harden also just outplayed George on the same team, both guys have no show nights but the difference is harden can still utilize his playmaking. When pg’s shot isn’t falling he becomes the king do forcing bad shots. He no longer is an elite defender and they will be asking him to guard the opposing teams best guys, all series against Dallas he couldn’t bother Luka or Kyrie at all and kept fouling them when they beat him of the dribble.</p>

<p>There is a bit of redundancy with Maxey and Harden. Both want to be your ball dominate guard. PG fills a different role offensively, can play defense better etc. which should add up to a better roster overall.</p>

<p>Also, and this can&rsquo;t be overstated, the 76ers did a bit of addition by subtraction with getting rid of Tobias Harris. He really just wasn&rsquo;t a good player, he&rsquo;d have moments but never when the 6ers needed it.</p>

      <label for="lbsawq8" class="commentText"><p>No not really. I think in theory (and this is a <em>big</em> theory since he refuses to play the way he should) PG fits better but Harden is definitely the better player in general. Honestly I could pretty quickly see the team being worse with PG in just about every way if he starts chucking and looking for his own shot instead of staying in his lane as the 3rd option. If he tries to do more than that Harden was better in every way. The second he starts dribbling into mid range 2s and passing up open catch and shoot 3s its a disaster</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s a horrendous passer and refuses to settle for the catch and shoot 3s that are generated for him as much as he should because he wants to show off his wack ass bag and settle for long 2s when he gets stood up. He was significantly worse ISOing than Harden or Kawhi but insisted on doing it.</p>

<p>He doesn&rsquo;t do any of the dirty work and insists on being hidden on defense, usually guarding a 3rd or 4th option on the other team to preserve his offense.</p>

<p>PG is NOT what people think lol. His efficiency went up because Harden was creating efficient shots for him. When he was the one ballhandling, his PPP was ass</p>

<p>We just watched the 76ers shot quality tank without Harden and they weren&rsquo;t even able to get an entry pass to Embiid where he wanted it in the playoffs.</p>

<p>He was their only choice this season, but getting Harden on a 35 to 40m a year deal 2 years ago would&rsquo;ve been way better.</p>

<p>Maxey was learning a ton from Harden and was set to take a big scoring leap with or without James being there. If both of them had had to play together without Embiid for as long as Maxey did by himself, they undoubtedly would&rsquo;ve both been better and Maxey would&rsquo;ve grown more.</p>

He’s better than Tobias but he will do the same shit, dribble into the midrange instead of shoot open 3s like he did on the clippers. He just played with an elite playmaker in harden and still didn’t want to settle for those shots he will have worse quality looks in Philly. They think they are getting the perfect glue guy for the team but Paul George is not a glue guy he is a star player and will play his brand of basketball which is redundant alongside Embiid and Maxey who also like to handle the ball a lot.</p>

      <label for="lbsjasu" class="commentText"><p>He shot more than ever because this was the first time he&rsquo;s played with 2 stars he had to share the ball with, and one of them was James Harden who was constantly setting him up. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean he shouldn&rsquo;t have taken <em>more.</em></p>

<p>He was averaging<a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/spot-up?SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;dir=D&amp;sort=PPP" target="_blank"> 4.3 spot up attempts per game and scoring an elite 1.29 points per possession on them</a>. He was also averaging 3.5 isolations a game and averaging a totally mid 1.03 points per possession on them. He gave up way too many spot up opportunities just to settle for an iso. <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/scoring?SeasonType=Regular+Season&amp;TeamID=1610612746" target="_blank">73.3% of his 3s made were assisted,</a> but his spot up frequency was only 21%.</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/K21In6U" target="_blank">I mean shit, just look at the people who take the same amount of spot up possessions of him per game, and then look at their points per possession. </a>He&rsquo;s settling for the same amount of spot up possessions as guys averaging 20 PPP less than him.  That&rsquo;s just bad process.</p>

<p>Despite being <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/isolation?SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;dir=D&amp;sort=POSS" target="_blank">10 points per 100 worse than Harden in isolation and 17 points per 100 worse than Kawhi</a>, he was only isolating 0.2 possessions less per game than Kawhi and 0.4 less than Harden. Why? He averaged about as many isolation possessions as he did catch and shoot 3s, despite it being significantly worse for the team. And the open 3s were <strong>definitely</strong> being generated at a higher clip than that for him, he just wasn&rsquo;t always taking them when he should have.</p>

<p>Need more? Let&rsquo;s look at his eFG% relative to his dribbles.</p>

<p>0 dribbles? 65.7 eFG%, 3pt% of 45%</p>

<p>1-2 dribbles? 52 eFG%, 3pt% of 37%</p>

<p>3-6 dribbles? 46.9 eFG%, 3pt% of 30%.</p>

      <label for="lbs9i7u" class="commentText"><p>No, but Paul is still an upgrade for Tobias Harris.  They already had Maxey, and while he isn&rsquo;t the distributor Harden is, it&rsquo;s another ball handler to keep PG in efficient catch and shoot situations.  I think he will play a bit better since Embiid can hit the midrange like nothing, and even hit some 3&rsquo;s.  This should keep PG out of his midrange chucks and can keep him efficient, provided he isn&rsquo;t told to iso for his baskets, which he undoubtedly will since he signed a max and will be expected to perform at that level.</p>

<p>On the contrary, maybe an on-ball wing is what the 76ers needed.  PG did well in the East before.  No LeBron in his way this time.</p>

      <label for="lbsff45" class="commentText"><p>Harden was not better than PG this year. The Clippers lacked an excellent point guard in the 213 era, so adding Harden made a huge impact. Even when he was bad (from March until the end of the season), Harden helped unlock a lot of Clippers offensive potential that was missing under Westbrook, Reggie, Wall, Beverley, Rondo, etc.</p>

<p>Harden was good on the 76ers, too, but with Maxey there, PG has a chance to be more effective.</p>

      <label for="lbsi3rc" class="commentText"><p>So firstly he does not shoot more threes. Not since Houston. Not only that but he is one of the most willing and best catch and shoot three point shooters in the NBA. Whereas James seems so much more uncomfortable shooting off the catch threes as opposed to off the dribble threes.</p>

<p>Secondly saying his defense is long gone is simply incorrect if you just watch him play basketball. It&rsquo;s especially egregious when brought up as a point <em>for James Harden</em>.</p>

<p>Thirdly the issue in LA for George was that there was overlap in his and Leonard&rsquo;s game. They&rsquo;re great players, but they still needed to adjust the fit. The same is true of Harden and Maxey. Maxey is a great off ball shooter so he could do that while Harden had the ball in his hands (because Harden is definitely the better passer) but we weren&rsquo;t maximizing Maxey&rsquo;s skills. With George in Philly, we have a premier ball handler, wing, and big man. All who operate at different areas of the court, all who are able to be the best versions of themselves while both the other two players are on the court.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s what separates them from other big threes that have multiple ball dominant guards (Suns) or two paint swallowing bigs (Wolves), or two two-way wings (Clippers). Does that make them the best <em>team</em>? No. In fact they aren&rsquo;t even really a team right now they have four starters lol. But yes on paper they fit much better. Especially since Paul is still very close to the same player he was production-wise four years ago.</p>

<p>Harden has a ton to offer with his playmaking but that’s not as needed on the sixers with maxey.  I’d take PG by a hair regardless of fit but considering the fit with the sixers, it’s PG all day and not really a close call, which is why the sixers Fo was comfortable over paying for PG.</p>

      <label for="lbscyou" class="commentText"><p>Fit wise, maybe(?) depends on Maxeys point guard abilities. Skill wise, Harden has a more consistent floor/ceiling than George. Watching him as a clipper, one moment he’s Kd light, next moment you don’t even realize he’s on the court. Very volatile.</p>

<p>Another small factor is his mental health. I’m a bit concerned on if he’s able to weather those storms 6er fans will give him when he’s playing bad. Not sure he has the confidence to shake that off so easily.</p>

      <label for="lbsdhly" class="commentText"><p>Yes it all boils down to play style and role. Harden is a fantastic facilitator but he completely needs the ball in his hands and Maxey can’t be on ball as much. Harden is a true negative on defense aside from being in the post and he’s not guarding anyone’s best player, Harden has also made comments alluding to not having the freedom he wanted with the ball (which is weird bc he helped Joel get MVP) when he left. The “I’m a system” talk when he’s clearly declining in his ability to carry an offense for more than a game or two. George is a better shooter, embraces the role of being a secondary option, isn’t as ball dominant and will take catch and shoot 3s, which harden for some ungodly reason completely refuses to take. That was infuriating watching him aside from like the shot against the Celtics in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="lbsj9hi" class="commentText"><p>It isn’t just PG we got, we also got 2 first round picks, 2 second round picks, and we got rid of the corpse of PJ Tucker who at this point is just paid $17 million to buy cool shoes and sit court side at games. Harden also very clearly did not want to be here and was making as many headlines than buckets. That alone was worth getting rid of Harden, because keeping him was never an option. This is more like an upgrade from Tobias Harris which… does it need to be asked?</p>

<p>Positionally, a core that consists of a guard, a wing, and a big is more balanced than a core that consists of 2 guards and a big. Philly has a defensive identity and PG fits that identity better than Harden (and Harris for that matter).</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing them get a real playmaker because even though he has made great strides Maxey is more of a shooting guard than a point guard. Someone like Tyus Jones would be fantastic with this roster although I’d like more size to pair in the backcourt with Maxey who already struggles on defense at times.</p>

      <label for="lbsjfao" class="commentText"><p>I think so. He’s a more reliable personality for one, a better defender, better off ball, and helps fill a more immediate need at wing whereas winning a title with Maxey and Harden (two small guards who aren’t particularly great on D) would’ve been more challenging. The question is availability with PG, but the fit is a good one I think</p>

      <label for="lbsizdf" class="commentText"><p>Clippers fan here, PG is overrated IMO.
He’s maddeningly unreliable and really doesn’t seem to fit with any kind of plays, just ISO ball. He had a couple of big moments this season but tends to disappear when the lights are brightest.
The tough, hustle-defence is long gone.
He’s also quite injury prone.</p>

<p>Harden on the other hand has his ups and downs offensively but is an incredibly effective orchestrator. What he did with Zubac for a couple of months this season was exemplary (until Zubac had an unfortunate calf injury).</p>

<p>ATM I don’t see how would PG fit with the sixers… I wish him well but I think it’s gonna be a disappointment for both parties, and the tough philly crowd is gonna eat him alive when he inevitably disappears for a few games.</p>
