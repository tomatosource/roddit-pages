<p>It was an all time defensive team so they may find a way to make it work, but they wouldn&rsquo;t have the offense to keep up even if they do slow down the Warriors. The amount of threes shot between the two teams is such a huge disparity, GS would have to go ice cold to not win a series. A single game Detroit could definitely win. </p>

<p>That Pistons team is one of my favorite teams ever, I&rsquo;m not trying to be a hater. The KD Warriors was just unfair though when they were all healthy.</p>

<p>Obviously the Warriors are probably the best overall team ever assembled and the Pistons aren’t, so it’s not a “great offense vs great defense = tie” claim.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m quite fond of the Curry Warriors but I&rsquo;m a lifelong Pistons fan, so I&rsquo;ve got some weird biases here. Still, I may agree with you here nonetheless. That being said, the thing that always makes these hypotheticals tricky is the rule differences between eras.</p>

<p>The 2004 Pistons were absolutely an amazing defensive basketball team. But they&rsquo;re not holding teams to 65 points per game on a regular basis in 2024. And it&rsquo;s not necessarily because they&rsquo;d be unable to handle teams today; it&rsquo;s just that the game has changed. There&rsquo;s still amazing defensive teams out there today too, but amazing defense now may look like holding teams to 85 or 95 points instead.</p>

<p>On the flip side, the 2004 Pistons did win games by scoring 75 points at times. But again, it often felt like a reflection of the times as opposed to a flat inability to score. We kind of saw proof of that when the NBA began loosening up their defensive rules and the Pistons responded by opening up their offense a bit (particularly in the Flip Saunders era). If you&rsquo;d asked guys like Chauncey, Rip, Tay, and Sheed how they would have felt about playing in a run-and-gun, fire-at-will era like the 2020s, I think they would have been all about that life. Even Ben probably would have appreciated getting looks as a rim-runner as opposed to Larry Brown feeling obligated to give him post looks a few times a game.</p>

<p>Either way, no matter how you slice it, that era of Warriors basketball is some of the most amazing basketball I&rsquo;ve ever seen, so I wouldn&rsquo;t be particularly surprised if the 2004 Pistons were overwhelmed. No shame in that game.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ll start by admitting that I loved watching those Warriors play and I&rsquo;ve never, ever seen players fling the rock like Steph and Klay. I feel they&rsquo;d be nearly immune to rules alterations. That being said, if you twisted my arm and I had to come up with some micro-changes that have helped cultivate the 3-point era as a whole, I honestly think these things have all been contributing factors:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The legislation of the gather step (aka third step). This opened the floodgates for gnarly double-stepbacks, side-steps, and broadly speaking, advanced offensive advantages gained from having that sort of flexibility at any point.</p></li>

<li><p>The proliferation of moving screens.</p></li>

<li><p>The broad acceptance of foul-baiting in the mid- to late 2010s. 2004 was the forefront of the foul-bait phenomenon. Players were just getting into realizing they could get rewarded with two free throws by leaning into a defender following a mid-range pump fake. We just hadn&rsquo;t quite crossed the rubicon into rewarding players for the type of shenanigans we saw from the Hardens and Traes of the world at its peak.</p></li>

<li><p>A broad reduction in perimeter physicality. This isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;beat &lsquo;em up&rdquo; thing, but it&rsquo;s something the league addressed and loosened up almost immediately following the 2004 season, which is one of the reasons why we saw offenses open up as the 2000s progressed.</p></li>

<li><p>Rip-through fouls weren&rsquo;t really something players could lean on in 2004. The trade-off being that defenders could take away certain options without fear of being reeled into an automatic foul.</p></li>

<li><p>No flagrants for claustrophobic closeouts in 2004. Defenders in the modern game have to be suuuuuuper cognizant of not closing out too aggressively on shooters. Guys like Steph and Klay are insane already, adding that extra bit of comfort is just the cherry on top. I imagine if you could give those two a choice - shooting against 2024 closeouts or 2004 closeouts, I imagine they&rsquo;d select the former.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m a proponent of Steph being dropped in any era and succeeding. I think he&rsquo;s even greater than many people give him credit for. But if we&rsquo;re talking about mucking up what a Warriors team as a whole may be trying to pull off, I think the rules above could shake things up just a smidge. It&rsquo;d at least give them something to account for.</p>

<p>At the end of the day though, rules aside, you&rsquo;re still talking about a team with Steph, Klay, KD, Dray, and more. They were completely insane.</p>

      <label for="l6ujpu1" class="commentText"><p>Ironically, I think Klay and Draymond would do BETTER with the 04 rules and Curry would suffer a little bit more, namely going to the basket because of the gather step portion. However, I think the real person who would be a bit shocking is the KD drop-off. KD’s biggest knock was always the question of if he could handle the league’s physicality but he didn’t really have to because as he got better the league also was giving more offensive incentive and protection. If KD had to go back in time and deal with some of that early 2000s defense, I think he would actually suffer a bit more than people expected with people getting all up into him without as much fear. He doesn’t rely on gather step manipulation as much but the physicality might actually be his undoing.</p>

<p>Also there are definitely some other teams that could&rsquo;ve given the 2017 Warriors problems. 2013 Heat come to mind. They could match up with small ball, they have prime LeBron with shooters around him and Wade wasn&rsquo;t washed just yet. I&rsquo;d still take that Warriors team over anyone in a hypothetical 7 games series though.</p>

<p>Oh and even more amazing is that he can keep up with the Warriors on stamina. Even last year the Warriors were still being shut down by LeBron’s defensive awareness.</p>

A series doesn’t get much closer. Then KD just completely ruined it. Ruined everyone’s legacy’s too. Curry’s and his because no one appreciates those rings and LeBron’s because people get to mention how he’s been swept in the finals twice now</p>

Obviously the big one is going to GS rather than staying with Oklahoma and winning, but it also would have been better if he stayed with GS and dominated the league, winning like 5-6 with them. Then he left and they won without him, and then didn’t give the nets a real chance, leaving them rather than winning there as well. </p>

There will come a day where we can&rsquo;t really run any faster or jump any higher and all of the gains are marginal without augmentation in some way, be it prosthetics or doping.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen LeBron James be the most athletic player in the league for basically the last 20 years. There is currently no one in the NBA with the size athleticism combo of Shaq.</p>

<p>I think the overall skill and tactics floor has gotten higher than the overall athleticism floor over the last 20 years. Even then, a lot of that development is rules focused too. Taking out some of the big uglies in the post, and replacing them with highly skilled wings. That&rsquo;s probably done more to raise the skill and athleticism floor than anything else.</p>

<p>Edit: I just think things like being able to instantly and easily watch all of the game film you want, whenever and wherever you want, as well as medical technology and knowledge as far as how to take care of your body has had a far greater impact on the game than somehow humans have magically evolved over the last 20-30 years to be so much more athletic.</p>

<p>Like, just the film aspect alone is so massive. Think about how many NBA games back in the day are just lost to history because no one filmed them. Think about how insane that is in the context of today.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Hey coach, I&rsquo;d like to get some film spliced up of my opponent this week. I&rsquo;d like to study his tendencies so I can force him off his spots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry. There&rsquo;s no game film.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no game film?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, sorry. Nobody filmed it.&rdquo;</p>

Young Kawhi would be a big problem for KD, Duncan and Boris Diaw were great at protecting the paint and midrange, Parker and Manu could stretch the Warriors defense and the Spurs’ bench was significantly better than the Warriors.</p>

<p>They didn’t have the pure scorers of Golden State, but the Spurs had size and experience. Diaw was a great primary ball handler, not sure Green would do well in that matchup. Duncan in the post helped setup the inside-out game and Kawhi was a monster on D.</p>

<p>Lebron’s Heat teams were probably better playoff teams than the KD Warriors. Bosch, Wade and Lebron could slow the game down and then attack downhill.</p>

Iguodala on MJ with Klay and KD and even Draymond able to switch on him, same obviously goes for Pippen. Definitely won’t be “stopping” MJ but big and good enough to make it slightly harder.</p>

<p>Rodman on the backside off switches would be tough on the glass no doubt. Would be the 96 Bulls only chance to reverse the math in their favor in this theoretical matchup.</p>

      <label for="l6tsdvv" class="commentText"><p>Lol back then the teams offenses weren&rsquo;t yet evolved and haven&rsquo;t figured out how to generate offense like teams of today have.  The early 2000s introduced zone defense and teams were used to playing heavy isos in the 90&rsquo;s so they were pretty much shell shocked at the defenses could do. The defense according to the numbers were great then because the offenses weren&rsquo;t that great, so you can argue that those numbers are inflated.</p>

<p>A modern nba team would destroy a team from back then just based off of the knowledge they have to generate offense that an old school team wouldn&rsquo;t have. This is why its foolish to compare eras and say things like &ldquo;the 85 _______ would easily destroy the 17 Warriors &ldquo;. 😂</p>

      <label for="l6ugnsr" class="commentText"><blockquote>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t even score 100 pts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Warriors-Pistons debate aside, it&rsquo;s not so much that the Pistons were incapable of scoring 100 points as much as it was just a prodcut of the rules and playstyle of the era.</p>

<p>As the NBA made of point of catering back toward the offensive side of the ball as the 2000s progressed, the Pistons followed. By &lsquo;08, that same core of Pistons were at times scoring in the 130s, 120s, and 110s.</p>

<p>Of course, the league continued to change as the 2010s came through. And in a hypothetical matchup with any 2010s team, the 2004 Pistons would have to account for that. But it&rsquo;s not as though a guy like Chauncey Billups didn&rsquo;t understand what scoring basketball looked like.</p>

<p>That being said, I&rsquo;m of the opinion that any team in history would have their hands full with the prime version of the Warriors.</p>

      <label for="l6ua9tx" class="commentText"><p>thats the real answer. &ldquo;kept up in the first 2 quarters&rdquo; is no real indication either way. Spurs fans will point to it as proof it&rsquo;s doable, Warriors fans will point to it as proof that&rsquo;s all the Spurs could muster up and it would&rsquo;ve ended there.</p>

<p>As a Spurs fan, it&rsquo;s nice to think it&rsquo;s doable of course but eh we&rsquo;ll never really know is the reality. Moot debate imo.</p>

But only because they had the GOAT at his peak and coincidentally match up very well with the Warriors&rsquo; perimeter scoring threats on the defensive end in a 2018 Rockets like way. Their 2,3,4 all made the All-Defensive 1st team that season, and Ron Harper was also a great defender. Their only weak defensive position: center, also happens to be the Warriors&rsquo; weakest offensive position.</p>

<p>Pistons shot 968 3pointers at 34% in 2004</p>

<p>Warriors shot 2562 at 38% in 2017</p>

<p>So are the Pistons shooting more 3 pointers in 2017? Are the Warriors shooting less 3 pointers in 2004?</p>

<p>both teams ranked #1 in 3point percentage defense so that&rsquo;s interesting too</p>

      <label for="l6uk1sp" class="commentText"><p>I agree the game is both fairer and more interesting under 2004 rules.</p>

<p>I still have absolutely no clue what you do with Steph, and his warping of the very geometry of the game (especially if we assume, though there’s no reason to I guess, that 04 Detroit, preceding even the Nash Suns, would be strategically prepared for a player like him) in a one-game situation, or even a 7-game series.</p>

<p>Everything else, including the Kevin Durant of it all, I think the Pistons could more or less handle (and I think they’d also present more of a challenge for the Warriors defensively than it would appear at first glance). But man… tf do you do about Steph?</p>

The 2017 Warriors just stress a defense in a lot more ways than any offense did in the early 2000&rsquo;s, even the good ones. Don&rsquo;t think the ruleset would matter that much.</p>

      <label for="l6u6wdt" class="commentText"><p>The 2004 Detroit Pistons would be in shock and awe that a guy is shooting 3 pointers well. They would also be completely stunned by the athleticism of KD and Iggy. As opposed to those athletic scrubs LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, T-Mac, and Vince Carter, whom they saw on a regular basis (LeBron was in their division for almost the entirety of the existence of the Goin to Work Pistons).</p>

<p>The 17 Warriors are beating the 04 Pistons but some of these takes are nuts.</p>

      <label for="l6u8xr8" class="commentText"><p>We&rsquo;re not discounting the athleticism of LeBron Vince etc., but you&rsquo;re just choosing to ignore the fact that there&rsquo;s no comparison to KD in their era. KD was unique when he got drafted in 2007. Their closest comparison would have been KG, who averaged 23/11/4 against the Pistons with less 3pt shooting, handles and playmaking ability, and on the mid-2000s Timberwolves.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not even accounting there&rsquo;s a whole different type of defense associated with stopping Steph Curry offball. The 2004 Pistons never ran a top lock the way you need to to stop Steph catching the ball. They also never faced Draymond at the top of the key with the need to defend a DHO and floppy at the baseline simultaneously.</p>

      <label for="l6tnplb" class="commentText"><p>but the rest of that 2004 Lakers rotation was extremely unremarkable (especially in hindsight):</p>

<ul>
<li>40 year old Karl Malone</li>
<li>35 year old Gary Payton</li>
<li>Derrick Fisher</li>
<li>Devean George</li>
<li>Stanislav Medvedenko</li>
</ul>

<p>Comparing that supporting cast versus the 2017 Warriors&rsquo; (Draymond, Klay, Iguodala, Livingston, Zaza, David West, even JaVale McGee) really isn&rsquo;t even fair. So even if we simply concede the generous premise that Shaq/Kobe were a better foundation duo than Steph/KD, I still don&rsquo;t think that 2004 Lakers team can be considered a proxy for the 67-15 (16-1 in playoffs) 2017 Warriors.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Why? The 2017 Warriors had David West, Zaza Pachulia, Draymond, and Matt Barnes. No shortage of goonery. What&rsquo;s the argument that they were &ldquo;soft&rdquo;? Is it the thing where people hate Draymond so they convince themselves that means he&rsquo;s a paper tiger and &ldquo;fake tough guy&rdquo;? That seems awfully convenient.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been saying for a long time that Rasheed would be one of the most aught after commodities in the NBA, today. He was an all NBA caliber defender (for sure a better on-ball interior defender than Ben Wallace), and could score effectively at multiple levels. Replace KAT with Sheed, and the Wolves are NBA Champs.</p>

He was my favorite player outside of the Mavs and when i saw the notification i was like floating. It still doesn’t even feel real. It really feels like a dream watching Luka and Kyrie hit the most beautiful tough shots ever together. I’m not taking any of these moments and emotions for granted</p>

Anyway Handchecking IS in the game now, in a similar capacity to Zone in the 90s, where it is played but refs get them for it occasionally. And then in the playoffs the refs almost entirely stop calling it, and let things play out.</p>

<p>They are the GOAT team and people are still complaining about them being too good for the league. Do not talk to me about comparing them to a non top tier champion, especially when Rasheed is saying they would’ve destroyed them, that’s a dumb take.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>happens with every era honestly, we&rsquo;re seeing that in real time with how people talk about the 2000s and even 2010s. I remember in the mid to late 2000s, oldheads back THEN were talking about how much softer the game had become. Guys like Pau and Dirk were the poster boys for how &ldquo;big men are becoming soft.&rdquo; And now we see that SAME discourse happening. It&rsquo;s fucken hilarious cause you know nostalgia is twisting people&rsquo;s memories, and/or nephews really didn&rsquo;t watch basketball back then.</p>

Or probably a rivalry that got torched during their dynasty run and just hates them. It’s really not close. A lot of folks don’t understand or remember the Warriors were also the top defensive teams in the league. Their defense was often overlooked due to their offense. Their offensive rating is the best in NBA history and by far, leaps better than Pistons 04</p>

<p>Billups was pretty much their only ball handler. If the Warriors blitz him, who&rsquo;s gonna make the next play? <a href="https://youtu.be/AQr54Toq5eA?si=JWk0H6omE-iy4c2e&amp;t=57" target="_blank">The Warriors during that time can blitz and not get burned because they easily recover.</a></p>

<p>Ben Wallace was pretty much Gobert from today but much shorter. Gobert easily gets played off the court. <a href="https://youtu.be/QkLmR3ka4Mo?si=H9JgwzOECUmOC2Iy&amp;t=40" target="_blank">How would Ben and Sheed guard Draymond the moment he gets the defensive rebound and 3 secs in, he has dribbled into the paint on the other side?</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Steph is not a defender,” Wallace added. “He would&rsquo;ve had to guard Rip. How many screens was Rip coming off? Or whoever they would’ve tried to put at point, they would have been too little for Chauncey&hellip; I&rsquo;m saying, back then</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That Warriors team switched everything. Rip would&rsquo;ve switch to Klay, KD, Draymond, or Iguodala. He&rsquo;s not scoring from them.</p>

Isaiah Thomas, Joe Dumars and Vinnie Johnson are (small g) gods to me. But…my Pistons don’t want any parts of that ‘17 Warriors team. In the flat out history of the game, that Warriors squad with KD was probably one of the closest things to perfection that we’ve witnessed. And let’s not forget, this was with a healthy “two-way” Klay, locking down the opponents best guard so Steph could stay outta foul trouble. That team could score like breathing and turned right around and played suffocating Defense(pun intended), switching on everything. In a playoff series, I think Chauncey would’ve willed his team to 1 victory. But the dubs were just way too loaded. And finally, let’s not overlook Steve Kerr’s imprint. He basically merged the triangle offense (that dominated the 90’s) with that split action offense that Malone and Stockton perfected and then just to be an asshole sprinkled in variations from the spurs offense that dominated the 2000’s. They literally were averaging 300 passes per game! It was the start of that turning down a great shot for a better shot stuff that everyone is doing now. Pistons would have 0 chance against that team. Sorry.</p>

      <label for="l6twmsr" class="commentText"><p>The answer is simple: the 2017 Dubs are unbeatable in any era because no other era could possibly keep up with the 3 point shooting.  You can try to bully the fuck out of the Dubs all you want, but you can’t compete with their 3 point shooting.  The entire field of basketball analytics is centered around the 3 point shot being the best shot in basketball.  The team that is the best at shooting the best shot will win all the time.  And let’s be real, in the modern NBA, I love him, but Ben Wallace is an unplayable player.  He is too much of a negative on offense and is one of the worst free throw shooter ever.  He would get the Ben Simmons in Philly against the Hawks treatment.</p>
