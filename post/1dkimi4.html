      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dkimi4/oc_i_took_notes_on_every_possession_from_the_1998/"><p>[OC] I took notes on every possession from the 1998 NBA Finals Game 6, with in-depth analysis on many plays. Wanted to share the notes with this community.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>As a Utah Jazz fan, this game broke my heart as a 7 year old kid. Years later, I became obsessed with this game as it was the most watched NBA game in NBA history, and there is a ton to unpack within the game. Yet, most people just focus on &ldquo;The Shot&rdquo; at the end of the game. So, I decided to take notes on every play from the game, as well as contextual notes relating to injuries, strategies, and other thoughts. Below are the notes with timestamps based on the video on NBA.com. I typically jotted the timestamp at the end of the play, so you&rsquo;ll need to go back ~15 seconds from the timestamp usually.</p>

<p>In case you&rsquo;d like to view the most important play notes rather than all plays, I tried to append those notes with &ldquo;Key play&rdquo;, so you can control F and search for that to find the best plays with notes. Also, I did upload a video analysis on this game to YouTube, but didn&rsquo;t want to link to it here due to self promotion reasons, but you can find it on YouTube.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Scottie Pippen&rsquo;s back injury is a key part of this game that the Jazz failed to take advantage of.</p></li>

<li><p>The Bulls were successful in using their size advantage in the backcourt against the Jazz guards in the low post.</p></li>

<li><p>Neither team ran much pick and roll in this game, it was a low post based game.</p></li>

<li><p>The Bulls committed a ton of illegal defense calls in this game. Illegal defense in the 1990s was when a man would cover an area of the floor and not commit to guarding one player. The Bulls got called for this a ton due to trying to halfway help on Malone in the post, but not commit to double-teaming him.</p></li>

<li><p>Michael Jordan struggled down the stretch to hit jumpers, but he got to the line a ton. He made his shots earlier in the game and was super aggressive due to Pippen&rsquo;s back injury.</p></li>

<li><p>Greg Foster and Adam Keefe made numerous mistakes throughout this game, and while the Jazz executed well on a lot of occasions, overall they made too many simple mistakes. I typically appended my notes with &ldquo;ugh&rdquo; after these instances.</p></li>

<li><p>The Jazz got a strong contribution from Howard Eisley in this game</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>1:05 Ahmad Rashad reports Scottie Pippen is suffering from a back injury</p>

<p>1:40 Jim Grey reports Ron Harper Flu like symptoms and Howard Eisley is suffering from vertigo</p>

<p>1:55 Malone wants to be aggressive with few outside shots</p>

<p><strong>Game</strong></p>

<p>2:44 Pippen low post entry vs Hornacek, Stockton doubles, Pippen kicks out to Harper, Harper re-enters to post and Pippen scores</p>

<p>3:00 Malone post up gets hit before shot almost travels and throws it away to MJ</p>

<p>3:20 Bulls run split action Stockton goes under screen on Harper. Pindown for MJ, Hornacek goes under, MJ misses jumper</p>

<p>3:37 Malone gets ball in the post, Stockton slips the split action and cuts through to the paint, Malone hits jumper</p>

<p>3:48 Bulls Low post entry to Longley, Stockton helps from corner, Harper Backdoor cuts baseline but Malone deflects the pass</p>

<p>4:21 Pippen low post vs Hornacek, Stockton doubles, Bulls kick it out and swing to Kukoc who misses perimeter shot. Hornacek gets rebound but runs into Stockton and loses the ball. Pippen posts up and passes to Kukoc for easy layup. Ugh.</p>

<p>4:48 Jazz run UCLA cut for Hornacek, MJ gets clipped by screen and Stockton assists Hornacek for layup. Key play.</p>

<p>5:04 Bulls set up the triangle and have Kukoc fan out from the elbow to the wing, and have Pippen curl cut with off ball screens from the corner to the post. He gets bumped a couple times and while this is happening Kukoc dribbles into a pull-up and makes it.</p>

<p>5:28 Jazz once again go to Malone in the post, he is fronted, they pass over the defense to him and he draws a shooting foul on a layup.</p>

<p>6:31 Doug Collins says Jerry Sloan is already complaining about illegal defense. On the last play with Longley fronting Malone in the post, MJ was cheating off of Hornacek around the free throw line.</p>

<p>5:42 Pippen wincing due to his back. 6:49 Harper has early post up vs Stockton, gets deep position and draws foul</p>

<p>7:17 Harper really battling with Stockton for low post position. Gets it and they run split action, Hornacek and Keefe go under with Pippen not being a shooting threat. Harper tries to kick out to Kukoc but Keefe steals it.</p>

<p>7:22 Hornacek gets the ball on the fast break but just loses the dribble WTF.</p>

<p>7:27 Harper draws shooting foul on transition layup</p>

<p>8:36 Stockton gets ready for Malone to receive off ball screen for post position. As Malone is going through the screen, Harper is forcing Stockton baseline as if preparing to ice a pick and roll. Stockton cuts baseline for layup. Key play.</p>

<p>8:54 Pippen continually trying to post up on Hornacek, the Bulls are running their triangle actions while he tries to post a second time but gets called for three seconds. I don’t agree with the call. The Bulls are trying to post up Hornacek and Stockton every chance they get, but MJ hasn’t been posting up, just Harper and Pippen so far.</p>

<p>9:19 Hornacek sets baseline screen for Malone to get post position. Hornacek cuts to corner to enter to the post. After entry, they run split action but Hornacek slips (both times they have slipped the action). Malone draws foul. 9:38 Hornacek misses shot off Pindown.</p>

<p>9:48 MJ finally posts up Stockton and quickly hits a turnaround fadeaway. Very little energy spent, he’s picking his spots well. 10:05 Malone gets ball in the post and gets fouled by Harper doubling him and reaching in.</p>

<p>10:18 Rodman checks in for Longley</p>

<p>10:29 Hornacek sets rip screen for Malone to get into post, then pops and gets the ball free throw line extended. He’s trying to enter to the post but Pippen helps off Keefe who cuts, forcing help off of Russell. Hornacek passes to Russell who misses a three.</p>

<p>10:52 Pippen hits post hook against Keefe.</p>

<p>11:14 Jazz finally go to Stockton Malone pick and roll. Harper goes under screen, Stockton misses a three.</p>

<p>11:24 Jazz get a steal (Hornacek steals from Pippen after risky drive and pass by MJ)</p>

<p>11:29 Hornacek misses transition layup ugh.</p>

<p>12:20 Pippen gets deep post position on Hornacek but kicks out to Harper after Stockton digs. Harper misses three.</p>

<p>12:47 Russell is fronted in post Stockton throws him a lob but he misses the layup ugh.</p>

<p>13:03 Pippen curl cuts off three man action (Kukoc fans out from elbow) to get into the post, Russell helps (hedges) off MJ who pops out for three. Key play.</p>

<p>13:29 Hornacek sets baseline screen to get Malone in post position. Malone gets ball in the post, MJ points at the ground telling Rodman to plug middle and force him baseline. Malone sort of euro steps into MJ who strips him. Key play.</p>

<p>13:37 Pippen posts Keefe. Russell helps, they kick and swing to Kukoc. He pump fakes, takes one dribble in, and passes to Harper under the basket wide open for uncontested layup. Key play. on rewatch, Russell takes bad route back to Kukoc after digging. Ball gets kicked out to Rodman way beyond three point line (not shooting threat. Stockton has to help off Harper to cover Kukoc which is why Harper can get the layup. Also, Malone provides nothing defensively on this possession and has no instincts.</p>

<p>14:06 Pippen asks out of the game to stretch his back.</p>

<p>14:42 Antoine Carr enters the game and draws a foul in the post. Some sloppy play before the post entry but an example of Hornacek screen for Malone post position and then running decoy action using off ball screens.</p>

<p>15:05 Malone jostling for post position and Kukoc is in illegal position, he recognizes this and tries to get above free throw line but it’s too late. After timeout (14:08) Sloan might be complaining to officials about illegal defense and definitely is during this possession. on rewatch, super interesting play!! Eisley sets Pindown for Malone which forces Harper to switch onto Malone. Malone signals to Russell that he wants to get into the post and throws it to him to get post position on mismatch. Meanwhile Rodman is switched onto Eisley, and when Eisley runs around screens, Rodman tries to shove Kukoc to signal him to switch onto Eisley, but then Kukoc decides to get into illegal position and has his “oh shit” moment</p>

<p>15:24 UCLA cut from Eisley but this flows into him setting a back screen for a Hornacek cut to the basket. Malone has ball at elbow and nice assist to cutting Hornacek. Key play. miscommunication by Bulls. MJ wanted Harper to switch but Harper was a split second late on the switch.</p>

<p>15:46 MJ gets ball at elbow for iso during decoy three man action. He misses pull-up over Russell</p>

<p>15:51 Malone is cross matched on Kukoc so forces the issue by sprinting back on offense, and Kukoc shoves him down but no foul. Malone continues to try to get post position vs Kukoc but is fronted. Then MJ is called for illegal defense. Once again, MJ realizes he is illegal and tries to get out but too late. MJ signaled to Rodman during the play, maybe to try to have him switch onto Malone, but he didn’t listen and then MJ gets mad at him after the whistle. but Sloan gets called for his own technical complaining about Kukoc shoving Malone to the ground.</p>

<p>17:25 Rodman is called for a foul on Malone as Malone tries to get post position.</p>

<p>It seems that posting up is so much more important in this era of basketball due to the illegal defense rules for the Jazz, and due to the mismatches that the Bulls can take advantage of with the small Jazz backcourt.</p>

<p>18:26 Jazz are pressuring the Bulls, Bulls actually run a double flash and Kukoc misses perimeter shot.</p>

<p>18:39 Bulls finally wait until Malone catches in the post to send the double. Kukoc doubles (length) off of Carr, the Jazz swing it and the Bulls rotate. Carr hits turnaround fadeaway over Kukoc.</p>

<p>18:55 Bulls call timeout as clearly Kukoc can’t handle Carr in the post but Rodman has Malone.</p>

<p>19:48 “Seldom used” Bill Wennington checks in to guard Carr</p>

<p>20:01 MJ vs Russell in low post, Hornacek with late double, kick out to Burrell and repost but Russell deflects it out of bounds.</p>

<p>20:21 MJ misses tough pull-up (there was only 3 seconds left on shot clock) Burrell and Russell dive for the ball and Jazz get the rebound.</p>

<p>20:27 Hornacek hits transition pull-up three</p>

<p>20:52 Bulls run grenade action (split action into handoff) for MJ, which flows into post up. Stockton doubles and retreats, then Hornacek doubles and shot clock violation.</p>

<p>21:40 Eisley Malone pnr is iced, Eisley rejects the screen and kicks to Malone on pop. He makes a move and hits a jumper.</p>

<p>22:01 MJ misses pull-up but Rodman gets rebound. Kerr drive and kick to Wennington who hits jumper.</p>

<p>22:20 Malone in post and MJ gets another illegal defense (Doug Collins says he is two zones below his man)</p>

<p>23:06 Malone and Rodman slap each other on the ass</p>

<p>23:16 Chris Morris makes his first appearance for the Jazz</p>

<p>23:56 Eisley Malone pnr iced Eisley rejects and pocket pass to Malone who sort of euro steps and hits tough floater. Key play.</p>

<p>24:15 MJ isos and hits mid range pull-up over Russell</p>

<p>24:36 Malone in back and forth UCLA action isos on Wennington, and gets and 1.</p>

<p>25:53 Greg Foster checks in right before end of 1st quarter.</p>

<p>26:11 MJ top of key iso is doubled by Eisley and misses jumper.</p>

<p>26:23 Pippen in locker room</p>

<p>26:49 Bob Costas points out as Jazz are up three after 1st quarter that the Jazz were able to make a run with Eisley on the floor. 17-5 run with Stockton on the bench!</p>

<p>27:13 Shandon Anderson checks in and immediately posts up and scores</p>

<p>28:07 Bulls run split action and Greg Foster gets a steal but then loses the ball out of bounds lol.</p>

<p>28:38 commentary on how with Pippen out and MJ needing rest who is going to provide offense for Bulls?</p>

<p>28:54 Bulls get the ball to Kukoc in mid post looking to playmake and run Pindown for Wennington but he travels</p>

<p>29:25 Jazz look to post up Shandon Anderson again but Bulls get called for their fourth illegal defense. This time on Buechler</p>

<p>30:10 Jazz post up Shandon Anderson again. Rodman doubles off Carr who dives, Kukoc helps on the dive off of Greg Foster, Foster gets a pass while on the move and then throws the ball out of bounds. Ugh. Chris Morris cuts and probably should have stayed at the perimeter for better spacing.</p>

<p>30:32 Kukoc runs pinch post handoff and takes jumper but misses. 30:40 Carr misses short transition jumper.</p>

<p>30:56 Kukoc looks like he is going to run curl cut on three man game but Backdoor cuts for a layup. Key play.</p>

<p>31:22 Carr posts up, Kukoc doubles off Foster who dives, Burrell helps off Eisley with the dive, so Carr kicks out to Shandon Anderson but the pass is long. Eisley recovers it and hits a deep three but it’s incorrectly called a shot clock violation.</p>

<p>32:21 incorrect call replay</p>

<p>32:53 beautiful triangle ATO play Buechler jumper. Key play. MJ gets screen to cut for post position while Rodman gets ball in post and fakes a pass to MJ. Buechler dives while Rodman kicks it out to Kerr. Three man game for MJ coming off two off ball screens, Buechler pops for the jumper.</p>

<p>33:20 Malone gets ball in post. MJ doubles, Malone kicks out to Shandon Anderson who re-enters to post. Malone drives past Rodman but Longley helps on drive and Malone misses tough running floater.</p>

<p>33:50 Kerr commits moving screen offensive foul on pinch post handoff with MJ.</p>

<p>34:20 Buechler fouls Russell in the post.</p>

<p>34:42 Jazz go back to Russell in the post. He is double, kicks it out and they swing to Carr up top. He enters to Malone in the post who travels.</p>

<p>35:13 MJ misses pick and roll (from wing) mid range pull-up.</p>

<p>35:20 Carr hits transition pull-up jumper. 35:45 MJ low post (weak side pinch post) footwork layup. Key play.</p>

<p>36:03 Malone posts up and forces the issue despite Kerr digging and Longley helping. Misses but then follows up for a layup.</p>

<p>36:25 Kukoc Longley pnr, Anderson gaps off of MJ, Rodman also sets flare screen for MJ who hits wide open three. Key play.</p>

<p>36:42 Anderson is top blocked, Stockton lobs to Anderson who draws help from Longley off of Carr. Anderson dump off assist to Carr.</p>

<p>37:06 misc Triangle play. MJ penetration, Stockton gaps off of Kerr but masterful dribbling by MJ avoids turnover. Kicks to Kerr who draws help from Russell off Kukoc, who hits perimeter jumper.</p>

<p>37:30 Stockton UCLA cut into back screen for Malone. Malone is fronted in the post by Rodman but receives lob pass from Russell. Malone goes under the basket and takes a fadeaway and misses, Carr offensive rebound and misses putback but draws shooting foul.</p>

<p>38:47 Bulls don’t really run anything. As they’re getting the triangle set up MJ drives on Anderson, and draws shooting foul on Carr.</p>

<p>39:50 Stockton UCLA cut into rip screen for Malone to get post position. Malone gets ball in the post, draws help from Kukoc off of Russell who dives, MJ helps off of Anderson on Russell’s dive, Malone kicks to a cutting Anderson who misses floater over Kukoc. I think Anderson would be better shooting a three here since MJ had to help on Russell.</p>

<p>40:07 MJ posts Russell, draws help from Hornacek off of Harper, MJ kicks to Harper who is also getting a flare screen from Kukoc, but doesn’t take the shot and they reset. Harper passes to Kukoc at top of key and he throws lob to MJ spinning into a Backdoor alley oop from the pinch post. Key play.</p>

<p>40:33 Malone gets ball in the post and quickly kicks to Hornacek as MJ doubles. Hornacek re-enters the ball to Malone, MJ doubles again and gets deflection, play becomes messy from there with multiple point blank misses until Malone gets a layup. Isiah Thomas points out that Rodman isn’t contesting in order to avoid foul trouble.</p>

<p>41:04 Bulls enter to Rodman in the post, Stockton knocks it out of bounds.</p>

<p>41:26 Harper runs pnr out of the corner, Stockton gaps off of Kerr, Harper kicks it to Kerr who enters to MJ in the post. MJ pump fakes and travels.</p>

<p>41:45 Stockton UCLA cut into back screen for Malone and gets ball on the pop, then high low pass to Malone with deep post position and he gets a layup. Key play.</p>

<p>41:59 Harper posts up Hornacek and the Bulls run split action with MJ and Kerr. Russell goes under the screen and MJ hits a three. Key play.</p>

<p>42:11 Malone gets ball in the post, Jazz run split action with Anderson and Stockton. Stockton is at the top and fakes a Backdoor cut but then pops out as Anderson goes into the paint. Malone fakes a pass to Anderson then hits a turnaround fadeaway.</p>

<p>42:34 Kukoc gets ball on the wing and simply drives in for a layup.</p>

<p>42:49 Hornacek runs UCLA cut into off ball screens, Malone gets ball at high post, Russell sets second off ball screen then pops out and receives a pass. Beautiful action but doesn’t materialize anything. Russell isos and hits a jumper anyway.</p>

<p>43:16 Bulls swing the ball as MJ gets off ball screen for shuffle cut towards the opposite side of the floor to get post position. He gets the ball and quickly gets into a tough move vs Russell and hits a pull-up. Very assertive and dominant move from MJ. Key play.</p>

<p>43:41 Anderson sets rip screen to get Malone into post position, then pops out and receives pass from Stockton, and passes back to Stockton at the wing to enter the ball to Malone. Jazz run split action with Stockton and Hornacek, and Hornacek hits perimeter shot from the corner. Key play.</p>

<p>44:36 Angry MJ</p>

<p>44:56 MJ gets ball in the post vs Russell, and easily hits turnaround fadeaway. MJ really hitting his rhythm. Key play.</p>

<p>45:12 Malone gets ball in the post and Hornacek cuts through to the paint. Kukoc doubles and Russell gets pass at the top of the key. MJ rotates off of Anderson to cover Russell. Russell drives the close out as Anderson cuts to the basket and Hornacek lifts to the perimeter uncovered. Russell passes to Hornacek who misses a wide open three.</p>

<p>45:34 MJ posts up Russell again and finally misses a turnaround fadeaway, but Anderson loses the rebound out of bounds.</p>

<p>46:30 This time MJ posts up Hornacek, takes another turnaround fadeaway and misses again.</p>

<p>46:43 Stockton enters the ball to Malone in the post, then runs split action with Carr but slips into the paint for an easy layup. Poor defense by MJ falling asleep. Key play.</p>

<p>47:19 MJ takes pull-up three over Hornacek (two for one attempt?) and misses.</p>

<p>47:40 As Hornacek is setting baseline screen for Malone to get post position, Stockton instead drives and draws foul. 48:08 SLOB Russell give and go with Malone Backdoor cutting layup. Key play.</p>

<p>48:18 MJ almost makes half court shot at the halftime buzzer.</p>

<p>48:43 Pippen starting the second half after receiving treatment on his back and is no longer having back spasms.</p>

<p>49:00 Malone posts up or faces up vs Longley, gets the step driving baseline and gets an easy layup.</p>

<p>49:22 Pippen posts up Hornacek, Bulls run split action with MJ and Kukoc. Kukoc takes corner three and misses.</p>

<p>49:40 awful possession for the Jazz. Stockton Malone pick and roll but Harper gets over screen and bumps Stockton off his spot, Stockton gets no separation and kicks it to Russell who pump fakes a terrible shot, then passes back to Stockton who takes a lot clock jumper and misses. Keefe gets rebound but is blocked by Pippen for a shot clock violation.</p>

<p>50:25 Harper posts up Stockton, Bulls run split action but nothing materializes. This flows into a Pindown for Longley who resets the offense to Pippen. Pippen enters the ball to Kukoc in the post vs Keefe with 4 seconds on the shot clock. Kukoc easily drives past Keefe for an easy layup. At this point, Adam Keefe is a liability on both ends of the floor.</p>

<p>50:49 Malone posts up Longley, Jazz run split action with Stockton and Russell. Stockton gets ball on the pop and resets, but quickly enters the ball to Malone who is being fronted by Longley. Malone draws foul on a layup but it’s not a shooting foul.</p>

<p>51:03 Pippen moving gingerly due to back injury.</p>

<p>51:13 Russell is jostling for post position with Kukoc, but then sets rip screen for Malone to get post position. Meanwhile, Stockton decides to drive on Harper but stumbles, Harper recovers the ball after diving and calls timeout.</p>

<p>51:35 Pippen posts Hornacek at the elbow (pinch post) and looks for MJ coming off curl cut but shoots over Hornacek and misses.</p>

<p>51:51 UCLA cut for Stockton, who veers back as if to set back screen but sets it on the opposite (top) side, but Malone goes down into post anyway. Malone drives baseline vs Longley and draws another foul.</p>

<p>52:32 Malone gets ball in the post, Stockton cuts through the paint, Kukoc doubles off of Russell, Malone kicks out to Russell who misses a three. Malone offensive rebound, Rodman is called for a loose ball foul.</p>

<p>53:17 Malone gets post position, Stockton tries to enter it but passes to Hornacek, Hornacek tries to get it back to Stockton to re-enter the ball but Harper is physical with Stockton bumping him out of position. Hornacek drives on MJ who falls asleep defensively and then commits shooting foul on Hornacek. Jazz have Bulls in the penalty with only a few minutes into the third quarter</p>

<p>54:13 MJ receives step up screen from Kukoc and hits mid range pull-up over Keefe. Jerry Sloan is upset that Keefe did not show on the screen - once again Keefe has been awful on both ends this game.</p>

<p>54:30 Hornacek UCLA cuts, Rodman plays the passing lane which leaves Malone open for an elbow jumper which he misses.</p>

<p>54:50 MJ and Kukoc run the same step up screen but on the other side of the floor, this time Russell goes under the screen and MJ resets. Harper posts up Stockton, Hornacek doubles off of Pippen so Harper kicks out to Pippen, Pippen re-enters to Harper who hits jump hook over Stockton. Key play.</p>

<p>The Jazz are overreacting to Pippen as a perimeter threat with his back injury. Pippen is not a shooting threat but he is a post threat still. Hornacek should ignore him on the perimeter - this will come back to bite the Jazz.</p>

<p>55:18 Hornacek sets rip screen for Malone to get post position, and Hornacek receives a pass from Stockton on the pop and then immediately enters to Malone with deep post position, but Malone misses and is upset there is no foul call.</p>

<p>55:36 Kukoc posts Keefe, Stockton helps and Kukoc kicks out to Rodman. Bulls reset with Harper posting up Stockton, and he draws a foul.</p>

<p>56:05 MJ runs off of two off ball screens, takes a dribble and shoots and misses. Rodman dives for the loose ball but can’t get it.</p>

<p>56:34 Hornacek sets rip screen for Malone to get post position. Stockton enters the ball but it goes through Malone’s legs and Rodman takes it. Ugh</p>

<p>56:48 Kukoc posts Chris Morris (seconds earlier Isiah Thomas says he would play Antoine Carr instead and wouldn’t mess around with Chris Morris) and misses easy layup after spinning baseline.</p>

<p>56:58 in semi transition, Stockton tries to drive on Harper and get a layup, but it’s a miserable attempt and goes out of bounds.</p>

<p>I don’t understand why Stockton is trying to be so aggressive driving offensively vs a great and bigger defender in Harper. Why not get open shots against him via split action?</p>

<p>57:19 Doug Collins says Pippen signaled to MJ he didn’t want to bring the ball up, MJ does not want to bring the ball up. MJ is running out of gas and Pippen is struggling with the back injury.</p>

<p>57:37 MJ elbow iso is disrupted, he takes an awful shot right before the shot clock expires and misses, but Rodman gets the offensive rebound. But Malone pokes it away from Rodman and the Jazz recover it.</p>

<p>57:51 Rodman and Malone are tripping each other while moving up the court, and the whistle is blown.</p>

<p>58:22 Malone and Rodman tripping each other</p>

<p>59:10 MJ and Russell extra curricular activity bumping each other.</p>

<p>1:00:22 Bulls set up the triangle and Stockton denies post entry. Kukoc flashes from pinch post to free throw line area but doesn’t run blind pig for MJ, instead runs Chicago action for Pippen. Pippen enters the ball to MJ in the post vs Russell. Hornacek stunts off Pippen so MJ kicks out to Pippen and Hornacek overcompensates recovering back to Pippen, Pippen re-enters to MJ who hits turnaround fadeaway. Key play.</p>

<p>once again Hornacek is way overreacting to Pippen as a perimeter threat when he has a back injury and cannot shoot. Awful defensive execution by the Jazz.</p>

<p>1:00:58 Hornacek UCLA cut, doesn’t get the pass, Rodman overplays Malone at the elbow, Malone slips Backdoor and receives a pass and draws shooting foul on Pippen.</p>

<p>1:01:12 Hornacek overreacting on close out to Pippen on the perimeter and MJ hitting turnaround fadeaway. As commentators are saying, make Pippen make one of those shots before leaving MJ alone in the low post.</p>

<p>1:01:59 MJ Rodman pick and roll, Jazz are shrinking the floor with Stockton gapping off of Harper. Hornacek is completely lost on defense ball watching the pick and roll as he is navigating a flare screen by Kukoc and expecting Pippen to be getting open for a corner three, but Pippen is cutting to the basket for an easy layup, but he misses. Rodman gets the offensive rebound and putback layup.</p>

<p>At this point, the Jazz and Hornacek are committing defensive malpractice focusing this much on Pippen on the perimeter vs anything going on inside.</p>

<p>1:02:20 Stockton and Malone run pick and roll, Harper ices the screen but Stockton runs into him anyway and draws a foul.</p>

<p>1:03:12 MJ and Rodman run pick and roll again, this time MJ has more room and takes a mid range pull-up but misses.</p>

<p>1:03:27 Hornacek sets rip screen for Malone to get post position, but as this is happening Pippen doubles Stockton. Stockton threads a pass between Harper and Pippen to Malone, who swings to Morris and then to Hornacek who drives on MJ, but MJ pokes the ball out of bounds.</p>

<p>1:03:48 Eisley checks in for Stockton</p>

<p>1:04:12 Jazz run two BLOB plays, both of which are broken up by the Bulls deflections, and shot clock violation. 1:04:38 Harper at top of key initiating the offense as MJ runs off of baseline screen by Pippen to get post position, but Hornacek hedges the action to deny pass to MJ as Morris recovers, and Pippen has deep paint post position vs Hornacek and hits an easy jump hook over him. Key play.</p>

<p>1:04:58 Hornacek sets rip screen for Malone to get post position, then curls around on split action with Eisley, then hits mid range pull-up. Key play.</p>

<p>1:05:23 Pippen posts Hornacek, Russell doubles off of Kukoc, Pippen has good footwork to get close layup, misses but once again Rodman gets offensive rebound and putback.</p>

<p>1:05:40 Russell sets rip screen for Malone to get post position, Russell gets pass on the pop and looks to enter to Malone, but decides to pass to Eisley for post entry. As he passes to Eisley, Pippen fouls Russell. It seems like the Bulls are doing all they can to avoid Rodman getting into foul trouble.</p>

<p>1:06:04 Pippen laboring to get up and down the court.</p>

<p>1:06:21 Pippen heading back to locker room.</p>

<p>1:06:40 Kukoc and Rodman run pick and roll, and Russell commits a foul on Kukoc.</p>

<p>1:07:09 Rodman gets ball in the post and Bulls run split action with MJ and Kerr. MJ gets pass on the perimeter but is defended well by Morris, and MJ resets. MJ drives on Morris and gets the step, drawing help from Carr who fouls MJ on the shot.</p>

<p>1:08:13 Malone gets ball in the post, Eisley cuts through the paint. Longley helps off of Carr to double Malone, Harper rotates to Carr and MJ covers Morris who is diving, leaving Hornacek open up top. Carr re-enters to Malone, who kicks it out to Hornacek with only four seconds on the shot clock, Harper pokes it away and Hornacek has to take a deep prayer shot. Hornacek misses and Carr commits loose ball foul on the offensive rebound.</p>

<p>1:08:56 MJ Longley pnr from the wing, MJ beats Morris going baseline, forcing help from Hornacek. MJ misses double clutch layup.</p>

<p>1:09:17 Antoine Carr misses jump hook over Longley</p>

<p>1:09:33 Burrell runs corner series pick and roll with Longley, and misses mid range pull-up.</p>

<p>1:09:43 Chris Morris misses tough transition floater, but Hornacek gets the fortunate offensive rebound and putback layup.</p>

<p>1:10:02 MJ pinch post keep with Kerr cutting. MJ drives on Morris and draws shooting foul on Carr. Lot of energy expended by MJ on this play.</p>

<p>1:11:10 Eisley holds ball at top of the key in 1-4 flat alignment. Keefe comes to set a screen but Eisley drives and gets a step on Kerr. Longley comes to help but Eisley makes dump off pass to Carr for dunk. Key play.</p>

<p>1:11:31 Longley gets ball at the high post and looks to initiate the offense. He might have a Backdoor cutting MJ but Carr plays passing lane leaving Longley open, so he takes the jumper and misses.</p>

<p>1:11:54 Jazz run same 1-4 flat alignment with Eisley up top and this time Eisley uses the screen from Keefe. They have to re-run the pick and roll a couple of times as the Bulls ice so they re-position and flip the screen, then Eisley rejects, but then they run the pick and roll and Eisley hits Keefe on the roll for a layup at the last second. Key play.</p>

<p>1:12:26 Keefe making excellent catch on the roll and hitting layup.</p>

<p>1:13:12 MJ pinch post handoff to Kerr then gets it back, and drives on Anderson and once again draws shooting foul on Carr.</p>

<p>1:14:02 Jazz love to set up their guys on the baseline and let Eisley work with tons of space at the top of the floor. This time they are running screening actions on the baseline but Eisley isos vs Kerr and scores on a floater.</p>

<p>1:14:17 MJ flashes from the pinch post to free throw line area in blind pig keep action, surveys the floor with the three man game, and hits a pull-up jumper.</p>

<p>1:14:42 once again Eisley works against Kerr from the top, and Kukoc helps off of Morris who misses a wide open corner three. 1:14:59 Kerr runs pnr with Rodman, and Rodman gets the ball above the free throw line and surveys the floor. Nothing materializes, so he shoots a perimeter shot and makes it. Absolute back breaker for the Jazz.</p>

<p>1:15:21 Once again Eisley Keefe pick and roll, Keefe explodes for a dunk on the roll but blows the dunk lol.</p>

<p>1:15:54 MJ top of key iso vs Anderson, misses tough pull-up</p>

<p>1:16:08 Chris Morris makes entry pass to Malone in the post, fakes a cut going left but instead cuts baseline, executing a give and go with Malone and then getting a reverse layup.</p>

<p>1:17:03 Kukoc wing iso vs Malone terrible miss on spinning floater or layup, but Bulls get offensive rebound. Then Kukoc misses a corner three.</p>

<p>1:18:24 Stockton enters to Malone in the post, Malone kicks back out to Stockton, Stockton tries to re-enter to Malone who is being fronted by Kukoc, but it gets deflected as Rodman is helping from the weak side.</p>

<p>Refs missed a blatant illegal defense call on Rodman, and you can hear a fan yelling “call an illegal defense!”</p>

<p>1:18:50 Rodman flashes to free throw line to initiate the offense and Kerr comes off down screen from three man game but Stockton sticks with him. Kerr spins and takes a horrible attempt that Stockton strips, Malone dives on the floor and it’s a shot clock violation.</p>

<p>1:19:28 Anderson posts Buechler but instead sets rip screen for Malone who gets ball in the post. Pippen digs off of Carr who gets a kickout pass but misses a wide open jumper.</p>

<p>1:19:43 Pippen posts up and the Bulls run split action with Kerr and Kukoc. Malone runs through Kerr’s screen which crushes him but Kukoc gets free and hits a three. Key play.</p>

<p>1:20:03 Malone gets ball in the post, and Jazz run split action with Stockton and Carr, but they both cut into the paint. Pippen doubles Malone as they are cutting so Kukoc covers Carr diving which frees up Chris Morris, who gets a kickout pass from Malone. Morris attacks a Buechler close out, and now Anderson is free since Buechler had to rotate off of him. As Morris gets penetration past Buechler, Kukoc helps so Morris passes to a cutting Anderson, Kerr fouls Anderson and he hits a jumper for an and 1. Key play.</p>

<p>1:20:27 Malone struggling to guard on the perimeter</p>

<p>1:20:55 MJ Rodman pick and roll, MJ rejects the screen and drives baseline, and draws a shooting foul on Carr.</p>

<p>1:22:13 Stockton and Malone run UCLA action - Stockton sets Pindown then they reverse it and Malone sets Pindown, then Malone gets the ball in the post. He fakes a handoff to a baseline cutting Hornacek and misses a fadeaway jumper.</p>

<p>1:22:45 Kukoc and Rodman run pick and roll but this flows into MJ post up and split action with Pippen and Kukoc. Malone barrels through Pippen’s screen, knocking him down. MJ has the ball and improvises as Pippen gets back up, using him as a screen and hitting a pull-up jumper. Key play.</p>

<p>this play shows how the triangle offense can quickly flow from one action to another (in this case pick and roll into split action)</p>

<p>1:23:11 Russell and Kukoc jostle in the post, and Kukoc fouls Russell.</p>

<p>1:24:06 Jazz continue to do this thing where a player is posting up but you can tell they’re not going to post up that player, they are instead going to have that player set a rip screen for Malone to get post position. In this case it’s Carr posting up Pippen and then Malone posting up Rodman. Stockton probes the defense and draws a double from Pippen and Harper as Malone gets into position. Stockton passes to Carr. Carr passes back to Stockton who finally enters to Malone in the post. Malone is doubled by Pippen who gets the steal. Ugh.</p>

<p>1:24:35 MJ posts up Hornacek and misses pull-up jumper.</p>

<p>1:24:48 Malone getting doubled in the post and Pippen getting a steal.</p>

<p>1:25:15 MJ elbow iso vs Russell and misses another pull-up.</p>

<p>1:25:26 Malone gets deep post position in semi transition and draws a shooting foul.</p>

<p>1:26:46 MJ comes off two off ball screens and misses mid range catch and shoot. Three misses in a row for MJ.</p>

<p>1:26:55 Stockton gets a screen from Carr in transition and hits a mid range pull-up.</p>

<p>1:27:12 Pippen gets deep post position on Hornacek and hits turnaround hook through tons of pain.</p>

<p>1:27:26 Stockton UCLA cuts into a rip screen for Malone who immediately takes a fadeaway and misses. Then Malone compounds the problem by fouling Rodman immediately after losing the rebound to him, and the Bulls are already in the bonus.</p>

<p>1:27:58 Pippen hitting turnaround hook with bad back.</p>

<p>1:28:51 Carr sets rip screen for Malone to get post position, Stockton fakes split action and a cut into the paint, and instead cuts around Malone receiving a handoff going baseline. Rodman switches onto Stockton but then hands him off to Pippen. Bulls are all mismatched now. On the weak side, he executes another handoff to Hornacek who misses a floater, but Malone gets the offensive rebound. Harper is now on Malone as he resets, but Harper tries to return back to his man as Russell re-enters to Malone who gets off a quick shot before Rodman can return to him, and makes it. Key play.</p>

<p>1:29:37 Mess of a possession from the Bulls. Not really sure what’s going on here but Harper hits an awkward running shot that should not have counted as he got it off after the shot clock expired. That’s five points that have indisputably gone against the Jazz due to missed shot clock calls in this game alone.</p>

<p>1:29:59 Malone gets ball in the post and fakes handoff to Stockton cutting baseline. Pippen doubles off of Carr who dives and Kukoc wants to help on Carr but Malone kicks it out to Russell so Kukoc tries to recover to Russell but he drives the close out and draws a shooting foul.</p>

<p>1:30:22 Harper not getting the shot off in time.</p>

<p>1:31:17 interesting play! Harper posts up Stockton at the elbow, and Bulls run split action with Pippen and MJ. They really never run split action unless it’s at the low post, and this is at the elbow. MJ badly misses a three.</p>

<p>1:31:25 Hornacek grabs the rebound and makes a risky outlet pass which MJ steals. Key play.</p>

<p>1:31:37 MJ runs pick and roll with Rodman, Rodman gets the ball on the roll and commits an offensive foul.</p>

<p>1:32:23 MJ amazing transition steal.</p>

<p>1:32:44 Carr is getting ready to set rip screen for Malone to get post position, but when Rodman goes under the screen, Malone veers into a pick and roll with Stockton. Harper and Pippen trap the pick and roll, leaving Malone open in space. Malone hits jumper. Key play.</p>

<p>1:33:07 MJ iso vs Russell at the free throw line extended. Stockton leaves Harper on weak side corner and sneaks baseline to double. This forces MJ to kick it out to Pippen as Stockton recovers back to Harper. MJ gets it back and isos again against Russell, pump fakes and drives and draws a foul.</p>

<p>once again Hornacek is way too concerned about Pippen on the perimeter with a bad back, should have doubled MJ</p>

<p>1:34:15 interesting! Jazz run same play again with Rodman going under Carr’s rip screen so Malone veering into pick and roll with Stockton. But Pippen signals to Rodman to cover the pick and roll and stick with Malone, so there is no trap on the pick and roll, and Stockton re-runs it going the opposite direction. Stockton gets a wide open pull-up but misses it. Russell gets the rebound and is trapped on the baseline so he tries to throw it off of the Bulls but it doesn’t work and the Bulls gain possession.</p>

<p>1:34:39 MJ top of key iso vs Russell, and misses spinning pull-up.</p>

<p>1:34:53 Hornacek sets baseline screen for Malone to get post position. Stockton makes entry pass but it’s poked away by Rodman and out of bounds.</p>

<p>1:35:15 SLOB Stockton gets a very good wide open look at three but misses.</p>

<p>1:35:27 MJ runs pick and roll with Rodman but rejects the screen and drives baseline, forcing help from Stockton. Stockton commits a shooting foul.</p>

<p>1:37:12 Hornacek sets rip screen for Malone to get post position. Stockton enters the ball to Malone and cuts through the paint to the weak side. Pippen doubles Malone so Harper has to cover Carr, leaving Stockton alone. Malone kicks to Stockton for wide open three and he makes it. Key play.</p>

<p>1:37:52 Stockton’s clutch three</p>

<p>1:38:48 Bulls execute two for one with MJ easily driving on Russell for a layup. Kerr in strong side corner, Kukoc in weak side corner, Rodman at the rim. Tough to help off of shooters here. Key play.</p>

<p>once again Pippen not a threat at the perimeter.</p>

<p>1:39:04 Hornacek sets baseline screen for Malone to get post position, but MJ doesn’t follow Hornacek and doubles Malone and gets a steal.</p>

<p>1:39:23 the shot.</p>

<p>1:40:27 the shot replay</p>

<p>1:42:09 Stockton gets ball and runs quick pick and roll with Malone, takes pull-up three and misses.</p>
