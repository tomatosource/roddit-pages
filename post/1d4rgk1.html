<p>Uber/Lyft, taxis, family, bus, ride a bike, walk and now video attendance so you don&rsquo;t actually have to be at court.</p>

<p>These are full grown adults and they need to do adulting things. Constantly making excuses for people like this just infantilises them. Also severely diminishes the efforts made by the majority of people who do the right thing and correct themselves after making mistakes.</p>

He got his license revoked for late child support payments and he went to court and proved he was up to date and they were supposed to reinstate his license 2 years prior. He had no idea his license was suspended for the initial ticket. It&rsquo;s still dumb as fuck that he&rsquo;s driving in a court hearing at all, but that little bit of context is important and doesn&rsquo;t make it quite as clear cut.</p>

Telecomuting with the judge while driving and having suspended licenses. It is clear as day by his expression that he knows that he shouldn&rsquo;t be driving.</p>

I didn&rsquo;t have a car myself at the time (I was a juror) and it was a fucking nightmare to get there, I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t get selected. Train to get close and then uber was the only way, but it was super fucking expensive and meant a three hour round trip commute.</p>

No one is making excuses for why they&rsquo;re in the situation in the first place but the reality is the system targets people who cannot afford many of the things you&rsquo;ve listed above. Instead, why not have an officer pick up the person if needed? Maybe they can take a break from terrorizing other low income neighborhoods for a moment and help someone fix a mistake.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not to mention that these people already have to get out of work for at least a day, risking their legitimate income stream because low wage jobs will drop you in a heart beat for &ldquo;reasons&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s not infantilising, it&rsquo;s reality.</p>

<p>Using them in this manor would especially enforce the public servant mindset that&rsquo;s long been forgotten. Remember they&rsquo;re a driving service, they aren&rsquo;t being sent to retrieve a hostile offender, they&rsquo;re being summoned for a ride.</p>

<p>Mostly it was just an idea. If nothing else a simple van service provided by courthouses would be great.</p>

<p>Get a ride and deal with it. I have to rely on someone else any time I want to travel any amount of distance. If I’m not paying $14 to take an 8 minute ride, then I’m scheduling a debated route with my town’s bus a week in advance; especially if the people around me are too busy to give me a ride. Hell, be glad you can even take a bike. The fact you can video call in to court is astounding.</p>

<p>I fully agree that people are incarcerated too much. I also fully agree that we need better public transportation so that people don&rsquo;t have to rely on cars as much.</p>

<p>But I think if anything, we&rsquo;re a little <em>too</em> lenient on letting some people stay on the road when they have a pattern of dangerous driving.</p>

      <label for="l6htewu" class="commentText"><p>Im not saying there shouldn&rsquo;t be punishments but when you combine this issue with a lot of the other systemic bullshit (and complete lack of transportation options in a vast majority of the US) it starts to look an awful lot like a trap. There should be punishments, 100% in agreement, and they should include revoking your right to drive, but combined with the rest of the current system you end up with folks who end up jobless, houseless, and frequently become offenders of other crimes out of sheer desire to stay alive with a modicum of life&rsquo;s comforts.</p>

<p>The system shouldn&rsquo;t push people into a cycle, there should be a clear path to moving on with a stable life after doing something stupid or harmful provided no one one was hurt in the process.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard and there&rsquo;s not a clear solution but there are a number of things that could certainly help and a minimal amount of empathy for the population from the government would be a start.</p>

<p>His court hearing pertained to a previous incident of driving without a license.</p>

<p>The judge in the top image is exasperated as this man is literally breaking the law for the exact same reason he is due in court. Within 60 seconds, he is sentenced to jail 6 PM that very day.</p>

<p>The man&rsquo;s reaction is one of complete surprise after some long moments of processing the judge&rsquo;s words. He is a portrait of a human goldfish living life in 10 second intervals of perception before his brain runs out of compute resources. He lives from this day on as a meme enshrining the pinnacle of man&rsquo;s stupidity.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll only be a minute!  I’ll be right back!”</p>

<p>As if those otherwise fully off-limit locations are magically OK to use if you utter those words.  “It’s OK to park illegally if it’s for my own personal convenience and no one else’s.  My convenience overrides public safety and inaccessibility for others.”</p>

<p>In this case, he completely ignored the driving license suspension, with the incantation , “But I’m going to my doctor’s office!”  While license is suspended but out on bond pending this very hearing about this very behavior.</p>

<p>BOOM!  Instant jail revocation.</p>

Like what if you scan something else or take a tag off something and scan it instead for cheaper price does that somehow set off something?</p>

      <label for="l6hjtkr" class="commentText"><p>Walmart recently added some kind of AI to their self checkout that is supposed to detect if you scan multiple items at once (it&rsquo;s not very good, lots of false positives that&rsquo;s how I know). I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they tried to add product image recognition in the future. It says something like &ldquo;an error occurred, please wait for an associate&rdquo; and then when they scan their badge it immediately plays back a video of you scanning the item(s). Happens if you scan too fast, hold the next item in your offhand, have a bunch of small items scanning one at a time, etc.</p>

      <label for="l6hpu2l" class="commentText"><p>Want to add&hellip;what Walmart is letting you take PS5s up to the self check out? That&rsquo;s a pay in the electronics department or if it&rsquo;s late at night bring the item up to the registers themselves. And from my experience they ring up the item themselves too, or at least that&rsquo;s what happened when I bought my Switch. Maybe that&rsquo;s just the retail worker in me but the math ain&rsquo;t mathing, unless the employee is just not following procedures or something. The whole point is to have the employee taking a part in curbing any thefts.</p>

<p>Or is the employee in on the whole thing?! How deep does this go?!</p>

      <label for="l6iabkz" class="commentText"><p>Still, in my store that theft would come back at the employee since they didn&rsquo;t follow protocol. Always follow bare minimum protocol at the very least because your employer will hold you accountable for theft of expensive items if they can find you didn&rsquo;t follow protocol. Because &ldquo;that item may have been stolen some other way, but it was stolen because you didn&rsquo;t follow protocol&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve seen it happen at my store. An electronics employee not doing what they&rsquo;re supposed to for whatever reason they were feeling, and the guy at the end of the store came down hard.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t blame an employee for seeing the truth that they aren&rsquo;t being paid right, but always do what you have to to protect your neck. Never engage a theft directly that could put you in harms way, because stores now preach you not to and they will fire you if you do. But also do what you have to to look out for yourself, because your bosses won&rsquo;t.</p>

He got his license revoked for late child support payments and he went to court and proved he was up to date and they were supposed to reinstate his license 2 years prior. He had no idea his license was suspended for the initial ticket. It&rsquo;s still dumb as fuck that he&rsquo;s driving in a court hearing at all, but that little bit of context is important and changes the perspective a little bit.</p>

He was holding a UPC for a $1.19 candy bar having a fit when the weight detection figured out Bundle boxes weight more than Hershey bars. I saw he was already being followed by Asset Protection&rsquo;s undercover guys. So I walk up, scan my badge, and help him bypass the weight thing and let him finish scanning everything.</p>

<p>He pays like <span class="math inline">\(80 for over \)</span>1,000 worth of card boxes. He says &ldquo;Dude, your fucking awesome, thanks!&ldquo;and walks over to the door, just to be stopped by the entire AP team and walked into the camera room. One of the AP guys gave me a thumbs up before he closed the door.</p>
