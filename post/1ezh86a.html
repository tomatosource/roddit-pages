      <p><strong>S Tier - Favorites to Win It All</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Celtics: The 2024 NBA Champions are heavy favorites to go back to back and repeat as NBA Champions. Previous NBA Champions such as the Lakers, Bucks, Warriors, and Nuggets have lost some key championship personnel in their pursuit of a repeat. Unlike the previous NBA Champions, the Celtics retained their entire championship core in pursuit of another NBA Championship. It is a good time to double down on their championship core because there is parity in the NBA, much of their roster is in their primes, and they have a successful blueprint in winning a championship. There is no real imposing threat that challenges the Celtics however if they face a healthier East and some injury luck goes against them (Porzingis), they might face a tougher challenge this time around.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A+/A - Championship Contenders Tier</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve grouped this as a championship contenders tier but the main difference between A+ and A tier is proven championship pedigree and superstar power.</p>

<p><strong>A+ Tier</strong></p>

<p>The best NBA players today are Jokic, Giannis, and Luka. All three have made it to the NBA finals with <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> winning a NBA Championship. They are the best players for a reason, they have good supporting cast and all are expected to be real championship contenders.</p>

<p>Note: arguably Luka hasn&rsquo;t won a championship but given his status as one of the best playoff performers today Luka is given the benefit of the doubt. Luka and the Mavericks could very well be in either A+ or the A tier imo.</p>

<ul>
<li>Nuggets</li>
<li>Bucks</li>
<li>Mavericks</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A Tier</strong></p>

<p>These teams are considered just as good if not better than the teams in the A+ tier. Some of these teams have arguably better supporting cast and depth and similar superstar power. However, there is still a prove it mentality with these superstar players and teams. The superstars players and teams in A+ tier have proven it. They didn&rsquo;t expect Jokic or Giannis to win until they proved it. Similar expectation for these players and their teams. All of these A tier teams are stacked from a supporting cast and depth perspective, and I&rsquo;d argue are better than the ones in A+ tier. Yet, the superstars in Embiid, SGA, Brunson, and Edwards still need to prove it on the biggest stage&ndash;the NBA finals.</p>

<ul>
<li>76ers</li>
<li>OKC</li>
<li>Knicks</li>
<li>Timberwolves</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>B Tier - Playoff Teams</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve split this tier into younger/older for clarity. These are the most likely teams to round out for the playoffs. They are good enough to win a playoff series or two (if luck is on their side) but I wouldn&rsquo;t expect them to compete for a championship. There is still good superstars in this tier and a lot of the teams here have made serious playoff runs in the past few years. However, if last year was any indication, it shows a changing of the guard from the older superstars to younger superstars with Lebron (Lakers), KD (Suns), Kawhi (Clippers), Curry (Warriors), and Butler (Heat) all failing to make it past the first round or failing to make the playoffs. These teams are good but they clearly lack significant staying power versus the teams in A tier due to weaker stars or poor supporting cast and depth.</p>

<p><strong>Veterans (Old Guard)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Lakers</li>
<li>Suns</li>
<li>Clippers</li>
<li>Warriors</li>
<li>Heat</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Rising Stars (Younger)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Grizzlies</li>
<li>Pacers</li>
<li>Pelicans</li>
<li>Kings</li>
<li>Cavs</li>
<li>Magic</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>C Tier - Play In Hopefuls</strong></p>

<p>These teams have some star power but there is clear inexperience with the stars, roster construction and supporting cast. These teams will win a decent amount of games but aren&rsquo;t expected to make the playoffs, they goal is to hopefully make the play ins if they&rsquo;re lucky.</p>

<ul>
<li>Rockets</li>
<li>Spurs</li>
<li>Hawks</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>D Tier - Not Good Enough</strong></p>

<p>There are good teams and there are bad teams. These teams are simply not good enough. The teams in this group need a strong overhaul in their roster construction to compete in a stacked league.</p>

<ul>
<li>Jazz</li>
<li>Bulls</li>
<li>Raptors</li>
<li>Hornets</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>F Tier - The Tanking Teams</strong></p>

<p>The bottom of the barrel, these are the tanking teams. No real expectations for these teams, there simply is not enough talent on these teams to compete. They are rebuilding their rosters. Youth and inexperience define these teams.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pistons</li>
<li>Wizards</li>
<li>Blazers</li>
<li>Nets</li>
</ul>
