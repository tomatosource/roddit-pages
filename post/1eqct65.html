<p>But there’s just no way to really follow through on that unless you’re willing to leave Steph currys and Kawhi Leonards off the team in favor of World Cup guys, which obviously isn’t gonna happen.</p>

      <label for="lhrbe8u" class="commentText"><p>And lets not forget that the Serbia game was close in large part due to them going absolutely mental from 3 during the first half, shooting at an unsustainable rate with damn near everything falling. Once their 3 ball stopped falling the USA quickly made up the deficit and took the lead. France also had the home court advantage and played about as well as they could.</p>

<p>The world has clearly improved but some of the hot takes from an undefeated run for a 5th straight gold medal are crazy.</p>

<p>Basketball is an inherently random game, the best team doesn&rsquo;t always win. There will be a day USA falls again. If USA wants to maximize their chances of winning, IMO they don&rsquo;t need more superstar talent, they need a cohesive unit who have played together and have coherent game plan. No matter who they send, they&rsquo;ll have the best talent regardless. They should do everything they can to get players to buy in for multiple years. And it&rsquo;s not easy due to the financiel incentives of the NBA</p>

      <label for="lhscgr7" class="commentText"><p>Yea. But it’s about averages. USA can shoot great, and it makes sense given who is shooting (curry, ant, etc). When it is Serbia shooting 50% and their shooters are typically in the low 30’s, that is a huge deviation. Indeed basketball can be very random. Especially in a single game sample anything can happen. Even with a great USA team like this one. Nearly all went away from them and they almost lost. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This year wasn&rsquo;t all that different than years prior (minus 2020). 2016 didn&rsquo;t have quite the high end talent, but their main contributors were all in their prime with Durant, Kyrie, Paul George, Klay, Butler, etc. 2012 was insane with Kobe, LeBron, Durant, CP3, Westbrook, Love, Carmelo, Harden, etc. 2008 was pretty similarly stacked.</p>

<p>If there is anything preventing the US from having a team with that many all-NBA and hall of fame players, it would simply be because the US isn&rsquo;t producing the same quality of players anymore. Maybe that is already happening with so many of the league&rsquo;s best players being from other countries.</p>

<p>even 2012 and 16 had some borderline all stars like harrison barnes and iguodala or weird fits like boogie or derozan. even in their primes they are clearly not great fits for olympic teams. this year was an anomaly because everyone said yes and was healthy to play except kawhi. but any other year there are some spots up for grabs, and a few dedicated to fiba veterans makes sense</p>

And it isn&rsquo;t like this 2024 team was without some fringe players either- Derrick White and Jrue Holiday werent even borderline all-stars; they just <em>weren&rsquo;t</em> all-stars.</p>

<p>Team USA having an insanely stacked roster is the norm, not at all the exception. What isn&rsquo;t the norm is they always enjoyed having the clear best player on their team regardless of opponent. That isn&rsquo;t the case now.</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s get something clear- Jrue and White didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;lead&rdquo; the Celtics to a title. Tatum and Brown did. They were the stars while Holiday and White were both role players. Nothing wrong with that, but they weren&rsquo;t the ones doing the heavy lifting like your statement implies.</p>

<p>Igoudala had just been named an all-star the previous season and had also been an all-defense level selection in the past prior to joining Team USA in 2012. DeMarcus Cousins was an all-NBA level player. Derozan was a two time all-star going into the Olympics. Barnes is the only one who seems a bit questionable, but no more than Derrick White or Jrue Holiday.</p>

Like, of Edwards shows no growth over the next 2 years, it wouldn&rsquo;t be beyond the pale to tell him he could get passed over for 2028 if he skips the WC in 2026, only for peers like Morant, Holmgren, or Banchero to play in the WC and continue to get better.</p>

<p>The guy you responded to had the right idea. Those young guys coming in need to be superstar level for the next olympics and be able to hard carry.</p>

<p>My votes are Mobley and Jalen Duren</p>

The USA wasn&rsquo;t allowed to even participate until 1994, after the Dream Team had already established the Olympics as the premier international basketball event for Americans. There is literally no cultural relevance, at all, for the FIBA World Cup in the USA. FIBA as a whole is completely irrelevant in the USA outside of the Olympics, and most Americans only watch that because its the Olympics, not because of FIBA.</p>

<p>If you were to go to a random sports bar in the USA and ask the patrons what their reaction was to the USA winning the 2014 FIBA World Cup the most likely response you&rsquo;ll get is &ldquo;Wait, there is a World Cup in basketball? I thought the World Cup was for soccer?&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lhtj04m" class="commentText"><p>I wasn’t referring to the FIBA World Cup. I’ll be very specific and say, in general, it’d be tough to accept the USA being anything less than the champion going forward. Since we’re taking things very literally on here today, that means 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th or any lower position.</p>

<p>The USA is still top-to-bottom the most talented basketball nation in the world. They are the favorite in basically every tournament, should be the favorite and therefore should win. If you root for Team USA (which I do), it is a disappointment when they come up short.</p>

<p>That being said, I acknowledge that while I as a fan of Team USA would be disappointed if they lose the World Cup or the 2028 Olympics (especially the Olympics), as a fan of basketball it would bode well for the continued international growth of the game.</p>

      <label for="lhs6wt0" class="commentText"><p>Americans famously don&rsquo;t give that much of a shit about our sports in an international context (or any sports really). Basketball in the Olympics gets an exception because its the Olympics. We&rsquo;ve always valued the Olympics so basketball is part of the hype. The quality of the Olympics as a &ldquo;basketball tournament&rdquo; is irrelevant to most American fans. Its the Olympics, it will automatically take precedence to most of us over any other &ldquo;better&rdquo; tournament.</p>

<p>Other than that It isn&rsquo;t just the basketball World Cup, the World Baseball Classic is decently controversial in the American baseball world because fans don&rsquo;t like expensive, high level players (re: pitchers) risking blowing out their arm over a meaningless tournament. Even in the most recent World Baseball Classic most top level American pitchers didn&rsquo;t participate and the viewership in the States was comparatively low (I think it was like ~4 million or something?). Most Americans don&rsquo;t even know that there is a World Cup in American football put on by some French org called the IFAF.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who gives a fuck about beating some other country in [sport], we gotta beat the [insert rival team here]!&rdquo; is pretty much the mentality for a lot of Americans. I&rsquo;ll admit I kinda have that mentality as well outside of the Olympics.</p>

      <label for="lhsaswa" class="commentText"><p>Its literally all of the major sport North American. There is an Ice Hockey World Championship as well, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever heard an American talk about it in my life. Its pretty much just the Stanley Cup and the Winter Olympics.</p>

<p>Basketball, baseball, ice hockey, football&hellip;it doesn&rsquo;t really matter, Americans don&rsquo;t really give a shit about international competitions. It is mainly just the soccer World Cup that gets any type of attention here, and I think the fact that it is so openly non American is a big reason why.</p>

      <label for="lhsc56h" class="commentText"><p>My theory is that america main sports are literally created in america (basketball, football, baseball) so they were not accostumed to international rivalry with other countries like europeans or latinamericans in soccer</p>

<p>The olympics is the area where usa as a nation competed for national pride with the likes of the soviet union so it became the one they care about</p>

<p>Of course with time world improved at baseball and basketball but usa culture remained insular</p>

      <label for="lhsd6na" class="commentText"><p>I agree, I do think that is part of it. I think part of it is the limited contact that many Americans have with Europeans/Latin Americans in general, especially before the internet. If you are from Kansas City you could drive 1,000 miles in any direction and still be in the USA. Hard to build up an international rivalry with another country if you never meet them in person, and you don&rsquo;t even share a common sporting interest with them as American football deviated from rugby/soccer. On the other hand they interact with their local teams rivals all the time&hellip;some of the family/friends may cheer for a rival team. It helps build up that competitive spirit.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, unlike the USA, Latin America was still heavily colonized by and under the direct control of Europeans around the time that soccer was growing, and is a big reason for why soccer is the biggest sport in the world today. It was introduced to those areas during colonization, and helped foster that international game that exists in soccer today. It is easier to have a cross-Atlantic cultural connection with active colonies as opposed to the country that gained independence a century earlier.</p>

      <label for="lhr539x" class="commentText"><p>World Cup isn’t a big deal in the US. Nobody cares that they’ve struggled there so there’s no motivation to win it. The Olympics is all that matters.</p>

<p>On top of that, the World Cup was moved so that it’s the year before the Olympics. Convincing American players to give up two summers in a row shuts the door on a lot of the top players who weren’t super interested in the first place.</p>

<p>The US would have to fall short at the Olympics to become convinced that the World Cup is a necessary part of building the team.</p>

<p>Jokic, Giannis, Porzingis, Murray (and others) all sat out of the World Cup just for the sake of getting rest.</p>

<p>People from other countries might show a lot of pride to their team(s) competing in international competition, but it&rsquo;s clear that countries look at the Olympics as the &ldquo;true&rdquo; international premier event</p>

Those guys wanna win a NBA title very strong chance a lot of them are in the playoffs which just extends their season. Why give up what little time off you get when you can enjoy yourself for a bit before having to get back to work. I don’t blame any star for sitting out.

      <label for="lhtb0bl" class="commentText"><p>Right now, the basketball World Cup is similar to how powerhouse soccer nations treat men’s soccer in the Olympics: it’s a second class competition</p>

<p>Changing that perception isn’t impossible but it would require a whole bunch of things to happen that would make things more balanced in either sport.</p>

<p>It being “entertaining for fans” isn’t going to cut it though. There has to be a larger cultural shift in perspective and that will require time, influential players to take a visible role in promoting participation, financial incentives all around, etc</p>

<p>Kerr, Spo and Lue installed almost no offense or defensive schemes. For the most part the offense was run and gun on transition and if that didn’t work then play hot potato around the perimeter.</p>

<p>Talent has always won out but the games are harder than they need to be because the offense and defense is badly optimized. Likely because the team has like less than half a summer to install anything.</p>

<p>Much ado about nothing. We can revisit this topic in the 2031 World Cup leading into Brisbane. 🙄</p>

<p>If I had to guess, I&rsquo;d use the 2027 World Cup to break in the next generation: the Cooper Flaggs, Dereck Lively IIs, Cade Cunninghams, Reed Sheppards, Ja Morants, and Chet Holmgrens, rather than worry about accolades or continuation. The motivation for them would be showing out, earning goodwill to come back for the 5 or so spots up for grabs on the LA Olympics team.</p>

The dream team set the tone for the Olympics being THE international tournement and historically iconic athletes such as Bill and Big O played the Olympics.  Meanwhile American nba players have not been able to participate in the FIBA world cup untiñ the 90s.</p>

<p>I know the opposite is true for Europe and their biggest sport soccer where the world cup is their biggest event while the Olympics is a side show for young players, but that&rsquo;s just not the case.</p>

<p>They basically made a tournament for the Basketball world cup, but banned the nation who has the most basketball culture and the best players by far.  America created basketball and it&rsquo;s most popular league is the American league they set the culture for relevancy and it&rsquo;s fair for them to not believe Fiba is irrelevant.</p>

      <label for="lhr2ix8" class="commentText"><p>I think it’s really important that this new wave of USA stars start taking the FIBA World Cup more seriously. The rest of the world takes it seriously and that chemistry they build in that tournament helps. Last thing I want is a bunch of 20-somethings like Ant, JT, Book and Bam not taking it seriously and not being able to rely on LBJ, KD and Curry to bail them out of it. Would be a terrible look to blow the 2028 Olympics on home soil.</p>

<p>It’d be nice if FIBA could move it up to 2026. Would probably make it an easier sell to some of the A Team to commit to it.</p>

      <label for="lhrvgwn" class="commentText"><p>Gotcha. World Cup usually is only June-mid/late July. Feels like if you started the FIBA group stage after the FIFA knockout rounds, you’d still get a fair amount of attention. Can even cross-promote it with the World Cup to get more attention. Feel like that worked out great this year with the Euros and Copa America (albeit different situation since it’s the same sport)</p>

      <label for="lhsvb2r" class="commentText"><p>The problem I have with the American approach to the World Cup is that it makes the &ldquo;stars&rdquo; that only show up to the Olympics look like entitled assholes.</p>

<p>The guys who play the world cup are the ones who qualify the US for the Olympics, and then being told <em>Thank you and fuck off because lazy ass star who couldn&rsquo;t be arsed to show some national pride now wants to have your spot to be in the Olympic glamour spotlight.</em> Pretty fucked up.</p>

<p>Whoever qualifies the country for the Olympics in the world cup should pay at the Olympics, everyone deserves no respect&hellip;unless injury keeps him out of the world cup.</p>

<p>My two cents.</p>

<p>It should be an honour to represent your country and play and win the world cup, and by doing so qualify to the Olympics. These guys deserve to play at the Olympics, and anyone who wasn&rsquo;t on the world cup roster doesn&rsquo;t deserve to wear the national jersey at the Olympics.</p>

      <label for="lhtmjl1" class="commentText"><p>I don’t mind Edwards or too stars competing in Fiba, but making arrogant remarks about something most of the baskatball world cares about is what ls wrong with America.</p>

<p>In football, too players can easily not play the euros, copa, or friendlies because they have club play from August to mid to late May and even June if they make the champions league final. Add fact preseason friendlies occur maybe even a month after club level ends.</p>

<p>I just wish American athletes stopped making it known they’re the best and have more respect about a sport like basketball as a whole.</p>

<p>I’m a baskatball and football fan so I defend and love both sports. Both are probably my favorites right now. I still love NFL, but I feel I’ve gotten older and is more for watching my G Men.</p>

<p>Still what gets people annoyed with guys like KD and Americans is they treat world basketball and passion of basketball with disrespect.</p>

<p>They don’t understand the world doesn’t revolve around them and fact is they win the Olympics everytime do of course people will get tired of them winning and trying to be underdogs.</p>

<p>I feel if NBA wanted to really raise its level as close to football, it needs to really take the international tournaments seriously and want more growth from European teams.</p>

<p>Reason why football is so great is all the international tournaments having almost same value.
 A Euro and WC is almost sinilar for me and you see it if you watched the euros.</p>

<p>NBA and baskatball will always have a hard time matching football, but guys like Edwards taking a jab at the WC of baskatball like it is nothing shows the mentality of Americans and why I don’t patriotic with American sports unless I see Americans who really love their country or don’t carry themselves without respect.</p>

<p>At least 2008-2012 team had that respect. That’s why I see Lyles hate and don’t get too mad though he is annoying himself, but what he said is the truth.</p>

<p>Americans don’t have to get offended over simplest criticisms and always say and brag they are the best. We get it and as an American I am grateful I live in a country that has protected its people to serious harm and have these freedoms, but it leads to arrogance because of this fortunate upbringing.</p>

<p>Players like Edwards need to know the world isn’t always about them and being an American is more about being a star.</p>

<p>I remember last Euros Spain had those young guys Pedri and Gavi. They played euros and made semis and lost to Italy. A month later played in Olympics and then went to club play.
I know baskatball is grueling and I’m not going to force the culture in America to adapt what Europe does, but don’t talk shot like Ant does and always make everything about himself and act like he can do anything wrong.</p>

<p>And then KD getting offended some people even Americans are rooting for Jokić.</p>

<p>Maybe because we knew USA was going to win win anyway and have since existence of baskatball, that  people were like that.
 I don’t like how people like KD and fans here who probably have anti American views many times like in politics acted like they are communists or traitors for a different opinion.</p>

<p>I believe at this point being an American is that easy there isn’t anything to brag or worry about.</p>

It really just discourages players to play in the World Cup take all that pressure hope to make the Olympic squad and then lose it to guys that didnt want to commit. Paolo balled out in the NBA season and in the World Cup despite playing out of position and in a weird role/new style.  Its not like he doesnt fit, he has a great fit on this squad. But Dwhite did play great also so it was probably a good move.</p>

      <label for="lhsi703" class="commentText"><p>If you&rsquo;re a star in the nba, are you going to risk your potential triple digit million dollar contract for playing in FIBA? When they can play in the Olympics which is really all the national pride most americans care about.</p>

<p>Also unless FIBA can somehow pay more than NBA salaries, accommodate most of the current teams we have available, and play enough games to have an entertaining season, it&rsquo;s never gonna be the more important league/tourney for USA fans.</p>
