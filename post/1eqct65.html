Paul George was a member of the under 19 team then he was on the 2012 select team the the team who runs scrimmages against the Olympic team. A lot of the people that play for team USA played for either the u19 team, a select team, or the world team.

<p>That is a nonsense excuse in my eyes. He wanted to be part of the team and admitted as much. Derrick White apparently had no trouble preparing himself to play on such short notice, but Paul George couldn&rsquo;t? Seems more likely he was just petty he got snubbed</p>

Once their 3 ball stopped falling the USA quickly made up the deficit and took the lead. France also had the home court advantage and played about as well as they could.</p>

<p>The world has clearly improved but some of the hot takes from an undefeated run for a 5th straight gold medal are crazy.</p>

<p>Basketball is an inherently random game, the best team doesn&rsquo;t always win. There will be a day USA falls again. If USA wants to maximize their chances of winning, IMO they don&rsquo;t need more superstar talent, they need a cohesive unit who have played together and have coherent game plan. No matter who they send, they&rsquo;ll have the best talent regardless. They should do everything they can to get players to buy in for multiple years. And it&rsquo;s not easy due to the financiel incentives of the NBA</p>

      <label for="lhscgr7" class="commentText"><p>Yea. But it’s about averages. USA can shoot great, and it makes sense given who is shooting (curry, ant, etc). When it is Serbia shooting 50% and their shooters are typically in the low 30’s, that is a huge deviation. Indeed basketball can be very random. Especially in a single game sample anything can happen. Even with a great USA team like this one. Nearly all went away from them and they almost lost. </p>

<p>Investing in the roster comp and chemistry, over loading up on star talent who struggle to fill a role, seems like the next wave.</p>

USA ultimately dominates due to equivalent quality at the 3-15 spots on the roster where most National teams have a massive drop off after the first two spots and are dependent on chemistry to make up the difference.</p>

<p>This year wasn&rsquo;t all that different than years prior (minus 2020). 2016 didn&rsquo;t have quite the high end talent, but their main contributors were all in their prime with Durant, Kyrie, Paul George, Klay, Butler, etc. 2012 was insane with Kobe, LeBron, Durant, CP3, Westbrook, Love, Carmelo, Harden, etc. 2008 was pretty similarly stacked.</p>

<p>If there is anything preventing the US from having a team with that many all-NBA and hall of fame players, it would simply be because the US isn&rsquo;t producing the same quality of players anymore. Maybe that is already happening with so many of the league&rsquo;s best players being from other countries.</p>

<p>even 2012 and 16 had some borderline all stars like harrison barnes and iguodala or weird fits like boogie or derozan. even in their primes they are clearly not great fits for olympic teams. this year was an anomaly because everyone said yes and was healthy to play except kawhi. but any other year there are some spots up for grabs, and a few dedicated to fiba veterans makes sense</p>

D-Rose, Wade, Bosh, etc. withdrew in 2012 because of injuries. And it isn&rsquo;t like this 2024 team was without some fringe players either- Derrick White and Jrue Holiday werent even borderline all-stars; they just <em>weren&rsquo;t</em> all-stars.</p>

<p>Team USA having an insanely stacked roster is the norm, not at all the exception. What isn&rsquo;t the norm is they always enjoyed having the clear best player on their team regardless of opponent. That isn&rsquo;t the case now.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s get something clear- Jrue and White didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;lead&rdquo; the Celtics to a title. Tatum and Brown did. They were the stars while Holiday and White were both role players. Nothing wrong with that, but they weren&rsquo;t the ones doing the heavy lifting like your statement implies.</p>

<p>Igoudala had just been named an all-star the previous season and had also been an all-defense level selection in the past prior to joining Team USA in 2012. DeMarcus Cousins was an all-NBA level player. Derozan was a two time all-star going into the Olympics. Barnes is the only one who seems a bit questionable, but no more than Derrick White or Jrue Holiday.</p>

      <label for="lhrfxfd" class="commentText"><p>Sure. I’m just saying who the US chooses to send to the World Cup is almost irrelevant because AD and Bam will most likely play in 2028.</p>

<p>But yes, it will be interesting to see who else other than most likely Chet they send to the World Cup as their bigs on the roster.</p>

<p>My votes are Mobley and Jalen Duren</p>

Ant and Hali were the two who played on the World Cup team that they decided to elevate to the Olympics team. I feel like that&rsquo;s the best avenue for them to take the world cup team and how they can ensure all the up and comers are willing to play - by telling them it&rsquo;s their tryout.</p>

The USA wasn&rsquo;t allowed to even participate until 1994, after the Dream Team had already established the Olympics as the premier international basketball event for Americans. There is literally no cultural relevance, at all, for the FIBA World Cup in the USA. FIBA as a whole is completely irrelevant in the USA outside of the Olympics, and most Americans only watch that because its the Olympics, not because of FIBA.</p>

<p>If you were to go to a random sports bar in the USA and ask the patrons what their reaction was to the USA winning the 2014 FIBA World Cup the most likely response you&rsquo;ll get is &ldquo;Wait, there is a World Cup in basketball? I thought the World Cup was for soccer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The 1994 FIBA World Championship was the first time that the FIBA World Championship (now called the FIBA Basketball World Cup) allowed current American NBA players that had already played in an official NBA regular season game to participate. Prior to that only professionals from other leagues were allowed to compete, since players from other leagues were still considered amateurs.</p>

      <label for="lhrsk2b" class="commentText"><p>It’s also an objectively better tournament especially for fans of non superpower or elite sides.</p>

<p>Too bad Americans and the NBA only care about the Olympics because the Olympics low key suck as a basketball tournament unless you are an elite side (besides qualification as a prestige point).</p>

      <label for="lhs6wt0" class="commentText"><p>Americans famously don&rsquo;t give that much of a shit about our sports in an international context (or any sports really). Basketball in the Olympics gets an exception because its the Olympics. We&rsquo;ve always valued the Olympics so basketball is part of the hype. The quality of the Olympics as a &ldquo;basketball tournament&rdquo; is irrelevant to most American fans. Its the Olympics, it will automatically take precedence to most of us over any other &ldquo;better&rdquo; tournament.</p>

<p>Other than that It isn&rsquo;t just the basketball World Cup, the World Baseball Classic is decently controversial in the American baseball world because fans don&rsquo;t like expensive, high level players (re: pitchers) risking blowing out their arm over a meaningless tournament. Even in the most recent World Baseball Classic most top level American pitchers didn&rsquo;t participate and the viewership in the States was comparatively low (I think it was like ~4 million or something?). Most Americans don&rsquo;t even know that there is a World Cup in American football put on by some French org called the IFAF.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who gives a fuck about beating some other country in [sport], we gotta beat the [insert rival team here]!&rdquo; is pretty much the mentality for a lot of Americans. I&rsquo;ll admit I kinda have that mentality as well outside of the Olympics.</p>

There is an Ice Hockey World Championship as well, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever heard an American talk about it in my life. Its pretty much just the Stanley Cup and the Winter Olympics.</p>

<p>Basketball, baseball, ice hockey, football&hellip;it doesn&rsquo;t really matter, Americans don&rsquo;t really give a shit about international competitions. It is mainly just the soccer World Cup that gets any type of attention here, and I think the fact that it is so openly non American is a big reason why.</p>

      <label for="lhsc56h" class="commentText"><p>My theory is that america main sports are literally created in america (basketball, football, baseball) so they were not accostumed to international rivalry with other countries like europeans or latinamericans in soccer</p>

<p>The olympics is the area where usa as a nation competed for national pride with the likes of the soviet union so it became the one they care about</p>

<p>Of course with time world improved at baseball and basketball but usa culture remained insular</p>

      <label for="lhsd6na" class="commentText"><p>I agree, I do think that is part of it. I think part of it is the limited contact that many Americans have with Europeans/Latin Americans in general, especially before the internet. If you are from Kansas City you could drive 1,000 miles in any direction and still be in the USA. Hard to build up an international rivalry with another country if you never meet them in person, and you don&rsquo;t even share a common sporting interest with them as American football deviated from rugby/soccer. On the other hand they interact with their local teams rivals all the time&hellip;some of the family/friends may cheer for a rival team. It helps build up that competitive spirit.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, unlike the USA, Latin America was still heavily colonized by and under the direct control of Europeans around the time that soccer was growing, and is a big reason for why soccer is the biggest sport in the world today. It was introduced to those areas during colonization, and helped foster that international game that exists in soccer today. It is easier to have a cross-Atlantic cultural connection with active colonies as opposed to the country that gained independence a century earlier.</p>

<p>Americans are, of course, entitled to feel however they want about it. If you guys don’t value it, you don’t value it. It’s just disappointing I guess because the rest of us do.</p>

      <label for="lhs2854" class="commentText"><p>The main people who say that are foreign soccer fans who think that just because the soccer World Cup is the biggest sporting event in the world that every &ldquo;World Cup&rdquo; should be equally prestigious. They have trouble dealing with the fact that not every sport is soccer, nor should be/needs to be.</p>

      <label for="lhs19ik" class="commentText"><p>You can&rsquo;t effectively ban us from participating in your tournament for most of the sport&rsquo;s existence and then turn around and bemoan the fact that the tournament has no respect or place in our basketball culture.</p>

<p>We value Olympic basketball because being an Olympian already carries significant weight with Americans due to our history. Some of our most legendary historical athletes were Olympians (e.g. Jesse Owens). By comparison the World Cup is a second-tier tournament put on by the basketball equivalent of the MLS.</p>

<p>There is no desire to risk injury and jeopardize a title run and/or career when the world can&rsquo;t even take a game off of us in the Olympics. Maybe if we lose 2-3 Olympics in a row it will change but I doubt it. And as another commenter already pointed out it isn&rsquo;t just Americans that value the Olympics over the World Cup. Jokic didn&rsquo;t play in the World Cup yet he was celebrating with joy after winning the Bronze. International fans like the FIBA World Cup because they are soccer fans, which is understandable, but most Americans aren&rsquo;t nearly as passionate about soccer as other countries. The 2022 FIFA World Cup Final got about 10 million fewer viewers than a single NFL Wild Card game in the USA. Most Americans aren&rsquo;t interested in bending over backwards to make our sports more like soccer to please foreign soccer fans.</p>

      <label for="lhr2ix8" class="commentText"><p>I think it’s really important that this new wave of USA stars start taking the FIBA World Cup more seriously. The rest of the world takes it seriously and that chemistry they build in that tournament helps. Last thing I want is a bunch of 20-somethings like Ant, JT, Book and Bam not taking it seriously and not being able to rely on LBJ, KD and Curry to bail them out of it. Would be a terrible look to blow the 2028 Olympics on home soil.</p>

<p>It’d be nice if FIBA could move it up to 2026. Would probably make it an easier sell to some of the A Team to commit to it.</p>

<p>Much ado about nothing. We can revisit this topic in the 2031 World Cup leading into Brisbane. 🙄</p>

<p>If I had to guess, I&rsquo;d use the 2027 World Cup to break in the next generation: the Cooper Flaggs, Dereck Lively IIs, Cade Cunninghams, Reed Sheppards, Ja Morants, and Chet Holmgrens, rather than worry about accolades or continuation. The motivation for them would be showing out, earning goodwill to come back for the 5 or so spots up for grabs on the LA Olympics team.</p>

The dream team set the tone for the Olympics being THE international tournement and historically iconic athletes such as Bill and Big O played the Olympics.  Meanwhile American nba players have not been able to participate in the FIBA world cup untiñ the 90s.</p>

<p>I know the opposite is true for Europe and their biggest sport soccer where the world cup is their biggest event while the Olympics is a side show for young players, but that&rsquo;s just not the case.</p>

<p>They basically made a tournament for the Basketball world cup, but banned the nation who has the most basketball culture and the best players by far.  America created basketball and it&rsquo;s most popular league is the American league they set the culture for relevancy and it&rsquo;s fair for them to not believe Fiba is irrelevant.</p>

It really just discourages players to play in the World Cup take all that pressure hope to make the Olympic squad and then lose it to guys that didnt want to commit. Paolo balled out in the NBA season and in the World Cup despite playing out of position and in a weird role/new style.  Its not like he doesnt fit, he has a great fit on this squad. But Dwhite did play great also so it was probably a good move.</p>

The World Cup and Olympics are closer to the All Star game in prestige than they are to the NBA Championship.</p>

<p>My thought is that basketball is seen as the NBA, and anything outside of the NBA is a novelty. That&rsquo;s why one of the big narratives of this Olympics was Jayson Tatum not getting playing time.</p>

They also get to go dick around with all the other top athletes in the world for a couple weeks at the Olympics as opposed to the pure basketball atmosphere of FIBA so that might affect it as well as there wouldn&rsquo;t be the clips of Ant being friendly with the ping pong players or Lebron showing up to watch some other events so the environment is less summer camp and more summer school at the World Cup</p>

<p>Why though? Arguably, prioritising the Olympics over a standalone Basketball tournament hurts international basketball more.</p>

<p>All the big sports have their own events, which are more prestigious. The Rugby World Cup is the main tournament, and Olympics rugby isn&rsquo;t even 15 a side. Football in the Olympics is U-23. Olympics in tennis doesn&rsquo;t hold a candle to the grand slams.</p>

<p>Basketballers are absolute stars in the Olympics, which may indicate that they should not be competing seriously at this level.  The NBA championship shows what is possible.</p>

<p>There are just vastly more opportunities when you run your own tournament, vs piggybacking on the Olympics, which already have set sponsors and opportunities (that are shared with 31 other sports)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Americans don&rsquo;t give a shit about the World Cup while the Olympics are literally the second biggest sporting event in the USA after the Super Bowl.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on viewership figures, this doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case. After the superbowl, it is the Men&rsquo;s football world cup final followed by the Women&rsquo;s football World Cup final in 2015. The 2024 basketball final did get higher viewership than the 2019 women&rsquo;s football world cup final.</p>

      <label for="lhrc8z6" class="commentText"><p>When was the last time team USA won fiba world cup? That was in 2014 with Kyrie Irving as MVP and Steph entering his prime. I thought team USA would be more motivated to show the world what they&rsquo;re made of. This year&rsquo;s Olympic is like the last ride for these stars, but the true test is the next one. And it started in the next international tournament.</p>

<p>I know the fiba world cup feels inferior to the Olympics. But if Team USA ended up 7th and 4th like the two previous ones, are you prepared to be slammed hard by the media?</p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t an exaggeration to say that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>95% of Americans don&rsquo;t even know that a World Cup exists in basketball. Effectively no one in the country cares if we do good/bad in the World Cup&hellip;.literally no one cared when we won it in 2014, most Americans didn&rsquo;t even know it was going on.</p>
