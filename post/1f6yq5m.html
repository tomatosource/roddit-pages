      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1f6yq5m/boston_won_their_last_title_in_2008_which_was_the/"><p>Boston won their last title in 2008 which was the same year that the debut graphic novel series of amulet created by Kazu Kibuishi and last novel of the series was released this year as Celtics won the championship in 2024</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I used to be a such a massive fan of the graphic novels when I was a younger at public school before forgetting about them entirely when I got older and didn&rsquo;t really have the time to read all of the latest editions that were coming out during that time period but after I was done my first year of college at Humber for Broadcast Radio. I used that time to fully reread the entire Amulet Saga which was 9 books in it&rsquo;s entirely and was surprised to say the least that last book was released this year to conclude the story which changed a whole lot from the last time that I read it but even though that some people didn&rsquo;t really liked the ending all that much, I found it to be pretty cool to see everything come full circle kinda like how the Celtics journey to their 2024 championship started when they won it in 2008 against the lakers which was the year where the first book of the amulet series was released.</p>

<p>Maybe Jayson Tatum needed to break free from the mental void to fully become the leader that the celtics needed to get the job done and allow everyone else to do thier thing to win the championship kinda like how Emily Hayes needed to break free from all of the distractions in her environment like the void and fear of the Elf king to fully lock in and defeat the remaining foes along with her new found freinds and family to return back to earth and live a life with a new founded appreciation of themselves and what they can achieve.</p>
