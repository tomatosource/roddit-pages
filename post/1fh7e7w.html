</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I remember when KD got his achilles injury, people were saying no nba player has ever come back the same after the injury. Dominque Wilkins being the closest, but even he wasn&rsquo;t the same.</p>

<p>KD, on the other hand, hasn&rsquo;t missed a beat. He&rsquo;s averaging 28 ppg on 53 percent shooting post achilles injury. This is remarkable and never been seen before.</p>

<p>Another thing, why isn&rsquo;t anyone talking about his longevity? He&rsquo;s 35 years old now and still playing as great as he&rsquo;s ever done. I think he will still be great in his 40&rsquo;s.</p>

      <label for="ln7t7ht" class="commentText"><p>Honestly I didn’t think he’d be as good as he’s been post injury. But it’s hard to view him as durable again when he missed a good amount of the regular season until last year. Also he hasn’t been able to make it to the conference finals. If he was headlining the conference finals I feel like media would bring it up all the time. Man that toe really would’ve changed everything</p>

      <label for="ln7sro1" class="commentText"><p>Giannis and the rest of the world were calling him the best player in the world after the toe game. Then he got swept the next year, his old team won without him, defeating the team that swept him, and then he demanded a trade to the Suns, which he got, and he just kinda hasn&rsquo;t made that big of a splash since. The world accepted his greatness and return to form after his 7 game battle with Giannis and the Bucks, and maybe we have taken his performance since then for granted, but his failures and stumbles since has sort of blurred the perception of the amazing amount of work it took for him overcome the achilles injury in the first place.</p>

<p>People Can&rsquo;t believe that  at 40, 36, 36 years old, they are still in Top 10 nba players conversation.</p>

<p>Harden, Russ, Kawhi are younger. And these three became washed first before Lebron/KD/Steph.</p>

      <label for="ln7spq6" class="commentText"><p>His longevity is wild given he’s too much of a bitch to take PEDs/HGH like everyone else. He’s got some personal motto about “born natural/die natural” and even though all this shit is undetectable, the league doesn’t actually care that most the players are pumping their ass full of super serum, and KD has admitted multiple trainers have tried convincing him to take it, he’d rather have brittle human bones and age normally like a coward. </p>

      <label for="ln7u9ww" class="commentText"><p>He gets a lot of praise for it. It really is crazy his points per game and shooting splits are all higher post achilles injury though. You can definitely see his physical decline due to injury and age. His athleticism is gone. He can’t drive and slash for shit anymore. But conversely, he’s become like the greatest jump shooter of all time. Bro just casually walks into threes and midranges and doesn’t miss.</p>
