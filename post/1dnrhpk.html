With Harden, you never had to fix the laces. The only thing you had to do was just shoot it. But with Paul George, he throws that motherf*cker.. it&rsquo;s spinning the other way, you gotta fix it..&rdquo;</p>

    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>from the <a href="https://x.com/i/status/1801001615094055318" target="_blank">Pat Bev pod</a></p>

<p>“James Harden, not even close.. But Paul George is the worst. The basketball, they got the lines on em&rsquo; right? Usually guys like to line them up, put the fingertip on black and you just release it .With James Harden, you never had to fix the laces. They came already fixed. The only thing you had to do is just shoot it.</p>

<p>But with Paul George, he throw that motherfucker and you don&rsquo;t know how fast it is. It looks slow but you catch it fast and it&rsquo;s going the other way so you gotta catch it with a guy closing out on you, fix it, fix it again then shoot it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>this shit was hilarious lmaooo and after a season of watching PG and Harden side by side it checks out.</p>

<p>Like they&rsquo;ll drive and create an opening on the perimeter for a guy like Mann and then they&rsquo;ll throw the pass at his shins and he can&rsquo;t the shot up because of the poor accuracy.</p>

<p>Set your boy up for success, it matters more than the drive itself. If you cant execute the complete play, no amount of ankle-breaking matters. My man Ant needs help in this aspect as well.</p>

      <label for="la5o3r0" class="commentText"><p>The back injury came out of nowhere while he was holding out. I’m sure he had it since he had surgery, most players have something, but I don’t think that’s the whole reason he declined with the Nets.</p>

<p>His free throw % dipped to 40% since coming back and he admitted he was doing no basketball training during that holdout. Whatever mental block he had against the Hawks must have spiraled in that break and it doesn’t seem like he ever returned to training the same.</p>

<p>I think it was anxiety and arrogance that he didn’t need to improve on anything. He went many years without ever adding to his game. Dude had every natural tool to be a great basketball player but just didn’t want to be one. And was held back by his own mind. It’s a fascinating case.</p>

There&rsquo;s a pod or an interview somewhere with Maxey talking about receiving passes and how if Ben&rsquo;s throwing it you better be ready to catch it cause its coming fast. I don&rsquo;t think its good or bad necessarily, faster passes have less chance of being deflected or stolen, but also I think it plays into the pg role of knowing your teammates and how they like to catch the ball</p>

      <label for="la5thml" class="commentText"><p>It’s almost always a good thing. Lebron almost always throws bullets, and it means shooters have an extra tenth of a second to get a shot off or beat their man off the dribble. I’m a huge Steph Curry fan, and something I’ve noticed over the years is he just lacks the physical strength to throw those cross court rockets the way Lebron, Harden and Jokic can. Curry just lobs it cross court, and it’s noticeable how much easier it is for the defense to rotate and reset.</p>

      <label for="la5c4mu" class="commentText"><p>He has the vision and the length to get the passes off but struggles to hit those excellent passes when he can&rsquo;t line his eyes up. The difference between his no-looks out of traffic vs someone like Harden is pretty big. I think passing technique is something that isn&rsquo;t spoken about enough, it gets exponentially harder when you&rsquo;re passing in motion, behind the back, one hand, etc.</p>

<p>The thing in Giannis&rsquo; favour is that he&rsquo;s usually just bigger than other guys so he has more clear air to get a pass off. And he&rsquo;s also a very willing playmaker</p>

<p>He does struggle more with precision on longer kickouts (that sometimes turn into bullets that throw the shooter off) , but he&rsquo;s able to make some pretty precise passes in crowded spaces that some wings a good deal smaller than him struggle with.</p>

If he’s looking they’re super accurate but his no-looks are pretty hit and miss. Bucks fans will all tell you he’s improved significantly as a passer since 2019 despite his assist numbers not really moving, and accuracy on his kick outs is exactly what we’re talking about.</p>

      <label for="la4nndk" class="commentText"><p>It’s more about lining the general orientation of the ball rather than timing it perfectly to hit their finger on a groove, that’s not even possible with the players moving their hands at an inconsistent speed. I’m a decent passer and I can adjust for that in certain situations at rec speed.</p>

<p>One tip is that if you’re getting someone a catch and shoot in the corner, you can line your hand over the cross section of the ball and push it to them stiffly, or if you are throwing a bounce pass out of the post you need to put backspin on it so that it’s mostly dead when it hits their hand and it stays in the orientation you pass it. In general if it’s spinning too quickly when it gets there they’re more likely to catch it awkwardly</p>

A buddy and I were once talking to this OG from his masjid who played D1 ball and then was a coach and trainer at a pro level for a good while. He was giving us pointers on how to use our fingertips in the grooves of the ball to manipulate it while dribbling to try and keep the laces oriented to ourselves for a quick shot. Watching him dribble around with all sorts of directional changes and us trying to swipe the ball and yet the ball was always lined up when the dribble got back in front of him. It was nuts</p>

      <label for="la5sonl" class="commentText"><p>It is.  Basically the way you release the ball out of the hands controls the way the balls gonna spin same way you alter the spin on a ball when you shoot. Sometimes who is bad at this is going to have the ball spinning sideways and top to bottom at the same time so when you catch it the grooves of the ball are going to be parallel with your finger tips instead of perpendicular. Most people don&rsquo;t like to shoot like that so they&rsquo;ll have to adjust the ball before shooting it or it&rsquo;ll be way off. The trick is to have the ball only spinning top to bottom as you release it off the pass.</p>

<p>Great passers put it right into the &ldquo;pocket&rdquo; where shooters like to easily catch and shoot though.</p>

      <label for="la5o069" class="commentText"><p>lmao it&rsquo;s absolutely BS that assumes the receiving player has their hands angled exactly matching the rotation of the pass.</p>

<p>Sure, you can throw a pass with perpendicular rotation but it&rsquo;s bullshit to think you&rsquo;re hitting the recipient in the groove every time.</p>

<p>You can also only do this consistently on a chest pass. Push pash, skip pass, drop pass or bounce pass - ie the majority of passes made in a game - nope.</p>

      <label for="la5ajrt" class="commentText"><p>Beverley is one of my least favorite players ever.</p>

<p>But acting like a guy that has played in the NBA for 16 seasons (19 years professionally, including overseas) with a career 37% 3 point percentage doesn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s talking about is insane.</p>

<p>Also, I would bet that he&rsquo;s absolutely right and that the average player is gonna shoot better getting the seams lined up right. Even if it doesn&rsquo;t <em>actually</em> have any tangible impact on how the ball travels or how much spin is on it, it has to do with muscle memory. Spot up shooting is a lot like a golf swing, imo. Your &ldquo;shot thoughts&rdquo; (like swing thoughts) are very important, and replicating the same motion each time is so important. It&rsquo;s one less variable to consider, at minimum.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re just shooting around, are you not gonna line the seams up? Do you know of anyone who doesn&rsquo;t line the seams up right when shooting a free throw? I don&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s a reason for that.</p>

<p>I agree that the pass being on target and in the pocket so the shooter goes into their motion naturally and quickly is way more important, but the seams lining up isn&rsquo;t entirely irrelevant.</p>

      <label for="la5p894" class="commentText"><p>I question if you&rsquo;ve never been a &ldquo;shooter&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s much more than a visual queue. The importance may be overstated, but it&rsquo;s absolutely easier to get proper backspin when the laces line up with your fingers/palm horizontally rather than vertically.</p>

<p>Even if your fingers aren&rsquo;t on the laces as you shoot, it&rsquo;s much nicer for the seams to be horizontally in your palms rather than have an odd lacing lining up vertically with your middle or index finger - placing them at a lower depth in the ball than the rest of your shooting hand.</p>
