      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ea9u4j/oc_how_would_each_nba_team_fare_in_a_battle_to/"><p>[OC] How would each NBA team fare in a battle to the death with its NFL counterpart?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><strong>ATLANTA: Hawks vs. Falcons</strong></p>

<p>Two majestic birds of prey, but the hawk and the falcon have different skill sets. Hawks are versatile hunters, patient and cunning. Falcons, however, are the jet fighters of the avian world, diving at speeds over 200 mph. The hawk might try some clever maneuvers, but the falcon’s sheer speed and precision in the air means it can outfly and outfight the hawk. Falcons, like the football team, can score quick and deadly strikes. <strong>RESULT: NFL wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>BOSTON: Celtics vs. Patriots</strong></p>

<p>The Celtics are just people from Ireland. The Patriots, armed with their revolutionary spirit and muskets, have an edge in firepower. The Patriots&rsquo; strategy is to overwhelm the Celtics with musket fire and tactical prowess. The Celtics are far outmatched in this historical showdown. <strong>RESULT: NFL wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>BROOKLYN: Nets vs. Giants/Jets</strong></p>

<p>Nets? Seriously, just nets? The Giants laugh and tear through them like cobwebs. The Jets could easily fly through and shred the nets with their turbines. It&rsquo;s not even a fight—more like an embarrassing tangle for the NBA team. Plus, Jets have already proven a tough foe for the city of New York. <strong>RESULT: NFL wins X2.</strong></p>

<p><strong>CHARLOTTE: Hornets vs. Panthers</strong></p>

<p>Hornets can swarm and sting, but Panthers are solitary, powerful predators. A panther, with its stealth and strength, would endure the stings and ultimately claw its way to victory. Even the most persistent hornet swarm would eventually succumb to the panther&rsquo;s relentless power. The panther&rsquo;s strategy is all about enduring and outlasting the opponent. <strong>RESULT: NFL wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>CHICAGO: Bulls vs. Bears</strong></p>

<p>It’s the ultimate heavyweight battle in the Windy City. The bull charges with its powerful horns, but the bear, with its massive size, strength, and claws, stands its ground. The bull may get in a few good hits, but unless the bear was to choke (understandable, given the NFL team), it would eventually overpower the bull with sheer brute force and strength. <strong>RESULT: NFL wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>CLEVELAND: Cavaliers vs. Browns</strong></p>

<p>The Cavaliers, clad in armor and wielding swords, ride in with chivalrous fury. The Browns, named after Paul Brown, are just regular folks. The Cavaliers’ superior combat skills and armor make short work of the Browns. It’s a medieval massacre. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>DALLAS: Mavericks vs. Cowboys</strong></p>

<p>Cowboys are rugged and resourceful, but Mavericks are rebels and outlaws with nothing to lose. The Mavericks fight dirty, using every trick in the book, from dynamite to ambushes. The Cowboys, despite their grit, are outmaneuvered by the cunning and ruthless Mavericks. It’s a wild, wild West shootout where the Mavericks’ desperation wins the day. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>DENVER: Nuggets vs. Broncos</strong></p>

<p>Gold miners with pickaxes and dynamite face off against wild stallions. The Nuggets, seasoned by harsh conditions and manual labor, use their explosives to set traps. The Broncos might stampede and kick, but the strategic use of dynamite and mining tools gives the Nuggets the upper hand. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>DETROIT: Pistons vs. Lions</strong></p>

<p>Pistons are mechanical and relentless, the embodiment of industrial strength. Lions, though fierce and powerful, can’t stand up to the tireless, crushing power of machinery. The Pistons, like an unstoppable factory line, grind the lions down. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>GOLDEN STATE: Warriors vs. 49ers</strong></p>

<p>Warriors are seasoned fighters, adept with swords, bows, and strategic combat. The 49ers, hardy gold prospectors, might have pickaxes and grit, but they’re no match for the Warriors&rsquo; disciplined and deadly combat skills. The Warriors quickly dispatch the 49ers in a flurry of blades and arrows. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>HOUSTON: Rockets vs. Texans</strong></p>

<p>Texans are tough and resourceful and have guns (presumably), but the Rockets have, well, rockets. A single launch, and the Texans are vaporized in a fiery explosion. The Rockets’ advanced technology and firepower easily outmatch the Texans&rsquo; rugged individualism. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>INDIANA: Pacers vs. Colts</strong></p>

<p>Pacers are racers, bred for speed and endurance. Colts are young horses, fast but inexperienced. In a straight race, the Pacers outrun the Colts. In a fight, the Pacers use their speed to dodge and tire out the Colts, eventually gaining the upper hand through sheer stamina. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>LA CLIPPERS: Clippers vs. Rams/Chargers</strong></p>

<p>Clippers are swift ships, masters of the sea. Rams are powerful, but they’re land-bound. The Clippers’ crew uses cannons and maritime tactics to blast the rams from a distance. The Rams have no way to retaliate against a naval bombardment. Chargers, however, represent lightning bolts. Unless the Clippers have serious conductive gear, they’re getting zapped. The Chargers’ electric power fries the Clippers. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins &amp; NFL wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>LA LAKERS: Lakers vs. Chargers/Rams</strong></p>

<p>Lakers are literally a lake, which isn&rsquo;t alive. Chargers, however, represent lightning bolts. The Chargers, represent lightning, but they can do nothing against a lake. Rams are powerful, but they’re land-bound. They can do nothing against a literal lake. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins X2.</strong></p>

<p><strong>TENNESSEE: Grizzlies vs. Titans</strong></p>

<p>Grizzlies are formidable predators, but Titans are gods, wielding divine power. The Grizzlies, despite their might and ferocity, are no match for the cosmic strength and wrath of the Titans. The Titans squash the bears with ease. <strong>RESULT: NFL wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>MIAMI: Heat vs. Dolphins</strong></p>

<p>The Heat, representing the oppressive, relentless force of nature, easily overwhelms the Dolphins. No aquatic mammal can withstand the scorching intensity of the Heat, which cooks the Dolphins alive. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>MILWAUKEE: Bucks vs. Packers</strong></p>

<p>Bucks are agile and strong, but Packers are robust, hardworking individuals. The Packers, wielding tools and driven by a relentless work ethic, overpower the Bucks in a rugged, physical showdown. <strong>RESULT: NFL wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>MINNESOTA: Timberwolves vs. Vikings</strong></p>

<p>Timberwolves are fierce and cunning, but Vikings are battle-hardened warriors. The Vikings, with their weapons and tactical skills, easily outfight the wolves. The wolves’ numbers and cunning are no match for Viking steel. <strong>RESULT: NFL wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>NEW ORLEANS: Pelicans vs. Saints</strong></p>

<p>Pelicans are awkward birds with large beaks, while Saints are divine beings with holy power. The Saints, using their divine abilities, smite the pelicans with heavenly might. <strong>RESULT: NFL wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>NEW YORK KNICKS: Knicks vs. Giants/Jets</strong></p>

<p>Knicks are pants. The Giants simply destroy them, and the Jets, having already proven a tough foe for the city of New York, could fly circles around them, slicing them from various angles. <strong>RESULT: NFL wins X2.</strong></p>

<p><strong>OKLAHOMA CITY: Thunder vs. Not Applicable</strong></p>

<p>There’s no NFL team here, but if there were, they’d be up against literal Thunder. Thunder, being an unstoppable force of nature, would crush any opposition. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins by default.</strong></p>

<p><strong>FLORIDA: Magic vs. Buccaneers</strong></p>

<p>Magic wields mystical powers, able to conjure spells and enchantments. Buccaneers, with their guns and swords, are no match for magical prowess. The Magic can cast spells to turn the Buccaneers into harmless creatures or disarm them entirely or kill them as well. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>PHILADELPHIA: 76ers vs. Eagles</strong></p>

<p>76ers are revolutionary war soldiers with muskets and cannons. Eagles, while majestic and powerful birds of prey, can be shot down with a well-aimed musket. The 76ers’ firepower overwhelms the Eagles. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>PHOENIX: Suns vs. Cardinals</strong></p>

<p>The Sun, a massive ball of nuclear fire, stands against Cardinals, small birds. The sheer heat and energy of the Sun incinerates the Cardinals instantly. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>PORTLAND: Trail Blazers vs. Not Applicable</strong></p>

<p>No NFL team here, but if there were, they’d be facing rugged pioneers equipped with survival skills and a will to persevere. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins by default.</strong></p>

<p><strong>SACRAMENTO: Kings vs. Not Applicable</strong></p>

<p>No NFL team here, but Kings are rulers with armies and power. Their sovereignty and military might ensure victory. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins by default.</strong></p>

<p><strong>SAN ANTONIO: Spurs vs. Not Applicable</strong></p>

<p>No NFL team here, but Spurs are metal tools designed to be worn on the heels of cowboy boots for the purpose of controlling a horse&rsquo;s movement and direction. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins by default.</strong></p>

<p><strong>TORONTO: Raptors vs. Not Applicable</strong></p>

<p>No NFL team here, but Raptors are deadly prehistoric predators. Their claws and teeth would easily tear through any opposition. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins by default.</strong></p>

<p><strong>UTAH: Jazz vs. Not Applicable</strong></p>

<p>No NFL team here, but the smooth, soothing power of Jazz can calm any beast. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins by default.</strong></p>

<p><strong>WASHINGTON: Wizards vs. Commanders</strong></p>

<p>Wizards wield powerful magic, while Commanders have modern military gear. Unless the Commanders have anti-magic defenses, they’re turned into frogs or blown away by magical blasts. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>SEATTLE: Not Applicable vs. Seahawks</strong></p>

<p>No NBA team here, but Seahawks are fierce birds of prey. If there were an NBA team, it would likely be shredded by the Seahawks’ talons and beaks. <strong>RESULT: NFL wins by default.</strong></p>

<p><strong>BALTIMORE: Not Applicable vs. Ravens</strong></p>

<p>No NBA team here, but Ravens are intelligent and resourceful birds. If there were an NBA team, it would be no match for the Ravens’ cunning. <strong>RESULT: NFL wins by default.</strong></p>

<p><strong>PITTSBURGH: Not Applicable vs. Steelers</strong></p>

<p>No NBA team here, but Steelers represent industrial strength and hard work. If there were an NBA team, it would be overpowered by the sheer force and resilience of the Steelers. <strong>RESULT: NFL wins by default.</strong></p>

<p><strong>KANSAS CITY: Not Applicable vs. Chiefs</strong></p>

<p>No NBA team here, but Chiefs are leaders and warriors. If there were an NBA team, it would be outmatched by the Chiefs’ leadership and combat skills. <strong>RESULT: NFL wins by default.</strong></p>

<p><strong>LAS VEGAS: Not Applicable vs. Raiders</strong></p>

<p>No NBA team here, but Raiders are ruthless pirates and plunderers. If there were an NBA team, it would be raided and defeated by the cunning and vicious Raiders. <strong>RESULT: NFL wins by default.</strong></p>

<p><strong>CINCINNATI: Not Applicable vs. Bengals</strong></p>

<p>No NBA team here, but Bengals are fierce tigers. If there were an NBA team, it would be torn apart by the Bengals’ claws and teeth. <strong>RESULT: NFL wins by default.</strong></p>

<p><strong>BUFFALO: Not Applicable vs. Bills</strong></p>

<p>No NBA team here, but Bills are powerful buffalo. If there were an NBA team, it would be trampled and overpowered by the Bills’ strength. <strong>RESULT: NFL wins by default.</strong></p>

<p><strong>FATALITY TALLY: NBA 23, NFL 23</strong></p>

<p>Looks like we ended in a tie!</p>

<p>Even if the Pats win, they are fighting a Guerilla war / insurgency for years to come.</p>

<p>Edit: I&rsquo;ve thought too much about this. If you are going historic, some pretty fierce warrior tribes. Also, for every &ldquo;ordinary person from Ireland&rdquo; that is a Celt, you have a fat person on a scooter at a Trump rally calling themselves a &lsquo;patriot&rsquo; too.</p>

      <label for="lek7v5f" class="commentText"><p>To be fair, the Patriots and Irish did both fight a guerilla war against the English. The Patriots won in a few years, it took the Irish a much longer time and even then they still don&rsquo;t control NI. So in comparison the Patriots are stronger. And besides the Celtics would eventually integrate into Patriot society, as history proved.</p>

<p>Now there are obvious differences. Period of time, distance from Great Britain etc&hellip; but those don&rsquo;t help my argument, so I will ignore those facts.</p>

<p>I suspect the Raptor would still win, but it’s not inconceivable that it wouldn’t, especially against the Lion IMO.</p>

<p>Against their CFL counterparts, the Argonauts, it would come down to what weapons the Argonaut would have. A skilled spear or sword wielder could possibly take down a Raptor.</p>

I think the question comes down to is this all 50 of the Argonauts against one Raptor? Or just one? And which one? One of the legends like Jason, Heracles, or Theseus? Or just some random one that no one has heard of? I&rsquo;m tempted to give it to the Argos.</p>

      <label for="leldoeg" class="commentText"><p>ChatGPT sucks. Shameless redo: non-GPT edition.</p>

<p><strong>ATLANTA: Hawks vs. Falcons</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll give the Falcons the win on this one solely because of the peregrine divebomb move. Probably could knock a hawk unconscious and go for the ol&rsquo; rip&rsquo;n&rsquo;tear ground game. <strong>RESULT: NFL wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>BOSTON: Celtics vs. Patriots</strong></p>

<p>This is a trick question. Informed by the logos we can see that patriots are confined to the tricorner hat and musket era whereas Celtics are unmoored in time, hopped up on leprechaun magic, potentially even coming from the future. Who knows what kind of firepower they&rsquo;ll bring to overwhelm the Adams family.  <strong>RESULT: NBA wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>BROOKLYN: Nets vs. Giants/Jets</strong></p>

<p>Sure, the Giants cast nets aside with ease but Jets? Have you seen a plane fly into a sturdy net? Neither have I, but I assume those wings are shearing right the fuck off (especially given Boeing&rsquo;s recent quality control). <strong>RESULT: NFL wins 1; NBA wins 1.</strong></p>

<p><strong>CHARLOTTE: Hornets vs. Panthers</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen cats with ONE bee sting whose faces balloon to gorilla size. A whole swarm of Hornets? That cat is going anaphylactic. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>CHICAGO: Bulls vs. Bears</strong></p>

<p>Toss-up tbh, but assuming this is a grizzly&hellip; fine. <strong>RESULT: NFL wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>CLEVELAND: Cavaliers vs. Browns</strong></p>

<p>Meet the Browns will end about as well as Meet the Grahams did for Drake. Cavaliers are peeling the layers back on the Brown family in a more literal Dahmerish sense.
<strong>RESULT: NBA wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>DALLAS: Mavericks vs. Cowboys</strong></p>

<p>MAVERICKS ARE HORSES. Going off the logo, these are literal Mavericks and not Top Gun characters. Cowboys merk ez. <strong>RESULT: NFL wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>DENVER: Nuggets vs. Broncos</strong></p>

<p>Nuggets are not miners, they&rsquo;re soft rocks. Broncos are making gold dust tonight. <strong>RESULT: NFL wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>DETROIT: Pistons vs. Lions</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, whatever the Pistons are powering is running the poor lions down. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>GOLDEN STATE: Warriors vs. 49ers</strong></p>

<p>Idk what weapons the warriors are bringing but I gotta give them the edge over the prospectors. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>HOUSTON: Rockets vs. Texans</strong></p>

<p>gg Texans, pink mist time. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>INDIANA: Pacers vs. Colts</strong></p>

<p>The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. Colts are quick, but eventually they&rsquo;ll tire whereas the FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is eternal. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>LA CLIPPERS: Clippers vs. Rams/Chargers</strong></p>

<p>I was going to say Chargers were horses, but given the lightning bolt logo I think they genuinely might just be phone chargers. Clippers bombard the shit outta the sheep and household electronics. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins X2.</strong></p>

<p><strong>LA LAKERS: Lakers vs. Chargers/Rams</strong></p>

<p>Lakers are not lakes. They are boats that go on lakes. I&rsquo;m assuming these boats have crews, and people beat sheep and phone accessories every time. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins X2.</strong></p>

<p><strong>TENNESSEE: Grizzlies vs. Titans</strong></p>

<p>Literal god-spawners vs Smokey. <strong>RESULT: NFL wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>MIAMI: Heat vs. Dolphins</strong></p>

<p>Dolphin bbq <strong>RESULT: NBA wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>MILWAUKEE: Bucks vs. Packers</strong></p>

<p>Judging by how deer season turns out for bucks every year, I&rsquo;m betting on the cheeseheads. <strong>RESULT: NFL wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>MINNESOTA: Timberwolves vs. Vikings</strong></p>

<p>Just one Viking would lose to the pack, but a whole warband takes the Wolves out. <strong>RESULT: NFL wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>NEW ORLEANS: Pelicans vs. Saints</strong></p>

<p>Pelicans lose to literally everything on this list. Saints win this without even invoking divine power.  <strong>RESULT: NFL wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>NEW YORK KNICKS: Knicks vs. Giants/Jets</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Knicks are pants.&rdquo; <strong>RESULT: NFL wins X2.</strong></p>

<p><strong>FLORIDA: Magic vs. Buccaneers</strong></p>

<p>Raw magic? Bucs are about to be in the shadow realm. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>PHILADELPHIA: 76ers vs. Eagles</strong></p>

<p>Muskets and grapeshot &amp;gt; birds. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>PHOENIX: Suns vs. Cardinals</strong></p>

<p>BBQ Chicken! <strong>RESULT: NBA wins.</strong></p>

<p><strong>WASHINGTON: Wizards vs. Commanders</strong></p>

<p>Wizards are teleporting Commies into the sun. <strong>RESULT: NBA wins.</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not counting the default wins because that shit is boring</p>

<p><strong>FATALITY TALLY: NBA 17, NFL 11</strong></p>

<p>NBA Wins.</p>

<p>P.S. OP, your final tally is off.</p>

<p>I mean the linemen alone would win. Not just because they are big but because they are made to defend the most critical members of their team.</p>

<p>HOUSTON: Rockets vs. Texans</p>

<p>Texans are tough and resourceful and have guns (presumably), but the Rockets have, well, rockets. A single launch, and the Texans are vaporized in a fiery explosion. The Rockets’ advanced technology and firepower easily outmatch the Texans&rsquo; rugged individualism. RESULT: NBA wins.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m disputing this result.  When a rocket explodes, the rocket dies because it exploded.  So at best it&rsquo;s a tie.  At worst, the Texans survive and it&rsquo;s a loss.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>thought the Browns had the Elf-looking mascot too? And doesn’t superstition beat or support most teams of armed folks?</p></li>

<li><p>Raptors vs nada… but if they are extinct, doesn’t that technically make a case for the NBA losing that one?</p></li>

<li><p>there’s no such animal as a seahawk… this should be an NFL loss</p></li>

<li><p>didn’t the Oregon trail teach us that trailblazers can be defeated by things they cannot see?</p></li>
