<p>The NBA is hiring for a gig expected to take the league into the next phase of replay.</p>

<p><strong>On Tuesday night, the league posted a job for a technical lead manager, a position that is expected to build out its own team and “develop and deploy automated officiating capabilities to impact every game of the NBA season.”</strong></p>

<p>The job comes at a time when professional sports continue to lean more and more into technology to decide games. Major tennis tournaments use a fully automated Hawk-Eye system for boundary challenges; baseball is working out whether to use an automated strike zone or introduce a challenge system for balls and strikes; the NFL recently decided its optical tracking system for first downs wasn’t quite ready for prime time. European soccer is still struggling with implementing its Video Assisted Referee replay system.</p>

<p>This past season marked the NBA’s first in a partnership with Sony’s Hawk-Eye and mostly used it to assist with deciding out-of-bounds and goaltending calls this past season, a source familiar with the partnership told Front Office Sports. Hawk-Eye supplies the system widely adopted by tennis and is contributing to the development of the automated strike zone in baseball.</p>

<p>The NBA has said before that it hopes to use Hawk-Eye to develop a system to help with calls involving boundary calls—for example, contested plays involving the three-point shot or out-of-bounds lines—and goaltending. Unlike some other sports, basketball will seemingly always require some human element to judge fouls.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Hawk-Eye, which is owned by Sony, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p><strong>After a full season with the technology, the league decided to have an internal hire whose main responsibility is working with and developing new ways to implement it, the source familiar with the partnership said.</strong></p>

      <label for="lkjsej4" class="commentText"><p>Only thing with Hawkeye is that usually the question isn’t whether the player stepped on the line or not it’s whether they released the ball before they did. Kind of like VAR in Europe.</p>

<p>I think the scope of automated refereeing in contact sports is minimal at best.</p>

      <label for="lkjsrdg" class="commentText"><p>Same thing with using the ball for the chains in football. You don’t just need the ball’s location, you need to sync it with the frame in which the player was downed. Not as simple as tennis. It’s achievable, though.</p>

      <label for="lkl1fxu" class="commentText"><p>that&rsquo;s easy enough to do if you have multiple cameras that are all on the same time sync. the problem is getting the automation to make the call - it&rsquo;s much easier to have a ref look at it and say here are these two frames and they show he has the ball AND his foot is on the line</p>

      <label for="lkl1s6r" class="commentText"><p>Yeah the automation is what we’re talking about. You can obviously technically have someone watch the play, determine the frame at which they were downed, and then use the location of the ball at that frame (or whatever sport specific use case is needed). Automating that is the question.</p>

      <label for="lklqucy" class="commentText"><p>Footballs have sensors to detect contact.  So sending whether they released the ball or not before stepping on the line isn’t as big a deal as you think it is.</p>

<p>Aside from gather step rules, everything is pretty objective to decide and shouldn’t be a problem.</p>

      <label for="lkllqaf" class="commentText"><p>They need to implement a system where the decision is made by the time the refs make it to the scorers table. It would only take 1-2 “replay technicians” glued to a screen somewhere. Quickly assess all available angles and call in a decision by the time the ref is in the mic.</p>

They’re happening constantly all game long. You can’t call all of them. So in order to train that AI, you’d need to be able to tell it right from wrong. We don’t have an ability to do that even with infinite time.</p>
