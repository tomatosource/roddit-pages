      <label for="l73x6sb" class="commentText"><p>I think most star players who end up coaching feel this way. As a player you&rsquo;re able to have direct control over the situation. No matter how much a coach plans for something, actual game flow is going to be different and those type of guys would prefer to be playing and control what actually happens. </p>

<p>When Kidd made his overly-memed statement that at end of the day &ldquo;he&rsquo;s just watching like everyone else&rdquo;, this is what he clearly meant. As a player, especially as the point guard, Kidd was making things happen himself. As a coach, he has to make up the blueprint, but then watch and hope that his players execute it. </p>

<p>I remember even Larry Bird mentioned that that he found this aspect really difficult when he was the coach of the Pacers. And even MJ, albeit as a GM and not a player, found it so infuriating to have to sit back watch a game that he felt he could impact better, that he unretired and joined the Wizards as a player. </p>

<p>I think during his stints as the Brooklyn and Milwaukee HC, he had higher expectations with players&rsquo; work ethics, and maybe that rubbed some people the wrong way.  It sounded like he lowered his demands for that in LA as an assistant coach and now in Dallas. </p>

<p>In some cases it seems like they also often can&rsquo;t relate to dudes working their hardest who just don&rsquo;t have the same level of natural talent. They feel like &ldquo;well I could do it, why can&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; when even most pros could never possibly be an all-time great no much how much study and effort they put into it.</p>

<p>There’s a good chance that the greats never have to explain why or how they see the game, and so never develop those communication skills. You cant coach an offense on the right habits if you yourself cant communicate those good habits</p>

<p>Its like trying to teach someone to breath. Yeah im good at it, but fuck if i can tel someone else how go do it</p>

      <label for="l74fh7n" class="commentText"><p>I coach. Yes, we are literally &ldquo;just watching&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a shame so many people wanted to meme it, but it&rsquo;s very true.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I will never score a bucket, block a shot, grab a rebound, or get a stop. I can give up some points if I lose my cool, but that&rsquo;s about it. I&rsquo;m just strongly suggesting ways to get points and stops at the end of the day.</p>

<p>Coaching is hard. Fun as hell, but it&rsquo;s not anything at all like playing and is why a lot of great players struggle to crossover to coaching. Conversely, it&rsquo;s also why a lot of great coaches tend to either have been bad players or not played at all. You can&rsquo;t judge a coach by their playing ability just like you can&rsquo;t judge a pitcher by his hitting ability. It&rsquo;s just different.</p>

<p>The benchwarmer has a lot of exposure listening to the coach and watching plays in real time, as well as familiarity with the feeling that they don&rsquo;t have control over the game.</p>

      <label for="l75iacg" class="commentText"><p>I never thought of it that way but it&rsquo;s a logical assumption.</p>

<p>My experience with this idea is in the form of working with coaches who were legit players (former pros/D1/small college legend). Sometimes they tend to struggle with breaking down concepts because for them, it was just easy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard a coach (excellent player; former freshman of the year in a major D1 conference) tell a kid repeatedly &ldquo;You just got to make it&rdquo; when asked how he can shoot better. Really struggled to help the kid break down his jumper and mechanics and stuff. For this coach, he had just been so used to being a good shooter, he wasn&rsquo;t forced to learn super intricate details to become a better shooter. Obviously, he had a lot of other strengths in different areas, but it was an interesting moment that stood out to me nonetheless.</p>

<p>I think that a lot of people really do just think of coaching on a surface level; they don&rsquo;t realize that there are a breadth of responsibilities and skills that go into it, it&rsquo;s not just Xs and Os. Which is where I think a lot of former players struggle to adapt to as coaches.</p>

Like I get that an MJ or Bird would get frustrated because their so used to have such a major impact on the game, but a bench guy that ends up a coach never had that level of impact on the game so would they find that same kind of frustration?</p>

      <label for="l7446ya" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I think that&rsquo;s a good question. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure to some extent role players feel this way too. They were probably stars in high-school and college, and are still used to making a direct impact on games.</p>

<p>But I also think most NBA role players get used to having to impact games in other ways, which is something that star player never had to even think to do.  You often hear that these role-players turned Head Coaches, were really important during practices as a player or in getting in other players&rsquo; ears on the bench. They probably also got used to having to watch the critical moments of a game from the bench, without being able to directly impact those moments. </p>

<p>I think all those skills generally lend themselves well to coaching, which is why we see way more sucessful role-players as coaches than star players as coaches. </p>

      <label for="l74wxyg" class="commentText"><p>Expanding on that thought, it&rsquo;s not too surprising that one of the all-time great players would find some adjacent task in which he&rsquo;s good but not an all-time great to be more difficult.</p>

<p>A hall of fame basketball player will find playing chess at a high level more difficult than playing basketball at a high level, and an all-time great chess player will find playing basketball at a high level more difficult than playing chess at a high level.</p>

<p>All-time greats in any field are all-time greats in large part because they are extreme outliers in their natural intuitive ability to learn and develop and innovate in that field. That natural talent makes the field feel much easier to them than the average person (though yes, they still need to work hard, etc.&ndash; it&rsquo;s a relative thing).</p>

<p>Also, if they were a star player, they were in the top 1-2% of the league. As a coach, even if they&rsquo;re pretty good, they&rsquo;re probably not as good a coach as they were a player.</p>

<p>like it sounds like cope but it’s true to an extent, like you can scheme up and draw up all the
plays in the world but sometimes people just miss and there’s not really anything you do but watch if you’re a coach</p>

      <label for="l760pp0" class="commentText"><p>No chance CP3 is above him IMO. Kidd went to 3 finals and got a championship. I think their resumes and statistics are very similar to each other but Kidd’s championship really gives him the edge. He was instrumental in the 2011 championship even though he was past his prime, something Paul has tried and failed to be in his twilight years. I don’t think that Mavs team was very much better than the teams CP3 has been on the last few seasons either.</p>

      <label for="l74sszq" class="commentText"><p>My opinion on Kidd as a coach has changed significantly during this run. He is just not a regular season coach - doesn’t call many timeouts, not a great X and O’s guy on ATOs, and some of his lineups are horrendous.</p>

<p>That was all annoying until I and others connected the dots that his confidence in the team to make it to the playoffs regardless of seed due to Luka, Kyrie, and the rest of the squad gives him flexibility to test different lineups every game against different potential opponents.</p>

<p>It was a lot less justifiable when we would barely be able to make the Playoffs prior to the 2022 run because we barely had a consistent starter in each slot, let alone the depth to make a deep run. We made it through to the WCF on the collective efforts of Luka, Brunson and an insane 3PT% run.</p>

<p>After watching this run, his ability to make good and necessary challenges has been unmatched. His confidence builds the more we play a specific team, not less. He trusts that the guys figure it out, even though he has not-so-great media skills when pressured. Can’t argue with the results though.</p>

<p>Glad the roster can now reflect his abilities as a player-friendly coach; it’s a lot easier when you have multiple all-star caliber players with drive.</p>

      <label for="l753pnh" class="commentText"><p>I don’t really view it as a binary of right and wrong, just what seems to be a reasonable decision given the circumstances. With that flair I know you’ve seen just as many Luka stepback heaves down 2 out of a double that bricked, but a lot of that came down to us literally not having the firepower or confidence to trust any of the role players to hit that clutch of a shot and carry a significant minutes load due to depth and injury issues.</p>

<p>I could still have an opinion about his value as a coach without saying I could have coached them better. Who tf am I?</p>

<p>As I said originally, I’ve seen the errors of my conclusions and changed my mind on Kidd as a coach. Turns out he just needed a lineup not consisting 75% of players that would be last man on the bench or out of the league in most other competitor squads to show his skills.</p>

      <label for="l76knfo" class="commentText"><p>For him it is. The first time he coached it didn&rsquo;t work out so well. But as a player, he found it all worked beautifully. But for others who didn&rsquo;t make it as a star player or battled their backside off to be a role player , coaching came easier. It just depends a little on the individual talents of the person.</p>

<p>Someone should tell Jason Kidd to be the coach of the Hornets then.  Let&rsquo;s see what he can do without the &ldquo;players&rdquo;.  Let&rsquo;s see what he can do without Luka running the show</p>
