      <p>I&rsquo;m hearing some very intelligent analysts saying that PG writing an obituary on PG&rsquo;s run with the Clippers, saying that they were unbeatable when Kawhi and PG were both on the floor together but they were never on the floor together, but they don&rsquo;t bring up that he&rsquo;s likely going to have the exact some problem in Philly.  Is he going to have the same problems with Joel that he had with Kawhi, or are there factors that will make this a different animal?</p>

<p>Derrick Rose’s cuts at full speed and drives to the rim made me wince and I didn’t think it would be good for him long term.</p>

<p>Giannis too but to a lesser degree than Rose. It seems to be a worse effect for guards than for bigger guys</p>

      <label for="lbla219" class="commentText"><p>Giannis really needs to spend some time to work on his post moves as well as his jump shot (whether that’s from the mid range or the 3) to lessen the burden on his knees and legs going into his 30s. Even a robot like LeBron can’t sustain the type of playstyle Giannis and started shooting way more 3s and got into the post more as he aged.</p>

<p>You hear about all of these superstars and their crazy partying, poor nutrition, etc. Then after they retire, they get on podcasts to talk about how they wish they&rsquo;d paid more attention to this sort of thing earlier. LeBron&rsquo;s already on podcasts talking about how long he&rsquo;s been paying attention, and how he keeps refining as new research, techniques become available. He&rsquo;s chasing 0.1% improvements, hoping they all add up. You&rsquo;d think everyone in the league would be doing the same, but it&rsquo;s obviously not the case.</p>

Lebron has played in 70 or more games (or nearly all games for lockout/shortened seasons in 2020 and 2012) in 16 of 21 seasons. This is also not including making 8 straight finals (10 total) which at minimum is 16 playoff games per season.</p>

      <label for="lbj3dpm" class="commentText"><p>True, but he also played 73 games last year and has never played less than 61 games in a season. Some of his playoff issues have been just bad timing. Embiid and Kawhi are in a different stratosphere. Embiid has never played more than 68 games in a season and he&rsquo;s a massive human being. Guys that big with consistent injury histories don&rsquo;t tend to age all that well. I have serious doubts that Embiid or Kahwi will ever be able to make it through an entire deep playoff run with good health. I think part of the issue with Giannis is that he plays so damn hard through the entire regular season. I think a smart organization would try to start managing his minutes a little bit through the second half of the season but they&rsquo;re so reliant on him that it may not be possible.</p>

      <label for="lbjd64o" class="commentText"><p>Thank you for actually having a brain. People are trying to start the narrative of Giannis being injury prone when it’s more bad luck than anything else.</p>

<p>In 2020, he sprained his ankle in the playoffs after a healthy regular season. If he did that in December verses in the playoffs, nobody would even remember the injury.</p>

<p>In 2021 he hyperextended his knee and missed around 2 weeks after being healthy for most of the regular season. Again, if he did that in the regular season, nobody would care.</p>

<p>Healthy in 2022</p>

<p>In 2023 he had that wrist sprain that kept him out of the all star game and missed around 2 weeks as well, but was healthy the rest of the regular season. Then he hurt his back and missed two games.</p>

<p>Now this year was the first time he truly sustained a “major injury”. He would have been out for at least one month if not 2, so I’d give them this year.</p>

<p>Every year but this year Giannis has been healthy for most of the season, then gets a minor injury in the playoffs. I wouldn’t lump Giannis with Kawhi, Embiid and AD who miss time in the regular season and in the playoffs almost every year</p>

      <label for="lbirtyz" class="commentText"><p>Great point. I&rsquo;d imagine that may translate to an extra round vs Kawhi, though I&rsquo;m skeptical of Joel&rsquo;s ability to make it through an extended playoff run healthy enough to get them all the way. Maybe they can try something exotic like just shutting him down 15 games before the playoffs and ramping him back up the last few games. I&rsquo;m not completely sure they&rsquo;ve tried everything in the way I&rsquo;m completely sure Kawhi will never make it through another deep playoff run as a main cog.</p>

<p>Realistically Embiid should lose 15-20 lbs, which would help immensely with the stress that gets put on his knees.</p>

Most of the other season, Kawhi only edges him by a few games, but it&rsquo;s pretty eerie how, in a typical season, they play pretty close to the same number of games.</p>

<p>Butler yes
Harden turned out alright with the clips. He even gave Embiid a Rolex for the most under seeing MVP that year.</p>

<p>Embiid is not a leader, thinks he is but can’t take the team to greatness. Kawhi has climbed that mountain more than once.</p>

<p>However, I will say most of PG’s extended absences were not really “injury prone” type injuries. His tenure there started recovering from surgery in both shoulders, then Nurkic jumped on PG’s elbow fighting for a loose ball, then Lu Dort bent PG’s knee backwards while going for a ball he had no chance of getting.</p>

I doubt he&rsquo;s suddenly discovered the fountain of youth at 34. This season was likely more of an outlier. The chances are, both he and Embiid play about 50 games this season.</p>

      <label for="lblywvq" class="commentText"><p>Both are injury prone, but the regular season wasn&rsquo;t really the sticking point.  Embiid is always injured for the playoffs, but he also manages to play unless it&rsquo;s something really bad and often plays through injuries that would keep him out for weeks if it were the regular season.  Embiid missing regular season time obviously hurts Philly with seeding and not having him at full strength in the playoffs definitely isn&rsquo;t good for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Kawhi has barely played in any playoff games for the Clippers, so it really negates whatever he does in the regular season if he&rsquo;s not available when it matter the most.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter how many regular season games somebody plays if they&rsquo;re never even available for the playoffs.</p>
