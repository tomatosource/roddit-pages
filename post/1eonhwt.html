</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Really unlucky for them.</p>

<p>They have the best player in the world at his PEAK. Undisputable best Serbian as well. 6 out of their best 7 players hits the sweet spot of their peaks too.</p>

<p>Avramovic - 29 yo</p>

<p>Micic - 30 yo</p>

<p>Dobric - 29 yo</p>

<p>Bogdaniovic - 31 yo</p>

<p>Milutinov - 29 yo</p>

<p>Jokic - 29 yo</p>

<p>These are 6 players competing at the peak of their careers. Petrusev is only 24.</p>

<p>Yes their future may be bright with Topic, Jovic but I feel like this team is already their golden team.</p>

<p>Next Olympic, everyone may be back but at the twilight of their careers. Topic and Jovic might be contributing. Petrusev is the only guy at his peak. It will be interesting.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s different because teams like Germany and Spain will always have what ifs (Dirk, Gasol). Australia unfortunately had a mix of upcoming (Giddey, Daniels) and twilight stars (Mills).</p>

<p>Canada will be the favorites next Olympics with their potential best Canadian player and core at their peak. Shai (30), RJ (28), Murray (31), Nembhard (28), Dort (28), Brooks (32), Clarke (31), Edey (26)</p>

<p>France may be 2 olympics from their best form with Wemby (28), Coulibaly (28), Risacher (27), Sarr (27), Strazel (30) but they even already started NOW and continue to be dominant next olympics</p>

<p>All-star selections are very influenced by fame and reputation, and the teams are <em>small</em> compared to the size of the league.</p>

<p>Think of every player <em>not</em> on team USA. American players <em>turn down the opportunity!</em> that&rsquo;s the whole reason they lost in 04! They sent NBA rookies and sophomores and won bronze.</p>

<p>Serbia played USA in the final of the Olympics 1996 and only two years after that became world champion. Also, Serbia won against USA in Indianapolis 2002 and later became World champion on that games.</p>

<p>The name of the state was SR Yugoslavia, but this should differ from Former Yugoslavia (which included Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia, Macedonia). Bassically, SR Yugoslavia consisted of Serbia and Montenegro, but this is pretty much the same nation.</p>

<p>Therefore, Setbia is quite consisted in major tournaments, and hopeffuly this will remain the same.</p>

      <label for="lhf3itc" class="commentText"><p>I donâ€™t think Jokic will have any issues playing at the next Olympics, he will be just as dominant. Obviously 2032 would be a major concern, but in 2028 he should be pretty much just as good as now. They would need a primary ball-handler though, because Bogdanovic would be too old for that role full-time unless he somehow finds whatever LBJ has been drinking over the last 5 years.</p>

<p>This is lining up to potentially be an upset Olympics for Team USAâ€™s basketball with France (their youth entering prime) and Canada (fully in prime) becoming real threats - with Serbia similarly lurking in the shadows and depending on what Jovic and Topic can become, maybe becoming a true threat themselves - to unseat the US team that doesnâ€™t have a clear direction post-LBJ-KD-Curry.</p>

      <label for="lhf4c6o" class="commentText"><p>Oh yeah I wasn&rsquo;t really talking about next Olympics specifically (my fault, I kinda forgot what this thread was about). Jokic should definitely be good enough to wreck havoc in 4 years.</p>

<p>Team USA is for sure going to end up paying for their lack of continuity at some point, unless they start taking the World Cup seriously and making it mandatory for players to commit to a 4-year cycle. They&rsquo;re still gonna be the most talented team for a long time (especially depth-wise), but we&rsquo;re clearly seeing that it&rsquo;s not gonna be enough to just send all their stars once every 4 years and roll through the competition like they used to be able to do. I hope it happens because as amazing as the Olympics are, the World Cup is just a way better setup for a basketball tournament, and would be even better if USA started treating it like they do the Olympics.</p>

      <label for="lherklw" class="commentText"><p>No it&rsquo;s not, the 2028 team might be even better.</p>

<p>Jovic just had the best season of his career as the starting power forward for a playoff team and has tons of potential.</p>

<p>We also have guys like Topic and Djurisic, who were just drafted, and it will be interesting to see how Pokusevski, Vukcevic and Smailagic further develop in the next four years.</p>

<p>None of the current guys would be really old in 2028, Bogdan will be the oldest at 35 and I&rsquo;m pretty sure he&rsquo;ll still be on the team due to his sheer will and leadership, Jokic&rsquo;s game isn&rsquo;t depending on athleticism so he&rsquo;ll still be a similar player that he is today in four years as well etc.</p>

<p>Besides all that, our 2002 World Cup winning squad was also tremendously stacked.</p>

<p>We had Divac and Stojakovic as starters for a team that made the WCF, Bodiroga is one of the best Euroleague players of all-time and arguably the best player never to play in the NBA, Jaric was an All-Euroleague First Team selection that year, Rakocevic averaged 18 PPG in the Euroleague that season (both were signed by NBA teams that summer), Tomasevic was an All-Euroleague First Team selection that year as well, Drobnjak was a solid NBA backup center, Vujanic was an All-Euroleague Second Team selection and the Euroleague Top Scorer the following season, Gurovic was a great shooter etc.</p>

<p>That team was as stacked as it could be for a non-US national team.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a small pool, and includes <em>one</em> all star. An MVP candidate, but only one player.</p>

<p>None of the others would even make a short list for team USA, and in four years <em>maybe</em> one more?</p>

<p>The USA has hundreds of players, and there will be some breakouts that you thought were marginal this year and will be no brainers in 4 years.</p>

<p>Challenge idea:</p>

<p>How many &ldquo;Team USA&rsquo;s&rdquo; can you make that are &ldquo;better&rdquo; than Team Canada&rsquo;s line-up?</p>

<p>USA should be the #1 contender for the forseeable future simply because their youth pipeline is several centuries ahead of the rest of the world while NBA is the strongest and richest league by far.</p>

<p>But USA teams always gravitate towards iso heavy, fast paced style while good EU teams have good fundementals and contrary to popular belief don&rsquo;t rely on just 1 guy.</p>

<p>Hopefully there&rsquo;s more close games in the future like the one we just saw yesterday. World is gaining ground on USA and that&rsquo;s a good thing for the sport.</p>

      <label for="lhev1do" class="commentText"><p>Jokic is not the best player in the world.  Not sure why people keep trying to push that narrative.  Had Embiid not been injured he most likely would have had the MVP.  And not Embiid is not the best player in the world either.</p>

      <label for="lhf50d8" class="commentText"><p>You really have to be basketball enthusiast to see what Jokic is producing on the court. I also beleive that he is not the best player in the world, but he shares basketball magic. Also, he is making his teammated 50% better than they really are.</p>

<p>Embid is not really close to Jokic. He is very good athlete thouhg.</p>
