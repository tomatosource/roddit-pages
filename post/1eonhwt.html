</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Really unlucky for them.</p>

<p>They have the best player in the world at his PEAK. Undisputable best Serbian as well. 6 out of their best 7 players hits the sweet spot of their peaks too.</p>

<p>Avramovic - 29 yo</p>

<p>Micic - 30 yo</p>

<p>Dobric - 29 yo</p>

<p>Bogdaniovic - 31 yo</p>

<p>Milutinov - 29 yo</p>

<p>Jokic - 29 yo</p>

<p>These are 6 players competing at the peak of their careers. Petrusev is only 24.</p>

<p>Yes their future may be bright with Topic, Jovic but I feel like this team is already their golden team.</p>

<p>Next Olympic, everyone may be back but at the twilight of their careers. Topic and Jovic might be contributing. Petrusev is the only guy at his peak. It will be interesting.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s different because teams like Germany and Spain will always have what ifs (Dirk, Gasol). Australia unfortunately had a mix of upcoming (Giddey, Daniels) and twilight stars (Mills).</p>

<p>Canada will be the favorites next Olympics with their potential best Canadian player and core at their peak. Shai (30), RJ (28), Murray (31), Nembhard (28), Dort (28), Brooks (32), Clarke (31), Edey (26)</p>

<p>France may be 2 olympics from their best form with Wemby (28), Coulibaly (28), Risacher (27), Sarr (27), Strazel (30) but they even already started NOW and continue to be dominant next olympics</p>

<p>All-star selections are very influenced by fame and reputation, and the teams are <em>small</em> compared to the size of the league.</p>

<p>Think of every player <em>not</em> on team USA. American players <em>turn down the opportunity!</em> that&rsquo;s the whole reason they lost in 04! They sent NBA rookies and sophomores and won bronze.</p>

      <label for="lherklw" class="commentText"><p>No it&rsquo;s not, the 2028 team might be even better.</p>

<p>Jovic just had the best season of his career as the starting power forward for a playoff team and has tons of potential.</p>

<p>We also have guys like Topic and Djurisic, who were just drafted, and it will be interesting to see how Pokusevski, Vukcevic and Smailagic further develop in the next four years.</p>

<p>None of the current guys would be really old in 2028, Bogdan will be the oldest at 35 and I&rsquo;m pretty sure he&rsquo;ll still be on the team due to his sheer will and leadership, Jokic&rsquo;s game isn&rsquo;t depending on athleticism so he&rsquo;ll still be a similar player that he is today in four years as well etc.</p>

<p>Besides all that, our 2002 World Cup winning squad was also tremendously stacked.</p>

<p>We had Divac and Stojakovic as starters for a team that made the WCF, Bodiroga is one of the best Euroleague players of all-time and arguably the best player never to play in the NBA, Jaric was an All-Euroleague First Team selection that year, Rakocevic averaged 18 PPG in the Euroleague that season (both were signed by NBA teams that summer), Tomasevic was an All-Euroleague First Team selection that year as well, Drobnjak was a solid NBA backup center, Vujanic was an All-Euroleague Second Team selection and the Euroleague Top Scorer the following season, Gurovic was a great shooter etc.</p>

<p>That team was as stacked as it could be for a non-US national team.</p>

      <label for="lhf12zp" class="commentText"><p>You gotta admit that having someone as great as Jokic isn&rsquo;t likely to happen again though (or at least not soon), and at this high level play having someone of his caliber that defenses have to double team every time he touches the ball is absolutely huge.</p>

<p>But yeah, Serbia is just a talent factory, they will always have a great team. They&rsquo;re nothing like for example Spain who had a golden generation but struggles to consistently produce top-level players, Serbia will be just fine.</p>

      <label for="lhf3itc" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think Jokic will have any issues playing at the next Olympics, he will be just as dominant. Obviously 2032 would be a major concern, but in 2028 he should be pretty much just as good as now. They would need a primary ball-handler though, because Bogdanovic would be too old for that role full-time unless he somehow finds whatever LBJ has been drinking over the last 5 years.</p>

<p>This is lining up to potentially be an upset Olympics for Team USA’s basketball with France (their youth entering prime) and Canada (fully in prime) becoming real threats - with Serbia similarly lurking in the shadows and depending on what Jovic and Topic can become, maybe becoming a true threat themselves - to unseat the US team that doesn’t have a clear direction post-LBJ-KD-Curry.</p>

      <label for="lhf4c6o" class="commentText"><p>Oh yeah I wasn&rsquo;t really talking about next Olympics specifically (my fault, I kinda forgot what this thread was about). Jokic should definitely be good enough to wreck havoc in 4 years.</p>

<p>Team USA is for sure going to end up paying for their lack of continuity at some point, unless they start taking the World Cup seriously and making it mandatory for players to commit to a 4-year cycle. They&rsquo;re still gonna be the most talented team for a long time (especially depth-wise), but we&rsquo;re clearly seeing that it&rsquo;s not gonna be enough to just send all their stars once every 4 years and roll through the competition like they used to be able to do. I hope it happens because as amazing as the Olympics are, the World Cup is just a way better setup for a basketball tournament, and would be even better if USA started treating it like they do the Olympics.</p>

<p>Serbia played USA in the final of the Olympics 1996 and only two years after that became world champion. Also, Serbia won against USA in Indianapolis 2002 and later became World champion on that games.</p>

<p>The name of the state was SR Yugoslavia, but this should differ from Former Yugoslavia (which included Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia, Macedonia). Bassically, SR Yugoslavia consisted of Serbia and Montenegro, but this is pretty much the same nation.</p>

<p>Therefore, Setbia is quite consisted in major tournaments, and hopeffuly this will remain the same.</p>

These guys are Euroleague starters, who we constantly produce a bunch of and should not have a problem producing more of in the future if all stays well.</p>

<p>Our teams are just very well structured and usually coached well so players have the ability to break out and play outstandingly in these international tournaments.</p>

<p>Its questionable if we will have another generation soon that can go toe-to-toe with a US team that has KD, Lebron, Curry, Embiid, Ant, Booker and all the others at the same time, but I feel confident that we will continue competing for medals against just about everyone else.</p>

<p>None of the others would even make a short list for team USA, and in four years <em>maybe</em> one more?</p>

For the past decade their main national team consistently sent their B or C team on events and still medaled. This isn&rsquo;t even top 5 Serbian team ever.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m more worried about USA team future. Who is replacing LeBron/Curry/KD production?</p>

<p>USA should be the #1 contender for the forseeable future simply because their youth pipeline is several centuries ahead of the rest of the world while NBA is the strongest and richest league by far.</p>

<p>But USA teams always gravitate towards iso heavy, fast paced style while good EU teams have good fundementals and contrary to popular belief don&rsquo;t rely on just 1 guy.</p>

<p>Hopefully there&rsquo;s more close games in the future like the one we just saw yesterday. World is gaining ground on USA and that&rsquo;s a good thing for the sport.</p>

<p>Last time USA sent their C team they didn&rsquo;t even medal. Last time Serbia sent their C team they won silver.</p>

<p>Parity is a good thing - or do you really just want USA to blown everyone out by 40 each game? The 1992 dream team was fun to watch from a fan perspective but it was kinda a snooze fest from a competitive end.</p>

      <label for="lhf7qen" class="commentText"><p>First off Serbia is dominating basketball since the 90s. Won vs the USA in 2002 and would have won now if there wasnt the propaganda and rigging of FIBA and the Olympics. In any other games the USA-Serbia would have been the finals, except in Paris where a mysterious &ldquo;draw&rdquo; made semi-finals repeat the same games from 2 groups. Furthermore, the shameful 2-3 situations where the refs clearly &ldquo;pushed a bit&rdquo; the mighty dream team was pathetic. Before you start raging or arguing, just look at a situation where Durant steps out of bounds in front of the refs eyes, where the Joker 4th + 2 repeated possessions are given to the US at the same time, where Lebron cried 30 minutes to the refs face without a tech, where Bogdanovic was fouled at half, but they take the ball away. All of this can and doesnt have to be called, but in all situations it was called for the USA. In a fair world it should be called 50-50 or at maybe even for the underdog. Because its THE DREAM TEAM, the whole World should want them to lose only once which would be good for sports. But Nike, NBA and all the money centers will keep pushing and pushing forever. At the end Olympics are just a dick race between China and the USA for medals at this point. With both teams full of doping. Look at the Reuters report on the USA doping in 2010s which came out&hellip;</p>

<p>Serbia played as physical as they could for 3 quarters and got away with it. The USA gives them a taste of their own medicine in the 4th and it’s a giant conspiracy.</p>

<p>Serbia tricked it off plain and simple.
Serbia ran out of gas and couldn’t make a 3 in the 4th. Wide open ones too.
Stay making shots in the 4th and they win.
They didn’t though.
No conspiracy. Just sports.</p>
