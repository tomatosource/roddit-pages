</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Really unlucky for them.</p>

<p>They have the best player in the world at his PEAK. Undisputable best Serbian as well. 6 out of their best 7 players hits the sweet spot of their peaks too.</p>

<p>Avramovic - 29 yo</p>

<p>Micic - 30 yo</p>

<p>Dobric - 29 yo</p>

<p>Bogdaniovic - 31 yo</p>

<p>Milutinov - 29 yo</p>

<p>Jokic - 29 yo</p>

<p>These are 6 players competing at the peak of their careers. Petrusev is only 24.</p>

<p>Yes their future may be bright with Topic, Jovic but I feel like this team is already their golden team.</p>

<p>Next Olympic, everyone may be back but at the twilight of their careers. Topic and Jovic might be contributing. Petrusev is the only guy at his peak. It will be interesting.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s different because teams like Germany and Spain will always have what ifs (Dirk, Gasol). Australia unfortunately had a mix of upcoming (Giddey, Daniels) and twilight stars (Mills).</p>

<p>Canada will be the favorites next Olympics with their potential best Canadian player and core at their peak. Shai (30), RJ (28), Murray (31), Nembhard (28), Dort (28), Brooks (32), Clarke (31), Edey (26)</p>

<p>France may be 2 olympics from their best form with Wemby (28), Coulibaly (28), Risacher (27), Sarr (27), Strazel (30) but they even already started NOW and continue to be dominant next olympics</p>

<p>USA basketball knows it’s not invincible which is why they made changes after ‘04 to continue competing for gold. They aren’t guaranteed to win, anyone who watched the semis should know that, but they aren’t going to be hurting for top tier NBA talent. 4 years ago they didn’t field the best possible roster and still one.</p>

      <label for="lhfo100" class="commentText"><p>Because even after those three retire, the US still produces more basketball talent than any other country? What kind of question are you even asking? It isn’t about being entitled, it’s literally just a fact. It was a huge deal this year that France had four players picked in the first round of the NBA draft, the first non US country to ever have that many. And of course the US has 10+ players picked almost every year.</p>

<p>After those guys retire, the US still has Tatum, Hailburton, White, Edwards, AD, Bam, and Booker. We have guys like Scottie Barnes, Paolo Banchero, Chet, Tyrese Maxey, Zion, Ja, Jalen Williams, Cooper Flagg, Lively, etc.</p>

<p>What makes the US better is that it is the only team where every player on its roster is a high level NBA guy. That’s what makes the US better, depth that no country is going to come close to touching any time soon.</p>

Serbian basketball isn&rsquo;t Jokic, nor Bogdanovic, nor any one of these players individually. We may never have another Jokic but we won silver without him last year.</p>

<p>If the team you lose to makes the finals&hellip; You should get into a bronze medal playoff.</p>

      <label for="lherklw" class="commentText"><p>No it&rsquo;s not, the 2028 team might be even better.</p>

<p>Jovic just had the best season of his career as the starting power forward for a playoff team and has tons of potential.</p>

<p>We also have guys like Topic and Djurisic, who were just drafted, and it will be interesting to see how Pokusevski, Vukcevic and Smailagic further develop in the next four years.</p>

<p>None of the current guys would be really old in 2028, Bogdan will be the oldest at 35 and I&rsquo;m pretty sure he&rsquo;ll still be on the team due to his sheer will and leadership, Jokic&rsquo;s game isn&rsquo;t depending on athleticism so he&rsquo;ll still be a similar player that he is today in four years as well etc.</p>

<p>Besides all that, our 2002 World Cup winning squad was also tremendously stacked.</p>

<p>We had Divac and Stojakovic as starters for a team that made the WCF, Bodiroga is one of the best Euroleague players of all-time and arguably the best player never to play in the NBA, Jaric was an All-Euroleague First Team selection that year, Rakocevic averaged 18 PPG in the Euroleague that season (both were signed by NBA teams that summer), Tomasevic was an All-Euroleague First Team selection that year as well, Drobnjak was a solid NBA backup center, Vujanic was an All-Euroleague Second Team selection and the Euroleague Top Scorer the following season, Gurovic was a great shooter etc.</p>

<p>That team was as stacked as it could be for a non-US national team.</p>

<p>Take the shooting; when US players go on a streak, we supposedly are &ldquo;witnessing greatness&rdquo;. When non-US players do the same, it&rsquo;s discussed as a statistical outlier. It&rsquo;s always the same.</p>

<p>So here we go now; 30+ year old non-US players can&rsquo;t compete but when the US team needed to do the same the world was going to be in trouble. Smh.</p>

<p>Serbia played USA in the final of the Olympics 1996 and only two years after that became world champion. Also, Serbia won against USA in Indianapolis 2002 and later became World champion on that games.</p>

<p>The name of the state was SR Yugoslavia, but this should differ from Former Yugoslavia (which included Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia, Macedonia). Bassically, SR Yugoslavia consisted of Serbia and Montenegro, but this is pretty much the same nation.</p>

<p>Therefore, Setbia is quite consisted in major tournaments, and hopeffuly this will remain the same.</p>

<p>But yeah, Serbia is just a talent factory, they will always have a great team. They&rsquo;re nothing like for example Spain who had a golden generation but struggles to consistently produce top-level players, Serbia will be just fine.</p>

      <label for="lhf3itc" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think Jokic will have any issues playing at the next Olympics, he will be just as dominant. Obviously 2032 would be a major concern, but in 2028 he should be pretty much just as good as now. They would need a primary ball-handler though, because Bogdanovic would be too old for that role full-time unless he somehow finds whatever LBJ has been drinking over the last 5 years.</p>

<p>This is lining up to potentially be an upset Olympics for Team USA’s basketball with France (their youth entering prime) and Canada (fully in prime) becoming real threats - with Serbia similarly lurking in the shadows and depending on what Jovic and Topic can become, maybe becoming a true threat themselves - to unseat the US team that doesn’t have a clear direction post-LBJ-KD-Curry.</p>

<p>Team USA is for sure going to end up paying for their lack of continuity at some point, unless they start taking the World Cup seriously and making it mandatory for players to commit to a 4-year cycle. They&rsquo;re still gonna be the most talented team for a long time (especially depth-wise), but we&rsquo;re clearly seeing that it&rsquo;s not gonna be enough to just send all their stars once every 4 years and roll through the competition like they used to be able to do. I hope it happens because as amazing as the Olympics are, the World Cup is just a way better setup for a basketball tournament, and would be even better if USA started treating it like they do the Olympics.</p>

<p>They have decent chemistry, but Jokic has played with this team about as much as the USA guys have played together, so it’s almost impossible to be as good as some of the older teams, even with Jokic.</p>

<p>Not a slight against Jokic, the world has just changed.</p>

<p>losing like this in the gold medal match like those spain teams is easier to stomach imo because silver is still a great accomplishment</p>

<p>Honestly, getting 3rd place is sometimes more fulfilling than getting 2nd: you go out of the event with the victory, not with the defeat.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a small pool, and includes <em>one</em> all star. An MVP candidate, but only one player.</p>

<p>None of the others would even make a short list for team USA, and in four years <em>maybe</em> one more?</p>

<p>The USA has hundreds of players, and there will be some breakouts that you thought were marginal this year and will be no brainers in 4 years.</p>

<p>Challenge idea:</p>

<p>How many &ldquo;Team USA&rsquo;s&rdquo; can you make that are &ldquo;better&rdquo; than Team Canada&rsquo;s line-up?</p>

<p>(my bet is at least 10)</p>

      <label for="lhf6x2i" class="commentText"><p>While Jokic and Bogdanovic are absolutely amazing, we have at least 10 players who played for us since 2000 better than the other guys you listed (aside from maybe Micic a few years ago). These guys are Euroleague starters, who we constantly produce a bunch of and should not have a problem producing more of in the future if all stays well.</p>

<p>Our teams are just very well structured and usually coached well so players have the ability to break out and play outstandingly in these international tournaments.</p>

<p>Its questionable if we will have another generation soon that can go toe-to-toe with a US team that has KD, Lebron, Curry, Embiid, Ant, Booker and all the others at the same time, but I feel confident that we will continue competing for medals against just about everyone else.</p>

      <label for="lhg2igu" class="commentText"><p>This might be a hot take, but I think we need to recalibrate our perception of what qualifies as prime ages as it applies to the Olympics.</p>

<p>Winning an NBA championship typically means playing well enough through an 82-game season to earn a high seed, then making it through 4 playoff rounds, all while routinely traveling long distances. In that environment, it makes sense that a 29-year old would be considered closer to their prime than a 34-year old. A young person is naturally going to handle the workload better and have a better chance to stay healthy.</p>

<p>But the Olympics are different. It&rsquo;s a few games and no long flights. It only makes sense that that format would tip the scales a little in favor of wisdom/experience over physical stamina.</p>

<p>Last time USA sent their C team they didn&rsquo;t even medal. Last time Serbia sent their C team they won silver.</p>

<p>Parity is a good thing - or do you really just want USA to blown everyone out by 40 each game? The 1992 dream team was fun to watch from a fan perspective but it was kinda a snooze fest from a competitive end.</p>

<p>USA should be the #1 contender for the forseeable future simply because their youth pipeline is several centuries ahead of the rest of the world while NBA is the strongest and richest league by far.</p>

<p>But USA teams always gravitate towards iso heavy, fast paced style while good EU teams have good fundementals and contrary to popular belief don&rsquo;t rely on just 1 guy.</p>

<p>Hopefully there&rsquo;s more close games in the future like the one we just saw yesterday. World is gaining ground on USA and that&rsquo;s a good thing for the sport.</p>

<p>Your comment is off topic anyways as this is a post about Serbia, who literally tried to ethnically cleanse ethnic Albanians. Stop defending shitty Serbia. Even today they don’t recognize Kosovo and are hostile towards them.</p>

      <label for="lhfp53c" class="commentText"><p>Whatever man. You can’t add a single argument to the discussion. I have told you why you have no right to make such arguments and you keep ignoring them. The majority of these countries have done some shit in the past. By your logic we should hate everybody and be unsupportive.</p>

<p>Oh and btw. Try to look at both sides regarding kosovo. Currently the former president of Kosovo and a UCK leader, Hashim Thaci, amongst others is on trial at the ITC for crimes against the Serbian population (murder, torture, displacement).  Not everything is black and white.</p>

Nobody in their right mind is supporting ethnic cleaning. You’re not here to support the governments but the athletes. Like I said considering all things that have happened until now. USA is right up there with China, Iran, Russia, etc. So get off your high horse and stop acting like your government is any better.</p>

<p>Also, you’re wrong:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There have been several recent incidents where Serbia has taken actions that have negatively affected those in Kosovo:
 &amp;gt;* Barricades and Protests: Serbia has supported the erection of barricades and protests in northern Kosovo, which have been used to obstruct freedom of movement and put pressure on the Kosovar government.
 &amp;gt;* Financial Support: Serbia has provided financial incentives to ethnic Serb officials in Kosovo who have resigned from their positions in protest of Kosovar government policies.
 &amp;gt;* Rhetoric: Serbian officials have made inflammatory statements about Kosovo’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, fueling tensions and undermining efforts at dialogue.
 &amp;gt;* Military Buildup: Serbia has increased its military presence along the border with Kosovo, raising concerns about the potential for renewed conflict.</p>

<p>These actions have been widely condemned by the international community, as they contribute to instability in the region and undermine the ongoing dialogue process between Serbia and Kosovo.</p>

<p>First off Serbia is dominating basketball since the 90s. Won vs the USA in 2002 and would have won now if there wasnt the propaganda and rigging of FIBA and the Olympics. In any other games the USA-Serbia would have been the finals, except in Paris where a mysterious &ldquo;draw&rdquo; made semi-finals repeat the same games from 2 groups. Furthermore, the shameful 2-3 situations where the refs clearly &ldquo;pushed a bit&rdquo; the mighty dream team was pathetic. Before you start raging or arguing, just look at a situation where Durant steps out of bounds in front of the refs eyes, where the Joker 4th + 2 repeated possessions are given to the US at the same time, where Lebron cried 30 minutes to the refs face without a tech, where Bogdanovic was fouled at half, but they take the ball away. All of this can and doesnt have to be called, but in all situations it was called for the USA. In a fair world it should be called 50-50 or at maybe even for the underdog. Because its THE DREAM TEAM, the whole World should want them to lose only once which would be good for sports. But Nike, NBA and all the money centers will keep pushing and pushing forever. At the end Olympics are just a dick race between China and the USA for medals at this point. With both teams full of doping. Look at the Reuters report on the USA doping in 2010s which came out&hellip;</p>

<p>Serbia played as physical as they could for 3 quarters and got away with it. The USA gives them a taste of their own medicine in the 4th and it’s a giant conspiracy.</p>

<p>Serbia tricked it off plain and simple.
Serbia ran out of gas and couldn’t make a 3 in the 4th. Wide open ones too.
Stay making shots in the 4th and they win.
They didn’t though.
No conspiracy. Just sports.</p>

I also beleive that he is not the best player in the world, but he shares basketball magic. Also, he is making his teammated 50% better than they really are.</p>

<p>Embid is not really close to Jokic. He is very good athlete thouhg.</p>
