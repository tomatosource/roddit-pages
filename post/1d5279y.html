If manager has sight, it&rsquo;s smaller than accurate to avoid the potential of being yelled at. If the customer has that scary, stern face when you scoop that chicken, you do a quick look around then sneak a small amount more to avoid potential of being yelled at. It&rsquo;s rough.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s likely happening, corporate inside baseball. I don&rsquo;t and have never worked for Chipotle but this stuff isn&rsquo;t different across large corporations</p>

<p>A financial analyst who looks at material sourcing costs knows that they currently serve 140 million lbs of chicken per year (found that on Google). At <span class="math inline">\(4/lb that's \)</span>560M in chicken expense every year. Their brand standard is 4oz of meat per serving which should mean that&rsquo;s enough chicken for 560M bowls.  But he looks and sees that they only sold 530M bowls in the past year and he puts a report together to give his manager saying hey we&rsquo;re wasting <span class="math inline">\(30M a year on overserving chicken (somehow this would be adjusted to account for waste but idk how they do that in the food industry, I'm a retail guy). Manager gets info like that from the analyst who covers each type of meat and then he puts together his own report using that info to go to the director he works for and say hey we spent \)</span>100M in total on overserving last year. That director then is deciding what he wants to brief the VP on that month and this is the biggest number he has so he tells the VP there&rsquo;s a problem with overserving that&rsquo;s costing <span class="math inline">\(100M a year. Finance VP takes this info to an operations VP and tells him to fix the issue and if they can deliver the \)</span>100M in savings next year, that&rsquo;ll be worth $250k each on their bonuses. Operations VP starts telling his direct reports to go tell their regional managers to go tell store managers to stop overserving. At no point did anyone involved in this process actually investigate what&rsquo;s going on with serving sizes, someone just looked at some data in the corporate office and said here&rsquo;s what the data says we&rsquo;re losing on this and then they kicked off a game of telephone that resulted in line level employees getting chewed out because they think it&rsquo;s good for everyone above them&rsquo;s wallets</p>

<p>Then in a year the guy who replaced the financial analyst from last year (people rotate out of jobs quickly to gain new experience in entry level corporate roles) runs the same analysis and finds that they overspent by only <span class="math inline">\(90M last year. They made an improvement but the VP wants to know why it wasn't fully fixed. He then figures his own team clearly can't figure it out and green lights a \)</span>10M McKinsey contract to come in and do the investigation of serving sizes they should have done last time and after six months McKinsey tells him it&rsquo;s all food waste, there&rsquo;s no overserving problem</p>

<p>Congrats, everyone accomplished nothing except for the consultants who got paid since they&rsquo;d rather follow processes like that than just give the original financial analyst $10k to spend a few weeks traveling to the lowest performing stores on his chicken overspending report and figure out what&rsquo;s actually causing the problem</p>

<p>Cut <em>everything</em>. Down to and then past the bone. Gut absolutely everything you have any ability to.</p>

<p>It looks great, for a very short amount of time. By then you&rsquo;re onto the next job and it&rsquo;s your replacement&rsquo;s responsibility to explain why they&rsquo;re not showing the same exponential growth that you did.</p>

I don’t think they hired consultants to figure out the problem directly but many food places have been restricting portions even on a small business scale. Chipotle workers 10 years ago were more free to put the portions they want but as things expanded and got more corporate they got more annoying.</p>

Maybe the standards of flavor have increased with better competition in that space. If anything it&rsquo;s the quality of service has gone to shit. It seems since lockdowns, they shifted heavily into focusing on online ordering. I&rsquo;ve had 2-3 instances of stopping in a location and there&rsquo;s only 1-2 people ahead of me in line and I get fed up and leave after them only servicing drop in customers once every 5+ minutes.

Every location seems to be the same, overseasoned veggies, poorly cooked rice, meat seasoning and quality varies too much, etc. I don’t understand how it’s happened, but my girlfriend and I have talked about it multiple times and both have concluded it’s not nearly what it used to be and it breaks my heart because I hate Freebirds and there’s no Qdoba near me anymore. Bullritos is good, but Chipotle was king for me and I’d always defend it to the haters previously.</p>

<p>Quality has definitely gone down since the OG days of Chipotle in the mid to late 00s. There is no denying that.</p>

<p>I’m not saying you need to be captain chipotle and go above and beyond for every single customer and make them feel like they’re being treated like royalty, because that’s absurd.</p>

<p>But standard customer service practices aren’t being followed at all anymore and tbh, that’s unacceptable.</p>

      <label for="l6jlsne" class="commentText"><p>Taste has gotten worse. I used to work there. The changes were to combat food poisoning. Meat used to be locally sourced by non factory farms, so fewer chemicals were used on them. Meat tasted better, but you had to trust the supplier more to not skimp on keeping their animals from infection. The trust is gone, and so corporate changed who you can get meat from.</p>

<p>Steak used to be made medium/medium rare on grill and then put on the line where it cooks some more.</p>

<p>Beef meat is now cooked well done before being put on the line. The meat is diced smaller to cook faster and keep portions smaller. While on the line, it further cooks. Chicken is cooked to a higher temperature now. This is to avoid Saminella, but it dries out the meat and makes most of the flavor cook away.</p>

<p>I no longer work there, but the portions look the same (one spoon, not overflowing scoop. cheese is a 3 finger pinch.)  but I think management is just being stricter on enforcing it to drive down cost.</p>

<p>A quick google claims they serve about 750,000 customers a day. Serving every customer 20 cents more food is over $50 million a year in extra cost.</p>

<p>Of course this is how we end up with r/shrinkflation Some “genius” in a board room is like, “We can save <span class="math inline">\(10 million a year by making the chicken chunks 6% smaller. Customers won’t even notice.” or “ We can save \)</span>15 million a year by changing tortilla suppliers. The quality difference is hardly noticeable.” The problem is, when you do something like that every month for years, you end up with a severely degraded product over time and people slowly start to notice.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is this biggest issue we&rsquo;re facing in the current marketplace.  The goal isn&rsquo;t just profit.  The goal is <em>greater profits than last quarter.</em>  And the goal next quarter is greater profits than this quarter.  They prioritize short-term profit over the long-term success/viability of the company.</p>

<p>So, the guys in the boardroom either have to find ways to sell more product or to cut back costs.  First, they eliminate the &ldquo;conveniences.&rdquo; No ketchup in the bag unless you specifically ask for ketchup, and then you get <strong>two.</strong>  You want more? Costs extra.  Then, they reduce quantity and quality.  Smaller portions of lower quality ingredients.  Finally, they start cutting labor.  Cashiers are gone, replaced with self-service kiosks, and instead of having seven people in the back making food per shift they drop to six&hellip; then five.  Then they get rid of the cleaning crew and ask the workers to clean while it&rsquo;s &ldquo;quiet.&rdquo;  Then they cut down to four.</p>

<p>They make the customer experience worse, and worse, and worse, a little at a time while the squeeze everything they can out of their brand name before there&rsquo;s nothing left to give and they go under.</p>

<p>After making sure to be polite as hell but consistently bitchy looking they eventually got to recognize me,  and even the manager started making me big bowls if it wasn&rsquo;t slammed lol.</p>

There was about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cup total of rice and beans in the whole burrito. It was so small it was almost comical. I kind of understand skimping on meat if you&rsquo;re trying to keep costs down but rice and beans have to be about the cheapest food a restaurant can sell. They can fuck right off.</p>

<p>I already don’t like going there because I ate them for free for three years, but other people still like them. I won’t get their food without going in-person now and coincidentally, without asking for more, I get accurate portion sizes when I’m standing there.</p>

<p>However, after the incident of people getting sick up in the NW, everything started to change. Stopped doing events, we finally had slow days, and we had to relax our standards a bit for hiring because good people were leaving and most of the interviewees we were getting kinda sucked. So I wouldn’t put it past the company that they still have incorrect (both less and more) portioning going on.</p>

      <label for="l6ilrf0" class="commentText"><p>This is correct. I was a former GM of Chipotle from 2017-2021. I remember being astounded when I first started my training and was taught the standard, by the book portion. It clicked then, that the times I thought I was skimped when ordering online, (vs in store portions) were times I was getting correct portions. I was even more shocked to find out that Chipotle reheats cooked food from the night before ie their proteins/beans/queso (minus steak, although some stores reheat steak due to pressure from higher ups about CI - critical inventory) Reheated proteins specifically taste way different than new, freshly cooked protein. I would never advise anyone to eat at Chipotle when they open, because you’re likely not receiving fresh food. There’s a clear, distinct difference in taste and flavor.</p>

<p>Four ounces of rice doesn’t even really cover the bottom of the bowl. Or the ‘three finger pinch’ of cheese. A properly portioned Chipotle bowl is a joke and I always understood any guest who was confused, upset, disappointed, or frustrated etc.</p>

We had a manager who was a corporate suck-up and strictly enforced portions.  That means customers would complain the ice cream cone wasn&rsquo;t the proper size (compared to other stores) because other stores weren&rsquo;t portioning properly and giving fatass cones. Similar story to those who stuff the fry box and those who don&rsquo;t. In the end, the customer feels ripped off and the employees can&rsquo;t do much to change it without getting in trouble.</p>

      <label for="l6ir4kh" class="commentText"><p>Oh yes. False advertising.</p>

<p>It always used to piss me off when I would receive emails from Chipotle corporate, responding to customer comments (feedback that was sent) regarding portions, and Chipotle never ever had our back in any shape or form, in their response to the customer. They wanted us to enforce portions, but when we did, they never dealt with the feedback accordingly. Got penalized by them (these emails were sent to my boss, his boss, etc. So several eyes seeing the complaints) by following the rules they, themselves, set in place. And by all means, the complaints of course, were justified. It was a terrible position to be in, because no matter what you did - you were damned if you did, and damned if you didn’t. Do not miss it at all, and somehow it’s just gotten worse (which I didn’t think was possible)</p>

<p>Truly no wonder why customers are so confused and frustrated about portion sizes. Chipotle has really never been honest about their standard portion sizes, and now it’s seemingly coming back to bite them in the ass. Rightfully so.</p>

      <label for="l6itb8t" class="commentText"><p>There are so many problems with food safety at Chipotle. It was commonplace to see proper food safety procedures not being followed at various restaurants, as it was easy to get away with it. A lot of this was due to staffing issues, lack of adequate training, and just the insane amount of food preparation that Chipotle requires (which is a huge problem when they don’t allot proper labor for it, especially if you’re doing all the recipes and procedures by the book)</p>

<p>If you’re in an understaffed Chipotle, you’re fucked and are most definitely cutting food safety corners.</p>

<p>It’s honestly not worth the gamble eating there. You’re not going to get great portions. The food quality is likely to be terrible. You’re not going to receive the best service as the employees are not happy to be there. You’re likely to be in a dirty restaurant with overflowing trash bins, not a clean table in sight, etc. Not to mention the likelihood of getting sick due to employees cutting corners just to get food on the line.</p>

<p>Support your local Mexican restaurants.</p>

      <label for="l6j7y2m" class="commentText"><p>Your comment about the 4 oz of rice not covering the bottom of the bowl got me thinking about it. If they just started using smaller bowls and wraps they could better enforce the food portions standards cuz a bowl and wrap could only hold so much food. Plus the illusion of a full bowl is way easier to sell to the public than noticeably smaller portions in the same size bowl theve been ising forever. But this also begs the question of why would corporate pick such large bowls if the portions didn&rsquo;t fill them to begin with.</p>

I thought they were starting to skimp on fries, too, but I went to one that wasn&rsquo;t my regular location a few months back and ordered a large to share, and immediately had some regrets after getting what almost seemed like an entire bag full. Went to that one again recently and had a similar experience. So it probably boils down to management.</p>

One of the things that Five Guys <em>specifically</em> asks shoppers to verify is that they are getting an extra scoop of fries.  The stores actually get points off if they just fill the cup.  There&rsquo;s a disconnect somewhere between the marketing dept, the stores, and QC.</p>

I have a manager breathing down my neck, ensuring that I give an exact level scoop of our shitty cheap tuna, exactly the right number of peaks of sauce, ect. They&rsquo;ve gotten more stingy the several years I&rsquo;ve been here while also raising prices and getting cheaper ingredients. The portions haven&rsquo;t technically changed, though.</p>

<p>Hell, when I started there, I would slice meat from the range of 66-72g of meat per portion. Now they want 66-69g, and will get onto you for going anywhere above that tiny range of weight. Even the ranch cups, which we have since replaced with a cheaper ranch, we would fill a small cup and call it a day. Now we have to measure each individual ranch cup to 40-45g. All this while worker hours have been steadily reducing us to skeleton crews.</p>

What they should have done was started with proper sized bowls and wraps years ago so it looks like they&rsquo;re stuffed to the brim but really only hold the proper portion amounts.</p>

      <label for="l6jbbzz" class="commentText"><p>Manually weighing multiple individual parts of a single entree, done correctly, would probably add a decent amount of time required for each order by the employees. The amount they&rsquo;d save in less material used would probably be less (or much less) than what they&rsquo;d need to pay employees for the extra time. Both employees and customers would probably rather get things done quickly and easily (and the customer can complain if they&rsquo;re unhappy, which they might do with or without a scale).</p>

<p>During certain hours, a Chipotle near me commonly has a line of ~20 people waiting, and when that happens, I usually prefer to go somewhere else than wait 10 minutes. Order prep time is an important factor.</p>

<p>I used to own a restaurant. I would have someone twice a week spend an entire afternoon slicing and portioning out our meat and cheeses in containers with deli paper tween them. </p>

<p>.9 - .11 on the scale. Finding the sweet spot for thickness that hit the mark in exactly three slices is an art of its own.</p>

<p>Very time intensive. That and whipping cream cheese haunts my dreams. </p>

The one closer to me just sucks ass, service is ass, the ingredients are always out too long and I end up with a burrito that looks pathetic.

I&rsquo;m not talking about like the brown top layer, that&rsquo;s normal and can be Incorporated with a good stir, this shit was fully brown ALL THE WAY THROUGH. Not a hint of green anywhere. I don&rsquo;t even know how that&rsquo;s possible unless you&rsquo;re just using old shitty avocados that are already brown ALL the way through. They also started using shitty tortillas that were noticeably not as good. It was probably just a bad franchise owner trying to be cheap, but when Chipotle&rsquo;s consistency is one of their selling points a few bad experiences is enough for me to lose interest.</p>

When I worked at Subway I had a similar manager who watched us count out the official corporate recipe portions. It ultimately just drives away customers because nobody wants to pay exorbitant prices for less food, and paying extra for more meat, cheese, etc is laughable when one item already costs <span class="math inline">\(15 to \)</span>20. </p>

      <label for="l6jkxpt" class="commentText"><p>The inevitable outcome is the Subway-style pre-portioned proteins. Weigh them, put your 4 oz of chicken in a cafeteria-style paper boat, dump that onto the burrito. That&rsquo;s cheaper than employees putting 5 oz in each burrito.</p>

<p>But the biggest problem is fallout like this: people get used to 6 oz portions, even though official portion is 4 oz, and then they get mad when official portions start being enforced.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re forgetting that the 20+ oz burrito that they <em>still made plenty of profit on</em> is why people have been so loyal for the last two decades. College kids love the place because you get a ton of food for cheap. Squeezing an extra 10 cents profit off the burrito will damage your reputation more than it helps your margin. It took me exactly two tiny burritos before I stopped going at all. That&rsquo;s why this tiktok is spreading like wildfire - because people have experienced something similar and agree with it.</p>

<p>Watch, there&rsquo;s a price increase coming too. (and I&rsquo;d bet they blame it on &ldquo;increased labor costs&rdquo;, cuz that seems like these yayhoos&rsquo; MOs).</p>

Oh, you can really <em>taste</em> what is in theory their spicy chicken but the actual chicken is barely there leaving the only conclusion (IMO) that they pumped up on seasoning and reduced content.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s palate clickbait.</p>

One day I was making a burrito for someone and my boss told me I’m putting too much of everything in the burrito.  So she takes the burrito I just made and threw it in the trash and made me make another one while she supervised me.  It was 20 years ago and it still makes me mad 😅</p>

<p>In all seriousness though, It’s a mix.</p>

<p>Nearly every company on Earth has been doing Shrinkflation for DECADES. Slowly but surely, Gatorade bottles get slightly more slender in the name of a “better grip” or “more athletic look”, etc.</p>

<p>But it’s also just the staff and the hell they live through as well. Shit gets thrown together as fast as possible these days—a generous scoop is now an under filled one. “Double meat” feels like what default Chipotle used to be.</p>

<p>It’s like $24 for my wife and I to get Chipotle, and that’s JUST two bowls with nothing fancy added. Single meat portion, no guacamole, no queso—just your standard bowl. No drinks or sides.</p>

<p>I can go down the street and find any random local Mexican place, and spend around $30 and get MORE food at a much higher quality, and even get chips and salsa to-go for free.</p>

<p>Fast food and quick “build your food” type places like Chipotle are just dead to me these days. I’ll happily drop <span class="math inline">\(10 or \)</span>20 more, and reduce my visits in exchange for just flat out better food.</p>

<p>Quality is at an all time low, and cost is at an all time high—made by a service team whose morale has just become pure indifference, and I can’t blame them.</p>

<p>Everything is free to get extra except meat and guac I believe. The employees there usually understand the assignment and you’ll get a 5 lb bowl.</p>

<p>Use that 5 lb bowl and tortillas from the grocery store or tortilla chips to make a weeks worth of nachos or tacos/burritos.</p>

<p>This is how I do Chipotle. Definitely get my moneys worth lol.</p>
