      <label for="l9sajqo" class="commentText"><p>Most talented 1v1 dribbler I’ve ever seen at his peak. Yes he would grift for fouls but he had this ability to get defenders off balance with solely his dribble that boggled the mind. Such an effortless offensive weapon. He did every possible on-ball duty at an elite level.</p>

<p>I eventually grew to enjoy watching him play.</p>

      <label for="l9st8v9" class="commentText"><p>One interesting fact that does bring the Harden/Luka comparisons into focus:</p>

<p>Luka and Harden both went to the same sports science company and were tested across a wide range of athleticism metrics.</p>

<p>Ranked against an NBA player database, as a teenager Luka ranked in the 93rd percentile in deceleration.</p>

<p>Harden? 99th percentile.</p>

<p>Harden’s stop and start ability while dribbling is about as exceptional as a human can display on a basketball court. I always found this so fascinating because it clarifies why Harden was completely unstoppable getting to the rim, stepping back for jumpers, drawing fouls, etc. He quite literally moves like no one else NBA level defenders had ever guarded.</p>

<p>This is the roster that people expected to beat GS that year btw. He took this roster to 53 wins. The narrative that Morey put consistent great rosters around 13 needs to end. Without him this year, this team would be fighting for a top 5 pick</p>

<p>You are combining two different years for whatever reason.</p>

<p>Please go look into 17-18 CP3, 18-19 CP3, and 19-20 CP3. I can tell you he was a fantastic player in 17-18 and 19-20, but he fell off a cliff in 18-19 and he wasn&rsquo;t carrying any team anywhere. He had some full on career lows as well as a bunch of other stats that were bottom 3-4 year at that point in his career.</p>

<p>It was a 4 v 5 seed and Russ didn&rsquo;t play for most of the series while OKC was fully healthy.  OKC wasn&rsquo;t some huge underdog.</p>

      <label for="l9susiy" class="commentText"><p>Here&rsquo;s some stats/context to back up what you are saying about his fall off from 2018 to 2019.</p>

<p>CP3 went from 96th percentile as an iso scorer to 30th percentile which killed the whole offensive scheme. Elite iso play was the only way we were able to stay competitive with the Warriors. We were never going to beat them at their own game.</p>

<p>CP3 went from 1.17 points per iso possession in &lsquo;18 to 0.86 in &lsquo;19. His turnover frequency% went from 2.7% to 12%. Most staggering, his iso efg% went from 59% to 46% (48FG% to 39FG%).</p>

<p>The best comparison imo is to imagine how it would have effected the Warriors if Klay suddenly couldn&rsquo;t shoot 3s. That&rsquo;s the extent to which CP3s fall off killed the Rockets offense.</p>

<p>Capela and Gordon missed a fuckload of games too, all kinda at the same time.</p>

<p>That Thunder shit is one of the most exaggerated storylines. They were predicted to blow it up and tank &lsquo; that&rsquo;s why their preseason odds were so bad. They took Houston to 7 because OKC was fully healthy and Houston wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

Nobody could have predicted that a diet change would rejuvenate him <em>that</em> much.</p>

<p>The only reason we traded him in the first place was because he looked completely washed that year after the hammy injury in 2018 (and we have seen with multiple players how bad hammy injuries can fuck guys up for LONG periods).</p>

      <label for="l9sd79s" class="commentText"><p>ok but then what? like the whole knock against him is that harden never won a ring. but he wasnt winning a ring that year with that team. so he gets to the second round and then they lose there and then he gets shit on for that too lol</p>

<p>those teams he had before 2018 were never close to championship contenders compared to the teams he had to go against. 2018 and 2021 were his only real chances at a ring because those were the only times the teams he had were good enough, but hamstrings and ankle injuries had other plans.  most teams dont get as many chances at it like franchises like the warriors, celtics, etc have had and when harden had his real chances they got injury fucked.</p>
