      <label for="l9sajqo" class="commentText"><p>Most talented 1v1 dribbler I’ve ever seen at his peak. Yes he would grift for fouls but he had this ability to get defenders off balance with solely his dribble that boggled the mind. Such an effortless offensive weapon. He did every possible on-ball duty at an elite level.</p>

<p>I eventually grew to enjoy watching him play.</p>

<p>It was either a stepback three which he was hitting at like 38%, a blow by to a floater or a blow by to a lob for Capela</p>

<p>I always loved watching him even with the foul baiting, he was just such an unreal offensive player and I never truly understood all of the hate he got</p>

      <label for="l9st8v9" class="commentText"><p>One interesting fact that does bring the Harden/Luka comparisons into focus:</p>

<p>Luka and Harden both went to the same sports science company and were tested across a wide range of athleticism metrics.</p>

<p>Ranked against an NBA player database, as a teenager Luka ranked in the 93rd percentile in deceleration.</p>

<p>Harden? 99th percentile.</p>

<p>Harden’s stop and start ability while dribbling is about as exceptional as a human can display on a basketball court. I always found this so fascinating because it clarifies why Harden was completely unstoppable getting to the rim, stepping back for jumpers, drawing fouls, etc. He quite literally moves like no one else NBA level defenders had ever guarded.</p>

<p>This is the roster that people expected to beat GS that year btw. He took this roster to 53 wins. The narrative that Morey put consistent great rosters around 13 needs to end. Without him this year, this team would be fighting for a top 5 pick</p>

<p>You are combining two different years for whatever reason.</p>

<p>Please go look into 17-18 CP3, 18-19 CP3, and 19-20 CP3. I can tell you he was a fantastic player in 17-18 and 19-20, but he fell off a cliff in 18-19 and he wasn&rsquo;t carrying any team anywhere. He had some full on career lows as well as a bunch of other stats that were bottom 3-4 year at that point in his career.</p>

<p>It was a 4 v 5 seed and Russ didn&rsquo;t play for most of the series while OKC was fully healthy.  OKC wasn&rsquo;t some huge underdog.</p>

      <label for="l9susiy" class="commentText"><p>Here&rsquo;s some stats/context to back up what you are saying about his fall off from 2018 to 2019.</p>

<p>CP3 went from 96th percentile as an iso scorer to 30th percentile which killed the whole offensive scheme. Elite iso play was the only way we were able to stay competitive with the Warriors. We were never going to beat them at their own game.</p>

<p>CP3 went from 1.17 points per iso possession in &lsquo;18 to 0.86 in &lsquo;19. His turnover frequency% went from 2.7% to 12%. Most staggering, his iso efg% went from 59% to 46% (48FG% to 39FG%).</p>

<p>The best comparison imo is to imagine how it would have effected the Warriors if Klay suddenly couldn&rsquo;t shoot 3s. That&rsquo;s the extent to which CP3s fall off killed the Rockets offense.</p>

<p>Everyone in hindsight acts like the Westbrook trade wasn’t a necessary gamble — it was a chance at disaster vs guaranteed disaster if we kept CP3. If CP3 didn’t look completely washed we would have kept him and fixed our defensive identity which also fell off a cliff that season thanks to Melo/Bzdelik hating each other and losing key 3&amp;D glue guys like Luc and Ariza.</p>

<p>That Thunder shit is one of the most exaggerated storylines. They were predicted to blow it up and tank &lsquo; that&rsquo;s why their preseason odds were so bad. They took Houston to 7 because OKC was fully healthy and Houston wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

      <label for="l9ski06" class="commentText"><p>2019 CP3 was a corpse. You&rsquo;ve already forgotten what a huge surprise his bounce back was at the time and what a big deal everyone made out of CP3 going vegan and his health improving significantly. Nobody could have predicted that a diet change would rejuvenate him <em>that</em> much.</p>

<p>The only reason we traded him in the first place was because he looked completely washed that year after the hammy injury in 2018 (and we have seen with multiple players how bad hammy injuries can fuck guys up for LONG periods).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very comparable. He took less shots overall of course so his points dipped but was efficient as ever. He was the best player in the Nuggets and Clips series to get to his first Finals and the best player in the Pels series when Booker missed 3 games to injury and was largely ineffective when he returned in G6.</p>

<p>The narrative that Morey put consistent great rosters around 13 needs to end.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nah that&rsquo;s cap bro.</p>

<p>12-13 we grab Harden from OKC days before training camp so Morey has hardly anytime to put a proper roster around him</p>

<p>13-14 roster was good with Dwight, Parsons, PBev, Asik, Lin, TJones, Francisco, Casspi, etc. Harden choked first 2 games vs Blazers while Dwight and LMA dropped 40 2x each. If Harden had played up to his regular season standards we win that in 5 easy and Dame never even gets a chance at his series winner.</p>

<p>14-15 we all know about the roster that demolished the Clippers in G6 while Harden wilted and sat on the bench. Ariza, JSmoove, JET, Brewer, even Prigs were huge for us, and DMo kept us afloat along with Harden during the reg season.</p>

<p>15-16 Morey tried to go all-in with Ty Lawson who many of us thouht was the missing piece to push us over the top. It didn&rsquo;t work out + the relationships between Harden, Dwight, and McHale all fell apart, but that&rsquo;s not due to inaction on Morey&rsquo;s part.</p>

<p>16-17 Weak roster on paper yes, but tailored perfectly to fit Heliocentric Harden and MDA&rsquo;s style and set the foundation for CP3 wanting to come here for 17-18.</p>

<p>17-18 No explanation needed</p>

<p>18-19 Carmelo signing failed but again, you can&rsquo;t fault Morey for trying. No Ariza re-signing and fucking around with Danuel House in the D-League was due to Tilman&rsquo;s cheapness not wanting to go into lux tax. That + CP3&rsquo;s decline not fully recovered from hamstring injury was the reason the season failed, again not because of inaction on Morey&rsquo;s part.</p>

<p>19-20 Harden wanted Westbrick over CP3. Morey was against it but Harden went over his head to Tilman and the 2 of them forced Morey to make the trade.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s crazy revisionist for Houston fans to say Morey failed Harden in Houston. Since he came to Houston in 07-08 all he did was find diamonds in the rough in the draft, trades, and free agency to put around Yao/TMac (who unfortunately couldn&rsquo;t stay healthy), kept us around .500 when Les Alexander would not let us tank and full rebuild, hooked a superstar in Harden without having top draft picks (again, due to Les not letting us tank), got a 2nd star in Dwight who Harden ultimately couldn&rsquo;t coexist with, then had us in the Semi-Finals/Conf Finals for most of the latter &lsquo;10s until finally he couldn&rsquo;t work around Tilman&rsquo;s cheapness anymore and Harden&rsquo;s impatience at wanting to dump CP3 for Westbrick.</p>

      <label for="l9uu7fp" class="commentText"><p>Where do you want me to start, man? Asik was a horrible offensive player that he signed to a poison-pill deal and was out of the league shortly after. Both TJones and DMo made little to no impact in the league and were gone soon after. Like you want me to name players who would have been better than Omri Casspri?</p>

<p>Signing Ryan Anderson to $20M a year and then trading DeAnthony Melton to get rid of his contract a few years later. Essentially the entire offseason after 2019 was a complete disaster. He chose to keep Chris Clemons over Isaiah Hartenstein.</p>

<p>There is a laundry list of things they could have done better — not rely on a pair of 38 year-olds as your PG rotation in 2015 — just off the top of my head. Acting like those are the rosters of title contenders is pretty wild.</p>

<p>Edit: re-reading your comment, I think the disconnect is you’re contending Morey tried even in instances he failed, and that’s not what’s being argued.</p>

<p>Like, I agree he had to work around tax constraints, but there was still a failure to put a great team around Harden, even if those contributed to various degrees.</p>

DeAnthony Melton is a needle mover? Come on now. Hartenstein would be nice to have now in 2024 after he finally blew up but would have done nothing for us in 2020-23 lol, who even knows if Stone is willing to keep him that long after Morey leaves.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>PatBev was injured before the playoffs started and missed them all, again not Morey&rsquo;s fault. He&rsquo;s not shutting down 2015 MVP Steph anyway even if he is healthy.</p>

      <label for="l9sd79s" class="commentText"><p>ok but then what? like the whole knock against him is that harden never won a ring. but he wasnt winning a ring that year with that team. so he gets to the second round and then they lose there and then he gets shit on for that too lol</p>

<p>those teams he had before 2018 were never close to championship contenders compared to the teams he had to go against. 2018 and 2021 were his only real chances at a ring because those were the only times the teams he had were good enough, but hamstrings and ankle injuries had other plans.  most teams dont get as many chances at it like franchises like the warriors, celtics, etc have had and when harden had his real chances they got injury fucked.</p>

<p>For example Dirk winning that single ring changed his entire reputation forever.</p>

<p>Has Harden had bad performances? Of course</p>

<p>Is he overall a bad playoff performer? No.</p>

<p>Even now he&rsquo;s actually outperformed his teammates and despite being signed/traded for as a second and third option over the past two years. He&rsquo;s been the number one option for over half his teams wins whilst being schemed against heavily.</p>

      <label for="l9u3yy7" class="commentText"><p>Spurs won 61 games only 6 less than KD Warriors.</p>

<p>Kawhi played <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> games and absolutely would have played G7 if it came down to it, as he was ready for G1 vs GSW which was the same day as a potential G7 vs Rockets. And famously in that G1 he was leading the Spurs to a blowout win until Zaza Pachulia stepped under him and knocked him out the rest of the series.</p>

<p>Spurs had prime LMA a perennial All-Star and All-NBA even after Kawhi went down. Harden&rsquo;s next best teammate was Eric Gordon, Trevor Ariza, or Ryan Anderson lol. Spurs also had elite 3&amp;D wing in Danny Green and 3 aging HoFers in Pau/Parker/Ginobili as elite veteran role players who were still each giving the Spurs 20-25 productive minutes a night.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s keep it 100. Rockets had no business being the 3rd seed in that Western Conference, never mind taking that Spurs team to 6 if not for Harden.</p>

<p>Keep in mind some people still talk down those 60+ win Jazz teams. Not saying you do but it’s still a thing since you wanna go by names and team record.</p>

<p>Jonathan Simmons, Patty Mills, Tony Parker and Danny all averaged either the same or LESS than Trevor Ariza, Clint Capela, Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson, and Patrick Beverly. Yall really think we can’t just look this up?</p>

<p>Maybe if Harden didn’t average 5 TOs a game…</p>

      <label for="l9uknl6" class="commentText"><p>I told you they were role players at that stage in their careers, and damn good ones at that. Title contending teams almost always need old ring-chasing stars to come in on cheap contracts and support the main stars in their prime, Spurs just managed to keep their stars in house and let them age gracefully. So you&rsquo;re just going to continue pretending like Spurs didn&rsquo;t have a 2nd All-Star/All-NBA player in LMA that Rockets didn&rsquo;t have?? He was 19/9/1 for the series and <sup>34</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> in the game Kawhi missed, no one on the Rockets after Harden even comes close. What a dishonest PoS.</p>

<p>And yes anyone who thinks the Jazz wouldn&rsquo;t have 2 trophies if not for the greatest player and team of all time is delusional. 60+ win teams almost always make at least the Conf Finals.</p>

<p>Goes to show just how hated Durant and GSW were after he went there that 29 other fanbases wish Harden got a ring in 2018 lmao.</p>

<p>That month he averaged almost 44 this season was wild though.</p>

<p>Why is that?  Steve Kerr for example took him out pretty easily for years.</p>

<p>How much is it because of him melting down at high pressure moments vs maybe to give him a top tier coach to guide him how to act in those situations where the whole defense is structured to take you out?</p>
