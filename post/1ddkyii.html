<p>89 and 98 points, with luka (while injured) being the only one showing up offensively</p>

<p>107 and 108 is something that, with Kyrie going back to his old self, besides the rest of the roleplayers, is not gamebreaking</p>

<p>i wasnt disregarding your message, just showing up what your hypothetical +18 points for the celtics look like with the hypothetical mavs we&rsquo;ve seen in previous rounds. if you wanna imagine the celtics scorint +18, its only fair to view the team that beat &ldquo;the best&rdquo; of the west playing at the same level they did in previous rounds</p>

<ul>
<li>edit: and the point is even more the offense when you imagine the celtics scoring the 3s they missed lol</li>

      <label for="l865xjf" class="commentText"><p>This isn&rsquo;t quite right. The shot quality of Dallas&rsquo; misses versus Boston&rsquo;s, both in terms of who was taking them and how open they were, means that Boston has a lot more progression to reach the mean than Dallas does presuming they continue to generate shots of roughly similar quality. I don&rsquo;t think that will be the case if Porzingas is out but Dallas caught more of a break than Boston in terms of shot variance.</p>

      <label for="l86fv11" class="commentText"><p>We shall see, I do think the open looks is way overblown though. Sure they missed a ton but not as many were wide open shots either. Point is if Dallas could score worth a shit outside Luka this series is 1-1 as defense has been fine outside a few stretches of each game. The offense is just horrendous thanks to Kyrie no showing and role guys not making the open shots. Make the open shots and the defense has to think more.</p>

<p>Once the team starts doing their jobs on offense, Luka will play harder on defense. The same way we&rsquo;ve seen him step up all playoffs on D. It&rsquo;s just insanely hard to do when you are literally the only one showing up on offense.</p>

<p>If the role players or even Kyrie start shooting well, Luka will have more to give on the other end. That&rsquo;s not to say were going to get DPOY defense from him, but it&rsquo;ll be miles better than him poking at the ball while the Celtics drive past him.</p>

<p>Case in point, theres a few DJJ above the break 3s from last game where Derrick White literally does not rush to contest and instead keeps tabs on his own guy</p>

<p>The Mavs defense is bad in part because they have to collapse when someone blows past Luka, which creates good open looks when guys over help</p>

<p>The Mavs give up open shots to everyone in any location because of their bad defense. The Cs very specifically give up open 3s above the break to bad above the break shooters</p>

      <label for="l869f0n" class="commentText"><p>But you also said &ldquo;generally tend to hit&rdquo; which means you are referring to the regular season numbers, because the Celtics playoff numbers are down as a whole (talking specifically about the guys I looked at Brown, Tatum, Horford. Some of the team is actually shooting better. And by as a whole I meant in the entire playoffs thus far, not just the finals)</p>

<p>Looking at regular season numbers DJJ and PJ are not statistically worse above the break. In fact PJ was far worse from the corner in the regular season than he was above the break.</p>

<p>You also said &ldquo;shots the Celtics generally hit&rdquo;, but these numbers would imply that the Mavs also <em>generally</em> hit those above the break 3s at a much higher percentage. So in truth it is a case of the Mavs just missing. And you can say that they have been missing them in the playoffs so far, which is true, but the Celtics have been as well.</p>

<p>So with that being said, how is what the Celtics&rsquo; are doing considered good defense where the Mavs doing the same exact thing isn&rsquo;t good defense?</p>

<p>Boston scored 105 and 107 (117 and 113 ORTG). They had a 123 ORTG and scored 120 points per game in regular season; 118 ORTG in playoffs 111 points per game.</p>

<p>As Luka said, problem is that they cannot score right now.</p>

<p>Sure, if Luka defended better, they could potentially be closer, but nothing Luka said was wrong.</p>

<p>If the Celtics matched their regular season efficiency on open (nearest defender 4-6 feet) and wide open (nearest defender 6+ feet), they would&rsquo;ve been <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>18</sub> and <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> instead of <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>18</sub> and <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>, respectively.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s 12 more points.</p>

<p>The Celtics would&rsquo;ve won 117-98 without the Mavericks playing any worse and everybody would be calling it a very strong win.</p>

      <label for="l85vvqb" class="commentText"><p>The Celtics shot 23% from 3 on open looks last game. They had a LOT of open looks, and partly because whoever Luka was guarding was using Luka as a cone and kicking it back out to open guys when everyone else had to collapse. If Celtics were hitting around their average of <sup>40</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub>% on open 3&rsquo;s, the Celtics probably win by 15. If the Mavs could score in Game 1, the Celtics don&rsquo;t need to pull their starters with 5 minutes and continue running their offense.</p>

<p>The Mav&rsquo;s haven&rsquo;t been playing good defense. That can of course change, but up to now the defense has been bad.</p>

      <label for="l85ose0" class="commentText"><p>I mean everyone has struggled vs this Celtics team, they&rsquo;re really exceptional this season, and their depth seems incredibly reliant.</p>

<p>Its gotta be maximum effort every play from Dallas, cause this Celtics team closes games consistently which is the hardest thing to do in the NBA imo.</p>

What Celtics have been scoring in the first two games is basically what Minny was scoring in WCF, and guess what - they weren&rsquo;t cOoKeD</p>

      <label for="l867975" class="commentText"><p>The Mavs went from a middling season to dominating for the entire second half of the season, and comfortably beating the top few western seeds in a stacked western conference in three playoff rounds. And they took and made the most 3s of any team in the NBA.</p>

<p>The idea that they did this entire record with 25% or less on open 3s shooters is so absolutely unhinged. They can shoot 3s other than corner 3s and have been shooting them well all season. The celtics are not the first team to drive them off the corners, timberwolves did that as well, that didn’t save them from a decent mavs 3 showing.</p>

<p>Celtics shot shit but so did the mavs, and they shot even worse than the celtics.</p>

<p>This idea that the Celtics are masterminds because mavs can only shoot corner 3s is only spread by Celtics fans who haven’t watched a single mavs or indeed western conference game all season long.</p>

<p>They didn&rsquo;t do it shooting nearly 0 open threes from the corners. If the Mavs can&rsquo;t generate open threes from the corners, they&rsquo;re screwed. And the Celtics&rsquo; defensive strategy is to allow above the break 3s in favor of preventing corner looks.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous to claim that NBA level shooters shooting 11% from 3 is due to a defensive scheme. It&rsquo;s fine to say that them getting run of the corner was deliberate but they still just bricked way more completely open shots than players of this calibre should be.</p>

<p>They literally do!! The Celtics defense is not rotating to certain shooters above the break on purpose. Go watch some of the misses and you will that they are wide open on purpose, no one is even attempting to close out on a lot of them.</p>

<p>Because they had to double team Luka. The Mavs created those open shots, not the Celtics. They ideally don&rsquo;t want them shooting open shots, but they were forced to double Luka because he was scoring a lot in isolation.</p>

<p>They prefer wing 3&rsquo;s over corner 3&rsquo;s, but they still obviously don&rsquo;t want open looks.</p>

Their 3-point shooters aren&rsquo;t actually really that good outside of that one shot. Go look back at the defense the Celtics are playing, you see the Celtics player always just sag off or help off the Mavs shooter leaving them wide open when they take an above-the-break 3</p>

      <label for="l863eti" class="commentText"><p>Obviously their shooting percentages are an outlier and I expect it to improve because no shit 11% OUTSIDE of Luka (btw, its outside of Luka, not the whole team) that isn’t something that’s normal. But at the same time, how much more will that increase even matter when they’re taking lower efficiency shots AND the Celtics are also missing good looks. Mavs are like a 32% shooting team in general, so even if you assume both teams regress to the mean, the math game still favors the Celtics. So it doesn’t matter, if Mavs can’t take advantage of this type of game from us where Tatum also went 6-22, then I’m not sure how else they’re supposed to win.</p>

<p>What actually happened is the Celtics posted a very beatable ortg, while the Mavs have posted 2 pathetic ones. Credit to Boston&rsquo;s defense.

      <label for="l85keb7" class="commentText"><p>This is a great observation. The Mavs&rsquo; defense hasn&rsquo;t been great as Boston got a ton of great shot opportunities in Game 2 that were just missed. Good case of needing to watch the game to understand which team dominated the flow of the game beyond just reading the stat sheet.</p>

<p>And, just as I have seen a bunch of people say &ldquo;If the Mavs make their FTs they win game 2&rdquo;, that what-if logic has to cut both ways: If the C&rsquo;s made their open 3&rsquo;s to the percentage they usually do, it would have been a blowout due to the Mavs&rsquo; poor perimeter defense (instead of a close-ish loss due to their overwhelmed interior defense).</p>

<p>Celtics defense is dictating what 3s the mavs get but the mavs defense is not dictating what Boston gets</p>

And they took and made the most 3s of any team in the NBA.</p>

<p>The idea that they did this entire record with 25% or less on open 3s shooters is so absolutely unhinged. They can shoot 3s other than corner 3s and have been shooting them well all season. The celtics are not the first team to drive them off the corners, timberwolves did that as well, that didn’t save them from a decent mavs 3 showing.</p>

<p>Celtics shot shit but so did the mavs, and they shot even worse than the celtics.</p>

<p>This idea that the Celtics are masterminds because mavs can only shoot corner 3s is only spread by Celtics fans who haven’t watched a single mavs or indeed western conference game all season long.</p>

      <label for="l85o6kx" class="commentText"><p>How does that change the point - the defense is still underperforming and it’s just being hidden a bit by favorable shot variance.  So Luka is wrong.  Especially bcs he personally is the one being hunted and blown by constantly to create these high quality looks.</p>

<p>EDIT:  some bitter Mavs fans here.  Tatum is having one of the worst shooting slumps of his career and there’s a solid argument his net impact is still a greater positive than Luka’s in this series.  that’s how terrible Luka’s defense has been.  Luka cannot stay in front of the ball and it’s springboarding the entire drive-and-kick offense for the Celtics.  y’all need to watch more film breakdowns if you don’t understand how bad it is.</p>

<p>If Boston and Dallas both made their regular season averages on those open/wide open shots, they both would&rsquo;ve made 3.7 more 3s and the score would be the same.</p>

<p>The part that does make it true is that since Luka has to do everything on offense, it seems like he&rsquo;s resting on defense to compensate.</p>

<p>The Thunder did the same exact thing, our role players just didn&rsquo;t hit open shots. Every time we attacked Luka, we got exactly what we wanted, which clearly the Celtics studied. Unless Luka learns to play defense mid-series, I don&rsquo;t see this improving for them</p>

Then Kyrie is a no show and even more pressure is on him, while Boston plays him 1v1 with some late traps and help. He is injured from start of the playoffs, adding injuries on the way. His offensive load is massive. He is a warrior. KP got a bubu and will sit out, because his team can do that. Mavs have no option and Luka would rather get traded than watch his team play without him in PO. Even if he is just 70% of what he could be. I&rsquo;m frustrated also when I watch him but context matter. I&rsquo;ve seen him lock people up this post season. Also against Celtics, people saying he got blown by on every possesion while that&rsquo;s not true.</p>

      <label for="l86e7bn" class="commentText"><p>He was able to clamp Anthony Edwards in multiple games. How is that possible? Is Luka more athletic than Ant?</p>

<p>The reality is that basketball is complicated and it can&rsquo;t be boiled down to something as simple as &ldquo;player X is bad at defense.&rdquo; Defensive effort and offensive effort are connected. If your offensive schemes aren&rsquo;t working and everything goes back to Luka-ball, then his defense is going to be awful because he doesn&rsquo;t have the throughput to do drive + late kick every single play and then turn around and stay in front of Tatum and Brown on the other end of the court.</p>

<p>If we look at the games and series where Luka played good or even great defense, we also have to look at what was going on offensively. Other guys were able to get involved and get in rhythm. Kyrie was able to take a significant portion of the facilitation work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Luka bad&rdquo; is typical 80 IQ Stephen A tier analysis.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this was allowed to happen because the Mavs offense is significantly better than the Wolves offense, at least in that series. Every player ended up becoming a scoring threat at some point, which meant Mavs offensive became very efficient. Luka didn&rsquo;t have to do everything. Several possessions would go by and he&rsquo;d expend very little effort on the offensive end, only to play really good defense on their star players.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the game of chess people talk about.</p>

<p>I do think that the defense is the bigger issue. Brown and Tatum are getting 2 feet in the paint every time down the floor and the C&rsquo;s are shooting about 3 more wide open 3&rsquo;s per game than they did in the regular season&hellip;and they shot a lot of wide open 3&rsquo;s per game in the regular season. Just because the C&rsquo;s are shooting about 3% worse on wide open 3&rsquo;s, doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s a good thing they are giving those up.</p>

<p>The offense, particularly from Kyrie, does need to be better too. I just don&rsquo;t see any resistance on the perimeter.</p>

      <label for="l86b7ku" class="commentText"><p>Well, it is more advantageous for Boston to let the Mavs shoot threes than take shots at the rim.</p>

<p>But the Mavs defense has been doing the same to every team it&rsquo;s faced in the playoffs regardless of whether they could shoot threes or not.</p>

<p>So both sides kinda have a point.</p>

      <label for="l863rr2" class="commentText"><p>I’d agree they’re missing those chances too. But the volume of good looks they’re creating is insane. In game 2 the C’s took more open and wide open 3’s (36) than the amount of 3’s the Mavs took at all (26). If both teams start hitting them at normal rates that’s way better for the Celtics.</p>

<p>And that’s without getting into what caliber of shooters are taking the shots. I’ve been wanted to do an analysis of expected 3pt% so far this series but haven’t done it yet.</p>

<p>Not only is he wrong about team defense.</p>

<p>1 minute clips aren&rsquo;t bullshit. He&rsquo;s playing atrocious defense. You could compile a dozen minute compilation of that shit.</p>

      <label for="l85z8uk" class="commentText"><p>With all his injuries you either get an above average offensive player and good defender or you get amazing offense for 2 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> quarters and shitty defense. Can&rsquo;t have both.</p>

<p>On games that Mavs won Kyrie was picking up the slack. He&rsquo;s played terribly in these first two games. IF he doesn&rsquo;t find his groove the series is over.</p>
