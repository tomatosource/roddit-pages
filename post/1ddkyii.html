      <label for="l86muue" class="commentText"><p>Kyrie and Mavs role players were obviously bricking their open 3&rsquo;s at <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>17</sub> or whatever they finished, but from watching the defensive scheme they were obviously leaving certain guys with open looks they were comfortable with giving them so they could hedge better against against Lukas drives.  It&rsquo;s not the same frantic rotation that you see out of the Mav&rsquo;s because the ball handler just blew by their primary defender at the point of attack.  The Mav&rsquo;s need to knock down those shots just to see how the game plays out when they can&rsquo;t just keep crowding Lukas space.  As it stands Boston&rsquo;s strategy seems to be to just be throwing body&rsquo;s at Luka until he&rsquo;s gassed half way through the 3rd, and unless someone starts knocking down those shots consistently it&rsquo;ll probably work again in at least 2 of the next 5 games.</p>

      <label for="l86szg0" class="commentText"><p>I mean, that&rsquo;s part of the strategy. Guard the corner 3&rsquo;s, but if PJ Washington or Derrick Jones Jr are above the break, let them shoot a 3 because they&rsquo;re shooting 28.6% and 26.3% there respectively, which is about 25%.</p>

<p>Granted, Kyrie is the one that needs to make those shots. But he&rsquo;s having to take such hard shots, that he doesn&rsquo;t have the opportunity to get into a rhythm.</p>

      <label for="l86vub0" class="commentText"><p>They&rsquo;re shooting that <em>in the playoffs</em> which is almost a meaningless sample size. PJ Washington was <em>better</em> on above the break threes than corner threes this season and last.</p>

<p>Regular season Above-the-Break %:</p>

<p>PJ 37%<br>
DJJ 35%<br>
Exum 54%<br>
Green 39%<br>
Maxi 40%</p>

<p>But this sample size is only slightly more useful anyway, but I want to kind of dispel the notion that these guys didn&rsquo;t make above the break 3s in the regular season. They shot pretty well! 35% is about average, so all of the guys getting minutes in this series shot above average on them.</p>

<p>The big difference is volume. PJ Washington is the only guy on the Mavs who took more than two above the break 3s a game. The rest of the team just isn&rsquo;t comfortable letting it fly, and you&rsquo;ll see the Celtics daring guys like DJJ, Maxi, or Exum to shoot and they won&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>i contribute it mostly to having to change the olaystyle from the other series + finals pressure. but kyrie should have beeen able to overcome under &ldquo;normal&rdquo; circumstances, and this game would have been way diff</p>

<p>i was just cheekily (:p) pointing out how saying that the celtics should have score their open shots and get 125 looks compared to (at least kyrie contributing to) the mavs scoring things they should and have done</p>

      <label for="l865xjf" class="commentText"><p>This isn&rsquo;t quite right. The shot quality of Dallas&rsquo; misses versus Boston&rsquo;s, both in terms of who was taking them and how open they were, means that Boston has a lot more progression to reach the mean than Dallas does presuming they continue to generate shots of roughly similar quality. I don&rsquo;t think that will be the case if Porzingas is out but Dallas caught more of a break than Boston in terms of shot variance.</p>

Point is if Dallas could score worth a shit outside Luka this series is 1-1 as defense has been fine outside a few stretches of each game. The offense is just horrendous thanks to Kyrie no showing and role guys not making the open shots. Make the open shots and the defense has to think more.</p>

<p>Once the team starts doing their jobs on offense, Luka will play harder on defense. The same way we&rsquo;ve seen him step up all playoffs on D. It&rsquo;s just insanely hard to do when you are literally the only one showing up on offense.</p>

<p>If the role players or even Kyrie start shooting well, Luka will have more to give on the other end. That&rsquo;s not to say were going to get DPOY defense from him, but it&rsquo;ll be miles better than him poking at the ball while the Celtics drive past him.</p>

<p>Luka can&rsquo;t do everything, there&rsquo;s only so much he can do. But I can assure you if he gets help on the offense, the blow by plays will be fewer. All playoffs long he&rsquo;s shown what he can do on defense, these past 2 games where neither Kyrie or his role players showed up and Luka&rsquo;s defense looks like regular season defense. B/c he has to do it all on the other end.</p>

      <label for="l86j23t" class="commentText"><p>While that is absolutely true, I would say It&rsquo;s about as meaningless with Luka as it could be with any other player in the NBA. That&rsquo;s not an insult, but a compliment.</p>

<p>The guy just does not have to put up a lot of effort and activity to get a good look and a bucket. He can literally slowly walk towards the basket, take a slow step back and fade away, and it&rsquo;s cash money. In terms of effort&hellip;.. Lukas game does not demand that super high intensity that many other stars do.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a great argument for someone like Steph Curry, who&rsquo;s out there just running circles around the court on the offensive end. But Luka should be able to put up meaningful effort on defense at the same time he&rsquo;s putting up his normal offensive game, as long as he&rsquo;s got a decent conditioning.</p>

It’s also part of why I think it’s unfair to discount the Dallas defense and not Boston. Dallas has a MUCH tougher job because everyone is a shooter on Boston.</p>

<p>Boston is clearly the better team. I think Mavs win one in Dallas to avoid a sweep. KP missing does change things a bit but I don’t think it’s enough.</p>

      <label for="l86vgku" class="commentText"><p>The looks haven&rsquo;t been the same? You can look at a shot chart, this is just wrong lol. The Mavs are down from 11.2 corner 3s per game these playoffs to 4 in the past two games. Your role players that take 3s are &amp;gt;40% from the corner and &amp;lt;30% above the break this season. Not every 3 is the same 3, there&rsquo;s a reason NBA teams prioritize the corner 3, it&rsquo;s the easiest 3 pointer to make because it&rsquo;s the closest to the basket. So while both teams are missing open 3s, the Cs are missing <em>more</em> open 3s relative to their shooting percentages for that particular shot than the Mavs are.</p>

      <label for="l86ohac" class="commentText"><p>Yes I think so. Boston’s has solved Dallas defense</p>

<p>“The Celtics have neutralized the Mavericks defense’s biggest strength in the NBA Finals</p>

<p>Dallas’ defense almost demands perfection from the opposing five players on the floor, because the Mavericks pounce when there’s even one subpar offensive player sharing the floor. So what happens when a team can play five above-average offensive players for a full-48 minutes? Well, you have the Celtics taking some of the bite out of the Mavericks defense and a big reason they’re up 2-0 in the NBA Finals after a 105-98 win in Game 2 Sunday night.</p>

<p>After going a perfect 15-of-15 in the restricted area in Game 1, the Celtics went 20-of-27 in Game 2. Dallas entered the Finals only allowing opponents to make 59.6 percent of their shots in the restricted area in the first three rounds of the playoffs. Now the Celtics are not only winning the battle at the three point line (26 made threes to the Mavericks 13 in the two games), but they’re scoring well at the rim. Dallas has survived the three point gap up until now because the rim was entirely shut off. Now the Mavericks are giving up both.</p>

<p>What makes it worse is that Boston isn’t doing anything overtly complicated or complex: the Celtics aren’t a heavy pick and roll team, and they don’t have a dominant playmaker that’s impossible to deal with. Instead they just throw constant, consistent pressure at you from all five players on the floor and Dallas’ drive containment has been absolutely compromised due to how unique the Celtics rotation is”</p>

      <label for="l86ultc" class="commentText"><p>Yeah that’s basically correct. When a 42% 3pt shooter goes 0-5 that’s unlucky, when a 32% 3 pt shooter is forced off his spot and misses that’s good defense. </p>

<p>If the Mavs win because PJ Washington went off from 3 then you kinda live with it because that’s a one-off occurrence.</p>

And they took and made the most 3s of any team in the NBA.</p>

<p>The idea that they did this entire record with 25% or less on open 3s shooters is so absolutely unhinged. They can shoot 3s other than corner 3s and have been shooting them well all season. The celtics are not the first team to drive them off the corners, timberwolves did that as well, that didn’t save them from a decent mavs 3 showing.</p>

<p>Celtics shot shit but so did the mavs, and they shot even worse than the celtics.</p>

<p>This idea that the Celtics are masterminds because mavs can only shoot corner 3s is only spread by Celtics fans who haven’t watched a single mavs or indeed western conference game all season long.</p>

<p>They didn&rsquo;t do it shooting nearly 0 open threes from the corners. If the Mavs can&rsquo;t generate open threes from the corners, they&rsquo;re screwed. And the Celtics&rsquo; defensive strategy is to allow above the break 3s in favor of preventing corner looks.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous to claim that NBA level shooters shooting 11% from 3 is due to a defensive scheme. It&rsquo;s fine to say that them getting run of the corner was deliberate but they still just bricked way more completely open shots than players of this calibre should be.</p>

<p>They literally do!! The Celtics defense is not rotating to certain shooters above the break on purpose. Go watch some of the misses and you will that they are wide open on purpose, no one is even attempting to close out on a lot of them.</p>

<p>Because they had to double team Luka. The Mavs created those open shots, not the Celtics. They ideally don&rsquo;t want them shooting open shots, but they were forced to double Luka because he was scoring a lot in isolation.</p>

<p>They prefer wing 3&rsquo;s over corner 3&rsquo;s, but they still obviously don&rsquo;t want open looks.</p>

Their 3-point shooters aren&rsquo;t actually really that good outside of that one shot. Go look back at the defense the Celtics are playing, you see the Celtics player always just sag off or help off the Mavs shooter leaving them wide open when they take an above-the-break 3</p>

      <label for="l863eti" class="commentText"><p>Obviously their shooting percentages are an outlier and I expect it to improve because no shit 11% OUTSIDE of Luka (btw, its outside of Luka, not the whole team) that isn’t something that’s normal. But at the same time, how much more will that increase even matter when they’re taking lower efficiency shots AND the Celtics are also missing good looks. Mavs are like a 32% shooting team in general, so even if you assume both teams regress to the mean, the math game still favors the Celtics. So it doesn’t matter, if Mavs can’t take advantage of this type of game from us where Tatum also went 6-22, then I’m not sure how else they’re supposed to win.</p>

The Mavs&rsquo; defense hasn&rsquo;t been great as Boston got a ton of great shot opportunities in Game 2 that were just missed. Good case of needing to watch the game to understand which team dominated the flow of the game beyond just reading the stat sheet.</p>

<p>And, just as I have seen a bunch of people say &ldquo;If the Mavs make their FTs they win game 2&rdquo;, that what-if logic has to cut both ways: If the C&rsquo;s made their open 3&rsquo;s to the percentage they usually do, it would have been a blowout due to the Mavs&rsquo; poor perimeter defense (instead of a close-ish loss due to their overwhelmed interior defense).</p>

They aren&rsquo;t getting corner 3s they are getting them above the break. So even though they are open you would expect them to be worse.</p>

<p>Celtics defense is dictating what 3s the mavs get but the mavs defense is not dictating what Boston gets</p>

But PJ Washington was couldn&rsquo;t hit corner three in regular season (he wasn&rsquo;t just missing, they were real Westbrook style bricks), while he was ok from everywhere else. Then he turned into a corner three specialist in playoffs. So I wouldn&rsquo;t say that&rsquo;s excatly true.</p>

<p>The truth is both teams are missing a lot of open shots, it just looks worse for Boston, because they&rsquo;re shooting more threes.</p>

      <label for="l85o6kx" class="commentText"><p>How does that change the point - the defense is still underperforming and it’s just being hidden a bit by favorable shot variance.  So Luka is wrong.  Especially bcs he personally is the one being hunted and blown by constantly to create these high quality looks.</p>

<p>EDIT:  some bitter Mavs fans here.  Tatum is having one of the worst shooting slumps of his career and there’s a solid argument his net impact is still a greater positive than Luka’s in this series.  that’s how terrible Luka’s defense has been.  Luka cannot stay in front of the ball and it’s springboarding the entire drive-and-kick offense for the Celtics.  y’all need to watch more film breakdowns if you don’t understand how bad it is.</p>

<p>The Thunder did the same exact thing, our role players just didn&rsquo;t hit open shots. Every time we attacked Luka, we got exactly what we wanted, which clearly the Celtics studied. Unless Luka learns to play defense mid-series, I don&rsquo;t see this improving for them</p>

Then Kyrie is a no show and even more pressure is on him, while Boston plays him 1v1 with some late traps and help. He is injured from start of the playoffs, adding injuries on the way. His offensive load is massive. He is a warrior. KP got a bubu and will sit out, because his team can do that. Mavs have no option and Luka would rather get traded than watch his team play without him in PO. Even if he is just 70% of what he could be. I&rsquo;m frustrated also when I watch him but context matter. I&rsquo;ve seen him lock people up this post season. Also against Celtics, people saying he got blown by on every possesion while that&rsquo;s not true.</p>

<p>The reality is that basketball is complicated and it can&rsquo;t be boiled down to something as simple as &ldquo;player X is bad at defense.&rdquo; Defensive effort and offensive effort are connected. If your offensive schemes aren&rsquo;t working and everything goes back to Luka-ball, then his defense is going to be awful because he doesn&rsquo;t have the throughput to do drive + late kick every single play and then turn around and stay in front of Tatum and Brown on the other end of the court.</p>

<p>If we look at the games and series where Luka played good or even great defense, we also have to look at what was going on offensively. Other guys were able to get involved and get in rhythm. Kyrie was able to take a significant portion of the facilitation work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Luka bad&rdquo; is typical 80 IQ Stephen A tier analysis.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this was allowed to happen because the Mavs offense is significantly better than the Wolves offense, at least in that series. Every player ended up becoming a scoring threat at some point, which meant Mavs offensive became very efficient. Luka didn&rsquo;t have to do everything. Several possessions would go by and he&rsquo;d expend very little effort on the offensive end, only to play really good defense on their star players.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the game of chess people talk about.</p>

The only reason that&rsquo;s changed in these last 2 games is b/c he&rsquo;s quite literally the only offensive option on the team. Without Kyrie of the role players giving him a break on the offensive end, he&rsquo;s going to let people blow by him on defense b/c of how much effort he&rsquo;s putting in on the other end.</p>

<p>Not athletic enough. Dude is playing 40+ minutes as the only reliable scorer. Of course he&rsquo;s gassed on defense.</p>

<p>I do think that the defense is the bigger issue. Brown and Tatum are getting 2 feet in the paint every time down the floor and the C&rsquo;s are shooting about 3 more wide open 3&rsquo;s per game than they did in the regular season&hellip;and they shot a lot of wide open 3&rsquo;s per game in the regular season. Just because the C&rsquo;s are shooting about 3% worse on wide open 3&rsquo;s, doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s a good thing they are giving those up.</p>

<p>The offense, particularly from Kyrie, does need to be better too. I just don&rsquo;t see any resistance on the perimeter.</p>

They have the best offense (or second best, after Indiana, I don&rsquo;t remember what the final number was) in the league for a reason. They&rsquo;ll always generate a lot of good looks. Still they&rsquo;re scoring less than usual, so Mavs must be doing something right.</p>

<p>The offense has been a real problem for Mavs. There are no easy points and too many missed threes.</p>

<p>Yeah it&rsquo;s just then missing wide open shots and has nothing to do with the mavs defence, mavs didn&rsquo;t suddenly find this brand new strategy of leave 3 point shooters wide open in the corner.</p>

<p>Like it&rsquo;s not a good strategy they are just getting lucky that celtics have been missing wide open shots</p>

      <label for="l86qhgs" class="commentText"><p>Yes, it’s less the defense and more bad shooting and missed opportunities by Boston. What’s also worth mentioning though is that it’s not some sort of guarantee that things will improve for the Celtics. This is the biggest stage with the highest stakes, the shots may continue not to fall. Tatum’s poor shooting sample size is growing in the Finals - he’s doing great things to circumvent that elsewhere, but if the rest of the team keeps missing open opportunities like in Game 2, Dallas may be able to come back in this series. They just need someone other than Luka to step up, or to just accept that he has to double his shots per game. I still like Boston but this is not over yet.</p>

      <label for="l862rep" class="commentText"><p>And the Mavs in the first two games were <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>23</sub> (21.7%) on open threes and <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub> (25%) on wide open threes.</p>

<p>Would you agree the Mavs also missed on great shot chances and the Celtics defense hasn&rsquo;t been that great?</p>

      <label for="l86b7ku" class="commentText"><p>Well, it is more advantageous for Boston to let the Mavs shoot threes than take shots at the rim.</p>

<p>But the Mavs defense has been doing the same to every team it&rsquo;s faced in the playoffs regardless of whether they could shoot threes or not.</p>

<p>So both sides kinda have a point.</p>

      <label for="l863rr2" class="commentText"><p>I’d agree they’re missing those chances too. But the volume of good looks they’re creating is insane. In game 2 the C’s took more open and wide open 3’s (36) than the amount of 3’s the Mavs took at all (26). If both teams start hitting them at normal rates that’s way better for the Celtics.</p>

<p>And that’s without getting into what caliber of shooters are taking the shots. I’ve been wanted to do an analysis of expected 3pt% so far this series but haven’t done it yet.</p>

<p>His team has played bad defense, they were handled in Game 1 and Game 2 the Celtics shot absolutely terribly on wide open shots.</p>

<p>And I have a strong feeling it&rsquo;s why Luka is saying the defense is fine.</p>

      <label for="l86p81i" class="commentText"><p>Yep. He was hurt apparently the entire first two series (wasn&rsquo;t injured til like game 4 when they realized he was gonna get out of his funk) and then all of a sudden against Minnesota, dude was fine. Now all of a sudden down 0-2 with some of the worst defense I&rsquo;ve ever seen, he&rsquo;s injured again.</p>
