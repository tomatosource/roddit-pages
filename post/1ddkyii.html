      <label for="l873x9r" class="commentText"><p>I think this is fair.</p>

<p>I don’t think if the Mavs had magically hit the 3s they bricked they would’ve won, purely in terms of “bad night shooting” logic. Especially since the Cs we’re also shooting 25% from 3 in game 2, and correcting for only one team doesn’t make sense.</p>

<p>But it would have changed the dynamic of the game, maybe forced the Cs to defend differently. Had the Cs still won maybe they would need to be thinking about the defensive strategy going forward, to protect against the rest of the Mavs pumping up the score.</p>

<p>Instead Kyrie is a no-show and the rest of the team have settled into their status as “role players doomed to be forgotten if they don’t figure something out”.</p>

<p>And honestly, as much as people on this sub are doing the “the Mavs are playing bad” thing I think it’s pretty obvious that they’re just not up to the task of challenging this defense. Kyrie has been shut down as much as he’s shooting poorly, and the rest of the team was never going to be a serious problem anyways - they’re the Luka and Kyrie show.</p>

<p>Must be frustrating for Luka, who had a tremendous game won offense.</p>

<p>Those percentages are basically flipped for Luka and Kyrie.</p>

<p>Mazzula&rsquo;s gameplan is to play those percentages. It&rsquo;s not that they can&rsquo;t make those shots, it&rsquo;s that when they take them, they&rsquo;re not likely to make enough to matter at all. In fact, it&rsquo;s likely to be a detriment to their team because they could be making a 2-pointer at a higher rate per possession. Mazzula wants them to take those shots because the numbers show that over seven games, those are basically wasted possessions for the mavs.</p>

      <label for="l86muue" class="commentText"><p>Kyrie and Mavs role players were obviously bricking their open 3&rsquo;s at <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>17</sub> or whatever they finished, but from watching the defensive scheme they were obviously leaving certain guys with open looks they were comfortable with giving them so they could hedge better against against Lukas drives.  It&rsquo;s not the same frantic rotation that you see out of the Mav&rsquo;s because the ball handler just blew by their primary defender at the point of attack.  The Mav&rsquo;s need to knock down those shots just to see how the game plays out when they can&rsquo;t just keep crowding Lukas space.  As it stands Boston&rsquo;s strategy seems to be to just be throwing body&rsquo;s at Luka until he&rsquo;s gassed half way through the 3rd, and unless someone starts knocking down those shots consistently it&rsquo;ll probably work again in at least 2 of the next 5 games.</p>

      <label for="l86szg0" class="commentText"><p>I mean, that&rsquo;s part of the strategy. Guard the corner 3&rsquo;s, but if PJ Washington or Derrick Jones Jr are above the break, let them shoot a 3 because they&rsquo;re shooting 28.6% and 26.3% there respectively, which is about 25%.</p>

<p>Granted, Kyrie is the one that needs to make those shots. But he&rsquo;s having to take such hard shots, that he doesn&rsquo;t have the opportunity to get into a rhythm.</p>

      <label for="l86vub0" class="commentText"><p>They&rsquo;re shooting that <em>in the playoffs</em> which is almost a meaningless sample size. PJ Washington was <em>better</em> on above the break threes than corner threes this season and last.</p>

<p>Regular season Above-the-Break %:</p>

<p>PJ 37%<br>
DJJ 35%<br>
Exum 54%<br>
Green 39%<br>
Maxi 40%</p>

<p>But this sample size is only slightly more useful anyway, but I want to kind of dispel the notion that these guys didn&rsquo;t make above the break 3s in the regular season. They shot pretty well! 35% is about average, so all of the guys getting minutes in this series shot above average on them.</p>

<p>The big difference is volume. PJ Washington is the only guy on the Mavs who took more than two above the break 3s a game. The rest of the team just isn&rsquo;t comfortable letting it fly, and you&rsquo;ll see the Celtics daring guys like DJJ, Maxi, or Exum to shoot and they won&rsquo;t.</p>

      <label for="l86o16d" class="commentText"><p>oh yes, for sure. as i said later, i dont disagree. mavs defense, particulsrly in the first, wasnt good. and, offensively, the first game was terrible and their defensive tactic definitely won the game</p>

<p>i contribute it mostly to having to change the olaystyle from the other series + finals pressure. but kyrie should have beeen able to overcome under &ldquo;normal&rdquo; circumstances, and this game would have been way diff</p>

<p>i was just cheekily (:p) pointing out how saying that the celtics should have score their open shots and get 125 looks compared to (at least kyrie contributing to) the mavs scoring things they should and have done</p>

<p>Once the team starts doing their jobs on offense, Luka will play harder on defense. The same way we&rsquo;ve seen him step up all playoffs on D. It&rsquo;s just insanely hard to do when you are literally the only one showing up on offense.</p>

<p>If the role players or even Kyrie start shooting well, Luka will have more to give on the other end. That&rsquo;s not to say were going to get DPOY defense from him, but it&rsquo;ll be miles better than him poking at the ball while the Celtics drive past him.</p>

<p>Luka can&rsquo;t do everything, there&rsquo;s only so much he can do. But I can assure you if he gets help on the offense, the blow by plays will be fewer. All playoffs long he&rsquo;s shown what he can do on defense, these past 2 games where neither Kyrie or his role players showed up and Luka&rsquo;s defense looks like regular season defense. B/c he has to do it all on the other end.</p>

      <label for="l86j23t" class="commentText"><p>While that is absolutely true, I would say It&rsquo;s about as meaningless with Luka as it could be with any other player in the NBA. That&rsquo;s not an insult, but a compliment.</p>

<p>The guy just does not have to put up a lot of effort and activity to get a good look and a bucket. He can literally slowly walk towards the basket, take a slow step back and fade away, and it&rsquo;s cash money. In terms of effort&hellip;.. Lukas game does not demand that super high intensity that many other stars do.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a great argument for someone like Steph Curry, who&rsquo;s out there just running circles around the court on the offensive end. But Luka should be able to put up meaningful effort on defense at the same time he&rsquo;s putting up his normal offensive game, as long as he&rsquo;s got a decent conditioning.</p>

      <label for="l86j76e" class="commentText"><p>Oh, I 100% agree with that. Bostons role players are definitely better than the those of the Mavs, but the looks have been the same. Dallas isn’t missing them because the Celtics are just contesting them better. The Celtics defense has been much better than the Mavs at obstructing passing lanes. The non-Luka Mavs just can’t shoot even when Luka gets them wide open looks.</p>

      <label for="l86k54j" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, for the record I&rsquo;m rooting for the Mavs but it felt like an insurmountable mountain in game 2. Like the Cs were a far better team leading even when they&rsquo;re hitting jack shit, because every Mavs attempt was a huge grind or Luka Magic while the Cs waltzed into open 3s, layups, and trips to the line. Over the course of a game it&rsquo;s a crushing advantage.</p>

      <label for="l86xvsz" class="commentText"><p>I mean there’s a big difference between Sam Hauser (42.2%) going 0-5 on open looks and PJ Washington (32.0%) going 1-5 on open looks. There’s the intuitive piece but there’s also the hard numbers to back it up.   </p>

<p>What the Celtics are doing defensively is working as intended, what the Mavs are doing defensively is still giving the Celtics what they want even if the shots aren’t falling.</p>

      <label for="l86lmf5" class="commentText"><p>100%. Every Mavs bucket is Luka carrying the team but Boston just has so many good options. It’s also part of why I think it’s unfair to discount the Dallas defense and not Boston. Dallas has a MUCH tougher job because everyone is a shooter on Boston.</p>

<p>Boston is clearly the better team. I think Mavs win one in Dallas to avoid a sweep. KP missing does change things a bit but I don’t think it’s enough.</p>

<p>But yeah on defense this team is kinda iffy vs. the Celtics. And while the Wolves for some inexplicable reason decided to let Luka rest for half the game, The Celtics are doing everything in their power to make that boy prove he got on the treadmill lol</p>

      <label for="l86vgku" class="commentText"><p>The looks haven&rsquo;t been the same? You can look at a shot chart, this is just wrong lol. The Mavs are down from 11.2 corner 3s per game these playoffs to 4 in the past two games. Your role players that take 3s are &amp;gt;40% from the corner and &amp;lt;30% above the break this season. Not every 3 is the same 3, there&rsquo;s a reason NBA teams prioritize the corner 3, it&rsquo;s the easiest 3 pointer to make because it&rsquo;s the closest to the basket. So while both teams are missing open 3s, the Cs are missing <em>more</em> open 3s relative to their shooting percentages for that particular shot than the Mavs are.</p>

<p>If the Mavs win because PJ Washington went off from 3 then you kinda live with it because that’s a one-off occurrence.</p>

<p>What actually happened is the Celtics posted a very beatable ortg, while the Mavs have posted 2 pathetic ones. Credit to Boston&rsquo;s defense.

And they took and made the most 3s of any team in the NBA.</p>

<p>The idea that they did this entire record with 25% or less on open 3s shooters is so absolutely unhinged. They can shoot 3s other than corner 3s and have been shooting them well all season. The celtics are not the first team to drive them off the corners, timberwolves did that as well, that didn’t save them from a decent mavs 3 showing.</p>

<p>Celtics shot shit but so did the mavs, and they shot even worse than the celtics.</p>

<p>This idea that the Celtics are masterminds because mavs can only shoot corner 3s is only spread by Celtics fans who haven’t watched a single mavs or indeed western conference game all season long.</p>

      <label for="l85keb7" class="commentText"><p>This is a great observation. The Mavs&rsquo; defense hasn&rsquo;t been great as Boston got a ton of great shot opportunities in Game 2 that were just missed. Good case of needing to watch the game to understand which team dominated the flow of the game beyond just reading the stat sheet.</p>

<p>And, just as I have seen a bunch of people say &ldquo;If the Mavs make their FTs they win game 2&rdquo;, that what-if logic has to cut both ways: If the C&rsquo;s made their open 3&rsquo;s to the percentage they usually do, it would have been a blowout due to the Mavs&rsquo; poor perimeter defense (instead of a close-ish loss due to their overwhelmed interior defense).</p>

The truth is in the middle.  The Mavs offense has been pretty putrid AND they need to defend better</p>

<p>Celtics defense is dictating what 3s the mavs get but the mavs defense is not dictating what Boston gets</p>

But PJ Washington was couldn&rsquo;t hit corner three in regular season (he wasn&rsquo;t just missing, they were real Westbrook style bricks), while he was ok from everywhere else. Then he turned into a corner three specialist in playoffs. So I wouldn&rsquo;t say that&rsquo;s excatly true.</p>

<p>The truth is both teams are missing a lot of open shots, it just looks worse for Boston, because they&rsquo;re shooting more threes.</p>

<p>The only guy who I would straight up say is clearly better from the corner than above the break is Josh Green. PJ Washington had been atrocious from the corners in the regular seasons. DJJ is really the same from either spot (not a great shooter no matter what though).</p>

<p>The lob threat and corner 3s have not been lost but rather taken away by Boston defense.</p>

<p>Kyrie&rsquo;s offense could just be him but I&rsquo;m sure Boston had something to do with his inability to consistently get whatever he wants.</p>

      <label for="l85ktwh" class="commentText"><p>Dallas isn&rsquo;t getting the shots they normally make, though. Some of those 3s are Kyrie missing shots (which is its own thing) but a lot of it is the fact that Boston is denying Dallas the corner threes they&rsquo;d relied on. DJJ or PJ Washington shooting an above the break 3 is a good outcome for Boston even if they&rsquo;re open.</p>

<p>Whereas a decent chunk of mavs wide open looks are above the break 3s from role players that the celtics are purposely giving the shot.</p>

<p>So celtics are shooting bad on shots that their offence was designed to create.</p>

<p>The Thunder did the same exact thing, our role players just didn&rsquo;t hit open shots. Every time we attacked Luka, we got exactly what we wanted, which clearly the Celtics studied. Unless Luka learns to play defense mid-series, I don&rsquo;t see this improving for them</p>

      <label for="l87i1fn" class="commentText"><p>He’s right. The Dallas defense has been great. They’ve held Boston well below their averages for offensive rating and 3pt shooting. They’ve completely stopped Tatum from scoring and made him look like a fool. Luka in particular has been great at slowing him down and not letting him get to his preferred spots.</p>

<p>They just need to hit open shots, which I expect they will do now that they’re at home. Dallas shot 25% on wide open threes in G2. Role players play better at home. I would expect guys like Washington, DJJ, Kleber, Exum, etc to all hit timely shots in G3 and G4. Kyrie should also finally figure it out; he has historical precedent for being a bit bad in games 1 and 2 but he figures it out more times than not.</p>

<ul>
<li>In game 1, Tatum was <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>, but the rest of the starting line-up was .500</li>
<li>Game 2, Tatum was <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>22</sub>, but he got 12 assists and the rest of the starting line-up shot .562</li>
</ul>

<p>Inversely, Boston&rsquo;s defence HAS been great. They&rsquo;ve made Kyrie inefficient, are living with whatever Luka is able to do, and closing out the lobs and corner threes.</p>

<p>It looks like the Mavs will be lucky enough to not have to deal with Porzingus, which should help them out because he&rsquo;s been fantastic this series (<sup>12</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> from the field) and 6 &lsquo;stocks&rsquo; over the two games.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s actually nuts. Our defense has been great, this is one of the best offenses in recent memory that we are holding that low.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re 100% right that our offense has been complete shit. Luka has been fine, but certainly not even up to his levels. Celtics defense is crazy good and versatile</p>

      <label for="l87yvg7" class="commentText"><p>Yeah. The Mavs absolutely have to figure out a way to make the Celtics defense rotate at all. Idk how they do it because at this point Kyrie will have to show an ability to score with ease vs White/Brown/Jrue that he absolutely hasn’t yet. At this point the best option is for Luka to keep attacking Tatum and hoping they eventually send him some help. Other than that it seems like Boston is fine with just letting Dallas bang their heads against the wall isoing.</p>

<p>Tbf though Dallas is doing the same thing, allowing the Celtics to hunt mismatches. It’s working a little better for them because of how bad Kyrie has been meaning Luka can’t conserve ANY energy. They’re going to have to attack Tatum (who’s really been the only guy giving up even somewhat easy shots) and hope it eventually forces the Celtics to send at least some help.</p>

If our bigs can play their game and hunt horford, there&rsquo;s a path to leave Dallas 2-2. Not gonna be easy though and there&rsquo;s no room for error.</p>

<p>And yes. Kyrie needs to not be ass. He doesn&rsquo;t even need to be a superstar, he just needs to hit his open looks and settle down.</p>

<p>I do think that the defense is the bigger issue. Brown and Tatum are getting 2 feet in the paint every time down the floor and the C&rsquo;s are shooting about 3 more wide open 3&rsquo;s per game than they did in the regular season&hellip;and they shot a lot of wide open 3&rsquo;s per game in the regular season. Just because the C&rsquo;s are shooting about 3% worse on wide open 3&rsquo;s, doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s a good thing they are giving those up.</p>

<p>The offense, particularly from Kyrie, does need to be better too. I just don&rsquo;t see any resistance on the perimeter.</p>

They have the best offense (or second best, after Indiana, I don&rsquo;t remember what the final number was) in the league for a reason. They&rsquo;ll always generate a lot of good looks. Still they&rsquo;re scoring less than usual, so Mavs must be doing something right.</p>

<p>The offense has been a real problem for Mavs. There are no easy points and too many missed threes.</p>

      <label for="l86qhgs" class="commentText"><p>Yes, it’s less the defense and more bad shooting and missed opportunities by Boston. What’s also worth mentioning though is that it’s not some sort of guarantee that things will improve for the Celtics. This is the biggest stage with the highest stakes, the shots may continue not to fall. Tatum’s poor shooting sample size is growing in the Finals - he’s doing great things to circumvent that elsewhere, but if the rest of the team keeps missing open opportunities like in Game 2, Dallas may be able to come back in this series. They just need someone other than Luka to step up, or to just accept that he has to double his shots per game. I still like Boston but this is not over yet.</p>

      <label for="l888mvm" class="commentText"><p>100% Boston&rsquo;s defense. They are smothering any drive and they are stepping up on every pnr or kickout for 3.</p>

<p>This is not an issue of Dallas shooting poorly. Boston&rsquo;s defense is forcing tough shots.</p>

<p>Luka can somehow still get into the lane, and he is hitting very tough shots, but Ky and the others absolutely cannot. Lively looks like a rookie for the first time all season.</p>

<p>Mavs have to start aggressively moving without the ball and passing to guys already in motion. They have to get Boston&rsquo;s defenders out of position so they get the good open looks that got them here. They need to stop relying on their centers in the pnr so much because the Celtics are totally ready for this. Dallas has to keep running, but since Boston is defending the rim so well on fast breaks, they have to rely more on the secondary break to get open for shots.</p>

<p>It is amazing how tough and competitive the Western Conf playoffs were, how Dallas fought and won, and how the Celtics have been so clearly superior for the first two games. I am excited to see how Kidd and his team adapt for the next two games at home. Doing the same thing as rhe first two games is a guaranteed loss this series.</p>

      <label for="l88f5wx" class="commentText"><p>As a Mavs fan, I don’t think letting everyone blow by you and then scrambling on close-outs is the best defensive strategy. I know we don’t have the absolute best personnel to defend the Celtics but there has to be something better than that.</p>

      <label for="l88pzgv" class="commentText"><p>He’s right. Holding the Celtics to 105 and 107 is pretty good defense in 2024. Scoring 89 and 98 is the problem.</p>
