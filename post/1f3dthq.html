      <label for="lkeaqqk" class="commentText"><p>Beware buzzed rant follows:</p>

<p>Just in case someone gets the wrong idea, Wilt had amazing leg strength and vertical jumping ability as in track and field, one of the events he competed in was the high jump, yes he had a bit of an advantage as he was 7 foot, but still, he did it well.</p>

<p>To me MJ is the GOAT simply because he&rsquo;s at least in the top 5 of greatest players ever in so many categories by even his haters, his mindset and drive, his championships and what he did for the game, to me its impossible not to have him as THE GOAT, no matter how mad that makes the LeBron fans as that last part will always make MJ vs LeBron discussions moot in my eyes.</p>

<p>But as far as the GOAT for the best PLAYER ever in terms of pure ability and if they could actually harness that ability actually give results that show season after season as being the most elite, it will to me always be Wilt, he was just that much MORE than everyone else.</p>

<p>You need impossible to stop inside offence? Check!</p>

<p>Inside defense vs the elite of the elite? Check!</p>

<p>Need a guy to lead the league in blocks? Check!</p>

<p>Big man outside shooting? Check!</p>

<p>Lead the league in assist while being an offensive and defensive juggernaut? Check!</p>

<p>Need a guy with ball handling skills? Would a former Harlem Globetrotter fit the bill? Check!</p>

<p>Need him to be quick enough to steal the ball from guards? Check!</p>

<p>Endurance? Need a guy that can literally play 48 minutes and run the floor the whole time with speed and quickness? Check!</p>

<p>Need a guy that stays healthy overall most of his career despite the league gunning for him as one of the top of the league and the superstar on the team focuses to stop during an extremely physical era? Check!</p>

<p>Need a guy that can score 100 in a game? Only one name on that list&hellip; Check!</p>

<p>Do all that and be a freak of nature non bean-pole built 7 footer? Check!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>MJ and Kareem are the only two really that can come close to his all around dominance in almost every aspect of the game, but both can&rsquo;t quite match him in checking as many boxes as he does, and quite frankly most others fall way further behind.</p>

<p>Let me get this out of the way since its inevitable, like yeah inside the paint, Shaq might match him, but Wilt would run him into the ground by the 2nd Quarter and even if he decided to not do that to Shaq as even young and hungry Shaq couldnt keep up with Wilts pace if he put his mind to it, Wilt would not be hampered much by Shaq as Wilt doesn&rsquo;t have to play inside the paint to be dominant, he can shoot from midrange or even the three point line if they matched up in the modern era and just nullify and perceived advantage by Shaq, unlike Shaq who couldt hit a barn from 15 foot away as he is always brought up when Wilt is as the answer by a few dim bulbs, and it&rsquo;s a very uninformed take as Wilt would win any matchup with Shaq easily, yes he would limit Wilt SOME inside, but could Shaq keep up as Wilt will also limit him, and Shaq has no answer when Wilt doesn&rsquo;t slow down his scoring at will by simply putting it up midrange or with the hook seen in the video above demonstrated over and over.</p>

<p>Wilt to me is the best Basketball player to ever step onto the court bar none, not even MJ or Kareem can hold a candle to what he was capable of. It&rsquo;s a shame he never had some better support on the teams he was on to take a little of the heat off of him, as just imagine if he could build teams like Lebron has where he&rsquo;s got a true Big Three setup to take the pressure off, people wouldn&rsquo;t be able to shit on his lack of success then if that would have been the case, as he would have had a fist full of rings easy.</p>

<p>If Wemby puts on 40-50 pounds of muscle, and develops a dead eye shot, and lives up to and surpasses his hype, and plays for 12+ years, he might have a shot for Wilts title, but that&rsquo;s a lot of ifs, and until that day comes, to me the best player ever by far is Wilt, it just sucks that people today dont give him his dues just because of his era, as his physique growing up and competing today would work just as well if not better as he would then have all the same advantages as today&rsquo;s players have with diet, equipment, advanced offensive/defensive gameplans that have evolved since then and more, he would be just as dominant today as he was back then and instead dominate everyone as Shaq retired and he was the only big man left other than Hakeem that could slow Wilt in his prime down, no one today could deal with him physically.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rant, buzzed and bored on the toilet tends to bring out paragraphs from me, especially when Wilt is involved :)</p>

      <label for="lkggmh3" class="commentText"><p>He literally wasn&rsquo;t allowed to. The NBA rules heavily favored defense at the time. It&rsquo;s why most wilt highlights are finger rolls and  floaters. Wilt had to get creative to circumvent the insane defensive rules.Also lowkey one of the players that got roughed up the most as a black man. The injury that led to his death was caused by Boston beating the shit out of him on defense. It&rsquo;s crazy because the juggernaut version we know of Wilt is a nerfed version.</p>

He already had heart problems at the time, but a dental surgery for an injury he suffered in the NBA (I think it was an elbow to his front teeth) caused him immense pain and stress the week before he passed which also could have contributed to his passing. I&rsquo;ll try to find a link to the original post I saw this on r/vintagenba it has a lot more context to the injury</p>

<p>I recall a version of the story in which it was intentionally caused by a white player as a form of retaliation somewhere in the early-to middle arc of his career.  It gave him problems for the rest of his life, evidently.</p>

<p>Anyway, the story is well-documented on Reddit, so shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to find. /u/BowserBuddy123</p>

Many people have the misconception that he played like Shaq and just dominated guys with his size. In actuality he was more of a finesse big that scored in the mid-range. Imagine a modern Wilt with today’s training and a 3-point shot. He would be a basketball god.</p>

Arnold has a clip of him with bill Simmons talking about lifting with Wilt when he was with the lakers, said wilt was a freak and could put up numbers comparable to the strongest guys at the gym.  So he probably was into weightlifting before he got to LA.  Some of that may be Arnold BSing, but Wilt was fucking huge during his laker days.  Guys biceps and shoulders were incredible</p>

One game he started on someone and Wilt just picked him up from behind with his hands on his waist, turned around and put him down. At 6&rsquo;9 people don&rsquo;t just pick you up let alone easily. It would be super unusual to feel.</p>

<p>When he put him down Wilt said &ldquo;We wont be doing that today&rdquo; or something similar assertively and the dude stammered &ldquo;Ye..Yes sir Mr Chamberlain&rdquo;. His team mates roasted him that Wilt put him all the way back into grade school.</p>

I don’t think people realize how much 500lbs is for bench, I was very serious into lifting for a while but 500lbs on bench is an incredible achievement, much less for someone who has a significant disadvantage due to his limb length.</p>

<p>But I do think he was absurdly strong, and I could see him benching in the 400 range.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also just obviously total BS. Wilt never had anything close to the physique needed for a 500lb bench. His long arms would further give him a massive disadvantage.</p>

<p>Hafthor Bjornsson is a lot shorter than Wilt with a far, far more massive build and maybe the greatest strongman ever. He can only bench 500lbs with a long run of dedicated training and a weight belt.</p>

<p>No way is Wilt significantly stronger than fucking Hafthor. Might as well just toss in that he was faster than Usain Bolt, a better swimmer than Michael Phelps and could throw a 105mph fastball. Honestly the internet would probably believe it.</p>

      <label for="lkd46om" class="commentText"><p>Wilt was super bitter about playing in a time when everything was stacked against a genetically gifted african american, and rightly so.</p>

<p>He would have had the fame and fortune like Mike if he was born 3 decades later. He had the body, he had the skill and he had the personality/charisma. He <strong>knew</strong> he was better than the majority of guys that came after him and I imagine it was frustrating to see &lsquo;less talented&rsquo; guys earn more than he ever did.</p>

<p>Just think what he&rsquo;d be like with modern day training, diet, equpiment, shoes, medical science&hellip; They used to practice outside on concrete half the time and travel the country on <a href="https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/grant_g_chamberlin11_64011.jpg?w=1003" target="_blank">stagecoaches</a>. I have been on many overnight rides in my lifetime and it takes it&rsquo;s toll on your body. I can&rsquo;t imagine what it&rsquo;s like for 7ft dude who plays basketball for a living.</p>

<p>I mean, it was the 60s and 70s. They had birth control pill since 1960, and nobody knew what STDs were - just that you randomly got a &ldquo;cold sore&rdquo; every now and then.</p>

<p>The idea that Wilt spent 20k nights each with a specific women is a stretch. But 5k nights with 4 women each, over a 20 year span (1960-79)? That&rsquo;s not such a stretch, it&rsquo;s around 60 instances per year.</p>

<p>Plus &ldquo;sex&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t require you to finish with each girl.</p>

<p>If you straight up compare him to someone like Hakeem, he doesn&rsquo;t have the footwork or technical skill and would most likely get clowned on like David Robinson did in the 1995 WCF.</p>

<p>However, I think it would be a different story if Wilt was born 3 decades later. This interview is from 1997. If Wilt was born in the 70&rsquo;s he&rsquo;d still most likely be an unstoppable force, especially with how physical it was in the 90&rsquo;s. I mean look at what Shaq got away with back then lol. The league was built for 7ft dudes who could run and post up.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The game being faster would make it more physically taxing, not less.</p>

<p>Not to mention having to play in Chucks, and fly commercial. Wilt wasn&rsquo;t getting any load management nights off, either.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like Wilt was a robot. He got tired too - he just had to play through it, instead of subbing out.</p>

<p>The game was less physical back then, but those rules were designed to stop Wilt, not help him. If Wilt were allowed to use his strength and lower his shoulder into defenders like players have been allowed to do since the 90s, he would&rsquo;ve scored even easier. Wilt shot those hooks and fadeaways because the rules forced him to, by calling offensive fouls anytime a ballhandler initiated contact.</p>

<p>I agree the Pace was faster and it produced stat inflation, but you can&rsquo;t say that having to run faster is easier than running slower.</p>

<p>You realize that it wasn&rsquo;t as physically taxing because the offensive player would be called for charges more easily right? A big guy like Wilt if he could be more physical that benefits HIM, not his defenders.</p>

      <label for="lkfecgs" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s because the NBA does a terrible job of replaying old footage, so fans don&rsquo;t get to appreciate the legends of the past. It&rsquo;s sad because our league is fairly young and we have the opportunity to appreciate and interact with these greats.</p>

<p>All these legacy talks would be so much more interesting if people were familiarized with the game of those they champion.</p>

      <label for="lkh6at2" class="commentText"><p>I mean compare the 9 years their careers overlapped 1960-69 throughout this period (before Wilt went to the lakers)</p>

<p>Bill Russel had the following teammates who made an all-nba team:</p>

<ol>
<li>John Havliceck</li>
<li>Sam Jones</li>
<li>Bob Cousy</li>
<li>Tom Heinsohn</li>
<li>Bill Sharman</li>
</ol>

<p>They all made multiple all-nba teams</p>

<p>Where Wilt literally had a guy who made all nba second team twice in Hal Greer.</p>

<p>I feel like with your logic you&rsquo;d Steph is greater than Lebron if he were to win one more which I totally disagree with.</p>

<p>Sure his time on the Lakers they should&rsquo;ve been winning championships and they really did choke in the 69&rsquo; season. But the numbers he put up just can&rsquo;t be looked past.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Did you miss the dribble he did during one of those clips well after his retirement?    He could dribble fine without looking at it  when he wasn&rsquo;t trying to abide by the super strict rules about hand placement while dribbling that they had in the 60s.</p>

<p>He looked goofy in the super old clips because dribbling a ball at full sprint with your hand on top dead center is ridiculously difficult, everyone looked silly dribbling back then, as would current players if you made them dribble with the same rules.</p>

In almost all clips he stares at the ball while dribbling and always with only his dominant hand. The rules were more strict on traveling but it&rsquo;s not like a skilled player couldn&rsquo;t sprint down court with a legal dribble lol.</p>

<p>Wilt&rsquo;s shot was also terrible. It doesn&rsquo;t look like he worked on his form or mechanics at all. He was a career 51% free throw shooter, which is worse than Shaq.</p>

<p>In the playoffs under pressure it got even worse, and Wilt shot 46% from the line. You just don&rsquo;t have a good shot if you&rsquo;re chucking bricks like that.</p>

      <label for="lkh6gin" class="commentText"><p>I mean, dribbling (unlike, say, shooting) is something you can just practice and get good at if you’re coordinated enough, which Wilt clearly was.</p>

<p>Bob Cousy had the best handles in the world in the 50s and if you watch footage of him he looks really bad as well. Completely incapable of a bunch of things that a good high school guard would almost certainly be capable of in 2024. Obviously that isn’t because he’s less naturally talented than a modern D2 benchwarmer, it’s because the game was less developed back then (and to some extent because the rules were different).</p>

<p>If Wilt had been born in 1998 he would’ve practiced like modern players practice and his handles would’ve been way, way better.</p>

<p>He probably still would’ve been a lousy shooter, though. 51% on free throws was always bad.</p>

<p>Bill Russell was out there ring hunting like Sauron. Russell had less impressive stats, but he was just as much of an athletic marvel as Wilt. The dude was an Olympic level high jumper, at some point, he was ranked seventh in the world. He was also an incredibly fast sprinter, and he used both of those skills to become the best defender of all time (in my opinion). Russell usually came out ahead because it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you score 50 when the rest of your team combines for 10.</p>

<p>Not exactly &ldquo;today,&rdquo; but probably the most similar is Tim Duncan. Wilt won 1 ring as the offense, and then won the other by sacrificing his entire offense to focus on defense, rebounding, and setting screens.</p>

<p>Duncan had a similar career arc - for his first rings, he was the center of the offense. For his later rings, he was willing to put aside his ego and let other guys take more shots.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a hard adjustment for most superstars - they&rsquo;ve spent their whole life being The Man, and many aren&rsquo;t able to put that aside in the name of team success.</p>

<p>For active players, maybe Jrue? He was never a Wilt or Duncan level star, but he was still an All-Star as recently as 2023, and capable of scoring ~20ppg. Instead, he&rsquo;s content being a 5th option defensive role player in BOS.</p>

<p>Obviously neither Duncan or Jrue have Wilt&rsquo;s athleticism, and Jrue has a positional difference as well.</p>

But Wilt was 7’1 and was also a champion high jumper and sprinter, which is insane. Imagine Shaq competing in the high jump. Plus he really filled out in his later years. Dude was built like a refrigerator. I’d love to see him battle it out with Shaq, Duncan, Hakeem, Giannis, etc. Plus he had such a soft shooting touch. Definitely think he would be dominant in any era.</p>

      <label for="lke676h" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t know the exact term(s) for what they did to these old clips (looks like they artificially increased the frame rate at the very least), but it really brings them to life. I mean, they look weird with all the distortion, but you never really get a sense of the smoothness of the players back in the day. So it&rsquo;s really neat to see!</p>
