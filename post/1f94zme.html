</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Before anyone yells “WEIGHT ROOM”, I used to be guilty of playing bully ball a lot when I was younger (particularly because I was an undersized 6’2” post player). The easiest way I can describe it is you essentially dip your shoulder a lot to create space and you’re basically playing like a charging bull. I think the best example is probably Demarcus Cousins when he used to do it a lot like in this link (around 0:44 is one example):</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/rVVaMEHmvAE?si=U-_3u_1QwF-VhFus" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/rVVaMEHmvAE?si=U-_3u_1QwF-VhFus</a></p>

<p>What do you guys think of this playing style? I have noticed that this style of play leads to many arguments and gets players heated/annoyed. If it was in the NBA it’s <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> times will be called a charge, but nobody will ever call it in pickup ball. I’ve since pivoted away from a bully ball style of play and more recently towards a finesse game due to my age and not wanting to hurt people on the court. Is this style of play frowned upon?</p>

      <label for="llj4b47" class="commentText"><p>When I see Embiid play as he is now it reminds me of how I used to play and it is frustrating and pisses me off that the NBA allows it. Not proud of it, I was known as Shaq on my local streetball court and went through a phase when I charged hard at everything. Big hard turns to my blindside, didn&rsquo;t care who was there. Charge right into the lane. Smash into the best offensive player on D while going for the ball, come what may. Limited offensive moves. So make no mistake about it. Embiid knows what he&rsquo;s doing. He knows people will be injured. He knows his skillset is limited and this is how he can win. He knows people will give way when he drives, think twice on their drives, etc. He will only be stopped by a stronger player and/or fearless players like Giannis, Gasol, Draymond, etc. Or by an obviously more skilled player with equal Type A like Ibaka. He didn&rsquo;t intend to injure, but he certainly intends to show you that he doesn&rsquo;t care if you get hurt when he rumbles into you. At least that&rsquo;s how I used to play. But that was streetball. Eventually I got more moves, played w better players, played real basketball w refs. There&rsquo;s no doubt in my mind the NBA has some kind of edict coming down, telling the refs to let him run amok.</p>

      <label for="llj5cfn" class="commentText"><p>I think Giannis is probably the best example of bully ball working recently. In general, its probably best as a counter option, like big wing who can punish putting smalls on him, but that&rsquo;s not the bread and butter. But if its your go to move, you&rsquo;ll probably end up with a lot of frustrating nights not getting calls. They reward grifters more than actual physical dominance.</p>

<p>As far as guards, Jrue plays bully ball when he’s not shooting a lot of 3s.</p>

      <label for="lljaal3" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s part of the game. Whatever works, works.</p>

<p>In the end, being big and powerful are just random physical traits, no different than being quick or having mad handles. We&rsquo;re all just using whatever tools God gave us.</p>

<p>I play bully ball and I always tell people the same thing: if I foul you, call it. That&rsquo;s what refs are for in the NBA.</p>

<p>It actually annoys me that the NBA changed so many rules to prevent this style of play, basically all because Shaq broke the league with it and it&rsquo;s not super marketable</p>

<p>Some dudes just want to squat down and then drop a shoulder and shoulder charge through the defender, then pause, then rise for an ugly layup attempt. </p>

<p>When that happens, it’s not bully ball, it’s just bad basketball. </p>
