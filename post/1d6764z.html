      <label for="l6qmqpf" class="commentText"><p>Zone defense with stretch bigs would have brought 2nd season MJ&rsquo;s scoring average down by quite a bit. Prime MJ would have been better for todays league because his jump shot developed by a considerable margin from his early seasons.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, if you put prime Steph in the 90s with a modern 2015&rsquo;s team surrounding him and you play 5 out. And then you have 90s rule set? Steph gonna look like an unstoppable monster. Steph gets a screen into a wide open lane, those defenders in the corner have to absolutely collapse to the rim, where they have to take 2-3 extra steps back then compared to today. Those 2-3 extra steps away from a defender in post 2001 rule set is what makes all the difference in the world. So in the 90&rsquo;s, instead, these dudes are going to have to go under the screen every time to catch Curry because they won&rsquo;t want to give up an open corner 3. This means Steph gets an easy pass to his screener, or a wide open 3 every single time after the adjustment.</p>

<p>Comparing 90&rsquo;s and earlier players to anyone post 2001 after that rule that allowed zone defense is absolutely pointless.</p>

He runs away from defenders and runs around screens off ball, where he IS grabbed. Steph&rsquo;s offense would actually look better back in the 90s because the only thing slowing Steph down today is help defense, defense that is allowed to float around away from their main people they are defending. Box and 1 zone defense, not allowed in the 90s. You can&rsquo;t do that in the 90s. Steph would score even more back then if he was given the ultimate green light of shooting 3s today.</p>

<p>Kenny&rsquo;s mentality is all fucked up and behind the times here. I&rsquo;m pretty sure most people understand by now that zone wasn&rsquo;t allowed in the 90&rsquo;s, which is a huge proponent of what slowed 2000&rsquo;s basketball down. Players now counter zone defense pretty well. This is not even mentioning how driving lanes being killed by zone defenders would affect MJ&rsquo;s ability to drive to the lane.</p>

      <label for="l6qojiv" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not just traditional zone defenses that weren&rsquo;t allowed either. Essentially any semi-advanced defensive coverage that is completely normal today was impossible once teams figured out how to abuse it.</p>

<p>You couldn&rsquo;t overload. You couldn&rsquo;t pre-rotate. You couldn&rsquo;t show a soft double. You couldn&rsquo;t sit in someone&rsquo;s driving gaps in the same ways you are allowed to today. If you put a blind 100 year old grandmother on the perimeter a defender would have to &ldquo;guard&rdquo; them. Charles Barkley could get the ball 1 on 1 and just back someone down for ages before the NBA realized that was boring and added the 5 second back to the Basket penalty. MJ could attack 1 on 1 in isolation consistently in a way he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to today.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just a completely different game to today. Like imagine if Kevin Durant played back then? He&rsquo;s had notable struggles in several series where teams overload to his side and play physical. In the 90s all he&rsquo;d have to do is get the ball in isolation on one side of the floor with his 4 teammates on the other side and he&rsquo;d get to cook one on one.</p>

<p>Thats why no one thinks John Stockton is the greatest passer ever despite his assist numbers. He could just spam pick and roll passes to Malone with no pre-rotation into the paint like you&rsquo;d see today because the Jazz would put the other 3 guys on the other side of the court.</p>

<p>This is the biggest reason imo why comparing players directly across eras is dumb. You have to contextualize us with how dominant they were in <em>their</em> era.</p>

      <label for="l6qk058" class="commentText"><p>This clip was infuriating, not cuz I agree with Dwight, but because they just use the &ldquo;back in my day&rdquo; argument. Sure, the game was more physical, but also there was no zone defense. Give us a real argument, like how lethal MJ was from mid-range or how his drives to the basket gave his teammates space.</p>

<p>I think there is a crumb of an argument that Steph might be the best offensive player ever, just because of how valuable his 3 point shooting actually is. It&rsquo;s not one I agree with, but I&rsquo;d at least like someone to engage with the argument properly.</p>

      <label for="l6qo9yx" class="commentText"><p>Why even compare eras? I would hope that today‚Äôs players are better than those of the past. Legends are just those who are ahead of their own eras.</p>

<p>MJ would get blitzed and doubled so often today. He‚Äôd kinda look like Ant did against the Mav‚Äôs scheme. Any post ups would get doubled. Today‚Äôs players are bigger, faster &amp; stronger on average too. BUT he‚Äôd adapt his game like any other great in their own eras.</p>

<p>That being said, steph‚Äôs touch, motor, and off-ball gravity is insane. Combine that with elite handles, playmaking &amp; finishing and he is easily one of the best offensive players in history. I‚Äôd argue only the likes of prime Jokic, Lebron, Luka and KD rival him. Hard to compare when MJ played in a different era with different needs. I have no doubt MJ would excel too but i‚Äôd like to see the modern version of prime MJ against current defences.</p>

<p>Handchecking is a weird rule to talk about since i still see it happening. Regardless pre and post rule change top scorers‚Äô scoring literally deproved so idk what hand checking actually does.</p>

I think the whole point of Steph‚Äôs 2016 is that it can‚Äôt be replicated. MJ‚Äôs scoring was a product of volume. He was putting up 25-28 shots a game in his highest scoring seasons. Wilt, MJ, Kobe‚Ä¶everyone can do that. No player will ever average 30+ while shooting 50/45/91. Nor will anyone hit 400 threes. Harden tried and put up 1000+ threes to hit 378. There‚Äôs a lot of volume scorers in history. Steph‚Äôs 2016 is just a level of scoring efficiency that no one will ever touch again. His career 2p/3p/ft is 52/43/91. He would be a career 50/40/90 shooter if he didn‚Äôt shoot so many threes. They significantly skew his fg percentage down. You know how insane it is to shoot 50% from the field while putting up 886 threes and hitting 402 of them? Yall gotta stop sleeping on 2016 man. Steph hate is out of hand. We know MJ is the goat, no one is saying otherwise.</p>

      <label for="l6qnb16" class="commentText"><p>But&hellip; that season is how Jordan played his entire career. So many of us were like, this is what MJ did for years on end. Obviously not the 400 threes, but the relentless scoring and doing nothing but winning games.</p>

<p>But I would say that&rsquo;s either 91 or 92 Jordan.</p>

<p>91 Jordan 31/6/6 with 3 steals a game, 54% shooting. 61 wins, MVP, Championship, Finals MVP, 15-2 playoff record.</p>

<p>Playoff average was 31/6/8 with 2 steals and 1.5 blocks, 52% shooting</p>

<p>92 Jordan - 30/6/6  2 steals 52% shooting, 67 wins, MVP, Championship, Finals MVP</p>

<p>Playoff average was 35/6/6 2 steals 50% shooting</p>

<p>You won&rsquo;t find better individual years than these. Like Curry went back to playing like his regular self in the playoffs that year, he couldn&rsquo;t carry that momentum into the playoffs. Where as Jordan got even more insane.</p>

      <label for="l6qp8bg" class="commentText"><p>That‚Äôs exactly what I said though. Career wise they don‚Äôt compare, just 2016 Steph is the best if not one of the best peaks of all time. To be fair to Steph, his 2016 playoff run was injury riddled. We didn‚Äôt see a healthy Steph in those playoffs. Obviously MJ is the better career player. But the first and only 30 ppg 50/40/90 season, 402 threes at 45% when no one had ever even hit 300 before that, steals leader, 73 wins, and being in the running for mip as a defending mvp is insane. Surprised so many people are disagreeing. Steph slander in 2024 is such a yawn. Predictably it‚Äôs a lot of Lakers flairs and LeBron fans that are disagreeing. Can we not just appreciate one player without tearing down the rest? It‚Äôs literally not a knock on any other player to say the only unanimous mvp in history was also potentially the best single season peak. Y‚Äôall getting way too flustered about a pretty casual and common opinion.</p>

I would say Curry&rsquo;s 2016 season is one of the best MVP seasons all time for sure, it&rsquo;s the best outside of Jordan MVPs IMO.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It just wasn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m sorry, but he played just fine v Portland and OKC. Shit the bed in the Finals and they still went up 3-1. They just needed one MVP Curry game after that and he couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>

<p>Where did I tear down Curry at all? Show me please. Just because you didn&rsquo;t take MJ from 87-93 into account, doesn&rsquo;t mean the rest of us don&rsquo;t. I literally compared that season to MJ and said that was what Jordan did.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs literally not a knock on any other player to say the only unanimous mvp in history was also potentially the best single season peak</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s fucking hilarious seeing you say this, when you literally said that saying other guys have had better seasons is a knock on Curry and is Curry slander. Clown take for sure.</p>

<p>Curry is awesome, he&rsquo;s probably my 5th favourite player ever. But overall, not the greatest individual season, just a great regular season and arguably the best MVP season (outside of Jordan&rsquo;s)</p>

      <label for="l6qncs7" class="commentText"><p>He has an argument but you cant say that no one comes close, and if you include playoffs then &lsquo;16 Curry honestly has no argument at all.</p>

<p>&lsquo;89 Jordan averaged 32/8/8 on 61% TS and in the playoffs he averaged 35/7/8 on 60% TS and went out in the ECF where he gave the champions their only two losses of the playoffs.</p>

<p>Compared to &lsquo;16 Curry with 30/5/7 on 67% TS and in the playoffs 25/5/5 on 60% TS and went out in the finals where he choked a 3-1 lead.</p>

<p>He only has an argument if you exclude the playoffs which I dont think is reasonable to do.</p>

Who do you think had a single season peak better than Steph‚Äôs 2016? I‚Äôm all for discourse but resorting to hating and tearing down a player for really his one and only career downfall over 15 years isn‚Äôt a disagreement nor intelligent discussion. If you think someone had a better season, let‚Äôs hear it.</p>
