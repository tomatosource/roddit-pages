      <label for="l6qku2n" class="commentText"><p>Why would holding Steph&rsquo;s backside even matter? He doesn&rsquo;t back players down. He runs away from defenders and runs around screens off ball, where he IS grabbed. Steph&rsquo;s offense would actually look better back in the 90s because the only thing slowing Steph down today is help defense, defense that is allowed to float around away from their main people they are defending. Box and 1 zone defense, not allowed in the 90s. You can&rsquo;t do that in the 90s. Steph would score even more back then if he was given the ultimate green light of shooting 3s today.</p>

<p>Kenny&rsquo;s mentality is all fucked up and behind the times here. I&rsquo;m pretty sure most people understand by now that zone wasn&rsquo;t allowed in the 90&rsquo;s, which is a huge proponent of what slowed 2000&rsquo;s basketball down. Players now counter zone defense pretty well. This is not even mentioning how driving lanes being killed by zone defenders would affect MJ&rsquo;s ability to drive to the lane.</p>

      <label for="l6qojiv" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not just traditional zone defenses that weren&rsquo;t allowed either. Essentially any semi-advanced defensive coverage that is completely normal today was impossible once teams figured out how to abuse it.</p>

<p>You couldn&rsquo;t overload. You couldn&rsquo;t pre-rotate. You couldn&rsquo;t show a soft double. You couldn&rsquo;t sit in someone&rsquo;s driving gaps in the same ways you are allowed to today. If you put a blind 100 year old grandmother on the perimeter a defender would have to &ldquo;guard&rdquo; them. Charles Barkley could get the ball 1 on 1 and just back someone down for ages before the NBA realized that was boring and added the 5 second back to the Basket penalty. MJ could attack 1 on 1 in isolation consistently in a way he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to today.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just a completely different game to today. Like imagine if Kevin Durant played back then? He&rsquo;s had notable struggles in several series where teams overload to his side and play physical. In the 90s all he&rsquo;d have to do is get the ball in isolation on one side of the floor with his 4 teammates on the other side and he&rsquo;d get to cook one on one.</p>

<p>Thats why no one thinks John Stockton is the greatest passer ever despite his assist numbers. He could just spam pick and roll passes to Malone with no pre-rotation into the paint like you&rsquo;d see today because the Jazz would put the other 3 guys on the other side of the court.</p>

<p>This is the biggest reason imo why comparing players directly across eras is dumb. You have to contextualize us with how dominant they were in <em>their</em> era.</p>

<p>people say this but it&rsquo;s just not true. it&rsquo;s entirely up to the refs to enforce it so teams still did it. just like how traveling, carrying, flopping and moving screens are supposedly illegal today yet teams do it all the time</p>

<p><a href="https://streamable.com/07cckx" target="_blank">like this is textbook illegal defense</a> but if refs aren&rsquo;t calling it, it&rsquo;s not illegal</p>

<ol>
<li><p>fair on that being uncalled illegal defense, but it’s also absolutely dogshit illegal defense where the help defender isn’t actually doing much to make the ball handler uncomfortable to drive.</p></li>

<li><p>can’t the same thing be said about handchecking today? Especially in the playoffs guys are grabbed on drives all the time and there’s handchecking on nearly every possession. If they actually called all the times Steph is grabbed when running off ball he’d average 30 FTs a games. Yea there’s also more illegal screens nowadays too, but that just goes along with the point that it’s not that the game is less physical now, the physicality is just different now.</p></li>

<p>This suggest hand checking was detremental to 3pt shot which means Steph would likely have been a worse player in that era. There is nothing to show a significant impact on 2pt FGA or FG%…which suggest Jordan would likely have been a similar player.</p>

<p>Interesting note, Jordan never shot more than 3.5 3pt FGA per game in his career and shot fewer than 2 3ptFGA for all but 2 seasons of his career.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Kenny Smith is talking shit.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Lmao you might want to Google &ldquo;shortened three point line NBA&rdquo;.  Bringing in the three point line by almost 2&rsquo; to increase scoring is what caused the three point attempts and % to skyrocket, it had absolutely nothing to do with hand checking.</p>

<p>You can see it is the cause because attempts dropped massively and % went down once they reverted to the original distance a few years later.  If hand checking was the root cause those numbers never would have plummeted like they did.</p>

Especially someone so obsessed with winning like MJ.  Like, you actually think with added emphasis on 3&rsquo;s, he wouldn&rsquo;t have become an adequate 3 point shooter in today&rsquo;s game?  Someone with his pure stroke?  When players like Jason Kidd turn from 30% to 40% as the shift happened?</p>

<p>And again, you actually think with the added spacing a modern team would provide him, MJ wouldn&rsquo;t have learned to crush today&rsquo;s defenses?  That&rsquo;s really nothing to think about?  He even averaged 8 assists in a season when he was the hyperathletic version.    Yeah okay dipshit.  I do forget most of you are 15 and only realize now is good.  Some of you kids probably don&rsquo;t even know how good Lebron&rsquo;s actual prime was, balls hadn&rsquo;t dropped yet</p>

Sure, the game was more physical, but also there was no zone defense. Give us a real argument, like how lethal MJ was from mid-range or how his drives to the basket gave his teammates space.</p>

<p>I think there is a crumb of an argument that Steph might be the best offensive player ever, just because of how valuable his 3 point shooting actually is. It&rsquo;s not one I agree with, but I&rsquo;d at least like someone to engage with the argument properly.</p>

      <label for="l6qrbbu" class="commentText"><p>Basing this discussion on peak PPG is kinda dumb. Jordan&rsquo;s offensive game got better as his PPG went down, 30 ppg 1992 Jordan was a better offensive player than 37 ppg 1987 Jordan. (Also both were better than Wilt who averaged 50, which is where these stat discussions inevitably go.)</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re at that level most of your impact comes from how you run your team&rsquo;s offense - trying to go superman and score every point you can isn&rsquo;t as impactful as breaking down defenses to create efficient shots for you and your team.</p>

<p>These kinds of cross-era comparisons are always kinda pointless, but if you&rsquo;re going to try to talk about how good an offensive player is just pointing to their PPG is the wrong way to have that discussion.</p>

      <label for="l6qv043" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a nice, usually fine notion.  Except in the playoffs, it often is on your best player to go nuts when defenses tighten up.  Steph himself going &lsquo;superman&rsquo; in game 5 vs Boston is the reason they won the chip.  LeBron, many cases even as he is a naturally great distributor.  Shaq, same shit and yes his peak was on this level and no, no one judged him for &lsquo;getting shots for his team&rsquo;</p>

<p>MJ was a purely dominant scorer.  It was the most efficient play.  He did run an offense more as he got better teammates but again, the team&rsquo;s most efficient play was usually him aggressively scoring</p>

      <label for="l6rpkhf" class="commentText"><p>Purely dominant scorer makes it sound like he was Melo. Jordan had a great impact on offense because  of all of the attention he got, particularly when he was driving. This created tons of opportunities and space for his teammates, even if his number of assists weren&rsquo;t crazy. If all he did was score he wouldn&rsquo;t have nearly as great of an impact on offense as he had.</p>

      <label for="l6r5get" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s always telling that nobody ever mentions some of Curry&rsquo;s greatest offensive weapons in these discussions. His movement off ball and his gravity. The fact that teams would commit defensive mistakes and leave a generational scorer like KD open for shots and even dunks because of the havoc Steph without the ball would cause. </p>

<p>Nobody has ever been more valuable without touching the ball than Steph Curry. If Curry was a defensive juggernaut like MJ was, able to defend at a DPOY level, they would have won the title in &lsquo;16 and &lsquo;19 and he&rsquo;d a very similar resume to MJ. The gap between them as players comes almost exclusively from the other end. </p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a difference between a guranteed 4-8 points a night on 80% fg because Curry has ran between our defenders, one has taken a split second to see if they need to switch on to Curry while their man (Wiggins/KD) has taken 2 strides to the basket and they&rsquo;ll be no meaningful contest at the rim because the Warriors centre is out on the perimeter with the ball in his hands matched up with the opposition centre. </p>

<p> As opposed to MJ being a walking 30 points every single night but there being a massive variance whether that takes 15-25 shots on a given night. I&rsquo;d rather have the guranteed 5 points a night and the more efficient 30ppg scorer than just the 38ppg scorer.</p>

      <label for="l6qmqpf" class="commentText"><p>Zone defense with stretch bigs would have brought 2nd season MJ&rsquo;s scoring average down by quite a bit. Prime MJ would have been better for todays league because his jump shot developed by a considerable margin from his early seasons.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, if you put prime Steph in the 90s with a modern 2015&rsquo;s team surrounding him and you play 5 out. And then you have 90s rule set? Steph gonna look like an unstoppable monster. Steph gets a screen into a wide open lane, those defenders in the corner have to absolutely collapse to the rim, where they have to take 2-3 extra steps back then compared to today. Those 2-3 extra steps away from a defender in post 2001 rule set is what makes all the difference in the world. So in the 90&rsquo;s, instead, these dudes are going to have to go under the screen every time to catch Curry because they won&rsquo;t want to give up an open corner 3. This means Steph gets an easy pass to his screener, or a wide open 3 every single time after the adjustment.</p>

<p>Comparing 90&rsquo;s and earlier players to anyone post 2001 after that rule that allowed zone defense is absolutely pointless.</p>

<p>Everyone knows MJ is a better scorer than Steph. What makes Steph so unique and special, as that everyone on his entire team consistently gets easier shots through defenses being forced to sell out.</p>

<p>In MJ&rsquo;s era if he beat his man, a defender from the corner wasnt even allowed to hedge into the driving space to deter it, its a completely different sport.</p>

They were not allowed to actualy handcheck even in Jordans era. Or they were, just about as much as today. Just because a rule isnt written does not mean it is jot encorced and vice versa. Jordan got just about every call a player could want. And miss me with this &ldquo;he would score 40 in this era&rdquo;. He would get dubbled every single time if he was over 35ppg. He actualy played in the era that made iso scoring the easiest with no zone allowed and players having to stick to their men.</p>

<p>I am not even saying steph is a better offensive player, that is hard to compare, this nostalgia bullshit is just so pathetic to me at this point.</p>

The physicality does matter because Stephen relies on picks (double picks) and him running around like Reggie Miller. Step needs a good system and good passers (Draymond) to be effective.  MJ just told his team, give me the ball and get the hell out of the way.</p>

      <label for="l6rimh7" class="commentText"><p>I think people dont understand that the only way to consistently stop Curry is by using zone defense specially the box and 1, where 1 guy face guards Steph all game and ignores the rest of the actions while the entire team rotates to makes Steph passing and driving lanes hell. That defense is not possible in the 90s, they were not allowed to leave their man and soft double. If Steph was allowed to play in isolation all game, he would absolutely demolish everyone. Imagine he calls a PnR gets a switch on the center and you arent even allowed to help off your man to cover a driving gap.</p>

The Warriors were 8.1 better than league average offensive rating while the Bulls were 7.7, which is a pretty decent gap. MJ is a better scorer by far, but the argument is offensive player, which encompases playmaking and making your team&rsquo;s offense the best it can be.</p>

In fact, the Pistons &ldquo;Jordan rules&rdquo; scheme would not even be possible without abusing illegal defense rules. They had help defenders ready at whatever spot he tried to get to.</p>

      <label for="l6qnb16" class="commentText"><p>But&hellip; that season is how Jordan played his entire career. So many of us were like, this is what MJ did for years on end. Obviously not the 400 threes, but the relentless scoring and doing nothing but winning games.</p>

<p>But I would say that&rsquo;s either 91 or 92 Jordan.</p>

<p>91 Jordan 31/6/6 with 3 steals a game, 54% shooting. 61 wins, MVP, Championship, Finals MVP, 15-2 playoff record.</p>

<p>Playoff average was 31/6/8 with 2 steals and 1.5 blocks, 52% shooting</p>

<p>92 Jordan - 30/6/6  2 steals 52% shooting, 67 wins, MVP, Championship, Finals MVP</p>

<p>Playoff average was 35/6/6 2 steals 50% shooting</p>

<p>You won&rsquo;t find better individual years than these. Like Curry went back to playing like his regular self in the playoffs that year, he couldn&rsquo;t carry that momentum into the playoffs. Where as Jordan got even more insane.</p>

      <label for="l6qp8bg" class="commentText"><p>That’s exactly what I said though. Career wise they don’t compare, just 2016 Steph is the best if not one of the best peaks of all time. To be fair to Steph, his 2016 playoff run was injury riddled. We didn’t see a healthy Steph in those playoffs. Obviously MJ is the better career player. But the first and only 30 ppg 50/40/90 season, 402 threes at 45% when no one had ever even hit 300 before that, steals leader, 73 wins, and being in the running for mip as a defending mvp is insane. Surprised so many people are disagreeing. Steph slander in 2024 is such a yawn. Predictably it’s a lot of Lakers flairs and LeBron fans that are disagreeing. Can we not just appreciate one player without tearing down the rest? It’s literally not a knock on any other player to say the only unanimous mvp in history was also potentially the best single season peak. Y’all getting way too flustered about a pretty casual and common opinion.</p>

      <label for="l6qpo10" class="commentText"><p>We disagree, because there&rsquo;s better seasons and they did it in the playoffs on top of their crazy regular season. I would say Curry&rsquo;s 2016 season is one of the best MVP seasons all time for sure, it&rsquo;s the best outside of Jordan MVPs IMO.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It just wasn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m sorry, but he played just fine v Portland and OKC. Shit the bed in the Finals and they still went up 3-1. They just needed one MVP Curry game after that and he couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>

<p>Where did I tear down Curry at all? Show me please. Just because you didn&rsquo;t take MJ from 87-93 into account, doesn&rsquo;t mean the rest of us don&rsquo;t. I literally compared that season to MJ and said that was what Jordan did.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s fucking hilarious seeing you say this, when you literally said that saying other guys have had better seasons is a knock on Curry and is Curry slander. Clown take for sure.</p>

<p>Curry is awesome, he&rsquo;s probably my 5th favourite player ever. But overall, not the greatest individual season, just a great regular season and arguably the best MVP season (outside of Jordan&rsquo;s)</p>

<p>&lsquo;89 Jordan averaged 32/8/8 on 61% TS and in the playoffs he averaged 35/7/8 on 60% TS and went out in the ECF where he gave the champions their only two losses of the playoffs.</p>

<p>Compared to &lsquo;16 Curry with 30/5/7 on 67% TS and in the playoffs 25/5/5 on 60% TS and went out in the finals where he choked a 3-1 lead.</p>

<p>He only has an argument if you exclude the playoffs which I dont think is reasonable to do.</p>

The only 30ppg 50/40/90 season ever. 30.1 ppg on 50.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>45</sub>.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>90</sub>.8 shooting. 402 threes at 45% when no one had ever even hit 300 before. I think 2021 Steph is the best he’s ever been all things considered, but 2016 Steph is his best statistical season and one of the best seasons of all time</p>

      <label for="l6qq1e9" class="commentText"><p>Okay if we’re just gonna focus on points alone without context or efficiency or really anything else mattering then we got to Wilt who averaged 50, and 45, and like 39, and 30+ a few more times. I think the whole point of Steph’s 2016 is that it can’t be replicated. MJ’s scoring was a product of volume. He was putting up 25-28 shots a game in his highest scoring seasons. Wilt, MJ, Kobe…everyone can do that. No player will ever average 30+ while shooting 50/45/91. Nor will anyone hit 400 threes. Harden tried and put up 1000+ threes to hit 378. There’s a lot of volume scorers in history. Steph’s 2016 is just a level of scoring efficiency that no one will ever touch again. His career 2p/3p/ft is 52/43/91. He would be a career 50/40/90 shooter if he didn’t shoot so many threes. They significantly skew his fg percentage down. You know how insane it is to shoot 50% from the field while putting up 886 threes and hitting 402 of them? Yall gotta stop sleeping on 2016 man. Steph hate is out of hand. We know MJ is the goat, no one is saying otherwise.</p>

      <label for="l6qqkn9" class="commentText"><p>I get what you’re saying but MJ still averaged more points per game and the 3 point shot really wasn’t even an option. Steph, according to you, hit 400 3’s and still didn’t average MJ numbers.</p>

<p>Shit, put this in perspective, Steph is the all time 3 point leader and still doesn’t average MJ’s career point average.</p>

Who do you think had a single season peak better than Steph’s 2016? I’m all for discourse but resorting to hating and tearing down a player for really his one and only career downfall over 15 years isn’t a disagreement nor intelligent discussion. If you think someone had a better season, let’s hear it.</p>
