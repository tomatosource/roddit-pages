      <label for="l6gfihq" class="commentText"><p>We had to put our dog down a couple weeks ago due to cancer. It was the hardest thing I&rsquo;ve ever had to do. They sedate first, then give a second shot that stops their heart. There&rsquo;s 15 minutes between shots to make sure the sedation works, and the vet said that hearing is the last thing that goes. So once they gave him the first shot I just sat there, petting him, talking to him about how he was a good boy, everything would be better soon, just anything I could think of to keep him calm. I kept going even after I saw his heart stop, just in case, until the vet had to stop me.</p>

<p>This post has me bawling, but it&rsquo;s good to cry. Let it out, y&rsquo;all.</p>

      <label for="l6fzxr7" class="commentText"><p>Before my BIL passed away last Saturday, he was in a coma for a few days. We would take turns sitting with him talking about good times we shared, how much we loved him, etc. just in case he could hear us. My sister, BIL and nephew had a tradition where every night they would count down from ten and yell, &ldquo;goooodnight family!&rdquo; One of our last nights with him we were all together as a family so we did the goodnight countdown and when we got to &ldquo;family&rdquo; his mouth moved like he was saying it.   I like to think that was our sign he was still with us until the end and didn&rsquo;t pass without knowing how loved he was.</p>

      <label for="l6fzqk8" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s true, I was in a coma and then in and out of consciousness for approx 6 weeks. I knew what was going on around me, even though sometimes it took me an hour or two to figure what was real and what was imagined. I heard the nurses gossip, my mother and father visiting, and everything around me. When they put ice around me during a fever I was hallucinating that I was elsewhere when suddenly I was surrounded by bags of ice etc. I still vividly remember much of this three years later.</p>

      <label for="l6g0z6d" class="commentText"><p>I was in a coma for a week after a crossbow to my head. It was instant, didn&rsquo;t remember anything from when I was out. But the weird thing was? Nobody knew I was in a coma. My body was still moving, and even writing on a whiteboard. Only wrote &ldquo;H2O&rdquo; from what the nurse told me, but since i had an IV and a tube going down my throat they couldn&rsquo;t give me any water. The other weird thing about it, when i woke up I was hearing a voice in my head. One of the nurses later told me that it was an internal monologue and that in some cases of TBI people can gain/lose it. All this combined with the fact that i wasnt able to find a single case of another human living through a crossbow to the head and not becoming a vegetable and i gotta say I am the luckiest person i know. Like come on that&rsquo;s freaking metal!!! 😂</p>

Interestingly I was often on fire. I didn&rsquo;t hear a damn thing people were saying to me in real life.</p>

<p>When I woke up I told everyone my dad was dead and asked where my Australian family where. I hadn&rsquo;t seen my mum or brother in years.</p>

<p>Turns out I was only in the coma for a week. My dad died 2 months later.</p>

<p>Absolute worse thing I have ever been through in every conceivable way.</p>

      <label for="l6gau2r" class="commentText"><p>I think it really depends on how strong of a coma you are in. I was in an induced coma for three days. The initial aneasthesia had a relatively high dosage to knock me out. Apparently they would normally lower it so that you can cooperate a bit while being in a coma, like turning around in bed, etc. However as soon as they lowered a bit the aneasthetics I started pulling out my intubation, severely roughing up my throat.. so they had to keep the dose quite high to keep me in the coma.</p>

<p>When I woke up, it was as if I was from one place (my last memory) to another in seconds&hellip; while it had been three days.</p>

I didn&rsquo;t hear her thoug., I do have some memories from the coma or from the state after the coma but before consciousness came back fully. I thought I was doing some new dope with these weird light creatures in Moscow(I&rsquo;m from Finland and never been there but I have been to Russia) that could dive through the pavement and rise where ever they wanted. I thought I was in sauna with a famous finnish actor who&rsquo;s been dead for ages he had a whole back tattoo of Lenin and Stalin which felt weird since he is from the town that was home for Finnish anti-communist movement.</p>

<p>We always encourage families to be there and talk. Even when family isn&rsquo;t there I always tried to find their favorite music and play it.</p>

<p>Thank your hospice nurses and palliative doctors people.</p>

I finally stopped when my dad mentioned she must feel annoyed that I don’t get to the point faster (as I usually tend to talk a lot and she would always tell me to get to the point) so I started laughing instead and I could swear she squeezed my hand just a little as I was giggling about my dads comment ❤️ she took her last breath shortly after I got to the point “I love you and see you later”</p>

I laid there completely passed out ‘comatose’ and I could hear them talk about me needing brain surgery. When I slipped into death it was BLACK. I had zero sense of time and there was no angels coming for me. I just wasn’t there and then I was. But in my experience, and I’m sorry Christian’s, etc but there isn’t an after life. What I can tell you is that in a coma, at least for me, I could hear EVERYTHING.</p>

In a way, I&rsquo;m thankful to have this post recommended to me so that when the inevitable time comes, I can say some assuring words to that family member. Of course, I&rsquo;m not looking forward to that day and I&rsquo;d still be kind and nice to them while they&rsquo;re still here but at least now I know that hearing still persists a little bit after death.</p>

Since I usually went to bed later, when I was on my way to end the day I&rsquo;d stop into his room and whisper all kinds of thing. Usually I would say how much I love him, how proud I am, how smart and kind he is, that he is a great kid and fun to be around. I kinda hoped his subconscious would hold onto those things and just stow them away.</p>
