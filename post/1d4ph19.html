      <label for="l6gfihq" class="commentText"><p>We had to put our dog down a couple weeks ago due to cancer. It was the hardest thing I&rsquo;ve ever had to do. They sedate first, then give a second shot that stops their heart. There&rsquo;s 15 minutes between shots to make sure the sedation works, and the vet said that hearing is the last thing that goes. So once they gave him the first shot I just sat there, petting him, talking to him about how he was a good boy, everything would be better soon, just anything I could think of to keep him calm. I kept going even after I saw his heart stop, just in case, until the vet had to stop me.</p>

<p>This post has me bawling, but it&rsquo;s good to cry. Let it out, y&rsquo;all.</p>

      <label for="l6gj004" class="commentText"><p>I had my cat Norm for 15 years. Every day when I came home from work, he’d be sitting at the top of my stairs at home, blocking my path.</p>

<p>I’d pat him on the head and say “Hey Norm.” And he’d meow back at me.</p>

<p>Every day.</p>

<p>Then he got sick. It came on suddenly and he lost about half of his body weight in a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>He became so lethargic and it became so difficult for him to move one day and I had to have him put down.</p>

<p>When they gave him the sedative, it’s like he was my cat again for a few minutes. All of his pain vanished and he just wanted to play and explore.</p>

<p>The shot eventually kicked it, and he was ready for the next one. He held on for a while, even the vet said that he might have to administer another shot.</p>

<p>Then I gave him one last “Hey Norm,” he meowed quietly and he finally let go.</p>

<p>I’m bawling right now trying to type this, but I’ll forever be grateful for whatever gave me a few more minutes with my cat before I lost him.</p>

My dog actually sat up and reached for me to cuddle him closer.  I&rsquo;ve never hugged something so precious , with tears flooding his coat&hellip;.telling him over and over that I was truly blessed to have had the best dog on earth.<br>
I loved him from the day he was born, until the day the cancer finally ate him away.<br>
The purest love of all.  He didn&rsquo;t care how ugly I was, how late I was, how anything negative I was.  I was his best friend no matter my faults.  You don&rsquo;t get purer love than that.</p>

      <label for="l6gl22w" class="commentText"><p>Same here.  But 5 years ago my mom started alluding to needing help at home.  So I thought it over and moved in with them.  Dad is 88 and in poor health, mom is going effectively blind, and the stress of dad being in the hospital for the last few months has caused her and me a lot of stress.  That said I&rsquo;m glad to be here and will fight until I can&rsquo;t to keep them in their home so they can pass with dignity in THEIR home.</p>

<p>Very glad I have a WFH job that I enjoy and are understanding when I have to take time off for my dad.</p>

      <label for="l6fzxr7" class="commentText"><p>Before my BIL passed away last Saturday, he was in a coma for a few days. We would take turns sitting with him talking about good times we shared, how much we loved him, etc. just in case he could hear us. My sister, BIL and nephew had a tradition where every night they would count down from ten and yell, &ldquo;goooodnight family!&rdquo; One of our last nights with him we were all together as a family so we did the goodnight countdown and when we got to &ldquo;family&rdquo; his mouth moved like he was saying it.   I like to think that was our sign he was still with us until the end and didn&rsquo;t pass without knowing how loved he was.</p>

In a lot of patients, hearing is the last sense to go, so it’s probable that he did hear you and was comforted by his loved ones voices. It means everything to know you’re not alone and that you matter so much to so many people. You did the right thing. Your nephew will now need that support to know he matters and that he’s loved too.

      <label for="l6fzqk8" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s true, I was in a coma and then in and out of consciousness for approx 6 weeks. I knew what was going on around me, even though sometimes it took me an hour or two to figure what was real and what was imagined. I heard the nurses gossip, my mother and father visiting, and everything around me. When they put ice around me during a fever I was hallucinating that I was elsewhere when suddenly I was surrounded by bags of ice etc. I still vividly remember much of this three years later.</p>

      <label for="l6g0z6d" class="commentText"><p>I was in a coma for a week after a crossbow to my head. It was instant, didn&rsquo;t remember anything from when I was out. But the weird thing was? Nobody knew I was in a coma. My body was still moving, and even writing on a whiteboard. Only wrote &ldquo;H2O&rdquo; from what the nurse told me, but since i had an IV and a tube going down my throat they couldn&rsquo;t give me any water. The other weird thing about it, when i woke up I was hearing a voice in my head. One of the nurses later told me that it was an internal monologue and that in some cases of TBI people can gain/lose it. All this combined with the fact that i wasnt able to find a single case of another human living through a crossbow to the head and not becoming a vegetable and i gotta say I am the luckiest person i know. Like come on that&rsquo;s freaking metal!!! 😂</p>

Interestingly I was often on fire. I didn&rsquo;t hear a damn thing people were saying to me in real life.</p>

<p>When I woke up I told everyone my dad was dead and asked where my Australian family where. I hadn&rsquo;t seen my mum or brother in years.</p>

<p>Turns out I was only in the coma for a week. My dad died 2 months later.</p>

<p>Absolute worse thing I have ever been through in every conceivable way.</p>

I didn&rsquo;t hear her thoug., I do have some memories from the coma or from the state after the coma but before consciousness came back fully. I thought I was doing some new dope with these weird light creatures in Moscow(I&rsquo;m from Finland and never been there but I have been to Russia) that could dive through the pavement and rise where ever they wanted. I thought I was in sauna with a famous finnish actor who&rsquo;s been dead for ages he had a whole back tattoo of Lenin and Stalin which felt weird since he is from the town that was home for Finnish anti-communist movement.</p>

I&rsquo;m still forever thankful to the nurses who recognized that it was the bump in energy before she passed so I spent hours getting as many stories and recipes out of her as I could.</p>

<p>She was amazing when I left her Friday night. She never woke up after Saturday morning. 12;14AM Monday morning, she was gone. I held her hand and talked to her until my throat was sore and my voice was hoarse. I thanked her for 16 years of taking care of me, of being the best mom and Nanny any child could ever ask for.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know when she was no longer able to hear but I hope she heard at least one of my &ldquo;I love you&rdquo;s. 21 years later, I still hope she hears me telling her I love her.</p>

      <label for="l6gau2r" class="commentText"><p>I think it really depends on how strong of a coma you are in. I was in an induced coma for three days. The initial aneasthesia had a relatively high dosage to knock me out. Apparently they would normally lower it so that you can cooperate a bit while being in a coma, like turning around in bed, etc. However as soon as they lowered a bit the aneasthetics I started pulling out my intubation, severely roughing up my throat.. so they had to keep the dose quite high to keep me in the coma.</p>

<p>When I woke up, it was as if I was from one place (my last memory) to another in seconds&hellip; while it had been three days.</p>

<p>While he was intubated, I spoke to him, prayed, cried, and did everything I possibly could because we knew he&rsquo;d suffered too much ( septic shock after terminal idiopathic fibrosis of the lungs ) and that he might not make it back alive</p>

<p>Reading this made me pensive, and I vicariously felt a sense of relief</p>

I had zero sense of time and there was no angels coming for me. I just wasn’t there and then I was. But in my experience, and I’m sorry Christian’s, etc but there isn’t an after life.

In a way, I&rsquo;m thankful to have this post recommended to me so that when the inevitable time comes, I can say some assuring words to that family member. Of course, I&rsquo;m not looking forward to that day and I&rsquo;d still be kind and nice to them while they&rsquo;re still here but at least now I know that hearing still persists a little bit after death.</p>

Since I usually went to bed later, when I was on my way to end the day I&rsquo;d stop into his room and whisper all kinds of thing. Usually I would say how much I love him, how proud I am, how smart and kind he is, that he is a great kid and fun to be around. I kinda hoped his subconscious would hold onto those things and just stow them away.</p>

Anyway, there was a doctor that was talking about this teenage girl that was in a car crash I think. It was pretty bad and she needed to be put into a medically induced coma. But during that time the doctor would come in and check on her and talk to her even though the girl was still in a coma. And the doctor never met the girl while she was awake. Well, like a year later this girl had recovered and was back at the hospital for some sort of check-up or something. The girl heard the doctor talking in the hallway and was like &ldquo;hey Dr. so-and-so, how&rsquo;s it going?&rdquo; The doctor was like, how do you know who I am? And the girl said she could hear the doctors voice when she was in a coma and she recognized her voice in the hallway. It gives me chills just thinking about that story.</p>

      <label for="l6ghyap" class="commentText"><p>As my mum was dying I pleaded with the nurse to lower her medication so I could speak to her. They explained with great compassion that they couldn&rsquo;t, she would just be in too much pain.</p>

<p>So I sat and talked to her and cuddled with her and I remember her sitting up on the recliner asleep and I&rsquo;m pouring my heart out. I said something like &ldquo;your the best mother  in the world&rdquo; and her eyes stirred, then through this enormous dose of cancer-grade pain killers she opened her eyes, looked at me with a wry smile and said &ldquo;I know&rdquo; dripping with sarcasm and cheek and then immediately went back to sleep&hellip;she died about 10 hours later and that was the  last thing she ever said to me. It makes me laugh and cry in equal measures at the same time usually.</p>

<p>They absolutely can hear you and are aware of your presence. I really believe knowing their family and loved ones are close brings great comfort and ease to their passing.</p>

I had just ordered lunch for my family and I and was heading out the door to go get it but before I left I went over and gave mum a kiss on her cheek and told her &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back. I love you&hellip;&rdquo; She took her last breath before I managed to leave the room and it was like the biggest sigh of relief you&rsquo;d ever heard. At least she&rsquo;s not battling the Dementia anymore.</p>

      <label for="l6glx4h" class="commentText"><p>My mom died of covid in April 2020.  Her health had been failing for years before that, and when she got covid it was pretty certain that she wouldn&rsquo;t make it through.</p>

<p>Even though that was in the thick of the pandemic, the hospital let me visit her on her last afternoon.  I had to wear the complete space suit, complete with taped gloves, mask, and a face shield.  I was concerned that she wouldn&rsquo;t know who I was, and I was concerned that I wouldn&rsquo;t know what to say.  One of the nurses told me that my mother would recognize my voice, and that I should just tell my mother that her son (me) was fine, safe, and happy and that her work was done.</p>

<p>I stayed there for three hours that afternoon.  Once or twice she might&rsquo;ve reacted - I don&rsquo;t know.  The nurses had been very kind to let me visit her, but I knew that I was overstaying my welcome, so I finally left.</p>

<p>I left the hospital in a haze.  Since it was the pandemic, the hospital grounds and parking lot were empty, except for my wife who had been waiting for me.  The world didn&rsquo;t make sense at that moment.</p>

<p>My mom passed away later that evening.</p>
