      <label for="l6fzxr7" class="commentText"><p>Before my BIL passed away last Saturday, he was in a coma for a few days. We would take turns sitting with him talking about good times we shared, how much we loved him, etc. just in case he could hear us. My sister, BIL and nephew had a tradition where every night they would count down from ten and yell, &ldquo;goooodnight family!&rdquo; One of our last nights with him we were all together as a family so we did the goodnight countdown and when we got to &ldquo;family&rdquo; his mouth moved like he was saying it.   I like to think that was our sign he was still with us until the end and didn&rsquo;t pass without knowing how loved he was.</p>

      <label for="l6fzqk8" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s true, I was in a coma and then in and out of consciousness for approx 6 weeks. I knew what was going on around me, even though sometimes it took me an hour or two to figure what was real and what was imagined. I heard the nurses gossip, my mother and father visiting, and everything around me. When they put ice around me during a fever I was hallucinating that I was elsewhere when suddenly I was surrounded by bags of ice etc. I still vividly remember much of this three years later.</p>

      <label for="l6g0z6d" class="commentText"><p>I was in a coma for a week after a crossbow to my head. It was instant, didn&rsquo;t remember anything from when I was out. But the weird thing was? Nobody knew I was in a coma. My body was still moving, and even writing on a whiteboard. Only wrote &ldquo;H2O&rdquo; from what the nurse told me, but since i had an IV and a tube going down my throat they couldn&rsquo;t give me any water. The other weird thing about it, when i woke up I was hearing a voice in my head. One of the nurses later told me that it was an internal monologue and that in some cases of TBI people can gain/lose it. All this combined with the fact that i wasnt able to find a single case of another human living through a crossbow to the head and not becoming a vegetable and i gotta say I am the luckiest person i know. Like come on that&rsquo;s freaking metal!!! 😂</p>

This post brought a tear to my eye thinking maybe he heard some of it, and knew what i felt about him. I also wasnt always a good son, but i hope he knew what i felt about him.</p>

Interestingly I was often on fire. I didn&rsquo;t hear a damn thing people were saying to me 8n real life.</p>

<p>When I woke up I told everyone my dad was dead and asked where my Australian family where. I hadn&rsquo;t seen my mum or brother in years.</p>

<p>Turns out I was only in the coma for a week. My dad died 2 months later.</p>

      <label for="l6gau2r" class="commentText"><p>I think it really depends on how strong of a coma you are in. I was in an induced coma for three days. The initial aneasthesia had a relatively high dosage to knock me out. Apparently they would normally lower it so that you can cooperate a bit while being in a coma, like turning around in bed, etc. However as soon as they lowered a bit the aneasthetics I started pulling out my intubation, severely roughing up my throat.. so they had to keep the dose quite high to keep me in the coma.</p>

<p>When I woke up, it was as if I was from one place (my last memory) to another in seconds&hellip; while it had been three days.</p>

<p>I was whether I held her head I told her I loved her.</p>

<p>I, like you wasn’t always the best son.</p>
