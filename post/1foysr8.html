      <p>This isn’t a knock on anybody, merely just a question</p>

<p>Why are NBA fans obsessed with narratives, even when they are being proven false?</p>

<p>Also when did the whole narrative thing start? Growing up in the 2000s, it was always like this but people back then had common sense. Narratives went around but were never out of control</p>

<p>So anyways, this is just a question I been thinking about. Feel free to drop your opinion down below</p>

<p>It bothers me because Kyrie got hurt in 2021, Chris Paul got hurt in 2023, Suns had no point guard last year. He hasn’t won since Golden State because of circumstances that went beyond his control</p>

      <label for="lotqk46" class="commentText"><p>I mean it’s not a narrative that KD hasn’t won outside of Golden State, that is simply a fact. Are there some mitigating circumstances? Yes. But KD himself sabotaged the way he is viewed by taking the easiest path to a ring.</p>

<p>I personally thought he had the capacity to be one of the all time greats almost on the same level as LeBron, but we’ll simply never know because he robbed himself of the challenge. (And also because he got injured.)</p>

<p>Saying that he could have been anything other than what he has been is just your own choice of narrative.</p>

      <label for="lotqfeu" class="commentText"><p>I think narratives have always existed in the league. How else do fans make sense of what they’re watching? Before Michael Jordan won his first championship, a narrative existed that the leading scorer in the league couldn’t win it all. When Magic had some playoff trouble, he was dubbed “Tragic Johnson.”  But because there were less dumb elements like hot take debate shows in the media, the more ridiculous ones didn’t have the legs they do today.</p>

      <label for="lotsqle" class="commentText"><p>More voices online, more people regurgitating the same things over and over.</p>

<p>Most NBA fans online don&rsquo;t watch 82 games, and rely on narratives to have opinions on things they really don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Hell, even if you watch 82 games of your own team, and know basketball relatively well, you&rsquo;re likely only seeing 2-4 games of every other team, and are prone to accidentally just go with the flow of narratives about other teams.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just sort of inevitable unless you have the time to really watch every single team in the league, which most people don&rsquo;t.</p>

      <label for="lotzd09" class="commentText"><p>Narratives are what makes sport entertaining. Stories are engaging, they give us a way to understand the world, they ties everything together. Humans tell stories about everything - from how we are created to that crazy car accident we nearly had to what that bitch at work did. Without narrative, sport is merely a contest of physical prowess, with no real consequence in the outcome.</p>

<p>Narratives give the box scores meaning. We load 75 years of history into every game we watch. Oh, the Celtics are playing the Heat? Well, here&rsquo;s the story so far&hellip; Here&rsquo;s why you should care about it&hellip;I wonder what happens in the next chapter?</p>
