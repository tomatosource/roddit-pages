<p>Shaq scored about 2k more points while Duncan has about 2k more rebounds.</p>

<p>Shaqs has a gold medal while Tim has a bronze</p>

<p>Duncan has 2 MVPs to Shaqs 1 however he was one vote away from unanimous that year.</p>

<p>Shaq scored on better efficiency, about 8% better but Duncan leads him in blocks.</p>

Kobe was an astronomically better defender than Steph, while also being the better offensive player. You have lost your mind if you think Steph is on D Wade or peak Kawhi’s level as an overall player, let alone Kobe.</p>

You have one buffoon claiming Kobe isn’t a top 30 player, then you have another dunderhead claiming Steph isn’t even better than D Wade or Kawhi. They’re both top 2 all time at their position, which makes them at least top 10 material if not higher.</p>

Go make a list of all the players who topped out at 46% from the field in the top 50. Then give me that list. Chuckers don&rsquo;t belong in the top 20 nephew not any modern ones anyway. Get out. Kobe&rsquo;s entire Finals career?</p>

<p>41% lmao. Yeah, he was carried to rings multiple times. I like Kobe, but the media is his sidekick at this point as are the refs. Take away all those free throws, and he doesn&rsquo;t look so great anymore.</p>

<p>And then you got all these brain rot kids who think Kobe is Jordan lol.</p>

<p>Kobe topped out at just under 47% from the field in his best year. Jordan almost made it to 54, and each player basically played the same game.</p>

<p>Kobe was a chucker, and chuckers don&rsquo;t belong in the top 20.</p>

His efficiency is only where it is because he had a better whistle than any of these guys.</p>

<p>If you were to take his legendary whistle away, suddenly Kobe just doesn&rsquo;t look as great. He was a 41% shooter in the Finals. That is the definition of not great.</p>

Stats don&rsquo;t lie. Kobe never shot better than 46% in his career. MJ almost got to 54% in his best season. He was on another level, and plenty of players are better than Kobe when you subtract free throws. We all know LA was just a golden whistle house.</p>

<p>Without Shaq and Phil and all the media Kobe is just another pretty great chucker.</p>

<p>In Tim&rsquo;s last 5 season he made 2 all nba teams and 2 all defensive teams</p>

<p>The same age that Shaq retired Duncan was named to an all nba and all defensive team at that age</p>

      <label for="llu962s" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not slight, it&rsquo;s prominent. The fact that Duncan was even still very  productive in his last season, to the point where people were thinking he could still go for another 2-3 years before he retired. By the end of Shaqs career everyone acknowledged he was done, that&rsquo;s a distinct advantage for Tim</p>

      <label for="llu3nq0" class="commentText"><p>Shaq, just too much of a destructive offensive force, and highly efficient despite the free throws and lack of range. Duncan was a much better defender but was far less efficient as a scorer on far lower volume.</p>

<p>People always complain when you point out that Kobe and Duncan’s career TS% are nearly identical, because Kobe has a long-running reputation as an inefficient high volume chucker he hasn’t been able to fully shake, and people defend Duncan by pointing out that scoring wasn’t his #1 objective. That’s true, but he was a career 19 ppg scorer and that was no small part of his game at all especially in his prime.</p>

      <label for="llu7kjl" class="commentText"><p>Tim Duncan is always criminally underrated because he was a low key dude playing in San Antonio. Duncan was 1 missed rebound, 1 missed free throw, or Ray Allen 3 from 6 titles. I still had him the best PF of all time until Lebron passed him with the Lakers championship and the next few years of still insane production.</p>

<p>That being said it&rsquo;s pretty dang close. I&rsquo;d probably still give it to Shaq because he has almost the same accolades and was so dominant he changed the game. Dude was unstoppable. Got rules changed, had teams signing players just to foul him.</p>

<p>I give Steph high praise for the same reason. Now everyone and their mama is trying to put up long 3s. He&rsquo;s the undisputed greatest shooter in NBA history.</p>

      <label for="llu8jhb" class="commentText"><p>I remember when Shaq insecurely ripped on Mark Cuban and Cuban simply stated how if he had Shaq&rsquo;s god given size he&rsquo;d be a successful NBA payer, but he didn&rsquo;t so he worked his ass off and earned every dime of his fortune being a hard working and very smart businessman. Like most of these take down responses to Shaq insults it was smart and classy.</p>

<p>So I have to lean in to that idea. Tim Duncan was not exciting but his ability, performance, leadership, demeanor just seems greater to me than what Shaq was doing using his massive frame to back guys down and throw it down on them.</p>

<p>Look I think Shaq is a top 12 player of all time still but I&rsquo;m leaning towards Tim as a better player and career, considering.</p>
