      <label for="ldxzxr5" class="commentText"><p>Interesting, that’s not how I interpreted it at all to be completely honest with you</p>

<p>I see Skip as a victim of trauma and bad parenting. His father forced him and his brother to work in his restaurant from a young age. I firmly believe that NO child should be forced. If you need to force your children to work for free in order to support your business, then maybe it’s time to entertain the idea that your business isn’t doing very well</p>

<p>Even though he was forced to do it, Skip’s brother LOVED working at the restaurant, which is why he’s still a chef to this day (and a pretty famous one at that for people who didn’t know)</p>

<p>Skip HATED working in the restaurant, and sports were his outlet and escape during a time period that he still feels very negatively about to this day</p>

<p>This pretty strong difference in opinion and interpretation is what caused the rift between Skip and his brother; I’m not calling you a liar, but I do think that to boils this down to “Skip wants nothing to do with his brother because his brother doesn’t like sports” is a ridiculous oversimplification of the situation IMO</p>

<p>Skip’s brother remembers it fondly as a time where he found his passion, and Skip remembers it as a period of trauma and forced labor. With this in mind, it’s very obvious to see why there would be some level of trauma and resentment involved</p>

      <label for="ldy6ssd" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, it doesn&rsquo;t really come down to not liking or liking sports at all, the reason they aren&rsquo;t close is because they have VERY different views on how their childhood was and that probably extends to how Skip saw his parents and how his brother saw them.</p>

<p>I never felt when i heard it that Skip resented his brother or anything, it&rsquo;s just that they aren&rsquo;t very close due to the circumstances in which they were raised, which is totally understandable.</p>

I think it&rsquo;s not uncommon for siblings from traumatic upbringings to not be very close for a multitude of reasons.</p>

      <label for="ldyjhv3" class="commentText"><p>So… I kinda agree with you and disagree. I think it is mature to recognize that you’d be a terrible parent and not want to bring unhappy children into the world. It’s just odd to me that <em>this</em> was the passion for which he made that sacrifice. Like, when you hear him talk about these shows, it sounds like a genuine passion - just sitting in a stage and talking shit about LeBron for three hours. He takes it <em>way</em> too seriously.</p>

<p>I remember the first time introduced my wife to Skip Bayless. I’m a huge fan of his brother and we were watching his TV show (Mexico: One Plate at a Time), and we were talking about how Rick had all these interests. He’s a chef, he’s passionate about farming, anthropology, beer making, musical theater, all these things. And then I mentioned how his brother was none of those things and she couldn’t believe it. She knows nothing about sports so she’d never heard of Skip Bayless. I showed her a clip of Skip arguing about LeBron for five minutes straight just as a contrast. You know what she said after seeing that?</p>

<p>“What a sad little man. Why would he devote his life to this?”</p>

<p>And yeah, he got paid handsomely for doing that, but still…</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not pro-Skip or anything, but where we draw the line in terms of what&rsquo;s acceptable to enjoy professionally always intrigues me.</p>

      <label for="ldyusyn" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I think spreading awareness about Mexican cuisine, Mexican culture, the sustainability of food production, etc, is valuable to society. Even if it is a niche interest, he is doing some cool stuff beyond just owning a restaurant. You may disagree with that but I wouldn’t say he’s just some random chef.</p>

<p>And my thing with Skip isn’t that he does what he does or that he gets paid a lot of money for it. It’s just… he goes on TV and shit talks athletes for three hours a day. He doesn’t provide any real insight or anything - he hasn’t been a beat reporter in a long time, it’s not like he’s in any locker rooms. You don’t learn anything watching him. He’s a professional troll. There’s nothing wrong with enjoying that. More power to him if he enjoys it, but it’s just odd hearing him talk about his work and how damn seriously he takes it.</p>

<p>He probably never really had a desire of having kids anyway and his work commitment just made it that much easier for it to never happen and become a conscious decision. Like, i love my job and i work 60 hours a week very regularly, i wouldn&rsquo;t give that up to have a child, not right now atleast.</p>

That doesn’t mean I’m not doing “work” of some kind but I’d love to dedicate more time to my hobbies/passions and maybe do something closer to volunteer work if I feel that pull to contribute. I suspect the situation is very different when your job is “yell on TV” though. That’s probably what Skip <em>is</em> passionate about doing, entertaining and sports.</p>

      <label for="ldxqmrk" class="commentText"><p>Skip had an abusive upbringing with alcoholic parents, and sports is all he knows because it was his escape. He said his entire family was into cooking (Rick picked it up from that) and he would just be out doing sports. I think either he or Rick said that Skip wasn&rsquo;t home much starting in high school because of that and it was him avoiding home. He and his first wife divorced and its assumed it&rsquo;s due to his obsession with work. He and his current wife admitted on podcast that they don&rsquo;t sleep in the same room because all he does is watch sports late and wake up early to do the show. Despite his age and having this early morning show he still finds time to do a podcast.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s also why Rick went to live in Mexico and focus on Mexican cuisine, just an escape from his family best he could.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t think Skip knows how to rest so retirement would fuck with him big time.</p>

They basically popped up on live media at the same time but Skip was way more known before that and he jumped to a much more prominent role nationally when Mad Dog was largely doing New York</p>

<p>So no, I have no reason to hate on him. That&rsquo;s ridiculous to me. Doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;ll consume the content. At the end of the day that stuff has done huge numbers.</p>

      <label for="ldyckhr" class="commentText"><p>Well, he wouldn&rsquo;t go anyways. As I heard it after Sharpe left, Skip has pretty much full control of the show and ESPN/Smith would never agree to it.</p>

<p>The article does talk about how bad the ratings are for his show and I can tell you why&hellip;Skip. All he wants to talk about is Cowboys, Lebron, Clippers with Kawhi, more Cowboys. They never talk about&hellip;hockey, baseball, tennis, golf unless it is Tiger, or soccer that I have seen and so on. They are a sports show that talks about two sports unless their is a big scandal in one of the others. Last year, I watched after the World Series and there was zero talk about the winner. Or about the series at all. They never acknowledge the Stanley Cup winner when I watched. It was far worse when Tom Brady was still playing because of the man crush he has on Brady. But talking about Dak Prescott three times a show&hellip;or the cowboys three times a show&hellip;or Lebron three times or more&hellip;At least ESPN will talk about other things.</p>
