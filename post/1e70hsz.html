      <label for="ldxisgp" class="commentText"><p>I don’t know if I’d go that far saying it’s wisdom and maturity. Skip is just obsessed with sports and it’s all he lives for. He doesn’t even speak to his brother, a world renowned chef, because his brother isn’t into sports. Skip said he feels like he doesn’t even have a brother, which is bizarre to me. It’s just sports.</p>

      <label for="ldxzxr5" class="commentText"><p>Interesting, that’s not how I interpreted it at all to be completely honest with you</p>

<p>I see Skip as a victim of trauma and bad parenting. His father forced him and his brother to work in his restaurant from a young age. I firmly believe that NO child should be forced. If you need to force your children to work for free in order to support your business, then maybe it’s time to entertain the idea that your business isn’t doing very well</p>

<p>Even though he was forced to do it, Skip’s brother LOVED working at the restaurant, which is why he’s still a chef to this day (and a pretty famous one at that for people who didn’t know)</p>

<p>Skip HATED working in the restaurant, and sports were his outlet and escape during a time period that he still feels very negatively about to this day</p>

<p>This pretty strong difference in opinion and interpretation is what caused the rift between Skip and his brother; I’m not calling you a liar, but I do think that to boils this down to “Skip wants nothing to do with his brother because his brother doesn’t like sports” is a ridiculous oversimplification of the situation IMO</p>

<p>Skip’s brother remembers it fondly as a time where he found his passion, and Skip remembers it as a period of trauma and forced labor. With this in mind, it’s very obvious to see why there would be some level of trauma and resentment involved</p>

      <label for="ldy6ssd" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, it doesn&rsquo;t really come down to not liking or liking sports at all, the reason they aren&rsquo;t close is because they have VERY different views on how their childhood was and that probably extends to how Skip saw his parents and how his brother saw them.</p>

<p>I never felt when i heard it that Skip resented his brother or anything, it&rsquo;s just that they aren&rsquo;t very close due to the circumstances in which they were raised, which is totally understandable.</p>

Skip was very cold and detached when discussing him, it was weird to me. Like, he has no relationship with his brother bc his brother isn’t into sports, which is weird as hell to me. Skip’s a weird guy in general.</p>

      <label for="ldyjhv3" class="commentText"><p>So… I kinda agree with you and disagree. I think it is mature to recognize that you’d be a terrible parent and not want to bring unhappy children into the world. It’s just odd to me that <em>this</em> was the passion for which he made that sacrifice. Like, when you hear him talk about these shows, it sounds like a genuine passion - just sitting in a stage and talking shit about LeBron for three hours. He takes it <em>way</em> too seriously.</p>

<p>I remember the first time introduced my wife to Skip Bayless. I’m a huge fan of his brother and we were watching his TV show (Mexico: One Plate at a Time), and we were talking about how Rick had all these interests. He’s a chef, he’s passionate about farming, anthropology, beer making, musical theater, all these things. And then I mentioned how his brother was none of those things and she couldn’t believe it. She knows nothing about sports so she’d never heard of Skip Bayless. I showed her a clip of Skip arguing about LeBron for five minutes straight just as a contrast. You know what she said after seeing that?</p>

<p>“What a sad little man. Why would he devote his life to this?”</p>

<p>And yeah, he got paid handsomely for doing that, but still…</p>

Even if it is a niche interest, he is doing some cool stuff beyond just owning a restaurant. You may disagree with that but I wouldn’t say he’s just some random chef.</p>

<p>And my thing with Skip isn’t that he does what he does or that he gets paid a lot of money for it. It’s just… he goes on TV and shit talks athletes for three hours a day. He doesn’t provide any real insight or anything - he hasn’t been a beat reporter in a long time, it’s not like he’s in any locker rooms. You don’t learn anything watching him. He’s a professional troll. There’s nothing wrong with enjoying that. More power to him if he enjoys it, but it’s just odd hearing him talk about his work and how damn seriously he takes it.</p>

He has enough self realization to say “work is important to me, I shouldn’t have kids” of course people will praise that. Idiots have kids everyday and they shouldn’t. We could use more self reflection in our lives. I respect his take on this.</p>

<p>Never did I say he should have had kids and it’s bad he didn’t. Smh dude you are fixated on repeating one thing I didn’t even say. I’m going to guess you are compensating for some of your own life choices at this point</p>

<p>He probably never really had a desire of having kids anyway and his work commitment just made it that much easier for it to never happen and become a conscious decision. Like, i love my job and i work 60 hours a week very regularly, i wouldn&rsquo;t give that up to have a child, not right now atleast.</p>

      <label for="ldyw4qc" class="commentText"><p>My grad school advisor was like this. He got emeritus status but wanted to be in the lab doing research, publishing papers, and working with his grad students/postdocs. If its what you love to do you stop considering it work at a certain point, its just a hobby you get paid to do.</p>

      <label for="ldxcuzp" class="commentText"><p>I’m 26 and if you told me my girlfriend and I are set for life and I can just do whatever I want I quit tomorrow. That doesn’t mean I’m not doing “work” of some kind but I’d love to dedicate more time to my hobbies/passions and maybe do something closer to volunteer work if I feel that pull to contribute. I suspect the situation is very different when your job is “yell on TV” though. That’s probably what Skip <em>is</em> passionate about doing, entertaining and sports.</p>

      <label for="ldxqmrk" class="commentText"><p>Skip had an abusive upbringing with alcoholic parents, and sports is all he knows because it was his escape. He said his entire family was into cooking (Rick picked it up from that) and he would just be out doing sports. I think either he or Rick said that Skip wasn&rsquo;t home much starting in high school because of that and it was him avoiding home. He and his first wife divorced and its assumed it&rsquo;s due to his obsession with work. He and his current wife admitted on podcast that they don&rsquo;t sleep in the same room because all he does is watch sports late and wake up early to do the show. Despite his age and having this early morning show he still finds time to do a podcast.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s also why Rick went to live in Mexico and focus on Mexican cuisine, just an escape from his family best he could.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t think Skip knows how to rest so retirement would fuck with him big time.</p>

      <label for="ldynho3" class="commentText"><p>Nah, Skip was known as a top reporter in the late 70s. ESPN initially hired Skip for TV the same year Mad Dog got his own radio show. They basically popped up on live media at the same time but Skip was way more known before that and he jumped to a much more prominent role nationally when Mad Dog was largely doing New York</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s like saying howard stern and some monday morning host once a week on tv started the same year so they&rsquo;re equal&hellip;</p>

<p>Yeah they got the jobs at the same time, you cant compare how massive mike and mad dog were on sports radio to skip doing a panel show once a week.</p>

<p>mike and mad dog were groundbreaking, there was nothing like them in the 90s.</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s not even a comparison.</p>

      <label for="ldz83vc" class="commentText"><p>Mike and the Mad Dog were a new york only show. The vast majority of the country never heard him. Youre conflating the NYC metro area with the country. I knew of the guy living near there but no one on the west coast would have. I think they aired in like Tampa or 1 other market that&rsquo;s it. Skip was on national TV and again he was already more known than Mad Dog. I don&rsquo;t think anyone in that space would say Skip copied Mad Dog.</p>

<p>Youre comparing to Stern but Stern is well known because he went national lol. His show went national in the 80s. Mike and the Mad Dog never went national and Mad Dog went national on XM on his own after it ended.</p>

      <label for="ldzfo4e" class="commentText"><p>First it was still groundbreaking/revolutionary.  There are lot of artists/bands that could be used as an example&hellip;. not as popular as other bands who came after/copied them, but the less popular ones prior were the revolutionary ones&hellip;.</p>

<p>second, I&rsquo;m willing to bet even though they had a smaller geographical area, Mike and mad dog had more listeners than skip had viewers on his espn show that you used as your argument.  so mike and mad dog would be more popular than skip.</p>

<p>third, most of these guys on espn today all consider mike and mad dog the GOATS of sports talk radio.  (simmons, stephen a, greeney, eisen&hellip; just off the top of my head)</p>

The mainstream/zeitgeist/whatever you want to call it takes in new stuff like that, figures out what can be used, and repackages it. Thinking of hippies and the counter-cultural revolution in the 60s - it became a commercialized product sold back to us.</p>

<p>So no, I have no reason to hate on him. That&rsquo;s ridiculous to me. Doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;ll consume the content. At the end of the day that stuff has done huge numbers.</p>

<p>The article does talk about how bad the ratings are for his show and I can tell you why&hellip;Skip. All he wants to talk about is Cowboys, Lebron, Clippers with Kawhi, more Cowboys. They never talk about&hellip;hockey, baseball, tennis, golf unless it is Tiger, or soccer that I have seen and so on. They are a sports show that talks about two sports unless their is a big scandal in one of the others. Last year, I watched after the World Series and there was zero talk about the winner. Or about the series at all. They never acknowledge the Stanley Cup winner when I watched. It was far worse when Tom Brady was still playing because of the man crush he has on Brady. But talking about Dak Prescott three times a show&hellip;or the cowboys three times a show&hellip;or Lebron three times or more&hellip;At least ESPN will talk about other things.</p>

      <label for="ldxzrtj" class="commentText"><p>As someone who used to watch First Take quite often Skip and SAS don&rsquo;t work nearly as good as the duos formed within the past couple of years post breakup.
