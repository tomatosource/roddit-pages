      <p>That’s 11.6 per game in the first 3 rounds and just 4 per game in the finals.</p>

<p>Dallas also had 54 lob dunks in the first 3 rounds. They only have 1 in these finals.</p>

<p>The Celtics defensive coaching and personnel is putting on a masterclass at taking away what Dallas wants to do. Joe Mazzulla deserves some respect for his schemes.</p>

It was just sitting there like &ldquo;I am going to watch this team lose out&rdquo; because you could see it wasn&rsquo;t that Boston was going to win the series, it was GSW was going to lose it, and they&rsquo;re just too good to lose it 4 games out of 7.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the same vibe I have for this series but with the Cs in GSW&rsquo;s position now.</p>

      <label for="l81grb3" class="commentText"><p>Unless I&rsquo;m missing something, Luka played in <a href="https://www.fiba.basketball/basketballworldcup/2023/team/Slovenia#tab=games_and_results" target="_blank">8 games in Euroleague games for ~257 minutes from 26 August 2023 to 9 Sept 2023</a>?</p>

<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s plenty of practices and this isn&rsquo;t nothing, but the Mavericks also didn&rsquo;t play at all in the 2023 playoffs, while say the Celtics played in 20 games last postseason.  Honestly, while I think it could affect things early in the season, I think games played in April/May &lsquo;23 or Aug/Sept are pretty irrelevant by next June.  That said, Luka having 786 playoff minutes in 19 games so far to Tatum&rsquo;s 655 minutes in 16 games is a more significant difference.</p>

      <label for="l7zt9cs" class="commentText"><p>Agreed. When Tatum&rsquo;s shots aren&rsquo;t falling, or he sees that he&rsquo;s being double/triple teamed, he&rsquo;s willing to pass out the ball. Plus, no matter how much Kyrie has improved on defense, that&rsquo;s never going to be an overwhelming strength, and Tatum has the height and strength to match up with basically any bigs on your team, while having enough lateral quickness to still defend Luka and Kyrie decently well.</p>

Ya focuses on limiting Tatum deserves massive credit, but do not act like Tatum scoring his averages wouldn&rsquo;t be a guaranteed nail in the coffin. I get how important Kyrie is for you guys, but Tatum dominating is when the Celtics are truly unbeatable, especially this year with his leaps in every other facet of his game.</p>

In the first half luka and kyrie played great and they were still down.  Kyrie had a bad second half, and thats all it took.  The celtics arent going to shoot that poorly too many more times.  Unless something changes I cant see this going past 5 games.</p>

      <label for="l7ze04h" class="commentText"><p>Agreed, it reminded me of something the commentators said during our series against the Timberwolves — we were getting easy buckets, and they had to work hard for a bucket. Over time, that would show in the final score.</p>

<p>That’s how game 2 felt. We were neck and neck in the score, but it didn’t feel like an even matchup. It seemed inevitable that Boston would pull away.</p>

      <label for="l7zu1rn" class="commentText"><p>Marcus is the ultimate high risk, high reward defender. Super aggressive in trying to get turnovers, but that can let him get burned at times. When he played for us, he had the benefit of being younger and healthier, and then later on during his DPOY run, he was being ultra aggressive since he knew he had Time Lord in the paint to cover anyone getting past him. For most players, it&rsquo;s a shock to have someone guard you that close, and that physical, that they were just thrown off.</p>

<p>I do think they&rsquo;ll do well though next year when everyone is healthy. Between him and JJJ, they have a solid defensive duo.</p>

Tatum isn&rsquo;t going anywhere and I can&rsquo;t imagine they don&rsquo;t pay White after next year. KP probably gone after his contract is up and Horford might retire unless he wants to join the 40+ club. So the C&rsquo;s will need to find some bigs to keep things going past 2 years but they&rsquo;re going to be Finals or bust for a while.</p>

<p>In short, In 2 years you&rsquo;d be seeing basically this same team.</p>

      <label for="l7zsg1k" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;ll depend. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they started playing Jrue like Horford in the next few seasons to save his legs for major defensive assignments/playoffs so he doesn&rsquo;t have as much wear and tear. He had to shoulder a LOT in Milwaukee and prior because of team construction, here he&rsquo;s playing more carefree as a 4th/5th option and able to save more of his energy for defense.</p>

      <label for="l7zv62v" class="commentText"><p>At the very least, Jrue doesn&rsquo;t have to be counted on to be a big offensive presence, but to at least be able to shoot those open corner 3&rsquo;s. I was also reading an article that one of the reasons why they may have give Jrue such a big extension despite how old he&rsquo;ll be, is that it now becomes a good contract to trade for a new player. The Celtics have their own first round picks until 2027, with 2028 being a potential swap with the Spurs. Yes, it may not be super attractive since they&rsquo;re probably going to be picking later/last with the apron, but a first round pick is a first round pick that they can use in trades.</p>

      <label for="l7zrjvm" class="commentText"><p>The big argument against Jrue regressing is that he took a massive backseat in the offensive creation this season. Corner 3&rsquo;s age well and since he doesn&rsquo;t have the #2 option workload anymore he&rsquo;ll be able to conserve energy. A lot of the old guys in the NBA are still the killers they were in their prime but they can&rsquo;t keep it up for as many games or minutes per. Time will tell of course.</p>

Jrue&rsquo;s getting way up there in age, Horford&rsquo;s eventually going to retire, and literally just that alone would be enough for a Thunder team on the upswing to take over, not to mention the cap factors possibly turning into an issue.</p>

      <label for="l7z9vay" class="commentText"><p>I honestly think Dallas is two years away, and then they will be in great shape.  Much like the 2022 Celtics team, they just weren&rsquo;t complete/ready yet.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not super high on Kyrie long term, due to age/injury/craziness, but in theory he should still be there.  This experience is only going to help Luka get better, maybe pace a bit more during the season, and have the Mavs figure out some others ways to score that don&rsquo;t involve Luka.  Lively is only a rookie and could really grow into something formidable over the next two years.  Guys like PJ Washington are the kinds of role players you need to win titles, he just needs a lot more time to gel and grow consistency.</p>

<p>The only thing they&rsquo;re really missing outside the core is more shooting.  That&rsquo;s theoretically easily addressable if the front office makes the right move or two, and it&rsquo;s not asking too much to figure that out over the next two years.</p>

      <label for="l7zgqnw" class="commentText"><p>I wonder if that changes if both Kyrie and Luka are operating at a high level at the same time? If one guy is dominating you can live with it. If two guys are having there way on offense, maybe it will breakdown the defense a bit. Like one guy can&rsquo;t beat the Celtics alone, but in a sense, two could. Then you start changing up the flow of the game and Mavs role players get involved somehow. If decent Luka and non-existent everyone else can keep it close in Boston through 3Q, one disruption to Boston seems like it might be enough to get some wins. Also, regardless of figuring out BOS defense I fully expect much higher shooting percentages from Mavs at home.</p>

He got 18 shots off and many were the ones he made in previous series&rsquo;. He&rsquo;ll just have to work hard to get it. If clumsy Luka can do it, Kyrie can figure it out too.

      <label for="l7zr5nr" class="commentText"><p>This comment could definitely come back to bite me, but I think Kyrie is simply not good enough to operate at the level that the Mavs need against a defense this good. The looks he&rsquo;s getting are mostly very tough shots and he&rsquo;s just not an insane shooter like Luka where he&rsquo;ll make those anyways unless he&rsquo;s having an anomalously good night. Maybe he can go off for a game or two and make this a bit more interesting, but I&rsquo;m not holding my breath.</p>

I do expect he will turn it up and make the shots. Home court maybe is what he needs to ignite it. But yeah, he&rsquo;ll work for it non-stop. Nothing easy</p>

      <label for="l80b727" class="commentText"><p>I get what you&rsquo;re saying, but I think degree of difficulty does matter for every single player in this series besides Luka (who can only be stopped by fatigue, it seems). Kyrie, Tatum, and Brown can get hot and look unstoppable for a time, but if they&rsquo;re constantly getting swarmed they&rsquo;ll stop eventually. I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening to both Kyrie and Tatum really, but Tatum has the better team and affects the game in other ways besides. Kyrie&rsquo;s team isn&rsquo;t able to cover for him to that level, and he&rsquo;s not adding much if he&rsquo;s not scoring.</p>

      <label for="l811yrp" class="commentText"><p>The Celtics entire strategy is daring them to average 60-70 per game.  At one point they had 28 of the Mavs 35 points on 66% shooting.  And they were up by 3.</p>

<p>They can do that for a quarter, a half, maybe a game or two.  But, they both cooled off and Luka was 1-7 in the fourth quarter.  We want to hound them on defense, attack him on offense, and play straight up so that the role players can’t get hot.</p>

<p>So, yeah, of course they can win if they both have brilliant individual performances.  But, now you have to win 4 of 5 that way.</p>

      <label for="l81gbw6" class="commentText"><p>I felt like this started to happen in the second half yesterday - they started doubling or helping on Luka a lot more which led to some slightly better looks on offense. Our guys just couldn&rsquo;t make any of those opportunities.</p>

<p>If Kyrie and Luka can both cooking and play well and we can attack the paint like we have all season since the deadline with Gafford and Lively - then we have a great chance to turn the tables. But the Celtics have really done a good job taking those facets of our game away. So that&rsquo;s a big &lsquo;if&rsquo;</p>

      <label for="l80v0x7" class="commentText"><p>The Jrue Holiday sweepstakes was the biggest get of the offseason, which speaks volumes given how incredible Porzingus has been.</p>

<p>White and Holiday are SO good that you can let them guard Kyrie and Luka one-on-one and live with the consequences. The rest of the team cuts off the lobs and corner threes, and the Mavs starve.</p>

<p>And this isn&rsquo;t jut bad news for the Mavs in this series: This is bad moves for the Mavs for next year. Everybody is seeing their weaknesses moving forward. Hell, if the T-Wolves had seen how Boston was playing the Mavs before they started their series, they would have been able to do the same. The lobs KILLED the T-Wolves, and the corner threes added insult to injury.</p>

<p>If the Mavs don&rsquo;t adapt fast, they are not only sunk for this series, but for the foreseeable future. Sure, most teams don&rsquo;t have TWO great defenders in the back court, but they can still adopt a similar blue print, and in the playoffs, that will be enough.</p>

      <label for="l82akfg" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s a fair point. The Celtics are a DEEP team, on both ends of the court.</p>

<p>Conley is a good defender. If he was 6-8 years younger, he&rsquo;d be an amazing defender and exactly the kind of guy you&rsquo;d want to put on Luka or Kyrie. Well&hellip; Kyrie anyways. Luka it a bit too tall for him.</p>

<p>Boston is uniquely good. It&rsquo;s why they have the best record in the league and made it to the finals while losing only two games. So I see and agree with your point 100%.</p>

<p>I still think that the template they are using is going to be how many people approach guarding Luka and Kyrie. It&rsquo;s easier to weather those two, let them have big nights, and focus on shutting down the rest of the team. It&rsquo;s not a sure thing, but it&rsquo;s better than the alternative. Which is 30-35 from Luka, 20-30 from Kyrie, and a bunch of lops ate .900 and corner three at .450.</p>

<p>I also think that this finals run for the Mavs was a bit of a lucky draw. There were a lot of weird match-ups across the board in the west. If the Lakers played the Thunder, they&rsquo;d have won in the first round and would have a better shot against the Mavs. Had the Clippers been healthy, that series could hae gone another way.</p>

<p>The Mavs certainly earned their spot and deserve to be there, but having the Nuggets and Lakers knocked out for them, having aging teams like the Warriors and Lakers fall out of contention and younger teams with less playoff experience. That was a favourable line-up of opponents. Success is preparation meets opportunity, and they prepared, but it will be harder to do this next year. And if teams see how effective certain defensive schemes can be against the Mavs, there will be more teams prepared for this.</p>

<p>But yeah&hellip; your point stands. White and Holiday are incredible. It wouldn&rsquo;t be as effective an approach without those to cats. They are killing it.</p>

      <label for="l8273nu" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, this is why I didn’t get the calls for Luka to drop 20 in the first quarter like he did against the wolves in game 5. Like, okay? He’s gonna wear down over time. The Celtics aren’t going to overreact and change their defensive game plan based on 1 quarter or even 1 game. If Luka can get 80 fucking points, then hats off, and it’s insane that I even say I could see him getting to 50-60 but he can’t do it 4 times on that knee and at that weight, while constantly getting hunted on defense.</p>

<p>It’s just a recipe for failure to keep putting more of the load on him. Kidd has to find a way to get more offense that’s not driven through Luka and that can help the defense, which will help Luka and then he boosts the offense even further. Instead, he keeps pouring water from one glass into the other and he’s sloshing it all over, losing more and more. Kyrie has to explode or you have to figure out a new scheme with two different players. Hardy or Hardaway are the only ones who don’t rely on Luka to initiate for them (also Kyrie but already addressed him).</p>

      <label for="l7zam4d" class="commentText"><p>Defensive studs typically only contain a superstar. It&rsquo;s not often that they totally shut one down completely. The value is that you can afford single coverage on the superstar and then cover everyone else. Mavs have a pretty iso heavy offense, but now Luka has no release valve when he can&rsquo;t initiate. Gafford and Lively are being defended well, the corners are covered, and Kyrie hasn&rsquo;t been able to score like he normally does. The insane part is that for the Celtics, they don&rsquo;t really need to worry about who ends up on Luka because White, Holiday, Brown, and Tatum can all stay in front of him and contest, with KP and Horford not being awful either</p>

      <label for="l7ze344" class="commentText"><p>Luka is a unique guard who plays into the celts strengths like you noted. I think the Celtics system had a much harder time with haliburton and Mitchell because they’re quick enough to punish the Celtics bigs in space. Luka is obviously better than either of those guards but his lack of speed really shows when Horford switches onto him and can play him 1v1 really well. That wasn’t happening in the Cleveland or Indy series</p>

<p>While it is true, the weird part is that Celtics been doing exactly this since October, yet folks noticing it (90% of the media included) only in the finals.</p>

<p>Celtics are the worst possible matchup for the Mavs, bc this is the default D scheme Celtics ran for the entire season with 80% W success.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kinda hard to realize it bc the only attention they been getting was after their losses&hellip;</p>

<p>Don’t have the personnel like Tatum to tag bigs on rotations though. But I do wonder what would happen if we just stayed home more or only helped from non Kyrie players on the wing.</p>

      <label for="l7zegn0" class="commentText"><p>Agreed. There were too many long stretches where OKC just couldn’t score. There were plenty of defensive stops that were followed by an offensive possession with zero flow or ball movement.</p>

<p>With a year or 2 of more experience for such a young roster, I don’t see this being as much a problem going forward. OKC will look much stronger in next years playoffs.</p>

<p>If THJ could play a lick of defense this would’ve been his series, but here we are</p>

<p>This is what my thought was too. But it takes 1 of Luka and Kyrie to generate that look for the other, unless the role players step up their shot creation.</p>

Also Luka absolutely cooks Gobert when he gets the switch.  The Cs are fine with letting Luka score, so our lobs don&rsquo;t exist which was a huge part of our game.  Also there aren&rsquo;t too many players for Luka to hunt like he did with Gobert.  They don&rsquo;t care much for the switch instead they&rsquo;ve been guarding the rebounds and the kick out passes.  You saw the stark difference in the assists in g1 and the amount of shots created by Luka in Boston vs Minny.  Cs just have better rounded defenders than the Wolves that they can afford to play ISO and their offense is good enough to counter Luka carry jobs.</p>

<p>The supporting cast is not skilled enough to initiate anything on their own so they are purely spacers for Luka to play hero ball. Spacers mind you that cannot hit lightly contested 3’s so they are basically non-factors.</p>

<p>You might get a 73 effort against the Hawks, or you might get what’s happening this series.</p>

      <label for="l80htur" class="commentText"><p>The Mav&rsquo;s problem isn&rsquo;t defense. It&rsquo;s offense. Their offense is too stagnant. Scoring under 100 in both game 1 and game 2 is bad. They&rsquo;re keeping Celtics under 108 in both games. That&rsquo;s respectable defense.</p>

<p>Their ball movements sucks.</p>

<p>There <em>is</em> a difference but don&rsquo;t frame it as 200 vs 10.</p>

      <label for="l7yzwlr" class="commentText"><p>Better comparison is per game. They went from shooting over 11 corner 3s per game in the West to just 4 per game in the finals.</p>

      <label for="l82860p" class="commentText"><p>Honestly the fact that Celtics offense has honestly been pretty meh and they are STILL up two games is a statement. They are playing how the T-Wolves SHOULD have been playing, it&rsquo;s not like Boston has integrated some crazy new strategy, this IS their defense.</p>

<p>I honestly feel like Dallas is lucky to be where they are, T-Wolves had some uncharacteristic poor shooting performances (which happens), which would&rsquo;ve been survivable on it&rsquo;s own, but they also just failed to scheme well defensively. It&rsquo;s a shame, because I just don&rsquo;t think Dallas has the tools to adjust offensively, they lived and are going to die by Luka-ball.</p>
