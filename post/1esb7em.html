<p>Though, as a big David Robinson fan, I&rsquo;ll absolutely concede this too: sometimes I&rsquo;m not sure David Robinson had a bread-and-butter go-to signature weapon come playoff time. In a way, that was kind of the essence of David Robinson, because he could kill you a number of ways. But on the other hand, with Hakeem, you knew you could dump it down low and there was a good chance he&rsquo;d make some magic happen right when you needed it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll also add this while I&rsquo;m here: that 1995 series was pretty great, and I think there absolutely a timeline in which the Spurs pull it out (particularly if that timeline features a Dennis Rodman who&rsquo;s bought into the team gameplan for the greater good). Moreover, Hakeem was amazing that series, but a big part of what allowed him to cook was the fact that Mario Elie, Robert Horry, and Kenny Smith were <em>feasting</em> on the shortened line. But I mean, all credit to them, because that&rsquo;s how great players and great teams work. Deciding whether to hit Hakeem with single coverage or double and risk him finding one of his shooters hitting a collective 45 percent from three probably wasn&rsquo;t a fun time.</p>

They beat you with their insane power and athleticism, along with their skills in other areas (defense, Giannis playmaking vs DRob middy). But they got bested consistently by more skilled players, outside of a couple of great runs.</p>

<p>Hakeem is to me the third greatest center. His movement with the basketball to create space.</p>

<p>I mean LeBron after the 2011 Finals, went and practiced with Hakeem. You can see on YouTube how impactful Hakeem was to young LeBron.</p>

<p>LeBron was always the physical player. Getting to the rim. The fact that he hit better and expanded his midrange speaks volumes to the impact Hakeem had</p>

      <label for="li4smi6" class="commentText"><p>The Dream famously got the better of the Admiral in their most high profile showdown but what can get lost after so many years was Rodman&rsquo;s refusal to defend Hakeem during that series, meaning not only was Robinson having to play his normal role as the Spurs&rsquo; offensive engine while getting routinely double/triple teamed, he was also having to pull a massive load on the defensive end as well (against an angry, motivated Olajuwon no less). Boxscore watchers will look at Robinson&rsquo;s numbers after that series and dismiss them as him underperforming; IMO it was a goddamn miracle he managed to put up the stats he did given the situation he was facing. Out of the two I&rsquo;d take Olajuwon but it really was a lot closer than people think.</p>

      <label for="li4wgcd" class="commentText"><p>A completely underrated moment in NBA history but also totally consistent with who David Robinson was as a human. Plucking a random number out of thin air but in, like, 90 percent of cases, a superstar MVP coming off an injury would not be hearing anything about a rookie coming in and taking their mantle. But that&rsquo;s exactly why the Twin Tower era worked.</p>

<p>If he wanted, I bet David Robinson could have come back in &lsquo;98, demanded his usual touches, and still dropped 25+ as The Man. But it would have been to the detriment of Tim Duncan and the team as a whole. He recognized that, accepted it, and ended up reaping two rings as a result.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that often, the guys who make those sacrifices do sometimes pay for it down the line, just because their statlines don&rsquo;t look as pretty as they could have (Isiah Thomas being another). But it&rsquo;s those kind of sacrifices that often build a winner.</p>

<p>How on earth do his accomplishments and stats not support an argument for him being a no-doubt top 10 player? At absolute WORST he is 11 or 12 depending on how you place Shaq and Kobe</p>

      <label for="li4pzl9" class="commentText"><p>Hakeem absolutely daddy-dicked Robinson in the &lsquo;95 playoffs. As in The Dream delivered the dreaded Real Admiral <em>on</em> The Admiral, repeatedly.</p>

<p>Coach Pop had to re-animate David&rsquo;s corpse Mountain-style when he took over the Spurs the next season so he could mentor the Big Fundamental</p>

<p>EDIT: Alright, who is the slimy little communist twinkle-toed buttmunch et al that downvoted?</p>

<ul>
<li>Hakeem: 35.3 PPG, 12.5 REB, 5.0 AST, over 4 BPG</li>
<li>Admiral: 23.8 / 11.3 / 2.7, just over 2 BPG</li>
</ul>

<p>if the powers that be have a textbook definition of papa-cocking, that is in the contention for such a inset picture</p>
