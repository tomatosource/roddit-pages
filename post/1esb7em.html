<p>Though, as a big David Robinson fan, I&rsquo;ll absolutely concede this too: sometimes I&rsquo;m not sure David Robinson had a bread-and-butter go-to signature weapon come playoff time. In a way, that was kind of the essence of David Robinson, because he could kill you a number of ways. But on the other hand, with Hakeem, you knew you could dump it down low and there was a good chance he&rsquo;d make some magic happen right when you needed it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll also add this while I&rsquo;m here: that 1995 series was pretty great, and I think there absolutely a timeline in which the Spurs pull it out (particularly if that timeline features a Dennis Rodman who&rsquo;s bought into the team gameplan for the greater good). Moreover, Hakeem was amazing that series, but a big part of what allowed him to cook was the fact that Mario Elie, Robert Horry, and Kenny Smith were <em>feasting</em> on the shortened line. But I mean, all credit to them, because that&rsquo;s how great players and great teams work. Deciding whether to hit Hakeem with single coverage or double and risk him finding one of his shooters hitting a collective 45 percent from three probably wasn&rsquo;t a fun time.</p>

<p>Uh I don’t know what year you are taking about when you say 94, but if you mean 94-95, which makes sense since that is the year the Rockets with Hakeem beat the Spurs Robinson in the playoffs, that team had Sean Elliott on it.</p>

<p>He was a 2xAll Star in the prime of his career (made All Star teams before and after that year), and was one of the first true 3D players in the NBA. </p>

<p>Elliott wasn’t on the 93-94 Spurs team, but that shouldn’t matter to this conversation since it was the 94-95 Spurs team that lost to the Rockets (and the series in which Rodman didn’t want to guard Hakeem).  </p>

<p>You could fill a team to the brim with 1 time or 2 time all stars and still have zero chance of winning anything. You need actual stars for that, i.e. perennial all-stars.</p>

      <label for="li4smi6" class="commentText"><p>The Dream famously got the better of the Admiral in their most high profile showdown but what can get lost after so many years was Rodman&rsquo;s refusal to defend Hakeem during that series, meaning not only was Robinson having to play his normal role as the Spurs&rsquo; offensive engine while getting routinely double/triple teamed, he was also having to pull a massive load on the defensive end as well (against an angry, motivated Olajuwon no less). Boxscore watchers will look at Robinson&rsquo;s numbers after that series and dismiss them as him underperforming; IMO it was a goddamn miracle he managed to put up the stats he did given the situation he was facing. Out of the two I&rsquo;d take Olajuwon but it really was a lot closer than people think.</p>

<p>Hakeem is to me the third greatest center. His movement with the basketball to create space.</p>

<p>I mean LeBron after the 2011 Finals, went and practiced with Hakeem. You can see on YouTube how impactful Hakeem was to young LeBron.</p>

<p>LeBron was always the physical player. Getting to the rim. The fact that he hit better and expanded his midrange speaks volumes to the impact Hakeem had</p>

He was 9x All defense, 2x DPOY, and is the all time blocks leader by over 500 blocks (leads in reg season and playoff totals for career). He also is 10th all time in steals which is incredibly impressive for a center and shows you just how active he was on the defensive end. He’s regularly brought up in all time great defender conversations and was feared by every player venturing into the paint for 2 decades. Nah bruh you can’t just be saying anything and expect people to go along with it. That was a wild ass statement my boy.</p>

      <label for="li4wgcd" class="commentText"><p>A completely underrated moment in NBA history but also totally consistent with who David Robinson was as a human. Plucking a random number out of thin air but in, like, 90 percent of cases, a superstar MVP coming off an injury would not be hearing anything about a rookie coming in and taking their mantle. But that&rsquo;s exactly why the Twin Tower era worked.</p>

<p>If he wanted, I bet David Robinson could have come back in &lsquo;98, demanded his usual touches, and still dropped 25+ as The Man. But it would have been to the detriment of Tim Duncan and the team as a whole. He recognized that, accepted it, and ended up reaping two rings as a result.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that often, the guys who make those sacrifices do sometimes pay for it down the line, just because their statlines don&rsquo;t look as pretty as they could have (Isiah Thomas being another). But it&rsquo;s those kind of sacrifices that often build a winner.</p>

      <label for="li57vax" class="commentText"><p>I think you are a lil confused with how the 97-98 season went bro. So in 96-97 Rob missed the first like 20 games with a back injury then came back and broke his foot after only playing in 6 games and missed the rest of the season. This meant the spurs were trash that year and landed number 1 pick Tim Duncan. In Tims rookie season, D Rob came back from injury and averaged 22 and 12, was all nba 2nd team, 3rd in DPOY, and came in 7th in mvp voting. This same season tim had 1 of the greatest rookie seasons of all time and similar to Rob averaged 21 and 12. He won ROY, all nba 1st team, all defense, and came in 5th in mvp voting. The 1997-98 season saw one of the greatest seasons of all time by 2 players on the same team. Rob didnt really sacrifice any touches as the 2 of them put up crazy numbers and won multiple end of the season awards. They won the finals the very next season, being lead by the 2nd year Duncan. At that point, Rob at 33 years old was still a phenomenal defender and could score when needed but the injuries started to catch up with him and he noticeably had lost a step. I believe this is what made it easy for him to fully pass the mantle to future mvp Tim Duncan. He should absolutely be applauded for the way he treated and mentored Duncan but he still dominated Tim’s rookie season and didn’t sacrifice much of his game the way you said he did.</p>

      <label for="li599b3" class="commentText"><p>I lived that era, as it sounds like you did as well, so maybe we&rsquo;re just talking past one another here (having tickets to a Pistons-Spurs game in &lsquo;96-97 only for Robinson to break his foot just prior is still one of the great traumas of my youth).</p>

<p>I recall Robinson&rsquo;s willingness to share the main stage with Duncan being a thing right from the start. Perhaps I misspoke in suggesting that he ceded the floor altogether but that was not my intent. The vibe I recall is one in which Robinson <em>was</em> still a star but fully understood the long term assignment (that Duncan was the future as well as a good portion of the present).</p>

<p>Basically, when Robinson could have been, &ldquo;Wait your turn, young gun&rdquo;, he instead put his arm around Tim and said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get this done together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When you watched them play, especially peak Hakeem, he was better at everything.</p>

<p>He had better foot work, a better midrange. He was a better defender. I want to note here that Robinson was a GREAT defender, but he missed assignments and bit on plays where he was able to compensate for it and save himself with his athleticism. I saw guys beat him to the hole and then his recovery allowed him to contest of even block the shot. But Hakeem wasn&rsquo;t making the mistake in the first player.</p>

<p>And Hakeem was such an adept passer.</p>

<p>Both great, and it is a thin margin of difference, but it is a clear one.</p>

The admiral was phenomenal but he&rsquo;s a tier below Hakeem and Shaq. A top 30-40 player all time but Hakeem is a top 13-20 player all time.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t listen to me here. The admiral was way better than I was giving him credit for here. My bad.</p>

      <label for="li5jn8q" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I can&rsquo;t even say you&rsquo;re wrong about anything. DRobinson was incredible. I was alive and watched but just seemingly forgot how long he was great. 3rd all-time in WS per 48 mins. That&rsquo;s an amazing stat. He is definitely better than I rated him. Only thing that really knocks his legacy is not having that ring in his true prime. Hakeem winning two finals MVP&rsquo;s carries a lot of weight as well. Still, my previous comment vastly underrated Drob. My bad, Admiral if you&rsquo;re listening I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>

Hakeem was better at literally everything than Duncan: better rim protector and more versatile/mobile defender, better rebounder, better ball handler, better midrange shooter, better post and inside game and better scorer in general.</p>

<p>Duncan has a better career thanks to being drafted to a far superior and stable team situation where he got to play with multiple HOFs for almost 20 years all under a GOAT tier coach.</p>

That’s like saying if Curry and Dame swapped places they’d have the same results. How many times was Curry saved or carried? Kyrie/Love injury, Game 6 Klay, Draymond crying for Durant to join them, or having one of the winningest coach’s ever? Keep that same energy with your franchise goat when he could easily have 0 chips without the warriors organization.</p>

      <label for="li5j7hv" class="commentText"><p>Kinda like every superstar star with a successful career yes. Magic struggles w/o Kareem and a weak conference to compete in, Shaq wins nothing w/o Kobe + Wade, etc, etc.</p>

<p>Great careers are built in huge part due to outside factors. This can allow less impactful players to achieve more than better ones, like with Duncan and Hakeem. Dame isn&rsquo;t really on the same level of play as Curry though even w/o accolades, but the gap isn&rsquo;t as wide as their career achievements would suggest so it&rsquo;s still a decent example.</p>

<p>Lately, Hakeem is treated like second coming of Jesus on this sub, over the board compared to the way he was when he was playing. You&rsquo;d think he defended and dream shaked everyone every time. Great player without any doubt but far from current representation.</p>

<p>Back in the days it was a much closer conversation, closer then say Joker vs Embiid now. There was not soooo many talks on the subject though but that&rsquo;s due to day and age.</p>

      <label for="li519hr" class="commentText"><p>I’m sorry - what? He is 2x champion with Finals MVP in both runs, 12x all-nba, 2x DPOY, multiple time rebounds champ, multiple times block champ, AND averaged 33/10/5/3 in a championship playoff run.</p>

<p>How on earth do his accomplishments and stats not support an argument for him being a no-doubt top 10 player? At absolute WORST he is 11 or 12 depending on how you place Shaq and Kobe</p>

<p>End of the day - arguing over 10 vs 11-12 is silly and if that’s one of the “most overrated” takes in this sub then that means it’s incredibly accurate</p>
