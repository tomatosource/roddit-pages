</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Now that the Olympics are behind us, it&rsquo;s time to look ahead to the 2024-25 season.</p>

<p>In this series, we&rsquo;re going to preview each team (grouped by <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake" target="_blank">tiers</a> ). In terms of predictions, we&rsquo;re going to avoid hot takes or bold predictions for the sake of drama and simply go with the most realistic outcome. The truth of the matter is: the biggest differentiator between expected success and results tends to be injury related, so it&rsquo;s difficult to peer into the crystal ball on that front. We&rsquo;re also going to balance every team&rsquo;s wins to be an even .500 across the league, which is something most outlets don&rsquo;t bother to do.</p>

<p>So without further ado, let&rsquo;s cast a look at the pecking order in the <strong>WESTERN CONFERENCE.</strong></p>

<hr>

<hr>

<p>######<strong>TIER FOUR: MAN, IT SUCKS TO PLAY IN THE WEST</strong></p>

<p><strong>(9) LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS</strong></p>

<p><em>last season</em>: <strong>51-31</strong>, +3.3 point differential, # 5 seed</p>

<p><em>rankings</em>: 7th on offense, 17th on defense</p>

<p><em>regression</em>: In terms of health, last year&rsquo;s Clippers did about what you&rsquo;d expect; Kawhi Leonard&rsquo;s 68 games may even have been an overachievement. But all in all, around <strong>50 wins</strong> felt like the expected outcome from last year&rsquo;s roster.</p>

<p><em>subtractions</em>: SF Paul George, PG Russell Westbrook, C Mason Plumlee, C Daniel Theis</p>

<p><em>additions</em>: SF Derrick Jones Jr., PF Nic Batum, PG Kris Dunn, C Mo Bamba, PG Kevin Porter Jr.</p>

<p><em>outlook</em></p>

<p>They&rsquo;re still getting roasted over the coals for it, but the L.A. Clippers&rsquo; gamble on Kawhi Leonard and Paul George made perfect sense. They were able to acquire two superstars (both under 30 at the time) and still managed to put together depth around them. On paper, there were a few seasons where the Clippers had the best roster in the NBA. Alas, it didn&rsquo;t work out.</p>

<p>So what now&hellip; (after losing Paul George)? The Clippers aren&rsquo;t going into full tank mode, because their replacements for George are more in the &ldquo;veteran band-aid&rdquo; category like Derrick Jones Jr. and Nic Batum. James Harden is also one of the better stars in terms of making chicken salad out of chicken S; as long as he&rsquo;s playing, the team should have an above-average offense no matter what roster they trot out there.</p>

<p><em>swing player</em></p>

<p>The Clippers have some interesting pieces on the margins. It&rsquo;ll be fascinating to see if Kevin Porter Jr. can come back in and rehab his image and revive his career. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see if Kris Dunn can be unleashed with 25+ minutes and start to earn All-Defense recognition.</p>

<p>But of course, none of it really matters if <strong>Kawhi Leonard</strong> can&rsquo;t play. If he somehow makes it through the season and plays 70 games, this team can absolutely still win 50 games. But if he&rsquo;s broken beyond repair, then they&rsquo;ll be fighting tooth and nail to make the play-in range.</p>

<p><em>prediction</em></p>

<p>At this point, I don&rsquo;t know how you can bet on Kawhi Leonard&rsquo;s health. <strong>41-41</strong> is a pessimistic, but prudent, prediction as a result.</p>

<p><em>over/under</em></p>

<p>Vegas is just as confused and set this at 40.5. If you have an &ldquo;in&rdquo; with Kawhi&rsquo;s doctor, bet accordingly. If not, <strong>stay away</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(12) HOUSTON ROCKETS</strong></p>

<p><em>last season</em>: <strong>41-41</strong>, +1.1 point differential, # 11 seed</p>

<p><em>rankings</em>: 20th on offense, 9th on defense</p>

<p><em>regression</em>: You can make an argument that the Rockets were even better than .500 &ndash; they had a positive point differential and their best player Alperen Sengun missed 19 games. On the negative side, opponents&rsquo; shooting may be a red flag. Their opponents shot 76.7% from the line (second lowest) and 34.8% from three (lowest overall). We tend to think of that as &ldquo;good defense&rdquo; but stats suggest those regress to some degree. Given those rankings, <strong>40 wins</strong> may have been a more expected outcome.</p>

<p><em>subtractions</em>: SF Reggie Bullock</p>

<p><em>additions</em>: PG Reed Sheppard &reg;, SF A.J. Griffin</p>

<p><em>outlook</em></p>

<p>Ime Udoka deserved &ldquo;Coach of the Year&rdquo; consideration after taking over a team that ranked 29th in defense and vaulting them all the way up to 9th. Can they continue to build from there&hellip;? As mentioned in the regression section, opponents&rsquo; shooting should lead to some backslide.</p>

<p>But in terms of personnel, the team should be improved. Reed Sheppard should be as ready to contribute as any 20 year-old around. Getting a healthy version of Steven Adams and Tari Eason should also help inside. This will be a tough team to play night in and night out.</p>

<p><em>swing player</em></p>

<p>Alperen Sengun already made his leap &ndash; so who is next to join him? Can Jalen Green be consistent? Can Jabari Parker Jr. take a leap? What about <strong>Amen Thompson</strong> or Cam Whitmore? Among them all, Amen Thompson intrigues me the most. I&rsquo;m ready to lock in Reed Sheppard as part of a winning core, and Thompson&rsquo;s size, athleticism, (and shooting limitations) appear to make him the best complement to Sheppard&rsquo;s skill set.</p>

<p><em>prediction</em></p>

<p>The arrow is pointing up on the Rockets, but I&rsquo;d caution about hoping for too much, too soon (although I said the same about OKC last year). But still, the stubborn old man in me suggests <strong>39-43</strong> may be a realistic landing spot in this brutal Western Conference.</p>

<p><em>over/under</em></p>

<p>Vegas is buying into the Rockets&rsquo; ascension and set the line at 43.5. Given the factors laid out above, I&rsquo;d <strong>bet the UNDER.</strong> But again I&rsquo;m a guy who doubted OKC last year so take that with a few grains of salt.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(13) SAN ANTONIO SPURS</strong></p>

<p><em>last season</em>: <strong>22-60</strong>, -6.5 point differential, # 14 seed</p>

<p><em>rankings</em>: 26th on offense, 22nd on defense</p>

<p><em>regression</em>: That 22-60 record is ugly, but the Spurs&rsquo; point differential suggests this may have been closer to a <strong>25 win</strong> team all told.</p>

<p><em>subtractions</em>: SG Devonte&rsquo; Graham, SF Cedi Osman</p>

<p><em>additions</em>: SG Stephon Castle &reg;, PG Chris Paul, SF Harrison Barnes</p>

<p><em>outlook</em></p>

<p>Welcome to the Victor Wembanyama era. Wemby was even better than advertised as a rookie, finishing 2nd in DPOY. Year 2 may be a scary leap upward. LeBron James won Rookie of the Year &ndash; then vaulted to All-NBA (2nd team) in Year 2. Luka Doncic won Rookie of the Year &ndash; then vaulted to 1st team All-NBA in Year 2. It&rsquo;s very realistic to expect Wembanyama to be an All-NBA candidate in Year 2 if he stays healthy.</p>

<p>The pieces are in place now to take advantage of that, with two solid wings (Devin Vassell and Keldon Johnson) already in place and three more starting-level players coming in the door.</p>

<p><em>swing player</em></p>

<p>The biggest ceilings may be Victor Wembanyama and rookie Stephon Castle, but <strong>Keldon Johnson</strong> may be crucial to determining whether or not the Spurs can make a playoff push this particular year. Johnson looked like a valuable player in Year 3, averaging 17.0 PPG and shooting 39.8% from three. Three years later and it feels like he&rsquo;s stalled or even regressed some from there. If he can get his momentum back and take advantage of his opportunities and open shots, then the Spurs may be knocking at the door.</p>

<p><em>prediction</em></p>

<p>The Spurs will absolutely take a leap this year, but it&rsquo;s a question of how high that vertical gets. In the interest of being conservative, let&rsquo;s list that at <strong>34-48</strong>.</p>

<p><em>over/under</em></p>

<p>The Vegas line is 35.5 or 36.5 depending on the site, which shows a lot of respect for Victor Wembanyama. I&rsquo;d rather <strong>stay away</strong> and watch with curiosity from afar.</p>
