<p>not trying to shit on harden here or anything, good for him for hanging out with these kids for the day, but its very bizzare that you seem to think Harden is the only dude that has ever hung out with kids at a camp before. not to mention 99% of harden fans are completely unaware of this camp existing lol</p>

<p>he&rsquo;s popular because he put up monster numbers and won an MVP while scoring like 35 points per game. and because he has a super recognizable brand bc he has a giant beard and looks distinctly different from most other players. its not that deep lol</p>

<p>him doing drill for a couple hours has nothing to do whatsoever with why he is popular (not to mention that this was an adidas camp that he probably had some clause in his contract saying he had to attend and was also compensated handsomely for)</p>

<p>A lot of dribbling, step backs, jump shot, as athletic as he is, his game was a lot more relatable to people from other countries like China. During his prime, I’ve seen so many Chinese players playing exactly like Harden.
It’s why he is a lot more popular compared to players like Westbrook or Giannis, or even LeBron in Asian countries.</p>

<p>the point I was disagreeing with was the person above essentially making the point that &ldquo;omg the secret reason why harden is MASSIVELY popular, is because he occasionally goes to camps for 2 or 3 hours!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s popular for the exact same reasons that Lebron, Steph, Jokic, Giannis, etc, or any other perennial all star level player is popular&hellip;.
because theyre fucking dope and they do crazy shit on the basketball court that fascinates people&hellip;. footage of him doing drills with random italian kids that 99% of american harden fans are completely unaware of&hellip; is NOT the reason why he is &ldquo;freakishly popular&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that these sorts of things are &lsquo;why he&rsquo;s popular,&rsquo; but you&rsquo;d have to have followed Harden&rsquo;s career to pay attention to how much <strong>more</strong> he&rsquo;s doing these sorts of things than other players are and to know how ridiculous it is to say that 90% of players stack up to the stuff Harden does off the court with non-profits and his own initiatives thru his Impact13 foundation (which never used to have a name he just did stuff and barely ever had it reported lol)</p>

<p>When he got to Brooklyn, for instance, the like literal first thing he did when he got there was just pay to have some local courts restored and then hosted an event there for kids. Wasn&rsquo;t an adidas event, wasn&rsquo;t shoe sales, wasn&rsquo;t connected to the Brooklyn Nets, etc. That same year he was out handing out food on Thanksgiving at a shelter. Again, not a sponsored event, no team or affiliated companies etc.</p>

<p>I know a lot of these events are in peoples contracts, but Harden does a fuckload of this stuff <em>and more</em> on his own time and dollar all the time, especially in Houston and for Arizona (where he went to college) and he does a ton for female empowerment (please don&rsquo;t turn this into a strip club joke lmao) initiatives because of his mom</p>

<p>He does a ton of off the court charity work, a lot of it basketball related but a lot of it not, that I think he&rsquo;s earned a bit of distinction from &ldquo;only there to get paid&rdquo;</p>

<p>but its very bizzare that you seem to think Harden is the only dude that has ever hung out with kids at a camp before.</p>

<p>The rest of your post is fine, but this is beyond stupid.  The poster never implied anything close to that.  How can you come to that conclusion?</p>

He absolutely does shit like this out of the &ldquo;goodness of his heart&rdquo; all the time, whether or not this particular event was a paid one or not. He&rsquo;s literally the &lsquo;hand out food to the homeless on Thanksgiving&rsquo; type.</p>

<p>And this is not really related to the topic but how do you know he DEFINITELY more than your typical player does charity work? Im sure a lot of these players do charity work without involving media in the first place</p>

      <label for="l6snks5" class="commentText"><p>Harden <strong>does</strong> do unaffiliated camps though, and you&rsquo;re questioning whether or not he or other players do things without payment and shit attached to it. Why are you going back on that?</p>

<p>And I mean I pay attention to a lot of NBA stuff, follow lots of players on socials, etc, and I see Harden more involved and posting stories of him at charity events more than most other players. I also know locally what he&rsquo;s done around where I live and it&rsquo;s more than anyone else that has passed through this team.</p>

<p>Not sure what the point of contention is lol there are definitely players significantly more charitable than others and Harden is at the upper end of that list</p>

Whether it&rsquo;s guys running camps like this, other non-basketaball charity or community programs, or even just like that Tatum quote about showing up and playing in other cities whenever he can, all these things can be a huge difference maker for a kid or whoever.</p>
