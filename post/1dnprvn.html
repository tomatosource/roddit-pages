Seattle and Vegas’ will be announced during the all star game next year. Rules for the expansion draft will be announced during the 2025 summer meetings, then a bunch of filler hype for an entire year so ESPN and Fox can get as much speculation done as possible. Then in 2026 team branding will be revealed alongside the courts. Then in 2027 we will see a 32 team league with Minnesota in the East.</p>

<p>(And no, New Orleans doesn’t have a chance in hell of getting move. They were never in the conversation. It will be between Memphis and Minnesota.)</p>

      <label for="la4lbkw" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s a great coach but man that game 3 against the Mavs baffled me. Thats the game that everyone says Luka picked apart every p&amp;r coverage they threw at him but imo that&rsquo;s more because they panicked after game 1 and 2 and haphazardly just started trying stuff (and of course Lukas amazing) .</p>

<p>Mavs are the team where the phrase &ldquo;give something up and take away everything else&rdquo; matters the most. In Game 3 by panicking they ended up giving them <em>everything</em> by using schemes they hadn&rsquo;t used all series. Games 1 and 2 they settled for various different drop coverages with their bigs on kyrie and luka and tried to take away the roll man, then attempted to recover for the corner 3 (massive oversimplification of course)</p>

<p>it didn&rsquo;t work obviously, but there are small tweaks to be made within that system that make it possible, these happened in Game 4 (which was helped by a bad shooting night by kyrie and luka) but by that point their cushion was gone, a super Luka first half took them out of game 5 and there wasn&rsquo;t a game 6 for recovery.</p>

      <label for="la55t0p" class="commentText"><p>I honestly think it was an execution issue over a coaching issue. Like after Game 1, Mike Conley said &ldquo;any drop coverage you saw was in error. We were supposed to be up&rdquo;. <a href="https://x.com/JaceFrederick/status/1793499607005270350" target="_blank">Full quote here</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We were trying to take away the guards first and rely on the back side who can muddy up the roller and make it tougher for them to get those lobs. Sometimes we did it right, but there were points we gave up both. We just have to be better at both of those things&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wild to hear that because it looked like Wolves were running some variation of drop for a lot of that game&hellip; but it confirmed to me that something was off execution-wise. Normally against teams like the Mavs, the Wolves run high wall coverage with the bigs on the perimeter (I&rsquo;ve seen Wolves run a bunch of coverages all year, they don&rsquo;t just run drop. <a href="https://archive.ph/QJ4vq#selection-2955.0-2975.298:~:text=%27Biggie%20smalls%27,on%2Dball%20defense" target="_blank">The bigs switch and are used to being on the perimeter</a>, contrary to what people may think) so it was very strange seeing the team defend the way they did.</p>

<p>They all clearly weren&rsquo;t on the same page and there were miscommunications and missed assignments, which is unlike the team I watched all year. I was also surprised to see how slow they were in their rotations when Wolves normally pride themselves on being able to double and quickly recover to still contest everything. Ex: when Rudy stepped up to contest Luka, the wings were too slow to rotate back to Rudy&rsquo;s original man and bam - Luka dishes a lob. Rinse and repeat. They are usually faster in rotations (which was evident all season and in the first 2 rounds) so it was bizarre to watch.</p>

<p>I just think they weren&rsquo;t prepared like they were in the first 2 rounds (1 day of gameplanning prep vs 1 week/multiple days) and weren&rsquo;t conditioned to sustain the energy and speed their defense requires for a deep run. But moreover, the issue was less defense and more offense. The difference between Game 4 and other games was Ant was driving to the rim more and KAT made his shots.</p>

<p>But then, isn&rsquo;t this also an indictment on the coaching to some degree? If the players are that consistently failing to execute the game plan, and across multiple games, part of that has to be on the coaching staff, even with the context you included. And I&rsquo;m saying this as a Wolves and Finch fan.</p>

<p>But also, it’s Luka and Kyrie, man defense is gonna look dumb against them especially if our players aren’t at their best. Hopefully our defensive minds take a look at what didn&rsquo;t work and take steps to fix it (i think its totally possible with our personnel)</p>

<p>Offensively, we need a different look. Its a long long shot but imagine Borrego as an assistant. Wet dream</p>

      <label for="la4y8oj" class="commentText"><p>I actually thought he coached <em>fine</em> in the Mavs series, it just seemed guys were gassed from the nuggets series and making mental errors. Games 1+2 really just came down to the Mavs having Luka/Kyrie in crunch time vs the Wolves relying solely on a hobbled/tired 22yo Ant.</p>

<p>The offense needed work, but that was suspect all season long. Now that the defense is established and the team is mostly the same hopefully they can focus on the offense this offseason.</p>

<p>We shot like shit and were exhausted by the Denver series. We&rsquo;ll beat you next year if we face you in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="la56x3c" class="commentText"><p>Yeah Memphis was a bad series, but that was also Finch&rsquo;s first stint in the playoffs and our main decision makers were Dlo, KAT and a 20 year old Ant and they were not very high IQ in that series to say the least lol. I think that was series was more of a personnel issue - we lacked size, rim protection and got KILLED on the boards which is a big reason they traded for Gobert.</p>

<p>In the Mavs series, I think it was an execution issue more than a coaching issue. Like after Game 1, Mike Conley said &ldquo;any drop coverage you saw was in error. We were supposed to be up&rdquo;. <a href="https://x.com/JaceFrederick/status/1793499607005270350" target="_blank">Full quote here</a></p>

<p>It looked like they weren&rsquo;t on the same page and there were miscommunications and missed assignments, which is unlike the team I watched all year and in the first 2 rounds. I was also surprised to see how slow they were in their rotations when Wolves normally pride themselves on being able to double and quickly recover to still contest everything. Ex: when Rudy stepped up to contest Luka, the wings were too slow to rotate back to Rudy&rsquo;s original man and bam - Luka dishes a lob. Rinse and repeat. They are usually faster in rotations (which was evident all season and in the first 2 rounds) so it was bizarre to watch. I just think they weren&rsquo;t prepared like they were in the first 2 rounds (1 day of gameplanning prep vs 1 week/multiple days) and weren&rsquo;t conditioned to sustain the energy and speed their defense requires for a deep run. TBF Mavs are also a fast paced team so I think this exacerbated the execution/conditioning issues.</p>

<p>But moreover, the issue was less defense and more offense/clutch decision making.</p>

<p>Frankly he got pretty exposed by Jason Kidd of all people in the conference finals.</p>

      <label for="la4ak56" class="commentText"><p>Reports from inside the Wolves organization leaked the other day due to the ongoing dispute between the ownership Parties. The leaked game plan involves targeting Luka once he starts driving towards the paint. As this happens, Assistant Coach Micah Nori will shoot him until he stops moving. Once Luka is confirmed to be deceased, Timberwolves mascot, Crunch, will come out and properly dispose of the body.</p>

<p>Please note that the above information is just the Timberwolves first plan, and a revision may follow up that may drastically change their current strategy.</p>
