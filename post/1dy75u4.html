      <label for="lc6ibec" class="commentText"><p>When I was first getting truly into basketball, I remember watching a Hornets game and everytime Jefferson got the ball in the post, he would waste 10 seconds just standing there and slowly turning around. And then he scored almost every single time. It was right then and there that I realized that the best player in basketball wasn&rsquo;t Lebron. It wasn&rsquo;t Kobe. It wasn&rsquo;t Durant. It was Al Jefferson.</p>

      <label for="lc6u9l1" class="commentText"><p>Yeah Okafor was on my &ldquo;do not draft under any circumstances&rdquo; list after seeing what had happened to Big Al in 2015. He had only lost half a step due to injury, but it was as the league was also changing. I watched teams game plan against us totally differently.</p>

<p>You can get away with being a one dimensional post scorer if you are EXTREMELY good at it. If you are simply very good in the post and deficient elsewhere, you wind up being Greg Monroe. In my mind, Okafor, like every other post-only big man drafted in the 2010s, had a 10% chance of being a star and a 70% chance of being a bench player or just completely discarded. Anybody who had a player of that archetype in the 2015 season (Al, Monroe, Kanter, etc) saw that coming from a mile away. Of them, only Brook Lopez completely revamped his game and extended his career by a decade by becoming a shot blocking 3-point shooter. The rest got left in the dust.</p>

      <label for="lc6xwc0" class="commentText"><p>He was never a dominant post scorer though. His efficiency was at best average and at worst -3% below average TS%. Combined with his utter lack of playmaking meant that he was basically a liability to any offense with aspirations to be better than 10th best OFF Rating. While he was picking up a scattering of MVP votes in 2014 his team&rsquo;s offense was ranked 24th. It&rsquo;s more an indictment of how poorly people understood efficiency and how poor the average NBA offense scheme was with ball movement and motion.</p>

<p>Most possessions Jokic will wait for a double or a cutter and make that play. Big Al just scored over two or three guys with his array of moves, but his head was down. He never was going to kick it.</p>

<p>You get taken out of the game pretty quickly playing with guys you know aren’t ever kicking it. Hard to build a team around that style.</p>

      <label for="lc6uwyh" class="commentText"><p>Seriously. You can&rsquo;t rely on it as often as Al did, big men have to be more dynamic than he was able to be at his size and better at distributing, but the skillset is still incredibly useful. I&rsquo;m surprised that there isn&rsquo;t a big man out here keeping Al Jefferson on retainer to pick up tricks of the trade lol, literally every big man in the league could benefit from learning how to use their feet like this.</p>

<p>I don’t think he was actually the best big man in the world and that’s not what I said, but in that stretch he was as good as anyone. In MVP voting for the whole season he finished third among bigs behind Blake Griffin and Joakim Noah, and he averaged 8 or 9 more points the second half of the year</p>

      <label for="lc721c7" class="commentText"><p>Luis Scola, although smaller and with a shorter wingspan, seemed to be a better low post player than Al.  When Luis got the ball he would not waste time, he would immediately go for the shot or pass it back out.  Luis was way underappreciated.</p>
