</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>For example, Allen Iverson. In his own era he was the definition of a superstar both on the court and off. Widely recognized as a top 5 player in the world and one of the best scorers ever. But the rise of analytics have made many people today see him in a different light, as an inefficient chucker even by the standards of the early 2000s</p>

<p>Any other examples?</p>

      <label for="l8rtokc" class="commentText"><p>If you&rsquo;re saying he was 80% or Jordan of D before his knee injuries, I agree. He was absolutely in the same league defensively as Jordan. Offensively, he didn&rsquo;t have the same control or versatility. Nor was he as good of a shooter.</p>

<p>At his very best, pre-injury Ron Harper topped out at 4.8 VORP, not top-10 in the league. The worst Jordan season (full season) before his stint with the Wiz his VORP was 7.1. That was his rookie season. 80% of Jordan&rsquo;s rookie season VORP was 5.8.</p>

<p>At least according to VORP &ndash; and my own eyes; I was there as a fan for both guys&rsquo; entire careers &ndash; I feel very comfortable with my assessment that Ron Harper at his very best was still well south of 80% of Jordan.</p>

He was putting up 25/5/4/1/1 on .45/.40/.80 splits in an era when entire teams were averaging ~98 pts per game. Basically the same stat line and electrifying play style at about the same age as Ant this year but slightly more efficient and again in an era that was scoring 15-20% fewer pts per game.</p>

      <label for="l8r6e9u" class="commentText"><p>It was a different time. Advanced stats weren&rsquo;t what they are today and your average fan certainly wasn&rsquo;t aware of them. </p>

<p>T-Mac wasn&rsquo;t yet the version of himself that we remember and was bounced unceremoniously in the first round during his tenure with Orlando. </p>

<p>Ray Allen averaged fewer points and was derided as a jump shooter in an era where you would constantly hear &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t win as a jump shooting team.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Iverson was electric, but even back then you would hear people talk about him being an inefficient chucker because he absolutely had games where he&rsquo;d shoot 8-30. That, and you had the league&rsquo;s&hellip; oh, let&rsquo;s say &ldquo;hesitance&rdquo;&hellip; to promote him as the post-MJ face of the NBA.  </p>

<p>So that really just leaves Vince and Kobe who were kind of the golden children of the league, and which of them would be the next MJ was a big topic in the media. Kobe was criticised for chucking too, but also because he was playing with Shaq in an era where being &ldquo;the guy&rdquo; and having &ldquo;your team&rdquo; was a big, big deal in how a player was perceived. Of course, winning solves everything and the Lakers&rsquo; three-peat did help ease that somewhat (until 2004 but that&rsquo;s an entirely different conversation). </p>

<p>But Vince was doing jaw-dropping stuff every night as the undisputed number one of the team. I would go so far as to say he might have the largest flashy highlight reel of all time. And presentation is a huge chunk of how you are perceived by the public. So if you&rsquo;ve got 5 guys all putting up similar numbers people are going to gravitate towards the one who is doing it with style. Right or wrong it boosts your stock as a player. </p>

<p>Further removed from the emotion of the time, with the benefit of hindsight, and with what came later in their careers we can say that maybe those guys were better players, but in the moment it was certainly arguable that Vince was as good as any of them.</p>

      <label for="l8rdbjj" class="commentText"><p>The coverage at the time may dispute my memory, but I always viewed VC as a highlight machine that lacked the toughness, the ability to impose his will on a game, that great players had. A little empty stats, good enough for a team to be good, not good enough to be The Guy for a championship team, player.</p>

<p>During his career, nobody ever thought of him as an all-timer, much less compared to Kobe. No matter what he did, you could see the ability, but you wanted more from VC</p>

People don&rsquo;t remember this now, but injuries really derailed his insane athleticism and forced him to become a different player by the time he hit his mid 20s.</p>

He also only missed 10 games in like an 18 year period, and 3 of those were due to a suspension. He&rsquo;s a reprehensible character but some of his accomplishments as a player are simply mind-boggling.</p>

      <label for="l8rj1de" class="commentText"><p>League average is what to look at because his team is gonna have a higher average due to him scoring more.</p>

<p>League average dipped below 100ppg in his 10th year which means he spent half his career with that.</p>

<p>But it dipped every year since his rookie season. So while not mostly it is still a big factor and boost to his impressiveness</p>

There was a point where KD was considered the next in line to carry the torch after LeBron. Curry ended up pretty much displacing KD in terms of cultural importance and impact on the history of the game. And the further we get from KDs prime and the more amazing players start popping up (Jokic, Giannis, Luka, Wemby etc) the less and less remembered KD will be.</p>

      <label for="l8qz0s8" class="commentText"><p>I agree Durant’s reputation is sure to diminish in “all-time” conversations. It’s at a high now because we’re still at the tail end of his prime. </p>

<p>The NBA has so many all-time greats, and 99% were incredible scorers. So the differentiator has to be beyond scoring, either/or 1) Being all-time at other things and 2) A special record of championships as the leader, or maybe 3) Being the icon for a particular franchise.  </p>

<p>Durant has only ever been elite at scoring and we all know his championship situation. </p>

<p>To those who say it won’t happen I have to just ask if you’re old enough to have seen multiple eras and how reputations change. If not you’ll have to take it on faith when I say how iron-clad the reputations of guys like Malone, Stockton, Iverson, Scottie Pippen, David Robinson etc etc seemed.</p>

<p>Now people think of every reason to say X player from this era is better than them. It’s going to happen to Durant too.</p>

<p>Thats why when they did the rookie surveys of “who is your favourite player in the league” he lead that survey from 2014-2016, even ahead of Kobe Bryant who is the most culturally relevant player since MJ.</p>

<p>They don’t do a survey anymore that we can see, but all of the best young players look up to him. They grew up on his 4 scoring titles.</p>

      <label for="l8r4ffs" class="commentText"><p>Jerry West very well could be in the GOAT conversation.  He isn’t talked about in this manner because of the losses in the finals, but he was that good.<br>
Ring culture overtakes these conversations.  However, championships are Team Accomplishments.</p>

<p>We can see how important context and the surrounding team affects success when we look at a player like KG(Another player who should be in the GOAT debate).  Those Minnesota Teams were so bereft of talent.  Mostly laughable NBA talent outside of Garnett.  Little success besides a Western Conf. Finals appearance in 04.  He goes to Boston (past his prime, after 12 years in the league) and immediately wins a ring.  Same player, different context.</p>

<p>Also, remember when Jordan left the Bulls in 93-94?  The Bulls won 55 games.  Pippen was in MVP conversations.  The point is, that team was really fucking good even without Jordan.</p>

<p>How would some of the greats be remembered if you placed them on rosters that were already championship contenders without them?</p>

<p>We often over index on team success when evaluating a players individual value.  Most players don’t construct their rosters.  There are many great players that we forget to mention in the highest pantheon because of team success or failure.</p>

He was considered one of the elite players in his day, but I&rsquo;ve heard in recent times that some people think West&rsquo;s playmaking should partly be credited for the stats Baylor put up.

      <label for="l8rp8hs" class="commentText"><p>There are just so many compounding factors when it comes to Dr. J&rsquo;s career that it&rsquo;s hard to rank him. He played in a league with a shit ton of drug use, and players seasons could be turned around because they stopped smoking and eating hot dogs every half time, and on top of that played in the league with inferior talent for his best years, and for someone with so much athleticism his rebounding being cut in half between his rookie season and his NBA MVP season is wild, and having only one all defensive team to his name is a bit head scratching.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>But at the same time, the guy was the coolest person on the planet, was a winner, a major part of one of the greatest teams of all time (Philly in &lsquo;83), had longevity even after some substantial injuries in an era where that was REALLY rare, and is one of the greatest dunkers of all time. He transcended the game into pop culture, and is definitely viewed as a legend, but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll ever be in GOAT conversations like he may have been earlier in his career.</p>

<p>Of all the players from before I was born, he is my favorite. His athleticism was otherworldly, and I can&rsquo;t think of any other player with his combination of grace and power.</p>

To bring a bit of balance to the discourse, people talked about how Steph gets his teammates easy shots which is a factor in the efficiency gap(which was huge anyway)</p>

<p>But then Steph won in 22, and people just took it to the max and started to make out like KD didn’t deserve any credit and all of the gap was explainable by gravity. It wasn’t.</p>

      <label for="l8qtw85" class="commentText"><p>That’s a surface level way of looking at it though obviously. It misses a lot of context, specifically in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Was Durants 35/10/5 on 59% TS including a 49 point game on 80% TS against the champs not good enough to win a ring because Harden done his hamstring and Kyrie got stepped on by Giannis?</p>

<p>In a similar manner, I could say Kobe won as the #1 without Shaq, while Shaq only won again as #2 to Wade. But that would be stripping all the context away.</p>

<p>Steph doing a good thing years later doesn’t reverse those 2 years.</p>

But dude was a pure bucket getter before the injuries. In his prime he was easily one of the best scorers ever. There’s a reason he’s top 10 all time. But people like to call him ass when he really wasn’t. One dimensional for sure. But dude was a beast. He’s one of the players I feel like if they retired a bit earlier than they did they’d be remembered way better. </p>

<p>Big Ben was great, but everyone overlooks Chauncey&rsquo;s role as a leader, floor general, and efficient scorer in a low-offense era. I see a lot of people say Chauncey didn&rsquo;t deserve Finals MVP in 2004, but he put up 21 ppg on 51/47/93 shooting splits. Insane.</p>

<p>And when we traded for him, he instantly made us a serious team for the first time in the Melo era. It&rsquo;s no coincidence Melo never won a playoff series before we got Chauncey.</p>

<p>The Pau era and the Heatles helped his reputation nationwide, because when the Heatles got together there was this mindset like &ldquo;Kobe would never do some shit like that.&rdquo;</p>

Really you could answer a bunch of 80s Nuggets who were consistently really good but stuck in an era dominated by dynasties. Could have seen them sneaking though one year in this era.</p>

<p>90s - I’d like to save Mitch Richmond’s rep. Somehow he’s now the bar for worst HoF. I’d definitely take him over Vince Carter and any number of guys.</p>

<p>00s - Elton Brand maybe? Just solid guy. I think his reputation problem is that he was a 90s mold PF and didn’t have that feeling like an Amare or Marion where people will say how they’d be so much better now.</p>
