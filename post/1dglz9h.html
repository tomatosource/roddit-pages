</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>For example, Allen Iverson. In his own era he was the definition of a superstar both on the court and off. Widely recognized as a top 5 player in the world and one of the best scorers ever. But the rise of analytics have made many people today see him in a different light, as an inefficient chucker even by the standards of the early 2000s</p>

<p>Any other examples?</p>

My papaw used to go to jazz games and would talk about all the time how stock would just throw an entry pass to Malone who would do a couple dribbles gain position and he’d get credit for the assist. Of course both of them are one of dem HOFers but Stock doesn’t get his assists without Malone and I’m p sure Malone woulda had his with any sort of PG that could throw entries to him</p>

He also only missed 10 games in like an 18 year period, and 3 of those were due to a suspension. He&rsquo;s a reprehensible character but some of his accomplishments as a player are simply mind-boggling.</p>

      <label for="l8r6e9u" class="commentText"><p>It was a different time. Advanced stats weren&rsquo;t what they are today and your average fan certainly wasn&rsquo;t aware of them. </p>

<p>T-Mac wasn&rsquo;t yet the version of himself that we remember and was bounced unceremoniously in the first round during his tenure with Orlando. </p>

<p>Ray Allen averaged fewer points and was derided as a jump shooter in an era where you would constantly hear &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t win as a jump shooting team.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Iverson was electric, but even back then you would hear people talk about him being an inefficient chucker because he absolutely had games where he&rsquo;d shoot 8-30. That, and you had the league&rsquo;s&hellip; oh, let&rsquo;s say &ldquo;hesitance&rdquo;&hellip; to promote him as the post-MJ face of the NBA.  </p>

<p>So that really just leaves Vince and Kobe who were kind of the golden children of the league, and which of them would be the next MJ was a big topic in the media. Kobe was criticised for chucking too, but also because he was playing with Shaq in an era where being &ldquo;the guy&rdquo; and having &ldquo;your team&rdquo; was a big, big deal in how a player was perceived. Of course, winning solves everything and the Lakers&rsquo; three-peat did help ease that somewhat (until 2004 but that&rsquo;s an entirely different conversation). </p>

<p>But Vince was doing jaw-dropping stuff every night as the undisputed number one of the team. I would go so far as to say he might have the largest flashy highlight reel of all time. And presentation is a huge chunk of how you are perceived by the public. So if you&rsquo;ve got 5 guys all putting up similar numbers people are going to gravitate towards the one who is doing it with style. Right or wrong it boosts your stock as a player. </p>

<p>Further removed from the emotion of the time, with the benefit of hindsight, and with what came later in their careers we can say that maybe those guys were better players, but in the moment it was certainly arguable that Vince was as good as any of them.</p>

There was a point where KD was considered the next in line to carry the torch after LeBron. Curry ended up pretty much displacing KD in terms of cultural importance and impact on the history of the game. And the further we get from KDs prime and the more amazing players start popping up (Jokic, Giannis, Luka, Wemby etc) the less and less remembered KD will be.</p>

He won’t be forgotten quickly and paved the way for these freaks we are seeing like Wemby and Chet</p>

<p>Anthony Edwards, Chet and Wemby who are possibly the 3 best young players in the league, he’s their idols. Hes Tatums idol. Etc.</p>

<p>Steph is relevant for smaller guys who wanna shoot 3s, but bigger guys all look up to Durant. And the NBA is mostly bigger players.</p>

The fact is curry has changed the way young people approach the game. Growing up if you shot 3s in a game in high school you would most likely get benched. That’s not a thing anymore.</p>

<p>Durant might be more relatable to the hundreds of tall nba players, but curry is 100% more relatable to the millions of regular sized fans that watch the game.</p>

<p>There is no way Durant has the same level of cultural significance as Curry.</p>

<p>I do think that the general point of Curry overtaking Durant as one of the preeminent faces of the NBA is true. Once KD left and curry won again it cemented the Warriors and it’s dynasty as mostly Curry’s impact, and the 2015-2022 era as mostly his and LeBron’s era in retrospect.</p>

      <label for="l8qz0s8" class="commentText"><p>I agree Durant’s reputation is sure to diminish in “all-time” conversations. It’s at a high now because we’re still at the tail end of his prime. </p>

<p>The NBA has so many all-time greats, and 99% were incredible scorers. So the differentiator has to be beyond scoring, either/or 1) Being all-time at other things and 2) A special record of championships as the leader, or maybe 3) Being the icon for a particular franchise.  </p>

<p>Durant has only ever been elite at scoring and we all know his championship situation. </p>

<p>To those who say it won’t happen I have to just ask if you’re old enough to have seen multiple eras and how reputations change. If not you’ll have to take it on faith when I say how iron-clad the reputations of guys like Malone, Stockton, Iverson, Scottie Pippen, David Robinson etc etc seemed.</p>

<p>Now people think of every reason to say X player from this era is better than them. It’s going to happen to Durant too.</p>

<p>Thats why when they did the rookie surveys of “who is your favourite player in the league” he lead that survey from 2014-2016, even ahead of Kobe Bryant who is the most culturally relevant player since MJ.</p>

<p>They don’t do a survey anymore that we can see, but all of the best young players look up to him. They grew up on his 4 scoring titles.</p>

      <label for="l8r112a" class="commentText"><p>Melo gets some of the most disrespect imo. Yeah he didn’t win and he was extremely one dimensional. But dude was a pure bucket getter before the injuries. In his prime he was easily one of the best scorers ever. There’s a reason he’s top 10 all time. But people like to call him ass when he really wasn’t. One dimensional for sure. But dude was a beast. He’s one of the players I feel like if they retired a bit earlier than they did they’d be remembered way better. </p>

      <label for="l8r4ffs" class="commentText"><p>Jerry West very well could be in the GOAT conversation.  He isn’t talked about in this manner because of the losses in the finals, but he was that good.<br>
Ring culture overtakes these conversations.  However, championships are Team Accomplishments.</p>

<p>We can see how important context and the surrounding team affects success when we look at a player like KG(Another player who should be in the GOAT debate).  Those Minnesota Teams were so bereft of talent.  Mostly laughable NBA talent outside of Garnett.  Little success besides a Western Conf. Finals appearance in 04.  He goes to Boston (past his prime, after 12 years in the league) and immediately wins a ring.  Same player, different context.</p>

<p>Also, remember when Jordan left the Bulls in 93-94?  The Bulls won 55 games.  Pippen was in MVP conversations.  The point is, that team was really fucking good even without Jordan.</p>

<p>How would some of the greats be remembered if you placed them on rosters that were already championship contenders without them?</p>

<p>We often over index on team success when evaluating a players individual value.  Most players don’t construct their rosters.  There are many great players that we forget to mention in the highest pantheon because of team success or failure.</p>

To bring a bit of balance to the discourse, people talked about how Steph gets his teammates easy shots which is a factor in the efficiency gap(which was huge anyway)</p>

<p>But then Steph won in 22, and people just took it to the max and started to make out like KD didn’t deserve any credit and all of the gap was explainable by gravity. It wasn’t.</p>

      <label for="l8qtw85" class="commentText"><p>That’s a surface level way of looking at it though obviously. It misses a lot of context, specifically in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Was Durants 35/10/5 on 59% TS including a 49 point game on 80% TS against the champs not good enough to win a ring because Harden done his hamstring and Kyrie got stepped on by Giannis?</p>

<p>In a similar manner, I could say Kobe won as the #1 without Shaq, while Shaq only won again as #2 to Wade. But that would be stripping all the context away.</p>

<p>Steph doing a good thing years later doesn’t reverse those 2 years.</p>

      <label for="l8qu6pm" class="commentText"><p>Also I think the context people left out was that 2022 KD who got shut down in the Celtics series was physically slower than his prime because of the Achilles injury</p>

<p>He still had great regular season numbers but in a playoff setting the fact that he was so reliant on jumpers and was barely getting to the rim anymore was a weakness because it makes him easier to gameplan for with less variety</p>

<p>This is the issue with the &ldquo;KD at his best got swept by the Celtics while Steph won the title against them&rdquo; talk because only one of them was at still 90-95% of his physical prime</p>

<p>Only this past season did we see the same trend with Steph&rsquo;s rim attempts declining</p>

<p>You do have a point that Steph’s 2023 vs the Lakers wasn’t actually that much better than KD’s but he’s still able to lead a higher functioning offense as the main fulcrum due to his passing ball handling and general navigation of tight defense.</p>

<p>KD’s lack of passing ability and somewhat one dimensional outside shooting game has shown up again and again and again when faced with defenses that can push him off his spots. When his rim pressure fell off so did his claim to being an elite offensive engine.</p>

<p>Shaq 3 peated with LA, made the finals in Orlando and won a ring in Miami .</p>

<p>Hakeem won B2B with the rockets</p>

      <label for="l8qs665" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s complicated. On one hand he was getting Jordan comparisons from some people, but on the other he was really polarizing and public enemy #1 for a little while there (especially during the time between the Shaq and Pau eras). He had a me-first reputation and was not exactly beloved by non-Laker fans.</p>

<p>The Pau era and the Heatles helped his reputation nationwide, because when the Heatles got together there was this mindset like &ldquo;Kobe would never do some shit like that.&rdquo;</p>
