</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>For example, Allen Iverson. In his own era he was the definition of a superstar both on the court and off. Widely recognized as a top 5 player in the world and one of the best scorers ever. But the rise of analytics have made many people today see him in a different light, as an inefficient chucker even by the standards of the early 2000s</p>

<p>Any other examples?</p>

He was putting up 25/5/4/1/1 on .45/.40/.80 splits in an era when entire teams were averaging ~98 pts per game. Basically the same stat line and electrifying play style at about the same age as Ant this year but slightly more efficient and again in an era that was scoring 15-20% fewer pts per game.</p>

On one hand he was getting Jordan comparisons from some people, but on the other he was really polarizing and public enemy #1 for a little while there (especially during the time between the Shaq and Pau eras). He had a me-first reputation and was not exactly beloved by non-Laker fans.</p>

<p>The Pau era and the Heatles helped his reputation nationwide, because when the Heatles got together there was this mindset like &ldquo;Kobe would never do some shit like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But then Steph won in 22, and people just took it to the max and started to make out like KD didn’t deserve any credit and all of the gap was explainable by gravity. It wasn’t.</p>

      <label for="l8qu6pm" class="commentText"><p>Also I think the context people left out was that 2022 KD who got shut down in the Celtics series was physically slower than his prime because of the Achilles injury</p>

<p>He still had great regular season numbers but in a playoff setting the fact that he was so reliant on jumpers and was barely getting to the rim anymore was a weakness because it makes him easier to gameplan for with less variety</p>

<p>This is the issue with the &ldquo;KD at his best got swept by the Celtics while Steph won the title against them&rdquo; talk because only one of them was at still 90-95% of his physical prime</p>

<p>Only this past season did we see the same trend with Steph&rsquo;s rim attempts declining</p>

<p>They also had no Harden who they’d traded a lot of
their depth for and was the only natural playmaker.</p>

      <label for="l8qtw85" class="commentText"><p>That’s a surface level way of looking at it though obviously. It misses a lot of context, specifically in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Was Durants 35/10/5 on 59% TS including a 49 point game on 80% TS against the champs not good enough to win a ring because Harden done his hamstring and Kyrie got stepped on by Giannis?</p>

<p>In a similar manner, I could say Kobe won as the #1 without Shaq, while Shaq only won again as #2 to Wade. But that would be stripping all the context away.</p>

<p>Steph doing a good thing years later doesn’t reverse those 2 years.</p>

      <label for="l8qt2tu" class="commentText"><p>Kevin Durant. There was a point where LeBron and KD were considered 1A and 1B by many people. There was a point where KD was considered the next in line to carry the torch after LeBron. Curry ended up pretty much displacing KD in terms of cultural importance and impact on the history of the game. And the further we get from KDs prime and the more amazing players start popping up (Jokic, Giannis, Luka, Wemby etc) the less and less remembered KD will be.</p>

      <label for="l8qwsrs" class="commentText"><p>Curry did overtake KD on a lot of all time lists after the 22 ring, but to say KD doesn’t have a lot of cultural relevance(at least as much as Curry) is inaccurate. He won’t be forgotten quickly and paved the way for these freaks we are seeing like Wemby and Chet</p>

<p>Anthony Edwards, Chet and Wemby who are possibly the 3 best young players in the league, he’s their idols. Hes Tatums idol. Etc.</p>

<p>Steph is relevant for smaller guys who wanna shoot 3s, but bigger guys all look up to Durant. And the NBA is mostly bigger players.</p>
