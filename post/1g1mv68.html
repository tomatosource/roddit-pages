      <label for="lrhofio" class="commentText"><p>This is going to make a lot of people clown on me and maybe deservedly so.</p>

<p>But despite the fact that I probably spend more time following the draft and the draft process than anything else with basketball&hellip; I was super not sold on Anthony Edwards</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t think he was going to be a bust in the traditional sense&hellip;. But I definitely didn&rsquo;t think he was going to be a star either. He was pretty underwhelming at Georgia, I watched all of his games and I just really wasn&rsquo;t sold on his basketball IQ, he was extremely inefficient, and really didn&rsquo;t give two flying f&rsquo;s on defense. Then you factor in some of his comments leading up to the draft and the draft process, kind of making it seem like he was a less than serious person when it came to the game, and I really expected him to top out as a good starter, but someone who definitely shouldn&rsquo;t have gone number one in the draft.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still early in his career but I think it&rsquo;s quite clear I was very much underestimating how terrible his college situation was (He was on a terrible team that clearly brought out some of his less desirable traits as a prospect)  And also underestimating the fact that he wasn&rsquo;t simply a great athlete, he&rsquo;s a borderline outlier athlete.</p>

<p>The kids clearly a star and all the tape and film in the world didn&rsquo;t convince me that that was a likely possibility on draft night.</p>

<p>I never claimed he was going to be a &ldquo;bust&rdquo; in the Anthony Bennett fashion but never imagined he would get as far as he got, for example securing a spot in a heavily talented US Olympic team and being important in some minutes of the tournament, that is above my early expectations.</p>

He&rsquo;s made some really ignorant comments about the referees at some of his games, and I still don&rsquo;t think he is as efficient as he needs to be to eventually be considered for an MVP award. I think this upcoming season is a really big opportunity for him to bust out even more than he already has.</p>

      <label for="lri43y3" class="commentText"><p>I get you. People forget that outliers are supposed to be statistically negligible. There are NBA players lining the benches of the league - Javonte Green, Derrick Jones Jr. - who can slam their head into the rim from the free throw line. There is ridiculous quickness from every guard below 6&rsquo;2&rdquo;, hand-eye coordination of guys like Derrick White and Mikal Bridges. They&rsquo;re all outliers in the general population but not within the 500 player set of the NBA.</p>

That one really hurt cause Halliburton was projected to go as high as 4th overall and Smith was supposed to go like 18th or some shit. Like you knew as soon as it was announced it was a bad move. Vassell was right there too.</p>

<p>Honestly should have been a fireable offense for James Jones if he didn’t orchestrate the CP3 trade and draft Cam Johnson the years before.</p>

      <label for="lrilo36" class="commentText"><p>yeah, people underrate the jay picks quite a bit as good moves from ainge because “oh it was the #3 overall pick”, but they were both considered “2 person drafts” at the time with the jays not being the popular picks form 3rd (dunn and josh jackson were that from my memory, guys like bender were in the mix). a lot of people in ainge&rsquo;s position would absolutely not have gotten both, many would get 0</p>

      <label for="lriaen2" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I thought they were both going to be good players, but I didn&rsquo;t see them getting to the level they&rsquo;re at now, especially Jaylen. I&rsquo;d kind of thought he hit his ceiling in 2020— 20 PPG with good on-ball defense, a very good 3rd option but not quite a star— but then literally the next year he developed a midrange game and became an All-Star, then just kept getting better from there. We knew he had a great work ethic, but that level of skill development is <em>really</em> rare for guys with his draft profile.</p>

<p>With Tatum, I knew he had star potential, but I kind of thought he&rsquo;d top out at like borderline All-NBA— I just thought his rim finishing would never be good enough, because of his smallish hands and lack of vertical explosiveness (issues that still come up occasionally tbh). It turned out he just needed to bulk up so he could out-muscle wings to the rim.</p>

<p>Boy was I glad to be wrong though lol</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s hard to measure when you&rsquo;re drafting someone. If they&rsquo;re actually gonna work as hard as necessary to fulfill what their natural talent dictates</p>

<p>it’s nice to be able to say that about your team’s stars, bc there are some extremely talented players in this league who don’t seem as focused and dedicated to the game and their bodies as much as JT and JB have shown themselves to be</p>

<p>That Chino Hills team was SOOOOO fucking good. They had the three ball brothers, Okeke and then a couple other players who played D1 and professionally overseas</p>

<p>It was barely basketball tho… they basically were so good they would always have one person cherry picking and just chuck shots and dunk it. One of the best high school teams ever</p>

<p>I thought the little brother was just a gimmick and had no chance at the league. I thought Lonzo would be the best and then LiAngelo and then LaMelo. Obviously injuries fucked up lonzos career but Melo will be the best</p>

      <label for="lrhtbgn" class="commentText"><p>Jaylen brown seemed like a reach at 3 at the time, and then did not look good his rookie year. He averaged 6 points a game and shot 68% from the free throw line, which is usually a good indicator if someone will become a good shooter. If you told me he would eventually become a multi time all star, average 27/7/3 on good defense and be a FMVP I would obviously not believe you.</p>

He mostly looked slow because of how big he was and the baggy ass jersey/shorts combo, but his two point field goal percentage was 57% in college. He was one of the best slashers in the NCAA.

<blockquote>
<p>Sports involving bouncing and jumping activities with a high intensity of stretch-shortening cycles (SSCs) [e.g. soccer and football] require a muscle-tendon unit that is compliant enough to store and release the high amount of elastic energy that benefits performance in such sports. If the participants of these sports have an insufficient compliant muscle-tendon unit, the demands in energy absorption and release may rapidly exceed the capacity of the muscle-tendon unit. This may lead to an increased risk for injury of this structure. Consequently, the rationale for injury prevention in these sports is to increase the compliance of the muscle-tendon unit. Recent studies have shown that stretching programmes can significantly influence the viscosity of the tendon and make it significantly more compliant, and when a sport demands SSCs of high intensity, stretching may be important for injury prevention. This conjecture is in agreement with the available scientific clinical evidence from these types of sports activities.</p>

<p>Sure Wemby has all of the make up of a guy you’d think could <em>maybe</em> often be injured, but so could any one else, really.</p>

<p>I can’t think of a situation where actually moving a guy down a draft board because you think they might maybe be injury prone with no real proof outside of “he looks like it” is a good idea</p>

      <label for="lrhna9p" class="commentText"><p>Jaylen Brown and I think people forget how his career started. Him being picked at 3rd was heavily scrutinized and he was basically just a raw athlete at the time. He was literally booed on draft night.</p>

<p>After his first 2 regular seasons I just didn’t think he was going to improve much. He was a mediocre shooter who couldn’t create, dribble, but had some defensive intangibles. He honestly looked like the classic bust archetype.</p>

<p>But that 2018 ecf playoff was a crazy showcase of what he could really be. No one talks about it but those team injuries were a blessing in disguise for his career. And besides Giannis ive never seen a player improve a different part of his game every year into his late 20s. It took him 4-5 years to even become an all star.</p>

      <label for="lrhv4be" class="commentText"><p>Was it really tho? He proceeded to play even less minutes the following season and started less than half the games after that playoff run.</p>

<p>And it’s not like they immediately went to him and Tatum as the 1-2 the season after that….they brought in Kemba as Tatums partner. This is what I mean as people forgetting how his first couple years actually went.</p>

      <label for="lrhqtu6" class="commentText"><p>As a Celtics fan I strongly agree on the 2018 playoffs point. If it wasn’t for that I honestly do think they would have given him much leeway moving forward. I also think people tend to forget he was really good in those playoff especially compared to his regular season production. It’s kinda just remembered as this Tatum carry job nowadays.</p>

Didn’t get an extension with the lakers and got back to back “prove it” contracts with the pelicans and the Knicks. Now, he’s made 2 all nba teams, and 3 all star teams. With 43.3 career win shares, and a BPM of 0.9, not only has he shed the bust label, he has vastly exceeded the “expected” value of a 7th pick.</p>

      <label for="lrhtjew" class="commentText"><p>I knew Drummond irl and he’s kind of a bum personality wise imo lol. But he made a decent career even if it’s mostly relying on his crazy build. He is/was an athletic 280 lb big man, he could’ve been a superstar in today’s small ball league if he worked on his touch, his rim protecting, and developed some kind of post game but oh well, the dude still did way better than I ever imagined.</p>

      <label for="lrhzxzu" class="commentText"><p>I’ve watched a couple games live with Drummond, and the thing that always stands out is how no one can move this man. Everyone will be busting their butts off trying to box him out and he’s just a rock. Another thing that stands out is how soft he is. He won’t throw his weight around as if he’s scared of hurting everyone. And when he does fight back it’s always in such a whiny way like he’s had enough and he’s saying “dude, that’s totally not cool, we’re just trying to have fun.”</p>

<p>If this guy had a Draymond mean streak he’d be dominating the paint.</p>

He was just really tall, and that made a huge difference in South Dakota. Then he went to Florida and shit started happening. Guess he grew into that frame. Cool to watch his climb to NBA greatness.</p>

      <label for="lrj1fz6" class="commentText"><p>Full circle for me with Malik Monk. I was really high on Monk coming out of Kentucky with Fox and was convinced the Kings should’ve grabbed him in the draft to pair with Fox. When he went to the Hornets and struggled to even get playing time, he started looking like a bust and I kinda just admitted to myself that I was wrong about him. Years later, Monk turns it around and somehow finds his way to the Kings where he’s killing it with his old mate Fox. I’m glad Monk proved me wrong in the long run.</p>

      <label for="lriniuq" class="commentText"><p>Kyle Kuzma.</p>

<p>Most Utah fans were confused when he declared early for the NBA and were even more confused when he was a first round pick.</p>

<p>We knew he was a good player but most of his success while he was at Utah was with Delon Wright and Jakob Poeltl. He didn’t really show anything in college to make you think he’d be more than an end of bench NBA.</p>

<p>Really surprised he has become a solid starter.</p>

<p>altho he&rsquo;s kinda on the trajectory now with always being hurt. but before he came into the league, i thought he would bust if all he could do was dunks.</p>

<p>i thought, no way can he impose his will on grown men. he can only do that in college because majority of players there are boys and not NBA-caliber players.</p>

<p>i thought NBA players would be able to stop him.</p>

      <label for="lriqkb9" class="commentText"><p>Dwight Howard, another high schooler who seemed to have a ton of athleticism but didn&rsquo;t seem to have a skill set aligned with 2004 basketball, concerned me greatly. I had feared he was still too short for a center but not offensively skilled enough for a four. He was only a few years after Kwame Brown was already being called a bust, which didn&rsquo;t help.</p>

<p>I didn’t watch a lot of college basketball, but Blake Griffin was similar in that I wasn’t really sure what one or two things he did exceptionally well. He could be a “jack of all trades, master of none,” which would make him OK but nothing special.</p>

<p>Thought he’d be the typical really tall player who’s hyped up but just doesn’t deliver and eventually goes to G-League or Europe than disappears. Also thought he’d be too skinny to be actually NBA ready.</p>

<p>Honestly he was just so overhyped I didn’t think he’d match up to that much hype. But he’s actually doing really good and is a beast rn</p>

<p>There was plenty of talk about him being a perpetually injured chucker before he started actually winning and staying healthy. I mean, before Kerr they had Curry running post ups, who wouldn&rsquo;t doubt that?</p>

While he was good I kept thinking that he isn’t strong enough to last in the Big 12. He was a legit 6”9-6”10 maybe 185 soak and wet (pause). I didn’t think he would have enough to get his shot off. Let’s just say the rest was history after his first few games at Texas.</p>

      <label for="lrhv1s6" class="commentText"><p>This post is making me reflect that I actually have a really good eye, I couldn’t come up with one player I thought would be a bust but didn’t.</p>

<p>I don’t say this to brag, it’s just interesting to me that I have a long list of players I thought would (or could) be stars but literally no one I thought would be a bust but proved me wrong.</p>

<p>Some notable eye test results from me (typically after a full rookie season, not at fear time):</p>

<ul>
<li>I thought Giannis would be a monster very early</li>
<li>Ben Simmons never passed the eye test for me</li>
<li>I thought Derrick Rose’s peak game would not last long (the way he moved in the lane and open floor made me think he would get injured)</li>
<li>Jokic’s first few appearances on highlight reels for passes woke me up to him going to be a great (I used to watch the nba.com top 10 every day)</li>
<li>I thought OG Anunoby could be the ultimate &ldquo;glue guy&rdquo; or &ldquo;secret sauce&rdquo; on a very successful team (this one is promising but still not totally proven)</li>
<li>I thought AD would win a ‘ship one day (clown him for injuries sure, but the guy is a competitor)</li>
<li>I joked to a buddy in 2015 that Lowry/Kawhi, a decent two way Centre and passable roster depth could get us a Championship if everything went just right</li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing super surprising on this list I guess, I’ll have to think more. But I’ve learned to trust my eye test</p>

<p>That being said, the vast majority of guys I either accurately call as &ldquo;rotation guys&rdquo; or as guys with potential (whether they get there or not - hard not to see professional athletes who show flashes of great play as having &ldquo;we’ll see&rdquo; potential).</p>
