      <label for="lrhofio" class="commentText"><p>This is going to make a lot of people clown on me and maybe deservedly so.</p>

<p>But despite the fact that I probably spend more time following the draft and the draft process than anything else with basketball&hellip; I was super not sold on Anthony Edwards</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t think he was going to be a bust in the traditional sense&hellip;. But I definitely didn&rsquo;t think he was going to be a star either. He was pretty underwhelming at Georgia, I watched all of his games and I just really wasn&rsquo;t sold on his basketball IQ, he was extremely inefficient, and really didn&rsquo;t give two flying f&rsquo;s on defense. Then you factor in some of his comments leading up to the draft and the draft process, kind of making it seem like he was a less than serious person when it came to the game, and I really expected him to top out as a good starter, but someone who definitely shouldn&rsquo;t have gone number one in the draft.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still early in his career but I think it&rsquo;s quite clear I was very much underestimating how terrible his college situation was (He was on a terrible team that clearly brought out some of his less desirable traits as a prospect)  And also underestimating the fact that he wasn&rsquo;t simply a great athlete, he&rsquo;s a borderline outlier athlete.</p>

<p>The kids clearly a star and all the tape and film in the world didn&rsquo;t convince me that that was a likely possibility on draft night.</p>

<p>I never claimed he was going to be a &ldquo;bust&rdquo; in the Anthony Bennett fashion but never imagined he would get as far as he got, for example securing a spot in a heavily talented US Olympic team and being important in some minutes of the tournament, that is above my early expectations.</p>

He&rsquo;s made some really ignorant comments about the referees at some of his games, and I still don&rsquo;t think he is as efficient as he needs to be to eventually be considered for an MVP award. I think this upcoming season is a really big opportunity for him to bust out even more than he already has.</p>

<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t think he was going to be one of the most athletic guards in modern NBA history. And no, that wasn&rsquo;t a general consensus at the time and if you think it was, you&rsquo;re tripping.</p>

      <label for="lri43y3" class="commentText"><p>I get you. People forget that outliers are supposed to be statistically negligible. There are NBA players lining the benches of the league - Javonte Green, Derrick Jones Jr. - who can slam their head into the rim from the free throw line. There is ridiculous quickness from every guard below 6&rsquo;2&rdquo;, hand-eye coordination of guys like Derrick White and Mikal Bridges. They&rsquo;re all outliers in the general population but not within the 500 player set of the NBA.</p>

<p>He doesn’t pass my eye test for some reason. Hot take with no rationale.</p>

<p>I think he’s a great player and peak athlete. But I don’t think he’s &ldquo;the guy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another hot take, but to me Ant is more Paul George than Jimmy Butler. More Melo than Jordan. More Cousins than AD. More Derrick Rose than Allen Iverson.</p>

<p>We’ll see. These are some ridiculous comparisons, granted.</p>

<p>But I guess what I’m trying to say is I’m not sold that his talent and individual achievements will translate to being a superstar leading a contender or a champion.</p>

<p>And yes I agree when you’re rebuilding you should draft talent over anything else, unless you have a solid projected superstar or core.</p>

<p>Ant is a great player, I just don’t think he’s a #1 that will get them to the finals even</p>

      <label for="lrhyde9" class="commentText"><p>I guess my question to you is when you&rsquo;re saying you&rsquo;re not sold on him, are you talking about in regards to the idea of him being the best player in the league one day? Because that I can get behind. I could definitely see a scenario where he doesn&rsquo;t develop to the point where he&rsquo;s the leagues preeminent Superstar. But if you&rsquo;re not sold on him, in the sense of him being a top 15/top 10 player that I think is kind of hard to justify. This comes from someone who personally is not a fan of the Timberwolves But I think Edwards is quite clearly a genuine star</p>

<p>It remains to be seen if he can become a true top five player or not But based on his age he definitely has a good chance</p>

<p>Its something about my eye test man, I can’t explain it. Everything on paper adds up but I don’t see him winning a ship as a #1.</p>

<p>No idea if that makes sense but thanks for entertaining what I’m trying to say</p>

      <label for="lrhyx35" class="commentText"><p>Think it was ESPN that had him number 7 on their best players in the league list. There are definitely a lot of people, both fans and analysts that think he&rsquo;s going to be a top three or so player in the league in his prime, and a group of vocal people who believe he&rsquo;s going to be the next face of the league</p>

<p>Definitely a thing. I think he&rsquo;s about to enjoy a decade of being a top 10 player in the league. The kids a stud. I do think there&rsquo;s a genuine chance he never breaks into that top three or so true transcendent star level but hey age is on his side so he definitely has a chance</p>

But put the actual reality and history of it is if you&rsquo;re not drafting in the top five, if you end up with a solid starter or a high-end role player in the mid to late lottery, you&rsquo;re doing solid. And I do think saying good sixth man is maybe discrediting him a little bit. He&rsquo;s arguably the best sixth man in the league or at the very least on a very short list of them</p>

      <label for="lriaen2" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I thought they were both going to be good players, but I didn&rsquo;t see them getting to the level they&rsquo;re at now, especially Jaylen. I&rsquo;d kind of thought he hit his ceiling in 2020— 20 PPG with good on-ball defense, a very good 3rd option but not quite a star— but then literally the next year he developed a midrange game and became an All-Star, then just kept getting better from there. We knew he had a great work ethic, but that level of skill development is <em>really</em> rare for guys with his draft profile.</p>

<p>With Tatum, I knew he had star potential, but I kind of thought he&rsquo;d top out at like borderline All-NBA— I just thought his rim finishing would never be good enough, because of his smallish hands and lack of vertical explosiveness (issues that still come up occasionally tbh). It turned out he just needed to bulk up so he could out-muscle wings to the rim.</p>

<p>Boy was I glad to be wrong though lol</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s hard to measure when you&rsquo;re drafting someone. If they&rsquo;re actually gonna work as hard as necessary to fulfill what their natural talent dictates</p>

      <label for="lricubo" class="commentText"><p>one thing I am 100% confident in is that Tatum and Brown are both absolutely maxing out their potential. they have their flaws as players but I’ve never ever had to worry about if they were really doing everything possible to be the best versions of themselves</p>

<p>it’s nice to be able to say that about your team’s stars, bc there are some extremely talented players in this league who don’t seem as dedicated to the game and their bodies as much as JT and JB have shown themselves to be</p>

<p>Even in high school… he was like 14 on the varsity team pulling up from half court and was a Instagram star and I thought he wouldn’t even make the league…</p>

<p>That Chino Hills team was SOOOOO fucking good. They had the three ball brothers, Okeke and then a couple other players who played D1 and professionally overseas</p>

<p>It was barely basketball tho… they basically were so good they would always have one person cherry picking and just chuck shots and dunk it. One of the best high school teams ever</p>

<p>I thought the little brother was just a gimmick and had no chance at the league. I thought Lonzo would be the best and then LiAngelo and then LaMelo. Obviously injuries fucked up lonzos career but Melo will be the best</p>

      <label for="lrhna9p" class="commentText"><p>Jaylen Brown and I think people forget how his career started. Him being picked at 3rd was heavily scrutinized and he was basically just a raw athlete at the time. He was literally booed on draft night.</p>

<p>After his first 2 regular seasons I just didn’t think he was going to improve much. He was a mediocre shooter who couldn’t create, dribble, but had some defensive intangibles. He honestly looked like the classic bust archetype.</p>

<p>But that 2018 ecf playoff was a crazy showcase of what he could really be. No one talks about it but those team injuries were a blessing in disguise for his career. And besides Giannis ive never seen a player improve a different part of his game every year into his late 20s. It took him 4-5 years to even become an all star.</p>

He averaged 6 points a game and shot 68% from the free throw line, which is usually a good indicator if someone will become a good shooter. If you told me he would eventually become a multi time all star, average 27/7/3 on good defense and be a FMVP I would obviously not believe you.</p>

      <label for="lrhvdwe" class="commentText"><p>One that I’m surprised people aren’t mentioning is Julius Randle. Didn’t get an extension with the lakers and got back to back “prove it” contracts with the pelicans and the Knicks. Now, he’s made 2 all nba teams, and 3 all star teams. With 43.3 career win shares, and a BPM of 0.9, not only has he shed the bust label, he has vastly exceeded the “expected” value of a 7th pick.</p>

That volume is enough to where I don&rsquo;t <em>think</em> it&rsquo;s a fluke, but there were definitely moments last year when teams were asking &ldquo;is Suggs <em>really</em> gonna beat us from three?&rdquo; A multi-year sample size of near-40% shooting on this volume ought to put the nail in that coffin, which would be huge for Orlando&rsquo;s spacing</p>

So many turnovers.  He kept at it and you can see the game slow down for him on offense.  And he still brings that erratic game on defense which is awesome.</p>

Wasn&rsquo;t like a superstar or anything, but he was solid, and was the best player on a 57-win team a few years later.  (Whereas Joe Alexander, picked 2 spots after, was a total bust.)</p>

      <label for="lrhz131" class="commentText"><p>Mike Miller. We are from the same state. His brother was supposed to be the breakout athlete, because Mike was simply too gangly and uncoordinated. He was just really tall, and that made a huge difference in South Dakota. Then he went to Florida and shit started happening. Guess he grew into that frame. Cool to watch his climb to NBA greatness.</p>

He is/was an athletic 280 lb big man, he could’ve been a superstar in today’s small ball league if he worked on his touch, his rim protecting, and developed some kind of post game but oh well, the dude still did way better than I ever imagined.</p>

      <label for="lrhzxzu" class="commentText"><p>I’ve watched a couple games live with Drummond, and the thing that always stands out is how no one can move this man. Everyone will be busting their butts off trying to box him out and he’s just a rock. Another thing that stands out is how soft he is. He won’t throw his weight around as if he’s scared of hurting everyone. And when he does fight back it’s always in such a whiny way like he’s had enough and he’s saying “dude, that’s totally not cool, we’re just trying to have fun.”</p>

<p>If this guy had a Draymond mean streak he’d be dominating the paint.</p>

While he was good I kept thinking that he isn’t strong enough to last in the Big 12. He was a legit 6”9-6”10 maybe 185 soak and wet (pause). I didn’t think he would have enough to get his shot off. Let’s just say the rest was history after his first few games at Texas.</p>

      <label for="lrhv1s6" class="commentText"><p>This post is making me reflect that I actually have a really good eye, I couldn’t come up with one player I thought would be a bust but didn’t.</p>

<p>I don’t say this to brag, it’s just interesting to me that I have a long list of players I thought would (or could) be stars but literally no one I thought would be a bust but proved me wrong.</p>

<p>Some notable eye test results from me (typically after a full rookie season, not at fear time):</p>

<ul>
<li>I thought Giannis would be a monster very early</li>
<li>Ben Simmons never passed the eye test for me</li>
<li>I thought Derrick Rose’s peak game would not last long (the way he moved in the lane and open floor made me think he would get injured)</li>
<li>Jokic’s first few appearances on highlight reels for passes woke me up to him going to be a great (I used to watch the nba.com top 10 every day)</li>
<li>I thought OG Anunoby could be the ultimate &ldquo;glue guy&rdquo; or &ldquo;secret sauce&rdquo; on a very successful team (this one is promising but still not totally proven)</li>
<li>I thought AD would win a ‘ship one day (clown him for injuries sure, but the guy is a competitor)</li>
<li>I joked to a buddy in 2015 that Lowry/Kawhi, a decent two way Centre and passable roster depth could get us a Championship if everything went just right</li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing super surprising on this list I guess, I’ll have to think more. But I’ve learned to trust my eye test</p>

<p>That being said, the vast majority of guys I either accurately call as &ldquo;rotation guys&rdquo; or as guys with potential (whether they get there or not - hard not to see professional athletes who show flashes of great play as having &ldquo;we’ll see&rdquo; potential).</p>
