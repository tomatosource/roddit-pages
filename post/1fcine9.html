      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fcine9/why_dont_bad_teams_hire_euro_coaches/"><p>Why don’t bad teams hire Euro coaches?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I’ve always wondered why bad teams don’t try to play differently from good teams. Like watching the pistons or the wizards play heavy iso ball with Cade and Poole respectively, surely they don’t think they are gonna win right?</p>

<p>Similarly with all the memes about like FIBA patty Mills for Australia, or other low end nba players tearing it up in FIBA basketball. Surely it is a little obvious that there’s some really good offensive minds out there that can turn average NBA guys into really good FIBA players.</p>

<p>My theory is if we completely suck, why not hire Zeljko Obradovic, Georgios Bartzokas or Sarunas Jasikevicius and run a slower pace but a more well drilled offence to get your crappier players better looks. Also if you wanna watch their offences on YouTube they are like incredible. Dan Hurley would also be good for this, his offences are pretty intricate.</p>

<p>The obvious counter I see is these coaches are far more harsh and demanding than the regular NBA coaches, and players and agents won’t wanna play for them. But like surely popovic was similar back in the day? Hard to play for but you get the hang of it and then have success and the players are more forgiving.</p>

<p>Now with that being said I don’t think these coaches would win the title with the pistons or wizards, but surely they’d get more wins, teach younger players how to work like a professional and make more difficult reads while also making their job easier with constant movement.</p>

<p>My other idea, similar to Manchester City owning teams in other leagues to send their players on loan, could the lakers buy Virtus Bologna for example and send their kids on loan to play in Europe to learn this sorta stuff? Would be sick for their draft picks to play against Partizan for example and experience that pressure.</p>

<p>Lemme know what you think orrrr if you want some euro league to watch, happy to send recommendations!</p>

<p>Edit: I’m very surprised to see so many nba fans so vehemently against this idea. It seems like most people either prefer the approach of just continuing to lose and hope you get good draft picks, or that American players can’t handle hard coaching?</p>

<p>2-In Euro, the coaches are the generals and the players are his soldiers. Even he was to bench and curse the players, even the star ones. They have to shut up and take it. In the NBA, the players are the ones with power, if Star players want the coaches gone, they are gone.</p>

<p>3-Many winning coaches in Euro have said before that they don&rsquo;t wanna leave their Euro homeland becuz that is where they are winning and they don&rsquo;t wanna compromise their authority and adapt to NBA culture</p>

      <label for="lm91hlo" class="commentText"><p>Euro basketball is also very different to the NBA which I think is one of the biggest things. The NBA court is longer, wider, the 3 point line is further out, and there is a defensive 3 second rule. This was all designed to make the NBA higher scoring and more exciting. This makes the way European teams play not ideal in the NBA.</p>

<p>The NBA favors the athletic players who can cover the extra space on defense and exploit it on offense. It&rsquo;s part of why some guys in the NBA struggle a lot in FIBA because of how different the game is. I think people have tried bringing over the European style to the NBA, but it&rsquo;s not as effective as the more normal NBA style of play.</p>

<p>Worked for Spo, with the Miami Heat closely resembling the style of play he established as a youth coach for TuS Herten.</p>

<p>(/s, because I have no idea how his Herten sides played, but also not a full /s, because what he does in Miami is closer to Euro style basketball coaching than at pretty much all other teams in the NBA).</p>

<p>An underrated what-if in NBA history is Bron failing to get Spo fired. Perfect storm for Spo because of Pat Riley being the way he is as an admin/person lol.</p>

<p>I think his story is too unique to use as a reference point and, like you said, it&rsquo;s distinct outside of coach Pop&rsquo;s dynasty built on playing at the highest level the right way. That style of ball would take A LOT of teams in the league a lot further, but I don&rsquo;t think the average player would commit to the culture.</p>

      <label for="lma9kze" class="commentText"><p>Coaching that way in the NBA requires walking a very fine line that not a lot of people have the temperament or the personality for. Its just a lot more difficult when even bench guys are getting $10M/year contracts and how much (more) they get paid depends a lot on their stats. If you&rsquo;re not winning then a lot of guys just aren&rsquo;t interested in sacrificing for the sake of the team.  In the NBA you end up with a locker room hierarchy that is driven far more by the players themselves rather than any coach.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with that take. Terrible American players do very well in Europe. Look at the all-Euroleague teams. Mike James, Shane Larkin, Facundo Campazzo, Kendrick Nunn, Edy Tavares. These are guys who could barely crack an NBA rotation today and they&rsquo;re the literal best of the best of the best in Europe.</p>

<p>SOME of them do very well. A lot of them don&rsquo;t. For every Mike James there is Emmanuel Mudiay, Kenneth Faried, Wesley Johnson etc. There are many borderline NBA guys who come to Euroleague and do nothing.</p>

<p>These clowns hype up their crowds and pretend like an NBA player wouldn&rsquo;t be able to perform when American nobodies like Kyle Hines are GOAT-tier players in Europe. Elite American athletes have been playing in front of massive crowds since they were preteens, the idea that European crowds are a big deal to them because they light some fucking flares is laughable.</p>

<p>1-Even if the coaches are proven winners, it&rsquo;s not guaranteed that their skillsets and coaching experience could translate into NBA setting .</p>

<p>JJ Reddick has no skillsets, wins, or experience.  Teams want someone who impresses FO, ownership, and the players.  If those EU coaches can schmooze a room like Doc Rivers they can headcoach in the NBA.  Their main problem is they are not in the US and not working in the NBA.</p>

<p>If those guys were impressing NBA players and GM’s as assistants they would have way more interest.</p>

<p>Jerry might be the best owner in sports history. Back when Max was on ESPN he made the distinction between Steinbrenner&rsquo;s longevity with the Yankees and Buss&rsquo;s peak w the Lakers - it&rsquo;s like Bron putting up 27 a game for 20 years vs Jordan averaging 30+ in the playoffs for 6 undefeated chips in ~12 years. Jerry Jones, Robert Kraft, Ted Turner, etc were all chasing what Buss did, and nobody came close.</p>

<p>You guys had an owner so good that the leftovers of what he built still got you more superstars and another chip practically a decade after he died. I wouldn&rsquo;t be so hard on your ownership for not completely fumbling the bag.</p>

<p>&hellip;all that said, I&rsquo;m a 30-year Duke fan and a fan of JJ&rsquo;s game + analysis, and there&rsquo;s no way IN HELL he should&rsquo;ve gotten the post 🤣</p>

<p>in Euro, the coaches are the generals and the players are his soldiers. Even he was to bench and curse the players, even the star ones. They have to shut up and take it. In the NBA, the players are the ones with power, if Star players want the coaches gone, they are gone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I played at a fairly high level in Europe and this is spot on. Your coach is your boss, general and often also mentor. What he says goes and he won&rsquo;t hold back if you fucked up. This attitude has its boons. It can help with team cohesion and a feeling of being in the trenches together with clear leadership and hierarchy. The downside is that some coaches get away with a lot of unwarranted abuse and can be quite toxic.</p>

      <label for="lm9wlay" class="commentText"><p>lol they have the same mentality as American college coaches, and its why they&rsquo;d fail in the NBA as well with that mentality. Barking at a man with hundreds of millions in the bank and maybe even a wife, kid, etc like he&rsquo;s some fucking child isn&rsquo;t going to get you anywhere in America unless you&rsquo;ve already proven yourself as a GOAT-tier coach. And even then those coaches still have issues with some players.</p>

<p>Same thing happens all the time in the NFL when some hard-nosed college coach tries to make the switch to the pros. You can&rsquo;t talk to a grown man with a wife and kid like he&rsquo;s some 18 year old true freshman looking to make a name for himself and expect to last very long.</p>

<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know about exciting per se, but the Pistons for sure were &ldquo;weird&rdquo; by the NBA standards of their time, both in 89-90 and also in 04.</p>

<p>They might actually be one of the best theoretical candidates for OPs idea.</p>

Set a negative precedent for other European coaches that if you move your whole life to the other side of the world and have better results than many would expect you can still be fired if your primary player doesn’t like your personality.</p>

      <label for="lmaupqe" class="commentText"><p>lol that’s not even what happened, if anything, Blatt never criticized LeBron and Kyrie.</p>

<p>He was fired because the players didn’t respect him and Kyrie was a big one at that. Players were always going to Lue for help and questions. Players often criticized the offensive scheme with Blatt.</p>

<p>Raja Bell also worked for the Cavs front office and has said that the FO knew the players wouldn’t play hard for Blatt but the FO didn’t want to give up on him. FO went to LeBron and asked him to help get the team to play hard and LeBron said he would and the Cavs went on a run after that. This is all Raja’s words. Ultimately it still didn’t work and they fired him because dude the players wanted Lue.</p>

<p>Dan Gilbert has even said he would have never hired Blatt if he knew for sure that LeBron was coming back.</p>

Neither college coaches nor European coaches tend to do well or even get a chance because players don&rsquo;t respect them.</p>

<p>The worst thing you could do on top of being a bad team would be to also be a circus with locker room controversies. The Wizards, Pistons, etc. seem to be at least <em>trying</em> to find their coach of the future and instilling some decent culture rather than opening the door to becoming a complete laughingstock</p>

<p>Plus, logistically, head offices aren&rsquo;t going to be involved in the same coaching circles as the ones in Europe. Nor are current NBA coaches, who give euro coaches their first jobs.</p>

<p>Picking the players with the highest overalls, regardless of how they play and then picking the only coaches they recognise from a list of potential hires.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I love about the Thunder, Thunder hired new blood and he&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>

<p>I think for why a team wouldn&rsquo;t hire a euro coach, over a guy who&rsquo;s been in the NBA for a long time is the same. Except instead of the needing the player&rsquo;s respect, they need the front offices. They need to trust their hire to be able to understand the dynamics of the NBA.</p>

<p>The existence of David Blatt, makes a lot of front offices weary too. I feel like all euro coach hire talk has died since that all went down.</p>

<p>But my whole point is, if you’re Detroit, you’ll never be as rich or desired as the lakers or golden state or whoever, so why do you need to conform to “the dynamics of the nba”? Be weird and try new stuff, like the bad boys did! I just think if you had a completely European offence you would be different and give yourself a better chance than trying to just be poor man’s lakers or whatever?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Because they are an NBA team. The dynamics I&rsquo;m talking about are things like 82 game schedule, wealthy players, black American culture, 7 game playoff series, hyper athleticism etc etc. You can&rsquo;t ignore reality.</p>

<p>There’s really no correlation between NBA experience and coaching results.  Most fan bases lampoon their teams if they bring back a multi-team retread coach to have their team live the same path of failure.</p>

<p>It seems like the NBA especially should be taking way more chances on new coaches than they are.  Maybe that comes down to NBA player biases I’m not sure.  But most of the young dynamic teams in all of sports are coached by young dynamic first time head coaches.</p>

<p>If you think about it, the NBA seems to be in a pre-Moneyball situation.</p>

<p>The NBA has tracking cameras and the algorithms to figure out how much you should be a playing off your man and that was over a decade ago.</p>

<p>Getting players buying into a specific person to lead them is much more on the &ldquo;human&rdquo; side than the &ldquo;math&rdquo; side of the game.</p>

<p>How would that even work? You have to max someone. Or we just not maxing anyone? No max contracts, no stars.</p>

<p>What even is an &ldquo;unknown player&rdquo;?</p>

<p>Which team do you think, in the current league, has the most &ldquo;unknown players&rdquo;?</p>

      <label for="lma89ku" class="commentText"><p>Moneyball is still the most misunderstood sports movie in reddit, and the movie leaves out many key details about the 2002 A&rsquo;s. </p>

<p>The movie is not about how &ldquo;new is better than traditional&rdquo; or &ldquo;stats and analystics are better than inutition&rdquo;. The movie is about understanding the situation you&rsquo;re in, taking risks that you believe in, and trusting in your beliefs even when outside forces dont believe in it. That is the actual message of the film and that is something more GMs and coaches need to learn IMO.</p>

<p>The 2002 As had 3 phenomenal starting pitchers and a superstar emerge named Miguel Tejada that conveniently was not mentioned in the movie. They also were not the first team to use advanced stats and analytics to build teams. That has been going on since the 70s(obviously not as much as today and there arent nearly as many silly baseball stats back then as now, but the concept was there). In reality, the A&rsquo;s realized that the 29 other teams were undervaluing certain elements of the game, like walks, and they took full advantage of that.</p>

<p>To bring this back to the NBA, what you&rsquo;re saying was tried with the 2004 Pistons, and they immediately won a championship once Larry Brown came in. Those players were known i guess, but they were selfless and a team rather than a bunch of individuals.</p>

      <label for="lm8p15p" class="commentText"><p>The issue isn&rsquo;t that coaches can&rsquo;t find more clever ways to play. If it was as simple as that, you could hire any one of hundreds of college coaches or Euro or even South American coaches.</p>

<p>The issue is that NBA players, especially young ones, are unbelievably difficult to motivate and control. They make too much money, they&rsquo;re too empowered, and they&rsquo;re often deeply suspicious of authority and leadership. Almost everyone they talk to has a hidden motive and wants to enrich themselves in some way through them.</p>

<p>For these reasons among others, the only kind of coaches most NBA players are willing to accept the authority of, are ex NBA players. Or, failing that, at least coaches who come with a proven track record of success, including multiple deep playoff runs or championships.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why players will listen to a Tyron Lue or a Poppovic much more so than they&rsquo;ll listen to some college coach who has never played in the pros, or some random guy from Spain who is used to coaching guys who could never cut it in the NBA. They won&rsquo;t listen to those guys, they won&rsquo;t respect them.</p>

<p>Surely it is a little obvious that there’s some really good offensive minds out there that can turn average NBA guys into really good FIBA players.</p>

<p>Absolutely. Which is not what an NBA team wants. You want good NBA players, not good FIBA players.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s much easier for a player to adjust to a new system because they have a coach guiding them. A coach adjusting to a new system is very difficult because they can&rsquo;t exactly ask the players to teach them. Especially on an already poor team.</p>

Spanish pick and rolls, zoom action, there’s a whole video out there about how basically every action you see now Zeljko did 20 years ago in Europe. So I don’t think that works.</p>

<p>I’m not sure I get what you mean by a coach adjusting to a new system? They are playing the same sport, just a different style. Think Mike D’Antoni (who started in Europe) with phoenix.</p>

      <label for="lm8stg0" class="commentText"><p>Players are more important than systems. Phil Jackson is an all time great coach/mind because he was able to get Jordan/Pippen and Kobe/Shaq, the triangle is irrelevant, he was shit with this same system in New York. The Beautiful game spurs are no longer viable because there is no Tim, Manu, TP (Kawhi later on). Coach pop is still going in SA but hasn’t been relevant since Kawhi Left.</p>

<p>The best system is having an all time great player making as many decisions as possible. Example nuggets, If you’re spreading the ball around you risk having Christian Braun/Aaron Gordon/MPJ making decisions rather than Jokic or Murray, that’s not desirable. Finding 1 or 2 great decision makers (Nuggets) is a lot easier than finding 5 (such as Boston).</p>

<p>We’ve seen young and bad players try to integrate into intricate, motions offenses with Golden State and it did not work. Adding more passes and complicating an offense for young or bad players ain’t it, they’re easily confused and prone to losing confidence.
We’ve also seen how that great system flop without the stars, Look at the years with and without Curry or Klay, it’s gross. Stars &amp;gt; System</p>

<p>TLDR: NBA ball is played different than EuroLeague because the talent gap between players are wider. Kobe sentiment was right, if your superstar is giving up the ball he’s giving it to a far worse player.</p>

      <label for="lm8xbkg" class="commentText"><p>Do you seriously think none of these teams have thought about that? You think among 30 teams no one has <em>ever</em> looked into bringing in a euro coach?</p>

<p>The coaching carousel in the NBA is comically sad, for sure, but I think a lot of that comes down to the fact that no one really knows how much of a difference a coach makes to a team. There&rsquo;s no +/- for coaching, no way of measuring their impact, because 95% of what they do isn&rsquo;t in the game. When no one really knows, they just go off track record and status quo.</p>

<p>Finally, you make a huge assumption that Detroit, or any other team, prioritizes winning. But most of them don&rsquo;t. They prioritize profits. The minimum in for the maximum out. (I will say, the new front office in Detroit seem to have a new attitude towards running the team, thank God).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Just because it works one way does not mean it will work the other way.</p>

<p>European basketball players are trained to follow orders.  So if you tell them to play like an American, they will do it.  If you tell them to play like Chinese, they&rsquo;ll do it.  Anything they&rsquo;re told, they&rsquo;ll follow the coach&rsquo;s orders.</p>

<p>American basketball players are different.  They come from a culture of strong individualism.  They won&rsquo;t follow a European coach&rsquo;s orders if they don&rsquo;t &ldquo;respect&rdquo; the coach and/or they don&rsquo;t like the orders even if they&rsquo;re good ones.  Even the average American players still have the &ldquo;superstar&rdquo; mentalities and big egos.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s why Europeans can learn American style but Americans can&rsquo;t learn European style.</p>

<p>Also the reason the league is a copy-cat league. Only 2 GMs have been on the same team for longer than 8 years. 18 GMs were hired in 2020 or later.</p>

<p>It is incredibly easy to get fired, GMs would rather play it safe, play through the consensus so if they&rsquo;re wrong they can at least cover their ass a bit</p>

      <label for="lm8wa38" class="commentText"><p>If you&rsquo;re rebuilding the goal is to tank so you get a good draft prospect the next draft, not to win more games. Usually a team would go that route if they are actually trying to turn the corner, like the Cavs did when they first hired David Blatt and they had no idea Bron was coming back. By hiring Blatt they felt they had tanked long enough and had a core group so they needed a good coach to give them some structure.</p>

      <label for="lm8reb2" class="commentText"><p>I guess I don’t understand why though? Like they produce talents like doncic etc, coach up outcasts like Jabari Parker with Barcelona, make solid players out of pretty ordinary talent they have all the skills and knowledge you’d need, and have proven it far more than a lot of Americans. They are ahead of the curve on trends (small ball, shooting, offensive actions) it just seems like the most common answer I’ve received is either Lebron didn’t like David Blatt so they are all bad, or some nebulous concept of not being respected.</p>

<p>It seems like most people either prefer the approach of just continuing to lose and hope you get good draft picks, or that American players can’t handle hard coaching?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that the OP said this makes it hard to take anything they said seriously. Dude obviously knows little to nothing about basketball. The reason so many lower end NBA dudes tear it up in FIBA and Euro leagues is because they don&rsquo;t have to consistently play against NBA talent. It&rsquo;s not that the coaches are basketball wizards who have mastered the art of coaching.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t even to say that the idea isn&rsquo;t worth exploring, but grabbing some coach from overseas where the rules aren&rsquo;t even the same and thinking they&rsquo;ll automatically be a massive improvement is comical. Not to mention the assumption that a top Euro league coach would even want to relocate to the US and risk failing.</p>

<p>I got quite a few more tho, so ill pass along your thoughts if you&rsquo;re nice to me. Ok /s</p>

<p>On a more serious note, you act as if a good Euro coach would dramatically change the Pistons lol. You keep saying they got no star, they suck, blah blah blah. Coo.</p>

<p>So how many Wins do u think a good Euro coach will add to Detroit after 1 year? Oh but it takes time? So you want the Euro coach to get a long leash (in terms of years) in your hypothetical situation? Ok. After 5 years? Too lazy to look up lol. But Detroit&rsquo;s record last season, then 5 years from now under a Euro coach. What&rsquo;s their record? How many wins did they add?</p>

<p>Dunno my guess for exact number, but my bet is they&rsquo;re still not a playoff team. MAYBE fighting in the Play Ins.</p>

<p>But again in your hypothetical situation, you&rsquo;re probably telling me, hey! Thats a great start tho. Most would disagree, but you know what would probably happen? Those few, especially in the media, that do agree or wanna focus on the Pistons improvement (lol or w/e u call it) will to your point, sure, focus on that Euro coach.</p>

<p>Know what else theyd do? Dont act like you don&rsquo;t know how Espn works. Theyd focus, and show footage, on the part where the Euro coach is always going ballistic and cursing out his players.</p>

<p>You think a Star or heck any player with a brain will wanna go to Detroit after seeing that? Either be real with your answer or lie and continue with the hypothetical but thats as far as im going. Hmm stay on your team or 28 other teams.. or go to Detroit to play &ldquo;cool team ball while getting cursed out every 5 mins by the Euro coach&rdquo;. Tough decision.</p>

      <label for="lm8tepi" class="commentText"><p>Lol I know you’re joking re: goat mask sex ritual etc. But there’s definitely a closed circle of people who get offers in the NBA. I wouldn’t call it a conspiracy though - unless you are willing to say the same about every high level management job in America, in basically every industry.</p>

<p>An NBA coach is basically just a media personality, and player manager (closer to a high level middle manager in the corporate sense). They have assistants for actual basketball stuff.</p>

<p>In order to get a coaching gig you have to convince executives that you’re responsible with a camera in your face, and that you’re a people person (aka you won’t piss off their $60,000,000 star player investment). You do those things, and you have the resume/acumen, and you might get a job.</p>

<p>But in order to convince an owner of that, you need to be in that circle.</p>

<p>Also to OPs point, having an accent immediately puts a coach at a disadvantage when it comes to the media. Look at how much mileage the media got out of Darkos angry rant last year. Mike Brown had basically the exact same rant but nobody really memed him or laughed about it because he doesn’t have an accent. People weren’t even being rude about Darko, they agreed with him. They just inherently took it less seriously because he talks with an accent.</p>

      <label for="lmaw934" class="commentText"><p>memes aside, I think that this is legitimately part of the reason as well. Coaching is a fraternity. The social element is huge.</p>

<p>If people in a front office hire someone who is friends with the fraternity, then they get the social connection. Those social connections translate into more access to information and more business opportunities. Eventually if you play that game well enough, you get invited to the goat mask parties.</p>

      <label for="lm8t6ki" class="commentText"><p>It is because historically US sports evolves from within and looks down on foreign talent. You see it in every sport, it takes a very long time for the league to accept that there may be another way of doing things. This is not limited to US either. The English Premier League for decades looked down on Europeans. Now, you are hard pressed to find more than 4 English managers of Premier League teams.</p>

<p>The difference here is US sports have so little contact with outside influences that the change is going to take even longer. It&rsquo;ll come eventually. Just look at how baseball is shifting.</p>

      <label for="lm915s3" class="commentText"><p>Because one of, if not the biggest skill an NBA coach needs is the ability to manage personalities.  The NBA is all about star power.  Teams are built around stars.  So if there’s a clash between a rising star and a new coach, the coach is gone <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> times.  </p>

<p>Euro teams are known for working the exact opposite way.  The coach is king and everyone on the team bows to what they say.  </p>

<p>So why would a team hire a coach who is going to demand unwavering authority when the team has no intention of giving it to them.  And why would a euro coach take that offer?</p>

<p>If anything, it’d make more sense to hire an American coach who manages egos well and have them study the coaching systems of more successful Xs-and-Os coaches both local and abroad.  </p>

      <label for="lmamfpq" class="commentText"><p>No, not necessarily, but if you’re a GM and you’re going to be under a microscope, it’s going to be a lot more defendable to hire someone who you know isn’t going to have a massive culture clash.  Hiring a coach from abroad, especially one with no NBA experience, is a big swing and can blow up in your face, and it can quickly put a GM in the hot seat.  Hiring a known quantity like JB is safe, and it gives you time to search for a diamond in the rough while he holds the locker room together. </p>

<p>Think of it like a company hiring a CEO.  Lots of CEOs get passed around industries even after not making big impacts on the companies they’ve worked for in the past.  Yes there might be more upside in hiring some new guy with new ideas that worked in a different market, but it’s more defensible to the people who n make decisions to go with a safe bet. </p>

Blatt in Europe wasn’t really the average Eiro coach, he was considered a chill guy, Messina was a controller but his spell was very short.
In NBA Your role as a coach is so extremely different, the amount of games is different, job security is different, culture is different.
There is no way JJ Redick is a better tactician that Jasikevicius.
But it is highly doubtful Jasikevicius would do better at Lakers</p>

      <label for="lm9r6qm" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t watch Euroleague, but I do watch FIBA. I don&rsquo;t think it matters though, since the answer isn&rsquo;t really related to it.</p>

<p>In the NBA what you want is to be very good or very bad. Very good to contend for championship or very bad to have a chance at lottery picks. What you don&rsquo;t want is to be in the middle. Not good enough to contend, not bad enough to get lottery picks. (Exemptions are owners who only care about money)</p>

<p>With that, assuming the Euro coaches do a better job for these very bad teams, they will only be in the middle. The place you don&rsquo;t want to be in the NBA.</p>

<p>As for the Patty Mills of the FIBA world, it&rsquo;s because these players are relegated to roles in the NBA. They are limited to these roles they play. In FIBA they play a bigger role, they control the ball more, get more possessions and plays called for them.</p>

<p>As for the Euro coaches, their plays work in Euroleague. But can they make it work in superstar centric NBA? With focus on can &ldquo;they&rdquo;. Similar plays might work with other teams, but can Euro coaches make it work with the very bad teams you propose hire them? Remember, these teams are not just low in talent, they are ill fitting as well. And if they make it work, again, you don&rsquo;t actually want that to happen.</p>

<p>In the end, I do think high level American coaches can do what high level Euro coaches can do anyway.</p>

Some of the teams you mentioned were tanking and trying to bottom out, so I don&rsquo;t think they want to bring in an coach that would get them more wins in the short term. A lot of bad teams bring in coaches that are there to develop players, not win games. European coaches are capable of that two, of course, but they can also read the situation and with the lack of job security in the NBA why would they want to give up the good thing they have going on in Europe just to come over, coach a tanking team, and get replaced with a more established American coach as soon as the organization wants to start winning games.</p>

      <label for="lmaf14b" class="commentText"><p>I am very interested to see if Memphis integrates much of Tuomas Iisalo&rsquo;s offense this year. Paris was fun to watch last season, and Memphis seems to have the right personnel to run it. I guess it will just be a matter of how much control the rest of the staff gives him and how the players respond. If it&rsquo;s a success, I could see more NBA teams grabbing up and coming Euro coaches as assistants, rather than the big names.</p>

      <label for="lmao5m3" class="commentText"><p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with Euro coaches and many of them are better than some of the coaches in the NBA. However the problem with your post is you are way underestimating how much talent matters in the NBA and how different it is than FIBA basketball.</p>

<p>&ldquo;watching the pistons or the wizards play heavy iso ball with Cade and Poole respectively, surely they don’t think they are gonna win right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No, they don&rsquo;t think they are going to win, but bringing in the best offensive coaches in the world wouldn&rsquo;t change that. Their priority is on developing their talent because talent wins basketball games. And yeah it&rsquo;s not going well for them because they have a talent deficit on those teams.</p>

<p>Coaches raise ceilings, but they are not more important than the most important aspect to winning games which is overall talent level.</p>

<p>I am a high school basketball coach by the way and I can tell you that great coaching is very important but nowhere near as important as the talent level of your players. The best thing coaches can do is develop better players. Running a bajillion actions is not always the best way to do that either. That&rsquo;s a good way to win in FIBA but not a good way in the NBA unless you have the perfect personnel for it, and a bad team absolutely does not have the personnel for that.</p>

      <label for="lmatnvs" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s not a bad idea but I see some hurdles.  The best coaches in Europe might not want to leave knowing that NBA coaches have so little job security.  Unless they get a massive offer, it might not be worth the risk.  And the impression I get is that NBA front offices just don&rsquo;t have the kind of in-depth connections with the coaching scene in Europe that they do with coaching circles in the NBA.  I lot of coaching hires seem to be influenced by long established relationships, and unless NBA teams invest the time to build those relationships with coaching circles in Europe, they might never get comfortable enough with them to risk millions of dollars to hire them.</p>

      <label for="lmaytcb" class="commentText"><p>The issue is that you&rsquo;re assuming these coaches are capable of coaching at an NBA level, managing legit superstars, and that these offenses will actually work with NBA rules and NBA talent. If a team were to try this, I think they&rsquo;d be lucky to get even one of these factors correct.</p>

<p>How many times have we seen that NCAA player (in any sport) look unstoppable when playing.  They&rsquo;re doing all sorts of creative stuff that we really don&rsquo;t see at the professional level and everyone assumes they&rsquo;re about to take over.  Then, they get drafted and aren&rsquo;t able to compete with the top players in the world.  This is a lot like that.  I would totally understand a team trying this, but I think the chances of is working are a lot lower than you&rsquo;re guessing.</p>

      <label for="lmb4dhw" class="commentText"><p>I couldn&rsquo;t read all the replies but top 30-40 replies overlook the fact that Euro teams play less games and have more time to practice. Coaches are able to teach sets, plays etc and they can guide the players, change their roles. They can do this every week, before every game depending on the opponent. NBA teams/coaches don&rsquo;t have the luxury to adapt to each opponent except playoffs. They can only sharpen their own game and they are not able to make adjustments except some very minor ones, most probably line up changes.</p>

<p>(This is not my own observation, this is an observation shared by most ex-NBA players playing for Euro teams. )</p>

      <label for="lmb4nyw" class="commentText"><p>Culture. Euro coaches can be strict af, but that type of discipline is tolerated in a lot of European cultures especially in the East. The era of disciplinarian coaches in the NBA is pretty much gone and today&rsquo;s divas aren&rsquo;t really going to mesh with anyone with that style, unless they have a long track record like Thibs. There&rsquo;s also issue with potential language barriers.</p>
