      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fcine9/why_dont_bad_teams_hire_euro_coaches/"><p>Why don’t bad teams hire Euro coaches?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I’ve always wondered why bad teams don’t try to play differently from good teams. Like watching the pistons or the wizards play heavy iso ball with Cade and Poole respectively, surely they don’t think they are gonna win right?</p>

<p>Similarly with all the memes about like FIBA patty Mills for Australia, or other low end nba players tearing it up in FIBA basketball. Surely it is a little obvious that there’s some really good offensive minds out there that can turn average NBA guys into really good FIBA players.</p>

<p>My theory is if we completely suck, why not hire Zeljko Obradovic, Georgios Bartzokas or Sarunas Jasikevicius and run a slower pace but a more well drilled offence to get your crappier players better looks. Also if you wanna watch their offences on YouTube they are like incredible. Dan Hurley would also be good for this, his offences are pretty intricate.</p>

<p>The obvious counter I see is these coaches are far more harsh and demanding than the regular NBA coaches, and players and agents won’t wanna play for them. But like surely popovic was similar back in the day? Hard to play for but you get the hang of it and then have success and the players are more forgiving.</p>

<p>Now with that being said I don’t think these coaches would win the title with the pistons or wizards, but surely they’d get more wins, teach younger players how to work like a professional and make more difficult reads while also making their job easier with constant movement.</p>

<p>My other idea, similar to Manchester City owning teams in other leagues to send their players on loan, could the lakers buy Virtus Bologna for example and send their kids on loan to play in Europe to learn this sorta stuff? Would be sick for their draft picks to play against Partizan for example and experience that pressure.</p>

<p>Lemme know what you think orrrr if you want some euro league to watch, happy to send recommendations!</p>

<p>Edit: I’m very surprised to see so many nba fans so vehemently against this idea. It seems like most people either prefer the approach of just continuing to lose and hope you get good draft picks, or that American players can’t handle hard coaching?</p>

<p>3-Many winning coaches in Euro have said before that they don&rsquo;t wanna leave their Euro homeland becuz that is where they are winning and they don&rsquo;t wanna compromise their authority and adapt to NBA culture</p>

      <label for="lm91hlo" class="commentText"><p>Euro basketball is also very different to the NBA which I think is one of the biggest things. The NBA court is longer, wider, the 3 point line is further out, and there is a defensive 3 second rule. This was all designed to make the NBA higher scoring and more exciting. This makes the way European teams play not ideal in the NBA.</p>

<p>The NBA favors the athletic players who can cover the extra space on defense and exploit it on offense. It&rsquo;s part of why some guys in the NBA struggle a lot in FIBA because of how different the game is. I think people have tried bringing over the European style to the NBA, but it&rsquo;s not as effective as the more normal NBA style of play.</p>

<p>Worked for Spo, with the Miami Heat closely resembling the style of play he established as a youth coach for TuS Herten.</p>

<p>(/s, because I have no idea how his Herten sides played, but also not a full /s, because what he does in Miami is closer to Euro style basketball coaching than at pretty much all other teams in the NBA).</p>

<p>An underrated what-if in NBA history is Bron failing to get Spo fired. Perfect storm for Spo because of Pat Riley being the way he is as an admin/person lol.</p>

<p>I think his story is too unique to use as a reference point and, like you said, it&rsquo;s distinct outside of coach Pop&rsquo;s dynasty built on playing at the highest level the right way. That style of ball would take A LOT of teams in the league a lot further, but I don&rsquo;t think the average player would commit to the culture.</p>

<p>These clowns hype up their crowds and pretend like an NBA player wouldn&rsquo;t be able to perform when American nobodies like Kyle Hines are GOAT-tier players in Europe. Elite American athletes have been playing in front of massive crowds since they were preteens, the idea that European crowds are a big deal to them because they light some fucking flares is laughable.</p>

<p>JJ Reddick has no skillsets, wins, or experience.  Teams want someone who impresses FO, ownership, and the players.  If those EU coaches can schmooze a room like Doc Rivers they can headcoach in the NBA.  Their main problem is they are not in the US and not working in the NBA.</p>

<p>If those guys were impressing NBA players and GM’s as assistants they would have way more interest.</p>

<p>Jerry might be the best owner in sports history. Back when Max was on ESPN he made the distinction between Steinbrenner&rsquo;s longevity with the Yankees and Buss&rsquo;s peak w the Lakers - it&rsquo;s like Bron putting up 27 a game for 20 years vs Jordan averaging 30+ in the playoffs for 6 undefeated chips in ~12 years. Jerry Jones, Robert Kraft, Ted Turner, etc were all chasing what Buss did, and nobody came close.</p>

<p>You guys had an owner so good that the leftovers of what he built still got you more superstars and another chip practically a decade after he died. I wouldn&rsquo;t be so hard on your ownership for not completely fumbling the bag.</p>

<p>&hellip;all that said, I&rsquo;m a 30-year Duke fan and a fan of JJ&rsquo;s game + analysis, and there&rsquo;s no way IN HELL he should&rsquo;ve gotten the post 🤣</p>

<p>I played at a fairly high level in Europe and this is spot on. Your coach is your boss, general and often also mentor. What he says goes and he won&rsquo;t hold back if you fucked up. This attitude has its boons. It can help with team cohesion and a feeling of being in the trenches together with clear leadership and hierarchy. The downside is that some coaches get away with a lot of unwarranted abuse and can be quite toxic.</p>

<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know about exciting per se, but the Pistons for sure were &ldquo;weird&rdquo; by the NBA standards of their time, both in 89-90 and also in 04.</p>

<p>They might actually be one of the best theoretical candidates for OPs idea.</p>

<p>Plus, logistically, head offices aren&rsquo;t going to be involved in the same coaching circles as the ones in Europe. Nor are current NBA coaches, who give euro coaches their first jobs.</p>

<p>Picking the players with the highest overalls, regardless of how they play and then picking the only coaches they recognise from a list of potential hires.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I love about the Thunder, Thunder hired new blood and he&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>

<p>I think for why a team wouldn&rsquo;t hire a euro coach, over a guy who&rsquo;s been in the NBA for a long time is the same. Except instead of the needing the player&rsquo;s respect, they need the front offices. They need to trust their hire to be able to understand the dynamics of the NBA.</p>

<p>The existence of David Blatt, makes a lot of front offices weary too. I feel like all euro coach hire talk has died since that all went down.</p>

<p>But my whole point is, if you’re Detroit, you’ll never be as rich or desired as the lakers or golden state or whoever, so why do you need to conform to “the dynamics of the nba”? Be weird and try new stuff, like the bad boys did! I just think if you had a completely European offence you would be different and give yourself a better chance than trying to just be poor man’s lakers or whatever?</p>

<p>Because they are an NBA team. The dynamics I&rsquo;m talking about are things like 82 game schedule, wealthy players, black American culture, 7 game playoff series, hyper athleticism etc etc. You can&rsquo;t ignore reality.</p>

      <label for="lm9duwj" class="commentText"><p>A lot of the best coaches in all sports were guys who did not play at all in the top professional level.  Brad Stevens (NBA), Sean McVay (NFL), Mike Babcock (NHL) are all examples.</p>

<p>There’s really no correlation between NBA experience and coaching results.  Most fan bases lampoon their teams if they bring back a multi-team retread coach to have their team live the same path of failure.</p>

<p>It seems like the NBA especially should be taking way more chances on new coaches than they are.  Maybe that comes down to NBA player biases I’m not sure.  But most of the young dynamic teams in all of sports are coached by young dynamic first time head coaches.</p>

      <label for="lm8p15p" class="commentText"><p>The issue isn&rsquo;t that coaches can&rsquo;t find more clever ways to play. If it was as simple as that, you could hire any one of hundreds of college coaches or Euro or even South American coaches.</p>

<p>The issue is that NBA players, especially young ones, are unbelievably difficult to motivate and control. They make too much money, they&rsquo;re too empowered, and they&rsquo;re often deeply suspicious of authority and leadership. Almost everyone they talk to has a hidden motive and wants to enrich themselves in some way through them.</p>

<p>For these reasons among others, the only kind of coaches most NBA players are willing to accept the authority of, are ex NBA players. Or, failing that, at least coaches who come with a proven track record of success, including multiple deep playoff runs or championships.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why players will listen to a Tyron Lue or a Poppovic much more so than they&rsquo;ll listen to some college coach who has never played in the pros, or some random guy from Spain who is used to coaching guys who could never cut it in the NBA. They won&rsquo;t listen to those guys, they won&rsquo;t respect them.</p>

<p>That way you would not end up players fighting fighting with the coaches.</p>

<p>But more in the sense of humble, down to earth guys, no big egos. Team players.</p>

<p>With basketball it&rsquo;s probably close to impossible, too few players in a team, so a player can have outsized individual impact plus due to the inherent height requirements, the target population is already restricted greatly.</p>

<p>In practical terms, I wonder if clubs could have academies like Ajax Amsterdam has for football, with a ton of scouts worldwide. For the NBA I guess you&rsquo;d want to look at feeder systems outside the traditional ones, so fewer eyes on the NCAA and G-League and more eyes&hellip; I guess internationally? The US doesn&rsquo;t really have a system where if you go outside of those 2 you can find anything decent, I think.</p>

<p>Until we get down to the nitty gritty, it just sounds like what the Nuggets have built over the last decade.</p>

<p>Carmelo Anthony leaving them, lead them down the path of avoiding those type of players.</p>

<p>This is super debatable, after all, look at Spurs (and their general play-style under Popovic), Nuggets (up to a point) and all large number of  European players arriving recently.</p>

<p>The NBA has tracking cameras and the algorithms to figure out how much you should be a playing off your man and that was over a decade ago.</p>

<p>Getting players buying into a specific person to lead them is much more on the &ldquo;human&rdquo; side than the &ldquo;math&rdquo; side of the game.</p>

      <label for="lm9u1bi" class="commentText"><p>In many other sports that include passing, the optimal strategy (though frequently very hard to execute) is passing until the optimal shot is found. Basketball has a much smaller court and individual players can dribble past a few defenders, but it&rsquo;s not inconceivable to think that a more passing game is if not optimal, less risky.</p>

<p>Definitely not as good for each player&rsquo;s bank account, though 😁</p>

<p>Absolutely. Which is not what an NBA team wants. You want good NBA players, not good FIBA players.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s much easier for a player to adjust to a new system because they have a coach guiding them. A coach adjusting to a new system is very difficult because they can&rsquo;t exactly ask the players to teach them. Especially on an already poor team.</p>

Spanish pick and rolls, zoom action, there’s a whole video out there about how basically every action you see now Zeljko did 20 years ago in Europe. So I don’t think that works.</p>

<p>I’m not sure I get what you mean by a coach adjusting to a new system? They are playing the same sport, just a different style. Think Mike D’Antoni (who started in Europe) with phoenix.</p>

      <label for="lm8stg0" class="commentText"><p>Players are more important than systems. Phil Jackson is an all time great coach/mind because he was able to get Jordan/Pippen and Kobe/Shaq, the triangle is irrelevant, he was shit with this same system in New York. The Beautiful game spurs are no longer viable because there is no Tim, Manu, TP (Kawhi later on). Coach pop is still going in SA but hasn’t been relevant since Kawhi Left.</p>

<p>The best system is having an all time great player making as many decisions as possible. Example nuggets, If you’re spreading the ball around you risk having Christian Braun/Aaron Gordon/MPJ making decisions rather than Jokic or Murray, that’s not desirable. Finding 1 or 2 great decision makers (Nuggets) is a lot easier than finding 5 (such as Boston).</p>

<p>We’ve seen young and bad players try to integrate into intricate, motions offenses with Golden State and it did not work. Adding more passes and complicating an offense for young or bad players ain’t it, they’re easily confused and prone to losing confidence.
We’ve also seen how that great system flop without the stars, Look at the years with and without Curry or Klay, it’s gross. Stars &amp;gt; System</p>

<p>TLDR: NBA ball is played different than EuroLeague because the talent gap between players are wider. Kobe sentiment was right, if your superstar is giving up the ball he’s giving it to a far worse player.</p>

<p>If you can’t get/don’t have a Kobe or Jordan (top 7 guy) you better be trying to get the first pick, trade for an All NBA guy (Kawhi And Raptors) or you are not really contending.</p>

Then look at the teams surrounding that champion list throughout history. Detroit isn’t gonna get their shit players to play better cause a European yells at them and tells em to pass more. Fit matters, roster building, cohesive schemes, but Deteoit still needs to bet on Cade elevating them. Boston is great and Mazula and Stevens helps, but if you give them Detroit they won’t make it work till they trade half the roster and Cade or someone is a star.</p>

<p>It’s so weird that you mentioned Pop and Kerr while making this point. These are two coaches that borrowed heavily from the European game, found talent in young / overlooked players, and convinced all-time superstars to sacrifice their ego and give up the ball.</p>

<p>Of course they couldn’t have done it without Duncan / Curry, and I completely agree that having stars is more important than having a system, but that was never the argument here.</p>

<p>The point is that it’s possible to win with that style of basketball. In fact, it’s responsible for the two most successful dynasties of the past 25 years.</p>

      <label for="lm8xbkg" class="commentText"><p>Do you seriously think none of these teams have thought about that? You think among 30 teams no one has <em>ever</em> looked into bringing in a euro coach?</p>

<p>The coaching carousel in the NBA is comically sad, for sure, but I think a lot of that comes down to the fact that no one really knows how much of a difference a coach makes to a team. There&rsquo;s no +/- for coaching, no way of measuring their impact, because 95% of what they do isn&rsquo;t in the game. When no one really knows, they just go off track record and status quo.</p>

<p>Finally, you make a huge assumption that Detroit, or any other team, prioritizes winning. But most of them don&rsquo;t. They prioritize profits. The minimum in for the maximum out. (I will say, the new front office in Detroit seem to have a new attitude towards running the team, thank God).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Just because it works one way does not mean it will work the other way.</p>

<p>European basketball players are trained to follow orders.  So if you tell them to play like an American, they will do it.  If you tell them to play like Chinese, they&rsquo;ll do it.  Anything they&rsquo;re told, they&rsquo;ll follow the coach&rsquo;s orders.</p>

<p>American basketball players are different.  They come from a culture of strong individualism.  They won&rsquo;t follow a European coach&rsquo;s orders if they don&rsquo;t &ldquo;respect&rdquo; the coach and/or they don&rsquo;t like the orders even if they&rsquo;re good ones.  Even the average American players still have the &ldquo;superstar&rdquo; mentalities and big egos.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s why Europeans can learn American style but Americans can&rsquo;t learn European style.</p>

      <label for="lm92xty" class="commentText"><p>I never said robotic.  When I said following orders, what I meant was following the coach&rsquo;s game plans even if it means you will be passing the ball more to your open team mates instead of playing iso and finding a way to score yourself no matter what.</p>

<p>You said it best, European players are taught the team always comes first.  If your coach suddenly tells you to start playing with a different structure, you will still do it right?  For Americans players, they will start complaining immediately if they don&rsquo;t like the new structure.</p>

<p>American players are taught by their families that money and fame comes first.  If you implement Olympiacos motion offense, most American players will hate it.  How can an American player take over a game, become a superstar, and get Nike/Reebok endorsements if they are playing Olympiacos motion offense?  Even American fans will hate watching it.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re missing the point.  For an American player, that doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

<p>They want the iso no matter what.  If you tell an American player that they need to wait for a mismatch, the American player will not listen to you.</p>

<p>Even the fans will hate watching your style of play.</p>

<p>Fans don&rsquo;t like to wait for mismatches to happen.  Fans want to see a superstar player scoring the ball despite two or three players guarding him.</p>

<p>If you implement Olympiacos motion offense, you will lose both NBA players and NBA fans.</p>

<p>NBA culture needs to change first before implementing European style of play for the long term.</p>

<p>Of course, Harden is not dumb.  If the pick is already there then he&rsquo;ll take it before iso.  But that&rsquo;s not the Olympiacos motion offense that you were talking about earlier.  If Harden is resting on the bench, then the Rockets offense dramatically changed.</p>

<p>Olympiacos motion offense does not depend on one player alone.  It is a team effort.</p>

<p>My point is that most NBA players will not be happy with Olympiacos motion offense due to reasons I already explained above.  And they will complain to general management.  You know what happens if enough NBA players complain to the GM, right?</p>

<p>The coach is gone and then the Olympiacos motion offense is also gone.</p>

<p>Then things are back to normal American style of play.</p>

<p>Like I said before, the NBA culture needs to change first.</p>

<p>Jokic,luka,dragic,Rubio, even Tucker to an extent.  Those are the type of personalities you will find in euro league which is extremely rare here in the nba because of how different and valuable players are coming up.</p>

Like they produce talents like doncic etc, coach up outcasts like Jabari Parker with Barcelona, make solid players out of pretty ordinary talent they have all the skills and knowledge you’d need, and have proven it far more than a lot of Americans. They are ahead of the curve on trends (small ball, shooting, offensive actions) it just seems like the most common answer I’ve received is either Lebron didn’t like David Blatt so they are all bad, or some nebulous concept of not being respected.</p>

      <label for="lm8tykx" class="commentText"><p>That’s one way to frame it.</p>

<p>Another way: European coaches might not be able to accept that the player is more important than the coach in the NBA. They might not showcase the necessary people skills required of an NBA coach.</p>

<p>A star player is basically a 250,000,000$ investment. The NBA is a business built on marketable stars, not coaches. If the star player and the coach fight - the coach goes. He’s more replaceable.</p>

<p>I think that European coaches from the old guard (meaning hard nosed, basketball obsessed, X’s and O’s type coaches) function better as assistants. That’s where - to my knowledge - most of the actual basketball stuff comes from. The head coach is there to manage personalities and face the media in the NBA.</p>

      <label for="lm8wa38" class="commentText"><p>If you&rsquo;re rebuilding the goal is to tank so you get a good draft prospect the next draft, not to win more games. Usually a team would go that route if they are actually trying to turn the corner, like the Cavs did when they first hired David Blatt and they had no idea Bron was coming back. By hiring Blatt they felt they had tanked long enough and had a core group so they needed a good coach to give them some structure.</p>

A Euro coach getting in the NBA would probably mean a lot of NBA money being diverted to his Euro connections. Even more if he got successful.</p>

      <label for="lm8t6ki" class="commentText"><p>It is because historically US sports evolves from within and looks down on foreign talent. You see it in every sport, it takes a very long time for the league to accept that there may be another way of doing things. This is not limited to US either. The English Premier League for decades looked down on Europeans. Now, you are hard pressed to find more than 4 English managers of Premier League teams.</p>

<p>The difference here is US sports have so little contact with outside influences that the change is going to take even longer. It&rsquo;ll come eventually. Just look at how baseball is shifting.</p>

      <label for="lm8tepi" class="commentText"><p>Lol I know you’re joking re: goat mask sex ritual etc. But there’s definitely a closed circle of people who get offers in the NBA. I wouldn’t call it a conspiracy though - unless you are willing to say the same about every high level management job in America, in basically every industry.</p>

<p>An NBA coach is basically just a media personality, and player manager (closer to a high level middle manager in the corporate sense). They have assistants for actual basketball stuff.</p>

<p>In order to get a coaching gig you have to convince executives that you’re responsible with a camera in your face, and that you’re a people person (aka you won’t piss off their $60,000,000 star player investment). You do those things, and you have the resume/acumen, and you might get a job.</p>

<p>But in order to convince an owner of that, you need to be in that circle.</p>

<p>Also to OPs point, having an accent immediately puts a coach at a disadvantage when it comes to the media. Look at how much mileage the media got out of Darkos angry rant last year. Mike Brown had basically the exact same rant but nobody really memed him or laughed about it because he doesn’t have an accent. People weren’t even being rude about Darko, they agreed with him. They just inherently took it less seriously because he talks with an accent.</p>

<p>He has 9 EuroLeague Championships with 5 different teams. I grew up with Phil Jackson, he can be tough, I agree about it but Obradovic is always like that, even with the press conferences.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not only about the mics during the game. The difference starts with the youth teams.</p>

<p>The mentality is so different in Europe, coaches from Europe may be successful in the NBA for sure but not in the way they do in Europe.</p>

      <label for="lm8v5ih" class="commentText"><p>Because teams don&rsquo;t get their ideas from reddit, especially from Users with 12 karma.</p>

<p>I got quite a few more tho, so ill pass along your thoughts if you&rsquo;re nice to me. Ok /s</p>

<p>On a more serious note, you act as if a good Euro coach would dramatically change the Pistons lol. You keep saying they got no star, they suck, blah blah blah. Coo.</p>

<p>So how many Wins do u think a good Euro coach will add to Detroit after 1 year? Oh but it takes time? So you want the Euro coach to get a long leash (in terms of years) in your hypothetical situation? Ok. After 5 years? Too lazy to look up lol. But Detroit&rsquo;s record last season, then 5 years from now under a Euro coach. What&rsquo;s their record? How many wins did they add?</p>

<p>Dunno my guess for exact number, but my bet is they&rsquo;re still not a playoff team. MAYBE fighting in the Play Ins.</p>

<p>But again in your hypothetical situation, you&rsquo;re probably telling me, hey! Thats a great start tho. Most would disagree, but you know what would probably happen? Those few, especially in the media, that do agree or wanna focus on the Pistons improvement (lol or w/e u call it) will to your point, sure, focus on that Euro coach.</p>

<p>Know what else theyd do? Dont act like you don&rsquo;t know how Espn works. Theyd focus, and show footage, on the part where the Euro coach is always going ballistic and cursing out his players.</p>

<p>You think a Star or heck any player with a brain will wanna go to Detroit after seeing that? Either be real with your answer or lie and continue with the hypothetical but thats as far as im going. Hmm stay on your team or 28 other teams.. or go to Detroit to play &ldquo;cool team ball while getting cursed out every 5 mins by the Euro coach&rdquo;. Tough decision.</p>

      <label for="lm915s3" class="commentText"><p>Because one of, if not the biggest skill an NBA coach needs is the ability to manage personalities.  The NBA is all about star power.  Teams are built around stars.  So if there’s a clash between a rising star and a new coach, the coach is gone <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> times.  </p>

<p>Euro teams are known for working the exact opposite way.  The coach is king and everyone on the team bows to what they say.  </p>

<p>So why would a team hire a coach who is going to demand unwavering authority when the team has no intention of giving it to them.  And why would a euro coach take that offer?</p>

<p>If anything, it’d make more sense to hire an American coach who manages egos well and have them study the coaching systems of more successful Xs-and-Os coaches both local and abroad.  </p>

Blatt in Europe wasn’t really the average Eiro coach, he was considered a chill guy, Messina was a controller but his spell was very short.
In NBA Your role as a coach is so extremely different, the amount of games is different, job security is different, culture is different.
There is no way JJ Redick is a better tactician that Jasikevicius.
But it is highly doubtful Jasikevicius would do better at Lakers</p>

<p>It seems like most people either prefer the approach of just continuing to lose and hope you get good draft picks, or that American players can’t handle hard coaching?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that the OP said this makes it hard to take anything they said seriously. Dude obviously knows little to nothing about basketball. The reason so many lower end NBA dudes tear it up in FIBA and Euro leagues is because they don&rsquo;t have to consistently play against NBA talent. It&rsquo;s not that the coaches are basketball wizards who have mastered the art of coaching.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t even to say that the idea isn&rsquo;t worth exploring, but grabbing some coach from overseas where the rules aren&rsquo;t even the same and thinking they&rsquo;ll automatically be a massive improvement is comical. Not to mention the assumption that a top Euro league coach would even want to relocate to the US and risk failing.</p>

      <label for="lm9r6qm" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t watch Euroleague, but I do watch FIBA. I don&rsquo;t think it matters though, since the answer isn&rsquo;t really related to it.</p>

<p>In the NBA what you want is to be very good or very bad. Very good to contend for championship or very bad to have a chance at lottery picks. What you don&rsquo;t want is to be in the middle. Not good enough to contend, not bad enough to get lottery picks. (Exemptions are owners who only care about money)</p>

<p>With that, assuming the Euro coaches do a better job for these very bad teams, they will only be in the middle. The place you don&rsquo;t want to be in the NBA.</p>

<p>As for the Patty Mills of the FIBA world, it&rsquo;s because these players are relegated to roles in the NBA. They are limited to these roles they play. In FIBA they play a bigger role, they control the ball more, get more possessions and plays called for them.</p>

<p>As for the Euro coaches, their plays work in Euroleague. But can they make it work in superstar centric NBA? With focus on can &ldquo;they&rdquo;. Similar plays might work with other teams, but can Euro coaches make it work with the very bad teams you propose hire them? Remember, these teams are not just low in talent, they are ill fitting as well. And if they make it work, again, you don&rsquo;t actually want that to happen.</p>

<p>In the end, I do think high level American coaches can do what high level Euro coaches can do anyway.</p>
