      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fcine9/why_dont_bad_teams_hire_euro_coaches/"><p>Why don’t bad teams hire Euro coaches?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I’ve always wondered why bad teams don’t try to play differently from good teams. Like watching the pistons or the wizards play heavy iso ball with Cade and Poole respectively, surely they don’t think they are gonna win right?</p>

<p>Similarly with all the memes about like FIBA patty Mills for Australia, or other low end nba players tearing it up in FIBA basketball. Surely it is a little obvious that there’s some really good offensive minds out there that can turn average NBA guys into really good FIBA players.</p>

<p>My theory is if we completely suck, why not hire Zeljko Obradovic, Georgios Bartzokas or Sarunas Jasikevicius and run a slower pace but a more well drilled offence to get your crappier players better looks. Also if you wanna watch their offences on YouTube they are like incredible. Dan Hurley would also be good for this, his offences are pretty intricate.</p>

<p>The obvious counter I see is these coaches are far more harsh and demanding than the regular NBA coaches, and players and agents won’t wanna play for them. But like surely popovic was similar back in the day? Hard to play for but you get the hang of it and then have success and the players are more forgiving.</p>

<p>Now with that being said I don’t think these coaches would win the title with the pistons or wizards, but surely they’d get more wins, teach younger players how to work like a professional and make more difficult reads while also making their job easier with constant movement.</p>

<p>My other idea, similar to Manchester City owning teams in other leagues to send their players on loan, could the lakers buy Virtus Bologna for example and send their kids on loan to play in Europe to learn this sorta stuff? Would be sick for their draft picks to play against Partizan for example and experience that pressure.</p>

<p>Lemme know what you think orrrr if you want some euro league to watch, happy to send recommendations!</p>

<p>Shit even if they do, it can be a struggle.</p>

<p>But there are plenty of euro coaches on the bench of various teams.</p>

<p>Plus, logistically, head offices aren&rsquo;t going to be involved in the same coaching circles as the ones in Europe. Nor are current NBA coaches, who give euro coaches their first jobs.</p>

<p>Like that’s not a reason to not try it if you’re the pistons, you should try something different it’s obviously not working, and if you can’t attract A+ nba coaches in Detroit, you could try A+ coaching just from Europe.</p>

      <label for="lm8mjog" class="commentText"><p>I will never disagree with the Pistons hiring new blood over dude&rsquo;s who have proven to not be great. Pistons run their franchise like a 14 year old casual fan runs his 2K team.</p>

<p>Picking the players with the highest overalls, regardless of how they play and then picking the only coaches they recognise from a list of potential hires.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I love about the Thunder, Thunder hired new blood and he&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>

<p>I think for why a team wouldn&rsquo;t hire a euro coach, over a guy who&rsquo;s been in the NBA for a long time is the same. Except instead of the needing the player&rsquo;s respect, they need the front offices. They need to trust their hire to be able to understand the dynamics of the NBA.</p>

<p>The existence of David Blatt, makes a lot of front offices weary too. I feel like all euro coach hire talk has died since that all went down.</p>

<p>But my whole point is, if you’re Detroit, you’ll never be as rich or desired as the lakers or golden state or whoever, so why do you need to conform to “the dynamics of the nba”? Be weird and try new stuff, like the bad boys did! I just think if you had a completely European offence you would be different and give yourself a better chance than trying to just be poor man’s lakers or whatever?</p>

<p>Like his response to being celebrated by his players for getting his first NBA win, was to be like &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve won pro games before&rdquo; like wtf lol.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why do you need to conform to the dynamics of the nba</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because they are an NBA team. The dynamics I&rsquo;m talking about are things like 82 game schedule, wealthy players, black American culture, 7 game playoff series, hyper athleticism etc etc. You can&rsquo;t ignore reality.</p>

<p>Yeah I don’t think the race of players would impact the kinda offence id run, and I’d check how NFL coaches speak to their players before suggesting a race or people couldn’t handle a style of coaching. Idk man that’s a weird one for me, I might just leave it there.</p>

      <label for="lm8njxn" class="commentText"><p>1 - but why not try? Like we know their offences give team USA some issues, so it kinda works with less talent.</p>

<p>2 - that’s true but you’re Detroit, you have no stars and Popovic was like this with Duncan, Parker, Ginobili. You get their rookie contract and a restricted next deal. You’re so sweet.</p>

<p>3 - okay but why not try, give em 5 years guaranteed and then it is very clear who is in charge of the team.</p>

      <label for="lm8o0ro" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re onto something&hellip;NBA is a flawed program in a flawed system. Euro coaches will need to sacrifice a whole lot and expose a whole lot in the NBA. Att the end of the day even the suckiest team the owner still makes a lot of Money. You will need an anti establishment owner, as a start. For correction David Blatt was an American born highschool, college, NBA player who then went to Europe so he was still heavily rooted on American coaching</p>

      <label for="lm8ohfi" class="commentText"><p>Wow first guy to agree! I agree it’d be really hard and a lot of pressure, but what have you really got to lose? If the goal is to win a title, Detroit needs to be different no?</p>
