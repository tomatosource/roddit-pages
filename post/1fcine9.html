      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fcine9/why_dont_bad_teams_hire_euro_coaches/"><p>Why don’t bad teams hire Euro coaches?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I’ve always wondered why bad teams don’t try to play differently from good teams. Like watching the pistons or the wizards play heavy iso ball with Cade and Poole respectively, surely they don’t think they are gonna win right?</p>

<p>Similarly with all the memes about like FIBA patty Mills for Australia, or other low end nba players tearing it up in FIBA basketball. Surely it is a little obvious that there’s some really good offensive minds out there that can turn average NBA guys into really good FIBA players.</p>

<p>My theory is if we completely suck, why not hire Zeljko Obradovic, Georgios Bartzokas or Sarunas Jasikevicius and run a slower pace but a more well drilled offence to get your crappier players better looks. Also if you wanna watch their offences on YouTube they are like incredible. Dan Hurley would also be good for this, his offences are pretty intricate.</p>

<p>The obvious counter I see is these coaches are far more harsh and demanding than the regular NBA coaches, and players and agents won’t wanna play for them. But like surely popovic was similar back in the day? Hard to play for but you get the hang of it and then have success and the players are more forgiving.</p>

<p>Now with that being said I don’t think these coaches would win the title with the pistons or wizards, but surely they’d get more wins, teach younger players how to work like a professional and make more difficult reads while also making their job easier with constant movement.</p>

<p>My other idea, similar to Manchester City owning teams in other leagues to send their players on loan, could the lakers buy Virtus Bologna for example and send their kids on loan to play in Europe to learn this sorta stuff? Would be sick for their draft picks to play against Partizan for example and experience that pressure.</p>

<p>Lemme know what you think orrrr if you want some euro league to watch, happy to send recommendations!</p>

<p>Edit: I’m very surprised to see so many nba fans so vehemently against this idea. It seems like most people either prefer the approach of just continuing to lose and hope you get good draft picks, or that American players can’t handle hard coaching?</p>

<p>2-In Euro, the coaches are the generals and the players are his soldiers. Even he was to bench and curse the players, even the star ones. They have to shut up and take it. In the NBA, the players are the ones with power, if Star players want the coaches gone, they are gone.</p>

<p>3-Many winning coaches in Euro have said before that they don&rsquo;t wanna leave their Euro homeland becuz that is where they are winning and they don&rsquo;t wanna compromise their authority and adapt to NBA culture</p>

<p>JJ Reddick has no skillsets, wins, or experience.  Teams want someone who impresses FO, ownership, and the players.  If those EU coaches can schmooze a room like Doc Rivers they can headcoach in the NBA.  Their main problem is they are not in the US and not working in the NBA.</p>

<p>If those guys were impressing NBA players and GM’s as assistants they would have way more interest.</p>

      <label for="lm91hlo" class="commentText"><p>Euro basketball is also very different to the NBA which I think is one of the biggest things. The NBA court is longer, wider, the 3 point line is further out, and there is a defensive 3 second rule. This was all designed to make the NBA higher scoring and more exciting. This makes the way European teams play not ideal in the NBA.</p>

<p>The NBA favors the athletic players who can cover the extra space on defense and exploit it on offense. It&rsquo;s part of why some guys in the NBA struggle a lot in FIBA because of how different the game is. I think people have tried bringing over the European style to the NBA, but it&rsquo;s not as effective as the more normal NBA style of play.</p>

<p>2 - that’s true but you’re Detroit, you have no stars and Popovic was like this with Duncan, Parker, Ginobili. You get their rookie contract and a restricted next deal. You’re so sweet.</p>

<p>3 - okay but why not try, give em 5 years guaranteed and then it is very clear who is in charge of the team.</p>

      <label for="lm8tnsf" class="commentText"><p>A few coaches and teams have tried. Mike D’Antoni was a successful coach in Italy before getting his first NBA job and returned to Italy before landing the Suns gig.</p>

<p>Blatt was one of the most notable coaches to make the jump and had his job for less than two years, which isn’t going to give already successful Euro coaches confidence they should leave their jobs for the NBA even if they know the contract will be guaranteed.</p>

<p>And then there are guys like Messina and Scariolo, who left Europe to be NBA assistants but didn’t get a shot at being a head coach in the league.</p>

<p>NBA owners and front office execs should take more risks and try to find a stable coach, but it’s much easier and safer to hire a retread and call it a day.</p>

      <label for="lm8sn3z" class="commentText"><p>1 - I think it&rsquo;s unrealistic to expect even a great head coach to turn a trash team into a contender. And in the NBA if you can&rsquo;t contend you are either young and building around a developing superstar who will get that coach fired, or you are rebuilding and trying to lose anyways.</p>

<p>2 - Popovic was in a special situation being both head coach and general manager. In any other Team, if the players don&rsquo;t like the coach, they complain to the GM and he&rsquo;s gone. Not so with the Spurs. If you complained you got benched or traded to the team offering the best deal.</p>

<p>3 - You can still fire the coach, the team just has to pay him.</p>

      <label for="lm8t3cu" class="commentText"><p>1 - Cowardice. No GM/Front office wants to be the first one to do this and then it fails and they are the ones with egg on their face and an angry fan base.</p>

<p>2- completely agree this is what a team like the wizards, Detroit, and hornets should be doing. None of the players there have proven themselves worthy of having super star authority it makes no sense to agree to any player demands from lower end teams. However this sub reddit is a hive mind and don’t want to think for themselves for a bit.</p>

<p>3- this is the only realistic excuse but I think people forget that money really does talk. If you give them enough money leaving their homeland for a few years will not seem as bad. Which for teams like Detroit or the Wizards getting an elite coaching staff and working with pieces should be priority since absolutely no top tier players want to go to your destination.</p>

That&rsquo;s their skillsets.  There&rsquo;s not a lot of great passing, teamwork oriented, &ldquo;i&rsquo;ll do the dirty stuff&rdquo; superstars in the NBA.  If you take the coach&rsquo;s side, that&rsquo;s how you end up with a team with no superstars because the players will ask for trades out of there.  You don&rsquo;t always get superstars back.</p>

Getting a dirty work guy thats more talented than most euro players but isn’t an NBA star, but is athletic enough to build a specific role is the better direction and it frees up your stars to battle with their stars. Also the reason why you won’t see star centric Euro ball is cause no one is that level to get that. If they had Lebrons in Europe then they’d welcome a heliocentric star driven style. Those guys go to the NBA.</p>

      <label for="lm8ye5i" class="commentText"><p>You are missing the point:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Euro Basketball is very different from US basketball. It starts at the ruleset continues over the way players act and are drafted (im the EU youth teams exists in the NBA people come from college, now I will die on that hill and claim that EU players are far more professional than their american counterparts) and in the Euro team synergy and defense also matters mich more. What are those coaches supposed to do? Try to teach americans from college who never learned how to play team defense the ins and outs of said defense? Coaches need the right environment to function.
Drafting also is often not a coaching decision but a GM decision and GMs rarely if ever risk their own job in order to draft the choice
the coach wants, if there is a safer option out there. Im the EU the team structure serves the club and coach.</p></li>

<li><p>it would require the organisation to put all of its eggs in one basket and bet on their coach… no organisation will do that because they are afraid of the public torching them for it.
And it would only work until they finally have a star player. Once Cade for example becomes a star and the team becomes successful Cade is not gonna put up with it anymore and Detroid will be afraid to lose the recently won success and rather fire the coach than trade Cunningham.</p></li>

<li><p>most of those coaches are from the balkan and very home focused. The geographical distance will always be an issue for them as a result. 4 years guaranteed have also never kept any franchise in the history of mankind from firing its coach early.
And the coach will never be in charge of the team. NBA basketball isn’t like other basketball played in the world, to be quite honest it doesn’t even necessarily constitute as sport in my opinion bit rather resembles as hollywood event and storylines people follow that plays on the court. People don’t watch because of the sport but rather put in ad breaks every 2min of play, talk about legacy and all other stuff that has nothing to do with what is happening on the field. And the teams aren’t in the hand of a club but an owner who may consider a season a success if he made money, completely unrelated from result based success on the court. That just isn’t an environment that gives power to its coaches but rather gives it to its players, as those sell the tickets and build your brand.</p></li>

<p>Plus, logistically, head offices aren&rsquo;t going to be involved in the same coaching circles as the ones in Europe. Nor are current NBA coaches, who give euro coaches their first jobs.</p>

<p>Picking the players with the highest overalls, regardless of how they play and then picking the only coaches they recognise from a list of potential hires.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I love about the Thunder, Thunder hired new blood and he&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>

<p>I think for why a team wouldn&rsquo;t hire a euro coach, over a guy who&rsquo;s been in the NBA for a long time is the same. Except instead of the needing the player&rsquo;s respect, they need the front offices. They need to trust their hire to be able to understand the dynamics of the NBA.</p>

<p>The existence of David Blatt, makes a lot of front offices weary too. I feel like all euro coach hire talk has died since that all went down.</p>

<p>But my whole point is, if you’re Detroit, you’ll never be as rich or desired as the lakers or golden state or whoever, so why do you need to conform to “the dynamics of the nba”? Be weird and try new stuff, like the bad boys did! I just think if you had a completely European offence you would be different and give yourself a better chance than trying to just be poor man’s lakers or whatever?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Because they are an NBA team. The dynamics I&rsquo;m talking about are things like 82 game schedule, wealthy players, black American culture, 7 game playoff series, hyper athleticism etc etc. You can&rsquo;t ignore reality.</p>

<p>Who cares about the NFL. In the NBA, often 90% to sometimes 100% of the locker room is black american men. The unique culture of Black America is something you do need to have a grasp on and most basketball coaches at a high level do. It&rsquo;s just one the many NBA dynamics a head coach has to grasp, ignorant to say otherwise.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think you really understand what a coach is or what they do. At the NBA level, they are motivators, they&rsquo;re leaders.</p>

<p>A lot of the stuff you&rsquo;re talking about is something assistants do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>before suggesting a race or people couldn’t handle a style of coaching</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your reading comprehension has been pretty bad all over this thread. But this has to be the worst. Black American Culture is apart of the dynamic of the NBA, it&rsquo;s confronting and culture shocking to anyone who has never experienced that. I never said white europeans couldn&rsquo;t handle coaching at the NBA level because they are white. Please read what you respond to.</p>

<p>It showed he was not mature enough for the NBA and that he thought he was above it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not the fact that he didn&rsquo;t celebrate it. It&rsquo;s the fact that he told his players to fuck off and shut up. When you&rsquo;re trying to lead a group of people, having them celebrate you, only for you to turn them down and be like Nah I&rsquo;ve already done this. Just make you seem like a douche.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reason no one has ever given him another shot in the NBA.</p>

      <label for="lm8p15p" class="commentText"><p>The issue isn&rsquo;t that coaches can&rsquo;t find more clever ways to play. If it was as simple as that, you could hire any one of hundreds of college coaches or Euro or even South American coaches.</p>

<p>The issue is that NBA players, especially young ones, are unbelievably difficult to motivate and control. They make too much money, they&rsquo;re too empowered, and they&rsquo;re often deeply suspicious of authority and leadership. Almost everyone they talk to has a hidden motive and wants to enrich themselves in some way through them.</p>

<p>For these reasons among others, the only kind of coaches most NBA players are willing to accept the authority of, are ex NBA players. Or, failing that, at least coaches who come with a proven track record of success, including multiple deep playoff runs or championships.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why players will listen to a Tyron Lue or a Poppovic much more so than they&rsquo;ll listen to some college coach who has never played in the pros, or some random guy from Spain who is used to coaching guys who could never cut it in the NBA. They won&rsquo;t listen to those guys, they won&rsquo;t respect them.</p>

      <label for="lm8stg0" class="commentText"><p>Players are more important than systems. Phil Jackson is an all time great coach/mind because he was able to get Jordan/Pippen and Kobe/Shaq, the triangle is irrelevant, he was shit with this same system in New York. The Beautiful game spurs are no longer viable because there is no Tim, Manu, TP (Kawhi later on). Coach pop is still going in SA but hasn’t been relevant since Kawhi Left.</p>

<p>The best system is having an all time great player making as many decisions as possible. Example nuggets, If you’re spreading the ball around you risk having Christian Braun/Aaron Gordon/MPJ making decisions rather than Jokic or Murray, that’s not desirable. Finding 1 or 2 great decision makers (Nuggets) is a lot easier than finding 5 (such as Boston).</p>

<p>We’ve seen young and bad players try to integrate into intricate, motions offenses with Golden State and it did not work. Adding more passes and complicating an offense for young or bad players ain’t it, they’re easily confused and prone to losing confidence.
We’ve also seen how that great system flop without the stars, Look at the years with and without Curry or Klay, it’s gross. Stars &amp;gt; System</p>

<p>TLDR: NBA ball is played different than EuroLeague because the talent gap between players are wider. Kobe sentiment was right, if your superstar is giving up the ball he’s giving it to a far worse player.</p>

<p>If you can’t get/don’t have a Kobe or Jordan (top 7 guy) you better be trying to get the first pick, trade for an All NBA guy (Kawhi And Raptors) or you are not really contending.</p>

<p>Three heads aren’t better than one when it’s Cade Cunningham, Jaden Ivey and Malik Beasley vs Luka Doncic. Ain’t enough passing, cutting and screening in the world to overcome the difference in talent.</p>

Then look at the teams surrounding that champion list throughout history. Detroit isn’t gonna get their shit players to play better cause a European yells at them and tells em to pass more. Fit matters, roster building, cohesive schemes, but Deteoit still needs to bet on Cade elevating them. Boston is great and Mazula and Stevens helps, but if you give them Detroit they won’t make it work till they trade half the roster and Cade or someone is a star.</p>

<p>Absolutely. Which is not what an NBA team wants. You want good NBA players, not good FIBA players.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s much easier for a player to adjust to a new system because they have a coach guiding them. A coach adjusting to a new system is very difficult because they can&rsquo;t exactly ask the players to teach them. Especially on an already poor team.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Just because it works one way does not mean it will work the other way.</p>

<p>European basketball players are trained to follow orders.  So if you tell them to play like an American, they will do it.  If you tell them to play like Chinese, they&rsquo;ll do it.  Anything they&rsquo;re told, they&rsquo;ll follow the coach&rsquo;s orders.</p>

<p>American basketball players are different.  They come from a culture of strong individualism.  They won&rsquo;t follow a European coach&rsquo;s orders if they don&rsquo;t &ldquo;respect&rdquo; the coach and/or they don&rsquo;t like the orders even if they&rsquo;re good ones.  Even the average American players still have the &ldquo;superstar&rdquo; mentalities and big egos.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s why Europeans can learn American style but Americans can&rsquo;t learn European style.</p>

When I said following orders, what I meant was following the coach&rsquo;s game plans even if it means you will be passing the ball more to your open team mates instead of playing iso and finding a way to score yourself no matter what.</p>

<p>You said it best, European players are taught the team always comes first.  If your coach suddenly tells you to start playing with a different structure, you will still do it right?  For Americans players, they will start complaining immediately if they don&rsquo;t like the new structure.</p>

<p>American players are taught by their families that money and fame comes first.  If you implement Olympiacos motion offense, most American players will hate it.  How can an American player take over a game, become a superstar, and get Nike/Reebok endorsements if they are playing Olympiacos motion offense?  Even American fans will hate watching it.</p>

      <label for="lm8tykx" class="commentText"><p>That’s one way to frame it.</p>

<p>Another way: European coaches might not be able to accept that the player is more important than the coach in the NBA. They might not showcase the necessary people skills required of an NBA coach.</p>

<p>A star player is basically a 250,000,000$ investment. The NBA is a business built on marketable stars, not coaches. If the star player and the coach fight - the coach goes. He’s more replaceable.</p>

<p>I think that European coaches from the old guard (meaning hard nosed, basketball obsessed, X’s and O’s type coaches) function better as assistants. That’s where - to my knowledge - most of the actual basketball stuff comes from. The head coach is there to manage personalities and face the media in the NBA.</p>

      <label for="lm8qq3h" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve thought of it too in the past and I think that the reason is that Euro coaches have their own system of connections through which they find, pick, develop and give opportunities to players. A Euro coach getting in the NBA would probably mean a lot of NBA money being diverted to his Euro connections. Even more if he got successful.</p>

      <label for="lm8reb2" class="commentText"><p>I guess I don’t understand why though? Like they produce talents like doncic etc, coach up outcasts like Jabari Parker with Barcelona, make solid players out of pretty ordinary talent they have all the skills and knowledge you’d need, and have proven it far more than a lot of Americans. They are ahead of the curve on trends (small ball, shooting, offensive actions) it just seems like the most common answer I’ve received is either Lebron didn’t like David Blatt so they are all bad, or some nebulous concept of not being respected.</p>

<p>Even in a losing team, there&rsquo;s a ton of non-basketball related drama that a coach has to deal with. American celebrity culture isn&rsquo;t like european celebrity culture as well.</p>

<p>I mean look at how the US has celebrity culture even around their politics. It&rsquo;s a lot to take in.</p>

      <label for="lm8uli7" class="commentText"><p>I mean it’s precisely that, dealing with nba talent is completely different than dealing with euro league(any European league for that matter) and those who do come over are the more established names who have a resume which honestly does not hold up unless they know how to player  manage a different set of personalities.</p>

<p>Jokic,luka,dragic,Rubio, even Tucker to an extent.  Those are the type of personalities you will find in euro league which is extremely rare here in the nba because of how different and valuable players are coming up.</p>

      <label for="lm8t6ki" class="commentText"><p>It is because historically US sports evolves from within and looks down on foreign talent. You see it in every sport, it takes a very long time for the league to accept that there may be another way of doing things. This is not limited to US either. The English Premier League for decades looked down on Europeans. Now, you are hard pressed to find more than 4 English managers of Premier League teams.</p>

<p>The difference here is US sports have so little contact with outside influences that the change is going to take even longer. It&rsquo;ll come eventually. Just look at how baseball is shifting.</p>

<p>Also the reason the league is a copy-cat league. Only 2 GMs have been on the same team for longer than 8 years. 18 GMs were hired in 2020 or later.</p>

<p>It is incredibly easy to get fired, GMs would rather play it safe, play through the consensus so if they&rsquo;re wrong they can at least cover their ass a bit</p>

      <label for="lm8xbkg" class="commentText"><p>Do you seriously think none of these teams have thought about that? You think among 30 teams no one has <em>ever</em> looked into bringing in a euro coach?</p>

<p>The coaching carousel in the NBA is comically sad, for sure, but I think a lot of that comes down to the fact that no one really knows how much of a difference a coach makes to a team. There&rsquo;s no +/- for coaching, no way of measuring their impact, because 95% of what they do isn&rsquo;t in the game. When no one really knows, they just go off track record and status quo.</p>

<p>Finally, you make a huge assumption that Detroit, or any other team, prioritizes winning. But most of them don&rsquo;t. They prioritize profits. The minimum in for the maximum out. (I will say, the new front office in Detroit seem to have a new attitude towards running the team, thank God).</p>

      <label for="lm8tepi" class="commentText"><p>Lol I know you’re joking re: goat mask sex ritual etc. But there’s definitely a closed circle of people who get offers in the NBA. I wouldn’t call it a conspiracy though - unless you are willing to say the same about every high level management job in America, in basically every industry.</p>

<p>An NBA coach is basically just a media personality, and player manager (closer to a high level middle manager in the corporate sense). They have assistants for actual basketball stuff.</p>

<p>In order to get a coaching gig you have to convince executives that you’re responsible with a camera in your face, and that you’re a people person (aka you won’t piss off their $60,000,000 star player investment). You do those things, and you have the resume/acumen, and you might get a job.</p>

<p>But in order to convince an owner of that, you need to be in that circle.</p>

<p>Also to OPs point, having an accent immediately puts a coach at a disadvantage when it comes to the media. Look at how much mileage the media got out of Darkos angry rant last year. Mike Brown had basically the exact same rant but nobody really memed him or laughed about it because he doesn’t have an accent. People weren’t even being rude about Darko, they agreed with him. They just inherently took it less seriously because he talks with an accent.</p>

<p>He has 9 EuroLeague Championships with 5 different teams. I grew up with Phil Jackson, he can be tough, I agree about it but Obradovic is always like that, even with the press conferences.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not only about the mics during the game. The difference starts with the youth teams.</p>

<p>The mentality is so different in Europe, coaches from Europe may be successful in the NBA for sure but not in the way they do in Europe.</p>

      <label for="lm8v5ih" class="commentText"><p>Because teams don&rsquo;t get their ideas from reddit, especially from Users with 12 karma.</p>

<p>I got quite a few more tho, so ill pass along your thoughts if you&rsquo;re nice to me. Ok /s</p>

<p>On a more serious note, you act as if a good Euro coach would dramatically change the Pistons lol. You keep saying they got no star, they suck, blah blah blah. Coo.</p>

<p>So how many Wins do u think a good Euro coach will add to Detroit after 1 year? Oh but it takes time? So you want the Euro coach to get a long leash (in terms of years) in your hypothetical situation? Ok. After 5 years? Too lazy to look up lol. But Detroit&rsquo;s record last season, then 5 years from now under a Euro coach. What&rsquo;s their record? How many wins did they add?</p>

<p>Dunno my guess for exact number, but my bet is they&rsquo;re still not a playoff team. MAYBE fighting in the Play Ins.</p>

<p>But again in your hypothetical situation, you&rsquo;re probably telling me, hey! Thats a great start tho. Most would disagree, but you know what would probably happen? Those few, especially in the media, that do agree or wanna focus on the Pistons improvement (lol or w/e u call it) will to your point, sure, focus on that Euro coach.</p>

<p>Know what else theyd do? Dont act like you don&rsquo;t know how Espn works. Theyd focus, and show footage, on the part where the Euro coach is always going ballistic and cursing out his players.</p>

<p>You think a Star or heck any player with a brain will wanna go to Detroit after seeing that? Either be real with your answer or lie and continue with the hypothetical but thats as far as im going. Hmm stay on your team or 28 other teams.. or go to Detroit to play &ldquo;cool team ball while getting cursed out every 5 mins by the Euro coach&rdquo;. Tough decision.</p>

      <label for="lm8wa38" class="commentText"><p>If you&rsquo;re rebuilding the goal is to tank so you get a good draft prospect the next draft, not to win more games. Usually a team would go that route if they are actually trying to turn the corner, like the Cavs did when they first hired David Blatt and they had no idea Bron was coming back. By hiring Blatt they felt they had tanked long enough and had a core group so they needed a good coach to give them some structure.</p>

      <label for="lm915s3" class="commentText"><p>Because one of, if not the biggest skill an NBA coach needs is the ability to manage personalities.  The NBA is all about star power.  Teams are built around stars.  So if there’s a clash between a rising star and a new coach, the coach is gone <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> times.  </p>

<p>Euro teams are known for working the exact opposite way.  The coach is king and everyone on the team bows to what they say.  </p>

<p>So why would a team hire a coach who is going to demand unwavering authority when the team has no intention of giving it to them.  And why would a euro coach take that offer?</p>

<p>If anything, it’d make more sense to hire an American coach who manages egos well and have them study the coaching systems of more successful Xs-and-Os coaches both local and abroad.  </p>

Euro coaches will need to sacrifice a whole lot and expose a whole lot in the NBA. Att the end of the day even the suckiest team the owner still makes a lot of Money. You will need an anti establishment owner, as a start. For correction David Blatt was an American born highschool, college, NBA player who then went to Europe so he was still heavily rooted on American coaching</p>
