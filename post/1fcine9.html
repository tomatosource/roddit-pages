      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fcine9/why_dont_bad_teams_hire_euro_coaches/"><p>Why don’t bad teams hire Euro coaches?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I’ve always wondered why bad teams don’t try to play differently from good teams. Like watching the pistons or the wizards play heavy iso ball with Cade and Poole respectively, surely they don’t think they are gonna win right?</p>

<p>Similarly with all the memes about like FIBA patty Mills for Australia, or other low end nba players tearing it up in FIBA basketball. Surely it is a little obvious that there’s some really good offensive minds out there that can turn average NBA guys into really good FIBA players.</p>

<p>My theory is if we completely suck, why not hire Zeljko Obradovic, Georgios Bartzokas or Sarunas Jasikevicius and run a slower pace but a more well drilled offence to get your crappier players better looks. Also if you wanna watch their offences on YouTube they are like incredible. Dan Hurley would also be good for this, his offences are pretty intricate.</p>

<p>The obvious counter I see is these coaches are far more harsh and demanding than the regular NBA coaches, and players and agents won’t wanna play for them. But like surely popovic was similar back in the day? Hard to play for but you get the hang of it and then have success and the players are more forgiving.</p>

<p>Now with that being said I don’t think these coaches would win the title with the pistons or wizards, but surely they’d get more wins, teach younger players how to work like a professional and make more difficult reads while also making their job easier with constant movement.</p>

<p>My other idea, similar to Manchester City owning teams in other leagues to send their players on loan, could the lakers buy Virtus Bologna for example and send their kids on loan to play in Europe to learn this sorta stuff? Would be sick for their draft picks to play against Partizan for example and experience that pressure.</p>

<p>Lemme know what you think orrrr if you want some euro league to watch, happy to send recommendations!</p>

<p>2-In Euro, the coaches are the generals and the players are his soldiers. Even he was to bench and curse the players, even the star ones. They have to shut up and take it. In the NBA, the players are the ones with power, if Star players want the coaches gone, they are gone.</p>

<p>3-Many winning coaches in Euro have said before that they don&rsquo;t wanna leave their Euro homeland bevuz that is where they are winning and they don&rsquo;t wanna compromise their authority and adapt to NBA culture</p>

<p>2 - that’s true but you’re Detroit, you have no stars and Popovic was like this with Duncan, Parker, Ginobili. You get their rookie contract and a restricted next deal. You’re so sweet.</p>

<p>3 - okay but why not try, give em 5 years guaranteed and then it is very clear who is in charge of the team.</p>

      <label for="lm8sn3z" class="commentText"><p>1 - I think it&rsquo;s unrealistic to expect even a great head coach to turn a trash team into a contender. And in the NBA if you can&rsquo;t contend you are either young and building around a developing superstar who will get that coach fired, or you are rebuilding and trying to lose anyways.</p>

<p>2 - Popovic was in a special situation being both head coach and general manager. In any other Team, if the players don&rsquo;t like the coach, they complain to the GM and he&rsquo;s gone. Not so with the Spurs. If you complained you got benched or traded to the team offering the best deal.</p>

<p>3 - You can still fire the coach, the team just has to pay him.</p>

<p>Shit even if they do, it can be a struggle.</p>

<p>But there are plenty of euro coaches on the bench of various teams.</p>

<p>Plus, logistically, head offices aren&rsquo;t going to be involved in the same coaching circles as the ones in Europe. Nor are current NBA coaches, who give euro coaches their first jobs.</p>

<p>Picking the players with the highest overalls, regardless of how they play and then picking the only coaches they recognise from a list of potential hires.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I love about the Thunder, Thunder hired new blood and he&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>

<p>I think for why a team wouldn&rsquo;t hire a euro coach, over a guy who&rsquo;s been in the NBA for a long time is the same. Except instead of the needing the player&rsquo;s respect, they need the front offices. They need to trust their hire to be able to understand the dynamics of the NBA.</p>

<p>The existence of David Blatt, makes a lot of front offices weary too. I feel like all euro coach hire talk has died since that all went down.</p>

      <label for="lm8mup9" class="commentText"><p>Yeah as I said in another comment, David Blatt had lebron, so idk if it’s the same thing, lebron just was like I’m done with this guy like he has been with a bunch of American coaches. So I think I disagree with that.</p>

<p>But my whole point is, if you’re Detroit, you’ll never be as rich or desired as the lakers or golden state or whoever, so why do you need to conform to “the dynamics of the nba”? Be weird and try new stuff, like the bad boys did! I just think if you had a completely European offence you would be different and give yourself a better chance than trying to just be poor man’s lakers or whatever?</p>

<p>Like his response to being celebrated by his players for getting his first NBA win, was to be like &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve won pro games before&rdquo; like wtf lol.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why do you need to conform to the dynamics of the nba</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because they are an NBA team. The dynamics I&rsquo;m talking about are things like 82 game schedule, wealthy players, black American culture, 7 game playoff series, hyper athleticism etc etc. You can&rsquo;t ignore reality.</p>

<p>Yeah I don’t think the race of players would impact the kinda offence id run, and I’d check how NFL coaches speak to their players before suggesting a race or people couldn’t handle a style of coaching. Idk man that’s a weird one for me, I might just leave it there.</p>

      <label for="lm8p6c3" class="commentText"><p>Nothing? It&rsquo;s a great example of his general non-care for the NBA game, got him fired. He could not lead an NBA locker room, as he did not respect the NBA game.</p>

<p>Who cares about the NFL. In the NBA, often 90% to sometimes 100% of the locker room is black american men. The unique culture of Black America is something you do need to have a grasp on and most basketball coaches at a high level do. It&rsquo;s just one the many NBA dynamics a head coach has to grasp, ignorant to say otherwise.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think you really understand what a coach is or what they do. At the NBA level, they are motivators, they&rsquo;re leaders.</p>

<p>A lot of the stuff you&rsquo;re talking about is something assistants do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>before suggesting a race or people couldn’t handle a style of coaching</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your reading comprehension has been pretty bad all over this thread. But this has to be the worst. Black American Culture is apart of the dynamic of the NBA, it&rsquo;s confronting and culture shocking to anyone who has never experienced that. I never said white europeans couldn&rsquo;t handle coaching at the NBA level because they are white. Please read what you respond to.</p>

<p>It showed he was not mature enough for the NBA and that he thought he was above it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not the fact that he didn&rsquo;t celebrate it. It&rsquo;s the fact that he told his players to fuck off and shut up. When you&rsquo;re trying to lead a group of people, having them celebrate you, only for you to turn them down and be like Nah I&rsquo;ve already done this. Just make you seem like a douche.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reason no one has ever given him another shot in the NBA.</p>

      <label for="lm8p15p" class="commentText"><p>The issue isn&rsquo;t that coaches can&rsquo;t find more clever ways to play. If it was as simple as that, you could hire any one of hundreds of college coaches or Euro or even South American coaches.</p>

<p>The issue is that NBA players, especially young ones, are unbelievably difficult to motivate and control. They make too much money, they&rsquo;re too empowered, and they&rsquo;re often deeply suspicious of authority and leadership. Almost everyone they talk to has a hidden motive and wants to enrich themselves in some way through them.</p>

<p>For these reasons among others, the only kind of coaches most NBA players are willing to accept the authority of, are ex NBA players. Or, failing that, at least coaches who come with a proven track record of success, including multiple deep playoff runs or championships.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why players will listen to a Tyron Lue or a Poppovic much more so than they&rsquo;ll listen to some college coach who has never played in the pros, or some random guy from Spain who is used to coaching guys who could never cut it in the NBA. They won&rsquo;t listen to those guys, they won&rsquo;t respect them.</p>

<p>Surely it is a little obvious that there’s some really good offensive minds out there that can turn average NBA guys into really good FIBA players.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely. Which is not what an NBA team wants. You want good NBA players, not good FIBA players.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s much easier for a player to adjust to a new system because they have a coach guiding them. A coach adjusting to a new system is very difficult because they can&rsquo;t exactly ask the players to teach them. Especially on an already poor team.</p>

Spanish pick and rolls, zoom action, there’s a whole video out there about how basically every action you see now Zeljko did 20 years ago in Europe. So I don’t think that works.</p>

<p>I’m not sure I get what you mean by a coach adjusting to a new system? They are playing the same sport, just a different style. Think Mike D’Antoni (who started in Europe) with phoenix.</p>

      <label for="lm8rq4k" class="commentText"><p>It can work if the euro coach is the one building and selecting roster, conduct interviews with players who would accept different team oriented style of play, plus NBA tram owners fully buy in for a change, and fully support said coach.</p>

<p>That way you would not end up players fighting fighting with the coaches.</p>

<p>Nba is mostly run on nepotism and it is really closed circle that&rsquo;s hard to get in.</p>

      <label for="lm8qq3h" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve thought of it too in the past and I think that the reason is that Euro coaches have their own system of connections through which they find, pick, develop and give opportunities to players. A Euro coach getting in the NBA would probably mean a lot of NBA money being diverted to his Euro connections. Even more if he got successful.</p>

      <label for="lm8o0ro" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re onto something&hellip;NBA is a flawed program in a flawed system. Euro coaches will need to sacrifice a whole lot and expose a whole lot in the NBA. Att the end of the day even the suckiest team the owner still makes a lot of Money. You will need an anti establishment owner, as a start. For correction David Blatt was an American born highschool, college, NBA player who then went to Europe so he was still heavily rooted on American coaching</p>

      <label for="lm8pdi0" class="commentText"><p>No detroit needs to draft good players.</p>

<p>Bucks for example sifted between good and shit for about 50 years, before finally drafting an all time great. That&rsquo;s what you need to win in the NBA, great players.</p>

<p>Coach doing random shit with a team doesn&rsquo;t lead to winning. Look at MDA with the 2014 Lakers.</p>
