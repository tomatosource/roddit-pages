</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Yuki Kawamura has been setting the web on fire during preseason. He&rsquo;s very exciting at 5&rsquo;8. Tons of flair, has all the passes and eyes behind his head, excellent timing when looking to drive and as a passer, very instinctual in the PnR, just a very mature PnR handler in general. Definitely quick and very tight handle. He passes teammates open which is a higher level of skill than just being a good passer. His ability to get into the paint really opens the floor for his playmaking talent.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s not a liability as a finisher either&hellip;he understands angles and how to shield the ball from rim protectors and gets the ball up at the rim quickly to prevent them from being able to reject the shot, but that probably isn&rsquo;t gonna be a major part of his game at the NBA level. He&rsquo;s gonna make his money as a scorer with his jumper.</p>

<p>There of course will be questions defensively. I think he&rsquo;s been OK defensively in preseason. He&rsquo;s small but strong for his size. His defense wasn&rsquo;t very good at the Olympics but he had a huge load on his shoulders. He moves well  although not elite laterally but whether that&rsquo;s enough at his size obviously is in question.</p>

<p>His shooting for me is the swing skill. He does have nice really nice mechanics as a shooter. His shooting numbers have been pretty average overall, but some of that is probably shot selection. That&rsquo;s been a weakness of his, but in a different role in the NBA, could be a different story. He needs it to be to make it. But the stroke is nice and he can hit the pull up 3 which is an important skill for a PG today. Also comfortable with the pull up from 2.</p>

<p>What do you all think? Is Yuki Kawamura a future NBA guard? His future could very well be right now if he gets a contract from the Grizzlies.</p>

      <label for="ls47vwj" class="commentText"><p>probably not a long one, not to rain on the parade but the Grizzlies had a similar guy who’s better on defense (arguably worse scorer) named Jacob Gilyard last year. and even with a injury riddled season he couldn’t last the whole year. He has to be a super good shooter as you said.</p>

Like Giannis was pretty ass in Greek 2nd tier league before comming to the NBA, he was nowhere near the 1st tier league, but the dude was insane physically. Bronny would NOT do the same there lmao.</p>

Not even talking about his shot or offense, he just looks so insanely lost out there, like no idea where to be, how to rotate, no bball instincts, etc.  He&rsquo;s an average man defender which ppl have tried to spin into him being some stopper but that&rsquo;s really it.  Off ball defense is trash, defensive instincts are trash, etc.  It&rsquo;s annoying I&rsquo;ve already seen him play as much as I have</p>

      <label for="ls4b41w" class="commentText"><p>No. He’s a feel good story but his finishing around the rim is bad and teams actually trying in the regular season will turn his defense into a liability. Would be a similar case with Keisei Tominaga, though to a lesser extent</p>

      <label for="ls49j3e" class="commentText"><p>We&rsquo;ll see when he plays in the regular season. He is passing the eye test from what I&rsquo;ve seen (which to be fair is just the highlights, I&rsquo;m not watching Grizzlies preseason games), and it&rsquo;s not out of the question for guys 6&rsquo; or below to have a place in the league. Jordan McLaughlin has been like that for the Wolves, defense and shooting I think are the main deciding factors for these types of players. And defense doesn&rsquo;t need to be so much of an individual thing as long as he&rsquo;s just not a straight up massive liability.</p>

<p>This is way too many words to basically just say &ldquo;maybe&rdquo;. From what I&rsquo;ve seen it looks possible for him.</p>

      <label for="ls4h42m" class="commentText"><p>This is the only good answer here.</p>

<p>People act as if dude is Muggsy height, he is literally 0.2 feet / 5 cm shoter than JJ Barea, who played 15 years in NBA, and pretty much the same size as Isaiah Thomas who had an almost-MVP Season once.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all about skill, and skill development, height is an issue but not the crucial one.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a story many people dont know about Boban</p>

<p>Boban has a superb feeling for basket. In those few games where he was allowed to play 20+ mins he proved that his godly PER numbers are not just a fluke, he could legit score the basket. Unfortunately no coach wanted to risk playing Boban that much, but when they did, he pretty much <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zw_WYKWiNUc" target="_blank">torched Jokic and Nuggets both on Offense and Defense</a></p>

<p>But many people dont know that in his youth, Boban couldnt hit an entire court if he threw it from the stands. Worst ball control ever. Like, he literally would miss an entire Elephant that would stand instead of a basket, from a free throw. On top of that, he barely knew how to walk on the court.</p>

<p>But one guy had the nerves to take such a no-talent, and make him into a player that can shoot 80% trees in practice. Ex GSW Assistant coach Dejan Milojevic, who was European Barkley in his playing time (played PF at 6.6 feet), dedicated his 2-3 years to teach Boban to go from worst shooter ever, and clumsy giant on the court, into an European MVP. He thought him everything - how to move, how to play post, how to defend, how to shoot, how to run &hellip;</p>

<p>I gave an example, as both are extremes (being short or being super tall) and it&rsquo;s pretty much 90% about the skill. Even being Short has its advantages on the court, that skilled player could learn to utilize.</p>

      <label for="ls48fq2" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I mean no way unfortunately. I&rsquo;m glad he had a great most recent game but even during the preseason he&rsquo;s had some extremely rough moments where it&rsquo;s been clear that the physicality and size of the league is just a serious issue that&rsquo;s going to likely keep him from ever being more than a deep deep garbage player at best, but more likely a career G League or international player</p>

<p>The modern NBA is just way too ruthless and efficient at hunting size mismatches. One position players are pretty rare. You have guys that would have been two guards 10 years ago who will spend time at point guard and even at the three. If you&rsquo;re going to be a guard who&rsquo;s small and can only play one position on offense or defense you really have to be just unbelievable offensively and I don&rsquo;t see any reason to believe he&rsquo;ll ever be that</p>

<p>The fact that he&rsquo;s even getting a shot at a time where size in the back court is so crucial and prioritized by the league, at 5&rsquo;8, is already incredibly impressive</p>

Back then, the guards didn&rsquo;t shoot so a low center of gravity with some strength would keep you around. Now, everyone is steph curry and then you face steph curry. Plus a lot of guards are bigger now, or they&rsquo;re wings playing as a guard.</p>

<p>He does best with lots of weapons around him so that might not be as effective coming off the bench.</p>

<p>With 13 guys playing per night and 14 open spots (non 2 way activated), the third string point guard spot could be important.</p>

<p>Yuki can replicate some of what Ja does.  Less athleticism of course. Ja misses lots of games and Pippen Jr is a mediocre play maker and 3 point shooter.  Should be a spot on this team for Yuki.</p>

<p>Most everybody who played last night looked good though.</p>

<p>Look a lot of guy can technically play some spot minutes in the NBA and be okay.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m order to &ldquo;stick&rdquo; you gotta be good enough to be an 8th or 9th man in a good team because those remaining spots go to project prospects and &ldquo;lockeroom vets&rdquo; that dont  play anymore.</p>

<p>Yuki is as good as some of those guys on the end of the bench but they are all likely on their way out of the league.</p>

He famously outplayed John Wall in the same game and it took years and a ridiculous amount of luck before Linsanity happened. Unfortunately I don’t think Yuki will be that fortunate. Race will be a big factor. He’ll likely toil away in the G league before going back to Japan and balling out.</p>

<p><em>Edit</em></p>

<p>I didn’t think that I would need to state the obvious, but of course his size will be the number one factor that decides whether or not he can play in the league. </p>

      <label for="ls5vl63" class="commentText"><p>He is shooting 22% during the preseason. He has some flashy passes but most the players at his height were microwave scorers with both volume and decent efficiency not just passers. He is going to compromise your defense vs any team with a big guard or forward who can dribble which at this point is every team. </p>

<p>They still can’t figure out where to put the Vegas NBA arena though.</p>

<p>The league would be really fun if Vegas had a good/competitive team.</p>

<p>Hopefully they put the NBA stadium in the north part of the strip — the proposed site behind Fontainebleau and in front of Sahara (close to the convention center) would be ideal.</p>

<p>With the new CBA/2nd apron, the overall talent level and the addition of those play-in games… I actually think that an expansion team can get the 10th seed in the inaugural season.</p>

He’s not as bad defensively as you’d think for smaller guard. His shooting I think will take some adjusting, some of his shots airball and I think the nba range is just throwing him off a bit but his mechanics are sound. It’ll eventually start falling</p>

<p>Yuki&rsquo;s just 22? I think he will stick around but probably in the G-League for a couple of seasons before resurfacing on a rebuilding team (like Philly was with TJ). He&rsquo;ll carve out a niche for himself. He does need more bulk though, he looked like he could defend against our reserves, an actual NBA point guard would run him over.</p>

      <label for="ls65lbu" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s looking good for now but I&rsquo;m still a doubter because his finishing/shooting has been very underwhelming. Let&rsquo;s not forget he&rsquo;s been shooting roughly 40% from the field and 30% from 3 these past few years in the JBL.</p>

<p>This being said his court vision is excellent and I think he can be a better contributor than Yuta Tabuse was for the Suns (low bar I know). Not sure he can have a long NBA career like JJ Barea though.</p>

<p>IMHO a lot will depend on (i) how much he can improve his outside shooting and (ii) offensive/defensive sets used and the players he shares the court with. I believe that he could be quite effective with Edey both on offense (great target for lobs and post entry passes, possible great screening big for pick and roll) and defense (by mitigating Yuki&rsquo;s height disadvantage and clogging the paint).</p>

<p>So yeah, maybe ?</p>

Remember Yuta Tabuse… he is comparable</p>

      <label for="ls6emfu" class="commentText"><p>i doubt it,</p>

<p>he has no one area where he&rsquo;ll thrive(3 pt shot, drive and finish/dish, speed/handle),</p>

<p>i hope he does well, but i think other teams will feast if he sees the court.</p>

      <label for="ls4bru6" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve watched the games, he doesn&rsquo;t really even attempt around the rim which is why I said it wouldn&rsquo;t be a major part of his NBA game, but he wasn&rsquo;t a bad finisher domestically. He&rsquo;ll always have his limitations here but he wasn&rsquo;t bad. But that&rsquo;s obviously not going to be part of his game at this level and I do think there are real questions about whether he can score enough, to leverage his passing.</p>

      <label for="ls4c4xp" class="commentText"><p>rereading your comment your right, you never mentioned his finishing as a positive portion of his game. my apologies. and yes i agree, his lack of finishing ability will most likely destroy any chance he has of becoming a legit threat, as any time he drives he almost always is looking to pass, and against any team with decent length hes always gonna get stuffed at the rim.</p>

      <label for="ls54vh6" class="commentText"><p>if he was taller he&rsquo;d be a mediocre nba player but his height along with his weakness makes it hard for teams to draft him. also japanese players maxed out on their height. its going to be incredibly diffucult to find someone tall and athletically gifted like Shohei ohtani. Great heart though.</p>
