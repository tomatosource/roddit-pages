</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Last week <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1erb13z/alltime_single_position_teams/" target="_blank">I made a post</a> asking &ldquo;How do you make an all-time starting 5 out of shooting guards?&rdquo;, and here are my results based on the comments (team posted about halfway down). This team is not definitive; it is just the one I constructed</p>

<p>#The rules:</p>

<p>All 5 players historically played the same position (based on the strict majority of seasons listed on basketball reference, so no Lebron or KD), and you have to attempt to make a complete team. This isn&rsquo;t just a top 5 SG post; there&rsquo;s gotta be a SG hypothetically played at center here. I didn&rsquo;t explicitly say it in the original post, but all 5 teams would play each other.</p>

<p>#Shooting guards all around:</p>

<p>Much like the point guard team, a team of exclusively shooting guards needs to prioritize size. Luckily shooting guards tend to have more height and strength than point guards, so you have a tiny bit more flexibility. Still, size and defense come at a premium when the other hypothetical teams are SFs, PFs, and Cs. Even considering size and defense, you don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to play any strict defensive specialists, and you will still end up with an insane amount of offensive talent. The hardest thing about this team is that you can build a deep, stacked team no issue, and then you run into the question of who ends up on the bench? Having to start MJ over Wade is ultimately a good problem to be faced with&hellip;</p>

<p>#My team:</p>

<p>PG - Michael Jordan</p>

<p>SG - Reggie Miller</p>

<p>SF - Kobe Bryant</p>

<p>PF - Clyde Drexler</p>

<p>C - Tracy McGrady</p>

<p>bench: Dwyane Wade, Sidney Moncrief, Ray Allen, Michael Cooper, George Gervin</p>

<p>Weirdly, there are fewer outliers for height at SG compared to PG. It makes sense since you would just get moved up a position to SF if you were especially big, but still we cap out with 6&rsquo;8&rdquo; TMac at center. What a stacked team. Michael Jordan bringing up the ball with Reggie Miller moving off ball for the open 3. Kobe at SF, and then the &ldquo;twin towers&rdquo; of Drexler and TMac. Both decent rebounders for SGs (with Drexler being amzing on the offensive boards), hopefully they can control the interior well enough for kickouts and quick points. Off the bench, a great offensive punch from Wade, Allen, and Gervin. Overall, a stout defensive lineup. Wade was a great guard defender, Moncrief was a two-time DPOY at SG, and Michael Cooper was a big SG and DPOY. Gervin and Allen weren&rsquo;t known for their defense, but Gervin&rsquo;s scoring and Allen&rsquo;s shooting would both be very important for this bench.</p>

<p>#Notable omissions:</p>

<p>There are definitely a few omissions. Joe Dumars was a 2x champ, two way guard, and very good scorer. I just wasn&rsquo;t sure who to boot for him. Hal Greer, Sam Jones, Earl Monroe, Bill Sharman, and Pistol Pete are just so hard to rate since they played so long ago, and I am unfamiliar with them. James Harden had an all-time offensive peak. Plus, he&rsquo;s split his career between PG and SG with his amazing passing, but ultimately his ball dominant peak and lack of defensive effort kept him off the team. Alvin Robertson is one that I wasn&rsquo;t sure about. I don&rsquo;t know enough about him to feel confident putting him on the team, but notching a quadruple double as a guard is pretty special. I considered a 3+D role player like Danny Green, Klay, or KCP, but I didn&rsquo;t find the spot for them. Other guys like Michael Redd or Vince Carter also came up, but for an all-time team, you&rsquo;re looking at the cream of the crop and those guys don&rsquo;t quite make the cut. Manu could be a controversial omission, and Mitch Richmond was an amazing shooter that I didn&rsquo;t find a spot for.</p>

<p>What are your teams?</p>

      <label for="livnffg" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s definitely a fine strategy, but I wanted to think a little bit about fit and play style. TMac is probably misused as a center, where I pretty much put him for height. MJ is at the point because he logged a lot of assists and was used as the offensive initiator in different seasons. Drexler had a decent post game, was big, and rebounded well so I put him at PF. In this hypothetical, this team will be playing a team constructed of all PFs, so you probably want to think about bigger guys or defense (or maybe you want to &ldquo;run and gun&rdquo; and prioritize smaller faster guys).</p>

<p>It makes sense to stack the roster and let the talent shake out where it can, but we&rsquo;ve seen the teams America sends to international competitions take a while to get that straight.</p>
