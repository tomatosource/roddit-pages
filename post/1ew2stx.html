</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Last week <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1erb13z/alltime_single_position_teams/" target="_blank">I made a post</a> asking &ldquo;How do you make an all-time starting 5 out of shooting guards?&rdquo;, and here are my results based on the comments (team posted about halfway down). This team is not definitive; it is just the one I constructed</p>

<p>#The rules:</p>

<p>All 5 players historically played the same position (based on the strict majority of seasons listed on basketball reference, so no Lebron or KD), and you have to attempt to make a complete team. This isn&rsquo;t just a top 5 SG post; there&rsquo;s gotta be a SG hypothetically played at center here. I didn&rsquo;t explicitly say it in the original post, but all 5 teams would play each other.</p>

<p>#Shooting guards all around:</p>

<p>Much like the point guard team, a team of exclusively shooting guards needs to prioritize size. Luckily shooting guards tend to have more height and strength than point guards, so you have a tiny bit more flexibility. Still, size and defense come at a premium when the other hypothetical teams are SFs, PFs, and Cs. Even considering size and defense, you don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to play any strict defensive specialists, and you will still end up with an insane amount of offensive talent. The hardest thing about this team is that you can build a deep, stacked team no issue, and then you run into the question of who ends up on the bench? Having to start MJ over Wade is ultimately a good problem to be faced with&hellip;</p>

<p>#My team:</p>

<p>PG - Michael Jordan</p>

<p>SG - Reggie Miller</p>

<p>SF - Kobe Bryant</p>

<p>PF - Clyde Drexler</p>

<p>C - Tracy McGrady</p>

<p>bench: Dwyane Wade, Sidney Moncrief, Ray Allen, Michael Cooper, George Gervin</p>

<p>Weirdly, there are fewer outliers for height at SG compared to PG. It makes sense since you would just get moved up a position to SF if you were especially big, but still we cap out with 6&rsquo;8&rdquo; TMac at center. What a stacked team. Michael Jordan bringing up the ball with Reggie Miller moving off ball for the open 3. Kobe at SF, and then the &ldquo;twin towers&rdquo; of Drexler and TMac. Both decent rebounders for SGs (with Drexler being amzing on the offensive boards), hopefully they can control the interior well enough for kickouts and quick points. Off the bench, a great offensive punch from Wade, Allen, and Gervin. Overall, a stout defensive lineup. Wade was a great guard defender, Moncrief was a two-time DPOY at SG, and Michael Cooper was a big SG and DPOY. Gervin and Allen weren&rsquo;t known for their defense, but Gervin&rsquo;s scoring and Allen&rsquo;s shooting would both be very important for this bench.</p>

<p>#Notable omissions:</p>

<p>There are definitely a few omissions. Joe Dumars was a 2x champ, two way guard, and very good scorer. I just wasn&rsquo;t sure who to boot for him. Hal Greer, Sam Jones, Earl Monroe, Bill Sharman, and Pistol Pete are just so hard to rate since they played so long ago, and I am unfamiliar with them. James Harden had an all-time offensive peak. Plus, he&rsquo;s split his career between PG and SG with his amazing passing, but ultimately his ball dominant peak and lack of defensive effort kept him off the team. Alvin Robertson is one that I wasn&rsquo;t sure about. I don&rsquo;t know enough about him to feel confident putting him on the team, but notching a quadruple double as a guard is pretty special. I considered a 3+D role player like Danny Green, Klay, or KCP, but I didn&rsquo;t find the spot for them. Other guys like Michael Redd or Vince Carter also came up, but for an all-time team, you&rsquo;re looking at the cream of the crop and those guys don&rsquo;t quite make the cut. Manu could be a controversial omission, and Mitch Richmond was an amazing shooter that I didn&rsquo;t find a spot for.</p>

<p>What are your teams?</p>

His advanced stats especially in the first 2 chips were peak and he was more valuable than even Timmy in a lot of ways.  That 07 FMVP was absolute robbery. He won gold with Luis Scola as his #2 with a game winner in the final round.  What has harden done?</p>

Manu was literally the #1 when he was playing vs Team USA ft lebron wade melo and they went all the way wdym?  He was de facto #1 in plenty of games thru the spurs&rsquo; playoff runs.  Download the early 00 duels between him and Kobe and tell me what you see.  Crossing kobe driving into the lane against shaq, finishing with a reverse layup.  It&rsquo;s tough for people who need counting stats to justify skill but just watch him play in his prime; it&rsquo;s not hard to see.</p>

<p>Harden is the best playmaker ever at SG, making him a good choice for PG. Also a great defensive rebounder which the team could definitely use.</p>

<p>Debated Wade/Kobe to start but went with the better shooting in Kobe since MJ/Drexler aren’t great shooters.</p>

<p>Michael Jordan.</p>

<p>Drexler was a great rebounder for his size and got a decent amount of blocks.</p>

<p>TMac had seasons with 8rpg, and had seasons with 1.5bpg. Also 6’8. Seems most fit to be a Small Ball C while pulling opposing Cs away from the hoop.</p>

<p>The starting lineup has 3 great defenders in Kobe, MJ, Drexler. TMac being the closest SG to a “rim protector” you’ll find. And Harden being capable of guarding bigger.</p>

<p>It’s honestly a great rebounding squad for the size. Harden, MJ, Drexler, and TMac all have seasons with 7+ rebounds per game.</p>

<p>PG - Harden, AI</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a team that is inherently small, I wanted to prioritize defense and switchability to as big of an extent as possible (switchability is kind of estimated for the illegal defense era). Harden is ball dominant and for the bulk of his career hasn&rsquo;t moved much off ball. Most of the guys on this team averaged 5+ assists during their career, so my concept was a &ldquo;share the rock&rdquo; system that wouldn&rsquo;t need a true PG. Still, maybe it&rsquo;s one of those things where they are just too talented to not include.</p>

<p>I like your team a lot</p>

      <label for="liwqv6t" class="commentText"><p>Harden&rsquo;s probably one of the best defenders to put on a big man out of all these all time greats. He does decently well against bigger guys. His perimeter defense isn&rsquo;t good, but his post defense is great. Not even being a bench option is crazy because he&rsquo;s probably the best playmaking SG of all time.</p>

<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s a ~top 10 SG, which is insane in itself, you&rsquo;re making a team where SG&rsquo;s have to play and guard all positions and you&rsquo;re leaving out the guy who can actually handle getting backed down by a big posting up, and is in contention for best PG skillset out of all listed SGs ever. That&rsquo;s not even mentioning the fact that the only people that can historically hang with his scoring are MJ and Kobe.</p>

<p>Bruh, it&rsquo;s enough to make me reconsider attempting to discuss actual basketball in here ever again.</p>

      <label for="liwd7t1" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m a Harden truther, but I wanted to prioritize size and defense. I could very easily see putting him in over Ray Allen or Reggie Miller, but both of them played a lot off ball, so they felt more plug and play and could thrive on any team. Harden is probably the best distributor of anyone listed, but nearly everyone on this team is a decent passer. He was the hardest one for me to leave off the team, but there&rsquo;s enough scoring between multiple scoring champions and the ball can be shared with this team where everyone can pass. For a balanced team, I felt like there were better options.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The team I made has 4 DPOY awards and 36 All-Defense teams to Harden&rsquo;s 0. Ray and Reggie are the only 2 guys getting fewer stocks than Harden. I know Harden is strong as hell and has shown that he can defend a post player for a few possessions, but it&rsquo;s not like he has ever been a defensive savant. If you&rsquo;re imagining a theoretical post defender on this team, I&rsquo;d rather have Cooper than Harden.</p>

      <label for="livnffg" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s definitely a fine strategy, but I wanted to think a little bit about fit and play style. TMac is probably misused as a center, where I pretty much put him for height. MJ is at the point because he logged a lot of assists and was used as the offensive initiator in different seasons. Drexler had a decent post game, was big, and rebounded well so I put him at PF. In this hypothetical, this team will be playing a team constructed of all PFs, so you probably want to think about bigger guys or defense (or maybe you want to &ldquo;run and gun&rdquo; and prioritize smaller faster guys).</p>

<p>It makes sense to stack the roster and let the talent shake out where it can, but we&rsquo;ve seen the teams America sends to international competitions take a while to get that straight.</p>

      <label for="liwdc76" class="commentText"><p>If you need bigger guys you should look at the early 00s, where SGs were getting huge.</p>

<p>Joe Johnson (6-8, 240) could play PF in this era.</p>

<p>Paul Pierce (6-7, 235) also spent much a good chunk of his career at SG, during the Antoine Walker years.</p>

<p>Even Kobe bulked up for a bit, when he was known as &ldquo;Buff Kobe&rdquo; or &ldquo;Buffbe.&rdquo; Reportedly he got up to 230.</p>

<p>Jason Richardson was another power SG from that era.</p>

<p>This build largely went away after hand-checking was banned, and perimeter players no longer needed the strength to fight through hand-checks. The rule change gave a boost to quickness builds, which is why you saw overnight increases in efficiency from guys like Nash, Iverson, and Tony Parker.</p>

<p>Pistol Pete had one of the greatest peaks for shooting/passing/ball handling - he was a revolutionary player for his era and would have dominated the modern game. His career unfortunately didn&rsquo;t have the longevity to put him in the conversation of all-time greats. But I think he would be a perfect complementary player on this squad.</p>

<p>Wade has the most blocks of any guard all-time. IMO he belongs in the frontcourt, even if he&rsquo;s undersized.</p>

      <label for="livv81u" class="commentText"><p>PG - Jerry West</p>

<p>SG - MJ</p>

<p>SF - Kobe</p>

<p>PF - Klay Thompson</p>

<p>C - Clyde Drexler</p>

<p>Bench: DWade, Ray Allen, AI, Reggie Miller, Sidney Moncrief</p>

<p>MJ had only a slightly winning record as a PG, so I think the Logo should be the guy running point for this team. This also allows the best player at his respective position to assume his natural role. Meanwhile, Klay and Drexler make for an undersized but decent defensive core, with Klay being able to stretch the floor a little as the 4. Kobe feels a little redundant alongside MJ, but it&rsquo;s not like that&rsquo;s a bad thing, especially given that he&rsquo;s a better 3P shooter. The bench allows for some flexibility, with some shooters to constantly rotate in and out of the game, or, even, to all surround MJ and allow him to balance scoring and passing to open shooters.</p>
