<p>They’re settling for mediocrity after that last title. Instead of lean years post-Curry, management seems fine with being mediocre with Curry and then have a down period afterwards. This is likely the high point for the Warriors as a franchise. Why would you not want to extend that window?</p>

<p>In hindsight, the two timelines was a joke. They let one timeline whither and die on the vine while praying the new growth could carry them. But the new growth never took root.</p>

<p>Right, at the time, I wanted them to draft Edwards or trade back for Haliburton or Vassell. I wouldn&rsquo;t take Haliburton at 2, but I would have taken LaMelo.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A lot of this take is just hindsight being <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My takes on this were the same I had before the draft. When you look at contracts, the worst value is from rookie extensions and guys past their primes. This was what the Warriors were going to be stuck with. Even the Warriors have a budget and that budget was going to be tested the moment those rookies were up for extension. It was clear that the two-timelines narrative was bullshit because the timelines could only co-exist while those players were on rookie contracts. So the obvious move was to get the most out of those rookie contracts by drafting high floor guys that fit the team and just out-talent everyone for 5 years and accept that you will have to let go of some of them afterwards.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>LaMelo maybe, but James Wiseman was the consensus number 2 pick at the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hated Wiseman as a prospect. He couldn&rsquo;t do anything the Warriors valued. It was going to take him 4+ years to figure shit out. I also didn&rsquo;t think the Warriors needed a center and that Dray and Looney were good enough. I was definitely in the minority with that opinion, but I was proven right when they won.</p>

<p>Like, I wanted a 3rd string backup center that could put Dray at the 4 in the regular season and Chriss was good enough for that. Spending a #2 pick on that when that role could be filled with a vet min was a terrible use of resources.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t like LaMelo for the Warriors, but I did like it a lot more than Wiseman, so that would have been my choice if I was managing the team.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, Kuminga was the higher rated prospect over Franz Wagner in the 2021 draft. This wasn&rsquo;t a bad pick at the time either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The pick is fine, but Franz was everything the Warriors value in a player. Their spacing was suspect, so I wanted to avoid all the guys that couldn&rsquo;t shoot (Barnes, Giddey, Kuminga). There weren&rsquo;t any knockdown wing shooters, but Franz could at least kinda shoot. Once again, the view was that this pick wasn&rsquo;t going to stay on the team cuz they couldn&rsquo;t afford to pay them. 4 years of Franz was going to be far more valuable for the team than 4 years of Kuminga.</p>

<p>I actually have saved comments backing up a lot of these things I&rsquo;ve said, but I have to sift through a bunch of degenerate copypastas to find them lol.</p>

      <label for="lt7qcki" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think the Warriors have any realistic scenario to contend after their last championship, given the age of their stars and the salaries committed to them, and the assets they had/have. The Lakers find themselves in a similar situation. You can&rsquo;t deplete your assets during your championship years, then committed max salaries to one or two guys, and then hope you can build a competitive team around them outside of strong drafts, development, and a few key role players.</p>

<p>Denver is experiencing this now as we speak, and Boston will be next up in a year or two.</p>

      <label for="lt7xzkd" class="commentText"><p>He would if he was paired with LaMelo or Haliburton. The Franz pick was about maximizing the value you get from the rookie contract. If they had to sign a LaMelo/Haliburton to a max, they couldn&rsquo;t afford Franz anyway. He&rsquo;d be a 4 year rental. Even without the new CBA, you could understand this if you looked at how the luxury tax works and the budget numbers the Warriors would give out. Both Poole and Franz were not going to stick on the team if they had drafted optimally.</p>

<p>The reason Lamb got playing time over Kuminga and Moody was that he was bigger than Moody and a better shooter than Kuminga. He was a better fit for what the Warriors needed at that time. Yes, it was a short sighted move, but it strategically made sense if you were trying to win in that moment.</p>

Curry and Green are fairly pragmatic, and because of their relationship with the front office I doubt there has been a lack of transparency.</p>

<p>There really hasn’t been a viable move for a second star level offensive creator for multiple reasons. The new CBA is also a huge consideration.</p>

If you&rsquo;re not gonna win, the next-best thing you can do is make sure your rivals also don&rsquo;t win. And the last thing you want is to actually help them. Clippers-Warriors may not be as heated as it was 10 years ago, or as heated as Clippers-Lakers, but it still exists.</p>

<p>Adding Harden increased it, it&rsquo;s not like he and the Warriors have historically been BFFs. Just last season Curry said &ldquo;I hate losing to them (the Clippers) and I&rsquo;m sure they feel the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like Moses Moody was going to make the Clippers contenders, either. He isn&rsquo;t anywhere near good enough to warrant the Clippers having to watch Steph and Dray hoist yet another trophy.</p>

      <label for="lt8brhn" class="commentText"><p>This logic basically always worked before the new CBA.</p>

<p>Now, it doesn&rsquo;t always work. I think the Clippers would be in an objectively far worse position if they traded PG to the Warriors and got basically dogshit salary in return + maybe a pick or something and were over the second apron vs where they are now.</p>

      <label for="lt6ml57" class="commentText"><p>Honestly, I don&rsquo;t see how the math would work on this. Clippers were supposed to agree to trade PG to Warriors thus taking on $50+ mil in salaries and paying 100+ mil in luxury taxes, all while taking virtually no assets in return. It&rsquo;s a fantasy,</p>

<p>Just making the contracts work is a nightmare, but Wiggins (who would presumably would be in the deal) is under contract for 2 more years, taking on that alone would require Warriors to chip in a first.</p>

<p>Considering in recent years you could see teams that could&rsquo;ve contended for the playoffs but instead decided to tank, I&rsquo;d say we&rsquo;re halfway there already. As a football (soccer, for yanks) fan, I think it&rsquo;s ridiculous. Too many teams are just trying to lose on purpose. There should be some sort of penalty for being bad, not a reward. Especially when you look at the Suns some years ago, the Hornets, the Magic&hellip; teams that were shit year in, year out, and didn&rsquo;t care.</p>

<p>I prefer leagues where it is absolutely certain that either one of two teams will win the championship before the season even starts.  I think it is ridiculous that 90% of the teams in most European soccer leagues (France, England, Germany, Spain) have absolutely no chance and do not even really try to win the championship</p>

      <label for="lt78wl6" class="commentText"><p>As said, it is mostly because soccer isn&rsquo;t just a one league, end-all-be-all affair. Winning the domestic cups (in places where those cups have a deep history, not the Mickey Vegas Cup that Silver created), winning continental cups (or even participating in those), hell, sometimes not being relegated is already a prize within itself (although this one is more common in the chaos that is Latin American soccer, where even the biggest teams can spend a year or two in the second tier due to money or just bad luck). Americans will never feel the pleasure that is the relief of avoiding relegation in the last round, one of my fondest memories isn&rsquo;t when my team won the tournaments that I saw at the stadium (two national leagues and two national cups), but when we avoided relegation in the last round by beating our main rivals 6-1.</p>

<p>Soccer is a different culture, it&rsquo;s different emotions and probably why it will always fail to catch up with the NFL/NBA/MLB. US sports are a whole different endeavor, different expectations.</p>

      <label for="lt7hgzd" class="commentText"><p>I don’t care how many finals they made if they didn’t win one. Dortmund also made the finals last year but was clearly inferior to Real Madrid. They are also not up there competing with Real and Barcelona. The point differential will become clearer as the season progresses. It’s just the illusion of competitiveness. You guys won 2 titles in like 50 years. As I said in my comment above, you could get lucky and win a national title in a year like Leicester 2015 but Atlético Madrid will NOT win a Champions League in the foreseeable future which was my point.</p>

<p>Also, if you act like the only thing that matters is the Champions League, you&rsquo;re a bit deluded. If your own team won the Europa League 2 years ago and you dismiss it like it&rsquo;s nothing, that&rsquo;s your own problem.</p>

      <label for="lt6z9h4" class="commentText"><p>Right but it’s not really a big swing.  You have to completely ignore Danny Ainge’s entire history as a GM to think the measly leftover assets we had would be half of what he’d demand for Markannen.  They’re acting like getting Markannen was plan A, but it wasn’t, Ainge wouldn’t take our deal in a million years.  There isn’t a single front office in the league, no matter how inept, would think we had the assets to get both Paul George and Lauri Markannen without giving up Steph or Dray.  Add to that that when we were actually having talks with Ainge we wouldn’t include Kuminga or Podz in any deal.  It’s laughable.  This deal was never happening and our owner was trying to get under the tax apron anyway.</p>

<p>Warriors fans largely wanted the organization to do more to put out a real team while Steph is on the roster.  Lacob has opted to cheap out on contracts and draft for the future rather than maximize our contending window.  Anyone with a brain can see we’re not winning a championship this year, and that we didn’t really try to put a championship team together.  This is Lacob and by extension Dunleavy saying “but hey, we tried!”</p>

<p>Aka Danny was too busy being a competent GM to play along with GSW&rsquo;s fantasies. They didn&rsquo;t have the assets for both.</p>

<p>They would have had to dump a lot of money on LAC to make the Paul George trade work and that would have required picks being sent out.</p>

<p>They were reportedly planning to dump Chris Paul and Andrew Wiggins on the Clippers.</p>

<p>Balmer has shown he&rsquo;s willing to risk money for a chance of contention, but he hasn&rsquo;t shown a willingness to be a dumping ground. Plus, with the new CBA, staying over the 2nd apron means your future 1st round picks get downgraded into late 1sts. So it&rsquo;s not just the money, it would cost LAC draft capital to take those contracts.</p>

<p>So you have to compensate LAC in that scenario. Which means GSW wouldn&rsquo;t have enough left over for dealing with Utah.</p>

<p>Ainge has a reputation for being greedy in trades but most of his trades are graded as fair or slightly favouring the other side when they&rsquo;re first made. They only look good in hindsight.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that - nobody said Cleveland or Minny were favored in getting Rudy/Mitchell at their price tags. The Kyrie price was in a different era somewhat but still laughably low considering the health of IT.</p>

<p>The cornerstone Nets deal had a tepid response in the moments after it was made, but it took basically only a moment to realize that trading four <em>unprotected</em> firsts for a couple of 36 year olds was an insane gambit. Most of the in the moment controversy came because it signaled the end of that era of contention, despite being on its last gasp. If you stepped back from the emotion, plenty of people saw it as a win for the Celts pretty quickly (<a href="https://grantland.com/the-triangle/what-the-pierce-garnett-trade-means-for-the-nets-and-celtics/" target="_blank">https://grantland.com/the-triangle/what-the-pierce-garnett-trade-means-for-the-nets-and-celtics/</a>)</p>

<p>The Cleveland trade for Donny was seen as relatively fair at the time iirc.  Premium price, sure, but they were getting a 25 yo all-star with years left on his deal, and no one knew Lauri would break out like he did.  Heck even now w/ hindsight I&rsquo;d guess Cleveland fans still do that deal.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s just been lucky enough that some of these moves have cashed out in huge ways between the Brown/Tatum picks being homeruns, Lauri&rsquo;s star turn, and things not working out on the other side (RIP IT). Just kinda stacks up rep-wise.</p>

<p>honest question, ignoring Ainge&rsquo;s trade predilections for a moment.</p>

<p>Would Wiggins, Paul, an unprotected 1st and a swap for a PG13 be an unreasonable deal?</p>

<p>Because the Warriors could still have made a Kuminga, Moody, Podz, 2 unprotected 1sts, 2 swaps offer for Lauri, which still seems like an overpay to me.</p>

      <label for="lt6weul" class="commentText"><p>Not sure how the cap works with exceptions but I think they wanted to use the play trade exception to get Kyle Anderson and Melton still. So you&rsquo;d have Steph/PG/Lauri/Dray/Trayce Jackson Davis with Melton, Anderson, looney as an 8 man rotation. Looney might&rsquo;ve had to be traded too I think but assuming your starters stay healthy (very big if, all 4 of their top players would be injury prone), its competing with tbe celtics and knicks for best starting 5 in the league.</p>

<p>I honestly prefer where we are without that deal though, curry should still be good for the next two years, at least offensively, and potential further growth from their young guys can open an opportunity for a much more palatable trade. We&rsquo;ll see though.</p>

      <label for="lt7h5fn" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d argue surrounding him with quality role players instead of asking 1 man to fill the role of the 5 you sent out the door to get him. Melton, Anderson and Hield are all solid role players. There wasn&rsquo;t a big move that got them the win in 2022. There biggest additions were Bjelica and Otto Porter Jr AND they didn&rsquo;t have Klay to start the season which they got out in extremely dominant fashion.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve seen how swinging for the fences works for Brooklyn, Phoenix, Clippers, Houston etc. You put all your eggs in one basket and then that basket gets injured and you&rsquo;re shit out of luck.</p>

      <label for="lt805ws" class="commentText"><p>Agreed. If we&rsquo;re looking for the model it&rsquo;s either the Duncan/Parker Spurs or Kobe Lakers, right? In both cases they built up the role players and remained competitive until hitting on the draft (Kawhi) or trading assets when already in contention (Trading for Pau Gasol when the Lakers were already 32-17).</p>

<p>Honestly, the Warriors may have already made their &ldquo;Pau Gasol&rdquo; move when they got Wiggins and won another ring. Kobe won his last ring at age 31,  Duncan at 37 (Kawhi being the &ldquo;best&rdquo; player on that team). Steph is 36 now and Draymond is 34, pivoting to the future is 99% the right move unless you can pull some insane offseason magic like this PG/Lauri move hoped to do.</p>

We already have an old core in Steph and Dray. Wiggins has been out for different reasons a lot in the past two seasons and Looney just isn’t able to pull an iron man anymore. We need youth to get through the season and getting PG would have just meant running Steph to the ground earlier. I think we have good pieces to make it to the playoffs and after that it’s always a bit of luck and trust in Steph.</p>

<p>The best teams in today&rsquo;s NBA always have a good balance of stars you can rely on to get buckets and role players that are awesome at other important aspects of the game like POA defense. It seems like we would have had to trade all our good perimeter defenders and depth, just to put together a team of players that are best when they&rsquo;re getting lots of shots up.</p>

<p>Paul George literally complained a couple months ago about the Harden trade creating this imbalance for the Clippers, saying &ldquo;&ldquo;We traded to get James, and it’s not James’ fault of why we struggled, but the lost part of that was we lost RoCo, we lost Nico… now myself, Kawhi, we become the dirty guys&rdquo; &hellip;. a team of Steph, PG13, and Lauri that doesn&rsquo;t have dudes like Wiggins or Melton or Moody would have exactly the same problem, right?</p>

Either of George or Markkanen on their own would not be worth the many years of bottom feeding without any picks that come after.</p>

<p>So, rather play it out, grow internally, see if another opportunity opens up, than do something desperate and stupid trying to pretend our guys are still 28 years old with half a career ahead of them.</p>

<p>Was it crazy to think this was possible? Maybe. I think everyone was surprised they let PG walk for nothing though, and then after that happened the price we&rsquo;re willing to give for Markkanen went below Ainge&rsquo;s asking price. Oh well.</p>

<p>Warriors are playing this up simply to keep the “have to give Curry a chance at a title” crowd happy.  That is, we tried to go all in for Curry, but god damn, it just didn’t work out.  Shareholders milk the Curry cow for another few years without the pressure. Perfect.</p>
