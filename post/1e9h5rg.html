      <label for="lee8p5d" class="commentText"><p>This is what people mean when they say Wade and Bosh sacrificed in order to win. Each of them could have gone on leading their teams in numbers, status, role, but they willingly handed the keys to LeBron and lost out on those things in favor of competing in 4 straight Finals. It&rsquo;s fine that Melo didn&rsquo;t want to, we don&rsquo;t need to crucify him for it, but we also need to give players who set their egos aside their flowers.</p>

      <label for="lee9blp" class="commentText"><p>Wade didn’t sacrifice initially in fairness. In 2010 and 2011, they ran the ball through him way more than they realistically should have. Lebron was a minimum top 2 player all time, in his prime, yet Wade posted a higher USG% their first year together.</p>

<p>Obviously you can’t just tell Wade to drastically reduce his usage in reality, but they’d have been better team playing Lebron-Ball. And the best version of the Heat was 2012-13 when Lebron was doing everything.</p>

      <label for="leeap9a" class="commentText"><p>While that&rsquo;s true, this is a guy who had won a title there as the primary playmaker with the ball in his hands all the time willingly teaming up with another ball-dominant star who was rated as better than him. He had to have known what he was signing up for: more rebounding, cutting, defense, and less credit for winning. His Heat legacy was secure by 2010, he really didn&rsquo;t have to do it.</p>

      <label for="leeciik" class="commentText"><p>2012-2013 LeBron is a much different beast than 2010-2011 LeBron. And if LeBron(and Bosh) could play that 2nd fiddle role or didn’t got starstrucked by Finals logo, Wade would have carried them to a championship in 2011 so i don’t think this criticism is fair in the slightest.</p>

      <label for="leef1pz" class="commentText"><p>I don’t agree with either of those statements. If i need to go by 5-year periods, i definitely would’ve put 2012-2016 as LeBron’s peak. I’m aware that he was more athletic and just younger in the timeframe you gave but he added so much to his game after 2011.</p>

<p>2011 Wade can do %80 things that 2011 LeBron can do, and do some of it better than him. Can’t say the same for 2013 or 2016 LeBron even if we continue to compare him against 2011 Wade rather than their respective years.</p>

Wade averaged 26ppg on 58% TS and Lebron 27ppg on 59% TS ( both very efficient) and they  won 58 games and made the finals. The issue was once in the finals Wade continued to perform well but Lebron disappeared on offense and didn’t want the ball.</p>

<p>That obviously changed the next year but if Lebron had just played at his regular season level Miami beats the Mavs in 5</p>

<p>In reality Lebron was a far better player than Wade hamstrung by poor Cleveland rosters, but he hadn’t broke through to win a ring yet. There was no way they could fully commit to Lebron ball despite him having much more impact on winning.</p>

      <label for="leeh5rd" class="commentText"><p>Obviously none of us have the mentality to make it as elite NBA players, and part of that mentality for a guy like Melo is absolutely being the alpha dog on his team. But man, for me, I&rsquo;d have so much more fun hooping with other amazing players and winning like 80% of my games and getting a few chips than being &ldquo;the man&rdquo; on a mediocre team going nowhere fast. But I&rsquo;m not an NBA alpha dog so who cares what I think!</p>

<p>is that an admirable thing? To set aside your ego, or better yet, to set aside your ambition, to be someone else&rsquo;s #2? Or is it more admirable to say &ldquo;no, fuck you. I&rsquo;m going to beat you&rdquo;, to try, even if they fail, to actually be the best?</p>

There’s a world where he gets Bosh and a couple good starters into that cap space instead of Lebron and is a serious contender for  that 2011 title anyway.</p>

<p>After that he was always hurt one way or another though and it had to be Lebron’s show.</p>

<p>Him and Wade sort of made it work with off ball cuts and what not, but it was janky. Bron+Bosh lineups often outperformed Bron+Wade+Bosh lineups. Melo would’ve been a nightmare.</p>

<p>He could&rsquo;ve waited and given the Knicks some more money/picks, etc to be able to build a better team around him.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t fault him for wanting to go home, as much as I didn&rsquo;t want him to leave but if his heart ain&rsquo;t here then it&rsquo;ll affect his performance, attitude, and team chemistry so it was time for him to go.</p>

<p>But it also goes to show, him leading the team vs LBJ leading the team is different.</p>

<p>He wasn&rsquo;t willing to do it all and his role on the team was mainly scorer, instead of the jack of all trades role, unless you have a great team with people fitting each role well, you aren&rsquo;t going to win.</p>

<p>Maybe regular season but everyone knows how different regular season is compared to the playoffs.</p>

<p>Offensively, one of the greatest scorers, with probably one of the nicest jumpers in the draft class and beyond, quick first step and jab step, etc. but that will only take you so far.</p>

<p>As much as I can understand why he and others may have not liked George Karl, the thing about Melo not wanting to sacrifice, play defense, be a leader, etc does look to be true.</p>

      <label for="leebbwl" class="commentText"><p>Are you tripping? He didn’t force the Knicks to trade half the roster. The Knicks had nothing to build around - and no other elites wanted to come to NY because of the constant clown show deck shuffling of coaches and general management, and notoriously poor behavior of Dolan the owner.</p>

<p>The Knicks needed him to stay at any cost - because without Melo during that period they had nothing else.</p>

<p>What? The Knicks were supposed to rely on Jeremy Lin with his 20 game highlight career?</p>

<p>Captain Hennessey who probably spent more time in the club than he did at practice and whose head was out of the game during critical moments - probably as a result of being in the club till 3 o’clock in the morning on game day.</p>

<p>A broken down Amare Stat that wasn’t even half the player he was in Phoenix.</p>

<p>A young and inconsistent Porzingis who was prone to injury?</p>

<p>An archaic Jason Kidd?</p>

<p>An even more archaic Pablo Prigioni?</p>

<p>Iman Shumpert who was good but not great - and didn’t have a long range jumpshot.</p>

<p>Make it make sense, man.</p>

      <label for="leef49u" class="commentText"><p>They&rsquo;re shitting on Melo for his revisionist history. All he cared about was his stat line and his money.  He didn&rsquo;t give a fuck about winning. Say what you want about Durant, but he went to the Warriors to get a ring.</p>

<p>It is disingenuous for Melo to say it wasn&rsquo;t about the money. He forced the trade to New York ahead of FA to get the 5-year max from the Knicks rather than signing the four-year Free Agency Max and gutted the Knicks roster&rsquo;s young role players, including Wilson Chandler, Gallo, Ray Felton, Mozgov, and first-round pick in the process.</p>

Melo made a stink of wanting to go to the Knicks and got there and basically just phoned it in and delivered little to no actual team success.</p>

<ul>
<li>1st he says he didnt know how the CBA worked, didnt know that there&rsquo;d be a lockout to consider when he signed his 5 yr deal — then he says Lebron called him during the lockout and said he and Wade were taking 3 year deals. but Melo told him he was gonna think about it and ended up taking the full 5 years. so Melo knew he would lock himself out of options when he signed his extension, he can&rsquo;t cite ignorance as to why he took the deal.</li>
<li>then he says he wouldve been <sup>23</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub> and be a 4th option. google says Melo is 40 right now, so he would&rsquo;ve been <sup>26</sup>&frasl;<sub>27</sub> — and there was no way the Heat could sign all 4 of them. even getting to a Big 3 involved DWade taking a significant paycut. he wouldve been the Bosh replacement/3rd option at worst</li>
<li>and he also says the plan was for him + Lebron to go somewhere, and Wade + Bosh to go somewhere. this is the 1st im ever hearing of that plan. id heard iterations like Wade + Lebron going to Chicago with Rose, not what Melo says here</li>

<p>It’s basically a lie for anyone following basketball discourse at the time, I rate Melo higher than this sub. I don’t think he was an inefficient chucker like he is painted these days, I also think the Knicks didn’t proper build around him but he didn’t wanted to take pay cut for the «banana boat» reunion and it’s fair. Just don’t cry about rings tho lol.</p>

      <label for="leei01d" class="commentText"><p>I don’t blame him but a quote by Chauncey always a screamed volumes about Melo.</p>

<p>“It meant too much because he could have games where he had 20, 22 [points], we win the game and he’s mad. He might have 36 and he’s in there, you know, we lose the game and he’s in there picking everybody up. Scoring 30 meant too much”</p>

<p>It was never about winning either for Melo so they’ could’ve offered him to be the 2nd option and he would’ve declined still.</p>

<p>His ego held him back.</p>

Bc it was about the stats, the self, and not the bigger picture winning championships. Melo doesn’t have a legacy imo maybe in NY bc it seems they loved him but he was a great scorer that didn’t win a damn thing. And the lack of sacrifice shows why you’ll only be considered a Great Olympic baller but not Great in the NBA sense. Greats Win!</p>

      <label for="leei8al" class="commentText"><p>Why the fuck would he have been a 4th option? This is such a lie lol. First of all, Bosh was his replacement when he signed that longer deal. Second of all, he was easily the 2nd best offensive weapon out of the 4 of them, if not the 1st even. They would&rsquo;ve moved him to the 4 on defense, so he could play even less defense than he already was and focus solely on being unstoppable on offense.</p>

<p>This would&rsquo;ve also let Bosh play outside more and he would&rsquo;ve accelerated his stretch 4 progression.</p>

<p>Bro chose the quick money, regrets it, and now doesn&rsquo;t want to be clowned for it. Especially wild since Wade and LeBron are obviously both doing better financially, and bosh probably would&rsquo;ve been if his career wasn&rsquo;t cut short.</p>

<p>Tl:dr Melo chose incorrectly regardless of the reasons for his choice.</p>

What a silly metric and response.</p>

<p>Holding aside that 11 other players have to do their part, there are so many other factors that go into winning an NBA championship that have nothing to do with any player.</p>

<p>And if you think for a second that Carmelo was not championship caliber, maybe you need to take a beat and go look at his entire CV. He has one of the most impressive resumes of any baller.</p>
