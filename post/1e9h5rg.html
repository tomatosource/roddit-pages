      <label for="lee8p5d" class="commentText"><p>This is what people mean when they say Wade and Bosh sacrificed in order to win. Each of them could have gone on leading their teams in numbers, status, role, but they willingly handed the keys to LeBron and lost out on those things in favor of competing in 4 straight Finals. It&rsquo;s fine that Melo didn&rsquo;t want to, we don&rsquo;t need to crucify him for it, but we also need to give players who set their egos aside their flowers.</p>

      <label for="lee9blp" class="commentText"><p>Wade didn’t sacrifice initially in fairness. In 2010 and 2011, they ran the ball through him way more than they realistically should have. Lebron was a minimum top 2 player all time, in his prime, yet Wade posted a higher USG% their first year together.</p>

<p>Obviously you can’t just tell Wade to drastically reduce his usage in reality, but they’d have been better team playing Lebron-Ball. And the best version of the Heat was 2012-13 when Lebron was doing everything.</p>

      <label for="leeap9a" class="commentText"><p>While that&rsquo;s true, this is a guy who had won a title there as the primary playmaker with the ball in his hands all the time willingly teaming up with another ball-dominant star who was rated as better than him. He had to have known what he was signing up for: more rebounding, cutting, defense, and less credit for winning. His Heat legacy was secure by 2010, he really didn&rsquo;t have to do it.</p>

      <label for="leei3l3" class="commentText"><p>That wasn’t the main issue. Wade averaged 26ppg on 58% TS and Lebron 27ppg on 59% TS ( both very efficient) and they  won 58 games and made the finals. The issue was once in the finals Wade continued to perform well but Lebron disappeared on offense and didn’t want the ball.</p>

<p>That obviously changed the next year but if Lebron had just played at his regular season level Miami beats the Mavs in 5</p>

      <label for="leeqm59" class="commentText"><p>It wasn’t a perfect fit but you have to realize they didn’t have any depth that year because all the money went to the big 3 and they didn’t put any shooting around them. Also they started the season 9-8 as the had to adjust but finished much stronger and were much better than any Lebron Cavs team.</p>

<p>4 straight finals and 2 titles, and it could have been better if Lebron showed up in 2011 or Wades knees didn’t fail. It’s rare two superstars fit perfectly together and only the Bulls and Lakers had more success in recent history.</p>

<p>But as it goes, it <strong>had</strong> to happen the way it did. Because Bron in 2012 took off &amp; Wade gave him the keys.</p>

And if LeBron(and Bosh) could play that 2nd fiddle role or didn’t got starstrucked by Finals logo, Wade would have carried them to a championship in 2011 so i don’t think this criticism is fair in the slightest.</p>

      <label for="leef1pz" class="commentText"><p>I don’t agree with either of those statements. If i need to go by 5-year periods, i definitely would’ve put 2012-2016 as LeBron’s peak. I’m aware that he was more athletic and just younger in the timeframe you gave but he added so much to his game after 2011.</p>

<p>2011 Wade can do %80 things that 2011 LeBron can do, and do some of it better than him. Can’t say the same for 2013 or 2016 LeBron even if we continue to compare him against 2011 Wade rather than their respective years.</p>

Wade definitely turned it on in the playoffs, though, he killed us in the finals and was probably the best player in that series</p>

Definitely a huge letdown for LeBron but having two guys with that level of production seems like a sort of “second fiddle.” I’d have to look at stat lines first other championship teams but my instinct would be to guess that it’s not common to have a second option produce far above those numbers without having the third option decline. I could be wildly wrong though, just my gut feeling.</p>

      <label for="leel4u3" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s actually more complicated than that even. Wade is used to playing a certain way. He is used to being effective in a very specific way. He gets on the court with LeBron and Bosh he might now even really know how to effectively take a role other than what he has been doing. Some players can easily switch their role and be effective. Other players are only effective in on-ball or off-ball situations offensively. So it can literally take more than one season to figure out how to play as a well oiled machine. Wade might have wanted to not be the no. 1 option and recognized LeBron should be that guy, but he didn&rsquo;t know how to play any differently at that point. Same with LeBron, and a young LeBron coming from another team might have felt it was &ldquo;Wade&rsquo;s team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They figured it out. Mostly because Bosh figured out how to play really effectively in a tertiary role.</p>

<p>Would a 24 year old Anthony be even able to effectively turn himself into a tertiary player? Probably not. He probably will have not added too much value to that team to be honest. At a certain point adding more and more ball dominant scorers leads to extreme diminishing returns.</p>

Nothing prevented him from taking over in the NBA finals in 2011, foh.  Wade was more clutch in the Redeem Team too. Seriously, what is wrong with these young folks, did you watch the games? Lebron was fresh off choking and giving up against Boston after he left Cleveland.  What had he earned by that time? Wade had actually won a title being the centerpiece and would have won in 2011 and had Finals MVP if Lebron delivered just &ldquo;pretty good second star&rdquo; performances on both ends of the floor.</p>

I could argue with Barkley’s 93 mvp and Malone’s 97 mvp, but I think they both were the right choice despite us all knowing who the best player in the league was then (so much for your homer argument). Lebron was still the best player in the league in 2016, but Steph was more valuable to his team’s success.</p>

      <label for="leeol9z" class="commentText"><p>What? Flair checks out. To say Lebron didn’t have an argument for MVP that year is crazy. Lebron had better stats than Rose across the board. AKA value. Bulls fans always bring up team success when talking about that award. “Well Rose won it because they were the top seed”. Then we get in the playoffs and the two teams match up and you’re like “there’s no way Rose brings more value than that Lebron guy”. </p>

      <label for="leelb92" class="commentText"><p>Lets use our capacity for nuance here.</p>

<p>Wade welcoming two stars to HIS team with open arms knowing he would have a diminished offensive role because of it is infinitely selfless compared to KD hopping on the Warriors bandwagon. Bosh being a 24-11 all-star first option and becoming a stretch 4 and eventually stretch 5 defense-first role player so that Wade and LeBron could flourish.</p>

<p>To do that in the name of winning, not knowing for sure if it would work or not, is completely different than joining the most extreme example of an already established winning situation and comically labeling it the hardest road.</p>

It continues to provide ammunition into the &lsquo;this is why you never won anything&rsquo; take that is popular surrounding his career and the reason why he had an unceremonious exit from the NBA.</p>

      <label for="leeawg3" class="commentText"><p>As a Nugs fan, I&rsquo;m glad he went that route and didn&rsquo;t wait for the summer cause we got a pretty huge haul for him.</p>

<p>He could&rsquo;ve waited and given the Knicks some more money/picks, etc to be able to build a better team around him.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t fault him for wanting to go home, as much as I didn&rsquo;t want him to leave but if his heart ain&rsquo;t here then it&rsquo;ll affect his performance, attitude, and team chemistry so it was time for him to go.</p>

<p>But it also goes to show, him leading the team vs LBJ leading the team is different.</p>

<p>He wasn&rsquo;t willing to do it all and his role on the team was mainly scorer, instead of the jack of all trades role, unless you have a great team with people fitting each role well, you aren&rsquo;t going to win.</p>

<p>Maybe regular season but everyone knows how different regular season is compared to the playoffs.</p>

<p>Offensively, one of the greatest scorers, with probably one of the nicest jumpers in the draft class and beyond, quick first step and jab step, etc. but that will only take you so far.</p>

<p>As much as I can understand why he and others may have not liked George Karl, the thing about Melo not wanting to sacrifice, play defense, be a leader, etc does look to be true.</p>

<p>Him and Wade sort of made it work with off ball cuts and what not, but it was janky. Bron+Bosh lineups often outperformed Bron+Wade+Bosh lineups. Melo would’ve been a nightmare.</p>

<p>Look at the roster LeBron dragged to the Finals in &lsquo;07, for example. That&rsquo;s obviously not a standard we should hold every star player to, but for the life of me I can&rsquo;t remember a time where I thought a player looked better because they were playing with Melo.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t a knock on Melo either, he was a phenomenal player, but not someone who would lead his team to the Finals as the best player in the roster.</p>

<ul>
<li>1st he says he didnt know how the CBA worked, didnt know that there&rsquo;d be a lockout to consider when he signed his 5 yr deal — then he says Lebron called him during the lockout and said he and Wade were taking 3 year deals. but Melo told him he was gonna think about it and ended up taking the full 5 years. so Melo knew he would lock himself out of options when he signed his extension, he can&rsquo;t cite ignorance as to why he took the deal.</li>
<li>then he says he wouldve been <sup>23</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub> and be a 4th option. google says Melo is 40 right now, so he would&rsquo;ve been <sup>26</sup>&frasl;<sub>27</sub> — and there was no way the Heat could sign all 4 of them. even getting to a Big 3 involved DWade taking a significant paycut. he wouldve been the Bosh replacement/3rd option at worst</li>
<li>and he also says the plan was for him + Lebron to go somewhere, and Wade + Bosh to go somewhere. this is the 1st im ever hearing of that plan. id heard iterations like Wade + Lebron going to Chicago with Rose, not what Melo says here</li>

<p>They all took less than the max. LeBron as the 25 year old best player in the league taking a paycut was and is absurd, but he really did it, with no regard for his public perception.</p>

<p>It is disingenuous for Melo to say it wasn&rsquo;t about the money. He forced the trade to New York ahead of FA to get the 5-year max from the Knicks rather than signing the four-year Free Agency Max and gutted the Knicks roster&rsquo;s young role players, including Wilson Chandler, Gallo, Ray Felton, Mozgov, and first-round pick in the process.</p>

      <label for="lees8ts" class="commentText"><p>Yeah man. Melo was my fucking guy when he played for us. I had a blast watching those teams.
But honestly the way he talks about his legacy it’s hard to keep respecting him. He’s obviously butt hurt that a new 15 came in and did what he couldn’t do but Jokic is everything that Melo needed to be to get over the hump, mainly a selfless basketball player.</p>

<p>Melo will always have my respect but its dwindling.</p>

<p>It’s basically a lie for anyone following basketball discourse at the time, I rate Melo higher than this sub. I don’t think he was an inefficient chucker like he is painted these days, I also think the Knicks didn’t proper build around him but he didn’t wanted to take pay cut for the «banana boat» reunion and it’s fair. Just don’t cry about rings tho lol.</p>

      <label for="leepl2b" class="commentText"><p>I think Melo is somewhat impossible to build around. All stars have to somewhat buy into the system to win. Even Jordan had to, with a team that was completely optimized for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good locker room guy&rdquo; gets memed on these days, but that stuff really matters when it comes to winning championships. Not so much making the playoffs and dropping 30 a night, which I suppose Melo did plenty of.</p>

<p>“It meant too much because he could have games where he had 20, 22 [points], we win the game and he’s mad. He might have 36 and he’s in there, you know, we lose the game and he’s in there picking everybody up. Scoring 30 meant too much”</p>

<p>It was never about winning either for Melo so they’ could’ve offered him to be the 2nd option and he would’ve declined still.</p>

<p>His ego held him back.</p>

<p>Melo my guy, Larry freaking Brown would&rsquo;ve sniffed out your me-first attitude during training camp of your rookie season. there&rsquo;s about about 0% chance Brown would&rsquo;ve favored Prince over you. you would&rsquo;ve spent your most development years playing mop-up minutes.</p>

<p>you thought Karl&rsquo;s Detlef Schrempf comment was offensive? LB would&rsquo;ve showed you Bob Wilkerson tape and tell you that&rsquo;s what he needs from you.</p>

Melo doesn’t have a legacy imo maybe in NY bc it seems they loved him but he was a great scorer that didn’t win a damn thing. And the lack of sacrifice shows why you’ll only be considered a Great Olympic baller but not Great in the NBA sense. Greats Win!</p>

He had a me-first career, he made a ton of money on dysfunctional teams, he didn&rsquo;t end up doing a lot in the playoffs, it is what it is! He&rsquo;s wealthy beyond imagination and respected by his peers. Let it go man!</p>

      <label for="leepxqp" class="commentText"><p>This is why when my fellow Knicks fans say he never had help, I tried to explain that he did not want help. He was never a first option on a chip team, but he never wanted to be less than a first option. Guaranteed no rings if he’s on the team.</p>

<p>Craziest part is it wasn’t just a basketball thing either. He wanted the shots AND the spotlight. Lin woulda had less shots than him, Melo could’ve still averaged 25+, but dude wants the full spotlight and all the shots.</p>

      <label for="leer14q" class="commentText"><p>Yeah. I never really liked Melo after he insisted on the trade. That’s not to absolve the Knicks of being stupid and trading the farm for him, but Melo should’ve sucked it up and just left in free agency. His record in New York didn’t help either. My derision has gone down since then, but I doubt he’ll ever be a favorite of mine.</p>
