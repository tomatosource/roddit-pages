      <label for="lee8p5d" class="commentText"><p>This is what people mean when they say Wade and Bosh sacrificed in order to win. Each of them could have gone on leading their teams in numbers, status, role, but they willingly handed the keys to LeBron and lost out on those things in favor of competing in 4 straight Finals. It&rsquo;s fine that Melo didn&rsquo;t want to, we don&rsquo;t need to crucify him for it, but we also need to give players who set their egos aside their flowers.</p>

      <label for="lee9blp" class="commentText"><p>Wade didn’t sacrifice initially in fairness. In 2010 and 2011, they ran the ball through him way more than they realistically should have. Lebron was a minimum top 2 player all time, in his prime, yet Wade posted a higher USG% their first year together.</p>

<p>Obviously you can’t just tell Wade to drastically reduce his usage in reality, but they’d have been better team playing Lebron-Ball. And the best version of the Heat was 2012-13 when Lebron was doing everything.</p>

      <label for="leeap9a" class="commentText"><p>While that&rsquo;s true, this is a guy who had won a title there as the primary playmaker with the ball in his hands all the time willingly teaming up with another ball-dominant star who was rated as better than him. He had to have known what he was signing up for: more rebounding, cutting, defense, and less credit for winning. His Heat legacy was secure by 2010, he really didn&rsquo;t have to do it.</p>

      <label for="leei3l3" class="commentText"><p>That wasn’t the main issue. Wade averaged 26ppg on 58% TS and Lebron 27ppg on 59% TS ( both very efficient) and they  won 58 games and made the finals. The issue was once in the finals Wade continued to perform well but Lebron disappeared on offense and didn’t want the ball.</p>

<p>That obviously changed the next year but if Lebron had just played at his regular season level Miami beats the Mavs in 5</p>

      <label for="leeva5c" class="commentText"><p>The other commenter is also ignoring how the Heat Big 3 era infamously started 9-8 before a players only meeting was held to figure things out, after which they went 49-16 to finish out the season. On an 82 game season, that’s a pace of about 62 wins so not even off the pace of those Cavs teams he’s comparing it to. I think a grace period of 17 games is fair when integrating two new superstars and overall roster reconstruction.</p>

<p>No it wasn’t some crazy perfect fit like the KD Warriors and there were roster flaws like the center rotation and lack of depth, but just pointing out at an overall record to say it wasn’t a great fit is lazy. Regular season records can be misleading to determine fit because things like injuries and older teams coasting to save themselves for the playoffs can happen so you can have a better fit team with a worse record than a team that might be great in the regular season because they’re a decent fit and young.</p>

      <label for="leeqm59" class="commentText"><p>It wasn’t a perfect fit but you have to realize they didn’t have any depth that year because all the money went to the big 3 and they didn’t put any shooting around them. Also they started the season 9-8 as the had to adjust but finished much stronger and were much better than any Lebron Cavs team.</p>

<p>4 straight finals and 2 titles, and it could have been better if Lebron showed up in 2011 or Wades knees didn’t fail. It’s rare two superstars fit perfectly together and only the Bulls and Lakers had more success in recent history.</p>

      <label for="leel4u3" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s actually more complicated than that even. Wade is used to playing a certain way. He is used to being effective in a very specific way. He gets on the court with LeBron and Bosh he might now even really know how to effectively take a role other than what he has been doing. Some players can easily switch their role and be effective. Other players are only effective in on-ball or off-ball situations offensively. So it can literally take more than one season to figure out how to play as a well oiled machine. Wade might have wanted to not be the no. 1 option and recognized LeBron should be that guy, but he didn&rsquo;t know how to play any differently at that point. Same with LeBron, and a young LeBron coming from another team might have felt it was &ldquo;Wade&rsquo;s team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They figured it out. Mostly because Bosh figured out how to play really effectively in a tertiary role.</p>

<p>Would a 24 year old Anthony be even able to effectively turn himself into a tertiary player? Probably not. He probably will have not added too much value to that team to be honest. At a certain point adding more and more ball dominant scorers leads to extreme diminishing returns.</p>

<p>Though interestingly enough, the best version of Carmelo was when he played on Olympic teams. I would argue he&rsquo;s one of the US&rsquo;s greatest Olympics players because his skill set was perfect for FIBA. And Melo was not ball dominant on those teams but an elite catch &amp; score player.</p>

<p>Though it&rsquo;s a lot different an ask of &ldquo;sacrifice a little pride for a Gold Medal&rdquo; to &ldquo;take a lesser role and permanently lower your contract value.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lefrn7d" class="commentText"><p>Very true. Also his good Olympic years were in his late 20s at his absolute peak. At 24 I don&rsquo;t think he was capable of making those adjustments. He did play in the Olympics around that age and didn&rsquo;t get very many minutes and shot poorly.</p>

      <label for="lefui5u" class="commentText"><p>So, and I had to look this up so no worries about not knowing it either, Carmelo Anthony&rsquo;s first Olympics was the terrible 2004 Olympics where the team got Bronze and the roster was a bunch of non-shooting sub-All Stars. Melo did not play a lot nor was he very good when he did. That said, he was 20.</p>

<p>Now when he was 24, he did play in the Olympics for the <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/international/teams/united-states/2008.html" target="_blank">famous Redeem Team</a>. He was the 4th leading scorer and functioned as our best volume 3pt shooter. I want to say he was even better at the next Olympics but he did a pretty good adjustment job at 24 for that team.</p>

      <label for="leeciik" class="commentText"><p>2012-2013 LeBron is a much different beast than 2010-2011 LeBron. And if LeBron(and Bosh) could play that 2nd fiddle role or didn’t got starstrucked by Finals logo, Wade would have carried them to a championship in 2011 so i don’t think this criticism is fair in the slightest.</p>

      <label for="leef1pz" class="commentText"><p>I don’t agree with either of those statements. If i need to go by 5-year periods, i definitely would’ve put 2012-2016 as LeBron’s peak. I’m aware that he was more athletic and just younger in the timeframe you gave but he added so much to his game after 2011.</p>

<p>2011 Wade can do %80 things that 2011 LeBron can do, and do some of it better than him. Can’t say the same for 2013 or 2016 LeBron even if we continue to compare him against 2011 Wade rather than their respective years.</p>

He was fantastic but imo Rose, LBJ, D12, Kobe and Dirk were top 5 in the regular season with KD/Wade being number 6. Also shout out to CP3 for dragging that Hornets team to the playoffs as well. Wade definitely turned it on in the playoffs, though, he killed us in the finals and was probably the best player in that series</p>

      <label for="leelwmk" class="commentText"><p>LeBron averaged 18/7/7 and Bosh 18/7/1 in the 2011 Finals. Definitely a huge letdown for LeBron but having two guys with that level of production seems like a sort of “second fiddle.” I’d have to look at stat lines first other championship teams but my instinct would be to guess that it’s not common to have a second option produce far above those numbers without having the third option decline. I could be wildly wrong though, just my gut feeling.</p>

The real issue wasn’t just Bron plsy but the fact Bosh didn’t step up like Wade did and the roster lack of shooting/talent once Bron was the focus of the D, with spo playing Joel Anthony too much too</p>

<p>Lebron thought he could be passive h aversge 18/7/7 and win but it didn’t work, I’m sure he thought it made more sense of Bosh n Wade cooked but Bosh struggles too</p>

<p>At the very least he could play defense but he wasnt even doing that. Bosh was the THIRD option. You’d expect him to struggle more than the other 2. </p>

      <label for="leelb92" class="commentText"><p>Lets use our capacity for nuance here.</p>

<p>Wade welcoming two stars to HIS team with open arms knowing he would have a diminished offensive role because of it is infinitely selfless compared to KD hopping on the Warriors bandwagon. Bosh being a 24-11 all-star first option and becoming a stretch 4 and eventually stretch 5 defense-first role player so that Wade and LeBron could flourish.</p>

<p>To do that in the name of winning, not knowing for sure if it would work or not, is completely different than joining the most extreme example of an already established winning situation and comically labeling it the hardest road.</p>

It is fair to blame him for choosing his money over winning opportunities. He always chose to get the most years at the highest rate possible. He forced the Knicks to trade so he could get the fifth-year max by dangling that he would choose Brooklyn over them if he made it to FA.</p>

Guess you could say the same about Lebron or even Wade tho, how they came from disadvantaged backgrounds and chose to win taking smaller deals… don’t know much about Bosh outside the NBA.</p>

There’s a world where he gets Bosh and a couple good starters into that cap space instead of Lebron and is a serious contender for  that 2011 title anyway.</p>

<p>After that he was always hurt one way or another though and it had to be Lebron’s show.</p>

Knowing the context of how his career played out, I can&rsquo;t help but view this statement as a continuation of him having a severely inflated view of himself. It continues to provide ammunition into the &lsquo;this is why you never won anything&rsquo; take that is popular surrounding his career and the reason why he had an unceremonious exit from the NBA.</p>

He has a few. Him suggesting he doesn&rsquo;t want to go from leading his team statistically to being the 4th option, is not the same as suggesting &lsquo;I want to work with my team and beat those guys even more now&rsquo;. I have no idea if that&rsquo;s his intention, since the interviews don&rsquo;t make it seem like that.</p>

<p>But, you pair the above with the same concept of him laughing at coming off the bench. Well, if it&rsquo;s what is best for the team in order to succeed, why not? He laughed at it because there&rsquo;s no way for him to even consider that with his ego.</p>

      <label for="leexq9x" class="commentText"><p>I know a lot of Nuggets fans still come off as haters, but seriously Melo was selfish to a serious degree as a player. The common quote from Billups was “Melo would rather score 30 in a loss, than 15 in a win.” Dude was about his own star status and money, so any time he tries to paint it a different way, I just roll my eyes</p>

So it never quite worked but I can thank him for bringing basketball back to Denver.  I only own one nuggets jersey and it’s Jokic but I still appreciate melo.  It’s a shame billups couldn’t win here.  I played for gw youth and he was still active there even then he did love Colorado or Denver</p>

      <label for="lef9h9p" class="commentText"><p>Listen I respect Melo for really revitalizing the Nuggets after about a decade of irrelevance, but that’s sort of his legacy here at this point. He was our star after a dark period but his “accomplishments” beyond that are fairly hollow. I respect his contributions in that way, but between his inability to achieve much (individually or as a team) and his messy exit, I’m not really endeared to him or his narratives</p>

      <label for="leexw04" class="commentText"><p>He contradicted himself. Just before he said “do you know where I’m from? I ain’t leaving no money on the table.” At the end of the day Melo didnt win a ring because he didn’t want to that much. He valued money, stats, and location (said I ain’t going to Cleveland) over winning. He only wanted to win if he was the number one guy. So he has no one to blame but himself.</p>

<p>He had the opportunities, to team up with LeBron in CLE, to team up with them boys in Miami, to go to Chicago in 2014 with Rose and Butler. But every single time he said no. So I don’t ever wanna hear him complain about not winning.</p>

D Wade and Bosh have both said that the original plan was Bron Wade and Melo. Once Melo signed that 5 year deal Bron and Wade pivoted to recruiting Bosh to each of their teams until it eventually led to them deciding on Miami. Melo just makes excuses for his poor career decisions.</p>

      <label for="leeawg3" class="commentText"><p>As a Nugs fan, I&rsquo;m glad he went that route and didn&rsquo;t wait for the summer cause we got a pretty huge haul for him.</p>

<p>He could&rsquo;ve waited and given the Knicks some more money/picks, etc to be able to build a better team around him.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t fault him for wanting to go home, as much as I didn&rsquo;t want him to leave but if his heart ain&rsquo;t here then it&rsquo;ll affect his performance, attitude, and team chemistry so it was time for him to go.</p>

<p>But it also goes to show, him leading the team vs LBJ leading the team is different.</p>

<p>He wasn&rsquo;t willing to do it all and his role on the team was mainly scorer, instead of the jack of all trades role, unless you have a great team with people fitting each role well, you aren&rsquo;t going to win.</p>

<p>Maybe regular season but everyone knows how different regular season is compared to the playoffs.</p>

<p>Offensively, one of the greatest scorers, with probably one of the nicest jumpers in the draft class and beyond, quick first step and jab step, etc. but that will only take you so far.</p>

<p>As much as I can understand why he and others may have not liked George Karl, the thing about Melo not wanting to sacrifice, play defense, be a leader, etc does look to be true.</p>

<ul>
<li>1st he says he didnt know how the CBA worked, didnt know that there&rsquo;d be a lockout to consider when he signed his 5 yr deal — then he says Lebron called him during the lockout and said he and Wade were taking 3 year deals. but Melo told him he was gonna think about it and ended up taking the full 5 years. so Melo knew he would lock himself out of options when he signed his extension, he can&rsquo;t cite ignorance as to why he took the deal.</li>
<li>then he says he wouldve been <sup>23</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub> and be a 4th option. google says Melo is 40 right now, so he would&rsquo;ve been <sup>26</sup>&frasl;<sub>27</sub> — and there was no way the Heat could sign all 4 of them. even getting to a Big 3 involved DWade taking a significant paycut. he wouldve been the Bosh replacement/3rd option at worst</li>
<li>and he also says the plan was for him + Lebron to go somewhere, and Wade + Bosh to go somewhere. this is the 1st im ever hearing of that plan. id heard iterations like Wade + Lebron going to Chicago with Rose, not what Melo says here</li>

<p>They all took less than the max. LeBron as the 25 year old best player in the league taking a paycut was and is absurd, but he really did it, with no regard for his public perception.</p>

The secret is what he never understood. He would never sacrifice a damn thing in his prime for a chip.  Made it to the conference finals once, swept 5 times. That’s all you need to know about his career.</p>

<p>Edit: missed playoffs 4 years in a row in his prime.
Averaged 25-27 in his prime. Never a winner.</p>

<p>Melo made some bad decisions but Amare had a max deal taking up a large amount of the cap and being injured the entire time. Melo’s NY failure is far more due to Knicks mismanagement than him.</p>

<p>Yes he could have done some things differently but the Knicks were a dumpster fire - we traded 1st rounders for Bargnani after Melo took us to the 2nd seed with JR Smith as his second option.</p>

      <label for="leekdn8" class="commentText"><p>As the best player on his team, especially as a star like Melo was, he is.</p>

<p>Look at the roster LeBron dragged to the Finals in &lsquo;07, for example. That&rsquo;s obviously not a standard we should hold every star player to, but for the life of me I can&rsquo;t remember a time where I thought a player looked better because they were playing with Melo.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t a knock on Melo either, he was a phenomenal player, but not someone who would lead his team to the Finals as the best player in the roster.</p>

      <label for="leei01d" class="commentText"><p>I don’t blame him but a quote by Chauncey always a screamed volumes about Melo.</p>

<p>“It meant too much because he could have games where he had 20, 22 [points], we win the game and he’s mad. He might have 36 and he’s in there, you know, we lose the game and he’s in there picking everybody up. Scoring 30 meant too much”</p>

<p>It was never about winning either for Melo so they’ could’ve offered him to be the 2nd option and he would’ve declined still.</p>

<p>His ego held him back.</p>

<p>It is disingenuous for Melo to say it wasn&rsquo;t about the money. He forced the trade to New York ahead of FA to get the 5-year max from the Knicks rather than signing the four-year Free Agency Max and gutted the Knicks roster&rsquo;s young role players, including Wilson Chandler, Gallo, Ray Felton, Mozgov, and first-round pick in the process.</p>

<p>Melo my guy, Larry freaking Brown would&rsquo;ve sniffed out your me-first attitude during training camp of your rookie season. there&rsquo;s about about 0% chance Brown would&rsquo;ve favored Prince over you. you would&rsquo;ve spent your most development years playing mop-up minutes.</p>

<p>you thought Karl&rsquo;s Detlef Schrempf comment was offensive? LB would&rsquo;ve showed you Bob Wilkerson tape and tell you that&rsquo;s what he needs from you.</p>

<p>It’s basically a lie for anyone following basketball discourse at the time, I rate Melo higher than this sub. I don’t think he was an inefficient chucker like he is painted these days, I also think the Knicks didn’t proper build around him but he didn’t wanted to take pay cut for the «banana boat» reunion and it’s fair. Just don’t cry about rings tho lol.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good locker room guy&rdquo; gets memed on these days, but that stuff really matters when it comes to winning championships. Not so much making the playoffs and dropping 30 a night, which I suppose Melo did plenty of.</p>

<p>Craziest part is it wasn’t just a basketball thing either. He wanted the shots AND the spotlight. Lin woulda had less shots than him, Melo could’ve still averaged 25+, but dude wants the full spotlight and all the shots.</p>

      <label for="lef04fd" class="commentText"><p>This is why Bosh is one of my favorite of all time. He literally did what someone like Carmelo can barely imagine himself doing. Bosh could have racked up stats in Toronto until his medical issue revealed itself, but he understood that he would have a pivotal role as a “1Z” or “2” behind GOAT 1A and 1B. He showed up, made adjustments, was open and humble about the challenges, but knew it would pay off.</p>

      <label for="leerims" class="commentText"><p>And people say Melo thought he was better than he is.   Knowing he&rsquo;s the 4th option on that team is very self aware. Knowing even if money is same, he&rsquo;d be incredibly unhappy being 4th option regardless of team success also pretty self aware</p>

      <label for="leev9ub" class="commentText"><p>Why is it that players always love to lie about money. Just be honest and say, &ldquo; it absolutely had to do with money. I wanted to make the absolute max amount of money in my career while still playing my hardest to win.&rdquo; Am I wrong in thinking fans would still respect a player for saying this?</p>

      <label for="leew5j0" class="commentText"><p>Carmelo is so annoying to me. He had so much potential had he just let his ego go.</p>

<p>I thought after the Olympics he would’ve finally learned how to play team basketball but nope still same old selfish Melo.</p>

<p>He could’ve truly been one of the greats had he learned humility.</p>

      <label for="leg9fop" class="commentText"><p>It took Melo like 15 years to finally accept a bench role, the man was out of the league before he could read the writing on the wall. There&rsquo;s no way he would have even accepted being the 2nd option in his prime, no matter if it was Kobe, MJ or Lebron who was the #1 option.</p>

<p>Melo wasn&rsquo;t having it no matter what.</p>
