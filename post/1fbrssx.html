They made Poole look like a kid who got bullied, the school then protected the bully because his parents are rich and donate money every year. He plays like a dumbass, but what Golden State did was just down right messed up and awful.</p>

      <label for="lm78eqd" class="commentText"><p>Because people like to romanticize the shit people like Jordan and Kobe did to their teammates just because they won alot. when in reality they&rsquo;re shit heads who acted like petulant little children who assaulted people and mistreated people so they could win a game. And I say this as a massive Jordan fan myself. I wish I people wouldn&rsquo;t romanticize that shit about them. They were great players who were also awful at times and if they treated people the way they did in any other scenario it wouldn&rsquo;t go well for them.</p>

      <label for="lm89ih8" class="commentText"><p>I am a Kobe fan, so I guess there&rsquo;s some bias here and there in how I see this matter. But I also worked with different teams with different kind of bosses (served as one in varying capacity) in varying degree of pressure and importance of the job. And in my opinion, remove the romanticism and you are left with the fact that the Jordans and the Kobes are important in a diverse team. Some react positively to praise centric, gentle leadership while others would get lazy from them. Some people react positively with in your face, challenge driven leadership while others crumble. What you don&rsquo;t want are leaders who stays an &ldquo;asshole&rdquo; whether the team &ldquo;win&rdquo; or &ldquo;loss&rdquo;.</p>

Good job to the team though, they got off him and now no one gets to succeed</p>

<p>Going from that to the Washington Wizards and having to play off ball next to Kyle Kuzma and Tyus Jones would have a hard transition <em>without</em> getting punched in the face and treated like they treated him.</p>

NBA franchises talk with money and contracts, and to me it&rsquo;s pretty clear what the franchise was saying.</p>

      <label for="lm7c0qb" class="commentText"><p>Poole is a flawed player in a money laundering team. I’m arguing that Draymond fucked up and ruined a chance at keeping the dynasty going with Poole. Poole went from a g league player in 2021 to a finals starter in 2022 and played incredible in the second round, conference finals, and the finals. What are you arguing?</p>

<p>No, he&rsquo;s just not that great. But let&rsquo;s blame Draymond. Truth is he&rsquo;s great for a 2nd unit, but was never meant to replace Curry. Oh, and since you don&rsquo;t actually watch the games&hellip; Why don&rsquo;t you look up how many NBA finals games Poole started. Literally 0.</p>

<p>Still think getting knocked out on camera is the biggest reason for that. The franchise not sticking up for him was bad but don&rsquo;t think that alone would cause a player to lose confidence in himself to this degree.</p>

<p>The punch is just embarrassing and bruising to his ego as a man. When you search his name on youtube one of the first things you will see is him getting knocked out. That is hard to recover from.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s nonsensical. Yes, it should change. But it&rsquo;s part of the cultural standard &ndash; it&rsquo;s the same thing as displaying sadness or fear being seen as un-manly. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense, it&rsquo;s harmful and unfair, but that is where we are as a culture.</p>

<p>The sad deafened music and quiet crowd tries to make it seem like he&rsquo;s sitting there alone watching his tribute when that&rsquo;s not the case at all. People are clapping and his team and GSW is right there with him.</p>

Rumors were that Poole was very arrogant after the championship and I think we all saw it while he was with the wizards…Ignoring his coaches, refusing to join the huddle, telling the coach I know what to do this is my team….</p>

He still had lots of confidence - in fact, overconfidence - and did dumb things on both ends of the floor, a trend that continued in Washington.  I wish him well, he was key to the 4th ring, but you can’t blame Draymond for his play.</p>
