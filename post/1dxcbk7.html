      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dxcbk7/the_atlanta_hawks_have_23_million_trade_exception/"><p>The Atlanta Hawks have $23 million trade exception.  It is set to expire in 24 hours.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>As a result of the John Collins salary dump (TL;DR on the initial deal is the Hawks got Rudy Gay and a 2nd for their former #2 option to Trae Young), the Atlanta Hawks opened up a trade exception that was initially reported to be <span class="math inline">\(25.3 million but was finalized as a \)</span>23 million trade exception.  It is one of the largest exceptions opened up in NBA history, with the current record being a $28.5 million exception the Boston Celtics opened up via Gordon Hayward&rsquo;s sign and trade to the Hornets back in November 2020.</p>

<p>That exception was ultimately wasted, as the Celtics failed to utilize it to bring in anyone new prior to its expiration - in fact they wound up losing some of their own pending free agents in 2021.  Now, the Atlanta Hawks are in possession of a similarly large trade exception and assets to potentially bring in a player of note to shore up their depth - or if they are planning to move forward with a rebuild, a player on a contract of notable size to acquire more assets via draft picks - however said exception is soon to expire.</p>

<p>On July 8th, 2024, the Atlanta Hawks will no longer possess this notably large trade exception.  If it expires, this would mean the Hawks essentially traded away John Collins for&hellip;a protected second round pick which may not even convey; Rudy Gay was eventually traded (Along with a second rounder from the Hawks, TyTy Washington and Usman Garuba) for Patty Mills who was eventually waived by Atlanta.</p>

<p>Ironically, both the aforementioned Celtics exception and this current one involved Danny Ainge; the current GM of the Utah Jazz was in charge of the Boston Celtics at the time.</p>

<p>As for the player, John Collins is rumored to be (back) on the trade block after the Utah Jazz were &ldquo;underwhelmed&rdquo; by his <sup>2023</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub> season where his stats more closely resembled his prior seasons with Atlanta.</p>

<p>Nets for example over the last 2yrs have done just that.</p>

<p>After the Durant Trade the Nets had a $18m Trade Exception.</p>

<p>They made a Trade with Toronto swapping Dinwiddie for Schroeder.</p>

<p>Schroeder fit into the <span class="math inline">\(18m Trade Exception via KD Trade and the Nets created a new \)</span>20m Trade Exception via Dinwiddie.</p>

<p>Mikal gets Traded and Bogdanovic fit into the <span class="math inline">\(20m Trade Exception created by Dinwiddie and Mikal created a new \)</span>23m Trade Exception for Nets that expires in a year.</p>

<p>The Murray trade is likely going to fall under the same concept. It just hasn’t been officially reported yet, which is why OP’s post is a little misleading.</p>

<p>I believe Murray was traded for the two picks to create a new TPE while the players from NO were acquired via the Collins exception.</p>

<p>I don’t know the exact formula for this trade yet, but yes you’re correct.</p>

<p>Boston used most of their TPE from Hayward on Evan Fournier from Orlando. Another TPE was created but that one went unused when Fourier signed as a FA with the Knicks. That contract is now over after Detroit decided not to enact the team option on the third year of the contract</p>

      <label for="lc1jgso" class="commentText"><p>I added this in a separate comment on the inaccuracies of OP’s post, but the remaining part of the Celtics TPE was used the next off-season to acquire Josh Richardson, who was used to get Derrick White. To say the Celtics did not use the largest TPE ever, when in fact they used almost every dollar of it in two trades (one a championship level move)  is either ignorant or wilfully misleading.</p>

<p>You hear identical things about them too: Forgets their defensive assignment occasionally, not a strong offensive threat, doesn&rsquo;t play winning basketball. Never anything good about them either, if you read the discourse about Obi you&rsquo;d think he was unplayable</p>

<p>Toppin got paid though so at least front offices see his value, maybe John Collins gets redemption soon</p>

      <label for="lc0sckd" class="commentText"><p>John Collins is a fine player in a vacuum but he is overpaid relative to his production and he&rsquo;s an awkward player to integrate into one&rsquo;s team.  He lacks the quickness to guard wings or guards and he lacks the size to be a true center so he&rsquo;s in this awkward small ball stretch 5 role that he doesn&rsquo;t really thrive in since it&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s taking and making them at a high volume.  He&rsquo;s just kind of&hellip;there, and he hasn&rsquo;t shown a ton of improvements as a player despite only being 26 years old.</p>

<p>He also went through a pretty rough stretch where he was recovering from a finger injury that royally damaged both his reputation and shooting for a full season.</p>

<p>One thing this Celtics ring should teach you is that big wings are extremelyy valuable in so many ways.</p>

<p>Dyson could also be an awesome fit with Trae. Lot of optimism to be had for hawks fans even if it takes a few years.</p>

      <label for="lc1iyqu" class="commentText"><p>The Celtics used the Hayward TPE to acquire Evan Fournier mid season in 20-21 and then the rest on Josh Richardson in off-season before 21-22. Whilst Fournier didn’t work out and was let go to clog up the Knicks cap, Richardson was eventually used to get future NBA Champion Derrick White along with Romeo Langford, a late ‘22 FRP, and a future FRP swap.</p>

<p>Without Richardson, it would have been difficult to acquire White, so the Hayward TPE did in fact get used for an important purpose, just not in a 1 for 1 scenario.</p>
