<p>For sure I have questions about how effective Shaq would be in an offense without any kind of perimeter shooting. But Giannis answers that question for me, for the most part.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s also silly to me, because these teams score like crazy on perimeter shots no matter who they have on them anyway. Defending three pointers is more about limiting the effectiveness of screens and pushing them off the line. We&rsquo;re in a hyper octane offensive era like the early 90s because few teams can defend that.</p>

Then teams would have to account for that, and you&rsquo;d have a lot of bigger Cs stronger PFs and the game would adapt, as it always fluctuates. 3s would go down.</p>

<p>Seriously, Shaq with four shooters around him, you dump it into him in the post to start your half court possession.  How would modern teams defend this?  They have maybe one or two bodies to throw at him, but eventually they’d run out of bigs, no?</p>

<p>Shaq was a tier below the best centers at defense in both IQ and effort, but it wasn&rsquo;t until he started ballooning in size at the end of his career that he became a true liability. In his prime he had a switch he could turn on when he wanted to really try on defense.</p>

      <label for="llgh5wu" class="commentText"><p>He wasn’t fine . That’s stupid . Maybe in Orlando but that was literally his weakness on the lakers n why lakers didn’t win like 6 rings in a row. ( that and Kobe chucking in 04 finals .)</p>

<p>People say free throws but Shaqs biggest weakness was defense being pulled away from rim . In modern era it woukd be worse but he’d also score a lot. Shaq woukd still dominate but his lakers era shaq might get more torched on defence then jokic worst years since being mvp as shaq was lazy on top of everything on D. Imagine the Steph pnr cs shaq, it’s an open three every time . Or Luka or harden or kyrie or Lebron . Shaq would not be able to out score it as easily as you think. A 40-45% three on one end, then you just hack him on the other end. Woukd reduce shaqs impact on winning . Still dominating firce but Giannis Lebron or AD types are great versatile defensive players . I don’t think shaq would be better then his own era tbh. Prob slightly worse . Instead of giving up 45% middies he’s be giving up <sup>40</sup>&frasl;<sub>45</sub>% threes . And that would hurt.</p>

<p>Also Jokic absolutely gets torched in the pnr in his career, even embid has been exposed at times tho he’s mostly ok when heakthy ( but embid is a significantly better defender when heakthy thdn shaq ever was).</p>

What would he shoot from the floor today, like 85-90%?  33% from 3 equals 50% from 2, that means you&rsquo;d have to shoot 57% from 3 to equal Shaq shooting 85% from 2.  Am I crazy to think this monster would put up 85% lol, man I don&rsquo;t know sometimes.  AC Green was 6&rsquo;9&rdquo; 220.  That&rsquo;s like center size these days excepting a few guys.</p>

      <label for="llg5l2v" class="commentText"><p>Agree with Giannis feasting on small lineups. However, thats just because Giannis is exceptionally switchable to the perimeter. Putting him as center or PF cancels any PnR or switches and allows them not to play much of the dreaded drop coverage.

      <label for="llgggqi" class="commentText"><p>I was talking about defense when I said nimble. He cant guard the PnR and the switches unlike Giannis so he will be a weak point in the defensive end. I agree he will find ways to score in the modern era. But will his offensive production be enough to keep him in the game if he gets exposed on switches and PnR? That, I am skeptical with.</p>

<p>The reason I wanted to bring up Giannis&rsquo; points is that he makes them differently from Shaq who gets the ball in the paint then 1-2 dribble. Giannis drives to the basket. Embiid might be closer. But Embiid has a respectable three pointer and a really good middy.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s defense. If he was as heavy as he was on the Lakers(which he wouldn&rsquo;t be, he&rsquo;d adapt and slim down), he&rsquo;d get switched onto every single play on defense. Steph, Luka and a load of other players would have a layup or open 3 against Shaq every single time.</p>

<p>Just look at the issues Gobert has on the switch at the perimeter in the playoffs when they decide to go at him. Shaq would have those same issues but magnified x2.</p>

<p>Shaq is very mobile and athletic for his size but he&rsquo;s still way too heavy to play defense in today&rsquo;s NBA. He would be 30kgs lighter if he played today.</p>

<p>Steph at 40% 3 would still be lower than Shaq at 100% 2s. Like dude would absolute feast in the paint which he already did in a Center era.</p>

<p>The era Shaq played in catered towards his strengths. You think Shaq played in the era of centers was because there was an overabundance of them when he played? No, centers feasted the way they did because the rules and the way the game was played catered towards their strengths. The zone defense rule changes that happened in 2002 or whenever it was was a big reason we moved away from the center era, but it took a couple of years for teams to adapt.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t see those type of centers today because the game changed. They have to be more mobile. The 3p shot changed everything. The game was much slower during the center era as well.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying Shaq wouldn&rsquo;t be amazing but I do think he played in the right place in history to optimise his strengths. He&rsquo;d be a completely different player if he was drafted today.</p>

<p>If you have as dominant force as Shaq, game changes back to &ldquo;stop the Shaq era&rdquo;. No one is going to care about 3 point shot when you have 90% chance of scoring a 2 points + a foul.</p>

<p>3pt shot didn&rsquo;t change things as much as people think. It was league wide lack of efficient centers that changed game to 3pt shooting. Also with rise of Curry and Klay Thompson made it a 3pt era. As soon as you have a league full of inefficient 3pt chuckers the era will go back to centers dominance. The reduction of shot clock from offensive rebound from 24 to 14 sec sped up the league.</p>

<p>As you can see big guys won last 6 MVPs. And there is no sign of next Curry or James Harden in the league, the NBA will go back to center dominance sooner than people think.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t think so. You really think it was just a coincidence we saw so many dominant big man centers during the center ara, while not seeing them today? you talk like it was just Shaq that was dominating, there was a multitude of others as well, even before Shaq came into the league.</p>

<p>The NBA didn&rsquo;t like the meta of centers banging down low. They wanted high flying guards like MJ to dominate the league, so they changed the rules to promote that. Getting rid of zone defense rules was a big step in that direction which led to the era we are in right now. Hand checking too promotes agile back court players.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to think that we don&rsquo;t have any big men centers banging down low in today&rsquo;s game because they aren&rsquo;t out there.</p>

<p>That is literally the case, as the 3 best players in the league are exactly that and all 3 feast on the inside.</p>

<p>The center talent was dying before they made Zone rule or handchecking changes. Go look at Shaq&rsquo;s competition for 1st team center in 1993-97, then look at it for 01-05.</p>

<p>Not to mention, the 08-10 Lakers dominated like they did, because of&hellip; their massive post up bigs + Kobe.</p>

<p>This era exists now largely because of coaching innovations anyway. Go watch a mid-late 80s game, where they had no zone, rules for doubling and handchecking. They had high flying wings dominating everything. Talent defines the type of teams we get.</p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t. They play a completely different game than how Shaq and the centers of the 90&rsquo;s played. They are much lighter. Embiid is the same height as Shaq but 30kgs lighter. He plays face up like a guard. Jokic is a point center and Giannis is much much lighter than Shaq was.</p>

<p>They are the new age and Shaq would slim down to fit the current NBA, just like the centers of today. That&rsquo;s my point.</p>

<p>Hardly, the 3 best players of right now are inside heavy 7 foot centers. We just had very little to no talented bigs for a long time after Heat won in 06.</p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;re back to having high volume post up bigs. Because we actually have that talent now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying Shaq wouldn&rsquo;t be amazing but I do think he played in the right place in history to optimise his strengths.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shaq came into a fast paced offensive league and dominated it the same as he did when it bogged down to a snail pace. Then it sped back up again&hellip; and guess what, that is by far Shaq&rsquo;s best season after he fucked up his foot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The game was much slower during the center era as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The center era was 50s-90s and we have yet to reach the pace of the 80s. It&rsquo;s only matched the 90s recently.</p>

<p>Like every small ball team since 09, gets feasted on by any team with size. It&rsquo;s great for versatility, until you come across players who feast on the small lineups. Great example of this was AD and Bron in 2020 and 2023.</p>

<p>Shaq&rsquo;s biggest adaption would not being to get as many slow back to the basket scoring possessions. But with the amount of space and lack of size, he wouldn&rsquo;t need them. He wouldn&rsquo;t be much different at all, they&rsquo;d just use less possessions on post ups.</p>

      <label for="llgkbvv" class="commentText"><p>Yep, Shaq did a jump stop, that would have been a blocking foul the way the defender was standing. But the refs didn&rsquo;t call these kinds of ticky tack fouls for Shaq.</p>

<p>He used to complain about how sore he was game after game because they only call hard contact on him because of his size. Like if you&rsquo;re hitting hard enough to hurt a 7 foot 300lb human being you are probably doing what would be a flagrant foul to a guard.</p>

      <label for="llgp962" class="commentText"><p>I think if AC would have had his feet set, and flopped back, maybe yeah. Shaq did get offensive fouls called on him sometimes even back then, he&rsquo;s a tough guy to call being as powerful and aggressive as he was. Today&rsquo;s closest styles being Giannis and Zion, and both play with similar aggression and physicality (to an extent) but driving down hill instead of in the post. Sometimes they get offensive fouls called on them, but generally not.</p>

      <label for="llh2p7p" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not an offensive foul. It&rsquo;s a defensive foul.</p>

<p>Defender&rsquo;s feet are moving with Shaq (i.e. he is making small steps to follow Shaq). That counts as not establishing a position in time, same as if they had stepped in front of Shaq at the last second, only here it&rsquo;s from the back.</p>

<p>For this to be an offensive foul, the defender should stay with their feet planted, usually with arms up in the air, clearly establishing a defensive position. The attacker is supposed to make an effort to avoid the contact with the defender by going around the defender (though if contact does occurs, it&rsquo;s up to the referee) but if they purposefully make contact, like Shaq is doing in the video, it would then be called an offensive foul.</p>
