<p>He tweeted “Since when does Nike care about ethics?” when they dropped Kyrie over the anti semitic shit.</p>

<p>He’s also worn Nikes in game with the swoosh intentionally covered up.</p>

<p>There’s a difference between “oh steph isnt signed with nike” and “oh jaylen brown has publicly criticized nike on multiple occasions”</p>

<p>I don’t care anyway or think he’s a good enough player for us to say that it was a snub. But just saying that this argument is missing the point. The signing with Nike part would be him squashing his “beef” with them.</p>

      <label for="lt5dv9e" class="commentText"><p>You asked for evidence, I’m surprised no one provided it from what I can see.  But for everyone aware, many consider him a genius (more on that at the end).</p>

<p>High school and college
Brown was at the top of his high school class and attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he took graduate classes as a freshman. He also played on the varsity chess team and learned multiple languages, including Spanish.</p>

<p>Brown became the youngest person to lecture at Harvard, and he was an MIT Media Lab Fellow, which offered him a NASA internship. He also became the NBA PA’s youngest vice president at age 22.</p>

<p>Brown is an avid chess player, and his Elo rating on Chess.com is 1275. He also plays multiple instruments, including the guitar and piano.</p>

<p>Brown is a Director’s Fellow at the MIT Media Lab, where he works to create opportunities for marginalized youth.</p>

<p>To be fair, I don’t think this qualifies him as a genius. I think his high school GPA was normal, but he did have a 95 percentile SAT score.  I would say he a highly intelligent individual that stand out for his intelligence in his profession.</p>

      <label for="lt5f048" class="commentText"><p>Not that I particularly care about this, but none of this is indicative of some crazy intelligence. Yes he took grad classes but he didn&rsquo;t need to pass them, anyone can sit in a class, not have to listen and then brag about it after. His chess rating is almost exactly average (chess.com starts you at 1200).  His &ldquo;lecture&rdquo; was one of the typical puff pieces universities give athletes/famous people (same way they give out honorary doctorates), same with his Director&rsquo;s Fellow role and NASA internship. As for him playing guitar/piano and learning languages, I can&rsquo;t say for sure about the instruments but I would like to see him speak &ldquo;multiple other languages&rdquo; and actually conduct interviews in them.</p>

<p>He has a very good track record of making himself out to be smarter than he actually is, and using it to justify his nonsense political beliefs.</p>

<p>Because <em>he didn&rsquo;t take the class</em>.  He audited it.</p>

<p>It really shows, especially in this sub, how little people know about college because they either haven&rsquo;t been or are too young.</p>

      <label for="lt5z763" class="commentText"><p>Exactly this. He comes off as unauthentic, being too out there with his apparent “interests” outside of basketball which is mentioned on his own website and other random paid for pieces. It’s all part of his PR. I don’t see how any of the stuff anyone can find on him makes him smart. He’s not a dummy but not a genius just a normal dude with connections and puff pieces. If you look at shaq for instance, he does a lot outside of basketball, but never trying to tell you he is some high intellectual, or at least I don’t feel like that’s what he is doing, even though he has a phd. He’s pretty out there too while not being very blatant, there’s a level of humbleness with shaq’s activities like he is genuinely trying to get an education.</p>

Same as Kyrie, really; went to a great school for 2 semesters, somehow managed to conflate ego with intellect, and now has morons regularly cite “he went to college” to justify their view of him as “enlightened” while not recognizing a significant amount of what they say publicly is ego-driven pseudointellectual bullshit</p>

<p>Well there&rsquo;s your problem lol.</p>

<p>At least it&rsquo;s gotten better than last offseason. There were people genuinely convinced Brown was a below average on-ball scorer <strong>and</strong> a below average off-ball scorer.</p>

<p>People had this image of a ball dominant player who couldn&rsquo;t beat anyone off the dribble&hellip;Meanwhile, he averaged 27ppg.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure where people thought all those points were coming from.</p>

<p>Just pointing out that in the NBA season, White had more touches and had the ball longer per touch than Jaylen Brown. Brown was 93rd in touches in the NBA last year, and 101st in seconds per touch.  He was like the 4th ball handler on the Celtics.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because he was often the point guard. He often brought the ball up the court, which takes 4-8 seconds.</p>

      <label for="lt4k7o1" class="commentText"><p>I think he’s merging two separate topics into one topic which is nonsensical. Again I’m thinking as to what JB wants to say which is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Kids should just learn to play bball the right way with good fundamentals as opposed to being pushed towards playing in all those team travel sports and focus on winning but perhaps not in a good developmental way.</p></li>

<li><p>The shoe and apparel industry as such a grasp on the youth that forces kids to pick between separate apparel companies which mimics our (the United States) political divide into picking sides (ie republican vs democrats).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Again I’m reiterating that I think this is what JB is trying to get at but he just wasn’t very eloquent about it.</p>

<p>Or ya know, Tyrese who is Puma or Ant who is Adidas.</p>

<p>Jaylen is not being reasonable here. He&rsquo;s just mad that Derrick White, who can play a role without the ball, was on the team and he, a ball dominant player in a position that they didn&rsquo;t need, was not.</p>

<p>Like be for real, 2024 team USA didn&rsquo;t even play Taytum, a nike athlete. Once you have Lebron, KD and Steph. The need for a ball dominant guard or wing drops dramatically.</p>

Bro not only is coming up with some conspiracy but he clearly feels entitled and better than at least one person on the roster and that&rsquo;s probably not the vibe I&rsquo;m trying to create especially when that would very likely mean cutting someone that has been invested in team USA and loyal for years since they&rsquo;re usually not the mega superstars on the team outside of KD. All this dude is gonna do is fuck up the vibe talking like this. Ain&rsquo;t like the team has no talent and needs to be rescued by Jaylen</p>

<p>He would&rsquo;ve just actually blacklisted himself from ever playing for team USA again if they&rsquo;ve got any self respect can&rsquo;t bow down and invite after this shit</p>

<p>When I saw he was launching a charity to help inner city kids I thought his publicist must’ve gotten ahold of him or he hired one with the big contract and they were getting to work on his image rehabilitation after a disasterclass this summer about the Olympics and the Kyrie Irving shenanigans.</p>

<p>Guess I was wrong lol. The Finals MVP is going to have this dude thinking he’s entitled to basketball royalty the rest of his career. Clown behavior.</p>

      <label for="lt4opdg" class="commentText"><p>Always embarrassing when people who are the faces of a multinational corporation worth billions thriving specifically because of the ways they’re beholden to large capitalist entities act as if they’re exempt from those entities. My guy you get paid 60 million a year specifically because of the ways that basketball is beholden to corporations, much like Kyrie you don’t get to pretend to be exempt from that while still cashing those checks</p>

      <label for="lt4j8u7" class="commentText"><p>That’s the thing man. Haliburton got basically no minutes but everyone around the team basically said he’s going to be key to the team next go around. He didn’t make a stink about his playing time, he just did whatever the team asked of him. He was more concerned about the team’s success than getting his moment. If Brown could just keep his mouth shut he’d have a realistic chance at 2028 with the talent going out of the league at his position. But he just keeps talking and at some point team USA is not going to want the distraction of him being on the team.</p>

<p>Oh and the dude they’ve already basically committed to using next Olympics? Puma.</p>

Nike is spending money to influence reddit opinion on Jalen Brown? The only way people could think the roster was better as it was than with JB is if they&rsquo;re being paid to say it?</p>

<p>I have no idea if Nike really influences the process but there are multiple people who don&rsquo;t wear Nike on that team. So clearly it&rsquo;s not absolute. Who does this benefit? Airing conspiracy idiocy about sneakers and Olympic team selection is going to achieve what? Other than piss off people. Plus of course his teammate was chosen above him, so really nice to imply he only went because of his shoe sponsors.</p>

<p>Steph Curry- Under Armour</p>

<p>Embiid - sketchers</p>

<p>Ant - Adidas</p>

<p>Kawhi** - New Balance</p>

<p>66% of nba players wear Nike
Next is adidas with 10%.
Hell, even Grant Hill played primarily in Fila shoes.</p>

<p>Jaylen Brown is just taking out of his ass as per usual.  Derrick white/jrue aren&rsquo;t better players than JB, but were a much better fit for team usa since they don&rsquo;t need touches to be effective.  Everyone else on the team outside of Haliburton (who was happy riding the bench) are just better players than JB.  The last thing team usa needed was an iso wing scorer.  They already had KD, Ant, Tatum to do that.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the same with Kyrie complaining about tryouts - as if 4 years of watching these dudes play in the nba isn&rsquo;t enough data to pick a roster.</p>
