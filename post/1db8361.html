No shit he had a good game if he was like Jerami Grant but people call him a superstar and he shot like 35% and had more turnovers than assists. It’s not that people don’t know basketball it’s that every number one option in the league gets more attention when they drive in.</p>

If your opinion of him would be higher if he just started jacking up shots trying to get points you just don&rsquo;t know ball.</p>

<p>Yes, he was getting doubled a lot, and usually made the right reads and our team got into the swing-swing action to get open looks. But he also shot poorly and had a ton of turnovers. Thankfully, he&rsquo;s almost always elite on defense and a good playmaker.</p>

<p>But idk why so many Tatum-stans are so against JT being criticized even a bit for having a subpar game. He just dropped a 30/10/6 average in the ECF. We know what this dude is capable of.</p>

<p>He had a subpar game, and it&rsquo;s fine. He&rsquo;ll bounce back. He&rsquo;s our superstar and he&rsquo;ll make the right adjustments.</p>

<p>For Tatum, his role is different than superstars on other teams. He doesn’t need to drop 30-40 and completely carry the offensive load. It’s not a bad thing he’s doing only what’s required of him.</p>

<p>His defensive game was fantastic, however&ndash;he was asked to do quite a lot at various times, and did it all well. The fact that he could guard Kyrie and Luka well while also fighting the Mav&rsquo;s bigs for rebounds was a big part of slowing the Mavs down. The Mavs are used to outmuscling small teams and picking apart slow teams; Tatum&rsquo;s on a short list of people who can competently defend everyone on the Mavs at what they do best. There&rsquo;s no question that his overall contribution was significantly positive.</p>

<p>Hopefully he and the Celtics come out locked in for game 2 and get another win.</p>

<p>With 3 more wins, I sincerely don&rsquo;t care how they play, they will be champions.</p>

They definitely collapse on him more than Brown in game 1. Maybe you argue his handling isn’t as good so they collapse but Tatum is more crafty than Brown and is more deadly when he gets to the elbow.</p>

      <label for="l7pg3pw" class="commentText"><p>Tatum is obviously good but this is just what the Mavs defense does. It looked the same vs all 3 of their Western opponents too. They collapse hard on anyone driving into the paint and shade off the weak side to help. This isn&rsquo;t a Tatum-specific strategy.</p>

      <label for="l7pu0jm" class="commentText"><p>The video preemptively addressed this reply. He pointed out that helping off of the shooters from previous series was an obvious decision due to personnel and is therefore apples-oranges compared to Game 1. He emphasized the fact that Porzingis had just completed a quarter where he looked like best player on the planet and defenders were <em>still</em> sagging toward Tatum.</p>

      <label for="l7puggh" class="commentText"><p>I just don&rsquo;t think the Mavs would know how to run any other defense? They can&rsquo;t exactly afford to reinvent their scheme at this point and they&rsquo;ve only been playing together since the ASB basically.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s fairly obvious it&rsquo;s a losing strategy vs Boston and they&rsquo;d need a combination of Luka+Kyrie Heroic <em>and</em> Boston shooting like shit, I just think they&rsquo;d run it no matter what because it&rsquo;s all they&rsquo;ve done. Their defense is like a pseudo-zone lol</p>

I&rsquo;ve seen plenty of shading; I haven&rsquo;t often seen the weak-side defender &ldquo;shade&rdquo; all the way to the other side of the paint, nor is the behind-the-line blitz when the double is coming off an elite shooter.</p>

      <label for="l7py6bs" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s just the same thing they were doing when it was a worse/non-shooting threat, it just seems a lot more egregious when it <em>is</em> a shooting threat. I just don&rsquo;t think they have any way to make adjustments to their defensive strategy. They haven&rsquo;t played together that long and their personnel doesn&rsquo;t really allow them a good perimeter defense if all 5 can shoot.</p>

<p>OKC should&rsquo;ve been able to punish it too, they just bricked their open looks in a way Boston won&rsquo;t/didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>LAC could&rsquo;ve punished it if Kawhi was healthy.</p>

      <label for="l7pfbq8" class="commentText"><p>And this is why Celtics fans get so “defensive” when people say Tatum isn’t our star. It’s really not up for debate, Brown is a fantastic 1b/2 who can take over but Tatum is the one consistently breaking defenses and making them adjust to him.</p>

<p>We should acknowledge he didn’t play great yesterday, but he also was not bad/holding the team back.</p>

      <label for="l7pu3ia" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s Kidd&rsquo;s plan. Win or lose he wanted Tatum to statistically have a quiet game. He&rsquo;s now planting seeds in the media about Brown being better hoping to spur Tatum to hero ball.</p>

<p>His defence is going to give Tatum a bit more and try keep the other guys out of it next game like Boston did with Luka</p>

<p>Gravity is about helping off their guy when the player doesn’t even have the ball (Steph Curry). The ball IS the gravity in this situation</p>
