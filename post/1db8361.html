No shit he had a good game if he was like Jerami Grant but people call him a superstar and he shot like 35% and had more turnovers than assists. It’s not that people don’t know basketball it’s that every number one option in the league gets more attention when they drive in.</p>

<p>Jerami Grant doesn&rsquo;t draw 2+ defenders, let alone <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>, so your point is moot.</p>

<p>He doesn’t have to force shit like other superstars do because he’s got 4 guys around him who can shoot it that are being left wide open simply because he’s on the floor. You’re punishing him for making the right decisions.</p>

<p>You can’t honestly expect him to ignore the winning play in order to get his individual stats. But even if he did that you’d still probably hate on him for being a selfish stat padder</p>

<p>Yes, he was getting doubled a lot, and usually made the right reads and our team got into the swing-swing action to get open looks. But he also shot poorly and had a ton of turnovers. Thankfully, he&rsquo;s almost always elite on defense and a good playmaker.</p>

<p>But idk why so many Tatum-stans are so against JT being criticized even a bit for having a subpar game. He just dropped a 30/10/6 average in the ECF. We know what this dude is capable of.</p>

<p>He had a subpar game, and it&rsquo;s fine. He&rsquo;ll bounce back. He&rsquo;s our superstar and he&rsquo;ll make the right adjustments.</p>

<p>But his shot is also volatile, and he&rsquo;s also had some bad games. But generally he&rsquo;s always a very good defender and a good playmaker, but his decision making at times in the past has been iffy. He&rsquo;s been much better this year with making the right reads out of double teams and complaining to refs less.</p>

<p>2022 Finals especially were by far his worst, and he had a hurt wrist ofc.</p>

Casual fans just look at the box score, see an off shooting night, and declare it a bad game. But he does all the little superstar things to win games and he usually plays great even when the shot isn’t falling.</p>

      <label for="l7ptg99" class="commentText"><p>His offensive game was bad; you can make an argument for his net contribution being positive based on the opportunities he opened for his teammates, but at the very least it was nothing close to what is expected from him.</p>

<p>His defensive game was fantastic, however&ndash;he was asked to do quite a lot at various times, and did it all well. The fact that he could guard Kyrie and Luka well while also fighting the Mav&rsquo;s bigs for rebounds was a big part of slowing the Mavs down. The Mavs are used to outmuscling small teams and picking apart slow teams; Tatum&rsquo;s on a short list of people who can competently defend everyone on the Mavs at what they do best. There&rsquo;s no question that his overall contribution was significantly positive.</p>

<p>Hopefully he and the Celtics come out locked in for game 2 and get another win.</p>

<p>With 3 more wins, I sincerely don&rsquo;t care how they play, they will be champions.</p>

<p>So he forced 1 TO. No plural. Also, only on him for 2 minutes total. So not sure Luka gets any credit for that.</p>

<p>And I wasn’t speaking in that specific game. I was saying in general, Luka’s below average D gets a pass because he is an above average scorer. This is true for a lot of players. I am saying for that to be true the opposite must be true. An above average defender gets a pass on having average offense.</p>

<p>I also do not think Tatum is average on either side of the ball.</p>

They definitely collapse on him more than Brown in game 1. Maybe you argue his handling isn’t as good so they collapse but Tatum is more crafty than Brown and is more deadly when he gets to the elbow.</p>

I just don&rsquo;t think they have any way to make adjustments to their defensive strategy. They haven&rsquo;t played together that long and their personnel doesn&rsquo;t really allow them a good perimeter defense if all 5 can shoot.</p>

<p>OKC should&rsquo;ve been able to punish it too, they just bricked their open looks in a way Boston won&rsquo;t/didn&rsquo;t.</p>

      <label for="l7pows6" class="commentText"><p>You’re telling me when a team’s best player drives to the hoop people will help off their guy? The <em>gravity</em>.</p>

<p>Gravity is about helping off their guy when the player doesn’t even have the ball (Steph Curry). The ball IS the gravity in this situation</p>
