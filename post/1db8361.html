No shit he had a good game if he was like Jerami Grant but people call him a superstar and he shot like 35% and had more turnovers than assists. It’s not that people don’t know basketball it’s that every number one option in the league gets more attention when they drive in.</p>

<p>He doesn’t have to force shit like other superstars do because he’s got 4 guys around him who can shoot it that are being left wide open simply because he’s on the floor. You’re punishing him for making the right decisions.</p>

<p>You can’t honestly expect him to ignore the winning play in order to get his individual stats. But even if he did that you’d still probably hate on him for being a selfish stat padder</p>

<p>Yes, he was getting doubled a lot, and usually made the right reads and our team got into the swing-swing action to get open looks. But he also shot poorly and had a ton of turnovers. Thankfully, he&rsquo;s almost always elite on defense and a good playmaker.</p>

<p>But idk why so many Tatum-stans are so against JT being criticized even a bit for having a subpar game. He just dropped a 30/10/6 average in the ECF. We know what this dude is capable of.</p>

<p>He had a subpar game, and it&rsquo;s fine. He&rsquo;ll bounce back. He&rsquo;s our superstar and he&rsquo;ll make the right adjustments.</p>

      <label for="l7qbqkb" class="commentText"><p>People are very willing to admit when he has great games lol what are you talking about. 50 burger in Game 7 last year vs Philly, 46 on the road in Milwaukee in 2022, and more. He&rsquo;s had many, many great playoff games.</p>

<p>But his shot is also volatile, and he&rsquo;s also had some bad games. But generally he&rsquo;s always a very good defender and a good playmaker, but his decision making at times in the past has been iffy. He&rsquo;s been much better this year with making the right reads out of double teams and complaining to refs less.</p>

<p>2022 Finals especially were by far his worst, and he had a hurt wrist ofc.</p>

<p>He had shit game in many ways, but made it up with good defense and good playmaking.</p>

<p>But <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> shooting and 6 turnovers is never a good game FFS&hellip;. It was subpar game for a 1st All NBA team player. Period.</p>

<p>Wanna know what a &lsquo;great game&rsquo; is? Tatum droping 51/13/5 in Game 7 last year, or 50/7/2 in 2021 vs Nets with JB/Timelord hurt, <sup>46</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub> on the road in Game 6 in Milwaukee in elimination game in 2022, 36/10/8 vs Pacers this year, etc&hellip;.</p>

<p>People are real fuckin silly here sometimes.</p>

      <label for="l7ru4u1" class="commentText"><p>Can be said for a lot of his games tbh.</p>

<p>Everyone talks about sacrifices in terms of giving up shots/possessions (which everyone on our team has done this season), but sacrifice can also include tanking your own efficiency for the sake of the team.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For example, Kevin Durant famously won&rsquo;t take half court heaves at the end of quarters because he doesn&rsquo;t want the miss on his stat sheet. That&rsquo;s a 3PT shot that even Ben Simmons would attempt.</p></li>

<li><p>Whereas Marcus Smart&rsquo;s 3P% was always a little lower than it should have been because he was the guy willing to take the shot in a broken down possession where there&rsquo;s only 2-3 seconds left on the shot clock.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes sacrifice is taking a bad shot for the sake of the team.</p>

<p>Tatum&rsquo;s a lot more willing to make sacrifices than people realise.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/1cmwhkk/daily_discussion_thread_may_08_2024/l35b78f/?context=3" target="_blank">I broke it down properley here, but G1 against Cleveland is a really good example. He missed a shot on 11 possession, 10 of those possessions involved us having an above average offensive-rebounding opportunity.</a></p>

<p>Cleveland was missing their primary rebounder (Jarrett Allen) and Luke Kornet was playing solid minutes for Boston because of Porzingis&rsquo; injury. There&rsquo;s quite a few possessions where he&rsquo;s just pulling guys out of the paint so 7&rsquo;ft Kornet can secure the offensive rebounding position.</p>

<p>A low percentage shot leading to a high percentage putback looks bad on Tatum&rsquo;s stat sheet but it&rsquo;s a good outcome for the team.</p>

<p>For Tatum, his role is different than superstars on other teams. He doesn’t need to drop 30-40 and completely carry the offensive load. It’s not a bad thing he’s doing only what’s required of him.</p>

<p>So he forced 1 TO. No plural. Also, only on him for 2 minutes total. So not sure Luka gets any credit for that.</p>

<p>And I wasn’t speaking in that specific game. I was saying in general, Luka’s below average D gets a pass because he is an above average scorer. This is true for a lot of players. I am saying for that to be true the opposite must be true. An above average defender gets a pass on having average offense.</p>

<p>I also do not think Tatum is average on either side of the ball.</p>

      <label for="l7ptg99" class="commentText"><p>His offensive game was bad; you can make an argument for his net contribution being positive based on the opportunities he opened for his teammates, but at the very least it was nothing close to what is expected from him.</p>

<p>His defensive game was fantastic, however&ndash;he was asked to do quite a lot at various times, and did it all well. The fact that he could guard Kyrie and Luka well while also fighting the Mav&rsquo;s bigs for rebounds was a big part of slowing the Mavs down. The Mavs are used to outmuscling small teams and picking apart slow teams; Tatum&rsquo;s on a short list of people who can competently defend everyone on the Mavs at what they do best. There&rsquo;s no question that his overall contribution was significantly positive.</p>

      <label for="l7pd3b0" class="commentText"><p>Tatum is what makes their small ball game work. He plays the 4, at rare times, to the 5. He does an extremely good job at it. They definitely collapse on him more than Brown in game 1. Maybe you argue his handling isn’t as good so they collapse but Tatum is more crafty than Brown and is more deadly when he gets to the elbow.</p>

<p>His defence is going to give Tatum a bit more and try keep the other guys out of it next game like Boston did with Luka</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re main defensive strategy doesn&rsquo;t work I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s a complicated change up. A lot of people expected that they might rely heavily on Boston missing shots to defend how they&rsquo;re used to. Which also might not work, and if it doesn&rsquo;t? What&rsquo;s the change up? Letting their traditional big men guard 1 on 1 vs switches no help? Let Luka guard Jaylen Brown without help? Help is crucial and it looks egregious against a team with perfect floor spacing.</p>

They haven&rsquo;t played together that long and their personnel doesn&rsquo;t really allow them a good perimeter defense if all 5 can shoot.</p>

<p>OKC should&rsquo;ve been able to punish it too, they just bricked their open looks in a way Boston won&rsquo;t/didn&rsquo;t.</p>
