EVEN IF HARDEN ONLY HAD A BEHIND THE BACK MOVE , A BETWEEN THE LEG CROSS and A LEFT TO RIGHT CROSS HE WOULD STILL SCORE 50 POINTS WITH 3 MOVES. hes still a better shooter than the entire 70s combined, stronger than all of those guards too. holy shit you people are so delusional it hurts. go watch some fuckin 70s basketball cuz your takes sound like you never watched any tape from them.</p>

West only played 31 games in the last year of his career before his knee blew up, and that was on the last year of his career! Imagine if they counted steals when he was youngish.</p>

<p>Edit: he had 81 steals in 31 games on the last season of his career. Fucking insane. Thanks to the guy below me for correcting me.</p>

<p>So he wouldn&rsquo;t have to hit 10 extra three point shots. The quality of the shots he was taking would have increased because of the spacing so his fg% and ts% would have taken huge jumps. That alone would have added points as well as from the increased number of 3pm.</p>

      <label for="l89uqbs" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t know about that, but he easily could have. What a lot of people don&rsquo;t know about West was despite being 6&rsquo;<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub>&rsquo;3 he had a 6&rsquo;<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub>&rsquo;10 wingspan and was a tenacious defender, especially adept at picking pockets on the perimeter. In fact, he was such a good defender that he made the all defensive team 5 times, despite the award not being introduced until he was 31. He was no athletic slouch either, with his wingspan he could have easily dunked, he could jump and touch like halfway up the backboard.</p>

<p>MJ as far as I know idolized David Thompson and modeled his game after him, but he very well could have watched some West as well. They have a similar midrange game, though I would say West was more crafty like Bird or Rick Barry than hitting as many athletic shots as Jordan. West was definitely a more pure shooter, especially from the outside.</p>

<p>Literally no one has DWade above Kobe all-time. Kobe is regularly ranked around 8-12 overall while DWade is around top 25. West and DWade are pretty similarly ranked, but because West also spent a decent chunk of time at point guard the 3rd best SG is usually given to DWade.</p>

He also is an actual leader and able to improve teammates not just get super stacked teams together and that&rsquo;s the only way they win the chip. Even though Kobe has more all D selections that is just from the media glazing him, like a lot of people that didn&rsquo;t grow up and actually watch him play do now, as wade was a better defender.</p>

<p>People downvoting the comment I&rsquo;m replying to, would you legitimately put west above Kobe all time? Not to be a dick but that has to be death bias. After Kobe died people were putting him above LeBron despite rarely even having him top 10 before that. Kobe is 100% above Jerry West on an all-time list</p>

      <label for="l8bpnpk" class="commentText"><p>I think it depends on what you prioritize. Like how you could say Magic objectively had a greater career than Bird but Bird was arguably the better overall player, West was arguably a better player than Kobe despite having a much less successful career. Kobe was fortunate to be drafted onto a dynasty in an era where the Spurs were the only serious competition and they didn’t start reaching their apex until later in his (and more importantly Shaq’s) career. West had to compete against an incredibly stacked squad with no free agency to break them up yet. But he was probably the best individual player in like half the finals he played in despite the losses. Everything Kobe was great at (defense, intensity, shooting, clutch factor, underrated playmaking and rebounding for his size) Jerry had as well, and was often even better. West had higher career averages in basically every major stat except Free throw shooting and that’s with some of those stats only being counted in his last years in the league, so not factoring in his prime. It’s also without a three point line which West would have thrived with. Kobe had better handles for sure but he also didn’t have the kind of insanely strict rules for dribbling they had in the 60s, though I’m still giving that nod to him regardless.</p>

      <label for="l8brro4" class="commentText"><p>This is an incredibly respectable answer.</p>

<p>But one thing I will double down on is that I&rsquo;ve rarely (if ever) heard people take Jerry West over Kobe all time. You brought up nothing but great points and I don&rsquo;t disagree with your case at all. But I feel like death bias is a legitimate thing here. I&rsquo;ll admit that prior to today I never realized how good of a defender West was, and death bias goes along with that as well because I never would have known without that happening so maybe I&rsquo;m just being a hypocrite.</p>

<p>One question I have is about Jerry West&rsquo;s range. I keep seeing that he was a deep shooter before the 3 point line exists, but is there any statistic or anything that shows how many 3s he actually would have hit? Not that this would take much away from your case at all, but is there any way of knowing if he actually hit a ton of shots from 3pt range and not just deep 2s?</p>

      <label for="l8c980l" class="commentText"><p>I’ve had this opinion for years, his death has nothing to do with my feeling here. I would make the point that few of the people picking Kobe over West all time actually watched West play, not that I did either tbf. But I think people tend to be biased towards players they watched. It’s the same reason you see many people today picking Curry over Kobe and West despite him only really being noticeably better in one category and much worse in most others.</p>

<p>I’m not going to tell anyone they’re wrong for having Kobe higher all time, I think with the resume he has the amount of success speaks for itself, but I do think that as an individual you could very reasonably make the argument that West might have been better. While Kobe has 5 rings and West only 1 I’d say that West was actually the best player in a finals series twice as many times as Kobe was. He just was playing against an absurdly well run and talented juggernaut year after year and his teammates frequently choked when they were on the cusp of victory. West consistently played as hard as he could til the very end, it’s difficult to really mark any of those losses against him. In many ways he was an even better version of everything Kobe was known for (better shooter, arguably better defender, more clutch, even more ridiculously competitive) but thanks in no small part to West himself, Kobe got to have the best team around him much more of his career than West did.</p>

<p>MJ, Kobe, Harden, West/Wade, West/Wade, AI</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s probably my list. I can&rsquo;t really decide between West and Wade. Between Harden, West, and AI they could probably fit into a PG or SG list. More than likely West would end up on the PG list, but I&rsquo;ve seen both. AI and Harden almost always land on SG lists.</p>

<p>Must be something with white legendary guards drafted by the Lakers. Wilt looked human against Iowa State when it was led by Gary Thompson. In one game, Wilt was held to 12 points in a game his team won 58-57, but 18 days later, Wilt was held to just 17 points with Kansas losing 39-37. Gary Thompson himself was legendary:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>in the game that Wilt scored just 17, Gary scored 18.</p></li>

<li><p>Gary beat Wilt for Big 7 player of the year</p></li>

<li><p>Not only was he an All-American Basketball player, but he was an All-America shortstop who hit .311 as a senior and led ISU to a third-place finish in the College World Series</p></li>

<li><p>Kansas Coach Phoeg Allen said “Inch for inch, Gary Thompson is probably as good a player as the Big Seven has ever seen”</p></li>
</ul>

<p>He was drafted in 5th round, 35th overall pick by the then Minneapolis Lakers in 1957 but elected to play in the AAU League and never played in the NBA. Elgin Baylor was selected by the Lakers a year later, and Jerry West was drafted in 1960.</p>

      <label for="l8c4u82" class="commentText"><p>He was 34 in 68 but still MVP/All NBA level. I think game 4 or 5 whichever Lakers lost, he went <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>27</sub>, but then <sup>13</sup>&frasl;<sub>22</sub> in game 6. For his level, he had these odd games in the middle where he would go <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>21</sub>, or so. Not by modern standards, but the problem more or less on his high volume shooting in these guys and what would have been if West took, 4-5 more shots</p>

      <label for="l8b05ua" class="commentText"><p>Elgin had no left hand and had these weird moves that resulted in him taking a lot of awkward shots with his right hand. Playoff intensity was probably a thing back then too and usually affects players with more limited moves like Elgin. I really don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d fare well today unless he spent a lot of time learning to use the left. On the other hand Jerrys pull up jumper really stands the test of time because you watch him do it and it looks just like how players today do it.</p>

The bigger point I was making is that he was the best teammate of all time. He only cared about winning and every motivation he had was aimed at that result. Special player and a special guy.
Havlicek was incredible at that time. 68-74, he was among the best players on the planet. Sam Jones was also great, but that was it on that 69 team.</p>

<p>You mentioned 1969, but statistically speaking his 1966 series is also completely absurd, 34/6/5 on 59% TS in the 1960s is absolutely bonkers, league average TS% was 48%. I&rsquo;m not sure at what number 59% TS in 1966 translates to in 2024, but it&rsquo;s likely more or as efficient as any Finals MVP we have seen in the last decade.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d agree with you on Jordan, but I don&rsquo;t think he clears Bron. They&rsquo;ve played exactly the same number of finals games (55) and have the exact same W/L record (22-33).</p>

<p>West has him on points, but Bron has higher assist/rebound numbers.</p>

<p>This is a spicy take, but relative to his era I consider him better than Steph still. Just as efficient, but he did it with every rule working against him. Steph did it with every rule working for him.</p>

<p>Better rebounder, better passer(led the league in assists), significantly better defender(all-defense multiple times), bigger+more athletic, and a better playoff performer. Not his fault he ran into the Russell Celtics</p>

Lebron with the 28/10/8 over 55 games. Obviously, West&rsquo;s 30.5 over 55 with no 3pt line. MJ with the 33.6 ppg average in the finals.</p>

      <label for="l8bdea3" class="commentText"><p>One of my favorite things about running historical sims of the NBA (shout out basketball gm) is getting to experience the what if of &ldquo;what if Jerry West / Rick Barry / Pistol Pete had a three point line&rdquo; </p>

<p>Sure, adding the 3-point line is one of the biggest rule changes to hit any major sports league (and kinda crazy to think about trying to push it as a new idea). But the idea of rewarding these brilliant sharp shooters in an era of big men just makes sense. He was shooting the lines out from 20+ feet, imagine the rainy days he would&rsquo;ve had if he was incentivized to shoot more from distance.</p>
