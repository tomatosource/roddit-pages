      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fkdzuu/two_things_can_be_simultaneously_true_nikola/"><p>Two Things Can Be Simultaneously True: Nikola Jokić Has Never Had an Active All-Star Teammate Edition</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>As Nikola Jokić’s aspiring lover, I’m often found unabashedly discussing his greatness whenever possible. While doing so, a common refrain I turn to is  some version of the following: Nikola Jokić has never played with an active All-Star teammate. However, while this statement ironically lacks some important context of its own, I thought I’d reassure people of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Nikola Jokić has never played with an All-Star teammate ≠ Giannis Antetokounmpo was carried by Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday, the Warriors have always been Draymond Green’s team, and LeBron is a sloppy wine mum.</li>
</ol>

<p>Every NBA Championship is the result of decades of hard work and sacrifice. Yes, some teams are more talented than others, but Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Green, and Klay Thompson didn’t achieve anything just by wishing for it. Nor did Giannis Antetokounmpo, whose Championship-winning teammates had notable limitations of their own. Every NBA Championship is impressive; Jokić earning his without an All-Star teammate just happens to be one of the ways in which his is remarkable.</p>

<ol>
<li>Nikola Jokić has never played with an All-Star teammate ≠ Jamal Murray is a scrub, Aaron Gordon is a Jokić invention, and the rest of his teammates are essentially bipedal turds.</li>
</ol>

<p>No man, no matter how great, can win a ring alone. As Jokić himself likes to remind people, when the Denver Nuggets won the <sup>2022</sup>&frasl;<sub>23</sub> NBA Championship, they did so as a team. Aaron Gordon was exceptional, Michael Porter Jr. and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope consistently made timely contributions, Bruce Brown played so well that he earned a 2-year, $45 million contract, and bench players like Reggie Jackson, Jeff Green, and Christian Braun all played their parts. And then there’s Jamal Murray.</p>

<p>The <sup>2022</sup>&frasl;<sub>23</sub> NBA Playoffs saw Murray play like a man possessed, averaging 26.1 points, 7.1 assists, 5.7 rebounds, 1.5 steals, and 0.3 blocks on shooting splits of 47.3% from the field, 39.6% from three, and 92.6% from the free-throw line. Somehow, those numbers still fail to fully capture how remarkable he was. During those four series, forget the All-Star team—he played like an All-NBA First Team lock (from memory, I had him as the fourth-best performer in the playoffs on a per-game basis, behind only Jokić, Jimmy Butler, and Curry). Unfortunately, Murray has never been able to consistently deliver this level of excellence.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if it’s because most people (understandably) and media pundits (less understandably) don’t catch many Nuggets games, but there seems to be a weird disparity between the legend of Murray and the reality. Prior to suffering that devastating ACL injury in 2021, Murray was largely known by the wider basketball audience for his performances in the NBA Bubble. But for Denver, those performances were long-awaited, an oasis in what was previously thought to be a desert of frustrating inconsistency. Even now, his play outside of that <sup>2022</sup>&frasl;<sub>23</sub> playoff run has been defined by unpredictable ebbs and flows. In other words, there’s a reason Murray has never made an All-Star squad (and no, it’s not because the All-Star game is a popularity contest).</p>

<p>In short, no shit Jokić has had help in achieving greatness, every player has. But part of what makes Jokić so special is that he’s taken a team with such easily identifiable limitations and turned them into champions.</p>

<p>Well, thank you for coming to my TED Talk. Anyone else want to use this format to get something off their chest?</p>

I dont see Murray as successful on another team without Joker, but you plug in any second option and Joker would make it work. Joker is the greatest floor raiser in the NBA.</p>
