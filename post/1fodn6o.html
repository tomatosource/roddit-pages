</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>NBA fandom loves to talk about players that could&rsquo;ve achieved more if things were a little different. Easy examples would be players like Rose, Grant Hill, Penny, or even in some ways Bird and Magic.</p>

<p>I wanted to take it the opposite direction and talk about players that, if things were a little different, would&rsquo;ve achieved a lot less than what we got.  Think about it like poker: if you replayed a hand you won, you might not win it the second time.</p>

<p>To me the answer is hands down Steph Curry.  Here are some of the what ifs that led to the Warrior&rsquo;s dynasty.</p>

<ul>
<li>Knicks and Dell Curry were trying to get Steph on the Knicks, but the Warriors decided to draft Steph before the Knicks</li>
<li>Steph comes into the league with a reputation for ankle injuries, but after his first few seasons, doesn&rsquo;t have anymore ankle issues</li>
<li>Steph almost gets traded to the Bucks, but it doesn&rsquo;t happen due ankle concerns</li>
<li>Warriors draft Klay, but almost trade him.  Jerry West stops the trade by threatening to resign.</li>
<li>Warriors draft Draymond Green in the second round.  He eventually becomes a perfect complement to Steph and an all time great defender.</li>
<li>Starting PF David Lee gets hurt, giving Draymond a chance to show his skills.</li>
<li>Steve Kerr becomes head coach with no head coach experience.  His motion offense allows Curry to shoot tons of 3s and play more off ball.  Prior to Kerr, there were talks that Curry should model his game more on Steve Nash.</li>
<li>Curry&rsquo;s injury concerns cause his contract to be lower than his performance.  This, combined with a sudden salary cap increase, allows the Warriors to sign KD.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure you could make a similar list for other dynasties, but it&rsquo;s pretty amazing to me all the coincidences that allowed the Warriors dynasty to happen.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Steph would still be an amazing player if you change some of the events on that list, but I doubt alternative universe Steph has four rings.</p>

<p>Thoughts?  Any other good choices?  Is this good off-season discussion?</p>

As far as answering your question, MJ very easily could have ended his career in &lsquo;86, he had a foot injury and was NOT careful rehabbing it.  This was all in &ldquo;The Last Dance&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Oscar Robertson is an all time great who made himself look silly by saying its easy to defend Curry.</p>

<p>Shaq, another all time great, says teams don&rsquo;t need strategy, they should just pass it to the big man.</p>

      <label for="lop2p9r" class="commentText"><p>For me, Tim Duncan.</p>

<p>The fact the Spurs got the 1st pick (without even having the worst record), thanks to two big injuries the year before.</p>

<p>He got to play his rookie season along side one of the best big men during that era (David Robinson).</p>

<p>He got a coach that was perfect for his playstyle (Pops).</p>

<p>The insanity of how good their later picks would turn out: Ginobli at 57 and Parker at 28th (again just shows how good Pops was as a coach).</p>

<p>Imagine David not getting hurt and Tim goes anywhere else. He would have had a good career, but he would not have flourished.</p>

      <label for="lop4zaw" class="commentText"><p>Duncan&rsquo;s a great pick. </p>

<p>He also got lucky by having Defense first player Kawhi somehow develop an all time great jump shot.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, much like Robinson, Curry getting injured also allowed Warriors to get an early draft pick.  Luckily for the rest of the league, they didn&rsquo;t draft anyone on the level of Tim Duncan.</p>
