      <p>NBA fandom loves to talk about players that could&rsquo;ve achieved more if things were a little different. Easy examples would be players like Rose, Grant Hill, Penny, or even in some ways Bird and Magic.</p>

<p>I wanted to take it the opposite direction and talk about players that, if things were a little different, would&rsquo;ve achieved a lot less than what we got.  Think about it like poker: if you replayed a hand you won, you might not win it the second time.</p>

<p>To me the answer is hands down Steph Curry.  Here are some of the what ifs that led to the Warrior&rsquo;s dynasty.</p>

<ul>
<li>Knicks and Dell Curry were trying to get Steph on the Knicks, but the Warriors decided to draft Steph before the Knicks</li>
<li>Steph comes into the league with a reputation for ankle injuries, but after his first few seasons, doesn&rsquo;t have anymore ankle issues</li>
<li>Steph almost gets traded to the Bucks, but it doesn&rsquo;t happen due ankle concerns</li>
<li>Warriors draft Klay, but almost trade him.  Jerry West stops the trade by threatening to resign.</li>
<li>Warriors draft Draymond Green in the second round.  He eventually becomes a perfect complement to Steph and an all time great defender.</li>
<li>Starting PF David Lee gets hurt, giving Draymond a chance to show his skills.</li>
<li>Steve Kerr becomes head coach with no head coach experience.  His motion offense allows Curry to shoot tons of 3s and play more off ball.  Prior to Kerr, there were talks that Curry should model his game more on Steve Nash.</li>
<li>Curry&rsquo;s injury concerns cause his contract to be lower than his performance.  This, combined with a sudden salary cap increase, allows the Warriors to sign KD.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure you could make a similar list for other dynasties, but it&rsquo;s pretty amazing to me all the coincidences that allowed the Warriors dynasty to happen.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Steph would still be an amazing player if you change some of the events on that list, but I doubt alternative universe Steph has four rings.</p>

<p>Thoughts?  Any other good choices?  Is this good off-season discussion?</p>
