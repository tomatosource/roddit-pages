</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>NBA fandom loves to talk about players that could&rsquo;ve achieved more if things were a little different. Easy examples would be players like Rose, Grant Hill, Penny, or even in some ways Bird and Magic.</p>

<p>I wanted to take it the opposite direction and talk about players that, if things were a little different, would&rsquo;ve achieved a lot less than what we got.  Think about it like poker: if you replayed a hand you won, you might not win it the second time.</p>

<p>To me the answer is hands down Steph Curry.  Here are some of the what ifs that led to the Warrior&rsquo;s dynasty.</p>

<ul>
<li>Knicks and Dell Curry were trying to get Steph on the Knicks, but the Warriors decided to draft Steph before the Knicks</li>
<li>Steph comes into the league with a reputation for ankle injuries, but after his first few seasons, doesn&rsquo;t have anymore ankle issues</li>
<li>Steph almost gets traded to the Bucks, but it doesn&rsquo;t happen due ankle concerns</li>
<li>Warriors draft Klay, but almost trade him.  Jerry West stops the trade by threatening to resign.</li>
<li>Warriors draft Draymond Green in the second round.  He eventually becomes a perfect complement to Steph and an all time great defender.</li>
<li>Starting PF David Lee gets hurt, giving Draymond a chance to show his skills.</li>
<li>Steve Kerr becomes head coach with no head coach experience.  His motion offense allows Curry to shoot tons of 3s and play more off ball.  Prior to Kerr, there were talks that Curry should model his game more on Steve Nash.</li>
<li>Curry&rsquo;s injury concerns cause his contract to be lower than his performance.  This, combined with a sudden salary cap increase, allows the Warriors to sign KD.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure you could make a similar list for other dynasties, but it&rsquo;s pretty amazing to me all the coincidences that allowed the Warriors dynasty to happen.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Steph would still be an amazing player if you change some of the events on that list, but I doubt alternative universe Steph has four rings.</p>

<p>Thoughts?  Any other good choices?  Is this good off-season discussion?</p>

      <label for="lopy76c" class="commentText"><p>The west was as tough then as it is now, so to say he moves to the east would be a favorable move.</p>

<p>even if Kobe had a bad supporting cast, he is a higher floor raiser than Duncan, and I know the immediate response to this is look at 02-03!, but in reality, that team was the best defensive team in the league, and would still be over .500 without Duncan.</p>

<p>Pop&rsquo;s record WITHOUT Tim Duncan playing through his career is still over .500 - Pop frequently reseted his players to get ready for playoffs, so there&rsquo;s a sizable sample.</p>

<p>Kobe doesn&rsquo;t have to attract Pau specifically, but any other top 20 player during that period. Kobe can attract players so much, he was denied the opportunity to play with Chris Paul.</p>

<p>Tim Duncan doesn&rsquo;t have that level of aura.</p>

<p>Tim Duncan was boosted by the spurs organization and would suffer a fate likened to that of Kevin Garnett</p>

<p>Kobe could definitely attract a Pau Gasol type player in his career.</p>

So pretty sure Duncan is winning no matter what and if his team is even halfway competent he wins 2-3 minimum. Only three players won over 70% of games for their career (minimum 1000 games) - Duncan, Parker, ginobli. I’m pretty sure Duncan had far more to do with that than Parker and ginobil.</p>

<p>it was the best defensive team in the league and was very strong without Duncan holding teams to an average of 90.4 points and 43.6% fg</p>

<p>absolutely not comparable to 06 kobe</p>

<p>Bruce Bowen was a very good defensive perimeter, although dirty</p>

<p>and DRob was still a formidable shot blocker - if they got past bruce bowen, they wouldn&rsquo;t have got past DRob + Duncan</p>

But their offense would have been horrific without Duncan. I’m old enough to have watched the 03 spurs and it was by far our worst championship team save for a monster postseason by Duncan.
I agree it’s not comparable to 06 Kobe because Duncan won a championship and Kobe lost in the first round.</p>

You can be born with all of the talent in the world but if you aren&rsquo;t in the right environment, that talent can end up mediocre if not undeveloped. Like the best flower that has to grow in concrete. Doesn&rsquo;t matter how bright and lovely the flower&rsquo;s DNA says it should be, concrete is not going to provide enough nutrients for that flower to realize its potential.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible for Curry to have languished in mediocrity, for at least two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What if he&rsquo;s drafted to a team whose medical staff isn&rsquo;t good enough to recognize how to properly treat his early career ankle issues? Not all medical staffs are the same and many teams in sports languish because of it. Doesn&rsquo;t matter how much talent you have if your body can&rsquo;t support it. He would have racked up DNP&rsquo;s and never gotten his talent to grow without racking enough minutes due to a bum ankle.</p></li>

<li><p>The management at the time decides to go with Monta Ellis instead of Curry. Same problem, his development is halted due to lack of minutes.</p></li>

<p>The fact the Spurs got the 1st pick (without even having the worst record), thanks to two big injuries the year before.</p>

<p>He got to play his rookie season along side one of the best big men during that era (David Robinson).</p>

<p>He got a coach that was perfect for his playstyle (Pops).</p>

<p>The insanity of how good their later picks would turn out: Ginobli at 57 and Parker at 28th (again just shows how good Pops was as a coach).</p>

<p>Imagine David not getting hurt and Tim goes anywhere else. He would have had a good career, but he would not have flourished.</p>

      <label for="lopvtao" class="commentText"><p>Would he?</p>

<p>He was not an offensive option that most think he is, and he was still playing pretty close to the rim - he never extended perimeter defense like a Kevin Garnett would, so to say he would average more points and blocks is questionable.</p>

<p>Duncan took high percentage shots, and was incredibly inefficient at it for a 7 footer who only played within 15 ft of the rim.</p>

<p>I think having Duncan as your offensive first option is pretty weak.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, much like Robinson, Curry getting injured also allowed Warriors to get an early draft pick.  Luckily for the rest of the league, they didn&rsquo;t draft anyone on the level of Tim Duncan.</p>

      <label for="lopho6i" class="commentText"><p>I disagree with that Kawhi point - Kawhi wasn&rsquo;t that kind of a shooter yet in 2014 when they won that ring. He had a really nice playoffs hitting 41% of his 3.2 threes, but he was only taking 0.5 off the bounce, and 1.3 pull ups in the midrange per night. During the regular season he shot 38% from 3, taking 2.7 per night, 2.2 of which were catch and shoot.</p>

<p>I agree he got lucky having a true defensive superstar who could hold his own on the offensive end drafted to play alongside him late in his career. But the jumper wasn&rsquo;t anything remotely close to all time great, and he didn&rsquo;t shoot it in the quantity to make the difference of an all time great shot at that point.</p>

<p>He was 5th on the team in 3PA per night, and 6th on the team in 3P% among those who played. In the playoffs he did up his game - 4th on the team and 3rd on the team in those numbers respectively. But still not being utilized as an all time great by the team.</p>

<p>I will give you: he was blisteringly hot in the Finals - going <sup>11</sup>&frasl;<sub>19</sub> from deep across that 5 game demolition of the Heatles.</p>

<p>But that was hard to see coming, in the 3 previous rounds he was a bit inconsistent going: <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>19</sub> in 7 games, <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>17</sub> in 5 games, and then <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>19</sub> in 6 games.</p>

      <label for="lopwwq2" class="commentText"><p>He was a top 5 player in the nba day 1. He might not have won a championship his second season but he would have been great no matter what (excluding injuries). Maybe he also doesn’t blow out his knee in 2002 and keeps his athleticism longer. Maybe he plays in the weaker East and teams up with tmac in Orlando and makes 7 straight finals. Duncan made the spurs not the other way around.</p>

      <label for="loqophc" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think this is true. Let me say this at the start of this comment. Duncan is the best power forward to ever play in the NBA. Hands down. Now&hellip;Duncan would not have had near the career he had if he didn&rsquo;t play for the Spurs. That front office did an amazing job during his span there.</p>

<p>Also: Spurs were a Top 3 team in the NBA at the time and only had a lottery pick due to 2 teams being ineligible for a top pick and Admiral going down half way through the season prior, even then they didn&rsquo;t have the best odds for the top pick. Spurs were already a solid franchise before Timmy got there.</p>

<p>But back to the front office. Look back at all the players they signed to bring Tim all the help he needed. Role players were shining in Pops system (Kerr, Horry, Turk, etc). You can be an all time talent (and Tim is), but without a good front office, you&rsquo;re name isn&rsquo;t brought up in the &ldquo;all-time greats&rdquo; discussions.</p>

<p>Remember this thread is about what small detail could have changed the outcome of a superstar. David Robinson getting injured lead to Duncan getting drafted into a playoff team and not a bum team. Tim would have shined. But he wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten 5 rings.</p>
