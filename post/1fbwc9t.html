      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fbwc9t/the_201011_blazers_roster_was_absolutely_stacked/"><p>The 2010-11 Blazers roster was absolutely stacked with talent</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Look at this roster:</p>

<p>PG: 34yo Andre Miller: 13/4/7, one of the better players of his generation to never make an All-Star appearance, consistently a positive +/- guy on the floor</p>

<p>SG: 24yo Wes Matthews: 16/3/2, 40% 3pt shooter, one of the top 3&amp;D guys of the era</p>

<p>SF: 22yo Nic Batum: 12/5/2, this was before his playmaking/point forward prime but still a valuable athletic two-way wing</p>

<p>PF: 28yo Gerald Wallace (acquired in-season): 16/8/3 with 3 stocks, coming off a 1st Team All-Defense year &amp; All-Star appearance for Charlotte in 2010</p>

<p>C: 25yo LaMarcus Aldridge: 22/9/2, 1st of his 5x All-NBA selections</p>

<p>Bench:</p>

<p>Rudy Fernandez - one of the better Euros of his time</p>

<p>Marcus Camby - old but still was getting DPOY votes in 2010</p>

<p>Patty Mills - young and underappreciated in Portland but a great talent nonetheless</p>

<p>Then there are two of the biggest &lsquo;what ifs&rsquo; in NBA history in <strong>Brandon Roy and Greg Oden</strong> who were on the roster but basically done.</p>

<p>The fact that this team was paying the bill for two injured guys with HOF potential, and still managed to win 48 games in a brutal West, and take the eventual NBA champs to 6 games (better than Kobe&rsquo;s Lakers and KD&rsquo;s Thunder) is crazy to me.</p>

<p>Injury hypotheticals are often far-fetched but in this case we are talking about an actual roster that existed and was paid for. You have to think a healthy All-NBA level BRoy and a healthy 4th year Oden (admittedly an oxymoron) in addition to this 8 man core would have pushed them towards 60+ wins and title contention at a minimum.</p>

<p>What an amazing roster of players in their prime playing age.</p>

      <label for="lm3tg9b" class="commentText"><p>Leading the league in assists doesn’t guarantee an All-Star appearance. In fact, many players who topped the assist charts didn’t make the All-Star team. Over the last 15 years, players like James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Rajon Rondo, and Steve Nash have all led the league in assists but missed the All-Star game that season, and if you go even further back you see players like Mark Jackson and Rod Strickland join the list too. It happens more often than you might think.</p>

      <label for="lm4hyr0" class="commentText"><p>I think this is a list of a lot of fondly remembered guys more than it is super stacked - or was at that point in their careers. Mathews, for example, was good and got better, but was also coming off his rookie year after being undrafted. Miller at that point was crafty and fun as hell to watch, but limited because of his shooting and athleticism. Wallace was again fun but limited just because of his shooting, and not far off his career collapsing too early because he couldn&rsquo;t shoot and injuries slowed him down. Fernandez was cool in his almost threatening to be early career JR Smith kinda way.</p>

<p>also I imagine when the Oregonians wake up they will take issue with calling mills &ldquo;underappreciated&rdquo; in Portland.</p>

      <label for="lm3txi7" class="commentText"><p>Brandon Roy was on his way to superstardom, no amount of talented role players will ever make up for that. This specific Portland team is built like the Knicks this past year. One really good player and the rest average to good, they play great team ball but struggle against top teams because they don’t have a reliable 2nd option to consistently score.</p>

      <label for="lm3uebv" class="commentText"><p>I think you&rsquo;ve misread. I&rsquo;m including Brandon Roy&rsquo;s talent, and Greg Oden&rsquo;s talent, as part of the reason I think the 2011 Blazers had amazing talent. The roster on paper - disregarding health - is one of the best that never gets talked about.</p>

      <label for="lm3vok9" class="commentText"><p>The only reason why I keep bringing up age is because if you actually watched these players play at this time you wouldn’t be thinking like this. Gerald Wallace sucked at playing winning ball, he had all the skill sets but for some reason him and Ricky Davis couldn’t or didn’t want to put it all together. Wes Matthew’s has always been a solid 3&amp;D but that’s it. Andre Miller got better as he got older, a solid player. Nic Batum has always been what he is . Like from an athletic standpoint you are right, but from a purely basketball talent then no, the Phoenix Suns would take the cake for most talented roster.</p>

<p>Gerald Wallace sucked at playing winning ball? Just take one look at his plus minus numbers lol. Not to mention he was just coming off a season in which he led the BOBCATS to the playoffs.</p>

<p>Wes Matthews was regarded as one of the best if not the best 3 and D guys in rhe early 2010s, he was beyond &ldquo;solid&rdquo;. He was consistently high in 3pts made and was consistently near 40%.</p>

<p>You need either 2 players in the top 10 or an MVP caliber player essentially, and this Portland team has neither.</p>

Oden is a much bigger unknown but at least the plus minus data indicates Portland won their minutes when Oden played, and were better with him on the floor. Can&rsquo;t say the same about Darko who was consistently a negative.</p>

      <label for="lm3rk4s" class="commentText"><p>Yes, a healthy prime Brandon Roy and a Greg Oden that could actually move around the court could have possibly made this team great. But that was not the case so this was just a good team that no one expected to go very far (although most picked them against Dallas).
As far as talented rosters go, the Thunder far surpassed them and aside from 1 finals went basically nowhere.</p>

<p>So what point are you trying to make?</p>

      <label for="lm3tnem" class="commentText"><p>Just that it was an extremely talented roster that could have been special even outside of the two injured stars.</p>

<p>The 2012 Thunder are discussed all the time as a talented roster, and while I agree, we saw that the issue with the Thunder post-2012 was that their offense ended up being a two man, my turn your turn offense. I don&rsquo;t see how adding a iso player like prime Harden would help that. The Blazers had more potential complementarity.</p>
