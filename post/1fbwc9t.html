</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Look at this roster:</p>

<p>PG: 34yo Andre Miller: 13/4/7, one of the better players of his generation to never make an All-Star appearance, consistently a positive +/- guy on the floor</p>

<p>SG: 24yo Wes Matthews: 16/3/2, 40% 3pt shooter, one of the top 3&amp;D guys of the era</p>

<p>SF: 22yo Nic Batum: 12/5/2, this was before his playmaking/point forward prime but still a valuable athletic two-way wing</p>

<p>PF: 28yo Gerald Wallace (acquired in-season): 16/8/3 with 3 stocks, coming off a 1st Team All-Defense year &amp; All-Star appearance for Charlotte in 2010</p>

<p>C: 25yo LaMarcus Aldridge: 22/9/2, 1st of his 5x All-NBA selections</p>

<p>Bench:</p>

<p>Rudy Fernandez - one of the better Euros of his time</p>

<p>Marcus Camby - old but still was getting DPOY votes in 2010</p>

<p>Patty Mills - young and underappreciated in Portland but a great talent nonetheless</p>

<p>Then there are two of the biggest &lsquo;what ifs&rsquo; in NBA history in <strong>Brandon Roy and Greg Oden</strong> who were on the roster but basically done.</p>

<p>The fact that this team was paying the bill for two injured guys with HOF potential, and still managed to win 48 games in a brutal West, and take the eventual NBA champs to 6 games (better than Kobe&rsquo;s Lakers and KD&rsquo;s Thunder) is crazy to me.</p>

<p>Injury hypotheticals are often far-fetched but in this case we are talking about an actual roster that existed and was paid for. You have to think a healthy All-NBA level BRoy and a healthy 4th year Oden (admittedly an oxymoron) in addition to this 8 man core would have pushed them towards 60+ wins and title contention at a minimum.</p>

<p>What an amazing roster of players in their prime playing age.</p>

      <label for="lm3tg9b" class="commentText"><p>Leading the league in assists doesn’t guarantee an All-Star appearance. In fact, many players who topped the assist charts didn’t make the All-Star team. Over the last 15 years, players like James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Rajon Rondo, and Steve Nash have all led the league in assists but missed the All-Star game that season, and if you go even further back you see players like Mark Jackson and Rod Strickland join the list too. It happens more often than you might think.</p>

      <label for="lm3uzz3" class="commentText"><p>Roy was 2nd team All-NBA by year 3 - it&rsquo;s absolutely possible he could have become a superstar and a HOFer. Oden is a much bigger unknown but at least the plus minus data indicates Portland won their minutes when Oden played, and were better with him on the floor. Can&rsquo;t say the same about Darko who was consistently a negative.</p>

      <label for="lm3rk4s" class="commentText"><p>Yes, a healthy prime Brandon Roy and a Greg Oden that could actually move around the court could have possibly made this team great. But that was not the case so this was just a good team that no one expected to go very far (although most picked them against Dallas).
As far as talented rosters go, the Thunder far surpassed them and aside from 1 finals went basically nowhere.</p>

<p>So what point are you trying to make?</p>

      <label for="lm3tnem" class="commentText"><p>Just that it was an extremely talented roster that could have been special even outside of the two injured stars.</p>

<p>The 2012 Thunder are discussed all the time as a talented roster, and while I agree, we saw that the issue with the Thunder post-2012 was that their offense ended up being a two man, my turn your turn offense. I don&rsquo;t see how adding a iso player like prime Harden would help that. The Blazers had more potential complementarity.</p>

Gerald Wallace sucked at playing winning ball, he had all the skill sets but for some reason him and Ricky Davis couldn’t or didn’t want to put it all together. Wes Matthew’s has always been a solid 3&amp;D but that’s it. Andre Miller got better as he got older, a solid player. Nic Batum has always been what he is . Like from an athletic standpoint you are right, but from a purely basketball talent then no, the Phoenix Suns would take the cake for most talented roster.</p>

<p>Wes Matthews was regarded as one of the best if not the best 3 and D guys in rhe early 2010s, he was beyond &ldquo;solid&rdquo;. He was consistently high in 3pts made and was consistently near 40%.</p>
