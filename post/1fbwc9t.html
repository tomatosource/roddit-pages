      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fbwc9t/the_201011_blazers_roster_was_absolutely_stacked/"><p>The 2010-11 Blazers roster was absolutely stacked with talent</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Look at this roster:</p>

<p>PG: 34yo Andre Miller: 13/4/7, one of the better players of his generation to never make an All-Star appearance, consistently a positive +/- guy on the floor</p>

<p>SG: 24yo Wes Matthews: 16/3/2, 40% 3pt shooter, one of the top 3&amp;D guys of the era</p>

<p>SF: 22yo Nic Batum: 12/5/2, this was before his playmaking/point forward prime but still a valuable athletic two-way wing</p>

<p>PF: 28yo Gerald Wallace (acquired in-season): 16/8/3 with 3 stocks, coming off a 1st Team All-Defense year &amp; All-Star appearance for Charlotte in 2010</p>

<p>C: 25yo LaMarcus Aldridge: 22/9/2, 1st of his 5x All-NBA selections</p>

<p>Bench:</p>

<p>Rudy Fernandez - one of the better Euros of his time</p>

<p>Marcus Camby - old but still was getting DPOY votes in 2010</p>

<p>Patty Mills - young and underappreciated in Portland but a great talent nonetheless</p>

<p>Then there are two of the biggest &lsquo;what ifs&rsquo; in NBA history in <strong>Brandon Roy and Greg Oden</strong> who were on the roster but basically done.</p>

<p>The fact that this team was paying the bill for two injured guys with HOF potential, and still managed to win 48 games in a brutal West, and take the eventual NBA champs to 6 games (better than Kobe&rsquo;s Lakers and KD&rsquo;s Thunder) is crazy to me.</p>

<p>Injury hypotheticals are often far-fetched but in this case we are talking about an actual roster that existed and was paid for. You have to think a healthy All-NBA level BRoy and a healthy 4th year Oden (admittedly an oxymoron) in addition to this 8 man core would have pushed them towards 60+ wins and title contention at a minimum.</p>

<p>What an amazing roster of players in their prime playing age.</p>

      <label for="lm6ksm0" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a false stat that got parroted one too many times.  That said, the reality is also just as impressive since they were the youngest team ever to win 54 games.</p>

<p>So, in a hypothetical healthy alternate universe, it&rsquo;s probable that if Aldridge becomes that 2014-2018 version of himself, Roy improves to a superstar, and Oden achieves his hype&hellip;.they probably do get a ton of 60 win seasons for much of the 2010s.</p>

<p>That would put them on a similar trajectory as those 80s Lakers or Celtics squads, 90s Bulls, and the 2010s Warriors.</p>

      <label for="lm4hyr0" class="commentText"><p>I think this is a list of a lot of fondly remembered guys more than it is super stacked - or was at that point in their careers. Mathews, for example, was good and got better, but was also coming off his rookie year after being undrafted. Miller at that point was crafty and fun as hell to watch, but limited because of his shooting and athleticism. Wallace was again fun but limited just because of his shooting, and not far off his career collapsing too early because he couldn&rsquo;t shoot and injuries slowed him down. Fernandez was cool in his almost threatening to be early career JR Smith kinda way.</p>

<p>also I imagine when the Oregonians wake up they will take issue with calling mills &ldquo;underappreciated&rdquo; in Portland.</p>

      <label for="lm3tg9b" class="commentText"><p>Leading the league in assists doesn’t guarantee an All-Star appearance. In fact, many players who topped the assist charts didn’t make the All-Star team. Over the last 15 years, players like James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Rajon Rondo, and Steve Nash have all led the league in assists but missed the All-Star game that season, and if you go even further back you see players like Mark Jackson and Rod Strickland join the list too. It happens more often than you might think.</p>

<p>The only stat that truly guarantees an All-Star nod if you lead the league in it is scoring. There are plenty of examples of players who led the league in assists, rebounds, steals, blocks, 3PT%, FG%, and more who didn’t make the All-Star team.</p>

      <label for="lm6fnr9" class="commentText"><p>They were special considering how well they played against the 2011 Champs with their two most talented players being injured.</p>

<p>Jason Terry even stated they were the toughest team they faced&hellip;.probably because they had players at every position and depth, which the other teams they faced didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I still think if Oden and Roy were healthy and improved, they probably win that year.  One of the problems with the Big 3 Heat was that they were weak in the middle and couldn&rsquo;t rebound or defend against good centers (like Tyson Chandler).  Most of those years, they were Bottom 10 in rebounds and had poor interior D numbers.</p>

<p>So, if Oden became what 3rd year Dwight Howard was (which, his per 36 numbers were looking like that in 2009-10) and Roy&rsquo;s stats simply improved (he came off 27ppg in the playoffs and was averaging 27ppg for like two months in 2009-10), it&rsquo;s probably difficult to stop that Portland squad.</p>

<p>This was the same core that was the youngest team ever to achieve 54 wins so it is kinda sad that we didn&rsquo;t get to see them peak together</p>

When the Blazers tied the series 2-2 it was just as much about the Mavs being serial playoff chokers and Dirk being a soft Euro who would never win anything.</p>

Gerald Wallace sucked at playing winning ball, he had all the skill sets but for some reason him and Ricky Davis couldn’t or didn’t want to put it all together. Wes Matthew’s has always been a solid 3&amp;D but that’s it. Andre Miller got better as he got older, a solid player. Nic Batum has always been what he is . Like from an athletic standpoint you are right, but from a purely basketball talent then no, the Phoenix Suns would take the cake for most talented roster.</p>

<p>Wes Matthews was regarded as one of the best if not the best 3 and D guys in rhe early 2010s, he was beyond &ldquo;solid&rdquo;. He was consistently high in 3pts made and was consistently near 40%.</p>

<p>Yes, an MVP caliber player can turn a bad team into a contender. Can&rsquo;t believe one would assume otherwise.</p>

<p>I mean, say something stupid, expect negative reactions. It&rsquo;s nothing personal, anyone who would say you need to top 10 players to be a contender would be downvoted.</p>

      <label for="lm4eb6w" class="commentText"><p>Because they did need a second star in addition to Aldridge to contend. Do people here really think the roster had enough to win it all? Disagree.</p>

      <label for="lm3u0dc" class="commentText"><p>Eh, maybe to win multiple championships, but not to contend. The 2000 Blazers are a great example of a contending team that don&rsquo;t meet your criterion.</p>

      <label for="lm3rk4s" class="commentText"><p>Yes, a healthy prime Brandon Roy and a Greg Oden that could actually move around the court could have possibly made this team great. But that was not the case so this was just a good team that no one expected to go very far (although most picked them against Dallas).
As far as talented rosters go, the Thunder far surpassed them and aside from 1 finals went basically nowhere.</p>

<p>So what point are you trying to make?</p>

      <label for="lm3tnem" class="commentText"><p>Just that it was an extremely talented roster that could have been special even outside of the two injured stars.</p>

<p>The 2012 Thunder are discussed all the time as a talented roster, and while I agree, we saw that the issue with the Thunder post-2012 was that their offense ended up being a two man, my turn your turn offense. I don&rsquo;t see how adding a iso player like prime Harden would help that. The Blazers had more potential complementarity.</p>
