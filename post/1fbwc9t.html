</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Look at this roster:</p>

<p>PG: 34yo Andre Miller: 13/4/7, one of the better players of his generation to never make an All-Star appearance, consistently a positive +/- guy on the floor</p>

<p>SG: 24yo Wes Matthews: 16/3/2, 40% 3pt shooter, one of the top 3&amp;D guys of the era</p>

<p>SF: 22yo Nic Batum: 12/5/2, this was before his playmaking/point forward prime but still a valuable athletic two-way wing</p>

<p>PF: 28yo Gerald Wallace (acquired in-season): 16/8/3 with 3 stocks, coming off a 1st Team All-Defense year &amp; All-Star appearance for Charlotte in 2010</p>

<p>C: 25yo LaMarcus Aldridge: 22/9/2, 1st of his 5x All-NBA selections</p>

<p>Bench:</p>

<p>Rudy Fernandez - one of the better Euros of his time</p>

<p>Marcus Camby - old but still was getting DPOY votes in 2010</p>

<p>Patty Mills - young and underappreciated in Portland but a great talent nonetheless</p>

<p>Then there are two of the biggest &lsquo;what ifs&rsquo; in NBA history in <strong>Brandon Roy and Greg Oden</strong> who were on the roster but basically done.</p>

<p>The fact that this team was paying the bill for two injured guys with HOF potential, and still managed to win 48 games in a brutal West, and take the eventual NBA champs to 6 games (better than Kobe&rsquo;s Lakers and KD&rsquo;s Thunder) is crazy to me.</p>

<p>Injury hypotheticals are often far-fetched but in this case we are talking about an actual roster that existed and was paid for. You have to think a healthy All-NBA level BRoy and a healthy 4th year Oden (admittedly an oxymoron) in addition to this 8 man core would have pushed them towards 60+ wins and title contention at a minimum.</p>

<p>What an amazing roster of players in their prime playing age.</p>

      <label for="lm3rk4s" class="commentText"><p>Yes, a healthy prime Brandon Roy and a Greg Oden that could actually move around the court could have possibly made this team great. But that was not the case so this was just a good team that no one expected to go very far (although most picked them against Dallas).
As far as talented rosters go, the Thunder far surpassed them and aside from 1 finals went basically nowhere.</p>

<p>So what point are you trying to make?</p>
