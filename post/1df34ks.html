<p>&ldquo;To say that it&rsquo;s not a motivating factor – the finances –to leave a place, it&rsquo;s definitely a thing&hellip;To leave all that behind, there probably is a number. I don&rsquo;t know what that is. &ldquo;</p>

<p>Dan Hurley was on the LeBatard show and he was asked if he had a number in mind to go to the Lakers, seems like he would have gone if they offered more money.</p>

<p>The reported offer would have made Hurley the 6th highest paid coach behind Kerr, Pop, Spo, Lue and Monty Williams. And that was without any of the reported incentives in the contract.</p>

      <label for="l8gb9dl" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t blame him though. He can coast on his success where he is and have incredible job security for basically as long as he wants, and the reputation after 2 straight championships will make recruiting an easy streak for a long time. In LA he has very little chance of what fans and ownership would consider success in the next couple of years. It would have taken a lot more than a small percent increase in salary to make that make sense. I wouldn&rsquo;t leave my job for like a 15% increase in salary or whatever it was, even if its a more prestigious position, if it came with a risk of cratering my job security that much.</p>

Maybe he can catch them when they&rsquo;re fully committed to a rebuild instead of squeezing out the last of what LeBron has.</p>

      <label for="l8gkq91" class="commentText"><p>I mean it was more than reasonable for most candidates, but Hurley is a special case. He’s likely due to make around that same amount in the college ranks, I’m not saying La had to make it substantially larger but I honestly thought the number would be a little higher if they were gonna go all in on Hurley and try and lure him from what he has going in the college game like they did. I will say I think they were more trying to entice with the term of the contract than the salary it seemed. I thought they’d maybe get closer to Spos number than they did.</p>

      <label for="l8glpdj" class="commentText"><p>The Lakers annual salary would have been double what Hurley’s most recent announced annual salary was. Presumably Hurley is getting a new contract which will be closer to Lakers money, but I don’t think details are out yet. Regardless, though, making someone who has not coached in the NBA become the 6th highest paid coach is certainly above market value. Not unreasonable for Lakers to offer, not unreasonable for Hurley to decline.</p>

What the Lakers don’t have is an owner who is / was a billionaire before owning the team. These franchises are basically money-printing machines but the Lakers economics are different compared to others because the owner can’t just prop up their vanity project. Juxtapose with Ballmer.</p>

<p>Weird to think of it this way but the Lakers are more a family business than anything else.</p>

      <label for="l8hbqi6" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t blame you for not understanding the intricacies of how the Buss ownership of the Lakers is structured, because it&rsquo;s very unusual, and is pretty complicated, but what you wrote is incorrect. When Dr. Buss died, he left the 2/3rds ownership stake he had in the Lakers in a series of trusts that his 6 children are co-equal trustees of. But the way he structured the trusts was that none of them actually has any ownership themselves, so that no one member could decide to just sell their share.</p>

<p>The entire Buss stake in the Lakers is owned collectively, and the only way for the Buss children to sell <em>any</em> of their percentage of the Lakers is if 4 out of the 6 children (or more than 50%) agree to sell <em>all</em> of it. If that happens, then they just split the proceeds 6 ways. The reason Jeanie Buss is considered &ldquo;the owner&rdquo; is because she is elected by the Lakers board (which is mostly made up of the Buss children and the other owners), and as such she&rsquo;s the sole decision maker. But even she could not decide to just sell her stake or the Buss children&rsquo;s stake by herself.</p>

<p>Another weird quirk of the Buss trust, is that if any one of the Buss siblings dies, they can not leave their portion of the Lakers to anyone in a will, as they do not own any part of the team. All they do is act as a co-trustee. So if one of them dies, then there are now just 5 trustees instead of 6. Because of this, as they get older, you&rsquo;d imagine there would be more pressure to sell, as then they&rsquo;d be able to leave the proceeds of the sale to their children or spouses, and a couple of the Buss children already want to sell, but they&rsquo;re currently outvoted.</p>

<p>plus the have the money&hellip;they have the largest local tv contract in the NBA.</p>

<p>In 2011 the Los Angeles Lakers signed the richest local television rights deal in the NBA.

<p>This at least gives him leverage in future contract negotiations vs him saying there&rsquo;s no amount of money that would make him leave his current job.</p>

      <label for="l8gljuv" class="commentText"><p>I will say I was a little surprised Lakers didn’t fork over a deal closer Spo’s current salary. Obviously what they offered was extremely good for a guy who’s never coached in the NBA, but they seemed all in on Hurely and if they’re realistically wanted to lure him away from potentially getting a 3 peat and being a dominant force I thought they’d go at him with a little more money. I think the 6 years on the deal was meant to compensate for that.</p>

      <label for="l8h8lnm" class="commentText"><p>Yeah but my point is if he’s your guy and you were really serious about bringing him in from what he has going at UCONN I would’ve expected a bigger salary. They were already kind of giving unprecedented money for an unproven guy anyway. They did offer 6 years tho which is a lot so I do think they kind of understood the salary wasn’t a big enough raise but the years were very generous.</p>

Not that I&rsquo;m convinced they should have paid up for him, I think going for top assistants generally speaking makes more sense and likely cheaper (lots of love for Charles Lee), but the fact they obviously wanted him as their first choice and just couldn&rsquo;t out bid a college team is kind of sad.</p>

<p>It also makes me so disgusted about college spectator sports in general. I&rsquo;m a lot less bitter about it now that the players can actually legally make money and we&rsquo;ve ended the charade pretending these are amateur student athletes, but its also an utter outrage that many of our universities have become nothing but pro sports franchises with a side gig.</p>
