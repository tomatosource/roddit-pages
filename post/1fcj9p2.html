      <label for="lm8tg58" class="commentText"><p>Put 2019 Raptors in a Time Machine and send them back to 2001, Lakers win in 4. It’s such a different game and 2019 Raptors are not built for that era and the rule set, especially lack of big men who can matchup with Shaq and even a 35 year old Horace Grant.</p>

<p>Visa-versa, 2001 Lakers still have lots of 3 and D players like Fisher, Fox, Horry and Brian Shaw, with Shaq being post and Kobe being the mid range. Only Horace Grant becomes useless in 2019 era ruleset. Lakers in 6 in this scenario.</p>

      <label for="lm8v48t" class="commentText"><p>You’re being too kind to the raptors. Even in 2019 the lakers would still win in 5 at most.  What would actually change that prevents the lakers from doing what they’d do in the 90s? The raptors aren’t super physical but even so the lakers have two point guards who can more than handle Lowry if he got a bit testy, but he’s normal for what they’re used to anyway. They shoot a lot of threes, but the lakers had a ton of perimeter defense anyway. I see no reason the lakers don’t still sweep them, only reason I’d give them 4-1 is maybe they have an off game or Kawhi goes nuts, idk.  The lakers dominate this team no matter the era.</p>

      <label for="lm8vk5p" class="commentText"><p>Is this serious? The Lakers sweep, no matter the era. You’re comparing one of the most dominant teams ever at their peak to a team that reached the Finals on a lucky bounce and won because their opponents lost key players to injury. While Toronto was solid, their title was one of the luckiest in recent history. The Lakers, on the other hand, steamrolled the league to three straight titles with almost no resistance. This is a no-brainer.</p>

<p>Why ask this? It’s an odd matchup, and one team is clearly better. Just curious why you’re interested.</p>

      <label for="lm8rpdy" class="commentText"><p>Lakers in 6. Shaq would dominate, probably average 35 and 15. Kobe around 28. Kawhi would ball out though, maybe 32 a game. That Lakers team was just on another level. Raps would put up a fight, but can&rsquo;t see them stopping prime Shaq and Kobe.</p>

      <label for="lm8wrrj" class="commentText"><p>Bro&hellip;the 2019 Raptors are becoming one of the most overrated teams in the last two decades now and it&rsquo;s mostly because y&rsquo;all turned a feel good story of a GM who took a crazy shot on a one-year rental that paid off and made it into an exaggerated overhyped narrative</p>

<p>That Raptors team beat the Orland Magic in the first round, that was a bum ass Magic team who&rsquo;s star player was Aaron Gordon, yes that Aaron Gordon who is now Denver&rsquo;s 3rd or 4th option depending on how MPJ is feeling</p>

<p>Then they beat the Sixers on a lucky bounce, the same Sixers who were relying on Tobias fuckin&rsquo; Harris to give them good minutes, who had Embiid averaging a pathetic 17ppg and a Jimmy Butler who had his second worst shooting playoffs in the last 6 years, barely beat them</p>

<p>Lastly they beat the Warriors in 6 games, and only because KD and Klay got hurt, and it almost went 7 games despite those injuries but Steph missed a good look down 2 with 30 seconds left, he makes that they go 7, that&rsquo;s not dominant lmao</p>

<p>2001 Lakers kill the 2019 Raptrs get real</p>

      <label for="lm8yfjx" class="commentText"><p>Shaq would dominate, but I trust Marc Gasol would affect him at least a tiny bit, especially if we throw a defensive scheme similar to the one we used on Giannis at him. He’s still giving us <sup>40</sup>&frasl;<sub>15</sub> every night probably but we can live with that.</p>

<p>The rest of them I’m simply not worried. Raptors perimeter defense was suffocating in ‘19, and early 2000s had some of the most inefficient offensive schemes ever. Kobe who hasn’t hit his mental prime yet is simply going to run himself into the Kawhi, Danny G, Lowry, Norm Powell and Siakam meat grinder trying to match Shaq’s production. There’s legit no one for him to attack.</p>

<p>In terms of Raptors offense I mean…a mix of modern 3-point focused motion offence and Kawhi middies is gonna discombobulate the shit out of them.</p>

<p>I know that relative to the leagues of their time, the Lakers were WAY further ahead of the competition than the Raptors but I think the game evolved enough that the Raptors team play can overshadow Shaq’s dominance.</p>
