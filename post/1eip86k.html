      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1eip86k/ruining_myths_larry_bird_was_not_unathletic_until/"><p>Ruining Myths: Larry Bird was not unathletic until the back injury after the &lsquo;85 season.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>In fact he probably had above average athlecism for his size. He was the power forward until that back injury, Kevin McHale didn&rsquo;t become the full time starter until &lsquo;86.
Concerning the athleticism of Larry Bird he was listed at 6&rsquo;9 based on his draft card he got at age 18. He was probably closer to 6&rdquo;11, look at his on court fight with Kareem who is listed at 7&rsquo;2. There&rsquo;s no way they&rsquo;re a full 5&rdquo; inches difference in their heights.
So Larry was a legit big man, there should be no expectations of him running like a guard. But he could run the court with or without the ball a lot faster than most men his size. That&rsquo;s not unathletic. Also he was as strong as a bull. But his best physical attributes was his quickness, not speed. He was lightning quick. Everybody bit on his fakes. Still the one and only player I&rsquo;ve ever seen break ankles with just headfakes.</p>

<p>I think we need to make a difference between athletic and explosive. Just because you can’t jump out the gym like Ja Morant or race down the court like Fox, doesn’t mean you’re not insanely athletic.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t call an Ironman race athlete or Tour de France competitor unathletic just because they can’t dunk?</p>

      <label for="lg93sd9" class="commentText"><p>It’s because Larry is white. They assume every white player = not athletic, but skilled and crafty, when that is far from the truth. Dirk was also very athletic before he got injured, but he is another player who people always assumed was a slow, unauthentic big man.</p>

<p>   It drives me crazy hearing about how Jokic js…Jokic is 7 foot, 300 pounds, has crazy endurance, insane coordination and balance, strong, and is regularly out running other big man down the court. He’s not jumping out of the gym like prime Westbrook, but he is very athletic for a guy his size. </p>

      <label for="lg99pqt" class="commentText"><p>Also, like Bird, Jokic makes decisions so quickly and is agile enough to capitalize on how fast he can process and map the court before defenders can react.</p>

<p>Sometimes Magic could barely jump more than a foot off the ground if he didn&rsquo;t get a running start. But the fact that he just needed half a second to map everything and catch defenders off-guard was enough for him to constantly apply pressure and keep defenses off balance.</p>

      <label for="lg98c2v" class="commentText"><p>Yeah. I try to point this out as much as possible.</p>

<p>Sure, MJ was explosive, quick, and agile as hell.</p>

<p>But he was so goddamned coordinated compared to everyone else that size.</p>

<p>Every move, fake, and all the aerial gymnastics he pulled off wouldn&rsquo;t be anywhere near as effective or even possible if he didn&rsquo;t have the touch, hand eye coordination, and body control to pull it off.</p>

<p>Being an explosive athlete helps a ton. But there&rsquo;s a reason a lot of insanely athletic players (in that regard) don&rsquo;t always produce much in the NBA outside of some awesome highlights and Dunk Contest wins. Because if they lack the skill and coordination (plus IQ) to be productive players then that athleticism is somewhat wasted and kind of useless.</p>

Look at Bird with Russell, who was legit measured 6’9” <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> barefoot and they are almost the same height. </p>

<p>Bird would be 6’10”-6’10.5” in shoes. Not 6’11”, but he was legitimately very tall. </p>

<p>He has a decent handle but he wasn&rsquo;t dynamic with the ball in his hands like the superstar point guards of today and he didn&rsquo;t have anywhere near as quick a trigger as Steph</p>

<p>Obviously he&rsquo;d still be a great player but one of his advantages over players in his own era was that he took a high volume of threes but now everyone takes a lot of threes so he will have lost that advantage today</p>

      <label for="lg8d6e8" class="commentText"><p>Look at when the supposed back injury happened to Bird (1985 or 1986?), and the games he played after (knowing that he missed most of the 1988-89 season after surgery to remove bone spurs in both his heels, not the back, and he was already 31-32 by that stage). It was either a slow accumulated creep, or wasn&rsquo;t <em>the</em> reason he declined/retired.</p>

<p>In the timeline of things, the back doesn&rsquo;t seem like the sole reason or the end point of his career and prime. If Bird hadn&rsquo;t had the back injury (immediately after which he had some of his best seasons, I might add), what more were you really expecting from him? Better numbers into his mid-30s? A longer career? He still averaged 20.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub>.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub>.8 at age <sup>35</sup>&frasl;<sub>36</sub> in his final season.</p>

      <label for="lg8h0fy" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s about his athleticism not his numbers or production. He has a reputation of being naturally slow and unathletic largely due to those post &lsquo;86 years when his back was twisting up like a pretzel. But this wasn&rsquo;t the case, he was quicker, faster, and more agile than the vast majority of players his size before that. The proggessively intense decline in athleticism from 86 to 89 cannot be explained by mere aging.</p>
