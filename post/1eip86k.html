      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1eip86k/ruining_myths_larry_bird_was_not_unathletic_until/"><p>Ruining Myths: Larry Bird was not unathletic until the back injury after the &lsquo;85 season.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>In fact he probably had above average athlecism for his size. He was the power forward until that back injury, Kevin McHale didn&rsquo;t become the full time starter until &lsquo;86.
Concerning the athleticism of Larry Bird he was listed at 6&rsquo;9 based on his draft card he got at age 18. He was probably closer to 6&rdquo;11, look at his on court fight with Kareem who is listed at 7&rsquo;2. There&rsquo;s no way they&rsquo;re a full 5&rdquo; inches difference in their heights.
So Larry was a legit big man, there should be no expectations of him running like a guard. But he could run the court with or without the ball a lot faster than most men his size. That&rsquo;s not unathletic. Also he was as strong as a bull. But his best physical attributes was his quickness, not speed. He was lightning quick. Everybody bit on his fakes. Still the one and only player I&rsquo;ve ever seen break ankles with just headfakes.</p>

<p>I think we need to make a difference between athletic and explosive. Just because you can’t jump out the gym like Ja Morant or race down the court like Fox, doesn’t mean you’re not insanely athletic.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t call an Ironman race athlete or Tour de France competitor unathletic just because they can’t dunk?</p>

      <label for="lg8d6e8" class="commentText"><p>Look at when the supposed back injury happened to Bird (1985 or 1986?), and the games he played after (knowing that he missed most of the 1988-89 season after surgery to remove bone spurs in both his heels, not the back, and he was already 31-32 by that stage). It was either a slow accumulated creep, or wasn&rsquo;t <em>the</em> reason he declined/retired.</p>

<p>In the timeline of things, the back doesn&rsquo;t seem like the sole reason or the end point of his career and prime. If Bird hadn&rsquo;t had the back injury (immediately after which he had some of his best seasons, I might add), what more were you really expecting from him? Better numbers into his mid-30s? A longer career? He still averaged 20.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub>.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub>.8 at age <sup>35</sup>&frasl;<sub>36</sub> in his final season.</p>

      <label for="lg8h0fy" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s about his athleticism not his numbers or production. He has a reputation of being naturally slow and unathletic largely due to those post &lsquo;86 years when his back was twisting up like a pretzel. But this wasn&rsquo;t the case, he was quicker, faster, and more agile than the vast majority of players his size before that. The proggessively intense decline in athleticism from 86 to 89 cannot be explained by mere aging.</p>

      <label for="lg8iw7v" class="commentText"><p>Fair enough, I&rsquo;m just referring to how the injury affected his overall play and production. It didn&rsquo;t really seem to cause an immediate decline, and in fact Bird had some of his best years after the back injury happened, irrespective of his level of athleticism.</p>
