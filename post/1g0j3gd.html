<p>Clarity is good. You should post this on r/nbadiscussion maybe but more of an analysis post about what you used in your model and what it comes up if rules permit.</p>

      <label for="lr94dcj" class="commentText"><p>I really like this. I would say I&rsquo;m much higher on the 76ers, Grizz, and Knicks, all of which I would put on higher tiers. I&rsquo;m much lower on the Kings, Lakers, and Warriors. In terms of tiering, I&rsquo;d probably swap the 76ers + Knicks with the Kings + Lakers. I&rsquo;d also swap the Warriors + Grizz.</p>

<p>Personally, I think a healthy 76ers could be in tier 1, but I believe, because VORP is a cumulative stat, it does tend to do a good job at highlighting who has been/hasn&rsquo;t been injured lately.</p>

      <label for="lr951y5" class="commentText"><p>Great points. A nice next step or potential adjustment would be to go through players who have faced one-time injuries and change the forecasts accordingly. Not all injuries are the same as far as their recurring nature, and factoring this in would be great.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already done a little of this for suspensions (Ja Morant and Miles Bridges) but more would be a good next step.</p>

      <label for="lr9fdif" class="commentText"><p>For sure. Also, in the above example, I look at Milwaukee and Philly and don&rsquo;t think they should be on separate tiers. However, Giannis (7.2) is going to have a much higher VORP than Embiid (4.5) because Embiid was injured in the regular season and Giannis was injured in the post-season. However, if you look at their playoff VORP from last year, Embiid&rsquo;s was actually higher because of when the injuries occurred.</p>

<p>Giannis, Middleton, and Dame are a healthier trio than Embiid, George, and Maxey, but, lately, how much more?</p>

<p>What I think would be interesting is to calculate what <em>would</em> have been a player&rsquo;s VORP over the course of the past 3 years, (based on their BPM), had they played what should be average minutes for them and compare it to what their actual VORP was. I feel like that could give you insight into who is actualizing their value and how predictive their VORP is based on how available they are.</p>

<p>The Weighted VORP is used as the method of power ranking, using the following weights within each team:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Top 5 - 60% (~12% each)</p></li>

<li><p>6 through 8 - 30% (~10% each)</p></li>

<li><p>9 and 10 - 7% (~3.5% each)</p></li>

<li><p>11 through 13 - 3% (~1% each)</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So the top 8 guys account for 90% of this metric, and the top 10 account for 97%. I also show the top 5 and 13 in case people were interested in those too. The weights aren&rsquo;t perfect but they are my best estimate based on a couple of league averages.</p>

<p>I had a great time putting this together and am hoping to continue to build on this! Let me know if you have suggestions for improvement. Also, if a team is lower than you‚Äôd expect it‚Äôs likely due to one of two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Injury history for a star player</li>
<li>My model not doing as good of a job forecasting young stars (like the Magic)</li>

<p>Overall I‚Äôm pleased with how it turned out! This is something I want to keep improving and appreciate feedback on.</p>

      <label for="lrakk8x" class="commentText"><p>Seeing as he is using VORP it&rsquo;s pretty much that while the Knicks have a solid team, they don&rsquo;t have any players that are better than other teams best players. Other teams players at those positions are getting more points per possession, more assists, rebounds, whatever.</p>

<p>Knicks starting 5 are all very solid players, and that should mean they do very well this year, it doesn&rsquo;t mean statistically they are going to match up to a team like Boston that has several better players, or even the Lakers that have Lebron and AD who are much better than the 5 on the Knicks even though the rest of the Laker team isn&rsquo;t great.</p>

<p>That said, statistical models are just that. The fact that the Knicks have 5 good players and the Lakers have 2 and a half would make me think the Knicks could win their matchup, even though the VORP says Lebron and AD are much better than the Knicks so they should win most games. Basketball is a team game.</p>

      <label for="lraohy4" class="commentText"><p>Well, this explains why the kings are so high up. Model is pretty drastically overrating Domas, but he&rsquo;s a really good regular season performer so I guess that&rsquo;s where it comes from. Kings will be a good to great regular season team but it would be a huge shock if they won it all.</p>

<p>Fred VanVleet is also getting ranked way too high here. Not sure how much impact that has on Rockets&rsquo; ranking though considering they&rsquo;re a deep team with talented young players.</p>

      <label for="lrap2tw" class="commentText"><p>Yep, Sabonis is totally why. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as much of an issue with the model as it is with VORP. VORP had him as the #5 player in the NBA last year (he did make all-NBA third team) but the difference between fifth vs 11th place in VORP was 1.3 last year.</p>

      <label for="lr95due" class="commentText"><p>Yes, Ja&rsquo;s shoulder injury hurts him a lot here. I did manually adjust for his suspension (and Miles Bridges&rsquo; 10-game suspension) which puts him at about the same level as Zion. The biggest difference is that VORP likes the fourth and fifth guys on the Pelicans compared to the Grizzlies. I think some of it may be differences in VORP, and some of it also may be that when Ja comes back, he&rsquo;ll likely make his teammates better too which the model doesn&rsquo;t currently account for.</p>
