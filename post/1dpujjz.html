      <label for="lajiuws" class="commentText"><p>Once they trade Cam Johnson, We are looking at possibly 10+ 1sts for KD when it’s all said and done</p>

<p>That’s a crazy haul for a team who’s future was looking grim</p>

<p>Remember that Sean Marks took over the Nets job when they had limited assets cause of the Boston trade. In 2 years he created the DLO Nets that were filled with young talent. There are teams <strong>WITH PICKS</strong> that can’t even create the DLO Nets lol. He did it with little</p>

<p>One thing Marks has done well is constantly get the Nets out of a hole and rebound quickly. The Harden trade won’t hamstring them for any longer than this season. One of the quickest turn around ever.</p>

<p>Ben Simmons also expires next year to the tune of <span class="math inline">\(40 million. Nets are looking at \)</span>70-80 million in cap space next year. They can take a swing for a big trade and be right back in the playoffs, or tank for 2026 as well then try to swing for the 2026-2027 season</p>

      <label for="lakmmw3" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s kind of flawed logic. It depends on where you&rsquo;re at in your development as a team, the value of said picks and how good you are at drafting.</p>

<p>Lastly teams The pistons and wizards are bad bc they don&rsquo;t know how to draft.</p>

<p>In 2022 the wizards could&rsquo;ve drafted jalen Williams, mark Williams or jalen duren</p>

<p>They also don&rsquo;t know how to develop talent. The draft is the single best method to building an NBA champion foundation meaning finding your best player. OKc and boston are not miracles they&rsquo;re the norm. The miracle is the 2008 Celtics or the 2004 pistons where trades and finding guys you didn&rsquo;t draft is able to put it together for a title. Most top NBA teams and dynasties are built thru the draft</p>

<p>You think the Nets would have preferred that he just didn’t sign with them and instead left in free agency? They would rather have nothing instead of 10 first round picks?</p>

<p>It is so stupid. Every team would love to have a star sign and then demand a trade over just leaving when a contract is up.</p>

      <label for="lajyttb" class="commentText"><p>I mean, the trade worked out for nets in the end. They got a total of 16+ picks between him, harden and kyrie and probably more considering they have their own in 2030 etc.</p>

<p>Only fans of said team can truly answer for what’s best for them. I’m sure OKC fans aren’t complaining that PG got them Shai and all those picks that turned into some good assets like Jdub</p>

      <label for="laknblj" class="commentText"><p>Your logic is wrong. The team isn’t “getting nothing” by not wanting to trade, they’re getting those years of the star player actually playing on the team. What they’re paying the player to do per his contract. As opposed to not having a star player on the team and waiting for picks 2,3,4 years out that may not even be any good.</p>

<p>Your situation is only true when the star is demanding a trade in the last season of their contract. Durant still had 2 years left on his contract when he demanded the trade. All those picks they got for him are the consolation for basically giving up on those seasons. That doesn’t even get into the impact that not having a star player does to revenue generation and team value.</p>

      <label for="lakqlld" class="commentText"><p>You are assuming the alternative to a player signing a contract with their existing team and then requesting a trade is to sign the contract and stay the whole time.</p>

<p>My point is that wasn’t usually the alternative; the alternative was not signing with the team at all, and just leaving as a free agent, leaving the old team with nothing.</p>

<p>The biggest stars used to just leave in free agency. The last year of a star players contract was so tense for the team; do we trade the player now in the last year of his contract so we get SOMETHING back, or do we play out the year and hope they re-sign next year. Think of the Cavs in 2009-10… they thought they could keep LeBron, so they didn’t trade him that year, and ended up with nothing.</p>

<p>If a team didn’t think they could re-sign their star (like the Wolves with KG in 07), they would trade them with a year left (losing a year of the player, and not getting as much back as modern teams do because they only have a year left on the contract and the NEW team has to worry they will just leave them too).</p>

<p>Now, teams don’t have to trade a star in the last year, and they don’t have to worry they will leave for nothing, because the max contract guys almost always stay with their current team to get the max money. They can then just ask for a trade in a year.</p>

<p>This is WAY better for the star’s original team. They either get the player or they get a huge haul from a trade. They are rarely left with nothing anymore. You don’t see teams end up like the Cavs in 2010 anymore.</p>

<p>Just ask who you would rather be… OKC when Durant left and they got nothing, or Brooklyn who got 8 first round picks when Durant decided to leave.</p>

      <label for="laksffc" class="commentText"><p>I agree that it makes sense to do it when it’s in the last year of their contract. I ended my post with exactly that stipulation. I don’t agree that it’s something teams should be grateful for when it occurs before the last year of the contract.</p>

<p>Your comparison of 2016 OKC and 2023 Brooklyn isn’t apples to apples. Because Durant did play for those last two years of his OKC contract, and he made them contenders in the west in 2016, nearly knocking off GS. Those years for them alone did wonders for their brand. You should be comparing Brooklyn to a hypothetical 2014 OKC that lost Durant that year and had two garbage seasons in 14-15 and 15-16. The way you framed it, I’d pick OKC’s situation 10 out of 10 times. You’re treating both situations only from the perspective of the ends of the player’s tenure at the team, but you should be treating it from the perspective of the end of the contracts. In Brooklyn’s case, the picks are to account for the loss of having KD spend those years under contract with them.</p>

<p>Think about it this way; would OKC rather Durant have done what he did (leave OKC for GS in 2016), or have signed a max extension with OKC in 2016 but asked for a trade in 2017?</p>

<p>No one should try to learn from Boston/OKC lmao.</p>

<p>Presti and Ainge are far and away the EXCEPTION, not the rule.</p>

<p>The 76ers drafted 3rd, 1st and 1st in three consecutive years and ended up with Jahlil Okafor, Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz.</p>

<p>The Wizards and Pistons burn lottery picks year after year after year with no discernible path to becoming meaningfully better.</p>

<p>No one has any idea how good the Knicks will be in 2029 or 2031. Even if the Nets get 4 late 1st rounders</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it is. The overwhelming majority of late 1st rounds never become anything close to meaningful NBA Contributors.</p>

<p>The absolute best thing you can do with draft picks in the NBA is trade them for established players.</p>

<p>This is probably the most moronic thing I&rsquo;ve read today and I can&rsquo;t believe no one pointed it out yet.</p>

<p>2024 NBA champs: Celtics. Both top players were drafted</p>

<p>2023 NBA champs: Nuggets. Both top players were drafted</p>

<p>2022 NBA champs: Warriors. Same core as the dynasty, all drafted.</p>

<p>2021 NBA champs: Bucks. Top player was drafted</p>

<p>And you still think the best thing to do with draft picks in the NBA is trade them away lmfao</p>

      <label for="lakgdq3" class="commentText"><p>At the end of the day it&rsquo;s a lot easier for nets fans to find the value in drafting when it&rsquo;s one of our teams strongest points. Last year we didn&rsquo;t have any early picks and I still think we did amazing and will have a lot of solid players from it down the line. Some teams, dare I say most, simply do not have that luxury.</p>

      <label for="lakyfpk" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, the disparity in how people rate success in &ldquo;rebuilding&rdquo; (the demolishing part) and winning is so striking to me.</p>

<p>Rebuild: oh wow, they are losing games and have draft picks, what a fantastic achievement! This is definitely succeeding.</p>

<p>Trying to win: oh man, this team AGAIN didn&rsquo;t even make the finals! This is not a title-winning team, so what are they even pretending for instead of demolishing this god-forsaken roster? What a gigantic failure, everyone involved is a loser, choker and floor-somethig&hellip; this is going nowhere, what a sad, hopeless organization where everybody managing is fine with lack of success because they are such sad little men with no ambition, you should either win the NBA title or rebuild dude.</p>

<p>When in fact we can see so many times in history for 100% easy fact that a road from having a lot of picks to winning the championship and &ldquo;not being a failure&rdquo; is soooooo long and unpredictable&hellip;</p>

      <label for="lal1uih" class="commentText"><p>umm I think a lot of it depends on what you do to get there, that creates where your barometer for &ldquo;success&rdquo; lies.</p>

<p>like look at the Knicks. they never had any real top picks (I think the highest they ever drafted was #4), never REALLY tanked, they just sucked despite their best efforts to not suck&hellip;. but they clawed their way out from being the LOLKnicks to being 1 of the most fun/exciting/interesting teams in the league for the past 2 years, and they project to continue to be fun/exciting/interesting for several more years to come</p>

<p>even if this group never wins a championship I would 100% consider this rebuild and this era of Knicks basketball to have been a success, largely because of how bad they were the prior 10-15 years and the path they took to get here</p>

<p>on the other hand, take the 76ers&hellip; they tanked so aggressively for 3 straight years the NBA had to intervene&hellip; they drafted #3, #1, #1 in 3 consecutive drafts and blew all 3 picks&hellip; (they literally could have had Jaylen and Tatum next to Embiid lol)&hellip;</p>

<p>so despite having had similar post-season success to the Knicks, its hard to call them anything but a failure</p>

      <label for="lajpne8" class="commentText"><p>It’s a double masterstroke - this Knicks still have numerous firsts over these coming years - and their own firsts are likely to be back end of the draft, especially in the first few years.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Leon Rose gets arguably the player with the best possible fit for the team in terms of skills and role… and that’s without even considering the VillaVibes&trade;, for a team that’s nearing the hard cap limiting what they can do in coming years (or months).</p>

<p>The Nets leveraged that player to the hilt and have Nikes mediocrity for a rocket ship rebuild.</p>

<p>The Knicks leveraged a huge glut of picks - and then got a ton of much lower cost and lower risk second rounders.</p>

<p>The Nets got the results of a fleecing but the Knicks hugely improved a roster that went from
Scrappy contender to one of the better if not top 2-3 rosters in the league when combined with their style of play, philosophy, and coaching… without mortgaging their future.</p>

<p>Either Rockets swap their picks or the Nets make a run at a player like Trae Young and are stuck as a play-in team for the next couple of years and the picks fall at the end of the lottery. I think the late Phoenix picks are much more valuable compared to that. Seems like a win-win for all teams involved.</p>

<p>This is why rebuilding teams never win this award because it doesn&rsquo;t matter how many picks you have if you just draft a bunch of James Wisemans.</p>

<p>I think it was pretty telling that this off-season at least 4 or 5 fanbases all had mikal as their #1 wish this off-season.  He may have been the most sought after player, resulting in an increased price.  </p>

So yea&ndash;maybe we overpaid by a pick or so but would rather that than trade a young core player to get him.</p>

      <label for="lajv9e2" class="commentText"><p>Donovan Mitchell went for 3 firsts, 2 swaps, and Lauri Markannen - a player who by himself is going to fetch Utah at least <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> firsts if/when they move him. That&rsquo;s way more than we paid for Bridges.</p>

      <label for="lajw00x" class="commentText"><p>Bridges went for 5 firsts and 1 swap and a worse player. Bridges got more picks and a worse player, Mitchell got less picks and a better player. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s &ldquo;way more&rdquo;</p>

<p>And while I would say Markannen isn&rsquo;t going to fetch <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> firsts, the Knicks kinda set a precedent for overpaying for role players so maybe he might actually get that much lol</p>

      <label for="lajwn8p" class="commentText"><p>Not at all, you can&rsquo;t just compare Bojan and Lauri as &lsquo;better/worse players&rsquo; and hand wave that away. Lauri is a premium young asset, Bojan is 35 year old salary filler. That is not remotely the same. Even Collin Sexton is a better asset than Bojan but I didn&rsquo;t even bother including him in the Mitchell deal because he was mostly irrelevant, just like Bojan is.</p>

<p>And Lauri was always going to get at LEAST 5 first round picks. He&rsquo;s a 27 year old all star and one of the best floor stretching bigs in the league, not some &lsquo;role player&rsquo;.</p>

      <label for="lakvvtl" class="commentText"><p>Memphis drafted 9th this year.  The Nets pick ended up being # 3 this year.  Guarantee the Rockets didn&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d get that high of a pick this year.  We all thought Giannis was indestructible.</p>

<p>Stuff happens.  Brunson and Bridges are pretty durable, but you never know.  Maybe in a year the team chafes under Thibs - its not like that would be unprecedented.  I think the Knicks should be good over the next five years (and I hate the Knicks), but it isn&rsquo;t a guarantee.</p>

<p>Just like we all think those Suns picks should be good.  However, Ishbia seems like a maniac willing to spend the money.  Maybe in three years Phoenix is just mediocre instead of bad - then those picks don&rsquo;t have as much value.</p>

It&rsquo;s going to go to one of the teams at the top of the standings that made some important moves this offseason. They&rsquo;re not going to give it to a bottom 3 team in the east.</p>

<p>If they were ever gonna do something like this they would&rsquo;ve given it to Ainge in 22-23 when it looked like the Wolves overpaid for Gobert and the Jazz were better than expected at the same time. But they gave it to the Kings exec for actually having a high seed.</p>

They got a great return but they’re going to suck in the short term and if they whiff on most of those picks then what did it all really amount to.</p>

<p>It’s a lot easier for voters to look at a team like the Celtics that made a couple great trades to get better and then win 64 games for EOTY.</p>

      <label for="lako238" class="commentText"><p>Tbf I think if there was an aggregate  &ldquo;executive of a multi-year stretch&rdquo; award then he absolutely should have won it for his first 3 years here (which culminated in the DLo/Dancing Bench 2019 Nets). But within that time frame, I dont think there was any one year where he stood out. He was losing the award to  Bob Myers (who literally added Kd to a 73 win team), Morey (built a 65 win team, highlighted by his trade for CP3), and Hammond (who built a 60 win team). Cant really get mad at losing any of these in particular. But over that whole 3 year stretch, given the circumstances he had to work with, he definitely was the most impressive, considering the circumstances he was dealt.</p>

<p>The nets would&rsquo;ve been shit regardless of what happened with Bridges, and this article is talking about how they got so much more than anyone expected out of a role player in terms of assets, and genuinely set the nets up nicely for a rebuild just like OKC did</p>

<p>i&rsquo;m reacting to the claim that sean marks should win executive of the year.  trading your best player for future picks isn&rsquo;t some great accomplishment. if the hits in the draft or swings another big trade w those picks to make the team competitive, then i&rsquo;m fine with him getting praise.</p>

<p>comparing marks to presti in this situation is very generous.  what presti did was impressive because of the team he built not because he got lots of picks.  i feel like most of their good players they just drafted from the lottery because they&rsquo;ve been bad&hellip; its not like the clippers picks have been awesome.</p>

<p>i also think as a nets fan turning around and calling mikal a role player is serious cope when he&rsquo;s been the nets best player the whole time he&rsquo;s been there.  he&rsquo;s awesome and was already a key guy on a contender before.</p>

<p>Look at his stats last year, especially the 2nd half post all star break. He 100% wasn&rsquo;t our best player lol Cam Thomas was. Idk why it&rsquo;s hard to except that Bridges is a role player. Isn&rsquo;t that what the knicks traded him to be?</p>

      <label for="lak5ujb" class="commentText"><p>Not sure this is “executive of the year” stuff. The Knicks’ existing Villanova contingent meant that Bridges was more valuable to them than just about anyone else. No doubt the Knicks players with the most pull were all pulling for them to get this done. (Never mind that Jalen’s dad also assistant-coaches the team and probably agreed with this.) The Knicks are also high on their unexpected success this past season after so many years of disappointment. They’re going all-in and willing to sacrifice mid-to-long-term results for short-term gains. So I think this has more to do with the particular circumstances of the Knicks than any brilliance by Nets management.</p>
