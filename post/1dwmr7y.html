      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dwmr7y/european_offensive_mastermind_tuomas_iisalo_to/"><p>European offensive mastermind Tuomas Iisalo to sign a three-year deal with the Grizzlies as a top assistant coach. Iisalo took Paris to the Euroleague the past season, by winning the Eurocup title with the greatest offensive rating of all time (126.8)</p>
</a>
    </h2>

      <p><a href="https://x.com/urbodo/status/1809507749169909932?s=46" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<p>Iisalo took over the recently founded club from the French capital before the start of the past season and managed to lead them to the Eurocup (second tier European continential club competition) title and the French league finals, where they lost to Euroleague powerhouse Monaco, in a historic season.</p>

<p>He did this with an offensive rating of 126.8, which is by far the greatest offensive rating of all time, even when compared to NBA teams.</p>

<p>Iisalo&rsquo;s offense included pushing the tempo whenever they could, and a variety of different types of screens when they were in a halfcourt set (slip screens, Gortat screens, Varejao screens etc.). A detailed analysis of his offense the past season can be seen <a href="https://youtu.be/LczeVbPYVXM?si=qCu9tqXPBb1_4uGr" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>The 41-year-old Finnish expert won the FIBA Champions League (third tier European continetial club competition) the season prior with German club Bonn.</p>

<p>There were reports that he&rsquo;s expected to join the Wizards coaching staff, but the Grizzlies beat them out.</p>

<p>Paris will be playing in the Euroleague next season, and one of the main candidates to replace Iisalo on the Paris bench is Petar Bozic, the former Austin Spurs head coach.</p>

      <label for="lbvtwbr" class="commentText"><p>I think failures of players like Vezenkov and Teodosic in the NBA isn&rsquo;t so much to do with them being from European systems, it&rsquo;s just that it didn&rsquo;t work out for them. You can look at them and say these transitions can fail, but you can also look at all the successful European players, and coaches like Darko Rajakovic, and say it can work out. People were high on Vezenkov and his first season was unimpressive, but people were also high on Doncic and he was ROTY.</p>

<p>Or, since Luka was so young when he entered the NBA, maybe you&rsquo;d want to pick some more Vezenkov-esque example who was older and perhaps more used to the European ways, like Toni Kukoc for example.</p>

<p>But that said, bringing up Vezenkov is still I think a moot point. I&rsquo;d guess the point of bringing over a European coach like Iisalo is for him to bring the &ldquo;European ways&rdquo; over with him, not necessarily for him to adapt to the NBA ways. It&rsquo;s more about wether he has the communication skills to express his ideas to the players and other coaches, and that I think is the main crux with coaches that speak English as a second or third language in the NBA. I&rsquo;m saying that as somebody who isn&rsquo;t a native speaker, just to be clear.</p>

<p>Some top European coaches like Ergin Ataman and Chus Mateo know English, but aren&rsquo;t the best at it, they know enough to get their point accross obviously, but I can understand the language barrier posing a problem (I think Chus Mateo talks in Spanish during the timeouts, but I might be mistaken). Iisalo doesn&rsquo;t have that kind of problem.</p>

<p>Absolutely this! But, he has coached abroad for quite some time and has had to use English (and I imagine perhaps German) already, and has been successful while doing it.</p>

      <label for="lbvv4wt" class="commentText"><p>Is Darko considered a success? He&rsquo;s had one season where he&rsquo;s led a non-competitive roster to 25 wins, so the jury&rsquo;s still out on whether he is a good coach. Like you said about Luka, he came into the league young, before all of his habits were set. Rubio also came over young and had a pretty solid career, but didn&rsquo;t really become a star because he never developed a consistent jumper. Kukoc was effective in the NBA, but not the star he was in Europe. He also seems like the most forgotten Bull from that dynasty. It&rsquo;s also not just the language differences, but the cultural ones that can make the transition difficult.</p>

<p>Yea I think this is spot on.  David Blatt was literally born here and spoke all the english anyone needed but failed to assimilate to the nba culture and burned out quick because of it.</p>

      <label for="lbw21fe" class="commentText"><p>Sure but especially knowing now all we know about kyrie, he would have failed even more spectacularly if that were the case.  At least now people can point to his win/loss record and pretend that he was successful and a victim of circumstances instead of a stubborn ego maniac that couldn&rsquo;t adapt to a new league and it&rsquo;s culture.</p>

      <label for="lbwd1l9" class="commentText"><p>Sometimes players come from a European league and aren&rsquo;t good in the NBA, sometimes players come out of college and aren&rsquo;t good in the NBA. I don&rsquo;t understand how Sasha Vezenkov&rsquo;s NBA performance makes you feel anything about the hiring of a Finnish coach from a French team.</p>
