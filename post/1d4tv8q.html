<p>Like at the start of the Russian invasion they said it&rsquo;s because Ukraine is a Nazi state and Russia was actually the good guys.</p>

<p>Now they&rsquo;re sharing memes about how this was a Biden operation to get Russia to attack Ukraine.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s literally playing chess against the pigeon who shits on the board. Consistency doesn&rsquo;t matter, facts don&rsquo;t matter (e.g. &ldquo;this is the first time Trump has been to court&rdquo;), nothing matters except owning the libs.</p>

<p>I also don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll get jail unfortunately, some articles are saying it&rsquo;s not unprecedented for an older person to have jail time waived for crimes like this so I&rsquo;m not even sure it&rsquo;d be special treatment.

<p>You can prove that this, specifically, applies to conservatives but not anyone on the left or moderates.  <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/bby6bt/pompeo_flounders_on_why_annexation_is_good_for/ekn25jp/" target="_blank">This comment I have saved.</a>  It&rsquo;s old, but any time you poll liberals/conservatives on a specific issue and then re-poll them when power changes hands, the result is the same.</p>

<p>Conservatives change their mind based on who is in power.  Liberals minds are made up by their moral compass and are largely not affected by who is in power.</p>

<p>It did not matter if he told people he dident.</p>

<p>The issue was: he paid money to a lawyer, listed as lawyer fees on his reporting documents, without a retainer contract in effect. This is a Felony in NY. Then he told other people on record about the money he wanted to pay to have it go away, he had a for profit media owner suppress stories that woudl have made the media company money. This created violation to campaign rules in NY. Sleeping with Stormy has nothing to do with it at all.</p>

(I&rsquo;ve seen folks on the right bringing up that Clinton also paid hush money in the past.) What matters is what you said: he violated campaign finance laws while doing it.</p>

<p>The media calling this a &ldquo;hush money case&rdquo; instead of a &ldquo;campaign finance fraud case&rdquo; did a real disservice to the American people at large in defining this case&rsquo;s legal magnitude and oversimplified a pretty complicated and (poorly) thought out criminal enterprise.</p>

      <label for="l6i5coc" class="commentText"><p>What’s funny is that if he had successfully convinced the jury that he paid hush money to prevent his wife from finding out, he would’ve walked.</p>

<p>The only actual crime here was found in the intent of influencing the election.</p>

<p>12 people sat in a room with him and saw evidence that clearly dictated that he paid the money to prevent information from affecting the election, and that’s it. That’s the crime.</p>

<p>My mind boggling that people can’t just see that. Jurors had every opportunity to be convinced of very possible reasons for him paying it, and it was blatantly, clearly obvious why he did.</p>

<p>It is illegal to pay them during an election <em>and not report it.</em>  And then falisfy records to cover up that&rsquo;s what you did.  34 times.</p>

      <label for="l6hr69r" class="commentText"><p>but it IS an issue because in court, and during the trial in general, trump (and iirc his defense team) both disputed/denied that the sex even occurred.</p>

<p>yes, it&rsquo;s legally irrelevant to the illegality of the payments, but it&rsquo;s important because they <em>did</em> try to just blatantly out-and-out lie about it too.</p>

      <label for="l6htuhb" class="commentText"><p>i disagree, not for reasons of legality (trump was convicted after all), but because unlike &ldquo;a murderer,&rdquo; claiming that in any given trial, Trump has legions of sycophants who pick this stuff
up and run with it.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s important because like this thread is mostly saying, it is <em>abundantly</em> clear that Trump had sex with Stormy Daniels, and yet, a shocking number of people are parroting information that should simply not be in dispute.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a really clear symptom of just how &ldquo;post truth&rdquo; we are and how deep our crisis of epistemology is.</p>

This jury went through the usual approval process which means they were selected with a lot of input from the defense team. The trial was in NY State, which is a place that cast over 3,250,000 ballots for Trump in 2020&hellip;don&rsquo;t let them gaslight people into this whole &ldquo;NY witchhunt!&rdquo; bullshit because NY has a SHITLOAD of Trump voters, and this was a jury trial.</p>

<p>Even Manhattan, the most anti-Trump district, still had almost 13% of people voting for Trump. That means more than 1 in 8 people in New York City proper is a Trump voter&hellip;so there were absolutely multiple Trump voters on that jury, because they would have been selecting for that.</p>

<p>All it would take is one of the defense-approved jury members to disagree with his guilt and it would be all over.</p>

<p>Not a single one of them could bring themselves to call him innocent on a single one of the 34 felony charges.</p>

<p>Fun side fact, the FBI was actually monitoring DJT by happenstance because he kept talking to known and suspected foreign agents. Clinton was guilty of the poor electronic practice that a literal majority (&amp;gt;50%) of congress members at the time employed (everyone wasn&rsquo;t keeping to the new rules, old politicians bad at tech). Trump was suspected of being a patsy (or traitor I guess, motive pending) to other nations.</p>

      <label for="l6h0jbx" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s lost so many cases. Prior to being president he was known for hiring &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; workers (read: undocumented) and then stiffing them while threatening to have them deported. He ended up paying out a settlement in 1998 to Polish workers who decided to pursue legal action anyway. This is by far not the only story out there, but the most well known since they were willing to use the US government to recoup their losses.</p>

<p>The case started in 1980&hellip;.. he delayed in court almost 2 decades to end up paying them out anyway. The project they were hired for? Trump Tower.</p>

<p>NY has been trying to warn people about him for years. People who have actually had to deal with him do not look favorably on him.</p>

      <label for="l6gy2at" class="commentText"><p>It’s true. Trump is an asshole who has never had to suffer consequence for his behavior. He’s been criming since the 80s. Really the 70s if you count not renting apartments to blacks people when his daddy was still running things.</p>

<p>The 80s was when he started laundering money for Russian mobsters though. Never suffered a whit for it. Bankrupted those casinos. Never suffered a consequence.</p>

<p>But believe nothing that comes from Trump and his people. Everything they say is a lie. Everything they do is an illusion. O don’t even believe that the website crashed for the half hour they say it did. They can absolutely not be trusted.</p>

<p>We see what they try and pull with his rallies. 100 thousand people showed up to hear Trump babble about windmills? Again? GTFO. 30,000 Bronx residents showed up to hear him speak? GTFO.</p>

<p>They just make shit up to make him seem more popular. Don’t believe the polls. Don’t believe the media. Don’t believe his campaign. It’s all an illusion. They talk about him being bullet proof or Teflon, but every time he goes to court, he’s guilty. The only thing he’s been good at is delaying trials, and if it weren’t for corrupt judges? He’d have no luck at all.</p>

<p>TlDR: Believe nothing trump or his people say, anywhere they say it. He’s even doing “Dark” Maga stuff apparently. Can’t even come up with original ideas to fight sleepy old mastermind Joe.</p>

<p>It’s easy to lie cheat and steal when you’re not trying to run for president. When you want to be that guy? People are gonna ask questions. You might even be held responsible for crimes you’ve been committing your whole life because you think nobody will care.</p>

<p>Trumps whole campaign is a TV show. It’s as real as reality TV. Biden is gonna beat him again. And once we get the illegal immigrants to vote? Trump will lose by billions! Can’t wait to rig it again!</p>

<p>No. Because it&rsquo;s not about Trump. Trump is just the vehicle by which these voters want to enact their hateful policies. They truly do not care about the man. He&rsquo;s a symbol of every hateful thing they wish to impose on the people they see as destroying their version of United States, and THAT is what they truly wish to see in power. Hatred and vitriol.</p>

<p>If this were the case then one of his many imitators like DeSantis should&rsquo;ve been able to take the reins once Trumps liabilities started piling up. Even some of his most ardent bootlickers like Boebert and MTG are at risk of losing their seats, but many Republican voters are still &ldquo;Trump or bust&rdquo;. I think you&rsquo;re underestimating the effect a 30+ year parasocial relationship and Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;brand image&rdquo; has.

<p>He didn&rsquo;t forget, it&rsquo;s part of his plan. Badmouth the judge, then when we gets sentenced, use the fact that he badmouthed the judge to claim the judge is biased against him and appeal the sentencing.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s likely to get house arrest based on legal analysts I&rsquo;ve heard. Too many are over confidently saying probation and I&rsquo;m skeptical. Either way, this isn&rsquo;t the gotcha case we wanted where he&rsquo;s locked away for life. This is just absolute, definitive proof that Trump is a criminal and a liar and a fraud. He cheated to get elected in 2016 (my bad!).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the fascists are ok with that. They don&rsquo;t care that he cheats and lies. They don&rsquo;t care that he loves dictators. They don&rsquo;t care about his dehumanizing language or authoritarian tendencies or his open calls for political violence.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re too busy transforming into 1930s Germans right before our eyes because ultra right wing nationalism is a cancer.</p>

<p>2016 called, they want their prescient comparisons back. Trump&rsquo;s <strong>original</strong> campaign was literally on the basis of &ldquo;I will be the second coming of Hitler, vote for me if you hate anyone who isn&rsquo;t a white straight cis male&rdquo;. The only campaign promises he put any fervor into were the blatantly nazi-aligned ones.</p>

He&rsquo;s never had to sit quietly for that long before. He&rsquo;s embarrassed and afraid.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s been barred from NYC business. He&rsquo;s facing likely house arrest. But the worst potential outcome of this particular trial is that it has the predicted effect on independent voters.

      <label for="l6h51k2" class="commentText"><p>Just remember, Trump is a raging narcissist. The best way to make him suffer and experience pain is to ignore him. The best case scenario is that he&rsquo;s roundly crushed in the upcoming election and we collectively realize he&rsquo;s a fucking loser POS and he slips into obscurity. It&rsquo;s hard to stay rational about this, but that&rsquo;s the long game. We want him to die alone, needy, reflecting on how badly his marred his father&rsquo;s legacy and how much of a loser he is</p>

      <label for="l6i30fo" class="commentText"><p>To add to this, the reality of the situation is that Trump will always have his loyal base of followers who truly don&rsquo;t give a shit at all about anything other than hurting the people they don&rsquo;t like and Trump will always be their God. It really sucks that he brought to light how many just purely amoral pieces of shit there are in the country parading around as decent human beings, but it is what it is. You&rsquo;re right, in the short term we need to hope that that demographic continues to be a loud and violent minority, and the November election goes just as poorly for Republicans as the midterms did.</p>

<p>The number one thing that might stand in the way is that at the end of the day, Republicans are loyal to a fault. They are excellent at falling in line no matter how much it hurts their own self-interests or goes against their supposed morals.  That said though, the powers that be on the right also do not hesitate to eat their own and turn on anyone who proves to be no longer useful. Hell, Trump is the undisputed master of it. I think they know Trump has outlived his usefulness, but he continues to embolden his loyal disciples and poison our democracy and judicial system, so it makes sense to ride it out through November in hopes that he does as much damage to America and faith in our institutions as possible in the time given. Again, if he does indeed get crushed in November, which who the hell knows, it&rsquo;s still terrifyingly close, but let&rsquo;s hope and dream that happens, I can absolutely see the RNC as a whole dropping him like useless bag of shit he is and leave him to cry into the ether about stolen this, everyone&rsquo;s mean to me that, while they find a new huckster to trick uneducated people in small towns to give up their money and freedoms to make the guys at the top as rich and powerful as possible.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s just my wishful thinking, but the next few months are going to be insane and it&rsquo;s only going to get worse from here, I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>

Greg Sargent is usually insightful, but this is an elderly, incontinent man who slept through his trial and didn&rsquo;t much bother to defend himself against the charges.
