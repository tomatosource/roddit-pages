      <label for="l9xpnlf" class="commentText"><p>They really hadn&rsquo;t settled on a shot form by this time. Kenny Sailors, who is credited with the modern jump shot form, played in the NBA from 1947-1951.</p>

<p>At Mikan&rsquo;s time there were several different shot forms that players were expected to practice and master.</p>

<p>Drs. Allen and Naismith produced a film in ~1941 at KU titled <em><a href="https://digital.lib.ku.edu/ku-video/39" target="_blank">Modern Basketball Fundamentals</a></em>, and in it they go through various types of shooting forms (in slow motion), including:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Push Shot</li>
<li>Free Throw (which they demonstrated as shooting it granny style)</li>
<li>Hook Shot</li>
<li>Two-Hand Overhead Shot</li>
<li>One-Hand &ldquo;English&rdquo; Shot</li>
<li>The Lay-in</li>
</ul>

<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of different shooting techniques a player was expected to learn, practice, and master.</p>

      <label for="l9xxc86" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I enjoy reading some of the old, pre-NBA interviews and newspaper clippings that get posted on /r/VintageNBA that talk about the invention of things we take for granted today. There was one post with an interview from one of The Original Celtics players talking about a barnstorming game they were playing in Kentucky when they happened to discover/invent the pick and roll organically during a play. Basically the, &ldquo;Pass to the big on the elbow, then have the passer cut to the basket and the big throw it back to the cutter for a layup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a timeout a short while later and they were in the TO saying, &ldquo;Whoa, that thing we just did, let&rsquo;s try that again,&rdquo; lol.</p>

      <label for="l9y88rx" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re right, it was discovering/inventing the &ldquo;give and go.&rdquo; Or at least, that&rsquo;s how it sounded to me.</p>

<p>Per this /r/VintageNBA post, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/m523pf/all_of_the_inventors_of_basketball/" target="_blank">All the Inventions of Basketball</a>, there&rsquo;s this entry:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Give-and-Go:</strong> Nat Holman, <em>head basketball coach at the City College of New York and guard for the Germantown Geraniums, also played for the Hoboken Hobs, Bridgeport Blue Ribbons, Jersey City Skeeters, Scranton Miners, Albany Senators, Westfield Whip City Athletic Club, New York Original Celtics, Atlantic City Sandpipers, New York Hakoahs, Syracuse All-Americans, and Chicago Bruins and head coach of the Atlantic City Sandpipers and New York Hakoahs (circa 1919)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, the article I was thinking about was from this post: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/14x88ty/what_was_the_pivot_play/" target="_blank">What was &ldquo;the pivot play?&rdquo;</a>. In short, the Original Celtic member referred to it as &ldquo;the pivot play,&rdquo; but it sounds like they were describing a give &amp; go. This quote is from Dutch Dehnert, one of the Original Celtics:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the timeout, Beckman said, ‘We’ll have to move that guard out of there. He’s breaking up our passes when we cut.’ Then I volunteered to stand in front of him, explaining that instead of him breaking up our passes, they could pass to me, and I could give it back.</p>

<p>When play was resumed, I moved up in front of this fellow. Beckman passed to me and I passed to Borgeman, who was coming in from the other side. Then Barry passed to me, kept coming, and I passed right back to him. All of a sudden, a great light dawned, and I took time out.</p>

<p>We all went into a huddle and discussed the possibilities of this maneuver that we had accidentally hit on. Beckman was enthusiastic, and we knew if Beckie liked it we had something, because Johnny was the smartest man who ever played basketball.</p>

<p>This was the pivot play, but we didn’t even know it at the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although Nat Holman, who was an Original Celtic and (as aforementioned) is credited with inventing the Give &amp; Go, was injured and not at that game. Plus the game discussed above was in 1926 and the credit for inventing the give &amp; go is from 1919, so who knows. Furthermore, the play in question was referred to as &ldquo;the pivot play,&rdquo; but it sounds a lot like a give and go to me. /shrug</p>

      <label for="l9zbcz6" class="commentText"><p>right. it looks like a bunch of grown athletes playing modern middle school style basketball, in terms of how hectic and weird it is. however you can still tell they&rsquo;re athletic</p>

<p>all this talk about athletes today vs back then, but the bigger gap by far is how our knowledge of the game has evolved. you could teach mikan to play the modern game and be a huge star if he went through a time portal at age 18; you can&rsquo;t teach <em>anyone</em> to be a fluid/nimble 6&rsquo;10 athlete at his level unless they&rsquo;re already 6&rsquo;10 and athletic</p>

<p>he&rsquo;s basically the 50&rsquo;s basketball version of &ldquo;i&rsquo;m closer to LeBron than any of ya&rsquo;ll are to me&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l9xi68a" class="commentText"><p>Idk. You can see a couple instances in this video of chaos in the lane that would not fly by today&rsquo;s standards. &ldquo;Barrelling into each other full speed&rdquo; was the wrong phrase. But any time I watch these old clips I&rsquo;m struck by how nobody bats an eye at shoves and elbows around the basket.</p>

<p>For example, a guard squarely runs into Mikan at 00:55 here and no one seems to care. And at 1:08 there are 4 guys bludgeoning each other for a rebound. The rebound in particular would be a 6 minute review to see if there was a flagrant in today&rsquo;s game. Not even a whistle in this clip.</p>

<p>Definitely the case in the 50s. It&rsquo;s funny how this ebbs and flows. Watching games from the 70s, there is so little contact at all it&rsquo;s actually funny to watch. Defenders basically didn&rsquo;t play any defense outside of the key and the refs called the game insanely tight.</p>

<p>Then, back in the 80s, they were back to being very physical.</p>

<p>Thats why there are so many unbreakable raw stat records (mostly Wilt). There aren&rsquo;t enough possessions today for a player to score that much. Several players have actually outpaced Wilt&rsquo;s 50PPG year if you account for possessions or just % of teams points scored.</p>

<p>People all know that Red Auerbach introduced the fast break</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true.</p>

<p>Per the /r/VintageNBA post <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/m523pf/all_of_the_inventors_of_basketball/" target="_blank">All of The Inventors of Basketball</a>, it was invented by &ldquo;<strong>Ed Wachter</strong>, <em>center for the Ware Wonders, later played for the Haverhill Five, Lowell Lowells, McKeesport Tubers, Troy Trojans, Utica Utes, Kingston Colonials, Hudson County Five, Springfield Fisk Red Tops, Albany Senators, Cohoes Cohosiers, and Adams Five (circa 1903)</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>A 1978 <em>Sports Illustrated</em> article <a href="https://vault.si.com/vault/1978/11/27/yesterday-keaney-invented-the-fast-break-and-rhode-island-made-the-big-time" target="_blank">KEANEY INVENTED THE FAST BREAK AND RHODE ISLAND MADE THE BIG TIME</a>, credits Rhode Island coach Frank Keaney as the inventor. And the Basketball Hall of Fame <a href="https://www.hoophall.com/hall-of-famers/frank-keaney/" target="_blank">credits him as &ldquo;the architect of modern run-and-shoot basketball.&rdquo;</a> He coached at Rhode Island from 1920 through the late 1940s.</p>

<p>And I recently read <em>The Secret Game</em>, which is about the first interracial basketball game played in the South. It happened in 1944 at Duke between the team from North Carolina College for Negroes and the Duke Medical School Basketball Team. Anywho, the North Carolina College team was coached by John McLendon (who was a student at KU under Dr. Naismith and was the first African American to receive a degree in Physical Education from KU, is in the HOF, etc.). He invented the four corners offense and the full-court press. He also heavily employed the fast break from the start at North Carolina and is sometimes credited with its invention, although that claim is a bit murky. FWIW, the Hall of Fame states <a href="https://www.hoophall.com/hall-of-famers/john-mclendon1/" target="_blank">&ldquo;McLendon’s head coaching career started in 1940 at North Carolina Central University where he introduced his full-court press and fast-break basketball.&rdquo;</a> The McLendon Foundation (which may be a wee bit biased), credits him as <a href="https://www.minorityleaders.org/history/biography-of-john-mclendon/" target="_blank">&ldquo;the inventor of basketball’s &lsquo;Fast Break&rsquo;.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>The point being, Red Auerbach did not invent the fast break. It existed in some form perhaps as early as 1903, and most definitely by the early 1940s, and was well in place when Red was still coaching high school.</p>

      <label for="l9ws6be" class="commentText"><p>From what I’ve read, it seems like there was a big difference between Mikan at the start and end of his career, because it was a very physical game before the shot clock. Teams would hold the ball with the lead, and the opponent basically tried to beat them up.</p>

<p>Mikan retired in 54 because “he had fractured both of his legs, both feet, a wrist, several fingers, and his nose (numerous times). He had had 166 stitches, suffered from a permanent limp, lost a kneecap, and could not straighten his arms fully”.</p>

<p>Bob Cousy has also said he never could have played as long as he did if things kept going the way they were with physicality</p>

<p>Edit: Mikan also played the entire 1951 playoffs with a fractured leg, held in place by a metal plate</p>

      <label for="l9xlvqq" class="commentText"><p>Dr. Naismith describes the very first game of basketball thusly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well I didn’t have enough [rules] and that’s where I made my big mistake. The boys began tackling, kicking and punching in the clinches. They ended up in a free-for-all in the middle of the gym floor. Before I could pull them apart, one boy was knocked out, several of them had black eyes and one had a dislocated shoulder. It certainly was murder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Granted, this was back in like 1894, not 1950, but sports like rugby and football were much more rough and tumble back then.</p>

<p>In early pro basketball games (like barnstorming teams in the 1920s), some promoters would promise fans they&rsquo;d see at least one fight on the hardcourt or their money back.</p>

In the early 20th century it was common for double-digit number of football-related deaths to happen each season across the nation&rsquo;s high schools and colleges. Some colleges outright dropped football from their athletic programs due to its violence and danger.</p>

If refs all of a sudden let them carry every single dribble like they do now, these guys were clearly athletic enough to do things guys do today, with some practice.</p>

<p>They wouldnt become Kyrie obviously but they also wouldnt be looking all janky like they do in the clips.</p>

Those questions are always dumb because people don&rsquo;t accept that we either (a) make up a fantasy where players can perfect any skill of the modern era (because we say so, ignoring that even great athletes have differential aptitudes) (b) compare people who essentially played different games for which there is no realistic way to compare them other than relative to the other players who played the same game.</p>

      <label for="l9x0jd7" class="commentText"><p>Okay I&rsquo;ll bite. I don&rsquo;t know if everyone is being facetious on purpose or if they really think JJ Redick meant to say that players in the 50s sucked and were bad at basketball.</p>

<p>His argument, before it got twisted in aggregation media, is that players did not make enough money from playing basketball in that era to be career athletes. So while a couple of stars can sustain a career on basketball earnings, most of the other players in the league have to work a side job between games, or during the off-season, to financially survive. So some of the other players in the league might be literal plumbers and firemen. That&rsquo;s not to say they are bad at basketball.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s a reasonable conclusion that athletes that can fully dedicate themselves to a sport fulfill more of their potential than if they have other financial obligations, and getting to that place was a huge milestone for professional sports in terms of player development.</p>

      <label for="l9x8kfd" class="commentText"><p>I dont.  If being skilled was all it was about Austin Rivers would be a top 25 all time player.  The other side of it is people making half a billion career and are concerned about their celebrity might not have the same drive as somebody who was doing it just for the passion.   How many guys have washed out just because they weren&rsquo;t that driven and got their first paycheck.</p>

<p>Even just athletically, the implication Wilt Chamberlain or Jerry West or whoever would be outclassed athletically if they played in 2020 is just fucking stupid. Like in peoples minds they&rsquo;re thinking LeBron but that&rsquo;s the best of the best. IDK anybody from the 60s is having nightmares they&rsquo;ll have to go up against Duncan Robinson.   </p>

<p>People also say weird stuff about the health habits, like they think the Anchorman jogging joke is real and we discovered exercise and that smoking was bad for you in the 80s.  Smoking weed isn&rsquo;t any better for your lungs than cigarettes, and they knew how to train.  The first baseball player to use performance enhancing drugs was like the 1890s, steroids were common in professional athletics by the late 50s.  The game is different, the culture is different, but we&rsquo;re the same animals. </p>

<p>It was said right after the other guy said Cousy had 29 assists in an NBA game, so let’s be real context matters and it was said in the heat of the moment and it was not only lacking nuance and appreciation on his part for the past era, but Cousy and West mic dropped him afterward and deservedly so</p>

It makes that era sound really bad when you hear stories like how the lowest scoring game ended 19-18 because the Pistons went up on the Lakers and then passed around ran out the clock. Bill Russell&rsquo;s 11 titles is just too hard of a stat to ignore as well. Mikan had monster stats for the era but he had a very short career and a very short prime. You compare that longevity to most other top 10 players and it&rsquo;s hard to ignore how his career looks vs most players in that ranking</p>

<p>Not to mention he was agile enough to maneuver around smaller players instead of barrelling into them.</p>

<p>It might sound just common sense today but there wasn&rsquo;t a big man blueprint for Mikan to follow growing up so he had to figure out a lot of things himself.</p>

      <label for="l9za3qx" class="commentText"><p>The two handed dribble to take a quick step to the basket feels like something that is nearly entirely gone from the game. Lol. I’m not talking about a post player taking a quick dribble to take a step, these are dudes who get the ball in transition right near the basket who take a super fast dribble before going up. Not even taking a full step sometimes.</p>
