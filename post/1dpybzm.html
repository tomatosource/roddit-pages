It is a crazy contract. Scottie Barnes 270 million for 5 years is fucking batshit. There is no way he&rsquo;s worth that&hellip;That&rsquo;s just a nutty contract. I don&rsquo;t agree with it</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>In his Part 1 podcast released yesterday, Bill went in on the Scottie Barnes extension. On top of what he said in the title, he also went on to say Scottie Barnes is not currently a top 50 guy in the league right now and that the Raptors should have waited one more year before giving him the deal. Ryen Russillo seemed liked he agreed with most of what Bill was saying as well, especially the part of waiting one more year before offering the contract</p>

It still blows my mind when players get more than the Garnett 120m(ish) over 6 year contract and that&rsquo;s decades ago by this point. Of course it&rsquo;s gotten higher. My head just cannot compute numbers that high. </p>

<p>2005 changed it into the 25, 30 and 35% of the cap that we still have today.</p>

      <label for="lalbktp" class="commentText"><p>A big reason for that sentiment is that role players and rookies now  get massive contracts too, in the past a lot of people felt superstars like Jordan got big money by being a superstar. Now if a player like barnes got even half the contract he is being given now, he can just call it a career and put no more effort. And often times it has shown on the court- players load managing, taking regular season easy etc.</p>

Prices for games keep going up and you have to pay for 5 different streaming services(kind of exaggerated for my point, but still) to watch games. At some point you gotta think, is everyone is sports really worth this amount of money or is it because they got new ways of nickel and diming fans? Once again not just talking players here as they are owed their fair share, just the amount of money in sports entertainment has gotten over the top, and imo at the expense of fans monetarily and enjoyment wise. </p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>For example, Jaylen Brown didn&rsquo;t get a rookie max in 2020 but he was coming off a year where he averaged 13PPG on ehhhh effeciency and he still got 23% of the cap lol.</p>

      <label for="lal8p1g" class="commentText"><p>Here is the thing. Football has too many people playing the sport to have a chance. In basketball you have to be 6 feet plus to have a chance. That qualifier alone only makes up around one percent in the human population. So the chances of a tall person making the NBA is much higher than an any person making it big in any high paying sports. The gap in pay between the worst NBA player is extremely wide compared to the worst player in the major leagues in any other high paying sports. If you are extremely tall, it would actually be almost financially negligent to not at least try basketball out lol</p>

<p>The gap in pay between the worst NBA player and other major leagues is largely because basketball has relatively few players. There&rsquo;s only 400ish roster spots in the NBA. The 500th best player might find themselves languishing in the g-league. But there&rsquo;s many more in MLB, NFL, NHL, etc. And for association football, yes there&rsquo;s too many people playing, but that&rsquo;s countered by there&rsquo;s so many well supported leagues and teams around the world.</p>

      <label for="lakaj3x" class="commentText"><p>I just think these contracts just completely murder a teams&rsquo; ability to compete. The Raptors were already an awful team with Scottie Barnes on a dirt cheap contract. I know teams are scared to piss of their players, but what exactly is the harm in letting Barnes play another year on his rookie deal? If he balls out again, then the Raptors can just offer him the same 25% max extension the year after the way the Sixers did with Maxey. Restricted Free Agency not being a thing anymore basically destroys the contention hopes of any team that is paying a max contract to someone who isn&rsquo;t a top 25ish guy.</p>

      <label for="lakd6pv" class="commentText"><p>Scottie’s cap hold is way higher because he was the 4th pick and maxey was the 21st. There is simply no point to waiting to give him the contract, especially since he has been the best rookie in his class so far, an all star, and the player they are building the team around. We weren’t truly awful until they traded half the team and scottie/poetl got injured to start the tank. The young core + poetl were around .500 last season and rj and quickley showed plenty of potential when they played.</p>

<p>Scottie’s also 22 and was a top 30 player for the first 3 months of the season, so why wouldn’t you expect him to be top 25 in time?</p>

If that doesn&rsquo;t play out, fine. But he&rsquo;s a young 4th year with ROY and an AS selection under his belt. You don&rsquo;t play around with that. The numbers are shocking but this is the Raptors deciding early they want to see it through with Scottie.</p>

Now, third contracts are a totally different story. They often kill teams because the players decline, get injured more often and just fail to produce: Wall, Westbrook, Beal, Klay, LaVine, Harris, Hayward.</p>

<p>Y&rsquo;all are too cavalier with the term &ldquo;superstar&rdquo;. Cade needs big jumps in his overall game to even become a fringe star. Superstar is a long way off for him.</p>

<p>Then you have a case like Jayson Tatum in 2021 who got fucked over by the Celtics having a down year despite his individual numbers improving and just barely missed All-NBA 3rd team and the 30% max (made 3rd team the year before).</p>

<p>Oh and also the players association would never allow that unless the NBA gave them a massive trade off like increasing the minimum salary and/or MLE.</p>

<p>Jayson Tatum got cooked by it lol he got unlucky enough that his rookie extension coincided with the Celtics having a down season, so despite the fact that he made 2 straight all star games and All-NBA third team the previous year, he missed out on getting 30% of the cap because he didn&rsquo;t make All-NBA that year.</p>

<p>His own individual numbers even improved lmfao he got robbed, he just barely missed out.</p>

      <label for="lal7hoh" class="commentText"><p>I actually thought he was a great podcaster. It&rsquo;s just he&rsquo;s been doing it for 20 years and it&rsquo;s gotten stale. I don&rsquo;t particularly blame him for that, I can&rsquo;t think of content creators that have done it for 20 years that have remained good whether it be musicians or directors or writers. People like Stephen King are just absolute freaks of nature. It&rsquo;s an amazing achievement to even be relevant in this space for 5 years much less 20.</p>

<p>His early BS Reports are great. But back in 2008, he was in his late 30&rsquo;s-early 40&rsquo;s and his 90&rsquo;s references were relevant to the age of his audience at the time. Today he&rsquo;s well over 50 and his 90210 references are just like &ldquo;Grandpa is talking crazy again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unless he makes an All-NBA team, he&rsquo;s only making 25% of the cap</p>

<p>Like, that&rsquo;s solid for one of the top 10 under 25 guys in the NBA</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>For reference, 25% of the cap this year was 34 mil</p>

<p>Not only that, but his percentage cap hit goes DOWN each year more than many past rookie mex extensions due to the TV deal and cap smoothing.</p>

If anything this one will be better than those in recent years since the cap will be rising by more than the raise on the contract, meaning the deal will take up a smaller % of the cap each year.</p>

In the context of the current NBA, it makes sense because that’s how the salary cap and contracts work nowadays.</p>

<p>I wish there was a way to return some of the revenue to fans by way of blackout reductions or lower seat prices for the nose bleeds.</p>

<p>This is just “things were better when I was younger” type mindset. Everyone has an idea of what a max player “should” make and now that role players are making much more than that it’s all of a sudden hard to comprehend lol</p>

      <label for="laku9ya" class="commentText"><p>This is why I think one contract per team should be able to go above the max without impacting the cap by more than a standard max.</p>

<p>Before you say &ldquo;oh then big big market teams will benefit from this&rdquo;, remember, they can only do it for one contract. That means they can&rsquo;t go above the max for another player. If anything, it might help smaller markets get a star since they can offer above a max while a big market team can only offer the standard max if they have a player on said max+ deal.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just weird to me that guys like Scottie are making the same money as legit super stars</p>

<p>If they reduce the contract numbers, it just means more money going into the net worth of the billionaires.</p>

<p>So if there is really going to be a reckoning at some point, it really shouldn&rsquo;t be that the players are making too much money. It should be that there is too much money flowing upward toward billionaires in our economic system.</p>
