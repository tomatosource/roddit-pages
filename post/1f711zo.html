      <label for="ll5i6rp" class="commentText"><p>No way. Michael Jordan jumped really, really high. It was the main thing that obviously set him apart as a player while he was playing and they even made a movie about it and a bunch of famous shoes. Yes he had a ton of other skills and mindset going on, but the jumping was a huge part of his game. For some reason people have forgotten this. He’s the all-time leader among guards in blocks per game for a reason. And in his later career he was feared for one of the worst shots in basketball, which tons of players tried to imitate and were never as good at as he was unless they were like 7 feet tall - the midrange post fade-away.</p>

<p>Nobody could play like Michael Jordan in a big part because nobody with his quickness and explosiveness at his size had his leaping ability, and they still don’t.</p>

<p>Michael Jordan’s competitive drive is a lot, but it’s not that unusual among athletes, not even elite ones. It’s just most of them don’t have the cache and resources to have a documentary made largely about how much of a dick they’re capable of being and have so many people still love them afterwards.</p>

<p>If you look through the list of highest verticals in NBA history, it’s mostly a list of people you don’t remember. Jordans 48” vert was never even verified so it’s all a guess anyways that he has the highest of all time.</p>

<p>The point is, Jordan also won the mental genetic lottery. So did LeBron.</p>

What about Dwight Howard or Giannis? HoF for sure but not even close to MJ level of greatness. Sure MJ&rsquo;s gifts got him to the doorsteps of greatness but once he got there that was only half the battle. That&rsquo;s when his psychotic drive and competitiveness was equally important. We have heard this from so many NBA players MJ was crazy. Chuck has said it, Magic has said it, hundreds of other players that played with him have said it.</p>

<p>I grew up watching Jordan. He was often not the most athletic on the court, but he knew how to leverage his athleticism better than just about anyone. He&rsquo;d beat players off the dribble with angles, footwork, hesi&rsquo;s, deception, every minute edge to give him the space he needed to get what he wanted.</p>

      <label for="ll58710" class="commentText"><p>lol this is nonsense. His genetics trumped everything. His competitiveness barely mattered. Genetics is much more than being tall or fast, it completely determines coordination and skill, and those (in addition to his height and athleticism) made him better. Literally no NBA athlete ever makes it by working hard. They are just born into it. None earns it.</p>
