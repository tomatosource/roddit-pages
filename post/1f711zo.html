      <label for="ll5i6rp" class="commentText"><p>No way. Michael Jordan jumped really, really high. It was the main thing that obviously set him apart as a player while he was playing and they even made a movie about it and a bunch of famous shoes. Yes he had a ton of other skills and mindset going on, but the jumping was a huge part of his game. For some reason people have forgotten this. He’s the all-time leader among guards in blocks per game for a reason. And in his later career he was feared for one of the worst shots in basketball, which tons of players tried to imitate and were never as good at as he was unless they were like 7 feet tall - the midrange post fade-away.</p>

<p>Nobody could play like Michael Jordan in a big part because nobody with his quickness and explosiveness at his size had his leaping ability, and they still don’t.</p>

<p>Michael Jordan’s competitive drive is a lot, but it’s not that unusual among athletes, not even elite ones. It’s just most of them don’t have the cache and resources to have a documentary made largely about how much of a dick they’re capable of being and have so many people still love them afterwards.</p>

      <label for="ll6ltzc" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m sure you can go out and find someone with bigger hands and can jump higher. Odds are they&rsquo;re shitty basketball players let alone the greatest player of all time.</p>

<p>You should look at some of Bob Knight&rsquo;s assessments of Jordan when he coached him on the 1984 Olympic team. Yeah Jordan was insanely talented. But Knight was known as a person who valued desire and hard work. He hated people who were lazy.</p>

<p>Knight went on the record back then before Jordan ever played a game in the NBA and said Jordan was going to be the best that ever played basketball but may even be the best person that has ever played a sport.</p>

<p>You tell me Bob Knight can make that assessment by looking at someone&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>Edit: Just for perspective Barkley tried out for the 1984 team but Knight cut him because he didn&rsquo;t like Barkleys attitude. With tracks with Barkley being not great until Moses Malone told him he was fat and lazy.</p>

What about Dwight Howard or Giannis? HoF for sure but not even close to MJ level of greatness. Sure MJ&rsquo;s gifts got him to the doorsteps of greatness but once he got there that was only half the battle. That&rsquo;s when his psychotic drive and competitiveness was equally important. We have heard this from so many NBA players MJ was crazy. Chuck has said it, Magic has said it, hundreds of other players that played with him have said it.</p>

      <label for="ll5swok" class="commentText"><p>Being fair to OP, he said thousands of taller, faster, stronger, players - ignoring the speed, Jordan was not that tall. According to the US Olympic team, he was measured a shade under 6&rsquo;5.</p>

<p>Similarly, Jordan wasn&rsquo;t known for his strength. It&rsquo;s not that much of a stretch to think that there are 2,000 players that were either 6&rsquo;5 and taller, or slightly stronger than MJ in the history of the NBA.</p>

      <label for="ll5cn5s" class="commentText"><p>Thousands was hyperbole for sure, but there are more than a handful of guys that have come in with insane physical giftings and done nothing. For example, Hamidou Diallo.</p>

<p>If you look through the list of highest verticals in NBA history, it’s mostly a list of people you don’t remember. Jordans 48” vert was never even verified so it’s all a guess anyways that he has the highest of all time.</p>

<p>The point is, Jordan also won the mental genetic lottery. So did LeBron.</p>

<p>Per theory: this is why Ant Edwards has a lower ceiling</p>

<p>I grew up watching Jordan. He was often not the most athletic on the court, but he knew how to leverage his athleticism better than just about anyone. He&rsquo;d beat players off the dribble with angles, footwork, hesi&rsquo;s, deception, every minute edge to give him the space he needed to get what he wanted.</p>

A 6&rsquo;6 guard with a 48 inch vertical, a sub 4.4 40 yard dash (unofficial, but reported by 3 different coaches on separate occasions), an elite first step, and hands that make Kawhi&rsquo;s look small is just about as close as it gets to physical perfection for a basketball player. Then you add his psychopathic competitive drive and it&rsquo;s no surprise you get a GOAT tier player.</p>

      <label for="ll6c4jl" class="commentText"><p>The elite genetic aspect  is extremely over represented in these conversations. The qualities or more than just genetics or work. Take a player like Austin Reaves of the Lakers. Simply based on his height, he is in the 0.1-0.2% of the American male  population and he’s only 6’5”. But his quickness, weight, strength are probably not intrinsically exceptional for any trained athlete. His hand-eye coordination is probably very high as well. But basketball is a sport of skill as much as athleticism. So the work put in with training and repetition is just as necessary and can exceed many generic advantages such as height in many situations. This is where the elite are exceptional: The training and repetition. As well, there is the analysis of the game “ basketball iq”,”How one studies the game, predicts tendencies and movements. This is also something that may be genetic but mostly comes from time spend observing, analyzing, and playing. There’s also effort. This is a major factor that is not appreciated. When one dives for a ball, risk taking contact, runs faster consistently to get to a position or fill a lane on a fast break.  The greats do these little things which, at the margins in the most competitive situations , separates the good from the great. Emotional control- staying relaxed in tense situations, fighting through fatigue, is also a factor.  Austin Reaves is exceptional at many of these other aspects of the game which most people who analyze the game take for granted.</p>

<p>It is very rare to have the entire package of these traits like Jordan did, but only some of it was he born with. The rest was work and dedication.</p>

<p>MIKE: You know, just motivational stuff like that.</p>

<p><em>A beat.</em></p>

<p>Monza is the most unique track on the grid. It&rsquo;s  the track that &ldquo;not the championship car&rdquo; always wins at because of how much it favors straight line speed compared to the rest of the season. Anyone who thinks it&rsquo;s not that close doesn&rsquo;t realize how close (all of) these driver&rsquo;s really are to each other.</p>
