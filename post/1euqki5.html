</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I just saw a documentary about the &ldquo;Bad Boy&rdquo; Detroit Pistons and found it fascinating that for a time there was a team of players who understood the limits of physicality in the NBA and somehow worked it to their advantage - to the extent they were the most hated team in the league.</p>

<p>If you were to assemble a &ldquo;Bad Boys&rdquo; Team today, within 2nd Apron rules, who would be on it? For what reasons? And can such a team go all the way like the 1989 and 1990 Pistons did?</p>

      <label for="limabrb" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s fine, but specifically when you mentioned foul hunting is what would get him landed on the list. He&rsquo;s one of the best in the league at it. Its just the way the rules are written and enforced these days, players like him, Harden, and Bron take advantage of it to get to the line for better or worse. If the goal of a team was to get the opposing team in foul trouble they&rsquo;d likely succeed</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d imagine the modern Bad Boys would be a Psy War squad.</p>

      <label for="limb6rs" class="commentText"><p>I mean, the Warriors from 15 to now have been what I consider the modern equivalent. Team led by a small, scrappy point guard (who’s quietly kind of dirty) a two guard that produces on both offense and defense, and a center that’s dirty as fuck and hated by nearly everyone, along with a completely unlikeable fanbase. You could never really reproduce those Pistons teams fully, but the warriors felt similar in some ways, particularly the ways they take advantage of officiating.</p>

      <label for="limfa1b" class="commentText"><p>You also probably wouldn&rsquo;t want a Pistons style team, at least not after a few years. They made for great theater vs the flash of Show Time, Jordan&rsquo;s greatness, the Bird Celtics, The Riley Knicks and Heat took that same idea and advanced it. Their success had other teams adopt similar principles: The Pacers gained a ton of ground when they brought in the Davis brothers as their own Lambier/Oakley style enforcers.  One reason the Knicks/Pistons archetype was popular was because you didn&rsquo;t need an MVP-level guy to compete. More and more teams followed suit and by the 2000s, the league had became much more difficult to watch.</p>

<p>Eventually the league implemented rules to make it not nearly so effective: hand checking, flagrants, landing space, different rules about contact.</p>

<p>Now, playing like this as a collective doesn&rsquo;t give you nearly the advantage (and against guys like Embiid, SGA, Harden it&rsquo;s actually a disadvantage).</p>

<p>Basically, that approach wouldn&rsquo;t work and it&rsquo;s not really supposed to work anymore. A successful rebirth of the Pistons would be fun as villains; but do we really want people saying: &ldquo;every team needs a Dillon Brooks&rdquo; or man, &ldquo;Evan Mobley really needs to act more like Draymond Green!&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s great when one team does it, but not so much when it becomes an effective way to win without a star.</p>
