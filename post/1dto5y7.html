      <label for="lbcifpz" class="commentText"><p>It was pretty clear during the final season of their championship run that Krause wanted to hire Floyd to replace Phil Jackson, so it wouldn&rsquo;t have been one of his assistnats:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let’s go back a few years — to 1989, when Randy White played at Louisiana Tech and Floyd coached at the University of New Orleans. That’s when this Floyd to the Bulls stuff actually started.</p>

<p>“Jerry Krause saw us beat Randy’s team three times,” Floyd said of the Bulls general manager. “After the third time, Jerry came up to me and said that he didn’t know me well, but he knew enough to know that he wanted me to be the next coach of the Chicago Bulls.</p>

<p>“That was 10 years before it happened. I was flattered, but I had a team to coach and the Bulls had Phil. Jerry called me once a week until 1993, then he started calling five times a week. He was calling all the time.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the same interview Floyd is pretty candid and says Krause wanted to blow the entire team up because he didn&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d win another championship.</p>

<p>Dallas was trying to get ahead of the changes in the salary cap But then it ended up exploding (which resulted with the KD warriors) so they could have kept all of their team together.</p>

<p>They weren’t in a position to run it back. They blew it up and the proceeds from blowing it up had them back in the World Series a few years later.</p>

<p>It’s widely panned, but it is totally plausible to frame it as a success story.</p>

      <label for="lbb3uct" class="commentText"><p>Like a lot of players Lebron clearly has still has a video gamish view of basketball from childhood. A lot of stars think big names like Westbrook must make their team better Harden did the same thing in Houston bringing Russ in, then PG brought Russ to the Clippers, now Jokic wants him in Denver. Stars assume other stars are like them and realistically they don&rsquo;t have time to watch every game so they never really know. They certainly don&rsquo;t look up advanced stats.</p>

      <label for="lbaw9mv" class="commentText"><p>The really weird part to me was he wanted Westbrook there so bad&hellip; but wouldn&rsquo;t change his game at all to help Westbrook fit. They both just took turns doing that thing where they stand 5ft behind the arc with their hands on their hips until they get the ball back.</p>

<p>That team works fine if LeBron gets involved setting screens for Russ and moving without the ball. Westbrook I think we can accept just doesn&rsquo;t have that versatility, but we&rsquo;ve seen LeBron play that role under Spoelstra and we saw how much better Westbrook played when LeBron was out.</p>

      <label for="lbcokug" class="commentText"><p>Tbf, it seems like every player in the league has an idealized view of Westbrook&rsquo;s value on a team. He&rsquo;s oddly revered despite his inefficiency.</p>

<p>Moreover, Lebron&rsquo;s injuries that year seemingly spooked him into wanting another workhorse playmaker to take the load off of him.</p>

<p>&hellip;.and it was pretty stunning <em>how little</em> RW was willing/able to change/adapt in his style of play. (He has done <em>slightly</em> better with LAC.)</p>

Also if they’re sending out an equivalent salary like kuzma and filler which they sent to Washington then I don’t see the problem.
Ultimately they just wanted russ more than dd, which is dumb in hindsight but I understand the appeal after his resurgence in Washington.</p>

      <label for="lbaqj98" class="commentText"><p>Not exactly. They only had an MLE slot available. So they would have had to do a sign and trade for DeRozan which would have hard capped them at the time. Spurs were asking for Kuzma and another player to make it happen. It also wasn&rsquo;t clear that the Spurs would even trade with the Lakers based on past bad blood. DeRozan also had a bad season and Westbrook had just taken the Wizards to the playoffs. All in all it wasn&rsquo;t as black and white as people say at the time.</p>

      <label for="lbc4vv6" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s pretty easy to google. He was hurt in game 2 of the finals. I suppose you are too young to have seen the series, but you are just being fed a bunch of lies by people who just hate the lakers. Malone played in games 3 and 4 but not 5, and he was far below 100% in 3 and 4.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs2004/news/story?id=1818392" target="_blank">https://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs2004/news/story?id=1818392</a></p>

<p>Also, note what I said about Kobe, above. Kobe froze out Shaq and didn&rsquo;t get him the ball because Kobe wanted to be the man that series. If he had played the way he should have, and the way Phil wanted him to, they would have easily won that series. Kobe wasn&rsquo;t good enough to beat the pistons as the main guy for that lakers team, but Shaq was, and the team was built to his strengths, too.</p>

      <label for="lbcfjg1" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think so. You’ve gotta look at the contracts that offseason.</p>

<p>DeRozan wanted a three year guarantee. Rambis advised Buss that DeRozan wasn’t worth three years or that they were better off keeping the third year open to make a splash in free agency.</p>

<p>Westbrook’s contract was only for another two years. This meant his deal was going to come off the books when LA wanted to make that FA splash. DeRozan got nixed because the Lakers didn’t want to give him three years and the thought process was that Westbrook’s total $47M would come off the books, allowing the Lakers to revamp the roster with maybe yet another free agent signing while being able to re-sign WB to a new deal via his bird rights.</p>

<p>Such a weird way to say &ldquo;the Bulls were willing to offer him more money.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m pretty sure the Lakers at the time couldn&rsquo;t offer him a whole lot.</p>

<p>People always try turning anything regarding the Lakers into some big dramatic thing when the reality is often a lot more boring.</p>

DeRozan thought it would get done, but then the Lakers traded for Westbrook instead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DeMar DeRozan had multiple conversations with LeBron James in the offseason. His agent, Aaron Goodwin, worked feverishly behind the scenes with the San Antonio Spurs’ front office to get details ironed out on what would have been a sign-and-trade package to send the 13-year free agent veteran to his hometown team, the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>

<p>DeRozan, 32, believed everyone was on the same page, but the Lakers silently began exploring another route once Russell Westbrook was made available in Washington.</p>

<p>The talks between the Lakers and Spurs tapered off. Reading the tea leaves, Goodwin pivoted his client in the direction of the Chicago Bulls.</p>

<p>There was minimal debate internally among the Lakers&rsquo; brass on which player would be the right fit, but there weren&rsquo;t enough key backers of DeRozan. Westbrook was acquired on the day of the 2021 NBA draft.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And here&rsquo;s DeRozan on Redick&rsquo;s podcast in 2022:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I’m asleep one morning in Mexico. I get a call from [former Toronto Raptors teammate] Kyle Lowry. And he said, ‘They just made the trade for [Russell Westbrook]. What&rsquo;s going on? I thought the deal was done for you for the Lakers.’ And I was like, ‘I&rsquo;m confused.’ I&rsquo;m looking at my phone like, ‘Damn, that did happen. Well, I guess that&rsquo;s out the window.’ And in my mind, that was the only option for me to go to. I didn&rsquo;t even entertain anything else because I&rsquo;m letting this situation work itself out.”</p>

We would have had to trade Kuzma and Harrell with taking no extra money back at all, and even then we were about 7 million off his contract he got with the Bulls so he would have had to take a 7 million per year paycut.</p>

      <label for="lbc0e38" class="commentText"><p>Back then there were some talks on these sports shows that Demar would consider taking vet minimum just to play for the Lakers. Shortly after he signed a massive deal with the bulls. Those suggestions that he&rsquo;d take that big of a paycut to play in LA were pretty ridiculous considering how much he had left in the tank.</p>
