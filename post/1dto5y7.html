      <label for="lbaw9mv" class="commentText"><p>The really weird part to me was he wanted Westbrook there so bad&hellip; but wouldn&rsquo;t change his game at all to help Westbrook fit. They both just took turns doing that thing where they stand 5ft behind the arc with their hands on their hips until they get the ball back.</p>

<p>That team works fine if LeBron gets involved setting screens for Russ and moving without the ball. Westbrook I think we can accept just doesn&rsquo;t have that versatility, but we&rsquo;ve seen LeBron play that role under Spoelstra and we saw how much better Westbrook played when LeBron was out.</p>

      <label for="lbaqj98" class="commentText"><p>Not exactly. They only had an MLE slot available. So they would have had to do a sign and trade for DeRozan which would have hard capped them at the time. Spurs were asking for Kuzma and another player to make it happen. It also wasn&rsquo;t clear that the Spurs would even trade with the Lakers based on past bad blood. DeRozan also had a bad season and Westbrook had just taken the Wizards to the playoffs. All in all it wasn&rsquo;t as black and white as people say at the time.</p>

<p>Such a weird way to say &ldquo;the Bulls were willing to offer him more money.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m pretty sure the Lakers at the time couldn&rsquo;t offer him a whole lot.</p>

<p>People always try turning anything regarding the Lakers into some big dramatic thing when the reality is often a lot more boring.</p>

<p>Thats why he chose the Bulls lol</p>

DeRozan thought it would get done, but then the Lakers traded for Westbrook instead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DeMar DeRozan had multiple conversations with LeBron James in the offseason. His agent, Aaron Goodwin, worked feverishly behind the scenes with the San Antonio Spurs’ front office to get details ironed out on what would have been a sign-and-trade package to send the 13-year free agent veteran to his hometown team, the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>

<p>DeRozan, 32, believed everyone was on the same page, but the Lakers silently began exploring another route once Russell Westbrook was made available in Washington.</p>

<p>The talks between the Lakers and Spurs tapered off. Reading the tea leaves, Goodwin pivoted his client in the direction of the Chicago Bulls.</p>

<p>There was minimal debate internally among the Lakers&rsquo; brass on which player would be the right fit, but there weren&rsquo;t enough key backers of DeRozan. Westbrook was acquired on the day of the 2021 NBA draft.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And here&rsquo;s DeRozan on Redick&rsquo;s podcast in 2022:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I’m asleep one morning in Mexico. I get a call from [former Toronto Raptors teammate] Kyle Lowry. And he said, ‘They just made the trade for [Russell Westbrook]. What&rsquo;s going on? I thought the deal was done for you for the Lakers.’ And I was like, ‘I&rsquo;m confused.’ I&rsquo;m looking at my phone like, ‘Damn, that did happen. Well, I guess that&rsquo;s out the window.’ And in my mind, that was the only option for me to go to. I didn&rsquo;t even entertain anything else because I&rsquo;m letting this situation work itself out.”</p>
</blockquote>
