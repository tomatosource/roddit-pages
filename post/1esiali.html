      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1esiali/fox_okoro_has_backed_himself_into_somewhat_of_a/"><p>[Fox] &ldquo;Okoro has backed himself into somewhat of a proverbial corner. At this stage in the offseason, the majority of teams do not have the financial flexibility to hand the 2020 5th-overall pick the contract he desires. Johnson and Finney-Smith have likely been taken off of the trade block for now</p>

      <p>Source:  <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/nets/news/brooklyn-nets-unlikely-to-land-free-agent-isaac-okoro" target="_blank">https://www.si.com/nba/nets/news/brooklyn-nets-unlikely-to-land-free-agent-isaac-okoro</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>After rumors linking restricted free agent Isaac Okoro to the Brooklyn Nets began to swirl, the expectation was that the franchise would have to part ways with either Cameron Johnson or Dorian Finney-Smith to land the 23-year-old.</p>

<p>The deal is extremely unlikely to take place due to two glaring reasons. First, Okoro has backed himself into somewhat of a proverbial corner. At this stage in the offseason, the majority of teams do not have the financial flexibility to hand the 2020 fifth-overall pick the contract he desires. Second, Johnson and Finney-Smith have likely been taken off of the trade block for now to be dealt at the 2025 trade deadline.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time Brooklyn has been linked to a former first-round pick through a trade that never came to fruition. While the Okoro talks were likely more legitimate, it echoes the rumored interest in Anfernee Simons. The Nets simply do not have enough cap space to be targeting high-upside pieces this late in the summer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Okoro signing saga continues.  Will he simply accept the QO and bet on himself for 2025&rsquo;s free agency class where more teams are poised to have cap space?</p>

      <label for="li6lxy2" class="commentText"><p>I’m admittedly higher on Okoro than many but don’t think this is quite a fair representation of him. He is a <em>phenomenal</em> defender. And his offense still needs work but it’s legitimately been coming along. Each season he gets a little better. He’s gotten to be very good in transition and his ball handling has improved dramatically. Like, he averaged nearly 10 ppg. Thats not zero offense. People just focus on the shot. But the shot is coming along. He shot 39% in the regular season from 3, even if it was on wide open attempts. I get it dipped to like 30% in the playoffs but a lot of that was him missing shots he normally makes, not him struggling against higher level defense. I still believe he’ll end up as a solid starter.</p>

      <label for="li6rg3o" class="commentText"><p>He shot 39% in the regular season due to being left alone on an island. He didn&rsquo;t play enough minutes for teams to give a shit about him taking 1-2 3PTA&rsquo;s a game. In the playoffs, where every point matters, they guarded him much more closely and his true abilities shined through (or lack thereof). He needs to improve his shot next season enough to be considered for most impressive award, otherwise he may be playing overseas from then on. We&rsquo;re having the same debate 4 years later. You think NBA GMs/coaches aren&rsquo;t as well?</p>

The team defense is significantly better with him on the other team’s best player, but that also makes him significantly less valuable coming off the bench.</p>

<p>His problem is that while he’s become significantly better on offense, he is still too hesitant at times. You can’t count on him to provide enough offense with both Mobley and Allen out there, so where does he fit in the rotation?</p>

In fairness the Cave have never really allowed him to settle in as a 2 guard because they&rsquo;ve never had a super talented wing, but still then we&rsquo;re talking about a shooting guard who is afraid to shoot.</p>

<p>Your basically robbing him of the 1 thing on offense he does very well by playing slow. He is not a stand around the arc in the half-court type of guy. Hes a slasher that rarely gets the opportunity to slash.</p>

<p>Anyway, he&rsquo;s odd man out on the Cavs. He&rsquo;s not large enough to guard wings well or be a switch defender despite his on ball defense being elite. He can&rsquo;t hit 3s well enough to space and he isn&rsquo;t an efficient point guard so he can&rsquo;t run a second unit.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s basically a small, on ball defensive specialist without shooting (think jrue but not gonna score at all)</p>

      <label for="li6akgf" class="commentText"><p>Yeah coming out of Auburn I felt like his on ball defense, athleticism, and slashing would be enough to keep him in a winning team’s rotation and if the spot up three came along then he’d be a locked in long term starter. But you make a good point about the size limitations, he is a bit of a tweener defensively, as elite as he may be.</p>

<p>In an alternative Cavs roster build he probably makes more sense, but there’s not a realistic place for him with this current core unless he suddenly becomes a knockdown shooter with more game off the bounce. Still believe in the talent though.</p>

He’s a legit elite defender like maybe a top 20 defender in the league it was what got him drafted top5 even when people knew he had little offensive game. Now he atleast averages 40% from 3 (on low volume and mostly spotting up but it’s something) and is a relatively good slasher/ball handler . Hes also like 6’4 and his true position is shooting gaurd. He doesn’t really have the secondary or tertiary playmaking you would want from a shooting guard but he’s a really good defender and can make open 3s</p>
