      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1d6ybhb/whos_the_fourth_best_player_of_the_2010s_and_is/"><p>Who&rsquo;s the fourth best player of the 2010&rsquo;s and is it Kawhi Leonard?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Clearly, the trio of LeBron, Curry and Durant own the top spots (whether you have Curry over KD or KD over Curry is another debate altogether), but similar to tennis there is a question of who is closest to the big three (Andy Murray maybe), and I think Kawhi has a decent argument.</p>

<p>Leonard&rsquo;s accolades: 2 FMVPs, 2 championships, 1 DPOY, 6 all-NBA&rsquo;s (1st teams in 2016, 2017 and 2021)</p>

<p>Some others that could contend for the no 4. spot: Westbrook, Harden, CP3 etc</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t an attempt to create a Mount Rushmore, as I do think whoever slides in at no 4 is not nearly as relevant as the aforementioned three. However, Kawhi (barring Dirk and Kobe, but they were best in the 2000s) is the only number one option to win a championship during the trio&rsquo;s primes, and he did it twice. While he doesn&rsquo;t quite make a quartet with LBJ, Steph and KD, Leonard is in a separate trio as one of the three players to have won a FMVP and a DPOY, in the elite company of Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon.</p>

<p>Have I missed someone, or is the question itself obsolete?</p>

<p>And no matter how many times people just lump it together as &ldquo;2x FMVP,&rdquo; no one is ever going to forget that one of them was an Iguodala, Tony Parker, Cedric Maxwell type FMVP.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>He was 6th on his team in PPG in the WCF. Outscored by Duncan, Ginobili, Diaw, Parker, and Green. The number one option does not do that and win.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think the 2014 championship was that undeserved, personally. Of course there&rsquo;s a discussion but Duncan and Leonard were both playing very well.</p>

      <label for="l6vntlg" class="commentText"><p>Healthy Kawhi is a top tier all time great imo. His playoff stats in his prime compare favorably to any wing, and he is better defensively than almost all of them even after his defense declined from its peak. Just checked his b-ball reference and grabbed some games from 2016 to 2021 playoffs. In that stretch, 28.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.3 on 51/39/89 efficiency. Considering his defense, this stacks up well with anyone. And the eye test confirms. He doesn‚Äôt stat chase in the regular season, probably the pop influence there.¬†</p>

<p>¬†That said, I think Kawhi is at least equal with Durant and Curry. I‚Äôd place them all in the same tier honestly. Curry in the regular season, probably lean Kawhi then Durant in the playoffs.¬†</p>

<p>LeBron is the best of the era, then you have that trio of all time greats. Pretty cool that all 4 will be in Olympics¬†</p>

<p>I feel like for Kawhi to get the nod here we‚Äôd have to REALLY be placing a ton of emphasis on that 2019 ring. He wasn‚Äôt in the league the first two years of this decade, spent a lot of time after as a role payer, missed a chunk of games most years and pretty much the entire year in 2018.. makes his resume outside of team accomplishments a little shallow. He has just 3 AS teams and 3 All-NBA nods in this stretch, 63 players have scored more points than him in this decade, 21 players have more win-shares, 12 have a higher VORP, 7 a better PER, and 4 a better BPM..</p>

<p>Stats above queried for players from <sup>2009</sup>&frasl;<sub>2010</sub> season - <sup>2018</sup>&frasl;<sub>2019</sub> season, players with 8,000+ points.</p>

<p>I‚Äôd probably lean Harden but I know how unpopular that take will be given his teams relative lack of playoff success.</p>
