      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1d6ybhb/whos_the_fourth_best_player_of_the_2010s_and_is/"><p>Who&rsquo;s the fourth best player of the 2010&rsquo;s and is it Kawhi Leonard?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Clearly, the trio of LeBron, Curry and Durant own the top spots (whether you have Curry over KD or KD over Curry is another debate altogether), but similar to tennis there is a question of who is closest to the big three (Andy Murray maybe), and I think Kawhi has a decent argument.</p>

<p>Leonard&rsquo;s accolades: 2 FMVPs, 2 championships, 1 DPOY, 6 all-NBA&rsquo;s (1st teams in 2016, 2017 and 2021)</p>

<p>Some others that could contend for the no 4. spot: Westbrook, Harden, CP3 etc</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t an attempt to create a Mount Rushmore, as I do think whoever slides in at no 4 is not nearly as relevant as the aforementioned three. However, Kawhi (barring Dirk and Kobe, but they were best in the 2000s) is the only number one option to win a championship during the trio&rsquo;s primes, and he did it twice. While he doesn&rsquo;t quite make a quartet with LBJ, Steph and KD, Leonard is in a separate trio as one of the three players to have won a FMVP and a DPOY, in the elite company of Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon.</p>

<p>Have I missed someone, or is the question itself obsolete?</p>

<p>And no matter how many times people just lump it together as &ldquo;2x FMVP,&rdquo; no one is ever going to forget that one of them was an Iguodala, Tony Parker, Cedric Maxwell type FMVP.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>He was 6th on his team in PPG in the WCF. Outscored by Duncan, Ginobili, Diaw, Parker, and Green. The number one option does not do that and win.</p>

I want to emphasize that Harden shot 24% from the three on 11 attempts per game! Also Harden won game 5 by 4 points despite shooting <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>21</sub>, 0/11 from three, and having 4 assists on 6 turnovers.</p>

<p>I think there is a little more context to that series than just &ldquo;Harden taking the most stacked team of all time to 7 games.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I feel like for Kawhi to get the nod here we’d have to REALLY be placing a ton of emphasis on that 2019 ring. He wasn’t in the league the first two years of this decade, spent a lot of time after as a role payer, missed a chunk of games most years and pretty much the entire year in 2018.. makes his resume outside of team accomplishments a little shallow. He has just 3 AS teams and 3 All-NBA nods in this stretch, 63 players have scored more points than him in this decade, 21 players have more win-shares, 12 have a higher VORP, 7 a better PER, and 4 a better BPM..</p>

<p>Stats above queried for players from <sup>2009</sup>&frasl;<sub>2010</sub> season - <sup>2018</sup>&frasl;<sub>2019</sub> season, players with 8,000+ points.</p>

<p>I’d probably lean Harden but I know how unpopular that take will be given his teams relative lack of playoff success.</p>

<p>Great player, but his career is a what-if because of all the injuries. I&rsquo;ll take James even though he never had the career-defining playoff series. Kawhi is probably better than Harden, but at some point availability has to count for something if we&rsquo;re talking full career.</p>

      <label for="l6vse3k" class="commentText"><p>LOL.  Such a dumb argument.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s one you will understand.  KD won 2 FMVP&rsquo;s while playing with Curry.  He took over Curry&rsquo;s team and outplayed him in the playoffs.  Curry got outplayed by Iggy  while playing against the worst Finals team ever in 2015.  There is no argument for Curry over Durant in the 2010&rsquo;s.</p>

      <label for="l6vql78" class="commentText"><p>I think that the only two answers are Harden and Kawhi.</p>

<p>And it’s a super interesting question because they have such different careers.</p>

<p>While the bias raptors fan in me wants to say Kawhi, I think it has to be harden. Kawhi might have been a “better” player at his best, but Harden really defines the 2010s style more than anyone - with the possible exception of curry.*</p>

<p>I think that Harden’s career has been diminished by the media/narratives. In reality, he’s a transcendentally great player.</p>

<p>A lot of people say that kids in pickup try to emulate curry. But in my experience, harden has had an even more profound impact on the game. Everything down to his posture was imitated by a generation. He pioneered the “double step back” which is somehow not a travel, despite how it looks in real time.</p>

<p>I love Kawhi, and if I were drafting a team guaranteeing health I’d probably choose him. But harden is quintessentially 2010 NBA</p>

<ul>
<li>I say possible exception because curry is a freak of nature who defies all we know about shooting. A lot of people try to be him but literally nobody comes close.</li>

He sort of chilled stats wise in the regular season but he came up under pop, that’s what they do. In the playoffs is where it counts and he probably outperformed Curry and KD in the playoffs at his peak. </p>

Melo didn’t win any MVPs, or lead a team to multiple Conference finals, or even to a finals. And if we’re gonna give Kawhi credit for beating Bron and Curry, why wouldn’t KD get credit for beating Kawhi?</p>

      <label for="l6vntlg" class="commentText"><p>Healthy Kawhi is a top tier all time great imo. His playoff stats in his prime compare favorably to any wing, and he is better defensively than almost all of them even after his defense declined from its peak. Just checked his b-ball reference and grabbed some games from 2016 to 2021 playoffs. In that stretch, 28.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.3 on 51/39/89 efficiency. Considering his defense, this stacks up well with anyone. And the eye test confirms. He doesn’t stat chase in the regular season, probably the pop influence there. </p>

<p> That said, I think Kawhi is at least equal with Durant and Curry. I’d place them all in the same tier honestly. Curry in the regular season, probably lean Kawhi then Durant in the playoffs. </p>

<p>LeBron is the best of the era, then you have that trio of all time greats. Pretty cool that all 4 will be in Olympics </p>

      <label for="l6vqj7x" class="commentText"><p>You cannot just cherry pick stats to fit your narrative. Steph is one of the greatest offensive engines of all time. He is the greatest shooter of all time, the greatest off-ball player of all time and the second best pg of all time. 4 rings, 2 mvps (1 unanimous, never done in history), 1 fmvp (deserved 2), the best player of a dynasty, three consecutive seasons with at least 67 wins, (67-15, 73-9, 67-15). And btw, great offense beats great defense everytime. Steph&rsquo;s offense &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Kawhi&rsquo;s defense. There are a whole bunch of defensive anchors you would pick for your team before picking Kawhi. On the other hand, Ty Lue self admittedly doubled Steph with KD and Klay on the floor. That tells you everything you need to know. Steph can get you a 50 piece victory in a game 7 that too in the opponent&rsquo;s court.</p>

      <label for="l6vr7lz" class="commentText"><p>Those are not cherry picked stats. That’s a 6 year span of him playing in the playoffs at his peak. And peak Kawhi in the playoffs is more effective than peak Curry and Durant. People underrate Kawhi because he sort of lays back in the regular season, not uncommon for pop coaches players. But in the playoffs the only wings in his class are the Mount Rushmore guys. Seriously, check the stats for him in the playoffs and compare to Curry and KD. Then consider the defense gap. Kawhi was better in the playoffs.</p>

<p>If we are talking accolades and legacy yeah I agree. But if you need to win a best of 7, I want LeBron, then Kawhi, then Curry/Durant.</p>

<p>Lmao. From 2015 to 2019 Steph never lost a playoff series in the tougher western conference. Went to the finals all 5 times. Steph won before KD, with KD and after KD. And somehow Kawhi is the better playoff performer lol.</p>

      <label for="l6vqsp0" class="commentText"><p>Third or fourth. Kd and LeBron are locked at 1-2, Curry and Kawhi could swap 3-4. Harden is at the 5.</p>

<p>It’s controversial due to the accolade differential, but there’s an argument for Curry at the 4. People seem to forget that in Kawhi’s prime, he was as good as LeBron and KD. Whereas Curry (with all due respect) was never considered the best in the league and was always slightly below those two.</p>

<p>And I’m not hating, I love Curry. I’d still take Curry because of how much he gives to an offense. I’m just making it clear that Kawhi <em>is absolutely</em> in that tier with those 3. He was in the big 3 in those years, not Curry. It’s revisionist to say otherwise and Kawhi doesn’t get the respect he deserves for it</p>

<li><p>how? AD/Lebron were All-NBA level. young Austin Reaves and Malik Monk. same core that made the WCF after trading Russ. and Westbrook was suddenly washed with the Lakers when he just came off a season avearging 22/12/12 on the Wizards?</p></li>

      <label for="l6vpze7" class="commentText"><p>But almost everyone that will reply to this comment will have Curry over KD, say his rings don&rsquo;t count, the Warriors were overpowered ect. So losing KD still leaves them with 3-4 hall of famers and it wasn&rsquo;t close.</p>

      <label for="l6vqrv4" class="commentText"><p>It was more than just KD going down, Steph had just returned from injury like literally 1 game prior plus Klay got hurt as well.  He was missing his two best teammates, much of which their entire offense was based around, and he himself was hurt. Meanwhile Kawhi had his full squad around him and they had continuity all playoffs. The advantage was about as far in the Toronto direction as it could possibly be.</p>

<p>Like, if during game 1 Tatum comes back from injury only to lose brown, KP, and white for the series, would anyone really blame him for losing the series? At that point you’re screwed, it’s way too soon to game plan for that in the finals. You lost <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of your most important players and the one you have is hobbled.</p>
