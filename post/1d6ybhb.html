</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Clearly, the trio of LeBron, Curry and Durant own the top spots (whether you have Curry over KD or KD over Curry is another debate altogether), but similar to tennis there is a question of who is closest to the big three (Andy Murray maybe), and I think Kawhi has a decent argument.</p>

<p>Leonard&rsquo;s accolades: 2 FMVPs, 2 championships, 1 DPOY, 6 all-NBA&rsquo;s (1st teams in 2016, 2017 and 2021)</p>

<p>Some others that could contend for the no 4. spot: Westbrook, Harden, CP3 etc</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t an attempt to create a Mount Rushmore, as I do think whoever slides in at no 4 is not nearly as relevant as the aforementioned three. However, Kawhi (barring Dirk and Kobe, but they were best in the 2000s) is the only number one option to win a championship during the trio&rsquo;s primes, and he did it twice. While he doesn&rsquo;t quite make a quartet with LBJ, Steph and KD, Leonard is in a separate trio as one of the three players to have won a FMVP and a DPOY, in the elite company of Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon.</p>

<p>Have I missed someone, or is the question itself obsolete?</p>

      <label for="l6vocr0" class="commentText"><p>The problem with “the only number one option to win a championship” is that being a number one on a championship team doesn’t necessarily mean you’re better than a player who wasn’t on a championship team.</p>

<p>I feel like for Kawhi to get the nod here we’d have to REALLY be placing a ton of emphasis on that 2019 ring. He wasn’t in the league the first two years of this decade, spent a lot of time after as a role payer, missed a chunk of games most years and pretty much the entire year in 2018.. makes his resume outside of team accomplishments a little shallow. He has just 3 AS teams and 3 All-NBA nods in this stretch, 63 players have scored more points than him in this decade, 21 players have more win-shares, 12 have a higher VORP, 7 a better PER, and 4 a better BPM..</p>

<p>Stats above queried for players from <sup>2009</sup>&frasl;<sub>2010</sub> season - <sup>2018</sup>&frasl;<sub>2019</sub> season, players with 8,000+ points.</p>

<p>I’d probably lean Harden but I know how unpopular that take will be given his teams relative lack of playoff success.</p>

      <label for="l6w4ugr" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s very tough given how little he played, that&rsquo;s fair. But he was absolutely outstanding in 2016 and 2017. In 16, he was mvp runner up because he was fully, unquestionably the best player on a 67 win team which just happened to be outclassed by the warriors but we already know curry is better. But he was, in the regular season, the 2nd or 3rd best player, in large part because Lebron was coasting but all the same. In 2017 he was way better. The mvp race was deservedly between Harden and Westbrook but what kind of gets forgotten is that kawhi was closer than people thought near the end of the season in 3rd place. And when he played both, he was the best player on the court which was one of the arguments for him. He had an insane playoffs that year as well and legitimately looked like he could be as good as KD and Curry. Then the injuries happen and he has an amazing 2019 but there is truth to the fact the team was very good as well. But he was the reason they won and in the playoffs, he played better than Harden on average between 16-19 with a 28-8-4-2-1 on 50-40-89 shooting vs Harden&rsquo;s 29-6-7-2-1 on 41-31-87 and, fwiw those are like the very best harden years too so it&rsquo;s not that much cherry picking.</p>

<p>Now to be clear, I&rsquo;d have Harden, the reality is he was the best player on a contender for years and did it every year and also was the better regular season player on average too which does mean something. Even in the tiny range I highlighted, which is only 40% of the decade, Kawhi only played in <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> playoffs. So it&rsquo;s not like I disagree with you. People underrate Harden a lot too. The unfair thing to Harden weirdly was that his regular season performance would have you think he could be a top 15 player of all time and compete with steph and kd but then he clearly wasn&rsquo;t as good in the playoffs so the contrast looked so bad. But he still played well in the playoffs, even despite the percentages. He just wasn&rsquo;t top 15 all time good. Also people hated his style but whatever. So I do have Harden over Kawhi but I do think if we&rsquo;re picking the 4th &ldquo;best&rdquo; player, I&rsquo;d pick uninjured Kawhi to lead my team and feel like people sort of forget how amazing Kawhi was at his best even outside of the raptors year.</p>

      <label for="l6vvvae" class="commentText"><p>Harden was my immediate thought too, but on second thought it really should be Westbrook for 4th best player of the decade.</p>

<p>Westbrook:</p>

<p>-Was a 20+ ppg scorer for the ENTIRE decade</p>

<p>-Unheard of 2016 (edit: meant 2017) MVP triple double season with an insane story and pretty much single-handedly carried that team to the playoffs</p>

<p>-Averaged a triple double for two straight years after that as well</p>

<p>-3 other top-5 seasons in MVP voting, as well as two other top-10s</p>

<p>-Finals appearance, multiple conference finals appearances, tons of playoffs wins</p>

<p>-On a new team, ended the decade with a then-career high in FG% and raised his PPG to near the top of the league</p>

<p>-2 times assists leader, 2 times scoring leader</p>

<p>-2 All Star Game MVPs</p>

      <label for="l6vx498" class="commentText"><p>Sure, but I think one of the biggest factors in this debate should be the player’s longevity for the entirety of the 2010s, so that’s another reason I go Westbrook over Harden.</p>

<p>Harden was still a 6th man during the first two years of the decade, Westbrook was again already putting up 20+ ppg as a starter.</p>

<p>Also, Harden had 4 seasons playing 80+ games compared to Westbrook’s 5 seasons doing so.</p>

Go watch the Heat game plan specifically for Harden in that finals and no one else cause they know KD would get his no matter what. Russ wasn’t a concern in the same way at all.</p>

      <label for="l6wui0j" class="commentText"><p>Heavily disagree. Half the points you make in favor of Westbrook are actually just in favor of Harden&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Even as a sixth man for part of the decade, Harden still averaged more points over the entire decade. I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s more important than arbitrarily saying over 20ppg every year.</p></li>

<li><p>Harden had 5 top 5 MVP seasons vs Westbrook&rsquo;s 4 (and three of Harden&rsquo;s were top 2 which Westbrook only had 1). He tops Westbrook there.</p></li>

<li><p>Harden led the league in scoring 3 times vs Westbrook&rsquo;s 2. They both lead the league in assists twice. In favor of Harden again.</p></li>

<li><p>Harden had 66 playoff wins vs Westbrook&rsquo;s 54. They both made 1 Finals appearance and 4 conference Finals appearances. Again, this is in favor of Harden.</p></li>

<li><p>Harden had 6 1st team All-NBA vs Westbrook&rsquo;s 2. Clear win for Harden</p></li>

<li><p>Harden had better FG%, 3P%, FT%, TS%, and had less turnovers a game. More efficient offensive player.</p></li>

<li><p>Harden had better PER, WS, WS/48, BPM, VORP. Basically any advanced stat says Harden was better.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Literally the only advantage Westbrook has is the whole triple double narrative. Harden was the better scorer, was more efficient, had better advanced stats, had more playoff success, more All-NBA 1st teams, was a more consistent MVP candidate, and did all of this as the 1st option for the majority of the decade while Westbrook was pretty consistently the #2 on his team.</p>

<p>Harden pretty clearly has the edge over Westbrook.</p>

Meanwhile Kawhi was hobbling through those seasons barely playing 50 games on far worse counting stats.

I’ve always been a big fan of Westbrooks game (despite agreeing with a lot of the criticism he received) and I begrudgingly respect Harden’s game too, even though I’m really not a fan of the foul baiting. They’re both great players but neither have ever had the all around game that Kawhi had in 2017-2020</p>

      <label for="l6wy92a" class="commentText"><p>Oh good, a points per game argument. You really know your stuff there, random string of numbers guy.</p>

<p>Did you actually watch any games then? Kawhi’s peak was only a few seasons, sure, but he was the best basketball player on the planet at his peak, which is something Harden/Westbrook have never even sniffed.</p>

<p>People here keep saying Kawhi was only a top player for 3 years of the decade, but he was the fucking FINALS MVP in 2014. He was a top defender in the league for most of the decade, and won 2 DPOY awards.</p>

<p>Theres a very solid argument that Kawhi should have won Westbrook’s MVP.</p>

<p>At the moment Kawhi got hurt in the WCF against Golden State, he was beating the greatest team of all time by 20.</p>

<p>I know at the time it was sort of a hoops nerd opinion to have Kawhi very close to the top of the best players, but people seem to have forgotten (or never even knew) that he was an MVP caliber player before the Raptors</p>

      <label for="l6x2dze" class="commentText"><p>At the time Kawhi won his first finals MVP he wasn&rsquo;t even the 2nd option on the team. It was just as much of a fluke FMVP as Igoudala. They literally gave him the award because he was guarding the best player on the planet (<em>exactly</em> the same reason Iguodala won it).</p>

<p>Remember this is a thread about the 4th best player&hellip; Kawhi was NEVER close to Lebron/Steph/Durant. I don&rsquo;t care about your &ldquo;what-if&rdquo; scenarios vs GSW if he didn&rsquo;t get hurt. Part of being an all-time great player is not being hurt all the time. Harden was a true ironman and gave more of a challege to that GSW team (w/ Durant) than anyone else, including Lebron.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Theres a very solid argument that Kawhi should have won Westbrook’s MVP.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now thats one of the best jokes I&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p>

      <label for="l6x4enn" class="commentText"><p>Including VORP and total points lean more towards your point of him being injured from 2017-2018. It doesn’t mean that 12 or 21 players were in the same stratosphere of player as Khawi. That’s always been my gripe with advance stats because a superstar who plays 22 years is going to have better advance stats than one who plays 14. </p>

<p>I do think it’s a tight race between him and Harden. I lean more towards Harden because he’s the most underrated superstar of our time and he’s put up dominant regular seasons and he’s both a floor and ceiling raiser when given a good team. I do think 2016,2017 was probably more dominant than 2017-2019 Harden </p>

<p>He was 6th on his team in PPG in the WCF. Outscored by Duncan, Ginobili, Diaw, Parker, and Green. The number one option does not do that and win.</p>

<p>Basically, the reason Kawhi was able to get all of those shots was because Diaw added on an even greater level of spacing and ball movement.</p>

      <label for="l6wczrx" class="commentText"><p>I’m a big fan of Stanimal but he’s a bit overrated by most. Yes, he won 3 slams, and did it in epic fashion. But Murray won 3 slams with 14 Masters1000 (to Wawrinka’s 1), an ATP Finals (Wawrinka never did this), 2 Olympic Gold medals (Wawrinka has none in singles, 1 in doubles though) and time as the #1 player in the world (Wawrinka peaked at #3). </p>

<p>Wawrinka had a relatively short prime (2013-2017) compared to Murray’s (2008-2017) which is part of the reason his stats are worse, but he also really peaked at best of 5 grand slams. Definition of a big match player, great endurance and nerve management, but in best of 3 matches outside the grand slams he took a lot of losses to randoms and was dominated by other top players.</p>

      <label for="l6wpjon" class="commentText"><p>I’ve seen calculations where someone simulated that period from like 2005-2020 without the big 3, and Murray finished with 16 slams which would’ve put him above Sampras’s 14 (and obviously the big 3 wouldn’t exist with their 20+ slams each). So it’s a possibility. </p>

<p>But I do question how good he’d be without the big 3. I feel like they pushed him to reach another level. Maybe without them, he’d win like 7-8 slams but not have as much consistency or as high of a peak level. It’s an interesting what if though. </p>

<p>The big 3 have commented how they pushed each other to be better too, and you can see it in their rivalries. Nadal and Federer dominated Djokovic until he exploded in 2011 with one of the greatest seasons of all time, if not the greatest. He started the season on like a 42 match win streak and beat Nadal in 7 finals in a row. That pushed Nadal to adjust his game and from that point forwards, Nadal started being way more aggressive which led to him winning the next <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> matchups against Djokovic. </p>

<p>Adjustments like that kept happening throughout the era between the three, like old man Fed finally managing to win 5 in a row on Nadal after having been throughly dominated by him throughout their careers. Nadal single-handedly made Federer’s backhand way better. </p>

But also Wawrinka was weirdly cracked against Djokovic at the slams, meanwhile he couldn’t get much going against Nadal or Federer (off clay). His one big win over Nadal was when Nadal’s back was injured.</p>

      <label for="l6wsx3g" class="commentText"><p>What about 2016? That was his best season.</p>

<p>Murray would be disappointing relative to big 3 standards sure, but relative to everyone else&rsquo;s standards he did as well as he could. You have to remember you&rsquo;re talking about matches against the three greatest players of all time in their primes.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like Wawrinka hasn&rsquo;t gotten his fair share of beatings. RG2013 and 2017 he got murdered by Nadal 6-3 6-2 6-1 both times. Federer beat him 6-4 6-3 6-1 at USO2015. His overall H2H vs Nadal is 3-19; 3-23 vs Federer.</p>

<p>Ferrer was also consistently getting killed by big 3 and Murray in his prime.</p>

      <label for="l6vql78" class="commentText"><p>I think that the only two answers are Harden and Kawhi.</p>

<p>And it’s a super interesting question because they have such different careers.</p>

<p>While the bias raptors fan in me wants to say Kawhi, I think it has to be harden. Kawhi might have been a “better” player at his best, but Harden really defines the 2010s style more than anyone - with the possible exception of curry.*</p>

<p>I think that Harden’s career has been diminished by the media/narratives. In reality, he’s a transcendentally great player.</p>

<p>A lot of people say that kids in pickup try to emulate curry. But in my experience, harden has had an even more profound impact on the game. Everything down to his posture was imitated by a generation. He pioneered the “double step back” which is somehow not a travel, despite how it looks in real time.</p>

<p>I love Kawhi, and if I were drafting a team guaranteeing health I’d probably choose him. But harden is quintessentially 2010 NBA</p>

<ul>
<li>I say possible exception because curry is a freak of nature who defies all we know about shooting. A lot of people try to be him but literally nobody comes close.</li>

      <label for="l6x14ly" class="commentText"><p>I would say there’s about the same distance between Curry and KD as there is between KD and Kawhi/Harden.</p>

<p>KD arguably has 0 titles as the team’s best player, and 1 MVP.  All the scoring titles elevate him, but how much does that really matter if he can’t show that it produces title-winning basketball outside the already proven Warriors?</p>

<p>Curry has 4 titles as the team’s best player (his unique offensive game was still the primary engine of those KD Warrior teams being undefendable, I think that has proven out over the years), and 2 MVPs, and completely altered how basketball is played.</p>

<p>Kawhi has 2 titles, at least 1 as the clear best player and 0 MVP.  Harden 0 titles and 1 MVP.</p>

<p>Durant is this iconically efficient volume scorer, but you could argue a healthy Kawhi is more impactful to winning, and you could argue Harden is a similarly iconic offensive machine who also couldn’t win on his own.  There’s a solid argument that Durant is regarded above Harden mainly because he went to the Warriors, and above Kawhi mainly because he didn’t get injured as much.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Curry is something completely different.</p>

      <label for="l6vyjt4" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s Chris Paul or Harden.</p>

<p>CP3 in the 2010&rsquo;s was 3x All NBA 1st team, 3x All NBA 2nd team, 1x All NBA 3rd team, 6x All NBA Defensive first team, 1x All NBA Defensive 2nd team, 7x All Star.</p>

<p>Harden in the 2010&rsquo;s was 1x MVP, 1x 6MOY, 6x All NBA 1st team, 1x All NBA 3rd team, 9x All Star.</p>

<p>IMO those 2 are interchangeable for number <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>. I think perhaps Harden gets the slight nod (just because a larger portion of his peak was in the 2010&rsquo;s whereas some of Pauls best years were in the late 2000&rsquo;s) and then I have Kawhi/Westbrook after them.</p>

<p>If we&rsquo;re discussing highest peak then it&rsquo;s IMO Kawhi but I think injuries really robbed him of a lot of the accolades one would need to be listed here.</p>

<p>However, while CP3 was also very deserving of MVP, the context around Kobe winning is important to remember. That was the worst statistical year of Kobe&rsquo;s peak but that was also the year that Kobe finally emerged as a leader and anyone watching back then, myself included, can understand why he won it given how well he was getting his team to perform that year. Now, had the NBA given Kobe his actual supposed MVP in 06 then it&rsquo;s very possible that Paul wins in 08 but no one at all back then considered Kobe winning in 08 a wrong decision. It&rsquo;s just something that got brought up much later on when people go back and just look at the stats without understanding the context of why he won it.</p>

Even with his hated playstyle he was still an absolute freak in his prime and IMO a very unfortunaye event away from a ring as a first option</p>

Melo didn’t win any MVPs, or lead a team to multiple Conference finals, or even to a finals. And if we’re gonna give Kawhi credit for beating Bron and Curry, why wouldn’t KD get credit for beating Kawhi?</p>

Harden nearly beat a KD team where KD was the second option, on perhaps the greatest team ever. KD never went to the finals without Harden or Curry.</p>

<p>Kawhi and Harden were always the first options. Draymond was point forward on 4 championship teams. Dwyane Wade was the second option for just as many titles, and more conference finals.</p>

<p>KD is supremely talented, but results should matter. That&rsquo;s why they keep score.</p>

      <label for="l6wonc1" class="commentText"><p>Curry was still better than KD. Wade and KD were both second options, and I&rsquo;d argue Draymond was more important than KD, because his contributions had no overlap with Curry/Klay. Curry and the team literally valued Draymond over KD and have persisted through some pain to keep him around.</p>

<p>And obviously almost that exact same Warriors team won without KD. So it&rsquo;s hard to argue that he was &lsquo;most valuable&rsquo; in retrospect.</p>

<p>Yes, FMVP is a real achievement, but that represents a handful of games and a built-in bias for scoring. Which the Warriors had plenty of, anyway. And the OKC team lost with him as the leader.</p>

<p>If the achievements are so close, shouldn&rsquo;t the tiebreaker be which championship team was weaker around the two stars? Was Bosh better than Draymond? Bosh is underrated, but he was hardly better than Draymond.</p>

<p>KD is clearly better than Wade in talent and height, but this is about achievement and I think it&rsquo;s awful to dismiss the alternatives out of hand.</p>

<p>Is Bosh getting forgotten here? Third best on a championship team, but arguably those were thin teams and they did very well for a two years stretch there.

Why would you not consider it more dominating than KDs performance, exceptional though it may be. people here counting WCF wins etc, by that metric no one comes close to LeBron in any period of basketball. Would they say he is better than MJ?</p>

      <label for="l6waya9" class="commentText"><p>If you are counting from the 10-11 season to the 19-20 season, you can&rsquo;t leave out Giannis, as he had 2 MVPs, a ring and FMVP, 1 DPOY, 3 all-NBA, 4 all-defense. Obviously he&rsquo;s not someone you&rsquo;re considering because he didn&rsquo;t really even start to break out until 16-17, but he actually played 4 more games than Kawhi (528 to 524) in that span, and way more minutes.<br>
<a href="https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=compare+statistics+of+kawhi+leonard+and+giannis+antetokounmpo+from+2010-11+to+2019-20+seasons" target="_blank">https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=compare+statistics+of+kawhi+leonard+and+giannis+antetokounmpo+from+2010-11+to+2019-20+seasons</a></p>

<p>Giannis actually surpasses Kawhi on all counting stats except steals (though they are equal in stocks), and I think it would be hard to say Giannis didn&rsquo;t have a higher peak.</p>

<p>While it makes sense to not consider Giannis a 2010s player on the one hand, on the other hand, with the way his 2020s are going, his 2010s stats/accolades may end up being more impressive if you are grading on an arbitrary decade basis. As great as he still is, I don&rsquo;t really see him getting another MVP or championship with all the other talent that is coming up, and the sheer difficulty of constructing and keeping a championship-calibre team together.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like the argument for Jordan in the 80s - no one would say it was his best decade, but could you keep him off the all-time team for that decade? I certainly couldn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>

He should also be ranked in the context of WWE characters who are so powerful that they carry the narrative.  Taking out KD and Lebron, there are the three you listed: Leonard, Westbrook, Harden.   Put aside, for a moment, that Leonard actually swing a championship in the Toronto story arc.  The gravity of Leonard’s movements had decade-defining story structure for SAS, Toronto, OKC, IND, and LAC.  whereas, Harden and Westbrook look more like chess pieces in the game controlled by the GMs.</p>

      <label for="l6wonkx" class="commentText"><p>I think Kahwi barely has the edge. And after that I want to say Russ but it’s probably Harden, then Russ, the CP3. It’s really hard to say someone who’s been an MVP candidate at the same time as another MVP but has two chips and a dpoy is the worse player. But I also do subscribe to the take that Kawhi is the worst superstar, maybe ever. His all time stats are similar to career role players.</p>

      <label for="l6x0w2m" class="commentText"><p>You people put too much emphasis on scoring. You play the game to WIN. Kawhi was the top guy on TWO championship teams. Durant was a big contributor but never THE guy. It should go Lebron, Curry, Kawhi, Durant, Harden for the 2010s.</p>

      <label for="l6x19sz" class="commentText"><p>Harden and Westbrook are the most overrated ‘stars’ of all time. It’s no surprise that teams with them fail in the playoffs. Houston during the Harden era had the worst style of basketball to watch that I have ever seen. The fact that people on here consistently defend these two blows my mind.</p>

<p>Kawhi is easily better than both. Was arguably the best player on one chip and led a team that had never won before to another. IMO he has an argument over Durant too. Kawhi would have also  won those two chips with Curry and the Dubs dynasty.</p>
