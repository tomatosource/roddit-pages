</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Clearly, the trio of LeBron, Curry and Durant own the top spots (whether you have Curry over KD or KD over Curry is another debate altogether), but similar to tennis there is a question of who is closest to the big three (Andy Murray maybe), and I think Kawhi has a decent argument.</p>

<p>Leonard&rsquo;s accolades: 2 FMVPs, 2 championships, 1 DPOY, 6 all-NBA&rsquo;s (1st teams in 2016, 2017 and 2021)</p>

<p>Some others that could contend for the no 4. spot: Westbrook, Harden, CP3 etc</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t an attempt to create a Mount Rushmore, as I do think whoever slides in at no 4 is not nearly as relevant as the aforementioned three. However, Kawhi (barring Dirk and Kobe, but they were best in the 2000s) is the only number one option to win a championship during the trio&rsquo;s primes, and he did it twice. While he doesn&rsquo;t quite make a quartet with LBJ, Steph and KD, Leonard is in a separate trio as one of the three players to have won a FMVP and a DPOY, in the elite company of Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon.</p>

<p>Have I missed someone, or is the question itself obsolete?</p>

      <label for="l6vocr0" class="commentText"><p>The problem with “the only number one option to win a championship” is that being a number one on a championship team doesn’t necessarily mean you’re better than a player who wasn’t on a championship team.</p>

<p>I feel like for Kawhi to get the nod here we’d have to REALLY be placing a ton of emphasis on that 2019 ring. He wasn’t in the league the first two years of this decade, spent a lot of time after as a role payer, missed a chunk of games most years and pretty much the entire year in 2018.. makes his resume outside of team accomplishments a little shallow. He has just 3 AS teams and 3 All-NBA nods in this stretch, 63 players have scored more points than him in this decade, 21 players have more win-shares, 12 have a higher VORP, 7 a better PER, and 4 a better BPM..</p>

<p>Stats above queried for players from <sup>2009</sup>&frasl;<sub>2010</sub> season - <sup>2018</sup>&frasl;<sub>2019</sub> season, players with 8,000+ points.</p>

<p>I’d probably lean Harden but I know how unpopular that take will be given his teams relative lack of playoff success.</p>

<p>Westbrook:</p>

<p>-Was a 20+ ppg scorer for the ENTIRE decade</p>

<p>-Unheard of 2016 (edit: meant 2017) MVP triple double season with an insane story and pretty much single-handedly carried that team to the playoffs</p>

<p>-Averaged a triple double for two straight years after that as well</p>

<p>-3 other top-5 seasons in MVP voting, as well as two other top-10s</p>

<p>-Finals appearance, multiple conference finals appearances, tons of playoffs wins</p>

<p>-On a new team, ended the decade with a then-career high in FG% and raised his PPG to near the top of the league</p>

<p>-2 times assists leader, 2 times scoring leader</p>

<p>-2 All Star Game MVPs</p>

      <label for="l6vx498" class="commentText"><p>Sure, but I think one of the biggest factors in this debate should be the player’s longevity for the entirety of the 2010s, so that’s another reason I go Westbrook over Harden.</p>

<p>Harden was still a 6th man during the first two years of the decade, Westbrook was again already putting up 20+ ppg as a starter.</p>

<p>Also, Harden had 4 seasons playing 80+ games compared to Westbrook’s 5 seasons doing so.</p>

      <label for="l6w4ugr" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s very tough given how little he played, that&rsquo;s fair. But he was absolutely outstanding in 2016 and 2017. In 16, he was mvp runner up because he was fully, unquestionably the best player on a 67 win team which just happened to be outclassed by the warriors but we already know curry is better. But he was, in the regular season, the 2nd or 3rd best player, in large part because Lebron was coasting but all the same. In 2017 he was way better. The mvp race was deservedly between Harden and Westbrook but what kind of gets forgotten is that kawhi was closer than people thought near the end of the season in 3rd place. And when he played both, he was the best player on the court which was one of the arguments for him. He had an insane playoffs that year as well and legitimately looked like he could be as good as KD and Curry. Then the injuries happen and he has an amazing 2019 but there is truth to the fact the team was very good as well. But he was the reason they won and in the playoffs, he played better than Harden on average between 16-19 with a 28-4-8-2-1 on 50-40-89 shooting vs Harden&rsquo;s 29-6-7-2-1 on 41-31-87 and, fwiw those are like the very best harden years too so it&rsquo;s not that much cherry picking.</p>

<p>Now to be clear, I&rsquo;d have Harden, the reality is he was the best player on a contender for years and did it every year and also was the better regular season player on average too which does mean something. Even in the tiny range I highlighted, which is only 40% of the decade, Kawhi only played in <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> playoffs. So it&rsquo;s not like I disagree with you. People underrate Harden a lot too. The unfair thing to Harden weirdly was that his regular season performance would have you think he could be a top 15 player of all time and compete with steph and kd but then he clearly wasn&rsquo;t as good in the playoffs so the contrast looked so bad. But he still played well in the playoffs, even despite the percentages. He just wasn&rsquo;t top 15 all time good. Also people hated his style but whatever. So I do have Harden over Kawhi but I do think if we&rsquo;re picking the 4th &ldquo;best&rdquo; player, I&rsquo;d pick uninjured Kawhi to lead my team and feel like people sort of forget how amazing Kawhi was at his best even outside of the raptors year.</p>

<p>Great player, but his career is a what-if because of all the injuries. I&rsquo;ll take James even though he never had the career-defining playoff series. Kawhi is probably better than Harden, but at some point availability has to count for something if we&rsquo;re talking full career.</p>

<p>And no matter how many times people just lump it together as &ldquo;2x FMVP,&rdquo; no one is ever going to forget that one of them was an Iguodala, Tony Parker, Cedric Maxwell type FMVP.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the only number one option to win a championship during the trio&rsquo;s primes, and he did it twice.</p>

<p>He was 6th on his team in PPG in the WCF. Outscored by Duncan, Ginobili, Diaw, Parker, and Green. The number one option does not do that and win.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think the 2014 championship was that undeserved, personally. Of course there&rsquo;s a discussion but Duncan and Leonard were both playing very well.</p>

I want to emphasize that Harden shot 24% from the three on 11 attempts per game! Also Harden won game 5 by 4 points despite shooting <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>21</sub>, 0/11 from three, and having 4 assists on 6 turnovers.</p>

<p>I think there is a little more context to that series than just &ldquo;Harden taking the most stacked team of all time to 7 games.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l6vql78" class="commentText"><p>I think that the only two answers are Harden and Kawhi.</p>

<p>And it’s a super interesting question because they have such different careers.</p>

<p>While the bias raptors fan in me wants to say Kawhi, I think it has to be harden. Kawhi might have been a “better” player at his best, but Harden really defines the 2010s style more than anyone - with the possible exception of curry.*</p>

<p>I think that Harden’s career has been diminished by the media/narratives. In reality, he’s a transcendentally great player.</p>

<p>A lot of people say that kids in pickup try to emulate curry. But in my experience, harden has had an even more profound impact on the game. Everything down to his posture was imitated by a generation. He pioneered the “double step back” which is somehow not a travel, despite how it looks in real time.</p>

<p>I love Kawhi, and if I were drafting a team guaranteeing health I’d probably choose him. But harden is quintessentially 2010 NBA</p>

<ul>
<li>I say possible exception because curry is a freak of nature who defies all we know about shooting. A lot of people try to be him but literally nobody comes close.</li>

But even that was nowhere near some of Harden’s baffling performances. Curry has had bad games in the playoffs, just like everyone else, but you’d be hard pressed to find anything as bad as Harden’s 2017 performance against the Kawhi-less Spurs for example.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s one you will understand.  KD won 2 FMVP&rsquo;s while playing with Curry.  He took over Curry&rsquo;s team and outplayed him in the playoffs.  Curry got outplayed by Iggy  while playing against the worst Finals team ever in 2015.  There is no argument for Curry over Durant in the 2010&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>KD was up 3-1 on them with mediocre spacing. The Grizzlies took them to 6 in 2015 and they were 2-0 down in the finals to Lebron and Mozgov. Of course they also lost in 7 to the Cavs in 2016 when the 2017 Cavs were a far better team.</p>

You are correct, however, he wasn&rsquo;t ultimately successful outside of the GSW years, but he had some good runs on the Thunder, losing to the Heatles in the finals in 2012, and being a different shoe-size away from beating the eventual champions in 2021.</p>

During his time at Golden State you can look up the advanced stats, KD was dependent on Curry being on the court for success, but the opposite wasn&rsquo;t true. Opposing teams prioritised Curry, which opened up KD. It&rsquo;s simple really, KD needed Curry to be successful, Curry didn&rsquo;t need KD</p>

<p>They lost the championship the previous year to a significantly worse Cavs squad than 2017.</p>

<p>In 2016, KD was up 3-1 on them. The Grizzlies took them to 6 in 2015. Lebron was 2-0 up on them with Mozgov as his #2</p>

<p>Curry is up there with Bron, y’all still can’t stop hating but Curry influenced basketball around the world and completely changed the game, on top of that he has 3 rings in that decade all led by him and the team built around him. </p>

<p>Then we add the back to back MVPs and one of them is the only unanimous MVP in the history of basketball.</p>

<p>He was in <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> finals, <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> all-nba first team, <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> all-defensive first team. You could even make the case that he was a groin injury away from being all-nba first team for the entire decade.</p>

      <label for="l6vyjt4" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s Chris Paul or Harden.</p>

<p>CP3 in the 2010&rsquo;s was 3x All NBA 1st team, 3x All NBA 2nd team, 1x All NBA 3rd team, 6x All NBA Defensive first team, 1x All NBA Defensive 2nd team, 7x All Star.</p>

<p>Harden in the 2010&rsquo;s was 1x MVP, 1x 6MOY, 6x All NBA 1st team, 1x All NBA 3rd team, 9x All Star.</p>

<p>IMO those 2 are interchangeable for number <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>. I think perhaps Harden gets the slight nod (just because a larger portion of his peak was in the 2010&rsquo;s whereas some of Pauls best years were in the late 2000&rsquo;s) and then I have Kawhi/Westbrook after them.</p>

<p>If we&rsquo;re discussing highest peak then it&rsquo;s IMO Kawhi but I think injuries really robbed him of a lot of the accolades one would need to be listed here.</p>

<p>Highest peak for me was Harden’s though, unstoppable scoring machine and the second best team in the league at some point, I really doubt the Cavs would beat those top tier Rockets teams, Harden was almost the entire offense of that team.</p>

Noah and Gasol were very good players but they are nowhere close to what an All NBA 1st team Center should be.</p>

      <label for="l6vntlg" class="commentText"><p>Healthy Kawhi is a top tier all time great imo. His playoff stats in his prime compare favorably to any wing, and he is better defensively than almost all of them even after his defense declined from its peak. Just checked his b-ball reference and grabbed some games from 2016 to 2021 playoffs. In that stretch, 28.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.3 on 51/39/89 efficiency. Considering his defense, this stacks up well with anyone. And the eye test confirms. He doesn’t stat chase in the regular season, probably the pop influence there. </p>

<p> That said, I think Kawhi is at least equal with Durant and Curry. I’d place them all in the same tier honestly. Curry in the regular season, probably lean Kawhi then Durant in the playoffs. </p>

<p>LeBron is the best of the era, then you have that trio of all time greats. Pretty cool that all 4 will be in Olympics </p>

      <label for="l6vqj7x" class="commentText"><p>You cannot just cherry pick stats to fit your narrative. Steph is one of the greatest offensive engines of all time. He is the greatest shooter of all time, the greatest off-ball player of all time and the second best pg of all time. 4 rings, 2 mvps (1 unanimous, never done in history), 1 fmvp (deserved 2), the best player of a dynasty, three consecutive seasons with at least 67 wins, (67-15, 73-9, 67-15). And btw, great offense beats great defense everytime. Steph&rsquo;s offense &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Kawhi&rsquo;s defense. There are a whole bunch of defensive anchors you would pick for your team before picking Kawhi. On the other hand, Ty Lue self admittedly doubled Steph with KD and Klay on the floor. That tells you everything you need to know. Steph can get you a 50 piece victory in a game 7 that too in the opponent&rsquo;s court.</p>

      <label for="l6vr7lz" class="commentText"><p>Those are not cherry picked stats. That’s a 6 year span of him playing in the playoffs at his peak. And peak Kawhi in the playoffs is more effective than peak Curry and Durant. People underrate Kawhi because he sort of lays back in the regular season, not uncommon for pop coaches players. But in the playoffs the only wings in his class are the Mount Rushmore guys. Seriously, check the stats for him in the playoffs and compare to Curry and KD. Then consider the defense gap. Kawhi was better in the playoffs.</p>

<p>If we are talking accolades and legacy yeah I agree. But if you need to win a best of 7, I want LeBron, then Kawhi, then Curry/Durant.</p>

<p>If we are talking accolades and legacy yeah I agree. But if you need to win a best of 7, I want LeBron, then Kawhi, then Curry/Durant.</p>

<p>Lmao. From 2015 to 2019 Steph never lost a playoff series in the tougher western conference. Went to the finals all 5 times. Steph won before KD, with KD and after KD. And somehow Kawhi is the better playoff performer lol.</p>

      <label for="l6vqsp0" class="commentText"><p>Third or fourth. Kd and LeBron are locked at 1-2, Curry and Kawhi could swap 3-4. Harden is at the 5.</p>

<p>It’s controversial due to the accolade differential, but there’s an argument for Curry at the 4. People seem to forget that in Kawhi’s prime, he was as good as LeBron and KD. Whereas Curry (with all due respect) was never considered the best in the league and was always slightly below those two.</p>

<p>And I’m not hating, I love Curry. I’d still take Curry because of how much he gives to an offense. I’m just making it clear that Kawhi <em>is absolutely</em> in that tier with those 3. He was in the big 3 in those years, not Curry. It’s revisionist to say otherwise and Kawhi doesn’t get the respect he deserves for it</p>

<li>Because those teams were that bad without russ. Look at their stats when he was off the floor.</li>
<li>2016-17. Obviously team full of Tristans is an exaggeration but those teams were atrocious.</li>
<li>Kyle kuzma averages 22 on the wizards. It&rsquo;s the wizards, doesn&rsquo;t really mean much. Russ was ABSOLUTELY washed in LA and him being a horrible fit with them didn&rsquo;t help. Idk how Lebron and AD being All-NBA addresses my point that it was a horribly built team, I thought we learned our lesson from Brooklyn and Phoenix that 2-3 guys won&rsquo;t lead to success.</li>

      <label for="l6w0aba" class="commentText"><p>This thread is severely overinflating Kyrie&rsquo;s accomplishments lol I like him but winning a ring as a second option doesn&rsquo;t mean he eclipses Harden as a better player during that period of time. This sub has chronic bad takes it seems.</p>

      <label for="l6vppah" class="commentText"><p>Are you sure about that? The raptors had a much much better all around team than the warriors those finals. They also boxed and oned curry the whole series, and he still put up 30 ppg. He also put up 47 pts in game 3 which he lost because all 5 of the raptors starters scored 17 or more pts.</p>

      <label for="l6vpmpt" class="commentText"><p>To be fair, Curry&rsquo;s superstar teammate tore his Achilles in those finals. Whether it was at all fair that Curry even had Durant in the first place is separate discussion, but I think an injury to any starter let alone an MVP is something to consider.</p>

      <label for="l6vqrv4" class="commentText"><p>It was more than just KD going down, Steph had just returned from injury like literally 1 game prior plus Klay got hurt as well.  He was missing his two best teammates, much of which their entire offense was based around, and he himself was hurt. Meanwhile Kawhi had his full squad around him and they had continuity all playoffs. The advantage was about as far in the Toronto direction as it could possibly be.</p>

<p>Like, if during game 1 Tatum comes back from injury only to lose brown, KP, and white for the series, would anyone really blame him for losing the series? At that point you’re screwed, it’s way too soon to game plan for that in the finals. You lost <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of your most important players and the one you have is hobbled.</p>

      <label for="l6vpze7" class="commentText"><p>But almost everyone that will reply to this comment will have Curry over KD, say his rings don&rsquo;t count, the Warriors were overpowered ect. So losing KD still leaves them with 3-4 hall of famers and it wasn&rsquo;t close.</p>

      <label for="l6w7ts1" class="commentText"><p>lol. curry was better in the finals. and if somebody will argue Kawhi was better or similar level, to say &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t particularly close&rdquo; is a clown take.
not to mention that curry has a much better career overall and that&rsquo;s actually something that&rsquo;s not particulary close lol.</p>

<p>the whole Kawhi lore is built on that ECF run, and &ldquo;what if&rdquo; scenarios forgetting all the times he was healthy and the favourite in the series and still lost (2016 against the Thunder who then lost against the Warriors, and in 2020 against the Nuggets as a heavy favorite, especially after going up 3-1)</p>
