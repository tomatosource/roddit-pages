</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Clearly, the trio of LeBron, Curry and Durant own the top spots (whether you have Curry over KD or KD over Curry is another debate altogether), but similar to tennis there is a question of who is closest to the big three (Andy Murray maybe), and I think Kawhi has a decent argument.</p>

<p>Leonard&rsquo;s accolades: 2 FMVPs, 2 championships, 1 DPOY, 6 all-NBA&rsquo;s (1st teams in 2016, 2017 and 2021)</p>

<p>Some others that could contend for the no 4. spot: Westbrook, Harden, CP3 etc</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t an attempt to create a Mount Rushmore, as I do think whoever slides in at no 4 is not nearly as relevant as the aforementioned three. However, Kawhi (barring Dirk and Kobe, but they were best in the 2000s) is the only number one option to win a championship during the trio&rsquo;s primes, and he did it twice. While he doesn&rsquo;t quite make a quartet with LBJ, Steph and KD, Leonard is in a separate trio as one of the three players to have won a FMVP and a DPOY, in the elite company of Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon.</p>

<p>Have I missed someone, or is the question itself obsolete?</p>

      <label for="l6vocr0" class="commentText"><p>The problem with “the only number one option to win a championship” is that being a number one on a championship team doesn’t necessarily mean you’re better than a player who wasn’t on a championship team.</p>

<p>I feel like for Kawhi to get the nod here we’d have to REALLY be placing a ton of emphasis on that 2019 ring. He wasn’t in the league the first two years of this decade, spent a lot of time after as a role payer, missed a chunk of games most years and pretty much the entire year in 2018.. makes his resume outside of team accomplishments a little shallow. He has just 3 AS teams and 3 All-NBA nods in this stretch, 63 players have scored more points than him in this decade, 21 players have more win-shares, 12 have a higher VORP, 7 a better PER, and 4 a better BPM..</p>

<p>Stats above queried for players from <sup>2009</sup>&frasl;<sub>2010</sub> season - <sup>2018</sup>&frasl;<sub>2019</sub> season, players with 8,000+ points.</p>

<p>I’d probably lean Harden but I know how unpopular that take will be given his teams relative lack of playoff success.</p>

      <label for="l6w4ugr" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s very tough given how little he played, that&rsquo;s fair. But he was absolutely outstanding in 2016 and 2017. In 16, he was mvp runner up because he was fully, unquestionably the best player on a 67 win team which just happened to be outclassed by the warriors but we already know curry is better. But he was, in the regular season, the 2nd or 3rd best player, in large part because Lebron was coasting but all the same. In 2017 he was way better. The mvp race was deservedly between Harden and Westbrook but what kind of gets forgotten is that kawhi was closer than people thought near the end of the season in 3rd place. And when he played both, he was the best player on the court which was one of the arguments for him. He had an insane playoffs that year as well and legitimately looked like he could be as good as KD and Curry. Then the injuries happen and he has an amazing 2019 but there is truth to the fact the team was very good as well. But he was the reason they won and in the playoffs, he played better than Harden on average between 16-19 with a 28-8-4-2-1 on 50-40-89 shooting vs Harden&rsquo;s 29-6-7-2-1 on 41-31-87 and, fwiw those are like the very best harden years too so it&rsquo;s not that much cherry picking.</p>

<p>Now to be clear, I&rsquo;d have Harden, the reality is he was the best player on a contender for years and did it every year and also was the better regular season player on average too which does mean something. Even in the tiny range I highlighted, which is only 40% of the decade, Kawhi only played in <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> playoffs. So it&rsquo;s not like I disagree with you. People underrate Harden a lot too. The unfair thing to Harden weirdly was that his regular season performance would have you think he could be a top 15 player of all time and compete with steph and kd but then he clearly wasn&rsquo;t as good in the playoffs so the contrast looked so bad. But he still played well in the playoffs, even despite the percentages. He just wasn&rsquo;t top 15 all time good. Also people hated his style but whatever. So I do have Harden over Kawhi but I do think if we&rsquo;re picking the 4th &ldquo;best&rdquo; player, I&rsquo;d pick uninjured Kawhi to lead my team and feel like people sort of forget how amazing Kawhi was at his best even outside of the raptors year.</p>

      <label for="l6vvvae" class="commentText"><p>Harden was my immediate thought too, but on second thought it really should be Westbrook for 4th best player of the decade.</p>

<p>Westbrook:</p>

<p>-Was a 20+ ppg scorer for the ENTIRE decade</p>

<p>-Unheard of 2016 (edit: meant 2017) MVP triple double season with an insane story and pretty much single-handedly carried that team to the playoffs</p>

<p>-Averaged a triple double for two straight years after that as well</p>

<p>-3 other top-5 seasons in MVP voting, as well as two other top-10s</p>

<p>-Finals appearance, multiple conference finals appearances, tons of playoffs wins</p>

<p>-On a new team, ended the decade with a then-career high in FG% and raised his PPG to near the top of the league</p>

<p>-2 times assists leader, 2 times scoring leader</p>

<p>-2 All Star Game MVPs</p>

      <label for="l6vx498" class="commentText"><p>Sure, but I think one of the biggest factors in this debate should be the player’s longevity for the entirety of the 2010s, so that’s another reason I go Westbrook over Harden.</p>

<p>Harden was still a 6th man during the first two years of the decade, Westbrook was again already putting up 20+ ppg as a starter.</p>

<p>Also, Harden had 4 seasons playing 80+ games compared to Westbrook’s 5 seasons doing so.</p>

      <label for="l6wui0j" class="commentText"><p>Heavily disagree. Half the points you make in favor of Westbrook are actually just in favor of Harden&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Even as a sixth man for part of the decade, Harden still averaged more points over the entire decade. I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s more important than arbitrarily saying over 20ppg every year.</p></li>

<li><p>Harden had 5 top 5 MVP seasons vs Westbrook&rsquo;s 4 (and three of Harden&rsquo;s were top 2 which Westbrook only had 1). He tops Westbrook there.</p></li>

<li><p>Harden led the league in scoring 3 times vs Westbrook&rsquo;s 2. They both lead the league in assists twice. In favor of Harden again.</p></li>

<li><p>Harden had 66 playoff wins vs Westbrook&rsquo;s 54. They both made 1 Finals appearance and 4 conference Finals appearances. Again, this is in favor of Harden.</p></li>

<li><p>Harden had 6 1st team All-NBA vs Westbrook&rsquo;s 2. Clear win for Harden</p></li>

<li><p>Harden had better FG%, 3P%, FT%, TS%, and had less turnovers a game. More efficient offensive player.</p></li>

<li><p>Harden had better PER, WS, WS/48, BPM, VORP. Basically any advanced stat says Harden was better.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Literally the only advantage Westbrook has is the whole triple double narrative. Harden was the better scorer, was more efficient, had better advanced stats, had more playoff success, more All-NBA 1st teams, was a more consistent MVP candidate, and did all of this as the 1st option for the majority of the decade while Westbrook was pretty consistently the #2 on his team.</p>

<p>Harden pretty clearly has the edge over Westbrook.</p>

      <label for="l6wy92a" class="commentText"><p>Oh good, a points per game argument. You really know your stuff there, random string of numbers guy.</p>

<p>Did you actually watch any games then? Kawhi’s peak was only a few seasons, sure, but he was the best basketball player on the planet at his peak, which is something Harden/Westbrook have never even sniffed.</p>

<p>People here keep saying Kawhi was only a top player for 3 years of the decade, but he was the fucking FINALS MVP in 2014. He was a top defender in the league for most of the decade, and won 2 DPOY awards.</p>

<p>Theres a very solid argument that Kawhi should have won Westbrook’s MVP.</p>

<p>At the moment Kawhi got hurt in the WCF against Golden State, he was beating the greatest team of all time by 20.</p>

<p>I know at the time it was sort of a hoops nerd opinion to have Kawhi very close to the top of the best players, but people seem to have forgotten (or never even knew) that he was an MVP caliber player before the Raptors</p>

      <label for="l6x2dze" class="commentText"><p>At the time Kawhi won his first finals MVP he wasn&rsquo;t even the 2nd option on the team. It was just as much of a fluke FMVP as Igoudala. They literally gave him the award because he was guarding the best player on the planet (<em>exactly</em> the same reason Iguodala won it).</p>

<p>Remember this is a thread about the 4th best player&hellip; Kawhi was NEVER close to Lebron/Steph/Durant. I don&rsquo;t care about your &ldquo;what-if&rdquo; scenarios vs GSW if he didn&rsquo;t get hurt. Part of being an all-time great player is not being hurt all the time. Harden was a true ironman and gave more of a challege to that GSW team (w/ Durant) than anyone else, including Lebron.</p>

      <label for="l6x9mdg" class="commentText"><p>I’m not going to respond an argument based on you just saying Kawhi’s accolades don’t count. He won FMVP. Sorry you don’t think he should have?</p>

<p>Kawhi was better than Lebron, Steph, and Durant in 2019.</p>

<p>Sure, Harden was an Ironman, I’ll concede that. If you want to put Harden above Kawhi based on availability, go ahead. I just don’t agree with you.</p>

<p>Kawhi received first place MVP votes in 2017, and was the best player in the league based on advanced stats. For whatever reason, the media decided that the triple double narrative was the most important thing in the world that year and voted accordingly, but the nerdier, analytical voters voted Kawhi and there have been additional voters who have said in hindsight they should have voted Kawhi that year.</p>

<p>Bron, Curry and KD are unquestionably the top tier.</p>

<p>Followed by Harden and Kawhi. You could argue for either and there’s no right/wrong.</p>

As in, people slightly underrated him during his prime because they hated his foul-baiting, but the man was a godly scorer. I think DWade vs Harden at #3 for best shooting guards of all time is a legit argument. </p>

He was consistently elite in the playoffs for like a 5 year stretch. And I mean elite like top 2 or 3 player in the league come playoff time. Meanwhile Harden was very inconsistent in the playoffs and even underperformed some years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the Rockets took the healthier Warriors to 7 with CP3 missing in 2 games.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah I mean the Spurs with Kawhi had a 20 point lead on the Warriors in 2017 game 1, then pretty much immediately once Kawhi got hurt, the Spurs lost that lead and got swept.</p>

<p>Harden was better reg season. Kawhi was better in playoffs. Depends what you value more.</p>

      <label for="l6znjtn" class="commentText"><p>He wasn&rsquo;t top 2 or 3 in 2016 over LeBron, Westbrook, KD, and maybe Curry and didn&rsquo;t make it past the second round. He was maybe the best with LeBron in 2017 but he got injured in the second round then &ldquo;missed&rdquo; the 2018 playoffs. He was obviously won in 2019 but choked in the 2020 conference semis against the Nuggets. In 2021 he plays well but gets injured again. So he&rsquo;s only played healthy in three out of six playoff series between 2016 and 2021 and only made it past conference semis in one out five attempts. So no doubt he was elite when perfectly healthy, he just never ventured that deep into playoffs enough for Playoff Kawhi to be a clear level above Harden. If anything, it&rsquo;s the injuries that has held Kawhi back, then and now, not revisionist history.</p>

      <label for="l6xzak6" class="commentText"><p>Harden from ‘18 onwards did not have “zero defense”. He was actually a very good post defender and a mediocre perimeter defender; the compilations of him falling asleep are mostly due to the fact that he had one of the highest offensive usage rates of all time.</p>

<p>I would take prime Harden over prime Kawhi, only because the best ability is availability. If Kawhi was consistently healthy, I would take him over Harden in a heartbeat and IMO he would be a top 10 player of all time fairly easily. He was putting up 30 ppg on insane efficiency in the playoffs, while being a great 3 point shooter and (imo) the best perimeter defender of all time (at least for the Spurs, for the Raptors not quite).</p>

<p>I think Harden is generally very underrated, but when healthy Kawhi is undoubtedly superior.</p>

      <label for="l6y24qq" class="commentText"><p>Harden was never really &ldquo;zero defense,&rdquo; he just had a hell of a blooper real.  He floated between below average and above average defense depending on the year(s).  So the question really is whether you prefer an S-tier offensive player with average defense for 75 games per year, or an S-tier defensive player with great offense for 60 games per year.</p>

<p>I would go with Kawhi personally in terms of best player over that decade.  If it was best peak over that decade, I&rsquo;d probably lean toward Harden.</p>

      <label for="l6xdjcz" class="commentText"><p>I guess I just disagree because Kawhi consistently elevated during the playoffs while Harden was infamous for disappearing. Look at Harden’s playoff FG% from that era. Kawhi probably could’ve jumped into the top tier of players had his body held up but instead he got two chips and a finals MVP.</p>

But Murray won 3 slams with 14 Masters1000 (to Wawrinka’s 1), an ATP Finals (Wawrinka never did this), 2 Olympic Gold medals (Wawrinka has none in singles, 1 in doubles though) and time as the #1 player in the world (Wawrinka peaked at #3). </p>

<p>Wawrinka had a relatively short prime (2013-2017) compared to Murray’s (2008-2017) which is part of the reason his stats are worse, but he also really peaked at best of 5 grand slams. Definition of a big match player, great endurance and nerve management, but in best of 3 matches outside the grand slams he took a lot of losses to randoms and was dominated by other top players.</p>

      <label for="l6wpjon" class="commentText"><p>I’ve seen calculations where someone simulated that period from like 2005-2020 without the big 3, and Murray finished with 16 slams which would’ve put him above Sampras’s 14 (and obviously the big 3 wouldn’t exist with their 20+ slams each). So it’s a possibility. </p>

<p>But I do question how good he’d be without the big 3. I feel like they pushed him to reach another level. Maybe without them, he’d win like 7-8 slams but not have as much consistency or as high of a peak level. It’s an interesting what if though. </p>

<p>The big 3 have commented how they pushed each other to be better too, and you can see it in their rivalries. Nadal and Federer dominated Djokovic until he exploded in 2011 with one of the greatest seasons of all time, if not the greatest. He started the season on like a 42 match win streak and beat Nadal in 7 finals in a row. That pushed Nadal to adjust his game and from that point forwards, Nadal started being way more aggressive which led to him winning the next <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> matchups against Djokovic. </p>

<p>Adjustments like that kept happening throughout the era between the three, like old man Fed finally managing to win 5 in a row on Nadal after having been throughly dominated by him throughout their careers. Nadal single-handedly made Federer’s backhand way better. </p>

      <label for="l6vql78" class="commentText"><p>I think that the only two answers are Harden and Kawhi.</p>

<p>And it’s a super interesting question because they have such different careers.</p>

<p>While the bias raptors fan in me wants to say Kawhi, I think it has to be harden. Kawhi might have been a “better” player at his best, but Harden really defines the 2010s style more than anyone - with the possible exception of curry.*</p>

<p>I think that Harden’s career has been diminished by the media/narratives. In reality, he’s a transcendentally great player.</p>

<p>A lot of people say that kids in pickup try to emulate curry. But in my experience, harden has had an even more profound impact on the game. Everything down to his posture was imitated by a generation. He pioneered the “double step back” which is somehow not a travel, despite how it looks in real time.</p>

<p>I love Kawhi, and if I were drafting a team guaranteeing health I’d probably choose him. But harden is quintessentially 2010 NBA</p>

<ul>
<li>I say possible exception because curry is a freak of nature who defies all we know about shooting. A lot of people try to be him but literally nobody comes close.</li>

      <label for="l6vyjt4" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s Chris Paul or Harden.</p>

<p>CP3 in the 2010&rsquo;s was 3x All NBA 1st team, 3x All NBA 2nd team, 1x All NBA 3rd team, 6x All NBA Defensive first team, 1x All NBA Defensive 2nd team, 7x All Star.</p>

<p>Harden in the 2010&rsquo;s was 1x MVP, 1x 6MOY, 6x All NBA 1st team, 1x All NBA 3rd team, 9x All Star.</p>

<p>IMO those 2 are interchangeable for number <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>. I think perhaps Harden gets the slight nod (just because a larger portion of his peak was in the 2010&rsquo;s whereas some of Pauls best years were in the late 2000&rsquo;s) and then I have Kawhi/Westbrook after them.</p>

<p>If we&rsquo;re discussing highest peak then it&rsquo;s IMO Kawhi but I think injuries really robbed him of a lot of the accolades one would need to be listed here.</p>

<p>and this conversation is specifically about the 2010s, if it was about 2015-2024 then yes you could say steph &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; KD. there is not argument that Steph &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; KD from 2010-2020, steph never even made a first team until 2015</p>

<p>Is Bosh getting forgotten here? Third best on a championship team, but arguably those were thin teams and they did very well for a two years stretch there. Him starting out in Toronto and getting a medical condition at the end pushed him into obscurity, when he was a very versatile big fit for the modern era, and obvs successful.</p>

      <label for="l6waya9" class="commentText"><p>If you are counting from the 10-11 season to the 19-20 season, you can&rsquo;t leave out Giannis, as he had 2 MVPs, a ring and FMVP, 1 DPOY, 3 all-NBA, 4 all-defense. Obviously he&rsquo;s not someone you&rsquo;re considering because he didn&rsquo;t really even start to break out until 16-17, but he actually played 4 more games than Kawhi (528 to 524) in that span, and way more minutes.<br>
<a href="https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=compare+statistics+of+kawhi+leonard+and+giannis+antetokounmpo+from+2010-11+to+2019-20+seasons" target="_blank">https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=compare+statistics+of+kawhi+leonard+and+giannis+antetokounmpo+from+2010-11+to+2019-20+seasons</a></p>

<p>Giannis actually surpasses Kawhi on all counting stats except steals (though they are equal in stocks), and I think it would be hard to say Giannis didn&rsquo;t have a higher peak.</p>

<p>While it makes sense to not consider Giannis a 2010s player on the one hand, on the other hand, with the way his 2020s are going, his 2010s stats/accolades may end up being more impressive if you are grading on an arbitrary decade basis. As great as he still is, I don&rsquo;t really see him getting another MVP or championship with all the other talent that is coming up, and the sheer difficulty of constructing and keeping a championship-calibre team together.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like the argument for Jordan in the 80s - no one would say it was his best decade, but could you keep him off the all-time team for that decade? I certainly couldn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>

He should also be ranked in the context of WWE characters who are so powerful that they carry the narrative.  Taking out KD and Lebron, there are the three you listed: Leonard, Westbrook, Harden.   Put aside, for a moment, that Leonard actually swing a championship in the Toronto story arc.  The gravity of Leonard’s movements had decade-defining story structure for SAS, Toronto, OKC, IND, and LAC.  whereas, Harden and Westbrook look more like chess pieces in the game controlled by the GMs.</p>

      <label for="l6xey37" class="commentText"><p>For me&hellip; the 5 best players during that era were LeBron James (1), Kevin Durant (2), Stephen Curry (3), Kawhi Leonard (4), and James Harden (5). Now that the era&rsquo;s over and we can look back on it&hellip; (1) LeBron James, (2) Stephen Curry, (3) Kevin Durant, (4) Kawhi Leonard, and (5) James Harden. Kawhi wasn&rsquo;t as good as long as Harden, but he was dominant as hell. The best two-way player in the world. The best perimeter defender of all time at one point. Won two FMVPs and a Championship&hellip; This list would have been completely different if he stayed healthy (2017 and 2018).</p>

      <label for="l6xfglu" class="commentText"><p>I think it’s definitely James Harden. Kawhi wasn’t healthy long enough. Harden’s prime lasted longer than Westbrook.
Wade’s name should be in the conversation.</p>
