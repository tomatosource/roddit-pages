      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1d6ybhb/whos_the_fourth_best_player_of_the_2010s_and_is/"><p>Who&rsquo;s the fourth best player of the 2010&rsquo;s and is it Kawhi Leonard?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Clearly, the trio of LeBron, Curry and Durant own the top spots (whether you have Curry over KD or KD over Curry is another debate altogether), but similar to tennis there is a question of who is closest to the big three (Andy Murray maybe), and I think Kawhi has a decent argument.</p>

<p>Leonard&rsquo;s accolades: 2 FMVPs, 2 championships, 1 DPOY, 6 all-NBA&rsquo;s (1st teams in 2016, 2017 and 2021)</p>

<p>Some others that could contend for the no 4. spot: Westbrook, Harden, CP3 etc</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t an attempt to create a Mount Rushmore, as I do think whoever slides in at no 4 is not nearly as relevant as the aforementioned three. However, Kawhi (barring Dirk and Kobe, but they were best in the 2000s) is the only number one option to win a championship during the trio&rsquo;s primes, and he did it twice. While he doesn&rsquo;t quite make a quartet with LBJ, Steph and KD, Leonard is in a separate trio as one of the three players to have won a FMVP and a DPOY, in the elite company of Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon.</p>

<p>Have I missed someone, or is the question itself obsolete?</p>

      <label for="l6vocr0" class="commentText"><p>The problem with “the only number one option to win a championship” is that being a number one on a championship team doesn’t necessarily mean you’re better than a player who wasn’t on a championship team.</p>

<p>I feel like for Kawhi to get the nod here we’d have to REALLY be placing a ton of emphasis on that 2019 ring. He wasn’t in the league the first two years of this decade, spent a lot of time after as a role payer, missed a chunk of games most years and pretty much the entire year in 2018.. makes his resume outside of team accomplishments a little shallow. He has just 3 AS teams and 3 All-NBA nods in this stretch, 63 players have scored more points than him in this decade, 21 players have more win-shares, 12 have a higher VORP, 7 a better PER, and 4 a better BPM..</p>

<p>Stats above queried for players from <sup>2009</sup>&frasl;<sub>2010</sub> season - <sup>2018</sup>&frasl;<sub>2019</sub> season, players with 8,000+ points.</p>

<p>I’d probably lean Harden but I know how unpopular that take will be given his teams relative lack of playoff success.</p>

      <label for="l6w4ugr" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s very tough given how little he played, that&rsquo;s fair. But he was absolutely outstanding in 2016 and 2017. In 16, he was mvp runner up because he was fully, unquestionably the best player on a 67 win team which just happened to be outclassed by the warriors but we already know curry is better. But he was, in the regular season, the 2nd or 3rd best player, in large part because Lebron was coasting but all the same. In 2017 he was way better. The mvp race was deservedly between Harden and Westbrook but what kind of gets forgotten is that kawhi was closer than people thought near the end of the season in 3rd place. And when he played both, he was the best player on the court which was one of the arguments for him. He had an insane playoffs that year as well and legitimately looked like he could be as good as KD and Curry. Then the injuries happen and he has an amazing 2019 but there is truth to the fact the team was very good as well. But he was the reason they won and in the playoffs, he played better than Harden on average between 16-19 with a 28-8-4-2-1 on 50-40-89 shooting vs Harden&rsquo;s 29-6-7-2-1 on 41-31-87 and, fwiw those are like the very best harden years too so it&rsquo;s not that much cherry picking.</p>

<p>Now to be clear, I&rsquo;d have Harden, the reality is he was the best player on a contender for years and did it every year and also was the better regular season player on average too which does mean something. Even in the tiny range I highlighted, which is only 40% of the decade, Kawhi only played in <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> playoffs. So it&rsquo;s not like I disagree with you. People underrate Harden a lot too. The unfair thing to Harden weirdly was that his regular season performance would have you think he could be a top 15 player of all time and compete with steph and kd but then he clearly wasn&rsquo;t as good in the playoffs so the contrast looked so bad. But he still played well in the playoffs, even despite the percentages. He just wasn&rsquo;t top 15 all time good. Also people hated his style but whatever. So I do have Harden over Kawhi but I do think if we&rsquo;re picking the 4th &ldquo;best&rdquo; player, I&rsquo;d pick uninjured Kawhi to lead my team and feel like people sort of forget how amazing Kawhi was at his best even outside of the raptors year.</p>

      <label for="l6vvvae" class="commentText"><p>Harden was my immediate thought too, but on second thought it really should be Westbrook for 4th best player of the decade.</p>

<p>Westbrook:</p>

<p>-Was a 20+ ppg scorer for the ENTIRE decade</p>

<p>-Unheard of 2016 (edit: meant 2017) MVP triple double season with an insane story and pretty much single-handedly carried that team to the playoffs</p>

<p>-Averaged a triple double for two straight years after that as well</p>

<p>-3 other top-5 seasons in MVP voting, as well as two other top-10s</p>

<p>-Finals appearance, multiple conference finals appearances, tons of playoffs wins</p>

<p>-On a new team, ended the decade with a then-career high in FG% and raised his PPG to near the top of the league</p>

<p>-2 times assists leader, 2 times scoring leader</p>

<p>-2 All Star Game MVPs</p>

      <label for="l6vx498" class="commentText"><p>Sure, but I think one of the biggest factors in this debate should be the player’s longevity for the entirety of the 2010s, so that’s another reason I go Westbrook over Harden.</p>

<p>Harden was still a 6th man during the first two years of the decade, Westbrook was again already putting up 20+ ppg as a starter.</p>

<p>Also, Harden had 4 seasons playing 80+ games compared to Westbrook’s 5 seasons doing so.</p>

Go watch the Heat game plan specifically for Harden in that finals and no one else cause they know KD would get his no matter what. Russ wasn’t a concern in the same way at all.</p>

<p>He was 6th on his team in PPG in the WCF. Outscored by Duncan, Ginobili, Diaw, Parker, and Green. The number one option does not do that and win.</p>

      <label for="l6vnof5" class="commentText"><p>I agree, Harden is certainly right there. People do forget that he was one historically bad shooting night and a hamstring away from beating the most stacked team of all time.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think the 2014 championship was that undeserved, personally. Of course there&rsquo;s a discussion but Duncan and Leonard were both playing very well.</p>

      <label for="l6vphs6" class="commentText"><p>Harden shot terribly that entire series. 29/6/6 with 5 turnovers per game for the series on 41.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub>.<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>88</sub>.5 shooting splits vs 30/5/9 with 4.4 turnovers per game for the regular season on <sup>45</sup>&frasl;<sub>36</sub>.<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>85</sub>.8 shooting splits.  I want to emphasize that Harden shot 24% from the three on 11 attempts per game! Also Harden won game 5 by 4 points despite shooting <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>21</sub>, 0/11 from three, and having 4 assists on 6 turnovers.</p>

<p>I think there is a little more context to that series than just &ldquo;Harden taking the most stacked team of all time to 7 games.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l6wczrx" class="commentText"><p>I’m a big fan of Stanimal but he’s a bit overrated by most. Yes, he won 3 slams, and did it in epic fashion. But Murray won 3 slams with 14 Masters1000 (to Wawrinka’s 1), an ATP Finals (Wawrinka never did this), 2 Olympic Gold medals (Wawrinka has none in singles, 1 in doubles though) and time as the #1 player in the world (Wawrinka peaked at #3). </p>

<p>Wawrinka had a relatively short prime (2013-2017) compared to Murray’s (2008-2017) which is part of the reason his stats are worse, but he also really peaked at best of 5 grand slams. Definition of a big match player, great endurance and nerve management, but in best of 3 matches outside the grand slams he took a lot of losses to randoms and was dominated by other top players.</p>

Murray was pretty good on clay, just the big 3 and especially Nadal kept beating him, and Wawrinka in his prime was just slightly better on clay.</p>

      <label for="l6wdjny" class="commentText"><p>Feel like Harden will be remembered/perceived way better after his career than he was during his prime. As in, people slightly underrated him during his prime because they hated his foul-baiting, but the man was a godly scorer. I think DWade vs Harden at #3 for best shooting guards of all time is a legit argument. </p>

As great as harden was in his prime wade could win when it mattered most. Before bron came to Miami he already won a chip with an old shaq. Harden though is a close ass 4th</p>

LeBron left the East and got hurt so the Raptors path to the Finals was easy as it ever was going to be, then the Warriors would have eaten them alive in the Finals if, idk, KD hadn&rsquo;t blown out an achilles and Klay crumpled to the ground with a torn ACL.</p>

<p>I mean if an asterisk should ever be applied to a Championship, its this one.  (That shot by Kawhi in game 7 was fucking sick tho)</p>

      <label for="l6vql78" class="commentText"><p>I think that the only two answers are Harden and Kawhi.</p>

<p>And it’s a super interesting question because they have such different careers.</p>

<p>While the bias raptors fan in me wants to say Kawhi, I think it has to be harden. Kawhi might have been a “better” player at his best, but Harden really defines the 2010s style more than anyone - with the possible exception of curry.*</p>

<p>I think that Harden’s career has been diminished by the media/narratives. In reality, he’s a transcendentally great player.</p>

<p>A lot of people say that kids in pickup try to emulate curry. But in my experience, harden has had an even more profound impact on the game. Everything down to his posture was imitated by a generation. He pioneered the “double step back” which is somehow not a travel, despite how it looks in real time.</p>

<p>I love Kawhi, and if I were drafting a team guaranteeing health I’d probably choose him. But harden is quintessentially 2010 NBA</p>

<ul>
<li>I say possible exception because curry is a freak of nature who defies all we know about shooting. A lot of people try to be him but literally nobody comes close.</li>

Harden nearly beat a team that KD was the second option on, as the best player on his team. Kawhi has two titles in that decade as the best player and was hailed as the best defensive player for years.</p>

<p>Yes, KD is more talented, that&rsquo;s a different conversation. His playstyle, like Dirk&rsquo;s, is just less effective, which is why the Warriors kept winning without him.</p>

      <label for="l6vyjt4" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s Chris Paul or Harden.</p>

<p>CP3 in the 2010&rsquo;s was 3x All NBA 1st team, 3x All NBA 2nd team, 1x All NBA 3rd team, 6x All NBA Defensive first team, 1x All NBA Defensive 2nd team, 7x All Star.</p>

<p>Harden in the 2010&rsquo;s was 1x MVP, 1x 6MOY, 6x All NBA 1st team, 1x All NBA 3rd team, 9x All Star.</p>

<p>IMO those 2 are interchangeable for number <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>. I think perhaps Harden gets the slight nod (just because a larger portion of his peak was in the 2010&rsquo;s whereas some of Pauls best years were in the late 2000&rsquo;s) and then I have Kawhi/Westbrook after them.</p>

<p>If we&rsquo;re discussing highest peak then it&rsquo;s IMO Kawhi but I think injuries really robbed him of a lot of the accolades one would need to be listed here.</p>

<p>However, while CP3 was also very deserving of MVP, the context around Kobe winning is important to remember. That was the worst statistical year of Kobe&rsquo;s peak but that was also the year that Kobe finally emerged as a leader and anyone watching back then, myself included, can understand why he won it given how well he was getting his team to perform that year. Now, had the NBA given Kobe his actual supposed MVP in 06 then it&rsquo;s very possible that Paul wins in 08 but no one at all back then considered Kobe winning in 08 a wrong decision. It&rsquo;s just something that got brought up much later on when people go back and just look at the stats without understanding the context of why he won it.</p>

      <label for="l6wf4hv" class="commentText"><p>That MVP definitely should not have gone to Kobe, but LeBron was just as deserving as Paul. Had LeBron (1st in BPM, 1st in VORP, 1st in PER, 1st in PPG) won over Paul (1st in WS, WS48, AST, STL) we wouldn’t be re-litigating that MVP decision.</p>

<p>I’m with you that Paul was more deserving than the guy who won, and that it would have been fine if Paul won the award, but it feels weird to say somebody was “robbed” when they were one of two equally viable candidates.</p>

<p>Paul-Harden-Kawhi is a nice litmus test to figure out what somebody values in a basketball player.</p>

That was pretty much the peak of &ldquo;Point God&rdquo; CP3 and he was pretty much undisputedly considered the best PG in the league and a top 3-5 player in the league during that span (at least until 2015 where Steph took over). During that 4 year span Paul made 1st team 3x and 2nd team 1x while Griffin only made 1 second team and 1 third team.</p>

      <label for="l6wbkhg" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think KD plays winning basketball. He&rsquo;s incredibly impressive, of course, but none of the dirty work goes through him and jump shots simply aren&rsquo;t high leverage plays. Same with Dirk, btw, and it was a miracle he won a title too.</p>

<p>Kawhi won two titles in that decade. Harden played maybe the best team in history to a standstill as the highest usage first option. He was also running the offense on TWO of KD&rsquo;s best teams, right? So I don&rsquo;t think KD has any achievement that compares. He never had success without either Harden or Curry, who were much more rugged and impactful in their careers.</p>

<p>In my mind, 5 at best, but that still overlooks two more strong candidates.</p>

<p>And as much as I hate the guy, Draymond running the offense in GSW and anchoring the defense against the best players, including KD, might be more impressive than anything KD has done as well. 4 titles for Draymond as maybe the second most important player on offense and defense? KD at best won as the second most important player in GSW, and maybe his was third most important since they won without him, right?</p>

<p>And then you left out Wade, who won titles in that decade as well. If KD&rsquo;s &lsquo;second option&rsquo; successes count, surely Dwyane Wade&rsquo;s do, also?</p>

<p>KD is a very, very good player when healthy, but the bar is just set incredibly high.</p>

<p>Of course this is talking about on-court achievement rather than ability and potential.</p>

      <label for="l6wonc1" class="commentText"><p>Curry was still better than KD. Wade and KD were both second options, and I&rsquo;d argue Draymond was more important than KD, because his contributions had no overlap with Curry/Klay. Curry and the team literally valued Draymond over KD and have persisted through some pain to keep him around.</p>

<p>And obviously almost that exact same Warriors team won without KD. So it&rsquo;s hard to argue that he was &lsquo;most valuable&rsquo; in retrospect.</p>

<p>Yes, FMVP is a real achievement, but that represents a handful of games and a built-in bias for scoring. Which the Warriors had plenty of, anyway. And the OKC team lost with him as the leader.</p>

<p>If the achievements are so close, shouldn&rsquo;t the tiebreaker be which championship team was weaker around the two stars? Was Bosh better than Draymond? Bosh is underrated, but he was hardly better than Draymond.</p>

<p>KD is clearly better than Wade in talent and height, but this is about achievement and I think it&rsquo;s awful to dismiss the alternatives out of hand.</p>

<p>Kawhi and Harden were always the first options. Draymond was point forward on 4 championship teams. Dwyane Wade was the second option for just as many titles, and more conference finals.</p>

      <label for="l6w2luw" class="commentText"><p>Love Leonard, I&rsquo;d pick him in my top 5 for the 2010s no problem. Especially since he improved so much as both a player and then as an offensive threat. It&rsquo;s scarce to see one of the and maybe the best perimeter defender in the nba improve his offense to such a degree as he did from 2015 to 2017.</p>

KD is a great player but he is just a better Cermelo Anthony for me. If any player had gone toe to toe with these two and come up on top is Kawhi Leonard. Dude is amazing when he plays.</p>

People hating on me for simply stating that their is more to dominance then just being the best shooter. Kawhi is a great 2 way player that KD is not. He has defeated both LeBron and Curry to win championship. Why would you not consider it more dominating than KDs performance, exceptional though it may be. people here counting WCF wins etc, by that metric no one comes close to LeBron in any period of basketball. Would they say he is better than MJ?</p>

<p>Is Bosh getting forgotten here? Third best on a championship team, but arguably those were thin teams and they did very well for a two years stretch there. Him starting out in Toronto and getting a medical condition at the end pushed him into obscurity, when he was a very versatile big fit for the modern era, and obvs successful.</p>

He should also be ranked in the context of WWE characters who are so powerful that they carry the narrative.  Taking out KD and Lebron, there are the three you listed: Leonard, Westbrook, Harden.   Put aside, for a moment, that Leonard actually swing a championship in the Toronto story arc.  The gravity of Leonard’s movements had decade-defining story structure for SAS, Toronto, OKC, IND, and LAC.  whereas, Harden and Westbrook look more like chess pieces in the game controlled by the GMs.</p>

      <label for="l6waya9" class="commentText"><p>If you are counting from the 10-11 season to the 19-20 season, you can&rsquo;t leave out Giannis, as he had 2 MVPs, a ring and FMVP, 1 DPOY, 3 all-NBA, 4 all-defense. Obviously he&rsquo;s not someone you&rsquo;re considering because he didn&rsquo;t really even start to break out until 16-17, but he actually played 4 more games than Kawhi (528 to 524) in that span, and way more minutes.<br>
<a href="https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=compare+statistics+of+kawhi+leonard+and+giannis+antetokounmpo+from+2010-11+to+2019-20+seasons" target="_blank">https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=compare+statistics+of+kawhi+leonard+and+giannis+antetokounmpo+from+2010-11+to+2019-20+seasons</a></p>

<p>Giannis actually surpasses Kawhi on all counting stats except steals (though they are equal in stocks), and I think it would be hard to say Giannis didn&rsquo;t have a higher peak.</p>

<p>While it makes sense to not consider Giannis a 2010s player on the one hand, on the other hand, with the way his 2020s are going, his 2010s stats/accolades may end up being more impressive if you are grading on an arbitrary decade basis. As great as he still is, I don&rsquo;t really see him getting another MVP or championship with all the other talent that is coming up, and the sheer difficulty of constructing and keeping a championship-calibre team together.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like the argument for Jordan in the 80s - no one would say it was his best decade, but could you keep him off the all-time team for that decade? I certainly couldn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>

      <label for="l6wonkx" class="commentText"><p>I think Kahwi barely has the edge. And after that I want to say Russ but it’s probably Harden, then Russ, the CP3. It’s really hard to say someone who’s been an MVP candidate at the same time as another MVP but has two chips and a dpoy is the worse player. But I also do subscribe to the take that Kawhi is the worst superstar, maybe ever. His all time stats are similar to career role players.</p>

      <label for="l6vntlg" class="commentText"><p>Healthy Kawhi is a top tier all time great imo. His playoff stats in his prime compare favorably to any wing, and he is better defensively than almost all of them even after his defense declined from its peak. Just checked his b-ball reference and grabbed some games from 2016 to 2021 playoffs. In that stretch, 28.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>.<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>.3 on 51/39/89 efficiency. Considering his defense, this stacks up well with anyone. And the eye test confirms. He doesn’t stat chase in the regular season, probably the pop influence there. </p>

<p> That said, I think Kawhi is at least equal with Durant and Curry. I’d place them all in the same tier honestly. Curry in the regular season, probably lean Kawhi then Durant in the playoffs. </p>

<p>LeBron is the best of the era, then you have that trio of all time greats. Pretty cool that all 4 will be in Olympics </p>

      <label for="l6vqj7x" class="commentText"><p>You cannot just cherry pick stats to fit your narrative. Steph is one of the greatest offensive engines of all time. He is the greatest shooter of all time, the greatest off-ball player of all time and the second best pg of all time. 4 rings, 2 mvps (1 unanimous, never done in history), 1 fmvp (deserved 2), the best player of a dynasty, three consecutive seasons with at least 67 wins, (67-15, 73-9, 67-15). And btw, great offense beats great defense everytime. Steph&rsquo;s offense &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Kawhi&rsquo;s defense. There are a whole bunch of defensive anchors you would pick for your team before picking Kawhi. On the other hand, Ty Lue self admittedly doubled Steph with KD and Klay on the floor. That tells you everything you need to know. Steph can get you a 50 piece victory in a game 7 that too in the opponent&rsquo;s court.</p>

      <label for="l6vr7lz" class="commentText"><p>Those are not cherry picked stats. That’s a 6 year span of him playing in the playoffs at his peak. And peak Kawhi in the playoffs is more effective than peak Curry and Durant. People underrate Kawhi because he sort of lays back in the regular season, not uncommon for pop coaches players. But in the playoffs the only wings in his class are the Mount Rushmore guys. Seriously, check the stats for him in the playoffs and compare to Curry and KD. Then consider the defense gap. Kawhi was better in the playoffs.</p>

<p>If we are talking accolades and legacy yeah I agree. But if you need to win a best of 7, I want LeBron, then Kawhi, then Curry/Durant.</p>

<p>Lmao. From 2015 to 2019 Steph never lost a playoff series in the tougher western conference. Went to the finals all 5 times. Steph won before KD, with KD and after KD. And somehow Kawhi is the better playoff performer lol.</p>

<p>It’s controversial due to the accolade differential, but there’s an argument for Curry at the 4. People seem to forget that in Kawhi’s prime, he was as good as LeBron and KD. Whereas Curry (with all due respect) was never considered the best in the league and was always slightly below those two.</p>

<p>And I’m not hating, I love Curry. I’d still take Curry because of how much he gives to an offense. I’m just making it clear that Kawhi <em>is absolutely</em> in that tier with those 3. He was in the big 3 in those years, not Curry. It’s revisionist to say otherwise and Kawhi doesn’t get the respect he deserves for it</p>

it didn&rsquo;t even exist as a concept even. Lebron, Curry, Durant were considered top 3 even if Harden was killing, but nobody called them &ldquo;big 3&rdquo; lol
and he was never in Lebron&rsquo;s tier. stop lying. you literally made up that shit.
Before the 2019 title nobody sane would even consider taking Kawhi before any of those 3.</p>

<p>and after 2019 KD left, the Warriors went through reload, Lebron missed the playoffs. after that some other players entered the mix. in that time they were some arguing for Kawhi, and then he choked against the Nuggets (conveniently forgotten), and was basically never fully healthy afterwards.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll even take Kyrie over Westbrook in 2010&rsquo;s. media awards don&rsquo;t mean a thing when I&rsquo;d rather have Kyrie over Westbrook 10 times out of 10 in the playoffs</p>

<p>nah i&rsquo;ve been a Russ critic since 2010. the same flaws he had then were still the same flaws he had his whole career</p>
