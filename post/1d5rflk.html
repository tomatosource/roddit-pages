    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>There are 28 teams sitting at home right now, wondering what they did wrong. This post will attempt to offer my two cents and my rudimentary <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/two-common-challenges-physicians-face-patients-and-drugs" target="_blank">prescriptions</a> for them, but feel free to contribute your own. What does each team need to do to get on that main stage next year? What should their top priority be?</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve already examined the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1d47d6l/prescriptions_for_all_the_playoff_losers_western/" target="_blank">west</a> so now it&rsquo;s time to glance east-ward.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(2 seed) New York Knicks: 50-32 record, lost in round two</strong></p>

<p><em>the symptoms</em></p>

<p>The Knicks had a good season: with 50 wins and an SRS (schedule adjusted power ranking) of 6th in the NBA. They got their swagger back and their fan base excited. However, the NBA season is a long and brutal campaign. General Tom Thibodeau eventually ran out of troops, with injuries to several starters and key contributors.</p>

<p><em>the treatment</em></p>

<p>The Knicks ran out of fresh bodies, but at full strength they have a deep squad at their disposal. They have at least seven players you&rsquo;d trust in the playoffs, and it&rsquo;d be eight if Bojan Bogdanovic can return to form after a rocky season. The bigger issue is that two of those players are free agents &ndash; OG Anunoby ($19M player option) and Isaiah Hartenstein (UFA). To me, the Knicks <strong>should make every effort to re-sign both</strong>. Anunoby is a no-brainer, but Hartenstein helps their team quite a bit as well. Not only is a competent starting-level player in a vacuum, but he&rsquo;s also a high IQ player and ball mover that fits their style. Teams tried to trap Jalen Brunson in the playoffs, so it&rsquo;s imperative that he can dish it out to smart players who will make the right read from there.</p>

<p>If they <em>do</em> re-sign everyone, the financial math gets tricky. It&rsquo;s hard to pay eight players in eight-figures (as in over $10M a year). Consolidation would be ideal. If you could somehow package players and picks into 2-for-1s or 3-for-1s for a legitimate All-Star (like Villanova&rsquo;s own Mikal Bridges) then you could perhaps take a leap into title contention.</p>

<p>In the absence of that, tough choices and salary shedding may be needed. If the team re-signs Anunoby and Hartenstein, then the odd man out may be Julius Randle. It&rsquo;s not like the Knicks got much better after Randle got hurt (only 21-15 in the regular season, 7-6 in the playoffs), but it&rsquo;s debatable whether he&rsquo;s ideal for a Brunson-centric offense. After his breakout &ldquo;Most Improved Player&rdquo; trophy, he&rsquo;s regressed back down to 31%, 34%, and 31% from three the following years. Ideally, you&rsquo;d build the team around Brunson with purer 3+D players. If they can agree on a reasonable contract for Hartenstein, then I&rsquo;d be inclined to shift Randle and his salary (<span class="math inline">\(29M + \)</span>31 player option) elsewhere. If Hartenstein&rsquo;s market explodes past reason, then it makes more sense to keep Randle and see how the team gels next year.</p>

<p><strong>(3 seed) Milwaukee Bucks: 49-33 record, lost in round one</strong></p>

<p><em>the symptoms</em></p>

<p>The coaching turmoil with Adrian Griffin and Doc Rivers took over the headlines, but the Milwaukee Bucks&rsquo; roster has some serious issues as well. Even when they won the title, it always felt like they were searching to find that elusive 5th starter. Interestingly, two of those former candidates (Donte DiVincenzo, Grayson Allen) had breakout seasons with other clubs. Is it a matter of poor timing? Or is there something toxic in the water? Either way, the debate rages on: how can the team fill the gaps around their stars?</p>

<p><em>the treatment</em></p>

<p>Sure, the Damian Lillard trade didn&rsquo;t go according to plan, but as long as Lillard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Khris Middleton are all healthy and happy, this team will always have championship upside. The key is still maximizing the talent around them.</p>

<p>With $184M committed on the books, the best bet is <strong>internal development</strong>. A youth movement on the margins (similar to what I suggested for the Denver Nuggets). The Bucks need to be patient in the regular season and use that time to try and develop their younger guards/wings. MarJon Beauchamp has some 3+D potential. Andre Jackson Jr. is a big-time athlete and energy player who can maybe be a glue guy for them (in the Gary Payton II mold). Give them consistent minutes &ndash; give them spot starts here and there. Give them the opportunity to grow.</p>

<p>What the Bucks <em>shouldn&rsquo;t</em> do is what Doc Rivers tends to do, which is over-play and over-rely on older veterans instead. Patrick Beverley, Jae Crowder, Pat Connaughton&hellip; these guys are all fine as minutes fillers and band-aids, but they don&rsquo;t have the same type of upside in the tank. The Bucks need to develop, develop, develop, if they want to extend their title window.</p>

<p><strong>(4 seed) Cleveland Cavaliers: 48-34 record, lost in round one</strong></p>

<p><em>the symptoms</em></p>

<p>The Cavs ranked # 2 overall in the entire NBA in SRS last season, but took a step back this year (largely due to injuries) and fell to # 15. The surgery to fix it came quickly &ndash; first with the firing of J.B. Bickerstaff, and now potentially with a serious shakeup to the roster to severe the duplication between their two small guards and their two non-shooting bigs.</p>

<p><em>the treatment</em></p>

<p>Personally, I didn&rsquo;t see the need for a massive shakeup here. Sure, the team doesn&rsquo;t fit together like a glove, but it was still a rare collection of young talent. Their core four (Donovan Mitchell, Darius Garland, Evan Mobley, Jarrett Allen) are all between the ages of 23 and 27. If you gave them a few more years together, maybe it could have worked. Maybe Mobley could have extended his range. Maybe they would have broken through.</p>

<p>Alas, there was a ticking clock here in the form of Donovan Mitchell&rsquo;s impending free agency (next summer). Mitchell has the leverage here &ndash; and plenty of suitors (especially his home state teams in New York). And if Mitchell wanted them to make moves before he signs on the dotted line, then I suppose you have to do that. He&rsquo;s an outsider who showed up and impressed enough to be seen as your savior. Most franchises will err on the side of Stilgar over Chani in that circumstance.</p>

<p>However, it&rsquo;ll be important for Cleveland moving forward to be a <strong>strong hand of the king</strong> and not a cuckhold. They can&rsquo;t make short-term moves just to keep Mitchell happy on a day-to-day basis. The Cavs had made a few desperate trades originally (like trading for Shaq and Ben Wallace) in order to keep a young LeBron James, but that didn&rsquo;t prevent him for leaving for Miami. The Blazers handed the keys to Damian Lillard and a contract to his cousin Keljin Blevins, but that didn&rsquo;t stop him from demanding a trade. So if the Cavs crown Mitchell and say: &ldquo;we want to build around you,&rdquo; they need to emphasize the &ldquo;WE&rdquo; in that statement, as in all the subsequent decisions should be theirs.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the Cavs, it shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to re-build around Mitchell. They don&rsquo;t need to hire an unqualified coach if Mitchell approves of someone like Knicks&rsquo; assistant Johnnie Bryant (who worked as an assistant with Mitchell in Utah). They don&rsquo;t need to trade Darius Garland for pennies on the dollar either; he&rsquo;s a young star under contract, so he should yield a good return. The trick will be finding a bigger 3+D guard or wing who can cover for Mitchell&rsquo;s limited size and guard the tougher matchup every night.</p>

<p><strong>(5 seed) Orlando Magic: 47-35 record, lost in round one</strong></p>

<p><em>the symptoms</em></p>

<p>The young Magic had a feel-good season and a top flight defense, but an actual NBA title feels far away. Their offensive rating ranked # 22 in the NBA, extending their streak of a bottom 10 offense dating back to the days of Stan Van Gundy&rsquo;s departure. In particular, shooting is a clear problem; in fact, they finished dead last in three pointers made.</p>

<p><em>the treatment</em></p>

<p>Because Orlando&rsquo;s a young team, there may be an inclination to be patient and let them grow organically. Jalen Suggs took a step up in terms of his efficiency. Paolo Banchero (33.9% from 3) and Franz Wagner (28.1% from 3) may do the same. Should we step back and let the kids grow up?</p>

<p>Personally, I&rsquo;d be more aggressive than that. Their offense has a looong way to go. Consider this: they averaged 113.4 points per 100 possessions. If they improved by 3 points per 100, they still wouldn&rsquo;t be in the top half of the NBA.</p>

<p>The Magic need to <strong>shoot for a shooter</strong>. I&rsquo;d even aim high/expensive with a player like Trae Young. For all his flaws, his career OBPM (offensive box plus/minus) indicates that he has a +5.2 impact per 100 possessions on offense, which is exactly the type of vault up that this team needs. Would Young hurt the defense? Sure. Would he <em>ruin</em> the defense? I wouldn&rsquo;t go that far. Remember, good defensive teams can cover for a small/poor defender to some degree. Both Allen Iverson&rsquo;s 76ers and Isaiah Thomas&rsquo; Boston Celtics had a top 5 defense despite a tiny guard in the lineup.</p>

<p>If the Magic want to compromise and add a rotational shooter instead, then players like Anfernee Simons or Luke Kennard may be reasonable alternatives. Paolo Banchero is a gifted passer, but it&rsquo;ll be tough for him to maximize his own efficiency unless he has proper spacing like that.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(6 seed) Indiana Pacers: 47-35 record, lost in round three</strong></p>

<p><em>the symptoms</em></p>

<p>The Pacers had the opposite issue as Orlando. Their offense was top notch (#2 overall) but their defense lagged to 24th. There are certainly concerns that they may have overachieved in the playoffs due to some easy sledding and injury-riddled opponents. A pessimist may look to the fate of the young Atlanta Hawks, who had a Cinderella run to the Conference Finals in 2021 only to stagnate and stumble out of the playoffs entirely. Progress isn&rsquo;t guaranteed, so the Pacers need to continue to take steps to improve.</p>

<p><em>the treatment</em></p>

<p>While I recommended adding pieces for Orlando, I&rsquo;d caution Indiana from doing the same. They have some ascending talent in reserve. They had a strong playoff run (easy road or not), and did that without any contributions from Bennedict Mathurin or last year&rsquo;s lottery pick Jarace Walker. Ben Sheppard and Isaiah Jackson should improve as well. If coach Rick Carlisle can work them in without disrupting the chemistry, the Pacers may be able to repeat their playoff success.</p>

<p>The Pacers <strong>should have confidence in their young core</strong> in more ways than one. That is: they shouldn&rsquo;t bend over backwards to re-sign Pascal Siakam. There&rsquo;s going to be some internal pressure to do that after they acquired him in midseason, but the team needs to be prudent here. Just because you got lucky with a pretty girl doesn&rsquo;t mean you need to propose on the second date. The practical matter is that Siakam is already 30 years old, and it&rsquo;s debatable how well his skill set will age over time. Paying him for 4+ years is risky. Giving Siakam a huge salary (even a near max) is fine, but the Pacers should try their best to shorten or front-load that contract.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(7 seed) Philadelphia 76ers: 47-35 record, lost in round one</strong></p>

<p><em>the symptoms</em></p>

<p>Where do you even start? A one-time super team has slowly but surely been dismantled, highlighted by the James Harden trade in midseason. Tyrese Maxey emerged as a star in his wake, but the rest of the roster may be running out of gas. Joel Embiid only played 39 games in the regular season. He&rsquo;s 30 years now old, and several other contributors are over 30 as well (Tobias Harris, Kyle Lowry, Nic Batum, Buddy Hield).</p>

<hr>

<p><em>the treatment</em></p>

<p>The James Harden drama made life difficult this season. Trying to maneuver a trade package in the middle of the season is like trying to cook a meal on a moving train.</p>

<p>Still, I&rsquo;m surprised that GM Daryl Morey prioritized expiring contracts in the deal. They had a superstar who was healthy (at the time) and playing MVP-level basketball. It&rsquo;s an odd decision to kick the can down the road and waste one of his prime years. You don&rsquo;t know how many of these chances you&rsquo;re going to have left.</p>

<p>Well, what&rsquo;s done is done, so it&rsquo;s time for the Sixers to take advantage of all their cap space they hoarded. They need to <strong>shop for a star.</strong> Some of the names bandied about &ndash; like LeBron James and Paul George &ndash; feel unrealistic to me. I don&rsquo;t see either one going to Philadelphia. The market isn&rsquo;t very desirable, but I also doubt they want to fall in line for a fragile Embiid or a heavy-handed GM like Morey. A reunion with Jimmy Butler may be more realistic.</p>

<p>The Sixers need to come away with <em>someone</em> though, even if it&rsquo;s a lesser star like Zach LaVine. Having  transcendent talent like Embiid will always give you a chance to win the title. The team owes it to him and their fan base to take a legitimate swing at the plate.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(8 seed) Miami Heat: 46-36 record, lost in round one</strong></p>

<p><em>the symptoms</em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s fair to wonder if Joel Embiid can no longer carry Philadelphia by himself, and it&rsquo;s fair to wonder that about Jimmy Butler in Miami as well. Butler is turning 35 years old in September, and he hasn&rsquo;t cracked 70 games played in the regular season since 2016-2017. The surprising playoff success may be masking the mediocrity of the entire team itself; in the past two seasons they&rsquo;ve ranked # 19 and # 18 in total SRS respectively. The advanced stats suggest that their finish this year (losing 4-1 in round one) was more indicative of their talent level than the previous Finals runs.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>the treatment</em></p>

<p>The Heat have started to become tethered to Jimmy Butler &ndash; both from a personality perspective and from a basketball perspective. Offensively, his ability to attack, draw FTs, and distribute has become their identity. Unfortunately, this doesn&rsquo;t look like a sustainable formula anymore. It may be time to <strong>distance themselves from Butler</strong> as the core piece. He&rsquo;s still under contract &ndash; for <span class="math inline">\(48M next year and a player option for \)</span>52M the year after &ndash; but the team shouldn&rsquo;t entertain any extension beyond that. It&rsquo;s unlikely Butler will be worth anywhere close to a max number by age <sup>36</sup>&frasl;<sub>37</sub>.</p>

<p>If the team can acquire a superstar (and shift Butler to Option 1B) then they should, like they tried to do with Damian Lillard last season. But in the absence of that game changer, I&rsquo;d be more inclined to trade Butler while he still has value and build a younger squad around Bam Adebayo instead. Going with a soft rebuild may require a step back &ndash; maybe into the play-in range &ndash; but the Heat should trust their staff and their development system. After all, Adebayo is only 26, giving them plenty of time to build.</p>
