<p>It was the same with Michael Jordan for nearly his entire career until near the end, when he finally got paid in a record-breaking deal. MJ had signed an 8-year <span class="math inline">\(25 million deal. In 1996 - 1996! - he was being paid \)</span>3.8 million a year. Danny Manning was making $6.8 million.</p>

      <label for="lkje4cy" class="commentText"><p>To his credit, MJ never asked to renegotiate, even when other teammates were making more money than he was. He stuck to the contract he signed, and you have to respect that.</p>

<p>But he also remembered that the team could have given him a raise and they didn&rsquo;t, so he took them to the cleaners on those last two deals:</p>

<p>1996-97*: 1 year, $30.1 million</p>

<p>1997-98*: 1 year, $33.1 million</p>

<p>This was unheard of in the NBA in the 90&rsquo;s. In 1997, Patrick Ewing was the next highest paid player at $20M.</p>

<p>EDIT: corrected the years I had wrong.</p>

      <label for="lkjgnca" class="commentText"><p>Very good point. He was probably making more money just from non-shoe endorsements than his NBA contract by the end of that 7-year deal. Let alone Nike. So he could afford to not renegotiate his true value until the contract was over.</p>

      <label for="lkjmb6c" class="commentText"><p>The Air Jordan sold 450,000 pairs in its first month on the shelves in 1985 with MJ getting a 25% royalty. By the time he won his first ring in 1991 he was already loaded as fuck, and obviously that brought on even more shoe sales.</p>

<p>I think MJ’s mentality was that championships sell more products, so making sure that Bulls core was able to stay together and add good role players was probably worth more overall money than if he’d squeezed a few million more out of ownership but had a worse team around him. There was no better ad for Air Jordan’s than Mike simply wearing them in playoffs and Finals games on national TV.</p>

<p>MJ is probably the only player with the luxury though. For context’s sake - Lebron’s massive lifetime Nike contract is worth about <span class="math inline">\(1 billion. Jordan’s Nike contract pays him in the \)</span>200-$300 million range per year, so he makes in 3-4 years what Lebron gets in a lifetime. That may sound like an insane amount of money to us, but Lebron seems to want to get himself to Bill Gates status so he can create some real black power and ownership, so he’s gotta stack cash from every source including his salary to achieve that for his folks.</p>

      <label for="lkjf4hm" class="commentText"><p>You’re correct but just one year off, those salaries were for 96-97 and 97-98, his final two seasons with the Bulls.</p>

<p>In 95-96 he was on the last year of his initial contract and made $3.8 million.</p>

<p>This contemporary Chicago Tribune article goes into it a bit, before MJ got paid:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/1996/01/21/vastly-underpaid-for-years-michael-jordan-now-wants-his-market-value-but-can-anyone-count-that-high/" target="_blank">https://www.chicagotribune.com/1996/01/21/vastly-underpaid-for-years-michael-jordan-now-wants-his-market-value-but-can-anyone-count-that-high/</a></p>

<p>This bit is prophetic from at least one agent but some still underestimated it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I don’t know how you can be fair to Michael within the limits of an NBA franchise,” said Indiana Pacers General Manager Donnie Walsh. “I don’t know how you can pay him his fair value.”</p>

<p>One agent suggested Jordan would ask for as much as <span class="math inline">\(100 million over three years. Educated guesses have Jordan settling for an average annual salary of \)</span>20 million.</p>

<p>It would appear Jordan, one month shy of his 33rd birthday, has substantial leverage. “When you look back at where Michael has been as a player and what his salary has been, you realize he’s in a position to demand pretty much whatever he wants,” said Bulls teammate Scottie Pippen. “Whether or not this organization will honor it remains to be seen.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pip’s got his own gripe at the end there haha.</p>
