      <label for="lkjaf07" class="commentText"><p>The truly big guns all are. LeBron has been underpaid an astronomical amount.</p>

<p>It was the same with Michael Jordan for nearly his entire career until near the end, when he finally got paid in a record-breaking deal. MJ had signed an 8-year <span class="math inline">\(25 million deal. In 1996 - 1996! - he was being paid \)</span>3.8 million a year. Danny Manning was making $6.8 million.</p>

      <label for="lkje4cy" class="commentText"><p>To his credit, MJ never asked to renegotiate, even when other teammates were making more money than he was. He stuck to the contract he signed, and you have to respect that.</p>

<p>But he also remembered that the team could have given him a raise and they didn&rsquo;t, so he took them to the cleaners on those last two deals:</p>

<p>1996-97*: 1 year, $30.1 million</p>

<p>1997-98*: 1 year, $33.1 million</p>

<p>This was unheard of in the NBA in the 90&rsquo;s. In 1997, Patrick Ewing was the next highest paid player at $20M.</p>

      <label for="lkjgnca" class="commentText"><p>Very good point. He was probably making more money just from non-shoe endorsements than his NBA contract by the end of that 7-year deal. Let alone Nike. So he could afford to not renegotiate his true value until the contract was over.</p>

      <label for="lkjmb6c" class="commentText"><p>The Air Jordan sold 450,000 pairs in its first month on the shelves in 1985 with MJ getting a 25% royalty. By the time he won his first ring in 1991 he was already loaded as fuck, and obviously that brought on even more shoe sales.</p>

<p>I think MJ’s mentality was that championships sell more products, so making sure that Bulls core was able to stay together and add good role players was probably worth more overall money than if he’d squeezed a few million more out of ownership but had a worse team around him. There was no better ad for Air Jordan’s than Mike simply wearing them in playoffs and Finals games on national TV.</p>

<p>MJ is probably the only player with the luxury though. For context’s sake - Lebron’s massive lifetime Nike contract is worth about <span class="math inline">\(1 billion. Jordan’s Nike contract pays him in the \)</span>200-$300 million range per year, so he makes in 3-4 years what Lebron gets in a lifetime. That may sound like an insane amount of money to us, but Lebron seems to want to get himself to Bill Gates status so he can create some real black power and ownership, so he’s gotta stack cash from every source including his salary to achieve that for his folks.</p>

Look at Junior Bridgeman - he made around 4 mil total in his career pre-tax, invested in Wendy’s franchises, now he’s worth $600 mil. There’s billionaires like Shad Khan who was just a middle class guy that bought into the auto parts shop he worked for (now he owns the Jaguars).</p>

<p>Someone with Lebron’s capital can make hundreds of ground-floor investments at once and you only need a few of them to hit to end up richer than you were before.

Helping eradicate polio in India (a nation that holds 17% of the world&rsquo;s population) was crazy.</p>

      <label for="lkjf4hm" class="commentText"><p>You’re correct but just one year off, those salaries were for 96-97 and 97-98, his final two seasons with the Bulls.</p>

<p>In 95-96 he was on the last year of his initial contract and made $3.8 million.</p>

<p>This contemporary Chicago Tribune article goes into it a bit, before MJ got paid:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/1996/01/21/vastly-underpaid-for-years-michael-jordan-now-wants-his-market-value-but-can-anyone-count-that-high/" target="_blank">https://www.chicagotribune.com/1996/01/21/vastly-underpaid-for-years-michael-jordan-now-wants-his-market-value-but-can-anyone-count-that-high/</a></p>

<p>This bit is prophetic from at least one agent but some still underestimated it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I don’t know how you can be fair to Michael within the limits of an NBA franchise,” said Indiana Pacers General Manager Donnie Walsh. “I don’t know how you can pay him his fair value.”</p>

<p>One agent suggested Jordan would ask for as much as <span class="math inline">\(100 million over three years. Educated guesses have Jordan settling for an average annual salary of \)</span>20 million.</p>

<p>It would appear Jordan, one month shy of his 33rd birthday, has substantial leverage. “When you look back at where Michael has been as a player and what his salary has been, you realize he’s in a position to demand pretty much whatever he wants,” said Bulls teammate Scottie Pippen. “Whether or not this organization will honor it remains to be seen.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pip’s got his own gripe at the end there haha.</p>

      <label for="lkjon52" class="commentText"><p>Had this discussion on a thread here a couple days ago - that franchise value is the reason salaries are negotiated on revenue and not operating income. Franchise value matters more to owners than OI, in fact you’ll find a lot of OI just ends up reinvested rather than pocketed and tends to fluctuate a lot year-to-year.</p>

<p>Like you can make <span class="math inline">\(80 million in OI and have it taxed to shit, or you can reinvest it then use the franchise value to leverage a \)</span>250 million low interest loan (current NBA debt limit), store that money into assets, pay down the loan debt with business income (“business expense”), and have your magical accountants save you millions in taxes. Billionaires aren’t looking to pocket money.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don’t necessary disagree with the rest of your comment but, this doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me. The reason player salaries (AKA the salary cap) are based on revenue, and not <em>income</em> is because income is net of expenses <em>like</em> player salaries. Income will also vary from team to team, whereas revenue is a league-wide figure. </p>

      <label for="lkk4ox8" class="commentText"><p>If you run a small business, and paying employees 50% of revenue + covering other business expenses leaves you with no profit, then you would probably want to address your profit margin immediately. Since “other business expenses” are mostly hard costs that stay the same, the most obvious analysis is that you’re either overstaffed or paying people too much, because as the business owner and admin you still have to put something in your own pocket.</p>

<p>That changes entirely when your business is a multi-billion sports franchise, no one cares about <span class="math inline">\(60 million in profit when they just added \)</span>6 billion to their net worth over a decade’s time, you’d have to make <span class="math inline">\(60 million a year for 100 years to reach \)</span>6 billion.</p>

<p>What do you mean by this?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>But this is a two way street. Steph is able to draw viewers because the networks invest in the NBA media rights and manage the broadcasts and media operations. They make money <em>together</em>, Steph isn’t operating in a vacuum and generating money on his own.</p>

<p>2nd pt obv its a two way street . Who said he is generating money on his own bt lets say Steph bron etc plays in euroleague nobody will care abt NBA the players give more to the league than other way round</p>

Profit wise, NBA teams are billionaires play toys. They want to blow money on stadiums, statues, parties, and parades rather than reporting profits and paying taxes. Steph brought in the cold hard cash to fuel the party.</p>

      <label for="lkkhydb" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not about revenue but the valuation. If the Warriors want to sell a stake of the team, they can price it at the valuation price instead of the price they bought it at. A few years ago, there was an investment company that bought 5% of the team. They had to pay the rates at its valuation which was around 5.5B at the time.</p>
