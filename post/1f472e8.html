<p>It was the same with Michael Jordan for nearly his entire career until near the end, when he finally got paid in a record-breaking deal. MJ had signed an 8-year <span class="math inline">\(25 million deal. In 1996 - 1996! - he was being paid \)</span>3.8 million a year. Danny Manning was making $6.8 million.</p>

      <label for="lkje4cy" class="commentText"><p>To his credit, MJ never asked to renegotiate, even when other teammates were making more money than he was. He stuck to the contract he signed, and you have to respect that.</p>

<p>But he also remembered that the team could have given him a raise and they didn&rsquo;t, so he took them to the cleaners on those last two deals:</p>

<p>1996-97*: 1 year, $30.1 million</p>

<p>1997-98*: 1 year, $33.1 million</p>

<p>This was unheard of in the NBA in the 90&rsquo;s. In 1997, Patrick Ewing was the next highest paid player at $20M.</p>

      <label for="lkjgnca" class="commentText"><p>Very good point. He was probably making more money just from non-shoe endorsements than his NBA contract by the end of that 7-year deal. Let alone Nike. So he could afford to not renegotiate his true value until the contract was over.</p>

      <label for="lkjmb6c" class="commentText"><p>The Air Jordan sold 450,000 pairs in its first month on the shelves in 1985 with MJ getting a 25% royalty. By the time he won his first ring in 1991 he was already loaded as fuck, and obviously that brought on even more shoe sales.</p>

<p>I think MJ’s mentality was that championships sell more products, so making sure that Bulls core was able to stay together and add good role players was probably worth more overall money than if he’d squeezed a few million more out of ownership but had a worse team around him. There was no better ad for Air Jordan’s than Mike simply wearing them in playoffs and Finals games on national TV.</p>

<p>MJ is probably the only player with the luxury though. For context’s sake - Lebron’s massive lifetime Nike contract is worth about <span class="math inline">\(1 billion. Jordan’s Nike contract pays him in the \)</span>200-$300 million range per year, so he makes in 3-4 years what Lebron gets in a lifetime. That may sound like an insane amount of money to us, but Lebron seems to want to get himself to Bill Gates status so he can create some real black power and ownership, so he’s gotta stack cash from every source including his salary to achieve that for his folks.</p>

<p>According to google there&rsquo;s a 37 in 38 chance the casino nets a cool <span class="math inline">\(3.2 billion on that bet but a 1 in 38 chance they have to pay out \)</span>112 billion.  I can&rsquo;t imagine any casino could stay in business after that kind of a hit and I doubt they have that kind of insurance, seems like it wouldn&rsquo;t be worth the risk.</p>

<p>Someone with Lebron’s capital can make hundreds of ground-floor investments at once and you only need a few of them to hit to end up richer than you were before.

      <label for="lkjf4hm" class="commentText"><p>You’re correct but just one year off, those salaries were for 96-97 and 97-98, his final two seasons with the Bulls.</p>

<p>In 95-96 he was on the last year of his initial contract and made $3.8 million.</p>

<p>This contemporary Chicago Tribune article goes into it a bit, before MJ got paid:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/1996/01/21/vastly-underpaid-for-years-michael-jordan-now-wants-his-market-value-but-can-anyone-count-that-high/" target="_blank">https://www.chicagotribune.com/1996/01/21/vastly-underpaid-for-years-michael-jordan-now-wants-his-market-value-but-can-anyone-count-that-high/</a></p>

<p>This bit is prophetic from at least one agent but some still underestimated it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I don’t know how you can be fair to Michael within the limits of an NBA franchise,” said Indiana Pacers General Manager Donnie Walsh. “I don’t know how you can pay him his fair value.”</p>

<p>One agent suggested Jordan would ask for as much as <span class="math inline">\(100 million over three years. Educated guesses have Jordan settling for an average annual salary of \)</span>20 million.</p>

<p>It would appear Jordan, one month shy of his 33rd birthday, has substantial leverage. “When you look back at where Michael has been as a player and what his salary has been, you realize he’s in a position to demand pretty much whatever he wants,” said Bulls teammate Scottie Pippen. “Whether or not this organization will honor it remains to be seen.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pip’s got his own gripe at the end there haha.</p>

<p>My brain is broken when it comes to NBA contracts nowadays. The inflation of the mid 2010s just never really sunk. Growing up in the late 90s/early 2000s has made me always think 20/year is the max. Now I seem to think everyone is insanely overpaid. Jakob Pöltl is at 19.5 a year. How is he a max player?</p>

That&rsquo;s why it was legal for them to pay Jordan alone ~25% more than the teams entire salary cap.  Amusingly the Bulls titles were all played with both stars under contracts that would be impermissible now.</p>

<p>If there wasn&rsquo;t a salary cap then the sport would plausibly be less popular and LeBron would make even less. American sports are all about parity. If you take away parity and only have 2 super teams the size of the pool shrinks.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s going to be a contributing factor, but the primary driver of franchise value is <em>league popularity</em></p>

<p>Michael Jordan <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=5003048" target="_blank">paid $275M</a> for his stake in the Bobcats, then sold the stake 11 years later for <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/37863644/sources-michael-jordan-finalizing-charlotte-hornets-sale" target="_blank"><strong>$3 billion</strong></a>.

      <label for="lkjon52" class="commentText"><p>Had this discussion on a thread here a couple days ago - that franchise value is the reason salaries are negotiated on revenue and not operating income. Franchise value matters more to owners than OI, in fact you’ll find a lot of OI just ends up reinvested rather than pocketed and tends to fluctuate a lot year-to-year.</p>

<p>Like you can make <span class="math inline">\(80 million in OI and have it taxed to shit, or you can reinvest it then use the franchise value to leverage a \)</span>250 million low interest loan (current NBA debt limit), store that money into assets, pay down the loan debt with business income (“business expense”), and have your magical accountants save you millions in taxes. Billionaires aren’t looking to pocket money.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don’t necessary disagree with the rest of your comment but, this doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me. The reason player salaries (AKA the salary cap) are based on revenue, and not <em>income</em> is because income is net of expenses <em>like</em> player salaries. Income will also vary from team to team, whereas revenue is a league-wide figure. </p>

      <label for="lkk4ox8" class="commentText"><p>If you run a small business, and paying employees 50% of revenue + covering other business expenses leaves you with no profit, then you would probably want to address your profit margin immediately. Since “other business expenses” are mostly hard costs that stay the same, the most obvious analysis is that you’re either overstaffed or paying people too much, because as the business owner and admin you still have to put something in your own pocket.</p>

<p>That changes entirely when your business is a multi-billion sports franchise, no one cares about <span class="math inline">\(60 million in profit when they just added \)</span>6 billion to their net worth over a decade’s time, you’d have to make <span class="math inline">\(60 million a year for 100 years to reach \)</span>6 billion.</p>

<p>Estimates of their annual revenue. Currently lead the league in revenue. They already made cash bank off Steph.</p>

      <label for="lkjysrb" class="commentText"><p>You see the explosive growth of their revenue with the rise of Steph. The Steph lead dynasty brought GSW billions of extra revenue. Profit wise, NBA teams are billionaires play toys. They want to blow money on stadiums, statues, parties, and parades rather than reporting profits and paying taxes. Steph brought in the cold hard cash to fuel the party.</p>

      <label for="lklroo9" class="commentText"><p>Gotta mention Steph is liquid with those paychecks. If you account for inflation and potential earnings from investing those paychecks in full, just as the team is an investment then you start to see some different numbers. Even after taxes, Steph could be over a billion dollars if he invested everything he could since day one in fairly safe investments from his GSW paychecks alone by the time this contract is over.</p>

<p>Then yes. These team valuations have a massive forward P/E multiple added to it&rsquo;s book value and what I would imagine is also a very significant &ldquo;status&rdquo; factor added.</p>

<p>While he has certainly added a ton of value especially for GSW, the bulk of that growth is really the league as a whole (and GSW had other good players as well of course). The NBA was growing massively well before him. His attention would have simply been diverted to someone else if he didn&rsquo;t exist. But that&rsquo;s not me saying he&rsquo;s not deserving of this, he absolutely is.</p>

<p>What do you mean by this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p> Even if you see in context of league top players dont get paid as much as they generate tv revenue. Steph is responsible for some of biggest tv draws in last decade</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this is a two way street. Steph is able to draw viewers because the networks invest in the NBA media rights and manage the broadcasts and media operations. They make money <em>together</em>, Steph isn’t operating in a vacuum and generating money on his own.</p>

<p>2nd pt obv its a two way street . Who said he is generating money on his own bt lets say Steph bron etc plays in euroleague nobody will care abt NBA the players give more to the league than other way round</p>

<p>Plenty of players in every sport are still playing at a high level at an age most people would be retired 20-30 years ago.</p>

<p>Tennis has Djokovic who just won gold, Soccer has some players, Tom Brady was one of the best until his early 40s etc etc</p>

<p>but we are spoiled by how absolutely elite these nba players are and are gonna hold players to a different standard going forward and be disappointed if they aren’t still absolutely elite 16-20 years in the league</p>

Steph was arguably at his best and most complete all around players in his mid-early 30s.</p>

<p>This will be more common, for sure, going forward even if we dont have more players still in the top 10 at 36+</p>

      <label for="lkm9vxl" class="commentText"><p>There was a huge push in sports science and tech from the transition in the late 90s to mid 2000s and it made huge differences to how players recover, train and perform. It&rsquo;s like night and day. The gap is so massive even sports psychologists play a huge role in helping players not burn out.</p>

<p>Fans need to always remember that every salary we see is based on a collectively bargained agreement between the league and the players union that splits basketball-related revenue <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub>. Which means that it&rsquo;s a zero sum game, every dollar that the players don&rsquo;t make goes to the billionaires who own the teams.</p>

      <label for="lkpcmxh" class="commentText"><p>oh yeah I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s nuts cause the players don&rsquo;t deserve a larger chunk of the revenue, I&rsquo;m more surprised how far the NBA has come in the past 10 years in terms of revenue..</p>

<p>also it is a zero sum game, but rather than the owners and players taking such a large portion of the revenue it would be nice to pass some relief onto the fans.. at least I&rsquo;ve noticed ticket, merch, stadium food and drink prices have been increasing much higher than inflation for the Raptors</p>
