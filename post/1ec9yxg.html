      <label for="leyjfsu" class="commentText"><p>Everything KD says makes total sense logically. I appreciate how forthright KD tends to be a lot. You don&rsquo;t get candidness without pretentiousness from professional athletes often.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think KD left solely because of Dray, I think it was confirmation that it wasn&rsquo;t a long term destination for him, more confirmation than he&rsquo;d already had. That was the final nail in the coffin. But I don&rsquo;t think it was the singular reason.</p>

<p>The Dubs won the chip in &lsquo;22 and their legacy is stamped. Draymond&rsquo;s is stamped. But what&rsquo;s also become clear, is that what the Warriors publicize re: their culture and their image and what&rsquo;s truly going on behind the scenes are not in alignment and haven&rsquo;t been for years. Now that&rsquo;s more public than ever and people are realizing and recognizing this thing has been a shit show for a little bit behind the scenes. Honestly it really crystalizes for me just how good Steph really is as a player more than anything.</p>

<p>Kerr&rsquo;s leadership can be questioned but you can&rsquo;t question the coaching. You don&rsquo;t win at the level the Dubs have without excellent coaching. But the leadership one can say has been lacking. From Kerr on down. Can say it finally caught up with them last year.</p>

Then blames how management handled it in another interview. Then has other interviews where he’s finally saying how he feels and isn’t gas lighting the media anymore. KD might be honest, but it takes a few interviews to see how he really feels about topics.</p>

      <label for="leytivv" class="commentText"><p>People are going to run with this because Draymond has proven to be a problematic teammate. But KD has never owned up to what he contributed to this moment, nor has he ever owned up the fact that he has bailed on three teams now.</p>

<p>KD snapped at Draymond for pushing the ball when they had already won a ring, had a 73 win season, and beat the Thunder with an offense built around Draymond pushing the ball up the court. Was Draymond wrong for blowing up the way he did? Yes. Did Draymond have a valid reason to be pissed that he was catching shit like that? Yes.</p>

<p>The way you are brushing off the 22’ ring is crazy because that ring solidifies what that core of the Warriors was capable of. Something that KD has never been able to do with the different machinations of teams he has created.</p>

<p>To me, people never hold KD accountable for letting that moment become an excuse to distance himself from the team. People also never mention the fact that Kerr said KD started isolating himself from the team after the first season. So all I see is a convenient scapegoat that KD found in Draymond.</p>

<p>I get it, KD is a fun player and we all respect him. But we definitely baby him in this situation.</p>

<p>He already knew he was leaving and the whole team had to tippy toe around him the entire season. He can switch his story as many times as he goes on a different podcast, but the writing was on the wall.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>His team ended up making the finals that season and would have won if not for KD and Klay getting injured.</p></li>

<li><p>In the playoffs Durant played the best basketball of his life up to that point.</p></li>

<li><p>It was known that Durant was leaving the team before Draymond’s blowup, it’s a small part of the blowup happening in the first place (the main part being Draymond’s anger issues).</p></li>

<p>The team seemed to have pulled themselves together until the wheels fell off health-wise.</p>

<p>Like I had plenty of heated arguments even with the best friends but never throw a punch. If someone does it, that&rsquo;s end of friendship. Who the f wants to be in a toxic relationship.</p>

<p>But yeah it&rsquo;s isnane how little consequences has Draymond seen over his actions&hellip; no doubt that made it only worse over the course of time.</p>
