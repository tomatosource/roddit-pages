      <label for="leyjfsu" class="commentText"><p>Everything KD says makes total sense logically. I appreciate how forthright KD tends to be a lot. You don&rsquo;t get candidness without pretentiousness from professional athletes often.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think KD left solely because of Dray, I think it was confirmation that it wasn&rsquo;t a long term destination for him, more confirmation than he&rsquo;d already had. That was the final nail in the coffin. But I don&rsquo;t think it was the singular reason.</p>

<p>The Dubs won the chip in &lsquo;22 and their legacy is stamped. Draymond&rsquo;s is stamped. But what&rsquo;s also become clear, is that what the Warriors publicize re: their culture and their image and what&rsquo;s truly going on behind the scenes are not in alignment and haven&rsquo;t been for years. Now that&rsquo;s more public than ever and people are realizing and recognizing this thing has been a shit show for a little bit behind the scenes. Honestly it really crystalizes for me just how good Steph really is as a player more than anything.</p>

<p>Kerr&rsquo;s leadership can be questioned but you can&rsquo;t question the coaching. You don&rsquo;t win at the level the Dubs have without excellent coaching. But the leadership one can say has been lacking. From Kerr on down. Can say it finally caught up with them last year.</p>

Everyone wants to &ldquo;WIN&rdquo; right? If you don&rsquo;t understand the culture of competition, then don&rsquo;t act like you know. DO you play basketball at least competitvely?</p>

      <label for="leyyeny" class="commentText"><p>Bro times change, our dads/grandfathers came from a time of loyalty just like older generation of NBA players who would stick to one team and try to win there instead of leaving for a super team. Similar to us we realized all these teams/corps really don’t gaf bout us and will let you go in a heartbeat, so why not go somewhere else for a higher pay raise/chance for a promotion. That’s exactly what KD did, he gave OKC his all, they didn’t resign Harden over a business decision, so KD looked out for himself and went to get a chip. I understand your sentiment but honestly I think it’s been long enough where we can look past him going to GS now and just appreciate his HoF career for what it is.</p>

It wasn&rsquo;t really the priority. But he&rsquo;s absolutely mellowed out more in recent years. He did have a prickly relationship with media for a long time but less so these days.</p>

Initially they try not to say anything and it makes sense why, it could make things worse and you’d have to handle it internally first. After that he’s been somewhat consistent, Dray got him fucked up but management made it so much worse by choosing to brush it aside and let it grow throughout the year. This interview was years ago. He’d only probably share more cause he’s more comfortable around podcast people he knows. And I don’t think he’d go deeper to shit on Draymond, probably doesn’t want to further any hurt feelings.</p>

That opens the offense for other guys 10x more than an iso scorer type. The iso guy may get the same points, but not with the same offensive flow for teammates that Steph provides.</p>

<p>He’s such a uniquely great player that I wonder sometimes if his teammates became overrated due to the great team success. I sometimes swing the other way and think they’re underrated though.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not disagreeing with you but why is this necessarily a bad thing? To me, it makes no difference. You&rsquo;re either good (and lucky) enough to win or you&rsquo;re not. Do we really think most dynasties in any professional sport are kumbaya all the time? Do you not remember half the stuff that Phil Jackson said PUBLICLY about Kobe or Shaq? Toxicity and ultra competitiveness go hand in hand very very often. Not everyone is the Villanova Knicks or has to be. Not every story has to be a fairy tale about the power of friendship.</p>

      <label for="leytivv" class="commentText"><p>People are going to run with this because Draymond has proven to be a problematic teammate. But KD has never owned up to what he contributed to this moment, nor has he ever owned up the fact that he has bailed on three teams now.</p>

<p>KD snapped at Draymond for pushing the ball when they had already won a ring, had a 73 win season, and beat the Thunder with an offense built around Draymond pushing the ball up the court. Was Draymond wrong for blowing up the way he did? Yes. Did Draymond have a valid reason to be pissed that he was catching shit like that? Yes.</p>

<p>The way you are brushing off the 22’ ring is crazy because that ring solidifies what that core of the Warriors was capable of. Something that KD has never been able to do with the different machinations of teams he has created.</p>

<p>To me, people never hold KD accountable for letting that moment become an excuse to distance himself from the team. People also never mention the fact that Kerr said KD started isolating himself from the team after the first season. So all I see is a convenient scapegoat that KD found in Draymond.</p>

<p>I get it, KD is a fun player and we all respect him. But we definitely baby him in this situation.</p>

      <label for="leyvgyo" class="commentText"><p>Not dismissing that ring&hellip;that ring stamped them if there was any doubt, as one of the greatest basketball and sports dynasties. Their core 3 and Kerr as amongst the absolute greatest within those categories in basketball and sports. No doubt about that. That ring was and is legendary in so many ways.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also not absolving KD from all responsibility here. He&rsquo;s culpable. I&rsquo;m talking about the bigger overall picture, not solely specific to this one situation. This is one of several over more than five years that have, in my estimation, not always been handled well by obviously the players but especially so Kerr as coach, Lacob, Myers/Dunleavy&hellip;and yes, Steph included. It&rsquo;s one fire after another after another and from the outside looking in, it looks like the Warriors have been putting so many fires out over the years that they&rsquo;re running out of extinguishing powder.</p>

<p>KD is sensitive, Draymond is headstrong, the Warriors core was established when he got there, it was always gonna be a different dynamic with him, he was never gonna get the level of validation he sought chasing the rings he did with the Warriors&hellip;he&rsquo;s culpable. They didn&rsquo;t mesh culturally and as teammates. But Draymond as the leader on the player side does have responsibility in making KD feel comfortable and making it mesh and he didn&rsquo;t do that.</p>

      <label for="leyxio3" class="commentText"><p>KD said pass me the fucking ball. Klay was pissed, guys were pissed. KD was like pass the ball heading to the bench. Draymond took it personal and aired him out.</p>

<p>Guys cuss, shit happens, we know KD will cuss on the court, but Draymond himself said he said things he&rsquo;d &ldquo;never reveal publicly&rdquo;  ie. he went the personal route, he made KD feel like an outsider explicitly, and their relationship hasn&rsquo;t recovered. They still would&rsquo;ve won the chip in &lsquo;19 because of the talent on the roster being too much for teams to deal with. But that was the nail in the coffin for the KD Warriors era.</p>

<p>KD has no reason to lie at this point, and he&rsquo;s been pretty consistent on his portrayal of what happened and Draymond to his credit, has actually taken responsibility for going too far. The bigger thing for me is what KD touched on, and that&rsquo;s the Warriors have had a lot of &ldquo;issues&rdquo; going back to 2018 and their way of addressing those issues has been to essentially not address them unless absolutely forced to. Those issues in the background have increasingly bubbled to the surface and last season seemed to have caught up to them. Now Klay is gone.</p>

But he was stern&hellip;but as they both have said, cussing between players isn&rsquo;t something out of the ordinary and they didn&rsquo;t take it personally&hellip;.so it was a line crosser for Draymond to do so. KD is coming from the position of someone who had stern convos on court with Dray and it never went left like that.</p>

Kd knows draymond knows what he’s doing in all game situations, yelling at him saying “at the end of the game, give me the ball” was outta place. But it doesn’t excuse draymond overreaction. Ironically enough, had kd kept running the floor draymond idea of doing a pitch back could have worked</p>

<p>Front office and Kerr have to get their arm twisted until it damn near pops off to use any disciplinary action or even talk about anything he&rsquo;s ever done in a negative light. Noone is held accountable there until recently because he&rsquo;s not as good.</p>

<p>KD is soft and emotional. He probably doesn&rsquo;t want to offend his friend, but why tf else would he leave? He hate winning easy championships that badly while having a perfect environment for his skills etc?</p>

<p>It was absolutely because of draymond and the fact the team did barely anything about it and let the inmates rum the asylum.</p>

      <label for="leyy320" class="commentText"><p>Its less of the incident and more of the response. If we&rsquo;re good friends and we get into an argument and you call me a bitch or whatever we can move past that. If you tell me that i&rsquo;m a bitch and nobody in our friend group wants/likes me around infront of everyone, and nobody says anything or comes out to say &ldquo;nah that&rsquo;s not true&rdquo; then that&rsquo;s a whole different story.</p>

<p>The argument isn&rsquo;t the full reason because arguments happen, its the reaction of others.</p>

KD vocalized that he didn&rsquo;t like how the entire thing was handled by the organization which led him to detract from the group. Dray might have initiated the whole thing but KD left because of the organization&rsquo;s response.</p>

<p>He already knew he was leaving and the whole team had to tippy toe around him the entire season. He can switch his story as many times as he goes on a different podcast, but the writing was on the wall.</p>

      <label for="lez314w" class="commentText"><p>If KD never joins the Warriors, Draymond might not have even been a Warrior for long and there is no dynasty.</p>

<p>LeBron and Co beat a 73 win team, coming back from 3-1 in the finals. The same 73 win team were down 3-1 to KD’s Thunder who could’ve added more pieces to get over that hill the following year; I mean Sam Presti had proven to be a more than savvy GM.</p>

<p>Warriors likely only finish their run with the lone 2015 championship without KD. And their dynasty never exists. Draymond might even get traded as a net negative for all the nut busting temper tantrums that literally cost the Warriors a game in the finals without his championship culture bullshit to offset. There’s no defending Draymond’s immature shenanigans except for the championships. Draymond owes his career to KD otherwise he has a Ben Simmons late type career</p>

<p>Like I had plenty of heated arguments even with the best friends but never throw a punch. If someone does it, that&rsquo;s end of friendship. Who the f wants to be in a toxic relationship.</p>

<p>But yeah it&rsquo;s isnane how little consequences has Draymond seen over his actions&hellip; no doubt that made it only worse over the course of time.</p>

The Wizards dont play motion offense which makes less effective, he was a perfect match for the Warriors and if it wasnt for that punch he probably would have developed more under that system.</p>

<li><p>His team ended up making the finals that season and would have won if not for KD and Klay getting injured.</p></li>

<li><p>In the playoffs Durant played the best basketball of his life up to that point.</p></li>

<li><p>It was known that Durant was leaving the team before Draymond’s blowup, it’s a small part of the blowup happening in the first place (the main part being Draymond’s anger issues).</p></li>

<p>Dude is responsible for costing them several championships if you think about it, between the Cavs series suspension and scaring KD off.</p>

<p>I just&hellip; I don&rsquo;t get it. How can anyone respect a man who&rsquo;s go to strategy on the court is to yell and scream, punch and kick people in the nuts, stomp on their chest, try to murder his own teammate because the guy said something mean (boo hoo).. play dirty in general.</p>

Draymond blew up because KD was being wishy washy about an extension and the core was starting to realize KD wanted to walk. He was already starting to alienate himself. You can even see KD mouth “that’s why I’m leaving” toward dray during the incident. I’m sure dray had already been giving him shit about breaking up the dynasty. KD wanted to win again, more on his own, so he left. Now that he’s clearly not winning another, he’s trying to fault Dray… I, for one, am not falling for it</p>
