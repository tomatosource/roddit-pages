      <label for="leyjfsu" class="commentText"><p>Everything KD says makes total sense logically. I appreciate how forthright KD tends to be a lot. You don&rsquo;t get candidness without pretentiousness from professional athletes often.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think KD left solely because of Dray, I think it was confirmation that it wasn&rsquo;t a long term destination for him, more confirmation than he&rsquo;d already had. That was the final nail in the coffin. But I don&rsquo;t think it was the singular reason.</p>

<p>The Dubs won the chip in &lsquo;22 and their legacy is stamped. Draymond&rsquo;s is stamped. But what&rsquo;s also become clear, is that what the Warriors publicize re: their culture and their image and what&rsquo;s truly going on behind the scenes are not in alignment and haven&rsquo;t been for years. Now that&rsquo;s more public than ever and people are realizing and recognizing this thing has been a shit show for a little bit behind the scenes. Honestly it really crystalizes for me just how good Steph really is as a player more than anything.</p>

<p>Kerr&rsquo;s leadership can be questioned but you can&rsquo;t question the coaching. You don&rsquo;t win at the level the Dubs have without excellent coaching. But the leadership one can say has been lacking. From Kerr on down. Can say it finally caught up with them last year.</p>

      <label for="leyv4wh" class="commentText"><p>Not really. Go back and look into his interviews after the incident. First , he brushes it off and accuses the media of stirring things up. Then blames how management handled it in another interview. Then has other interviews where he’s finally saying how he feels and isn’t gas lighting the media anymore. KD might be honest, but it takes a few interviews to see how he really feels about topics.</p>

It think considering what he was going through with the achilles, then the pandemic, then Kyrie&rsquo;s issues, having to address and re-address Draymond wasn&rsquo;t really something he was looking to do. It wasn&rsquo;t really the priority. But he&rsquo;s absolutely mellowed out more in recent years. He did have a prickly relationship with media for a long time but less so these days.</p>

      <label for="leyzgk0" class="commentText"><p>That’s kinda true for most public figures. Initially they try not to say anything and it makes sense why, it could make things worse and you’d have to handle it internally first. After that he’s been somewhat consistent, Dray got him fucked up but management made it so much worse by choosing to brush it aside and let it grow throughout the year. This interview was years ago. He’d only probably share more cause he’s more comfortable around podcast people he knows. And I don’t think he’d go deeper to shit on Draymond, probably doesn’t want to further any hurt feelings.</p>

That opens the offense for other guys 10x more than an iso scorer type. The iso guy may get the same points, but not with the same offensive flow for teammates that Steph provides.</p>

<p>He’s such a uniquely great player that I wonder sometimes if his teammates became overrated due to the great team success. I sometimes swing the other way and think they’re underrated though.</p>

      <label for="lezcogx" class="commentText"><p>I think the leadership has been perfectly fine.  It&rsquo;s easy to say that it&rsquo;s lacking when you don&rsquo;t put Kerr&rsquo;s career into context.  As a player and as a coach he has seen and won with excellence at pretty much the highest level in NBA history.  Through all of that he has probably seen egos and inter-personal conflict that would make most people&rsquo;s head spin.  So when he&rsquo;s coaching a team that has had massive amounts of success and some young dudes who are either on their first contract or extension start flexing their egos despite the already established hall of fame legacies that are in front of them I do not fault a guy like Steve Kerr for not giving a shit.  If anything he failed as a coach last year for giving Klay too long of a leash, and for everyone who wants to cry &ldquo;boo-hoo&rdquo; about Draymond, you&rsquo;re talking about a guy who stuck it to Michael Jordan and played with Dennis Rodman, but his leadership should never be questioned given that his standard for excellence is backed by experience and results and is lightyears beyond what most people could hope to achieve in their careers, let alone in the NBA.</p>

<p>I don’t think there’s anything Kerr could have done to prevent Poole from getting clocked, and I think Kerr’s response to the situation was textbook “how to navigate a bad situation”. Draymond is just an asshole, but he’s an asshole you have to stand by if you want to win basketball games</p>

      <label for="lezrg0b" class="commentText"><p>Yeah. Like I don’t think anybody was happy that Draymond clocked Poole but they also gave Poole a huge extension and a tremendous amount of minutes and he managed to be so bad as both a player and a teammate that they shipped him out for an expiring contract the second they were allowed to do so; so that should tell you everything you need to know about how well liked Jordan Poole was despite getting literally everything a player in his position could hope to get.</p>

      <label for="lezn73c" class="commentText"><p>I think the interesting part of their success is what the hell do you make of Draymond as a member of a team. Like, not just do fans like the guy, I get that lots of people don&rsquo;t like him, which is fine. But it seems to me that they have really struggled to manage his emotions and outbursts, in a way that&rsquo;s been really detrimental, despite him being an absolute anchor on the court. Personality analysis really drives me nuts in part because it&rsquo;s so hard for fans to really get a clear picture of, but a dude getting suspended in the finals and being a catalyst for KD leaving is pretty clear.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think KD left solely because of Dray, I think it was confirmation that it wasn&rsquo;t a long term destination for him, more confirmation than he&rsquo;d already had. That was the final nail in the coffin. But I don&rsquo;t think it was the singular reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with this, even without this KD had signals that he wasn&rsquo;t satisfied fully by the rings, that he felt he should&rsquo;ve been appreciated more for winning. Which, further makes me question the Warriors and Dray because how much of it is this conflict, how much of it was the org/coaching staff/locker room not doing more, yada yada.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Honestly it really crystalizes for me just how good Steph really is as a player more than anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is the right takeaway from the Warriors overall. Despite it all Steph took the wreckage of the KD situation, and the turbulence of being Dray&rsquo;s teammate to another ring, and put them in a position to survive his injury if things had broken different in 2019. Guy&rsquo;s had a pantheon prime to me.</p>

Supposedly he checked out a bit with the suns and maybe if the thunder if I recall.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not disagreeing with you but why is this necessarily a bad thing? To me, it makes no difference. You&rsquo;re either good (and lucky) enough to win or you&rsquo;re not. Do we really think most dynasties in any professional sport are kumbaya all the time? Do you not remember half the stuff that Phil Jackson said PUBLICLY about Kobe or Shaq? Toxicity and ultra competitiveness go hand in hand very very often. Not everyone is the Villanova Knicks or has to be. Not every story has to be a fairy tale about the power of friendship.</p>

      <label for="leytivv" class="commentText"><p>People are going to run with this because Draymond has proven to be a problematic teammate. But KD has never owned up to what he contributed to this moment, nor has he ever owned up the fact that he has bailed on three teams now.</p>

<p>KD snapped at Draymond for pushing the ball when they had already won a ring, had a 73 win season, and beat the Thunder with an offense built around Draymond pushing the ball up the court. Was Draymond wrong for blowing up the way he did? Yes. Did Draymond have a valid reason to be pissed that he was catching shit like that? Yes.</p>

<p>The way you are brushing off the 22’ ring is crazy because that ring solidifies what that core of the Warriors was capable of. Something that KD has never been able to do with the different machinations of teams he has created.</p>

<p>To me, people never hold KD accountable for letting that moment become an excuse to distance himself from the team. People also never mention the fact that Kerr said KD started isolating himself from the team after the first season. So all I see is a convenient scapegoat that KD found in Draymond.</p>

<p>I get it, KD is a fun player and we all respect him. But we definitely baby him in this situation.</p>

      <label for="lezeubs" class="commentText"><p>From all accounts KD doesn’t really hang out with anybody. He stays to himself in general, so him “distancing” himself from the team was probably just him doing what he does anyway once he’s acclimated and no longer having to put on the camaraderie face necessary when you’re starting something new with strangers.</p>

<p>Also, seeing as that was pretty much the only time in KDs career I remember him having a spat with a teammate whereas Draymond is literally always doing it, it makes sense people think Draymond was just being a dickhead. He got upset because he felt KD was going to leave and blew up about it. Just like he blew up when Poole told him the team was prioritizing him over Draymond.</p>

      <label for="leyvgyo" class="commentText"><p>Not dismissing that ring&hellip;that ring stamped them if there was any doubt, as one of the greatest basketball and sports dynasties. Their core 3 and Kerr as amongst the absolute greatest within those categories in basketball and sports. No doubt about that. That ring was and is legendary in so many ways.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also not absolving KD from all responsibility here. He&rsquo;s culpable. I&rsquo;m talking about the bigger overall picture, not solely specific to this one situation. This is one of several over more than five years that have, in my estimation, not always been handled well by obviously the players but especially so Kerr as coach, Lacob, Myers/Dunleavy&hellip;and yes, Steph included. It&rsquo;s one fire after another after another and from the outside looking in, it looks like the Warriors have been putting so many fires out over the years that they&rsquo;re running out of extinguishing powder.</p>

<p>KD is sensitive, Draymond is headstrong, the Warriors core was established when he got there, it was always gonna be a different dynamic with him, he was never gonna get the level of validation he sought chasing the rings he did with the Warriors&hellip;he&rsquo;s culpable. They didn&rsquo;t mesh culturally and as teammates. But Draymond as the leader on the player side does have responsibility in making KD feel comfortable and making it mesh and he didn&rsquo;t do that.</p>

      <label for="leyxio3" class="commentText"><p>KD said pass me the fucking ball. Klay was pissed, guys were pissed. KD was like pass the ball heading to the bench. Draymond took it personal and aired him out.</p>

<p>Guys cuss, shit happens, we know KD will cuss on the court, but Draymond himself said he said things he&rsquo;d &ldquo;never reveal publicly&rdquo;  ie. he went the personal route, he made KD feel like an outsider explicitly, and their relationship hasn&rsquo;t recovered. They still would&rsquo;ve won the chip in &lsquo;19 because of the talent on the roster being too much for teams to deal with. But that was the nail in the coffin for the KD Warriors era.</p>

<p>KD has no reason to lie at this point, and he&rsquo;s been pretty consistent on his portrayal of what happened and Draymond to his credit, has actually taken responsibility for going too far. The bigger thing for me is what KD touched on, and that&rsquo;s the Warriors have had a lot of &ldquo;issues&rdquo; going back to 2018 and their way of addressing those issues has been to essentially not address them unless absolutely forced to. Those issues in the background have increasingly bubbled to the surface and last season seemed to have caught up to them. Now Klay is gone.</p>

      <label for="lezzuqe" class="commentText"><p>What would you call it then? Draymond gets disproportionately pissed off when little stuff happens in the game and then he&rsquo;ll totally lose control and blow up. And at times it has cost his team games, series, and at least one title. Whatever you want to call it, he&rsquo;s not emotionally stable as a player.</p>

<p>Front office and Kerr have to get their arm twisted until it damn near pops off to use any disciplinary action or even talk about anything he&rsquo;s ever done in a negative light. Noone is held accountable there until recently because he&rsquo;s not as good.</p>

<p>KD is soft and emotional. He probably doesn&rsquo;t want to offend his friend, but why tf else would he leave? He hate winning easy championships that badly while having a perfect environment for his skills etc?</p>

<p>It was absolutely because of draymond and the fact the team did barely anything about it and let the inmates rum the asylum.</p>

      <label for="leyucfa" class="commentText"><p>Well also it made a lot of sense because getting into verbal disagreement is one thing, but getting sucker punched is a deal-breaker. Which is the same for any other working enviornment(maybe outside of military)</p>

<p>Like I had plenty of heated arguments even with the best friends but never throw a punch. If someone does it, that&rsquo;s end of friendship. Who the f wants to be in a toxic relationship.</p>

<p>But yeah it&rsquo;s isnane how little consequences has Draymond seen over his actions&hellip; no doubt that made it only worse over the course of time.</p>

<li><p>Confirmed the departure of their 2-time Finals MVP (who he begged to join in a parking lot in the first place) because he was mad at KD being annoyed that Draymond made a terrible basketball play</p></li>

<p>all of us who watched that fucking finals knew he wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten suspended if lebron didn&rsquo;t lobby the fuck out of the league for that suspension. woulda been 4-1 and lebron couldn&rsquo;t abide that.</p>

They traded Poole AFTER he shot 34% in the play offs including 27% in his last 4 games and was rated one of the worst defenders in the league for that entire season. The writing was on the wall and they got rid of a mistake. Dude was literally one of the most clowned on player that season and anyone who watched the warriors can tell you how awful he is.</p>

The Wizards dont play motion offense which makes less effective, he was a perfect match for the Warriors and if it wasnt for that punch he probably would have developed more under that system.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>His team ended up making the finals that season and would have won if not for KD and Klay getting injured.</p></li>

<li><p>In the playoffs Durant played the best basketball of his life up to that point.</p></li>

<li><p>It was known that Durant was leaving the team before Draymond’s blowup, it’s a small part of the blowup happening in the first place (the main part being Draymond’s anger issues).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The team seemed to have pulled themselves together until the wheels fell off health-wise.</p>

The next year it was soooooo frustrating to watch Poole drive as fast as he can down court with no real plan, then lose control and give a turnover.  It felt like that happened 20 times a game, but now without the magic shooting he had in the 22 playoffs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to talk shit about him, because he was definitely a huge part of 22 but by the time 23 was done, I think most Warriors fans were done with him.  For his sake, I hope he can get his shit together and play like he did in 22.</p>

<p>He ruined things with KD, he ruined things with Jordan Poole, he gets suspended and thrown out of games for his crazy shit on the court, and not once has Kerr or Steph gone to him and said “if you want to be on this team that can’t happen again” and you know they haven’t because it kept happening</p>

      <label for="leywo8r" class="commentText"><p>Warriors sweeping things under the rug sounds all too familiar with the whole Poole incident. Steph is the only good thing about that organization and Dray is the reason Steph doesn’t have at least two more rings. Sad how this dynasty ended.</p>

Draymond blew up because KD was being wishy washy about an extension and the core was starting to realize KD wanted to walk. He was already starting to alienate himself. You can even see KD mouth “that’s why I’m out” toward dray during the incident. I’m sure dray had already been giving him shit about breaking up the dynasty. KD wanted to win again, more on his own, so he left. Now that he’s clearly not winning another, he’s trying to fault Dray… I, for one, am not falling for it</p>
