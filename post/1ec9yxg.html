</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s not the FO or Curry&rsquo;s fault that they have to babysit a fucking baby with an insane temper tantrum. It&rsquo;s the same reason Draymond got ZERO punishment for assaulting a young player in practice. What kind of organization lets that happen? Well maybe the Warriors organization is that incompetent but 90% of the blames goes to the fact that this was Draymond, the most unhinged player in the NBA who once threatened to kill Steve Kerr and also broke a college kid&rsquo;s jaw for no reason. Any other player it would have been easy to punish. But not with Green.</p>

<p>I can also give you reasons why Draymond lashed out at KD. That wasn&rsquo;t just a one time frustration with him fumbling the ball at the end of the game when he should have passed to KD. You can see his body language when he doesn&rsquo;t have the ball and the increased playmaking duty that KD desired in the Warriors offense. Green feels useless without the ball because he <em>is</em>, and that reached its breaking point in that Clippers game. KD also threatened Draymond&rsquo;s contract size the same way Poole threatened his, it&rsquo;s extremely unlike Draymond gets 25 million a year on top of the exorbitant luxury tax if KD received his birds right contract extension. Trading it for DLo&rsquo;s contract is what allowed Green to get that much money.</p>

<p>But people talk about him like he’s some all time great.</p>

<p>He always would’ve had a good career, but any other team he wouldn’t win DPOY, a bunch of championships, and as soon as he started declining physically he would have looked awful without guys like Steph or Klay to pass to.</p>

      <label for="lf1rsjh" class="commentText"><p>Timofey Mozgov is also like 1 of 3 guys to have a 20 20 game in an nba finals. Not saying draymond is at that level but it doesn&rsquo;t mean as much cus he didn&rsquo;t win. Draymond has been very very fortunate to be where he is, I&rsquo;m not sure he would be looked at as nearly as good of a defender if he was on another team. He&rsquo;s played with a lot of very good very smart defenders his whole career and has had elite wing defenders as well along with a great defensive system that plays perfecfly to his strengths. He&rsquo;s an excellent help defender and can cover for guys in spurts but if u put him on one guy too long he can suffer defensively, I remember Aldridge was absolutely killing him anytime he got switched onto him cus he&rsquo;d just back him down and shoot over him, luckily for draymond there really weren&rsquo;t many other guys in his prime who could do that. He&rsquo;d also suffer a lot more offensively without the 2 greatest shooters of all time and an offense that caters to his strengths, almost no other team&rsquo;s letting draymond handle the ball even close to as much as he does</p>

      <label for="lf1x2c2" class="commentText"><p>I always roll my eyes when people act like kd is a team cancer and Steph is some great leader. I think they’re closer to each other in that aspect than people think, they both are like neutrals in the locker room who just do everything right themselves and lead by example and expect the other players to follow that. Which looks like great leadership when everything is going good. But neither will actually address an actual problem in the locker room, or get all rah rah in someone’s face. Steph has just had way more situations where everything was going well and has always had draymond to be the vocal “leader” when they’re not.</p>

      <label for="lf2dvcl" class="commentText"><p>I think Draymond was speaking what the team was thinking. That’s why they don’t blame him, because deep down others felt the same way.</p>

<p>You can kinda see that because even KD here is like “let’s all talk about it, see how everyone feels”, because he knows it’s the elephant in the room that needs to be addressed at some point.</p>

<p>The bigger problem was not that it got brought up, it was that it was never addressed</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s such a thing as journalistic integrity. Any reporter worth their salt will do this. Go to the Athletic, or, yes, even ESPN.</p>

      <label for="leyjfsu" class="commentText"><p>Everything KD says makes total sense logically. I appreciate how forthright KD tends to be a lot. You don&rsquo;t get candidness without pretentiousness from professional athletes often.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think KD left solely because of Dray, I think it was confirmation that it wasn&rsquo;t a long term destination for him, more confirmation than he&rsquo;d already had. That was the final nail in the coffin. But I don&rsquo;t think it was the singular reason.</p>

<p>The Dubs won the chip in &lsquo;22 and their legacy is stamped. Draymond&rsquo;s is stamped. But what&rsquo;s also become clear, is that what the Warriors publicize re: their culture and their image and what&rsquo;s truly going on behind the scenes are not in alignment and haven&rsquo;t been for years. Now that&rsquo;s more public than ever and people are realizing and recognizing this thing has been a shit show for a little bit behind the scenes. Honestly it really crystalizes for me just how good Steph really is as a player more than anything.</p>

<p>Kerr&rsquo;s leadership can be questioned but you can&rsquo;t question the coaching. You don&rsquo;t win at the level the Dubs have without excellent coaching. But the leadership one can say has been lacking. From Kerr on down. Can say it finally caught up with them last year.</p>

      <label for="leyzgk0" class="commentText"><p>That’s kinda true for most public figures. Initially they try not to say anything and it makes sense why, it could make things worse and you’d have to handle it internally first. After that he’s been somewhat consistent, Dray got him fucked up but management made it so much worse by choosing to brush it aside and let it grow throughout the year. This interview was years ago. He’d only probably share more cause he’s more comfortable around podcast people he knows. And I don’t think he’d go deeper to shit on Draymond, probably doesn’t want to further any hurt feelings.</p>

      <label for="lf0udck" class="commentText"><p>Yes&hellip;totally agree on all points. Although this KD rift developed with they still winning. They did have some ups and downs after the 66 win season though with injuries/roles but they still were winning. They were just so good it didn&rsquo;t matter much until they had too many injuries to overcome eventually in &lsquo;19. Think whatever drama they did have wasn&rsquo;t something that ultimately stopped them from winning when it came down to it on the floor.</p>

      <label for="leywscr" class="commentText"><p>Steph can drop 30 a night without needing the ball which no other star does, and he commands more attention than guys who need the ball on top of that. That opens the offense for other guys 10x more than an iso scorer type. The iso guy may get the same points, but not with the same offensive flow for teammates that Steph provides.</p>

<p>He’s such a uniquely great player that I wonder sometimes if his teammates became overrated due to the great team success. I sometimes swing the other way and think they’re underrated though. I have no clue.</p>

Dray knew where to get the ball to the perfect spot for curry and Klay, an was the one guy that could push the tempo and get the offense easy looks. Klay while not Steph has his own gravity as well, without another shooter teams likely could focus more on Steph but with Klay now you have two off ball threats you absolutely cannot leave open for a second</p>

      <label for="lezn73c" class="commentText"><p>I think the interesting part of their success is what the hell do you make of Draymond as a member of a team. Like, not just do fans like the guy, I get that lots of people don&rsquo;t like him, which is fine. But it seems to me that they have really struggled to manage his emotions and outbursts, in a way that&rsquo;s been really detrimental, despite him being an absolute anchor on the court. Personality analysis really drives me nuts in part because it&rsquo;s so hard for fans to really get a clear picture of, but a dude getting suspended in the finals and being a catalyst for KD leaving is pretty clear.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think KD left solely because of Dray, I think it was confirmation that it wasn&rsquo;t a long term destination for him, more confirmation than he&rsquo;d already had. That was the final nail in the coffin. But I don&rsquo;t think it was the singular reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with this, even without this KD had signals that he wasn&rsquo;t satisfied fully by the rings, that he felt he should&rsquo;ve been appreciated more for winning. Which, further makes me question the Warriors and Dray because how much of it is this conflict, how much of it was the org/coaching staff/locker room not doing more, yada yada.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Honestly it really crystalizes for me just how good Steph really is as a player more than anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is the right takeaway from the Warriors overall. Despite it all Steph took the wreckage of the KD situation, and the turbulence of being Dray&rsquo;s teammate to another ring, and put them in a position to survive his injury if things had broken different in 2019. Guy&rsquo;s had a pantheon prime to me.</p>

      <label for="lf0syft" class="commentText"><p>Draymond is as u/Youratticdust put well, the Warriors blessing and curse simultaneously. They simply wouldn&rsquo;t be who they are without him, on and off the court, but that strangehold he has on this franchise has absolutely had a fallout. They&rsquo;ve won enough of course for it to be worth it, he has been and honestly still is great enough a player for it to be worth it, and for Draymond to have an extremely long leash, but that stranglehold has had fallout.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to me because we see stories like this of incredibly talented and productive members of society in different professions or civically who behind the scenes are micromanaging assholes, or abusive assholes&hellip;it really isn&rsquo;t a lot different than what we often see in general society&hellip;.people with tremendous power over people, over a workplace, etc. and how they wield it. They achieve results with their methods but there&rsquo;s a cost on the back end.</p>

<p>The difference in this situation is that Steph and Kerr are still riding with Draymond. And if they&rsquo;re behind him, than little else really matters in the grand scheme because that still gives the Warriors at least a faint hope at another &lsquo;22-like run. Most people won&rsquo;t question things deeply until/unless Draymond declines as a player or Steph/Kerr turn on him. But in most professions in 2024, Draymond&rsquo;s behavior, as great a player as he is, as great his history is with the Warriors, would never be accepted for as long as it&rsquo;s been accepeted in San Francisco.</p>

<p>I think KD came into a situation looking to be added to the brotherhood, looking to enhance and add to the brotherhood. He enhanced it but he was never truly one of the brothers. That bothered him. Steph was always the face. Steph was always the Golden Child. That bothered him. And Draymond as leader I think quite clearly never really&hellip;led. Leaders in situations like this should be the ones paving the way for a KD in this situation to feel right at home and feel like family. That didn&rsquo;t happen and KD felt it, and resentment crept in. Just a reflection of how fucking good that team was that it didn&rsquo;t matter. And respect to KD for going out there and putting the hard feelings aside in the name of winning rings.</p>

      <label for="lezcogx" class="commentText"><p>I think the leadership has been perfectly fine.  It&rsquo;s easy to say that it&rsquo;s lacking when you don&rsquo;t put Kerr&rsquo;s career into context.  As a player and as a coach he has seen and won with excellence at pretty much the highest level in NBA history.  Through all of that he has probably seen egos and inter-personal conflict that would make most people&rsquo;s head spin.  So when he&rsquo;s coaching a team that has had massive amounts of success and some young dudes who are either on their first contract or extension start flexing their egos despite the already established hall of fame legacies that are in front of them I do not fault a guy like Steve Kerr for not giving a shit.  If anything he failed as a coach last year for giving Klay too long of a leash, and for everyone who wants to cry &ldquo;boo-hoo&rdquo; about Draymond, you&rsquo;re talking about a guy who stuck it to Michael Jordan and played with Dennis Rodman, but his leadership should never be questioned given that his standard for excellence is backed by experience and results and is lightyears beyond what most people could hope to achieve in their careers, let alone in the NBA.</p>

<p>I don’t think there’s anything Kerr could have done to prevent Poole from getting clocked, and I think Kerr’s response to the situation was textbook “how to navigate a bad situation”. Draymond is just an asshole, but he’s an asshole you have to stand by if you want to win basketball games</p>

Like I don’t think anybody was happy that Draymond clocked Poole but they also gave Poole a huge extension and a tremendous amount of minutes and he managed to be so bad as both a player and a teammate that they shipped him out for an expiring contract the second they were allowed to do so; so that should tell you everything you need to know about how well liked Jordan Poole was despite getting literally everything a player in his position could hope to get.</p>

<p>its insane that you people still continue to parrot this complete strawman/falsehood all these years later.</p>

<p>he said both things were bad and unacceptable&hellip; you know people can hold more than one idea/opinion in their brains at once, right?</p>

<p>you realize that him making the statement that he thinks it wasnt right for a rogue employee to leak private behind the scenes footage to hundreds of millions of people (that frankly, was much more damaging to the reputation of POOLE than anyone else involved, so he was probably pretty upset on his behalf there as well) on the internet has literally nothing to do with any of the other thousands of opinions he holds on like world hunger&hellip; or climate change&hellip;. or yes, Draymond punching his teammate</p>

<p>thinking one of those things is bad does not preclude one from also thinking other things are bad</p>

      <label for="lf00sfl" class="commentText"><p>&ldquo;Their culture and their image and what&rsquo;s truly going on are not in alignment&rdquo;</p>

<p>People often let the results dictate the narrative. How often is a situation confirmed as a shitshow as it&rsquo;s happening yet actually still succeeds? We knew about Shaq and Kobe not getting along but still being able to flip a switch to win or seemingly every Chicago Bulls player vs management but most of the time we&rsquo;re none the wiser so all we have to go by are results. Often it&rsquo;s really easy to say, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re winning so everything must be cool&rdquo; just as much as it&rsquo;s easy to say that every losing team is a train wreck behind the scenes. Typically winning cures all and any dirty laundry is only aired out as a result of losing.</p>

<p>In reality, most teams behind the scenes probably have as much politics/nepotism/jealousy/coach banging the owners wife/dumb shit happening as any company us regular folks work/worked for. Even if all 30 teams have certain levels of incompetence/shenanigans, someone still has to win. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that team really functions great as an organization; ownership/management could be inadequate and just luck into a winning situation (see the Florida Marlins TWICE!).</p>

      <label for="lf0xkyi" class="commentText"><p>I feel like this is just another excuse to hate on the warriors as the last current dynasty. Their culture was solid Draymond was a necessary evil to the dynasty and despite what people say nothing really worked to calm him they tried talks, public statements, suspensions, suspensions in the playoffs, fines and even benching in multiple scenarios. He really just doesn&rsquo;t care about his actions in the moment.</p>

<p>As for the culture itself every legitimate dynasty has stains on it, because that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so hard to build a dynasty everyone gets egos. With the bulls you see the tension between Scotty and Michael, the coach and GM and rodman being wild. With the Lakers you saw the splits between Shaq and Kobe. Even the spurs had its issue with how to keep kawhi happy in the fold. It&rsquo;s just the nature of sports</p>

<p>Front office and Kerr have to get their arm twisted until it damn near pops off to use any disciplinary action or even talk about anything he&rsquo;s ever done in a negative light. Noone is held accountable there until recently because he&rsquo;s not as good.</p>

<p>KD is soft and emotional. He probably doesn&rsquo;t want to offend his friend, but why tf else would he leave? He hate winning easy championships that badly while having a perfect environment for his skills etc?</p>

<p>It was absolutely because of draymond and the fact the team did barely anything about it and let the inmates rum the asylum.</p>

If we&rsquo;re good friends and we get into an argument and you call me a bitch or whatever we can move past that. If you tell me that i&rsquo;m a bitch and nobody in our friend group wants/likes me around infront of everyone, and nobody says anything or comes out to say &ldquo;nah that&rsquo;s not true&rdquo; then that&rsquo;s a whole different story.</p>

But if I have a teammate who&rsquo;s been with me since the beginning and a guy who&rsquo;s newer and a serious threat to leave in free agency. I&rsquo;m probably going to side with the guy who&rsquo;s been with me.</p>

<p>With that said the overarching issue will always be KD was not treated like Steph in the organization and I think events like these further reinforced that would never happen. Because Draymond would never talk to Steph like that. It was unfortunate but with egos thered always a pecking order</p>

<p>Like I had plenty of heated arguments even with the best friends but never throw a punch. If someone does it, that&rsquo;s end of friendship. Who the f wants to be in a toxic relationship.</p>

<p>But yeah it&rsquo;s isnane how little consequences has Draymond seen over his actions&hellip; no doubt that made it only worse over the course of time.</p>

      <label for="lf22782" class="commentText"><p>Klay caused so many more losses than draymond. I know Klay averaged out to a good season in the end but in the first like third of the season he straight up lost them so many games by just chucking and missing every time he got the ball. Which when you’re fighting to make the playoffs through the play in in the first place, even a couple games is a big deal.</p>

      <label for="lezdcor" class="commentText"><p>He was amazing and did exactly what was needed in 22.  The next year it was soooooo frustrating to watch Poole drive as fast as he can down court with no real plan, then lose control and give a turnover.  It felt like that happened 20 times a game, but now without the magic shooting he had in the 22 playoffs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to talk shit about him, because he was definitely a huge part of 22 but by the time 23 was done, I think most Warriors fans were done with him.  For his sake, I hope he can get his shit together and play like he did in 22.</p>

<p>And I have to disagree with Dray solely decimating the dynasty. The team had injuries, CBA severely hampered the FO&rsquo;s ability to sign impactful players, the underwhelming bench pieces. Heck I&rsquo;d throw in Harrison Barnes during &lsquo;16 just straight up shooting terribly. Dray was a problem, but the dynasty was having issues aside from Draymond.</p>

      <label for="leyxj54" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s wild to me how hardcore that organization has tried to protect a really shitty person in Draymond Green.</p>

<p>Dude is responsible for costing them several championships if you think about it, between the Cavs series suspension and scaring KD off.</p>

<p>I just&hellip; I don&rsquo;t get it. How can anyone respect a man who&rsquo;s go to strategy on the court is to yell and scream, punch and kick people in the nuts, stomp on their chest, try to murder his own teammate because the guy said something mean (boo hoo).. play dirty in general.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not a good person. I don&rsquo;t care how he is off the court.</p>

That&rsquo;s not a leadership, they&rsquo;re a joke. They can&rsquo;t even have difficult conversations as a team as KD stated, they can&rsquo;t keep Draymond accountable. Clown organization.</p>

They have a literal sit down interview with just the two of them where they blame management for getting involved and say they were the only ones who could fix it. Okay if that was the case why tf didn&rsquo;t you call or talk to each other? This shit is so old and so in the past that I really don&rsquo;t care what either of them say at this point because they&rsquo;ve contradicted themselves so many times.</p>

<p>He ruined things with KD, he ruined things with Jordan Poole, he gets suspended and thrown out of games for his crazy shit on the court, and not once has Kerr or Steph gone to him and said “if you want to be on this team that can’t happen again” and you know they haven’t because it kept happening</p>

<p>Imagine being KD and a guy you consider a good friend is coming at you like that over a basketball play where he fucked up to begin with lmao Draymond is actually so stupid</p>

If I’m a normal player on those teams it’s not place to help mom and dad through a fight. If I’m Steph or Klay it’s not my place to mediate a fight between two of my boys/peers. It’s on KD and Dray to hash it out with each other and address it in front of the team if they want to.</p>

<p>Draymond is fragile and insecure with too much ego. But KD is the same way, he just has other ways of expressing that. The team broke up because they weren’t capable of swallowing their pride.</p>

<p>From a piece from &ldquo;The Athletic&rdquo;:</p>

<p>The interaction, to that point, appeared all in fun, absorbed well by Durant. He knows a max offer is heading his way at 12:01 a.m. on July 1, no questions asked. But then Fitzgerald mentioned Steph Curry getting every dollar of his mega max last July and Myers extended the joke … to a cringeworthy level.</p>

<p>“That was different,” Myers said of Curry. “He’s been here from the way before days. He’s earned it.”</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to format shit on my phone. Deal with it.</p>
