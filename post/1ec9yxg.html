</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s not the FO or Curry&rsquo;s fault that they have to babysit a fucking baby with an insane temper tantrum. It&rsquo;s the same reason Draymond got ZERO punishment for assaulting a young player in practice. What kind of organization lets that happen? Well maybe the Warriors organization is that incompetent but 90% of the blames goes to the fact that this was Draymond, the most unhinged player in the NBA who once threatened to kill Steve Kerr and also broke a college kid&rsquo;s jaw for no reason. Any other player it would have been easy to punish. But not with Green.</p>

<p>I can also give you reasons why Draymond lashed out at KD. That wasn&rsquo;t just a one time frustration with him fumbling the ball at the end of the game when he should have passed to KD. You can see his body language when he doesn&rsquo;t have the ball and the increased playmaking duty that KD desired in the Warriors offense. Green feels useless without the ball because he <em>is</em>, and that reached its breaking point in that Clippers game. KD also threatened Draymond&rsquo;s contract size the same way Poole threatened his, it&rsquo;s extremely unlike Draymond gets 25 million a year on top of the exorbitant luxury tax if KD received his birds right contract extension. Trading it for DLo&rsquo;s contract is what allowed Green to get that much money.</p>

      <label for="leyjfsu" class="commentText"><p>Everything KD says makes total sense logically. I appreciate how forthright KD tends to be a lot. You don&rsquo;t get candidness without pretentiousness from professional athletes often.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think KD left solely because of Dray, I think it was confirmation that it wasn&rsquo;t a long term destination for him, more confirmation than he&rsquo;d already had. That was the final nail in the coffin. But I don&rsquo;t think it was the singular reason.</p>

<p>The Dubs won the chip in &lsquo;22 and their legacy is stamped. Draymond&rsquo;s is stamped. But what&rsquo;s also become clear, is that what the Warriors publicize re: their culture and their image and what&rsquo;s truly going on behind the scenes are not in alignment and haven&rsquo;t been for years. Now that&rsquo;s more public than ever and people are realizing and recognizing this thing has been a shit show for a little bit behind the scenes. Honestly it really crystalizes for me just how good Steph really is as a player more than anything.</p>

<p>Kerr&rsquo;s leadership can be questioned but you can&rsquo;t question the coaching. You don&rsquo;t win at the level the Dubs have without excellent coaching. But the leadership one can say has been lacking. From Kerr on down. Can say it finally caught up with them last year.</p>

KD might be honest, but it takes a few interviews to see how he really feels about topics.</p>

      <label for="leyzgk0" class="commentText"><p>That’s kinda true for most public figures. Initially they try not to say anything and it makes sense why, it could make things worse and you’d have to handle it internally first. After that he’s been somewhat consistent, Dray got him fucked up but management made it so much worse by choosing to brush it aside and let it grow throughout the year. This interview was years ago. He’d only probably share more cause he’s more comfortable around podcast people he knows. And I don’t think he’d go deeper to shit on Draymond, probably doesn’t want to further any hurt feelings.</p>

That opens the offense for other guys 10x more than an iso scorer type. The iso guy may get the same points, but not with the same offensive flow for teammates that Steph provides.</p>

<p>He’s such a uniquely great player that I wonder sometimes if his teammates became overrated due to the great team success. I sometimes swing the other way and think they’re underrated though. I have no clue.</p>

      <label for="lezcogx" class="commentText"><p>I think the leadership has been perfectly fine.  It&rsquo;s easy to say that it&rsquo;s lacking when you don&rsquo;t put Kerr&rsquo;s career into context.  As a player and as a coach he has seen and won with excellence at pretty much the highest level in NBA history.  Through all of that he has probably seen egos and inter-personal conflict that would make most people&rsquo;s head spin.  So when he&rsquo;s coaching a team that has had massive amounts of success and some young dudes who are either on their first contract or extension start flexing their egos despite the already established hall of fame legacies that are in front of them I do not fault a guy like Steve Kerr for not giving a shit.  If anything he failed as a coach last year for giving Klay too long of a leash, and for everyone who wants to cry &ldquo;boo-hoo&rdquo; about Draymond, you&rsquo;re talking about a guy who stuck it to Michael Jordan and played with Dennis Rodman, but his leadership should never be questioned given that his standard for excellence is backed by experience and results and is lightyears beyond what most people could hope to achieve in their careers, let alone in the NBA.</p>

<p>I don’t think there’s anything Kerr could have done to prevent Poole from getting clocked, and I think Kerr’s response to the situation was textbook “how to navigate a bad situation”. Draymond is just an asshole, but he’s an asshole you have to stand by if you want to win basketball games</p>

Like I don’t think anybody was happy that Draymond clocked Poole but they also gave Poole a huge extension and a tremendous amount of minutes and he managed to be so bad as both a player and a teammate that they shipped him out for an expiring contract the second they were allowed to do so; so that should tell you everything you need to know about how well liked Jordan Poole was despite getting literally everything a player in his position could hope to get.</p>

      <label for="lezn73c" class="commentText"><p>I think the interesting part of their success is what the hell do you make of Draymond as a member of a team. Like, not just do fans like the guy, I get that lots of people don&rsquo;t like him, which is fine. But it seems to me that they have really struggled to manage his emotions and outbursts, in a way that&rsquo;s been really detrimental, despite him being an absolute anchor on the court. Personality analysis really drives me nuts in part because it&rsquo;s so hard for fans to really get a clear picture of, but a dude getting suspended in the finals and being a catalyst for KD leaving is pretty clear.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think KD left solely because of Dray, I think it was confirmation that it wasn&rsquo;t a long term destination for him, more confirmation than he&rsquo;d already had. That was the final nail in the coffin. But I don&rsquo;t think it was the singular reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with this, even without this KD had signals that he wasn&rsquo;t satisfied fully by the rings, that he felt he should&rsquo;ve been appreciated more for winning. Which, further makes me question the Warriors and Dray because how much of it is this conflict, how much of it was the org/coaching staff/locker room not doing more, yada yada.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Honestly it really crystalizes for me just how good Steph really is as a player more than anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is the right takeaway from the Warriors overall. Despite it all Steph took the wreckage of the KD situation, and the turbulence of being Dray&rsquo;s teammate to another ring, and put them in a position to survive his injury if things had broken different in 2019. Guy&rsquo;s had a pantheon prime to me.</p>

      <label for="lf00sfl" class="commentText"><p>&ldquo;Their culture and their image and what&rsquo;s truly going on are not in alignment&rdquo;</p>

<p>People often let the results dictate the narrative. How often is a situation confirmed as a shitshow as it&rsquo;s happening yet actually still succeeds? We knew about Shaq and Kobe not getting along but still being able to flip a switch to win or seemingly every Chicago Bulls player vs management but most of the time we&rsquo;re none the wiser so all we have to go by are results. Often it&rsquo;s really easy to say, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re winning so everything must be cool&rdquo; just as much as it&rsquo;s easy to say that every losing team is a train wreck behind the scenes. Typically winning cures all and any dirty laundry is only aired out as a result of losing.</p>

<p>In reality, most teams behind the scenes probably have as much politics/nepotism/jealousy/coach banging the owners wife/dumb shit happening as any company us regular folks work/worked for. Even if all 30 teams have certain levels of incompetence/shenanigans, someone still has to win. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that team really functions great as an organization; ownership/management could be inadequate and just luck into a winning situation (see the Florida Marlins TWICE!).</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand this mythical culture and image.  I guess the media fawned over the team and praised it, but this all lines up perfectly with what I expected was going on behind the scenes along with all the praise for his leadership and his role as the heart of the team.  The dude&rsquo;s an open book.  It was obvious that it only worked because the rest of the team took the bad with the good.</p>

It was clear after the first championship it wasn’t sitting right with him that it was always going to be Curry’s team. He had already isolated himself from the team this was just the nail in the coffin but it was also a result of KD wanting out.</p>

<p>Front office and Kerr have to get their arm twisted until it damn near pops off to use any disciplinary action or even talk about anything he&rsquo;s ever done in a negative light. Noone is held accountable there until recently because he&rsquo;s not as good.</p>

<p>KD is soft and emotional. He probably doesn&rsquo;t want to offend his friend, but why tf else would he leave? He hate winning easy championships that badly while having a perfect environment for his skills etc?</p>

<p>It was absolutely because of draymond and the fact the team did barely anything about it and let the inmates rum the asylum.</p>

<p>So no, it made no sense lol the guy that got punched got sent away instead of draymond</p>

      <label for="lezyhc2" class="commentText"><p>Hindsight bias? They traded Poole AFTER he shot 34% in the play offs including 27% in his last 4 games and was rated one of the worst defenders in the league for that entire season. The writing was on the wall and they got rid of a mistake. Dude was literally one of the most clowned on player that season and anyone who watched the warriors can tell you how awful he is.</p>

      <label for="leyvme0" class="commentText"><p>I disagree, Poole was definitely overrated by Warriors fans (he would never become the next Steph) but the fit the Warriors system really well. The Wizards dont play motion offense which makes less effective, he was a perfect match for the Warriors and if it wasnt for that punch he probably would have developed more under that system.</p>

<li><p>In the playoffs Durant played the best basketball of his life up to that point.</p></li>

<li><p>It was known that Durant was leaving the team before Draymond’s blowup, it’s a small part of the blowup happening in the first place (the main part being Draymond’s anger issues).</p></li>

The next year it was soooooo frustrating to watch Poole drive as fast as he can down court with no real plan, then lose control and give a turnover.  It felt like that happened 20 times a game, but now without the magic shooting he had in the 22 playoffs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to talk shit about him, because he was definitely a huge part of 22 but by the time 23 was done, I think most Warriors fans were done with him.  For his sake, I hope he can get his shit together and play like he did in 22.</p>

<p>And I have to disagree with Dray solely decimating the dynasty. The team had injuries, CBA severely hampered the FO&rsquo;s ability to sign impactful players, the underwhelming bench pieces. Heck I&rsquo;d throw in Harrison Barnes during &lsquo;16 just straight up shooting terribly. Dray was a problem, but the dynasty was having issues aside from Draymond.</p>

      <label for="lf048ok" class="commentText"><p>Draymond and KD had tensions before 2019. Almost certainly because KD took over a big chunk of Draymond&rsquo;s playmaking role and that made him useless. You can bet your ass Draymond had a lot to do with KD leaving, he was basically the only close &lsquo;friend&rsquo; there and the betrayal cut deep. KD also experienced the joys of winning a championship and realized that wasn&rsquo;t enough, so he tried to make a new &lsquo;friend&rsquo; team with Kyrie (and took a paycut just to get his friend DeAndre Jordan paid).</p>

<p>Dude is responsible for costing them several championships if you think about it, between the Cavs series suspension and scaring KD off.</p>

<p>I just&hellip; I don&rsquo;t get it. How can anyone respect a man who&rsquo;s go to strategy on the court is to yell and scream, punch and kick people in the nuts, stomp on their chest, try to murder his own teammate because the guy said something mean (boo hoo).. play dirty in general.</p>

<p>He ruined things with KD, he ruined things with Jordan Poole, he gets suspended and thrown out of games for his crazy shit on the court, and not once has Kerr or Steph gone to him and said “if you want to be on this team that can’t happen again” and you know they haven’t because it kept happening</p>

      <label for="lf03ds6" class="commentText"><p>It might be small time relative to the Draymond incident, but I think the little subtle joke at the 2017 championship parade from Joe Lacob  really cracked the foundation of the newly formed GSW Dynasty&hellip;</p>

<p>From a piece from &ldquo;The Athletic&rdquo;:</p>

<p>The interaction, to that point, appeared all in fun, absorbed well by Durant. He knows a max offer is heading his way at 12:01 a.m. on July 1, no questions asked. But then Fitzgerald mentioned Steph Curry getting every dollar of his mega max last July and Myers extended the joke … to a cringeworthy level.</p>

<p>“That was different,” Myers said of Curry. “He’s been here from the way before days. He’s earned it.”</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to format shit on my phone. Deal with it.</p>

Draymond blew up because KD was being wishy washy about an extension and the core was starting to realize KD wanted to walk. He was already starting to alienate himself. You can even see KD mouth “that’s why I’m out” toward dray during the incident. I’m sure dray had already been giving him shit about breaking up the dynasty. KD wanted to win again, more on his own, so he left. Now that he’s clearly not winning another, he’s trying to fault Dray… I, for one, am not falling for it</p>
