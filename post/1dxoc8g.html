      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1dxoc8g/anthony_slater_theres_growing_skepticism_league/"><p>[Anthony Slater] There&rsquo;s growing skepticism league wide that Jazz executive Danny Ainge will actually move on any Markkanen deal.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10127466-nba-trade-rumors-growing-skepticism-lauri-markkanen-gets-dealt-amid-warriors-buzz" target="_blank">Based on the article here</a></p>

<p>Context:</p>

<p>The Utah Jazz appear to be uncommitted to a possible Lauri Markkanen trade.
Anthony Slater of The Athletic reported that the Sacramento Kings heavily pursued Markkanen prior to signing DeMar DeRozan, but that the Jazz failed to meet the Kings imposed deadline and that sources around the league have grown skeptical that Utah will even move Markkanen.
&ldquo;The Kings went hard after the Utah Jazz&rsquo;s Lauri Markkanen earlier in the week, protecting Keegan Murray in the discussions but putting on the table what they believe was a substantial enough picks-based offer, team sources said,&rdquo; Slater wrote. &ldquo;But they put a deadline to their side of the deal, needing an answer quickly considering the urgency of the dissolving market. Utah didn&rsquo;t meet it. There&rsquo;s growing skepticism league wide that Jazz executive Danny Ainge will actually move on any Markkanen deal. So the Kings pivoted quickly to DeRozan, getting wind he&rsquo;d actually have interest and then hitting the gas pedal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There have been situations of trades coming out of everywhere, but it seems like no package has enticed Ainge enough to pull the trigger. It’s an understandable reaction, you can re-sign Lauri next off season and he’ll still be tradeable if needed, and Lauri has shown every indication of wanting to stay part of the Jazz.</p>

      <label for="lc3tlht" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, the Jazz have kept open cap space to re-negotiate his salary this year. that&rsquo;s a huge part of his appeal right now, is that you only have to send out $18M to match salaries with him but on August 7th, that goes away. He&rsquo;s still a great player with a lot of value because of how well he fits next to another star, but I think he&rsquo;s more valuable un-extended.</p>

      <label for="lc37icy" class="commentText"><p>He can re-negotiate and extend as early as August 6th, wouldn’t be trade eligible for 6 months after. That’d take them right up to the February 6th trade deadline. Should still have a window to get a trade so it’s not a major issue, but it does cut it close.</p>

<p>Having him locked in for 4 years will for sure increase his trade value, but even as an expiring I think it’s still probably pretty high (UFA is scary, but I assume whoever trades for him is ready to offer him a fat extension come summer). Helps that Lauri likely wants that restructure, there’s a chance it kicks him all the way up to <span class="math inline">\(33M if they’re giving a max extension, I’m sure he’d appreciate an extra \)</span>15M in his pocket.</p>

<p>Do run the risk of injury throughout the season, or messing with their tank (their pick is top 10 protected, so that should be fine, but maybe they don’t get top 3 odds for Cooper Flagg). Add in having to pay Lauri at a higher rate for <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the season (Jazz need to hit the salary floor anyways, so not a biggie)</p>

      <label for="lc3xjye" class="commentText"><p>I’m not so sure that locking him up for 4 years boosts his trade value all that much tbh. I think a lot of his trade value comes from having such a low number on the cap sheet. He’s already 27, so a team giving him a 4 year max is gonna be paying for <sup>31</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub> year old Lauri one day. Also, his best years have all come on dog shit teams where he was clearly the man, which won’t be the case if he’s traded to any of the currently rumored teams.</p>

<p>Dude has never even so much as played in a playoff game. I don’t think giving him the max ups his trade value. If anything, it might make the return worse. Especially if he isn’t as good, if not better, this year than he was last year. I think he’d make a fantastic third option on a title team, but I’m not sure many teams are gonna be able to afford a maxed 3rd option here soon.</p>

      <label for="lc35tu3" class="commentText"><p>After the Nets trade, a lot of teams just won&rsquo;t be robbed by Ainge again. And out of those teams that reportedly have deals on the table, I don&rsquo;t think they completely emptied thejr cupboard. If the Kings didn&rsquo;t include Murray, there&rsquo;s no doubt that GS didn&rsquo;t include Kuminga either.</p>

I think it is important to note the jazz got rid of two pretty important role players and just lost dunn. Im also pretty confident a team like the bucks might swoop in to grab a player like collins or clarkson. What im saying is the jazz will be BADDD, (also helps that all the awful teams are in the east as well so they cannabalize on eachother)</p>

<p>Ainge has a long track record - assembling the big 3 in 2007, lots of great draft picks both early and late in the draft, accumulating amazing assets, etc. Brad has been amazing so far, but he was also given a great core of players and assets to work with.</p>

<p>I just think Ainge has gotten a little underrated in this sub as of late.</p>

<p>Any other org probably would’ve fired Brad for being unable to get the Cs to the promised land as a coach. Ainge realized that he needed to be <em>promoted</em> instead to amplify his strengths.</p>

      <label for="lc3o581" class="commentText"><p>How much credit does Ainge get for the Big 3 in 2007 when it’s an open secret that McHale went out of his way to get Garnett to his former team (the Celtics)? The Lakers made an offer for him as well that was generally considered to be the better of the two offers, but McHale and Ainge went in a direction built to help the Celtics.</p>

<p>Almost everything they’ve done since stems from that. Without that trade, they don’t win a title, they don’t get the Brooklyn picks, they don’t have the quickest rebuild the sport has ever seen, they don’t get Tatum and Brown, etc etc etc.</p>

<p>It’s not to take away from that trade as a successful one for the Celtics, but I just dunno how much credit you can give Ainge when the criteria for making it happen was “work with another former Celtic to make a trade that specifically doesn’t benefit the Lakers”.</p>

<p>I’m still annoyed that he came in and tore everything down immediately. They had a chemistry and toughness problem. They needed a new coach. Ainge has an ego though. So now, the Jazz are stuck in this weird half tank with 500 mid 1st and high 2nd round picks for the next 7 years. All while Minnesota is knocking on the door with <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> of our starting rotation and our glue guy.</p>

<p>He’s dragging this Lauri mess along to supposedly maximize his value, when in reality it’s just prolonging the tank and ensuring our slide into a perpetual 8-10 lottery pick.</p>

The core Ainge left is by far the most important part of the team. Meanwhile I’ll also explain how you’re wrong about Ainge too.</p>

<p>He got Hayward who instantly had one of the most memorable injuries of NBA history and never looked the same. He got Kyrie who also was injured for a different playoff run and then faded in others before being traded away himself. He got Isaiah Thomas who ALSO got injured. He got Brogdon who ALSO got injured. Not to mention that a couple of those moves might have still worked if Brown didn’t get injured before the playoffs (4?) seasons ago, or Tatum didn’t get injured in the first minute of game 7 against the Heat.</p>

Taking care of Conley sounds bad for business.</p>

<p>In aggregate they should have gotten substantially more and that&rsquo;s why the trade was graded the way it was (big win for LAL, win for MIN, loss for UTA).</p>

<p>Conley is the man you gotta take care of him if you have any decency as an organization.  He was also on a terrible contract.   Minnesota did that to get off D Lo as much as it was to get Conley.</p>

The Knicks gave up 5 damn firsts for Bridges, included pick swaps, and another good role player and no one batted an eye. Lauri is more valuable than Bridges&hellip;</p>

<p>The only way a fleece happens is if a team gives up a bunch of firsts AND players that are all valuable but no one is doing that.</p>

<p>The picks are way less valuable than you think. Here are the picks the 1sts that were traded:</p>

<p>2025 NYK 1st</p>

<p>2025 MIL 1st (top 4 protected)</p>

<p>2027 NYK 1st</p>

<p>2029 NYK 1st</p>

<p>2031 NYK 1st</p>

<p>Brooklyn also has the right to swap 1sts in 2028. So of the five 1sts that Brooklyn is receiving, two of them are this year and both project to be very late 1st round picks. It&rsquo;s hard to project how teams are going to look in three years time because of the 2nd apron stuff, but I think it&rsquo;s safe to assume that as long as the Knicks have the core of Brunson/OG/Bridges, they will at least be a 45+ win team in the Eastern Conference for years to come.</p>

They could, obviously, be nothing or you could have no one on the Knicks that is currently on that team and they could be a bottom feeder.

      <label for="lc3un4z" class="commentText"><p>It’s incredible how fucked up the trade market is. I don’t know when it started but it’s only gotten worse and the Mikal trade somehow tops the others. The Paul George and Gobert trades were huge ones that saw a ton of assets go away, but PG came off an MVP level season and Gobert is a game changer on defense. 5 picks for a third option now, and I feel like it’s only gonna get worse. Maybe it just stems from teams realizing that since non-lottery picks struggle to be consistently valuable, it’s worth sending fistfuls of firsts and seconds to get proven guys</p>

      <label for="lc44mfv" class="commentText"><p>Lauri is prob not more valuable thdn brudges . Bridges is locked in two years deal , plays better defence , can fit anywhere , and most importantly PLAYS EVERY GAME , Lauri meanwhile averages 50 games a season. There’s more demand for a bridges then. Lauri in the league . Lauri weak defending for his height and lack of creating fit team mates and previous not being that special lowers his value plus only one year deal left . Like you might trade for him n get cavs lauri which is nice but an over pay when he’s not healthy enough too</p>

      <label for="lc32hcx" class="commentText"><p>I think so as well. It&rsquo;s like they traded for 2022 Nets production which was a few months of basketball when everything Bridges has done in his career points to him being like a 17 PPG guy on solid efficiency for the Nets. Idk if Bridges is even a borderline all-star tbh. He&rsquo;s like a borderline borderline AS&hellip;</p>

<p>Yet again, the consensus still isn&rsquo;t that the Knicks got robbed. Which just shows you how highly any good player is valued&hellip;</p>

This Knicks team almost seems like a Miami heat squad, but thibs just has that kind of gritty style of coaching and play. Honestly if they dish Randle they could get a real second option. And they have all the scrappy guys to back up Brunson and another star. Obviously I&rsquo;m a Celtics fan but I&rsquo;ve been saying they should dish him out for the greater good of the team</p>

We&rsquo;ve already seen the Kings pivot and even GS signed several vets to tweak the middle of their rotation once Klay and CP3 left. I don&rsquo;t think teams are gonna let Ainge hold them up. If anything it&rsquo;s more valuable to trade Lauri now than waiting six months and ruining your chances of a high pick in this 2025 draft.</p>

      <label for="lc3auzv" class="commentText"><p>Do the jazz owners actually want to tank? They always sell out.</p>

<p>I think they’re repeating what they did last year, show some growth/life and be exciting until they need to tank hard. They could miss on Flagg but be at the 4-8 range eventually.</p>

<p>Who you got at 1-7? All i see are the blazers, wizards, chicago, nets tanking from the get go. The rest would be trying to win until a clear sign to tank hard.</p>

<p>They can still trade away clarkson earlier than Lauri. Lauri can be traded at the deadline if they extend him on <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> iirc</p>

It’s easier for teams to send out 18m to match his current contract and extend him themselves than to salary match whatever contract ainge gives him.

<p>Utah who have the cap space can renegotiate with bird rights and sign him for 5yrs 202mil
So you lock up the asset if you let him renegotiate
It’s in Markannens best interest to renegotiate first before being traded. And the new team will want to ensure he’s looked after to keep him</p>

<p>What do we really know about the offers he’s gotten? The Kings pulled out and got DeRozan. The Warriors aren’t able to trade enough picks - is any other teams truly making an offer? The Spurs might but they obviously haven’t. So it’s either take the Dubs pu pu platter, or wait…</p>

When stars in the NBA want to go to a team they can demand it at anytime and <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> times they’ll get there.  If Lauri wants to go to a team, he can force his way there. Ie “hey Danny, trade me to the spurs, my agent is gonna tell other teams that at X date…so make it happen before I take all the leverage”. If he wants to stay with the Jazz long term, he can just tell teams “I won’t resign with you. If you trade for me anyway prepare for my Vince Carter impression” and he won’t get traded.  The press has reported that he wants to stay in Utah, so….i don’t see how he gets traded if his team is telling reporters that publicly. </p>

      <label for="lc2z4u0" class="commentText"><p>Here&rsquo;s how I see the Jazz situation. They probably wanted to tank after the Mitchell and Gobert deals but the team was actually not terrible to start the 2022-23 season. With them not getting a good chance at Wemby and the 2024 draft being a weaker draft they figured they&rsquo;d look to trade for a star to pair with Lauri, which they haven&rsquo;t been able to do. The 2025 draft has high rated prospects so they figure they might want to trade Lauri now to bottom out for high lottery odds in this years draft. The issue is though the offers probably haven&rsquo;t included promising young players or draft picks in the 2025 or 2026 draft which they are probably prioritsing. Maybe they still have hope of trading for that other star though or think they can still be bad with Lauri and are very hopeful of extending him and then potentially trading him if needed</p>

<p>BUT Lauri averaged 1.4 FGA attempts more than Clarkson who was second on the team in FGA. This just in, your point guard is going to have a very high usage rate. Denver&rsquo;s near heliocentric offense to Jokic still only resulted in him having 1.3% more usage than Murray last year.</p>

<p>Presti took a king’s ransom from the Clippers when he knew that Kawhi wouldn’t sign without PG.  But otherwise he does a lot of wheeling and dealing including overpays to get what he wants.  Values certain types of players and high value contracts.  Also sometimes ships players out to a better situation rather than maximizing returns.  That’s how he gets the good will to make lots of deals, have to be willing to lose some of them.</p>

      <label for="lc36qpl" class="commentText"><p>I mean this is good news for Lauri. He just gets to wait out the rest of his contract, and get a fat payday. If the jazz want any value out of him, they need to restructure/resign and trade him. If I&rsquo;m Lauri I have no incentive to do that unless he values this one extra season that much. If he restructures resigns now, he can likely go to a contender this year and be locked in on a multi-year deal already. If he plays out this year makes an all-star game or like all NBA, dude can just get Max to wherever can pay him, or take a pay cut to choose where he goes. Kings getting DeMar really put the nail on the coffin for them, I think GSW is already looking at other options, or plan to circle back later. Either way no one is giving Utah four to five first rounders for a guy with one year left, And there isn&rsquo;t a ton of incentive for him to get a new deal before free agency. I don&rsquo;t think they can even restructure until August either, so it&rsquo;s just a waiting game. Not sure who&rsquo;s going to sink all this value into him come August, and Ainge really just let him walk, Believe me.</p>

      <label for="lc3m69s" class="commentText"><p>The Jazz don&rsquo;t have to trade Lauri Markkanen now. They can absolutely wait until after the extension. They can wait until the deadline. There is zero rush to trade Lauri and Ainge recognizes that. He recognizes the privilege of having a legitimate star player in his prime is, in Utah, and one that wants to play there long term. He recognizes that it&rsquo;ll be difficult to obtain someone in the draft or in trade who&rsquo;ll ever compare to Lauri. He&rsquo;s a building block piece. So the price is going to be very high as it should.</p>

<p>Jazz can be bad with Lauri on the team&hellip;they already have plenty of future assets and current draft picks in their room. There&rsquo;s no urgency to trade Lauri now. Ainge also recognizes that teams get desperate. Although with the nature of the cap situation and market for most teams now, they&rsquo;re kinda forced into taking action now for the few players remaining on the market which will shut the door in a Lauri move (SAS, SAC two examples, LAL seems focused on Kuzma or smaller deals). Time is often leverage and it was for Portland with Dame but it isn&rsquo;t one here because teams wanna make sure they get their additions in quickly before another team scoops up who they want.</p>

      <label for="lc37g92" class="commentText"><p>The Knicks package is so overrated it&rsquo;s unbelievable. Of the five 1sts the Knicks traded, two of them are 1sts this year (NYK and MIL), both of which will be late 20&rsquo;s. Also, all of the Knicks&rsquo; best players are below the age of 30. The value of their 2027 and 2029 picks are pretty low. You can easily make the argument that two unprotected Lakers/Warriors 2029 and 2031 picks are much more valuable than the five picks the Knicks sent out.</p>
