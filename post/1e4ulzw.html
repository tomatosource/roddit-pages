      <label for="ldicz4b" class="commentText"><p>Seriously. Literally every player that comes over from Europe says the NBA is easier because of the ruleset. But the league will never change because offense makes for good social media clips, and that’s how the vast, vast majority of people consume the sport.</p>

<p>Just to add, anybody who looks at the league objectively can tell it&rsquo;s in a bubble, and that the tv deal they just signed is wildly over-inflated.  Yes, tv numbers are dwindling, but the NBA is the only major US sports league that is <em>losing</em> tv viewership.</p>

<p>The MLB is up ~6% from last year, which was up ~7% from 2022.</p>

<p>The NFL posted its second highest average viewership numbers since 1995 last season.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.sportsmediawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nbaviewership-timeline-edit.png" target="_blank">the NBA</a> has been steadily losing tv viewership for decades.</p>

<p>Nothing about the way the league is being handled right now is remotely healthy for its future, and ballooning contracts will only make older (and potential newer) fans bounce right off more than they already are when they see their favorite player will soon be paid 100 million dollars a year while sitting 20% of the season.</p>

<p>This made absolutely zero sense, Kerr has always ran small ball lineups just go back and look at his Warriors teams through out the years. He refuses to play big lineups.</p>

<p>Any other coaches would bench JJJ in FIBA if he they saw the stats sheet and he got the same amount of rebounds as austin reaves.</p>

<p>My statement about kerr running small ball made sense cause they were better with JJJ off the floor than on.</p>

JJJ was in foul trouble most of the games and they lost the one game he didn’t play against Canada also who do you think was gonna replace JJJ Walker Kessler? Bobby Portis?

      <label for="ldhp4x8" class="commentText"><p>As I said in my original comment. Its not Steve Kerr&rsquo;s fault that he doesn&rsquo;t have a servicable big in the lineup. His lineup is solely dependent on JJJ being an AD lite type of player and he turned into roy hibbert.</p>

<p>if JJJ was good enough he would have played longer and stayed on the floor longer. He was outplayed by almost anyone he faced in the tournament. Draymond green is not on the floor to end games because he is small, it because he is better than bigger player lol.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>JJJ was on foul trouble most of the games</p>
</blockquote>

<p>well that wasn&rsquo;t steve kerr&rsquo;s fault cause that dude is always in foul trouble with the grizz.</p>

<p>BUT I fully agree with you and it was damn frustrating all year last year with the Dubs line ups too.</p>

<p>There were at least 4 games probably more that we lost because of his wonky rotations and refusal to play our young guys that were ballin.  Pulling Moody when he was on a heater. Etc.</p>

<p>Also, no defensive 3 seconds in international play, so the other team just puts a man under the basket for the whole possession and the US doesn&rsquo;t make them pay with spacing and shooting 3s, which are more like NBA long 2s.</p>

Klay, Steph, Dray, Barnes, they were all developed by Mark Jackson, he just wasn&rsquo;t able to get past his old school style of play with ISO ball. He did instill confidence in the backcourt and gave Draymond a huge vote of confidence as a rookie plying him in 79 games. Jackson also instilled a defensive mindset that is still the Warriors priority.</p>

      <label for="ldirvnc" class="commentText"><p>The irony is that he&rsquo;s a victim of his own success. A big part of what set those Warriors teams apart from the rest of the league was not just their talent but also their <em>style</em> of play with all the ball movement and cutting and floor spacing and libertine attitude towards the 3 point shot, etc.</p>

<p>Now that the rest of the NBA has caught on and every team plays basically that exact same style, it&rsquo;s not nearly as much of a differentiating factor for the Warriors as it used to be, and without that differentiation they can&rsquo;t get that same separation from the pack. It&rsquo;s like a company that enjoys temporary success from some proprietary new technology, but the advantage fades away when that technology switches from being a rogue innovation to the industry standard.</p>

<p>Kerr was a big factor in setting the industry standard of modern NBA basketball, which if you could get a sneak peek of 20 years ago would look like aliens playing a different sport. As Hubie Brown would say, give the man some credit.</p>

      <label for="ldj1483" class="commentText"><p>Are you ignoring my point? Because it sounds like it. If the U.S. is in a close match against anyone, look at the rebound differential. Look at the turnover differential. It&rsquo;s one or the other that the US has lost to the opponent.</p>

<p>The U.S. is still in another world when it comes to forcing stops and generating points in transition. And when they&rsquo;re doing that while not coughing up the ball and giving up offensive rebounds, they&rsquo;re virtually impossible to beat.</p>

<p>My only concern in the future involves the lack of relative front-court size and and skill. If Embiid didn&rsquo;t elect to play for the U.S. then this team becomes a little shaky on the glass. It&rsquo;s only going to become shaker in the future if homegrown talent doesn&rsquo;t pan out.</p>

<p>There won&rsquo;t be a significant need for the U.S. to run advanced half-court sets. We&rsquo;re not at that point, but when the need arises, they&rsquo;ll be ready.</p>
