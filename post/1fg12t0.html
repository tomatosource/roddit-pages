</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>5 year Peak RAPM - RAPM is essentially a stat that is meant to adjust for the weaknesses of plus-minus. It adjusts for opponent quality, and team quality.</p>

<p>Considered Elite On-Ball Defenders but Weaker Off-Ball</p>

<p>Lu dort: 1.1(Rank 597)</p>

<p>Klay Thompson: 1.1(Rank 597)</p>

<p>Kobe Bryant: 0.2(Rank 1310)</p>

<p>Jaylen Brown: 1.3(Rank 491)</p>

<p>Avery Bradley: 2.0(Rank 262)</p>

<p>The guys with the highest D-RAPM peaks ever are typically rim protectors or are considered some of the best help defenders ever. Draymond Green(5.4), Kevin Garnett(7.1), Tim Duncan(5.8), Giannis(5.0), Embiid(5.0) are all around the top 10 ever in D-RAPM peaks.</p>

<p>Players like Robert Covington who is a specialist in help defense has a D-RAPM of 3.9 and has the 38th best D-RAPM peak ever. This isn&rsquo;t to say that D-RAPM is a perfect stat for evaluating specific defenders or comparing specific defenders.</p>

<p>But I think the pattern holds, where weak off-ball defenders don&rsquo;t look great most of the time. Weak on-ball defenders but good off-ball defenders who might be viewed as negative defenders, can actually look quite similar in impact relative to elite defenders who are considered elite because of their on-ball defense.</p>

      <label for="lmz2ecl" class="commentText"><p>NBA defense is so hard to evaluate because of the things that <em>don&rsquo;t</em> happen. A huge recovery block is a highlight. The guy who is in position early and doesn&rsquo;t need to recover (and possibly just forces the pass) looks like a routine play. RAPM sees this, the &ldquo;eye test&rdquo; largely doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

      <label for="lmznm56" class="commentText"><p>He wasn&rsquo;t quite first team because the mid 2010&rsquo;s had some amazing defenders (Robinson, Holiday) but he really was in the tier right below. He was quite amazing. Dude was super strong and dug into players. Not the defensive playmaker that generated a lot of defensive stats but he stuck to guys like glue, especially the top guys in the playoffs. He did an amazing job defending a huge range of players from skilled guards like Kyrie to hyper athletic ones like Westbrook to Harden and even did a phenomenal job on Kawhi in the 2019 finals. In my opinion his peak defensively gets underrated, a lot of people argued that he only got the title of great defender cuz of name recognition but honestly, in the playoffs there weren&rsquo;t many better POA defenders. In the mid 2010&rsquo;s I would only really put Iguodala, Holiday, Roberson ahead of him. I think Covington is in the same tier as him, a better defensive playmaker but not quite as great on-ball guy. I&rsquo;ll get hate for this but I&rsquo;d have Marcus Smart right behind peak Klay, Smart is the better defensive playmaker but I honestly think peak Klay did a better job staying in front of guys. I know that people will hate on that statement, Marcus is a great defender and has had a longer defensive peak but Klay was really tremendous in his heyday defensively.</p>
