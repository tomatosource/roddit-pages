      <label for="lkhm5ul" class="commentText"><p>Classic is like Baby&rsquo;s First MMO. Everything is dumbed down and simple from a modern gaming perspective; the equivalent of 1950s basketball compared to the modern era. Retail WoW has eschewed a lot of the more traditional rpg aspects that old mmos had, in favor of more combat-focused instanced content with more complexity and depth.</p>

<p>That said, retail has difficulties that are able to cater to every skill level</p>

      <label for="lkhm7oq" class="commentText"><p>Classic is a 15-20 yo game, everything was simpler, less complex with not much going on. Gaming culture was also much different ( leveling phase value vs endgame )</p>

<p>In classic leveling takes a long time and is supposed to be a big part of the wow, endgame is pretty straightforward and painfully simple for 2024 standards.</p>

<p>In retail leveling is just a mean to get to level max, and therefore is simplified and quicker, but a random mob in a dungeon will have more mechanics than a classic boss, and there is just much more things to do outside of the classic raiding/pvp cycle</p>

<p>Duncan has three Finals MVP’s btw, and two regular season MVP’s. And also never missed the playoffs in his prime. (Or at all!)</p>

<p>If Shaq were on Duncans team, they would have won six straight. And Duncan probably wouldn’t have gotten Shaq kicked off the team like Kobe did and cripple his team with contracts as he aged out the league.</p>

<p>Shorter prime but bigger impact when he was outside of his prime, imo</p>

<p>On one hand we have TD winning FMVP in his sophomore year, on the other we have Kobe winning 3 rings as second star by the age 23&hellip;</p>

<p>It is hard to compare this two, I will say that Duncan was really dominant from 1999 to 2005, and remained great till 2011, but then faded.</p>

<p>Kobe became great in 2000 and keep improving till 2003, then was dominant from then to 2011, and then had 2 more seasons till 2013 when he was still at nearly MVP levels. The last three year of Kobe career were just miserable because of the terrible injuries, but I&rsquo;m most than sure that if you plug 2016 Kobe into a contender like it was San Antonio he would have done great, probably better than TD that was just a good starter.</p>

<p>Basketball wise, Kobe is a 30-40% more productive, more versatile and more skilled offensive player who can do more from more areas of the court despite the two having nearly  identical TS%.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re both all time defenders at their positions and defense probably accounts for 30% when comparing it to offense.</p>

<p>Duncan is the only person in top 10-12 consideration who&rsquo;s never scored more than 25 PPG in a season besides Magic and Magic was getting you 10-12 APG every year so it didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

<p>You sure do spit out some highly dubious stats. That Kobe is 30-40% more productive is just laughable and easily verified to be false.</p>

<p>Duncan is there because of his defense, why would there be an asterisks on that? For a big man especially who can control the paint in an era where scoring in the paint dominated, that is one of the keys to winning.</p>

<p>People bend over backwards to discourage Duncan just like they call Kobe an inefficient chucker.</p>

      <label for="lkhdq94" class="commentText"><p>Your own stats just proved you wrong, there is a big difference between 27.27% and 30-40%. I can do math too, 27% is only 67% of 40%. You&rsquo;re missing 33%.</p>

<p>And Duncan was a better defender than Kobe, his defense was way more important to the team, they weren&rsquo;t roughly equal. Offense does not matter more than defense for a big man, it&rsquo;s a huge key to winning games, especially in the playoffs. It mattered even more back when they played compared to now because outside shooting wasn&rsquo;t as important.</p>

<p>34.98% is almost exactly the in the middle of 30 and 40% lmao. Unlike you I didn&rsquo;t have to cherry pick sentences because my logic is solid.</p>

<p>If someone owed you $27 bucks how much would you say they owed you? About 30 bucks. Cool moving on.</p>

<p>Defense never mattered more than offense. It will never matter more than offense. The gap between Duncan and Kobe on offense is huge. The gap between Duncan and Kobe on defense is not.</p>

<p>Y&rsquo;all overrate Duncan&rsquo;s defense because you have to to keep him in these discussions because of how lackluster and non-productive his offense was compared to other Greats.</p>

<p>Why would focus on comparing just 1 season&rsquo;s outlier when you can use 15-18 seasons?</p>

<p>I provided objective data. That data states that at their peaks there&rsquo;s a 35% difference and for their careers it&rsquo;s a 27% difference and for the playoffs it&rsquo;s about 25-26% difference.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not delusional. I have objective data. You&rsquo;re talking out of your ass about a guy that was always surrounded with elite defenders and coached in an elite defensive scheme to inflate his importance.</p>

<p>Cry about it lmfao. Duncan has the weakest offensive credentials of any all timer not named Bill Russell. That&rsquo;s factual.</p>

<p>Both are elite defenders. Kobe&rsquo;s 30-40% more productive on offense and that includes in the playoffs. They both have the same TS%.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s literally no way you can say that lmaoooo. Offense is like 70% of the game.</p>

<p>Duncan is arguably the best defender of all time anchoring some of the best defenses ever. Kobe was a mediocre guard defender whose entire case rests on media awards. Duncan’s case? What actually happened on the court.</p>

<p>I will put it this way, Kobe’s offensive gap over Duncan isn’t enough to outweigh the ocean sized gap that Kobe’s defense needs to overcome to catch up to Duncan.</p>

<p>a player can play perfect defense and still get scored on. Basketball does not award points for good defensive possessions and as I just mentioned even perfect defensive possessions can result in points. You can do everything right and still get scored on.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re getting points if you do everything right on offense.</p>

<p>Perfect offense results in points. Offense is far more valuable because the game is determined by who scores more. This isn&rsquo;t up for debate.</p>

<p>You guys have to inflate the importance of defense, give Duncan hypothetical points increases and ignore scoring in a game about scoring to try to argue he&rsquo;s better than someone who scores significantly more on the same TS.</p>

<p>Duncan&rsquo;s not even the best offensive big in Spurs history lmao. Robinson is better on offense lmao.</p>

      <label for="lkhsz3j" class="commentText"><p>Offense is most of the game on an individual level, defence is much more determined by coaching, effort and teamwork. Spurs are a great example, they were elite defensively before and after Duncan. Duncan almost always played with elite, often borderline DPOY level defenders as well to boost the Spurs. Hard to gauge his actual impact of Spurs defence, but it’s not as high as Kobe’s impact on the post-Shaq Lakers offence</p>

Sometimes your second option will have a better matchup against someone than your number one, and when that second option is Kobe fucking Bryant, yeah, he’s going to destroy. Kobe annihilated the Spurs, but the Spurs were still trying to focus on how to beat Shaq.</p>

Like prime Shaq could get his averages against anyone but you shouldn’t exactly be relying on him when you’re against a defensive front court of Duncan and Robinson.</p>

Bulls part 2 got another HOFer in Rodman. Like the only “authenticity built” dynasty of the last 30 years was the spurs, and imo they weren’t a traditional dynasty.

      <label for="lkh31u5" class="commentText"><p>2008 to 2012, there is no doubt about who was the best player between Kobe and Duncan. The fact that Lakers run through reigning champs like this was wild tho, don&rsquo;t remember much reign champs being demolished like this considering no major roster changes. Particularly in game 2 and closing game 5 with major comeback&hellip;</p>

<p>Also made me wonder what happens if Lakers made the move for Gasol (or Garnett as it was rumored back then) the year before  in 2007, maybe Kobe would have his own threepeat by now.</p>

<p>2 years Kobe didn&rsquo;t played and was recovering from an Achilles, that&rsquo;s why. In 2016 Kobe was better as a basketball player, we don&rsquo;t know if he had an actual good team what he would have been.</p>

<p>But in general yeah Duncan was better. But from 2005 to 2013 Kobe was better, and he was already 2 years into his prime while TD wasn&rsquo;t the same after 2005.</p>

      <label for="lkh8ebw" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I agree with you, we objectively had the better roster from 99-04 and had a much worse roster between then 07-08. We had Shaq, Kobe and some of the best role players ever, and that Lakers roster is regularly considered one of the best of all time. Idk why he’s saying it was equal when both teams went through phases of just having a better team than the other. Lakers and Spurs basically took turns winning championships during that whole stretch of the early 2000s.</p>

<p>Kobe always brought it against the Spurs. I dunno if he hated us or what, but he always showed out. I know Shaq was the more dominant player for sure, but we had DRob and Duncan guarding the post. Kobe would carve our guards up every time.</p>

      <label for="lkhbz4k" class="commentText"><p>The Lakers were stacked for nearly all of Kobe&rsquo;s career. He was on an average team for only 3 seasons before the injury.</p>

<p>And people wildly exaggerate how bad those teams were and how much Kobe elevated them. They had Lamar Odom who was a great player and on the Olympic roster. Also Caron Butler for one season, who was excellent and an All-Star just after he left. Plus Walton, Parker, Bynum, Brown, Cook and Evans were all typical decent to mediocre starter to rotation pieces.</p>

<p>Add an MVP level player to those 05-07 rosters and they could easily be a good or even great team.</p>

<p>But in 05 they stank it up with 34 wins. That roster had Kobe, Odom, Caron Butler, Chucky Atkins and Chris Mihm with some okay bench guys. There was no reason for them to suck so hard.</p>

<p>06 was decent. 45 wins and pushed the Suns to 7 games. Still out in the 1st round and hardly a great season.</p>

<p>07 they fell back to 42 wins and got dusted by the Suns. Hardly some amazing carry job.</p>

<p>Kobe was much better as an elite player on already good playoff teams. He never elevated bad or average teams very high.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s just straight up not true lmao</p>

<p>Luke Walton is a career 4 ppg scorer that gets no minutes for a reason</p>

<p>Smush Parker was out of the league the moment he left the Lakers</p>

<p>Bynum was 18 and wasn&rsquo;t an an-star until after the championships</p>

<p>Kwame, Cook and Evans are all end of bench guys for middling/bottom teams when they&rsquo;re not on the Lakers</p>

<p>None of these guys are starter material outside of Bynum</p>

      <label for="lkhadop" class="commentText"><p>It’s insult to say that that’s the reason people rank him highly. It bothers me to no end that ever since he died, there have been so many fucking people that respond to Kobe fans or players saying good things about Kobe as a GOAT with “ur only saying that cuz he dead, nobody said this before.” It’s not only insanely fucking disrespectful, but also the furthest thing from the truth.</p>

<p>Like what the fuck happened with this Reddit and Twitter where all of a sudden they are convinced if Kobe didn’t die, he would simply be known as a certified shot-chucking bum outside of the Top 20. What the fuck kind of revisionist history has been going on??</p>

<p>Nothing boils my blood more than “y’all never said that before he died!” especially when it’s coming from a 16yo. The fucking audacity</p>

<p>I remember when so many people had the Top 3 all-time as MJ, Kobe, and LeBron. So many edits/pictures of those 3 standing together on the internet. Funny how after his death, people have done everything they can to scrub that from the internet’s memory.</p>

<p>Literally the <em>opposite</em> of what y’all are claiming.</p>

<p>Kobe VS Timmy is a close debate.</p>

<p>Comparable to:</p>

<p>Wilt VS Bill</p>

<p>Magic VS Larry</p>

<p><strong>&ndash;</strong></p>

<p>But most people think Wilt VS Bill, and Magic VS Larry were a better true debate than Timmy VS Kobe (in both ways. Some say Timmy is much better, some say Kobe is much better)</p>

<p>No one reasonable guy I know said Magic or Larry is much better than the other.</p>

<p>Something happened after his death where new NBA fans that enjoy reading spreadsheets got the red pen out and began revising history. But luckily, it’s written in stone for most of us. That was Kobe’s reign.</p>

      <label for="lkhfpgc" class="commentText"><p>And yet Victor Wembanyama gets more headlines than Anthony Davis. Spurs players have never had issues getting headlines. You ever heard of Kawhi Leonard? Heck, the Spurs coach gets a lot of fanfare too 🤣</p>

<p>The fact is that the spotlight was never on Tim Duncan as much as his fans would’ve liked because he was part of a <em>system</em>. This copium about media presence is absolutely hilarious, like the Chicago Bulls needed media presence for MJ to become what he was. Or the Cleveland Cavaliers for Lebron James 🤣🤣🤣</p>

<p>It was never the Tim Duncan show, it was the Spurs show with multiple HOFers, 3+ different FMVPs during the dynasty, and various elite role players. That is why there was no focus on him.</p>

<p>If LeBron can get eyes on him in <em>Cleveland</em>, there are no excuses for San Antonio. Sorry.</p>

      <label for="lkhlt67" class="commentText"><p>The problem with this comparison is that Duncan was probably the best player on the Spurs for almost all of those 82 games.  Maybe some at the very end Kawhi surpassed him but that&rsquo;s probably it (and while Kobe was prob still the best player on the Lakers at that time, he had declined a lot but the Lakers roster was garbage).  Kobe absolutely was not the best player on his team for about 7 of those seasons early in Duncan/Kobe&rsquo;s careers.</p>

<p>Kobe was <em>the</em> chucker but he won a lot doing it. Didn’t work all the time but outside of his last few years where he was legit terrible and crippled, it worked. He had a higher TS% than Duncan for most of their careers, which is pretty crazy considering his shot chart.</p>

      <label for="lkh988u" class="commentText"><p>Big man defense is almost always more valuable than guard and perimeter defense by nature of the game, it’s not even comparable.</p>

<p>It’s like comparing the defense ofHakeem and MJ. Both DPOYs and all time defenders but it’s not even close in terms of impact, because rim protection or the threat of it typically prevents shots and attempts that are generally considered higher percentage shots. That, and almost every player on offense will attempt or threaten to drive while not every player (especially back then) plays on the perimeter or attempts 3’s or long 2’s.</p>

<p>The best perimeter defender in the league will almost never have the same impact as the best big man/rim protector in the league.</p>
