They let him walk because the difference between the team trying to win a chip with PG is about the same without him, and they’re right.</p>

<p>Pg has continuously struggled in the playoffs, has been just as unavailable as Kawhi (only played 39 more games), and is one of the most inconsistent/frustrating players to watch.</p>

<p>Harden on the other hand has had a much more consistent/well rounded impact on being the 2nd star while also elevating the rest of the team.</p>

<p>I also think regardless of picks, Ballmer doesn&rsquo;t want his team to be total dogshit, so you cut the fat (PG demanding 50m+ annually is a lot of fat) and try to re-tool to build the best team possible, even if it&rsquo;s not a championship contender.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s fine. Look at OKC, they weren&rsquo;t good when they moved from Seattle.</p>

<p>Being a 1st round team with PG vs a play-in team without him isn&rsquo;t going to have any real impact on the franchise. Going over the 2nd apron for PG would.</p>

<p>Other than kawhi (3 years) and Harden (2) , most of their salaries are 1 year.</p>

<p>You can go into the 2nd apron and come out again when the contracts expire,</p>

<p>So a decade is a bit too much, even allowing for a spot of rebuilding due to picks. And it can&rsquo;t guarantee that.</p>

<p>After all, they are in a good location,  good coach, decent FO, great owner, they should be able to snag some free agents before the decade is up</p>

      <label for="ldctjej" class="commentText"><p>Harden + role players is going to be better than PG +role players though, and their depth got way better than last year after the trade. PG is <strong>horrible</strong> at playmaking and his ISO game has been trash for years. The last 3 seasons he&rsquo;s at like 1.03, 0.91, and 0.83 points per iso posession, yet he was doing them more than spot up shooting where he is actually elite at lol. Harden has been like 20 to 30 points per 100 possesion better when he&rsquo;s on ball than PG and a ton of that is just his creation for others.</p>

<p>The only thing PG is <em>elite</em> at is his 3ball, and even that gets drastically worse the more he dribbles. His eFG% on 0 dribbles (catch and shoot) is like 30% higher than when he dribbles 3-6 times.</p>

<p>I think the coach has to be responsible for some of that, though.  The coaches pre Lue were less good that way.
Also,  who gets PG set up ? A point guard (clippers only had one with harden, maybe WB ) or kawhi who was himself missing games and mostly not setting up too many spot ups</p>

<p>In other words, a good coach/offensive system and ball handler can cause PG to change that</p>

He could have opt in and still the offer it&rsquo;s 2 years for 60. Of course nobody it&rsquo;s gonna restructure your last year of making 50 mil just to get one extra year for 10 mil extra. Him opting in it&rsquo;s pretty clear</p>

<p>Next year he could have gotten way more than 2 year for 60.</p>

<p>He presented the first deal as <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>60</sub>.  Didn&rsquo;t say anything about the opt in.  He also basically scoffed at that offer.  Then, everything after that, including what he signed in Philly, <em>required</em> the opt-out but he also never specified that either.</p>

<p>So I honestly don&rsquo;t know how you can say it was &ldquo;pretty clear&rdquo; in what he was saying, because the way he presented it was not clear.</p>

<p>Hence the difference between that and sixers it&rsquo;s that by next year in one contract he gets 2 year for 60 and the other it&rsquo;s 3 year for 150.</p>

<p>It was clearly a way below market value offer and a slap to the face to the player they saying they want to keep him til he retires.</p>

      <label for="ldf225v" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s a case of &lsquo;fair value&rsquo; vs &lsquo;market value&rsquo;. Comparative to other players&rsquo; contracts, $36m seems fair given his production, age, and games missed.</p>

<p>But he can get $50m on the free agent market, because there were teams (or 1 team at least) that was willing to overpay to get him.</p>

<p>Completely understandable that he would go for the latter option. If any of us got an offer to leave our current job and join a company offering almost 50% above our going rate, we&rsquo;d jump at it too.</p>

<p>Paul George explained like that too.</p>

<p>No he did not.  He never said anything about opting into his final year and getting the 60m on top of it.</p>

<p>Lowe brought up the point in his podcast that PG wasn&rsquo;t representing that offer entirely honestly. PG left out the opting in portion of that deal.</p>

<p>If PG had said that from the start, then there would be no reason for Lowe to bring it up on his podcast.</p>

<p>He has a player option, they are not doing him a favor. The deal was 2 year 60 over his own player option, that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>

<p>He could have played his last year and gotten way more.</p>

<p>By next year the difference with his new contract and that slap to the face would have been a 2 year 60 or 3 years 150 mil.</p>

<p>At the time of the trade, they thought they could contend with PG. That turned out to be wrong, but it wasn&rsquo;t unreasonable at the time.</p>

<p>An attempt not working out isn&rsquo;t the same as a bungle. It&rsquo;s the wrong decision in hindsight now that we have more evidence, but at the time of the trade they didn&rsquo;t have the same evidence.</p>

<p>Throwing money after sunk costs by paying PG $200M would be a bungle.</p>

      <label for="lddmt5n" class="commentText"><p>The trade worked well. There was a 35 game sample size of the clips being one of the best teams in the league. They looked pretty good against the mavs who just made the western conference finals. If they were healthy, maybe it&rsquo;s them that makes it. I know that&rsquo;s a big maybe going forward with an aging team but at least it&rsquo; something. Now they&rsquo;ll be fighting to stay out of the lottery, with no pick because they didn&rsquo;t want to give Paul a 4th year or 3 and a NTC? It&rsquo;s straight up mismanagement.</p>

<p>Yeah I was thinking about that too. The only way I think it makes sense is that they thought that PG was going to have a bad year. So they started low and figured they&rsquo;d work their way up when the year was over. If PG had a bad year, he might not get good offers, and he might be okay signing at a discount. Or they were thinking that, at this age in his career, PG would prefer the safety of a three year contract over a potentially risky one year contract. If PG got injured for example he would have been screwed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the Clippers, PG had a good year. Eventually, they were willing to offer him the same contract that Kawhi got. But they were only willing to do that if they kept their trade flexibility. They&rsquo;re probably honest that they don&rsquo;t <em>plan</em> on trading him. But if a situation arises where they feel they need to, they want to keep that option. It&rsquo;s nothing personal. This is a business. They know that. And PG knows it too.</p>

<p>Once they made their minds up to not offer a NTC or a fourth year, all they could really do is hope that no team would offer him a four year max. And that if they did, hope that PG would want to stay badly enough to turn it down. But a team did offer that to him and PG didn&rsquo;t want to stay that badly and took it.</p>

<p>Everyone walked away with what they wanted and no hard feeling so 5 years that just didn&rsquo;t work out in the end.</p>
