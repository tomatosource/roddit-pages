      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ec9iw8/how_have_lebron_kd_and_steph_modified_their_game/"><p>How have LeBron, KD, and Steph modified their game to remain effective as they get older?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>LeBron is 39 years old, KD is 35 years old, and Steph is 36 years old. All three made an All-NBA team this season averaging over 25 points per game each.</p>

<p>Though there has been a clear decline in athleticism, they have all still been able to compete as top 10 level players.</p>

<p>For KD and Steph specifically, people will say that KD and Steph’s game don’t really rely on athleticism, but I don’t think this is completely true. Durant prior to his Achilles injury in 2019 used to be one of the best prolific drivers in the league, especially during his early OKC days. Steph, on the other hand, runs a lot during the game to open himself up for shots.</p>

<p>What have these 3 future hall of famers done to allow them to age gracefully, while other superstars start to or have fell off by the time they hit their age?</p>

      <label for="leyezhi" class="commentText"><p>KD rarely gets to the rim since he tore his achilles, but has partially made up for it by improving his already unreal midrange percentages.</p>

<p>Curry has gotten stronger as he&rsquo;s aged and actually takes it to the rim more now. He&rsquo;s also a bit harder to hunt on defense now.</p>

<p>Lebron is much more&hellip; judicious about when he spends energy on defense, is more comfortable deferring to AD, and takes a lot more shots with better accuracy from just outside of the restricted area.</p>

<p>Not that he wasn’t a great finisher before, but Steph now has a plethora of gathers he can go to, turned his good floater into a great one, and an overall improved feel/awareness when near or inside the painted area.</p>

      <label for="leyf81e" class="commentText"><p>KD is still taking the ball to the rim, but he&rsquo;s starting more possessions inside the three point line. That&rsquo;s the main difference. He&rsquo;s driving less from the perimeter to the basket. His overall rim attempts have decreased but it&rsquo;s not as much as people think. But he does operate from midrange more now than ever.</p>

<p>Bron operates more from the mid/low post than ever before, he&rsquo;s more efficient from the mid/low post than ever before, and he&rsquo;s taking more spot-up 3&rsquo;s than ever before. His usage rate last season was nearing a career low yet his efficiency was around a career high so that tells you he&rsquo;s taking shots closer to the rim, less self-created shots&hellip;he&rsquo;s taking the most assisted shots since his rookie/sophomore season. Never since he became truly became LeBron&hellip;he&rsquo;s never taken this fewer self-created shots or had a usage below 30 since becoming LeBron LeBron. He&rsquo;s picking his spots, he&rsquo;s using his strength to his advantage, using craft more to his advantage, and he&rsquo;s still getting to the line&hellip;.highest FT rate since 2018 last year, but starting possessions closer to the rim.</p>

<p>His strength/first step makes him so tough to stop from the midpost and obviously in transition. He&rsquo;s still an elite transition guy and Lakers play in transition a lot, and have been one of the fastest pace teams. That&rsquo;s another big scoring play for him.</p>

      <label for="leymso4" class="commentText"><p>Steph added strength.</p>

<p>I mean, he really reached his apex when he bulked up, stopped relying so much on the 3, and started attacking the paint with regularity. He realized that the threat of the 3 allowed him to get a step on most anyone, and the added muscle prevented him getting bumped off his lane to the basket, so he started to control games by driving, not shooting 3&rsquo;s. If you re-watch the Finals vs the Celtics, you see him controlling the speed and the flow of the games with that ability.</p>

<p>Is that age related? IDK, but the muscle and ability to attack the basket consistently against stronger players was lacking when he was the unanimous MVP. He always had a handle, he always could attack the basket, but he could be pushed around on the drive with the defenders hips and weight in a way that isn&rsquo;t called.</p>

<p>Now, he&rsquo;s just stronger, and a bit slower as a consequence. </p>

Steph skews more towards off the ball two guard scoring vs spamming pick and roll which eats his stamina since he runs around so much. Kd is turned up his middie usage more and more as he’s gotten older. Hes like an athletic dirk now in that way. Still likes to iso off the dribble into his middies tho</p>

      <label for="lez8dpz" class="commentText"><p>KD is a true unicorn, in more ways than you might think.  He’s tall, long and an incredible shooter. But he shoots like no one is defending him.  If you’ve never played basketball, you wont understand how hard that is.  With his height, he can score until he can’t shoot anymore.</p>

<p>Steph has incredible endurance, and is the front runner for the greatest shooter of all time.  The endurance wont fully go away with age, nor will the shot.  He also has a great feel for the game.  He knows exactly how much space he needs to get a shot, and plays off the fact that he needs to be guarded at all times. Even 10ft outside the arc.  As said before, he’s improved his inside game. He takes that same thought process into “how much space do I need to make a floater”.</p>

<p>Lebron will be good as long as his body holds up. 6’9, 250+ massive vertical, great speed, can handle the ball, great court vision.  Better understanding of the game than 99% of players.  You ever play that older guy at pick up that can’t run as fast anymore, but is still a great player, can shoot, pass, play bully ball, and defend even if he’s 20 years older than everyone?  And seems to see the game better? That’s Lebron.  I can’t express enough how insanely good this guy is.  He could play in the NBA at 50 like that guy at pickup you call coach.</p>
