      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ec9iw8/how_have_lebron_kd_and_steph_modified_their_game/"><p>How have LeBron, KD, and Steph modified their game to remain effective as they get older?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>LeBron is 39 years old, KD is 35 years old, and Steph is 36 years old. All three made an All-NBA team this season averaging over 25 points per game each.</p>

<p>Though there has been a clear decline in athleticism, they have all still been able to compete as top 10 level players.</p>

<p>For KD and Steph specifically, people will say that KD and Steph‚Äôs game don‚Äôt really rely on athleticism, but I don‚Äôt think this is completely true. Durant prior to his Achilles injury in 2019 used to be one of the best prolific drivers in the league, especially during his early OKC days. Steph, on the other hand, runs a lot during the game to open himself up for shots.</p>

<p>What have these 3 future hall of famers done to allow them to age gracefully, while other superstars start to or have fell off by the time they hit their age?</p>

      <label for="leyezhi" class="commentText"><p>KD rarely gets to the rim since he tore his achilles, but has partially made up for it by improving his already unreal midrange percentages.</p>

<p>Curry has gotten stronger as he&rsquo;s aged and actually takes it to the rim more now. He&rsquo;s also a bit harder to hunt on defense now.</p>

<p>Lebron is much more&hellip; judicious about when he spends energy on defense, is more comfortable deferring to AD, and takes a lot more shots with better accuracy from just outside of the restricted area.</p>

The truth is Lebron and AD are still elite players. But the front office has absolutely butchered the roster since 2021 and haven‚Äôt been able to fully recover since.¬†</p>

<p>Jordan didn&rsquo;t benefit from the same things guys today are benefiting from, but the game wasn&rsquo;t the way it was in the mid-2000s. Zone defenses are probably a significant part of this.</p>

<p>For reference, teams averaged just a shade under 110 ppg in 86-87, compared to todays 114.2.</p>

<p>By comparison, teams in 2012 averaged fewer than 99 ppg. Pretty stark difference.</p>

That‚Äôs why I hate when people shit on his efficiency. He was slightly better than league average while taking the toughest shots of anyone probably ever in an era where spacing was shit and the paint was packed. I don‚Äôt like when people say older players would average 40-50 in today‚Äôs game. But I genuinely believe prime Kobe could definitely average that 35ppg but on way better efficiency than back then. Kobe with todays spacing and offense leaning officiating would be insane to watch.¬†</p>

The same story goes for distance traveled per minute. Yes he‚Äôs constantly moving off ball but he‚Äôs not driving as much as others and rests a lot on defense so it kind of evens out a bit. He still runs a shitload of course but it‚Äôs way overblown. He wasn‚Äôt the top runner per minute even in his absolute prime. It seems like ppl just believe anything they hear about Steph since he‚Äôs such a legend.</p>

      <label for="leyf81e" class="commentText"><p>KD is still taking the ball to the rim, but he&rsquo;s starting more possessions inside the three point line. That&rsquo;s the main difference. He&rsquo;s driving less from the perimeter to the basket. His overall rim attempts have decreased but it&rsquo;s not as much as people think. But he does operate from midrange more now than ever.</p>

<p>Bron operates more from the mid/low post than ever before, he&rsquo;s more efficient from the mid/low post than ever before, and he&rsquo;s taking more spot-up 3&rsquo;s than ever before. His usage rate last season was nearing a career low yet his efficiency was around a career high so that tells you he&rsquo;s taking shots closer to the rim, less self-created shots&hellip;he&rsquo;s taking the most assisted shots since his rookie/sophomore season. Never since he became truly became LeBron&hellip;he&rsquo;s never taken this fewer self-created shots or had a usage below 30 since becoming LeBron LeBron. He&rsquo;s picking his spots, he&rsquo;s using his strength to his advantage, using craft more to his advantage, and he&rsquo;s still getting to the line&hellip;.highest FT rate since 2018 last year, but starting possessions closer to the rim.</p>

<p>His strength/first step makes him so tough to stop from the midpost and obviously in transition. He&rsquo;s still an elite transition guy and Lakers play in transition a lot, and have been one of the fastest pace teams. That&rsquo;s another big scoring play for him.</p>

      <label for="lf0ohot" class="commentText"><p>Think with Steph it&rsquo;s more about personnel than individual. He played off the ball more last season and his rim attempts dropped. He had a similar usage rate to similar seasons but started more possessions off the ball, especially early in the year. He&rsquo;s lost some of his shake/quickness to separate and get to the rim as cleanly and with CP3/Podz you saw him playing more of a true off ball shooter role. Warriors fans often complain about that, and the numbers say that the Warriors offense tends to be better with the ball in Steph&rsquo;s hands.</p>

      <label for="leymso4" class="commentText"><p>Steph added strength.</p>

<p>I mean, he really reached his apex when he bulked up, stopped relying so much on the 3, and started attacking the paint with regularity. He realized that the threat of the 3 allowed him to get a step on most anyone, and the added muscle prevented him getting bumped off his lane to the basket, so he started to control games by driving, not shooting 3&rsquo;s. If you re-watch the Finals vs the Celtics, you see him controlling the speed and the flow of the games with that ability.</p>

<p>Is that age related? IDK, but the muscle and ability to attack the basket consistently against stronger players was lacking when he was the unanimous MVP. He always had a handle, he always could attack the basket, but he could be pushed around on the drive with the defenders hips and weight in a way that isn&rsquo;t called.</p>

<p>Now, he&rsquo;s just stronger, and a bit slower as a consequence.¬†</p>

<p>Durant moves like a 7ft guard so he‚Äôs unguardable and it‚Äôs easy for him to get to his spots. Even if he can‚Äôt attack the rim like the old days, he‚Äôs still an elite shooter that is unguardable.</p>

<p>Lebron was freakishly athletic in his prime and now he has regressed to just athletic af. He‚Äôs built like a tank so he‚Äôs unguardable when he puts his head down, and he‚Äôs also one of the best playmakers ever when doubled. He has become a better shooter especially from 3 so he has developed his game to have less holes.</p>

<p>Also players in general are just aging gracefully with modern science. Dudes that should be long gone are effective role players like Brook Lopez, Al Hartford, Chris Paul, Conley.</p>

      <label for="lezbc16" class="commentText"><p>LeBron, KD, and Steph have adapted their games with a focus on skill and basketball IQ, rather than relying solely on athleticism. This shift has allowed them to remain highly effective and productive despite their ages.</p>

      <label for="lf0f9dy" class="commentText"><p>First thing is that they care about their body. Steph&rsquo;s workouts are already legendary in their intensity. LeBron is the poster child of putting both money and maximum time to work on your body. And KD doesn&rsquo;t get enough credit for basically staying &ldquo;the same&rdquo;.</p>

<p>But speaking individually LeBron as a player really went far. He came into the League without a jumper (if he was shooting a jumper even when he got hot that was considered a bad shot for him, and good for the other team because you didn&rsquo;t need to double team him) through the years his jumper became automatic where if he gets hot he will stay hot unless you do something about that; he developed a post game. So he went from mainly a unstoppable driving machine to all around offensive machine. Where he can drive, shoot and go to the low post depending on the situation. Also, his BBIQ only got higher with age where he can recognize any mistake you do defensively and react instantly. Basically, his body is still at that level where it can keep up what his mind wants to do. Because like most retired players already have said &ldquo;You know when to retire when your mind knows where you have to be and what to do, but your body can&rsquo;t do that&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Steph and KD are more about working on their strengths (shooting and getting to their position) to perfection.</p>

      <label for="leznz74" class="commentText"><p>It is mostly rule changes and a change in defensive meta. No way they still remain this healthy and effective if they were subjected to more physically punishing fouls.</p>

<p>For all the shooting skills they may possess, they would be a shadow of their former selves if they get ankle and knee injuries.</p>

      <label for="lf0x7zi" class="commentText"><p>KD and Bron from 2014 if u spawned them today would both have 36ppg on 57% fg. Its insane how they were both some of the most athletic and physically dominant players ever( durant had an amazing drive and some cracked dunks too ans lebron was 280 in miami)
People think they stayed the same but really the offensive load got easier u got shooter on most teams now, unlike KD having ibaka as his best volume jumpshooter</p>

      <label for="lez8dpz" class="commentText"><p>KD is a true unicorn, in more ways than you might think.  He‚Äôs tall, long and an incredible shooter. But he shoots like no one is defending him.  If you‚Äôve never played basketball, you wont understand how hard that is.  With his height, he can score until he can‚Äôt shoot anymore.</p>

<p>Steph has incredible endurance, and is the front runner for the greatest shooter of all time.  The endurance wont fully go away with age, nor will the shot.  He also has a great feel for the game.  He knows exactly how much space he needs to get a shot, and plays off the fact that he needs to be guarded at all times. Even 10ft outside the arc.  As said before, he‚Äôs improved his inside game. He takes that same thought process into ‚Äúhow much space do I need to make a floater‚Äù.</p>

<p>Lebron will be good as long as his body holds up. 6‚Äô9, 250+ massive vertical, great speed, can handle the ball, great court vision.  Better understanding of the game than 99% of players.  You ever play that older guy at pick up that can‚Äôt run as fast anymore, but is still a great player, can shoot, pass, play bully ball, and defend even if he‚Äôs 20 years older than everyone?  And seems to see the game better? That‚Äôs Lebron.  I can‚Äôt express enough how insanely good this guy is.  He could play in the NBA at 50 like that guy at pickup you call coach.</p>

<p>In the 2030s, I bet Joker and Luka even at their 35-40 yrs old will still be top 10 level players. Or at least top 15</p>
