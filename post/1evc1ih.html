Was there any consideration to mass retire his jersey or do some sort of honor the way Bill Russell got?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Wilt has of course amassed a mythical reputation amongst the contemporary NBA due to his insane records and feats, and I imagine that mythology was even stronger in the 90s when he was still alive and could give interviews adding fuel to the fire.</p>

<p>He passed away relatively young, at the age of 63, about a month before the 1999-2000 season began. I&rsquo;m curious, when this happened, what was the general reaction like from the basketball community and fans? Did Stern ever consider doing some mass honor like retiring his jersey league-wide the way Bill Russell&rsquo;s was (note that I&rsquo;m not endorsing the idea, just asking).</p>

      <label for="liqzj8d" class="commentText"><p>I remember the media didn’t care for him. The media would always bring up Bill Russell whenever they’d mention Wilt. The sports media are for the most part, sports junkies and want the stars to love the game as much as they do. Wilt seemed like he did not care that much about basketball. He was an amazing athlete that just happened to make his living playing basketball. I had always heard he liked volleyball more than basketball. Also, Wilt in the 80’s and 90’s was like Shaq today, always complaining about the modern players and thinking they aren’t as good as he was.</p>

      <label for="lis252t" class="commentText"><p>Russell was often brought up when talking about Chamberlain and vice-versa because they were contemporaries who were great rivals in the same sport at the same position who often played big games against one another.  The two of them were also two of the best athletes in the sports world when sports television (and sports league national TV contracts) really came of age in the 1960s.</p>

<p>It’s like how Larry Bird is often brought up when talking about Magic Johnson and vice-versa but even more so.</p>

<p>It should be noted that Russell and Chamberlain were great friends who often spent time at each other’s houses prior to the games during their NBA careers, often playing with model trains, a mutual interest.  They became estranged when Russell criticized Chamberlain for not playing part of a game in the NBA Finals when Chamberlain was injured (and I believe unsuccessfully trying to get back in the game for part of his time out of the game) in either 1969 or 1970.  They did not talk for about 20 years until the late 1980s or early 1990s, then reconnected and became friends again until Chamberlain’s death in fall 1999.</p>

      <label for="lirw6jg" class="commentText"><p>With all due respect, this is your opinion, but I have no clue how you formed it. It is inaccurate in almost every conceivable way.</p>

<p>Shaq was extremely talented and comes across as a fun loving guy, but the moment his legacy is questioned he retreats into being a bully. Dwight and Bynum were both compared to Shaq early on, Bynum as the new Lakers Center with Kobe, and Dwight with the Superman nickname.</p>

<p>Shaq tried to downplay it by suggesting that the older guys like Wilt gave him a hard time so he thought that he had to pass that onto the younger generation. The reality is, Shaq knows that he didn’t give everything to the game (work ethic, fitness, free throws) and he lashes out when people question him. Just go back and watch the Inside the NBA clips…btw, I like Shaq</p>

But it wasn&rsquo;t news that everyone had access to in the palm of their hand.  Not to mention social media conditions responses to news, in the 90s I feel like a lot of things like this happen without much deep dive or societal reaction. The nature of social media these days means news like Bill will elicit an much bigger response.</p>

      <label for="liqhnk9" class="commentText"><p>I think some people are underselling the reaction to his death here. It was pre-social media so I think that&rsquo;s an unfair comparison to celebrity deaths these days.</p>

<p>He died at 63 which isn&rsquo;t super young, but he was always in excellent shape post retirement so it was certainly a shock. It was only 2 years after the NBA at 50 celebration so he was fresh in people&rsquo;s minds.</p>

<p>He was still one of the most famous athletes out there when he died. It was just a different time.</p>

I could be wrong I believe both bronny and shsreef had different heart condition, but both were caused by an enlarged heart. and according to some drew leaguendudes I know, if you went hs, national ranking d1/d2 college ball route, its  more than likely you know someone that has this condition.  Westbrook s childhood best friend, someone Westbrook played 2nd fiddle to all his life , 5 star, offers from every powerhouse since sophmore year, dropped dead in front of Westbrook after a pickup game his junior summer. Westbrook then decided to live for the both of them. 5&rdquo;8 120lb, 2 a days rest of summer, 430 training, then to his boys house to do whatever chores his bog isn&rsquo;t here to do. make breakfast, cut lawn, taken out trash etc. went back to training. by the end of summer he grew to 6&rdquo;3 140. still no offers besides a standford academic scholarship (wb had 3.9gpa and strong enough sat score for standford,lowest ever accepted 1503)   where he would have to be a walk on. also a wait list ucla offer few weeks before school ended.  if you were in LA in 2006. you knew 2 names, Kobe and farmar. everyone expected farmer to run it back, but he declared a little before the draft. they took Westbrook to play back up to farmers back up, nations rank 16 4 star recruit Darren Collison. then Collison got hurt and you know the rest. when people say this and that about Westbrook, he ball hogs, he only out here to get his. you damn right he&rsquo;s getting his, this dude  is will power personified. dude literally went from wasn&rsquo;t going to be shit, to the leagues mvp, sharing records big o and wilt, and now he&rsquo;s closer to being a billionsire than not (besides his Jordan brand deal, sam presti set him up with <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> businesses that nets a little under 40 a year).</p>

      <label for="lirg6v1" class="commentText"><p>Sure, but a lot of the people below that 72 mark are unhealthy for one reason or another and/or are poor and can&rsquo;t take care of their health as much. Not all, but a lot. So to see someone famous who is in great shape die of a heart attack at 63 stil feels rather early.</p>

<p>And looking at a baby and thinking about their chances of living to an age like 72 or 63 is one thing, but the average person who lives to 63 tends to live a lot longer than 63, so deaths still feel sudden. According to the SSA, a 63 year old has a 1.7% probability to die and is expected to live another 18+ years until about 81. But yeah, once you start hitting late 70s and 80s, death starts becoming a lot more expected and you&rsquo;re not expecting too many more years out of them. 63 is only twice the death probability of 53, though, which I would certainly say is a young age to die this days. Tragically young? No, but definitely still young to die, so I do think 63 is still somewhat young to die.</p>

      <label for="lisac12" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, the babies and kids who die really young impact the average.</p>

<p>If you aren&rsquo;t born with some chronic/terminal condition and can make it to adulthood, you&rsquo;re probably going to live longer than the &ldquo;average.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some of the main increases in average lifespan in modern times are because of reductions in child mortality. That plays a big role in determining the numbers. </p>

<p>In medieval times, for example, lots of infants died. But if you could make it to adulthood, it was fairly common to live into your 60s and 70s if not older. Now we also have better care for the elderly, so more and more people are living well into their 80s, 90s, or even 100.</p>

<p>Of course, it also depends on where you live and what your socio-economic circumstances are.</p>

But it was post dial up days and I clicked on something and a pop up ad showed up and I guess I minimized it but closed my window. I tried a few more times, and somehow ended up with shit tons of pop up ads in the background behind whatever I was trying to do. Then my dad jumps on the computer closes out Netscape or internet explorer. And Bam almost endless pop ups that were pushed to the background. Or pc had a virus that caused it. I don’t remember much aside from my dad muttering curse words that I had never heard before and pretty sure I haven’t heard since. I don’t even think most were in a language  known to man at any point in time.</p>

<p>And the whole quote IIRC was something like this - “it’s better to sleep with one woman 10,000 times than 10,000 different women - which I’ve done“ which if I had to guess the last line is what the published pushed to be in it! It says a lot about who he was and how lonely he felt.</p>

      <label for="liqv17f" class="commentText"><p>I think the likeability plays an aspect for sure though. Wilt was not well liked among his peers, contrast that to Russell who was not only great but pushed civil rights forward in the US, and was always accessible to any player who sought him out.</p>

<p>Also, difference between Wilt and Kareem, who was similarly abrasive, was that Kareem mellowed out after retirement and ended up becoming a prolific writer. So even though he wasn’t as accessible as Russell, we saw his thoughts through his newspaper columns and rare interviews.</p>

Thanks to ring culture (now leaking onto other sports especially through social media), you’re gonna see legends in their own leagues passing on and simply being ignored after their own deaths like Wilt was.</p>

      <label for="liqzlcn" class="commentText"><p>The death of Wilt Chamberlain in the fall of 1999 was more than a bit overshadowed by the death of all time great NFL running back Walter Payton two weeks later, who was only 45 at the time, and who was a much more popular, beloved athlete who had been watched by a lot more people in the 1970s than any basketball player prior to the popularization of the NBA in the 1980s.</p>

<p>Payton&rsquo;s health declined rapidly through 1999 from cancer and other ailments - he went on a sort of final appearance tour, he was very obviously and publicly very sick (I remember a seeing a picture of him with a caption explaining what jaundice was in a magazine), he threw out the first pitch at a Cubs&rsquo; game alongside Mike Ditka, worked with a writer on a very quickly written autobiography focused on his impending death. There were ceremonies in football stadiums across the country commemorating the death of Walter Payton, he had a big public funeral in the Bears&rsquo; stadium, and the Bears wore a patch with his number on it that season. None of that stuff happened for Wilt Chamberlain, who was famous and super-impressive, sure, and whose death was national news, but wasn&rsquo;t a beloved athlete on that level, at least not outside Philadelphia.</p>

<p>But also I don&rsquo;t think most people were even aware that Wilt Chamberlain was sick, whereas there was a lot of buildup for the death of Walter Payton. Wilt died kind of suddenly at least in the public eye, so there wasn&rsquo;t preparation for anything major either.</p>

It’s always interesting seeing how people define greatness. In all fairness it reminds me a lot of how people say Lebron is the greatest (his numbers are impressive with amazing longevity) compared to Jordan.</p>

<p>So I don’t know if you should eat crow but I will say wilt had a lot of hype, especially with those who actually saw him dominate the early NBA.</p>

<p>Chamberlain cared so much about personal stats over winning that he would essentially quit after he got 5 fouls because he didn&rsquo;t want to mar his record of not fouling out.</p>

<p>His teammates hated playing with him - the opposite is true of Russell.  I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s odd at all that Russell is considered the superior player.</p>

<p>He was a Republican who was close with Nixon and against many of the black movements of the day. He had a huge platform in his prime but in many ways was seen to have turned his back on the people and instead spent his time mythologizing his own legend with the 20,000 women etc.</p>

      <label for="liqpkoo" class="commentText"><p>Wilt was really hated by a lot of NBA fans at the time.  Throughout the 90s he went on hate tours and mainly liked to shit on current players including MJ. He was obnoxious and loved himself to exhaustion. It was a pure juxtaposition to Bill Russell who was pure class and loved hanging out with young players and teaching them.</p>

<p>I remember he was in crazy shape post career and every year the league held a legends game where past players played an exhibition game. He never once came to play to promote the game. He did show up for the top 50 in an All Star game.</p>

<p>His death was post the 1999 lockout year which I remember was pure shit of a season. Especially with MJ finally gone. The only 2 things I loved about 1999 was Vince Carter and Rookie Jason Williams who I swore would be a superstar in the league (peaked early). I do remember it was mentioned a lot. But I think it was during the off season.</p>

Then, watch some videos of his amazing offensive skills. The man had five or six killer offensive moves besides the dunk. Post play is pathetic in the current NBA.</p>

      <label for="lirsh27" class="commentText"><p>You gotta remember that most people saw Wilt as an amazing athlete, but also as a ball hog and stat stuffer. It was pretty universal to think of Bill Russell as the much better player because he kept right on winning even as his teammates changed - Bill&rsquo;s the only one who was there for all of those championships when they dominated the 60&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>So, Wilt&rsquo;s stats and athleticism were treated almost like a novelty because Bill Russell&rsquo;s Celtics even won the title when they didn&rsquo;t have a top 10 scorer.</p>

<p>The rules have been changed so much, that it&rsquo;d be hard to see that kind of thing happen again because all the changes favor the offense.</p>

      <label for="liqcx41" class="commentText"><p>Wilt is the undisputed most dominant player of all time*. Gretzky, Ruth, Wilt so far out-performed their peers there is no else in their circle. Wilt outplayed Russell in their H2H matchups, it’s not even close, but Russell had the benefit of playing with 4 HOFers and has the rings.</p>

<p>*GOAT is a different argument and is generally accepted as MJ.</p>

<p>Edit: every downvote proves the lack of education around Wilt’s dominance.</p>

<p>To add to your point Russ actually played with 12 hall of famers: Carl Braun, Bob Cousy, John Havlicek, Tom Heinsohn, Bailey Howell, K.C. Jones, Sam Jones, Clyde Lovellette, Andy Phillip, Frank Ramsey, Arnie Risen, and Bill Sharman.</p>

<p>It was almost exclusively before free agency so 12 is an understatement as he played with many of these players for half of his career or more.</p>
