Was there any consideration to mass retire his jersey or do some sort of honor the way Bill Russell got?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Wilt has of course amassed a mythical reputation amongst the contemporary NBA due to his insane records and feats, and I imagine that mythology was even stronger in the 90s when he was still alive and could give interviews adding fuel to the fire.</p>

<p>He passed away relatively young, at the age of 63, about a month before the 1999-2000 season began. I&rsquo;m curious, when this happened, what was the general reaction like from the basketball community and fans? Did Stern ever consider doing some mass honor like retiring his jersey league-wide the way Bill Russell&rsquo;s was (note that I&rsquo;m not endorsing the idea, just asking).</p>

      <label for="liqeq33" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s more just the technology of today. Back then it certainly was news. But it wasn&rsquo;t news that everyone had access to in the palm of their hand.  Not to mention social media conditions responses to news, in the 90s I feel like a lot of things like this happen without much deep dive or societal reaction. The nature of social media these days means news like Bill will elicit an much bigger response.</p>

<p>Not in a bad way either, just highlighting the cultural difference between then and now</p>

<p>At that time in the NBA i don&rsquo;t remember any athlete who died of natural cause where it was a league wide thing.  Basketball is a young sport. The all timers were mostly alive when Wilt died. If he died today it would be a huge deal</p>

Thanks to ring culture (now leaking onto other sports especially through social media), you’re gonna see legends in their own leagues passing on and simply being ignored after their own deaths like Wilt was.</p>

<p>He died at 63 which isn&rsquo;t super young, but he was always in excellent shape post retirement so it was certainly a shock. It was only 2 years after the NBA at 50 celebration so he was fresh in people&rsquo;s minds.</p>

<p>He was still one of the most famous athletes out there when he died. It was just a different time.</p>

      <label for="liqcx41" class="commentText"><p>Wilt is the undisputed most dominant player of all time*. Gretzky, Ruth, Wilt so far out-performed their peers there is no else in their circle. Wilt outplayed Russell in their H2H matchups, it’s not even close, but Russell had the benefit of playing with 4 HOFers and has the rings.</p>

<p>*GOAT is a different argument and is generally accepted as MJ.</p>

<p>To add to your point Russ actually played with 12 hall of famers: Carl Braun, Bob Cousy, John Havlicek, Tom Heinsohn, Bailey Howell, K.C. Jones, Sam Jones, Clyde Lovellette, Andy Phillip, Frank Ramsey, Arnie Risen, and Bill Sharman.</p>

<p>It was almost exclusively before free agency so 12 is an understatement as he played with many of these players for half of his career or more.</p>
