Was there any consideration to mass retire his jersey or do some sort of honor the way Bill Russell got?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Wilt has of course amassed a mythical reputation amongst the contemporary NBA due to his insane records and feats, and I imagine that mythology was even stronger in the 90s when he was still alive and could give interviews adding fuel to the fire.</p>

<p>He passed away relatively young, at the age of 63, about a month before the 1999-2000 season began. I&rsquo;m curious, when this happened, what was the general reaction like from the basketball community and fans? Did Stern ever consider doing some mass honor like retiring his jersey league-wide the way Bill Russell&rsquo;s was (note that I&rsquo;m not endorsing the idea, just asking).</p>

      <label for="liqzj8d" class="commentText"><p>I remember the media didn’t care for him. The media would always bring up Bill Russell whenever they’d mention Wilt. The sports media are for the most part, sports junkies and want the stars to love the game as much as they do. Wilt seemed like he did not care that much about basketball. He was an amazing athlete that just happened to make his living playing basketball. I had always heard he liked volleyball more than basketball. Also, Wilt in the 80’s and 90’s was like Shaq today, always complaining about the modern players and thinking they aren’t as good as he was.</p>

      <label for="liqeq33" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s more just the technology of today. Back then it certainly was news. But it wasn&rsquo;t news that everyone had access to in the palm of their hand.  Not to mention social media conditions responses to news, in the 90s I feel like a lot of things like this happen without much deep dive or societal reaction. The nature of social media these days means news like Bill will elicit an much bigger response.</p>

<p>Not in a bad way either, just highlighting the cultural difference between then and now</p>

<p>He died at 63 which isn&rsquo;t super young, but he was always in excellent shape post retirement so it was certainly a shock. It was only 2 years after the NBA at 50 celebration so he was fresh in people&rsquo;s minds.</p>

<p>He was still one of the most famous athletes out there when he died. It was just a different time.</p>

      <label for="lir16n4" class="commentText"><p>I remember doing something on the computer when I was younger like 9-11ish that tbh I have absolutely no clue what I was trying to do or if it was even my fault. But it was post dial up days and I clicked on something and a pop up ad showed up and I guess I minimized it but closed my window. I tried a few more times, and somehow ended up with shit tons of pop up ads in the background behind whatever I was trying to do. Then my dad jumps on the computer closes out Netscape or internet explorer. And Bam almost endless pop ups that were pushed to the background. Or pc had a virus that caused it. I don’t remember much aside from my dad muttering curse words that I had never heard before and pretty sure I haven’t heard since. I don’t even think most were in a language  known to man at any point in time.</p>

<p>And the whole quote IIRC was something like this - “it’s better to sleep with one woman 10,000 times than 10,000 different women - which I’ve done“ which if I had to guess the last line is what the published pushed to be in it! It says a lot about who he was and how lonely he felt.</p>

<p>At that time in the NBA i don&rsquo;t remember any athlete who died of natural cause where it was a league wide thing.  Basketball is a young sport. The all timers were mostly alive when Wilt died. If he died today it would be a huge deal</p>

      <label for="liqv17f" class="commentText"><p>I think the likeability plays an aspect for sure though. Wilt was not well liked among his peers, contrast that to Russell who was not only great but pushed civil rights forward in the US, and was always accessible to any player who sought him out.</p>

<p>Also, difference between Wilt and Kareem, who was similarly abrasive, was that Kareem mellowed out after retirement and ended up becoming a prolific writer. So even though he wasn’t as accessible as Russell, we saw his thoughts through his newspaper columns and rare interviews.</p>

Thanks to ring culture (now leaking onto other sports especially through social media), you’re gonna see legends in their own leagues passing on and simply being ignored after their own deaths like Wilt was.</p>

      <label for="liqv2nl" class="commentText"><p>I’m old. I distinctly remember people having debates in the office about MJ vs wilt even after second three peat. It’s always interesting seeing how people define greatness. In all fairness it reminds me a lot of how people say Lebron is the greatest (his numbers are impressive with amazing longevity) compared to Jordan.</p>

<p>So I don’t know if you should eat crow but I will say wilt had a lot of hype, especially with those who actually saw him dominate the early NBA.</p>

There would be a lot of greatest NBA players lists on the internet, and Jordan and Russell were always 1 and 2 with them swapping places on different lists. The people who put Russell first would always lean on his 11 championships for justification.</p>

      <label for="liqpkoo" class="commentText"><p>Wilt was really hated by a lot of NBA fans at the time.  Throughout the 90s he went on hate tours and mainly liked to shit on current players including MJ. He was obnoxious and loved himself to exhaustion. It was a pure juxtaposition to Bill Russell who was pure class and loved hanging out with young players and teaching them.</p>

<p>I remember he was in crazy shape post career and every year the league held a legends game where past players played an exhibition game. He never once came to play to promote the game. He did show up for the top 50 in an All Star game.</p>

<p>His death was post the 1999 lockout year which I remember was pure shit of a season. Especially with MJ finally gone. The only 2 things I loved about 1999 was Vince Carter and Rookie Jason Williams who I swore would be a superstar in the league (peaked early). I do remember it was mentioned a lot. But I think it was during the off season.</p>

      <label for="liqzlcn" class="commentText"><p>The death of Wilt Chamberlain in the fall of 1999 was more than a bit overshadowed by the death of all time great NFL running back Walter Payton two weeks later, who was only 45 at the time, and who was a much more popular, beloved athlete who had been watched by a lot more people in the 1970s than any basketball player prior to the popularization of the NBA in the 1980s.</p>

<p>Payton&rsquo;s health declined rapidly through 1999 from cancer and other ailments - he went on a sort of final appearance tour, he was very obviously and publicly very sick (I remember a seeing a picture of him with a caption explaining what jaundice was in a magazine), he threw out the first pitch at a Cubs&rsquo; game alongside Mike Ditka, worked with a writer on a very quickly written autobiography focused on his impending death. There were ceremonies in football stadiums across the country commemorating the death of Walter Payton, he had a big public funeral in the Bears&rsquo; stadium, and the Bears wore a patch with his number on it that season. None of that stuff happened for Wilt Chamberlain, who was famous and super-impressive, sure, and whose death was national news, but wasn&rsquo;t a beloved athlete on that level, at least not outside Philadelphia.</p>

<p>But also I don&rsquo;t think most people were even aware that Wilt Chamberlain was sick, whereas there was a lot of buildup for the death of Walter Payton. Wilt died kind of suddenly at least in the public eye, so there wasn&rsquo;t preparation for anything major either.</p>

      <label for="liqcx41" class="commentText"><p>Wilt is the undisputed most dominant player of all time*. Gretzky, Ruth, Wilt so far out-performed their peers there is no else in their circle. Wilt outplayed Russell in their H2H matchups, it’s not even close, but Russell had the benefit of playing with 4 HOFers and has the rings.</p>

<p>*GOAT is a different argument and is generally accepted as MJ.</p>

<p>Edit: every downvote proves the lack of education around Wilt’s dominance.</p>

<p>To add to your point Russ actually played with 12 hall of famers: Carl Braun, Bob Cousy, John Havlicek, Tom Heinsohn, Bailey Howell, K.C. Jones, Sam Jones, Clyde Lovellette, Andy Phillip, Frank Ramsey, Arnie Risen, and Bill Sharman.</p>

<p>It was almost exclusively before free agency so 12 is an understatement as he played with many of these players for half of his career or more.</p>
