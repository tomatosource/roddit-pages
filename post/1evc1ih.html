      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1evc1ih/1990s_nba_fans_what_was_the_general_reaction_when/"><p>1990s NBA Fans, what was the general reaction when Wilt Chamberlain died? Was there any consideration to mass retire his jersey or do some sort of honor the way Bill Russell got?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Wilt has of course amassed a mythical reputation amongst the contemporary NBA due to his insane records and feats, and I imagine that mythology was even stronger in the 90s when he was still alive and could give interviews adding fuel to the fire.</p>

<p>He passed away relatively young, at the age of 63, about a month before the 1999-2000 season began. I&rsquo;m curious, when this happened, what was the general reaction like from the basketball community and fans? Did Stern ever consider doing some mass honor like retiring his jersey league-wide the way Bill Russell&rsquo;s was (note that I&rsquo;m not endorsing the idea, just asking).</p>

      <label for="liqeq33" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s more just the technology of today. Back then it certainly was news. But it wasn&rsquo;t news that everyone had access to in the palm of their hand.  Not to mention social media conditions responses to news, in the 90s I feel like a lot of things like this happen without much deep dive or societal reaction. The nature of social media these days means news like Bill will elicit an much bigger response.</p>

<p>Not in a bad way either, just highlighting the cultural difference between then and now</p>

<p>The point still stands that Wilt&rsquo;s death was covered in way more media outlets than just a blurb on NBA.com. That&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>

<p>He died at 63 which isn&rsquo;t super young, but he was always in excellent shape post retirement so it was certainly a shock. It was only 2 years after the NBA at 50 celebration so he was fresh in people&rsquo;s minds.</p>

<p>He was still one of the most famous athletes out there when he died. It was just a different time.</p>

<p>And the whole quote IIRC was something like this - “it’s better to sleep with one woman 10,000 times than 10,000 different women - which I’ve done“ which if I had to guess the last line is what the published pushed to be in it! It says a lot about who he was and how lonely he felt.</p>

<p>At that time in the NBA i don&rsquo;t remember any athlete who died of natural cause where it was a league wide thing.  Basketball is a young sport. The all timers were mostly alive when Wilt died. If he died today it would be a huge deal</p>

Thanks to ring culture (now leaking onto other sports especially through social media), you’re gonna see legends in their own leagues passing on and simply being ignored after their own deaths like Wilt was.</p>

      <label for="liqkhck" class="commentText"><p>It was definitely covered in all news outlets. I don&rsquo;t remember a rush of fanfare but ESPN, ABC, Fox, CBS, and NBC all covered it on all of their news programs but it was a totally different world back in the late 90s. There were only 100 cable channels as opposed to the 1000 of today not to mention all of the countless streaming apps, countless podcasters and YT stuff of today that didn&rsquo;t exist back then. Smartphones and instant information in your pocket didn&rsquo;t exist so there was no big rush to be first at all costs like Shams. Today everyone is looking to put out content by any means. It wasn&rsquo;t like that back then. If he would have died today, it would have been a lot more fanfare. Also, sports in general weren&rsquo;t as big as they are today. Jordan expanded the NBA and made it bigger than it ever was back then but it&rsquo;s much bigger today and you have to remember, Wilt played from 1958-1973. The average sports fan was different back then. It was mostly kids (and the parents of those kids), nerds, geeks, hanger on&rsquo;ers , die hards and people who were looked at as losers cause they couldn&rsquo;t play but would watch grown men play a game and then talk about it(journalists). It was well before big money hit the NBA or any sports. You have to remember. In the 50s, 60s,  70s and even early 80s, a lot of NFL players had second jobs in the off-season to survive, probably the same for NBA players. Totally different back in the late &lsquo;90s but even more different back in the &lsquo;50s, &lsquo;60s and &lsquo;70s.</p>

      <label for="liqpkoo" class="commentText"><p>Wilt was really hated by a lot of NBA fans at the time.  Throughout the 90s he went on hate tours and mainly liked to shit on current players including MJ. He was obnoxious and loved himself to exhaustion. It was a pure juxtaposition to Bill Russell who was pure class and loved hanging out with young players and teaching them.</p>

<p>I remember he was in crazy shape post career and every year the league held a legends game where past players played an exhibition game. He never once came to play to promote the game. He did show up for the top 50 in an All Star game.</p>

<p>His death was post the 1999 lockout year which I remember was pure shit of a season. Especially with MJ finally gone. The only 2 things I loved about 1999 was Vince Carter and Rookie Jason Williams who I swore would be a superstar in the league (peaked early). I do remember it was mentioned a lot. But I think it was during the off season.</p>

I do remember the media mentioning he liked sleeping with tons of women though.</p>

<p>Before we got sucked into these never-ending all-time ranking discussions, which gave his basketball legacy renewed relevance, the legend of his sexual exploits was his most enduring legacy.</p>

      <label for="liqcx41" class="commentText"><p>Wilt is the undisputed most dominant player of all time*. Gretzky, Ruth, Wilt so far out-performed their peers there is no else in their circle. Wilt outplayed Russell in their H2H matchups, it’s not even close, but Russell had the benefit of playing with 4 HOFers and has the rings.</p>

<p>*GOAT is a different argument and is generally accepted as MJ.</p>

<p>Edit: every downvote proves the lack of education around Wilt’s dominance.</p>

<p>To add to your point Russ actually played with 12 hall of famers: Carl Braun, Bob Cousy, John Havlicek, Tom Heinsohn, Bailey Howell, K.C. Jones, Sam Jones, Clyde Lovellette, Andy Phillip, Frank Ramsey, Arnie Risen, and Bill Sharman.</p>

<p>It was almost exclusively before free agency so 12 is an understatement as he played with many of these players for half of his career or more.</p>
