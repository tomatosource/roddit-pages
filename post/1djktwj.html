      <label for="l9bhajt" class="commentText"><p>He seems like a great fit on paper, my biggest concern is if he wants to be the 3rd option again and focus more on defense. He left a very good Nuggets team to join a much worse Detroit team, just so he could take more shots and be &ldquo;the star&rdquo; instead of role player. And he also seems like a downgrade from DJJ as a PoA defender.</p>

<p>Well that, and his contract isn&rsquo;t really good.</p>

He&rsquo;s a guy that shows up, plays hard, and doesn&rsquo;t make mistakes. There has never been a whiff of drama around guys like Dame, Nurk, Anfernee, Scoot and Ayton being higher up the pecking order. He carries out his role and nails his shots. Dude is a professional.</p>

      <label for="l9bozyl" class="commentText"><p>I have heard this from Portland fans before, that&rsquo;s why I do think he would be good on the Msvs.</p>

<p>But he DID leave a contending Nuggets team to join a bad Pistons team mainly because he wanted to be a bigger part of the offense, I think that&rsquo;s pretty clear. So at least a little bit of concern is justified.</p>

<p>As a Portland fan, what do you think his value is? I&rsquo;ve seen everything from Blazer fans wanting to just dump him to get rid of the contract and prioritise the development of younger players, to fans insisting that he is worth at minimum 2 FRPs.</p>

      <label for="l9bqfax" class="commentText"><p>We heard a lot about that when there were rumors about Portland targeting him, and when we received him, mainly from salty Nuggets fans. That never matched the reality we saw in Portland.</p>

<p>I think he provides a lot of value to the right team (and honestly Dallas seems like a great fit for him, maybe the best), but it is also true that Portland wants to clear salary and prioritize developing the next generation. Grant has been terrific for us but he no longer fits our timeline or our priorities.</p>

<p>I would not send him out in a pure salary dump. Absolutely not. But I also don&rsquo;t think we need to exact full value from him. I think getting back a solid first or a promising young player ought to be enough.</p>

<p>Weirdly I have always felt like he should be a Maverick. I can just see him in the blue jerseys and it feels right. I dunno what it is. It&rsquo;s just meant to be. I would be happy for him to be on a winning team, and I&rsquo;d be happy for us to be worse this season and hopefully get a star player in next year&rsquo;s draft.</p>

      <label for="l9brx6j" class="commentText"><p>That sounds great. How is his point of attack defense? If we got him it would be to replace DJJ, who was mostly used to defend the opposing point guards. Can he guard 1-3 or 1-4, or should he mostly be defending SFs and PFs?</p>

<p>As far as trade packages go, I think most Mavs fans would be comfortable sending out our 2025 FRP and possibly a 2nd/swap or 2 + matching salary, but not sure if we would want to send much more than that.</p>

      <label for="l9bw3hf" class="commentText"><p>His help defense is much more &ldquo;desirable&rdquo; than his POA defense. But I think that largely has to do with the personel we&rsquo;ve surrounded him with.</p>

<p>For almost his entire tenure here his starting lineup is 3 non-defender guards and a big who is average at post-defense. He&rsquo;s had to both be one of our main POA defenders and biggest help presence which is way too much for him.</p>

<p>I think with PJ and Gaff or PJ and Lively there would be enough size to let him roam or over-commit without knowing that if he fails its a guaranteed layup.</p>

<p>I think his 3 level scoring ability is a bit underrated, he obviously had a huge green light in both Portland and Detroit but his catch and shoot ability is elite, he can get to the line well, and he has a decent mid range. If you can get him to avoid the tunnel vision a bit when he has the rock, he&rsquo;s probably the highest upside creator available at the wing for the cheapest price this off season.</p>

I wouldn&rsquo;t ask him to be a primary defender of guards. He could do an okay job with it, but I assume you guys are wanting better than just okay.</p>

<p>If that&rsquo;s an unprotected 2025 it could get it done. Unlikely but could hit like the Warriors did this year.</p>

<p>So this sounds exactly like the role PJ Washington is playing for us.</p>

<p>This would be an issue for us then, if both PJ and Grant are &ldquo;only ok&rdquo; and playing next to Luka and Kyrie who also aren&rsquo;t gonna be chasing guards around the perimeter all game. I think Grant would still help us, since we also need a 3rd option and a guy that can reliably hit threes, but we&rsquo;d still need to address POA defense if DJJ walks in free agency.</p>

<p>Yeah it would be an unprotected 2025 FRP + THJ expiring (16M) + probably Maxi (22M/2 years) or Powell (<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>) to match Jerami&rsquo;s contract. Then some 2nds or swaps if needed.</p>

<p>I think we would take Thybulle for a reasonable price, yes. We tried to sign him last summer and I think he would still fit on our roster, especially if we fail to re-sign DJJ.</p>

      <label for="l9c35or" class="commentText"><p>I think the Nuggets were at least pretty close to matching Detroit’s offer. The difference I think is that Jerami wanted an opportunity to showcase his ability in a bigger role, probably in part to set up his next contract. Probably a smart move - I’m not sure he gets the bag that Portland just gave him if he stayed in Denver.</p>

      <label for="l9cxn8z" class="commentText"><p>True - Weaver in particular, and also Casey and Detroit itself were definitely factors. Portland is pretty damn white though and that didn’t stop him from signing there, so I don’t think it’s like a non-negotiable for him though.</p>

<p>Agreed. Grant&rsquo;s defensive skill set overlaps with PJ, a do-it-all wing on defense. It seems a bit redundant to have them start together. Although, Grant is a better offensive player.</p>

      <label for="l9bttuy" class="commentText"><p>Yeah the idea is that we really need a 3rd scoring option, after these playoffs showed that when Luka/Kyrie are having bad games or getting doubled constantly, no one else is able to score. And we also had issues with our role players missing open threes, since neither DJJ or PJ are really great 3 point shooters.</p>

<p>Jerami Grant would fix both of those issues, but we would have a new issue if neither Grant nor PJ can defend guards well, since you don&rsquo;t want Luka or Kyrie defending them either.</p>

<p>Dallas has 2 tradeable 1sts&hellip;. Nowhere did I suggest a swap for THJ lol.</p>

<p>But the idea of getting a pick with lottery upside or a &ldquo;legit young prospect&rdquo; seems completely far fetched given Grant&rsquo;s massive salary. Unless it&rsquo;s a late lottery pick in this year&rsquo;s bad draft and then Portland is taking back really bad long term salary. I could potentially see that.</p>

      <label for="l9cgldv" class="commentText"><p>The problem w a Dallas pick is it’s going to be 22-30 selection so it has little value. It’s a glorified second.  Pistons fans have been floating grant and #14 for #5 and filler.  Something like that has way more value than a late Dallas first and some buster.  I just don’t see Dallas having what Portland is looking for.</p>

<p>Also as Zach Lowe stated recently the Grant contract isn’t that bad.  It’s overblown. The amount of years is the bigger problem imo. That said they anticipate the cap increasing 10% each year w new tv deal so that deal will look better every year.  We have no reason to just gift him to a contender because he fits there.</p>

      <label for="l9ckiyk" class="commentText"><p>If Dallas is willing to include no protections, the 2031 pick would have strong value. But if the Detroit front office decides to make that kind of move, Portland should jump on it. Seems like a desperation trade that doesn&rsquo;t do anything to meaningfully increase their ceiling. But then again, the gap in talent between the 5th pick and the 14th in this draft may not be significant.</p>

<p>Edit: another factor in Grant’s value is his health. He’s missed a lot of time over the last several seasons.</p>

We simply don’t have the roster spots for all 4 draft picks and guys under contract. A consolidation trade or 2 are coming.  Personally I’d like to see Brogdon, Ant and Grant all gone by next season but not for scraps. Brogdon should be highest priority this summer.</p>

      <label for="l9boxne" class="commentText"><p>If you add a generational talent and don’t win anymore games, it begs the question as to “why”. I don’t think there’s anyone on the Spurs that would crack the Celtics top 6 besides Wemby. I think they’ve done a poor job of drafting, they don’t spend money on FA or acquire talent in trades. I expect they’ll make one decent move this offseason and declare it enough then win 30 games or something in 24-25.</p>

<p>You say no one could crack the top 6 on the Celtics but then wonder why they don’t make trades. With what assets? There’s not exactly a line of people waiting for their chance at Jeremy Sochan</p>

People always say we never had big acquisitions but when did we have the space for one? We finally got the space and we signed the second biggest free agent of the year after LeBron in Aldridge who is a bigger free agent than most teams have ever gotten. Clearly if a team is good, a lot of players don&rsquo;t care much about where they are.</p>

      <label for="l9bru5k" class="commentText"><p>Our team&rsquo;s oldest player that matters is Keldon who&rsquo;s younger than Tatum. It&rsquo;s no surprise that our team doesn&rsquo;t have as good players as the best regular season team in the league that won a championship. And Vassell is better than Horford, he just plays a different position.</p>

<p>People knock our drafting and while it hasn&rsquo;t been great recently it hasn&rsquo;t been bad either. We had picks 9, 20, 25 in 2022. 12 in 2021. 11 in 2020. 19 and 29 in 2019. 18 in 2018. 29 in 2017. 29 in 2016. So we picked in the late lottery 3 times before we drafted Wemby. It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;ve had incredible draft position until 2023.</p>

<p>We drafted Derrick White, Dejounte Murray, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell, and Jeremy Sochan with those picks. That&rsquo;s way better than most teams would&rsquo;ve done picking at those positions. On top of that, we drafted Tre Jones in the second round in 2020</p>

<p>If the goal was &ldquo;win or bust&rdquo; then yes, it was shitty. But it clearly wasn&rsquo;t and the Spurs have positioned themselves to acquire the talent necessary to succeed going forward.</p>

<p>Again I&rsquo;m not saying they would win a championship, or even make the finals. And yeah, it&rsquo;s totally possible they miss the playoffs althogether (as it is possible for any team any year if they get hit with injuries or bad chemistry). IMO though, they could absolutely put together a team that looks scary on paper.</p>

      <label for="l9bpwaa" class="commentText"><p>There&rsquo;s been two &lsquo;surprises&rsquo; about Wemby. One is that he&rsquo;s been so good you can actually rely on him to contend as the franchise star in his second year, something extremely rare these days. Second is I don&rsquo;t even see Wemby as the kind of guy who WANTS to be patient as the team tanks to build around him. That&rsquo;s a double-edged sword for SA, but it&rsquo;s also the reason he&rsquo;s gone from potential man to future GOAT over the course of his rookie year for me. </p>

<p>I think they may have a year still that they can tank with Wemby, but it&rsquo;s one year before he starts getting impatient, and the sooner they can start winning the better. I don&rsquo;t think they should shell out for the first star they can get, but they need a plan. Trae is ofc the best option, he&rsquo;s not Luka or possibly even Hali or Brunson at this point, but he&rsquo;s still elite and a the exact kind of player they need to synergies with Wemby. Aside from that, I think they just need to be patient with the rest of the cast, opportunities will arise if they are patient. There&rsquo;s wayyy too many overpaid role players on contending teams, and the Celtics have proven that doesn&rsquo;t have to be the case, that you don&rsquo;t have to sacrifice star power for depth.</p>

      <label for="l9c6r1a" class="commentText"><p>Clippers and Milwaukee should be considered legitimate contenders.</p>

<p>Phoenix has a depth and injury concerns. They also only have a season with this core to build off of.</p>

<p>Lakers roster around their two stars isn&rsquo;t great.</p>

<p>Indiana might not seem like it, but let&rsquo;s not completely write off a team that just made the conference finals with their best player not being 100%.</p>

<p>Part of the issue for Pat is our team construction, system, and top 3 players. He&rsquo;s also gotta be more aggressive when open. He&rsquo;s been yelled at for his lack of aggression.</p>

<p>Vooch + DeMar limit your spacing, driving lanes, and ability to have a modern offense.</p>

<p>Zach hasn&rsquo;t been healthy and isn&rsquo;t the most willing passer and can get caught up trying to do too much.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;d thrive in OKC though. The spacing would allow him to get so many open looks. Plus he&rsquo;s not going to be expected to do too much on offense</p>

I understood your comment as dismissive because the article talks about players like porzingis and holiday, which obviously aren’t under the reader guys, but thought the previous comment made sense because of the focus of the rest of the article.

      <label for="l9be9xt" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m really high on Isaiah Stewart. Defensively he can guard the perimeter, body bigger centers, rebounds well, and is decent enough at protecting the paint. Offensively, he can at least space the floor, even if he isn&rsquo;t the greatest finisher or rim runner. Wendell Carter Jr is a better one, but both I like. Stewart more for coming off the bench and Carter Jr. more for starting.</p>

<p>They both feel more like modern bigs where they can give you the ability to be a 5-out team, while maintaining a strong enough presence in the paint defensively and on the boards.</p>

Him making 3s at an efficient rate is good of course, but he doesn’t help pull defense out of the paint to open the lane up for people to drive/cut. Other teams treat him like a non shooter</p>

In a system that puts a high value on 3&rsquo;s and empowers everyone to take them all the time, then I think his shooting would actually turn into floor spacing. Pistons were 27th in 3 point attempts and should really lean into it more imo.</p>

<p>Obviously we didn’t acquiesce to dame’s insane demands that he tried holding us too, but Cronin still sent him to an amazing situation in MIL with a literal top 15 player oat in his prime.</p>

<p>With Jrue, Cronin asked him for a list of teams he’d like to be traded to, and he only worked with those teams. Literally hung up the phone on other teams that asked.</p>

<p>Brogdon, Simons, Grant, get ready to get traded to somewhere good for your career.</p>

<p>See, stars? It’s cool to play for Portland cause you’ll get traded wherever you want after. So come on downnnn</p>

<p>Could not agree more. Just feels right and I would be excited to root for them on their new teams while we continue the rebuild.</p>

Maybe Isaac but he&rsquo;s also pretty important and after you got Robert Williams who is always injured idk why you would want another injury hazard.  You don&rsquo;t need Black or Jett because off Scoot and Simons.  So like Cole Anthony, Joe Ingles and 3 firsts is the best we can offer and idk if that&rsquo;s good enough frankly</p>

      <label for="l9c5o4m" class="commentText"><p>I really like Deni Avdija as a good Derrick White comp. Both guys early in their careers were good defenders with a solid all-around game, but weren’t flashy scorers and had a questionable outside shot. White played 5 seasons in San Antonio and got a bargain rookie extension before moving to Boston where his 3pt shot drastically improved and he broke out. Avdija just finished his 4th season in Washington, had a career high 3P%, and is about to start a ridiculous value rookie extension of $12mil/yr for 4 years. Probably the best value contract in the league.</p>

<p>Avdija would be the perfect 3rd/4th option on a true contender. Problem is that I see no reason for the Wizards to move him</p>

      <label for="l9cdce1" class="commentText"><p>People who think that a team is a “role player” away are so funny to me because they drastically underrate the impact of shooting variance for non-stars.</p>

<p>If Caleb Martin / pj Washington is having a good shooting series they are basically as valuable as a low-mid tier star like a Jaylen brown or a jdub (in a few years because he’s never going to be a top 10 guy).</p>

<p>A top tier role player like Derrick white, Malcom brogdon, or Marcus smart is not going to save you there, which is why smart got moved for a t15 guy a month later (I wish they kept him because he was my guy but clips didn’t want hogdon).</p>

<p>If teams like the thunder want to win they should purchase actual star players like kristaps porzingis so that they can weather a lucky shooting night. Lauri is calling.</p>

      <label for="l9d095f" class="commentText"><p>There are 24 all stars, maybe 5-6 guys who don’t make the team but could with better health or a bigger fanbase (call it 30 stars total).</p>

<p>Jaylen brown is in the 15-25 range in the league so yeah he’s a low-mid tier star. Make him a number 1 like in game 7 vs Miami last year and you’ll see what it looks like. Make a guy closer to 10 like Mitchell, Booker, or Irving the number 1 and we probably take that game.</p>

<p>+/- stats regularly have him behind Tatum and porzingis (some years were exceptions for kristaps) in terms of our teams 3 stars.</p>
