<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it&rdquo; in response to this tweet from Kyle Kuzma 10 months ago:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>USA basketball better get some nba stars that know how to play a role. Anybody can be nice with the ball in their hands but can you be cool with defending and going to the corner for a few possessions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Devin Booker has been executing his role with the same dedication as he demonstrated during his tenure at Kentucky. It&rsquo;s nice seeing prominent stars willing to buy-in as a role player. Whether you think he should be starting or not, it is understandable why Steve Kerr would choose to include him in the starting line-up.</p>

      <label for="lfgparv" class="commentText"><p>Not really. Spain has one of the biggest followings of basketball in Europe for instance, and one of their best teams Barcelona share an arena with the handball team. It’s probably the 4-5 most followed sport in most European countries. Africa has a few countries where is maybe in the top 3, but football reigns supreme there. South America it’s fairly big but is still behind football, baseball etc. pretty much everywhere but America it’s kind of a niche sport.</p>

<p>I guess my point was that yes it’s played and has a global presence, but it isn’t really an important sport anywhere outside 3-4 countries.</p>

<p>As a country, it’s absolutely top 3, just pointing out that that’s a flawed criteria for a country to take a sport seriously. US women’s soccer took gold in 4 of 5 straight Olympics and silver in the 5th, is dominating right now, and nobody would argue soccer is a bigger sport in the US than…almost any other country.</p>

And even then it&rsquo;s just media, no actual basketball schools in Slovenia, no above average pro clubs outside Olimpija who managed to win a whooping 1 game in EuroCup last season plus you aren&rsquo;t going to see any kids dribble a basketball outside.</p>

<p>Source: lived for 2 decades in and have family in Slovenia and Serbia</p>

<p>By Mediterranean I assume you mean Spain? ACB league is very strong but football reigns supreme there. If basketball is 2nd there it&rsquo;s a very distant 2nd. I also lived in Italy and outside Bologna nobody gives two shits about basketball. Portugal even less so.</p>

      <label for="lfghnjb" class="commentText"><p>Someone pointed out that Devin Booker wasn&rsquo;t a highly touted player basically his entire life and he spent A LOT of time as just a role player before breaking out into NBA superstar status. It&rsquo;s much easier for someone like him who has the experience of just being a rotation guy to go back to doing just that. Sometimes a little bit of humility growing up pays dividends.</p>

<p>In Kentucky they basically played two starting 5’s and that’s why Booker came off the bench.</p>

<p>Booker was a budding star literally from his first season like Cade or Ant or Lamelo. He was 4th in ROY, went to the All Star weekend and was being handed the keys right from his rookie season.</p>

<p>he was never treated as a role player - he was very quickly the top dog on the team.</p>

Obviously the &ldquo;Booker does nothing&rdquo; takes take it the extreme, but there were times during exhibition games when he would pass out of a good shot that got generated, now you&rsquo;re looking at an iso at the top of the key because there&rsquo;s 10 on the shot clock and the team doesn&rsquo;t have the synergy as a group for secondary actions. Being too unselfish can be a problem with US Olympic teams. It was a great sign when he fired away early on vs Serbia</p>

      <label for="lfgzy24" class="commentText"><p>Not sure why Dwade got so much hate as a commentator, both of the two provided good insight and made it entertaining. Dwade typically isn’t that great I get it, but his takes this time were respectful to both teams, fair, and still fun with a little bit of jest like “go somewhere else” when Lebron was getting posted on. </p>

<p>I bring him for one comment he made about Dbook, about him buying in and doing his role. I believe it’s incredibly tough to play the roles of Jrue, Dbook, and White, who need to make the right play at the right time, whether that’s passing to your designated scorers/superstars on a semi-open look early on the shot clock vs taking the green light at discretion; we saw that a lot with Jrue and Dbook just letting it fly. Sure you want to listen to the gameplan and get it to KD or Steph, but it’s crucial to keep the defense honest and contribute to the offensive load.</p>

<p>I used to not like Dbook early on, punchable face, diva, etc, but once those workout videos came out you could tell this guy was a through and through professional who took his job very seriously. Even through the “we’re not doubling in open gym” debacle and his shortcomings in the eyes of haters and fans, it became clearer and clearer that this guy is someone you want on your team.</p>

<p>It’s tough getting up 20 shots a game with his kind of play, it takes a lot of your legs away and a ton of mental fortitude. I completely get why players like him, Kobe, and Dame would ball-watch and play less than stellar defense, and don’t even bring up Kobe’s 1st team defense awards, I know as well as any 30 year Laker fan that Kobe was often lazy enough to have it be a critique. Sure when he wanted to he would lock any of the opponent’s best player down, and in the playoffs his team defensive iq was a major factor alongside Dfish and Ariza/Artest/Gasol, but it’s just not doable 100%, which is why him and MJ were such demons.</p>

<p>I love how Dbook has joined the team and earned a starting role, my starting lineup was Steph, Jrue, KD, Lebron, and Embiid, but it’s been Steph, Jrue, Dbook instead, with Dbook starting over Jrue a fair amount. He has played screens and switches extremely well, been a pest on ball, and spaces the floor like a vet, all alongside his ice cold jumper. Huge statement by him, and the Suns are gonna seriously improve from this Olympic run.</p>
