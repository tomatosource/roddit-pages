<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it&rdquo; in response to this tweet from Kyle Kuzma 10 months ago:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>USA basketball better get some nba stars that know how to play a role. Anybody can be nice with the ball in their hands but can you be cool with defending and going to the corner for a few possessions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Devin Booker has been executing his role with the same dedication as he demonstrated during his tenure at Kentucky. It&rsquo;s nice seeing prominent stars willing to buy-in as a role player. Whether you think he should be starting or not, it is understandable why Steve Kerr would choose to include him in the starting line-up.</p>

<p>Football would not be the global number 1 sport with a bullet if Brazil won every World Cup. Part of why international football is so great is the relative parity between the teams in the tiers and the relative closeness (compared to basketball) between the tiers.</p>

<p>Basketball&rsquo;s future as a top level international sport relies on other countries getting close to the US</p>

      <label for="lfgparv" class="commentText"><p>Not really. Spain has one of the biggest followings of basketball in Europe for instance, and one of their best teams Barcelona share an arena with the handball team. It’s probably the 4-5 most followed sport in most European countries. Africa has a few countries where is maybe in the top 3, but football reigns supreme there. South America it’s fairly big but is still behind football, baseball etc. pretty much everywhere but America it’s kind of a niche sport.</p>

<p>I guess my point was that yes it’s played and has a global presence, but it isn’t really an important sport anywhere outside 3-4 countries.</p>

<p>As a country, it’s absolutely top 3, just pointing out that that’s a flawed criteria for a country to take a sport seriously. US women’s soccer took gold in 4 of 5 straight Olympics and silver in the 5th, is dominating right now, and nobody would argue soccer is a bigger sport in the US than…almost any other country.</p>

<p>In 1992, when we faced 9 NBA players over the course of the entire run, your point made sense.  Nowadays where we face over 60 NBA players, and there is a good argument that we don&rsquo;t have any of the top 4 players in the Olympics, it&rsquo;s a lot harder to blow everyone out.  Winning on depth is not something we&rsquo;ve had to do until now.</p>

<p>Fair but you would have the 5th to maybe 10th or 11th best going off the top of my head. Like Derrick White is the worst player on the squad and he&rsquo;s all defence. He would be second or third best player at worst on basically every other olympic squad. Everyone else is multi-time all star at minimum, multiple all defence, multiple all nba (many first team) and multipe MVP winners. USA depth is mind boggling. Sure its closer nowadays but USA should still be outclassing teams comfortably.</p>

<p>if you took the roster of the 2023 German national team and the roster of 2023 Team USA and placed both into the NBA for a full season, Team USA would be title favorites and Germany would be a lottery team.</p>

<p>the issue isn&rsquo;t roster strength - the issue is experience playing together coupled with variability of single elimination tournaments.</p>

      <label for="lfihl05" class="commentText"><p>I do think we still need to overwhelm teams to a certain degree with our athleticism defensively and overall talent to overcome the chemistry deficit we always suffer from in these settings. So when we brought a lot
some one way guys, bigs who couldn’t dominate as rim protectors and guard 1-5, didn’t bring a dominant two way wing. I do think the roster strength wasn’t there. Like having Jaylen brown a Devin booker was missing, to add more two way juice to Ant and mikal .  We needed bam as well. We just had a lot of holes defensively that were easy to exploit. Jaren really struggled at the 5 and we couldn’t guard anyone</p>

      <label for="lfi1nwi" class="commentText"><p>i think kd did carry but i also think it was by design. the adjustment pop made was for team usa to play like a team built around KD. we got less dame minutes, more Draymond and jrue minutes with everyone playing like elite 3 and D guys besides tatum who got to be 6 man. so yea kd did carry, but in a way guys arent getting credited by sacrificing for the sake of making chemistry easier. book, lavine, middleton played like they were trevor ariza on the lakers. it was fun to watch them make everything fit. Jrue took the role he ended up playin on the celtics this past year. draymond and bam dominated defensively, it turned into a really fun team to watch and even when they went down 15 against australia they all didnt go hero ball and stuck to the gameplan</p>

<p>In Kentucky they basically played two starting 5’s and that’s why Booker came off the bench.</p>

<p>Look no doubt no one expected him to be a supermax player who scored 70 etc but he legit played for Kentucky and was a 5 star prospect</p>

<p>I think the complaints that the Suns made it about Book getting points is completely justified.  I also think there should more criticism of his teammates that played absolutely no defense and let the Celtics easily keep the lead instead of creating pressure and using the momentum of Booker&rsquo;s offensive play to make it a real game.</p>

<p>Booker was otherworldly that night and it gets shit on because the other 4 guys on the court stood around watching instead of trying to win the game.  That sucks.</p>

It was a blowout for most of the game, but then was a single digit game with like three minutes left. The Suns actually won the second half of that game by 13 points. The Suns were obviously just going to Booker every single time to see how many he could score, but that approach was also by far their best chance to win.</p>

<p>Booker was a budding star literally from his first season like Cade or Ant or Lamelo. He was 4th in ROY, went to the All Star weekend and was being handed the keys right from his rookie season.</p>

<p>he was never treated as a role player - he was very quickly the top dog on the team.</p>

<p>That said, his defense yesterday was awesome! At one point I was just watching his screen navigation cheering him on. Loved him being a pest for 92 feet and pressing Serbia&rsquo;s guards back out to half court after icing a screen, etc. Dude was locked in, it was dope.</p>

<p>Props to him for buying tf in to his role on this team! He was huge yesterday even though his box score didn&rsquo;t show it.</p>

Booker is great on defense in this and the last Olympics but average when he’s the first option. Mikal was DPOY level before he went to the Nets. And Jrue couldn’t play a lick of offense in the playoffs when he was basically the second option and primary facilitator.</p>

He averages 27 but I don’t think I have ever seen him score 27</p>

<p>He is either shooting 90% from the field or 30% and it goes quarter by quarter, but when he is on he might be the best offensive player in the league</p>

<p>Like, during that 2020 run he was doing everything on offense for the team.. Chris Paul was doing it in bunches, but he was pretty damn banged up in that playoff run</p>

      <label for="lfiks2q" class="commentText"><p>Agreed. I also thought &ndash; and this is probably a result of his playing for Team USA before &ndash; that he got himself into the FIBA-style defensive mode (much more ball pressure/fouling allowed) earlier than anyone else, and kind of led by example for Ant, Jrue, and even Steph.</p>

<p>In their first couple of exhibitions, you could see the USA players, particular the guards, playing too much NBA-style hands-off defense on ball handlers and cutters, but Booker was really up on the offensive players, using his hands, impeding motion, jabbing at the ball, and all the other things that are much more allowed in FIBA. Ant adjusted really soon after Book, and then the other guards, too &ndash; it was like it took them a few quarters to remember what the FIBA whistle is like.</p>

Obviously the &ldquo;Booker does nothing&rdquo; takes take it the extreme, but there were times during exhibition games when he would pass out of a good shot that got generated, now you&rsquo;re looking at an iso at the top of the key because there&rsquo;s 10 on the shot clock and the team doesn&rsquo;t have the synergy as a group for secondary actions. Being too unselfish can be a problem with US Olympic teams. It was a great sign when he fired away early on vs Serbia</p>

      <label for="lfgzy24" class="commentText"><p>Not sure why Dwade got so much hate as a commentator, both of the two provided good insight and made it entertaining. Dwade typically isn’t that great I get it, but his takes this time were respectful to both teams, fair, and still fun with a little bit of jest like “go somewhere else” when Lebron was getting posted on. </p>

<p>I bring him for one comment he made about Dbook, about him buying in and doing his role. I believe it’s incredibly tough to play the roles of Jrue, Dbook, and White, who need to make the right play at the right time, whether that’s passing to your designated scorers/superstars on a semi-open look early on the shot clock vs taking the green light at discretion; we saw that a lot with Jrue and Dbook just letting it fly. Sure you want to listen to the gameplan and get it to KD or Steph, but it’s crucial to keep the defense honest and contribute to the offensive load.</p>

<p>I used to not like Dbook early on, punchable face, diva, etc, but once those workout videos came out you could tell this guy was a through and through professional who took his job very seriously. Even through the “we’re not doubling in open gym” debacle and his shortcomings in the eyes of haters and fans, it became clearer and clearer that this guy is someone you want on your team.</p>

<p>It’s tough getting up 20 shots a game with his kind of play, it takes a lot of your legs away and a ton of mental fortitude. I completely get why players like him, Kobe, and Dame would ball-watch and play less than stellar defense, and don’t even bring up Kobe’s 1st team defense awards, I know as well as any 30 year Laker fan that Kobe was often lazy enough to have it be a critique. Sure when he wanted to he would lock any of the opponent’s best player down, and in the playoffs his team defensive iq was a major factor alongside Dfish and Ariza/Artest/Gasol, but it’s just not doable 100%, which is why him and MJ were such demons.</p>

<p>I love how Dbook has joined the team and earned a starting role, my starting lineup was Steph, Jrue, KD, Lebron, and Embiid, but it’s been Steph, Jrue, Dbook instead, with Dbook starting over Jrue a fair amount. He has played screens and switches extremely well, been a pest on ball, and spaces the floor like a vet, all alongside his ice cold jumper. Huge statement by him, and the Suns are gonna seriously improve from this Olympic run.</p>

<p>Seems like the standard for color commentators is just too subjective, which obviously makes sense. But in yesterday’s game he wasn’t bad by any means.</p>

I think it’s hard for most players who are normally a big feature on their team to get a groove as a role player but I think he’s done great. I think AD has been pretty good, he’s just like being a roll guy and playing great defense. I think embiid has been solid seeing great screens to get other guys scoring, his defense has been pretty good but his communication has been a little lacking. I think he needs to make his offensive reads a bit quicker though, he’s still used to holding, making a move and then shooting. He can’t be his normal self out there, gotta take catch and shoot, and gotta pass as the double team is getting there.</p>
