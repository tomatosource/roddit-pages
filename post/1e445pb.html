<p>I feel like there’s more to this story. To take <span class="math inline">\(113m less: That is a complete NBA contract. If I told you “So-and-so signed a \)</span>113m contract for 5 years,” you’d say “Wow, that’s an excellent deal.”</p>

<p>It is the number one topic of conversation here in Summer League: What is not being said here? Behind the scenes, what is happening?</p>

<p>There’s another element to this that isn’t immediately apparent: Jalen Brunson is represented by Sam Rose, son of Knicks President of Basketball Operations Leon Rose.</p>

<p>You can convince me there are players who say “you know what? I don’t care about the money. I have more than enough money for me and my family. I’ll take less if you guys can build a championship roster around me.” In a regular situation, ask any player to take $113m less and they say “okay”. Who’s the first person who will tell them “You are out of your damn mind”? His agent.</p>

<p>The agent is the one who usually says “absolutely not”, but in this case, the agent is the son of the man who they are negotiating against. You cannot tell there isn’t some element of a conflict of interest in that.</p>

      <label for="ldd5gne" class="commentText"><p>A pretty good case can be made that this was a reasonable move by Brunson from a purely selfish / financial perspective, without even considering the Knicks&rsquo; cap situation side of things.</p>

<p><strong>1. Insurance.</strong> By locking in a 4-year bag <em>now</em>, Brunson ensures he gets a big payday even if he sustains a career-ending injury this season.</p>

<p>The flip side is that now he&rsquo;ll have to wait until 2028 to get his mega-payday contract, instead of waiting until 2025. But it&rsquo;s still entirely reasonable to go for the sure thing now, and bet on yourself for the huge contract a few years down the line, rather than bet on yourself for the huge contract next summer without any kind of cushion in case disaster strikes.</p>

<p>Like, think of it in terms of your own life. Suppose someone comes and says I&rsquo;ll give you <span class="math inline">\(156M right now, or if you wait until next year I'll give you \)</span>269M. But there&rsquo;s a chance I won&rsquo;t give you anything at all next year if some conditions fail to get met. (For Brunson that condition is being physically able to play at an elite level, but for a normal person it could be any condition that you only have partial control over and which there&rsquo;s a small but non-zero chance it could fail.) Which one are you taking? I&rsquo;m taking the guaranteed $156M with no hesitation and never looking back.</p>

<p><strong>2. Cap spikes.</strong> Given how much the cap is going to jump in the next few years, Brunson can quickly make up the $37M he left on the table.</p>

<p>The exact final difference really depends on the exact option you choose for his alternative route&ndash; for instance, waiting until next summer he could sign a 4 instead of 5 year deal to be able to opt out earlier, but obviously that subtracts a year of guaranteed income in case of injury.</p>

<p>But the point is that there&rsquo;s a huge payday coming up for him that he gets to cash in on earlier with his current contract, which potentially makes up for a big chunk of what he&rsquo;s sacrificing now, if not outright exceeding it.</p>

<p>So, basically, he&rsquo;s taking the sure thing right now, with a great chance of making up for some or all of the difference on the back end of his career. It&rsquo;s <strong>not</strong> a crazy, indefensible decision even from a purely selfish POV. It makes a lot of sense. The fact that it helps the Knicks build their roster in the meantime could be seen as just icing on the cake for Brunson.</p>

<p>I love this from Brunson for 3 reasons</p>

<ol>
<li>He took the most stable money he can right now. He had to wait to get the fifth year and the contract is based off his current one.</li>
<li>He set himself up to maximize his future money. The 4 year gets him back into the market a year earlier and he’s betting on himself being eligible for the supermax.</li>
<li>His agent is clearly controlling the narrative. Everything he did makes sense. But instead of explaining why. They’re just saying he’s a team player helping out his team and gave up 115 million. That number is competed made up especially considering he will almost guaranteed be paid more than the current 5th value in 4 years unless his body completely self destructs.  It’s just amazing to see how they’ve managed to control the medias way of reporting this.</li>

<p>Once they&rsquo;re both re-signed, we can give Brunson a huge max, which will recoup most of the 113mil lost over that contract&rsquo;s 5 years (but not all of it)</p>

<p>Just 1 year ago, he was a good player, but nobody would have thought he was worth a super max contract. A lot happened this past season to increase his value. But just like we saw in IT, especially for an undersized guard, your value can drop very quickly.</p>

<p>Even if there is a good chance he makes most of it back later, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good decision to take that big of a cut unless he&rsquo;s comfortable with the possibility he won&rsquo;t ever see that money.</p>

      <label for="ldd5y4h" class="commentText"><p>T-wolves mistake was putting it down in writing, but it’s still against the rules regardless. Probably going to be next to impossible to prove if it’s a handshake deal though. Especially since it’s an extension in an ideal situation that can easily be spun into a price cut to keep the team competitive.</p>

<p>Seeing who the personnel involved in this deal are makes it pretty difficult to pretend it isn’t at least a bit shady. And if anything is discovered the Knicks should definitely face consequences. But the reality is that these backroom hand shake deals happen all the time. If we are going to be honest, the real reason the Wolves were punished so hard is probably because they were stupid in doing it so blatantly that it made the league look bad.</p>

<p>Not saying this is the only reason Brunson would sign this contract - I absolutely cannot see the agent not negotiating harder here if they were an unbiased party. But getting paid now is always safer than being paid later when you&rsquo;re small.</p>

      <label for="lddbjxa" class="commentText"><p>Even then, there is no way the Knicks offered him a contract that low in value (relative to his worth) and said “well you might get injured” &amp; Brunson said “hm yeah good point.” That offer would be straight-up insulting to every other max player in the league, the point where the Knicks would have to have actively not wanted Brunson to re-sign. Brunson would have to have zero confidence in himself and his health to take that contract on first offer after already coming off a bargain deal to begin with.</p>

<p>This all leads me to believe something else is happening, or that Brunson said “I want to be here forever and I want it locked down asap, I’ll do what it takes” and this is what the Knicks came up with. The latter is more likely but the former is more entertaining for me personally.</p>

<p>bc the Mavs let that contract expire, Brunson was no longer eligible for the 7-9 year of service 35% supermax (has to be with the team that drafted you, or traded for you while you were still on your rookie deal/1st 4 seasons in the league).</p>

<p>he can only get the 35% cap max once he hits 10 years of service</p>

<p>Key point here. Part of this is that, even if he has a catastrophic injury, he can bank on the Knicks signing him for a deal to make him whole. Which points to the conflict, but from a purely money point of view, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s really risking anything here</p>

<p>The players’ union surely has questions about this. Is it good practice to sacrifice money for owners and their teams?

<p>Because that’s the reasoning I’ve heard again and again for why the 2nd apron doesn’t actually suck for players.</p>

<p>Like is this just about star players vs role players? Star players taking less means other star players feel pressure to take less money and leave it for the other guys?</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks to everyone who responded and especially u/stonecutter7 and u/junkit33 for clearing this up for me.</p>

<p>In addition to luxury tax not being included as profit in the split, the <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> split isn’t <em>actually</em> <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> - players’ share can range between 48-52%.</p>

<p>In theory, Brunson taking less would mean one of two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Players salaries are less than 50% of profits for the year so everyone gets a bonus or</li>
<li>Player salaries still exceed 50% of all profits but not by as much as they would’ve so the money in escrow all players lose is less</li>
</ol>

<p>But I’m hearing that it might be on a team by team basis vs league wide? And something to do with the salary cap too? This might all be going over my head to be honest with you</p>

<p>Not sure what decides the exact % players get but if higher player salary means the least players can get is 52% vs 48% of all nba profits, that’s a huge difference that I can understand a union being concerned about</p>

The 2% difference you bring up is a small factor that the players union doesn’t care about. Just google around, its the same answer every time, players undercutting their value hurts other players on an individual basis, nobody cares about the total overall share until CBA time</p>

      <label for="ldcfg05" class="commentText"><p>But if those guys sign for less doesn’t that just mean more players get money?</p>

<p>Because my understanding is that when player salaries don’t add up to half the profit, every single player gets a cut of that extra money.</p>

<p>So from an “every man for himself” perspective, I understand why players might not like the idea that they personally could be pressured to take less than they’re worth.</p>

<p>But a union is theoretically concerned about players as a whole and feels like the majority of players would actually benefit from guys taking large enough pay cuts since they would essentially get a bonus</p>

I could be wrong. But the NBPA has always been more concerned about individual salary as multiple craters to that process could see an overall salary trend downwards.</p>

<p>I personally don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s realistic, and this is more of a one off that I&rsquo;m 100% okay with. But the NBPA has real issues with individual players taking less than they are worth because that level of effect could theoretically affect dudes at all levels.

      <label for="ldcuo4h" class="commentText"><p>Completely missing the point. Lots of players may think that, nothing wrong with a player thinking that.</p>

<p>It never manifests in reality because any agent worth their salt will throw everything at the player to stop him from doing this. It is existentially critical for agents to get their players on the biggest contracts they can.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s how things should be, just describing how they are in actuality.</p>

<p>That the only time we see this kind of decision actually happen is in a situation where the agent is the son of the GM is&hellip; notable.</p>

<p>Is it necessary a bad thing? IDK. But it&rsquo;s odd.</p>

If I was making 100s of millions of dollars, I&rsquo;d hope that I&rsquo;d do the exact same thing Brunson is doing. Fuck trying to create some kind of conspiracy.</p>

<p>Even as a Mavs fan, I&rsquo;m over the situation and potential tampering. Him leaving and him leaving money on the table makes sense to me.</p>

Guys who can already project to be worth half a billion dollars by the end of their careers are going to take what to them is a minor but sizeable haircut for a gross amount that seems insane to us because being on a more competitive team in a fun environment with players they like playing with is more important than yet further millions.

And if the knicks win a title or 2 in the next few years and he continues playing at a top 10 player in the world level,  he will make it back and then some on his next contract. Plus all the extra incentives, both monetarily and just in general, of becoming an all time new Yorks sports legend. He&rsquo;s potentially setting himself up even better, and he&rsquo;s helping his team get better in the mean time. It&rsquo;s a win win. He&rsquo;s taking a small gamble, yeah, but we could look back on this as being a genius move. Time will tell. Anyone who is hating on this move either doesn&rsquo;t fully understand the situation, or they&rsquo;re just being haters</p>

<p>But does anyone think that will happen ? The dad (gm) will tell them of the repercussions. Free agents not trusting the team, future clients of his son not going there. Brunson will be fine and get paid next contract regardless.</p>

<p>On a side note, it always amazes me how insular the nba is. Father/son gm,coaches,staff members etc. I get wanting to follow your fathers footsteps but it really is a hard path to get into for non related people.</p>

      <label for="ldcrii5" class="commentText"><p>The fact that he said there was a conflict of interest with the agent being Leon’s son as tho that would impact brunsons decision is wild. Brunson has an agent but in the end he decides his own contract, and he knew the 2 possibilities. Everyone can speculate if he is getting more under the table as it is objectively a suspect situation w his dad working for the org, but to accuse this w no proof is just dickriding and hater behavior it/until an investigation is done.</p>

<p>Also, do we rly think the Knicks would do something like giving money under the table when the situation is so suspect, like what. You think a team would break the rules when these relationships r so clear and obvious to the public. Maybe Brunson is aware 250 mil +(what he’s made already including this full new contract) is already general wealth</p>

      <label for="ldcs60b" class="commentText"><p>Gotta love the greediness and stupidity being shown around the league here. Brunson chose to take his max extension this year instead of next year to give the organization flexibility to build a championship team. No one put a gun to his head and told him to do it. Instead of applauding his sacrifice for what it is, people around the league are trying to justify why he wasn&rsquo;t greedy like them and take the money. From agent malpractice, to is he stupid, to he must be under some spell to think this was a great idea, when are people going to realize isn&rsquo;t wasn&rsquo;t about the money, and not everyone thinks like they do.</p>

That&rsquo;s 113 milluon less than Brunson could have taken NEXT year  over 5 years not 4 so there&rsquo;s a whole other year that&rsquo;s getting factored in and now Brunson can opt back out after 3 years on the new deal and get a supermax ( 35 percent of the cap) all NBA  deal for players with 10 years of service that starts at like 70 million per and goes up.</p>

<p>There were injury risks THIS year with waiting  that now he doesn&rsquo;t have to worry about at all because his deal is locked in and he can opt out sooner and he&rsquo;s playing with his best friends from college.</p>

<p>Jalen Brunson is not stupid, he knows what he&rsquo;s doing and if the team that you liked was signing someone like the Knicks signed Brunson you&rsquo;d be talking about building him  a statue outseide the arena for being selfless.</p>

<p>Some of you people are acting like Dolan handed Brunson a bunch of wampum and some sea shells and Brunson signed on the dotted line.</p>

      <label for="ldcuq9a" class="commentText"><p>Love Jalen Brunson, but he knows he&rsquo;s an undersized guard that relies on his shiftiness to score, his footwork is everything. Not surprising whatsoever if he just wanted to lock down some guaranteed money ASAP just in case some freak injury occurs. I get the Knicks would probably throw the bag at him regardless, but the way he carries himself it makes me think he understands how special his situation is and wants to make sure he gets his money.</p>

<p>Everyone always laughs at people &ldquo;fumbling the bag&rdquo; but then when someone does the opposite, some of you are like &ldquo;?????? this makes no sense&rdquo;.</p>

He’s looking to be alternative and he’s kind of a phony about it.</p>

<p>Also, there are bigger contracts coming (higher BRI) up after this contract is up and he’s estimated to make a similar amount of money. And as the undisputed King of New York at the moment, any decent agent can make up a large portion of the difference in money.  </p>

<p> But to re-iterate: Amin sucks now and just works angles for takes that fewer and fewer people respect but more and more are listening. </p>

      <label for="ldcxf07" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s understandable other teams are looking at what went down here with a raised eyebrow if for nothing else, the Knicks have put themselves in position to at least be a legitimate darkhorse title threat and a more difficult team to defeat with the road map to be that good for years to come. When your competition improves that way and does so and remains under the second apron than of course there will be chatter.</p>

<p>For agents, of course they&rsquo;re going to be thinking about their own players and their own future FA decisions and potential precedent which could impact negotiations for them going forward, although I presume that&rsquo;s unlikely. I don&rsquo;t think players care too much, frankly. The suits do. The players in suits for the union do. Your average players I doubt does.</p>

The contract he would sign next year is for an extra year and that’s where the bulk of the difference comes from. In reality, he has foregone a much more reasonable 37 million over the 3 years of his extension.</p>

<p>That’s still a lot but by the time this contract is up, he’ll be able to sign a much larger extension than he would have been able to next year because of how much the cap will increase over the next 4 years. He certainly did a solid to the Knicks that gives them flexibility going forward, but he did not give up 110+ million.</p>

      <label for="ldccd38" class="commentText"><p>I personally would start taking huge paycuts to stay in my preferred city after making my first 100 million, but I think for rich players, they hang alot with people who are even more rich than them (Celebrities, etc.) and it exposes to them to the different levels of wealth that normal people like me aren&rsquo;t aware of.</p>
