<p>I feel like there’s more to this story. To take <span class="math inline">\(113m less: That is a complete NBA contract. If I told you “So-and-so signed a \)</span>113m contract for 5 years,” you’d say “Wow, that’s an excellent deal.”</p>

<p>It is the number one topic of conversation here in Summer League: What is not being said here? Behind the scenes, what is happening?</p>

<p>There’s another element to this that isn’t immediately apparent: Jalen Brunson is represented by Sam Rose, son of Knicks President of Basketball Operations Leon Rose.</p>

<p>You can convince me there are players who say “you know what? I don’t care about the money. I have more than enough money for me and my family. I’ll take less if you guys can build a championship roster around me.” In a regular situation, ask any player to take $113m less and they say “okay”. Who’s the first person who will tell them “You are out of your damn mind”? His agent.</p>

<p>The agent is the one who usually says “absolutely not”, but in this case, the agent is the son of the man who they are negotiating against. You cannot tell there isn’t some element of a conflict of interest in that.</p>

      <label for="ldcli0y" class="commentText"><p>Did you read the article? Lays out pretty clearly how the <span class="math inline">\(113, while technically true, is misleading. The only scenario where he really lost out on \)</span>113 is is if he opts into the 4th year of his current deal and then doesn&rsquo;t get resigned anywhere after that.</p>

<p>The reality is that Brunson probably opts out after Year 3, resigns a new deal at a higher rate, and that only the first three years of this deal are at pay cut (or at least, the current degree of pay cut), which amounts to <span class="math inline">\(37 million. It's a risk, but barring injury, he'll be 30 years old and likely going to be able to resign for a max. Which, as the article points out, is going to be so much money by that time (\)</span>400+ million) that Brunson might not care that he gave up $37 million.</p>

      <label for="ldcnfal" class="commentText"><p>Gotcha so we are basically talking about an Achilles tear. It depends on the level of player. Tatum still gets the super max from the celtics if he suffers an Achilles tear in the finals. Demarcus&rsquo; 5 year max offer turned to a two year max offer post Achilles but he wasn&rsquo;t a top 15 player at the time. Wesley Matthews pretty much got the same deal he was anticipated to get post Achilles tear.</p>

      <label for="ldcbhon" class="commentText"><p>basically it looks like the plan is to re-extend Brunson to a huge max in a few years, we only need the flexibility for the next 2 years so we can re-sign Bridges and Randle</p>

<p>Once they&rsquo;re both re-signed, we can give Brunson a huge max, which will recoup most of the 113mil lost over that contract&rsquo;s 5 years (but not all of it)</p>

<p>Just 1 year ago, he was a good player, but nobody would have thought he was worth a super max contract. A lot happened this past season to increase his value. But just like we saw in IT, especially for an undersized guard, your value can drop very quickly.</p>

<p>Even if there is a good chance he makes most of it back later, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good decision to take that big of a cut unless he&rsquo;s comfortable with the possibility he won&rsquo;t ever see that money.</p>

<p>Key point here. Part of this is that, even if he has a catastrophic injury, he can bank on the Knicks signing him for a deal to make him whole. Which points to the conflict, but from a purely money point of view, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s really risking anything here</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The players’ union surely has questions about this. Is it good practice to sacrifice money for owners and their teams?

<p>Because that’s the reasoning I’ve heard again and again for why the 2nd apron doesn’t actually suck for players.</p>

<p>Like is this just about star players vs role players? Star players taking less means other star players feel pressure to take less money and leave it for the other guys?</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks to everyone who responded and especially u/stonecutter7 and u/junkit33 for clearing this up for me.</p>

<p>In addition to luxury tax not being included as profit in the split, the <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> split isn’t <em>actually</em> <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> - players’ share can range between 48-52%.</p>

<p>And I get you on the hierarchy thing. I know it’s been an issue in the past when the NBAPA leadership was star players but it surprises me more coming from role player types</p>

<p>In theory, Brunson taking less would mean one of two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Players salaries are less than 50% of profits for the year so everyone gets a bonus or</li>
<li>Player salaries still exceed 50% of all profits but not by as much as they would’ve so the money in escrow all players lose is less</li>
</ol>

<p>But I’m hearing that it might be on a team by team basis vs league wide? And something to do with the salary cap too? This might all be going over my head to be honest with you</p>

The NBAPA is worried about players taking less than they are worth because it could have weird ramifications on others salary negotiations going forward.</p>

<p>Because my understanding is that when player salaries don’t add up to half the profit, every single player gets a cut of that extra money.</p>

<p>So from an “every man for himself” perspective, I understand why players might not like the idea that they personally could be pressured to take less than they’re worth.</p>

<p>But a union is theoretically concerned about players as a whole and feels like the majority of players would actually benefit from guys taking large enough pay cuts since they would essentially get a bonus</p>

      <label for="ldcg5de" class="commentText"><p>From what I understand this move doesn&rsquo;t affect the salary sharing since they are over the initial cap line anyways I believe. I could be wrong. But the NBPA has always been more concerned about individual salary as multiple craters to that process could see an overall salary trend downwards.</p>

<p>I personally don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s realistic, and this is more of a one off that I&rsquo;m 100% okay with. But the NBPA has real issues with individual players taking less than they are worth because that level of effect could theoretically affect dudes at all levels. Especially when an all-nba caliber player like Brunson does it.</p>

If I was making 100s of millions of dollars, I&rsquo;d hope that I&rsquo;d do the exact same thing Brunson is doing. Fuck trying to create some kind of conspiracy.</p>

<p>Even as a Mavs fan, I&rsquo;m over the situation and potential tampering. Him leaving and him leaving money on the table makes sense to me.</p>

Look I get it, it seems weird for a player to turn down that much money. But the contacts are getting so out of control that I feel like this kind of deal is going to be inevitable. Guys who can already project to be worth half a billion dollars by the end of their careers are going to take what to them is a minor but sizeable haircut for a gross amount that seems insane to us because being on a more competitive team in a fun environment with players they like playing with is more important than yet further millions. Like you can't actually spend \)</span>100m. There&rsquo;s no amount of simple consumption you can do with that kind of money.

And if the knicks win a title or 2 in the next few years and he continues playing at a top 10 player in the world level,  he will make it back and then some on his next contract. Plus all the extra incentives, both monetarily and just in general, of becoming an all time new Yorks sports legend. He&rsquo;s potentially setting himself up even better, and he&rsquo;s helping his team get better in the mean time. It&rsquo;s a win win. He&rsquo;s taking a small gamble, yeah, but we could look back on this as being a genius move. Time will tell.

      <label for="ldcmkm4" class="commentText"><p>The dad (gm) wont do his sons client dirty. I mean yeah, the owners could say &ldquo; no it didnt work we&rsquo;ve not paying him now. Agreements off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But does anyone think that will happen ? The dad (gm) will tell them of the repercussions. Free agents not trusting the team, future clients of his son not going there. Brunson will be fine and get paid next contract regardless.</p>

<p>On a side note, it always amazes me how insular the nba is. Father/son gm,coaches,staff members etc. I get wanting to follow your fathers footsteps but it really is a hard path to get into for non related people.</p>

      <label for="ldcrii5" class="commentText"><p>The fact that he said there was a conflict of interest with the agent being Leon’s son as tho that would impact brunsons decision is wild. Brunson has an agent but in the end he decides his own contract, and he knew the 2 possibilities. Everyone can speculate if he is getting more under the table as it is objectively a suspect situation w his dad working for the org, but to accuse this w no proof is just dickriding and hater behavior it/until an investigation is done.</p>

<p>Also, do we rly think the Knicks would do something like giving money under the table when the situation is so suspect, like what. You think a team would break the rules when these relationships r so clear and obvious to the public. Maybe Brunson is aware 250 mil +(what he’s made already including this full new contract) is already general wealth</p>

      <label for="ldcf621" class="commentText"><p>How he decided to leave 37 million over the next 3 years on the table is going to be fascinating. The future isn’t promised, especially for small guards. Hope it works out for him and not just the Knicks.</p>

<p>When’s the last time anyone gambled 37 million?</p>

<p>And of course is looks like a corrected deal.</p>

<li>Besides Sam Rose being Leon Rose&rsquo;s son</li>
<li>Leon Rose is Jalen Brunson&rsquo;s god father.</li>
<li>Jalen Brunson&rsquo;s dad Rick Brunson is an assistant coach of the team</li>
<li>William Wesley (aka World Wide Wes) is the Executive Vice President - Senior Basketball Advisor to the Knicks, and is Rick Brunson&rsquo;s best friend and first client (when Rick played in the NBA, Wes was his agent)</li>
<li>Leon Rose used to be William Wesley&rsquo;s attorney for over 2 decades</li>
<li>Rick Brunson has been Tom Thibodeau&rsquo;s assistant at all his previous stops at Chicago, Minnesota etc..</li>
</ul>

<p>If you think nepotism runs deep with the lakers, have a look at the Knicks. They don&rsquo;t get criticized as much because the moves have paid off and knicks are doing well.</p>

      <label for="ldcaz6p" class="commentText"><p>It’s weird people get so dumbfounded that players will take pay cuts sometimes. Like obviously Brunson’s was a big pay cut, but he’s still generationally rich and can do and spend on whatever the fuck he wants for the rest of his life, and so can his kids, and his grandkids.</p>

<p>He’s still filthy rich so why not take a cut to try and improve your legacy + play with your friends</p>
