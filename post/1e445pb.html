<blockquote>
<p>I feel like there’s more to this story. To take <span class="math inline">\(113m less: That is a complete NBA contract. If I told you “So-and-so signed a \)</span>113m contract for 5 years,” you’d say “Wow, that’s an excellent deal.”</p>

<p>It is the number one topic of conversation here in Summer League: What is not being said here? Behind the scenes, what is happening?</p>

<p>There’s another element to this that isn’t immediately apparent: Jalen Brunson is represented by Sam Rose, son of Knicks President of Basketball Operations Leon Rose.</p>

<p>You can convince me there are players who say “you know what? I don’t care about the money. I have more than enough money for me and my family. I’ll take less if you guys can build a championship roster around me.” In a regular situation, ask any player to take $113m less and they say “okay”. Who’s the first person who will tell them “You are out of your damn mind”? His agent.</p>

<p>The agent is the one who usually says “absolutely not”, but in this case, the agent is the son of the man who they are negotiating against. You cannot tell there isn’t some element of a conflict of interest in that.</p>

      <label for="ldda42t" class="commentText"><p>For a guy his size? Unlikely. The Isaiah Thomas lesson has to be a cautionary tale for all small guards in the league. You can be an MVP candidate one day, and the next be out of the league because of a single awkward landing.</p>

<p>Not saying this is the only reason Brunson would sign this contract - I absolutely cannot see the agent not negotiating harder here if they were an unbiased party. But getting paid now is always safer than being paid later when you&rsquo;re small.</p>

<p>Isaiah is a special case, he was heavily reliant on his speed because of his 5&rsquo;7 size. Brunson is 5 inches taller than him, that&rsquo;s the difference between Brunson and being an above average height player</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s sacrificing more now so he can make more later. Guarantees higher quality of life for his team in New York. I don&rsquo;t understand why people are so confused by this.</p>

      <label for="lddew9x" class="commentText"><p>Brunson was on the podcast with Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson where they touched upon the whole contract situation going to the Knicks.  If you take Brunson&rsquo;s word for it, at the beginning of that last year in Dallas he wanted to take that 4 year $55Mm because it was safe.  However Dallas pulled out and he balled tf out in the playoffs which led to him feeling like he outgrew that initial deal.  Then we know what happened from there.</p>

<p>He wanted security but shit happened and he got something better.</p>

      <label for="ldd5gne" class="commentText"><p>A pretty good case can be made that this was a reasonable move by Brunson from a purely selfish / financial perspective, without even considering the Knicks&rsquo; cap situation side of things.</p>

<p><strong>1. Insurance.</strong> By locking in a 4-year bag <em>now</em>, Brunson ensures he gets a big payday even if he sustains a career-ending injury this season.</p>

<p>The flip side is that now he&rsquo;ll have to wait until 2028 to get his mega-payday contract, instead of waiting until 2025. But it&rsquo;s still entirely reasonable to go for the sure thing now, and bet on yourself for the huge contract a few years down the line, rather than bet on yourself for the huge contract next summer without any kind of cushion in case disaster strikes.</p>

<p>Like, think of it in terms of your own life. Suppose someone comes and says I&rsquo;ll give you <span class="math inline">\(156M right now, or if you wait until next year I'll give you \)</span>269M. But there&rsquo;s a chance I won&rsquo;t give you anything at all next year if some conditions fail to get met. (For Brunson that condition is being physically able to play at an elite level, but for a normal person it could be any condition that you only have partial control over and which there&rsquo;s a small but non-zero chance it could fail.) Which one are you taking? I&rsquo;m taking the guaranteed $156M with no hesitation and never looking back.</p>

<p><strong>2. Cap spikes.</strong> Given how much the cap is going to jump in the next few years, Brunson can quickly make up the $37M he left on the table.</p>

<p>The exact final difference really depends on the exact option you choose for his alternative route&ndash; for instance, waiting until next summer he could sign a 4 instead of 5 year deal to be able to opt out earlier, but obviously that subtracts a year of guaranteed income in case of injury.</p>

<p>But the point is that there&rsquo;s a huge payday coming up for him that he gets to cash in on earlier with his current contract, which potentially makes up for a big chunk of what he&rsquo;s sacrificing now, if not outright exceeding it.</p>

<p>So, basically, he&rsquo;s taking the sure thing right now, with a great chance of making up for some or all of the difference on the back end of his career. It&rsquo;s <strong>not</strong> a crazy, indefensible decision even from a purely selfish POV. It makes a lot of sense. The fact that it helps the Knicks build their roster in the meantime could be seen as just icing on the cake for Brunson.</p>

<p>I love this from Brunson for 3 reasons</p>

<ol>
<li>He took the most stable money he can right now. He had to wait to get the fifth year and the contract is based off his current one.</li>
<li>He set himself up to maximize his future money. The 4 year gets him back into the market a year earlier and he’s betting on himself being eligible for the supermax.</li>
<li>His agent is clearly controlling the narrative. Everything he did makes sense. But instead of explaining why. They’re just saying he’s a team player helping out his team and gave up 115 million. That number is competed made up especially considering he will almost guaranteed be paid more than the current 5th value in 4 years unless his body completely self destructs.  It’s just amazing to see how they’ve managed to control the medias way of reporting this.</li>

<p>Brunson had only played lights out like this one  fullyear and was really good the first year on the Knicks but wasn&rsquo;t an all star and now he has Randle, Bridges, OG, and himself o the court at the same time to feed .</p>

<p>Do you think that he&rsquo;s playing hero ball every night and scoring 30 a game night on night out?</p>

<p>Once they&rsquo;re both re-signed, we can give Brunson a huge max, which will recoup most of the 113mil lost over that contract&rsquo;s 5 years (but not all of it)</p>

All in all he probably only gives up less than 37 million over the course of his career and it gives him security next season. Also he has trust in his literal godfather to not screw him over when the time comes.</p>

<p>Key point here. Part of this is that, even if he has a catastrophic injury, he can bank on the Knicks signing him for a deal to make him whole. Which points to the conflict, but from a purely money point of view, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s really risking anything here</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The players’ union surely has questions about this. Is it good practice to sacrifice money for owners and their teams?

<p>Because that’s the reasoning I’ve heard again and again for why the 2nd apron doesn’t actually suck for players.</p>

<p>Like is this just about star players vs role players? Star players taking less means other star players feel pressure to take less money and leave it for the other guys?</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks to everyone who responded and especially u/stonecutter7 and u/junkit33 for clearing this up for me.</p>

<p>In addition to luxury tax not being included as profit in the split, the <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> split isn’t <em>actually</em> <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> - players’ share can range between 48-52%.</p>

Ten percent of each contract goes into an escrow account each year; if teams go way over and spend more, the players pay it back to the league from the escrow account. If the teams don&rsquo;t spend enough, the players get cut an extra check to hit the 51%.</p>

The NBAPA is worried about players taking less than they are worth because it could have weird ramifications on others salary negotiations going forward.</p>

<p>Because my understanding is that when player salaries don’t add up to half the profit, every single player gets a cut of that extra money.</p>

<p>So from an “every man for himself” perspective, I understand why players might not like the idea that they personally could be pressured to take less than they’re worth.</p>

<p>But a union is theoretically concerned about players as a whole and feels like the majority of players would actually benefit from guys taking large enough pay cuts since they would essentially get a bonus</p>

      <label for="ldcg5de" class="commentText"><p>From what I understand this move doesn&rsquo;t affect the salary sharing since they are over the initial cap line anyways I believe. I could be wrong. But the NBPA has always been more concerned about individual salary as multiple craters to that process could see an overall salary trend downwards.</p>

<p>I personally don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s realistic, and this is more of a one off that I&rsquo;m 100% okay with. But the NBPA has real issues with individual players taking less than they are worth because that level of effect could theoretically affect dudes at all levels. Especially when an all-nba caliber player like Brunson does it.</p>

      <label for="ldcamhr" class="commentText"><p>I commend Brunson for being a normal and selfless human being and choosing to create a situation where he can play with his best friends from college in a city close to home with his dad as a coach. If I was making 100s of millions of dollars, I&rsquo;d hope that I&rsquo;d do the exact same thing Brunson is doing. Fuck trying to create some kind of conspiracy.</p>

<p>Even as a Mavs fan, I&rsquo;m over the situation and potential tampering. Him leaving and him leaving money on the table makes sense to me.</p>

That&rsquo;s 113 milluon less than Brunson could have taken NEXT year  over 5 years not 4 so there&rsquo;s a whole other year that&rsquo;s getting factored in and now Brunson can opt back out after 3 years on the new deal and get a supermax ( 35 percent of the cap) all NBA  deal for players with 10 years of service that starts at like 70 million per and goes up.</p>

<p>There were injury risks THIS year with waiting  that now he doesn&rsquo;t have to worry about at all because his deal is locked in and he can opt out sooner and he&rsquo;s playing with his best friends from college.</p>

<p>Jalen Brunson is not stupid, he knows what he&rsquo;s doing and if the team that you liked was signing someone like the Knicks signed Brunson you&rsquo;d be talking about building him  a statue outseide the arena for being selfless.</p>

<p>Some of you people are acting like Dolan handed Brunson a bunch of wampum and some sea shells and Brunson signed on the dotted line.</p>

      <label for="ldcs60b" class="commentText"><p>Gotta love the greediness and stupidity being shown around the league here. Brunson chose to take his max extension this year instead of next year to give the organization flexibility to build a championship team. No one put a gun to his head and told him to do it. Instead of applauding his sacrifice for what it is, people around the league are trying to justify why he wasn&rsquo;t greedy like them and take the money. From agent malpractice, to is he stupid, to he must be under some spell to think this was a great idea, when are people going to realize isn&rsquo;t wasn&rsquo;t about the money, and not everyone thinks like they do.</p>

Look I get it, it seems weird for a player to turn down that much money. But the contacts are getting so out of control that I feel like this kind of deal is going to be inevitable. Guys who can already project to be worth half a billion dollars by the end of their careers are going to take what to them is a minor but sizeable haircut for a gross amount that seems insane to us because being on a more competitive team in a fun environment with players they like playing with is more important than yet further millions.

And if the knicks win a title or 2 in the next few years and he continues playing at a top 10 player in the world level,  he will make it back and then some on his next contract. Plus all the extra incentives, both monetarily and just in general, of becoming an all time new Yorks sports legend. He&rsquo;s potentially setting himself up even better, and he&rsquo;s helping his team get better in the mean time. It&rsquo;s a win win. He&rsquo;s taking a small gamble, yeah, but we could look back on this as being a genius move. Time will tell.

Brunson has an agent but in the end he decides his own contract, and he knew the 2 possibilities. Everyone can speculate if he is getting more under the table as it is objectively a suspect situation w his dad working for the org, but to accuse this w no proof is just dickriding and hater behavior it/until an investigation is done.</p>

<p>Also, do we rly think the Knicks would do something like giving money under the table when the situation is so suspect, like what. You think a team would break the rules when these relationships r so clear and obvious to the public. Maybe Brunson is aware 250 mil +(what he’s made already including this full new contract) is already general wealth</p>

Not surprising whatsoever if he just wanted to lock down some guaranteed money ASAP just in case some freak injury occurs. I get the Knicks would probably throw the bag at him regardless, but the way he carries himself it makes me think he understands how special his situation is and wants to make sure he gets his money.</p>

      <label for="ldd59h3" class="commentText"><p>I am not sure most people get that comparing the contract he signed with the one he would sign is comparing apples to oranges. The contract he would sign next year is for an extra year and that’s where the bulk of the difference comes from. In reality, he has foregone a much more reasonable 37 million over the 3 years of his extension.</p>

<p>That’s still a lot but by the time this contract is up, he’ll be able to sign a much larger extension than he would have been able to next year because of how much the cap will increase over the next 4 years. He certainly did a solid to the Knicks that gives them flexibility going forward, but he did not give up 110+ million.</p>

      <label for="lddogfm" class="commentText"><p>This argument is so asinine. He really didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;take less.&rdquo; He took the money that was available to him now, and ensured that he and his family will be comfortable for generations. He could have waited and potentially got a larger contract next year, but it would have been a massive risk. If I had an agent telling me &ldquo;absolutely not&rdquo; to $156m and telling me to risk it all on my health for another year, I&rsquo;d be firing that agent.</p>

      <label for="lddrb3k" class="commentText"><p>Is it so insane to people that Brunson wants to lock-in the money to protect himself against possible injury? He’s an amazing player, but i’m not sure that he’s the kind of guy who would get a max contract no matter what, especially since he’s not insanely young. It’s smart to protect himself. Plus, in reality he’s setting himself up for that 35% max with a player opt out in the last year of this deal. So if all goes well he’s only losing 37 million.It’s huge for the Knicks, but it also makes perfect sense from Brunson’s perspective when you consider injury protection, playing with his best friends, wanting to compete for a championship, etc.</p>

      <label for="ldefs1p" class="commentText"><p>The <span class="math inline">\(113 mil is misleading. The actual difference is closer to \)</span>37 million. And in 3 years if all goes well, he will get to sign an even bigger contract extension as a 10 year vet with the cap projected to go up significantly. He can potentially help the Knicks be contenders in the short run and still set himself up to get all of that money back down the road. And it is short term security securing a max bag in the event of a catastrophic injury in the next season.</p>

He’s looking to be alternative and he’s kind of a phony about it.</p>

<p>Also, there are bigger contracts coming (higher BRI) up after this contract is up and he’s estimated to make a similar amount of money. And as the undisputed King of New York at the moment, any decent agent can make up a large portion of the difference in money.  </p>

<p> But to re-iterate: Amin sucks now and just works angles for takes that fewer and fewer people respect but more and more are listening. </p>

      <label for="ldcxf07" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s understandable other teams are looking at what went down here with a raised eyebrow if for nothing else, the Knicks have put themselves in position to at least be a legitimate darkhorse title threat and a more difficult team to defeat with the road map to be that good for years to come. When your competition improves that way and does so and remains under the second apron than of course there will be chatter.</p>

<p>For agents, of course they&rsquo;re going to be thinking about their own players and their own future FA decisions and potential precedent which could impact negotiations for them going forward, although I presume that&rsquo;s unlikely. I don&rsquo;t think players care too much, frankly. The suits do. The players in suits for the union do. Your average players I doubt does.</p>

      <label for="ldezn81" class="commentText"><p>There is a reason Amin Elhassan is barely featured anywhere anymore. His takes are always so idiotic. Brunson clearly has his priorities in order and by taking this contract he’s getting to have everything he wants: friends, icon status in New York, wealth, a fantastic team to compete for years. Why should this be considered something surprising or outlandish?</p>
