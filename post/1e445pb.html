<p>I feel like there’s more to this story. To take <span class="math inline">\(113m less: That is a complete NBA contract. If I told you “So-and-so signed a \)</span>113m contract for 5 years,” you’d say “Wow, that’s an excellent deal.”</p>

<p>It is the number one topic of conversation here in Summer League: What is not being said here? Behind the scenes, what is happening?</p>

<p>There’s another element to this that isn’t immediately apparent: Jalen Brunson is represented by Sam Rose, son of Knicks President of Basketball Operations Leon Rose.</p>

<p>You can convince me there are players who say “you know what? I don’t care about the money. I have more than enough money for me and my family. I’ll take less if you guys can build a championship roster around me.” In a regular situation, ask any player to take $113m less and they say “okay”. Who’s the first person who will tell them “You are out of your damn mind”? His agent.</p>

<p>The agent is the one who usually says “absolutely not”, but in this case, the agent is the son of the man who they are negotiating against. You cannot tell there isn’t some element of a conflict of interest in that.</p>

<p>Once they&rsquo;re both re-signed, we can give Brunson a huge max, which will recoup most of the 113mil lost over that contract&rsquo;s 5 years (but not all of it)</p>

      <label for="ldce1d4" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s still making more money than most people would know what to do with, so I really hope his reasoning behind this was that just being a number that he was comfortable losing in order to play with his best friends from college.</p>

<p>Just 1 year ago, he was a good player, but nobody would have thought he was worth a super max contract. A lot happened this past season to increase his value. But just like we saw in IT, especially for an undersized guard, your value can drop very quickly.</p>

<p>Even if there is a good chance he makes most of it back later, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good decision to take that big of a cut unless he&rsquo;s comfortable with the possibility he won&rsquo;t ever see that money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The players’ union surely has questions about this. Is it good practice to sacrifice money for owners and their teams? While I was in Las Vegas for summer league, people around the Thomas &amp; Mack Center openly questioned what this means for star players, their money and negotiations moving forward.</p>

<p>Because that’s the reasoning I’ve heard again and again for why the 2nd apron doesn’t actually suck for players.</p>

<p>Like is this just about star players vs role players? Star players taking less means other star players feel pressure to take less money and leave it for the other guys?</p>

      <label for="ldce8j6" class="commentText"><p>I think in terms of your last point it&rsquo;s more that owners/gm&rsquo;s can use brunson as leverage to say things like &ldquo;well he&rsquo;s an X quality player and he just signed for this contract, you shouldn&rsquo;t be making more than him etc.&rdquo; When negotiating with current player salaries. The NBAPA is worried about players taking less than they are worth because it could have weird ramifications on others salary negotiations going forward.</p>

<p>At least that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;ve always understood that argument.</p>

      <label for="ldcfg05" class="commentText"><p>But if those guys sign for less doesn’t that just mean more players get money?</p>

<p>Because my understanding is that when player salaries don’t add up to half the profit, every single player gets a cut of that extra money.</p>

<p>So from an “every man for himself” perspective, I understand why players might not like the idea that they personally could be pressured to take less than they’re worth.</p>

<p>But a union is theoretically concerned about players as a whole and feels like the majority of players would actually benefit from guys taking large enough pay cuts since they would essentially get a bonus</p>

      <label for="ldcg5de" class="commentText"><p>From what I understand this move doesn&rsquo;t affect the salary sharing since they are over the initial cap line anyways I believe. I could be wrong. But the NBPA has always been more concerned about individual salary as multiple craters to that process could see an overall salary trend downwards.</p>

<p>I personally don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s realistic, and this is more of a one off that I&rsquo;m 100% okay with. But the NBPA has real issues with individual players taking less than they are worth because that level of effect could theoretically affect dudes at all levels. Especially when an all-nba caliber player like Brunson does it.</p>

Guys who can already project to be worth half a billion dollars by the end of their careers are going to take what to them is a minor but sizeable haircut for a gross amount that seems insane to us because being on a more competitive team in a fun environment with players they like playing with is more important than yet further millions.

<li>William Wesley (aka World Wide Wes) is the Executive Vice President - Senior Basketball Advisor to the Knicks, and is Rick Brunson&rsquo;s best friend and first client (when Rick played in the NBA, Wes was his agent)</li>
<li>Leon Rose used to be William Wesley&rsquo;s attorney for over 2 decades</li>
<li>Rick Brunson has been Tom Thibodeau&rsquo;s assistant at all his previous stops at Chicago, Minnesota etc..</li>
</ul>

<p>If you think nepotism runs deep with the lakers, have a look at the Knicks. They don&rsquo;t get criticized as much because the moves have paid off and knicks are doing well.</p>

      <label for="ldcaz6p" class="commentText"><p>It’s weird people get so dumbfounded that players will take pay cuts sometimes. Like obviously Brunson’s was a big pay cut, but he’s still generationally rich and can do and spend on whatever the fuck he wants for the rest of his life, and so can his kids, and his grandkids.</p>

<p>He’s still filthy rich so why not take a cut to try and improve your legacy + play with your friends</p>

      <label for="ldccd38" class="commentText"><p>I personally would start taking huge paycuts to stay in my preferred city after making my first 100 million, but I think for rich players, they hang alot with people who are even more rich than them (Celebrities, etc.) and it exposes to them to the different levels of wealth that normal people like me aren&rsquo;t aware of.</p>
