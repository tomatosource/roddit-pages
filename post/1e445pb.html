<p>I feel like there’s more to this story. To take <span class="math inline">\(113m less: That is a complete NBA contract. If I told you “So-and-so signed a \)</span>113m contract for 5 years,” you’d say “Wow, that’s an excellent deal.”</p>

<p>It is the number one topic of conversation here in Summer League: What is not being said here? Behind the scenes, what is happening?</p>

<p>There’s another element to this that isn’t immediately apparent: Jalen Brunson is represented by Sam Rose, son of Knicks President of Basketball Operations Leon Rose.</p>

<p>You can convince me there are players who say “you know what? I don’t care about the money. I have more than enough money for me and my family. I’ll take less if you guys can build a championship roster around me.” In a regular situation, ask any player to take $113m less and they say “okay”. Who’s the first person who will tell them “You are out of your damn mind”? His agent.</p>

<p>The agent is the one who usually says “absolutely not”, but in this case, the agent is the son of the man who they are negotiating against. You cannot tell there isn’t some element of a conflict of interest in that.</p>

<p>I love this from Brunson for 3 reasons</p>

<ol>
<li>He took the most stable money he can right now. He had to wait to get the fifth year and the contract is based off his current one.</li>
<li>He set himself up to maximize his future money. The 4 year gets him back into the market a year earlier and he’s betting on himself being eligible for the supermax.</li>
<li>His agent is clearly controlling the narrative. Everything he did makes sense. But instead of explaining why. They’re just saying he’s a team player helping out his team and gave up 115 million. That number is competed made up especially considering he will almost guaranteed be paid more than the current 5th value in 4 years unless his body completely self destructs.  It’s just amazing to see how they’ve managed to control the medias way of reporting this.</li>

<p>The reality is that Brunson probably opts out after Year 3, resigns a new deal at a higher rate, and that only the first three years of this deal are at pay cut (or at least, the current degree of pay cut), which amounts to <span class="math inline">\(37 million.

One has 4 yrs, one has 5. He will most likely still be playing after the 4 yr contract is over, and he&rsquo;ll make money in that 5th yr on a NEW contract. He&rsquo;s banking on still playing at a star level, which would make it a supermax, so to properly compare you need to add on what that 1st yr of the next contract is predicted to be.</p>

      <label for="ldcnfal" class="commentText"><p>Gotcha so we are basically talking about an Achilles tear. It depends on the level of player. Tatum still gets the super max from the celtics if he suffers an Achilles tear in the finals. Demarcus&rsquo; 5 year max offer turned to a two year max offer post Achilles but he wasn&rsquo;t a top 15 player at the time. Wesley Matthews pretty much got the same deal he was anticipated to get post Achilles tear.</p>

<p>Once they&rsquo;re both re-signed, we can give Brunson a huge max, which will recoup most of the 113mil lost over that contract&rsquo;s 5 years (but not all of it)</p>

<p>Just 1 year ago, he was a good player, but nobody would have thought he was worth a super max contract. A lot happened this past season to increase his value. But just like we saw in IT, especially for an undersized guard, your value can drop very quickly.</p>

<p>Even if there is a good chance he makes most of it back later, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good decision to take that big of a cut unless he&rsquo;s comfortable with the possibility he won&rsquo;t ever see that money.</p>

<p>1 - why won&rsquo;t you need the flexibility after 2 years especially since that&rsquo;s when the 2nd apron penalties including the pick moving to the back of the draft would kick in?</p>

<p>2- Wouldn&rsquo;t that huge max still be available even if he signed for the full amount now?</p>

All in all he probably only gives up less than 37 million over the course of his career and it gives him security next season. Also he has trust in his literal godfather to not screw him over when the time comes.</p>

<p>bc the Mavs let that contract expire, Brunson was no longer eligible for the 7-9 year of service 35% supermax (has to be with the team that drafted you, or traded for you while you were still on your rookie deal/1st 4 seasons in the league).</p>

<p>he can only get the 35% cap max once he hits 10 years of service</p>

<p>Key point here. Part of this is that, even if he has a catastrophic injury, he can bank on the Knicks signing him for a deal to make him whole. Which points to the conflict, but from a purely money point of view, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s really risking anything here</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The players’ union surely has questions about this. Is it good practice to sacrifice money for owners and their teams?

<p>Because that’s the reasoning I’ve heard again and again for why the 2nd apron doesn’t actually suck for players.</p>

<p>Like is this just about star players vs role players? Star players taking less means other star players feel pressure to take less money and leave it for the other guys?</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks to everyone who responded and especially u/stonecutter7 and u/junkit33 for clearing this up for me.</p>

<p>In addition to luxury tax not being included as profit in the split, the <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> split isn’t <em>actually</em> <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> - players’ share can range between 48-52%.</p>

<p>In theory, Brunson taking less would mean one of two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Players salaries are less than 50% of profits for the year so everyone gets a bonus or</li>
<li>Player salaries still exceed 50% of all profits but not by as much as they would’ve so the money in escrow all players lose is less</li>
</ol>

<p>But I’m hearing that it might be on a team by team basis vs league wide? And something to do with the salary cap too? This might all be going over my head to be honest with you</p>

<p>Not sure what decides the exact % players get but if higher player salary means the least players can get is 52% vs 48% of all nba profits, that’s a huge difference that I can understand a union being concerned about</p>

The 2% difference you bring up is a small factor that the players union doesn’t care about. Just google around, its the same answer every time, players undercutting their value hurts other players on an individual basis, nobody cares about the total overall share until CBA time</p>

The NBAPA is worried about players taking less than they are worth because it could have weird ramifications on others salary negotiations going forward.</p>

      <label for="ldcfg05" class="commentText"><p>But if those guys sign for less doesn’t that just mean more players get money?</p>

<p>Because my understanding is that when player salaries don’t add up to half the profit, every single player gets a cut of that extra money.</p>

<p>So from an “every man for himself” perspective, I understand why players might not like the idea that they personally could be pressured to take less than they’re worth.</p>

<p>But a union is theoretically concerned about players as a whole and feels like the majority of players would actually benefit from guys taking large enough pay cuts since they would essentially get a bonus</p>

      <label for="ldcg5de" class="commentText"><p>From what I understand this move doesn&rsquo;t affect the salary sharing since they are over the initial cap line anyways I believe. I could be wrong. But the NBPA has always been more concerned about individual salary as multiple craters to that process could see an overall salary trend downwards.</p>

<p>I personally don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s realistic, and this is more of a one off that I&rsquo;m 100% okay with. But the NBPA has real issues with individual players taking less than they are worth because that level of effect could theoretically affect dudes at all levels. Especially when an all-nba caliber player like Brunson does it.</p>

The Knicks bent over backwards to make him happy and he returned the favor.</p>

<p>Now his great great great great great grandkids might have to get a job. Oh no.</p>

      <label for="ldcamhr" class="commentText"><p>I commend Brunson for being a normal and selfless human being and choosing to create a situation where he can play with his best friends from college in a city close to home with his dad as a coach. If I was making 100s of millions of dollars, I&rsquo;d hope that I&rsquo;d do the exact same thing Brunson is doing. Fuck trying to create some kind of conspiracy.</p>

<p>Even as a Mavs fan, I&rsquo;m over the situation and potential tampering. Him leaving and him leaving money on the table makes sense to me.</p>

If a small guard loses their quickness, it&rsquo;s a wrap. Look how quickly guys like Kemba Walker and Isaiah Thomas declined.</p>

Guys who can already project to be worth half a billion dollars by the end of their careers are going to take what to them is a minor but sizeable haircut for a gross amount that seems insane to us because being on a more competitive team in a fun environment with players they like playing with is more important than yet further millions.

Brunson has an agent but in the end he decides his own contract, and he knew the 2 possibilities. Everyone can speculate if he is getting more under the table as it is objectively a suspect situation w his dad working for the org, but to accuse this w no proof is just dickriding and hater behavior it/until an investigation is done.</p>

<p>Also, do we rly think the Knicks would do something like giving money under the table when the situation is so suspect, like what. You think a team would break the rules when these relationships r so clear and obvious to the public. Maybe Brunson is aware 250 mil +(what he’s made already including this full new contract) is already general wealth</p>

That&rsquo;s 113 milluon less than Brunson could have taken NEXT year  over 5 years not 4 so there&rsquo;s a whole other year that&rsquo;s getting factored in and now Brunson can opt back out after 3 years on the new deal and get a supermax ( 35 percent of the cap) all NBA  deal for players with 10 years of service that starts at like 70 million per and goes up.</p>

<p>There were injury risks THIS year with waiting  that now he doesn&rsquo;t have to worry about at all because his deal is locked in and he can opt out sooner and he&rsquo;s playing with his best friends from college.</p>

<p>Jalen Brunson is not stupid, he knows what he&rsquo;s doing and if the team that you liked was signing someone like the Knicks signed Brunson you&rsquo;d be talking about building him  a statue outseide the arena for being selfless.</p>

<p>If you think nepotism runs deep with the lakers, have a look at the Knicks. They don&rsquo;t get criticized as much because the moves have paid off and knicks are doing well.</p>

      <label for="ldckl9w" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s betting on himself. He&rsquo;s only actually risking 37 million. And if the knicks win a title or 2 in the next few years and he continues playing at a top 10 player in the world level,  he will make it back and then some on his next contract. Plus all the extra incentives, both monetarily and just in general, of becoming an all time new Yorks sports legend. He&rsquo;s potentially setting himself up even better, and he&rsquo;s helping his team get better in the mean time. It&rsquo;s a win win. He&rsquo;s taking a small gamble, yeah, but we could look back on this as being a genius move. Time will tell. Anyone who is hating on this move either doesn&rsquo;t fully understand the situation, or they&rsquo;re just being haters</p>

He’s looking to be alternative and he’s kind of a phony about it.</p>

<p>Also, there are bigger contracts coming (higher BRI) up after this contract is up and he’s estimated to make a similar amount of money. And as the undisputed King of New York at the moment, any decent agent can make up a large portion of the difference in money.  </p>

<p> But to re-iterate: Amin sucks now and just works angles for takes that fewer and fewer people respect but more and more are listening. </p>

      <label for="ldcs60b" class="commentText"><p>Gotta love the greediness and stupidity being shown around the league here. Brunson chose to take his max extension this year instead of next year to give the organization flexibility to build a championship team. No one put a gun to his head and told him to do it. Instead of applauding his sacrifice for what it is, people around the league are trying to justify why he wasn&rsquo;t greedy like them and take the money. From agent malpractice, to is he stupid, to he must be under some spell to think this was a great idea, when are people going to realize isn&rsquo;t wasn&rsquo;t about the money, and not everyone thinks like they do.</p>

What’s the saying, “A bird in the hand is worth more than two in bush.” Locking in a huge amount of money sooner is a good risk reduction and overall strategy for a small physical guard who ended the playoffs in an injury who is putting on above average miles playing for Tibbs.</p>

      <label for="ldcxf07" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s understandable other teams are looking at what went down here with a raised eyebrow if for nothing else, the Knicks have put themselves in position to at least be a legitimate darkhorse title threat and a more difficult team to defeat with the road map to be that good for years to come. When your competition improves that way and does so and remains under the second apron than of course there will be chatter.</p>

<p>For agents, of course they&rsquo;re going to be thinking about their own players and their own future FA decisions and potential precedent which could impact negotiations for them going forward, although I presume that&rsquo;s unlikely. I don&rsquo;t think players care too much, frankly. The suits do. The players in suits for the union do. Your average players I doubt does.</p>

<p>He’s still filthy rich so why not take a cut to try and improve your legacy + play with your friends</p>
