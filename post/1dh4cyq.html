      <label for="l8ubhn6" class="commentText"><p>The thing is, KD wouldn&rsquo;t have joined any team other than the Warriors.</p>

<p>The Thunder were a great team.</p>

<p>They had Westbrook, Oladipo, Adams, Roberson, Kanter, Cam Payne, Anthony Morrow, Dion Waiters.</p>

<p>They had also just drafted Domantas Sabonis. (So at this point they actually had all the pieces that they ended up trading for Paul George, imagine if they added him to that squad).</p>

<p>If KD agreed to re-sign, a (prime) Al Horford was ready to sign with the Thunder as well.</p>

<p>KD wasn&rsquo;t going to leave a great team that was just up 3-1 on the Warriors, poised to head to the NBA Finals for just any &ldquo;good&rdquo; team.</p>

<p>He wanted to join the most stacked team in NBA history so he could have an easy path to a title.</p>

<p>Joining any team other than the Warriors (or Cavs) would&rsquo;ve been a downgrade from the Thunder.</p>

<p>KD was <em>already</em> on easy street and he said &ldquo;no but I want you guys to carry me down the street too.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l8ue967" class="commentText"><p>Celtics were reportedly “close” to signing KD but this is also in the era where Danny Ainge was a legend for hypothetical trade deals and free agent signings. He would have fit that C’s team like a glove and I’ve always been sad it never happened because he’s one of my favorite players.</p>

      <label for="l8ucrjx" class="commentText"><p>Nope, in fact if he would have helped a sign and trade to go to the warriors I wouldn&rsquo;t have been as mad too.</p>

<p>The fact that he went to the team that just beat us, in a series they lost because he disappeared, and left the team and fan base that treated like a god with nothing but a sour taste in their mouth. I lost all respect for the dude. That day he eliminated himself from ever being talked about as one of the greats. IMO.</p>
