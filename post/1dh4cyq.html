<p>The fact that he went to the team that just beat us, in a series they lost because he disappeared, and left the team and fan base that treated like a god with nothing but a sour taste in their mouth. I lost all respect for the dude. That day he eliminated himself from ever being talked about as one of the greats. IMO.</p>

<p>The Thunder were a great team.</p>

<p>They had Westbrook, Oladipo, Adams, Roberson, Kanter, Cam Payne, Anthony Morrow, Dion Waiters.</p>

<p>They had also just drafted Domantas Sabonis. (So at this point they actually had all the pieces that they ended up trading for Paul George, imagine if they added him to that squad).</p>

<p>If KD agreed to re-sign, a (prime) Al Horford was ready to sign with the Thunder as well.</p>

<p>KD wasn&rsquo;t going to leave a great team that was just up 3-1 on the Warriors, poised to head to the NBA Finals for just any &ldquo;good&rdquo; team.</p>

<p>He wanted to join the most stacked team in NBA history so he could have an easy path to a title.</p>

<p>Joining any team other than the Warriors (or Cavs) would&rsquo;ve been a downgrade from the Thunder.</p>

<p>KD was <em>already</em> on easy street and he said &ldquo;no but I want you guys to carry me down the street too.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l8v8l5s" class="commentText"><p>I remember there being a lot of speculation after Horford signed with the Celtics that KD would potentially join him as well. Imagine a scenario where the Celtics, without the need of a sign and trade, picked up KD with our BKN’s draft picks still intact. We would have probably won at least two titles by now.</p>

      <label for="l8vbmll" class="commentText"><p>Horford was going to sign with the Thunder when KD, signed his contract. Yes that&rsquo;s right he agreed to sign, as he told Westbrook, Presti, Horford, and Oladipo the day before. As he was friends with Dipo and Horford and was one of the reasons we traded Ibaka, because Horford was going to replace him in the starting lineup and Dipo was going to come off the bench.</p>

<p>That Team.would have had.</p>

<p>Pg. Russ
SG. Roberson
SF. Durant
PF. Horford
C. Adams.</p>

<p>The bench would&rsquo;ve had Dipo, Enes Kanter, Sabonis, Jeremy Grant, Dion Waiters, Cam Payne</p>

<p>Westbrook and Adams get standing ovations in OKC. Paul George gets a big applause. Ibaka, Paul, Schroder, and Grant still get love in OKC when they hit the court.</p>

<p>Heck…even folks like Tre Mann and Micic get big love when they come back.</p>

<p>If a player was in OKC and did right by the team the fans will be disappointed when they leave but will still cheer them when they are here. They are like an ex in-law that we really liked and quite miss now that they are gone.</p>

<p>KD on the other hand was branching from one relationship to another while still in a relationship with OKC. The new relationship was with the one most hated possibility . Then he had the gall to shit talk the old relationship and tell everyone that it was the “Hardest Road”.</p>

<p>He simply chose the easiest route to a championship possible, while fronting like he was taking the hardest.</p>

      <label for="l8umqgz" class="commentText"><p>If it wasn’t the Warriors, the Celtics were super close apparently. KD with the very young Jays, I’m pretty sure we had IT and Hawford at the time.</p>

<p>That would have been something to see.</p>

      <label for="l8uqsw2" class="commentText"><p>Horford was looking to sign with OKC had KD re-signed. That could have been a decent five-out with Westbrook pushing the pace.</p>

<p>Westbrook, Singler, KD, Ibaka and Horford would make noise in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="l8v3ut2" class="commentText"><p>This is totally off topic, but it’s weird to remember that KD was originally drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics. He could could have bolstered his legacy by signing with the Blazers to get back to the NorthWest. There’s even a chance that KD teamed with Dame and McCollum could have made a serious run at a ring.</p>

      <label for="l8v4adr" class="commentText"><p>Team that just beat us sucks snd thats why most are mad. They were already awesome, he did get 2 rings so maybe it was tbe right call. I dont really care on who he went to that&rsquo;s his call.</p>

<p>Bad deal to me was no heads up or option to sign and trade. That&rsquo;s the toughest part. I dont know if that was an option. We lose generational talent and got nothing in return. PG, Russ they leave after signing deals and we end up with a haul for them.  That could be on Presti and not KD but we won&rsquo;t know.</p>
