</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>It’s a head scratcher why Porzingis wasn’t more coveted around the league. I understand the injury issues, but if you can manage his minutes, he is a pivotal piece for any team.</p>

<p>He’s 7’2 with a 7’6 wingspan and can pull up from Steph Curry range. He can shoot the midrange as well, back his opponent down, and use his size effectively inside. On the defensive end, he’s extremely mobile for his height and a very good rim protector without picking up too many fouls.</p>

<p>Porzingis is like Kevin Love if he was 5 inches taller. He also has games like yesterday when he looks like a fusion of Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert. He’s such a versatile player.</p>

<p>Makes you wonder if they’ll put KP on ice for all of next April and into May just to let him rest and rehab for the playoffs. They won’t need him in the first round anyway.</p>

<p>Prior iterations KP got the ball at the three point line and either shot it or would fake into a drive. That would lead to injuries on someone his size so this is the first season a team could survive this deep into the playoffs to get him back. His rim protection has always been elite, but this is the first season everything has finally come together for him.</p>

If we’re going to speak on cake walks, the Pacers had one hell of a run this year, especially being pretty much fully healthy up until Game 2 of the ECF (which was a series they had 0 chance in). It’s pretty gross how the health factors carried them into the ECF when they really never felt like that great of a team.</p>

      <label for="l7nmzd8" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I agree Pacers had a ridiculously easy path as well, cause the whole conference was getting injured. I&rsquo;m not judging their legacy or whatever. My point is, i don&rsquo;t think the Celtics get to finals without KP next year, and I&rsquo;m not sure they would&rsquo;ve this year in a healthier east. They&rsquo;re probably gonna need at least 2 full rounds from him.</p>

      <label for="l7lysb1" class="commentText"><p>I think the biggest thing with the Celtics as a team is they’re perfect for really good players that aren’t always consistent since you can float from being the 1-5th option depending on whose got it that night. It lets Tatum be off a few nights. Or when brown can’t seem to dribble. Or jrue goes cold. Who cares all four other guys can carry it that night. So porzingis is an awesome third option that they don’t even need to be a consistent third option if he’s out with injury or not playing great.</p>

      <label for="l7o752b" class="commentText"><p>That was just the best in a long line of examples of Belichick buying a risky asset at it’s lowest value. Moss was bad on the Raiders and there were genuine character and motivation concerns with him throughout the league.</p>

<p>Bill thought the investment was low and that he could get Moss on board in his system whereas other GMs weren’t willing to take that risk.</p>

<p>I honestly don’t know that there were even any other offers made to the Raiders to move Moss at that time given that he was only traded for a fourth round pick.</p>

      <label for="l7nhvap" class="commentText"><p>I was saying this when he was at the Mavs. They lacked a no2, and KP couldn&rsquo;t fill those shoes, also because his injuries really hurt the team and they therefore forced him back early all the time, but he would be an elite no3.</p>

      <label for="l7o4m58" class="commentText"><p>I agree but it&rsquo;s his health that makes him an ideal 3rd option.  If he was our 2nd option that would mean either Tatum or Brown isn&rsquo;t playing for some reason and with KPs injuries we probably wouldn&rsquo;t be a 1 seed and potentially not in the finals since he missed basically all the playoffs.</p>
