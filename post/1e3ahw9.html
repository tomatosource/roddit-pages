</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>###Introduction</p>

<p>Much has been discussed of Isaiah Hartenstein&rsquo;s rise and how he learned about passing angles as Jokic&rsquo;s backup. However I think he has a lot more in common with another player he reportedly studied, <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/why-isaiah-hartenstein-could-be-the-best-big-man-available-on-the-market-134657059.html" target="_blank">Draymond Green.</a></p>

<p>Although they had very different paths to the league, one being a 4 year college player and the other, an 18 year old international prospect ping-ponged throughout the league trying to find a place where he belonged, they ended up with surprisingly similar production when considering advanced metrics and team context. So I figured that analyzing this using Per 36 metrics as well as touch per game metrics would better reflect their rise as they gained minutes throughout their respective careers to see how Hartenstein and the thunder should play going forward.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Touch Per Game stats weren&rsquo;t included for Draymond and iHart&rsquo;s age 22 seasons due to the metric not being tracked until Draymond&rsquo;s age 23 season and iHart being on 3 different teams during that season leading to less accurate numbers.</p>

<p>###Conclusions from the data:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>By their age 25 seasons, both players can be considered low-usage, high-impact players that you can expect to give you elite defense (top 5 in their position FG% against at the rim and deflections made; along with giving you 80+ steals and blocks in a season); being a hub connecting playmaker in the high-post to find tight windows for cutters and through dribble hand-offs for shooters coming from off-ball screens.</p></li>

<li><p>Hartenstein differs from Draymond in that he is less of a versatile switchable defender (still great switchability  just not elite like draymond) and moreso focused on traditional big man skills. Such as elite offensive rebounding ability, great at boxing out for others on defensive rebounds, and setting setting good screens in the pick and roll, and being one of the top rim protectors by FG% against.</p></li>

<li><p>Hartenstein has significantly improved in his ability as a passer when looking at his assist to turnover ratio despite having a significantly lower amount of touches per game and should be given more touches in the future.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>###Thoughts on how Hartenstein should fit on the Thunder:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A lot has been discussed about if iHart should start but I think that&rsquo;s the wrong thing to focus on. What should really be discussed is how the thunder should maximize Hartenstein. In my opinion, the answer of how to best maximize Hartenstein is to find a way to get him as many minutes/ touches as possible, depending on the matchup-need, if he is a starter or off the bench.</p></li>

<li><p>The method on how to maximize iHart as a starter already exists in the 2016-2017 Warriors as there is a very similar collection of talent. That being an MVP level PG who is the heart of the team (SGA/Curry) a hyper efficient shooting who can operate as a star 3 and D player (Jdub/Klay) skyscraping rail-thin scoring wing who can operate as a free safety shot blocker (Chet/KD) next to a low-usage, high-impact player who gives you elite defense and hub connecting playmaking finding the best open man if SGA gets doubled (iHart/Draymond) and a defensive wing who&rsquo;s job is to make open shots and shut down the best player on the other team (Lu Dort or Caruso/Iguodala)</p></li>

<li><p>To maximize iHart when he isn&rsquo;t starting in their equivalent of a death line up, they should have him operate in a mixture of his role on the knicks and a Jokic-lite role with the second unit where he touches the ball at least once every possession and gets a chance to take more of his signature 6 to 10 foot floaters, while mixing in some of their elite shot creators who can operate a 2 man game with him like how iHart did with Brunson so iHart can focus more on defense throughout the game.</p></li>
</ul>

      <label for="ld6mtvh" class="commentText"><p>He mentioned that he is going to do the dirty work, to give Chet a break. Guys like these are the reason a team with a lot of star caliber players could work. They have no personal egos - goals to pad their points etc, just doing the hard lifting to win games. Presti really sought after players like Caruso/iHeart that won&rsquo;t take touches away from the core 3, and will play within the system. Deadly combo.</p>

It&rsquo;s something you miss by looking at raw assist numbers from per36.</p>

<p>However, iHart has played 5784 minutes in his career.  The closest line to that for Draymond is playing 5348 minutes through his first three seasons.  At those respective points iHart is at a 13.5% assist rate and Draymond was at a 12.9% assist rate.</p>

      <label for="ld6nivb" class="commentText"><p>For the Clippers, Hartenstein basically ran the offense for the second unit. Thibs seemed to just use him as a traditional backup big in his first NYK season, and figured out in the second season that he should involve him more, but then Hartenstein had to replace Robinson, and he went back to playing a more traditional big role. I think Deignault’s system will suit Hartenstein well, take some offensive pressure off of Shai, and absorb some contact for Chet.</p>

<p>I’d imagine all that is gonna be better with ihart</p>

<p>Mostly looking forward to ihart jdub pnr with shooters in the corners</p>

<p>SGA doesn’t really use pnr, but I’m sure he’d benefit from an actual screener</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He watched film of Draymond Green’s defensive versatility, how the Warriors veteran called out off-ball switches before they needed to occur, and always stepped into the right place several passes before the possession moved that direction. “A lot of players who don’t play, they’re OK on offense but don’t get why they’re not really on the court,” Hartenstein said. “Most of the time it’s defense. And I took that really personal.”</p>

      <label for="ld6nqhw" class="commentText"><p>This is interesting but does it make sense to us per36 to compare someone who has mostly been a bench player to someone who has been a crucial starter for most of their career? Ihart has played more than 20mpg once, Draymond has averaged well over that over the given time span. Per36 is always going to skew in favor of the lower minutes player, especially when the discrepancy is so large.</p>

      <label for="ld6owhb" class="commentText"><p>I was also undecided on how best to represent it but came to the conclusion of per 36 because it demonstrated iHart increased passing ability year over year while accounting for touches per game. As an increase in assists could be caused by just having more opportunities to pass the ball rather than passing efficiently with a set volume. Which is the conclusion I gathered comparing their age 25 seasons and since it felt weird using per 36 just for assists then going back to regular stats I decided on this. definitely trying to figure out improvements for the next time I try to make a post</p>

      <label for="ld74zt9" class="commentText"><p>The whole point of Draymond is that his impact as a help defender and in being switchable doesn’t show up on the box score. They’re just not comparable players.</p>

<li><p>Specifically shows the table that Draymond has twice as many touches per game</p></li>

<li><p>&ldquo;Both players can be called a hub connecting playmaker&rdquo;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>One is his team&rsquo;s first passer and one is usually 4th (sometimes arguably 5th when OG&rsquo;s out, McBride is comparable). He can do some stuff, but it&rsquo;s overall way less than Draymond Green, so much the comparison loses meaning. Thing with Draymond is not how much he fills the boxscore but how the team can play with him, the way not possible with other players.</p>

      <label for="ld6rv5v" class="commentText"><p>touches per game and per 36 assist and turnover metrics were added to quantify assist frequency and efficiency based on the opportunities players were given without minutes played being a factor. I came to the hub connecting playmaker conclusion because his assist to turnover numbers was consistent with the amount of opportunites (touches) he was given. if ihart had the same per 36 assist/turnover numbers but with double the touches he&rsquo;d be less efficient of a hub connecting playmaker since they are both low usage players (i.e you can infer the extra touches aren&rsquo;t going to shots)</p>

      <label for="ld72u84" class="commentText"><p>iHart has always had the talent. His biggest issue early on was fouling. I think one year he avenged like 9.5 per 36. He was just constantly playing himself off the floor.</p>
