      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fk9vd5/the_deadline_for_extending_the_2021_rookies_is/"><p>The deadline for extending the 2021 rookies is about a month away.  Over half of the lottery picks for the class have yet to or won&rsquo;t be eligible for a rookie extension.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>The 2021 NBA draft class has been an odd one.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s been a ton of franchise-level talent to come out of it (Scottie Barnes, Cade Cunningham, Alperen Sengun, Evan Mobley) even if some of the franchises that lucked into said talent have struggled to build around them or have less than ideal circumstances for one reason or another.</p>

<p>But while most of these players have received their own rookie extensions aside from Sengun, there are a surprising number of 2021 draftees who are looking at entering the 2025 free agency class as restricted free agency or are straight up not going to receive that second contract&hellip;though in one particularly notorious case, they did receive a second contract despite not being on their rookie contract at the time of signing.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go over the lottery selections (1st thru 14th) that <em>haven&rsquo;t been extended</em> ever so briefly to see what their current circumstances are and whether they have a shot at eking out that newly inked deal before October 21st.</p>

<p><strong>Jalen Green (2nd overall):</strong>  Everyone&rsquo;s favorite March merchant had a hot end to the season&hellip;as he has for the past 3 years of his career.  For the rest of the year - and the 3rd season in a row - Green was inconsistent and with fellow 2021 draftee Sengun also looking at a large new contract, the Rockets might have to make a decision on who to build around going forward.  Whether that&rsquo;s a consolidation move for a star or a &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t afford Harden&rdquo; trade in the offseason, it&rsquo;s one of the many reasons Houston is amongst the more interesting teams in the league.</p>

<p><strong>Jalen Suggs (5th overall):</strong>  His fellow 2021 lottery selection Franz got a rookie max deal but Suggs has not been so lucky.  He had a solid 3rd year where he was tenacious on D and his shot looked like it came together but how valuable that is to Orlando remains to be seen given the lack of extension.  I don&rsquo;t have that much to say about Jalen, he&rsquo;s good at what he does and it&rsquo;s kind of a surprise the Magic haven&rsquo;t locked him up to a long-term deal.</p>

<p><strong>Josh Giddey (6th overall):</strong>   There were a surprising number of recent trades involving the 2021 draft&rsquo;s selections but to keep it short, Giddey is not a part of the Bulls and it&rsquo;s likely they want to see what a Kiddey-led team looks like and how he fits into a Chicago team that&rsquo;s practically bursting with guards before they hand him a bag.</p>

<p><strong>Jonathan Kuminga (7th overall):</strong>  The Kum Bucket&rsquo;s name recently came up as being someone the Warriors are less attached to than 2023 rookie Brandin Podziemski.  This, coupled with him and the Warriors not seeing eye-to-eye on extensions and prior trade rumors suggests Johnathan might not spend the full season with Golden State though like Moses Moody, who that player they&rsquo;d be moved for is unclear.  Maybe a 3 teamer for some older roleplayers/starter-level players?</p>

<p><strong>Davion Mitchell (9th overall):</strong>  Mitchell was recently traded to the Raptors and while he&rsquo;s likely to be part of the rotation, his role as the backup point guard is in contention with the recently drafted Jamal Shead.  Needless to say, Mitchell is among the least likely of the players on this list to receive an extension when they&rsquo;ve yet to fully secure their role in a crowded Raptors backcourt.</p>

<p><strong>Ziaire Williams (10th overall)</strong>:  It speaks volumes to how disappointing Ziaire has been for Memphis that his role in the Grizzlies rotation was taken by a rookie who was, until the 2024 NBA Draft happened, the youngest player in the league (For those wondering, Raptors center Ulrich Chomche now holds that distinction) and &ldquo;Haver of a very cool name&rdquo; GG Jackson.</p>

<p>The fact that the Grizzlies traded up to get him when Trey Murphy III was picked using the selection they made only makes the choice look even worse in hindsight but Williams could very easily have a career rebound in Brooklyn&hellip;which if he does, it&rsquo;ll make the Grizzlies essentially dumping him for nothing look even worse than trading up to get him in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>James Bouknight (11th overall)</strong>:  This one feels like cheating to include but it technically counts because James Bouknight has not gotten an extension&hellip;mostly because the Hornets waived him.</p>

<p>And no one seems to want him or his drunk driving, lack of shooting presence in the locker room.  Not even the Clippers who signed&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Joshua Primo (12th overall)</strong>:  Again, technically cheating but technically does count since Primo hasn&rsquo;t gotten an extension.  Unlike the Hornet delinquent, the serial creep Josh is on an NBA roster as of this moment, with the Clippers signing him along with domestic abuser Kevin Porter Jr.</p>

<p><strong>Chris Duarte (13th overall)</strong>:  Remember how good Duarte was in his rookie year?  Yeah, the following 2 seasons were not as fortuitous, to the point where he became an afterthought in the DeMar DeRozan sign and trade and will likely be playing out his final rookie contract year with Chicago before hitting restricted free agency.  Will he have a bounceback on a Bulls team that is likely revving up the tank?  Who knows!</p>

<p><strong>Moses Moody (14th overall):</strong>  Rounding out this list is someone who it&rsquo;s hard to see them finishing on the team they were drafted by with how how much he&rsquo;s been included in trade talks.  Caruso is off the market but Moody and a pick is likely to be dangled in front of someone at the deadline.  The question is whether someone bites on such a deal.</p>

      <label for="lnu7t4z" class="commentText"><p>Not really, that seemed more like a &ldquo;someone else had an offer sheet to overpay for P-Will&rdquo; scenario and we never found out who that was (I know there were a few teams floated as suitors for Williams or even sign and trade partners).  Plus the Bulls aren&rsquo;t in a position where they can or should be letting talent go.  Better to overpay and trade him rather than lose an RFA.</p>

<p>Not every player has the same circumstances but while I think Kuminga and Suggs will get something closer to 20-25M AAV (Jalen Green&rsquo;s situation is&hellip;complicated), I think something closer to the MLE would be what a fair amount of them are looking at, if that - and this is setting aside the MLE in 2025 will be bigger than this offseason&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Like if these guys entered free agency today, I don&rsquo;t think - for example - Davion Mitchell gets over 10M AAV</p>

<p>Jalen Green is a weird case because how streaky he is, you can make an argument that he deserves a bag because if you squint you might see allstar potential there, but you gotta ignore a lot of meh times.</p>

      <label for="lnv2lvm" class="commentText"><p>The <sup>21</sup>&frasl;<sub>22</sub> was my first real season I followed from the beginning and I thought we would have a generational draft class the way everybody was talking about the top 5-10 and while the season was going on it was looking good with some steals in the later stages (Bones, Herb Jones, Ayo)</p>

<p>Now looking back on it in <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub> this draft class is looking a lil rough. At this point I would have thought we would have at least 3-4 all stars (Cade, Green, Scottie, Mobley) but a lot of players already regressed or never progressed or are out of the league or nearly out of the league because of dumb shit.</p>

      <label for="lnv3mh2" class="commentText"><p>To be fair, i&rsquo;s say Cade and Sengun have been playing at an All-Star, the problem is, aside from the general politics of All-Star selections&hellip;we&rsquo;re still using the same number of All-Star selections as they did since Lyndon B. Johnson was president despite the number of times the NBA has expanded since then.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s been that long.  It&rsquo;s way more competitive to become an All-Star and will become even more difficult when the NBA expands in 2026 or so.</p>

<p>Either the number needs to be increased per team or they need to change the format to be more like the Rising Stars where it&rsquo;s, like, 4 teams of 8 each who play in two win-or-go-home matches before having a final game with the winners of the two matches.</p>

      <label for="lnv5ao5" class="commentText"><p>I am actually in favor to increase the allstar selections from 12 to 15 for a few reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Team roster are now 15 players deep (ignoring the 3 two-way spots). Back in the day rosters used to be 12 players if I’m not mistaken.</p></li>

<li><p>It would push the narrative from the nba that they wanna get rid of tanking. Meaning: 15 players from east and west equal 30 players. Realistically (not really) there is a chance that one player from each team would make the all star game. The NBA would then say in interviews they are doing the best eliminating tanking by talking about how a 25 win team has an all star player in their team.</p></li>

<li><p>Makes All-NBA more prestigious. Simply put 15 players from 2 conferences equal 30. Divide that by 2 again makes 15 again, which makes the amount of players for all All-NBA teams.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If the expansion does happen I think your idea with the 4 teams for the all star game is reasonable and realistic.</p>

      <label for="lnu7x8u" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s really that odd. The bust rate for lottery talent in most draft classes is pretty dang near 50%.</p>

<p>From picks #9 to #13 it&rsquo;s basically all busts. Davion could still turn his career around, but the Raptors drafted Davion&rsquo;s clone with a second round pick, so even if Davion gets an extension, I can&rsquo;t imagine it&rsquo;d be a very lucrative one.</p>
