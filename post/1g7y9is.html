Who knows exactly how he would fare in today’s league but his play style is certainly not incompatible with how the game is played right now. I think it’s fair to assume he’d at least be one of the top 3 players in the game right now and he could very well be #1</p>

<p>People will hate, but I never saw enough to separate him from Bron. He was a force in the open court (with strict dribble rules too, dude was too smooth) and a great help defender, his jumper was good enough. Played a bit like Giannis does now.</p>

<p>Easily a top player, and with today&rsquo;s league, he would probably be more valuable because he would likely just play the 4 and smallball 5 and with his athleticism and hands in these open offenses, he would really thrive.</p>

<p>If you combine is ABA numbers, all of a sudden he is right there with the tippy top guys like everybody rated him back then. The hands too, can&rsquo;t discount those mitts</p>

      <label for="lsubssu" class="commentText"><p>My question is, why do the ABA numbers get discounted, when the NBA was also a clown shoes league in the 70s.  Kareem gets full credit for 4 MVPs in the NBA, Dr. J&rsquo;s 3 ABA MVPs get counted for nil, when the &ldquo;lists&rdquo; are done.</p>

<p>If one checks the tape on Dr. J with the Kentucky Colonels or the Nets, big afro Dr. J, like you said, he was a pretty big guy at 6&rsquo;7&rdquo;, had huge hands like oversized for his size, and was so smooth with it!  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLWGRDjuAIw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLWGRDjuAIw</a></p>

<p>He was better than say, Jayson Tatum, by like quite a bit (nothing against Tatum who is very good), he&rsquo;d be in the conversation for best in the league.  Not as big as LeBron, but played that &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t stop him from getting to the rim&rdquo;-type game, so that&rsquo;s not a bad comp.</p>

<p>.510 for his career from the floor, which is fucking sick.  Shoot, since he played in the ABA he shot 3&rsquo;s, which the nephews love the 3.  Shot 0.2 makes/game to 0.5 attempts/game one season lol, that&rsquo;s .395!</p>

      <label for="lsuduf2" class="commentText"><p>A lot of is old school attitudes (sooooooo plenty of general american racism lol). ABA was the more black league, the fast paced league, the league with the gimmicky 3point shot, the flashy ball and play style. Also the new kid on the block challenging the old money (Mikan was a huge part of the ABA, so they had basically the original star helping run things)</p>

<p>Dunking was literally banned by the NCAA because of Lew Alcinder (kareem), wilt had rules in college and NBA changed against him.</p>

<p>It was legit acceptable to undercut airborn players back then. Dunking was considered showboating and would get retaliated against at times. So many fans don&rsquo;t realize that when watching back then. Jumping was a big risk not taken lightly, but now guys on offense can do anything and get rewarded for somebody daring to be in their way.</p>

<p>That was more the 50s into the 60s, the ABA changed that drastically (for all of basketball, the nba kind of had to follow suit with the dunking and lighter officiaiting on offense)</p>

<p>Sooooooo, at the time the ABA was a major threat in a lot of ways, and it was heavily demonized and belittled, yet all those players were pretty much exactly as good in either league</p>

<p>by the 90s, the ABA was considered a joke league, but the entire decade of the 70s was brought down with it. Nobody counted Kareem&rsquo;s dominance for all that much because both leagues were considered watered down and full of drug issues.</p>

<p>Dr. J did all of this without being able to dislodge his defender, imagine that.</p>
