      <label for="lnpjunv" class="commentText"><p>I have to disagree with JR on this one. I think Rachel is barking up the right tree, Eastern Conference owners aren&rsquo;t going to vote to do a 1-16 seeding because most years you&rsquo;d see 9 or 10 West conference teams and potentially cost Eastern conference teams millions in playoff revenue every year.</p>

<p>But, I do agree with Pierce (felt weird even saying it) you would have to restructure the season as you would have to find a balance where teams play each other a little more evenly.</p>

<p>There wouldn&rsquo;t be divisions anymore but let&rsquo;s behonest they haven&rsquo;t mattered outside of one weird year I think where 2 teams had really good records.</p>

      <label for="lnpgc95" class="commentText"><p>&ldquo;Travel would be impossible&rdquo; is probably the worst excuse. This isn&rsquo;t the 1970s anymore, and if it was <em>such</em> an issue, the format could swap to be a 2-3-2 best of 7, with only two travel dates. MLB has two leagues that span across the country, so it usually happens that a team in the East has to play a full series against a team in the West. As far as I know it&rsquo;s never been a serious problem.</p>

<p>I do think there&rsquo;s something valuable in regional matchups and the history of the two conferences. As much as I hate playing Boston in the playoffs, I&rsquo;d hate not to play Boston in the playoff, or New York, or even Toronto. Maybe with the in-season tournament now there can be a separate emphasis on regional series, but the NBA playoffs have their own character, and I don&rsquo;t particularly want that to change.</p>

<p>Also, and this is just a personal thing, I think parity like that in general is kind of boring? Like, I get that it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;fair&rdquo; for a team in a stronger conference to miss out on the playoffs for a worse team that happened to suck the least out of a worse group. That&rsquo;s the game, though. In the NFL you can win 70% of your games and not be guaranteed a spot. Baseball teams have won 90+ games not to make the wildcard round. At the end of the season, everyone knows the stakes as they relate to themselves. Win your last 6 games for a shot at the play-in round, or whatever you need to do. The NBA season already feels like a long walk to the playoffs, when the &ldquo;real games&rdquo; start to matter. I think that getting rid of conference seeding would be on trend with that: being top-8 in your conference isn&rsquo;t as much of an accomplishment as being top-16 in the league, because what really matters is the tournament at the end to decide the one team that&rsquo;s better than all the other losers (and god forbid the best team doesn&rsquo;t get granted the easiest path).</p>

      <label for="lnpl8yo" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t even think this would help entertainment, we would get boring AF matchups in early rounds as the 1 seed sealclubs the 16 seed, the 2 seed dogwalks the 15 seed, and the 3 seed whacks the 14 seed, and so on. The idea is ultimately the 2 seed faces the 1 seed in the Finals but how is that better than a thrilling WCF/ECF then a Finals showdown? It&rsquo;s not. You have 82 games to make the playoffs and 7 games per round to advance. There are no fairytales. Everything comes out in the wash</p>

      <label for="lnptk74" class="commentText"><p>2 rounds, one home and one away, expand the league to ~34 teams, that’s 66 games for each team. Then you play an in season tournament that’s in your own conference until the finals, where everyone plays 8 group games + a KO tournament after to determine the winner. Winner gets the last pick of the first round. Allows teams to get some value from the in season tournament, players slightly more rest, without it being so much that tv revenue goes down. Structuring it this way gives more meaningful games, does away with strength of schedule bullshit (not teams playing the pistons 2 more times than other teams get to beat up on them), and with each game having more weight, viewership per game will go up.</p>

<p>Sure, that could change. But history suggests that it won&rsquo;t, and the east just has more perennially bad teams, due to some combination of bad markets and bad ownership, that also are less desirable to new ownership. Even drafting LeBron and Wade in the same year followed by Dwight the next year didn&rsquo;t shift the balance of power. </p>

<p>In the last 25 years, by my count, something like 16 teams have missed the playoffs while winning 43 games or more (or an equivalent winning percentage in shortened seasons), and 14 of those were in the west. </p>

<p>And if it did ever change, the western conference owners foe basically the same reason. </p>
