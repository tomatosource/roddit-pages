I think Rachel is barking up the right tree, Eastern Conference owners aren&rsquo;t going to vote to do a 1-16 seeding because most years you&rsquo;d see 9 or 10 West conference teams and potentially cost Eastern conference teams millions in playoff revenue every year.</p>

<p>But, I do agree with Pierce (felt weird even saying it) you would have to restructure the season as you would have to find a balance where teams play each other a little more evenly.</p>

<p>There wouldn&rsquo;t be divisions anymore but let&rsquo;s behonest they haven&rsquo;t mattered outside of one weird year I think where 2 teams had really good records.</p>

There is simply no common-ground if one side sees the real existential threats facing humanity, while the other is convinced that fabricated threats are imminent (assuming both sides aren&rsquo;t being misled).  How do you even begin to talk about reproductive rights to someone who believes God will eradicate the nation for not abolishing abortion?  How do you begin to work for trans rights when the opposition believes the only reason someone transitions is to abuse kids?</p>

People like Lauren Boebert are genuinely dumb as bricks but people like Ted Cruz absolutely are not, and you need to view the really stupid things they say through the lens that they&rsquo;re speaking to their audience of morons, and a lot more will make sense.</p>

<p>I would argue that having such close races 3 years in a row despite how unpopular their policy is across the board is a sign of the accomplishments of intelligent people steering the ship, rather than stupid people. No I don&rsquo;t think Trump is intelligent, but he&rsquo;s also not steering the ship either. Many aides report his attention span and reading level to be abysmally low. However when he&rsquo;s caught on hot mic unknowingly, he is still a bit more composed and grounded. Again, a sign that republican strategy involves manipulating their base to believe dumb things.</p>

<p>To an extent, the leadership is trapped by the electorate (who clearly favors Trump) and to an extent they&rsquo;re leading them.  Regardless, it doesn&rsquo;t really change the overall outcome.</p>

      <label for="lnr6t4z" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re misidentifying the problem. The Reapportionment Act of 1929 artificially capped the House of Representatives at 435 members (that then artificially caps the Electoral College size to 538)&ndash;a completely arbitrary number. The House (and therefore Electoral College) are supposed to grow every 10 years based on the results of the Census, but the 435 number is based on the 1910 Census. So eliminate that dumb law from a century ago, and the House will be more representative of the U.S. population, the Electoral College will be greatly improved (at which point we can actually take additional steps to improve it further or even work towards a Constitutional Amendment to eliminate it), and the Census will actually make sense again!</p>

      <label for="lns3746" class="commentText"><p>But because of the way our EC works, it doesn’t make a material difference there. Nearly every swing state is a midsize state whose proportionality wouldn’t really be affected. The states that would be fairly bumped down (WY, RI, DE, AK, VT, ND, SD etc) and up (CA, TX) - are all strong partisan places.</p>

<p>And your first statement has nothing to do with what Im talking about (the EC). Im v much supportive of expanding the house, but it won’t effectively do anything to the EC and promising such things will just avoid movement on real solutions there and disappoint others expecting changes in outcome. It takes a lot of work and political capital to make moves on these things. You must tie it to proportional state electors in order for it to affect the EC at all.</p>

<p>Teams on the West coast would have more 4pm games and make less revenue due to not having the sweet spot for primetime in their area. Teams like the Warriors, Kings, and Suns would get less games in the LA market.</p>

<p>People can try to hand wave away travel, but it <em>is</em> something that almost every team does want to cut down on, not just Eastern teams.</p>

<p>By &ldquo;cut down&rdquo; I guess I mean &ldquo;limit&rdquo;. Every team wants to limit travel, yes. Eastern teams don&rsquo;t want to increase travel and neither do Western teams. You think travel is bad now for Western teams? Wait until they have to go East a lot more. Sure it might help the edge cases, like the TWolves and Grizz, (one of which will likely be in the Eastern Conference after expansion anyway), but not the majority.</p>

      <label for="lnpylda" class="commentText"><p>Disagree, the balance of power between conferences at least can theoretically change so that the East is the better conference. Travel will always be a concern and TV will always be a concern. If the Celtics play the Warriors round 1 (or any other round) then you have one of the markets missing pretty much every game. If it’s in EST it’s too early for those in California and if it’s in PST it runs too late for those in MA. Right now that’s only a problem in the finals</p>

The top 1-3 teams in the league could all be in the East and it still play out as it has where the west had legit contenders and (most of) everyone else being solid playoff teams.</p>

<p>In this discussion, the top teams/contenders are largely irrelevant. Its all the rest. For most of the last 20ish years, the 5-10 of the West beats the shit out of 5-10 in the East.</p>

      <label for="lnqmapo" class="commentText"><p>You could instead chalk it up to ownership incompetence translating into front office incompetence.  For the longest time, for instance, the Knicks were managed horribly.  Assumed their market would attract talent instead of figuring out how to combine their market advantage with the basic competencies in scouting, drafting, and contract negotiation that other teams needed.  Finally they got out of that with Leon Rose.</p>

<p>The West has had a really strong executive advantage for 20 years with every team executing pretty good team-building (with exceptions of Minnesota until recently, Portland since their owner died, Sacramento while Vivek figured out how to be an owner) while Washington, Detroit, Charlotte, Brooklyn, Atlanta, and Chicago have been more than happy cycling through mediocre management.</p>

<p>Reseeding 1-16 would incentivize success more. You cannot fall into a playoff spot with 37 wins. Honestly, without COVID and the bubble, we would never have gotten the play-in for this very reason.</p>

      <label for="lnq7auw" class="commentText"><p>Travel isn&rsquo;t inconsequential because it <em>is</em> tied to money. The more travel between conferences, the less likely it is teams will be scheduled in the sweet spot for prime time in their area. Eastern teams will have more 10pm games and Western teams will have more 4pm games and both would lose out on revenue due to the scheduling.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you have to convince the Atlantic and Pacific divisions to face their own division teams less and thus make less money. For the Celtics, that means less games in the New York market, for the Warriors, that means less games in the LA market.</p>

<p>Travel expenses are a thing too, though that part of it might be inconsequential.</p>

<p>It might actually lead to more parity down the line and that means more playoff money when your team can actually compete. Probably won’t happen, but it could definitely be good for owners long term.</p>

<p>People want parity, that&rsquo;s parity. The issue is always how do you incentivize the owners to vote for the system, anyone will vote for it, so long as they see a benefit. Maybe bigger profit sharing for playoff revenue etc.</p>

      <label for="lnptk74" class="commentText"><p>2 rounds, one home and one away, expand the league to ~34 teams, that’s 66 games for each team. Then you play an in season tournament that’s in your own conference until the finals, where everyone plays 8 group games + a KO tournament after to determine the winner. Winner gets the last pick of the first round. Allows teams to get some value from the in season tournament, players slightly more rest, without it being so much that tv revenue goes down. Structuring it this way gives more meaningful games, does away with strength of schedule bullshit (not teams playing the pistons 2 more times than other teams get to beat up on them), and with each game having more weight, viewership per game will go up.</p>

Let two teams in, paying <span class="math inline">\(500 million in expansion fees each.  Each owner gets a 30th of \)</span>1 billion.  That&rsquo;s <span class="math inline">\(33.3 million (minus taxes), but they go from getting 1.66% of the TV revenue to 1.56% of the TV revenue.  From a \)</span>2.5 billion per year TV deal, that is giving up $2.6 million a year.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s basically taking a $33 million dollar loan at 7.8% interest, except the payments never stop, and get bigger over time instead of smaller.</p>

<p>Why would a billionaire do that over taking a $33 million dollar loan, the current 10 year fixed on a mortgage is about 6%, I&rsquo;m sure these owners could get a loan at that rate.</p>

<p>Now, there are reasons the league still wants to expand.  Their logic is that opening up new markets grows the league, and their hope is that by bringing two new franchises in, the league will grow faster than that 0.1% difference in TV revenue, so they make up for their diluted shares in increased growth, but it is giving up permanent shares for a chance at expanding growth on something that&rsquo;s already growing in value at a fantastic rate without dilution.  That&rsquo;s a pretty big risk, I can see why owners are playing it slow with expanding.</p>

Divide that by 30, that’s $122M.</p>

<p>If there’s 32 teams that number would be 107M. So they lose 15M annually. The losses of 15M would more be worth the 266M (133M per franchise). The 266 is 17x more than the loss. And spread the 266 over 17 years of “loss” (there would be new TV deals in that time) the valuation of their franchises would raise even more over that time. It seems to be worth it to me.</p>

      <label for="lnr9l8y" class="commentText"><p>Division rivalries in NFL &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Division rivalries in NBA &amp;gt; Conference rivalries in NBA &amp;gt; Conference rivalries in NFL &amp;gt; Cross Conference rivalries in NBA &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Cross Confefence rivalries in NFL.</p>

<p>It all comes down to exposure to teams and how much jockeying for playoff position matters. You get a home and away game against every other team in the NBA whereas the Patriots would only play in Green Bay once every 8 years for the most part. More than 10% of your games are against each division opponent in the NFL and your playoff position depends entirely on them, whereas less than 5% of your games are against any division foe in the NBA and they don’t mean shit for playoff positioning.</p>

<p>As a Boston fan, there’s a bigger rivalry with the Jets than there is with the Knicks or Nets. But in most cases we’re gonna have bigger rivalries with teams like the Cavs than the Browns because we play them most often. Only case where that gets reversed is like with the Colts when we were playing the almost every year and then a chunk of times in the playoffs, but now the rivalry with the Pacers is bigger.</p>

<p>Divisional rivalries mattered more when division winners were automatic top three in the playoffs, but having low 40 win teams being the three seed never made sense.</p>

      <label for="lnrmr6c" class="commentText"><p>I feel like division rivalries in the NBA are the least important. Playoff rivalries are the most and then player rivalries imo, such as the Nuggets and 76ers only being rivals because of Jokic and Embiid even though they have never played each other for anything important team wise</p>

      <label for="lnrujc5" class="commentText"><p>Surprised by division rivalries being higher for you than conference rivalries. With the playoffs seemingly being the only thing that matters in the NBA these days, those series seem to dominate conversations around rivalries much more than individual games during the regular season (though still less so than the NFL). Even with two good divisional opponents playing in the regular season, it&rsquo;s rarely &ldquo;this will be such a good game.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s usually &ldquo;could this be a preview of a playoff match up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like I care more when the Celtics play Toronto rather than Atlanta, but I also care more when they play the Lakers than either of them because there’s so much more playoff history there.</p>

      <label for="lnr9vka" class="commentText"><p>The big thing that people are also forgetting is timezones. You&rsquo;re really alienating your East coast fans, which is probably the bulk of NBA viewership, if 75% of playoff games are starting past 10:00PM EST. You get some flexibility for weekend games but starting any earlier than 7:00PM for a PST game on a weekday just isn&rsquo;t realistic. TV scheduling becomes harder because you end up with more overlapping games as well. There are so many reasons why this just wouldn&rsquo;t be practical for the fans, players and the league.</p>

      <label for="lnqfah0" class="commentText"><p>The article somebody else linked doesn’t make it sound like she said anything too bad, at least not about Maria Taylor.</p>

<p>She sounds, reading the quotes rather than listening, grouchy about it because it was in her contract to have that Finals role and Taylor replaced her. ESPN seems to have realized (at least internally) that they fucked up because both Taylor and Nichols got promotions and new contracts out of it.</p>

<p>It seems like the gripe is that they replaced a “diversity hire” in Nichols with a “more diversity hire” in Taylor just for the sake of saying “we’re more diverse!” Taylor isn’t more experienced, isn’t more qualified, isn’t more well-know.</p>

<p>The “do it someplace else” comment sounds like she’s complaining about ESPN not Taylor, saying that replacing a woman with a black woman doesn’t really solve the issues of diversity that plague ESPN.</p>

<p>And Nichols kind of has a point, I think. Replacing one of the top sports journalists (even acknowledging what I’d consider to be a drop off in the quality of her work leading up to it, any list of top sports journalists would surely include her) who has been a figure for not just good journalism but also diversity (since Maria Taylor was a teenager) with somebody else is a pretty eyebrow raising move by ESPN.</p>

<p>And expressing that shouldn’t mean a PR blow for Nichols. It should be for ESPN though.</p>

      <label for="lnr5uro" class="commentText"><p>The biggest criticism of Nichols is also basically that she didn&rsquo;t word her criticism as pointedly and eloquently as she could have. But it was someone recording a <em>private</em> conversation where she was venting. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ve all said things while venting that weren&rsquo;t carefully worded and that we wouldn&rsquo;t want shared publicly.</p>

      <label for="lnr6ock" class="commentText"><p>Right, exactly! I think if this were a public statement, there’s a way to say it to ensure that the criticism is of ESPN rather than Taylor.</p>

<p>Nichols was a badass sports journalist back when we couldn’t have named more female sports journalists than her and Erin Andrews. She paved the way for people like Maria Taylor.</p>

<p>So I think she’s got a decent point in saying, in effect, that they’re not solving their diversity problem by screwing her out of Finals coverage.</p>

<p>Edit: Eh, Linda Cohn, Robin Roberts, Andrea Kremer were doing their thing back then too. I should’ve thought harder about that. Still, it’s a short list.</p>

      <label for="lnpgc95" class="commentText"><p>&ldquo;Travel would be impossible&rdquo; is probably the worst excuse. This isn&rsquo;t the 1970s anymore, and if it was <em>such</em> an issue, the format could swap to be a 2-3-2 best of 7, with only two travel dates. MLB has two leagues that span across the country, so it usually happens that a team in the East has to play a full series against a team in the West. As far as I know it&rsquo;s never been a serious problem.</p>

<p>I do think there&rsquo;s something valuable in regional matchups and the history of the two conferences. As much as I hate playing Boston in the playoffs, I&rsquo;d hate not to play Boston in the playoff, or New York, or even Toronto. Maybe with the in-season tournament now there can be a separate emphasis on regional series, but the NBA playoffs have their own character, and I don&rsquo;t particularly want that to change.</p>

<p>Also, and this is just a personal thing, I think parity like that in general is kind of boring? Like, I get that it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;fair&rdquo; for a team in a stronger conference to miss out on the playoffs for a worse team that happened to suck the least out of a worse group. That&rsquo;s the game, though. In the NFL you can win 70% of your games and not be guaranteed a spot. Baseball teams have won 90+ games not to make the wildcard round. At the end of the season, everyone knows the stakes as they relate to themselves. Win your last 6 games for a shot at the play-in round, or whatever you need to do. The NBA season already feels like a long walk to the playoffs, when the &ldquo;real games&rdquo; start to matter. I think that getting rid of conference seeding would be on trend with that: being top-8 in your conference isn&rsquo;t as much of an accomplishment as being top-16 in the league, because what really matters is the tournament at the end to decide the one team that&rsquo;s better than all the other losers (and god forbid the best team doesn&rsquo;t get granted the easiest path).</p>

NFL had 7 teams in 2022 above .700, NBA has had 8 teams above .700 in the last 5 seasons combined . But both of those teams would’ve made the playoffs with the 7th seed.</p>

Outside the strike season of 82 where 2 made it, only 4 teams have made it with a losing record in the NFL. NBA has had over 50 teams make the playoffs with a losing record.</p>

<p>There’s absolutely nothing wrong with a conference system. And the benefits are terrific - it percolates regional rivalries that simply carry more weight than most matchups. We might even get a Boston-NY ECF this year, and if it happens the intensity is going to blow the doors off anything the league has seen in years.</p>

<p>Beaides, the conferences are rarely <em>that</em> lopsided, and the pendulum does swing. Even if the West has been better for a while, it won’t be forever, and the East has been plenty competitive at the top.</p>

The East is and has been a joke for far too long and rivalries are barely a thing anymore so that&rsquo;s the worst argument if they actually did anything meaningful with divisions and conferences then maybe but they don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Obviously teams from the east have won chips since then, but the west seems to be consistently stronger.</p>

      <label for="lnrhf1g" class="commentText"><p>mostly luck with a touch of skill from Jerry West and a couple of other GMs. This sport, more than most requires you to have an absolute top talent on your roster.  e.g. Duncan in SA, Curry in GS, Lebron in Cleveland</p>

<p>If you look at the west for the last 30 years, is a combo of Jerry West and pure luck giving the West such advantages (see examples above). First it was Magic et all in the 80s battling Bird (both lucked into those two players which helped them dominate the 90s).  West accounted for the majority of roster construction on the Lakers. He convinced Shaq to come over and managed to rangle Kobe to the Lakers. He was involved in the trade for the Gasol brothers from Lakers/Memphis (helping both teams to become good). This helped keep the Lakers dominant for many years. The Spurs on the other hand got super lucky &ndash; much like the Bulls &ndash; their main star goes out for the year &ndash; Robinson &ndash; and they suck so bad they get a good draft pick out of it, and pick up right where they left off (after getting Duncan). Both of those teams, aside from luck of the draft, also had great talent evaluators and exec that filled those other roster spots well.</p>

<p>West than was involved with the GSW. They got lucky in having Curry and also stumbling into Klay and Draymond&hellip; but it took a little fortune (injury helping DRaymond playing time) and West stepping in to cancel them getting rid of Klay for K. Love.  Without those successes maybe the Thunder face the Cavs and the Cavs may or may not beat them. In either case OKC is making the finals.</p>

<p>TL;DR - 1) Luck 2) good execs like West 3) Jerry f***ing West 4) luck</p>

      <label for="lns2ffj" class="commentText"><p>Alot of luck involved and the fact that the most attractive cities for young millionaires are in the West. No disrespect, but aside from Miami, people aren&rsquo;t exactly fighting to move out East, New York would be another option, but they just happen to have one of the worst owners in the entire sport.</p>

<p>Luck is the biggest factor though, in a 30 year window, the West drafted 4 of the 15 greatest players of all-time AND had Shaq for most of his prime aswell. There was a point in time where the West had three Top 10 players ever in their primes simultaneously, plus Kevin Garnett for good measure, i don&rsquo;t think that has ever happened before.</p>

<p>no idea what rachel says but that&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t have it.  they don&rsquo;t want to lose the NYK audience because all their games start at 11pm EST.</p>

      <label for="lnrvxv8" class="commentText"><p>Removing East-West would be a huge leap in the wrong direction by eliminating the already somewhat weak rivalries we have in the league. A similar misstep was the increased playoff games to a now 7 game series. Both concepts are similar because they are push towards “objectification” and the “right team winning”, whatever that means. Both concepts remove the personal/social appeal of sports which is rivalry and an underdog being able to win.</p>

      <label for="lns79x6" class="commentText"><p>The eastern conference would be forever FUCKED if the playoffs were just 1-16. The west is historically the way better conference and it probably always will be just because of how much bigger the markets are.</p>

<p>Also, conferences are really good for rivalries, which is a big part of sports in general.</p>
