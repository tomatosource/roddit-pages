I think Rachel is barking up the right tree, Eastern Conference owners aren&rsquo;t going to vote to do a 1-16 seeding because most years you&rsquo;d see 9 or 10 West conference teams and potentially cost Eastern conference teams millions in playoff revenue every year.</p>

<p>But, I do agree with Pierce (felt weird even saying it) you would have to restructure the season as you would have to find a balance where teams play each other a little more evenly.</p>

<p>There wouldn&rsquo;t be divisions anymore but let&rsquo;s behonest they haven&rsquo;t mattered outside of one weird year I think where 2 teams had really good records.</p>

<p>I would argue that having such close races 3 years in a row despite how unpopular their policy is across the board is a sign of the accomplishments of intelligent people steering the ship, rather than stupid people. No I don&rsquo;t think Trump is intelligent, but he&rsquo;s also not steering the ship either. Many aides report his attention span and reading level to be abysmally low. However when he&rsquo;s caught on hot mic unknowingly, he is still a bit more composed and grounded. Again, a sign that republican strategy involves manipulating their base to believe dumb things.</p>

<p>The electoral college is fine system if every State used in the same way Maine and Nebraska does. Making it winner take all is highly problematic.  I&rsquo;d take that system over FPP system in Canada where you can win a majority government with under 40% of the popular vote</p>

<p>It’s also logistically much more manageable. Imagine calling for a vote recount when there are hundreds of millions of voters to recount. It already took four extra days to call the last election simply because of my home state</p>

      <label for="lnqec0o" class="commentText"><p>Agreed. But so is a winner take all approach. The electoral college was put in so smaller states had a say in the election. But making it winner takes is hugely problematic. Restructuring it so 60% of the state&rsquo;s vote gets you 60% of the electoral college votes would be a good system. There&rsquo;s no perfect system so whatever is used will have issues, but a proportionate/ratioed electoral college would be solid.</p>

<p>But that is them departing from the winner take all electoral college that exists in other stakes, by breaking apart the state into smaller winner-take-all districts.</p>

<p>Keep going in that direction, to the smallest level, and those smallest units are individual people, and the winner is the winner of the popular vote.</p>

<p>The thing keeping the Electoral College alive is Conservatism. The Republicans have almost no chance to win a popular vote so long as they’re the party of moneyed interests and white grievance; their only path to victory is through a broken system they will perpetuate at all costs.</p>

<p>If we see Texas or Florida shift convincingly blue from their current red-lean without other states entering the realm of vulnerability and/or current swing states establishing themselves as further blue, we&rsquo;ll probably see a greater reallignment because Preisdential politics will otherwise be reduced to the democratic primary.</p>

      <label for="lnqer0y" class="commentText"><p>Right, so it&rsquo;s been 20 years since they won a popular vote.</p>

<p>What has happened to the party and electorate in those 20 years? Have they maybe changed in a way that makes them notably less likely to carry a popular vote? Perhaps the electorate is increasingly diverse while the party is increasingly insular.</p>

<p>The only reason they looked like they might have had a chance to take the popular vote against Biden is because people thought he might be senile in office with the nuclear codes and had gotten years to forget that Trump was a crazy person before he was back on TV every day again. As soon as they provided a viable alternative, it was pretty clear where the popular vote was going to go.</p>

<p>If they win it in 2028, they&rsquo;ll have either found an improved God-king Cult leader (because lest we forget, this one still hasn&rsquo;t and isn&rsquo;t going to win a popular vote) or fundamentally pivoted away from their decaying platform. Because there&rsquo;s fundamentally no part of it that can sustain a revival. This last breath of white Christian Nationalism <em>is</em> the revival, and it&rsquo;s failing.</p>

<p>Teams on the West coast would have more 4pm games and make less revenue due to not having the sweet spot for primetime in their area. Teams like the Warriors, Kings, and Suns would get less games in the LA market.</p>

<p>People can try to hand wave away travel, but it <em>is</em> something that almost every team does want to cut down on, not just Eastern teams.</p>

<p>By &ldquo;cut down&rdquo; I guess I mean &ldquo;limit&rdquo;. Every team wants to limit travel, yes. Eastern teams don&rsquo;t want to increase travel and neither do Western teams. You think travel is bad now for Western teams? Wait until they have to go East a lot more. Sure it might help the edge cases, like the TWolves and Grizz, (one of which will likely be in the Eastern Conference after expansion anyway), but not the majority.</p>

      <label for="lnpylda" class="commentText"><p>Disagree, the balance of power between conferences at least can theoretically change so that the East is the better conference. Travel will always be a concern and TV will always be a concern. If the Celtics play the Warriors round 1 (or any other round) then you have one of the markets missing pretty much every game. If it’s in EST it’s too early for those in California and if it’s in PST it runs too late for those in MA. Right now that’s only a problem in the finals</p>

The top 1-3 teams in the league could all be in the East and it still play out as it has where the west had legit contenders and (most of) everyone else being solid playoff teams.</p>

<p>In this discussion, the top teams/contenders are largely irrelevant. Its all the rest. For most of the last 20ish years, the 5-10 of the West beats the shit out of 5-10 in the East.</p>

      <label for="lnqmapo" class="commentText"><p>You could instead chalk it up to ownership incompetence translating into front office incompetence.  For the longest time, for instance, the Knicks were managed horribly.  Assumed their market would attract talent instead of figuring out how to combine their market advantage with the basic competencies in scouting, drafting, and contract negotiation that other teams needed.  Finally they got out of that with Leon Rose.</p>

<p>The West has had a really strong executive advantage for 20 years with every team executing pretty good team-building (with exceptions of Minnesota until recently, Portland since their owner died, Sacramento while Vivek figured out how to be an owner) while Washington, Detroit, Charlotte, Brooklyn, Atlanta, and Chicago have been more than happy cycling through mediocre management.</p>

<p>Reseeding 1-16 would incentivize success more. You cannot fall into a playoff spot with 37 wins. Honestly, without COVID and the bubble, we would never have gotten the play-in for this very reason.</p>

<p>Also this comment is stupid because it seems like people from each coast doesn&rsquo;t watch basketball played on the opposed coast, which is definitely not true, in particular for marquee matchup, which can be the case for a Play off series&hellip;</p>

<p>The East Coast people can just stay up late, but how are the West Coast folks supposed to catch the EST games when they are still at work or on their way home from work?</p>

<p>Making accommodations during the finals is one thing, but over the course of the year there would be significant revenue implications in addition to the significantly increased travel time, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like a good situation for anyone.</p>

<p>You know there is a fare amount of time when on the East Coast is not too late and the west coast guys are already out?? Again we are talking about 3 hours, not 12h of shift&hellip;</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you play 6 pm on the West Coast is 9 pm on the East! Wow! Some will work at 6 for sure, but this will happen always for any job.</p>

<p>Again you are taking to the extreme a concept. If you add just 1 game or 2 max in each regular season, and than we are adding some playoffs round is not the end of the world. We can go back to the previous finals 2-3-2 scheme to minimise travel time in those cross-conference playoffs, or come out with other ideas too.</p>

Games that usually start ~7:30 are now at 6 (west coast) or 9 (east coast), and for the plurality of Americans who live on the east coast, many casual fans aren’t going to stay up until past 11 to watch a basketball game. The people commenting here might, but we don’t represent the audience the NBA is trying to get.</p>

<p>And in general I would say that casual fans on the east coast don’t watch much of the western teams, not sure why you would think otherwise</p>

<p>These are the same people that won&rsquo;t watch a game if not anything else interesting is on, which in 2024 is sooo unlikely to happen&hellip; it is even stupid to follow a niche (which is most likely the majority), rather than creating an actual better product that could sell more by being structurally more interesting!!</p>

<p>Anyway a huge change that should happen is to severely shorten the games! The League think it is better to play 1.5h of commercial for a 48 minutes game is just pure blindness to what the current entertainment market is! I think people will be happy to pay more for less commercials and so more people are in and paying, and for those not paying commercials will sell at higher rate because more people are watching them!</p>

<p>So no more +3h games will fix this issue too, people will stay up till 11 if the game is so fun to stick around, they won&rsquo;t for 20 minutes of garbage time that become 1h</p>

      <label for="lnq49yh" class="commentText"><p>That would correct itself over time.  Biggest reason the conference imbalance is so sticky is that western teams are eliminated from playoffs earlier and incentivized to tank earlier and get assets for expiring veterans and all that.</p>

<p>And overall the higher standard for making the playoffs means western teams don&rsquo;t cash in assets to try to win until they&rsquo;ve shown a bit more.</p>

      <label for="lnq7auw" class="commentText"><p>Travel isn&rsquo;t inconsequential because it <em>is</em> tied to money. The more travel between conferences, the less likely it is teams will be scheduled in the sweet spot for prime time in their area. Eastern teams will have more 10pm games and Western teams will have more 4pm games and both would lose out on revenue due to the scheduling.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you have to convince the Atlantic and Pacific divisions to face their own division teams less and thus make less money. For the Celtics, that means less games in the New York market, for the Warriors, that means less games in the LA market.</p>

<p>Travel expenses are a thing too, though that part of it might be inconsequential.</p>

<p>It might actually lead to more parity down the line and that means more playoff money when your team can actually compete. Probably won’t happen, but it could definitely be good for owners long term.</p>

<p>But the league could get better and more interesting, with more RS games that matters and the weight of a W could be much higher and the playoffs being more appealing and balanced. So ultimately the League will gain more revenue and so the Owners will get more as a whole.</p>

Then you play an in season tournament that’s in your own conference until the finals, where everyone plays 8 group games + a KO tournament after to determine the winner. Winner gets the last pick of the first round. Allows teams to get some value from the in season tournament, players slightly more rest, without it being so much that tv revenue goes down. Structuring it this way gives more meaningful games, does away with strength of schedule bullshit (not teams playing the pistons 2 more times than other teams get to beat up on them), and with each game having more weight, viewership per game will go up.</p>

      <label for="lnq1q0u" class="commentText"><p>The league is taking years to expand from 30 to 32 teams because of the revenue and logistics required of just adding 2 franchises. It’s been talked about for a few years and is still expected by 2027.</p>

<p>We are nowhere close to 34 teams, I’d bet this doesn’t even happen by 2040.</p>

      <label for="lnqncr8" class="commentText"><p>Owners also don&rsquo;t want to dilute their share of TV/streaming revenue.  Let two teams in, paying <span class="math inline">\(500 million in expansion fees each.  Each owner gets a 30th of \)</span>1 billion.  That&rsquo;s <span class="math inline">\(33.3 million (minus taxes), but they go from getting 1.66% of the TV revenue to 1.56% of the TV revenue.  From a \)</span>2.5 billion per year TV deal, that is giving up $2.6 million a year.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s basically taking a $33 million dollar loan at 7.8% interest, except the payments never stop, and get bigger over time instead of smaller.</p>

<p>Why would a billionaire do that over taking a $33 million dollar loan, the current 10 year fixed on a mortgage is about 6%, I&rsquo;m sure these owners could get a loan at that rate.</p>

<p>Now, there are reasons the league still wants to expand.  Their logic is that opening up new markets grows the league, and their hope is that by bringing two new franchises in, the league will grow faster than that 0.1% difference in TV revenue, so they make up for their diluted shares in increased growth, but it is giving up permanent shares for a chance at expanding growth on something that&rsquo;s already growing in value at a fantastic rate without dilution.  That&rsquo;s a pretty big risk, I can see why owners are playing it slow with expanding.</p>

      <label for="lnqt8md" class="commentText"><p>It is expected that each expansion franchise would have to pay <span class="math inline">\(4B to the other owners. That’s \)</span>133M to each existing franchise. The TV deal was worth 76B over 11 years which is 6.9B annually. The owners get 49% of that which is 3.3B annually. Divide that by 30, that’s $122M.</p>

<p>If there’s 32 teams that number would be 107M. So they lose 15M annually. The losses of 15M would more be worth the 266M (133M per franchise). The 266 is 17x more than the loss. And spread the 266 over 17 years of “loss” (there would be new TV deals in that time) the valuation of their franchises would raise even more over that time. It seems to be worth it to me.</p>

<p>You are talking like this isn&rsquo;t an issue right now, while it is, so it is automatically not an issue in a future setting of direct 1-16. Also a different way of picking up the schedule could be made, through seeding of teams and random selection, rather than relying solely on divisions.</p>

      <label for="lnqq5yz" class="commentText"><p>Again it is already not fair with divisions being better than other. Playing everyone the same amount of time make also little sense from a practical point of view, as well as not adding many depth to the league itself.</p>

<p>For example from this year in the Champions League teams are still listed in a 36 team league and not everyone will play against everyone, but the teams are actually draw together to form the actual calendar. Granted that Europe has less time zones and much smaller distances and time of travel to deal with, a similar system to that could be implemented, as simply as the the current system with some a bit more randomness inside the same conference (let&rsquo;s say teams are divided into seeds rather than divisions inside a conference).</p>

<p>This is the part of the nfl I like where there are three teams you just face twice a season and you compete against them for a homecourt in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="lnpgc95" class="commentText"><p>&ldquo;Travel would be impossible&rdquo; is probably the worst excuse. This isn&rsquo;t the 1970s anymore, and if it was <em>such</em> an issue, the format could swap to be a 2-3-2 best of 7, with only two travel dates. MLB has two leagues that span across the country, so it usually happens that a team in the East has to play a full series against a team in the West. As far as I know it&rsquo;s never been a serious problem.</p>

<p>I do think there&rsquo;s something valuable in regional matchups and the history of the two conferences. As much as I hate playing Boston in the playoffs, I&rsquo;d hate not to play Boston in the playoff, or New York, or even Toronto. Maybe with the in-season tournament now there can be a separate emphasis on regional series, but the NBA playoffs have their own character, and I don&rsquo;t particularly want that to change.</p>

<p>Also, and this is just a personal thing, I think parity like that in general is kind of boring? Like, I get that it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;fair&rdquo; for a team in a stronger conference to miss out on the playoffs for a worse team that happened to suck the least out of a worse group. That&rsquo;s the game, though. In the NFL you can win 70% of your games and not be guaranteed a spot. Baseball teams have won 90+ games not to make the wildcard round. At the end of the season, everyone knows the stakes as they relate to themselves. Win your last 6 games for a shot at the play-in round, or whatever you need to do. The NBA season already feels like a long walk to the playoffs, when the &ldquo;real games&rdquo; start to matter. I think that getting rid of conference seeding would be on trend with that: being top-8 in your conference isn&rsquo;t as much of an accomplishment as being top-16 in the league, because what really matters is the tournament at the end to decide the one team that&rsquo;s better than all the other losers (and god forbid the best team doesn&rsquo;t get granted the easiest path).</p>

      <label for="lnpqjss" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve been looking at the historical standings., The new format would guarantee the best teams play the worst for the first round and I think that would be what makes it predictable, and thinking about it round 2 wouldn&rsquo;t be as bad. It would be an extended version of the West semis with all but the top 3 of East seeds wiped out in playins and Round 1</p>

      <label for="lnq2okg" class="commentText"><p>So you’re saying it’s more fair for the East top team (let’s say 60-22) to get the East bottom team (let’s say 46-36) and the west top team (let’s say 64-18) gets the west bottom team (let’s say 49-33), essentially giving the East top team the “easier” games even though they have a worse record than the west top team?</p>

<p>Again, you’re thinking in terms of “oh the number 1 gets the number 16… boring. That’s literally what happened this season though right? And traditionally the west has better teams that miss the playoffs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a microphone that is actively recording <strong>OR</strong> broadcasting, especially if it captures a comment or conversation that the speaker or speakers believed to be private (often used attributively): The reporter was suspended after her profanity was caught on a hot mic.</p>

Technology changes, people work remotely and forget their phone is still on or zoom camera or whatever. Hot mic encompasses all that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nichols was working/filming from a hotel room last May just as the NBA Playoffs were getting underway (due to the pandemic) and it appears she left her camera on somehow, and the thing was still recording when she had this chat with Mendelsohn &hellip; with the feed going back to the ESPN studio, where somebody captured the damning words exchanged.</p>

      <label for="lnqfah0" class="commentText"><p>The article somebody else linked doesn’t make it sound like she said anything too bad, at least not about Maria Taylor.</p>

<p>She sounds, reading the quotes rather than listening, grouchy about it because it was in her contract to have that Finals role and Taylor replaced her. ESPN seems to have realized (at least internally) that they fucked up because both Taylor and Nichols got promotions and new contracts out of it.</p>

<p>It seems like the gripe is that they replaced a “diversity hire” in Nichols with a “more diversity hire” in Taylor just for the sake of saying “we’re more diverse!” Taylor isn’t more experienced, isn’t more qualified, isn’t more well-know.</p>

<p>The “do it someplace else” comment sounds like she’s complaining about ESPN not Taylor, saying that replacing a woman with a black woman doesn’t really solve the issues of diversity that plague ESPN.</p>

<p>And Nichols kind of has a point, I think. Replacing one of the top sports journalists (even acknowledging what I’d consider to be a drop off in the quality of her work leading up to it, any list of top sports journalists would surely include her) who has been a figure for not just good journalism but also diversity (since Maria Taylor was a teenager) with somebody else is a pretty eyebrow raising move by ESPN.</p>

<p>And expressing that shouldn’t mean a PR blow for Nichols. It should be for ESPN though.</p>

      <label for="lnpy7fx" class="commentText"><p>Why do we try to over optimize everything in today’s society?</p>

<p>There’s absolutely nothing wrong with a conference system. And the benefits are terrific - it percolates regional rivalries that simply carry more weight than most matchups. We might even get a Boston-NY ECF this year, and if it happens the intensity is going to blow the doors off anything the league has seen in years.</p>

<p>Beaides, the conferences are rarely <em>that</em> lopsided, and the pendulum does swing. Even if the West has been better for a while, it won’t be forever, and the East has been plenty competitive at the top.</p>

      <label for="lnq07et" class="commentText"><p>Lol the conferences have been lopsided for like 25 years in a row. And it&rsquo;s a feedback loop, so the West will continue to dominate in the foreseeable future barring the East getting <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> top 50 all time players in back-to-back drafts.</p>

<p>Phrasing it the way you did is willful downplaying because you value tradition and your team getting a shot over competitive games.</p>

      <label for="lnq10qb" class="commentText"><p>False the conferences have been so lopsided top to bottom since 2000 and it&rsquo;s a self sustaining cycle West teams have to think better and smarter to improve their team sustainably to make playoff pushes and hone their skills by playing more Western teams who are on average better whereas Eastern teams can make shitty short term moves get in the playoffs easily and do nothing it&rsquo;s not coincidence that all the smart FOs are out West it&rsquo;s because they have to be survival of the fittest. The East is and has been a joke for far too long and rivalries are barely a thing anymore so that&rsquo;s the worst argument if they actually did anything meaningful with divisions and conferences then maybe but they don&rsquo;t.</p>

You&rsquo;re right rivalries are great&hellip; but they barely exist (with players moving frequently) or happen anymore even with the current system,&hellip; 1-16 you could still have those same atlantic rivalries just maybe in an earlier round. I would prefer 1-16 because you are seeing the best 4 teams in the semis instead of an indiana 4-0.</p>

<p>Obviously teams from the east have won chips since then, but the west seems to be consistently stronger.</p>

I guess it would have been a different story if the 36-46 Hawks had snuck in, but that&rsquo;s why they make it more difficult for the 9th and 10th play-in teams to make the playoffs.</p>

<p>Sure, that could change. But history suggests that it won&rsquo;t, and the east just has more perennially bad teams, due to some combination of bad markets and bad ownership, that also are less desirable to new ownership. Even drafting LeBron and Wade in the same year followed by Dwight the next year didn&rsquo;t shift the balance of power. </p>

<p>In the last 25 years, by my count, something like 16 teams have missed the playoffs while winning 43 games or more (or an equivalent winning percentage in shortened seasons), and 14 of those were in the west. </p>

<p>And if it did ever change, the western conference owners foe basically the same reason. </p>
