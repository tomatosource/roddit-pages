I think Rachel is barking up the right tree, Eastern Conference owners aren&rsquo;t going to vote to do a 1-16 seeding because most years you&rsquo;d see 9 or 10 West conference teams and potentially cost Eastern conference teams millions in playoff revenue every year.</p>

<p>But, I do agree with Pierce (felt weird even saying it) you would have to restructure the season as you would have to find a balance where teams play each other a little more evenly.</p>

<p>There wouldn&rsquo;t be divisions anymore but let&rsquo;s behonest they haven&rsquo;t mattered outside of one weird year I think where 2 teams had really good records.</p>

People like Lauren Boebert are genuinely dumb as bricks but people like Ted Cruz absolutely are not, and you need to view the really stupid things they say through the lens that they&rsquo;re speaking to their audience of morons, and a lot more will make sense.</p>

<p>I would argue that having such close races 3 years in a row despite how unpopular their policy is across the board is a sign of the accomplishments of intelligent people steering the ship, rather than stupid people. No I don&rsquo;t think Trump is intelligent, but he&rsquo;s also not steering the ship either. Many aides report his attention span and reading level to be abysmally low. However when he&rsquo;s caught on hot mic unknowingly, he is still a bit more composed and grounded. Again, a sign that republican strategy involves manipulating their base to believe dumb things.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t really a &ldquo;to an extent&rdquo; thing, this is how it always works for every politician. The fact that many on the left don&rsquo;t understand this it partly responsible for where we&rsquo;re at. Instead they ignore their power as voters and sit at home instead.</p>

The Reapportionment Act of 1929 artificially capped the House of Representatives at 435 members (that then artificially caps the Electoral College size to 538)&ndash;a completely arbitrary number. The House (and therefore Electoral College) are supposed to grow every 10 years based on the results of the Census, but the 435 number is based on the 1910 Census. So eliminate that dumb law from a century ago, and the House will be more representative of the U.S. population, the Electoral College will be greatly improved (at which point we can actually take additional steps to improve it further or even work towards a Constitutional Amendment to eliminate it), and the Census will actually make sense again!</p>

      <label for="lnr80wt" class="commentText"><p>Can’t the fact that only blue states signed it be seen as an attempted power grab by the left? How is the electoral college any less necessary, and how is an attempt to get rid of it by the left seen as a power grab by the right? You would literally only need to campaign in major cities and never address the need of any rural voters let alone visit them if the electoral college was banned. It’s been established rules of how we elect presidents, and because the left’s coalition is less likely to win via electoral vote (the established rules) than popular vote, the electoral college is no longer relevant?</p>

<p>Also none of these states that signed it are swing states, all solidly blue</p>

So why do you need it for the presidential election also? it just doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>

<p>a recent example - roe v wade. it affects individual people, not pieces of land. it would not have been overturned if not for the electoral college putting trump in office. there is no reason for things like that to be decided by people who live in rural areas.</p>

      <label for="lnrcjxv" class="commentText"><p>Because rural votes and city voters and people state to state have completely different interests. If you want a policy in your state vote for it in a local and state level and pass it in your state or city. This country literally wouldn’t exist without the compromise of 2 people in the senate. The fact is the president shouldn’t be changing your life locally nearly as much as your mayor or governor. Larger states still have more power than other states it’s just not 100% proportional to their population and just because one state has smaller population than the other doesn’t mean it’s concerns about who we elect as the country’s leaders should be ignored. People running for national office would simply ignore any issue that has below 50% approval rate and campaign solely in large cities, basically eliminating the national influence of rural voters and states. If you want change in your big city or state, do it locally. It’s much easier to get a consensus.</p>

<p>Pure democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting what to have for dinner. Why would you even ask the sheep if you can get enough votes from the wolves?</p>

<p>Edit: i also fail to see how changing the rules of the game because you’re losing is seen as less than a power grab than maintaining the 200 year established rule</p>

<p>doesn&rsquo;t this sentence make a lot more sense when you&rsquo;re talking about states with smaller populations? if we&rsquo;re voting on something that impacts everyone (like a president), it should be 1 vote for 1 person. If a state with a small population wants something the rest of the country does not want, then maybe that is something that should happen at the local level.</p>

And yes it does make sense obviously for smaller states as well to just vote locally. Everyone should be voted locally for the things that most concern them, but there is still national policy decisions and the national government can make laws that dictate how smaller states are run, and so to completely rid small state influence on the president would be crippling to them. A president could make all his decisions without the concern of smaller states because they have tiny influence in their getting elected. Each state has a right to have national influence, and it’s still true that larger states have more such so influence. It’s just not 100% proportional to population size, but still heavily influenced by population size</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s already like what you are saying, but with swing states mattering. they campaign in swing states over and over and if you&rsquo;re a republican in california, you might as well not vote because your vote doesn&rsquo;t matter and politicians don&rsquo;t care about your vote. if you&rsquo;re a democrat voter in wyoming, again you might as well not vote because republicans have won there for like 50 years straight or something.</p>

<p>moving to a popular vote would not &ldquo;completely rid small state influence,&rdquo; it would equalize human influence.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>and here&rsquo;s the thing though - states would not be voting for the president. People would be. a president should be making their decisions with the concern of the people because there are 400million people who have an influence on them getting elected.</p>

<p>Your argument fundamentally comes down to the idea that rural votes <em>should</em> matter more than city votes. Can you explain why you believe that? Why should some citizens votes matter more than others, and why isn&rsquo;t that fundamentally anti-democratic?</p>

You could win elections by simply catering 100% to what people in cities want and completely ignoring the wants of rural voters because you’re just racing to 51%. It would just be a president of the cities concerns. If the cities wanted a president to make an executive order to ban cows (just an example), the rural voters would be be helpless to stop it. You have to cater to many more issues and interests with the electoral college, which is a good thing</p>

      <label for="lnri6ia" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t actually hate the EC as much as some people.  I agree there are trade-offs, and there&rsquo;s some logic to it.  Ultimately, I think it would be better overall because it would force politicians to campaign all over the country rather than a handful of swing states.</p>

<p>But, the reason why I&rsquo;m a bit adamant about it right now is, yes, because it went from the popular vote and the EC winner being largely an anomaly that went back and forth, to one that clearly and continuously disadvantaged Democrats.  Whether you want to resolve that by reforming the EC or by going to popular vote is a reasonable question, but it&rsquo;s getting  absurd.</p>

<p>As for whether rural areas will be disadvantaged - maybe, maybe not.  There are lots of dynamics that will take place as parties reallign their priorities.  But, as I said, I think it pales in comparison to the fact that politicians largely only pay attention to swing states.</p>

<p>By &ldquo;cut down&rdquo; I guess I mean &ldquo;limit&rdquo;. Every team wants to limit travel, yes. Eastern teams don&rsquo;t want to increase travel and neither do Western teams. You think travel is bad now for Western teams? Wait until they have to go East a lot more. Sure it might help the edge cases, like the TWolves and Grizz, (one of which will likely be in the Eastern Conference after expansion anyway), but not the majority.</p>

If it’s in EST it’s too early for those in California and if it’s in PST it runs too late for those in MA. Right now that’s only a problem in the finals</p>

The top 1-3 teams in the league could all be in the East and it still play out as it has where the west had legit contenders and (most of) everyone else being solid playoff teams.</p>

<p>In this discussion, the top teams/contenders are largely irrelevant. Its all the rest. For most of the last 20ish years, the 5-10 of the West beats the shit out of 5-10 in the East.</p>

      <label for="lnqmapo" class="commentText"><p>You could instead chalk it up to ownership incompetence translating into front office incompetence.  For the longest time, for instance, the Knicks were managed horribly.  Assumed their market would attract talent instead of figuring out how to combine their market advantage with the basic competencies in scouting, drafting, and contract negotiation that other teams needed.  Finally they got out of that with Leon Rose.</p>

<p>The West has had a really strong executive advantage for 20 years with every team executing pretty good team-building (with exceptions of Minnesota until recently, Portland since their owner died, Sacramento while Vivek figured out how to be an owner) while Washington, Detroit, Charlotte, Brooklyn, Atlanta, and Chicago have been more than happy cycling through mediocre management.</p>

<p>Reseeding 1-16 would incentivize success more. You cannot fall into a playoff spot with 37 wins. Honestly, without COVID and the bubble, we would never have gotten the play-in for this very reason.</p>

<p>The East Coast people can just stay up late, but how are the West Coast folks supposed to catch the EST games when they are still at work or on their way home from work?</p>

<p>Making accommodations during the finals is one thing, but over the course of the year there would be significant revenue implications in addition to the significantly increased travel time, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like a good situation for anyone.</p>

<p>You know there is a fare amount of time when on the East Coast is not too late and the west coast guys are already out?? Again we are talking about 3 hours, not 12h of shift&hellip;</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you play 6 pm on the West Coast is 9 pm on the East! Wow! Some will work at 6 for sure, but this will happen always for any job.</p>

<p>Again you are taking to the extreme a concept. If you add just 1 game or 2 max in each regular season, and than we are adding some playoffs round is not the end of the world. We can go back to the previous finals 2-3-2 scheme to minimise travel time in those cross-conference playoffs, or come out with other ideas too.</p>

<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got people getting home from the game <em>well</em> after midnight which is problematic for a ton of fans, particularly during the work week.  That comes back around to ticket sales.</p>

<p>First of all if those people being out watching games doesn&rsquo;t really count as audience to begin with because many people watch from a single or few screens. If you are talking about home crowd go to the second point, but also it is even worse with current scheduling.</p>

<p>Second, the other elephant in the room here is games during 3+ hours, which should be fixed by reducing f commercials and making the game more fluid.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Also here you really don&rsquo;t need to sacrifice neither ticket nor viewership.</p>

<p>And you are doing it for much better product overall. It is not to admit the Nola or the Kings of this world to play 1 round and that&rsquo;s it. This shows a lack of awareness of what a 1-16 playoffs will mean. You will have better team playing each other overall, and on top of that you have a better bracket too! So every single series is much better! Also this will add more unpredictability making the RS more important and more valuable. Just like the play in added a layer of complex to the season too!</p>

<p>Saying it is a marginal upside is either delusional  or said with bad faith.</p>

Games that usually start ~7:30 are now at 6 (west coast) or 9 (east coast), and for the plurality of Americans who live on the east coast, many casual fans aren’t going to stay up until past 11 to watch a basketball game. The people commenting here might, but we don’t represent the audience the NBA is trying to get.</p>

<p>And in general I would say that casual fans on the east coast don’t watch much of the western teams, not sure why you would think otherwise</p>

<p>These are the same people that won&rsquo;t watch a game if not anything else interesting is on, which in 2024 is sooo unlikely to happen&hellip; it is even stupid to follow a niche (which is most likely the majority), rather than creating an actual better product that could sell more by being structurally more interesting!!</p>

<p>Anyway a huge change that should happen is to severely shorten the games! The League think it is better to play 1.5h of commercial for a 48 minutes game is just pure blindness to what the current entertainment market is! I think people will be happy to pay more for less commercials and so more people are in and paying, and for those not paying commercials will sell at higher rate because more people are watching them!</p>

<p>So no more +3h games will fix this issue too, people will stay up till 11 if the game is so fun to stick around, they won&rsquo;t for 20 minutes of garbage time that become 1h</p>

<p>And overall the higher standard for making the playoffs means western teams don&rsquo;t cash in assets to try to win until they&rsquo;ve shown a bit more.</p>

      <label for="lnq7auw" class="commentText"><p>Travel isn&rsquo;t inconsequential because it <em>is</em> tied to money. The more travel between conferences, the less likely it is teams will be scheduled in the sweet spot for prime time in their area. Eastern teams will have more 10pm games and Western teams will have more 4pm games and both would lose out on revenue due to the scheduling.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you have to convince the Atlantic and Pacific divisions to face their own division teams less and thus make less money. For the Celtics, that means less games in the New York market, for the Warriors, that means less games in the LA market.</p>

<p>Travel expenses are a thing too, though that part of it might be inconsequential.</p>

<p>Look - if they let NY, Philly, Boston outspend (without batshit crazy fines) they might go for this structure because they might believe they have an economic advantage. When they can’t wield that economically because of forced parity, there’s no reason to vote against their own interests.</p>

<p>It might actually lead to more parity down the line and that means more playoff money when your team can actually compete. Probably won’t happen, but it could definitely be good for owners long term.</p>

<p>Eastern Conference owners aren&rsquo;t going to vote to do a 1-16 seeding because most years you&rsquo;d see 9 or 10 West conference teams and potentially cost Eastern conference teams millions in playoff revenue every year.</p>

<p>But the league could get better and more interesting, with more RS games that matters and the weight of a W could be much higher and the playoffs being more appealing and balanced. So ultimately the League will gain more revenue and so the Owners will get more as a whole.</p>

<p>Seems like that situation where some scared to lose a bit will scare the whole package to gain more!</p>

      <label for="lnptk74" class="commentText"><p>2 rounds, one home and one away, expand the league to ~34 teams, that’s 66 games for each team. Then you play an in season tournament that’s in your own conference until the finals, where everyone plays 8 group games + a KO tournament after to determine the winner. Winner gets the last pick of the first round. Allows teams to get some value from the in season tournament, players slightly more rest, without it being so much that tv revenue goes down. Structuring it this way gives more meaningful games, does away with strength of schedule bullshit (not teams playing the pistons 2 more times than other teams get to beat up on them), and with each game having more weight, viewership per game will go up.</p>

      <label for="lnqncr8" class="commentText"><p>Owners also don&rsquo;t want to dilute their share of TV/streaming revenue.  Let two teams in, paying <span class="math inline">\(500 million in expansion fees each.  Each owner gets a 30th of \)</span>1 billion.  That&rsquo;s <span class="math inline">\(33.3 million (minus taxes), but they go from getting 1.66% of the TV revenue to 1.56% of the TV revenue.  From a \)</span>2.5 billion per year TV deal, that is giving up $2.6 million a year.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s basically taking a $33 million dollar loan at 7.8% interest, except the payments never stop, and get bigger over time instead of smaller.</p>

<p>Why would a billionaire do that over taking a $33 million dollar loan, the current 10 year fixed on a mortgage is about 6%, I&rsquo;m sure these owners could get a loan at that rate.</p>

<p>Now, there are reasons the league still wants to expand.  Their logic is that opening up new markets grows the league, and their hope is that by bringing two new franchises in, the league will grow faster than that 0.1% difference in TV revenue, so they make up for their diluted shares in increased growth, but it is giving up permanent shares for a chance at expanding growth on something that&rsquo;s already growing in value at a fantastic rate without dilution.  That&rsquo;s a pretty big risk, I can see why owners are playing it slow with expanding.</p>

That’s \)</span>133M to each existing franchise. The TV deal was worth 76B over 11 years which is 6.9B annually. The owners get 49% of that which is 3.3B annually. Divide that by 30, that’s $122M.</p>

<p>If there’s 32 teams that number would be 107M. So they lose 15M annually. The losses of 15M would more be worth the 266M (133M per franchise). The 266 is 17x more than the loss. And spread the 266 over 17 years of “loss” (there would be new TV deals in that time) the valuation of their franchises would raise even more over that time. It seems to be worth it to me.</p>

<p>It all comes down to exposure to teams and how much jockeying for playoff position matters. You get a home and away game against every other team in the NBA whereas the Patriots would only play in Green Bay once every 8 years for the most part. More than 10% of your games are against each division opponent in the NFL and your playoff position depends entirely on them, whereas less than 5% of your games are against any division foe in the NBA and they don’t mean shit for playoff positioning.</p>

<p>As a Boston fan, there’s a bigger rivalry with the Jets than there is with the Knicks or Nets. But in most cases we’re gonna have bigger rivalries with teams like the Cavs than the Browns because we play them most often. Only case where that gets reversed is like with the Colts when we were playing the almost every year and then a chunk of times in the playoffs, but now the rivalry with the Pacers is bigger.</p>

<p>Divisional rivalries mattered more when division winners were automatic top three in the playoffs, but having low 40 win teams being the three seed never made sense.</p>

You&rsquo;re really alienating your East coast fans, which is probably the bulk of NBA viewership, if 75% of playoff games are starting past 10:00PM EST. You get some flexibility for weekend games but starting any earlier than 7:00PM for a PST game on a weekday just isn&rsquo;t realistic. TV scheduling becomes harder because you end up with more overlapping games as well. There are so many reasons why this just wouldn&rsquo;t be practical for the fans, players and the league.</p>

      <label for="lnpgc95" class="commentText"><p>&ldquo;Travel would be impossible&rdquo; is probably the worst excuse. This isn&rsquo;t the 1970s anymore, and if it was <em>such</em> an issue, the format could swap to be a 2-3-2 best of 7, with only two travel dates. MLB has two leagues that span across the country, so it usually happens that a team in the East has to play a full series against a team in the West. As far as I know it&rsquo;s never been a serious problem.</p>

<p>I do think there&rsquo;s something valuable in regional matchups and the history of the two conferences. As much as I hate playing Boston in the playoffs, I&rsquo;d hate not to play Boston in the playoff, or New York, or even Toronto. Maybe with the in-season tournament now there can be a separate emphasis on regional series, but the NBA playoffs have their own character, and I don&rsquo;t particularly want that to change.</p>

<p>Also, and this is just a personal thing, I think parity like that in general is kind of boring? Like, I get that it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;fair&rdquo; for a team in a stronger conference to miss out on the playoffs for a worse team that happened to suck the least out of a worse group. That&rsquo;s the game, though. In the NFL you can win 70% of your games and not be guaranteed a spot. Baseball teams have won 90+ games not to make the wildcard round. At the end of the season, everyone knows the stakes as they relate to themselves. Win your last 6 games for a shot at the play-in round, or whatever you need to do. The NBA season already feels like a long walk to the playoffs, when the &ldquo;real games&rdquo; start to matter. I think that getting rid of conference seeding would be on trend with that: being top-8 in your conference isn&rsquo;t as much of an accomplishment as being top-16 in the league, because what really matters is the tournament at the end to decide the one team that&rsquo;s better than all the other losers (and god forbid the best team doesn&rsquo;t get granted the easiest path).</p>

      <label for="lnqfah0" class="commentText"><p>The article somebody else linked doesn’t make it sound like she said anything too bad, at least not about Maria Taylor.</p>

<p>She sounds, reading the quotes rather than listening, grouchy about it because it was in her contract to have that Finals role and Taylor replaced her. ESPN seems to have realized (at least internally) that they fucked up because both Taylor and Nichols got promotions and new contracts out of it.</p>

<p>It seems like the gripe is that they replaced a “diversity hire” in Nichols with a “more diversity hire” in Taylor just for the sake of saying “we’re more diverse!” Taylor isn’t more experienced, isn’t more qualified, isn’t more well-know.</p>

<p>The “do it someplace else” comment sounds like she’s complaining about ESPN not Taylor, saying that replacing a woman with a black woman doesn’t really solve the issues of diversity that plague ESPN.</p>

<p>And Nichols kind of has a point, I think. Replacing one of the top sports journalists (even acknowledging what I’d consider to be a drop off in the quality of her work leading up to it, any list of top sports journalists would surely include her) who has been a figure for not just good journalism but also diversity (since Maria Taylor was a teenager) with somebody else is a pretty eyebrow raising move by ESPN.</p>

<p>And expressing that shouldn’t mean a PR blow for Nichols. It should be for ESPN though.</p>

      <label for="lnr5uro" class="commentText"><p>The biggest criticism of Nichols is also basically that she didn&rsquo;t word her criticism as pointedly and eloquently as she could have. But it was someone recording a <em>private</em> conversation where she was venting. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ve all said things while venting that weren&rsquo;t carefully worded and that we wouldn&rsquo;t want shared publicly.</p>

      <label for="lnr6ock" class="commentText"><p>Right, exactly! I think if this were a public statement, there’s a way to say it to ensure that the criticism is of ESPN rather than Taylor.</p>

<p>Nichols was a badass sports journalist back when we couldn’t have named more female sports journalists than her and Erin Andrews. She paved the way for people like Maria Taylor.</p>

<p>So I think she’s got a decent point in saying, in effect, that they’re not solving their diversity problem by screwing her out of Finals coverage.</p>

<p>Edit: Eh, Linda Cohn, Robin Roberts, Andrea Kremer were doing their thing back then too. I should’ve thought harder about that. Still, it’s a short list.</p>

<p>You can’t pick the 4th place team. The 1 seed can choose between the 5-8 the 2 seed chooses between the remaining 3. The 3 seed chooses between the remaining 2. The 4 seed gets what is left over.</p>

<p>For example last year. Maybe OKC decides that they don’t want to play the Pelicans and instead want to match up with the Suns</p>

<p>Denver picks the Lakers cause they owned them all year</p>

<p>Minny decides they have an easy matchup with the Mavs cause of their size.</p>

<p>Leave the 4th place Clippers to play against the 8th place Pelicans. Make sense now?</p>

<p>There’s absolutely nothing wrong with a conference system. And the benefits are terrific - it percolates regional rivalries that simply carry more weight than most matchups. We might even get a Boston-NY ECF this year, and if it happens the intensity is going to blow the doors off anything the league has seen in years.</p>

<p>Beaides, the conferences are rarely <em>that</em> lopsided, and the pendulum does swing. Even if the West has been better for a while, it won’t be forever, and the East has been plenty competitive at the top.</p>

      <label for="lnq10qb" class="commentText"><p>False the conferences have been so lopsided top to bottom since 2000 and it&rsquo;s a self sustaining cycle West teams have to think better and smarter to improve their team sustainably to make playoff pushes and hone their skills by playing more Western teams who are on average better whereas Eastern teams can make shitty short term moves get in the playoffs easily and do nothing it&rsquo;s not coincidence that all the smart FOs are out West it&rsquo;s because they have to be survival of the fittest. The East is and has been a joke for far too long and rivalries are barely a thing anymore so that&rsquo;s the worst argument if they actually did anything meaningful with divisions and conferences then maybe but they don&rsquo;t.</p>

      <label for="lnq0lpi" class="commentText"><p>Its just a suggestion to make the playoffs more exciting&hellip; the issue we have is that normally the west is a bloodbath while the east is a comparative cake walk&hellip; was boston the best team&hellip; probably, but it would have been a lot more exciting if they had to play the same level of competition the mavs or the nuggets had to play. You&rsquo;re right rivalries are great&hellip; but they barely exist (with players moving frequently) or happen anymore even with the current system,&hellip; 1-16 you could still have those same atlantic rivalries just maybe in an earlier round. I would prefer 1-16 because you are seeing the best 4 teams in the semis instead of an indiana 4-0.</p>

      <label for="lnqf9xv" class="commentText"><p>I get that the bottom of the East is ass, but the 8th place Heat (46-36) finished 10 games above .500 last year, while the 8th place Lakers finished just one game above them (47-35). I guess it would have been a different story if the 36-46 Hawks had snuck in, but that&rsquo;s why they make it more difficult for the 9th and 10th play-in teams to make the playoffs.</p>

<p>Obviously teams from the east have won chips since then, but the west seems to be consistently stronger.</p>

      <label for="lnrhf1g" class="commentText"><p>mostly luck with a touch of skill from Jerry West and a couple of other GMs. This sport, more than most requires you to have an absolute top talent on your roster.  e.g. Duncan in SA, Curry in GS, Lebron in Cleveland</p>

<p>If you look at the west for the last 30 years, is a combo of Jerry West and pure luck giving the West such advantages (see examples above). First it was Magic et all in the 80s battling Bird (both lucked into those two players which helped them dominate the 90s).  West accounted for the majority of roster construction on the Lakers. He convinced Shaq to come over and managed to rangle Kobe to the Lakers. He was involved in the trade for the Gasol brothers from Lakers/Memphis (helping both teams to become good). This helped keep the Lakers dominant for many years. The Spurs on the other hand got super lucky &ndash; much like the Bulls &ndash; their main star goes out for the year &ndash; Robinson &ndash; and they suck so bad they get a good draft pick out of it, and pick up right where they left off (after getting Duncan). Both of those teams, aside from luck of the draft, also had great talent evaluators and exec that filled those other roster spots well.</p>

<p>West than was involved with the GSW. They got lucky in having Curry and also stumbling into Klay and Draymond&hellip; but it took a little fortune (injury helping DRaymond playing time) and West stepping in to cancel them getting rid of Klay for K. Love.  Without those successes maybe the Thunder face the Cavs and the Cavs may or may not beat them. In either case OKC is making the finals.</p>

<p>TL;DR - 1) Luck 2) good execs like West 3) Jerry f***ing West 4) luck</p>

      <label for="lnqxuf5" class="commentText"><p>The west is a more desirable place to do business - the value in buying teams has been better, the growth potential has been better, even the population growth has been more (one speculates the taxes are more favorable in western small markets than eastern small markets).</p>

<p>So the owners who really want to make their teams better, who also want to win in business by buying at a good price and increasing the value of their teams, have disproportionately bought teams in the West or moved them there.</p>

<p>10 current teams in the West either expanded there or moved to their current location there since 1975, compared to only 6 teams in the East. And the expansion teams in the West each have times since then of being notably good. They have a total of 7 finals wins across 3 teams.</p>

<p>Whereas the only expansion team in the East that has been consistently good has been the Heat. There are 4 rings in the East across 2 expansion teams, and nobody from outside the East has moved there. More teams in the East have been in their current setup longer, have a more entrenched fanbase with less growth potential, might even be in struggling or shrinking cities, might have more liabilities or more difficult tax situations or histories with local governments.</p>

<p>There are more teams in the East that are just stuck being mediocre for long periods that nobody really wants to try to improve and that nobody would buy because they are too expensive. The fact that for a long time at least two of them have been two of the flagship teams in the NBA, the Bulls and the Knicks (thankfully the Knicks are getting better recently), is a pretty big factor in the difference.</p>

<p>But also you can have a lot more hope for a franchise like the Pelicans, which moved to where it is on purpose and seems to be making moves, than the Wizards, who pretty much are what they are and don&rsquo;t seem to be going anywhere or doing anything.</p>

<p>Expanded and relocated teams since 1975 in their current form by conference -</p>

<p><strong>West</strong></p>

<p>Nuggets - 1 finals, 1 win</p>

<p>Spurs - 6 finals, 5 wins</p>

<p>Mavs - 3 finals, 1 win</p>

<p>Pelicans</p>

<p>Wolves</p>

<p>Grizzlies</p>

<p>Kings</p>

<p>Thunder - 1 final</p>

<p>Jazz - 2 finals</p>

<p><strong>East</strong></p>

<p>Heat - 7 finals, 3 wins</p>

<p>Pacers - 1 finals, 0 wins</p>

<p>Nets</p>

<p>Hornets (Bobcats)</p>

<p>Magic - 2 finals, 0 wins</p>

<p>Raptors - 1 finals, 1 win</p>

      <label for="lnrims3" class="commentText"><p>If the 16 spot playoff brackets were determined by records and not conference it would be interesting since it would rank the best teams overall for the playoffs. For example in the early 2000&rsquo;s the West teams were so good you needed about 47-50 wins to make the 8th spot. Most west teams would be in the playoffs at that time.</p>

      <label for="lnpo9uc" class="commentText"><p>They haven&rsquo;t for basically the last 25 years. This clip is from 3 or 4 years ago, and nothing has changed since.  </p>

<p>Sure, that could change. But history suggests that it won&rsquo;t, and the east just has more perennially bad teams, due to some combination of bad markets and bad ownership, that also are less desirable to new ownership. Even drafting LeBron and Wade in the same year followed by Dwight the next year didn&rsquo;t shift the balance of power. </p>

<p>In the last 25 years, by my count, something like 16 teams have missed the playoffs while winning 43 games or more (or an equivalent winning percentage in shortened seasons), and 14 of those were in the west. </p>

<p>And if it did ever change, the western conference owners foe basically the same reason. </p>

<p>It would be extremely interesting, in the NFL for example, to have &ldquo;division&rdquo; rivals play a SB. But it&rsquo;s not gonna happen because money.</p>

<p>At least NBA doesn&rsquo;t have the participation trophies that are division championships. I forget what you call whoever wins their group (like AFC east). Is it division champion? Anyway, that&rsquo;s a participation trophy. Shit, so is the semi final winner trophy.</p>

<p>The Nets maybe not but more than that Portland team or the Kings that are very popular to discuss in NBA circles but maybe not so much among casuals</p>
