      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1feidpd/how_well_do_you_all_think_zach_lavine_coby_white/"><p>How well do you all think Zach LaVine, Coby White, and Josh Giddey will mesh on the floor together for the Chicago Bulls?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>As we all know, the Bulls made an attempt to trade Zach LaVine during the offseason but found no takers. They were resigned fairly early into the offseason that LaVine would not be moved and preparing themselves to carry him on the roster going into the season ahead.</p>

<p>Now news has come out of an overall attempt at mending fences and healing tensions throughout the summer between the Bulls FO, Billy Donovan, and Zach LaVine. Karnisovas came forward and said the front office didn&rsquo;t have appetite for a full scale teardown and wouldn&rsquo;t trade LaVine for pennies on the dollar. So here we are, with training camps set to open in a few weeks, with LaVine still on the Bulls roster.</p>

<p>The Bulls moved on from DeRozan and traded Caruso for Giddey. Coby White had a breakout campaign last season in a featured offensive role and is someone who can score without heavy usage, but how he adjusts to playing with LaVine who may be playing to prove himself and will probably look at this team as His, will be interesting to watch. Giddey is a talented playmaker and had a good run for Team Australia in Olympic comp but he has his notable warts. LaVine can pass, but he&rsquo;s not quite the playmaker DeMar has become historically. He&rsquo;s not a natural decision maker, or at least hasn&rsquo;t shown that he is up to this point, specifically when he&rsquo;s been the #1 option in Chicago.</p>

<p>How well do you think these three will mesh on the floor together?</p>

      <label for="lmnmsx6" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m struggling to even think of a hypothetical scenario where a team would trade for Lavine mid-season.</p>

<p>Even if he plays better, he&rsquo;s still an injury risk, he&rsquo;s still got the same warts he&rsquo;s always had as a player, and he&rsquo;s still got that awful contract.  And trading mid-season makes it almost impossible to absorb a $45M salary.</p>

<p>Only thing I can even remotely envision is the Nets doing something dumb like moving Simmons expiring contract for Lavine because they convince themselves they have a shot at the play-in.</p>

      <label for="lmnonbd" class="commentText"><p>Nets got their picks back so they can tank, Lavine hasn’t really shown he helps a team win games as a featured player either.</p>

<p>It’s harsh to say because his talent level exceeds this, but his ideal role seems to be as a super 6th man. But I don’t think he settles into that role until he’s off his current deal, his contract is prohibitive for that</p>

      <label for="lmo5rh5" class="commentText"><p>LaVine and Brandon Ingram are very similar, not in play but just in their current status as NBA players. Obviously both can play and can give you 20+ points a night &hellip; but that&rsquo;s kinda it. There hasn&rsquo;t been a ton of proof that either help you win or really help your offense, which sounds funny scoring 20+ ppg but in the NBA you gotta help other people score too. And with the amount of money they make or want to make most teams just don&rsquo;t see the need for it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very interested to see what happens with both in the next couple years, Julius Randle is going to be in a similar situation while not totally being the same kind of player.</p>

      <label for="lmnztr2" class="commentText"><p>i mean i don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything in particular about those three players that doesn&rsquo;t <em>fit,</em> they&rsquo;re just not very good for a &ldquo;big 3&rdquo; (heavy air quotes)</p>

<p>like LaVine and Coby are both high-level shooters, it&rsquo;s not like they don&rsquo;t fit next to a non-spacing playmaker like Giddey. i also think LaVine&rsquo;s probably a little underrated due to his health last season (and his big-ass contract). but just in general the issue is that none of them area really good enough to be a #1 guy, and none of them give you much on defense</p>

      <label for="lmnk26v" class="commentText"><p>even with draft capital, I have no idea how they&rsquo;ll manage it. 2nd apron teams (Suns, Wolves, Celtics Bucks) can&rsquo;t aggregate salaries in a trade this year. 1st apron teams (Lakers, Heat, Nuggets, 76ers, Knicks) can&rsquo;t take back more money then they send, so would have to cobble together the full $43m in matching salaries.</p>

<p>Then you have the teams who are hard capped at the 1st apron. That&rsquo;s the Hawks, Nets, Mavs, Warriors, Rockets, Clippers, Pelicans, Thunder, Kings, Raptors, and Wizards, not to mention the Bulls themselves. That&rsquo;s 22 out of 29 teams (besides Chicago) who are seriously trade and financially limited this coming season.</p>

<p>Miamis got tons of salary filler to get it done.</p>

<p>Tyler herro is hurt just like Zach Lavine every year except herro is a one trick pony. All he does is shoot 3s. He can’t finish inside. He has horrible defense.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lavine is hurt all the time but he shoots just as well as herro and can finish at the rim at a above avg rate</p>

But I&rsquo;m hopeful they are not a total disaster and end up giving the spurs the 11th pick this year so lets go bulls!</p>

      <label for="lmo198b" class="commentText"><p>Below 3 is below average for an off ball floor spacing guard. Find me another spot up guard of Lavine’s caliber  that shoots that few.</p>

<p>The one year Lonzo was healthy Zo shot 5.5 per game. Lavine shot 2.8 per game. What’s the excuse then? Same thing with Coby this year.</p>

<p>His whole volume comes from him taking off the dribble 3s. Lavine does not move to relocate for better passing angles when he is off ball. And he’s not good enough with the ball in his hands to be a primary offensive option. Which explains why he’s generated 0 trade interest for 2+ years now.</p>

And he was on the bulls with demar vuc pat will caruso why would his 3s be any different sure he can up his cns volume to what it used to be ig. He can move offball tho clearly</p>

<p>He’s a very efficient 24-25ppg scorer he’s good enough to be a 2. Basically bigger Tyrese Maxey as far as im concerned</p>

Same with Kyrie, both are smart and effective ball handlers, so they both deserve a more on ball role. Lavine is an absolutely atrocious decision maker with the ball in his hands. The entire league is telling you what Lavine’s value is. Good teams, bad teams, smart teams, dumb teams. Nobody wants that baggage. If he was making half his contract it would be different. But he’s paid like a top 20 player and he’s probably not even top 50.</p>

      <label for="lmo99g2" class="commentText"><p>Tbh I am very sceptical about them planning any future for now. Bulls were completely demolished defensively in the time LaVine played without Caruso, they only ended up 22nd in defensive rating because of conceding way fewer points in Caruso minutes. Like the big benefit of Caruso in that team was that you could also play LaVine thanks to him.</p>

<p>Offensively he&rsquo;s been a though fit for anyone, a play-ender who doesn&rsquo;t feel the play and act off-ball. I imagine he will do his thing, and the team will play theirs and they will manage some results. Giddey more or less fits in for DeRozan in the used lineup, he was mostly defending big wings last season, the Trey Murphy, Wiggins, Michael Porter types, and only the least scoring-focused point guards if any. But the defense is a big question mark imo.</p>

      <label for="lmp6w14" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t see why it wouldn&rsquo;t work offensively. If your playing two shooting guards, then a point forward like Giddey is what you&rsquo;d ask for. If it doesn&rsquo;t work with Giddey, then Giddey probably didn&rsquo;t work out.</p>

<p>Defensively it&rsquo;s a disaster. Not having a single viable POA defender 1-3 with Vucevic at center is beyond cooked. Patrick Williams gonna be out there fighting all by himself.</p>

<p>The only viable way to play defensively would be switching everywhere and avoiding screening action, but you&rsquo;d still be involving Coby, Zach, or Giddey in every play, which they&rsquo;ll mess up. And if you wanted to play Buzelis at the 5 you&rsquo;re small with a rookie center which is again cooked.</p>

      <label for="lmpg4u2" class="commentText"><p>The biggest issue with them meshing isn&rsquo;t either of the three but the coaching and the Chicago system. Giddey works best with players moving to feed them on cuts or open shots. Chicago doesn&rsquo;t. Chicago plays like 5 guys who met at a pickup game just standing around to wait for their turn because that&rsquo;s our system.</p>

<p>Chicago is 30th in cuts.</p>

<p>Chicago is 30th in off-ball screens.</p>

<p>Chicago is 28th in pace.</p>

<p>Chicago just doesn&rsquo;t want people moving their feet. It&rsquo;s almost like the offense was designed for two slow half court guys in their mid 30s who need a system where you don&rsquo;t move too much and spam mid range shots.</p>
