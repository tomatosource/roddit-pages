<p>Despite what people say, the league was pretty even from 2010-16 with multiple great teams having a shot. The KD move is what changed things and it was a product of a very unique situation (Curry&rsquo;s low contract and a historic cap spike). This likely won&rsquo;t ever happen again (I hope), so I think the league will continue to have high parity.</p>

      <label for="l6v7jgv" class="commentText"><p>KD joined a 73-9 team that were 2 possessions away from repeating. Lebron teamed up with another unproven star in Bosh and Wade who won a ring with an entire set of players that were no longer on the team and with a new, unproven coach. Lebron choked the first year, but those Heat teams could&rsquo;ve still lost even with him playing well. The only way GSW could fail is if they got injured which is what happened in 2019.</p>

<p>Thinking that Lebron and KD&rsquo;s moves were in way the same is a gross oversimplification that ignores all the other factors surrounding both moves. But this is sports, so I guess it&rsquo;s easy to ignore those things when it goes against a player you don&rsquo;t like</p>

      <label for="l6v8eyx" class="commentText"><p>KD&rsquo;s move was worse but that doesn&rsquo;t also mean that Lebron&rsquo;s move didnt have a huge negative effect on parity. from 2004-2010 you had the celtics, pistons, cavs, magic, heat all fighting to come out of the east, after the decision it was pretty much a formality that Lebron&rsquo;s superteam would be winning the east and half of the playoffs were now meaningless.</p>

<p>KD&rsquo;s move was also a response to Lebron&rsquo;s move, in the same way that Lebron one-upped the Celtics old mid-30s
 superteam by forming a superteam with 3 prime superstars KD one-upped Lebrons 3 prime superstars with 4 prime superstars. Without Lebron&rsquo;s move there is no KD move to GS.</p>

      <label for="l6v7jp4" class="commentText"><p>What does East vs West have to do with any of this? We&rsquo;re talking about the parity of the entire league. In 2011, there were several teams (Heat, Mavs, Spurs, Lakers, etc) that had a shot at the title just like this year. In 2017, there was one, maybe two. Let&rsquo;s not pretend those those moves were the same thing.</p>

      <label for="l6v36n6" class="commentText"><p>First of all, that&rsquo;s wrong (the Bulls and Celtics, and even Pacers were definitely contenders). Second of all, we&rsquo;re looking at the entire league, not just one conference. If we use your logic, this year didn&rsquo;t have parity because the Boston was the only contender in the East (doesn&rsquo;t make sense). I&rsquo;m not sure why you&rsquo;re trying to turn this into a LeBron convo for no reason.</p>

      <label for="l6v41cp" class="commentText"><p>Bulls were barely a contender, for 1 year at best with a 22 year old DRose pre-injury. Celtics were old and declining, especially after KG&rsquo;s knee surgeries. and then Heat even took Ray Allen from them lol. Pacers were definitely not contenders and would&rsquo;ve gotten smashed by any West team</p>

<p>Celtics had a very easy run this year but mostly due to injuries of stars of other teams</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just debating your logic that the KD move is when parity ended when it started when Lebron went superteam jumping. the Harden/CP3 Rockets and Kawhi Spurs in the KD-Warriors era would clear pretty much any team Lebron&rsquo;s superteams faced</p>

      <label for="l6v4xyx" class="commentText"><p>The league wasn&rsquo;t decided when Lebron decided to team up with the Heat and with the Cavs. He got pushed to the brink almost every year. Whether that&rsquo;s him or his team underperforming is irrelevant when talking about parity. The fact is they were very much beatable every time. In 2016, the Spurs/OKC/GSW/Cavs were all seen as somewhat equal contenders. In 2017, it was GSW&rsquo;s ring to lose. In 2018, they got pushed to the brink by the Rockets, but I&rsquo;d argue that series ends quicker if Iguodala doesn&rsquo;t get injured. In 2019, they would&rsquo;ve ran through the Raptors if KD doesn&rsquo;t get injured. KD&rsquo;s move to GSW was not the same as Lebron&rsquo;s</p>

If you want to slight Lebron for underperforming, I don&rsquo;t really care since I&rsquo;m not a Lebron fan. The facts are those Heat teams were very beatable every year, and a lot of things went their way even in their best year for them to win. That wasn&rsquo;t the case with GSW who ran through every team when healthy the moment KD was added. The team that went 73-9 and were 2 possessions away from repeating replaced their weakest starter with Kevin Durant. An unproven Bosh/Lebron teamed up with Wade who won a ring with a squad that was completely gone, with a new coach, and was a sub-50 win team in a weak conference. The circumstances and parity of the league by those moves were not the same</p>

<p>I personally don’t see anyone on the trajectory of a Lebron or Kobe. We will still see very dominant players like Luka. But we are still trying to find out who the true best player in the world is. And they probably won’t be able to run it to the NBA Finals 3 times in a row like Lebron and Kobe have both done. And that’s a combination of the competition being spread out AND the fact that anyone in the league right now being at the level of peak Kobe or Lebron is a stretch.</p>

      <label for="l6v1pic" class="commentText"><p>The NBA, in the new CBA, basically put the kibosh on a team drafting multiple hall of famers, building around them, and keeping the group together. In order to pay everyone what they’re worth, teams are going to have to pay crazy high tax bills, and then you have the media trying to break up every group of good players unless they’re on LA or NY. Most owners won’t pay through the nose like that unless they’re guaranteed a sure thing, which is extremely rare, and teams/players lack patience to build something from the ground up when they can just hop from team to team</p>

<p>They saw all the success and popularity the Warriors had, and decided we don’t want that again.</p>

      <label for="l6v3ec1" class="commentText"><p>Obviously those are probably my favorite teams ever, but I can understand that from a neutral fan’s perspective. But my point was that with today’s CBA even the pre KD warriors team probably wouldn’t stay together as long as they did. Good chance one of Klay/Draymond/Iguodala would be gone to save on the huge tax penalties and get under the 2nd apron, etc. If they kept the big 3 they would lose a lot of depth (and no KD). Teams like OKC, Memphis, Orlando who have done exactly what youre supposed to do by drafting extremely well and built young cores will all have serious financial decisions to make in the coming years. I would like to see more teams grow into winning rather than just haphazardly assembling stars, this cba makes it harder</p>

      <label for="l6v4fwo" class="commentText"><p>The Warriors pre-KD were fortunate enough with the timing of Curry&rsquo;s extension and him exploding into the unanimous MVP. By the end of 2016, he was the 5th most paid player. If he got the max extension that Luka/Ant/Ja/Tatum see, they would&rsquo;ve had a lot harder time keeping all of Klay/Draymond/Iggy/Bogut for those first few years.</p>

<p>The new CBA prevents team hopping and superteams from forming too. Players are looking to get paid more than ever and aren&rsquo;t willing to take paycuts or get duped into signing lower than their perceived market value</p>

      <label for="l6v7llm" class="commentText"><p>Disagree. Draymond and Klay were both signed to relatively team-friendly contracts that would’ve been way below the max. Even with Steph on a super max, the Warriors would’ve easily been able to keep everyone together. They would’ve even have been over the second apron</p>

      <label for="l6v88qo" class="commentText"><p>Draymond and Klay occupied 42% of the Warriors capspace in 2016. Iggy and Bogut occupied another 35%. Curry only occupied 16%. If we compare that to a player like Ja Morant today who occupies 26%, they would&rsquo;ve had to make moves to move some players when all those players had their FA up in 2017, and they wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to get KD even with the capspike.</p>

The 2014 Nets should’ve showed everyone that a big 3 can’t always win titles. Not to mention the Heat underachieving and the big 3 Celtics winning only 1 ring</p>

      <label for="l6v1tgm" class="commentText"><p>Kinda just depends on what happens with Boston and OKC in my opinion. Both teams have the talent that’s either just entering or still not in their prime and they both have it locked up for the long run too. They’re also both blessed with arguably the two best FOs in basketball. If I had to make a guess I’d say they each win their conference the most times over the next 5 years but that could also only be 1-2 times</p>

You spend 3-4 years cultivating a squad to go and win a championship and then lose a couple good role players to bigger contracts or one of the stars loses a step or worse, gets injured and no one can step in and the dynamic falls apart.</p>

<p>And then when all of those things happen they fire the head coach to appease whoever and they have to start the cultivation all over again. Its pretty ridiculous.</p>
