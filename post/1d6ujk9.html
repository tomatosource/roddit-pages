<p>Despite what people say, the league was pretty even from 2010-16 with multiple great teams having a shot. The KD move is what changed things and it was a product of a very unique situation (Curry&rsquo;s low contract and a historic cap spike). This likely won&rsquo;t ever happen again (I hope), so I think the league will continue to have high parity.</p>

      <label for="l6v7jgv" class="commentText"><p>KD joined a 73-9 team that were 2 possessions away from repeating. Lebron teamed up with another unproven star in Bosh and Wade who won a ring with an entire set of players that were no longer on the team and with a new, unproven coach. Lebron choked the first year, but those Heat teams could&rsquo;ve still lost even with him playing well. The only way GSW could fail is if they got injured which is what happened in 2019.</p>

<p>Thinking that Lebron and KD&rsquo;s moves were in way the same is a gross oversimplification that ignores all the other factors surrounding both moves. But this is sports, so I guess it&rsquo;s easy to ignore those things when it goes against a player you don&rsquo;t like</p>

      <label for="l6v8eyx" class="commentText"><p>KD&rsquo;s move was worse but that doesn&rsquo;t also mean that Lebron&rsquo;s move didnt have a huge negative effect on parity. from 2004-2010 you had the celtics, pistons, cavs, magic, heat all fighting to come out of the east, after the decision it was pretty much a formality that Lebron&rsquo;s superteam would be winning the east and half of the playoffs were now meaningless.</p>

<p>KD&rsquo;s move was also a response to Lebron&rsquo;s move, in the same way that Lebron one-upped the Celtics old mid-30s
 superteam by forming a superteam with 3 prime late-20s  superstars KD one-upped Lebrons 3 prime superstars with 4 prime superstars. Without Lebron&rsquo;s move there is no KD move to GS.</p>

Celtics were a 50-win team in 2010 and the number 4 seed in the conference and huge underdogs to Lebron&rsquo;s cavs teams in the second round, they were not some unbeatable entity like people make them out to be, in no universe could they even be described as a dynasty. And they were only going to get worse as they got older, not better.</p>

<p>You can say KD was &ldquo;inspired&rdquo; by Lebron, but KD joined a 73-9 win team that already won one without him. It was never his team even when he won FMVP. The Nets superteam was more similar to what Lebron did in Miami and Cleveland. Thinking that KD &ldquo;wanted to one up Lebron&rsquo;s superteam&rdquo; with his own, which was never his to begin with, is a huge jump</p>

<p>well yeah when you form a superteam with 3 of the 5 best players in your conference then the rest of the teams in the conference tend to be weak.</p>

The relationship the Heat had the with the rest of the conference at the time is independent of the Celtics/Pistons/Magic just being stronger teams than the 2013 Pacers or 2018 Raptors. In a vacuum, those 2000s teams win solidly against those 2010 Eastern teams</p>

Second of all, we&rsquo;re looking at the entire league, not just one conference. If we use your logic, this year didn&rsquo;t have parity because the Boston was the only contender in the East (doesn&rsquo;t make sense).

Celtics were old and declining, especially after KG&rsquo;s knee surgeries. and then Heat even took Ray Allen from them lol. Pacers were definitely not contenders and would&rsquo;ve gotten smashed by any West team</p>

<p>Celtics had a very easy run this year but mostly due to injuries of stars of other teams</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just debating your logic that the KD move is when parity ended when it started when Lebron went superteam jumping. the Harden/CP3 Rockets and Kawhi Spurs in the KD-Warriors era would clear pretty much any team Lebron&rsquo;s superteams faced</p>

Whether that&rsquo;s him or his team underperforming is irrelevant when talking about parity. The fact is they were very much beatable every time. In 2016, the Spurs/OKC/GSW/Cavs were all seen as somewhat equal contenders. In 2017, it was GSW&rsquo;s ring to lose. In 2018, they got pushed to the brink by the Rockets, but I&rsquo;d argue that series ends quicker if Iguodala doesn&rsquo;t get injured. In 2019, they would&rsquo;ve ran through the Raptors if KD doesn&rsquo;t get injured. KD&rsquo;s move to GSW was not the same as Lebron&rsquo;s</p>

      <label for="l6v65vk" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not sure what you&rsquo;re saying. If you want to slight Lebron for underperforming, I don&rsquo;t really care since I&rsquo;m not a Lebron fan. The facts are those Heat teams were very beatable every year, and a lot of things went their way even in their best year for them to win. That wasn&rsquo;t the case with GSW who ran through every team when healthy the moment KD was added. The team that went 73-9 and were 2 possessions away from repeating replaced their weakest starter with Kevin Durant. An unproven Bosh/Lebron teamed up with Wade who won a ring with a squad that was completely gone, with a new coach, and was a sub-50 win team in a weak conference. The circumstances and parity of the league by those moves were not the same</p>

I think there&rsquo;s a huge difference between Iggy playing, and having to disperse some minutes to Jordan Bell, but hey, you&rsquo;re the GSW so tell me. Also extrapolating one half of the first game onto a 7 game series is crazy work</p>

Many of the best players in the nba are not American and seem to have less desire to market themselves to a US audience. That’s a bigger reason for Finals rating decline than the fact that the Warriors were a dynasty, imo.</p>

Both teams have the talent that’s either just entering or still not in their prime and they both have it locked up for the long run too. They’re also both blessed with arguably the two best FOs in basketball. If I had to make a guess I’d say they each win their conference the most times over the next 5 years but that could also only be 1-2 times</p>

<p>The whole process of rebuilding post Westbrook has been so impressive I see little to no reason to think it&rsquo;ll go sour, and very little way the rest of the NBA can compete in a trade with OKC. They were miles ahead of schedule this year</p>

<p>I personally don’t see anyone on the trajectory of a Lebron or Kobe. We will still see very dominant players like Luka. But we are still trying to find out who the true best player in the world is. And they probably won’t be able to run it to the NBA Finals 3 times in a row like Lebron and Kobe have both done. And that’s a combination of the competition being spread out AND the fact that anyone in the league right now being at the level of peak Kobe or Lebron is a stretch.</p>

      <label for="l6v1pic" class="commentText"><p>The NBA, in the new CBA, basically put the kibosh on a team drafting multiple hall of famers, building around them, and keeping the group together. In order to pay everyone what they’re worth, teams are going to have to pay crazy high tax bills, and then you have the media trying to break up every group of good players unless they’re on LA or NY. Most owners won’t pay through the nose like that unless they’re guaranteed a sure thing, which is extremely rare, and teams/players lack patience to build something from the ground up when they can just hop from team to team</p>

<p>They saw all the success and popularity the Warriors had, and decided we don’t want that again.</p>

      <label for="l6v3ec1" class="commentText"><p>Obviously those are probably my favorite teams ever, but I can understand that from a neutral fan’s perspective. But my point was that with today’s CBA even the pre KD warriors team probably wouldn’t stay together as long as they did. Good chance one of Klay/Draymond/Iguodala would be gone to save on the huge tax penalties and get under the 2nd apron, etc. If they kept the big 3 they would lose a lot of depth (and no KD). Teams like OKC, Memphis, Orlando who have done exactly what youre supposed to do by drafting extremely well and built young cores will all have serious financial decisions to make in the coming years. I would like to see more teams grow into winning rather than just haphazardly assembling stars, this cba makes it harder</p>

      <label for="l6v4fwo" class="commentText"><p>The Warriors pre-KD were fortunate enough with the timing of Curry&rsquo;s extension and him exploding into the unanimous MVP. By the end of 2016, he was the 5th most paid player. If he got the max extension that Luka/Ant/Ja/Tatum see, they would&rsquo;ve had a lot harder time keeping all of Klay/Draymond/Iggy/Bogut for those first few years.</p>

<p>The new CBA prevents team hopping and superteams from forming too. Players are looking to get paid more than ever and aren&rsquo;t willing to take paycuts or get duped into signing lower than their perceived market value</p>

      <label for="l6v7llm" class="commentText"><p>Disagree. Draymond and Klay were both signed to relatively team-friendly contracts that would’ve been way below the max. Even with Steph on a super max, the Warriors would’ve easily been able to keep everyone together. They would’ve even have been over the second apron</p>

      <label for="l6v88qo" class="commentText"><p>Draymond and Klay occupied 42% of the Warriors capspace in 2016. Iggy and Bogut occupied another 35%. Curry only occupied 16%. If we compare that to a player like Ja Morant today who occupies 26%, they would&rsquo;ve had to make moves to move some players when all those players had their FA up in 2017, and they wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to get KD even with the capspike.</p>

      <label for="l6vsfgo" class="commentText"><p>If the main three cycled getting paid (Curry discount first, then Dray and then Klay), so they all miss out on a max for five years of their best, maybe.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you can&rsquo;t put a team around it. And KD is a non-option, and you don&rsquo;t get Barnes-KD-DLo-Wiggins either, because your fourth and fifth are Bogut/Livingston/Looney tier at best, or one year rehabilitations (which the Warriors did do well with overall, to be fair (GP2, Otto, McGee etc.)</p>

<p>You might keep it together until Dray/Klay need to be paid after Curry gets his max. Then you probably need to flip one, or flip both.</p>

<p>Jokic
Luka
Tatum
SGA
Giannis</p>

<p>Two of the top 5 are in the finals this year.</p>

      <label for="l6v2aw3" class="commentText"><p>The influx of dominant European/foreign players who tend to be loyal and show no desire to join super teams will ensure an era of parity</p>

<p>Not to mention there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be many American born dominant players on the horizon.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to see another AD &ldquo;That&rsquo;s All Folks!&rdquo; situation in New Orleans for a while - other than maybe Ja or Zion&hellip;&hellip;..but let&rsquo;s be honest, neither are on old AD&rsquo;s level.</p>
