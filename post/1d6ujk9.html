      <label for="l6uzw32" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re gonna exit one.</p>

<p>Despite what people say, the league was pretty even from 2010-16 with multiple great teams having a shot. The KD move is what changed things and it was a product of a very unique situation (Curry&rsquo;s low contract and a historic cap spike). This likely won&rsquo;t ever happen again (I hope), so I think the league will continue to have high parity.</p>

      <label for="l6v7jgv" class="commentText"><p>KD joined a 73-9 team that were 2 possessions away from repeating. Lebron teamed up with another unproven star in Bosh and Wade who won a ring with an entire set of players that were no longer on the team and with a new, unproven coach. Lebron choked the first year, but those Heat teams could&rsquo;ve still lost even with him playing well. The only way GSW could fail is if they got injured which is what happened in 2019.</p>

<p>Thinking that Lebron and KD&rsquo;s moves were in way the same is a gross oversimplification that ignores all the other factors surrounding both moves. But this is sports, so I guess it&rsquo;s easy to ignore those things when it goes against a player you don&rsquo;t like</p>

<p>KD&rsquo;s move was also a response to Lebron&rsquo;s move, in the same way that Lebron one-upped the Celtics old mid-30s
 superteam by forming a superteam with 3 prime late-20s  superstars KD one-upped Lebrons 3 prime superstars with 4 prime superstars. Without Lebron&rsquo;s move there is no KD move to GS.</p>

That&rsquo;s par for the course today but most players in the 2000&rsquo;s began their descent at that age. Them joining forces was considered a last ditch attempt to win something (after many many attempts) before the 3 of them got too old to do so.</p>

<p>If we&rsquo;re talking about the time they came together Rondo also shouldn&rsquo;t matter here. He was entering his sophomore year after a rookie year where he averaged 6/3/3. No one expected him to become as good as he became.</p>

<p>You can say KD was &ldquo;inspired&rdquo; by Lebron, but KD joined a 73-9 win team that already won one without him. It was never his team even when he won FMVP. The Nets superteam was more similar to what Lebron did in Miami and Cleveland. Thinking that KD &ldquo;wanted to one up Lebron&rsquo;s superteam&rdquo; with his own, which was never his to begin with, is a huge jump</p>

      <label for="l6w35xj" class="commentText"><p>KD&rsquo;s move was objectively worse but you&rsquo;re also very much letting Lebron off the hook here. Lebron and Wade were 2 of the 3-5 best players in the league when they joined forces. Bosh was a 5 time All Star by the age of 25 and had already made All NBA and finished top 7 in MVP voting one year when they joined forces. He was by a country mile the best 3rd option in the league. The year prior to joining the Heat he averaged <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> which was excellent back then.</p>

<p>Further, all 3 of them played in the East already prior to joining the Heat so them teaming up weakened the rest of the conference as a whole.</p>

<p>At the time they joined forces they absolutely believed that the league would be a cakewalk similar to how it was for the KD-Warriors hence the (not 1 not 2 not 3 etc. speech). 3 players that good had never joined forces in their peaks the same way they did.</p>

Wiggins was considered a generational prospect at the time and was arguably the most hyped prospect since Lebron at that point. He knew he would either have Wiggins or the team would be able to flip him for a star, which is exactly what happened.</p>

      <label for="l6wjxdn" class="commentText"><p>I agree with you that during the onset the Miami team was more intimidating. My point is that people keep comparing the KD move to a singular incident that happened 6 years prior. People should be thinking about the totality of everything that occurred in those 6 years. 6 finals appearances, 3 titles off the backs of two super teams.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a contender during this timeframe, there&rsquo;s no way you&rsquo;re not thinking about how to beat LeBron. And with that you&rsquo;re considering the fact that with his short contracts, at any off season there&rsquo;s a chance he goes and joins a refreshed super team. Super teams have existed in the past and they usually run their course and decline. But the Cavs move extended Lebron&rsquo;s run in a way that hadn&rsquo;t really been done before. So if you&rsquo;re the warriors or any contender, why wouldn&rsquo;t you fight fire with fire?</p>

In 2011, there were several teams (Heat, Mavs, Spurs, Lakers, etc) that had a shot at the title just like this year. In 2017, there was one, maybe two. Let&rsquo;s not pretend those those moves were the same thing.</p>

<li>KD won <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>, LeBron won <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>. That&rsquo;s a 67% vs 50% success rate.</li>
<li>The only season this iteration of the Warriors didn&rsquo;t win the title, Klay missed one and a half games while Durant played a total of 12 minutes in the finals. If they are both very hobbled but just healthy enough to be on the court 30 mpg every game (which LeBron&rsquo;s co-stars in Miami always were), they win <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>.</li>
<li>Miami had to fight hard to even get to some of those finals, and then won one of their titles in 7. The only title they won effortlessly was in 2012. On the other hand, KD Warriors went on a 16-1 post season run and only ever had trouble beating one team: the Harden CP3 Rockets.</li>
</ol>

<p>The level of dominance in real time was completely different. Heatles lost two finals without having any stars out for games. Warriors felt inevitable until both KD AND Klay went down. They even swept the WCF without KD that season.</p>

<p>He constantly got shit on for being arguably the worst defensive big in the league because he refused to even try, and even his scoring was called into question because he had poor efficiency for his position and it looked like he was just putting up junk volume for an awful team.   There were tons of articles from the heat era about how much his defense had improved and how much better of an overall player he was despite his scoring taking a hit.</p>

Despite the Lakers and Spurs dominating the West the West still had extreme parity and multiple teams nearly every year that were multiple legitimate contenders. In the early 2000&rsquo;s, the Lakers, Spurs, Kings, Trailblazers, Mavs were all high level contenders. In the mid-2000&rsquo;s you the Spurs, Mavs, Suns. By the late 2000&rsquo;s you needed 50 wins to just get the 8th seed.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily call that wide open. Though it&rsquo;d be tough to characterize any of those Spurs, Mavs, or even technically OKC teams superteams. They were teams with a star or two and extremely solid rotation players, or for OKC just catching a bunch of amazing talents when they were still on the way up.</p>

They didn’t just land pippen and mj together, they got them  on incredibly  cheap and very long term deals. That wouldn’t be possible today. The spurs dynasty started by drafting an all time great next to an all time great, and continued by their exploiting a niche that’s well and truly exposed now (finding and integrating overseas players) Plus the new cba is pretty well designed for parity. I’m sure there’ll be another dynasty - it might not be possible to stop wemby, or some team will find another brilliant exploit - but they’re going to be less and less likely.</p>

      <label for="l6v18ep" class="commentText"><p>Theres too much money for dynasties these days. You spend 3-4 years cultivating a squad to go and win a championship and then lose a couple good role players to bigger contracts or one of the stars loses a step or worse, gets injured and no one can step in and the dynamic falls apart.</p>

<p>And then when all of those things happen they fire the head coach to appease whoever and they have to start the cultivation all over again. Its pretty ridiculous.</p>

      <label for="l6y78l4" class="commentText"><p>No it hasn&rsquo;t been.  Free agency has only been around for 30ish years, and the salary cap is less than 40 years old.   The luxury tax has also gotten far more punishing (from 1:1 to a sliding scale that is over 5:1 for organizations $20m over the cap).</p>

<p>In the past you could also:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sign extra long contracts</li>
<li>Pay ANY amount of money to retain your players (see: Jordan making more than the entire salary cap all by himself)</li>
</ol>

<p>Today it would be utterly impossible to keep together the super teams of the 80s and 90s (Lakers, Celtics, Bulls).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kinda funny how so many people consider the era with the least parity in the past 50 years to be the pinnacle of the NBA while simultaneously bemoaning the existence of superteams.</p>

      <label for="l6z6k3c" class="commentText"><p>Yet they were still able to because players had little agency, there was no salary cap and players couldn&rsquo;t just walk in free agency.</p>

<p>The challenges back then could be overcome by managing the expectations and demands of the players who didn&rsquo;t have any real leverage.</p>

<p>Today there is no way to work around the issue other than being lucky as hell as well as <strong>consistently</strong> being prescient with draft picks, talent development and gambling on injured or underperforming players.   Building the initial squad is hard enough, but it&rsquo;s basically impossible to do it consistently enough that you can offset the exodus of talent that you cannot possibly afford to retain with the current CBA.</p>

<p>This is particularly true considering how much more talented the league is today, with how many amazing players and teams there are in order to stand head and shoulders above them like a dynasty you need a deep, talented squad and great coaching.</p>

<p>I’d argue it’s doing its job. If the NBA wanted to have no salary cap and operate like the MLB or soccer, it could have — but clearly they value competitive parity. And with the new CBA, they’ve finally found a set of rules that gets them there.</p>

<p>I for one love it. It sucks that fans and the media immediately look to discredit champions if they aren’t able to repeat — but it’s good for the league can cycle through different championship contenders</p>

<p>Uhh, you may want to think about that a little more. The MLB has had 9 champions in 10 years. There haven&rsquo;t been repeat champions since the 90&rsquo;s. NBA has probably the least parity in professional sports, even though its gotten better.</p>

And while there haven&rsquo;t been repeat champions, there have definitely been dynasties. The Yankees, Red Sox, Giants, Dodgers, and even Astros (*) have all made multiple CF over many years.</p>

<p>Compare that to the NBA where we are seeing new teams in the CF basically every year (this year, the Mavs, Wolves and Pacers all didn&rsquo;t make it last year).</p>

<p>The team with the highest salary this year is north of 300M, the one with the lowest is 60</p>

      <label for="l6y0le7" class="commentText"><p>Yeah there&rsquo;s been a lot of different champions in MLB but there is so much more luck/variance involved in MLB playoffs compared to NBA. 2 rounds of short series before the best of 7s and your best players only get a fraction of the at bats/innings pitched, whereas NBA has only best of 7s and the 3 best players will be running the vast majority of possessions on both ends.</p>

<p>But the regular season in baseball has double the games and we&rsquo;ve had a lot less parity in terms of which teams are winning divisions and making the playoffs because with such an enormous sample, the best teams always rise to the top, and the correlation between team salary and winning percentage is enormous. The Dodgers won their division 10 of 11 years and in the 11th they won 106 games. The Astros have won their division 6 out of 7 years and made it to the ALCS each year. The Braves have won their division 6 years in a row. The Yankees are the Yankees. There&rsquo;s only 2 &ldquo;budget&rdquo; teams that I would argue have been strong teams for a long time, the Rays and Guardians. All the others have huge payrolls.</p>

<p>And for each of those teams I just mentioned there&rsquo;s a team who is constantly at the bottom of the standings year after year and have pathetic payrolls. The lack of salary cap is absolutely crushing any semblance of parity in MLB, the only saving grace is the random nature of the sport and the wacky ass playoffs.</p>

      <label for="l6w91vz" class="commentText"><p>I think &ldquo;role players&rdquo; (a misnomer term imo) in the league are paid closer to what they&rsquo;re worth now (as a % of the total roster payroll) than in historical seasons where I&rsquo;d argue they were underpaid.  I think GMs and the NBA fell for their own player-centric marketing leading to a devaluation of guys that don&rsquo;t show up on the TV commercials for the game.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>If you look back at recent championship roster, you&rsquo;ll find &ldquo;role players&rdquo; that are on hyper value contracts.  It might be that these players just value chasing money more than stability these days, not sure, but the effective hard cap is definitely working so far.  Teams can&rsquo;t afford to keep a lot of these elite role players, because of the severe roster building limitations of being over the second apron.</p>

<p>in the league are paid closer to what they&rsquo;re worth now (as a % of the total roster payroll) than in historical seasons where I&rsquo;d argue they were underpaid.

<p>I kinda disagree with this. Have you forgotten about all the terrible contracts mid or over-the-hill players received in the past? Mozgov, Deng, Eddy Curry on the Knicks, etc. Compared to other american sports leagues, the NBA have always focused of making sure that mid level guys get paid and &ldquo;everybody gets theirs&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you look back at recent championship roster, you&rsquo;ll find &ldquo;role players&rdquo; that are on hyper value contracts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To me, that&rsquo;s because the average level of the &ldquo;role player&rdquo; has grown a lot in the last 20 years, so it&rsquo;s much easier to find that diamond in the rough on a good contract. Teams in general are just more &ldquo;stacked&rdquo; than they used to be, one of the reason&rsquo;s why there are talks of expanding the league. Just think about, if those &ldquo;role player&rsquo;s&rdquo; true ability level was already known, they would&rsquo;ve already gotten a bigger contract from another team. Sometimes it&rsquo;s about being in the right situation at the right time and putting those players in the best situation to succeed. Players such as Gafford and PJ Washington were playing on bum teams like the Wizards and Hornets and now they are important role players on a finals team, the talent in this league runs deep now.</p>

<p>Because they&rsquo;re stupid, obviously.</p>

<p>I do agree with you that SOME of the rules could be good, like the ones that embargo the buyout market, but again, it&rsquo;s not necessarily going to be the &ldquo;big market&rdquo; teams that are hurt, as promised. It&rsquo;s going to be teams like the T-Wolves, or the Nuggets, or maybe even the Pacers in a few years, who have had recent success, but in order to maintain that success, they need to pay their players what they&rsquo;re worth to retain them, and then they get fucked by the second apron and all its restrictions. The alternative is to NOT pay those players to avoid the ramifications, and when NO ONE can pay them what they&rsquo;re worth, then they just go to Miami &lsquo;cause they have nice weather.</p>

      <label for="l6witjh" class="commentText"><p>The good news for the Celtics is that they will have 3 draft picks untouched by the 2nd apron and Stepien rules: 2025, 2027, and 2031.</p>

<p>In addition, if Jrue falls off or Porzingis falls off, they are making 30mil, so you can pivot to a different player making that much, which falls within 2nd apron rules.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think their issue is replacing Jrue/Porzingis if they fall off, the issue is replacing Hauser and, especially, Horford. They have 0 flexibility in getting a Horford replacement and ditto for Hauser.</p>

<p>If KP is going to miss all these games, they will HAVE to find a suitable 2nd big that can start when he&rsquo;s out. And, if this post-season is any indication, that player would have to be able to start games in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>The REAL issue is the repeater tax, which will come into play when Tatum&rsquo;s contract kicks in. We are talking a tax never before seen by any team&hellip;and I&rsquo;m talking double what the warriors paid.</p>

They are basically in a position to pounce on any unhappy star willing to move to OKC and they would still have more in the bank than most of their competition afterward</p>

<p>The whole process of rebuilding post Westbrook has been so impressive I see little to no reason to think it&rsquo;ll go sour, and very little way the rest of the NBA can compete in a trade with OKC. They were miles ahead of schedule this year</p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t need to retain the core, in fact more the opposite. Probably looking at upgrading the pieces around Chet and SGA with the picks and filling out the roster with cheap rookies. Even Chet might be tradeable depending on who&rsquo;s available and when they need to pay him properly. The reason they&rsquo;re such a threat is what they can offer in trades (a youngish goodish prospect + picks) is going to be impossible to compete with. We&rsquo;re lucky they&rsquo;re based in Oklahoma</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a nightmare for us all in the West, but maybe the trigger will never be pulled. They didn&rsquo;t pull it this year and it really cost them with you (no back up big)</p>

      <label for="l6w9bco" class="commentText"><p>The problem is even if you pay everyone and pay the tax the 2nd apron rules start to kick in and youre fucked, you basically get no draft capital, you cant trade, you can only sign vet mins. For example, your core is good enough to win in the next few years but if you guys keep staying over the tax you wont be able to replace DWhite or Jrue or KP when those contracts are up and then youre cooked.</p>

      <label for="l6uyx45" class="commentText"><p>I think we are in the middle of a new age of parity. I can’t see a super team forming for a while now. The NBA has fully recovered from KD joining the warriors and helping them get to 4 titles.</p>

<p>I personally don’t see anyone on the trajectory of a Lebron or Kobe. We will still see very dominant players like Luka. But we are still trying to find out who the true best player in the world is. And they probably won’t be able to run it to the NBA Finals 3 times in a row like Lebron and Kobe have both done. And that’s a combination of the competition being spread out AND the fact that anyone in the league right now being at the level of peak Kobe or Lebron is a stretch.</p>

      <label for="l6v1pic" class="commentText"><p>The NBA, in the new CBA, basically put the kibosh on a team drafting multiple hall of famers, building around them, and keeping the group together. In order to pay everyone what they’re worth, teams are going to have to pay crazy high tax bills, and then you have the media trying to break up every group of good players unless they’re on LA or NY. Most owners won’t pay through the nose like that unless they’re guaranteed a sure thing, which is extremely rare, and teams/players lack patience to build something from the ground up when they can just hop from team to team</p>

<p>They saw all the success and popularity the Warriors had, and decided we don’t want that again.</p>

      <label for="l6v3ec1" class="commentText"><p>Obviously those are probably my favorite teams ever, but I can understand that from a neutral fan’s perspective. But my point was that with today’s CBA even the pre KD warriors team probably wouldn’t stay together as long as they did. Good chance one of Klay/Draymond/Iguodala would be gone to save on the huge tax penalties and get under the 2nd apron, etc. If they kept the big 3 they would lose a lot of depth (and no KD). Teams like OKC, Memphis, Orlando who have done exactly what youre supposed to do by drafting extremely well and built young cores will all have serious financial decisions to make in the coming years. I would like to see more teams grow into winning rather than just haphazardly assembling stars, this cba makes it harder</p>

      <label for="l6v4fwo" class="commentText"><p>The Warriors pre-KD were fortunate enough with the timing of Curry&rsquo;s extension and him exploding into the unanimous MVP. By the end of 2016, he was the 5th most paid player. If he got the max extension that Luka/Ant/Ja/Tatum see, they would&rsquo;ve had a lot harder time keeping all of Klay/Draymond/Iggy/Bogut for those first few years.</p>

<p>The new CBA prevents team hopping and superteams from forming too. Players are looking to get paid more than ever and aren&rsquo;t willing to take paycuts or get duped into signing lower than their perceived market value</p>

<p>Otherwise, you can&rsquo;t put a team around it. And KD is a non-option, and you don&rsquo;t get Barnes-KD-DLo-Wiggins either, because your fourth and fifth are Bogut/Livingston/Looney tier at best, or one year rehabilitations (which the Warriors did do well with overall, to be fair (GP2, Otto, McGee etc.)</p>

<p>You might keep it together until Dray/Klay need to be paid after Curry gets his max. Then you probably need to flip one, or flip both.</p>

The last time there was this much parity was in the 70s and that was when NBA’s popularity was low.  Only got revived with Magic and Bird’s rivalry in the 80s.  However, there is more engagement through social media so maybe the parity won’t affect it as much</p>

      <label for="l6w53gb" class="commentText"><p>The league is and always will be superstar driven. The parity is dependent on what they do and how they develop. I also keep saying how the majority of superstars who win titles have to be in their prime (ages 25-32). Outside of that, it&rsquo;s exponentially more difficult to win one as the lead guy. So while the league has had more parity, you can almost select the small pool of potential champions at the beginning of the year. The year WAS a bit a different because you had a few younger teams start to show their potential and Luka took another Mavs team in the first year of his prime window deep in the playoffs. But the contenders that I would&rsquo;ve picked at the beginning of the year based only on hype and expectations would&rsquo;ve been: Nuggets, Lakers, Suns, Clippers, Celtics, Bucks, Sixers, and maybe the Heat.</p>

<p>It will be no different next year with only a small pool of teams that could win.</p>

      <label for="l6wrscr" class="commentText"><p>The MLB has devent parity because even though there&rsquo;s no salary cap, its a system that encourages players to move around. The NFL and NBA have the least parity because star players very rarely swap teams. The Celtics should be great for years because even though there are tons of repercussions for doing so, they can still pay and retain all of their players if they want to. Same with other young teams like OKC for example. If the NBA were like the MLB, JB would never have signed his extension and would get an even bigger payday this offseason and would be gone.</p>

If you&rsquo;re an NBA star at the end of your contract, you could take a 10% pay cut to go to one of the 3 bad teams that can afford you, or just re-sign for the supermax like everybody does. If there was a real hard cap it might be different, but the soft cap is purpose built to make teams continuous.</p>

      <label for="l6wuh6u" class="commentText"><p>We&rsquo;ll, it takes multiple top 15 players in one team and one or two all star role player archetypes to be a dynasty. You need three stars in different timelines on different contracts so that you have leeway for some good contracts to fill up your playoff rotation. It takes perfect team building. Nuggets had this but their high level role players have not ascended to All NBA and All star levels consistently. Imagine the difference it would make if they had Tatum/ Ingram instead of MPJ. Note that they are all making similar amount of money. You would have a dynasty already by changing something so small. See the difference if Siakam was on the Thunder instead of Hayward. Again similar contracts but vastly different outcomes. Same case if Mavs had the No.1 pick in 2023. Yes, you would say of course if you take the worst contract on every team and replace it with the best then the team would be good. But that is the case in reality too. Bulls wouldn&rsquo;t be as dominant without Pippen&rsquo;s dirt cheap contract or even the Warriors signing KD because of Steph&rsquo;s cheap contract compared to the level of player he was. Dynasties are very much possible, just needs a ton of luck and foresight, tbh that has not changed across any generation.</p>

Somewhat typical for Hollinger&rsquo;s argumentative sloppiness.</p>

      <label for="l6x12gj" class="commentText"><p>This reminds me of when me and this guy in my AP Stats class did a presentation on parity in the NBA. Except my partner spelled it as &ldquo;parody.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t have any confidence in the topic as he basically did all the work but even as a sophomore I was sure it was spelled as parity. We presented it to the class and no one corrected us. If you&rsquo;re reading this Austin, I hope you figured out the difference.</p>

<p>We’re in the middle of an age of parity and money/player relationships have changed everything. It’s difficult to maintain a dynasty in today’s league.</p>
