      <label for="l6uzw32" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re gonna exit one.</p>

<p>Despite what people say, the league was pretty even from 2010-16 with multiple great teams having a shot. The KD move is what changed things and it was a product of a very unique situation (Curry&rsquo;s low contract and a historic cap spike). This likely won&rsquo;t ever happen again (I hope), so I think the league will continue to have high parity.</p>

      <label for="l6v7jgv" class="commentText"><p>KD joined a 73-9 team that were 2 possessions away from repeating. Lebron teamed up with another unproven star in Bosh and Wade who won a ring with an entire set of players that were no longer on the team and with a new, unproven coach. Lebron choked the first year, but those Heat teams could&rsquo;ve still lost even with him playing well. The only way GSW could fail is if they got injured which is what happened in 2019.</p>

<p>Thinking that Lebron and KD&rsquo;s moves were in way the same is a gross oversimplification that ignores all the other factors surrounding both moves. But this is sports, so I guess it&rsquo;s easy to ignore those things when it goes against a player you don&rsquo;t like</p>

      <label for="l6v8eyx" class="commentText"><p>KD&rsquo;s move was worse but that doesn&rsquo;t also mean that Lebron&rsquo;s move didnt have a huge negative effect on parity. from 2004-2010 you had the celtics, pistons, cavs, magic, heat all fighting to come out of the east, after the decision it was pretty much a formality that Lebron&rsquo;s superteam would be winning the east and half of the playoffs were now meaningless.</p>

<p>KD&rsquo;s move was also a response to Lebron&rsquo;s move, in the same way that Lebron one-upped the Celtics old mid-30s
 superteam by forming a superteam with 3 prime late-20s  superstars KD one-upped Lebrons 3 prime superstars with 4 prime superstars. Without Lebron&rsquo;s move there is no KD move to GS.</p>

That&rsquo;s par for the course today but most players in the 2000&rsquo;s began their descent at that age. Them joining forces was considered a last ditch attempt to win something (after many many attempts) before the 3 of them got too old to do so.</p>

<p>If we&rsquo;re talking about the time they came together Rondo also shouldn&rsquo;t matter here. He was entering his sophomore year after a rookie year where he averaged 6/3/3. No one expected him to become as good as he became.</p>

<p>You can say KD was &ldquo;inspired&rdquo; by Lebron, but KD joined a 73-9 win team that already won one without him. It was never his team even when he won FMVP. The Nets superteam was more similar to what Lebron did in Miami and Cleveland. Thinking that KD &ldquo;wanted to one up Lebron&rsquo;s superteam&rdquo; with his own, which was never his to begin with, is a huge jump</p>

      <label for="l6w35xj" class="commentText"><p>KD&rsquo;s move was objectively worse but you&rsquo;re also very much letting Lebron off the hook here. Lebron and Wade were 2 of the 3-5 best players in the league when they joined forces. Bosh was a 5 time All Star by the age of 25 and had already made All NBA and finished top 7 in MVP voting one year when they joined forces. He was by a country mile the best 3rd option in the league. The year prior to joining the Heat he averaged <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> which was excellent back then.</p>

<p>Further, all 3 of them played in the East already prior to joining the Heat so them teaming up weakened the rest of the conference as a whole.</p>

<p>At the time they joined forces they absolutely believed that the league would be a cakewalk similar to how it was for the KD-Warriors hence the (not 1 not 2 not 3 etc. speech). 3 players that good had never joined forces in their peaks the same way they did.</p>

      <label for="l6wu7mw" class="commentText"><p>He signed knowing that he would have both Kyrie and the 1st pick which everyone knew would be Wiggins. Wiggins was considered a generational prospect at the time and was arguably the most hyped prospect since Lebron at that point. He knew he would either have Wiggins or the team would be able to flip him for a star, which is exactly what happened.</p>

      <label for="l6wjxdn" class="commentText"><p>I agree with you that during the onset the Miami team was more intimidating. My point is that people keep comparing the KD move to a singular incident that happened 6 years prior. People should be thinking about the totality of everything that occurred in those 6 years. 6 finals appearances, 3 titles off the backs of two super teams.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a contender during this timeframe, there&rsquo;s no way you&rsquo;re not thinking about how to beat LeBron. And with that you&rsquo;re considering the fact that with his short contracts, at any off season there&rsquo;s a chance he goes and joins a refreshed super team. Super teams have existed in the past and they usually run their course and decline. But the Cavs move extended Lebron&rsquo;s run in a way that hadn&rsquo;t really been done before. So if you&rsquo;re the warriors or any contender, why wouldn&rsquo;t you fight fire with fire?</p>

In 2011, there were several teams (Heat, Mavs, Spurs, Lakers, etc) that had a shot at the title just like this year. In 2017, there was one, maybe two.

<li>KD won <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>, LeBron won <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>. That&rsquo;s a 67% vs 50% success rate.</li>
<li>The only season this iteration of the Warriors didn&rsquo;t win the title, Klay missed one and a half games while Durant played a total of 12 minutes in the finals. If they are both very hobbled but just healthy enough to be on the court 30 mpg every game (which LeBron&rsquo;s co-stars in Miami always were), they win <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>.</li>
<li>Miami had to fight hard to even get to some of those finals, and then won one of their titles in 7. The only title they won effortlessly was in 2012. On the other hand, KD Warriors went on a 16-1 post season run and only ever had trouble beating one team: the Harden CP3 Rockets.</li>
</ol>

<p>The level of dominance in real time was completely different. Heatles lost two finals without having any stars out for games. Warriors felt inevitable until both KD AND Klay went down. They even swept the WCF without KD that season.</p>

Second of all, we&rsquo;re looking at the entire league, not just one conference. If we use your logic, this year didn&rsquo;t have parity because the Boston was the only contender in the East (doesn&rsquo;t make sense).

Celtics were old and declining, especially after KG&rsquo;s knee surgeries. and then Heat even took Ray Allen from them lol. Pacers were definitely not contenders and would&rsquo;ve gotten smashed by any West team</p>

<p>Celtics had a very easy run this year but mostly due to injuries of stars of other teams</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just debating your logic that the KD move is when parity ended when it started when Lebron went superteam jumping. the Harden/CP3 Rockets and Kawhi Spurs in the KD-Warriors era would clear pretty much any team Lebron&rsquo;s superteams faced</p>

      <label for="l6v4xyx" class="commentText"><p>The league wasn&rsquo;t decided when Lebron decided to team up with the Heat and with the Cavs. He got pushed to the brink almost every year. Whether that&rsquo;s him or his team underperforming is irrelevant when talking about parity. The fact is they were very much beatable every time. In 2016, the Spurs/OKC/GSW/Cavs were all seen as somewhat equal contenders. In 2017, it was GSW&rsquo;s ring to lose. In 2018, they got pushed to the brink by the Rockets, but I&rsquo;d argue that series ends quicker if Iguodala doesn&rsquo;t get injured. In 2019, they would&rsquo;ve ran through the Raptors if KD doesn&rsquo;t get injured. KD&rsquo;s move to GSW was not the same as Lebron&rsquo;s</p>

If you want to slight Lebron for underperforming, I don&rsquo;t really care since I&rsquo;m not a Lebron fan. The facts are those Heat teams were very beatable every year, and a lot of things went their way even in their best year for them to win. That wasn&rsquo;t the case with GSW who ran through every team when healthy the moment KD was added. The team that went 73-9 and were 2 possessions away from repeating replaced their weakest starter with Kevin Durant. An unproven Bosh/Lebron teamed up with Wade who won a ring with a squad that was completely gone, with a new coach, and was a sub-50 win team in a weak conference. The circumstances and parity of the league by those moves were not the same</p>

By the late 2000&rsquo;s you needed 50 wins to just get the 8th seed.</p>

      <label for="l6x73mf" class="commentText"><p>And does that Jordan dynasty hit the same if they actually had to pay them properly? They didn’t just land pippen and mj together, they got them  on incredibly  cheap and very long term deals. That wouldn’t be possible today. The spurs dynasty started by drafting an all time great next to an all time great, and continued by their exploiting a niche that’s well and truly exposed now (finding and integrating overseas players) Plus the new cba is pretty well designed for parity. I’m sure there’ll be another dynasty - it might not be possible to stop wemby, or some team will find another brilliant exploit - but they’re going to be less and less likely.</p>

<p>Finals ratings are always better when big stars and big teams are involved, so yes Curry vs Lebron, Kobe vs Celts had higher ratings than Denver v Miami. </p>

<p>But finals ratings is just one metric. I’d imagine it’s better for the league to have a decent finals and a functioning set of 29 teams that are all bringing ticket sales, merchandise revenue, regular season game viewership, etc. vs a highly rated finals and the setup of the 2000s and 2010s where 3/4ths of the East is a dumpster fire that no one is watching </p>

Many of the best players in the nba are not American and seem to have less desire to market themselves to a US audience. That’s a bigger reason for Finals rating decline than the fact that the Warriors were a dynasty, imo.</p>

You spend 3-4 years cultivating a squad to go and win a championship and then lose a couple good role players to bigger contracts or one of the stars loses a step or worse, gets injured and no one can step in and the dynamic falls apart.</p>

<p>And then when all of those things happen they fire the head coach to appease whoever and they have to start the cultivation all over again. Its pretty ridiculous.</p>

<p>I’d argue it’s doing its job. If the NBA wanted to have no salary cap and operate like the MLB or soccer, it could have — but clearly they value competitive parity. And with the new CBA, they’ve finally found a set of rules that gets them there.</p>

<p>I for one love it. It sucks that fans and the media immediately look to discredit champions if they aren’t able to repeat — but it’s good for the league can cycle through different championship contenders</p>

It’s really bad for the league to have markets with super bad teams for several years in a row, and I think the changes to the cap were to prevent this from happening - this does require those teams to shell out money for FAs that can’t stay with their teams though.</p>

<p>Uhh, you may want to think about that a little more. The MLB has had 9 champions in 10 years. There haven&rsquo;t been repeat champions since the 90&rsquo;s. NBA has probably the least parity in professional sports, even though its gotten better.</p>

      <label for="l6ws553" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re kidding me right. That&rsquo;s an anomaly and not a consequence of how the MLB is structuring their cap. And while there haven&rsquo;t been repeat champions, there have definitely been dynasties. The Yankees, Red Sox, Giants, Dodgers, and even Astros (*) have all made multiple CF over many years.</p>

<p>Compare that to the NBA where we are seeing new teams in the CF basically every year (this year, the Mavs, Wolves and Pacers all didn&rsquo;t make it last year).</p>

<p>The team with the highest salary this year is north of 300M, the one with the lowest is 60</p>

      <label for="l6w91vz" class="commentText"><p>I think &ldquo;role players&rdquo; (a misnomer term imo) in the league are paid closer to what they&rsquo;re worth now (as a % of the total roster payroll) than in historical seasons where I&rsquo;d argue they were underpaid.  I think GMs and the NBA fell for their own player-centric marketing leading to a devaluation of guys that don&rsquo;t show up on the TV commercials for the game.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>If you look back at recent championship roster, you&rsquo;ll find &ldquo;role players&rdquo; that are on hyper value contracts.  It might be that these players just value chasing money more than stability these days, not sure, but the effective hard cap is definitely working so far.  Teams can&rsquo;t afford to keep a lot of these elite role players, because of the severe roster building limitations of being over the second apron.</p>

Both teams have the talent that’s either just entering or still not in their prime and they both have it locked up for the long run too. They’re also both blessed with arguably the two best FOs in basketball. If I had to make a guess I’d say they each win their conference the most times over the next 5 years but that could also only be 1-2 times</p>

      <label for="l6witjh" class="commentText"><p>The good news for the Celtics is that they will have 3 draft picks untouched by the 2nd apron and Stepien rules: 2025, 2027, and 2031.</p>

<p>In addition, if Jrue falls off or Porzingis falls off, they are making 30mil, so you can pivot to a different player making that much, which falls within 2nd apron rules.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think their issue is replacing Jrue/Porzingis if they fall off, the issue is replacing Hauser and, especially, Horford. They have 0 flexibility in getting a Horford replacement and ditto for Hauser.</p>

<p>If KP is going to miss all these games, they will HAVE to find a suitable 2nd big that can start when he&rsquo;s out. And, if this post-season is any indication, that player would have to be able to start games in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>The REAL issue is the repeater tax, which will come into play when Tatum&rsquo;s contract kicks in. We are talking a tax never before seen by any team&hellip;and I&rsquo;m talking double what the warriors paid.</p>

They are basically in a position to pounce on any unhappy star willing to move to OKC and they would still have more in the bank than most of their competition afterward</p>

<p>The whole process of rebuilding post Westbrook has been so impressive I see little to no reason to think it&rsquo;ll go sour, and very little way the rest of the NBA can compete in a trade with OKC. They were miles ahead of schedule this year</p>

<p>They just seem to have hit the timing right on the money for the next 3-4 years.</p>

<p>I personally don’t see anyone on the trajectory of a Lebron or Kobe. We will still see very dominant players like Luka. But we are still trying to find out who the true best player in the world is. And they probably won’t be able to run it to the NBA Finals 3 times in a row like Lebron and Kobe have both done. And that’s a combination of the competition being spread out AND the fact that anyone in the league right now being at the level of peak Kobe or Lebron is a stretch.</p>

      <label for="l6v1pic" class="commentText"><p>The NBA, in the new CBA, basically put the kibosh on a team drafting multiple hall of famers, building around them, and keeping the group together. In order to pay everyone what they’re worth, teams are going to have to pay crazy high tax bills, and then you have the media trying to break up every group of good players unless they’re on LA or NY. Most owners won’t pay through the nose like that unless they’re guaranteed a sure thing, which is extremely rare, and teams/players lack patience to build something from the ground up when they can just hop from team to team</p>

<p>They saw all the success and popularity the Warriors had, and decided we don’t want that again.</p>

      <label for="l6v3ec1" class="commentText"><p>Obviously those are probably my favorite teams ever, but I can understand that from a neutral fan’s perspective. But my point was that with today’s CBA even the pre KD warriors team probably wouldn’t stay together as long as they did. Good chance one of Klay/Draymond/Iguodala would be gone to save on the huge tax penalties and get under the 2nd apron, etc. If they kept the big 3 they would lose a lot of depth (and no KD). Teams like OKC, Memphis, Orlando who have done exactly what youre supposed to do by drafting extremely well and built young cores will all have serious financial decisions to make in the coming years. I would like to see more teams grow into winning rather than just haphazardly assembling stars, this cba makes it harder</p>

<p>imo those teams shouldn&rsquo;t be affected by tax for paying guys they didn&rsquo;t stack up in free agency</p>

      <label for="l6v4fwo" class="commentText"><p>The Warriors pre-KD were fortunate enough with the timing of Curry&rsquo;s extension and him exploding into the unanimous MVP. By the end of 2016, he was the 5th most paid player. If he got the max extension that Luka/Ant/Ja/Tatum see, they would&rsquo;ve had a lot harder time keeping all of Klay/Draymond/Iggy/Bogut for those first few years.</p>

<p>The new CBA prevents team hopping and superteams from forming too. Players are looking to get paid more than ever and aren&rsquo;t willing to take paycuts or get duped into signing lower than their perceived market value</p>

      <label for="l6v7llm" class="commentText"><p>Disagree. Draymond and Klay were both signed to relatively team-friendly contracts that would’ve been way below the max. Even with Steph on a super max, the Warriors would’ve easily been able to keep everyone together. They would’ve even have been over the second apron</p>

<p>Edit: tf am I being downvoted for. Literally just stating the facts</p>

      <label for="l6v88qo" class="commentText"><p>Draymond and Klay occupied 42% of the Warriors capspace in 2016. Iggy and Bogut occupied another 35%. Curry only occupied 16%. If we compare that to a player like Ja Morant today who occupies 26%, they would&rsquo;ve had to make moves to move some players when all those players had their FA up in 2017, and they wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to get KD even with the capspike.</p>

Like if Curry doesn&rsquo;t hurt his ankle and makes his leap like 2 years earlier those teams probably don&rsquo;t end up as deep.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you can&rsquo;t put a team around it. And KD is a non-option, and you don&rsquo;t get Barnes-KD-DLo-Wiggins either, because your fourth and fifth are Bogut/Livingston/Looney tier at best, or one year rehabilitations (which the Warriors did do well with overall, to be fair (GP2, Otto, McGee etc.)</p>

<p>You might keep it together until Dray/Klay need to be paid after Curry gets his max. Then you probably need to flip one, or flip both.</p>

      <label for="l6w53gb" class="commentText"><p>The league is and always will be superstar driven. The parity is dependent on what they do and how they develop. I also keep saying how the majority of superstars who win titles have to be in their prime (ages 25-32). Outside of that, it&rsquo;s exponentially more difficult to win one as the lead guy. So while the league has had more parity, you can almost select the small pool of potential champions at the beginning of the year. The year WAS a bit a different because you had a few younger teams start to show their potential and Luka took another Mavs team in the first year of his prime window deep in the playoffs. But the contenders that I would&rsquo;ve picked at the beginning of the year based only on hype and expectations would&rsquo;ve been: Nuggets, Lakers, Suns, Clippers, Celtics, Bucks, Sixers, and maybe the Heat.</p>

<p>It will be no different next year with only a small pool of teams that could win.</p>

The last time there was this much parity was in the 70s and that was when NBA’s popularity was low.  Only got revived with Magic and Bird’s rivalry in the 80s.  However, there is more engagement through social media so maybe the parity won’t affect it as much</p>

      <label for="l6wrscr" class="commentText"><p>The MLB has devent parity because even though there&rsquo;s no salary cap, its a system that encourages players to move around. The NFL and NBA have the least parity because star players very rarely swap teams. The Celtics should be great for years because even though there are tons of repercussions for doing so, they can still pay and retain all of their players if they want to. Same with other young teams like OKC for example. If the NBA were like the MLB, JB would never have signed his extension and would get an even bigger payday this offseason and would be gone.</p>

      <label for="l6wuh6u" class="commentText"><p>We&rsquo;ll, it takes multiple top 15 players in one team and one or two all star role player archetypes to be a dynasty. You need three stars in different timelines on different contracts so that you have leeway for some good contracts to fill up your playoff rotation. It takes perfect team building. Nuggets had this but their high level role players have not ascended to All NBA and All star levels consistently. Imagine the difference it would make if they had Tatum/ Ingram instead of MPJ. Note that they are all making similar amount of money. You would have a dynasty already by changing something so small. See the difference if Siakam was on the Thunder instead of Hayward. Again similar contracts but vastly different outcomes. Same case if Mavs had the No.1 pick in 2023. Yes, you would say of course if you take the worst contract on every team and replace it with the best then the team would be good. But that is the case in reality too. Bulls wouldn&rsquo;t be as dominant without Pippen&rsquo;s dirt cheap contract or even the Warriors signing KD because of Steph&rsquo;s cheap contract compared to the level of player he was. Dynasties are very much possible, just needs a ton of luck and foresight, tbh that has not changed across any generation.</p>

When Bron was on the Heat the cap was 67 million next season there’s going to be 25 players alone making 40 million and that’s before some of those guys get traded to different teams where they might not have wanted to go to and get forced into a contract buyout it’s how Westbrook went from making 44 Million with the Lakers to only 808,219 with the Clippers. it’s always about money.</p>
