<p>The excuses of &ldquo;oh the qualifiers are during the NBA season, they couldn&rsquo;t play them anyway&rdquo; and &ldquo;oh Cameroon has an awful team, why would they bother&rdquo; just go out the window now.</p>

<p>This is the weakest Olympic Qualifying Tournament in regards to the favourites. No offense to Latvia, Brazil and the Philippines but they&rsquo;re all very much beatable, compared to Greece and Slovenia (Piraeus), Lithuania and Italy (San Juan), and Spain and the Bahamas (Valencia).</p>

<p>Jeremiah Hill is a great player who&rsquo;s forced to be their primary offensive engine and their defense is great, with an NBA MVP candidate and another All-NBA quality player they would have great chances at qualifying.</p>

      <label for="lbmunk5" class="commentText"><p>South Sudan has a better team than this Cameroonian team.</p>

<p>South Sudan plays a really modern style of basketball and are by far the best three point shooting African team, they play entirely differently than every other African team.</p>

<p>Cameroon has great defense, is really physical and plays with a lot of heart, but their offense outside of Jeremiah Hill is really clunky, they need Hill to basically orchestrate their entire offense.</p>

<p>They missed some really easy shots against Montenegro, Hill should have had at least 15 assists that game, I&rsquo;m talking about wide open threes, floaters from well inside the paint etc.</p>

<p>South Sudan just added Bol Bol, J.T. Thor and Thon Maker to their Olympic roster, they have by far both the most quality on paper and a more advanced offense than any other African Team.</p>

<p>From the teams you just mentioned, Latvia has won the last couple of games against Spain, Lithuania, Greece, and Italy. Slovenia we somehow haven&rsquo;t played so much, while Bahamas is totally new to everyone.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t the early 2000s,buddy, Latvia is the 6th highest rankings team in the world. And we&rsquo;re playing good. One bad game against the Philippines, and our group would be easy for Cameroon??? Stop.</p>

      <label for="lbn32y9" class="commentText"><p>I never once said that you&rsquo;re not a good national team, I listed you as favourites for this Olympic Qualifying Tournament, which you are, you&rsquo;re a well coached, great shooting side with a fun and nicely organized offense.</p>

<p>I said that the main favourites for this OQT, which are you guys and Brazil, are worse than any of the other two combinations (Greece/Slovenia, Lithuania/Italy and Spain/Bahamas), in my opinion.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that a team with their tallest player being 6&rsquo;10&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s not known as an elite defensive team, would have problems with a Cameroon side which has a 7 footer NBA MVP candidate and another All-NBA caliber big man, as well as a very good defense next to them, to keep up with your good offense.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry for such blasphemy in suggesting that a Cameroonian team with Embiid and Siakam could have a chance of beating you.</p>

<p>Also, Embiid will never play for Cameroon, he&rsquo;s American (lol), but, with. Siakam, I think it&rsquo;s fair to then also take KP in the consideration. And yes, we do still beat them.</p>

<p>But all due respect - I did mistake your comment for stating that THIS Cameroon team could win against THIS Latvian team.</p>

There was one good choice here - play for Cameroon and get them qualified. It would’ve been one of the best stories of the Olympics, and he 100% would’ve been the flag bearer too. It also would’ve been massive for basketball in Africa for an African superstar to play for their country, which rarely happens unfortunately (Hakeem didnt play for nigeria)</p>

      <label for="lbmpi9m" class="commentText"><p>Pascal actually was listed on their original roster for this tournament, but he opted out because hes a FA. The deal with Indiana doesnt become official until Saturday, so theres insurance complications for playing in games before then. FIBA always puts the OQT right during the start of free agency, so it puts players in a difficult spot.</p>

<p>Hield decided to play without a contract, which is risky but he never gets injured and loves playing for the Bahamas, so he couldn’t pass it up. Siakam I guess didn’t want to risk it</p>

      <label for="lbmz6d3" class="commentText"><p>To be fair to FIBA, I don’t know where else they could put the OQT. The Olympics start late July so it has to be well before that, and the OQT has to be a few weeks after the end of the Finals at least. The Euros also have knockouts next week, so it would be unwise to put it the same week as that.</p>

      <label for="lbni76y" class="commentText"><p>You are right about that but Fiba just doesnt make even an effort. They have beef with Euroleague for example so they dont use their refrees. These qualifiers (for Euros, WC&rsquo;s ) just mess. Lots of teams had to played with their C or D teams before. I can understand dealing with NBA (way bigger moneys etc.) hard but why tf they are fighting with Euroleague i dont get.</p>

<p>International/European basketball can grow so much these days yet they are putting trash tournaments, bad advertisement (they might make a deal with NBA for both, Silver wants to extend NBA) terrible refs. Its just so annoying.</p>

<p>The #1 advantage of the qualifiers is creating home games for teams. That does wonders for popularity in smaller nations. I think its cool that Estonia, for example, can sell out a crowd in mid February for a national team game. That was never a thing before.</p>
