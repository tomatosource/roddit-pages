      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ejq0t0/these_are_the_nba_players_who_for_their_careers/"><p>These are the NBA players who, for their careers, the <sup>2024</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub> season is a do or die year.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>The <sup>2024</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub> season is a few months away and while we have a general idea of expectations for teams and players alike (barring a late season trade), there are a few of note whose career is on something of a downturn.  For them, this season can either revive their career as they enter free agency next year - or further hammer in nails to their proverbial coffin.</p>

<p>Not every player&rsquo;s career is in the same level of jeopardy i.e. there aren&rsquo;t a ton of Malachi Flynns in the NBA for this year&rsquo;s pending free agents/extension-eligible players that haven&rsquo;t received one, but there are some players who nevertheless have some major questions about how much longer they&rsquo;ll be in the NBA.</p>

<p><strong>Ben Simmons</strong> (<em>Nets</em>):</p>

<p>With Ben Simmons, it&rsquo;s less of a question as to what can he do so much as whether injuries have robbed him of even being a roleplayer version of his former All-Star/All-NBA self.  No one is expecting him to return to his prime but with his Brooklyn tenure seeing him play a mere 57 games over 2 and a half seasons, it is worth asking if Ben can still be an NBA player as his massive max contract finally comes off the books as the young socialite could very easily retire with generational wealth, a not insignificant number of accolades to his name and a fun bit of trivia that <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/report-76ers-have-fined-ben-simmons-more-than-19m-and-counting" target="_blank">he&rsquo;s the most fined player in NBA history</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Davion Mitchell</strong> (<em>Raptors</em>):</p>

<p>Yes, he had a good stretch down the season but that uptick in 3-point percentage came on low volume.  It certainly wasn&rsquo;t enough for the Kings, who dumped him along with two second round picks.  Now, Davion Mitchell is two years removed from his rookie season and in a potential battle for the role of backup PG with the player the Raptors selected with Jamal Shead - the player the Raptors selected with a 2nd rounder they got in said salary dump.  Older rookies tend to be a lot closer to their ceiling (Though Jamal Shead is on the older side as a rookie for what it&rsquo;s worth) so the 25 year-old Davion Mitchell might have already peaked.  Then again, the Raptors GOAT was a late bloomer so it remains to be seen if this will be a buy-low that works out in their favor or not given the team&rsquo;s need for PG depth.</p>

<p><strong>Chris Duarte</strong> (<em>Bulls</em>):</p>

<p>Another former Kings player though this one is still in the good ol&rsquo; Murica of A, Duarte had a disappointing season with the Indiana Pacers before being traded off to Sacramento.  His time with the Kings?  Equally underwhelming, to the point where he was an afterthought in the DeMar DeRozan sign &amp; trade, where he&rsquo;ll join fellow 2021 draftee Ayo Dosunmu.  Whether or not he&rsquo;ll get a second contract like Ayo after his current one expires remains to be seen with Chicago heading into a rebuild without their pick (It&rsquo;s owned by the Spurs, albeit Top 10 protected).</p>

<p><strong>Bones Hyland</strong> (<em>Clippers</em>):</p>

<p>Remember when this guy threw away a ring over beefing with Jamal Murray?  Yeah, the former All-Rookie 2nd Team&rsquo;s reputation in the locker room has remained dormant ever since he was traded to the Clippers where he&rsquo;s remained equally quiet on the court, finding very little in the way of opportunity.  He hasn&rsquo;t made the most of what he has been afforded, mind, and with the loss of Paul George, the Clippers will need someone to step up in Playoff P&rsquo;s absence for them to have any chance in a loaded Western Conference.</p>

<p><strong>Robert Williams III</strong> (<em>Blazers</em>):</p>

<p>When healthy, Timelord has been amongst the most impactful centers in the NBA.  The problem is&hellip;he&rsquo;s never healthy, having played a combined 41 games over the past two seasons and only ever playing more than 40 games in 2 seasons of his thus far 6-year career.  With an early end to his <sup>2023</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub> season and the center position more or less up for grabs based on reports of the Blazers not being happy with Ayton&rsquo;s performance, couple with drafting Donovan Clingan and a tanking team that&rsquo;s closer to the luxury tax than you&rsquo;d think - they&rsquo;re at $167 million at the moment - one of the main pieces from the Jrue Holiday/Dame trades might end up spending the last two years of his career as salary filler, if not straight up dumped to free up cap space instead of playing a part in a quality rotation like the once promising player he was when he was on the Boston Celtics.  Williams has played big minutes and over 60 games a season, it&rsquo;s just unproven as to whether he can do that for two seasons in a row.</p>

<p><em>Honorable Mentions:</em></p>

<p><strong>The Rockets pending 2025 RFAs</strong> - We all know Sengun is good and Jalen Green enjoys getting people&rsquo;s hopes up every March, the question going into the <sup>2024</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub> season is less about whether they&rsquo;ll get extended and more whether they can work together - and if not, who will get traded.</p>

<p><strong>The Detroit Pistons current starting guards</strong>:  See above.  Cade is good, Ivey has shown promise, the question is whether they can actually play together with Ivey not being a shooter at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>Isaac Okoro</strong>:  Okoro is technically a restricted free agent but with the reported disagreement over dollar value and the difficulty of navigating a sign and trade, it is not out of the realm of possibility that Isaac will simply take the $12 million qualifying offer and bet on his improved** shooting benefitting him from becoming a free agent in a year where more teams expect to have cap space - albeit with far more notable competition for players looking for their next contracts.</p>

No one was comparing their pre-injury careers as if Lonzo was the elite player that Hill was. They both had horrible injuries that sidelined them indefinitely for multiple seasons and were told by doctors to hang it up. The jury is still out if Lonzo will have any redemption.</p>

      <label for="lgfrcid" class="commentText"><p>Rob Williams remains one of my favorite players ive ever watched. Holy shit he could fly. but it was also obvious injuries would take their toll. y’all ever seen the movie Gattca? theres a famous quote from it “*wanna know how i did it? i never saved anything for the swim back*”. I feel like that was Rob when he jumped, all he cared about was the jumping he couldnt care less when where and how he landed. </p>

      <label for="lggd3hn" class="commentText"><p>Maybe his career would have gone differently if the Celtics hadn’t rushed him back from meniscus surgery after 23 days. The original timeline <a href="https://www.celticsblog.com/2022/3/30/23002910/report-robert-williams-set-to-return-from-meniscus-surgery-in-4-6-weeks" target="_blank">was 4-6 weeks</a>, and even that was ridiculous.</p>

<p>They then subsequently told him that playing through pain <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/report-celtics-told-robert-williams-playing-through-injury-wont-make-knee-worse" target="_blank">wouldn’t make things worse</a>.</p>

<p>Now Celtics fans are quoting sentimental lines from Gattaca like that’s the reason he’s never properly recovered.</p>

      <label for="lggspeh" class="commentText"><p>You clearly weren’t paying attention then. He was given the choice of partial repair for the chance to come back in the playoffs or full surgery which probably would’ve kept him out well into the following year. Either choice would lead to arthritis long-term, that’s just the nature of meniscus tears</p>

<p>He chose the partial repair, came back right around the four-week mark, playing like 15 minutes a game. He played extremely passively and always had the option to sit out, but consistently said he felt good to play. Then he got more surgery in the offseason and only played 35 games the next season.</p>

<p>Say what you want about our medical team when it comes to IT or Kemba but Rob’s trajectory was always going to be what it was. Even when we BARELY played him his first 3 years he was constantly dealing with nagging injuries. It was more blessed that he went the majority of the 2022 season WITHOUT one. Ask a Celtics fan what the vibe was about Rob the whole season, we were just waiting after any awkward landing to hear he’d be out again</p>

      <label for="lggsne8" class="commentText"><p>Idk what Gattaca is, but I think you are over emphasizing coming back from that injury early. For one, the injury he had last year was in his right knee, which is not the same knee he was injured in ‘22. The guy is just extremely injury prone. Its unfortunate, but his body cannot keep up with being a pro athelete. And the way he plays is so physical and taxing on his body</p>

      <label for="lghqm57" class="commentText"><p>GATTACA is a 90&rsquo;s sci-fi movie starring Ethan Hawke and Jude Law. The movie is based in a future society where humans have started to genetically engineer their progeny, but it is not available to everyone &ndash; creating a caste system.</p>

<p>One of the plots of the movie focuses on two brothers, one who is genetically engineered and the other is not. The quote is about the two competing against each other and basically is saying, &ldquo;I beat him because I was willing to push myself to the point of death&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Now, this has absolutely no relevance to Williams play style or injuries. He is just reckless vs Vincent Freeman who is extremely determined.</p>

He didn’t outswim his brother because “he didn’t save anything” but because he diligently trained to be an astronaut (and his brother apparently never trained). Plus, Ethan Hawke was selfish and would probably ruin the mission because he has a defective heart problem.</p>

But if they’re unplayable together again heading into a contract year for Ivey, they might need to look for a trade next offseason.</p>

<p>In this apron era, we’ve seen good role players go extremely underpaid, but teams have still been willing to shell out serious cash on rookie extensions. If Pat Williams got <span class="math inline">\(20M/yr and Immanuel Quickly got \)</span>35M/yr, Ivey could easily push for $25-30M. Overpaying busts would prolong detroits rebuild even further.</p>

<p>Fans just like to support him because of his history and everything he went through, the potential he had and etc</p>

<p>But go take a look at his numbers&hellip; They are beyond awful in every single area.</p>

<p>The dude was getting praises for hitting a tree and 5 passes in a game, then you go look at the numbers and he shot 17% and had 6 turnovers&hellip;</p>

<p>The only other he played more than 45 games (55% of games) was 2019-20 where he put up 12/3/5 with 1.5 steals and 2 turnovers on 46/26/73 shooting.</p>

<p>In the 7 seasons he’s played, he’s only played in just under 41% of possible games for his respective teams.</p>

<p>If he hadn’t gotten hurt early into this past season he most likely would’ve continued to build of his 22-23 campaign.</p>

<p>I’m biased cause I believe in the dude but I think he could still be a backup PG at the very least on the majority of teams (barring he’s healthy).</p>

<p>He’s never been a good player in this league.  But I remember back in 2020 when people were bragging about how “We got this guy for Johnathan Simmons!”</p>

<p>Looking back the Magic made a huge mistake trading for him and signing him to that contract.  The pick they gave up became Maxey and he never got close to being worth $17m/year.  But this won’t be focused on much since it’s the magic</p>

      <label for="lgh7imo" class="commentText"><p>Saying they shouldn’t have made the trade because the pick was Maxey is a terrible argument. The dude went 21st overall and he massively benefited from playing with established players on a very good Sixers roster.</p>

<p>Typically pick 21 doesn’t yield much; over he last 10 years the most relevant guys picked there aside from Maxey are Grayson Allen, Brandon Clarke, and Christian Braun. Guys who are all role players. Maxey going to the Magic after they had just picked Cole Anthony at pick 15 and went Jalen Suggs at 5 the year after means he would’ve been buried in the lineup.</p>

<p>Jonathon Simmons and Pick 21 for a Former 1st overall pick on his rookie deal is a bargain all things considered.</p>

<p>I do completely agree that the contract was a mistake. 3yr/51 mil was a crazy offer to a guy who barely played and could shoot a 3 to save his life.</p>

<p>If Maxey hadn’t be picked by the Sixers, this trade would’ve faded into memory. It was pure luck the sixers hit on Maxey. Which to be fair, is how the draft works anyways.</p>

<p>Jabari Parker was honestly a better player, he came back from his first ACL injury and was on track for a 20pt season in his 3rd year until his second ACL injury.</p>

<p>Fultz is way more similar to Ben Simmons, maybe more to it than that they were drafted by the same organization.</p>

      <label for="lggocee" class="commentText"><p>Honestly I’m kinda tired of the Ben Simmons “he’s hurt 🥺” excuse. Nah, dude just gave up. He quit. He just happened to hurt his back on top of that and now it’s the permanent excuse.</p>

<p>Dont forget though, he was perfectly healthy, and threw a tantrum refusing to play in Philadelphia ever again because he was scared of the fans and so in his head that he couldn’t make a layup anymore. He never improved, and has clearly lost every bit of competitive drive that he had.</p>

<p>Simmons got his bag and quit. That’s really it.</p>

<p>He definitely quit on the sixers but the reasons he hasn’t played much since has everything to do with injuries and nothing to do with “quitting”.</p>

<p>Also let’s not act like the sixers didn’t quit on him too. You guys were burning his jersey and posting it online minutes after losing. Ironically he wasn’t even your biggest issue that series lol</p>

<p>And his historic playoff meltdown was not injury related.  His back didn’t make him pass up open layups against Trae Young.</p>

<p>If he continues to regress next season, Milwaukee is in a really tough spot and Lillard will have earned the “washed” status.</p>

They&rsquo;re not getting any younger and if they don&rsquo;t perform this year then it&rsquo;s pretty much the end of their current roster.

<p>Brandon Ingram is truly in a make it or break it season due to his contract and his demands.</p>

<p>Julius Randle could get a massive extension and has had health issues. He’s probably the biggest player in the NBA where he could get $15M or a max deal possibly depending on how he returns.</p>

One thing about NBA fans is they’ll grab onto a narrative and run with it. I saw a guy say Jordan Poole was the worst player in the league. It’s crazy.</p>

<p>Besides all that Lonzo has to be on this list unfortunately. What are the odds he’s able to come back and play near his peak level? I doubt he’ll have that same defensive ability after multiple surgeries.</p>

<p>Even in the years Simmons made all star teams, he was a detriment to the flow of the offense and spacing</p>

      <label for="lggyks6" class="commentText"><p>I actually couldn’t disagree more. The kid was a decent floor general always making the correct read and yes he doesn’t space the floor as he’s not a shooter but on a team with 3 and D wing players and a big who can actually step out and hit the 3 at a decent clip he would be fine. Even without a 3p shooting big he can still be fine with some chemistry. From 17-19 in the playoffs Ben was giving you 15 8 and 8 respectively without ever stepping on embiids toes. He’s more of a traditional PG imo and in a role where he isn’t required to score 25+ a game he will be fine. Not to mention the defensive side of the ball he was the steals leader in 2020 and is a 2x 1st team all defense.</p>

<p>Done get me wrong he is a shell of himself atm but Ben was a top 20 player in the league for a season or two there.</p>

      <label for="lgh3khm" class="commentText"><p>Simmons pretty much always was surrounded by 3 and D players and a center who shot 3s and it didn’t matter.  It always became an issue against good teams who would sag off of him.</p>

<p>If Simmons wasn’t as lucky to be drafted to a team with one of the best shooting centers, and instead had to play with much more limited 5s, he would have never made an all star team and his weaknesses would have been made apparent much more quickly.</p>

<p>If you really thought Simmons’ inability to shoot never stepped on Embiid’s toes you really didn’t watch.  Sixers fans know this better than anyone.  His reputation at its best never matched his actual value on the court.  He rode the pre-draft hype and “next Lebron” stamp until it was clear he was a disappointment.</p>

      <label for="lgh4xfq" class="commentText"><p>By not stepping on embiids toes I mean embiids numbers didn’t change much. He averaged about 4 more ppg cause of course he’s the main option now. Yes once ben decided to not shoot AT ALL it became apparent but in Ben’s first 2-3 seasons no one questioned his ability to play the game and play the game well. Hell a lot of 76ers fans were comparing Ben to Lebron James in my area (Baltimore) as far as all around player. Yes those last what 2 years it was apparent embiid was tired of Ben and they couldn’t play together. My point being made here though before we got off track was Ben will play better this year because it’s a contract season and will remain in the NBA. He’s a 6’10 guard giving you atm 6 7 and 9 respectively and plays defense on the perimeter. There’s at least 7-8 teams off the top of my head who need exactly that whether it be off the bench or starting 🤷🏽‍♂️</p>
