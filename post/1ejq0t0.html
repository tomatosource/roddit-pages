      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ejq0t0/these_are_the_nba_players_who_for_their_careers/"><p>These are the NBA players who, for their careers, the <sup>2024</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub> season is a do or die year.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>The <sup>2024</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub> season is a few months away and while we have a general idea of expectations for teams and players alike (barring a late season trade), there are a few of note whose career is on something of a downturn.  For them, this season can either revive their career as they enter free agency next year - or further hammer in nails to their proverbial coffin.</p>

<p>Not every player&rsquo;s career is in the same level of jeopardy i.e. there aren&rsquo;t a ton of Malachi Flynns in the NBA for this year&rsquo;s pending free agents/extension-eligible players that haven&rsquo;t received one, but there are some players who nevertheless have some major questions about how much longer they&rsquo;ll be in the NBA.</p>

<p><strong>Ben Simmons</strong> (<em>Nets</em>):</p>

<p>With Ben Simmons, it&rsquo;s less of a question as to what can he do so much as whether injuries have robbed him of even being a roleplayer version of his former All-Star/All-NBA self.  No one is expecting him to return to his prime but with his Brooklyn tenure seeing him play a mere 57 games over 2 and a half seasons, it is worth asking if Ben can still be an NBA player as his massive max contract finally comes off the books as the young socialite could very easily retire with generational wealth, a not insignificant number of accolades to his name and a fun bit of trivia that <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/report-76ers-have-fined-ben-simmons-more-than-19m-and-counting" target="_blank">he&rsquo;s the most fined player in NBA history</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Davion Mitchell</strong> (<em>Raptors</em>):</p>

<p>Yes, he had a good stretch down the season but that uptick in 3-point percentage came on low volume.  It certainly wasn&rsquo;t enough for the Kings, who dumped him along with two second round picks.  Now, Davion Mitchell is two years removed from his rookie season and in a potential battle for the role of backup PG with the player the Raptors selected with Jamal Shead - the player the Raptors selected with a 2nd rounder they got in said salary dump.  Older rookies tend to be a lot closer to their ceiling (Though Jamal Shead is on the older side as a rookie for what it&rsquo;s worth) so the 25 year-old Davion Mitchell might have already peaked.  Then again, the Raptors GOAT was a late bloomer so it remains to be seen if this will be a buy-low that works out in their favor or not given the team&rsquo;s need for PG depth.</p>

<p><strong>Chris Duarte</strong> (<em>Bulls</em>):</p>

<p>Another former Kings player though this one is still in the good ol&rsquo; Murica of A, Duarte had a disappointing season with the Indiana Pacers before being traded off to Sacramento.  His time with the Kings?  Equally underwhelming, to the point where he was an afterthought in the DeMar DeRozan sign &amp; trade, where he&rsquo;ll join fellow 2021 draftee Ayo Dosunmu.  Whether or not he&rsquo;ll get a second contract like Ayo after his current one expires remains to be seen with Chicago heading into a rebuild without their pick (It&rsquo;s owned by the Spurs, albeit Top 10 protected).</p>

<p><strong>Bones Hyland</strong> (<em>Clippers</em>):</p>

<p>Remember when this guy threw away a ring over beefing with Jamal Murray?  Yeah, the former All-Rookie 2nd Team&rsquo;s reputation in the locker room has remained dormant ever since he was traded to the Clippers where he&rsquo;s remained equally quiet on the court, finding very little in the way of opportunity.  He hasn&rsquo;t made the most of what he has been afforded, mind, and with the loss of Paul George, the Clippers will need someone to step up in Playoff P&rsquo;s absence for them to have any chance in a loaded Western Conference.</p>

<p><strong>Robert Williams III</strong> (<em>Blazers</em>):</p>

<p>When healthy, Timelord has been amongst the most impactful centers in the NBA.  The problem is&hellip;he&rsquo;s never healthy, having played a combined 41 games over the past two seasons and only ever playing more than 40 games in 2 seasons of his thus far 6-year career.  With an early end to his <sup>2023</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub> season and the center position more or less up for grabs based on reports of the Blazers not being happy with Ayton&rsquo;s performance, couple with drafting Donovan Clingan and a tanking team that&rsquo;s closer to the luxury tax than you&rsquo;d think - they&rsquo;re at $167 million at the moment - one of the main pieces from the Jrue Holiday/Dame trades might end up spending the last two years of his career as salary filler, if not straight up dumped to free up cap space instead of playing a part in a quality rotation like the once promising player he was when he was on the Boston Celtics.  Williams has played big minutes and over 60 games a season, it&rsquo;s just unproven as to whether he can do that for two seasons in a row.</p>

<p><em>Honorable Mentions:</em></p>

<p><strong>The Rockets pending 2025 RFAs</strong> - We all know Sengun is good and Jalen Green enjoys getting people&rsquo;s hopes up every March, the question going into the <sup>2024</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub> season is less about whether they&rsquo;ll get extended and more whether they can work together - and if not, who will get traded.</p>

<p><strong>The Detroit Pistons current starting guards</strong>:  See above.  Cade is good, Ivey has shown promise, the question is whether they can actually play together with Ivey not being a shooter at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>Isaac Okoro</strong>:  Okoro is technically a restricted free agent but with the reported disagreement over dollar value and the difficulty of navigating a sign and trade, it is not out of the realm of possibility that Isaac will simply take the $12 million qualifying offer and bet on his improved** shooting benefitting him from becoming a free agent in a year where more teams expect to have cap space - albeit with far more notable competition for players looking for their next contracts.</p>

      <label for="lgfrcid" class="commentText"><p>Rob Williams remains one of my favorite players ive ever watched. Holy shit he could fly. but it was also obvious injuries would take their toll. y’all ever seen the movie Gattca? theres a famous quote from it “*wanna know how i did it? i never saved anything for the swim back*”. I feel like that was Rob when he jumped, all he cared about was the jumping he couldnt care less when where and how he landed. </p>

      <label for="lggd3hn" class="commentText"><p>Maybe his career would have gone differently if the Celtics hadn’t rushed him back from meniscus surgery after 23 days. The original timeline <a href="https://www.celticsblog.com/2022/3/30/23002910/report-robert-williams-set-to-return-from-meniscus-surgery-in-4-6-weeks" target="_blank">was 4-6 weeks</a>, and even that was ridiculous.</p>

<p>They then subsequently told him that playing through pain <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/report-celtics-told-robert-williams-playing-through-injury-wont-make-knee-worse" target="_blank">wouldn’t make things worse</a>.</p>

<p>Now Celtics fans are quoting sentimental lines from Gattaca like that’s the reason he’s never properly recovered.</p>

<p>Explain how he passed the physical for the blazers trade then? Which was obviously after he played through the finals. try harder next time.</p>

He didn’t outswim his brother because “he didn’t save anything” but because he diligently trained to be an astronaut (and his brother apparently never trained). Plus, Ethan Hawke was selfish and would probably ruin the mission because he has a defective heart problem.</p>

<p>And going to have to disagree on his character assessment here. It’s a story about overcoming a dystopian society’s insane structure and ones identity being tied to their genetic makeup.

      <label for="lgg9be2" class="commentText"><p>Next season will be Ivey’s third (and his second with Cade). You’re right, I think this season should be focused on development. But if they’re unplayable together again heading into a contract year for Ivey, they might need to look for a trade next offseason.</p>

<p>In this apron era, we’ve seen good role players go extremely underpaid, but teams have still been willing to shell out serious cash on rookie extensions. If Pat Williams got <span class="math inline">\(20M/yr and Immanuel Quickly got \)</span>35M/yr, Ivey could easily push for $25-30M. Overpaying busts would prolong detroits rebuild even further.</p>

Maybe this is the year I hope it is if not for anything but for Cade to experience a bit of success</p>

      <label for="lggkj7n" class="commentText"><p>If we are being completely honest, he never looked like he was going to be nice after his first preseason</p>

<p>Fans just like to support him because of his history and everything he went through, the potential he had and etc</p>

<p>But go take a look at his numbers&hellip; They are beyond awful in every single area.</p>

<p>The dude was getting praises for hitting a tree and 5 passes in a game despite, then you go look at the numbers and he shot 17% and had 6 turnovers&hellip;</p>

      <label for="lggn7iw" class="commentText"><p>His 2022-23 season he averaged 14/4/6 with 1.5 steals and 2 turnovers on 51/31/78 shooting. He played and started the 60 games he was in.</p>

<p>The only other he played more than 45 games (55% of games) was 2019-20 where he put up 12/3/5 with 1.5 steals and 2 turnovers on 46/26/73 shooting.</p>

<p>In the 7 seasons he’s played, he’s only played in just under 41% of possible games for his respective teams.</p>

<p>If he hadn’t gotten hurt early into this past season he most likely would’ve continued to build of his 22-23 campaign.</p>

<p>I’m biased cause I believe in the dude but I think he could still be a backup PG at the very least on the majority of teams (barring he’s healthy).</p>

<p>Brandon Ingram is truly in a make it or break it season due to his contract and his demands.</p>

<p>Julius Randle could get a massive extension and has had health issues. He’s probably the biggest player in the NBA where he could get $15M or a max deal possibly depending on how he returns.</p>

<p>Dont forget though, he was perfectly healthy, and threw a tantrum refusing to play in Philadelphia ever again because he was scared of the fans and so in his head that he couldn’t make a layup anymore. He never improved, and has clearly lost every bit of competitive drive that he had.</p>
