</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>###It’s the offseason, so let’s hop into our time machine. I set the dial to exactly 10 years ago…the 2014 NBA offseason.</p>

<p>The world was a different place. Donald Sterling was the owner of the Clippers. Adam Silver was a first-year commissioner. The G League was still the D League. Tim Duncan’s Spurs just beat LeBron’s Heat for the title. The Hornets just changed their name to the Pelicans, and the Bobcats just changed their name to the Hornets.</p>

<p>I spent the past couple of weeks listening to old podcasts and YouTube videos from this era while working, so that I can bring you unadulterated takes from this era.</p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>

<p>So that we can put into perspective truly how little we know about the NBA, and how often the experts are wrong.</p>

<p><strong>What I listened to/watched</strong></p>

<p>I tried to get as diverse opinions as possible. I listened to lots of Bill Simmons (I’m doing okay now, thanks for asking), and his guests/co-hosts included Chad Ford, Ryen Rusillo, Jalen Rose, Ramona Shelburne, Jeff Van Gundy, Doc Rivers, and more.</p>

<p>I watched some Open Court/NBA on TNT with Ernie, Chuck, Shaq, Kenny, Chris Webber, Grant Hill, Reggie Miller, Isiah Thomas, and Rick Fox. The production value on Open Court was incredible back then.</p>

<p>I also dug up some old RealGM radio podcasts with Danny LeRoux, including one with guest Nate Duncan (so basically the Dunc’d On duo pre-Dunc’d On).</p>

<p>I watched the entire NBA draft telecast.</p>

<p>I watched the Rising Stars draft, which was done live on TNT. This was not the offseason (it was during the 13-14 All-Star break) but still gives perspective.</p>

<p>…I also tried watching some Skip/Stephen A Smith but it was REALLY bad (more on that later)</p>

<p>I did not use written articles since those have been known to be edited later. Just podcasts and videos.
And I did this while working my office job instead of listening to the current podcasts I normally listen to. Then just jotted some notes for ya’ll.</p>

<p><strong>And before we go all the way in the past, let’s recap what actually happened in the 2014 offseason and in the 14-15 season. This will help put the predictions into context when you see them:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>LeBron leaves Miami post-draft to return to Cleveland.</li>
<li>Cleveland trades Wiggins and Bennett (the past two #1 overall picks) for Kevin Love.</li>
<li>Wiggins wins Rookie of the Year with Minnesota.</li>
<li>Cleveland gets the #2 seed but makes the finals.</li>
<li>The Golden State Warriors make a MASSIVE jump and win a title out of nowhere. Steph wins his first MVP. The Warriors have the best record in the league at 67-15.</li>
<li>The Atlanta Hawks have the best record in the East - their entire starting 5 is named “co-player of the month,” in what I think is the only time it’s ever happened.</li>
<li>Chris Bosh plays most of the season but then learns he has a medical condition that forces him to retire.</li>
<li>The draft included two future MVPs (Jokic and Embiid) plus lots of all-stars and contributors to good teams</li>
</ul>

<p>#Okay, that’s a long enough preface. Let’s jump into the time machine.</p>

<p>##LeBron James and Miami/Cleveland:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most people did NOT predict LeBron leaving Miami.</li>
<li>LeBron tweeted that he likes Shabazz Napier, so the Heat trade up to draft him. Bill gets mad and asks why people are helping the Heat. Reporters at the draft ask Shabazz how excited he is to play with LeBron.</li>
<li>Woj tweets that LeBron will go to Cleveland and Bill/Jalen still don’t buy it.</li>
<li>Bill and Jalen say LeBron’s supporting cast was “below average” in Miami in 2013-14. I don’t know if everyone remembers how hard Dwyane Wade fell off. This is a pretty unanimous take among all shows I listened to. Everyone thinks he was just okay last year and might be cooked. Most people think Miami can still be a playoff team but mostly due to Bosh.</li>
</ul>

<p>LeBron to Cleveland truly did catch people by surprise, even after the draft. Don’t let revisionist history change this one.</p>

<p>##The Kevin Love trade</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Rumors were swirling that Golden State would trade Klay Thompson and David Lee to Minnesota for Kevin Love.</p></li>

<li><p>Bill and Jalen would have both done Love for Klay/Lee if they were Golden State.</p></li>

<li><p>Zach Lowe says he would have done it too, and adds “even though it’s not enough to make you a contender, at least you’d become relevant for once and sell tickets, so it’s a good business move” and “Of course you trade Klay for Love. Those are the easiest types of players to get. Klay’s not bad but there are multiple players like him in every single draft.”</p></li>

<li><p>Bill says “Klay is solid, but I won’t be telling my grandkids about him like Love. I’d do it too.”</p></li>

<li><p>Chad Ford says “Golden State and Minnesota need to ‘get a room already’ and just make the trade. Everyone knows they’re going to do it.”</p></li>

<li><p>I happen to remember that Jerry West was the one who convinced Golden State’s owner not to do it, but I didn’t hear that mentioned in any of these shows.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>##Once Kevin Love is sent to Cleveland for Wiggins/Bennett, it seems to be viewed as a pretty equal trade for both teams.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Bill says Bennett is still an asset and will become an above average NBA player.</p></li>

<li><p>Bill says that Kevin Love is going to be the best player LeBron has ever played with (sidenote: I listened to one podcast from the following offseason and after Love was disappointing and Wiggins wins ROY, Bill says Cleveland would undo that trade in a heartbeat)</p></li>

<li><p>A couple of people have Kevin Love as their dark horse MVP pick.</p></li>

<li><p>People seem low on Kyrie. Bill says he’s a good stats/bad team guy a la Steve Francis/Stephon Marbury, who might not like taking a backseat to LeBron. Bill says Kyrie&rsquo;s lone All-Star pick wasn&rsquo;t earned and only due to injuries.</p></li>

<li><p>Everyone thinks Love is WAY better than Kyrie.</p></li>

<li><p>Jalen thinks Cleveland should trade Kyrie for Eric Bledsoe since Bledsoe would be a better 3rd banana.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>##Cleveland/The East:</p>

<ul>
<li>Once LeBron and Love join, almost no one has Cleveland as the best team in the East.</li>
<li>When I log on to FB (I should stop doing that btw), I see tons of people saying that LeBron handpicks his teams and only goes to where he can absolutely win, like Cleveland…but 6 of the 8 TNT/Open Court guys have Chicago &amp;gt; Cleveland, some of them even specifically saying “even if Rose is still hurt&rdquo; (people really like the Noah/Gasol frontcourt)</li>
<li>No one is high on Atlanta even thought they get the #1 seed in reality (60 wins).</li>
<li>Barkley predicted Atlanta would miss the playoffs. Danny/Nate say they take a step backwards and that Millsap/Horford are both cooked. Everyone else didn’t even mention them.</li>
<li>People say Indiana would be the best or second best team in the East if Paul George didn’t get hurt.</li>
<li>Chris Webber thinks Wall/Beal/Pierce in Washington makes them a semi-contender.</li>
</ul>

<p>##Golden State/The West:</p>

<ul>
<li>Okay, look…Golden State didn’t exactly come out of nowhere in 14-15. They were 51-31 the year before. But no one saw the jump coming. At all.</li>
<li>In my listening, people said they won’t be better than last year and that they’re adding a rookie coach, which is a mistake.</li>
<li>In the hour-long season preview, the TNT/Open Court guys mention GS/Curry ZERO times.</li>
<li>Bill Simmons says that Iguodala is cooked and that GS is misusing him (he won Finals MVP 8 months later)</li>
<li>The best I can find is that a few people think GS will be a 4 or 5 seed.</li>
<li>The only person who had a good Golden State take was Zach Lowe, who said he “likes Steph Curry as a dark horse MVP candidate in the future (not this season)” and people gasped when he said it.</li>
<li>Simmons/Lowe have their Western winners odds/rankings as: Spurs/Thunder/Grizzlies. Later Bill changes his mind and has Clippers #1.</li>
<li>SVG has Clippers #1.</li>
<li>7 of the 8 Open Court/TNT guys have Spurs as best team in the West. The other says OKC.</li>
</ul>

<p>##Nikola Jokic</p>

<ul>
<li>Nikola was famously drafted during a commercial break. Specifically during a Taco Bell commercial.</li>
<li>I DUG HARD to try to find anyone say anything about him during this offseason so that I could give them their due, but I couldn’t find a single thing. Not one.</li>
<li>During the actual draft when they come back from break, they read the names of the players that were drafted while the commercials were playing. They simply state that Jokic was drafted, but then start talking about how all the other guys picked around him (like Nick Johnson) could be sleepers.<br>
</li>
<li>In a Danny LaRoux/Nate Duncan podcast, I heard Nate say “I actually scouted the Serbian team, and you know who I really like? He went in the 2nd round. Micic, the PG for the Sixers. He was the best player for Serbia.”</li>
<li>So literally nothing about Jokic, even from people who specifically scouted Serbia.</li>
</ul>

<p>##Giannis Antetokounmpo:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Giannis was entering his sophomore year during this offseason. He was drafted 15th overall the year before in what many people called a horrible draft. He had a pretty good rookie season and caught people by surprise.</p></li>

<li><p>Bill Simmons says if you redrafted last year’s draft today, Michael Carter Williams and Giannis would go <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in some order, but that neither would be top-7 picks in this class.</p></li>

<li><p>During the draft, someone offhand mentions that Giannis is pretty good, but “just wait!” for his brother Kostas to enter the league (as if he&rsquo;s the best of the brothers)</p></li>

<li><p>During the 2014 Rising Stars draft, Giannis goes 11th (behind Terrance Jones and Jared Sullinger) and Grant Hill defends his pick by saying “hey he’ll be an All-Star some day!”&hellip;Ernie kind of mockingly says “oh yeah? when? “ and Grant says “like 5 years from now but still.”</p></li>

<li><p>So yeah, people thought he’d be pretty okay, but not anywhere near DPOY/MVP/Finals MVP good. And that&rsquo;s after one season in the league, let alone during his draft.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>##Joel Embiid</p>

<ul>
<li>Joel, for those of you who don’t know, only started playing basketball at the age of 15. He played one season for Kansas, and was projected to be the #1 overall pick until he had a major injury. At this point in his career, he was famously trolling on Twitter, doing things like publicly hitting on Rhianna. He was the internet’s golden boy back then.</li>
<li>Post-injury: Bill and Jalen are higher on Embiid than most, and even they have him as the #3 pick who &ldquo;if he comes back healthy&rdquo; can be a 7’1” Serge Ibaka.</li>
<li>Later in a post-draft season preview, they say he could become an All-Star someday, but still refer to MCW as the “franchise guy.”</li>
<li>Chad Ford says teams are worried that Embiid might have Anemia or Hepatitis since he’s from Africa? This sounded really out of place to my 2024 ears, idk.</li>
<li>Chad Ford has Embiid going 6th in his mock.</li>
<li>Jonathan Tjarks has Embiid going #1 and says he’ll lead a “big man resurgence.” For those of you who don’t know, there were a lot of people claiming “the big man is dead in today’s NBA.” Now that we have Jokic/Embiid/Giannis as the past 3 MVPs, I would call this a big win for Tjarks.</li>
<li>SBNation has Embiid at #5</li>
</ul>

<p>##Rudy Gobert</p>

<p>Look, I know a lot of people are still low on him, but he’s a 4-time DPOY. He’s 10th All-Time in Win Shares/48, and is 50th all-time in career PER. In the 9 years that he’s been a starter, his teams have had a winning record 8 times (40-42 being the 9th). He’s been one of the best players for the past decade, no matter how you slice it.</p>

<ul>
<li>He was entering his sophomore season, and was drafted the previous year at 27 overall. Almost no one had him on their radar the following offseason. Here’s the only mention I could find in all of my listening:</li>
<li>Bill and Jalen have the Jazz as the 29th team in their preseason rankings. They say that their 3 best players are all bigs, which is bad roster construction (Kanter/Favors/Gobert). &ndash; - They call Kanter and Favors future all-stars, and have Gobert under them.</li>
<li>That’s it. That’s the only mention. Gobert was absent from the Rising Stars draft as well (Pero Antic and Jared Sullinger were in it)</li>
</ul>

<p>##Draymond Green</p>

<ul>
<li>Draymond Green was entering his THIRD season, and I heard ZERO mention of him on anything. He was also absent from the Rising Stars draft.</li>
<li>Not only were there zero mentions of him, there were TONS of mentions of David Lee (the man who had his job stolen by Draymond), with some people calling Lee one of the best power forwards in the league. No one saw Draymond coming.</li>
</ul>

<p>##Interesting assorted tidbits:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I heard a LOT of “I don’t know why they drafted _____ when they already have ____” or “the BPA was (good rookie) but I think they passed on him since they already have ___” for names like Channing Frye, Anthony Tolliver, Trey Burke, or Rodney Stuckey&hellip;maybe we shouldn’t fall into this trap in the modern day? Draft the BPA, guys. You’ll forget about the average guy you already have at that position later.</p></li>

<li><p>Jalen Rose, discussing the criticism the Spurs got for not signing Kawhi to a rookie extension “ It’s smart. They want to keep him hungry and give him a goal to fight for. This is for motivation to have a good season. He said he’ll be a Spur for life. He’s not going anywhere.”</p></li>

<li><p>Zach Lowe unprompted, when looking at MVP odds “Harden will never win an MVP.&rdquo; Harden was 2nd in MVP voting this season and won the award a few years later.</p></li>

<li><p>Simmons is rooting for KD to leave OKC in Free Agency in 2 years</p></li>

<li><p>Simmons is really high on Harden succeeding as the man in Houston because during a team USA training camp, KD/Harden/Paul George played a round robin 1on1 tourney and Harden had incredible, top-tier man-on-man defense during it.</p></li>

<li><p>Joe House bets the over on Toronto (43.5) because he’ll “never go against Drake on anything”</p></li>

<li><p>Jalen’s phone goes off during a show and Bill calls him out on it. Jalen says he’s “still getting used to the new technology”</p></li>

<li><p>Multiple mentions of how you can buy season tickets for the Bucks or Sixers for under $100. I don&rsquo;t think these were jokes.</p></li>

<li><p>Kyle Lowry had a bad rap at this time and was shipped off from multiple teams due to attitude. It sounds like he’s on the precipice of being a good starter or completely out of the league. Bill thinks he becomes a good player for Toronto and Jalen thinks he gets run off there too and runs out of chances in the league. He was a 0-time all-star during this discussion and went to 6 straight all-star games immediately afterward.</p></li>

<li><p>“Everyone knows LeBron and KD will pass the MVP back and forth for the next few years, but who comes in after that a few years from now?”
Bill says Anthony Davis might be an MVP some day and Lowe interrupts him and says “Davis WILL be an MVP.”
Lowe picks Steph Curry as his dark horse to win an MVP a few years from now…people kind of seem shocked.</p></li>

<li><p>Jalen Rose says that if he was playing against Blake Griffin, he would stick his foot under him when he’s landing from a jumpshot to throw him off of his game since he&rsquo;s not a shooter. No one flinched or addressed the comment. I found this interesting because Zaza did the same to Kawhi a couple of years later and it became a HUGE deal that everyone agreed was dirty.</p></li>

<li><p>When Bill discusses who teams will be tanking for in the upcoming draft, he mentions that the top 3 prospects are Jalil Okafor, Kelly Oubre, and Emmanual Mudiay</p></li>

<li><p>The Lakers owe a top-5 protected pick to Phoenix (Steve Nash trade) and Bill asks if they should tank. Jalen Rose and Ramona Shelburne both say no way, the Lakers and Kobe have too much integrity and they’ll will themselves into the playoffs. The Lakers finished 21-61 and drafted D’Lo with the #2 pick.</p></li>

<li><p>Everyone thinks New York looks good after acquiring Dalembert and Jose Calderon and Cleanthony Early. Thinks with Carmelo Anthony and Phil Jackson’s Triangle, that NY will be a very strong team…well, everyone except for Barkley. Barkley is low on the whole thing. NY finishes 17-65, with an even worse record than the Sixers, who were trying to lose on purpose.</p></li>

<li><p>Grantland’s first TV episode featured Bill Simmons and Jalen Rose with guests Zach Lowe, Jeff Van Gundy, and Doc Rivers. “Roundball Rock” was their theme song. NGL, that’s a pretty great lineup and song.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>##Draft tidbits (taken from draft telecast and draft preview/recap pods)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Jabari Parker is everyone’s #1 pretty much. Everyone thinks his floor is multiple time all-star. Safest pick in the draft.</p></li>

<li><p>Zach Lavine was drafted by the Timberwolves and mouths live on air “fuck me…”</p></li>

<li><p>Bruno Caboclo was a surprise 1st rounder and Fran Fraschilla famously says “he’s two years away from being two years away.”</p></li>

<li><p>When the Rockets are on the clock at #25, Bill Simmons predicts they pick a foreign guy to stash since they don’t have a roster slot. They do in fact pick a foreign guy: Clint Capela, and everyone jokes that he’s a non-factor and “one of the top 50 players of all time out of Switzerland”</p></li>

<li><p>PJ Hairston is drafted at #26 straight out of the D-League…this seems to be a really big deal. Everyone is talking about how odd it is. It’s a pretty common occurrence nowadays</p></li>

<li><p>Bill repeatedly says on-air that teams are making a mistake by passing up Cleanthony Early</p></li>

<li><p>The Sixers pick Jerami Grant at #39. The crew says that he kind of plays like his uncle Horace but that they don’t know how he’s going to fit in today’s NBA since he’s too small to be a power forward and he has absolutely zero shot/outside game at all. I guess props to him for figuring that out.</p></li>

<li><p>Jalen Rose mentions that too many foreign guys got taken and that lots of good US guys like Patrick Young should have been drafted instead.</p></li>

<li><p>Bill Simmons says the Nuggets are the big winners of the night “due to: (lists every single player they drafted or traded for aside from Jokic)”</p></li>

<li><p>Everyone loves Noah Vonleh. Barkley thinks he’ll be ROY</p></li>

<li><p>Most people love Elfriid Payton. Jalen and Bill think he’ll be ROY and predict a Gary Payton-like career for him.</p></li>

<li><p>I didn’t hear a single person pick Wiggins for ROY (the actual winner and #1 pick)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>##The Rising Stars draft
Okay, this wasn’t during the offseason, it was in the all-star break before it. But it was done live on TV with the TNT guys and I thought it was interesting. Here was the draft order:</p>

<ul>
<li>Anthony Davis (Kenny thinks he should’ve picked MCW)</li>
<li>Damian Lillard</li>
<li>Bradley Beal</li>
<li>MCW</li>
<li>Andre Drummond</li>
<li>Tim Hardaway Jr</li>
<li>Harrison Barnes</li>
<li>Trey Burke</li>
<li>Terrence Jones</li>
<li>Jared Sullinger</li>
<li>Giannis</li>
<li>Mason Plumlee</li>
<li>Jonas Valanciunas</li>
<li>Victor Oladipo</li>
<li>Dion Waiters</li>
<li>Steven Adams</li>
<li>Kelly Olynyk</li>
<li>Pero Antic</li>
</ul>

<p>####Not included in the exercise:</p>

<p>Rudy Gobert, CJ McCollum, Draymond Green, Khris Middleton, or reigning #1 overall pick Anthony Bennett</p>

<p>##ESPN/Skip and SAS:</p>

<p>I tried watching some ESPN clips (Skip and Steven A Smith) but had to turn it off. I started watching one where they were yelling and mocking an ESPN top-5 players list for not having Kobe or Wade on it (honestly neither one was even top-10 from 2014 onward), both hate Chris Paul being part of the list, and Skip wants Bynum on the list instead of Dwight Howard. Skip wants Carmelo in the top-5.</p>

<p>They seemed VERY upset by all of this but Kobe/Wade/Melo never finish top-10 in MVP voting again (and Lakers/Heat/Knicks have 3 of the worst records in the league after this), Bynum is out of the league immediately after this, and Chris Paul has multiple top-10 MVP finishes after this. Their opinions were way worse than the content they were criticizing, and they were SO upset about it. I couldn’t do it. I don’t know how people watch this crap. I could only watch 5 minutes of them, so that’s the only input you’ll get from Skip or SAS on my list.</p>

<p>##Takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There are probably some guys on current rosters who have a 68 rating on 2K and who no one ever talks about that will make an All-NBA roster some day.</p></li>

<li><p>Experts don’t know everything. Even the guys who look the best from this exercise had maybe a 30% success rate.</p></li>

<li><p>And….add your own! What sticks out to you?</p></li>
</ul>

      <label for="l9tol4f" class="commentText"><p>My big takeaway from reading all this is all these so called experts have just as much basketball IQ as us redditors 😭 the only difference is their jobs revolve around reporting about the league, doesn’t necessarily make them any more knowledgeable than ppl who watch the same games they do (Lowe saying harden never winning an MVP after looking good in the 13-14 season and bringing Houston to the playoffs is elite hating)</p>

<p>Everything in that comment still stands though. Duncan scouted Serbia and Micic played for Serbia. Thanks!</p>

      <label for="l9tqtpl" class="commentText"><p>This is a great walk down memory lane. Awesome job!</p>

<p>The media was, in my opinion, very biased towards Mark Jackson. For most of this past decade, they&rsquo;ve brought his name up for every coaching vacancy. No teams are ever interested, because he actually really sucked, and feuded with the Warriors front office.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thinking this may have skewed their Warriors takes. Because it was &ldquo;their guy&rdquo; that got fired, it would be an insult to expect the team to get better. The only real criticism of Kerr was his inexperience. Well&hellip; before Jackson got to the Warriors, <em>he had never coached anywhere either</em>. Plus, Kerr permitted the team to hire established assistants. Jackson didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>There was a Warriors reddit post with a very long list of all the crazy shit that Mark Jackson did that got him fired.</p>

<p>I don not believe any of this stuff was ever talked about nationally.</p>

<p>Draymond Green had actually already had his coming-out party, in the playoffs. Games 6 and 7, he put up 14-14-4 with 5 blocks, then 24-7-3-2-2. But given the context, it seems to have &ldquo;gone under the radar.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l9trchm" class="commentText"><p>Very good thread. I&rsquo;d have much to comment on GS, but I&rsquo;ll just take the time to think about how Cleveland got 2 #1 ovr picks in 2 consecutive years and none played any significant role aside from being bait for the Kevin Love trade. Adding Kyrie, and you get to see that CLE had 1st ovr picks in 3 of the 4 the years LeBron played for Miami (and LeBron ended up playing/winning with the guy that was drafted in that 1 year of 2012, AD).</p>

<p>Trying to think about it, the sixers had the same bad luck. These dudes had the 3rd ovr pick for 2 straight years (2014-15) and the 1st ovr pick ALSO for 2 straight years (2016-17). So 4 straight seasons with a top 3 pick. 1 of 4 is still on the team and he&rsquo;s the only one being the franchise player. For a team that prided themselves as &ldquo;the Process&rdquo;, it looks kinda bad. But hey, not everyone can be OKC and draft generational superstars 3 years in a row.</p>

<p>Meanwhile during that SAME period, the Lakers also had 3 consecutive years drafting the 2nd ovr pick, from D&rsquo;Lo, Ingram and Zo. None of them ever finished their rookie contracts with LA.</p>

<p>The 2010s draft classes were sure fun. There are lots of other facts that I&rsquo;ll let the others develop.</p>
