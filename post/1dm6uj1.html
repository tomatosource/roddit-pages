</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>###It’s the offseason, so let’s hop into our time machine. I set the dial to exactly 10 years ago…the 2014 NBA offseason.</p>

<p>The world was a different place. Donald Sterling was the owner of the Clippers. Adam Silver was a first-year commissioner. The G League was still the D League. Tim Duncan’s Spurs just beat LeBron’s Heat for the title. The Hornets just changed their name to the Pelicans, and the Bobcats just changed their name to the Hornets.</p>

<p>I spent the past couple of weeks listening to old podcasts and YouTube videos from this era while working, so that I can bring you unadulterated takes from this era.</p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>

<p>So that we can put into perspective truly how little we know about the NBA, and how often the experts are wrong.</p>

<p><strong>What I listened to/watched</strong></p>

<p>I tried to get as diverse opinions as possible. I listened to lots of Bill Simmons (I’m doing okay now, thanks for asking), and his guests/co-hosts included Chad Ford, Ryen Rusillo, Jalen Rose, Ramona Shelburne, Jeff Van Gundy, Doc Rivers, and more.</p>

<p>I watched some Open Court/NBA on TNT with Ernie, Chuck, Shaq, Kenny, Chris Webber, Grant Hill, Reggie Miller, Isiah Thomas, and Rick Fox. The production value on Open Court was incredible back then.</p>

<p>I also dug up some old RealGM radio podcasts with Danny LeRoux, including one with guest Nate Duncan (so basically the Dunc’d On duo pre-Dunc’d On).</p>

<p>I watched the entire NBA draft telecast.</p>

<p>I watched the Rising Stars draft, which was done live on TNT. This was not the offseason (it was during the 13-14 All-Star break) but still gives perspective.</p>

<p>…I also tried watching some Skip/Stephen A Smith but it was REALLY bad (more on that later)</p>

<p>I did not use written articles since those have been known to be edited later. Just podcasts and videos.
And I did this while working my office job instead of listening to the current podcasts I normally listen to. Then just jotted some notes for ya’ll.</p>

<p><strong>And before we go all the way in the past, let’s recap what actually happened in the 2014 offseason and in the 14-15 season. This will help put the predictions into context when you see them:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>LeBron leaves Miami post-draft to return to Cleveland.</li>
<li>Cleveland trades Wiggins and Bennett (the past two #1 overall picks) for Kevin Love.</li>
<li>Wiggins wins Rookie of the Year with Minnesota.</li>
<li>Cleveland gets the #2 seed but makes the finals.</li>
<li>The Golden State Warriors make a MASSIVE jump and win a title out of nowhere. Steph wins his first MVP. The Warriors have the best record in the league at 67-15.</li>
<li>The Atlanta Hawks have the best record in the East - their entire starting 5 is named “co-player of the month,” in what I think is the only time it’s ever happened.</li>
<li>Chris Bosh plays most of the season but then learns he has a medical condition that forces him to retire.</li>
<li>The draft included two future MVPs (Jokic and Embiid) plus lots of all-stars and contributors to good teams</li>
</ul>

<p>#Okay, that’s a long enough preface. Let’s jump into the time machine.</p>

<p>##LeBron James and Miami/Cleveland:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most people did NOT predict LeBron leaving Miami.</li>
<li>LeBron tweeted that he likes Shabazz Napier, so the Heat trade up to draft him. Bill gets mad and asks why people are helping the Heat. Reporters at the draft ask Shabazz how excited he is to play with LeBron.</li>
<li>Woj tweets that LeBron will go to Cleveland and Bill/Jalen still don’t buy it.</li>
<li>Bill and Jalen say LeBron’s supporting cast was “below average” in Miami in 2013-14. I don’t know if everyone remembers how hard Dwyane Wade fell off. This is a pretty unanimous take among all shows I listened to. Everyone thinks he was just okay last year and might be cooked. Most people think Miami can still be a playoff team but mostly due to Bosh.</li>
</ul>

<p>LeBron to Cleveland truly did catch people by surprise, even after the draft. Don’t let revisionist history change this one.</p>

<p>##The Kevin Love trade</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Rumors were swirling that Golden State would trade Klay Thompson and David Lee to Minnesota for Kevin Love.</p></li>

<li><p>Bill and Jalen would have both done Love for Klay/Lee if they were Golden State.</p></li>

<li><p>Zach Lowe says he would have done it too, and adds “even though it’s not enough to make you a contender, at least you’d become relevant for once and sell tickets, so it’s a good business move” and “Of course you trade Klay for Love. Those are the easiest types of players to get. Klay’s not bad but there are multiple players like him in every single draft.”</p></li>

<li><p>Bill says “Klay is solid, but I won’t be telling my grandkids about him like Love. I’d do it too.”</p></li>

<li><p>Chad Ford says “Golden State and Minnesota need to ‘get a room already’ and just make the trade. Everyone knows they’re going to do it.”</p></li>

<li><p>I happen to remember that Jerry West was the one who convinced Golden State’s owner not to do it, but I didn’t hear that mentioned in any of these shows.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>##Once Kevin Love is sent to Cleveland for Wiggins/Bennett, it seems to be viewed as a pretty equal trade for both teams.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Bill says Bennett is still an asset and will become an above average NBA player.</p></li>

<li><p>Bill says that Kevin Love is going to be the best player LeBron has ever played with (sidenote: I listened to one podcast from the following offseason and after Love was disappointing and Wiggins wins ROY, Bill says Cleveland would undo that trade in a heartbeat)</p></li>

<li><p>A couple of people have Kevin Love as their dark horse MVP pick.</p></li>

<li><p>People seem low on Kyrie. Bill says he’s a good stats/bad team guy a la Steve Francis/Stephon Marbury, who might not like taking a backseat to LeBron. Bill says Kyrie&rsquo;s lone All-Star pick wasn&rsquo;t earned and only due to injuries.</p></li>

<li><p>Everyone thinks Love is WAY better than Kyrie.</p></li>

<li><p>Jalen thinks Cleveland should trade Kyrie for Eric Bledsoe since Bledsoe would be a better 3rd banana.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>##Cleveland/The East:</p>

<ul>
<li>Once LeBron and Love join, almost no one has Cleveland as the best team in the East.</li>
<li>When I log on to FB (I should stop doing that btw), I see tons of people saying that LeBron handpicks his teams and only goes to where he can absolutely win, like Cleveland…but 6 of the 8 TNT/Open Court guys have Chicago &amp;gt; Cleveland, some of them even specifically saying “even if Rose is still hurt&rdquo; (people really like the Noah/Gasol frontcourt)</li>
<li>No one is high on Atlanta even thought they get the #1 seed in reality (60 wins).</li>
<li>Barkley predicted Atlanta would miss the playoffs. Danny/Nate say they take a step backwards and that Millsap/Horford are both cooked. Everyone else didn’t even mention them.</li>
<li>People say Indiana would be the best or second best team in the East if Paul George didn’t get hurt.</li>
<li>Chris Webber thinks Wall/Beal/Pierce in Washington makes them a semi-contender.</li>
</ul>

<p>##Golden State/The West:</p>

<ul>
<li>Okay, look…Golden State didn’t exactly come out of nowhere in 14-15. They were 51-31 the year before. But no one saw the jump coming. At all.</li>
<li>In my listening, people said they won’t be better than last year and that they’re adding a rookie coach, which is a mistake.</li>
<li>In the hour-long season preview, the TNT/Open Court guys mention GS/Curry ZERO times.</li>
<li>Bill Simmons says that Iguodala is cooked and that GS is misusing him (he won Finals MVP 8 months later)</li>
<li>The best I can find is that a few people think GS will be a 4 or 5 seed.</li>
<li>The only person who had a good Golden State take was Zach Lowe, who said he “likes Steph Curry as a dark horse MVP candidate in the future (not this season)” and people gasped when he said it.</li>
<li>Simmons/Lowe have their Western winners odds/rankings as: Spurs/Thunder/Grizzlies. Later Bill changes his mind and has Clippers #1.</li>
<li>SVG has Clippers #1.</li>
<li>7 of the 8 Open Court/TNT guys have Spurs as best team in the West. The other says OKC.</li>
</ul>

<p>##Nikola Jokic</p>

<ul>
<li>Nikola was famously drafted during a commercial break. Specifically during a Taco Bell commercial.</li>
<li>I DUG HARD to try to find anyone say anything about him during this offseason so that I could give them their due, but I couldn’t find a single thing. Not one.</li>
<li>During the actual draft when they come back from break, they read the names of the players that were drafted while the commercials were playing. They simply state that Jokic was drafted, but then start talking about how all the other guys picked around him (like Nick Johnson) could be sleepers.<br>
</li>
<li>In a Danny LaRoux/Nate Duncan podcast, I heard Nate say “I actually scouted the Serbian team, and you know who I really like? He went in the 2nd round. Micic, the PG for the Sixers. He was the best player for Serbia.”</li>
<li>So literally nothing about Jokic, even from people who specifically scouted Serbia.</li>
</ul>

<p>##Giannis Antetokounmpo:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Giannis was entering his sophomore year during this offseason. He was drafted 15th overall the year before in what many people called a horrible draft. He had a pretty good rookie season and caught people by surprise.</p></li>

<li><p>Bill Simmons says if you redrafted last year’s draft today, Michael Carter Williams and Giannis would go <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> in some order, but that neither would be top-7 picks in this class.</p></li>

<li><p>During the draft, someone offhand mentions that Giannis is pretty good, but “just wait!” for his brother Kostas to enter the league (as if he&rsquo;s the best of the brothers)</p></li>

<li><p>During the 2014 Rising Stars draft, Giannis goes 11th (behind Terrance Jones and Jared Sullinger) and Grant Hill defends his pick by saying “hey he’ll be an All-Star some day!”&hellip;Ernie kind of mockingly says “oh yeah? when? “ and Grant says “like 5 years from now but still.”</p></li>

<li><p>So yeah, people thought he’d be pretty okay, but not anywhere near DPOY/MVP/Finals MVP good. And that&rsquo;s after one season in the league, let alone during his draft.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>##Joel Embiid</p>

<ul>
<li>Joel, for those of you who don’t know, only started playing basketball at the age of 15. He played one season for Kansas, and was projected to be the #1 overall pick until he had a major injury. At this point in his career, he was famously trolling on Twitter, doing things like publicly hitting on Rhianna. He was the internet’s golden boy back then.</li>
<li>Post-injury: Bill and Jalen are higher on Embiid than most, and even they have him as the #3 pick who &ldquo;if he comes back healthy&rdquo; can be a 7’1” Serge Ibaka.</li>
<li>Later in a post-draft season preview, they say he could become an All-Star someday, but still refer to MCW as the “franchise guy.”</li>
<li>Chad Ford says teams are worried that Embiid might have Anemia or Hepatitis since he’s from Africa? This sounded really out of place to my 2024 ears, idk.</li>
<li>Chad Ford has Embiid going 6th in his mock.</li>
<li>Jonathan Tjarks has Embiid going #1 and says he’ll lead a “big man resurgence.” For those of you who don’t know, there were a lot of people claiming “the big man is dead in today’s NBA.” Now that we have Jokic/Embiid/Giannis as the past 3 MVPs, I would call this a big win for Tjarks.</li>
<li>SBNation has Embiid at #5</li>
</ul>

<p>##Rudy Gobert</p>

<p>Look, I know a lot of people are still low on him, but he’s a 4-time DPOY. He’s 10th All-Time in Win Shares/48, and is 50th all-time in career PER. In the 9 years that he’s been a starter, his teams have had a winning record 8 times (40-42 being the 9th). He’s been one of the best players for the past decade, no matter how you slice it.</p>

<ul>
<li>He was entering his sophomore season, and was drafted the previous year at 27 overall. Almost no one had him on their radar the following offseason. Here’s the only mention I could find in all of my listening:</li>
<li>Bill and Jalen have the Jazz as the 29th team in their preseason rankings. They say that their 3 best players are all bigs, which is bad roster construction (Kanter/Favors/Gobert). &ndash; - They call Kanter and Favors future all-stars, and have Gobert under them.</li>
<li>That’s it. That’s the only mention. Gobert was absent from the Rising Stars draft as well (Pero Antic and Jared Sullinger were in it)</li>
</ul>

<p>##Draymond Green</p>

<ul>
<li>Draymond Green was entering his THIRD season, and I heard ZERO mention of him on anything. He was also absent from the Rising Stars draft.</li>
<li>Not only were there zero mentions of him, there were TONS of mentions of David Lee (the man who had his job stolen by Draymond), with some people calling Lee one of the best power forwards in the league. No one saw Draymond coming.</li>
</ul>

<p>##Interesting assorted tidbits:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I heard a LOT of “I don’t know why they drafted _____ when they already have ____” or “the BPA was (good rookie) but I think they passed on him since they already have ___” for names like Channing Frye, Anthony Tolliver, Trey Burke, or Rodney Stuckey&hellip;maybe we shouldn’t fall into this trap in the modern day? Draft the BPA, guys. You’ll forget about the average guy you already have at that position later.</p></li>

<li><p>Jalen Rose, discussing the criticism the Spurs got for not signing Kawhi to a rookie extension “ It’s smart. They want to keep him hungry and give him a goal to fight for. This is for motivation to have a good season. He said he’ll be a Spur for life. He’s not going anywhere.”</p></li>

<li><p>Zach Lowe unprompted, when looking at MVP odds “Harden will never win an MVP.&rdquo; Harden was 2nd in MVP voting this season and won the award a few years later.</p></li>

<li><p>Simmons is rooting for KD to leave OKC in Free Agency in 2 years</p></li>

<li><p>Simmons is really high on Harden succeeding as the man in Houston because during a team USA training camp, KD/Harden/Paul George played a round robin 1on1 tourney and Harden had incredible, top-tier man-on-man defense during it.</p></li>

<li><p>Joe House bets the over on Toronto (43.5) because he’ll “never go against Drake on anything”</p></li>

<li><p>Jalen’s phone goes off during a show and Bill calls him out on it. Jalen says he’s “still getting used to the new technology”</p></li>

<li><p>Multiple mentions of how you can buy season tickets for the Bucks or Sixers for under $100. I don&rsquo;t think these were jokes.</p></li>

<li><p>Kyle Lowry had a bad rap at this time and was shipped off from multiple teams due to attitude. It sounds like he’s on the precipice of being a good starter or completely out of the league. Bill thinks he becomes a good player for Toronto and Jalen thinks he gets run off there too and runs out of chances in the league. He was a 0-time all-star during this discussion and went to 6 straight all-star games immediately afterward.</p></li>

<li><p>“Everyone knows LeBron and KD will pass the MVP back and forth for the next few years, but who comes in after that a few years from now?”
Bill says Anthony Davis might be an MVP some day and Lowe interrupts him and says “Davis WILL be an MVP.”
Lowe picks Steph Curry as his dark horse to win an MVP a few years from now…people kind of seem shocked.</p></li>

<li><p>Jalen Rose says that if he was playing against Blake Griffin, he would stick his foot under him when he’s landing from a jumpshot to throw him off of his game since he&rsquo;s not a shooter. No one flinched or addressed the comment. I found this interesting because Zaza did the same to Kawhi a couple of years later and it became a HUGE deal that everyone agreed was dirty.</p></li>

<li><p>When Bill discusses who teams will be tanking for in the upcoming draft, he mentions that the top 3 prospects are Jalil Okafor, Kelly Oubre, and Emmanual Mudiay</p></li>

<li><p>The Lakers owe a top-5 protected pick to Phoenix (Steve Nash trade) and Bill asks if they should tank. Jalen Rose and Ramona Shelburne both say no way, the Lakers and Kobe have too much integrity and they’ll will themselves into the playoffs. The Lakers finished 21-61 and drafted D’Lo with the #2 pick.</p></li>

<li><p>Everyone thinks New York looks good after acquiring Dalembert and Jose Calderon and Cleanthony Early. Thinks with Carmelo Anthony and Phil Jackson’s Triangle, that NY will be a very strong team…well, everyone except for Barkley. Barkley is low on the whole thing. NY finishes 17-65, with an even worse record than the Sixers, who were trying to lose on purpose.</p></li>

<li><p>Grantland’s first TV episode featured Bill Simmons and Jalen Rose with guests Zach Lowe, Jeff Van Gundy, and Doc Rivers. “Roundball Rock” was their theme song. NGL, that’s a pretty great lineup and song.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>##Draft tidbits (taken from draft telecast and draft preview/recap pods)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Jabari Parker is everyone’s #1 pretty much. Everyone thinks his floor is multiple time all-star. Safest pick in the draft.</p></li>

<li><p>Zach Lavine was drafted by the Timberwolves and mouths live on air “fuck me…”</p></li>

<li><p>Bruno Caboclo was a surprise 1st rounder and Fran Fraschilla famously says “he’s two years away from being two years away.”</p></li>

<li><p>When the Rockets are on the clock at #25, Bill Simmons predicts they pick a foreign guy to stash since they don’t have a roster slot. They do in fact pick a foreign guy: Clint Capela, and everyone jokes that he’s a non-factor and “one of the top 50 players of all time out of Switzerland”</p></li>

<li><p>PJ Hairston is drafted at #26 straight out of the D-League…this seems to be a really big deal. Everyone is talking about how odd it is. It’s a pretty common occurrence nowadays</p></li>

<li><p>Bill repeatedly says on-air that teams are making a mistake by passing up Cleanthony Early</p></li>

<li><p>The Sixers pick Jerami Grant at #39. The crew says that he kind of plays like his uncle Horace but that they don’t know how he’s going to fit in today’s NBA since he’s too small to be a power forward and he has absolutely zero shot/outside game at all. I guess props to him for figuring that out.</p></li>

<li><p>Jalen Rose mentions that too many foreign guys got taken and that lots of good US guys like Patrick Young should have been drafted instead.</p></li>

<li><p>Bill Simmons says the Nuggets are the big winners of the night “due to: (lists every single player they drafted or traded for aside from Jokic)”</p></li>

<li><p>Everyone loves Noah Vonleh. Barkley thinks he’ll be ROY</p></li>

<li><p>Most people love Elfriid Payton. Jalen and Bill think he’ll be ROY and predict a Gary Payton-like career for him.</p></li>

<li><p>I didn’t hear a single person pick Wiggins for ROY (the actual winner and #1 pick)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>##The Rising Stars draft
Okay, this wasn’t during the offseason, it was in the all-star break before it. But it was done live on TV with the TNT guys and I thought it was interesting. Here was the draft order:</p>

<ul>
<li>Anthony Davis (Kenny thinks he should’ve picked MCW)</li>
<li>Damian Lillard</li>
<li>Bradley Beal</li>
<li>MCW</li>
<li>Andre Drummond</li>
<li>Tim Hardaway Jr</li>
<li>Harrison Barnes</li>
<li>Trey Burke</li>
<li>Terrence Jones</li>
<li>Jared Sullinger</li>
<li>Giannis</li>
<li>Mason Plumlee</li>
<li>Jonas Valanciunas</li>
<li>Victor Oladipo</li>
<li>Dion Waiters</li>
<li>Steven Adams</li>
<li>Kelly Olynyk</li>
<li>Pero Antic</li>
</ul>

<p>####Not included in the exercise:</p>

<p>Rudy Gobert, CJ McCollum, Draymond Green, Khris Middleton, or reigning #1 overall pick Anthony Bennett</p>

<p>##ESPN/Skip and SAS:</p>

<p>I tried watching some ESPN clips (Skip and Steven A Smith) but had to turn it off. I started watching one where they were yelling and mocking an ESPN top-5 players list for not having Kobe or Wade on it (honestly neither one was even top-10 from 2014 onward), both hate Chris Paul being part of the list, and Skip wants Bynum on the list instead of Dwight Howard. Skip wants Carmelo in the top-5.</p>

<p>They seemed VERY upset by all of this but Kobe/Wade/Melo never finish top-10 in MVP voting again (and Lakers/Heat/Knicks have 3 of the worst records in the league after this), Bynum is out of the league immediately after this, and Chris Paul has multiple top-10 MVP finishes after this. Their opinions were way worse than the content they were criticizing, and they were SO upset about it. I couldn’t do it. I don’t know how people watch this crap. I could only watch 5 minutes of them, so that’s the only input you’ll get from Skip or SAS on my list.</p>

<p>##Takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There are probably some guys on current rosters who have a 68 rating on 2K and who no one ever talks about that will make an All-NBA roster some day.</p></li>

<li><p>Experts don’t know everything. Even the guys who look the best from this exercise had maybe a 30% success rate.</p></li>

<li><p>And….add your own! What sticks out to you?</p></li>
</ul>

      <label for="l9u8u6o" class="commentText"><p>On Jokic: at the time, I was writing for Roundball Mining Company (Nuggets / ESPN Truehoop, unpaid but got me media credentials) so I was in the media room during that draft.  Sat next to Maya Starks (Altitude courtside reporter; she mostly commented on the fashion sense of the guys being drafted) and a guy from Yahoo whose name I don&rsquo;t remember but who was *livid* about the Nuggets trading McDermott because he was sure dude was gonna be a future star.</p>

<p>Post-draft, Nuggets&rsquo; management comes down from the draft room to do interviews.  Nobody in the media room that day even asked a question about Jokic until Tim Connelly was like &ldquo;anybody going to ask about the kid we drafted in the second round?&rdquo; and one of the reporters (might have been Woody Paige; I was on the opposite side of the room and couldn&rsquo;t see for sure) was like &ldquo;OK. Uh, can you tell us about the kid you drafted in the second round?&rdquo; And then TC gushed about how he thought this was a major steal, and he pointed out some stuff on the stat sheets we&rsquo;d all been given for his season in the Adriatic League, and he was like &ldquo;18 year old seven footers playing against grown men in the second-best professional league in the world don&rsquo;t put up solid stats like this. He&rsquo;s a power forward with the vision of a point guard. If we can get his body into NBA shape, he could be really, really good.&rdquo; He pointed out that then-current Nugget Joffrey Lauvergne helped the team scout both Jokic and Nurkic.  (By comparison, the draft where TC got Tyler Lydon, missing OG Anunoby by one pick after trading back to get Trey Lyles and sending Donovan Mitchell to the Jazz, he looked completely defeated like he knew he whiffed.)</p>

<p>A couple things I wrote about Jokic at the time:</p>

<p>* &ldquo;Both of the big guys are 19 years old, been playing for 3-4 years, and are doing really well in a fairly competitive league. Some of their advanced metrics are off the charts. By the time those guys are 22, it&rsquo;s possible one or both of them will be freakishly good. I&rsquo;m not sure what more you want from a stash option.&rdquo;</p>

<p>* &ldquo;he&rsquo;s been playing for even less time than Nurkic &ndash; about 3 years. Started out as a 6&rsquo;4&rdquo; point guard, then grew six inches and became a PF. He&rsquo;s still at that stage of development where coaches are trying things to see what sticks. He&rsquo;s an excellent passer, uses his body well for rebounding, and has a decent-but-not-great shooting touch (shoots around 70% on ft, doesn&rsquo;t really have 3 point range.) It&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s out there taking Bynum 3 pointers outside of the game plan.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l9tqtpl" class="commentText"><p>This is a great walk down memory lane. Awesome job!</p>

<p>The media was, in my opinion, very biased towards Mark Jackson. For most of this past decade, they&rsquo;ve brought his name up for every coaching vacancy. No teams are ever interested, because he actually really sucked, and feuded with the Warriors front office.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thinking this may have skewed their Warriors takes. Because it was &ldquo;their guy&rdquo; that got fired, it would be an insult to expect the team to get better. The only real criticism of Kerr was his inexperience. Well&hellip; before Jackson got to the Warriors, <em>he had never coached anywhere either</em>. Plus, Kerr permitted the team to hire established assistants. Jackson didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>There was a Warriors reddit post with a very long list of all the crazy shit that Mark Jackson did that got him fired.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/warriors/comments/42b5ne/comment/cz93961/" target="_blank">https://np.reddit.com/r/warriors/comments/42b5ne/comment/cz93961/</a></p>

<p>I don not believe any of this stuff was ever talked about nationally.</p>

<p>Draymond Green had actually already had his coming-out party, in the playoffs. Games 6 and 7, he put up 14-14-4 with 5 blocks, then 24-7-3-2-2. But given the context, it seems to have &ldquo;gone under the radar.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="l9uzd4s" class="commentText"><p>TBF we already went to the playoffs in 12-13 (Harden&rsquo;s first season in Houston) and we were supposed to do more than that in 13-14 after adding Dwight. Harden was a ghost the first 2 games of the Blazers series in Houston, putting us in a 0-2 hole, and showed up too little too late before we lost in 6 on Dame&rsquo;s buzzer beater, it was a big disappointment to not get out of the first round in what was a very winnable 4-5 matchup. So it&rsquo;s understandable the media would be way down on him the offseason directly after.</p>

<p>That article shows exactly why Warriors fans celebrated when the team got sold and why they booed the new owner during a tanking season.</p>

<p>We were so used to being never good enough - a second round exit at best kind of team, so Curry&rsquo;s explosion and Kerr&rsquo;s great coaching caught absolutely everyone by surprise.</p>

<p>Jesus fucking Christ. Jokes/narratives like this get taken so seriously the alt-right decide to have a rally in our city 7 years ago.</p>

<p>The reality they encountered was being out-rallied 1000 to 1.</p>

<hr>

<p>Literally 10s of thousands of us showed up for a march against them, and the reports of our gathering caused only several dozen of the alt-righters to show their faces. But u/yzdaskullmonkey can&rsquo;t imagine a &ldquo;non-racist Boston fan?!&rdquo;</p>

<hr>

<p>Boston&rsquo;s hella racist, but most of it is a paralyzing, toxic, structural racism that has resulted in a staggering disparities in wealth between white and black. Focusing on fictional bogeymen (like &ldquo;Boston Celtics fans are racist&rdquo;) rather than  insidious racist realities of Boston are what keep real changes from being made.</p>

<p>Bill Russell getting his number retired with only the people he wanted there in attendance because his own fans had been so horrifically awful to him is a stain that&rsquo;s not going to leave.</p>

<p>A jersey retirement closed to the public is just unheard of, and I can&rsquo;t think of another player in any sport who had that.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It has faded sufficiently for Russell by 1999 that he attended a 3 hour long number retirement ceremony at a packed Boston Garden with tears streaming down his face as he soaked in the adulation from the Boston faithful.</p>

<p>Was racism a part of why he refused a number retirement ceremony initially? Absolutely. He was a private person and Boston was a &lsquo;flea market of racism.&rsquo; He couldn&rsquo;t stop Red from honoring him, but he wouldn&rsquo;t attend a public ceremony.</p>

<p>But Russ knew that 1999 wasn&rsquo;t 1972. People, and cities, change. Judging Boston by Russ&rsquo;s attitudes to number retirement ceremonies should encompass both his attitudes: his toward 1972 Boston, and his toward 1999 Boston.</p>

<p>My two cents, anyway.</p>

      <label for="l9trchm" class="commentText"><p>Very good thread. I&rsquo;d have much to comment on GS, but I&rsquo;ll just take the time to think about how Cleveland got 2 #1 ovr picks in 2 consecutive years and none played any significant role aside from being bait for the Kevin Love trade. Adding Kyrie, and you get to see that CLE had 1st ovr picks in 3 of the 4 the years LeBron played for Miami (and LeBron ended up playing/winning with the guy that was drafted in that 1 year of 2012, AD).</p>

<p>Trying to think about it, the sixers had the same bad luck. These dudes had the 3rd ovr pick for 2 straight years (2014-15) and the 1st ovr pick ALSO for 2 straight years (2016-17). So 4 straight seasons with a top 3 pick. 1 of 4 is still on the team and he&rsquo;s the only one being the franchise player. For a team that prided themselves as &ldquo;the Process&rdquo;, it looks kinda bad. But hey, not everyone can be OKC and draft generational superstars 3 years in a row.</p>

<p>Meanwhile during that SAME period, the Lakers also had 3 consecutive years drafting the 2nd ovr pick, from D&rsquo;Lo, Ingram and Zo. None of them ever finished their rookie contracts with LA.</p>

<p>The 2010s draft classes were sure fun. There are lots of other facts that I&rsquo;ll let the others develop.</p>

      <label for="l9xik79" class="commentText"><p>Yes, I remember him saying he had verbally committed to Phil Jackson, and was excited to work with his previous coach. But when he got the warriors officer, he just couldn’t resist the opportunity of coaching a team with such amazing talent (mostly talking about Steph). Makes sense for the season the warriors had before he came there vs the disappointing season of the knicks.</p>

<p>There wasn&rsquo;t really criticism of Kerr not taking up nyk,  and iirc, it was a regular offer that he was pretty tempted by</p>

      <label for="l9upz3a" class="commentText"><p>Hawks came out of nowhere and had an invincible month. It was pretty shocking as they were viewed as a team that floated at playoffs and would regress after Joe Johnson and Josh Smith left. It was an interesting run.</p>

<p>Then people predicted them to win some games against Cavaliers only to be thrashed pretty quickly.</p>

<p>I also remember a Knicks-Wolves game at MSG, it was at a point that both teams had terrible records, where Wolves had a lot of injured players and had to call up a random name. It was a game both teams were trying to lose for 1st draft pick.</p>

<p>Nice post OP</p>

<p>The only person who had a good Golden State take was Zach Lowe, who said he “likes Steph Curry as a dark horse MVP candidate in the future (not this season)” and people gasped when he said it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hey now, it&rsquo;s not no one because I called that.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/34rkhb/sources_warriors_curry_to_be_named_mvp/cqxgz8z/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/34rkhb/sources_warriors_curry_to_be_named_mvp/cqxgz8z/</a></p>

<p>My analysis:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He was 4th in Win Share last year and the guys ahead of him were KD, Lebron, and Love. I didn&rsquo;t think that KD was likely to repeat and with Lebron and Love teaming up, it was unlikely that Lebron would put up MVP numbers. Then you factor in Steph&rsquo;s continued improvement, especially on defense, and getting a better coach and <sup>28</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub> odds just seemed waaaay too long. He wasn&rsquo;t even in the top 10 for MVP oddsmakers and that just seemed absurd to me then and now to everyone.</p>

<p>I happen to remember that Jerry West was the one who convinced Golden State’s owner not to do it, but I didn’t hear that mentioned in any of these shows.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IIRC this news only came out in 2015 after they won the chip. TV shows in summer 2014 wouldn&rsquo;t know this</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I log on to FB (I should stop doing that btw), I see tons of people saying that LeBron handpicks his teams and only goes to where he can absolutely win, like Cleveland…but 6 of the 8 TNT/Open Court guys have Chicago
 Cleveland, some of them even specifically saying “even if Rose is still hurt&rdquo; (people really like the Noah/Gasol frontcourt)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TBH a lot of that was the old heads on the panel not understanding the change in the game around that time—those old heads overrated that frontcourt because they overrated that brand of basketball in the Pace and Space era</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also point out that LeBron handpicking that Cavs team was WAY stronger than the <sup>13</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub> Heat team he left LOL</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In my listening, people said they won’t be better than last year and that they’re adding a rookie coach, which is a mistake.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The old heads overrated Mark Jackson&rsquo;s coaching (many of them are prob personal friends with Mark). In hindsight, it&rsquo;s easy to see how his archaic offensive &ldquo;system&rdquo; and play calls were holding the Warriors back. That was less clear before Kerr took over—and it would have been even less clear to the TNT old heads who are largely stuck in &ldquo;better in my era&rdquo; without really understanding pace and space</p>

<p>The Jokic and Giannis ones aren&rsquo;t surprising to me, TBH. Neither were anywhere close to what they&rsquo;d later become</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan Tjarks has Embiid going #1 and says he’ll lead a “big man resurgence.” For those of you who don’t know, there were a lot of people claiming “the big man is dead in today’s NBA.” Now that we have Jokic/Embiid/Giannis as the past 3 MVPs, I would call this a big win for Tjarks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah that was a good call (the Jahlil Okafor hype aged REALLY badly tho LOL)</p>

<p>On Gobert and Draymond—neither were as good as they&rsquo;d later become AND NBA media (Esp then) drastically underrates defense</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I heard a LOT of “I don’t know why they drafted _____ when they already have ___” or “the BPA was (good rookie) but I think they passed on him since they already have __” for names like Channing Frye, Anthony Tolliver, Trey Burke, or Rodney Stuckey&hellip;maybe we shouldn’t fall into this trap in the modern day? Draft the BPA, guys. You’ll forget about the average guy you already have at that position later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Coming from someone who watches a LOT of European soccer, not a fan of this BPA stuff. For me, drafting for fit makes sense unless the talent gap is overwhelming TBH</p>

<p>I did not know Jeremi Grant&rsquo;s uncle is Horace Grant. I also didn&rsquo;t hear about Zach saying &ldquo;fuck&rdquo; when hearing the Wolves drafted him lol.</p>

<p>Jalen Rose is just a dirty player.</p>

<p>Interesting how little respect Curry and GS had those days. The Splash Brothers weren&rsquo;t known and the old guard (Kobe, Wade, Melo) were in tanking-but-not-tanking situations.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember if it was the 2015 or the 2016 season, but the play Curry made where he mishandled the ball and easily evaded 4 defenders for a turn-around 3 made him massive. Super viral moment, especially with Kerr reacting the way he did. Curry had the ultra greenlight at that point and players hadn&rsquo;t figured him out yet.</p>

<p>Giannis&rsquo; viral moment came when he jumped over a guy for an alley-oop dunk. I feel like when those plays make rounds, they create superstars.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>maybe we shouldn’t fall into this trap in the modern day? Draft the BPA, guys. You’ll forget about the average guy you already have at that position later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m more of an NFL guy, and this has always driven me crazy there. With very few exceptions you shouldn&rsquo;t care about your current roster when drafting unless the prospects available are close. There is so much turnover in professional sports that in 2-3 years that position you thought you were set at suddenly becomes a need that you wished you had filled with that guy you passed on.</p>

      <label for="l9v5nm2" class="commentText"><p>Great thread. 2014 draft was the only one I followed closely. There was <em>so</em> much hype, people were saying stuff like if you were in the top-10 you were guaranteed a franchise player, Slam magazine recreated the iconic 1996 cover, Dante Exum had a Foot Locker commercial about practicing signing his autograph. Then half the guys were busts or underachieved for various reasons. It&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t put much stock into draft coverage anymore.</p>

      <label for="l9vgctq" class="commentText"><p>I will say one thing in those experts&rsquo; defense.</p>

<p>Love really was better than Kyrie heading into that season, it&rsquo;s just that he was a post player, and LeBron led offenses try to keep the post clear for him. It neutered a healthy chunk of Love&rsquo;s game playing on those teams, but he was definitely a good player for them.</p>

<p>So, Kyrie seeming like the better player was a given when Love was having to give up his main offensive weapon.</p>

<p>I mean, the season before he joined Cleveland he was All-NBA 2nd team, and All-Star, and got MVP votes, Kyrie has never gotten MVP votes.</p>

<p>So, I think they were right about Love being the better player, but didn&rsquo;t figure out that he&rsquo;d be giving up some of his scoring to better fit what they needed - just like Chris Bosh did for LeBron&rsquo;s Heat teams.</p>

Missed first 2 games vs Houston.  Still, they were up 3-1, and basically winning g6, then we all remember the Josh Smith, Corey Brewer comeback.</p>

      <label for="l9xkda7" class="commentText"><p>Kerr benching David Lee for Draymond is one of the biggest turning points in NBA history. Advanced stats people had been begging for this move as they HATED David Lee and loved Draymond. Lee was the classic <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> PF from that era who couldn&rsquo;t shoot or defend at all that got a great reputation and a lot of money despite not helping teams win at all. Draymond providing an immediate massive boost over David Lee killed Lee&rsquo;s archetype pretty quickly (with Kevin Love having to transition to a shooter to still be valuable) and caused people to value defense massively more. It also heavily elevated stats guy as they were right about how much better Draymond was over Lee.</p>

      <label for="l9xrc7z" class="commentText"><p>awesome stuff! the sixers starting their weird science experiment in 2013 got me back into the sport after i stopped caring as a kid, so this was the first offseason i paid full attention to. one thing which i don&rsquo;t you mentioned is that this draft was so hyped - it was like the anti-2024 and i don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s been as much anticipation for a class since. in hindsight there were a lot of good players, but it was a disappointment to what to people thought it&rsquo;d be.</p>

<p>I’m a die hard Cleveland fan that would read a letter a week with sports updates from my dad, who like a day or two before the trade sent me a letter that Lebron might come back. Later that week one of our swim qual instructors made us raise our hand if we were from OH and broke the news to us that Lebron was traded to the Cavs. Wild experience.</p>

<p>I missed all the things you brought up about that offseason, thanks for the recap.</p>

The snapshots will be accurate to the time they were taken &ndash; not subject to the edits of hindsight. It seems like most of the best/most in depth stuff is always in articles, especially 10 years ago, so it&rsquo;s a good resource.</p>

<p>That sounds silly because it sounds like something a celebrity with a secret would avoid these days. Even so— there were paparazzi then too. The internet was just a little bit younger then, and Reddit sleuthing was a craze</p>

      <label for="l9whoe9" class="commentText"><p>I love how to this day people still spin Lebron’s (he himself did this too) move back to Cleveland as “trying to bring CLE a championship” when in fact they had Kyrie and the trade assets to get Kevin love with the East still being wide open. He was building super teams like he always has since 2010. It also rubbed me the wrong way that he said he didn’t want his kids to grow up incredibly wealthy in a city like Miami because it’s not reality and yet four years later that doesn’t matter and he moves his kids to Los fucking Angeles lol. I was Lebron fan until this very offseason that OP is focusing on. Nice job on the post!</p>

      <label for="l9wiwz2" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I go back and forth on Bron. On one hand, “The Decision” was such a bad look. Repeated team jumping is a horrible look. Trying to be GM has probably cost him a title or two (like demanding Russ instead of letting the office work, etc)</p>

<p>On the other hand, I don’t like how often his Finals record is taken as a negative, or his wins get dismissed due to having good teammates. Kyrie/Harden/Durant went to zero finals. Durant/Westbrook/Harden/Ibaka only went to one and didn’t win. KG/Pierce/Allen/Rondo were 1-1. Kawhi/PG/Westbrook/Harden = 0.</p>

<p>But a player going to 10 finals doesn’t mean anything because he had some good teammates?</p>

<p>I see everything you’re saying and agree with it. He’s a complicated player to try to dissect. He also gave people way too many things they can use against him/to dislike him over the years.</p>
