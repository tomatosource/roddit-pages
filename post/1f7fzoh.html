      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1f7fzoh/i_dream_of_dirk_nowitzki/"><p>I dream of Dirk Nowitzki</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Maybe two or three times a month, I dream I’m in the G League, trying to make it to the NBA. I’m good, but I’m not good enough. But Dirk Nowitzki has my back, and I dream in my dream that I can do it. In my dreams I’m in my 20s, but Dirk is still the Dirk of now. He’s old before his time, his body is shot. He moves like it hurts and every motion goes slowly. But he encourages me, coaching me from the sidelines, giving me tips or a heads up or just telling me to stay with the play. I hustle on D and run down long rebounds and keep my work rate high. I work on my corner 3s, I keep the ball moving, I make sure to shoot only when it makes sense. I cut, but it’s the G League, so no one passes. He tells me to keep my head up, keep working on my shot, take defenders out of the paint with movement and timing. I try, but everyone else is chasing the iso step back. I play with four guys who are the nightmare version of James Harden, all the moves with none of the ability, and I can’t show what I can do. It’s frustrating and I know it means I will fail.</p>

<p>I don’t have a particular enthusiasm for Dirk Nowitzki, though I respect his game. I’m older than he is, though only by a matter of months, and it’s nearly impossible to fall in love with a player you feel is almost a peer. I grew up too early to think of the Mavs with any fondness. I’ve seen Julius Erving fly, the endless sunny autumn of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bird and Magic trade MVPs and titles, Mike soar before he shaved his head. I watched Don Nelson do the oddest stuff in Milwaukee, I saw the Bad Boys beat up the league, and Run TMC made me believe decades earlier than I should have. By the time Dirk shows up, the kind of fandom I have is set. My childhood self imagined being a small guard hitting a game winning layup over Eaton or Rodman or Robinson, not a giant swishing from 18 feet.</p>

<p>Dirk is an all timer, but he was never my guy. It’s not that I didn’t respect him, it’s that I didn’t respect him enough. For too long my image of him was the hole in the wall after the Warriors took out the Mavs in 07. My respect for him has grown, but it’s only since I’ve started dreaming of Dirk that I have really looked at how he played day in and day out. Not just the high leverage moments in the playoffs, but each play. Honestly, in the 00s I probably would have said he was soft, missing heart or toughness or something else that said Euro taking jumpers instead of driving (his driving never seemed to count, even when he yammed it down. Even when the entire defense was playing him and not the rest of his team). His MVP year was much better than I remembered. He was great well before the disrespect ended.</p>

<p>I’m not going to make it on talent. I hit my layups. I can shoot the 3 ok, but I’m best from the corner, and that limits my impact on the defense. I know not to take long 2s. I’m a good team defender, but I’m slow enough side to side that I rely on defending from behind more than I have the chops for. He tells me I should take more shots. Not a lot more, but that I’m passing out when I’m open and I don’t need to. That I don’t need to take 3s off the dribble to have value to a team looking for hustle and heart and some ability to spread the floor. That I can make it if I play within myself. I don’t believe him but I keep trying.</p>

<p>I don’t think 2011 was quite as amazing as I think most of this sub does; it’s not Duncan in 03, nor is it Hakeem in 94, to me the greatest carry job by a super star; and even if he failed at the final hurdle LeBron in 2018 was insane. Dirk had a great team that year (and Mark Cuban should never stop feeling ashamed for tearing that crew down). Obviously they don’t win without him. Obviously the basketball gods owed him a good supporting cast after so many playoffs where he was a monster, let down by under performing teammates, bad decisions by coaches, or the most one sided refereeing that didn’t involve Forum Blue. But I feel like focusing on the year he made it over the hump diminishes the rest of his all time career. The difference wasn’t Dirk learning to win or becoming a harder man or whatever other myth of toughness he needed in the popular imagination, it was having a team that didn’t fall apart when calls didn’t go their way or the other team played a few possessions of good D.</p>

<p>When we aren’t playing basketball we vaccinate babies. Dirk is gentle with newborns, he keeps them calm. They cry a little, but settle in. He hands them back to their parents with a small happy smile on his face, knowing he’s done his part for them to grow up healthy and happy and ready for the world.</p>

<p>I used to think that Steve Nash going to the Suns was a turning point for the league, and good in every way: unleashing speed, unshackling the 3, forcing defenses to re-think everything from the ground up. Now I think that if they had more time together they could have been greater than what they achieved, and maybe the league would have been better for it. Don Nelson almost had it. Maybe there’s a world where he grabs the future even harder than he did, that he reaches past the D’Antoni era and they shoot 3s like some unholy combination of Steph Curry and KAT in 2019. Maybe Dirk looks more like Duncan than like Barkley in all time lists.</p>

<p>Life is hard right now. Family issues, illness, money problems, work. I struggle with sleeping, so I take melatonin. It sets my dreams on fire, makes them alive and real and so incredibly vivid every single night. Dirk appears only when it’s easy for me to sleep; there is no struggle, no tosses and turns, I lay in one position and I wake up in the same posture. Dirk means I’m getting a good sleep, something that heals me. Even inside my dreams I recognize Dirk Nowitzki is what things getting better looks like for me. I don’t know I can make the NBA even with Dirk at my back. But I know what I need to do. Push the ball handler where my coach wants him. Box out when the ball is in the air. Don’t stop moving when it’s in someone’s hands. Get that 10 day contract first, then I’ll be Alex Caruso.</p>

<p>It’s late in the game. It’s close, but we are ahead. I’ve left some marks on this game, but it feels pointless. We aren’t a team, we are a showcase, and I’m not shiny enough. Even the crowd is bored. Yet another possession bogs down, and finally even the iso hero currently on ball knows he has to pass out. He throws it out to the top of the arc, and the guy who catches it does something he’s never done in his life: passes it quickly to catch out a scrambling defense. It hits my hands while I’m standing in what was the weakside corner. The defender was ball watching, he’s out of position, he’s leaping at me. Too late in his movement, too early in his jump. I don’t need to think about him anymore. I take the 3 and I know it’s in before it leaves my fingers. No iron, just the ripple of the netting and curses from their bench. The other team takes a timeout, their coach grilling them about their defense. I pump my fist. My coach is smiling, he pulls me in and tells me that I’ve done a good job. He gives the willing passer even better feedback; he probably needs it, he&rsquo;s probably earned it. I hear Dirk yelling congratulations. He tells me I can do it again.</p>

      <label for="ll78uor" class="commentText"><p>Never seen the Sopranos. After all the mafia movies of the 90s, I just didn&rsquo;t have the taste for that setting anymore; and I went to high school with a lot of Italians who wanted to be seen as wiseguys, which was extremely off putting. That said, that&rsquo;s two Sopranos mentions in these replies, so I guess I need to start.</p>

Btw not a flex I only had a short 2 year period where I could dunk off one foot with one hand, if I was super warmed up.</p>
