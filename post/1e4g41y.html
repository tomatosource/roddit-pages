</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Cannot understand why people are calling Bronny&rsquo;s form a slump. To be a slump you have to have been coming off some sort of higher average and to date he has not reached any such average. His form is not a slump. His form is what you get when you take a 6&rsquo;1 player, ranked 7th best on the 88th ranked college team in the country who averaged a paltry 4.8 ppg and you throw him in a league full of teams that would be equivalent to final 4 teams in march madness. His opponents are a significant mark up from what he faced at USC and as such you would expect nothing better than a 4ppg average and a drop off in percentages. Today for example he was the worst player, bench included, on his team, despite having the equal second most minutes. He was barely cut out for college ball, is definitely not cut out for G league and has zero business being on an NBA court as a player.</p>

<p>And LeBron should be blamed for this because he&rsquo;s been hyping his kids for years and said numerous times that his ultimate goal is to play with one of his sons. Of course that creates and immense amount of pressure on his kids and they feel they can&rsquo;t be anything else other than basketball players to not disappoint their father. And he&rsquo;s doing it just to feed his own ego.</p>

<p>I am not a LeBron hater and actually admire his career and the player he still is&hellip; but he definitely deserves a lot of criticism for this.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I guess some doctor kids do and others don&rsquo;t. He can all agree that the pressure usually exists but not all doctors kids want to pursue the same career as their parents. For example, my GF&rsquo;s parents are both doctors and she never felt interested in that career.</p>

<p>I can share a personal story to back this up: My father (who isn&rsquo;t a doctor) always said that his dream was to see one of his sons becoming a doctor. So when I decided to follow a different career path, he got disappointed at me so my younger brother felt that he had become the family&rsquo;s doctor. Since that in our country you have to be on the top 1% of the students to be admitted and he couldn&rsquo;t enter med school in the first try, he went to Pharmacy University for a year to prepare himself to apply for med school. Now here&rsquo;s the thing&hellip; my brother is hemophobic (has blood phobia) and he was always extremely good at math and physics, so he changed his mind, drop out from pharmacy school, went to study Electrical Engineering and today he&rsquo;s very happy with his career.</p>

<p>My point is that parents should never pressure their kids to follow a career path against their will. What LeBron is doing is definitely bad parenting.</p>

      <label for="ldfgz18" class="commentText"><p>Why do you need to make it clear that you&rsquo;re not a &ldquo;hater&rdquo;, just because you have criticism of someone or are going against a popular opinion? It&rsquo;s not just you, I just don&rsquo;t understand how everyone these days has to preface that before they say something about someone or something, that doesn&rsquo;t praise or go along with the popular narrative.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t &ldquo;hate&rdquo; Lebron James at all. I don&rsquo;t know him personally enough in any way to hate him. I&rsquo;ve never been a fan of this play style, or how he carries himself on and sometimes off the court. I also don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s the best player to ever to grace a NBA court either. That doesn&rsquo;t mean I &ldquo;hate&rdquo; him.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that people can&rsquo;t just say what they mean these days without that ridiculous phrase being thrown back at them when it regards certain people. Who is Lebron James in the grand scheme of things to not have any criticism thrown his way? Especially when it&rsquo;s deserved?</p>

      <label for="ldfemr1" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s also always been pretty good at playing the media both ways&hellip; this feels, to me, like overplaying his hand. It&rsquo;s one thing when you&rsquo;re the one on the line and you&rsquo;ve been doing this shit since you were in high school. If anything, you could say James admirably handled himself when his career, until now, is taken as a whole.</p>

<p>Considering the scrutiny, the fact Kobe played for the majority of LBJ&rsquo;s career and the rise of a player like Steph, social media, NBA media, YouTubers and an endless sea of podcasts&hellip; many of them actually great&hellip; I think for all that was going on, the fact he engaged at all and kept narratives going while playing at a high level, winning rings, dealing with (and creating) drama, LeBron definitely has the constitution for this shit.</p>

<p>But his son? Throwing your goddamned kid into this circus and just expecting him to walk the high wire with no net other than the lifestyle and money that put him on that wire? It&rsquo;s hard to see this as not being stultifying and suffocating for the kid. It HAS to be.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not Bronny they should be hard on&hellip; it&rsquo;s his dad. He and the Lakers organization fucked up here. I guarantee that kid will need DeRozan&rsquo;s book on his own mental health issues by 2025. I am sure there are current and former players in the league who see this slow motion train wreck happening and thinking the worst possible outcomes but feel helpless to stop it.</p>

      <label for="ldfbi01" class="commentText"><p>Ya I’m not questioning if Bronny James wants 8 million dollars and an nba card with his face on it. It’s objectively very weird for an nba franchise to use a draft pick and roster spot and part of their payroll so a non-nba quality player can get some fun spending money and a cool and fun opportunity. And it’s weird for an active nba player to want this over improving his team to try and win a ring. How many times can I repeat myself here lol.</p>

Also Lebron took a paycut so that the Lakers have more cushion in their cap space for wasting money when they sign Bronny. If Bronny does not go in the NBA, Lebron would have just taken the 50+ mil/year deal instead of the current deal he got. If Lebron took that 50+ mil deal, he could just give 8 mil in that to Bronny lol.</p>

<p>Bron chose wade/Bosh instead of Melo and went to Kyrie+Love  whiles getting rid of Wiggs.</p>

<p>As of now i agree Bronny isnt even close to been a Nba player but parents will do crazy shit for their blood so i dont know why people are acting confused.</p>

<p>Again Lebrons overrall roster contructions has gotten him 4 rings if thats  not a great gm then so be it. I dont know want to know what kind of standards you have.</p>

      <label for="ldf2qv8" class="commentText"><p>Presti was forced to trade Harden due to team ownership not wanting to go over the soft cap to keep him. He definitely should have gotten more in the return though. It&rsquo;s not comparable to the Westbrook trade at all. Westbrook was also very obviously washed up in comparison to his old self, and had already shown his inability to adapt as he aged. I literally legitimately laughed out loud when the news broke of that trade. I texted my friends how hilarious it was that Lebron was destroying his chance for more rings. I was not alone in this obvious assessment.</p>

<p>Lebron is a great player, not a great GM, and thats ok.</p>

<p>Lebron has 4 rings by orchestrating his own roster thats a great gm. You choose to skip that part over and over again lol.</p>

<p>If the end goal is to get rings LeGm has done everything right, even Danny Ainge who is known to be a &ldquo;great&rdquo; gm has only 1-2 ring to his name as a Gm.</p>

      <label for="ldf2zd0" class="commentText"><p>Agreed. I honestly think they&rsquo;re using his health care situation as leverage. Basically saying, you couldn&rsquo;t see his &ldquo;full potential&rdquo; because of the cardiac arrest ordeal.</p>

<p>If he were to go back to school for another year, he&rsquo;d get exposed when there&rsquo;s no excuses, proving he&rsquo;s not actually pro level.</p>

He’ll feel like hes ‘earned’ his own wealth and if he uses this great opportunity he might develop into enough of a talent to earn a contract, and even if he went to another professional league or made contacts n got into coaching, podcasting, anything with this base he’d turn this unearned platform into something of his own. Generational wealth is nice but if some ppl down the bloodline can earn a few million here and there itll def help that wealth last</p>

      <label for="ldf9on3" class="commentText"><p>Maybe when you are a basketball god like LeBron it&rsquo;s hard to understand that other people can&rsquo;t necessarily flip the switch and dominate like you can. Add in some typical &ldquo;my kid is the greatest&rdquo; parental delusion and you can sort of see how things got to this point.</p>

<p>The kid has some level of talent to get a scholarship and get some minutes at USC, which is almost the worst part of it. If he were just hopeless D3 level then there&rsquo;s no way they could&rsquo;ve pushed it this far.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually kind of a shame from that standpoint because if he&rsquo;d just been some random kid from Iowa with the same skill set then he probably goes D1 to a mid-major and everyone in the community is really proud of him, but now it&rsquo;s just &ldquo;wow he sucks&rdquo; because he&rsquo;s been thrust into this position.</p>

      <label for="ldeq3zr" class="commentText"><p>It’s wild that his own dad basically sabotaged his son’s career for his own selfish gain of playing with him and fast tracking the process. If the kid stayed in college a few years and developed he might have actually turned out to be a role player, instead he’ll play out this contract and embarrass himself and then never step foot on a professional basketball court again.</p>

      <label for="ldeqknf" class="commentText"><p>People who don’t know college ball need to stop with this, staying in college was not gonna make him an nba caliber player. He is undersized and bad couldn’t even do anything on a shit college team. His only chance at the nba was this and he got a 8 million contract from it. Bronny would be a complete idiot to stay in college and not take the opportunity and the money now.</p>

      <label for="lderxwu" class="commentText"><p>Bronny likely has the lowest ceiling of any player in the draft considering he grew up with much better trainers, chefs and coaches his entire life. I agree, I think he maybe jumps from a 4ppg guy at USC to a 12ppg player at a different college by his senior year, his draft stock would be even worse by then</p>

For not running the team with the same competitiveness as their father. Jeanie bus has made so many terrible moves since she&rsquo;s been the owner. She needs to sell the team. I&rsquo;m completely convinced at this point that this team is unsalvageable until she is gone. Until the buss ownership is gone. They do not deserve the franchise that their father built.</p>

      <label for="ldffxdz" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not a slump, but to be fair, I don&rsquo;t know why people are so annoyed at his spot in the draft. He was 55th&hellip; The chances of a 55th pick being any better than a roleplayer are miniscule anyway. A lot of them don&rsquo;t even end up touching an NBA court in their entire careers. So long as Bronny can add SOMETHING to the team, he&rsquo;s already arguably good value for a 55th pick. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, I implore you to state your opinions, and show me statistical evidence to back up your points. Based on the numbers I&rsquo;ve seen (and I&rsquo;m not claiming to be a basketball analyst, I just enjoy this as a hobby), 55th picks, of all things, basically never make any kind of difference, so it&rsquo;s debatably worth it to draft him just on the miniscule chance that he does get better, because if he does he will be much more valuable than the 55th pick they spent on him, even if he&rsquo;s just a benchwarmer.</p>

      <label for="ldez2nf" class="commentText"><p>I think he got drafted because of LeBron without a doubt. And he&rsquo;s never going to be great, but I do see some talent there. With the right coaching and team I think he could be an 8-10 ppg and ~4 apg guy off the bench given some time.</p>

<p>E: He clearly loves basketball and wants to play, he&rsquo;s a smart kid and wants to be his best. He might be out of the league in 2 or 3 years but I think he&rsquo;ll give his best and give more than the completely useless player some are acting like he&rsquo;ll be</p>
