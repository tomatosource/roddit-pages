</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Cannot understand why people are calling Bronny&rsquo;s form a slump. To be a slump you have to have been coming off some sort of higher average and to date he has not reached any such average. His form is not a slump. His form is what you get when you take a 6&rsquo;1 player, ranked 7th best on the 88th ranked college team in the country who averaged a paltry 4.8 ppg and you throw him in a league full of teams that would be equivalent to final 4 teams in march madness. His opponents are a significant mark up from what he faced at USC and as such you would expect nothing better than a 4ppg average and a drop off in percentages. Today for example he was the worst player, bench included, on his team, despite having the equal second most minutes. He was barely cut out for college ball, is definitely not cut out for G league and has zero business being on an NBA court as a player.</p>

<p>And LeBron should be blamed for this because he&rsquo;s been hyping his kids for years and said numerous times that his ultimate goal is to play with one of his sons. Of course that creates and immense amount of pressure on his kids and they feel they can&rsquo;t be anything else other than basketball players to not disappoint their father. And he&rsquo;s doing it just to feed his own ego.</p>

<p>I am not a LeBron hater and actually admire his career and the player he still is&hellip; but he definitely deserves a lot of criticism for this.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I guess some doctor kids do and others don&rsquo;t. He can all agree that the pressure usually exists but not all doctors kids want to pursue the same career as their parents. For example, my GF&rsquo;s parents are both doctors and she never felt interested in that career.</p>

<p>I can share a personal story to back this up: My father (who isn&rsquo;t a doctor) always said that his dream was to see one of his sons becoming a doctor. So when I decided to follow a different career path, he got disappointed at me so my younger brother felt that he had become the family&rsquo;s doctor. Since that in our country you have to be on the top 1% of the students to be admitted and he couldn&rsquo;t enter med school in the first try, he went to Pharmacy University for a year to prepare himself to apply for med school. Now here&rsquo;s the thing&hellip; my brother is hemophobic (has blood phobia) and he was always extremely good at math and physics, so he changed his mind, drop out from pharmacy school, went to study Electrical Engineering and today he&rsquo;s very happy with his career.</p>

<p>My point is that parents should never pressure their kids to follow a career path against their will. What LeBron is doing is definitely bad parenting.</p>

<p>I know two people who had similar paths. It was basically drilled into their heads since childhood that they were going to be doctors. They didn’t know any other way. If you asked them what they wanted to be at any point, they would unhesitatingly say they want to be doctors.</p>

<p>One of them realized she didn’t actually want to be a doctor when she was already doing her internship. The other was halfway through med school. But because they were already in too deep, they had no choice but to pursue careers that were at least medical-adjacent, and they find their happiness outside of their work.</p>

<p>And tbh, I would not want to put my life in the hands of someone who doesn’t seem like they want to be there. There are way too many doctors who don’t actually want to be doctors, and there’s honestly nothing worse than being a patient who is in pain and feeling vulnerable and afraid and talking to someone who doesn’t seem like they give two shits.</p>

It&rsquo;s not just you, I just don&rsquo;t understand how everyone these days has to preface that before they say something about someone or something, that doesn&rsquo;t praise or go along with the popular narrative.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t &ldquo;hate&rdquo; Lebron James at all. I don&rsquo;t know him personally enough in any way to hate him. I&rsquo;ve never been a fan of this play style, or how he carries himself on and sometimes off the court. I also don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s the best player to ever to grace a NBA court either. That doesn&rsquo;t mean I &ldquo;hate&rdquo; him.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that people can&rsquo;t just say what they mean these days without that ridiculous phrase being thrown back at them when it regards certain people. Who is Lebron James in the grand scheme of things to not have any criticism thrown his way? Especially when it&rsquo;s deserved?</p>

      <label for="ldflj1c" class="commentText"><p>Because this sub has a lot of LeBron James cult members who simply call you a hater, even if you make any type of constructive criticism (because, to some people, LeBron is above that). And it&rsquo;s even worse in the media, where a lot of people are basically afraid of criticising LeBron or anything related to him (like Bronny or Rich Paul).</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right and it&rsquo;s sad that we got to this point.</p>

<p>Look, eat the rich and all that, but this is a weird over-generalization in this context considering that there are many sons of former players in the league right now, several of whom (Curry, Sabonis, etc…) are great players known for their work ethic.</p>

      <label for="ldfemr1" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s also always been pretty good at playing the media both ways&hellip; this feels, to me, like overplaying his hand. It&rsquo;s one thing when you&rsquo;re the one on the line and you&rsquo;ve been doing this shit since you were in high school. If anything, you could say James admirably handled himself when his career, until now, is taken as a whole.</p>

<p>Considering the scrutiny, the fact Kobe played for the majority of LBJ&rsquo;s career and the rise of a player like Steph, social media, NBA media, YouTubers and an endless sea of podcasts&hellip; many of them actually great&hellip; I think for all that was going on, the fact he engaged at all and kept narratives going while playing at a high level, winning rings, dealing with (and creating) drama, LeBron definitely has the constitution for this shit.</p>

<p>But his son? Throwing your goddamned kid into this circus and just expecting him to walk the high wire with no net other than the lifestyle and money that put him on that wire? It&rsquo;s hard to see this as not being stultifying and suffocating for the kid. It HAS to be.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not Bronny they should be hard on&hellip; it&rsquo;s his dad. He and the Lakers organization fucked up here. I guarantee that kid will need DeRozan&rsquo;s book on his own mental health issues by 2025. I am sure there are current and former players in the league who see this slow motion train wreck happening and thinking the worst possible outcomes but feel helpless to stop it.</p>

I&rsquo;m sure LeBron has some idea of the challenges that Bronny will face on the court at the NBA level. However, like most Dads, probably not the most objective analysis of his son&rsquo;s abilities. Stil, LeBron is very smart. Let&rsquo;s wait and see how this plays out.</p>

<p>Small, side guarantee, Bronny will play better in the minutes he shares the court with LeBron. LeBron has enough control of the offense to set Bronny up. Heck, we might see LeBron become an elite screener just to get his son open.</p>

<p>No matter how big egos are, real lived experience is hard to erase. I don’t understand how the James family, Bronny and Rich Paul included, were not more worried about Bronny based on BJ Boston and Ziarie Williams struggling..</p>

<p>There is no way they believe he was better than his former teammates as seniors.</p>

They already have multiple generational money, with the strings lebron could pull he could get Bronny a ton of opportunities outside of the NBA. I mean maybe he can carve himself a role in the league, but the scrutiny coming by being LBJ’s son will probably never go away.</p>

He’ll feel like hes ‘earned’ his own wealth and if he uses this great opportunity he might develop into enough of a talent to earn a contract, and even if he went to another professional league or made contacts n got into coaching, podcasting, anything with this base he’d turn this unearned platform into something of his own. Generational wealth is nice but if some ppl down the bloodline can earn a few million here and there itll def help that wealth last</p>

      <label for="ldf9on3" class="commentText"><p>Maybe when you are a basketball god like LeBron it&rsquo;s hard to understand that other people can&rsquo;t necessarily flip the switch and dominate like you can. Add in some typical &ldquo;my kid is the greatest&rdquo; parental delusion and you can sort of see how things got to this point.</p>

<p>The kid has some level of talent to get a scholarship and get some minutes at USC, which is almost the worst part of it. If he were just hopeless D3 level then there&rsquo;s no way they could&rsquo;ve pushed it this far.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually kind of a shame from that standpoint because if he&rsquo;d just been some random kid from Iowa with the same skill set then he probably goes D1 to a mid-major and everyone in the community is really proud of him, but now it&rsquo;s just &ldquo;wow he sucks&rdquo; because he&rsquo;s been thrust into this position.</p>

      <label for="ldeqknf" class="commentText"><p>People who don’t know college ball need to stop with this, staying in college was not gonna make him an nba caliber player. He is undersized and bad couldn’t even do anything on a shit college team. His only chance at the nba was this and he got a 8 million contract from it. Bronny would be a complete idiot to stay in college and not take the opportunity and the money now.</p>

      <label for="lderxwu" class="commentText"><p>Bronny likely has the lowest ceiling of any player in the draft considering he grew up with much better trainers, chefs and coaches his entire life. I agree, I think he maybe jumps from a 4ppg guy at USC to a 12ppg player at a different college by his senior year, his draft stock would be even worse by then</p>

For not running the team with the same competitiveness as their father. Jeanie bus has made so many terrible moves since she&rsquo;s been the owner. She needs to sell the team. I&rsquo;m completely convinced at this point that this team is unsalvageable until she is gone. Until the buss ownership is gone. They do not deserve the franchise that their father built.</p>

He was 55th&hellip; The chances of a 55th pick being any better than a roleplayer are miniscule anyway. A lot of them don&rsquo;t even end up touching an NBA court in their entire careers. So long as Bronny can add SOMETHING to the team, he&rsquo;s already arguably good value for a 55th pick. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, I implore you to state your opinions, and show me statistical evidence to back up your points. Based on the numbers I&rsquo;ve seen (and I&rsquo;m not claiming to be a basketball analyst, I just enjoy this as a hobby), 55th picks, of all things, basically never make any kind of difference, so it&rsquo;s debatably worth it to draft him just on the miniscule chance that he does get better, because if he does he will be much more valuable than the 55th pick they spent on him, even if he&rsquo;s just a benchwarmer.</p>

<p>As you say, most picks at that point you get nothing anyway. Despite the negative sentiment in the online echo chambers, people are absolutely going to be tuning in if Bronny is playing NBA games, there&rsquo;s going to be Bronny jerseys getting sold, the first game he and Bron play together is going to be one of the most historic moments in NBA history that will be remembered for decades whether people like it or not.</p>

<p>People really seem to sleep on how significant this is going to be. A father and son playing together in the NBA is crazy. That shit will make international news. Sponsors and advertising going to want in on that shit too.</p>

<p>At 55th, I can roll the dice on some nobody who probably does nothing for me, or I can create that and benefit from it? Yeah I&rsquo;ll do that. Sport is a business.</p>

But let&rsquo;s not pretend that functioning in the NBA is just a math formula where you take a few minutes of freshman year stats and it mathematically determines what type of player you will be after a couple of years of NBA training. And having any business being on a summer league court is about what type of player you will be after that couple of years of training.</p>

<p>But your analysis is also kind of fine (i.e., marginal player in a tougher league). Bronny&rsquo;s performance now isn&rsquo;t a slump and it is kind of what one would expect. For now.</p>

<p>Bronny fans seriously are so out of the loop I guess they must live in a cave or something. I don&rsquo;t even use twitter and I know of these quotes just casually browsing r/nba.</p>

      <label for="ldfmww7" class="commentText"><p>Bronny&rsquo;s career 3PT shooting average is 27% which is a lot higher than his current 0%, so that&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p>Bronny James is a development player, still a teenager. The Lakers selected him to cultivate his skills. As JJ Redick said, Bronny is the primary project of their new developmental program. The Lakers aim to demonstrate the success of their program through Bronny&rsquo;s growth. So he may struggle with shooting now, but the plan is for him to look completely different in 2-3 years.</p>

<p>Redick said he has specific goals for Bronny, starting with defensive ball pressure. He doesn&rsquo;t mind if Bronny gets 10 fouls, gets blown by, or misses all his shots. The focus is on whether Bronny is relentlessly on the ball or three feet away. This is step one in his development process. Redick said they will progressively work on his shooting and ball handling as they move forward.</p>

<p>So there is a misconception about Bronny&rsquo;s poor shooting; it is neither alarming nor concerning for the Lakers.</p>

<p>E: He clearly loves basketball and wants to play, he&rsquo;s a smart kid and wants to be his best. He might be out of the league in 2 or 3 years but I think he&rsquo;ll give his best and give more than the completely useless player some are acting like he&rsquo;ll be</p>
