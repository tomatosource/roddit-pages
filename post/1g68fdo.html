Like you said. Devin can be the finisher/shot maker and spent a lot more time off ball and being in that Chris Middleton &ldquo; throw him the ball with 5 seconds left if needed and let him cook&rdquo; tough shot maker, Victor is your sun That everything orbits around, and Castle can be that two-way //ear, rebounder, driver, and defensive pest.</p>

      <label for="lsh2fx0" class="commentText"><p>Honestly, I thought he was even better than the numbers. The Spurs had absolutely zero offensive cohesion all game and outside of that 8-minute off and on stretch across a couple quarters where Collins and Malachi inexplicably had a killer two-man game, putting the ball in the 19-year-old rookie&rsquo;s hand was the Spurs best bet as far as having a bit of a calming presence</p>

<p>Which is pretty fantastic for a rookie</p>

<p>He missed some open threes which is going to be the litmus test that determines whether or not he becomes a really good player, and a great player, but the kid is A special blend of physicality, intelligence, and two-way basketball feel.</p>

<p>If he somehow manages to get around 25 minutes per game this year, I think he will finish on a first team All rookie and make a dark horse run for rookie of the Year. (For the record, I&rsquo;d be surprised if he gets that many minutes knowing pop and this Spurs roster, which is surprisingly deep despite not being particularly talented on the top end)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m curious how Pop will handle it. The Spurs are deep, but most of that depth seem like their ceiling is the 5th-9th guy on a roster. Castle looks like he could be a legit #2 next to Wemby, but he&rsquo;ll need time on the court to get there. He&rsquo;s also got a pretty mature game, and won&rsquo;t cost you a lot of the defensive end, unlike a lot of rookies.</p>

      <label for="lsh89wp" class="commentText"><p>Spurs are deep in the sense that they have a number of 8-12 type players. Many of them are young and some are capable of making a significant leap, but they don&rsquo;t have the type of tiers most teams have with the stars, the helpers, the sorta okay guys and the end of the bench scrubs. They are overstocked on sorta okay guys.</p>

<p>This is a transitional year. Hope all those sorta okay guys can take big steps but that&rsquo;s unlikely. Most of them will be elsewhere and we&rsquo;ll see what the next season brings. They have enough theoretical firepower to make some noise, but so much up in the air at this point.</p>

<p>Its an exciting time to be a Spurs fan, though. Being an older fan and having 5 titles in the bank helps make it more enjoyable for sure, though&hellip;</p>

      <label for="lsh9k7a" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I&rsquo;m curious too. I could see the Spurs having the mindset of just prioritizing the guy they know is going to be a huge part of their future immediately, but I could also see the logic again if you already know what you have with Castle, but you have several players (Julian, Wesley, malachai) Who the Spurs honestly need to figure out what they&rsquo;re doing with sooner than later, and if they&rsquo;re worth further investment in, bringing Castle along slowly and giving some of those guys a last chance at trying to prove that they&rsquo;re worth keeping on the roster past this year</p>

<p>Even someone like Jones who the Spurs love, but no, he&rsquo;s limited, isn&rsquo;t secured long-term and I could see San Antonio being very invested in making sure he still gets his 20 plus minutes to continue showing what he could bring as a long-term backup in the Victor era</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to predict right now.</p>

<p>But Castle I really do believe is good enough that If he starts hitting threes all this could be a mute point and the Spurs may have their hand forced into just giving him as many minutes as possible</p>

Personally I&rsquo;ve given up on Branham and am fine with them not picking up last year team option but would like to keep Champagnie and probably have seen enough good from Wesley to give him one more year.</p>

He&rsquo;s the real deal and his floor is very high - his ceiling is crazy but he will be a solid NBA player regardless and the best available at his draft position.</p>

<p>You see it, the winning plays by guys who had success at lower levels. Its a significant factor in his progression. Being part of a winning program gives him an advantage.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Lol agreed. It was mostly a good game from Castle though but nothing special that needs to be posted here. He is looking extremely promising though but I agree. People expecting him to be a good 3 point shooter in his rookie year will more than likely be disappointed. Even though Castle has a really high floor, he is still a developing player when it comes to what his true ceiling can be. Still needs time to get there, but he&rsquo;s off to a really good start so far.</p>
