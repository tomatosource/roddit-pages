      <label for="l6aidsm" class="commentText"><p>Unfortunately, you never get such analysis on national TV. I have no idea why; that’s my biggest issue with American sports, mostly with basketball because in football they actually try to talk about certain plays. Coming from Europe and predominantly watching soccer, I always enjoyed watching reviews and discussions about certain strategies, especially before YouTube became a thing. For some reason, here people seem to enjoy listening to Steven A. Smith screaming gibberish and overreacting to every game, or Perkins spanking a chair imitating Luka and the Clippers, or saying MVP votes are too white, or saying DPOY is fraudulent. There&rsquo;s also Draymond Green, who, by the way, got a huge ban from the league for choking Gobert (and that’s one of the reasons why his team is in Cancun for the last 6 weeks instead of playing) being invited to TNT and talking negatively about the Timberwolves, even lying that they made a run in Game 7 when Gobert was off the floor. Then there&rsquo;s Shannon Sharpe, who thinks McGee is still playing for Dallas, and other &lsquo;experts&rsquo; who suggest Minnesota has to bench Rudy, even though in this video at the end we see that he had a positive plus/minus in every playoff game but one. It feels like they just want to create narratives instead of talking about the game itself.</p>

<p>Rudy has his limitations, but the amount of hate he gets is generational. It feels like TNT invited Draymond for the last two series just to criticize Gobert. It&rsquo;s a freaking conference finals; this team hasn&rsquo;t been there for 20 years, and Gobert is the third or probably even the second biggest reason why the Wolves are there. The Wolves have severely underperformed in the WCF so far, but they are one bad whistle away from being 2-2 and having home court advantage.</p>

      <label for="l6azcoh" class="commentText"><p>I find it hypocritical how self proclaimed Europe fans of basketball openly refuse to understand how US media has always worked and now thinks the lack of recognition their players of the last 5years get compares to the &ldquo;generational hate&rdquo; players got the previous decades.</p>

<p>This is the playoffs, of course the reactionary takes are exaggerated to the maximum when it comes to eliminations. Of course everyone has to stab  and impale the players that are easy to poke. And of course the new MVPs, DPOYs and All NBA players are being scrutinized and blamed just like Steph, KD, Bron, Giannis,Embiid,were.</p>

<p>It all comes  down to pre max extension vs post max extension of their contract. Once they are franchise players, doesn&rsquo;t matter if they are Bron,Kawhi, PG, KD  or Gobert, Jokic, Doncic, Embiid, Giannis the closer they are to losing in the finals, the more the disrespect gets amplified, the more commentators will exaggerate their takes.</p>

<p>This is nothing new and is only chocking to euro fans because euro players are now getting the big awards with the scrutiny that comes with it.</p>

<p>Luka hit a shot on him. Every defender will have shots hit on them. He&rsquo;s switched onto guards and defended in space all post season. When he switched onto Kyrie and did a great job on him, it&rsquo;s crickets. He was clamping Beal and Booker in space throughout the first round.</p>

This will age like milk because Kyrie will not play as bad as he did in game 4 regardless of the adjustments the Wolves made. And the Mavs lost Lively. The fact that we need to go out of our way to defend a 4x DPOY says enough in itself</p>

      <label for="l6ambgl" class="commentText"><p>One possession against one of the best isolation players in basketball does not mean Rudy got &ldquo;played off the floor&rdquo;. They literally kept him on the floor and trusted him to switch in the other games because he&rsquo;s done that all postseason. 45 seconds before that Game 2 shot, Rudy was switched onto Luka and he forced him to pass out. Rudy was not &ldquo;played off the floor&rdquo; when he was switching onto and clamping Kyrie in Game 4.</p>

<p>We have to go out of our way to defend Rudy because the hate is insane and an overreaction to single possessions. Jamal Murray hit 2 game winners on AD. Using 2 shots to say AD gets played off the floor is ridiculous.</p>

      <label for="l6amsyh" class="commentText"><p>Except they didn&rsquo;t want him to switch against Luka. Luka made Gobert dance and got a good look on his game winner. Jamal Murray was on the move and got a significantly harder shot to go against AD. Everyone knows this. AD has never had Terrance Mann or Pat Bev put on him in the post. They actually send 2 guys every time he touches the ball</p>

      <label for="l6am06d" class="commentText"><p>Are we seriously trying to decide whether a defender is good or not based on one play? Had Luka missed the shot that he makes only 30% of the time at best, no one would have said anything about Gobert. Rudy takes pride in defending isolations; I saw a stat that he allowed fewer than 0.9 points per isolation in the regular season. Is this metric more important in determining the DPOY, or one shot made by a generational shot-maker?</p>

      <label for="l6amyi9" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not based on one play. It&rsquo;s based off multiple years of data. Against the Rockets, against the Clippers, etc. I legitimately thought it wasn&rsquo;t a Gobert issue because an non-engaged Donovan Mitchell and Jordan Clarkson are legitimate defensive cones, however, I now know that Gobert is indeed overrated. I&rsquo;ve seen the same shit I&rsquo;m saying now in your sub. We&rsquo;ll be revisiting this after game 5 or 6 if they somehow push it that far</p>

      <label for="l6angco" class="commentText"><p>Yes, but their offense is bad and part of the main reason is because Gobert clogs up the lane. They blew out the Nuggets without Gobert in game 2. Ant looks better on offense with Naz Reid or KAT at the 5. Gobert improving their defense at the cost of their offense is part of the reason why the Mavs have been winning this series with the other main reason is KAT has been playing like shit</p>

<p>I made a compilation of Rudy switching and defending in space earlier this year (including clips of Rudy clamping Luka on the perimeter in prior playoffs): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0uAzXcIHho" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0uAzXcIHho</a></p>

<p>But with the way the narratives have gone with crickets when he&rsquo;s defending well, looks like I&rsquo;ll need to make a 2024 <em>playoff</em> compilation of Rudy out in space lol. He&rsquo;s been switching onto guards and moving his feet well all postseason</p>
