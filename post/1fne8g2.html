      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fne8g2/were_the_bad_boy_pistons_the_less_talented_nba/"><p>Were the bad boy Pistons the less talented NBA Championship team in modern history outside of the 04 Pistons?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>We all know the 04 Pistons are the only championship team without a top 75 player and is generally seen as the least star stacked team to win. Whose the second team with least amount of star power (lets say in modern era)? I feel like the bad boy Pistons could be an answer - Isaiah Thomas is probably ranked outside top 20, at best top 15? Then their 2nd star is Joe Dumars, a perennial all star sure but nowhere near a superstar. Bucks, Rockets, Nuggets would come up but they all have a top 15ish player of all time. What do you guys think?</p>

<p>Edit: the 79 Sonics also had no top 75 players (must have been Mandela effect or something, always thought that was distinct to the 04 Pistons.</p>

      <label for="lohnj8c" class="commentText"><p>2019 Raptors. Kawhi is an interesting case, not a ton of hardware compared to his peers, definitely a top ten player at the time but all time players he’s probably outside top twenty/thirty. You have a pretty loaded cast (Lowry, Fred van fleet with a flamethrower, gasol, siakam, serge, Danny green, i can’t remember if Powell got substantial minutes and OG was injured.) there’s some all star selections, but no crazy accolades or achievements either.</p>

      <label for="lohop9w" class="commentText"><p>Do you realize how deep a rotation the Bad Boys had?</p>

<p>Thomas, Dumars, Rodman, Mahorn, Laimbeer, Vinnie Johnson, Mark Aguirre, Salley.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s just off the top of my head and I know I&rsquo;m forgetting some more people.</p>

      <label for="lohpchl" class="commentText"><p>Not star stacked /= thin rotation. 04 Pistons had a deep rotation too Wallace/Wallace/Prince/Hamilton/Billups bench: Okur, Hunter, Williamson, Ham, Campbell. They are still recognized as the least star stacked team to win.</p>

<p>If the question is about overall talent (and not just superstars), then the Bad Boy Pistons shouldn&rsquo;t even be in this conversation. In fact, they had too much talent so they had to trade Dantley away to have a more balanced team</p>

      <label for="lohpseq" class="commentText"><p>You&rsquo;re forgetting DPOY Dennis Rodman, and the Bad Boys Pistons averaged 61 wins a year. I think there&rsquo;s a good argument the Bad Boys Pistons were maybe the most talented team in NBA history from 1-10, even if their 1-5 wasn&rsquo;t as impressive on paper. They just were all good enough to beat you on offense or defense. (I should qualify that I mean they just had true starter-level talent all the way through their rotation, not that they&rsquo;d beat teams like the Bulls or Warriors)</p>

<p>The least talented team to ever win was probably between the &lsquo;79 Supersonics who were built around HOFers Dennis Johnson and Jack Sikma, the &lsquo;77 Blazers who just had Bill Walton, and the &lsquo;75 Warriors with Rick Barry. Only the Sonics got to even 50 wins.</p>

      <label for="lohp8ja" class="commentText"><p>Bad boy pistons shouldn&rsquo;t be underestimated imo. I watched some old playoff games and was reminded how good they were outside of Thomas / Dumars&hellip;. Vinnie Johnson and Adrian Dantley could get buckets &hellip; Rodman / Laimber on the defensive end. Also, as much as it pains me to say it (because he was an asshole) Laimbeer deserves some credit as one of the first reliable stretch bigs.</p>
