      <p>Watching games you can kinda tell which teams just don’t have chemistry. And watching other you can tell, like the last Celtics team I can see they really do like being around each other. I wonder if there has been a team where many of the players just generally disliked being there and with each other?</p>

      <label for="ld1r4gm" class="commentText"><p>This is a solid example but even then they fell short of their potential because of it.</p>

<p>I believe it was the 2000 season where Shaq waited until the season started to get surgery which rubbed some teammates (not just Kobe) the wrong way. Kobe already had issues with Shaq&rsquo;s effort and that was probably the final straw.</p>

<p>They still won 3 titles (2 of which were post Shaq surgery). However, then they lost to the Spurs and Shaq got traded.</p>

<p>If Shaq and Kobe got along like Klay and Steph for instance they&rsquo;d have have a shot at like 5-6 rings together. They were just such a perfect fit for that era of basketball that even despite their chemistry issues they were able to dominate.</p>

<p>In todays NBA it is much harder IMO. The skill gap between teams and players is a lot closer than 20+ years ago. The disadvantage of bad chemistry is damn near impossible to overcome in todays NBA.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That was the 2003 season, the year they were going for a 4 peat and instead started the year in a huge hole without Shaq and struggled just to even qualify for the playoffs, eventually finishing as the 5th seed. With Shaq missing the first two months of that season, the Lakers were only 11-19 and <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/index.cgi?month=12&amp;day=25&amp;year=2002" target="_blank">in 11th place on Christmas Day</a> after a loss to the Kings. They completely exhausted themselves to make the playoffs after that, digging themselves out of that hole, and then went on to lose to the Spurs in the 2nd round, ending their three year reign as NBA champs.</p>

<p>Shaq and Kobe had already been feuding for a couple years by that point though, with it initially spilling over into the public in the 2000-2001 season (the year they went 15-1 in the playoffs), with both players giving interviews to the press about what they thought was wrong with the other one.</p>

<p>This, of course, ultimately led to the Lakers having to choose between the two, as in the summer of 2004 <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2004/06/19/shaq-demands-trade/" target="_blank">Shaq demanded a trade</a> while Kobe was eyeing free agency as a way to leave the Lakers that summer, before ultimately <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=1840336" target="_blank">re-signing with them.</a></p>

      <label for="ld29kby" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s really not what the issue was between the two players. Kobe&rsquo;s problem with Shaq was that Shaq refused to work hard, yet Shaq still felt like no matter how hard Kobe worked or how good he played, it should still be Shaq&rsquo;s team, and that Kobe should just be happy to be his sidekick. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=1648431" target="_blank">Kobe was pretty clear about this in an interview he gave in 2003:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s more to life than whose team this is. But this is his team, so it&rsquo;s time for him to act like it. That means no more coming into camp fat and out of shape, when your team is relying on your leadership on and off the court. It also means no more blaming others for our team&rsquo;s failure, or blaming staff members for not overdramatizing your injuries so that you avoid blame for your lack of conditioning. Also, &ldquo;my team&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean only when we win; it means carrying the burden of defeat just as gracefully as you carry a championship trophy.</p>

<p>I have been successfully sacrificing my game for years for Shaq. That&rsquo;s what Phil [Jackson] wanted me to do, so I did it. Last year Phil told me Shaq was not in physical condition to carry the trust of our offense, so he asked me to do it. But then he saw Shaq was getting upset that the team wasn&rsquo;t running through him, so Phil asked me to pull back and I did.</p>

<p>As soon as they show league-potential talent, these kids are just all basketball and media training from early on.</p>

<p>I really hope a lot of coaches and trainers are gonna start taking pages from the books of people like Holger Geschwindner who trained Dirk from his teenage years on and required that Dirk do stuff like play an instrument and read books in addition to his basketball training to make him a more well-rounded person</p>

<p>An old comment quoting Shaq&rsquo;s book.</p>

<p><em>Kobe stands up and goes face-to-face with me and says, &ldquo;You always said you&rsquo;re my big brother, you&rsquo;d do anything for me, and then this Colorado thing happens and you never even called me.&rdquo; I did call him. &hellip; So here we are now, and we find out he really was hurt that we didn&rsquo;t stand behind him. That was something new. I didn&rsquo;t think he gave a rat&rsquo;s ass about us either way. &ldquo;Well, I thought you&rsquo;d publicly support me, at least,&rdquo; Kobe said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re supposed to be my friend.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>Brian Shaw chimed in with &ldquo;Kobe, why would you think that? Shaq had all these parties and you never showed up for any of them. We invited you to dinner on the road and you didn&rsquo;t come. Shaq invited you to his wedding and you weren&rsquo;t there. Then you got married and didn&rsquo;t invite any of us. And now you are in the middle of this problem, this sensitive situation, and now you want all of us to step up for you. We don&rsquo;t even know you.&rdquo; &hellip; Everyone was starting to calm down when I told Kobe, &ldquo;If you ever say anything like what you said to Jim Gray ever again, I will kill you.&rdquo; Kobe shrugged and said, &ldquo;Whatever.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Talk about narcissism, lacking self awareness, and over the top arrogance even before he was in the NBA. As much as people love Kobe, (rightfully) appreciate his accomplishments, and revise the narrative, his own issues have been confirmed time over from multiple sources 1st hand across the board.  Before anyone brings up yeah pro athletes gotta be confident, there&rsquo;s confidence and rude arrogance.   Blows my mind sometimes how much the narrative changed post retirement and further through post death.</p>

      <label for="ld3yb5d" class="commentText"><p>Well, Kobe joined the NBA when he was 17, and he lived abroad for several years. Frankly, he was socially awkward and an introvert. Of course, he was also arrogant and lacking in self-awareness as you said. Lakers fans all knew the shift that happened some time around 2008 where Kobe actually turned into a likable guy. He had a lot of growing up to do, due to how stunted his growth was.</p>

<p>With that said, I&rsquo;m not really sure I understand how your quotes are supposed to show that the issue was with Kobe. The dude was introverted. So he wanted a private wedding, to get food alone on a road trip (where you don&rsquo;t get much personal time), and not to party &ndash; so what? Sounds like a dime a dozen introvert. Not going to Shaq&rsquo;s wedding is a bad look but overall, I just see an introvert who didn&rsquo;t understand human relationships very well expecting his teammates/ friends/ supposed big brother to have his back, and they didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>And to be clear, maybe they shouldn&rsquo;t have. Sexual assault is no joke. But then, the crime is sexual assault, not the quotes you sent above where Kobe decided to&hellip; not go to Shaq&rsquo;s parties?</p>

I still would go to a wedding even if I disliked it and I still go spend time with friends. Kobe was a huge narcissist who loved himsekf and thought he was god gift . He falsely created images rather then act like himself . And he seemed most of his career like a shitty person to be around .</p>

      <label for="ld1ocec" class="commentText"><p>The championship Knicks dealt with their fair share of turmoil, <a href="https://from-way-downtown.com/2021/05/08/the-dark-side-of-the-knicks/" target="_blank">as detailed here.</a></p>

<p>Holzman was pretty assholish, which a lot of players took the wrong way. He had a tendency to blame the players for failure and prop himself up in periods of success.</p>

<p>Frazier was not very receptive to coaching. Barnett was a loner. Reed and DeBusschere were awkwardly forced to be mediators through the storm. Cazzie Russell was sociable but other teammates found it shallow, and saw him as a fraud.</p>

<p>Cultural differences between black and white players were paramount and caused a lot of friction. They weren’t able to bond off-court due to differences in interests and it created a toxic echo chamber of discontent towards one another.</p>

<p>Some of the white players saw their African-American teammates as loud and annoying, while a lot of the African-American players felt the need to check the white players for signs of racism.</p>

<p>It’s always interesting to see the perspective from an era so different to today socially. And it’s beautiful that they still managed to build the chemistry necessary to win two championships.</p>

<p>No doubt that they become a dynasty if Reed wasn’t injured.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t even agree with the sentiment. YES, I think KD joining the 73-win and Rodman joining the Bulls are the only actual &ldquo;superteams&rdquo; that have been formed.&rdquo; But, KD won TWO FMVPs. Didn&rsquo;t just go along for the ride. Wasn&rsquo;t Al Horford winning a title this past season.</p>

<p>But, what I think doesn&rsquo;t change the overall perception of KD&rsquo;s titles not mattering.</p>

      <label for="ld3ywxa" class="commentText"><p>TBH, I wonder how much the Lakers would&rsquo;ve won if Kobe and Shaq stuck together. Unless you retcon things so that, say, Kobe doesn&rsquo;t chuck in 2004 and they force feed Shaq (who was being single covered by Big Ben pretty effectively but was still scoring efficiently while the rest of the team was at comically bad efficiency levels) and they win 2004&hellip;</p>

<p>Like Shaq was elite in 2005, was already dropping off by 2006. From 2007 onwards he wasn&rsquo;t even really an all-star level player except for that rebirth season in 2009 with the Phoenix training staff (and it&rsquo;s not clear he was really a plus player &ndash; they dropped him the following season and made the WCF).</p>

<p>I honestly think if Kobe/Shaq didn&rsquo;t break up they would have ended up with 4 rings (probably in like 2006). Shaq would never take a salary commensurate with his shrinking effectiveness and so he would be an albatross around team building.</p>

      <label for="ld1z3n9" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think dislike is the right word. It was never like Shaq-Kobe although the dynamic is similar. The consensus among those who have covered the team at the time or went back to research is Bird was one of those players with a psychotic killer mentality and drive to win that McHale didn’t share</p>

<p>Kevin was a nice, humorous guy who told jokes often. He had other interests in life other than basketball unlike Bird.</p>

<p>Not that he wasn’t a great player or didn’t work hard, but Larry believed McHale could’ve been truly on his level if he had the mentality Bird did.</p>

<p>“The difference between Larry Bird and Kevin McHale was, if Bird had a guy down, Bird would look at him, step on his larynx, and crush him. McHale would say, “yeah, you’ve had enough,” and help him up.”</p>

<p>But overall, there is a mutual respect and admiration for each other. They did a sit down maybe a few years ago that was pretty good</p>

      <label for="ld2eym2" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think teams get along as well as fans think they do. The Jordan Pippin Bulls had issues. Shaq and Kobe hated each other for a bit. KD and Green had to have the FO intervene. Kyrie has said he was resentful playing with Lebron. Even the Showtime Lakers had problems. After Norm Nixon was traded, Magic didn&rsquo;t even speak to Byron Scott for a while. Most of those guys mended fences. There are a lot of different agendas, factions, and personalities in every locker room at every level. You have to play together, but there&rsquo;s always some animosity. As time goes by, mutual respect grows, and after your playing days are over, you can even be bffs.</p>

Apparently there was also some frustration with the amount of games Kawhi sat out during the season even if it worked out in the end</p>

<p>The 2008 Celtics were a mess with Rondo pissing guys off and then Ray Allen not getting along with KG and Pierce. Allen then famously left for Miami to win with LBJ/Wade.</p>

<p>The 2014 Spurs are probably another good example with Pop, Parker and the Spurs not exactly liking Kawhi&rsquo;s introverted ways.</p>

<p>In 2016 Kyrie vs. LBJ and the rest of the team. While the fellas were celebrating the title, Kyrie was sulking in the shower stall and calling Kobe. Well-documented story.</p>

<p>And now there are rumors Jalen Brown may not exactly be loved in the Celtics locker room?</p>

      <label for="ld1vpvg" class="commentText"><p>Tatum has said he will do whatever the teams needs him to do to win. This implies he will fill a role he doesn’t necessarily love. What was his role in the finals? Facilitating. Who did that benefit the most? Brown. So Tatum obviously fucking hates his guts you just can’t tell because he’s always smiling and having a good time around him.</p>
