      <p>Watching games you can kinda tell which teams just don’t have chemistry. And watching other you can tell, like the last Celtics team I can see they really do like being around each other. I wonder if there has been a team where many of the players just generally disliked being there and with each other?</p>

      <label for="ld1r4gm" class="commentText"><p>This is a solid example but even then they fell short of their potential because of it.</p>

<p>I believe it was the 2000 season where Shaq waited until the season started to get surgery which rubbed some teammates (not just Kobe) the wrong way. Kobe already had issues with Shaq&rsquo;s effort and that was probably the final straw.</p>

<p>They still won 3 titles (2 of which were post Shaq surgery). However, then they lost to the Spurs and Shaq got traded.</p>

<p>If Shaq and Kobe got along like Klay and Steph for instance they&rsquo;d have have a shot at like 5-6 rings together. They were just such a perfect fit for that era of basketball that even despite their chemistry issues they were able to dominate.</p>

<p>In todays NBA it is much harder IMO. The skill gap between teams and players is a lot closer than 20+ years ago. The disadvantage of bad chemistry is damn near impossible to overcome in todays NBA.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That was the 2003 season, the year they were going for a 4 peat and instead started the year in a huge hole without Shaq and struggled just to even qualify for the playoffs, eventually finishing as the 5th seed. With Shaq missing the first two months of that season, the Lakers were only 11-19 and <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/index.cgi?month=12&amp;day=25&amp;year=2002" target="_blank">in 11th place on Christmas Day</a> after a loss to the Kings. They completely exhausted themselves to make the playoffs after that, digging themselves out of that hole, and then went on to lose to the Spurs in the 2nd round, ending their three year reign as NBA champs.</p>

<p>Shaq and Kobe had already been feuding for a couple years by that point though, with it initially spilling over into the public in the 2000-2001 season (the year they went 15-1 in the playoffs), with both players giving interviews to the press about what they thought was wrong with the other one.</p>

<p>This, of course, ultimately led to the Lakers having to choose between the two, as in the summer of 2004 <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2004/06/19/shaq-demands-trade/" target="_blank">Shaq demanded a trade</a> while Kobe was eyeing free agency as a way to leave the Lakers that summer, before ultimately <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=1840336" target="_blank">re-signing with them.</a></p>

<p>Holzman was pretty assholish, which a lot of players took the wrong way. He had a tendency to blame the players for failure and prop himself up in periods of success.</p>

<p>Frazier was not very receptive to coaching. Barnett was a loner. Reed and DeBusschere were awkwardly forced to be mediators through the storm. Cazzie Russell was sociable but other teammates found it shallow, and saw him as a fraud.</p>

<p>Cultural differences between black and white players were paramount and caused a lot of friction. They weren’t able to bond off-court due to differences in interests and it created a toxic echo chamber of discontent towards one another.</p>

<p>Some of the white players saw their African-American teammates as loud and annoying, while a lot of the African-American players felt the need to check the white players for signs of racism.</p>

<p>It’s always interesting to see the perspective from an era so different to today socially. And it’s beautiful that they still managed to build the chemistry necessary to win two championships.</p>

<p>No doubt that they become a dynasty if Reed wasn’t injured.</p>

      <label for="ld1z3n9" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think dislike is the right word. It was never like Shaq-Kobe although the dynamic is similar. The consensus among those who have covered the team at the time or went back to research is Bird was one of those players with a psychotic killer mentality and drive to win that McHale didn’t share</p>

<p>Kevin was a nice, humorous guy who told jokes often. He had other interests in life other than basketball unlike Bird.</p>

<p>Not that he wasn’t a great player or didn’t work hard, but Larry believed McHale could’ve been truly on his level if he had the mentality Bird did.</p>

<p>“The difference between Larry Bird and Kevin McHale was, if Bird had a guy down, Bird would look at him, step on his larynx, and crush him. McHale would say, “yeah, you’ve had enough,” and help him up.”</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t even agree with the sentiment. YES, I think KD joining the 73-win and Rodman joining the Bulls are the only actual &ldquo;superteams&rdquo; that have been formed.&rdquo; But, KD won TWO FMVPs. Didn&rsquo;t just go along for the ride. Wasn&rsquo;t Al Horford winning a title this past season.</p>

<p>But, what I think doesn&rsquo;t change the overall perception of KD&rsquo;s titles not mattering.</p>

      <label for="ld1vpvg" class="commentText"><p>Tatum has said he will do whatever the teams needs him to do to win. This implies he will fill a role he doesn’t necessarily love. What was his role in the finals? Facilitating. Who did that benefit the most? Brown. So Tatum obviously fucking hates his guts you just can’t tell because he’s always smiling and having a good time around him.</p>
