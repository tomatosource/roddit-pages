      <label for="lof0ayj" class="commentText"><p>Idk if the outcome is any different but if Dennis Rodman doesn’t outright refuse to guard Hakeem so Robinson has more energy to spend on offense or literally refuse Hill and David’s attempts to play help defense/double Hakeem then at least it wouldn’t have been so one sided. Rodman was brought in to be a tough defender so Robinson didn’t have to be in as much of a two way role and he literally bailed on the team in the playoffs. Hakeem feasted, and he likely still does but maybe it goes 7 and Robinson doesn’t get into so much foul trouble.</p>

<p>In Rodman’s book he tries to make it out like David wasn’t leading or was scared and I am like DUDE your literal job is to guard the best player on the other team and you decided against Hakeem to leave your teammates on an island</p>

      <label for="lofh5as" class="commentText"><p>Oh for sure. I think same result just would be better to lose knowing you did all you could without wondering what if Rodman, the defensive specialist you traded a core player for (who came back ofc), did what he was hired to do. If you can steal one of those 5 point or less losses coz David has more energy on offense idk, but that would’ve been the hope other than having your “enforcer” ignore timeouts with his shoes off during an active game</p>

      <label for="lofv4e1" class="commentText"><p>I don’t know how you could watch their careers, then look at one playoff series where Hakeem had Clyde Drexler and DRob had a sabotaging Dennis Rodman, and agree that they’re on different levels.  Their differential is 1a/1b at the most.  If Hakeem had been double teamed all series and his second best player had refused to play defense, and Rodman had not gone full crazy, DRob would have won the series, regardless of the third best player in the series by a huge margin being Clyde on the Rockets.  People in this sub ignore context because they like clear delineations between players as to who is/was better.  There is no such delineation, they were two great players who were absolutely on the same level, and there are good arguments (not that I necessarily buy them) that DRob was better.</p>

      <label for="lof5hre" class="commentText"><p>Am I making excuses if I said the outcome would likely be the same in the end? David got outplayed anyway, the idea is Rodman was brought in to be the bruiser to relieve David on one end so he could focus even more on offense. Probably doesn’t change it but he should’ve at least tried.</p>

<p>Rodman was great but it’s no secret he wasn’t a great team player after bad boys pistons ended and without Phil/MJ. He had a unique mindset that was hard to direct in the right way. MJ and Phil knew how. Dude literally sat down with his shoes off during a time out and refused to listen. If your team mates are asking you to use your biggest strength, physicality and defense, they’re admitting a weakness and asking you to switch onto their guy and you’re literally telling them no that’s bailing on your peers.</p>

<p>There is a reason why Rodman didn’t work out in post bad boy Pistons, Spurs, Mavs and Lakers. MJ and Phil had the patience and mentality to get the best out of him, all props to him. Anyone else, he bails.</p>

<p>If he actually cared game 5 at least isn’t a blow out.</p>

<p>Spurs tanking in 97 is some revisionist stuff lol. They won 5+ more games than the worst two teams and almost ended up with 6th best lottery odds.</p>

His teammate was banging his wife and he put a shotgun in his mouth and sat like that for hours.  His mental health issues were on display at that point, and only Phil Jackson did a good job harnessing him.  Rodman absolutely sabotaged that Spurs team, and we’ll never know what happened.  Not sure why you hate Robinson so much but your angle is weird.</p>

<p>His counting stats didn’t stand out compared to anyone ahead of him in MVP voting besides Ewing,</p>

<p>He missed 10 games, which was the most missed games in the top 5 of MVP voting, on top of already winning MVP last year.</p>

<p>Houston was the 6 seed with under 50 wins. Robinson and Malone both had 60+ while Shaq and Ewing were 55+</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clyde Drexler recalled how he went up to Hakeem and put forth his opinions on who the real MVP was. “I walk up to him and said ‘Dream you know I think that was your MVP that they just gave to David Robinson.’ He grabbed me in the arm and said, Drex do not worry, we will get the big trophy.”</p>

<p>Robert Horry spoke about how Olajuwon’s mind must have processed Robinson winning the trophy before his eyes. “Dream’s looking down there and you could see the steam coming out his ears and he looks saying ‘That’s my trophy.’”</p>

Hakeem is my favorite athlete of all-time and was a better player than David Robinson, but MVP is a reg season award and Hakeem rightfully wasn&rsquo;t in the convo.  Shaq had better stats than Hakeem on a team that won 10 (!!) more games.  Robinson had about equivalent stats on a team that won 15 (!!) more games.  Hakeem crushed them both in the playoffs because he was still the best C when it mattered, but as a reg season award there was no argument for him over either of those guys in &lsquo;94-&lsquo;95.</p>
