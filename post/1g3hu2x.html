<blockquote>
<p>With Denver, Joker [Nikola Jokic] is the best player in the league. But Denver’s second-best player is going backward. Jamal [Murray] hasn’t been the same. There is something about Jamal’s health and physical capacity right now that concerns me. Michael Porter is also terribly overrated. He’s a one-way player and just a scorer. I also don’t think Denver has the assets to get an upgrade. They’ll be stuck with the team they have.</p>

<p>Get lucky in the draft with a generational talent who doesn’t mind being in a small market.</p>

<p>Pair superstar with solid, borderline all-star #2.</p>

<p>Build around them as best you can while not being able to attract free agents and ring chasers. </p>

<p>Have a few years of playoff heartbreak. </p>

<p>Trade for a defensive specialist to serve as the final piece.</p>

<p>Win championship.</p>

<p>Forced to max everybody because they’re too good to let go for free and you can’t attract anyone better.</p>

<p>Watch core start to decline and injuries start to creep in.</p>

<p>Wonder if the Nuggets will also end up throwing a Hail Mary and try to trade for a disgruntled superstar.</p>

The teams that were in mid-contender form didn’t have time to prepare and while the Celtics kept their players, there’s a heavy price to pay that it might’ve cost our great ownership situation. Wyc has been amazing and now we might get someone who tightens the belt or doesn’t care about basketball.</p>

I wouldn’t have done it if I was Milwaukee because I don’t think Dame has much left in the tank, but I think they had to do something before the new CBA rules came slamming down on them and they took a huge gamble. Where I think they truly fucked up was firing Bud. I thought it was a mistake at the time and still do. Does anyone really think they’re better off with Doc than Bud? Even with Bud’s playoff history.</p>

<p>That seems to be the point of it, the league clearly doesn&rsquo;t want dynastic teams anymore and are doing everything in their power to make it impossible to keep good teams together.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s dumb, but it&rsquo;s been incredibly successful at ensuring that a variety of teams get the opportunity to have their day in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Murray+MPJr are both worth the value of just Murray&rsquo;s contract. The excess salary is wasted and doesn&rsquo;t allow for further improvements</p>

<p>Agreed. Also, fans saying they won&rsquo;t be happy unless they win <em>multiple</em> rings are just setting themselves up to be disappointed. It honestly feels like some fans don&rsquo;t even enjoy the &ldquo;journey&rdquo; of watching a great team and only want the pay-off of saying they won.</p>

<p>I’d honestly be shocked if Jokic never made it back and it would be a huge failure of the Denver front office to not put a team around him capable of doing so.</p>

<p>We can blame the CBA but if offered the same money, KCP and Bruce Brown could have stayed. It’s just Denver doesn’t want to pay the tax from those contracts and that’s kind of a shame. I’d feel the same way if we didn’t extend Derrick White and just let Sam Hauser hit free agency and say “well it’s the CBA” as an excuse.</p>

      <label for="lrvxare" class="commentText"><p>I think the Nuggets&rsquo; contention window started in 2020, but they lost two full years of possible contention due to the Murray injury.</p>

<p>So we&rsquo;re now entering the 6th years of their window, which is typically around where the wheels start to fall-off because now everyone is making a ton of money and you&rsquo;ve sacrificed depth to retain your most important guys (not to mention half a decade of typically low outcome draft picks).</p>

<p>So I think this is kinda normal. The only way around it was Murray and MPJ both turning into borderline All-Star guys, but neither of those seems like where this is headed right now.</p>

      <label for="lrvyauo" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, this fact usually gets glossed over. They made the Aaron Gordon trade in 2021, during Jokic&rsquo;s first MVP season. In those first 10 games the team played together before Murray blew the ACL, they were looking pretty dominant. Very good chance they could of won a ring in either 2021 or 2022 if not for the untimely Murray injury. It also doesn&rsquo;t help that they had really bad timing with the new CBA. If the front office was aware of the second apron, there is 0% chance MPJ gets the full max extension when he did.</p>

      <label for="lrw2soo" class="commentText"><p>Not exactly. The thing that you didn&rsquo;t mention is that the Nuggets were built in the old CBA, and with the new CBA, spending money to retain guys actually has consequences other than forcing ownership to cough up more tax money.</p>

<p>Your Warriors, for example, didn&rsquo;t lose their contention window due to money problems since Lacob was willing to pay for everything, including the Oakland A&rsquo;s. Had the Warriors&rsquo; KD years happened with the new CBA though, then I think the wheels would&rsquo;ve fallen off like you said. But under the old CBA, the wheels don&rsquo;t really fall off for monetary concerns.</p>

      <label for="lrw5qpz" class="commentText"><p>The process I&rsquo;m describing (the lack of young talent acquired through the draft and the ever thinning bench) worked exactly the same way with the Warriors.</p>

<p>In 2015-16, their bench unit Livington/Barbosa/Igoudala/Speights/Ezeli</p>

<p>By 2018-19, their bench unit was Quinn Cook, Alfonso McKinnie, Igoudala, Jonas Jerebko, and Damian Jones.</p>

<p>the 2nd apron limits would have changed a few things for the Warriors, but the vast majority of them would have been penalties that would have either limited their ability to build out the back end of the rotation (no TPMLE in FA) or would have been frozen draft picks that would <em>just now</em> have been starting to be an issue.</p>

<p>the difference between the Warriors and other teams is that their owner was willing to pay any cost (including future team flexibility) to win and they had more top-line talent than any team in NBA history.</p>

<p>the Nuggets don&rsquo;t have 4 guys who are All-NBA players. they have one who is and two guys who they hoped <em>might</em> get there. so their window collapse is going to happen faster, because the way the cap works (and worked before the new CBA) is that those guys get paid the same as the guys the Warriors had.</p>

      <label for="lrwg7qs" class="commentText"><p>They also didn&rsquo;t make any dumb moves. They waited for their young players to develop who looked like they were close to being rotation players. I think that was the right read. Murray&rsquo;s health has been hard, for me, to get a sense of. I think it is too early to freak out. Porter might be overrated, but Gordon was probably underrated at the time. I generally think when healthy they are a real title contender. I think that&rsquo;s a pretty reasonable place to be. I have a lot more faith that a 27 y/o Murray is going to return to form than I do Dame for example. I am not sure what the alternatives are. Maybe the comment shouldn&rsquo;t be understood to be a criticism. Maybe they are just stuck because of Murray and a lack of expected progression from Porter. That&rsquo;s perhaps fair. I think they are still pretty tough if Murray finds himself again. You can&rsquo;t really ever expect to be good if your #2 isn&rsquo;t healthy.</p>

      <label for="lrw6mga" class="commentText"><p>the Bucks are a tiny bit different, in that when their window opened (2019 playoffs), Giannis was the <em>only</em> guy on the rotation under the age of 25.</p>

<p>those veterans (and the subsequent move they made to add talent) meant that the team had a super high floor and they weren&rsquo;t depending on a number of young guys to pop, but that always meant that the window might slam shut earlier than you&rsquo;d hope because in addition to you losing depth over time, you&rsquo;re also running the risk of your supporting cast aging out (and injuries are more common for older players).</p>

<p>And i dont care how well he played in the regular season.</p>

<p>They have Jokic. He alone is almost guaranteed a playoffs spot.</p>

<p>Its how Murray and MPJ plays in the playoffs that matters</p>

<p>Way too much is placed on &ldquo;did you win or not&rdquo;, and yet winning one doesn&rsquo;t always carry the weight it deserves.</p>

<p>Jimmy, Harden, PG13, Lillard, Embiid, CP all have none and are 30+.</p>

<p>Players like KD, AD, Dwight, Marc Gasol all went somewhere as a number 2 or way lower to get one.</p>

<p>Internally and externally everything needs to line-up nearly perfectly, and if Denver &ldquo;only&rdquo; gets one, then it was worth it.</p>

<p>He went to the rockets when it was a pretty dead franchise and brought them back to contention. The rockets were a very mediocre team finishing barely over 500 every year while being stuck in lottery purgatory.</p>

<p>Harden brought them into contention and made them as the sole challenger to the greatest team ever assembled. Hakeem has the rings and imo is my pick but it&rsquo;s not crazy go view Harden in a better light imo. Both made HoF level careers out of their tenure in Houston. One just ran into the KD warriors and the other didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>just goes to show how fickle narratives in this league can be</p>

      <label for="lrw2tgj" class="commentText"><p>yeah I definitely think they regressed but this is like the equivalent of when people are like “we’re so back” to “it’s so over” lmao. quote reads like an obituary</p>

<p>it’s not THAT bad, realistically they’re still going to be one of the better teams in the West. I’m not really as worried about Murray as everyone else I think he’s just in a slump and he’ll come out of it. from there if they get lucky with health/matchups they are definitely capable of making a run at the title</p>

      <label for="lrw6z1a" class="commentText"><p>People are acting like MPJ sucks because of one series. He was great against The Lakers and was able to pick up the huge slack Jamal left. He also played 81 games for us last year and was regularly contributing to wins. Dude just entered his prime years. I am not saying he&rsquo;s gonna be a world beater but at the same time I think people are majorly discounting his ability to level up this year.</p>

      <label for="lrw9w77" class="commentText"><p>yeah people are overreacting to Murray and MPJ, they’re naturally streaky guys who had bad postseasons. better players than them have had worse playoff performances, doesn’t mean they’re bums now</p>

<p>for me it’s like if you wanna be iffy on Denver you should be iffy about their bench, 3P shooting, perimeter defense and rim protection. but that’s questionable just bc we don’t know what we’re gonna get from Braun, Watson and Strawther this year. obviously they didn’t contribute as much as the Nuggets were hoping last season but they’re all still developing players and could easily become legit, consistent NBA rotation players this season</p>

      <label for="lrvz4l1" class="commentText"><p>MPJ is 26 years old and can be a much better player than he has been.  If the Nuggets are going to compete, he will need to find that extra gear.  From what I have seen so far, he looks to have improved quite a bit.  I agree with the Murray take though.  He just doesn&rsquo;t seem to have the health to make it through a season and consistently play at an all star level.  If the stars align again and he is healthy in the playoffs, the Nuggets are still pretty tough to beat.</p>

      <label for="lrw65sc" class="commentText"><p>I’d agree with this. They’ve lost almost an entire bench’s worth of productive role players - KCP, Bruce Brown, Jeff Green - without really replacing them (remember they already HAD Braun). Westbrook, even if he really accepts a bench role, isn’t going to solve the problems they have, namely not being able to switch on defense well enough to cover for their weaknesses there and surrounding Jokic with shooting to punish double-teams.</p>

<p>Look at their roster - holes everywhere. Who is in their starting 5? You’re choosing between Westbrook and Braun at the 2. Backup center is still DeAndre Jordan.</p>

<p>Malone was right to be mad at their GM. They won’t be terrible but when the time comes the better, deeper teams will expose them, even if Jokic is still the league’s best.</p>

      <label for="lrwa9ca" class="commentText"><p>Well watching Brown do the job in the playoffs in clutch moments is what made me believe in him sure… but that doesn’t mean you let him walk and that he wasn’t important? Jeff Green should have been no surprise to anyone because he’s a pro’s pro and has been forever. I could get over Green leaving (Saric is probably equal to him although I dunno if he’s as switchable) but Brown was a big loss, although I dunno what they could have done because he wanted that bag.</p>

      <label for="lrwbmn0" class="commentText"><p>Then Brown left the Nuggets and did jack all.  He was on the Pacers and pretty useless for them before getting traded.</p>

<p>The Nuggets could not keep Brown.  He was offered <span class="math inline">\(20 mill a year and the max Denver could offer was \)</span>12 as they only had 1 year bird rights.  Jeff Green was pretty much the same as Justin Holiday was last year.  Some 3 and D stuff.  As good as KCP is, he&rsquo;s not worth the $25 million he&rsquo;s now getting.</p>

<p>The Nuggets are and have always been good because their starting lineup is good.  It doesn&rsquo;t have to do with their depth, even though that&rsquo;s the popular narrative.  Their bench was ass when they won, and it was ass last year.  The Jokic on/off plus/minus has always been insane because our bench has always been bad.  The Nuggets failed last year because their starting lineup wasn&rsquo;t giga positive on plus minus in the playoffs especially against the wolves.  Even then they only lost by a sliver and probably would&rsquo;ve been favored in the WCF and Finals if they made it.</p>

There are still plenty of teams talented enough to win this year and the nuggets are one of them. It just takes injury luck and getting hot when its right. Sure we are not the favorite and these statements could be true but that doens&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t contend imo</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s wild that people still refuse to understand how small an NBA Title window is (and why I found Giannis&rsquo; postseason comments from a couple years ago maybe the weirdest thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard an intelligent player say.)</p>

<p>I would not remotely be surprised if Denver never makes another Finals.</p>

<p>They will be in contention for another couple years. Joker is that dominant.</p>

<p>But, they are what they are. They are only going to regress. And have zero ways to improve.</p>

      <label for="lrw1nri" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m a MPJ defender and I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s that overpaid. I&rsquo;d be a lot more worried about paying Jamal 50M a year after how gassed he looked in the playoffs/Olympics.</p>

<p>You can be frustrated that MPJ doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of shot creation for the money that he&rsquo;s being paid, but he&rsquo;s a huge wing that&rsquo;s an incredible 3-level scorer, above-average rebounder and isn&rsquo;t a negative defensively. If the Nuggets didn&rsquo;t pay him, someone else would have.</p>

<p>That being said I do get the idea of trading MPJ for a distressed wing + rotation piece. There&rsquo;s only two trades though that make sense to me.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>MPJ to Atlanta for Bogdan and DeAndre Hunter. I don&rsquo;t see why the Hawks would do this honestly - they just drafted a huge wing #1 overall.</p></li>

<li><p>MPJ to Brooklyn for Cam Johnson and Dennis Schroeder. I can see the Nets wanting to take an upside flier on MPJ, but Denver would only do this if the Russ experiment fails and Brooklyn is confident enough with <em>Ben Simmons</em> being a starting-caliber point guard again.</p></li>

Most other winners end up like this. Aging, bloated team with no path to improve, as free agency takes away the “soul” of your rotation. The only reason they got the chip was lucking out a bit on Gordon. No one ever could have dreamed he would buy in and be so great. He will obviously opt out next year….and the soul is even more gone</p>

      <label for="lrw830v" class="commentText"><p>I think MPJ should get some slack considering where his family was at least year. Mentally, that would have been tough for anyone.</p>

<p>Murray needs to bounce back hard because I don’t really blame anyone for thinking his injuries have robbed him of his prime. With that said, his regular season numbers were never that crazy. He has always been a big game player and I’d be hesitant to dismiss him until we see him fudge another playoff series.</p>

<p>The nuggets also have a case for being the most fucked over by the CBA team in the league. They couldn’t even offer Bruce brown a decent contract (because of the rules) and they couldn’t extend KCP (because it would put them in the second apron. Jury is still out on whether that was the right move but it was probably the logical move). And I say the nuggets have this case despite my beloved Knicks losing Hartenstein because of cap bullshit this past offseason (which forced us to trade Julius and Donte)</p>

<p>Trade Joker for an absolutely insane haul of picks and proven young players in a package that also includes Murray and Porter, and start over. For example, you could probably get the Pistons to give you Cunningham, Stewart, Wiseman, Duren AND two or three firsts for that haul. And they&rsquo;re far from the only team that would be willing to make a move like that.</p>

<p>The only limitation is the salary cap.</p>

<p>Tank for a season or two, grab some lottery picks, and rebuild.</p>
