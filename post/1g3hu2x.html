<p>With Denver, Joker [Nikola Jokic] is the best player in the league. But Denver’s second-best player is going backward. Jamal [Murray] hasn’t been the same. There is something about Jamal’s health and physical capacity right now that concerns me. Michael Porter is also terribly overrated. He’s a one-way player and just a scorer. I also don’t think Denver has the assets to get an upgrade. They’ll be stuck with the team they have.</p>

      <label for="lrwshel" class="commentText"><p>Nuggets have to hope for that because they have no choice. They had no choice but to extend and overpay Murray because top free agents don&rsquo;t choose Denver. Murray has to produce at least 80% of his 2023 playoff level, Braun has to be a solid starter, and at least two bench players have to be solid contributors.</p>

<p>Every good team that is not in a market favored by free agents is going to have to follow the overpay-and-hope strategy as well, once their top players become extension eligible.  Minnesota, this is your future.</p>

<p>That seems to be the point of it, the league clearly doesn&rsquo;t want dynastic teams anymore and are doing everything in their power to make it impossible to keep good teams together.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s dumb, but it&rsquo;s been incredibly successful at ensuring that a variety of teams get the opportunity to have their day in the sunshine.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure it does, but competing for a title brings in a lot of revenue for that franchise.    It brings a big boost of bandwagon fans that stick around for a while after your title.  For example, the nuggets sell 2x as many tickets as they did pre-covid and their subreddit tripled in subscribers after winning their title.  Even the Celtics, one of the two most storied franchises in the NBA, had their sub almost double in size from 2023 to present (~330k to ~640k subscribers).</p>

      <label for="lrwut2x" class="commentText"><p>I think it will just eventually change how winning teams are built. The current “meta” requires at least two all-star level players with a third one that’s borderline, but the new CBA punishes that because you can’t keep other guys around it and the moment one of those guys falls off even a little bit you’re basically dead in the water.</p>

<p>My guess is we’ll see teams have just one star but a much more schematically cohesive team built around him with less overall talent, which the new CBA allows you to actually keep together, and you have guys fitting specific roles that can be more easily replaced as they age out.</p>

      <label for="lrwx7bh" class="commentText"><p>And also: the draft. We see a similar phenomenon in the NFL and I&rsquo;m quite sure that Silver wants the NBA Draft to be closer to the NFL Draft than to the &ldquo;Go Lotto or Go Home&rdquo; mentality that we have now. You will actually need to draft and develop the #3 and #4s in your team now and, with the never-ending inflation of the max and supermax deals, even the #2 will, more often than not, come from within.</p>

<p>I do believe that the league and the owners are sick and tired of the &ldquo;pay and trade&rdquo; risk, with stars and superstars holding the team hostage because &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t do what I want, I&rsquo;m asking to be traded for a subpar price&rdquo;. Owners dislike superteams, fans often will also dislike superteams. The new CBA was an amazing excuse by the owners to spend less, yes, but also comes with positives, because now talent is pretty much obliged to be spread and, in the long term, we will see teams actually paying attention to their 2nd round picks instead of tossing them in the G-League trash bin.</p>

<p>Dame had an up and down regular season, but in the playoffs he played like&hellip;you know, Damian Lillard. A healthy Giannis and Dame actually getting to play together come playoffs is gonna make a lot of people eat crow.</p>

Where I think they truly fucked up was firing Bud. I thought it was a mistake at the time and still do. Does anyone really think they’re better off with Doc than Bud?

<p>It&rsquo;s wild to me that ring chasers aren&rsquo;t flocking to Jokic or Luka. They are so capable and both known for throwing perfect dimes to hit you in your spots. I know contracts make it difficult, but if I was a 35yo All-Star looking for a new team to maybe finish my career with, I would be requesting Denver or Dallas as a spot to land.</p>

<p>Agreed. Also, fans saying they won&rsquo;t be happy unless they win <em>multiple</em> rings are just setting themselves up to be disappointed. It honestly feels like some fans don&rsquo;t even enjoy the &ldquo;journey&rdquo; of watching a great team and only want the pay-off of saying they won.</p>

      <label for="lrwkvla" class="commentText"><p>As a Pistons fan who remembers the 2000s era, all those years of contention where we didn’t ultimately win the title hold nearly as many positive memories as the championship year.</p>

<p>Having been a legit title threat for like five years is always fun to look back on. Years from now, Denver fans will relish the memories of Murray staring down Kevin Harlan and hitting the two game-winners over LA; the sting of losing fades over time.</p>

<p>I do admit feeling some disappointment that we only came out of that era with one title — people always say “2004 Pistons” and not the “2000s Pistons,” and they often discredit how good we were in subsequent years.</p>

<p>But that’s probably to do with the fact we won our ring at the start of the era (which really began with the Sheed trade; we’d made the conference finals in ‘03, but that team never felt like a true contender) and never matched it.</p>

<p>Most other single-ring teams, like possibly Denver and Milwaukee of this era or Dallas and Toronto last decade, went through years of heartbreak before finally tasting glory. And in those cases, I think, the title simply is sweeter — delayed gratification and all.</p>

      <label for="lrvxare" class="commentText"><p>I think the Nuggets&rsquo; contention window started in 2020, but they lost two full years of possible contention due to the Murray injury.</p>

<p>So we&rsquo;re now entering the 6th years of their window, which is typically around where the wheels start to fall-off because now everyone is making a ton of money and you&rsquo;ve sacrificed depth to retain your most important guys (not to mention half a decade of typically low outcome draft picks).</p>

<p>So I think this is kinda normal. The only way around it was Murray and MPJ both turning into borderline All-Star guys, but neither of those seems like where this is headed right now.</p>

      <label for="lrvyauo" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, this fact usually gets glossed over. They made the Aaron Gordon trade in 2021, during Jokic&rsquo;s first MVP season. In those first 10 games the team played together before Murray blew the ACL, they were looking pretty dominant. Very good chance they could of won a ring in either 2021 or 2022 if not for the untimely Murray injury. It also doesn&rsquo;t help that they had really bad timing with the new CBA. If the front office was aware of the second apron, there is 0% chance MPJ gets the full max extension when he did.</p>

      <label for="lrwg7qs" class="commentText"><p>They also didn&rsquo;t make any dumb moves. They waited for their young players to develop who looked like they were close to being rotation players. I think that was the right read. Murray&rsquo;s health has been hard, for me, to get a sense of. I think it is too early to freak out. Porter might be overrated, but Gordon was probably underrated at the time. I generally think when healthy they are a real title contender. I think that&rsquo;s a pretty reasonable place to be. I have a lot more faith that a 27 y/o Murray is going to return to form than I do Dame for example. I am not sure what the alternatives are. Maybe the comment shouldn&rsquo;t be understood to be a criticism. Maybe they are just stuck because of Murray and a lack of expected progression from Porter. That&rsquo;s perhaps fair. I think they are still pretty tough if Murray finds himself again. You can&rsquo;t really ever expect to be good if your #2 isn&rsquo;t healthy.</p>

      <label for="lrw2soo" class="commentText"><p>Not exactly. The thing that you didn&rsquo;t mention is that the Nuggets were built in the old CBA, and with the new CBA, spending money to retain guys actually has consequences other than forcing ownership to cough up more tax money.</p>

<p>Your Warriors, for example, didn&rsquo;t lose their contention window due to money problems since Lacob was willing to pay for everything, including the Oakland A&rsquo;s. Had the Warriors&rsquo; KD years happened with the new CBA though, then I think the wheels would&rsquo;ve fallen off like you said. But under the old CBA, the wheels don&rsquo;t really fall off for monetary concerns.</p>

      <label for="lrw5qpz" class="commentText"><p>The process I&rsquo;m describing (the lack of young talent acquired through the draft and the ever thinning bench) worked exactly the same way with the Warriors.</p>

<p>In 2015-16, their bench unit Livington/Barbosa/Igoudala/Speights/Ezeli</p>

<p>By 2018-19, their bench unit was Quinn Cook, Alfonso McKinnie, Igoudala, Jonas Jerebko, and Damian Jones.</p>

<p>the 2nd apron limits would have changed a few things for the Warriors, but the vast majority of them would have been penalties that would have either limited their ability to build out the back end of the rotation (no TPMLE in FA) or would have been frozen draft picks that would <em>just now</em> have been starting to be an issue.</p>

<p>the difference between the Warriors and other teams is that their owner was willing to pay any cost (including future team flexibility) to win and they had more top-line talent than any team in NBA history.</p>

<p>the Nuggets don&rsquo;t have 4 guys who are All-NBA players. they have one who is and two guys who they hoped <em>might</em> get there. so their window collapse is going to happen faster, because the way the cap works (and worked before the new CBA) is that those guys get paid the same as the guys the Warriors had.</p>

      <label for="lrw6mga" class="commentText"><p>the Bucks are a tiny bit different, in that when their window opened (2019 playoffs), Giannis was the <em>only</em> guy on the rotation under the age of 25.</p>

<p>those veterans (and the subsequent move they made to add talent) meant that the team had a super high floor and they weren&rsquo;t depending on a number of young guys to pop, but that always meant that the window might slam shut earlier than you&rsquo;d hope because in addition to you losing depth over time, you&rsquo;re also running the risk of your supporting cast aging out (and injuries are more common for older players).</p>

      <label for="lrw2mww" class="commentText"><p>Totally agree</p>

<p>Way too much is placed on &ldquo;did you win or not&rdquo;, and yet winning one doesn&rsquo;t always carry the weight it deserves.</p>

<p>Jimmy, Harden, PG13, Lillard, Embiid, CP all have none and are 30+.</p>

<p>Players like KD, AD, Dwight, Marc Gasol all went somewhere as a number 2 or way lower to get one.</p>

<p>Internally and externally everything needs to line-up nearly perfectly, and if Denver &ldquo;only&rdquo; gets one, then it was worth it.</p>

<p>He went to the rockets when it was a pretty dead franchise and brought them back to contention. The rockets were a very mediocre team finishing barely over 500 every year while being stuck in lottery purgatory.</p>

<p>Harden brought them into contention and made them as the sole challenger to the greatest team ever assembled. Hakeem has the rings and imo is my pick but it&rsquo;s not crazy go view Harden in a better light imo. Both made HoF level careers out of their tenure in Houston. One just ran into the KD warriors and the other didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>it’s not THAT bad, realistically they’re still going to be one of the better teams in the West. I’m not really as worried about Murray as everyone else I think he’s just in a slump and he’ll come out of it. from there if they get lucky with health/matchups they are definitely capable of making a run at the title</p>

He also played 81 games for us last year and was regularly contributing to wins. Dude just entered his prime years.

<p>for me it’s like if you wanna be iffy on Denver you should be iffy about their bench, 3P shooting, perimeter defense and rim protection. but those are questions mainly bc we just don’t know what we’re gonna get from Braun, Watson and Strawther this year. obviously they didn’t contribute as much as the Nuggets were hoping last season. but they’re all still developing and could easily become legit, consistent NBA rotation players this season to shore up some of those concerns</p>

From what I have seen so far, he looks to have improved quite a bit.  I agree with the Murray take though.  He just doesn&rsquo;t seem to have the health to make it through a season and consistently play at an all star level.  If the stars align again and he is healthy in the playoffs, the Nuggets are still pretty tough to beat.</p>

      <label for="lrw65sc" class="commentText"><p>I’d agree with this. They’ve lost almost an entire bench’s worth of productive role players - KCP, Bruce Brown, Jeff Green - without really replacing them (remember they already HAD Braun). Westbrook, even if he really accepts a bench role, isn’t going to solve the problems they have, namely not being able to switch on defense well enough to cover for their weaknesses there and surrounding Jokic with shooting to punish double-teams.</p>

<p>Look at their roster - holes everywhere. Who is in their starting 5? You’re choosing between Westbrook and Braun at the 2. Backup center is still DeAndre Jordan.</p>

<p>Malone was right to be mad at their GM. They won’t be terrible but when the time comes the better, deeper teams will expose them, even if Jokic is still the league’s best.</p>

<p>If he was healthy last season they finish as the 1 seed again and probably walk to the finals. Or if he was even just healthy for the playoffs they beat Minnesota and probably beat Dallas. </p>

<p>He&rsquo;s looked terrible in the preseason so far. Last night he looked like the worst player on the court against the Suns second string. </p>

<p>He hasn&rsquo;t looked good since March or April so getting pretty concerning at this point.</p>
