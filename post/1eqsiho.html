      <label for="lhuh5h1" class="commentText"><p>They also misunderstood his role on defense based on reputation. I remember him not being a great on-ball defender even on the Spurs, he was an off-ball disruptor kind of like a guard version of Giannis who got a lot of steals and deflections. With Derrick White being the main on-ball defender.</p>

<p>Then you add him being best on offense with the ball in his hands.</p>

      <label for="lhuhwwi" class="commentText"><p>That sounds accurate. I think he was appealing at the time because he was riding off those defensive accolades.</p>

<p>I think the Hawks felt they could mold him into the point of attack defender they needed and he just wasn’t capable. No fault of his, but that’s simply not his game.</p>

      <label for="lhun5o7" class="commentText"><p>problem I have with this analysis is the guy who did the trade, Landry Fields, is from Spurs system and knew Dejounte in and out. He was even Spurs scout when they drafted Dejounte and saw him up close.</p>

<p>To me, I can only conclude it&rsquo;s just him unwilling to spend energy on defense. Analysts have talked about balancing energy needed for offense and defense. If you want to be a creator and workhorse on offense, you gotta sacrifice that on defense a la Don with Utah.</p>

      <label for="lhut9n0" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m not so sure that&rsquo;s how it went down. If I recall, and I could be wrong, this sort of trade was pushed from higher up. I&rsquo;m not stanning Fields, but i don&rsquo;t know that he makes that trade without outside pressure.</p>

<p>Indeed, redditors are often wrong, supposed experts are off the mark, but many, many people scratched their heads at that trade, wondering how that was going to work out. Not often, but occasionally, the fans and arm-chair GMs get it right and many, many people called this not working out. And it didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Is Fields a bad GM or was he pressured to get &ldquo;another star&rdquo; and went with a guy he was familiar with? Its not like Murray was necessarily bad, he was just a poor fit.</p>

<p>There was lots of smoke suggesting Nick Ressler (owner Tony Ressler’s son) pushed the proposal forward when Dejounte became available. At the time Trae was on board with the idea so there was a lot of support by multiple parties.</p>

<p>Former GM Travis Schlenk heavily opposed the deal and seemed to conflict with ownership because of it. Eventually he was out of the picture later that fall.</p>

<p>I could be totally wrong but I don’t think Landry was a driving force in the original Murray acquisition. He didn’t become GM of the Hawks until January of 2023 anyway.</p>

<p>Conversely, the Hawks finished 27th in defensive rating. It dropped down to 30th at multiple times.</p>

<p>They didn’t play well together but it was the defense that suffered so badly.</p>

      <label for="lhuj9o1" class="commentText"><p>Yes, a big part of it was having a solid PG when Trae was off the floor. But the big fear was repeating the 2022 Heat series when their defense stomped on Trae.</p>

<p>At the time I don’t think the Hawks really needed to go all out for another ball handler. They just needed another guy who <strong>could</strong> handle the ball. Shooting was a big issue in 2021-22 for the Hawks.</p>

      <label for="lhtxluc" class="commentText"><p>Agreed. I think he was attempting to shift into a more classic SG role where scoring is his biggest asset. In reality he&rsquo;s a combo guard who&rsquo;s strength is being a great defender who can give you 20 every night and 25-30 when someone is off or he is feeling it. Trae was right to be excited because that player fits his skill set perfectly. Seems like there both good dudes. Wish it could&rsquo;ve been more productive, would&rsquo;ve been a fun squad.</p>

<p>Not necessarily a bad thing, as DJ has improved his offense across the board. We needed his defense, which has taken a large step back</p>

Trae is a dangerous shooter but not a catch and shoot player, and Dejounte wants to be on the ball. Basically, they both want to do the same thing: handle the ball, drive and distribute, and take pull up shots when the defense plays off or on pick and pop, which is most of the time.</p>

<p>This doesn’t suggest Dejounte is a great fit on the Pels either, who also have guys who want to be on the ball including Zion.</p>

<p>Ironically the perfect fit for Dejounte right now is…the Spurs.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s not. I thought they were going to trade Ingram to alleviate that a bit. If they go into the season with their current starters, it could be a disappointing year in Louisiana.</p>

<p>unless the argument then is trae is only effective on the ball, trae off the ball coming off screens, setting screens, seems pretty dangerous to me</p>

<p>it also is a skill needed when maybe he does get another player as good as him, so he can actually play off the ball</p>

<p>you look at recent champions and it is a lot of the top guys letting &ldquo;worse&rdquo; offensive players handle the ball</p>

<p>Tatum was alright letting Brown and White handle the ball and do shit</p>

<p>Jokic was alright letting Jamal handle and make decisions</p>

<p>Steph of course is the ultimate example</p>

<p>Middleton made a lot of decisions for that Bucks team</p>

<p>The hawks were better with Trae on / Dejounte off than with both of them on the court or Dejounte on / Trae off.</p>

<p>For much of Trae’s career, him being the sole ball handler has led to a top 5 offensive rating. One terrible playoff series against the Heat caused the FO to panic and get <em>another primary ball handler.</em> Both are good players but are a terrible fit and couldn’t play together. No one thinks Murray is a bad player.</p>

The Hawks have decided they wanna stick with him and keep the fans happy rather than try for another rebuild, and I think that&rsquo;s fine but it&rsquo;ll keep them in mediocrity until they trade him</p>

      <label for="lhtzj91" class="commentText"><p>I think he meant it in the sense that they’re both just PGs, they don’t know how to play off other people well. Their best attempt at it was the my turn your turn offense we saw. Rather than playing off each other, they were just willing to let the other do what they already do well, which is play as a PG. They wouldn’t necessarily join in on the play though, DJ would run his top of the key iso, and DJ would watch Trae spam PnR. They didn’t leverage each other’s gravity.</p>

<p>DJ did a better job off the catch than Trae did by far, but that wasn’t enough. They watched each other most nights. It’s not due to Trae or DJ being selfish, at least that’s my take after watching them play for two years.</p>

Work but spurs fan were 1000% right. He’s a really ball
Dominant PG where he really is looking to drive and score more than facilitate and never switched gears like
Parker did. If he doesn’t change his mindset it’s not gonna work in NOH either. He really should buckle down and say he’s gonna be a 10apg and lockdown defender much like jrue</p>

<p>Also the only thing he actually said about why they didn&rsquo;t work is that they&rsquo;re both &ldquo;unselfish&rdquo; and Dejounte was known as a defender in San Antonion, which isn&rsquo;t even true, Dejounte was averaging 15 pts and 21 pts his last two years in San Antonio, he was taking the same amount of shots in San Antonio but averaging more assists because he was running the offense, it was Trae who could never adjust to him</p>

<p>Trae was jacking up shots, his FG% and 3PT% both dropped when he played with Dejounte, he never figured out how to play with him</p>
