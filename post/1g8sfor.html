<p>The change is good for both Murray and the Hawks. Trae&rsquo;s #2 should be a wing or a big and Murray should be in a place where he can be the primary PG.</p>

<p>Lol this sounds familiar. Check out the bio of Miami Heat CEO Nick Arison (son of owner Micky Arison). I expect he&rsquo;ll get roster control once Pat <del>Biden</del> Riley finally retires</p>

<p>people were pessimistic about Harden/CP too (i obviously understand they&rsquo;re insane talents) and then they won 65 games and were like a 70 win pace when healthy</p>

      <label for="lt0zk9r" class="commentText"><p>that was people being stupid and blinded though. Kyrie Irving has shown elite off ball play his entire career but he was public enemy number 1 (warranted to an extent of course) and it had people wanting him to fail.</p>

<p>Murray was never a great shooter and on ball playmaking is his biggest strength offensively. Kyrie Irving is a 40% 3 point shooter with experience playing with ball dominant players.</p>

<p>EDIT: if you’re speaking defensively, I can understand your point more though. Dont think people could have predicted us building that strong of a defense around those two.</p>

      <label for="lt0rc2c" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s true, I remember being impressed with the Hawks, but a lot of that had to do with Capela/Okongwu dominating the boards and Johnson being an unexpectedly solid player. Trae and Murray couldn&rsquo;t get things going at the same time either. Murray probably shot the best I&rsquo;ve ever seen him shoot though.</p>

But also an extreme overreaction to that horrific Miami series where the heat trapped Trae at every opportunity and the rest of the hawks couldn’t take two dribbles without tripping over their own feet (not absolving Trae as that was the worst he’s played in his career).</p>

<p>All the talk was about getting a second facilitator to basically never allow that to happen again. But honestly that’s what you need a Jalen Johnson type for not a Murray</p>

<p>Are biggest needs were perimeter defense and someone to run the floor when Trae sits and “in theory” Dejounte filled both of those needs.</p>

<p>The problem was that DJ’s defense regressed to a point where Trae was somehow the better defender.</p>

      <label for="lt12btk" class="commentText"><p>I think the hope and dream was that Trae could use his shooting gravity to open up the offense more off ball, and Murray could accentuate that even more off drive and kicks. Then when Trae was the ball Murray could still shoot or cut. Murray’s defense was supposed to help out too.</p>

<p>But yeah bringing in another ball handler to a helio centric ball dominant pg is extremely extremely hit or miss. Kyrie/luka make it work because, they’re both cerebral, Kyries lethal off ball (movement too) and of course Luka is 6’7 250 or whatever</p>

He has a bully and 3 game and it works best against similar sized Players or smaller not the Small Forwards. If they played him at the 2 he would’ve been worth keeping. If they’re just gonna keep shuffling in useless shooters like Grimes at the 2 and put him at the 3, the Trade was a no-brainer. That Gay-DeRozan-Ross-Lowry Team was nasty on 2k though.</p>

When he played and when the team was on a healthy stretch he looks/looked absolutely awesome. Virtually every consistent, &ldquo;normal&rdquo; stretch of pro basketball he&rsquo;s played has been at or near high quality for his age/development. But people saw the missed layups after he was coming back from a horrible flu spell and a bad breakup and took it as gospel that he was trash.</p>

<p>Edit: to the Dejounte defenders down here, you&rsquo;ll soon discover that he is the problem &amp; he isn&rsquo;t who he thinks he is. We&rsquo;ll see how will do with 3 other players that need the ball in their hands just like Trae</p>

<p>He may not have run to Windhorst or somebody like that to complain in person, but he certainly let it be known that he was unhappy in his role here. Lotsa cryptic social media bitching, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and still making improvements to his game</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s the part he&rsquo;s angry about! Being in the corner and on the wings next to Trae got him tons of wide open catch and shoot 3s, so his shooting percentage went way up! But somehow he&rsquo;s pissed about it.</p>

<p>Dejounte continually commands contests and forces defense to respect his shot which is the entire point, he opens up space on the floor and knocks down threes at a respectable clip and volume.</p>

      <label for="lt0zczh" class="commentText"><p>The average 3 point percentage stat is a bit misleading because it doesn’t account for volume, the value of shot-creation and just how guarded/contested those shots are. A player like Deandre Hunter shooting 38% from 3 is not the same as someone like Luka shooting 38% from three.</p>

<p>They have the same percentages but no rational person will ever argue that Hunter is a better 3pt shooter than Luka. Dejounte shooting that percentage from 3, and on that volume and degree of difficulty, especially since a lot were generated off the dribble rather than off catch-and-shoot scenarios, which are generally easier, more open shots, suggests he is a good 3pt shooter.</p>

      <label for="lt0t491" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I’m extremely interested in the fit alongside those 3. I know CJ has played next to a ball dominant guard before, in Lillard. But adding Ingram(I guess until he gets traded) AND Zion to that mix gets reaaaaaal murky.</p>

<p>The Hawks played at a 41 win pace in games with DJM but without Trae, a sizable improvement over the 33 win pace when Trae did play. This isn&rsquo;t shade at Trae Young, just highlighting how good DJM was when the two weren&rsquo;t forced to play together</p>

      <label for="lt0wrsx" class="commentText"><p>I thought it would work for them because teams were keying on Trae without punishment, but with Dejounte, you would have both a weapon to kill 4 on 3s (after Trae is trapped) and, for other situations, a ball handler you had to respect while also watching Trae run through screens around the court like curry. Then on the defensive end, you are putting Trae next to a long, plus defender.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Trae wasn’t really running around like that and Dejounte wasn’t the defender I thought he would be. I think both guys just didn’t feel the same energy without the ball. I really don’t blame them for trying.</p>

<p>And now that it’s over, I don’t think they are in a bad spot either. Very real possibility that a Trae Dyson Risacher JJ and Clint lineup feasts on some unsuspecting teams. Bogi + Hunter (with health) + OO would fill out a decent playoff rotation and they have some regular season depth on top of that. Not a bad team at all and could be spooky if certain guys develop.</p>

Then the coaches refused to create a system when they could work effectively. It’s either iso ball or drive and kick. No motions, off ball screen action, nothing. When is the last time 2 PGs lead a championship team? You could see it from a mile away.</p>
