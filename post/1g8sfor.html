<p>The change is good for both Murray and the Hawks. Trae&rsquo;s #2 should be a wing or a big and Murray should be in a place where he can be the primary PG.</p>

<p>Lol this sounds familiar. Check out the bio of Miami Heat CEO Nick Arison (son of owner Micky Arison). I expect he&rsquo;ll get roster control once Pat <del>Biden</del> Riley finally retires</p>

<p>He started as an attendant probably in his teens in the late 90s; kept getting promoted probably after college and has been CEO for the last 13 years. IDC how good someone is at their job, you don&rsquo;t move up that quickly, that high. It&rsquo;s nepotism, but it&rsquo;s fine. Most of us would do the same for our kids if they wanted to be in the family business.</p>

<p>Also, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a move out there that has been attributed to his son. In fact, I&rsquo;m pretty sure Spo has more say in what goes on and there&rsquo;s a belief among Heat beatwriters and fans that he will take over Riley&rsquo;s job when Riley&rsquo;s no longer with the Heat.</p>

      <label for="lt1wdzb" class="commentText"><p>HAwks fans are full-on conspiracy theorists when it comes to Ressler.  His son is obviously a nepo hire and not necessarily earning his promotions, but he&rsquo;s also not a key decision maker, at all.  He&rsquo;s a fly on the wall, learning the ropes, as others have said.</p>

<p>For anyone paying attention, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious that Ressler is the final decision maker (all owners are ofc), but also that he has a lot of respect for Quin Snyder and Landry&rsquo;s vision for the team&ndash; a long term plan for sustained success, which they have been executing on for 2 years now.  Most fans can&rsquo;t look past the next season with regards to decision making so there are a lot of really shitty arm chair takes that have taken over our sub and the Hawks-social-media-verse.</p>

<p>To add more to that, in my opinion, Ressler is itching to go into the tax to contend, but there has not been an opportunity that makes sense to do so.  Our ECF run was on the back of the most expensive bench in the NBA (that decimated Phillys bench units) because our starters were on rookie deals.  So people act like he avoids the tax at all costs because they want to blow through the second apron to retain john f*cking collins or kevin heurter, but in reality, we just don&rsquo;t have a core that is worth starting a tax timer on.  Thank god we did not start our tax timer to pay for mediocre bench depth or we&rsquo;d be in a materially worse position than we are now.</p>

<p>All the talk was about getting a second facilitator to basically never allow that to happen again. But honestly that’s what you need a Jalen Johnson type for not a Murray</p>

      <label for="lt15n8c" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I think the logic behind the Murray trade was fine in theory, but it didn&rsquo;t work because 1) neither he nor Trae were able to work off-ball with each other, 2) his defense was nowhere near what his reputation was, and 3) we overpaid like crazy to get him. If only one of those happens you deal with it, but with all three happening you get what the past two seasons have been.</p>

<p>Murray was never a great shooter and on ball playmaking is his biggest strength offensively. Kyrie Irving is a 40% 3 point shooter with experience playing with ball dominant players.</p>

<p>EDIT: if you’re speaking defensively, I can understand your point more though. Dont think people could have predicted us building that strong of a defense around those two.</p>

<p>On here at least, you&rsquo;re just completely off. The idea in theory was fine. Two primary ball handlers is fine. Helps give Trae a break and makes up for his lack of defence. Murray just wasn&rsquo;t good enough and Trae probably could&rsquo;ve done more off ball too.</p>

Many thought it was a slight overpay but most thought that putting someone who could defend and handle the ball next to Trae would be an improvement. The thing people were worried about was DJ’s shooting and that ended up not being bad. He just immediately turned into a negative defender and he his PG skills weren’t very impressive. Granted we didn’t have the best options to pass to.</p>

      <label for="lt3n1wd" class="commentText"><p>When they made the trade, I said that the only way this works is if Trae gets way, way more comfortable running off-ball plays to get open, a la Steph, and if they run the maximum minutes with only one of them on the floor.</p>

<p>Neither of those happened, obviously.</p>

      <label for="lt12btk" class="commentText"><p>I think the hope and dream was that Trae could use his shooting gravity to open up the offense more off ball, and Murray could accentuate that even more off drive and kicks. Then when Trae was the ball Murray could still shoot or cut. Murray’s defense was supposed to help out too.</p>

<p>But yeah bringing in another ball handler to a helio centric ball dominant pg is extremely extremely hit or miss. Kyrie/luka make it work because, they’re both cerebral, Kyries lethal off ball (movement too) and of course Luka is 6’7 250 or whatever</p>

      <label for="lt3aqfp" class="commentText"><p>To be fair to him, when you&rsquo;re standing in the corner &amp; on the wing, you aren&rsquo;t just going to be spotting up, and taking a couple dribbles into a mid range jump shot is a pretty common way for guys who are catching the ball in those spots to get off their looks.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t take this as him saying he was stuck in the corner, more like him saying he was getting the ball after the offence was started, and wasn&rsquo;t able to bring the ball up the court and act as the point guard - not as much a commentary on where his shots came from.</p>

Like just based off vibes Dejounte is like one of my favorite players ever. I haven’t watched that many games live but every time he’s been easily the bucket on the floor. I got to see Harden once and same thing he hit 6 threes even tho that’s obviously atypical (also against the hawks). I think it’s why old heads overrate shit cuz you only have memory of it and when you see someone just getting 7-8 straight buckets they really look like one of the greatest</p>

Somehow people around the league still think he&rsquo;s this 2 way dawg. Murray is incredibly skilled but his game is literally all flash and no grit. He would rather score 40 in a loss than 15 in a win. This guy could easily be an elite playmaker if he stopped chucking from midrange (a souped up terry rozier imo).</p>

      <label for="lt1c2zg" class="commentText"><p>I really think that the best way to use him would be in a Lou Williams-type role &ndash; an instant offense, sixth man on a contending team. He is very very good at creating and knocking down shots for himself, except that most of them are inefficient midrangers so you can&rsquo;t really build an offense around it, and he can&rsquo;t get all the way to the rim so he doesn&rsquo;t really draw any FTs. The second apron era may mean that you can&rsquo;t really pay anybody to be in that super sixth man role anymore but it feels like that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;d be best at.</p>

      <label for="lt0wrsx" class="commentText"><p>I thought it would work for them because teams were keying on Trae without punishment, but with Dejounte, you would have both a weapon to kill 4 on 3s (after Trae is trapped) and, for other situations, a ball handler you had to respect while also watching Trae run through screens around the court like curry. Then on the defensive end, you are putting Trae next to a long, plus defender.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Trae wasn’t really running around like that and Dejounte wasn’t the defender I thought he would be. I think both guys just didn’t feel the same energy without the ball. I really don’t blame them for trying.</p>

<p>And now that it’s over, I don’t think they are in a bad spot either. Very real possibility that a Trae Dyson Risacher JJ and Clint lineup feasts on some unsuspecting teams. Bogi + Hunter (with health) + OO would fill out a decent playoff rotation and they have some regular season depth on top of that. Not a bad team at all and could be spooky if certain guys develop.</p>

      <label for="lt13u55" class="commentText"><p>The best breakdown here imo</p>

<p>It wasn’t just a clear bad fit, it was a shot at unlocking traes offball shooting. Which is a skill all of its own, which curry doesn’t get enough credit for. Not only the you know, making the catch and shoot shots, but the nfl wide receiver iq, to know at what speed/timing, to wrap around this screen, or sit in this crease between zones. That off ball gravity (similar to jj reddick) can drive an offense. Unfortunately that’s not traes game and he didn’t develop it either</p>

      <label for="lt1ccpu" class="commentText"><p>Yup. This is my biggest issues with Booker as a suns fan, he’s a lethal shooter, yet too often without the ball he’s planted in the corner or making one hard curl around one screen, not getting the pass and then fading away from the play. (Unless he’s needed for a shot clock dwindling tough off the dribble pull up jumper)</p>

<p>The amount of running, cutting and hair trigger catch and shoot opportunities guys like Allen and curry have done is legendary. They earned themselves good looks (for them), with skills that were forged through practice.</p>

<p>Off ball movement shooting is just such a learned skill imo, and it’s not often a smooth transition for a ball dominant shooter</p>

<p>Now. Not everyone can run their man into the ground for 40mpg like Steph and Rip Hamilton, there are some shades of grey between &ldquo;energizer bunny&rdquo; and &ldquo;do absolutely nothing&rdquo;, but I see almost entirely the latter watching NBA ball. Movement is for role-playing scrubs.</p>

<p>The Hawks were a bottom 4 defense with Trae and DJM guarding the perimeter. Not sure how CJ and DJM is supposed to fare much better, especially without a center in the mix. It&rsquo;s not like Zion or BI are super locked in defensively most nights either.</p>

<p>I understand Trey Murphy and Herb Jones exist, but surely they can&rsquo;t do it all on their own. Especially if they are asked to play out of position to make up for the weird roster construction this year.</p>

The attitude though, he was always owed more in his mind, and was pissy about it. He was mad at Tony fucking Parker for wanting to play instead of being blessed by the opportunity to give his starting spot to a less deserving player for development. Lol</p>

Honestly when he was on he was a ton of fun to watch, and at the moment our team is really stoked about everything we got from the pels for him so no worries from me.</p>

Never getting close that one year again.</p>

<p>His volume is down but he is taking better shots and making them at a higher rate.</p>

<p>If it continues into this season, there will be enough sample size to support he wasn’t utilised the best on the Knicks.</p>

      <label for="lt0t68j" class="commentText"><p>Melo and A’mare come to mind as well. I heard RJ was going off with Toronto, was he finally the 2 again? He has a bully and 3 game and it works best against similar sized Players or smaller not the Small Forwards. If they played him at the 2 he would’ve been worth keeping. If they’re just gonna keep shuffling in useless shooters like Grimes at the 2 and put him at the 3, the Trade was a no-brainer. That Gay-DeRozan-Ross-Lowry Team was nasty on 2k though.</p>

<p>Edit: to the Dejounte defenders down here, you&rsquo;ll soon discover that he is the problem &amp; he isn&rsquo;t who he thinks he is. We&rsquo;ll see how will do with 3 other players that need the ball in their hands just like Trae</p>

And he did, and I’m glad because thus far Landry has played the margins and made value extensions in ways that Travis absolutely did not. Went from selling 2nds to spending money to move up a few spots and having an open roster slot and Frank Kaminsky to filling out our 2-way deals and end of the bench spots with NBA-ready players and  legitimate fliers. Went from horrific John Collin’s and Hunter contracts to getting discounts on DJ, Onyeka, Bogi, and robbing Vit.</p>

<p>Landry hasn’t done a lot to wow, tho I do like the package back for DJ, but he’s been super solid imo.</p>

<p>He may not have run to Windhorst or somebody like that to complain in person, but he certainly let it be known that he was unhappy in his role here. Lotsa cryptic social media bitching, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and still making improvements to his game</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the part he&rsquo;s angry about! Being in the corner and on the wings next to Trae got him tons of wide open catch and shoot 3s, so his shooting percentage went way up! But somehow he&rsquo;s pissed about it.</p>

It&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s not talented. ATL and SA fans know this which is where the frustration comes from.</p>

<p>Imagine Curry complaining when Steve Kerr took over and instituted the triangle offense and took the ball out of Curry&rsquo;s hands. Steph in the prior season was the best pnr ball handler in the NBA. Majority of his usage came on pnr action. But because he didn&rsquo;t complain and elevated other parts of his game all his teammates improved and that led to championships and people taking discounts to come join him.</p>

<p>So basically he&rsquo;s saying that he thinks his &ldquo;real position&rdquo; is being the full time heliocentric guy given that he was top 10 in possession in his last year with the Spurs lol</p>

Then the coaches refused to create a system when they could work effectively. It’s either iso ball or drive and kick. No motions, off ball screen action, nothing. When is the last time 2 PGs lead a championship team? You could see it from a mile away.</p>

      <label for="lt1v0k2" class="commentText"><p>Hawks took the kind of swing I think they should&rsquo;ve made and it just didn&rsquo;t work. People landed on both sides in whether they thought it could. It didn&rsquo;t and the Hawks moved on and did so in a way where they landed some decent assets in return.</p>

<p>Hawks fans should appreciate their FO recognizing that the team wasn&rsquo;t going anywhere with DeJounte and the poor fit and not trying to force it to work but instead cutting their losses now and getting a decent return back for him. They&rsquo;re in a decent spot now and in the future as a result.</p>

<p>As for DeJounte, definitely interested to see how much he impacts Zion and BI and the Pels offense.</p>
