<p>The change is good for both Murray and the Hawks. Trae&rsquo;s #2 should be a wing or a big and Murray should be in a place where he can be the primary PG.</p>

<p>Lol this sounds familiar. Check out the bio of Miami Heat CEO Nick Arison (son of owner Micky Arison). I expect he&rsquo;ll get roster control once Pat <del>Biden</del> Riley finally retires</p>

I am kinda baffled by Nick Arison defenders existing though lmao the front office shilling of some Heat fans on reddit knows no bounds</p>

<p>He started as an attendant probably in his teens in the late 90s; kept getting promoted probably after college and has been CEO for the last 13 years. IDC how good someone is at their job, you don&rsquo;t move up that quickly, that high. It&rsquo;s nepotism, but it&rsquo;s fine. Most of us would do the same for our kids if they wanted to be in the family business.</p>

<p>Also, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a move out there that has been attributed to his son. In fact, I&rsquo;m pretty sure Spo has more say in what goes on and there&rsquo;s a belief among Heat beatwriters and fans that he will take over Riley&rsquo;s job when Riley&rsquo;s no longer with the Heat.</p>

      <label for="lt1wdzb" class="commentText"><p>HAwks fans are full-on conspiracy theorists when it comes to Ressler.  His son is obviously a nepo hire and not necessarily earning his promotions, but he&rsquo;s also not a key decision maker, at all.  He&rsquo;s a fly on the wall, learning the ropes, as others have said.</p>

<p>For anyone paying attention, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious that Ressler is the final decision maker (all owners are ofc), but also that he has a lot of respect for Quin Snyder and Landry&rsquo;s vision for the team&ndash; a long term plan for sustained success, which they have been executing on for 2 years now.  Most fans can&rsquo;t look past the next season with regards to decision making so there are a lot of really shitty arm chair takes that have taken over our sub and the Hawks-social-media-verse.</p>

<p>To add more to that, in my opinion, Ressler is itching to go into the tax to contend, but there has not been an opportunity that makes sense to do so.  Our ECF run was on the back of the most expensive bench in the NBA (that decimated Phillys bench units) because our starters were on rookie deals.  So people act like he avoids the tax at all costs because they want to blow through the second apron to retain john f*cking collins or kevin heurter, but in reality, we just don&rsquo;t have a core that is worth starting a tax timer on.  Thank god we did not start our tax timer to pay for mediocre bench depth or we&rsquo;d be in a materially worse position than we are now.</p>

<p>people were pessimistic about Harden/CP too (i obviously understand they&rsquo;re insane talents) and then they won 65 games and were like a 70 win pace when healthy</p>

<p>i think they probably thought lets get talent, we can maybe get to 50-52 wins</p>

      <label for="lt0zk9r" class="commentText"><p>that was people being stupid and blinded though. Kyrie Irving has shown elite off ball play his entire career but he was public enemy number 1 (warranted to an extent of course) and it had people wanting him to fail.</p>

<p>Murray was never a great shooter and on ball playmaking is his biggest strength offensively. Kyrie Irving is a 40% 3 point shooter with experience playing with ball dominant players.</p>

<p>EDIT: if you’re speaking defensively, I can understand your point more though. Dont think people could have predicted us building that strong of a defense around those two.</p>

      <label for="lt1625r" class="commentText"><p>Yeah your edit covered it, my doubt about Kyrie (outside of injury issues and if he&rsquo;d actually play) was defense. Having one below average defender on the starting lineup is tough but manageable. Two is way tougher to deal with if the other 3 guys aren&rsquo;t all elite. I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing how you all handle the Kyrie, Luka, Klay lineup. I&rsquo;m imagining a barrage of scoring, defense be damned lol</p>

      <label for="lt1931k" class="commentText"><p>Honestly I think people underrate Kyrie defensively. He&rsquo;s perfectly decent against guys of his own size. Obviously in matchups like against yall it becomes a problem, but then again in that type of matchup Klay becomes less of a liability since he&rsquo;s still solid against strength based guys. Bit of a give and take that makes it a bit more managable.</p>

<p>End of the day, defense is also largely a team thing and our guys and coaching staff have shown the ability to cover for each other and build a strong scheme. We also always have the option to just put Naji Marshall or Quentin Grimes in and keep a similar defensive profile as last year.</p>

<p>Kidd also talked about building chemistry with Grimes and Klay. I think he definitely will eventually aim to do a good job with staggering the 3 guys minutes well to maximize the defense (though im fully prepared for extremely frustrating trial periods through the regular season)</p>

      <label for="lt1v5eo" class="commentText"><p>but of course even with that… kyrie is the same size as brunson, and luka/brunson was the guard duo for dallas in their elite defense 2022 run</p>

<p>i think kyrie’s been a better defender than brunson so far but even if he wasn’t, the right guys can still make that defense work real well.</p>

<p>as for klay, dallas has this strange advantage with luka where yea he’s slow and best put on a wing, but that means you can play a smaller 3 and then play klay at the 4, if your 3 can hold up against quicker 1-3s at PoA youre golden. kai on the other guard, luka on the worse of the wings, klay on the better wing (hope they’re not fast, if they are u gotta bring out naji).</p>

<p>it can work against certain match ups for sure. boston is still gonna pick them apart.</p>

      <label for="lt22f8z" class="commentText"><p>Oh yeah I obviously have a biased perspective as a Boston fan. It seems to me like teams are getting bigger in general with longer wings and bigger guards which will be tough on smaller guards like Kyrie. Kyrie and Luka are so good on the other end that it could end up being a moot point especially with Lively and PJ only getting better. Kyrie&rsquo;s so dang fast he could just end up tiring out your guys anyway. Ant was exhausted in the WCF trying to keep up with him.</p>

<p>All the talk was about getting a second facilitator to basically never allow that to happen again. But honestly that’s what you need a Jalen Johnson type for not a Murray</p>

      <label for="lt15n8c" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I think the logic behind the Murray trade was fine in theory, but it didn&rsquo;t work because 1) neither he nor Trae were able to work off-ball with each other, 2) his defense was nowhere near what his reputation was, and 3) we overpaid like crazy to get him. If only one of those happens you deal with it, but with all three happening you get what the past two seasons have been.</p>

<p>On here at least, you&rsquo;re just completely off. The idea in theory was fine. Two primary ball handlers is fine. Helps give Trae a break and makes up for his lack of defence. Murray just wasn&rsquo;t good enough and Trae probably could&rsquo;ve done more off ball too.</p>

<p>Are biggest needs were perimeter defense and someone to run the floor when Trae sits and “in theory” Dejounte filled both of those needs.</p>

Many thought it was a slight overpay but most thought that putting someone who could defend and handle the ball next to Trae would be an improvement. The thing people were worried about was DJ’s shooting and that ended up not being bad. He just immediately turned into a negative defender and he his PG skills weren’t very impressive. Granted we didn’t have the best options to pass to.</p>

      <label for="lt144hq" class="commentText"><p>As am I. I think history will show they got more back for DJ than they gave up. A swap that won’t convey, 2 first round picks somewhere from 12-18, and a fake first round pick from Charlotte that will likely be 2 seconds.</p>

<p>In return they got #8 overall Dyson Daniels who is a  stud wing defender and decent facilitator, a possible lottery pick in 25’s loaded draft via the lakers, and a ‘27 FRP that will be ~25, along with Larry Nance Jr who is honestly the perfect fit for our frontcourt.</p>

<p>Not upset at all about the outcome so far. They took a swing and missed. Not going to fault them for trying. This way we get to avoid tanking and still have a chance to hit the lottery for a second year in a row if the Lakers stars are injured (would never hope for this, but it is what it is).</p>

      <label for="lt12btk" class="commentText"><p>I think the hope and dream was that Trae could use his shooting gravity to open up the offense more off ball, and Murray could accentuate that even more off drive and kicks. Then when Trae was the ball Murray could still shoot or cut. Murray’s defense was supposed to help out too.</p>

<p>But yeah bringing in another ball handler to a helio centric ball dominant pg is extremely extremely hit or miss. Kyrie/luka make it work because, they’re both cerebral, Kyries lethal off ball (movement too) and of course Luka is 6’7 250 or whatever</p>

Like just based off vibes Dejounte is like one of my favorite players ever. I haven’t watched that many games live but every time he’s been easily the bucket on the floor. I got to see Harden once and same thing he hit 6 threes even tho that’s obviously atypical (also against the hawks). I think it’s why old heads overrate shit cuz you only have memory of it and when you see someone just getting 7-8 straight buckets they really look like one of the greatest</p>

Somehow people around the league still think he&rsquo;s this 2 way dawg. Murray is incredibly skilled but his game is literally all flash and no grit. He would rather score 40 in a loss than 15 in a win. This guy could easily be an elite playmaker if he stopped chucking from midrange (a souped up terry rozier imo).</p>

      <label for="lt1c2zg" class="commentText"><p>I really think that the best way to use him would be in a Lou Williams-type role &ndash; an instant offense, sixth man on a contending team. He is very very good at creating and knocking down shots for himself, except that most of them are inefficient midrangers so you can&rsquo;t really build an offense around it, and he can&rsquo;t get all the way to the rim so he doesn&rsquo;t really draw any FTs. The second apron era may mean that you can&rsquo;t really pay anybody to be in that super sixth man role anymore but it feels like that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;d be best at.</p>

      <label for="lt0wrsx" class="commentText"><p>I thought it would work for them because teams were keying on Trae without punishment, but with Dejounte, you would have both a weapon to kill 4 on 3s (after Trae is trapped) and, for other situations, a ball handler you had to respect while also watching Trae run through screens around the court like curry. Then on the defensive end, you are putting Trae next to a long, plus defender.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Trae wasn’t really running around like that and Dejounte wasn’t the defender I thought he would be. I think both guys just didn’t feel the same energy without the ball. I really don’t blame them for trying.</p>

<p>And now that it’s over, I don’t think they are in a bad spot either. Very real possibility that a Trae Dyson Risacher JJ and Clint lineup feasts on some unsuspecting teams. Bogi + Hunter (with health) + OO would fill out a decent playoff rotation and they have some regular season depth on top of that. Not a bad team at all and could be spooky if certain guys develop.</p>

      <label for="lt13u55" class="commentText"><p>The best breakdown here imo</p>

<p>It wasn’t just a clear bad fit, it was a shot at unlocking traes offball shooting. Which is a skill all of its own, which curry doesn’t get enough credit for. Not only the you know, making the catch and shoot shots, but the nfl wide receiver iq, to know at what speed/timing, to wrap around this screen, or sit in this crease between zones. That off ball gravity (similar to jj reddick) can drive an offense. Unfortunately that’s not traes game and he didn’t develop it either</p>

      <label for="lt1ccpu" class="commentText"><p>Yup. This is my biggest issues with Booker as a suns fan, he’s a lethal shooter, yet too often without the ball he’s planted in the corner or making one hard curl around one screen, not getting the pass and then fading away from the play. (Unless he’s needed for a shot clock dwindling tough off the dribble pull up jumper)</p>

<p>The amount of running, cutting and hair trigger catch and shoot opportunities guys like Allen and curry have done is legendary. They earned themselves good looks (for them), with skills that were forged through practice.</p>

<p>Off ball movement shooting is just such a learned skill imo, and it’s not often a smooth transition for a ball dominant shooter</p>

      <label for="lt23byp" class="commentText"><p>Here&rsquo;s the bigger question. How does New Orleans maintain their defensive identify this year with DJM in and Dyson Daniels + Larry Nance Jr out?</p>

<p>The Hawks were a bottom 4 defense with Trae and DJM guarding the perimeter. Not sure how CJ and DJM is supposed to fare much better, especially without a center in the mix. It&rsquo;s not like Zion or BI are super locked in defensively most nights either.</p>

<p>I understand Trey Murphy and Herb Jones exist, but surely they can&rsquo;t do it all on their own. Especially if they are asked to play out of position to make up for the weird roster construction this year.</p>

      <label for="lt17klf" class="commentText"><p>So he can only shoot when he has a mismatch? Sounds ideal but that doesn’t make him a great shooter. It seems like other teams also figured out how to defend his shot better and thus is ranges dropped.</p>

<p>Also RJ definitely played the 2 in 2023 in a lot of those games. His inability to hit open/semi open outside/corner shots is a big reason why we traded him for OG.</p>

      <label for="lt10t5s" class="commentText"><p>RJ&rsquo;s entire Knicks career was totally shafted either by injury (more specifically, illness) or a big player either getting injured or coming back from injury. When he played and when the team was on a healthy stretch he looks/looked absolutely awesome. Virtually every consistent, &ldquo;normal&rdquo; stretch of pro basketball he&rsquo;s played has been at or near high quality for his age/development. But people saw the missed layups after he was coming back from a horrible flu spell and a bad breakup and took it as gospel that he was trash.</p>

      <label for="lt0t68j" class="commentText"><p>Melo and A’mare come to mind as well. I heard RJ was going off with Toronto, was he finally the 2 again? He has a bully and 3 game and it works best against similar sized Players or smaller not the Small Forwards. If they played him at the 2 he would’ve been worth keeping. If they’re just gonna keep shuffling in useless shooters like Grimes at the 2 and put him at the 3, the Trade was a no-brainer. That Gay-DeRozan-Ross-Lowry Team was nasty on 2k though.</p>

<p>Edit: to the Dejounte defenders down here, you&rsquo;ll soon discover that he is the problem &amp; he isn&rsquo;t who he thinks he is. We&rsquo;ll see how will do with 3 other players that need the ball in their hands just like Trae</p>

<p>He may not have run to Windhorst or somebody like that to complain in person, but he certainly let it be known that he was unhappy in his role here. Lotsa cryptic social media bitching, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and still making improvements to his game</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s the part he&rsquo;s angry about! Being in the corner and on the wings next to Trae got him tons of wide open catch and shoot 3s, so his shooting percentage went way up! But somehow he&rsquo;s pissed about it.</p>

      <label for="lt1a1up" class="commentText"><p>Facts if he just accepted his role and didn&rsquo;t complain like has in the past time and time again whenever things don&rsquo;t go his way no one would be second guessing him. It&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s not talented. ATL and SA fans know this which is where the frustration comes from.</p>

<p>Imagine Curry complaining when Steve Kerr took over and instituted the triangle offense and took the ball out of Curry&rsquo;s hands. Steph in the prior season was the best pnr ball handler in the NBA. Majority of his usage came on pnr action. But because he didn&rsquo;t complain and elevated other parts of his game all his teammates improved and that led to championships and people taking discounts to come join him.</p>

      <label for="lt0zczh" class="commentText"><p>The average 3 point percentage stat is a bit misleading because it doesn’t account for volume, the value of shot-creation and just how guarded/contested those shots are. A player like Deandre Hunter shooting 38% from 3 is not the same as someone like Luka shooting 38% from three.</p>

<p>They have the same percentages but no rational person will ever argue that Hunter is a better 3pt shooter than Luka. Dejounte shooting that percentage from 3, and on that volume and degree of difficulty, especially since a lot were generated off the dribble rather than off catch-and-shoot scenarios, which are generally easier, more open shots, suggests he is a good 3pt shooter.</p>

      <label for="lt0ygj9" class="commentText"><p>36.3% from 3 is still a spacing and solid efficiency, but the volume is the most important part lmfao. Volume corresponds to defensive respect more than efficiency and he gets up 7+ threes that&rsquo;s really good.</p>

<p>Dejounte continually commands contests and forces defense to respect his shot which is the entire point, he opens up space on the floor and knocks down threes at a respectable clip and volume.</p>

When is the last time 2 PGs lead a championship team? You could see it from a mile away.</p>

People landed on both sides in whether they thought it could. It didn&rsquo;t and the Hawks moved on and did so in a way where they landed some decent assets in return.</p>

<p>Hawks fans should appreciate their FO recognizing that the team wasn&rsquo;t going anywhere with DeJounte and the poor fit and not trying to force it to work but instead cutting their losses now and getting a decent return back for him. They&rsquo;re in a decent spot now and in the future as a result.</p>

<p>As for DeJounte, definitely interested to see how much he impacts Zion and BI and the Pels offense.</p>

<p>The Hawks played at a 41 win pace in games with DJM but without Trae, a sizable improvement over the 33 win pace when Trae did play. This isn&rsquo;t shade at Trae Young, just highlighting how good DJM was when the two weren&rsquo;t forced to play together</p>
