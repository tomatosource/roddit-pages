</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Question is inspired by the latest Thinking basketball episode. In the episode Ben and Cody were trying to &lsquo;poke holes&rsquo; in to their takes about trying to see if they would change their stance.</p>

<p>I thought it was pretty interesting so I want to ask you if you have something about NBA that you believe so much that nothing could change your stance on it. It could be about player or specific rule or anything you want as long as it&rsquo;s connected to NBA.</p>

      <label for="lrqrvzv" class="commentText"><p>Adam Silver has sullied the sport by adding ads to jerseys, the court, and everywhere else and by selling out to gambling interests. I don’t care how much more money the league (ie owners and players) are making, it has legitimately degraded the experience of being a fan.</p>

<p>And we will probably never be able to put the genie back in the  bottle.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t miss hard liquor ads either. They&rsquo;re all boring, every single one of em. Beer ads are at least sometimes entertaining. There&rsquo;s never been a hard liquor ad as good as the Budweiser frogs or the &ldquo;Wassssup&rdquo; guys or &ldquo;Tastes great, less filling.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lrruvxd" class="commentText"><p>Part of this is also caused by the huge turnover and constant player movement. The Mavs and Suns were turning into a real rivalry for a second there with bad blood leading up to the Mavs upset.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s no real way to sustain that when basically both teams have turned over their entire rosters outside of their two superstars. Kevin Durant does not give a fuck about Luka talking trash in the 2022 playoffs, vice versa for Kyrie.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s just one example from 2 years ago.</p>

The entire presentation always felt professional and true to the sport. The coaches were always well dressed, and the uniforms and courts wefe beautiful, iconic and cohesive. Now it&rsquo;s an absolute joke - ads fucking everywhere and gambling in your face at all times. Teams changing jerseys every game so that teams barely have an identity anymore.</p>

      <label for="lrr3xo0" class="commentText"><p>Nah, that&rsquo;s the cop out.</p>

<p>We have issues with corruption in soccer over here in Europe, we have literal governments owning sports teams, it&rsquo;s a massive issue but the corruption is all behind the scenes. At least the game doesn&rsquo;t suffer and when they make shitty decisions the fans make it extremely uncomfortable for the owners.</p>

<p>People show up and protest en masse. Imagine what 100 fans who rallied together could do in the NBA? Protest gambling or protest the amount of commercials, whatever is ruining the sport. Bring some signs and make things a little uncomfortable, but nobody ever does it. People are always happy little corporate fans in the US. If you showed up to games protesting a bit for something you cared about it would make the news big time.</p>

<p>A lot of people in the US talk about how the sport is growing by how much more money the league is making. The reason it&rsquo;s growing is because the league is selling out to whatever new thing they can squeeze a buck out of, not because the sport is in a healthy place in the long run. The viewer experience is so much worse now with all the commercials. You got straight from 2 mins of SAS to commercials to tipoff, no more player intros like we had pre 2016.</p>

<p>You are so controlled the corporations but you don&rsquo;t see it. We are too, but not to nearly the same extent.</p>

      <label for="lrr5uv4" class="commentText"><p>There&rsquo;s traditionally more advanced democracies i.e. Germany and Sweden (I presume) and there there&rsquo;s England and Spain, whose soccer scene is equally infested with betting.</p>

<p>A cultural difference is worth pointing out that watching soccer is traditionally a working class entertainment for the European. You cheer for your local team like a religion and your literal life depend on it. In North America, going to a sports game is more associated with middle-class concepts like &ldquo;bringing the whole family&rdquo;, &ldquo;driving downtown&rdquo;, &ldquo;fast foods and beers for the whole match&rdquo;. Ultimately, people just don&rsquo;t give merely the same level of shit about the sports, it&rsquo;s not a religion, not a lifestyle, merely a pasttime and an entertainment.</p>

      <label for="lrqwedw" class="commentText"><p>I mean, the screen is 2D. So how do you know the ball they&rsquo;re playing with ain&rsquo;t flat?</p>

<p>Have you ever seen more than one side of the ball? On the screen?</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t think so&hellip;</p>

<p>PS: I know what you&rsquo;re gonna say.<br>
But the multiple camera angles are a scheme from the system to make you believe it is not flat.<br>
It&rsquo;s replay + CGI + using multiple balls to reproduce the same action after the fact, making you think it&rsquo;s live.<br>
The crowd is just CGI + paid actors.<br>
People saying they went to a live game are in on it or they are bots online.<br>
And if you did go to a game, it was a fake game with round balls to make you believe that&rsquo;s what they actually play with in the real games.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re <em>their</em> puppet defending <em>them</em>.</p>

      <label for="lrry4ma" class="commentText"><p>Sure, it just depends on how “fair” or “realistic” you want your comparaison to be.</p>

<p>Scientists try to measure/prove/demonstrate their hypothesis by comparing things “everything else being equal”.</p>

<p>That’s the premise for any scientific experiment, article,study, and everything that can create a bias in measurement, will be talked about by the people doing the study, and the ones reading/validating it.</p>

<p>Of course we absolutely cannot do that in the real world, which isn&rsquo;t a vacuum, with controlled conditions to compare the data, so we compare anyway because it&rsquo;s fun.</p>

<p>But technically, it&rsquo;s not really a receivable analysis from a scientific stand point.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all subjective perspectives, biased opinions, and what we personally value when making these opinions.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s okay. It&rsquo;s fun.</p>

      <label for="lrrnbsn" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s easier to dominate when there is less competition. The NBA talent pool has to be at least 2 or 3 times larger these days compared to the 60s. Even compared to the 90s, it&rsquo;s going to be like 50% larger when you factor in world population and how basketball has grown as a sport.</p>

<p>The milkmen/plumbers thing is an exaggeration, but it has real merit. You can say a dude was ahead of their time based on relative stats, but it wouldn&rsquo;t put them at the same level as a modern player that was similar. Like the people saying Stockton or IT are better players than CP3 are crazy.</p>

They get way more rest, better conditions, they are taught how to work on their bodies even in highschool, and spend millions on trainers, rmts, cryovac machines, etc etc.   Rules have changed, spacing has changed, physicality had changed.</p>

<p>If Bird had access to all this tech, coaching and body preservation I have 0 doubt in my mind he would be an mvp level candidate if he played today.  So it definitely goes both ways.</p>

      <label for="lrsfpud" class="commentText"><p>This argument has a lot of merit from a straight population size standpoint. Just like the very best player at a small high school is likely not as impressive as the best player at a regional high school with 5000 students, especially if they are just both marginally better than the second best player. If the small high school player is several standard deviations better than their next best player, then the comparison is more interesting</p>

<p>The killer is now it isn&rsquo;t that the Refs need to &ldquo;cheat&rdquo; to make someone win for them to sway games for Vegas. If you have Embiid over as a bet that the refs wanna influence, just hit his primary defenders with some ticky tacky fouls early in the game. Alternatively if you wanna force the under, give him 2 ticky tacky fouls early in the game. It&rsquo;s not that the refs picked a winner, just changed how the game has been played.</p>

<p>I know it&rsquo;s tinfoil hat-y but the NBA being paid by the betting websites draws questions into if gambling has influence on how the games are controlled.</p>

<p>And Vegas doesn’t care one way or another, they make bank no matter what over the long run. They’re heavily invested in the games not being fixed, nothing would hurt their wallet more than people losing faith in the legitimacy of the league.</p>

<p>I’m not saying it’ll never happen, but the NBA’s largest gambling scandal happened when it was illegal. If you’re already the person to fix games, the fact that books are legal now doesn’t help you at all, it even makes it easier to monitor.</p>

      <label for="lrshkwz" class="commentText"><p>What you’re referencing is when he says “the NBA’s largest gambling scandal happened when it was illegal”, assuming you’re talking about the 2002 WCF and not trying to say that Jordan’s dad was murdered over his gambling debts and him going to play baseball was to cover that up, which I think is absolutely ridiculous</p>

      <label for="lrqvn5t" class="commentText"><p>Sports betting has been an integral part of European soccer for ages now. But the problem with NBA is, it&rsquo;s far too easy for refs to fix any game. In soccer, the game-swaying calls (red cards, penalties, offsides) are under heavy scrutiny, doesn&rsquo;t happen very often, and have <strong>very, very clear</strong> rules regarding to them. There&rsquo;s simply too many <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> calls in basketball, and a bad ref simply need to award several <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> to the same team to completely turn a game around, without technically making any &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo;.</p>

Online gambling has existed since the 90s. You were immediately able to bet on your phone the second you could get internet access on your phone. You used to have the option of calling in too.</p>

<p>Legal sportsbook arnt in the business of fixing gams. In fact, their betting data is used to identify refs/players who are individually doing it.</p>

Their business model isn’t to create one sided bets and live off a large sample that wipes away variance. Their business model is to set the lines to hedge both sides of a bet to win no matter what the outcome is.</p>

Gotta keep the score close so people don’t tune out the last 5 minutes! I know this is a bit tinfoily - but did the NBA set a record for “clutch” games last season? Sure felt like it.</p>

      <label for="lrr39ym" class="commentText"><p>People try to diminish players legacies based on how they feel about them and are often biased. Case in point, I’m gonna talk about two players who played in the same era:</p>

<p>Dwight Howard was the best center from 2008 to 2012-2013ish. Did he have flaws in his game? Yes he did, but he was a dominant rebounder and interior defender who was still able to provide some offense, and that shouldn’t go unnoticed. But here’s what I hear about him when people discuss him:</p>

<p>“He was only able to dominate because he barely had any competition at the center position”</p>

<p>But then u also have Yao Ming who was drafted two years before Dwight. Since they were drafted only two years apart, he would’ve faced the same competition that Dwight faced. But since he’s beloved (and rightfully so), if he had a fully healthy career and he was the best center during the time that Dwight played, I guarantee that people would say:</p>

<p>“Man, Yao was so great that he was able to be the best center of his era, and was a level above any other center”</p>

      <label for="lrs0u6a" class="commentText"><p>We as fans and NBA media are horrible “storytellers” compared to where we used to be and it makes it more difficult to understand and appreciate how much talent is in front of us. Thinking of how much more loved some people would’ve been if they’d just played in the 80s/90s is mind blowing to me.</p>

<p>Zach Lavine &amp; Aaron Gordon would’ve had commercials jumping over the moon</p>

<p>D. Mitchell would’ve been in actual Spider-Man movie</p>

<p>Paola Banchero &amp; Tyler Herro would’ve been on late night TV shows discussing living in Florida as teenaged millionaires</p>

<p>So much better marketing and general reverence instead of this “glazing” culture we’ve built up around showing appreciation of people excelling at something we love</p>

The league is wealthy AF but I can definitely say my enjoyment of the sport has decreased especially when it comes to the live experience. I&rsquo;ve gotten into watching live soccer lately and one of the biggest reasons(aside from enjoying the sport) is not having an ad break every time there is a stoppage. Basketball is my favorite sport and it sucks that I hate watching the live product more than some other sports that I don&rsquo;t have the same connection to. You may argue that it&rsquo;s the broadcasters fault but at the end of the day, within the context of the NBA, the buck stops with Adam silver</p>

<p>NBA teams are mainly driven by the best player on their team but also need complimentary role players to raise the ceiling of the team.</p>

<p>NFL has kinda shown as long as you have a very solid defense and an elite QB, you can win. The Patriots has two dynasty’s built off strong/effective defenses and Tom Brady throwing to a bunch of white guys. (Yeah, I’m erasing Gronk, Moss, etc… but the back half of Brady’s Patriot career he had some lack luster offenses outside of Gronk and they were still elite because Tom Brady is him).</p>

Like, yeah, you can criticize LeBron for jumping ship for greener pastures, but it&rsquo;s disingenuous to compare it to Jordan. This is kinda why championships are overrated when rating players. Jokic can win mvp for the next 5 years and he&rsquo;s still gonna be stuck with Jamal Murray as his #2 on a max. There&rsquo;s nothing Jokic can do to get out of that beside switching teams. To criticize him for lack of titles as if it was a result of his performance is silly.</p>

<p>I do think that Jordan is the GOAT, but my general basketball opinion is that each generation of players is greater than the last. There&rsquo;s definitely a part of me that thinks there&rsquo;s a genuine argument for LeBron being a better basketball player than Jordan. But Jordan is too iconic with too many big moments and has some crazy ass usage stats to dismiss him.</p>

<p>-Michael Jordan’s competition was watered down. We saw in the Olympics this 2024 team usa faced the most nba players and we saw the results. It was harder competition. Guys like bogi were going off in the Olympics.</p>

<p>-Victor wembanyama is the true golden boy of this subreddit, nba media, and just the nba in general. He’s got top 10 all time ceiling in his cards no doubt but people are at this point silenced for any criticism against him. You literally cannot criticize wemby without getting a ton of flack for it. It seems kinda ridiculous people can’t even accept criticism saying a 7’4 dude shouldn’t take so many jump shots. But that is the reality right now.</p>

<p>-Kobe did not deserve all his defensive awards.</p>

<p>-Steph curry might be just as good as lebron at elevating players on the offensive side of the ball.</p>

<p>-Joel embiid is a little overrated right now. People are saying he might be the best player in the world and I’ve never seen a guy get crowned like that given the amount postseason failures/lack of postseason success. And that’s not even mentioning his injuries. James harden got way more shit than embiid did when James was having these historic scoring seasons but people always focused on his drop in the playoffs. For embiid this seems to be less so.</p>

<p>Like I think Wemby was an excellent defender last year but people have gone beyond overboard. I don’t think he should be the DPOY favorite, I don’t think he should’ve been the DPOY runner up - and that’s solely because I don’t think he’s that level of a defender <em>yet</em>. But what’s even the point since I believe he will be otherworldly in a couple years?</p>

      <label for="lrsovwy" class="commentText"><p>I think everyone is jumping the gun on Wemby. Like, I obviously see the potential, especially defensively, but it seems like we&rsquo;ve basically decided he&rsquo;s going to win DPOY this season without even seeing him play a single minute; I&rsquo;ve also seen wild predictions that the Spurs can win 40+ games this year and make the Play-In. It&rsquo;s that type of stuff that irks me. He had a great, healthy first year, but whether he can remain injury-free at that size and make the jump(s) expected of him is still up in the air. I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s a great comparison, but KAT had an amazing ROTY campaign, seemed to be on a crazy trajectory, played 82 games in back-to-back-to-back seasons, then sort of stagnated and became sneakily injury-prone. It&rsquo;s just hard to live up to the hype he has. He&rsquo;ll probably be great, but the Spurs won&rsquo;t contend for at least a couple more years and GOAT shouldn&rsquo;t really be thrown around with anyone this early on, IMO</p>

<p>The OKC Thunder should have traded Russell Westbrook instead of young James Harden, and had him Kevin Durant as a dynamic duo in their prime for as long as possible.</p>

<p>The best version of NBA basketball is equal parts driving to the basket, dunking the ball, mid range shooting, 3 point shooting, back to the basket low post shooting and having the ability to play hard defense fairly without ticky-tacky unnecessary officiating and defensive fouls called.</p>

      <label for="lrrg81v" class="commentText"><p>Pushing back on your Thunder one- I think it’s a little too easy to look back and say “Harden should’ve been kept over Russ”. Nobody knew how good of a playmaker Harden would become. Nobody expected to to ascend to the MVP level player that he became.</p>

<p>I <strong>DO</strong> agree that Harden and KD probably would’ve been a much more potent duo as Russ’ style doesn’t exactly compliment either player ideally. When Harden and KD played together (healthy) they were an unstoppable scoring duo.</p>

<p>Saying the Thunder should’ve traded Westbrook instead of Harden is like crapping on every other team in the 2013 NBA draft for not taking Giannis. Nobody ever thought it was going to go as perfectly as it did. With hindsight, sure but to retroactively say “oh what a bunch of idiots” is insane.</p>

<p>27.0 pts/11.8 rebs/3.1 ast/.6 stl/2.5 blk/53.3 ft%/57.5 fg%</p>

<p>Postseason Los Angeles Lakers Shaquille:</p>

<p>27.7 pts/13.4 rbs/3.0 ast/.5 stl/2.5 blk/52.0 ft%/55.7 fg%</p>

<p>So you see the difference statistically was Shaquille was much better during the playoffs as a Laker which should be expected with more experience as Shaquille was only 24 years old his first season in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>At some point in time in Los Angeles Shaquille was AT LEAST 100 pounds heavier than he was as a 20 year rookie in Orlando which changed what type of player he became, what type of maximum ceiling he had as player, and greatly limited his versatility, speed, bounce, dexterity, agility, movement, mobility, lift, stamina and endurance.</p>

<p>I truly feel young skinny Shaquille had the talent and ability to possibly become the greatest player of all-time if that was his goal and what he decided to devote his whole life to achieving and becoming, but that is not what he chose to do or what was most important to him.</p>

<p>Shaquille had a wonderful, exciting, varied, challenging and extremely fulfilling life outside of basketball while playing in the NBA and still became an all-time great player, celebrity, icon, and very very successful businessman and entrepreneur.</p>

<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the 3s, it&rsquo;s the other things that lead to 3s that are the problem. Like the dribble penetration off blatant carries, dudes taking multiple steps after catching a ball to go into their shot or start a dribble, moving screens, etc.</p>

<p>He lets everyone in the player union walk over him</p>

      <label for="lrsiwqc" class="commentText"><p>That there needs to be a rules change once playoffs hit to raise the intensity, the stakes, and the unpredictability going into the finals.</p>

<p>That rules change should be:</p>

<ol>
<li>to erase 3 sec defense or extend it to same time rule as the shot clock.</li>
<li>Allowing hand checking either from all players on court, or from the center and PF.</li>
<li>Prohibiting zone defense.</li>
</ol>

<p>These changes will be Strengthening the ability for teams to play defense. In a league that has spent +20 years strengthening offense. Plus it shakes things up. Now that super team or super dominant player led team will have to manage surprises from other teams one play offs begin. Players specializing under current, regular season rules, will have to adjust AND NEW STARS WILL BE BORN IN THE POST SEASON BECAUSE THEY WILL SHINE UNDER THE DIFFERENT RULE SET. Bringing more money in to all markets in the league. As teams make decisions on how to build. Suddenly the bench will matter so much more than they ever have. 2nd string will go from being second string, to being “those are our playoff starters, these are our regular season starters…”</p>

<p>It’ll help answer questions regarding comparisons between different eras.</p>

<p>And then for the finals it can return to regular season rules.</p>

<p>I’ve been closely guarding this for a decade but I think it’s time to share it. I wanted credit in case it ever got implemented.</p>

      <label for="lrswti5" class="commentText"><p>I don’t believe older players should receive special treatment based off of their era for all time rankings. It’s unfair to aid their cases consistently and then also lower current players value by not including how the game has changed. For example, saying LeBron loses a lot in the finals is not a fair comparison when you mention Jordan because Jordan did not play a finals team that was even close to the warriors squad in terms of talent. Stuff like that where it’s clearly cherry picked information to bolster 1 era and degrade the other</p>
