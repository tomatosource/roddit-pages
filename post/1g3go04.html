<p>I’m interested in how many exceptions there have there been to this though.</p>

<p>A historical exceptions that I can think of are as follows:
1998-99 Bulls after the Bulls blew up their team.
2016-17 Cavs since the Warriors added KD.
2019-20 Raptors since Kawhi left and the Lakers and Clippers greatly improved that offseason.</p>

      <label for="lrvulyh" class="commentText"><p>Bucks were not the preseason favorites in 2022-2023. They had worse preseason odds than the warriors did.</p>

<p>They were not even preseason favorites to get out of the East. Bucks fans just have this wierd fantasy in their mind about the second round that year. Just because it goes 7 games doesn’t mean it’s close. If you get pistol whipped 4 times and then win 3 nailbiters, you weren’t a borderline all star away from winning.</p>

<p>Khris Middleton is a low-mid tier all star. He’s not a guy who’s going to turn a series where the bucks are a -8 per 100 (roughly what prime Jordan gives you).</p>

<p>There’s a reason why the bucks had one deep run and it required them to injure the other teams number 3 option and then have the team’s number 2 option have a serious injury: They’ve never been able to defend big shooting wings (still can’t).</p>

<p>The 2022 warriors would have given them a swirlie (though they probably wouldn’t have gotten past Miami or Brooklyn that year in the East anyways).</p>

The Nuggets were still the favorites at the beginning of last season, now they&rsquo;re not even mentioned. I do think Boston has a good chance of repeating though. On paper, they&rsquo;re 1 of the 3 deepest teams in the league. Other 2 teams are Thunder and Timberwolves. On paper, those 3 teams should all be in the conversation.</p>

It&rsquo;s not like the Celtics with Tatum. OKC have basically no playoff experience and are not battle tested, but I understand given their offseason additions fixing most of their issues on paper, good chance they repeat as 1st seed.</p>

<li><p>THJ has been replaced by Klay thompson. Which is massive improvement, anybody who doesn&rsquo;t think that has not watched THJ recently. Even a washed Klay is way better.</p></li>

<li><p>Naji Marshall replaces DJJ introducing significantly more offensive versatillity and replacing most of the defense, if anything he allows us to match up better with both the Thunder and Celtics as he guards like Shai and wings like Tatum better than DJJ can. We will be weaker against guys like Fox, Ja, Ant. But I am not worried about that in the playoffs truth be told.</p></li>

<li><p>Lively going into his sophmore year possibly taking another step once again.</p></li>

<li><p>Mavs were desimated by injuries last year and Luka had to carry for 2 months straight during perhaps the toughest stretch of the schedule. He ended up playing the most games since his rookie year and averaging the most minutes per game in his career. Causing him to go hobbled into the playoffs and they STILL made the finals.</p></li>

<li><p>Nuggets lost KCP, Wolves made a massive change swapping KAT with Julius Randle and Divencenzo. I simply don&rsquo;t see it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As long as the Mavs enter the playoffs healthy, they will make the WCF at minimum.</p>

      <label for="lrvt5ak" class="commentText"><p>I agree with the other replies and would also add DDV was a big addition. He gives them another ball handler and scorer to take pressure off Conley and Ant, he can guard 1 2 very well and some 3 and is a significantly better player than NAW who was kind of in that bench spot. Randle could work nicely in some of their rotations, again giving them another ball handler, but DDV was the get.</p>

If the supporting cast is good enough it won&rsquo;t matter, but given how they are constructed now I don&rsquo;t see them sufficiently covering that.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They replaced DJJ with Naji Marshall. They &ldquo;lost&rdquo; DJJ, not Kawhi, Pippen or Gary Payton. It wasn&rsquo;t until the PJ + Gafford trade that our defense took off. DJJ with PJ off had us +2 better on defense, PJ on DJJ off had us +6 and PJ + DJJ together had us +10 (20 games to end season). It wasn&rsquo;t DJJ anchoring our defense. I am kinda annoyed by the sudden DJJ love, when every team we faced in the playoffs before the series started called him a bum. Now he&rsquo;s suddenly the DPOY. Statistically Naji has been just as good in previous years.</p>

<p>Moreover Jason Kidd managed to make a good playoff defense with Dwight Powell starting at center and a Luka Brunson backcourt in 2022. I&rsquo;m sure having Lively, Gafford anchoring the paint with PJ and Naji as the wing tendem is plenty.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s&hellip; certainly a take.

      <label for="lrw329o" class="commentText"><p>Roughly in order of importance, the pathway for improvement is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Budenholzer gets the Suns to run a modern offense and actually take threes. The Suns were bottom 5 in the NBA in 3PA last season, taking even fewer with only 26 3PA/g during the playoffs. During the preseason the Suns have taken 46 3PA/g, second only to Boston and ~14 more than their average last year.</p></li>

<li><p>The additions of Tyus Jones and Monte Morris keeps the Suns from being a bottom 5 team in TOV% and one of the worst 4th quarter teams in NBA history. Seriously, that&rsquo;s not an exaggeration, the Suns had a net rating of -11.6 in the 4th quarter last year (for context Miami was second worst at -5.5).</p></li>

<li><p>Finding out if Ryan Dunn can be good enough on offense to stay on the floor, because defensively he could be a legitimate difference maker as the type of big wing defender that they did not have on the roster before.</p></li>

<li><p>Miles Plumlee and probably later on Oso Ighodaro being a more serviceable backup big rotation than Drew Eubanks (-4.1 net rating, worst among the Suns regular rotation players in the regular season, which dropped even further to -21.6 in the series against Minnesota).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Still don&rsquo;t think they should be favored over other teams at this point, but I feel good about the Suns being at least a more organized, functional team than last year.</p>

      <label for="lrvv4zm" class="commentText"><p>If they make it back and are healthy who is stopping them? Mavs already proved they don’t match up particularly well and it would be nearly the same matchup for a playoff rotation except replace DJJ with Klay and Josh Green with Grimes. I’m not sure that moves the needle enough to win 4 times.</p>

<p>So that really leaves the Nuggets, Thunder and Wolves.</p>

<p>I don’t think the Wolves have the offense to keep up and with the volume the Celtics shoot 3’s, Gobert just feels like he’s not the right Center in this matchup. It will be like what the Clippers did to the Jazz in 2021 where the space and 3P shot making ability just exposes his limitations.</p>

<p>The Thunder have a good chance to make the finals but are extremely inexperienced and history has shown inexperienced teams usually don’t win it all on their first go. We haven’t really seen if Holmgren, Jalen Williams and Dort are really going to rise to the occasion in that setting.</p>

<p>And the Nuggets are maybe the worst matchup for the Celtics because of their inability to defend Jokic in the post, but the Nuggets just don’t have the depth that it would have to be a huge carry job by their top guys to beat the Celtics depth</p>

<p>Anyone else from the West I think the Celtics are just much better than and don’t have a realistic shot to beat them 4 times.</p>

<p>The likely outcomes I see are if the Celtics make it back to the finals, they’re probably repeating but the Thunder and Nuggets would be their toughest series. If they don’t make it back, I think it’s the West team that is likely taking it.</p>

<p>I’m still pretty unsure about the Knicks, 76ers and Bucks to take down the top teams in the West that it would really depend on the matchup</p>
