      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ds6mpw/fischer_if_george_flees_the_clippers_harden_is/"><p>[Fischer] If George flees the Clippers, Harden is still expected to find his own three year agreement as an avenue to get under the second apron to open access to the $5.2 million tax-payer MLE</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <blockquote>
<p>James Harden <strong>is willing to take one less year on his deal and less than $30 million annually</strong> to allow the Clippers to avoid the second apron and put winning pieces around himself and Kawhi Leonard</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It appears that Harden is once again willing to take a pay cut to help his team fill out their roster regardless of if PG goes or not, marking the <strong>fourth</strong> time in his career that he&rsquo;s almost consecutively either turned down a big contract for a better basketball situation or taken a paycut to help the team.</p>

<p>In 2020, Harden turned down a $103 million 2 year extension, and everyone said it was to take the bag in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>In 2021, Brooklyn offered him a max extension and he turned it down because he was unsure of the long-term viability of that team. Everyone <em>again</em> said it was to get a bigger bag in Philly</p>

<p>In 2022, he took a pay cut to help Philly round out their roster instead of forcing them to give him a bigger contract.</p>

<p>Now in 2024, he&rsquo;s helping the Clippers stay under the second apron to open up the MLE instead of bending them over a barrel like he could.</p>

<p><strong>he&rsquo;s opening their negotiations saying he&rsquo;s willing to take a contract worth less than $90m over 3 years.</strong> whether or not he&rsquo;d be able to get more else where is irrelevant - that is objectively a sacrifice for the clippers.</p>

<p>Kyrie Anti-Vac stuff happened after the Extensions were already offered since the Nets then pulled Kyries 4y/$187m Max Extension.</p>

<p>You sweet summer child. The whole point of the &ldquo;Morey is a liar&rdquo; rant was because the max contract he was allegedly offered to opt into his deal was not offered.
He isn&rsquo;t signing for less money with the clippers to help them&hellip;.it&rsquo;s because that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s available</p>

      <label for="lb0gdxg" class="commentText"><p>that was because he wanted to be there long term. he was pretty clear that he&rsquo;s been trying to find a place to retire. it wasn&rsquo;t about the dollar amount. there were plenty of reports at the time saying he would&rsquo;ve given philly a good deal if morey had replied to him.</p>

<p>u gotta understand that harden and morey were a pair that were in constant communication for over 10 years. then morey decided to just stop replying to him closer to contract time, so harden opted in and knew what was gonna happen.</p>

<p>harden is offering to take less than $30m a year here for only 3 years. he is <strong>absolutely 10000% in position to play hardball to negotiate for a bigger payday than that.</strong> what another team would offer him is completely irrelevant to that. you aren&rsquo;t thinking about it properly.</p>

<p>if it was only ever about the dollar amount, he would&rsquo;ve taken the offers from houston, brooklyn, made philly pay him when he landed, or forced the clippers to pay him more. instead, he&rsquo;s <strong>at the start of any negotiation</strong> offering to take a contract worth less than $90m over 3 years</p>

      <label for="lb0h0fr" class="commentText"><p>that&rsquo;s, again, not the point lmao.</p>

<p>that could be the <strong>start</strong> of his negotiation to get a higher number at the end, regardless of if it&rsquo;s teh full max or not. instead, he&rsquo;s starting his negotiations with telling the front office he&rsquo;s willing to take less than $90m over 3 years.</p>

<p>the same thing he woulda done for morey if morey didn&rsquo;t just start ghosting him for the first time in 10 years btw, which was reported but very much swept under the rug by yall</p>

Not a max necessarily. Which is why him getting a 3 year deal is not a pay cut. It’s the clippers delivering on their promise even though he isn’t worth it anymore.</p>

      <label for="lb09whz" class="commentText"><p>What people? Who was saying the Clippers would have to max Harden? And again which teams would possibly offer him a max right now? He is not in demand as much as you think.  You think he’s taking a pay cut because he’s worth the max but he’s not.</p>

      <label for="lb0aolu" class="commentText"><p>yea lemme just go dig up every single conversation about it that&rsquo;s been had over the last year!</p>

<p>this shits so corny lmao. it was absolutely happening. I&rsquo;m not going to chase around every comment about it. You&rsquo;re just doing that shit where after the fact you pretend it wasn&rsquo;t a thing just to argue something else.</p>

<p>PG isn&rsquo;t worth a max either. that isn&rsquo;t the point. The point is the position the player has the team in. There has been no rumblings of Harden playing hard ball with the Clippers despite him being in position to do so, <em>and</em> despite the narrative the entire time being that he was going to demand (and likely get) a max from ballmer</p>

<p>if u didn&rsquo;t pay attention you didn&rsquo;t pay attention but that&rsquo;s not on me</p>

      <label for="lb0c8cs" class="commentText"><p>Harden can’t play hardball with the Clippers because he doesn’t really have many other options. Which other teams do you really think would offer a max for him? You’re clearly a Harden stan and think he’ll always be worth the max but teams know he isn’t worth that much.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t understand contract negotiations. Harden could absolutely play hardball with the Clippers to squeeze more money out of them. You are delusional if you don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the Cass.</p>

<p>What his value to other teams is irrelevant when the Clippers are in their current situation with PG, Kawhi, and Harden</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think people were being realistic with that.</p>
