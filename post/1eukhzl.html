      <label for="lixp0tf" class="commentText"><p>Mitch Richmond. I played against a lot of Hall of Famers at the #2 spot. Clyde Drexler was a nightmare defensively because he&rsquo;s so fast and athletic, and he can beat you at all three levels. Reggie Miller was a nightmare to chase around and was relentless in his pursuit of the ball. And he had length that he could get off over you.</p>

<p>Mitch was a guy that was so strong and powerful - if he got his back on you and wanted to go in the post, or muscle through you in the paint. He was a load to handle. He was a scoring machine as the #1, #2, #3 option on those teams. I also played against him in my only NCAA Tournament appearance which was my first taste of going against him. Then he became my teammate later in his career, it was a lot better being his teammate than going against him. -Tim Legler</p>

      <label for="liz4zsk" class="commentText"><p>I know I&rsquo;m late to this and you might not respond, but it&rsquo;s so funny that you mentioned this. I was comparing the 92&rsquo; and 96&rsquo; USA teams to one another and I wasn&rsquo;t really familiar with Richmond. Looking up his stats on basketball reference floored me and makes me wonder why more people don&rsquo;t talk about Richmond. I&rsquo;m assuming it&rsquo;s largely due to his teams just not really making a ton of noise and of course, being overshadowed by MJ since they were in the same position.</p>

<p>Seeing his 3pt shooting makes me think Mitch was 20-25 years too early and would have thrived in today&rsquo;s game where he would have the green light to up his career-high 6.4 3pa per game to 8.5-10 (he shot 43.7%, that&rsquo;s outstanding even by today&rsquo;s standards).</p>

<p>Seeing players like this always makes me think what could have been if they played in the modern era (not that he didn&rsquo;t already have a great career, but it feels like he&rsquo;s the 90s version of Joe Johnson in terms of how people remember them - was a menace in their prime, but not really talked about enough now that they&rsquo;re retired).</p>

He ultimately is a guy that has the potential to win multiple championships and MVP&rsquo;s in his career. Where he needs to challenge himself is getting himself into max physical condition. True superstars that set the tone in camp, they&rsquo;re in better shape than anyone there. It builds chemistry in the locker room, that to me is the biggest challenge for him. Everything else he already has. -Tim Legler</p>

      <label for="lixo3pw" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t know if its going to be a surprise but an X-factor in the Western Conference is Memphis. Totally out of the mix last year in a loaded Western Conference, and now you inject Memphis and Ja Morant into the mix. They&rsquo;ll be a team we can be talking a lot about.</p>

<p>In the Eastern Conference, Charlotte is a team that could take a bump. They were banged up a year ago - now year two of Brandon Miller and LaMelo Ball back at the point.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll go with Sacramento last, with the addition of DeMar DeRozan. He brings an element to the wing spot of a guy that can win 1-on-1 matchups and get you quality shots. He&rsquo;s a major upgrade offensively. -Tim Legler</p>

To play against that team knowing that so many people were watching that game in the Philly market. People that I knew well from playing in Philadelphia - staking my claim and living there all those years. Hit the game-winning shot with a second left, down 1, ran some action to throw the ball in the post and I didn&rsquo;t like the look or angle of the pass and put my head down to shoot a floater. -Tim Legler</p>

      <label for="lixpop2" class="commentText"><p>Good question. I just finished my 23rd year at ESPN. It was analytical based when I got into the industry, and we also have this parallel lane going into the debate form. My mentality is a bit different there than when you go on pregame or postgame with analysis to make people smarter. I know I have to shift gears depending on the format and be ready to be a bit more long-winded and back up points on debate shows.</p>

<p>My view is always the same. My goal is to try to tell you something about the game you just watched that is very important that you didn&rsquo;t know, and that will make you smarter the next time you watch. -Tim Legler</p>

      <label for="lixm0wh" class="commentText"><p>East - Boston #1, Knicks #2, 76ers #3, and a battle for #4 between Milwaukee, Indiana, Orlando, Cleveland all in the mix. New York has the slight edge over Philly, and there&rsquo;s a lot to prove in Philly.</p>

<p>West is a lot harder to rank these teams going in. You can make a strong argument for Minnesota being the best in the West, same for Dallas and Denver. Those 3 teams stand out, then Phoenix is in the next tier for me. OKC also a team that is clearly going to be in the mix, and Hartenstein is a massive acquisition for them. Lastly, Sacramento had a great pickup in DeMar DeRozan and his explosiveness as a scorer the isolation. Sacramento is a team that will be really interesting. -Tim Legler</p>

      <label for="lioowkj" class="commentText"><p>How would you compare the G League of today to the CBA when you used to play in it before fully breaking in as a full time NBA player? Are there parts which the CBA does noticeably better that you think the G League should adopt?</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve played with a lot of players who ended up making the jump to coaching. Is there anyone who you could tell right away that would be great at that role when they hung up their laces? Was there anyone that surprised you for not getting into coaching? And was there anyone that surprised you for actually pursuing the vocation post retirement?</p>

<p>Dallas vs. Minnesota that first week on October 29th. That could potentially be a really good rivalry in the west. Luka has that way he plays that could make it a good rivalry. Anthony is a young star wanting to take his team to the promise land. That has the potential to be one of the great rivalries we have in the NBA today.</p>

<p>Any combination of New York, Boston, or Philly this year - it can be really special with any of those two teams matching up against each other. -Tim Legler</p>

<p>I had a really bad knee injury and I just never really recovered from that. I was 33 and I had a lot more years in the style that I played. My knees just wouldn&rsquo;t allow it. The grind of what it takes to keep yourself at that level becomes impossible.</p>

<p>Then I transitioned to playing competitive in men&rsquo;s leagues around Philadelphia. I was MVP in one of those leagues and thought about coming back to the NBA but I didn&rsquo;t pursue it. I played pickup ball for a long time, and then I was coaching my AAU program. I would jump in those workouts and that&rsquo;s how I got my fix. I&rsquo;d pay a lot of money to go play pickup ball for 6 hours one day and be pain free. There&rsquo;s no better workout and there&rsquo;s nothing more fun, and I&rsquo;m just as competitive as I used to be. -Tim Legler.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a level of compettiveness that Michael demonstrated every time he played. The era does matter to me too. It&rsquo;s so impressive that he was able to do what he did in that era with defenses physically designed to stop and impede you. -Tim Legler</p>

<p>Q: Trailing 95-96, with 8 sec left in the game in Game 7. Coach calls a 1-4 flat for your player who catches it at the nail off the inbounds pass. Who do you want with the ball in their hands? (Top 3-5 candidates please)</p>

      <label for="lil26rl" class="commentText"><p>Because of the 3 point revolution and the convergence towards similar offensive play styles, there has been talk here about rule changes. (For example, extending the 3 pt line) But I feel it would be better to incentivize other forms of offense like post-ups rather than disincentivizing 3 pointers.</p>

<p><strong>Tim what are your thoughts on amending the 3 second offensive violation and 5 second back to the basket rules?</strong> Do you think there is any appetite or traction in the league for this change?</p>

      <label for="limhuy3" class="commentText"><p>Tim, there are lots of analysts on TV/social media making content and giving opinions on the plays they see and evaluating teams for their audiences. But I feel a majority of these people offer a cookie-cutter and superficial level of analysis and sometimes dive too deep into analytics when evaluating the quality of a team and don&rsquo;t regard the personnel, coaching, teamwork or fit of a team as they are &ldquo;intangibles&rdquo; on the boxscore.</p>

<p>How have you been able to not only follow the games&rsquo; best teams&rsquo; strategies and idiosyncrasies in specific situations but also in real time catch and call all these intangibles on the court during the chaos of an NBA game. How have you gotten your mind to notice these things, and did it come naturally to you or did you train it after retirement? Thanks.</p>

He’s a relic of the past, but he paid his dues and has a massive following. Personally I would like to hear more of the X’s and O’s talk, but he dumbs it down to I like red cause it’s red or I like green because it’s green. And that’s how most of America digests basketball talk. Just go to your teams sub and read a post. Half of the commentators know the bare minimum of basketball outside of who plays on their team. Steven’s an entertainer. Not an analyst</p>

Love your work on the ALL NBA podcast. Have been a subscriber to listen to you and Adam&rsquo;s NBA thoughts since ep1.</p>

<p>Q: This upcoming season - if the playoffs started today, everyone&rsquo;s healthy, with a blank canvas - who are your top 3 (or top 5 or however many you got) overall picks (in order please) to build your team around for the entirety of the (hopefully 4) playoff series?</p>

      <label for="lin4bwq" class="commentText"><p>What are your thoughts on the NBA adopting some of the FIBA rules? Mainly removing the 3 second restricted area rules, not allowing timeouts when you don&rsquo;t have the ball/during open play and free throws for all non shooting fouls in the 4th quarter. How do you think they would impact the NBA and would that be a positive impact?</p>

<p>By the way, you&rsquo;re easily the best NBA analyst and I really appreciated you believing in the Mavs during the entire season!</p>
