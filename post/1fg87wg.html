</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I am curious to see what Non-Lakers fans think about the Lakers front office deciding to essentially run the same roster back from last season?</p>

<p>The only major changes were as follows:</p>

<p>Firing head coach Darvin Ham and his coaching staff.</p>

<p>Replacing Ham and his coaching staff with JJ Redick as the next head coach and JJ’s new coaching staff that has Nate McMillan, Scott Brooks, Lindsey Harding, Greg St Jean and Beau Lebesque.</p>

<p>Replacing Taurean Prince and Spencer Dinwiddie with two drafted players in Dalton Knecht and
Bronny James.</p>

<p>Extending LeBron James and Max Christie.</p>

<p>D’angelo Russell, Jaxson Hayes, Christian Wood and Cam Reddish opting into their player options to stay on the team for the upcoming season.</p>

<p>I belive the Lakers depth chart will be as below:</p>

<p>PG: D’lo, Gabe, JHS, Bronny
SG: Reaves, Christie, Max Lewis
SF: Rui, Cam Reddish, Dalton Knecht
PF: LeBron, Vanderbilt, Wood
C: AD, Hayes, Wood</p>

<p>I personally think this team is no where near good enough towards being a legit contender. I view us as finishing anywhere between 6-11, with 7th (just at the end of the regular season, not considering play-in games determining seeding), as my predicted spot with this current roster.</p>

<p>I think the Lakers should have made moves over the offseason to try to improve the team, but the front office think the new coaching staff and better health will improve the team to be successful throughout the regular season.</p>

<p>I do think the Lakers will make moves at the trade deadline.</p>

<p>For this team to be a legit contender in the playoffs, D’lo cannot be the Lakers starting point guard.
He is way too inconsistent and streaky to be a reliable starting point guard in the playoffs.</p>

<p>The D’lo-Reaves back court is also abysmal defensively and is not good enough offensively to justify this awful defensive pairing in the playoffs. Reaves has been great and reliable in the playoffs, unlike D’lo, who is also an expiring contract after this upcoming season, so I think he should be traded by the deadline at the latest.</p>

<p>I also think the team lacks a sufficient back up C for AD. Hayes is solid and hopefully he can improve this season, but I still don’t think he will be good enough to be a team with contending hopes main back up C.</p>

<p>The Lakers should try trade for another C sometime before the trade deadline, to give AD sufficient help and allow him to rest more during regular season and even playoff games if he can.</p>

<p>I know that the team has tried to make trades but there apparently haven’t been any great offers so far.</p>

<p>But I think the front office has not been greatly determined to search for a good deal and are happy to keep the same roster.</p>

<p>I think the Lakers front offices lack of desire to search for a trade is the main reason they could not find anything.</p>

<p>I think this is the case because other teams that consider themselves as contending teams have been able to execute trades to upgrade their roster, such as OKC trading Giddey for Caruso and the Knicks trading for Mikal.</p>

      <label for="ln09ygv" class="commentText"><p>^^ This.</p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t have any assets besides Reaves and their only 2 FRPs, and teams asking price for trades was inflated in a tight market and correctly assessing negotiating leverage. There weren&rsquo;t many moves available, and none that were clearly net positives.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s fun to say <em>they should have done something</em>&hellip;. but what, exactly?</p>

<p>Jonas was a lot more likely to sign with us than Klay and we wouldn’t have had to do a sign and trade as well. Instead we decided to wait on Klay and missed out on both players.</p>

<p>So based on my recollection of those rumors, it does appear that you guys could&rsquo;ve offered him more money than the Wizards.</p>

Their was no magic(no pun intended) player they could have gotten for Reeves+2 first that would suddenly turn them into contenders.  Even if the Bronny guranteed contract is worthy of an eyeroll,replacicing his guranteed salary with a min level guy also would have little impact on how many ever wins they get this season.</p>

<p>Philly could have given him the max and they would be a legit contender if he joined. He should have signed with them to get the max and be on a legitimately contending team.</p>

<p>OKC could have given him more than the vet min and still a decent amount of money, albeit a lot less than a max extension. They would have been the second best option, to have the best balance of being able to legitimately contend and still get some money.</p>

      <label for="ln0chfc" class="commentText"><p>They gave up on trying since the Westbrook debacle. It&rsquo;s hard to come back from that trade. We gave up valuable and elite role players for a guy who didn&rsquo;t fit. I think at this point they&rsquo;re waiting for Lebron to retire so they can start over. This current squad is raw ass. They&rsquo;ll try and make a move by the trade deadline and strike out. Then they&rsquo;ll focus on the buy out market and strike out once more. Rinse and repeat next year.</p>

So basically rui and Lebron are the only forwards. Also Hayes is center size in terms of height but he’s more of a springy athletic guy and not much of a bruiser.</p>

Rushing to be bad doesn’t mean you’re going to turn it around fast. If anything the treatment they gave Kobe and the subsequent signing of Lebron as a FA shows that treating your superstars well on the way out is a worthwhile investment.</p>

<p>Honestly, I think pushing the reset button and trading LBJ &amp; AD would have been the smart basketball decision, but obviously that wasn&rsquo;t an option.</p>

<p>In essence, LA sold their soul to Satan in acquiring LeBron, and have mortgaged their future to placate his requirements (previous stints he required trading picks for contention pieces, now he seems content giving away the Future he won&rsquo;t be a part of for having buddies or his kids on the roster, like he has accepted he won&rsquo;t win another 🏆)</p>

      <label for="ln0nkhn" class="commentText"><p>An improvement, but they’re not close to contending in the west. Lebron chose to play with his son over contending for a last ring, which I’m here to say which is better. They just don’t have the firepower to reliably win games behind Lebron and AD’s production, defense will be suspect outside of AD and Vanderbilt, and even if they’re way better out the gate, they have to hope 40 year old Lebron and AD can stay healthy an entire season.</p>

<p>Their logical ceiling is around the 6 seed. Firing Ham can only do so much. They’re very short on assets, building a contender was a tall order anyways, can’t really fault Pelinka in this instance.</p>

<p>But who knows, maybe JJ will instantaneously the next Phil Jackson and get then to the finals. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s remotely possible with that roster, but hope dies lasty as that&rsquo;s all the Lakers fans have this season.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we will have to listen to the James Family bullshit all season long on TV, and I don&rsquo;t think even Lakers fans look forward to that topic being discussed nonstop.</p>

      <label for="ln0mz9x" class="commentText"><p>I think they got their ring out of Lebron/AD and are content to just ride Lebron off into the sunset without burning any more future picks. Lebron seems fine with that too.</p>

<p>There wasn’t really a move to make to get back into contention. Assets are depleted and their 3rd best player is probably more of a good 6th man in this league on a contender. They’re basically just rebuilding now for a post Lebron era.</p>

<p>I absolutely respect the history, and I have Magic way higher on my top players list than I suspect most non-Laker fans might. I grew up watching the success of Showtime and respect all that Shaq &amp; Kobe did…</p>

<p>But this is not that team. The only thing that they have in common are the uniforms and the name.  This team just seems like they are content with riding out LeBron’s name as long as they can and don’t care about much more.</p>

<p>They are not an intriguing team. Several other teams who have had worse records - Houston, Orlando, even San Antonio - they are intriguing because they are trying to be something. The Lakers do not feel like that.</p>

<p>Look, the whole “Bronny” thing was pretty damned cringeworthy to everyone outside of the LeBron circle. They didn’t address issues with this team to succeed; and there are so many teams easily ahead of them, and others on the way up!</p>

<p>They are just “there.”</p>

<p>They have LeBron, and as long as they have LeBron you cannot count them out. That said, there is no fear against facing this team.</p>

<p>Ride out this phase and see what happens next. The Lakers will always be back, so you shouldn’t have to wait long.</p>

You just try to keep your team maximized even if it&rsquo;s a 40-45 win roster and you have no assets to improve it further. You just keep it. They can explore trades and very probably will.</p>

Fast forward to the offseason and now all of a sudden they do not want to part with said assets, unless for a quote on quote franchise superstar which isn’t happening.  I feel sorry for Laker fans they are stuck with Jeanie who only cares about being able to tell people she has LeBron instead of building a winner.  Years ago she claimed she was like her father but she is nothing like Jerry she lacks the leadership ability to make decisions like her father had</p>

<p>Rui can give you 20 as easily as he can give you 6. D&rsquo;Lo is even more unpredictably inconsistent, and is not a good defender. Reaves has shown himself to be a pretty great all-around offensive player, but he&rsquo;s also a poor defender. Vanderbilt is a very good defender, but can&rsquo;t score.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine them winning a single game that both Lebron and AD do not play, unless it&rsquo;s against a bottom feeder who are also missing their two best players. Even with Lebron in and AD out, their big rotation is abysmal.</p>

<p>As far as coaching - who knows? I could see Redick being great as well as I can see him losing the locker room in a matter of weeks.</p>

<p>Vincent is the only one who is making money, all the rest are minimum contracts. And Vincent got less than the mle and was a reasonable flier for the role. It&rsquo;s just he got injured and that tanked his stock.</p>

<p>Like gave, woods using his option was the cost of signing him in an earlier year. You can argue that pelinka should not have given so many options perhaps</p>

<p>But in general I agree with your points.</p>

Definitely a championship contender maybe even a dynasty level team.</p>

<p>The club is caught in the land of mid, and the only reason Bron is there is because he sells tickets; the club isn&rsquo;t going anywhere, and the haul you could get for Bron would re-tool the club and turn them into a contender again.</p>

More teams should just let the team you draft and field, be the team that grows together organically to be the best they can.</p>

<p>Sometimes you can’t bank account your way to a solution. You can’t buy player integrity, or organic team growth - you have to let that happen on its own. All you can do is put the pieces you have together and see if they complete the puzzle YOU are trying to solve.</p>

      <label for="ln0ycyz" class="commentText"><p>Joke of a franchise atm. Rob Pelinka is one of the worst GM’s in the league but the fan base is constantly convinced otherwise by bare minimum moves like trading for DLo and Rui. The lakers are no threat whatsoever, even if Bron and AD play at their best.
I’m flabbergasted at the fact that there were so many players that were moved around and not a single one of them landed in LA- Bridges, Derozan, George, Klay. All of them were on LA’s radar but they all went to better situations. It’s a sad situation in LA right now, and what’s hilarious is that the fans will continue to have high expectations as long as Bron is still playing.</p>

      <label for="ln0z8aa" class="commentText"><p>I would imagine the non-lakers fan consensus is that if lakers ownership and mgmt was instead in charge of a randomly selected small market team, they would probably be one of the worst teams in the league.</p>

<p>They have never really recovered from the Westbrook trade, and the decision not to just keep Conley when trading away Russ was another mistake. Signing a bunch of dead weight to contracts last offseason with player options in year 2 predictably backfired when all of them picked up their options. They are prob on the short list of worst players 3 thru 15 on their roster in the nba.</p>

<p>Having two players good enough to be in the closing lineup of the Olympic gold medal team will always make them dangerous in a playoff series, but realistically they look like a play-in team that needs a lot to go right to advance.</p>

      <label for="ln19mfv" class="commentText"><p>Lakers aren’t going very far. LeBron needs a legit consistent third option. He had that with Bosh in Miami and Love in Cleveland. In his 2019-2020 championship season with the Lakers, his entire supporting cast was the third option behind him and AD. That squad was a well-oiled machine that played great defense and each player maximized their efforts. With the Mavs, Thunder, Wolves, and Nuggets all as legit contenders, I don’t think the Lakers will be better than any of those 4 teams.</p>

      <label for="ln1r9cv" class="commentText"><p>None of last year’s offseason additions got to gel with the team because they were hurt at random times last season.</p>

<p>Every team needs an energy/scrapper guy and Vando/ Gabe are it.</p>

<p>Sucks Vando is still hurt but there’s nothing that could have been done about that.</p>

<p>If the team was healthy last year they would have won more games and the season would have been completely different.</p>

<p>They also probably have enough wins to avoid Denver in the playoffs, who was the only team they didn’t really match up well with.</p>

No matter what though you still end up hearing about how they didnt make moves or made a good/bad move etc. And somehow the media always tries to convice people the lakers are an actual contender.</p>

      <label for="ln263h4" class="commentText"><p>not much, there are a lot of mistake when they trade for Russ, not much assets, their bench players are injured and not much of a value, 2 first rounders, no one will get dlo and first rounders for their Star, if you are taking a star level player from other team you need to include reeves to match the value, like no move really,</p>

<p>Then now the bench are all injured especially Wood and Vando, Gabe and Reddish is so-so, the only thing they can do is trade those injured players for some picks and low end players and sign Veterans like Dwight, Cousins to minimum. if not  then its a dead end</p>
