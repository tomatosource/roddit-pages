</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I am curious to see what Non-Lakers fans think about the Lakers front office deciding to essentially run the same roster back from last season?</p>

<p>The only major changes were as follows:</p>

<p>Firing head coach Darvin Ham and his coaching staff.</p>

<p>Replacing Ham and his coaching staff with JJ Redick as the next head coach and JJ’s new coaching staff that has Nate McMillan, Scott Brooks, Lindsey Harding, Greg St Jean and Beau Lebesque.</p>

<p>Replacing Taurean Prince and Spencer Dinwiddie with two drafted players in Dalton Knecht and
Bronny James.</p>

<p>Extending LeBron James and Max Christie.</p>

<p>D’angelo Russell, Jaxson Hayes, Christian Wood and Cam Reddish opting into their player options to stay on the team for the upcoming season.</p>

<p>I belive the Lakers depth chart will be as below:</p>

<p>PG: D’lo, Gabe, JHS, Bronny
SG: Reaves, Christie, Max Lewis
SF: Rui, Cam Reddish, Dalton Knecht
PF: LeBron, Vanderbilt, Wood
C: AD, Hayes, Wood</p>

<p>I personally think this team is no where near good enough towards being a legit contender. I view us as finishing anywhere between 6-11, with 7th (just at the end of the regular season, not considering play-in games determining seeding), as my predicted spot with this current roster.</p>

<p>I think the Lakers should have made moves over the offseason to try to improve the team, but the front office think the new coaching staff and better health will improve the team to be successful throughout the regular season.</p>

<p>I do think the Lakers will make moves at the trade deadline.</p>

<p>For this team to be a legit contender in the playoffs, D’lo cannot be the Lakers starting point guard.
He is way too inconsistent and streaky to be a reliable starting point guard in the playoffs.</p>

<p>The D’lo-Reaves back court is also abysmal defensively and is not good enough offensively to justify this awful defensive pairing in the playoffs. Reaves has been great and reliable in the playoffs, unlike D’lo, who is also an expiring contract after this upcoming season, so I think he should be traded by the deadline at the latest.</p>

<p>I also think the team lacks a sufficient back up C for AD. Hayes is solid and hopefully he can improve this season, but I still don’t think he will be good enough to be a team with contending hopes main back up C.</p>

<p>The Lakers should try trade for another C sometime before the trade deadline, to give AD sufficient help and allow him to rest more during regular season and even playoff games if he can.</p>

<p>I know that the team has tried to make trades but there apparently haven’t been any great offers so far.</p>

<p>But I think the front office has not been greatly determined to search for a good deal and are happy to keep the same roster.</p>

<p>I think the Lakers front offices lack of desire to search for a trade is the main reason they could not find anything.</p>

<p>I think this is the case because other teams that consider themselves as contending teams have been able to execute trades to upgrade their roster, such as OKC trading Giddey for Caruso and the Knicks trading for Mikal.</p>

      <label for="ln09ygv" class="commentText"><p>^^ This.</p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t have any assets besides Reaves and their only 2 FRPs, and teams asking price for trades was inflated in a tight market and correctly assessing negotiating leverage. There weren&rsquo;t many moves available, and none that were clearly net positives.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s fun to say <em>they should have done something</em>&hellip;. but what, exactly?</p>

<p>Jonas was a lot more likely to sign with us than Klay and we wouldn’t have had to do a sign and trade as well. Instead we decided to wait on Klay and missed out on both players.</p>

<p>I’m saying hindsight for things like should have gone for Valanciunas over Klay, but at that point in time when both are available, of course Pelinka would throw all his focus on Klay. It’s the right thought, just on HINDSIGHT, it seems wrong since Klay didn’t want LA.</p>

<p>You can’t blame Pelinka for doing the right thing at that point in time using hindsight like what salty Lakers fans are doing is my point.</p>

I don’t think any player that’s in their prime or a real contributor wants to play on a team with lebron. You get blamed for everything and it’s a media circus most players want to avoid. The ownership is trash and they don’t even have the best facility in LA anymore. There wasn’t any scenario that happens where Klay signs or Jonas.</p>

<p>They may be capped at a 6 seed but the alternative is to tear it down and that’s not feasible as you’re trying to be the place LeBron ends his career.</p>

      <label for="ln0fupe" class="commentText"><p>Bro, stop pushing the narrative that all elite players should demand to win a championship every single year at all costs. As fans, we need to understand how that&rsquo;s only a recent expectation.</p>

<p>The irony is that so many of us berate players like LeBron and KD who &ldquo;ring chase&rdquo;, but then put down guys like 2024 AD who don&rsquo;t demand trades because they aren&rsquo;t on the most dominant squad. What ever happened to praising competitiveness and loyalty?</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a big difference between players like AD giving up on the 2018 Pelicans (which I still don&rsquo;t agree with) and giving up on the 2024 Lakers. One of those teams had no legitimate shot. The other team has a long shot, but still a shot.</p>

<p>I can forgive a guy for giving up on a team that&rsquo;s clearly not trying and couldn&rsquo;t win without a divine intervention. It&rsquo;s a lot harder for me to forgive a guy for giving up on a team that could potentially win it all just because they want the easiest path.</p>

<p>AD already has a ring and would be happy to live in LA with his family. He is also great friends with LeBron and enjoyed hanging out with and playing alongside him.</p>

<p>I’m sure AD would ask out if he desperately wanted to contend for a chip again. I imagine that he knows that our current team is not good enough to be a legitimate contender, but is happy to stay here anyway.</p>

<p>Philly could have given him the max and they would be a legit contender if he joined. He should have signed with them to get the max and be on a legitimately contending team.</p>

<p>OKC could have given him more than the vet min and still a decent amount of money, albeit a lot less than a max extension. They would have been the second best option, to have the best balance of being able to legitimately contend and still get some money.</p>

<p>No way u’re that gullible to not see such an obvious giveaway right? Lol.</p>

<p>Also, Philly has the cap space to get LeBron, and even Lakers fans were scared he goes there. He not going to PHX on a minimum.</p>

I just think this nepotism stunt is silly. Bronny was never getting drafted without his name. 4 points per game, 30/20/60 splits. Heart problems. Cardiac arrest. Died on a court.</p>

<p>That’s not hate. That’s honest, fair criticism of an irresponsible and dangerous decision to play with his son who doesn’t have the skill and more importantly doesn’t have the cardiovascular health to play ball.</p>

<p>Last year Lively averaged like 5ppg and 5 rebounds per game and he was taken in the lottery</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s more to scouting than ppg.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think Bronny will be a starting level player but taking a defensive guard with shooting and passing upside at #55 isn&rsquo;t crazy or anything.</p>

      <label for="ln0chfc" class="commentText"><p>They gave up on trying since the Westbrook debacle. It&rsquo;s hard to come back from that trade. We gave up valuable and elite role players for a guy who didn&rsquo;t fit. I think at this point they&rsquo;re waiting for Lebron to retire so they can start over. This current squad is raw ass. They&rsquo;ll try and make a move by the trade deadline and strike out. Then they&rsquo;ll focus on the buy out market and strike out once more. Rinse and repeat next year.</p>

I get having hope, but they go past that and are straight delusional. I think JJ will be decent and it&rsquo;ll be nice to have a coach with a modern approach, but even if he does well, we have a team that is already weaker than most contenders, suffers an injury bug every season, and doesn&rsquo;t have a fucking Center.</p>

<p>The kicker is there so he can make back the money he &ldquo;gave away&rdquo; to get the Lakers under the apron and the NTC ensures that he goes to the team he wants (I would guess GSW).</p>

<p>If he isn&rsquo;t planning on being traded the trade kicker is useless and makes no sense.</p>

<p>In essence, LA sold their soul to Satan in acquiring LeBron, and have mortgaged their future to placate his requirements (previous stints he required trading picks for contention pieces, now he seems content giving away the Future he won&rsquo;t be a part of for having buddies or his kids on the roster, like he has accepted he won&rsquo;t win another 🏆)</p>

I feel sorry for Laker fans they are stuck with Jeanie who only cares about being able to tell people she has LeBron instead of building a winner.

<p>Rui can give you 20 as easily as he can give you 6. D&rsquo;Lo is even more unpredictably inconsistent, and is not a good defender. Reaves has shown himself to be a pretty great all-around offensive player, but he&rsquo;s also a poor defender. Vanderbilt is a very good defender, but can&rsquo;t score.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine them winning a single game that both Lebron and AD do not play, unless it&rsquo;s against a bottom feeder who are also missing their two best players. Even with Lebron in and AD out, their big rotation is abysmal.</p>

<p>As far as coaching - who knows? I could see Redick being great as well as I can see him losing the locker room in a matter of weeks.</p>

<p>I think the Lakers will be very entertaining&hellip;for opposing teams&rsquo; fans.</p>

<p>But who knows, maybe JJ will instantaneously the next Phil Jackson and get then to the finals. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s remotely possible with that roster, but hope dies lasty as that&rsquo;s all the Lakers fans have this season.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we will have to listen to the James Family bullshit all season long on TV, and I don&rsquo;t think even Lakers fans look forward to that topic being discussed nonstop.</p>

      <label for="ln0fgeh" class="commentText"><p>Tbh I think Lakers are stuck for better or worse because of how much people think having LeBron and Davis means. There&rsquo;s just an assumption that there HAS to be a winning formula with LeBron and Davis and it has to be very easy and simple because these two players give so many wins in everyone&rsquo;s belief. That&rsquo;s why they were trading intensely after one disappointing season, and ended up like this.</p>

<p>Obviously they cannot trade Davis as they&rsquo;d be beheaded by the fans for it, but also - I&rsquo;d say almost all the results confirm this - they will not be AS good as people expect in this form.</p>

<p>So what can they do? Kinda nothing for now. They can trade some stuff that nobody wants that much for other stuff that nobody wants that much. It&rsquo;s hard to just take something bad and get something good for it in a trade.</p>

      <label for="ln0fiiu" class="commentText"><p>Not surprising. What could they have realistically done? They don’t want to rebuild. Even if they did. Who’s going to pay a premium of what AD is worth? He’s always hurt. They are going to have to dumpster dive to find random players and hope they can break out. If they want to cash in on the LeBron retirement tour that’s fine with me.</p>

<p>There wasn’t really a move to make to get back into contention. Assets are depleted and their 3rd best player is probably more of a good 6th man in this league on a contender. They’re basically just rebuilding now for a post Lebron era.</p>

Lebron chose to play with his son over contending for a last ring, which I’m here to say which is better. They just don’t have the firepower to reliably win games behind Lebron and AD’s production, defense will be suspect outside of AD and Vanderbilt, and even if they’re way better out the gate, they have to hope 40 year old Lebron and AD can stay healthy an entire season.</p>

<p>Their logical ceiling is around the 6 seed. Firing Ham can only do so much. They’re very short on assets, building a contender was a tall order anyways, can’t really fault Pelinka in this instance.</p>

<p>D.Lo? What team wants him? Contenders don&rsquo;t want him. Tankers don&rsquo;t want him. The Lakers are not a team with assets usually because they are always trading picks away and stacking their team and paying the luxury.</p>

<p>Their bench is weak as it is, who are they trading? Who wants the Lakers role players?</p>

I also don’t understand why a team with championship aspirations keeps picking first year coaches. If you replaced AD and LBJ with regular all stars, everyone would agree this team has no business getting past the 2nd round.</p>

<p>I don’t blame Russ. I blame Pelinka. The trade for Russ was stupid as hell</p>

      <label for="ln0tctg" class="commentText"><p>I mean, if you have a core group of players that work well and gel together - then why try to “fix” it? It’s not broken. More teams should do that. More teams should just let the team you draft and field, be the team that grows together organically to be the best they can.</p>

<p>Sometimes you can’t bank account your way to a solution. You can’t buy player integrity, or organic team growth - you have to let that happen on its own. All you can do is put the pieces you have together and see if they complete the puzzle YOU are trying to solve.</p>

They are a very deep team, but just couldn’t showcase that due to last years injuries. Derozan wasn’t going to move the needle, neither was Klay Thompson. Their best bet was keeping that team together and giving it another shot when everyone was healthy and possibly move Russell at the trade deadline.</p>
