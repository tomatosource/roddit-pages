</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I am curious to see what Non-Lakers fans think about the Lakers front office deciding to essentially run the same roster back from last season?</p>

<p>The only major changes were as follows:</p>

<p>Firing head coach Darvin Ham and his coaching staff.</p>

<p>Replacing Ham and his coaching staff with JJ Redick as the next head coach and JJ’s new coaching staff that has Nate McMillan, Scott Brooks, Lindsey Harding, Greg St Jean and Beau Lebesque.</p>

<p>Replacing Taurean Prince and Spencer Dinwiddie with two drafted players in Dalton Knecht and
Bronny James.</p>

<p>Extending LeBron James and Max Christie.</p>

<p>D’angelo Russell, Jaxson Hayes, Christian Wood and Cam Reddish opting into their player options to stay on the team for the upcoming season.</p>

<p>I belive the Lakers depth chart will be as below:</p>

<p>PG: D’lo, Gabe, JHS, Bronny
SG: Reaves, Christie, Max Lewis
SF: Rui, Cam Reddish, Dalton Knecht
PF: LeBron, Vanderbilt, Wood
C: AD, Hayes, Wood</p>

<p>I personally think this team is no where near good enough towards being a legit contender. I view us as finishing anywhere between 6-11, with 7th (just at the end of the regular season, not considering play-in games determining seeding), as my predicted spot with this current roster.</p>

<p>I think the Lakers should have made moves over the offseason to try to improve the team, but the front office think the new coaching staff and better health will improve the team to be successful throughout the regular season.</p>

<p>I do think the Lakers will make moves at the trade deadline.</p>

<p>For this team to be a legit contender in the playoffs, D’lo cannot be the Lakers starting point guard.
He is way too inconsistent and streaky to be a reliable starting point guard in the playoffs.</p>

<p>The D’lo-Reaves back court is also abysmal defensively and is not good enough offensively to justify this awful defensive pairing in the playoffs. Reaves has been great and reliable in the playoffs, unlike D’lo, who is also an expiring contract after this upcoming season, so I think he should be traded by the deadline at the latest.</p>

<p>I also think the team lacks a sufficient back up C for AD. Hayes is solid and hopefully he can improve this season, but I still don’t think he will be good enough to be a team with contending hopes main back up C.</p>

<p>The Lakers should try trade for another C sometime before the trade deadline, to give AD sufficient help and allow him to rest more during regular season and even playoff games if he can.</p>

<p>I know that the team has tried to make trades but there apparently haven’t been any great offers so far.</p>

<p>But I think the front office has not been greatly determined to search for a good deal and are happy to keep the same roster.</p>

<p>I think the Lakers front offices lack of desire to search for a trade is the main reason they could not find anything.</p>

<p>I think this is the case because other teams that consider themselves as contending teams have been able to execute trades to upgrade their roster, such as OKC trading Giddey for Caruso and the Knicks trading for Mikal.</p>

      <label for="ln09ygv" class="commentText"><p>^^ This.</p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t have any assets besides Reaves and their only 2 FRPs, and teams asking price for trades was inflated in a tight market and correctly assessing negotiating leverage. There weren&rsquo;t many moves available, and none that were clearly net positives.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s fun to say <em>they should have done something</em>&hellip;. but what, exactly?</p>

      <label for="ln0acxg" class="commentText"><p>LeBron was willing to take a pay cut to have the MLE. They should have just signed Jonas instead of waiting on Klay.</p>

<p>Jonas was a lot more likely to sign with us than Klay and we wouldn’t have had to do a sign and trade as well. Instead we decided to wait on Klay and missed out on both players.</p>

They are not in a position to contend so as long as they win enough games to be in the playoff race they can be successfully financially. That said wtf do you want them to do to actually contend? There are no moves this team can do tp contend, its an aged team that will be blown up in two years.</p>

      <label for="ln07pg8" class="commentText"><p>Kinda suspect that their move at the deadline will be trading LeBron away. The trade kicker on his contract is a huge tell. Why would he want a trade kicker AND a no-trade clause?</p>

<p>The kicker is there so he can make back the money he &ldquo;gave away&rdquo; to get the Lakers under the apron and the NTC ensures that he goes to the team he wants (I would guess GSW).</p>

<p>If he isn&rsquo;t planning on being traded the trade kicker is useless and makes no sense.</p>

      <label for="ln092aj" class="commentText"><p>I think it is all about making the money and being somewhat delusional that the roster is good enough to have a top record and make it to the Finals.  I think the smartest thing they did was to hire some very experienced assistant coaches to help Redick out.  Based on the depth in the West they will be lucky to avoid the play-in tournament.</p>
