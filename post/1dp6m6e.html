</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>We&rsquo;ve all heard that this year&rsquo;s NBA draft class is not supposed to be good. But what does that mean? If the analysts are right, how much worse will this year&rsquo;s draft class than the draft class from an average or even a great class?</p>

<p>TLDR: <em>The difference is enormous (or at least larger than I expected it to be).</em> A top-5 pick from a terrible draft is less valuable, on average, than a top-30 pick from a fantastic draft.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://quantimschmitz.com/2024/06/25/the-gap-between-good-and-bad-nba-draft-classes-is-huge/" target="_blank">You can find my full writeup here, if you crave all the details.</a></em></p>

<p>#Measuring Draft Class Quality</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using total Win Shares to measure draft quality. Win Shares aren&rsquo;t an infallible all-in-one metric by any means, but they roughly capture the kinds of things an all-in-one metric should capture, and they have a very intuitive meaning: total win shares = total wins a player&rsquo;s presence added for his team.</p>

<p>Win shares gave reasonable and intuitive results when I had looked at <a href="https://quantimschmitz.com/2023/04/02/how-valuable-is-each-nba-draft-pick/" target="_blank">how valuable each NBA draft pick is</a> and <a href="https://quantimschmitz.com/2022/11/01/have-nba-teams-gotten-better-at-drafting/" target="_blank">whether NBA teams have gotten worse at drafting</a>, which is why I&rsquo;m sticking with them for now.</p>

<p>I looked at the average win shares for players picked in the Top 5, Top 10, and Top 30 of each NBA draft since 1979.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://quantimschmitz.com/2024/06/25/the-gap-between-good-and-bad-nba-draft-classes-is-huge/" target="_blank">The result is a pretty wild ride,</a></strong> especially if you look at the top 5, who have zagged between fantastic and terrible from year to year.</p>

<p>#How Much Better is a Good Draft Than a Bad One?</p>

<p>Since recent draft classes haven&rsquo;t had time to earn win shares, I looked at just the draft classes before 2014, so they all had at least a decade of results. I divided these into percentiles, so a 20th percentile draft is better than 20% of drafts and worse than 80%, etc.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://i0.wp.com/quantimschmitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-1.png?w=415&amp;ssl=1" target="_blank">Here&rsquo;s a table of the results.</a></strong></p>

<p>The gap between good and bad draft classes can be massive, especially early in the draft.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The top 5 picks in a fantastic (95th percentile, think 1984 or 2003) draft produce about <strong>four times</strong> as many win shares as the top five in a terrible (5th percentile) draft</p></li>

<li><p>The top 5 in a good (80th percentile) draft are about <strong>twice</strong> as productive as the top five in a poor (20th percentile) draft.</p></li>

<li><p>Even a “normal” 50th percentile draft’s top five is <strong>more than twice</strong> as impactful as a terrible draft’s top five.</p></li>

<li><p>This flattens out a bit as we get later in the draft. For the entire top 30, the picks in an excellent 95th percentile draft produce about twice as many win shares as the picks from a terrible 5th percentile draft.</p></li>

<li><p>A top 30 pick from a great draft is more valuable on average <em>than even a top 5 pick</em> from a bad draft.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If this draft class really ends up being as terrible as some are saying, then it could be quickly overshadowed by the classes before and after it.</p>

      <label for="laetc4e" class="commentText"><p>I think the more important question is how good are analysts at actually predicting the quality of a draft?</p>

<p>I think most people just throw shit at the wall. Like how everyone says this year’s class is “super deep” just based on vibes, and because the top end of the draft is seen as weaker than usual so there has to be something to compensate</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard several analysts say that this draft class is like a normal draft class but without the top several players, which <em>is</em> something I can quantify, but we&rsquo;ll need to wait years to see if that turns out to be true.</p>

<p>Some analysts (like Kevin Pelton) have published WAR projections for top draft prospects for years.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d be curious whether those projections (i) have been accurate at projecting class quality, and (ii) agree with the general consensus that this class sucks.</p>

Risacher has 0 handle and a near negative wingspan, Reed Sheppard has the same type of wingspan and he&rsquo;s undersized, Castle&rsquo;s shot chart is horrific, Dillingham only weighs half a redditor and Clingan only played half the game last year and has no offensive game.  Any of these guys could be great but no one in this draft is a sure thing</p>

      <label for="laeuwoh" class="commentText"><p>My question would be: are the results found here different than the results you would get if you just randomly sorted all of the studied prospects into arbitrary classes?</p>

<p>If you run the sim 1000 times how many include a class as good as 1984?</p>

<p>I’m just curious if there is meaningful effect of individual classes. But this is excellent analysis</p>

      <label for="laewcq6" class="commentText"><p>I think this is a good question, and maybe the right way to think about draft classes is that players <em>have</em> been randomly sorted into them just by being born at different times.</p>

<p>This is the main reason why I think draft classes will even out over time. If the talent pool is larger, then the effect of noise gets less. Maybe there isn&rsquo;t a star coming out of college, but there could still be one coming from an overseas league or the G-League.</p>

      <label for="laewwsp" class="commentText"><p>I think there’s maybe some effect like if the class is expected to be bad then fringe players will declare when they otherwise wouldn’t have. Or a lot of these players having come up through the ranks together caused increased development in each other. Etc.</p>

<p>But I don’t have a great gauge on how that actually bears out. If I’m just seeing causes where there is randomness.</p>

<p>For sure agree that the global reach of the talent pool has and will continue to change things though.</p>

      <label for="laezh8c" class="commentText"><p>I appreciate this analysis, but I think the presentation can mislead people because of the specific stat you&rsquo;re using.  Specifically, when you talk about a &ldquo;top 30 pick&rdquo; in a good draft versus a &ldquo;top 5 pick&rdquo; in a bad draft, what that means in a technical sense in your analysis is that the sum of values of a good draft&rsquo;s picks 1-30, divided by 30, can beat out the sum of a bad draft picks 1-5 divided by 5 &ndash; but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that picks in the 26-30 range from a good draft are anywhere close to the value of a top 5 pick from a bad draft; the overall value is being driven mostly by really good picks which are still mostly near the top of those legendary drafts.</p>

<p>For example, the 2000 draft was bad (the top 5 players averaged ~28 win shares), while the 1984 draft was legendary (Jordan, Stockton, Barkley, Hakeem, and Thorpe alone had so many WS that if the other 25 picks had been pure busts the top 30 still would have averaged 28 win shares.)  In 1984, even picks 11-20 averaged over 51 win shares, which blows away the value of the top 5 in 2000 &ndash; but picks 21-30 in 1984 averaged 3.1 win shares (almost entirely from Ron Anderson being a solid player), so having a pick in the 20s in that draft wasn&rsquo;t anywhere close to the value of a top 5 pick in 2000.  In fact, picks 21-30 in 2000 actually averaged higher value than picks 21-30 in 1984 (mostly because Mo Pete had a good career.)</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;d be more effective to look at the average win shares produced by 5 or 10 pick buckets (1-5, 6-10, &hellip;, 26-30 or 1-10, 11-20, 21-30) in good/average/bad drafts.  Like, in a great overall draft, picks 1-5 have X average, picks 6-10 have Y average, and so on.  And then figure out which buckets &ldquo;bad draft top 5&rdquo; match up with, which I suspect would be more like &ldquo;great draft picks 11-15&rdquo; rather than great draft picks 26-30.</p>

At least add some adjustment to extrapolate what their total win shares would be for a full career. Also Lebron is doing a lot of work sending the 2003 datapoint to the stratosphere.</p>

<p>Who&rsquo;s to say that Alexandre Sarr won&rsquo;t develop the handles of Kyrie Irving, the shooting of Steph Curry, the post moves of Hakeem, the mid range pull ups of Jordan, the touch of Nikola Jokic, the playmaking of Magic Johnson, the rim protection of Bill Russell and grow to the height and wingspan of Manute Bol?</p>

<p>Jokes aside, there&rsquo;s pretty much always at least a couple of all stars even in really bad drafts.</p>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s 2000, which had &ldquo;3 all stars&rdquo; but they all only made it once lol.</p>
