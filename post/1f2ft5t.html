      <label for="lk675vx" class="commentText"><p>I went to a state school and we made march madness one season (16 seed). Our star was conference player of the year.</p>

<p>I played pickup with him once at the gym and he was clearly half assing it, he was unbelievable. Could just glide and rise to the rim. Made passes and reads correctly every time. Felt like it was no effort. I remember when he made a beautiful kick out to me behind the arc and my first thought was just “don’t air ball this shit”.</p>

<p>Our starting center was playing that game too. His precision skills weren’t the same, obviously, but as a short guy on the court, playing with someone that was around 6’8”+ it was laughable how he could just command the paint however he wanted.</p>

Ran a pick and roll with him and he throws these absolute dimes that I never had a prayer in catching.</p>

<p>Made me sympathize for Caitlin Clark’s teammates. If you’re just not used to playing at that speed or that level, you aren’t going to be able to catch that 60 foot bounce pass cleanly.</p>

      <label for="lk6gwyi" class="commentText"><p>Playing pickup in college and I switched on a screen at the top of the key. Dude drove right and I hip checked him out of the lane but he still took me to the rack. I went for the block and he wrapped under the rim and dunked and 1 all over me. The gym cleared out and the game was over. A random dude 2 minutes later asked me why I tried to jump with Lamont Strothers. I had no idea who that was but apparently he went to my college and played in the NBA a few years. Occasionally came back to school to make clowns out of idiots like me.</p>

<p>Also played with and against Ron Baker at the rec in college. Actually contested a step back jumper from him and got a finger to it. They beat us by a few, I was walking off the court and he tapped me and said hey we need one more. Guess I had done enough to earn a little respect that day. Played like 2-3 games with him before he dipped for the day. He was obviously going nowhere near all out. But just incredibly solid player all around.</p>

So cool one day I bring my old cheap Reebok basketball shoes and me him and these other two short guys playing casual 2 v 2. All good we were just killing time he wasn’t trying but he can obviously dunk - then randomly his cousin calls “hey cuz I’m in the area what’s up” “nothing just playing ball with classmates” “Oh cool can I join - I got my gear in the car.” Half hour later his taller Sudanese cousin turns up - it’s Thon Maker. Was cool and they obviously played against each other and mostly half paced in the low post then I had to go class and they went to get lunch together</p>

I get there and Neil Reed, Richard Mandeville, and Brian Evans were on Court 1, where all the really talented players would play. Neil Reed said, “We need 2”, and me and another random guy both raised our hands immediately, and they wave us over. It was obvious that they didn’t care who came out there to make 5, they just wanted someone, because I’m 5’10”, skinny, no hops, and an extremely questionable jump shot.  Didn’t matter.  Brian Evans shot (and made) from literally everywhere. We won 10 games in a row very comfortably and basically all I did was inbound the ball, occasionally catch a pass and immediately pass to someone else.</p>

      <label for="lk6khx7" class="commentText"><p>Not disagreeing with you but in my area the jv squad and varsity squad are essentially the same.  The JV kids just play a game before hand.  The JV is basically just open roster for whoever the coach wants to be on it.  If you are a sophomore and are good enough to be on varsity and grab a couple minutes  as a bench guy, you usually play the whole JV game.  It&rsquo;s not an either or situation.  That&rsquo;s Pennsylvania public school.</p>

<p>My college friends played D3 and I would largely get destroyed by them. But I could stay in front of them. They’d just shoot quicker than I could get a hand up, or pass into a play I never saw developing.</p>

<p>But Lonnie made me actively avoid him. Like I didn’t want to be on YouTube getting clowned.</p>

<p>That Scalabrine quote hit me hard that day.</p>

<p>I played football against kids that won superbowl rings and I sucked, but there wasn’t the kind of disparity there was with basketball.</p>

      <label for="lk658nk" class="commentText"><p>Bobby Portis played in one of the Little Rock, AR high schools (either North Little Rock, or Little Rock Hall) which are both the largest school classification in our state (7A). I played in a much smaller school (4A, but more like 3A because they always did some shenanigans with our school district classification because of the astronomical amount of young kids we had coming up through our primary schools at the time).</p>

<p>Anyway, we were at a summer league tournament somewhere… I can’t remember if it was around central AR or up around Northwest AR at the time, but we match up against Bobby Portis and his LR team there.</p>

<p>So my ass played the <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> on our High School team at a whopping 180lbs and 6’1. I felt like that feisty grade schooler going up against a nonchalant high school varsity star with Bobby towering over me at… I think our coach told us he (and another teammate of his) was 6’7 at the time. I’m, like, pressing my whole body weight into him while he just casually leans back into me and they run some high post split actions off of him around the elbow.</p>

<p>Pretty sure I got dunked on a number of times that game. I remember him looking so… Unenthused to be playing a team with such small players on it lmao. With the facial expression and body language of “we really gotta be playing these guys?”</p>

<p>We kept the score within 30 points, at least.</p>

      <label for="lk6dv8b" class="commentText"><p>I played pickup basketball with Stephon Marbury. This was in Ft. Jackson, SC during my training (summer 2001). Just a guy in my platoon claimed Starbury was his cousin or something, everyone assumed it was bullshit and never paid attention to it. We played pickup games on the evenings and weekends.</p>

<p>Sure as shit, one day he showed up. Really chill, just played with us for an hour. I have no measure for how stupidly good he was. I was a former average HS basketball player, generally good enough to run with most pickup games. The speed, handles, and shooting that he possessed were so far away from anyone that it wasn’t really a game.</p>

<p>Couldn’t even play HORSE with that mf’er.</p>

<p>But he was totally cool, down to earth, lots of laughing and fun.</p>

<p>Played against D1, g league players and while outmatched, never felt worthless until I played against some random guy at the gym.  He was wayyy out of shape (6’5, probably 325 lbs), but watching that man move so gracefully, hit every shot, block every shot, and still only going at 50% was mesmerizing. First time it ever really hit me how insanely bad I’d be compared to real pros.</p>

<p>I was playing pickup at the YMCA. I want to say i was around 15-16 years old at the time.</p>

<p>We were playing 5 on 5, and one of the people playing with use was really old. I&rsquo;m talking over 60.
You could tell he was older by looking at his face, but he had the body of a much younger man.</p>

<p>Anyways, this guy did not miss a single shot and always made to correct read on a play.</p>

<p>Defensively, he was slow footed due to his age. He got blown by a few times on drives, but any errant pass or sloppy dribble in his vicinity, he would get his massive hands on it and disrupt the play. Even though he wasn&rsquo;t jumping much, his combination of size and positioning made him an effective defender so long as he didn&rsquo;t get caught out on the perimeter.</p>

<p>After one of the games, I asked him where he learned to play like that. He told my friends and I that he played for the 1976 Canadian Olympic team.</p>

      <label for="lk6alsd" class="commentText"><p>Went to college with Andrew Goudelock. The Mini-Mamba. After the NIT his senior year, he’d work out with a trainer in the student gym almost every day, and he’d frequently play in pickup games after he finished his drills. These guys are on another level. Like, it wasn’t Andrew Goudelock out there—it was God disguised as Andrew Goudelock. He could do whatever he wanted. Pull up 3s from half court, breaking ankles and yamming it on people’s heads, hitting stupid moonshot floaters in the lane, taking the ball from guys a la Kawhi on Ben McLemore. Humiliated myself more than once, but after a while, I’d get the nod whenever we passed each other on campus. It’s an ego trip when that happens and one of your buddies is like “why is HE giving YOU the nod?!” Good memories.</p>

Used to have to guard him sometimes in practice. I rode the pine, ut I&rsquo;m still a tall dude and was fairly athletic at the time. Cooked me. Zero chance.</p>

I&rsquo;m playing as hard as I can - they are going like 50% at best so I was sorta competitive. Once a guy beats me off the dribble and does one of those layups where he doesn&rsquo;t really jump and I block his shot. Hey was like - hey look at you, you&rsquo;ve got some hops. But he was pissed I blocked his shot and proceeded to absolutely obliterate me from that point forward. I couldn&rsquo;t so much as dribble.</p>

      <label for="lk6f8i0" class="commentText"><p>Played against a handful of nba dudes and teammates with a few more in high school and the aau circuit. Also some exposure camps and local pro ams.</p>

<p>Austin rivers, Chandler parsons, Nick calathes, Dwight Powell, Brandon knight, Greg oden, Jason Williams, Shane Larkin, Aaron Gordon, Tacko, anfernee simons, and Marcus Jordan if you want to count that one lol. Probably a few more notable d1 players but that’s who I can think of off the top of my head in terms of nba names.</p>

<p>For the most part all of them were super cool dudes J Will was absolutely filthy even at his age. Austin rivers had one move his whole life (in/out crossover) and we sort of figured that one out so he wasn’t an issue to play against tbh. But his first step is stupid fast.</p>

<p>I think one of the biggest things people don’t realize is the difference in game IQ. Like there’s always gonna be dudes who can hoop and drop buckets. But when it gets to organized competitive basketball these guys all have that understanding as well and that’s what separates you from that next level. Also even the “unathletic” or “slow” guys are insanely explosive up against pretty much anyone else. It’s a combo of game awareness, skill, and athleticism. You can get away with one being above average but the other two have to be elite.</p>

He&rsquo;d pull up from 40 (this 20 years ago, so it was not normal like it is today) and swish, blow by everyone, not every trying, not breaking a sweat but embarrassed everyone so badly that it was demoralizing. I cannot imagine how much better NBA players are. This 6-2 backup D3 guard was so much better than us that we could not fathom being on his level. But he is so many levels below the NBA. Crazy.</p>

      <label for="lk6cgdv" class="commentText"><p>Played against a few NBA/college players when I was younger. The skill difference is just other worldy. Luther head used to play at a gym downtown and would play 21 sometimes if there was not too many ppl. There were some college players sometimes that would try to hold him and they couldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>He would say stuff like &ldquo;I can only shoot fadeaway bank shot 3 pointers&rdquo; and still win. Obviously we still tried to play him straight up and not foul him and stuff; I write this because there are enough ppl who would say shit like they&rsquo;d get into his landing zone and stuff if he tried that.</p>

<p>Watched Eddie Griffin (rest in peace) a bunch when he was doing community service at my university. He could splash easily from 35 feet away open.</p>

<p>It was always a good feeling when we played against someone much better and got a bucket or stopped but we all knew they weren&rsquo;t ever trying.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t really count but I played against Vince Young for pick up before and was able to put him on skates on one play and was probably a little too amped about it. Dude trucked me good for a score the next possession. Quickly reminded me to be humble.</p>

I played a little basketball with Jose Alvarado when he stood with his dad in Williamsburg he used to play in a lot of local gyms and parks. He was super polished at young &amp; honestly never made mistakes although he didn’t seem too flashy.</p>

I think he scored once when Stro was not even half-assing it.  After he scored the one, Stro started to try a little but was still only half-assigng it and I don’t think my friend got another shot off but he can always say he got the one.  It wasn’t even close, he just got bodied and put in the basket or got shot over and he is a decent size human being by non-nba standards(6-4, probably 200lb at the time).</p>

      <label for="lk6ew2z" class="commentText"><p>Excluding HS, when I played against a couple of would be pros, I played pretty consistently in a summer league once Matt Bonner was a pro, against him.
As an NBA fan, and someone who played against him in HS, I felt that Bonner had a solid, if one dimensional, career. Amazing shooter, fine rebounder, big body out there to stretch the floor.
This summer league had a handful of D1 players, top tier D2 players, and average players (like myself). It was as though Bonner was always playing a video game on easy mode.
Could he shoot from anywhere and make anything? Yes. And he did. But he also had better handle than any D1 PG on the court (and he’s a no handle bumbling nba big man). He moved faster than everyone. He passed better.
The “weakest” basketball skills of “role players” (if he is one) have, in my experience, have been multitudes better than the strongest skills of the next tier of player.</p>

<p>The skill gap is WIDE, each level has a large disparity in skill level. Large gap between normal HS player be great one. Large gap between great HS player vs productive college player. Large gap between productive college vs great college. HUGE gap between great college vs productive pro.</p>

<p>In college, we were a pretty good mid-major, made the tourney a couple times in a short span. We played the #1 team in the country, they had 4 future nba players. I have NEVER seen a group of players move so fast, most humbling experience of my life. We lost by 30+</p>

<p>Back in HS during a college summer camp we, at night the scrimmages were reserved for the top HS prospects mixed in with the college twam. I was matched up vs a future nba player and slam dunk participant. It was a close game and he did not like that he was close to losing to trash like me. He drilled two nba 3’s in back to back possessions to widen the score.</p>

<p>The last score of the game; he gets the rebound off our miss, I pick up <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> court. He crossed me up, I fall to one knee. The HS players watching “Oooo”. I ain’t no punk, I recover as he is starting his drive. He gives me a shoulder nudge to make some space and takes off. I contest and he dunks all over me.</p>

<p>Crowd goes nuts, running on the court, ripping their shirts off. Thankfully this was before social media or else I would be infamous.</p>

      <label for="lk6kc1r" class="commentText"><p>I played at an elite level in D3 about a decade ago now (all-conference, 5’11”).</p>

<p>It’s interesting seeing the overlaps and discrepancies in the skill levels of D3, D2, D1, and NBA players. I’ve played with a variety of all of these in pickup and diffferent leagues throughout the years.</p>

<p>If i play with regular players who were pretty good in high school, or at the top tier of their rec league gym, i can pretty much do whatever I want on the court. It feels like everyone is just so many steps behind in IQ, speed, navigating the game.</p>

<p>When I play with D2 and D1 players, I can play the game naturally and contribute at a fine level. I can hit shots, get by some defenders, make some passes, and play at a level that feels pretty good. I can actually be pretty dominant sometimes.</p>

<p>But there are just some moves that higher level players do that make me realize - I could practice for 10 years and never pull  off some of those moves. There’s a natural instinct and ability amongst a lot of those players, even at a very young age.</p>

<p>The ball control and balance of NBA players is on such another level.</p>

<p>The big differences is defense, physicality, agility, and consistency. A combination of all of those are what put the higher level players tiers above the lower levels.</p>

We knew about him of course and had a defensive scheme we hoped could slow him down. I remember coming into the locker room at half time and we were down 16 or something. I was thinking, “We did alright! He didn’t do too much and we’re not totally out of this game!” Then the assistant coach came in with the stats. He had like 24 points and 13 rebounds at the half! He was just casually doing anything he wanted I guess.</p>

I’m pretty sure high school or right after was the last time we played together, but he was just a normal ball player lol. Just better than most of us. But there were a lot of people like that. Growing up in New Jersey, high school basketball is kind of a “thing”, so a lot of really good to great players could be found. These guys aren’t superhuman or anything lol…they just work really fucking hard and have the right combination of size and skill. I know a few guys, if sized differently, that could compete with normal NBA guys (not the superstars lol)</p>

<p>He played in a parents vs faculty charity game where a Kurt Goveia (NFL linebacker for 91 Redskins) played for the faculty.  Kurt got real competitive once this guy started touching him and pulling out street ball tricks.</p>

<p>The entire team was good, most everyone went D1 or D2 (i played lacrosse instead) so it&rsquo;s not like they were more locked in than others. Tbh the two that I remember who put in the most effort and practiced the most after team practice didn&rsquo;t play much at all.</p>

<p>The two players that i played against that i remember being different were Dave Romney and Gyasi Zardes. They weren&rsquo;t any better than my best teammates but they were both unbelievably athletic. Fast af and big.</p>

At the time, the courts at this gym were highly competitive with lots of college players there and also some former NFL players. Would get there at like 5pm and there would be 30+ people waiting to play, if you lost your first game you just went home, cuz it was like 1-2 hour wait.</p>

<p>His brother started playing there and Josh came a couple times, I think when he was in between teams (or it was off season). Dude was tall and skinny but balled out everyone there with about 60% effort (you could tell he wasn&rsquo;t really trying). The difference between really really good gym heroes and a pro was just night and day. Was a nice guy, his brother was a bit of a dick.</p>

      <label for="lk6id1c" class="commentText"><p>No nba players for me, but I played pick up with some UT football players, and we absolutely destroyed every team. They would dominate off sheer athleticism. It was on another level. Josh Richardson would pull up and watch us after class from time to time.</p>

      <label for="lk6iltp" class="commentText"><p>I played pickup against Nate Robinson in Brooklyn, summer &lsquo;05 not too long after the draft. I was heading into my freshman year of high school and not a particularly big incoming freshman at 5&rsquo;9ish, I swear Nate was at least an inch shorter than me. He was unreal, lightning-fast and an automatic bucket every time he touched the ball. I think I tried to defend him once, he was past me and to the rim in a blink. I don&rsquo;t recall him doing much other than driving to the rim for layups, but it&rsquo;s all he needed to do to completely trash us.</p>

Oh, also worth noting that James Harden, Pascal Siakam, and Lucas Noguera have all come to this banquet that I used to work at as guests. That night when Harden came, I kept walking by him and making eye contact with him. Unforgettable and unreal experience (happened in September 2017 in Vaughan, Canada)</p>

      <label for="lk6istt" class="commentText"><p>-Played against SirDominic Pointer at LA fitness. He was big east defensive player of the year and had a small cup of coffee in the league. Nothing memorable other than the size difference. He’s like 6’5 a guard at the pro level but by far the biggest against amateurs. So he wasn’t really trying. Probably does him no good to play bully ball against amateurs. He was working on PG skills purposely not shooting just going 50%, setting people up</p>

<p>-Not nba but played against Jeff Capel when he was coach at VCU. They would open up the gym and play against the campus regulars. He did not miss. Game was just easy as hell to him. And this is a undrafted <sup>36</sup>&frasl;<sub>37</sub> year old</p>

<p>-Same runs, played against Eric Maynor when he was a freshman. This is before  VCU started turning out a few pros so never in a million years would think he’d be an NBA player. He looked like just a regular hooper. Nice, but not like ‘yea he’s gona play next to Russ and KD one day’</p>

<p>-My most direct tie is I played in HS ball with John Bryant. He started on St Joes undefeated team with Jameer Nelson and Delonte west. He didn’t make the league but he’s been an assistant coach for 10+ years and is now lead assistant for the Bulls. Crazy the degree of separation. He’s the one guy I can say I ‘know’ and he knows me</p>

      <label for="lk6j4ki" class="commentText"><p>Since people are sharing their college player stories, I played with 2 friends from high school, both DII. They weren&rsquo;t trying and someone on the other team started trash talking. It was like a 5-0 run to win in 2 minutes. Highlights were a &ldquo;blocked by james&rdquo; chase down block, and the other team being pressed at half court and turning it over for a fastbreak dunk.</p>

<p>Both 6&rsquo;2+, could get to the rim at will every time if they really wanted to.</p>

      <label for="lk6jhh1" class="commentText"><p>Played against Brian Butch. Badgers alumni with a very short stint as a nugget. He didn&rsquo;t play at all for them, but was on the team briefly. This was in high school and I was a bit younger than him. I was the tallest kid on my team and he was the tallest on his. It was a complete mismatch still. I was 6&rsquo;2&rdquo; at the time he was 6&rsquo;11&rdquo; lol. He posted me up all game. They&rsquo;d feed him every single time down court. He&rsquo;d catch it higher than I could reach and turn around and put up a shot higher than I could contend. I couldn&rsquo;t make shit happen on the other end. He&rsquo;d block any paint shot, and I got a few points of mid range pull ups after he got screened and we switched. It was a longgggg night.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, my uncle passed away. Before the game my father told me what happened. I remember like &ldquo;I&rsquo;ma fucking ball out tonight. This one&rsquo;s for you, unc! I&rsquo;ma make you proud!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Said all that and got dominated lmaoooo</p>

<p>Also played against Anthony Moody, but I didn&rsquo;t guard him. Played at a thing called the holy Cross tournament. He was so short, but had NBA talent. He played overseas and played for the G league back when it was the g League. He was insanely talented, super impressive to watch. Best hooper I&rsquo;ve ever seen in person in a game I played in.</p>

<p>He was basically unguardable. He scored whenever he wanted to and shutdown the “best” regular pickup players with little to no obvious effort on defense. It was incredible to watch. </p>

      <label for="lk6jnwz" class="commentText"><p>At FGCU I played a pick up game against our Cinderella squad (minus a couple stars and some of our B-squad) when Comer was trying out for the Heat. As a 6’3” slow af, unathletic, mid-pick up player, I blocked our SG once and my buddy got dunked on after he said “switch with me”. Basically we were fodder for them to have fun. It wasn’t remotely competitive but I had a blast.</p>

<p>When I was 19, I played against a 15-16 year old Sean Livingston in summer scrimmages. He was already 6’7” and he was already a great player. We knew he was going to be really good.</p>
