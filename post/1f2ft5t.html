      <label for="lk718xx" class="commentText"><p>I think it&rsquo;s 450 of the players with the most upside, not the best players once you get to like the 250s and above.</p>

<p>Teams could typically find more skilled players to fill the end of their benches, but high potential players move the needle. There are 31 year olds out of the league who could scorch the 12th-15th man 20 year olds.. But not good enough to crack a rotation, so it makes more sense to sign someone who is worse but might become good enough to contribute with time</p>

      <label for="lk74tqs" class="commentText"><p>I mean that&rsquo;s kind of splitting hairs in the context of the topic or even reinforces it. Comparing a high upside guy or a &ldquo;technically better&rdquo; high floor guy at the end of an NBA bench to anyone else who&rsquo;s never played professionally is still no contest regardless, the difference between those two is extremely marginal relative to any non-professional.</p>

<p>Yeah Dwight Howard would probably be more productive right now on an NBA team than James Wiseman but either of them are turning any pickup game into a crime scene.</p>

<p>Put that number against the total number of people who play professionally or as amateurs (likely in the tens if not hundreds of millions) and, well, you get the idea.</p>

      <label for="lk6yyv4" class="commentText"><p>People talk about that Scalabrine quote a lot as well as him punking players 1v1, but it’s even more interesting if you really watch those games, because everything he does is purely just putting his body in a position where he gets the same easy bucket almost every time.</p>

<p>His body positioning is just so casual and effortless, he gets easy buckets every time just by getting to his spot every time. He’s not a small guy so you have to deal with his size, but basically once he moves you it’s a wrap.</p>

<p>You take these kinds of minor yet critical skills for granted, but any bottom of the barrel NBA player would be truly phenomenal at them. And he was obviously an elite superstar but if you ever saw that Dwyane Wade vs Zaire Wade 1v1, it’s the same exact thing, though much funnier there cause Zaire got <em>mad</em>.</p>

<p>edit: let me <a href="https://youtu.be/2LdFMc1s38g?si=3qsd8-APmfhEEgDe" target="_blank">add the link</a> to that Dwayne vs Zaire 1v1. Obviously Wade and Scalabrine are worlds apart, but the same principle applies. It’s zero effort, they just get to their spots so easily and even instinctually, and then when they’re near the basket it’s automatic.</p>

<p>Listen to people like MJ or Kobe talk about other guys energy, how they use that to their advantage.</p>

<p>Rec players and D1 guys aren’t studying tape for countless hours, they don’t have a film room dedicated to assessing every minute of game film and then having a coach work 1 on 1 with you to improve.</p>

<p>It’s a different universe at the pro level, there is no comparison.</p>

The gym cleared out and the game was over. A random dude 2 minutes later asked me why I tried to jump with Lamont Strothers. I had no idea who that was but apparently he went to my college and played in the NBA a few years. Occasionally came back to school to make clowns out of idiots like me.</p>

<p>He was on the scout team for three years.</p>

<p>His Junior year had to to block a defensive tackle that went on to become a borderline Hall of Famer.</p>

<p>He got absolutely obliterated and ended up retiring because of several injuries he received that practice and 20 years later was still living in pain from it.</p>

<p>My co-worker was not a small man and could have absolutely destroyed any human in any sort of physical confrontation if he wasn&rsquo;t a very gentle soul, but the way he told the story this dude just obliterated him like he wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>

      <label for="lk675vx" class="commentText"><p>I went to a state school and we made march madness one season (16 seed). Our star was conference player of the year.</p>

<p>I played pickup with him once at the gym and he was clearly half assing it, he was unbelievable. Could just glide and rise to the rim. Made passes and reads correctly every time. Felt like it was no effort. I remember when he made a beautiful kick out to me behind the arc and my first thought was just “don’t air ball this shit”.</p>

<p>Our starting center was playing that game too. His precision skills weren’t the same, obviously, but as a short guy on the court, playing with someone that was around 6’8”+ it was laughable how he could just command the paint however he wanted.</p>

My brother managed to steal the ball and score on this guy just once. Dude turned around and went off for like 20 points in a row and never needed to stop and catch his breath. Shit was wild.</p>

<p>Made me sympathize for Caitlin Clark’s teammates. If you’re just not used to playing at that speed or that level, you aren’t going to be able to catch that 60 foot bounce pass cleanly.</p>

Just a guy in my platoon claimed Starbury was his cousin or something, everyone assumed it was bullshit and never paid attention to it. We played pickup games on the evenings and weekends.</p>

<p>Sure as shit, one day he showed up. Really chill, just played with us for an hour. I have no measure for how stupidly good he was. I was a former average HS basketball player, generally good enough to run with most pickup games. The speed, handles, and shooting that he possessed were so far away from anyone that it wasn’t really a game.</p>

<p>Couldn’t even play HORSE with that mf’er.</p>

<p>But he was totally cool, down to earth, lots of laughing and fun.</p>

<p>Played with Bogdan Bogdanovic, here in Serbia</p>

<p>My pickup crew is somewhat known to be the best in Belgrade. We sometimes win against 3x3 professional teams (highest world ranking teams are from Serbia) and the fun part is that sometimes my 3 dudes that are 45+ years old, win against prime FIBA teams, we even tease them about it, they play for the money, we play for fun</p>

<p>10ish years ago, Bogdan was 20y. still in Partizan Belgrade but was already in Serbian National team, it was summer, he came to our court.</p>

<p>I (6.0) was playing with a big center (6.9 guy, strong body) and another PG my size, both of us are shooters.</p>

<p>Bogi came with his 2 friends, some guys from US colleges at the time.</p>

<p>We were on fire. We took the 16-11 lead. I banked three 2pt shots which kinda shocked them, no one does that today and I have a knack for banking 3s.</p>

<p>Somehow, we provoked him. Some KG-MJ type of shit, something we said probably, when celebrating buckets.</p>

<p>It was 21-16 for Bogi&rsquo;s team. He scored every single basket until a win.</p>

<p>Now, I cant even begin to describe the unstoppableness of an Elite basketball player that is 100% locked in. Bruh, when he got mad, it was like we became children and he became Superman or Goku or some shit. Defense means nothing to him. Your 100% effort to stop his shot is pointless, he will fake you, fake again, then pull up, then hit the bottom of the net. You are not even close to contest it. And even after playing such an unproductive defense, you are dead and out of breath after 2 switches.</p>

<p>Honestly, I consider myself a good baller, but after seeing that, I can safely say that if we were to play one on one, with 100% effort, he would win me 21-0 .. Maybe 21-1, if God is on my side.</p>

<p>Second would be - shitposting ?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>massive Serbian basketball shitposter</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I literally have 1 submitted thread relating to basketball with this account, when I posted an X rumor that Avramovic maybe entering NBA. In other posts I am commenting on the entire /r/NBA, with mentioning Serbian players literally 3 times, in past 2 months. You must be deranged to have gone past my 2 months reddit history</p>

<p>And who the fuck are you to question my history ? Zero submitted threads, and total 40+ posts on New Zealand stuff and 5-6 posts on NBA.</p>

<p>And third would be, that if you knew anything about Serbia, you would know that it&rsquo;s a small country, Belgrade has 2 million people, and there are literally 3 popular pickup courts (Spanoulis court, Mozzart courts and Kalemegdan fortress court) so meeting professional ballers in the summer when they want to hang our with regular people is something that can happen to anyone. If by any chance you live in Sombor, there&rsquo;s 50% chance Jokic will pass you on a bike or on a horse sometime during the summer day.</p>

<p>Also played with and against Ron Baker at the rec in college. Actually contested a step back jumper from him and got a finger to it. They beat us by a few, I was walking off the court and he tapped me and said hey we need one more. Guess I had done enough to earn a little respect that day. Played like 2-3 games with him before he dipped for the day. He was obviously going nowhere near all out. But just incredibly solid player all around.</p>

      <label for="lk6x4ef" class="commentText"><p>I played with Steph Curry in highschool. He was in grade 8 playing and played tournaments and exhibition games with my grade 10 team. Pretty much the same game as today except he was 5 feet tall. Still throwing bombs from well beyond the 3 point line. He averaged 25 points per game on our grade 10 team and 45 points per game on his grade 8 team.</p>

<p>He was always in the gym til the end. At the end of the night he would gather all of the balls in the gym and bring them to one end of the court. Then he&rsquo;d proceed to shoot full court shots from the OPPOSITE free throw line. He&rsquo;d usually make a few.</p>

<p>One story I always tell was that he once threw me a full court alley-oop. I somehow caught it and laid it in. At the end of the game he ran over and jumped on my back leap frog style and caught me off guard. Then he told me he didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d actually catch it and make the shot lol</p>

      <label for="lk79731" class="commentText"><p>When I was in elementary school, I had this coach who took things way too seriously and would always tell us that Larry Bird wasn’t out there shooting half-court shots at the end of practice, he was practicing things that translated. To be clear, none of us were on the Larry Bird trajectory. But I’d like to cc that coach your story and remind him that this game can be fun sometimes.</p>

      <label for="lk8dzl2" class="commentText"><p>Steph Curry has said there isn’t a single shot he’s ever made in a game that he hasn’t practiced a million times in the gym. He says he’s practiced every possible shot on the court so much that he always expects it to go in regardless where it’s from. I know it’s beating a dead horse at this point but Steph is one of the few guys you can look at and see a direct correlation to how he changed the way basketball is played.</p>

I get there and Neil Reed, Richard Mandeville, and Brian Evans were on Court 1, where all the really talented players would play. Neil Reed said, “We need 2”, and me and another random guy both raised our hands immediately, and they wave us over. It was obvious that they didn’t care who came out there to make 5, they just wanted someone, because I’m 5’10”, skinny, no hops, and an extremely questionable jump shot.  Didn’t matter.  Brian Evans shot (and made) from literally everywhere. We won 10 games in a row very comfortably and basically all I did was inbound the ball, occasionally catch a pass and immediately pass to someone else.</p>

So cool one day I bring my old cheap Reebok basketball shoes and me him and these other two short guys playing casual 2 v 2. All good we were just killing time he wasn’t trying but he can obviously dunk - then randomly his cousin calls “hey cuz I’m in the area what’s up” “nothing just playing ball with classmates” “Oh cool can I join - I got my gear in the car.” Half hour later his taller Sudanese cousin turns up - it’s Thon Maker. Was cool and they obviously played against each other and mostly half paced in the low post then I had to go class and they went to get lunch together</p>

<p>My college friends played D3 and I would largely get destroyed by them. But I could stay in front of them. They’d just shoot quicker than I could get a hand up, or pass into a play I never saw developing.</p>

<p>But Lonnie made me actively avoid him. Like I didn’t want to be on YouTube getting clowned.</p>

<p>That Scalabrine quote hit me hard that day.</p>

<p>I played football against kids that won superbowl rings and I sucked, but there wasn’t the kind of disparity there was with basketball.</p>

<p>I honestly found it fun. Id love to hear your cousins opinion on him.</p>

<p>It was hard to get schooled by such a nice dude. Like some kids who know they have talent are absolute monsters. <em>Cough cough Pulisic</em></p>

<p>I was clapping for Lonnie every time he scored on us. It was just different. Like a highlight reel.</p>

<p>Lonnie was probably 18-19 and you wouldn’t really have known he was a <em>local</em> star let alone going to Miami on a full ride.</p>

<p>Also a little off topic but I gotta give Lonnie some praise for continuing to come back and improve and donate to our city. He’s donated more time and money to date than Taylor Swift.</p>

I don’t remember much. At the time I didn’t know what was going on. All I knew was that we were playing against a really good freshman. I had no idea he’d turn out to be Kyrie. Anyway, it was a scrimmage but he gave us 40. I’m not even sure if I got in the game as I was the only freshman on the varsity squad.</p>

      <label for="lk6khx7" class="commentText"><p>Not disagreeing with you but in my area the jv squad and varsity squad are essentially the same.  The JV kids just play a game before hand.  The JV is basically just open roster for whoever the coach wants to be on it.  If you are a sophomore and are good enough to be on varsity and grab a couple minutes  as a bench guy, you usually play the whole JV game.  It&rsquo;s not an either or situation.  That&rsquo;s Pennsylvania public school.</p>

<p>I was happy to get the rebounds as I was above average tall for my age.  It&rsquo;s the role my coach wanted me to fill.</p>

<p>Problem was the kid never missed,  so I had no rebounds to get.  Haha.  He would just drain 3s from downtown all day in his baggy gym shorts and jersey.  Running around looking like Muggsey Bogues making everyone look silly and breaking ankles.</p>

<p>His mom was super kind and she had me over for dinner once or twice. Dell I think got us tickets to a Raptors practice once or twice wth his connections which was a great day.</p>

<p>Super kind and humble as a kid.  Great teammate.</p>

<p>Anyways, we’re playing in the Bo Ryan summer tournament, in the knockout stage, quarterfinals I think. My class is going into our Junior years, really cocky, we’re hot shit.</p>

<p>We get our draw. The number 2 player and the 6’10” guy who would eventually go to NC State and Cincinnati immediately start freaking out.</p>

<p>“Guys, we have to stop TYUS. If we stop TYUS, we WIN.”</p>

<p>I didn’t know who Tyus was.</p>

<p>Well, it turns out that their tiny point guard who looked like a middle schooler was Tyus. That was clear to me when he had, not embellishing here, <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> at half-time and we were down by 25.</p>

<p>Tyus Jones didn’t just look like a middle schooler, he was one. He was going into his freshman year that summer.</p>

<p>The distance between NBA players and the best player you know is mind-boggling.</p>

<p>The worst NBA player is better at basketball than the most accomplished person you know is good at their thing, for literally 99.99% of all people.</p>

I played in a much smaller school (4A, but more like 3A because they always did some shenanigans with our school district classification because of the astronomical amount of young kids we had coming up through our primary schools at the time).</p>

<p>Anyway, we were at a summer league tournament somewhere… I can’t remember if it was around central AR or up around Northwest AR at the time, but we match up against Bobby Portis and his LR team there.</p>

<p>So my ass played the <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> on our High School team at a whopping 180lbs and 6’1. I felt like that feisty grade schooler going up against a nonchalant high school varsity star with Bobby towering over me at… I think our coach told us he (and another teammate of his) was 6’7 at the time. I’m, like, pressing my whole body weight into him while he just casually leans back into me and they run some high post split actions off of him around the elbow.</p>

<p>Pretty sure I got dunked on a number of times that game. I remember him looking so… Unenthused to be playing a team with such small players on it lmao. With the facial expression and body language of “we really gotta be playing these guys?”</p>

<p>We kept the score within 30 points, at least.</p>

      <label for="lk6cnqr" class="commentText"><p>I played against KAT in high school&hellip;I was like 5 foot and he just towered over me. The only reason I ended up at that game was some of the starting lineup on our team was on academic probation and many of the bench were too. I was an end of the bench guy that never really saw playing time. I didn&rsquo;t really care, my parents just told me to do a winter sport.</p>

<p>I still root for the guy though since he&rsquo;s from NJ.</p>

<p>We played a private catholic school with multiple 3* and 4* recruits a month into senior year. Unfortunately for us, most of these recruits played defense.</p>

<p>By halftime, our QB was on the way to the ER (8 sacks, broken femur) and our offensive line was in tears. There was no motivational speech. To start the 2nd half, I kicked the ball out of bounds and ran tf off the field. We lost 56-0. That was the end of my football career.</p>

<p>The skill gap is WIDE, each level has a large disparity in skill level. Large gap between normal HS player be great one. Large gap between great HS player vs productive college player. Large gap between productive college vs great college. HUGE gap between great college vs productive pro.</p>

<p>In college, we were a pretty good mid-major, made the tourney a couple times in a short span. We played the #1 team in the country, they had 4 future nba players. I have NEVER seen a group of players move so fast, most humbling experience of my life. We lost by 30+</p>

<p>Back in HS during a college summer camp we, at night the scrimmages were reserved for the top HS prospects mixed in with the college team. I was matched up vs a future nba player and slam dunk participant. It was a close game and he did not like that he was close to losing to trash like me. He drilled two nba 3’s in back to back possessions to widen the score.</p>

<p>The last score of the game; he gets the rebound off our miss, I pick up <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> court. He crossed me up, I fall to one knee. The HS players watching “Oooo”. I ain’t no punk, I recover as he is starting his drive. He gives me a shoulder nudge to make some space and takes off. I contest and he dunks all over me.</p>

<p>Crowd goes nuts, running on the court, ripping their shirts off. Thankfully this was before social media or else I would be infamous.</p>

After the NIT his senior year, he’d work out with a trainer in the student gym almost every day, and he’d frequently play in pickup games after he finished his drills. These guys are on another level. Like, it wasn’t Andrew Goudelock out there—it was God disguised as Andrew Goudelock. He could do whatever he wanted. Pull up 3s from half court, breaking ankles and yamming it on people’s heads, hitting stupid moonshot floaters in the lane, taking the ball from guys a la Kawhi on Ben McLemore. Humiliated myself more than once, but after a while, I’d get the nod whenever we passed each other on campus. It’s an ego trip when that happens and one of your buddies is like “why is HE giving YOU the nod?!” Good memories.</p>

<p>Austin rivers, Chandler parsons, Nick calathes, Dwight Powell, Brandon knight, Greg oden, Jason Williams, Shane Larkin, Aaron Gordon, Tacko, anfernee simons, and Marcus Jordan if you want to count that one lol. Probably a few more notable d1 players but that’s who I can think of off the top of my head in terms of nba names.</p>

<p>For the most part all of them were super cool dudes J Will was absolutely filthy even at his age. Austin rivers had one move his whole life (in/out crossover) and we sort of figured that one out so he wasn’t an issue to play against tbh. But his first step is stupid fast.</p>

<p>I think one of the biggest things people don’t realize is the difference in game IQ. Like there’s always gonna be dudes who can hoop and drop buckets. But when it gets to organized competitive basketball these guys all have that understanding as well and that’s what separates you from that next level. Also even the “unathletic” or “slow” guys are insanely explosive up against pretty much anyone else. It’s a combo of game awareness, skill, and athleticism. You can get away with one being above average but the other two have to be elite.</p>

      <label for="lk6kc1r" class="commentText"><p>I played at an elite level in D3 about a decade ago now (all-conference, 5’11”).</p>

<p>It’s interesting seeing the overlaps and discrepancies in the skill levels of D3, D2, D1, and NBA players. I’ve played with a variety of all of these in pickup and diffferent leagues throughout the years.</p>

<p>If i play with regular players who were pretty good in high school, or at the top tier of their rec league gym, i can pretty much do whatever I want on the court. It feels like everyone is just so many steps behind in IQ, speed, navigating the game.</p>

<p>When I play with D2 and D1 players, I can play the game naturally and contribute at a fine level. I can hit shots, get by some defenders, make some passes, and play at a level that feels pretty good. I can actually be pretty dominant sometimes.</p>

<p>But there are just some moves that higher level players do that make me realize - I could practice for 10 years and never pull  off some of those moves. There’s a natural instinct and ability amongst a lot of those players, even at a very young age.</p>

<p>The ball control and balance of NBA players is on such another level.</p>

<p>The big differences is defense, physicality, agility, and consistency. A combination of all of those are what put the higher level players tiers above the lower levels.</p>

<p>Played against D1, g league players and while outmatched, never felt worthless until I played against some random guy at the gym.  He was wayyy out of shape (6’5, probably 325 lbs), but watching that man move so gracefully, hit every shot, block every shot, and still only going at 50% was mesmerizing.

      <label for="lk6l0e9" class="commentText"><p>Your first story reminds me of one of the most unique experiences I&rsquo;ve had playing basketball.</p>

<p>I was playing pickup at the YMCA. I want to say i was around 15-16 years old at the time.</p>

<p>We were playing 5 on 5, and one of the people playing with use was really old. I&rsquo;m talking over 60.
You could tell he was older by looking at his face, but he had the body of a much younger man.</p>

<p>Anyways, this guy did not miss a single shot and always made to correct read on a play.</p>

<p>Defensively, he was slow footed due to his age. He got blown by a few times on drives, but any errant pass or sloppy dribble in his vicinity, he would get his massive hands on it and disrupt the play. Even though he wasn&rsquo;t jumping much, his combination of size and positioning made him an effective defender so long as he didn&rsquo;t get caught out on the perimeter.</p>

<p>After one of the games, I asked him where he learned to play like that. He told my friends and I that he played for the 1976 Canadian Olympic team.</p>

      <label for="lk791oj" class="commentText"><p>I played division 1 ball at Weber State in the late 2010’s. Before my freshman year I got a chance to play for the Blazers in the Drew League. I played with Kenneth Farried. He would catch lobs and windmill them with his head over the rim. I played against Javale Mcgee, who blocked everything inside the paint that anyone threw up. Nick Young and James Harden were about the same level at this point, maybe James wasn’t trying very hard, but the skill level was just insane. My college shooting splits were 50/30/75 as a 6’6” forward, and I felt like I was learning how to play basketball again. It made playing in college feel like high school. I was still able to score between 5 to 9 points per game there, keep in mind I was 18, but it was just a different game. The craziest experience I had was playing against Mater Dei in the first round of the state playoffs my Sophmore year. My matchup was Stanley Johnson. It was at that point I decided I was going to go to law school, haha. Breaking my foot in college and transferring schools 3 times solidified the need to graduate and get my degree to pursue ventures outside of basketball.</p>

<p>In summary, even as a mid/high level D1 athlete, the natural ability and work ethic of these guys was awesome.</p>

      <label for="lk66umy" class="commentText"><p>Played against Pat McCaw in high school. Oddly enough dude was pretty mid, like he was good but not NBA player good. There were a couple of guys on his team that were better.</p>

<p>MPJ would hop in some rec runs in college. Now he was fucking unreal, dude would casually pull up from half court and drain bombs. If he was playing a little serious, no one could score cuz he’d just block everything.</p>

      <label for="lk67xpt" class="commentText"><p>I was a ballboy and would play 1-1 from time to time with guys warming up before practice or way before games. I&rsquo;m playing as hard as I can - they are going like 50% at best so I was sorta competitive. Once a guy beats me off the dribble and does one of those layups where he doesn&rsquo;t really jump and I block his shot. Hey was like - hey look at you, you&rsquo;ve got some hops. But he was pissed I blocked his shot and proceeded to absolutely obliterate me from that point forward. I couldn&rsquo;t so much as dribble.</p>

<p>This man did not miss a single shot outside of the three point line.</p>

<p>We did a little half court contest with him for fun and he was hitting it like a simple jumpshot, consistently.</p>

<p>We got cooked by like 50, the team was stacked and I remember him basically just not missing a shot.</p>

Dude torched us haha never really tried was there for a run and to get shots up. I got to play on his squad at one point and I got a steal, saw him trailing so I lobbed it off backboard. He snagged it one hand and threw it down pretty hard. I felt like wade tossing to bron 😅</p>

      <label for="lk6rys2" class="commentText"><p>My dad played in a league. One day Steve Kerr played on the other team - they were nice about it and asked everyone if it was ok for him to play. He said Kerr was obviously really good, but that he was sort of deferring and being more of a passer. Seems like he was being a good guy not trying to dominate and just have fun with his friends.</p>

      <label for="lk6lqwz" class="commentText"><p>The time I realized &ldquo;there&rsquo;s levels to this&hellip; and I&rsquo;m so far below these guys&rdquo; was playing really casual pickup again (for him, not us) against a guy who rode the bench at a D3 school. He&rsquo;d pull up from 40 (this 20 years ago, so it was not normal like it is today) and swish, blow by everyone, not every trying, not breaking a sweat but embarrassed everyone so badly that it was demoralizing. I cannot imagine how much better NBA players are. This 6-2 backup D3 guard was so much better than us that we could not fathom being on his level. But he is so many levels below the NBA. Crazy.</p>

      <label for="lk6cgdv" class="commentText"><p>Played against a few NBA/college players when I was younger. The skill difference is just other worldy. Luther head used to play at a gym downtown and would play 21 sometimes if there was not too many ppl. There were some college players sometimes that would try to hold him and they couldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>He would say stuff like &ldquo;I can only shoot fadeaway bank shot 3 pointers&rdquo; and still win. Obviously we still tried to play him straight up and not foul him and stuff; I write this because there are enough ppl who would say shit like they&rsquo;d get into his landing zone and stuff if he tried that.</p>

<p>Watched Eddie Griffin (rest in peace) a bunch when he was doing community service at my university. He could splash easily from 35 feet away open.</p>

<p>It was always a good feeling when we played against someone much better and got a bucket or stopped but we all knew they weren&rsquo;t ever trying.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t really count but I played against Vince Young for pick up before and was able to put him on skates on one play and was probably a little too amped about it. Dude trucked me good for a score the next possession. Quickly reminded me to be humble.</p>

      <label for="lk6nggq" class="commentText"><p>Played against Devin Booker the summer before he went to Kentucky in a charity tournament in Moss Point, MS (I was 24-25). We had a collection of the best guys from our high school over a 5-7 year period. A couple NAIA guys. All very good Rec league players. Book had a similar level of guys surrounding him.</p>

<p>We lost 120-75 in a running clock 20 minute half game. He got to whatever spot he wanted whenever he wanted. I guarded him for a decent portion of the game, and it was one of the coolest experiences ever getting absolutely wrecked by a future NBA star going 60% speed. If I gave him space, he’d launch from 25ft. If I pressed up, he’d casually maneuver around me, get shoulder to shoulder, and either nudge me off for a jumper or get to the rim. It was just whatever he felt like doing.</p>

<p>I had played against legit D1 guys before, so I knew what would happen, but it was still awesome up close.</p>
