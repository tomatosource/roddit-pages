      <label for="lk675vx" class="commentText"><p>I went to a state school and we made march madness one season (16 seed). Our star was conference player of the year.</p>

<p>I played pickup with him once at the gym and he was clearly half assing it, he was unbelievable. Could just glide and rise to the rim. Made passes and reads correctly every time. Felt like it was no effort. I remember when he made a beautiful kick out to me behind the arc and my first thought was just “don’t air ball this shit”.</p>

<p>Our starting center was playing that game too. His precision skills weren’t the same, obviously, but as a short guy on the court, playing with someone that was around 6’8”+ it was laughable how he could just command the paint however he wanted.</p>

Dude drove right and I hip checked him out of the lane but he still took me to the rack. I went for the block and he wrapped under the rim and dunked and 1 all over me. The gym cleared out and the game was over. A random dude 2 minutes later asked me why I tried to jump with Lamont Strothers. I had no idea who that was but apparently he went to my college and played in the NBA a few years. Occasionally came back to school to make clowns out of idiots like me.</p>

<p>Also played with and against Ron Baker at the rec in college. Actually contested a step back jumper from him and got a finger to it. They beat us by a few, I was walking off the court and he tapped me and said hey we need one more. Guess I had done enough to earn a little respect that day. Played like 2-3 games with him before he dipped for the day. He was obviously going nowhere near all out. But just incredibly solid player all around.</p>

Chet is also annoying the way he talks.  I grew up in a black neighborhood as a Mexican/ white kid.  I still talked like a Mexican/ white kid. Light texas accent and everything.  I met a lot of white kids in high school that talked like that cause they wish they were black. It was annoying and came across as condescending and corny  to me and many of my friends who happened to be black. Trying to get cool points by talking like that when that&rsquo;s not how you naturally talk is cringy as fuck.</p>

      <label for="lk62o0c" class="commentText"><p>One day during the first week of freshman year at Indiana University, I go to the gym to play basketball. I get there and Neil Reed, Richard Mandeville, and Brian Evans were on Court 1, where all the really talented players would play. Neil Reed said, “We need 2”, and me and another random guy both raised our hands immediately, and they wave us over. It was obvious that they didn’t care who came out there to make 5, they just wanted someone, because I’m 5’10”, skinny, no hops, and an extremely questionable jump shot.  Didn’t matter.  Brian Evans shot (and made) from literally everywhere. We won 10 games in a row very comfortably and basically all I did was inbound the ball, occasionally catch a pass and immediately pass to someone else.</p>

So cool one day I bring my old cheap Reebok basketball shoes and me him and these other two short guys playing casual 2 v 2. All good we were just killing time he wasn’t trying but he can obviously dunk - then randomly his cousin calls “hey cuz I’m in the area what’s up” “nothing just playing ball with classmates” “Oh cool can I join - I got my gear in the car.” Half hour later his taller Sudanese cousins turns up - it’s Thon Maker. Was cool and they obviously played against each other and mostly half paced in the low post then I had to go class and they went to get lunch together</p>

I played in a much smaller school (4A, but more like 3A because they always did some shenanigans with our school district classification because of the astronomical amount of young kids we had coming up through our primary schools at the time).</p>

<p>Anyway, we were at a summer league tournament somewhere… I can’t remember if it was around central AR or up around Northwest AR at the time, but we match up against Bobby Portis and his LR team there.</p>

<p>So my ass played the <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> on our High School team at a whopping 180lbs and 6’1. I felt like that feisty grade schooler going up against a nonchalant high school varsity star with Bobby towering over me at… I think our coach told us he (and another teammate of his) was 6’7 at the time. I’m, like, pressing my whole body weight into him while he just casually leans back into me and they run some high post split actions off of him around the elbow.</p>

<p>Pretty sure I got dunked on a number of times that game. I remember him looking so… Unenthused to be playing a team with such small players on it lmao. With the facial expression and body language of “we really gotta be playing these guys?”</p>

<p>We kept the score within 30 points, at least.</p>

I don’t remember much. At the time I didn’t know what was going on. All I knew was that we were playing against a really good freshman. I had no idea he’d turn out to be Kyrie. Anyway, it was a scrimmage but he gave us 40. I’m not even sure if I got in the game as I was the only freshman on the varsity squad.</p>

<p>MPJ would hop in some rec runs in college. Now he was fucking unreal, dude would casually pull up from half court and drain bombs. If he was playing a little serious, no one could score cuz he’d just block everything.</p>

<p>My college friends played D3 and I would largely get destroyed by them. But I could stay in front of them. They’d just shoot quicker than I could get a hand up, or pass into a play I never saw developing.</p>

<p>But Lonnie made me actively avoid him. Like I didn’t want to be on YouTube getting clowned.</p>

<p>That Scalabrine quote hit me hard that day.</p>

<p>Played against D1, g league players and while outmatched, never felt worthless until I played against some random guy at the gym.  He was wayyy out of shape (6’5, probably 325 lbs), but watching that man move so gracefully, hit every shot, block every shot, and still only going at 50% was mesmerizing. First time it ever really hit me how insanely bad I’d be compared to real pros.</p>

      <label for="lk6alsd" class="commentText"><p>Went to college with Andrew Goudelock. The Mini-Mamba. After the NIT his senior year, he’d work out with a trainer in the student gym almost every day, and he’d frequently play in pickup games after he finished his drills. These guys are on another level. Like, it wasn’t Andrew Goudelock out there—it was God disguised as Andrew Goudelock. He could do whatever he wanted. Pull up 3s from half court, breaking ankles and yamming it on people’s heads, hitting stupid moonshot floaters in the lane, taking the ball from guys a la Kawhi on Ben McLemore. Humiliated myself more than once, but after a while, I’d get the nod whenever we passed each other on campus. It’s an ego trip when that happens and one of your buddies is like “why is HE giving YOU the nod?!” Good memories.</p>

<p>We got cooked by like 50, the team was stacked and I remember him basically just not missing a shot.</p>

      <label for="lk6cgdv" class="commentText"><p>Played against a few NBA/college players when I was younger. The skill difference is just other worldy. Luther head used to play at a gym downtown and would play 21 sometimes if there was not too many ppl. There were some college players sometimes that would try to hold him and they couldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>He would say stuff like &ldquo;I can only shoot fadeaway bank shot 3 pointers&rdquo; and still win. Obviously we still tried to play him straight up and not foul him and stuff; I write this because there are enough ppl who would say shit like they&rsquo;d get into his landing zone and stuff if he tried that.</p>

<p>Watched Eddie Griffin (rest in peace) a bunch when he was doing community service at my university. He could splash easily from 35 feet away open.</p>

<p>It was always a good feeling when we played against someone much better and got a bucket or stopped but we all knew they weren&rsquo;t ever trying.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t really count but I played against Vince Young for pick up before and was able to put him on skates on one play and was probably a little too amped about it. Dude trucked me good for a score the next possession. Quickly reminded me to be humble.</p>

The only reason I ended up at that game was some of the starting lineup on our team was on academic probation and many of the bench were too. I was an end of the bench guy that never really saw playing time. I didn&rsquo;t really care, my parents just told me to do a winter sport.</p>

<p>I still root for the guy though since he&rsquo;s from NJ.</p>

After he scored the one, Stro started to try a little but was still only half-assigng it and I don’t think my friend got another shot off but he can always say he got the one.  It wasn’t even close, he just got bodied and put in the basket or got shot over and he is a decent size human being by non-nba standards(6-4, probably 200lb at the time).</p>

      <label for="lk6dv8b" class="commentText"><p>I played pickup basketball with Stephon Marbury. This was in Ft. Jackson, SC during my training (summer 2001). Just a guy in my platoon claimed Starbury was his cousin or something, everyone assumed it was bullshit and never paid attention to it. We played pickup games on the evenings and weekends.</p>

<p>Sure as shit, one day he showed up. Really chill, just played with us for an hour. I have no measure for how stupidly good he was. I was a former average HS basketball player, generally good enough to run with most pickup games. The speed, handles, and shooting that he possessed were so far away from anyone that it wasn’t really a game.</p>

<p>Couldn’t even play HORSE with that mf’er.</p>

<p>But he was totally cool, down to earth, lots of laughing and fun.</p>

Also played with Danny Fortson and Melvin Levitt, Melvin put on a dunk constant for us.</p>

We knew about him of course and had a defensive scheme we hoped could slow him down. I remember coming into the locker room at half time and we were down 16 or something. I was thinking, “We did alright! He didn’t do too much and we’re not totally out of this game!” Then the assistant coach came in with the stats. He had like 24 points and 13 rebounds at the half! He was just casually doing anything he wanted I guess.</p>

I’m pretty sure high school or right after was the last time we played together, but he was just a normal ball player lol. Just better than most of us. But there were a lot of people like that. Growing up in New Jersey, high school basketball is kind of a “thing”, so a lot of really good to great players could be found. These guys aren’t superhuman or anything lol…they just work really fucking hard and have the right combination of size and skill. I know a few guys, if sized differently, that could compete with normal NBA guys (not the superstars lol)</p>

      <label for="lk6ew2z" class="commentText"><p>Excluding HS, when I played against a couple of would be pros, I played pretty consistently in a summer league once Matt Bonner was a pro, against him.
As an NBA fan, and someone who played against him in HS, I felt that Bonner had a solid, if one dimensional, career. Amazing shooter, fine rebounder, big body out there to stretch the floor.
This summer league had a handful of D1 players, top tier D2 players, and average players (like myself). It was as though Bonner was always playing a video game on easy mode.
Could he shoot from anywhere and make anything? Yes. And he did. But he also had better handle than any D1 PG on the court (and he’s a no handle bumbling nba big man). He moved faster than everyone. He passed better.
The “weakest” basketball skills of “role players” (if he is one) have, in my experience, have been multitudes better than the strongest skills of the next tier of player.</p>

Unreal to watch. I remember telling my friends he’s was going to the league. His court was completely packed with spectators and even some parents stopped watching their kids play to watch him.

      <label for="lk6f8i0" class="commentText"><p>Played against a handful of nba dudes and teammates with a few more in high school and the aau circuit. Also some exposure camps and local pro ams.</p>

<p>Austin rivers, Chandler parsons, Nick calathes, Dwight Powell, Brandon knight, Greg oden, Jason Williams, Shane Larkin, Aaron Gordon, Tacko, anfernee simons, and Marcus Jordan if you want to count that one lol. Probably a few more notable d1 players but that’s who I can think of off the top of my head in terms of nba names.</p>

<p>For the most part all of them were super cool dudes J Will was absolutely filthy even at his age. Austin rivers had one move his whole life (in/out crossover) and we sort of figured that one out so he wasn’t an issue to play against tbh. But his first step is stupid fast.</p>

<p>I think one of the biggest things people don’t realize is the difference in game IQ. Like there’s always gonna be dudes who can hoop and drop buckets. But when it gets to organized competitive basketball these guys all have that understanding as well and that’s what separates you from that next level. Also even the “unathletic” or “slow” guys are insanely explosive up against pretty much anyone else. It’s a combo of game awareness, skill, and athleticism. You can get away with one being above average but the other two have to be elite.</p>

<p>He played in a parents vs faculty charity game where a Kurt Goveia (NFL linebacker for 91 Redskins) played for the faculty.  Kurt got real competitive once this guy started touching him and pulling out street ball tricks.</p>

<p>The entire team was good, most everyone went D1 or D2 (i played lacrosse instead) so it&rsquo;s not like they were more locked in than others. Tbh the two that I remember who put in the most effort and practiced the most after team practice didn&rsquo;t play much at all.</p>

<p>The two players that i played against that i remember being different were Dave Romney and Gyasi Zardes. They weren&rsquo;t any better than my best teammates but they were both unbelievably athletic. Fast af and big.</p>

      <label for="lk6h4a3" class="commentText"><p>I played with a WNBA player once who I won&rsquo;t name in a college pickup game. This was a while back so maybe the situation has changed, but I thought they were fairly average when compared to the other guys playing pick-up.</p>

      <label for="lk6hb4v" class="commentText"><p>I played against Chasson Randle (Stanford’s all time leading who played a few years in the league.) He was in 8th grade and came to one of our varsity open gyms. He was a friend of my sister so I was more just trying to get him to laugh, but even though he was undersized and not nearly strong enough, you could tell his game was polished and more than anything he was always a step ahead of what the defense was trying to do to stop his teams play. </p>

Crazy athletic too and just looks effortless. Also played a few WNBA all stars too, all just regular pickup games</p>

      <label for="lk6hqcw" class="commentText"><p>Played against Luke Ridnour as a senior in HS.  He might have been a freshman and was their starting guard.  Not only that, he absolutely cooked our guards, on defence as well as offence.</p>

<p>Also played against former Laker Rob Sacre at an open gym.  He was probably 17 at the time, and easily 6&rsquo;11 by then. Didn&rsquo;t seem like anything otherworldly talent wise, just a really big body.  Dunked on him hard.  Don&rsquo;t regret it at all.</p>

      <label for="lk6hwgh" class="commentText"><p>I played against Jeremy Sochan and his friends at my university rec center last year. The game was close, and his team only won because someone called a win by 2 when the score was 14-14 and every time he scored, my friend went down and scored, so the game went all the way to 21, and the final score was 19-21 he hit the game-winning three. He never came back cause his friends did not want him to be bombarded with students and fans.</p>

      <label for="lk6hxet" class="commentText"><p>Not an NBA player, but NFL. I played pick up against Elvis Dumervil back in college and he was a beast. I’ve got damn near a foot on him, but he could out jump me. Plus he was so strong and got so low he boxed me out and basically kept me from getting into the low post when I had the ball. <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>, would not want him guarding me again.</p>

      <label for="lk6i58l" class="commentText"><p>Played with and against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Childress" target="_blank">Josh Childress</a> at a 24hr Fitness gym in So Cal. At the time, the courts at this gym were highly competitive with lots of college players there and also some former NFL players. Would get there at like 5pm and there would be 30+ people waiting to play, if you lost your first game you just went home, cuz it was like 1-2 hour wait.</p>

<p>His brother started playing there and Josh came a couple times, I think when he was in between teams (or it was off season). Dude was tall and skinny but balled out everyone there with about 60% effort (you could tell he wasn&rsquo;t really trying). The difference between really really good gym heroes and a pro was just night and day. Was a nice guy, his brother was a bit of a dick.</p>
