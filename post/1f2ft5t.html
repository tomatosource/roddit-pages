      <label for="lk675vx" class="commentText"><p>I went to a state school and we made march madness one season (16 seed). Our star was conference player of the year.</p>

<p>I played pickup with him once at the gym and he was clearly half assing it, he was unbelievable. Could just glide and rise to the rim. Made passes and reads correctly every time. Felt like it was no effort. I remember when he made a beautiful kick out to me behind the arc and my first thought was just “don’t air ball this shit”.</p>

<p>Our starting center was playing that game too. His precision skills weren’t the same, obviously, but as a short guy on the court, playing with someone that was around 6’8”+ it was laughable how he could just command the paint however he wanted.</p>

Chet is also annoying the way he talks.  I grew up in a black neighborhood as a Mexican/ white kid.  I still talked like a Mexican/ white kid. Light texas accent and everything.  I met a lot of white kids in high school that talked like that cause they wish they were black. It was annoying and came across as condescending and corny  to me and many of my friends who happened to be black. Trying to get cool points by talking like that when that&rsquo;s not how you naturally talk is cringy as fuck.</p>

      <label for="lk658nk" class="commentText"><p>Bobby Portis played in one of the Little Rock, AR high schools (either North Little Rock, or Little Rock Hall) which are both the largest school classification in our state (7A). I played in a much smaller school (4A, but more like 3A because they always did some shenanigans with our school district classification because of the astronomical amount of young kids we had coming up through our primary schools at the time).</p>

<p>Anyway, we were at a summer league tournament somewhere… I can’t remember if it was around central AR or up around Northwest AR at the time, but we match up against Bobby Portis and his LR team there.</p>

<p>So my ass played the <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> on our High School team at a whopping 180lbs and 6’1. I felt like that feisty grade schooler going up against a nonchalant high school varsity star with Bobby towering over me at… I think our coach told us he (and another teammate of his) was 6’7 at the time. I’m, like, pressing my whole body weight into him while he just casually leans back into me and they run some high post split actions off of him around the elbow.</p>

<p>Pretty sure I got dunked on a number of times that game. I remember him looking so… Unenthused to be playing a team with such small players on it lmao. With the facial expression and body language of “we really gotta be playing these guys?”</p>

<p>We kept the score within 30 points, at least.</p>

      <label for="lk62o0c" class="commentText"><p>One day during the first week of freshman year at Indiana University, I go to the gym to play basketball. I get there and Neil Reed, Richard Mandeville, and Brian Evans were on Court 1, where all the really talented players would play. Neil Reed said, “We need 2”, and me and another random guy both raised our hands immediately, and they wave us over. It was obvious that they didn’t care who came out there to make 5, they just wanted someone, because I’m 5’10”, skinny, no hops, and an extremely questionable jump shot.  Didn’t matter.  Brian Evans shot (and made) from literally everywhere. We won 10 games in a row very comfortably and basically all I did was inbound the ball, occasionally catch a pass and immediately pass to someone else.</p>

      <label for="lk66b9f" class="commentText"><p>When I was studying at UNSW in Australia I had a Sudanese class mate who liked playing ball and was very tall - he knew I liked watching NBA during lectures (games start 11am local time) so he suggested we go play ball at the open courts in between classes. So cool one day I bring my old cheap Reebok basketball shoes and me him and these other two short guys playing casual 2 v 2. All good we were just killing time he wasn’t trying but he can obviously dunk - then randomly his cousin calls “hey cuz I’m in the area what’s up” “nothing just playing ball with classmates” “Oh cool can I join - I got my gear in the car.” Half hour later his taller Sudanese cousins turns up - it’s Thon Maker. Was cool and they obviously played against each other and mostly half paced in the low post then I had to go class and they went to get lunch together</p>

      <label for="lk64od1" class="commentText"><p>Played Sean Rooks in an adult league. Couldn’t get any rebounds cause of how big he was and he was hitting high school 3’s like crazy cause that’s a mid range jumper to him. Sugar Shane Mosley was on his team too and set the hardest screens I’ve ever experienced. We didn’t win the game.</p>

<p>Played against Casey Jacobsen in high school and if he had any space he was pretty much guaranteed to make his jumpers.</p>

I was our best defensive player, so I&rsquo;d get to be cooked for about 30+ minutes of game time. Biggest name was probably Jarryd Bayless. I remember him most because I played 38 straight minutes against him and &ldquo;held&rdquo; him to 30-something points on 50-60% shooting.</p>

<p>I played pickup against Mike Bibby after his career. Dude was a freak even then.</p>

<p>MPJ would hop in some rec runs in college. Now he was fucking unreal, dude would casually pull up from half court and drain bombs. If he was playing a little serious, no one could score cuz he’d just block everything.</p>

<p>He didn’t have an amazing NBA career but compare to us average joes he looks and even plays like a god amongst men.</p>

<p>Around summer 2012ish he went to a local LA Fitness and I had to peep it. Made everybody look silly as you can expect. Way taller than everyone, way faster than everyone and way better than everyone.</p>

      <label for="lk67gl3" class="commentText"><p>When I was a freshman in high school, I played against Kyrie. He, too, was a freshman and played for a school named Montclair Kimberley Academy. I don’t remember much. At the time I didn’t know what was going on. All I knew was that we were playing against a really good freshman. I had no idea he’d turn out to be Kyrie. Anyway, it was a scrimmage but he gave us 40. I’m not even sure if I got in the game as I was the only freshman on the varsity squad.</p>
