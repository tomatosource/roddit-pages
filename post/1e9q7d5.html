If it was all Pelinka&rsquo;s decision to just not pay Caruso and to trade KCP, Kuzma, Trez and a 1st for Westbrook then he should have been fired years ago, but it&rsquo;s a decent possibility those weren&rsquo;t his decisions (or entirely his decisions).</p>

<p>How about the stuff where the Lakers didn&rsquo;t do want Lebron wanted them to do? (ty-lue, kyrie)</p>

<p>Lebron probably does more good than bad off the court but since that hurts certain agendas the media has taken a policy of &ldquo;if bad, lebron did it, if good it was the front office&rdquo; and frankly given how frequently lebron doesn&rsquo;t get his way in la, it&rsquo;s wierd they&rsquo;re still on it.</p>

<p>Lebron also was reported for pushing for phil handy to be hired.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really got a problem giving lakers fo some credit, but &ldquo;everything lakers do well is inspite of lebron and everything they do badly is because of lebron&rdquo; stops making sense if you look into it for like 2 seconds (&ldquo;so lebron really wanted jj, but also directly called jj&rsquo;s competition?&rdquo;).</p>

Westbrook was already under contract so a trade for him didn&rsquo;t come with a hard cap, and I&rsquo;m sure that was a big factor.</p>

      <label for="lehcv03" class="commentText"><p>But is that because Jeanie told Pelinka not to bring him back no matter what? Unlikely. Or did she say &ldquo;you can only spend this much&rdquo;? Probably more likely. And if that happened, who&rsquo;s choice was it to choose THT over Caruso? THT was a Klutch client, so maybe LeBron made that choice? Or maybe it was all Pelinka?</p>

<p>My point is nobody really knows who is making which calls for the Lakers, as it seems like they don&rsquo;t have just one sole decision maker, but instead that gets spread around a lot. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s tough for me to blame or credit any one person for anything they do, cause we don&rsquo;t know who made which decisions.</p>

Ham&rsquo;s insistence on using Prince at SF for much of the year probably cost the Lakers 5+ regular season wins, because the rebounding with Prince was just so bad. If JJ doesn&rsquo;t have all the injuries that Ham had last year (namely with Vando and Gabe), and if he&rsquo;s not a complete idiot, the Lakers should play better this year than they did last year. But they still need to make roster upgrades if they want to have a shot any kind of top level competing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m guessing having to try to guard Jokic one on one probably had him exhausted. This is why the Lakers desperately need more size. They needed it last year too, and having both Wood and Vando out injured really, really hurt them against Denver. It was basically AD, Rui and LeBron to try to guard Jokic and Gordon, they really could have used another player or two. I wish Ham had given Hayes some more minutes, even though his limitations are pretty obvious. They just needed someone else in there to help give those other guys a bit of a breather.</p>

      <label for="lehbjaw" class="commentText"><p>I love how you guys just think a bench is totally irrelevant lol Rui, LeBron and AD started, and Ham refused to play Hayes, so coming off the bench in the frontcourt the Lakers only had Prince, that&rsquo;s it. Wood ain&rsquo;t great, and the Lakers should have tried to trade for a better frontcourt player (and still should), but having <em>someone</em> who could defend the rim and rebound, even a little bit, would have been better than the nobody the Lakers had instead.</p>

      <label for="legch7r" class="commentText"><p>The rotations have been brutal. Bam and AD are great defensively on the 2nd unit, but the spacing is terrible. Stating AD and moving Embiid to the bench with Bam helps the spacing a ton. Hali also needs to play on the 2nd unit because he&rsquo;s the best (or 2nd best to Lebron) playmaker on the team. Ant, Book, White, Jrue, and Tatum aren&rsquo;t going to consistently generate good looks unless they&rsquo;re playing 5 out.</p>

<p>Also maybe the NBA thing of lolball for 2+ quarters in a regular season game and then going hard in the third and fourth.</p>

The US has only been together like this for a couple weeks. Hopefully Kerr&rsquo;s lineups will improve once the games actually mean something. Too much small ball so far.</p>

But it takes them some time to realize this isn’t a race to 150. They’re going up against teams that have played together for years, with real talent and chemistry, who are there to prove something.</p>

The minutes look restricted too so that every player gets to play, I doubt they’ll have some of these stars subbed out for that long in the actual games.</p>

Like, hello, he&rsquo;s an All NBA player, shouldn&rsquo;t he be a big part of them winning games? LeBron is obviously still incredible, should the US not be relying on him at all?</p>

All time greats were out of the league and/or washed years long before his age &amp; tenure in the league. It’s absurd. Years leading up to Lebron breaking the scoring record people were trying to project his numbers based on standard rates of decline and despite all the naysayers, all those estimates were still WAAAAAY too conservative.</p>

<p>In his 21st year in the NBA, he played 71 games, averaging 26/7/8 on 63% TS (3rd best shooting year of his career), and instead of taking the summer off to recover, he’s now LEADING (in every sense of the word) the USA Olympics team. That’s absolutely nuts. Anyone that says they knew it was going to happen years ago is just straight up lying.</p>

<p>Usually, the only time this sub doesn’t downvote or at least obsessively argue against commenters claiming LeBron as the GOAT is when he has impressive nights and Redditors post threads of his recent highlights. When it’s just a regular day, most of the time this sub argues vehemently against it. But, at this point, that has to at least start to change because LeBron’s continued career is getting ridiculous.</p>

I watched the live game and they showed the slow motion, when he jumped, his body was moving and leaning to the left, and yet he used his left hand, which was farther away from the basket than his right hand to do the layup. He was basically countering his body&rsquo;s momentum. That was some kyrie level move</p>

Joe Rogan, who is a dipshit but a dipshit that knows MMA, once said we were all lucky he didn’t choose fighting at a rough age. He would have hurt some people with that god given athleticism. Like fucking shadow realm blows would be landed. Deyonte wilder type shit. Just a whap! That’s what 260 of lean muscle feels like when it hits you at full speed. because of the size and speed he possesses. Some people are just freaks. Brock lesnar, Lebron James, Francis ngannu, Alex perriera, just physically massive and full of speed and power. If it hits you, it hurts you type size.</p>

<p>I do get that those other guys are able to compete harder for most of the year, but Bron to me is still the player I’d pick to win any game. I’d only really consider Jokic over him or maybe Luka.</p>
