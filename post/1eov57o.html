      <p>I enjoy watching old 80s and 90s games, which even with the NBA pass, are difficult to find, and I&rsquo;ve gotta be honest with myself, we either look back with rose colored glasses or we haven&rsquo;t watched these games since we were younger.  I imagined myself having a watch party at first, but after the first few matches, I reluctantly realized my group would be bored.  There really is no way to put this without hurting feelings, but I&rsquo;m curious if anyone else has gone back, recently, and watched the USA/Croatia gold match?  I appreciate any comments.</p>

      <label for="lhg1vit" class="commentText"><p>well yeah them blowing out random poor international teams is probably boring, which was why the last USA match was that entertaining.</p>

<p>but in general i agree, way to many people romanticize past games. this happens to everyone though, we only remember the cool moments from each game and not the ridiculous amounts of free throws and wasted possessions. i watched some quarters of games in the 60s/70s and even in the 90s and i dunno, there may be more &ldquo;selling&rdquo; calls today but the whistle was getting blown way more in the past imo.</p>

<p>Having lived through multiple generations myself, I think what you&rsquo;ll discover as you grow older is that every generation feels refined until the next generation comes along. So then the question becomes: When an even more refined era of NBA basketball inevitably comes along (let&rsquo;s say the mid 2030s), will we then look back at 2010s basketball and render it boring and unwatchable?</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;ve found is the minute we feel like a generation is beyond reproach, a newer generation comes along and proves us wrong.</p>

      <label for="lhgk134" class="commentText"><p>Oh for sure. I certainly have my qualms with today&rsquo;s game. I had my qualms with 2010s basketball, 2000s basketball, and 1990s basketball, too.</p>

<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s kind of my point. No generation played flawless hoops but fans of the game tended to take the good with the bad and love it for what it is. I was a basketball fan in &lsquo;93 and I&rsquo;m a basketball fan in &lsquo;24. In terms of how entertained fans were in each given year, there&rsquo;s a lot more similarities than differences.</p>

<p>That being said, as the context of generations gone by begins to slip away—as younger fans become less and less familiar with anything beyond highlights, great moments, and the superstars—what often gets left behind is the criticisms and agendas. And truthfully, I do not think any generation is immune, for it&rsquo;s just a matter of time before someone 10 years from now looks back at James Harden foul baiting lowlights and trivializes the achievements of an entire era for it.</p>

      <label for="lhgqb0e" class="commentText"><p>In theory, for sure. But I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re anywhere close to any kind of plateau.</p>

<p>Not to mention, the rules, interpretations, and guidelines change so fluidly over time that new elements to master and refine continually pop up. The cradle rock crossover couldn&rsquo;t be refined by pre-90s generations because it wasn&rsquo;t allowed, nor was the litany of moves involving the modern gather step (which looks like a third step to people who played under the old guidelines), or the double-stepback, or generous screens, self-lobs off the backboard, etc.</p>

<p>Which is all to say, it&rsquo;s likely safe to assume new wrinkles and rules will continue working their way into the game, which will then need to be mastered and refined, which will then make all previous generations look rudimentary by comparison.</p>

Triple doubles happen today because big dudes are able to have the ball in their hand on the perimeter and run the offense.

<p>I&rsquo;ve always felt that a lot of the joy many of us derive from watching games comes from our familiarity and connection with the teams and players participating.</p>

<p>I can watch Pistons games from any era—the no-defense &lsquo;84 team, the Bad Boys in &lsquo;89, the Hill era in &lsquo;97, the 2004 team winning games while scoring under 70, even the &lsquo;50s team in Ft. Wayne—it&rsquo;s all variably fun and enjoyable in its own way because it&rsquo;s teams and players I&rsquo;m invested in doing good things. Honestly, I&rsquo;ve had great moments watching mid-level high school and middle school basketball at times when I&rsquo;ve been invested in the players and teams involved as well.</p>

<p>On the flip side, if I don&rsquo;t know the players, teams, or context—or if I have no connection to them—or if my drive is to watch with a critical eye for the sake of spotting imperfections—then yeah, it doesn&rsquo;t feel quite as fun.</p>

<p>Pertaining to the &lsquo;92 Olympics specifically, I was alive for those games and I loved ever moment. Ditto &lsquo;96 and 2000. 2004&hellip; not so much (though I guess there was a degree of morbid curiosity in the latter).</p>

      <label for="lhgdbsq" class="commentText"><p>Basketball is such a young sport that it has evolved a ton in the last 32 years.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s why comparing players from different eras is a bit silly sometimes. Obviously the players are not gonna be shooting like Curry with handles like Kyrie 32 years ago. But todays basketball wouldn&rsquo;t be where it is if it wasn&rsquo;t for the players before them.</p>

<p>There are rule changes, play changes, coaching style changes, new players learn from watching the players before them. MJ&amp;gt;Kobe, for example. Without MJ, Kobe would have been a completly different ball player.</p>

<p>Personally I prefer to watch the late 90s/ 00&rsquo;s type basketball over todays basketball but I could see how someone who didn&rsquo;t grow up with it would find it boring.</p>
