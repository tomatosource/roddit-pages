<p>Because of the recent flooding of Kobe’s rape trial, I decided to do the actual research.</p>

<p>Misinformed people are bringing up Kobe’s rape trial to condemn him. I decided to actually do the research.</p>

<ul>
<li>There’s a myth that Kobe’s defense team leaked the name of Kobe’s accuser.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not true. Kobe’s lawyers were allowed, by the judge, to bring up Faber’s name. The Court and the Eagle County Justice Center’s staff accidentally leaked the name.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/judge-dont-call-kobe-bryant-accuser-victim" target="_blank">http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/judge-dont-call-kobe-bryant-accuser-victim</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Prosecutor dismissed a witness, without telling the defense,  simply because he contradicted their evidence.</li>
</ul>

<p>The sexual assault expert claimed jaw injury and vagina trauma are very much possible in consensual sex. Why is this so important? Prosecutor’s entire case was predicated on the neck injury and vaginal trauma. Weirdly enough, this is never mentioned among news sites attacking Bryant.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/09/03/authorities-defend-handling-kobe-case.html" target="_blank">http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/09/03/authorities-defend-handling-kobe-case.html</a></p>

<ul>
<li>The accuser had sex <strong>hours</strong>  after her encounter with Kobe Bryant.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, before you guys try to use the “Sexual assault victims can be very unpredictable” card, (Which is somewhat valid) before this evidence was revealed, the accuser and the prosecutor’s stances differed strongly from this. To exemplify, prosecutor tries to fight this evidence by saying she had sex BEFORE the encounter, but the forensic expert was very doubtful. If she had sex before the Kobe incident, there would be some DNA found on Kobe’s clothing; Nothing was found</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/big-win-for-kobe-defense/" target="_blank">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/big-win-for-kobe-defense/</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Before the actual trial took place, including the civil court, the accuser bragged about the money she was going to get from Kobe. .</li>
</ul>

<p>You know what’s worse? 3 days <strong>before</strong> Kobe was charged, she was seen by more than <strong>5</strong> people bragging about her encounter with Kobe.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/kobe-accuser-bragged-partygoer-happy-article-1.512242" target="_blank">http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/kobe-accuser-bragged-partygoer-happy-article-1.512242</a>

<ul>
<li>Her ex-friend reveals the accuser had celebrity addiction for a long time. She tried to do the same thing to Eminem. She also wanted to testify:</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.contactmusic.com/kobe-bryant/news/ex.pal-reveals-kobe.s-accuser-plotted-to-lure-eminem-into-bed" target="_blank">http://www.contactmusic.com/kobe-bryant/news/ex.pal-reveals-kobe.s-accuser-plotted-to-lure-eminem-into-bed</a></p>

<ul>
<li>She was seen leaving the hotel without any noticeable discomfort:</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kobe-records-released/" target="_blank">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kobe-records-released/</a></p>

<ul>
<li>She had a history of mental illness that was dangerous to herself and her peer:</li>
</ul>

<p>(This evidence would not be accepted in today’s court but was registered in 2004)</p>

<ul>
<li>The prosecutor lacked evidence. Not only evidence, they were badly losing against Kobe’s defense team:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>”This ruling will make it much, much tougher for prosecutors to convict Bryant of sexual assualt,’’ says legal analyst Cohen. “The physical evidence against him never was that strong to begin with and now this evidence is likely to tilt the ‘he said, she said’ battle squarely in Bryant’s favor.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/big-win-for-kobe-defense/" target="_blank">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/big-win-for-kobe-defense/</a></p>

<ul>
<li>The accuser lied and changed her story multiple times.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am okay with giving accusers the benefit of the doubt, but this was alarming. Because there was a witness who saw her without any visible discomfort (This is my assumption), she claimed she was forced to wash her face and settle down before leaving Kobe’s room. What’s even worse? she was given a chance to correct herself months after the initial statement; she continued the lie. She didn’t admit to her mistake for a whole year.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/kobe-accuser-mixups-admits-lies-claim-article-1.548757" target="_blank">http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/kobe-accuser-mixups-admits-lies-claim-article-1.548757</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Remember all the articles about the “blood” on Kobe’s shirt?</p></li>

<li><p>Oh yeah, Kobe’s Team was able to prove that the officers explicitly asked her why she didn’t say no t Kobe.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Relying on thick notebooks of police interviews and reports, Mackey proved that lead investigator Doug Winters had actually asked the victim why she hadn’t said no to Bryant’s sexual advances. Instead, Mackey entered into evidence the victim’s statement that she thought Bryant “might try to make a move” on her when she willingly entered his room at the Cordillera resort.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Finally, the settlement. People actually use this as Kobe’s confession.</li>
</ul>

<p>Kobe was strongly advised by his own defense team AND other prosecution to settle this case. Why? He could risk losing everything, and it does not help that he’s a black man. If he didn’t settle, it would take years for this case to conclude; his wife also had a miscarriage during this time. When you settle a case, it’s a compromise with you and the defendant; you don’t think the accuser wanted Kobe to say those things?</p>

<p>To substantiate this, the accuser asked for “unspecified amount of money, as well as public vindication.”. She got both in the settlement. The <strong>accuser</strong> is the one who wanted this comment.</p>

<p>As a user from this thread pointed out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its what the lawyers, from both sides, agreed to make Kobe sign to end it; it has nothing to do with Kobe’s actual feelings or the reality of the case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a settlement.</p>

<p>-———————————————————————————————————</p>

<p>Look, by all accounts, this was a false accusation. I will never say I am  100% certain, but I am sure enough that he did not rape this woman.</p>

<p>It’s really funny how the media changed narratives to fit their agendas. I have never seen them bring up how much the prosecution was insanely unethical to Kobe AND many of his witnesses. The prosecutor, Lin Wood, is also a horrific person.</p>

<p>Edit: Format, took out some needless comments, and added some new evidence.</p>

      <label for="ldzf8zb" class="commentText"><p>I mean sort of but not really. It’s pure he said she said case. They both admitted to having consensual sex and she claims Kobe did stuff during sex that wasn’t consensual he says he didn’t and then he said some lawyer speak in his settlement about how he understands how she would think she didn’t consent even if he felt she did in the moment. And this is without mentioning the mountain of stuff which paints her as a questionable source, including her own friends willing to testify against her.</p>

<p>It’s very possible it was rape im definitely not saying it 100% not only that we don’t know what truly happened, no one does, especially since it never went to a proper trial</p>
