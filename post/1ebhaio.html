<p>Gustin is a journalist who reports on news regarding Disney and it&rsquo;s properties.</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>Interested to see if anything comes from this. The Bubble was a crazy time for the NBA and it&rsquo;ll be cool to see both the experience of playing and living inside it.</p>

      <label for="letvq6n" class="commentText"><p>So the Lakers are penalized for being healthy both before and after the break? <strong>That doesn’t make any fucking sense</strong>.</p>

<p>They were the one seed before the Bubble and won the title in the Bubble. It’s not like they came out of nowhere and won the chip after getting healthy with their time off. They were dominant the entire year, they didn’t lose a single game that they went into the fourth quarter leading <strong>all year</strong>, they had just beaten two of their biggest presumed rivals heading into the shutdown, and they <strong>ran through</strong> the playoffs once the Bubble was underway.</p>

<p>If the Lakers got to get healthy, so did everyone else. And none of them held a candle to the dominance the Lakers displayed all season across the regular season &amp; post-season combined.</p>

<p>Y’all just want to tear it down because the two worst case scenarios happened for a lot of you: the Lakers won and LeBron won. Too bad, so sad.</p>

      <label for="leupoul" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that the Lakers won it&rsquo;s that we have evidence that they more than likely wouldn&rsquo;t have won because ever since then they&rsquo;ve been injured, basically every time the playoffs come around either LeBron AD or both of them get injured. I&rsquo;m not one to say they wouldn&rsquo;t have won but it&rsquo;s no coincidence that they&rsquo;ve had problems staying healthy ever since which means they more than likely would&rsquo;ve had health problems if the season continued normally. Same with the clippers that was the only year they were healthy as well they were just too dumb to take advantage like the Lakers did</p>

The 2020-2021 season sure but that was with a shortned off-season a lot of guys that went deep into the bubble the season before sustained injuries that season. You are just assuming they would’ve gotten hurt which is not a fair assumption. The lakers were the best team that entire season basically </p>

      <label for="leuwhnk" class="commentText"><p>I guess but some of those injuries in the past have been very flukish. LeBron has still been pretty healthy, you can question ADs health but if you take out tbe season after the bubble and the season in NO where pelicans at him cuz he was gonna get traded, he’s still played like 60ish games a season. </p>

<p>Neither bron or AD Were hurt before the break. We were in March when the season shut down too. Lakers had the best record so you assume the last week or so of the season they are probably sitting AD or LeBron. So it’s basically assuming that in like that 3 month period either LeBron or AD would get hurt? That’s kinda unfair Imo </p>

      <label for="leux43o" class="commentText"><p>the teams that went deep in the bubble dealt with injury issues the next year, not just the lakers due to the NBA having incredibly short turnaround time for the next season</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The league&rsquo;s 71-day offseason from its NBA Finals conclusion in mid-October to its resumption on Dec. 22 would mark the shortest offseason in the history of the NBA, NFL, NHL or MLB, according to Elias Sports Bureau data.</p>

<p>At just 72 days, it will be so by a margin of 55 days, beating the 2017-18 offseason, which was the previous shortest offseason ever at 127 days.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That coupled with bad luck like LeBron&rsquo;s injury in the Solomon Hill incident contributed to there being injury issues in the following years. The injuries the following years mean nothing towards the Lakers getting &ldquo;boosted&rdquo; health due to midseason break. If anything, Kawhi and the Clippers (considered biggest threat to Lakers in the West) were bigger beneficiaries due to his degenerative knee condition.</p>

      <label for="leu0fw7" class="commentText"><p>Playoffs were the same tho and just like the Lakers the dodgers lost their 1 seed HFA. Even if the season was normal length, are we really gonna doubt the dodgers ability to get top seeding in a full season when that is literally the most consistent thing they manage to do every year? Lol. The comeback from being down 3-1 to the braves was also insane especially without HFA</p>

      <label for="leutid0" class="commentText"><p>I’m not saying I count it as an asterisk title or it doesn’t count in my book I’m just saying it’s a completely different season and comparison to the nba. At least the NBA was able to play the majority of their season. Even with a pause. MLB played a 62 game season. You don’t know what injuries would’ve happened if they played an extra 100 games. Winning is all that matters and the dodgers did that but they did play 100 less games than normal so I think you have to at least mention that when talking about the dodgers </p>

Teams basically had injuries equalized, played in a neutral location so there was no home court or travel advantages in the games. It was just guys in a gym hooping. What could be more legit than that?</p>

      <label for="let6ql2" class="commentText"><p>think it&rsquo;s a little different when you&rsquo;re not an irrelevant player who&rsquo;s not in contention for anything meaningful. No disrespect to Adams, but he certainly wasn&rsquo;t focusing on trying to win a championship in the Bubble. If you know your team is just there to be there, then obviously the stakes and pressures are different.</p>
