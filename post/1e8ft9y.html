What is disturbing is a lot of these people can convince their victims that the abuse they suffer was deserved. If you have ever dealt with any abuser like this dude you should be triggered AF.</p>

      <label for="le70is5" class="commentText"><p>I just pulled up the picture, her nose doesn&rsquo;t look fractured at all tbh&hellip; I also read that the prosecutor didn&rsquo;t think they would be able to win at trial after looking at the evidence and the attorney for bridges stated that the prosecutor did the right thing because the evidence they had would prove his client&rsquo;s innocence.</p>

<p>The victim claimed that another women did it and switched her story to Bridges doing it days later.</p>

<p>I find it funny that if this was anyone but an NBA player we would write it off as false accusations which happens more often than people realize.</p>

<p>The bottom line is we weren&rsquo;t there and the prosecutor didn&rsquo;t presue it. I can tell you by working in law for over a decade that convicting Bridges of a crime like this would have been easy if he was actually abusing her, there is something more to this story that isn&rsquo;t being brought to light, probably to protect a third party or even the victim negotiating for this to go away after finding out she was lying.</p>

He plead no contest to one charge to make the other 2 go away but also the bargain agreed for no actual prison time, that&rsquo;s something that happens to people who have no way of proving they didn&rsquo;t do something. But you must understand, the woman agreed to this for a reason, she had to approve this bargain which meant there was something else to this case because he was looking at 10 years in prison. She was shielding someone else from involvement or maybe even her own actions by not bringing this to trial.</p>

<p>You’re looking at this from the starting point of her having some ulterior motive because…?</p>

<p>Besides, if you read further in the articles where I imagine you sourced the maximum sentencing, you will also see that the deal includes a 10-year protective order.</p>

<p>I assure you, that goes without saying. </p>

<p>Bridges already pled to the DV charges related to this. The case that was dropped by the state related to alleged violations of the protective order in place as a result of the underlying DV case. </p>

<p>A lot of things go without saying, but still need to be said.</p>

<p>Also,the DV charges were part of a plea bargain to drop the other 2 charges and he got out of it without doing any time. For some people that&rsquo;s good enough to make it go away even if they were innocent. All of this has happened without actual evidence connecting to Bridges for any crimes and the accuser has been caught lying along the way switching up her story during the actual DV case and this time the prosecutor shuts her down.</p>

<p>the outrage response is 99% proven incorrect and yet it always happens, it is a really fascinating study on behavioral economics. it has to do with people not putting forth the necessary effort to educate themselves on what they are talking about - yes i am talking about you.</p>

<p>now as for civil cases, those are even worse - i worked for a firm for 3 years in which we filed over a thousand cases and never went to trial once and settled about a dozen for muli million dollars in damages often paid by insurers to force us to go away. the cost of filing those claims were a few hundred dollars each so  you do the math. most of law is throwing shit on the wall and hoping something sticks - this was in complex litigation with a higher pleading standard so you can imagine what goes on in lower courts.</p>

Women DIE because of people like you, who would rather believe that all women are liars rather than believe men could ever abuse them. The criminal justice system is notorious for ignoring and downplaying the abuse women, but because a prosecutor decided not to pursue charges that means she’s a scheming liar?
