<p>If he was prime Lebron, sure. You’ll get a Deshaun Watson trade package. That’s how it works</p>

<p>He’s not. He’s a fine player, rotation starter&hellip; Whose market is artificially depressed  by virtue of him being a fuckface</p>

<p>I get the organization not wanting to lose the asset. But imo he’s not an asset given the circumstances</p>

      <label for="le70is5" class="commentText"><p>I just pulled up the picture, her nose doesn&rsquo;t look fractured at all tbh&hellip; I also read that the prosecutor didn&rsquo;t think they would be able to win at trial after looking at the evidence and the attorney for bridges stated that the prosecutor did the right thing because the evidence they had would prove his client&rsquo;s innocence.</p>

<p>The victim claimed that another women did it and switched her story to Bridges doing it days later.</p>

<p>I find it funny that if this was anyone but an NBA player we would write it off as false accusations which happens more often than people realize.</p>

<p>The bottom line is we weren&rsquo;t there and the prosecutor didn&rsquo;t presue it. I can tell you by working in law for over a decade that convicting Bridges of a crime like this would have been easy if he was actually abusing her, there is something more to this story that isn&rsquo;t being brought to light, probably to protect a third party or even the victim negotiating for this to go away after finding out she was lying.</p>

Done an image reverse search? You think they would have entered into a no contest plea if they had VERIFIABLE PROOF of the victim lying about her injuries?</p>

He plead no contest to one charge to make the other 2 go away but also the bargain agreed for no actual prison time, that&rsquo;s something that happens to people who have no way of proving they didn&rsquo;t do something. But you must understand, the woman agreed to this for a reason, she had to approve this bargain which meant there was something else to this case because he was looking at 10 years in prison. She was shielding someone else from involvement or maybe even her own actions by not bringing this to trial.</p>

<p>Besides, if you read further in the articles where I imagine you sourced the maximum sentencing, you will also see that the deal includes a 10-year protective order.</p>

      <label for="le71d6w" class="commentText"><p>I am not involved in the case whatsoever, but I do know that the prosecutor couldn&rsquo;t get a case together to even attempt to put him on trial. That&rsquo;s not lack of evidence, the prosecutor found something contradicting the story. Like I said, if everything was the way it appeared to us, Bridges would have been put on trial, the prosecutor found something that prevented him from bringing before a court which means a third party was involved or found evidence contradicting claims.</p>

<p>I assure you, that goes without saying. </p>

<p>Bridges already pled to the DV charges related to this. The case that was dropped by the state related to alleged violations of the protective order in place as a result of the underlying DV case. </p>

<p>A lot of things go without saying, but still need to be said.</p>

<p>Also,the DV charges were part of a plea bargain to drop the other 2 charges and he got out of it without doing any time. For some people that&rsquo;s good enough to make it go away even if they were innocent. All of this has happened without actual evidence connecting to Bridges for any crimes and the accuser has been caught lying along the way switching up her story during the actual DV case and this time the prosecutor shuts her down.</p>

<p>Yea that doesn&rsquo;t make sense for someone that&rsquo;s a public figure. Even a dumbass would know he already lost in the court of public opinion and the only way to avoid the abuse would be to win at trial. If he didn&rsquo;t do it he would fight it.

<p>now as for civil cases, those are even worse - i worked for a firm for 3 years in which we filed over a thousand cases and never went to trial once and settled about a dozen for muli million dollars in damages often paid by insurers to force us to go away. the cost of filing those claims were a few hundred dollars each so  you do the math. most of law is throwing shit on the wall and hoping something sticks - this was in complex litigation with a higher pleading standard so you can imagine what goes on in lower courts.</p>

      <label for="le78e5c" class="commentText"><p>i don&rsquo;t know why you decided to go from one extreme to another, this is a very specific case and tying it in with all other DV cases is the real injustice. i have helped put away people for DV and assaults and have volunteered to help victims on my own free time. the idea that all these cases should be judged with the same scope is absurd. both parties deserve to be heard in court, that is why lady justice is blindfolded.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely still something worth talking about but I can understand why it gets people less angry than a much more recent case, with a guy who is in the public eye at the time of the violence occurring, and has shown no interest in taking accountability.</p>

<p>I do think hiring a person who had an abuse case several decades prior, is a tad different than extending a guy who is actively denying he is an abuser at all right after he was convicted as such. Don’t you?</p>

<p>I can not believe Charlotte gave him a new multi-year contract. I know they&rsquo;re desperate, but they can&rsquo;t be <em>that</em> desperate.</p>

<p>Either he&rsquo;s lying or he genuinely doesn&rsquo;t understand what he did was wrong, and I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s worse.</p>
