What is disturbing is a lot of these people can convince their victims that the abuse they suffer was deserved. If you have ever dealt with any abuser like this dude you should be triggered AF.</p>

      <label for="le7khyj" class="commentText"><p>I guess this is a broader/more fundamental thing, but I so wish that reflection and personal accountability were better encouraged, particularly in young people.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in full support of second chances when the person actually reflects on their actions and desires to redeem themselves. I believe redemption is one of the most powerful, just, and beautiful processes a person can undergo.</p>

<p>Obviously in this case, Bridges does not appear to have reflected remorsefully on his actions, which is disappointing, and given his continued status as a millionaire athlete, that doesn&rsquo;t seem too likely to change. So I&rsquo;m not saying he deserves that chance as things currently stand. But knowing the number of people I know who seem so scared to ever question themselves, and seeing situations like this&hellip; We&rsquo;ve gotta find better ways to encourage empathy and the ability to acknowledge and make up for our failures. These are two of the most important qualities in a person, and I don&rsquo;t feel that many school or parents talk about them enough outside of little phrases like &ldquo;be nice to people,&rdquo; which, while fair, don&rsquo;t seem like enough for a lot of kids.</p>

      <label for="le7yway" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, if Bridges had been suspended without pay for, i don&rsquo;t know, a year or two, showed legitimate remorse for his actions, did stuff like community service and therapy, then cameback, i would have zero issues with him getting a second chance, but none of this happened.</p>

<p>Take Michael Vick, for example, he was in prison/suspended for two years and THEN cameback. I didn&rsquo;t follow the situation closely, so i don&rsquo;t know if he was truly remorseful for what he did, but he went to jail for 21 months and lost $20 million, he got punished for his actions (whether it was enough or not it&rsquo;s up for debate), i didn&rsquo;t mind him getting a second chance.</p>

<p>Man, if you didn&rsquo;t reflect on your bad actions, regretted them and (ideally) got punished for them, i don&rsquo;t wanna hear about no second chances, if none of that happened you don&rsquo;t deserve them.</p>

      <label for="le8c5lm" class="commentText"><p>Vick absolutely deserved another chance. He came from a broken area, and was unable to escape the shit people he grew up around, because he wanted to pull them up with him. The problem is they just kept doing the same shit before that they did before the money. Another issue is dog fighting is cultural. Doesn’t mean it’s okay, it’s very clearly not. But if you grow up at 2 years old watching dogs fight, you’re not gonna fully realize that it’s wrong, at least not the extent that an overwhelming majority of people do</p>

<p>Vick came out on the other side remorseful and reformed. He realized the error of his ways and tried to make better where he wronged. The action of what he did was awful, but I don’t think he was ever a bad guy, just participated in a bad thing. And he atoned, so that’s what matters imo</p>

<p>To remind everyone, he plead no contest to beating the daylights out of the mother of his children in front of their kids… and then later violated the restraining order by assaulting her car with billiard balls while the children were inside it. Frankly, the guy should be under house arrest.</p>

<p>Nah, hard disagree. Some things are just far more important than winning a game. He should be out of the league, either from a real ban or from no one signing him. The message the league is sending to all their young fans is shameful.</p>

<p><a href="https://gitnux.org/professional-athletes-domestic-violence-statistics/" target="_blank">77% of Domestic violence for athletes occurs by the NFL.</a></p>

<p>However,</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/wbna56109022" target="_blank">NFL has less than half the average rate of domestic violence and lower rates of all crime.</a></p>

<p>And the <a href="https://gitnux.org/professional-athletes-domestic-violence-statistics/" target="_blank">the NBA has a domestic violence arrest rate of 32 per 100,000. The NBA had 15 players involved in DV cases from 2010-2019</a></p>

<p>The rates get even lower for the MLB.</p>

<p>No US sports doesn&rsquo;t have a domestic violence problem, especially not the NBA. None of our major stars have problems either. Bron, Steph, Giannis, Embiid, Luka, Jokic, Ant, SGA, KD, PG, Kawhi, like the NBA is full of good guys.</p>

<p>Where are you getting your information from that this is common in professional sports?</p>

      <label for="le7k2uo" class="commentText"><p>I think this is missing the point. Yes, DV rates are substantially lower. However, when they <em>do</em> occur, athletes get way less consequences for them than someone in the general populace. Bridges got a slap on the wrist, so did the likes of Artest. As this tweet thread demonstrates, he also has learned nothing. The problem isn’t the frequency, the problem is that the league runs defense for abuse when it happens. When dealing with such public figures, what message does that send?</p>

<p>EDIT: will concede that singling out athletes among all rich and powerful people is a racial dog whistle and amend my statement. It’s bad that any of the rich get off scot free for domestic violence by virtue of their power, be they Wall Street consultants or NBA players. It’s unacceptable for these things to be swept under the rug, especially in cases like this where the offender clearly has not learned anything or meaningfully rehabilitated based on his statements. Smth ought to be done abt that rather than leaders like Silver sitting on their hands doing nothing. Not necessarily a lifetime ban but perhaps mandating contributions to funds for survivors of abuse</p>

<p>We have no idea if the finance guys on Wall Street or Fortune 500 ceos are committing domestic violence and they also have the means to lessen their own punishment.</p>

<p>Dana White smacked his wife in public, on video, hard  as shit and nothing happened.</p>

<p>Cops have some of the highest rates of domestic violence and are rarely prosecuted for it. <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/industrial-and-organizational-psychology/article/officerinvolved-domestic-violence-a-call-for-action-among-io-psychologists/2A39727AEB2041178781D027E7D365BE" target="_blank">Studies suggest that up to 40% of officer families experience domestic violence.</a></p>

<p>They&rsquo;re far more cops than pro-athletes and almost all of them are protected  by the justice system. Which group are there more of and regularly works with the people that are supposed to arrest and prosecute them?</p>

<p>If you want to have a talk about rich or powerful people  not being held accountable then fine, but we&rsquo;re not just limiting it to athletes. That&rsquo;s a racial dog whistle.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely still something worth talking about but I can understand why it gets people less angry than a much more recent case, with a guy who is in the public eye at the time of the violence occurring, and has shown no interest in taking accountability.</p>

He had multiple alcohol related incidents when he was younger and then he got his act together and has had no problems in over a decade. I’ll admit I was skeptical when I heard about it but by all accounts he has actually changed. If you look into the situation he apparently grabbed a woman by the neck in a bar. Still very bad but again he has shown remorse and hasn’t done anything else in a long time. I’m willing to give him the benefit of the doubt at this point. Bridges abused his actual partner and denies it. That’s totally different</p>

<p>EDIT: the Celtic fans are here to lie and downvote. Domestic Battery by simple definition means it was his GF, you dummies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Domestic battery. — Any person who unlawfully and intentionally makes physical contact of an insulting or provoking nature with his or her family or household member, or unlawfully and intentionally causes physical harm to his or her family or household member, is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be confined in jail for not more than twelve months or fined not more than $500, or both fined and confined.</p>

      <label for="le7s971" class="commentText"><p>The person above you is lying, anyways. It wasn&rsquo;t his GF and he didn&rsquo;t choke her &ldquo;out.&rdquo; He did grab the neck of a woman at a bar. But the huge difference is that he apologized, admitted he was wrong, got sober (he hasnt drank since then), and hasn&rsquo;t done anything else.</p>

<p>Personally, I think there is a pretty massive difference there. What he did was still wrong, but he&rsquo;s seemingly turned his life around. The same can&rsquo;t be said of Bridges.</p>

      <label for="le80uiw" class="commentText"><p>I really don’t think most players care that much. Honestly there are big parts of the country (none of whom are on Reddit) that don’t care that much. Case in point: Chris Brown apparently has an event scheduled in my town and people were getting all mad on Facebook and this elderly woman chimes in to say she doesn’t care and everyone fights and Rihanna probably gave him a good fight too. I think a lot of people feel that way.</p>

<p>Along with advanced AI, we&rsquo;re fucked. Nobody believes anything anymore. Chris Brown destroyed Rihanna&rsquo;s face but it was the fucking media tricking me? Like I ever gave a fuck about Chris Brown lol</p>

<p>How old are these people? I remember Chris Brown being on The OC, back when he was still considered wholesome</p>

<p>Ugh, people suck. Especially when it comes to abuse. I&rsquo;m a survivor of child abuse, it&rsquo;s incredibly demeaning to people like me when the abusers are given passes <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub></p>

<p>Miles Bridges&rsquo; kid is on tape, &ldquo;daddy choked mommy.&rdquo; Fuck this bitch for his &ldquo;never abused anybody&rdquo; shit. TNT has one more year, let Chuck go after Silver again for allowing this shit</p>

      <label for="le7dcpt" class="commentText"><p>Redeemable is the wrong word, but this is a bad comparison.  Ron Artest acknowledged he had serious problems with mental illness, starting seeing a psychiatrist regularly, went on some serious anti-psychotics, and talks publicly about it from a place of remorse and continuing constructive effort.  He doesn’t get a pass for the things he did before he sought help, but it’s a hell of a lot more sympathetic than this asshole Bridges posting “didn’t abuse nobody” when he provably and brutally did.  If Miles Bridges takes a break from basketball to work on his mental health with a serious professional, put himself on a brutal medication, and started acknowledging his wrongs, we could talk about “redeemable”.</p>

<p>Or maybe you’re just one of those people on the internet who likes pointing out that everyone is a hypocrite so you can act like nothing really matters.</p>

<p>There are a lot of teams that would not sign him for this. Be one of those teams, let the other franchises broadcast how little of a shit they give about about women instead. Hornets got a culture to fix too, but it&rsquo;s not even about that.</p>

<p>I can not believe Charlotte gave him a new multi-year contract. I know they&rsquo;re desperate, but they can&rsquo;t be <em>that</em> desperate.</p>

<p>Either he&rsquo;s lying or he genuinely doesn&rsquo;t understand what he did was wrong, and I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s worse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The election is stolen&rdquo; even if there&rsquo;s no evidence and the courts (conservative and liberal judgest) all say that there isn&rsquo;t and even the lawyers you represent say IN COURT that they just believe it, not that there is real evidence.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>well, same thing here.  Maybe he thought he could just lie, lie, lie until he had enough of a community that thought he was telling the truth, despite the evidence.  Once he has that small community, he can just &ldquo;live in that bubble&rdquo; of lies with them.</p>
