      <label for="lkfr8xk" class="commentText"><p>It really is. And I think it has the potential to get worse. First off-season and there&rsquo;s already a lot of guys that had to settle for minimums because the cap space dried up around the league. The entire league might be heading towards a huge majority of players on max deals, rookie scale deals, and minimums.</p>

<p>There are exceptions but the trends seem to be teams cutting salary and players taking smaller deals. Overall, this gives owners a reason to be cheap and takes away a ton of leverage role players had around the league.</p>

<p>I fear that teams might on average be 2 max level guys, one mid salary guy, rookie scale players, and a revolving door of 1 year minimum guys that switch teams every year.</p>

<p>90% of the cap doesn&rsquo;t seem like much though. Most teams are far above that.</p>

      <label for="lkfzh9h" class="commentText"><p>Hot take but this isn’t even that bad, teams are just now forced to be smarter with their financials. It just means that right now, if you can’t sign players, then there should be more emphasis towards scouting, drafting, and developing young players. Maximizing your g league team, your two-way contract guys, and your second round picks. And that’s not even hard to do, every team has the capability to support their young guys and help them succeed in the league. A two way contract + two year minimum signing is like a second round pick signing.</p>

<p>That being said, it still depends on whether teams are willing to go that far to develop their own role players.</p>

      <label for="lkgd417" class="commentText"><p>I think that&rsquo;s overly pessimistic since mid-level role players who are actually valuable can find a market around the league for more than the minimum. The main thing to remember is that a lot of contracts on the books were signed before the new CBA. So until teams don&rsquo;t have to worry about the albatross contracts on their books, they won&rsquo;t be too active with new contracts.</p>

<p>Most teams won&rsquo;t win the championship so going so heavily into the second apron won&rsquo;t be worth it so the majority of role players won&rsquo;t get that extension. It&rsquo;s not worth it to teams unless they&rsquo;re winning championships. As a role player it&rsquo;s going to be harder and harder to find those mid level contracts</p>

I dont know if the previous contracts are the ones dictating that considering that stars will continue to demand their value and young will always be the preferred option, plus I can’t see teams that are in bad contacts that actually don’t want the contracts rn.</p>

      <label for="lkgjb8a" class="commentText"><p>Well, just look at your team. DLo is overpaid and it appears that nobody else in the league wanted him in free agency, hence he took up his player option. Had DLo&rsquo;s contract not been on the books, then the Lakers could&rsquo;ve easily made a mid-salary move.</p>

<p>The Heat are another example. Heat beat reporters said that they were interested in making moves, but they needed to shed their bad salaries, e.g., Duncan Robinson, in order to do so. I can go on.</p>

<p>Once these old contracts that were written before the new CBA expires, then we can expect the new CBA to truly begin. Right now, we&rsquo;re in the in-between where the aprons are spooking teams from doing anything, but their albatross contracts are still on the books so they can&rsquo;t do much even if they wanted to.</p>

      <label for="lkgksmh" class="commentText"><p>Fair, I didn’t consider D’lo’s contract bad cause it was expiring but it really is a little higher than he’s worth in new CBA. I think him being moved though is also more difficult cause the Lakers are desperate to get an asset for the little movable pieces they do have. The Heat definitely have some regrettable extensions.</p>

<p>I do think that while teams technically have to be smarter with their money, it’s really not clear how this helps both players and parity since the players basically negotiated for possibly less, teams with cheap owners would still not be willing to budge, and teams that are willing to overspend are most likely big market teams or teams that are already in the hunt.</p>

      <label for="lkglu63" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s good for parity because the union will never, never support a hard cap. So as long as there&rsquo;s a soft cap, a few teams with rich owners will be allowed to spend and spend. The difference is that the number of rich owners who are willing to do that is less now due to the harsher luxury tax &amp; apron penalties. So in theory, there&rsquo;s more parity than a weaker iteration of the soft cap.</p>

<p>Steve Ballmer was the first casualty of this. He could&rsquo;ve paid PG an albatross max, but he decided not to.</p>

      <label for="lkiiloo" class="commentText"><p>Totally agree it forces teams to be smarter and will reward development more compared to teams just throwing money at roster issues. I dislike the way I foresee it breaking up existing teams.</p>

<p>Fully noted this is all conjecture. But as an example as a fellow fan of the Bucks, I could see a scenario in the future where instead of re-signing Bobby Portis after his current deal for some reasonable amount which had been the norm under the previous CBA, they are more incentivized for other options. Sign him and deal with the harsh consequences, let him walk to a team that can pay him and replace with a minimum contract or young player, or offer Bobby significantly reduced deal and hope he stays. That sucks for Bobby and the team. Bobby shouldn&rsquo;t be forced to choose between leaving or taking a pay cut just because other players contracts.</p>

<p>Denver just made similar decisions with KCP and Bruce Brown by trying to go the cheaper route with developing guys. With the old CBA, it would have been a little less harsh for them to keep those guys and the developing guys at the same time. I don&rsquo;t like that Denver put together a great roster of complimentary players and is now forced into tough situations. I get that they had the option to pay everyone like Boston is, but the rules actively/harshly push team to do this now.</p>

      <label for="lkgcoze" class="commentText"><p>It would probably be worse if there wasn&rsquo;t a max. MJ was making the equivalent of $80 million, if I remember correctly.</p>

<p>You could lower the percentage of the cap that the max/supermax is equal to, but the union will never agree to that.</p>

<p>On the flip side, if you uncork things and allow owners to spend willy nilly, then the majority of owners won&rsquo;t agree to that since it&rsquo;ll just be Dodgers/Yankees.</p>

      <label for="lkgvnjb" class="commentText"><p>MJ was an edge case, in that his unretirement salary had an effective $0 cap hit, whilst he was paid about 110% of the then salary cap for an entire team, due to the circumstances of his new contract.</p>

<p>Yes, if his salary counted 100% to the cap, you couldn&rsquo;t have signed him on his own with no teammates playing 1 v 5.</p>

<p>I would like the cap to be hard, but with specific discounts for legacy and marquee players. 10 years at a club gives you a (say) 30% discount on salary hitting the cap, and you can have one player paid at any amount you like, but they only count at 25% of the cap as a maximum.</p>

<p>So you let your stars get stupid money, without screwing the middle class of players, and your servants are rewarded by being better cap value to their own team if they keep them (this would apply rarely, as outside of Curry, Draymond and maybe Looney, is there anyone who has single team legacy duration of 10 years (Giannis, Jokic and Embiid are probably in the top ten for longest single team stays)).</p>

      <label for="lkgzfat" class="commentText"><p>The only solution I could see is the latter option but imposing REALLY harsh penalties with the spending after a certain amount</p>

<p>Essentially having a &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve ruined your future&rdquo; Apron where if you&rsquo;re over it for a certain amount of years youre automatically excluded from the draft lottery for the next several years. Like let&rsquo;s say if youre in the new apron for 3 years you spend the same amount of years following the year you drop out of it excluded from any lottery picks no matter how bad you are.</p>

<p>This still allows a team to go all in for a year or two before they face the harsh punishments but makes it so if you spend that amount it&rsquo;s going to take you years and years to be truly great again at least through the draft and since teams are offering supermaxes it&rsquo;s very tough to get stars in free agency</p>

      <label for="lkg76fh" class="commentText"><p>I know the players don&rsquo;t want it because it &lsquo;technically&rsquo; limits their earnings potential compared to a hard cap - but at this point the owners fucking around with the soft cap this much it would behoove everyone to just move to a simple hard cap in order to give players more freedom of movement in FA.</p>

<p>Right now wanting to move anything other than a minimum salary or a maximum talent is a hindrance to the collective assets on your team.</p>

<p>All because of the weird rules about what teams can do if they sign a player above a minimum salary while fieldong a competitive team (a team could be competitive and below the cap, but&hellip; highly unlikely).</p>

I&rsquo;m a big fan of Lonnie as a person, but he&rsquo;s wildly inconsistent on offense, a negative on defense, and he&rsquo;s about to turn 26 &ndash; realistically there&rsquo;s not going to be much growth from him. Teams see him for what he is, and they&rsquo;d rather take a chance on younger guys with more promise, which is perfectly reasonable.</p>

<p>CBA doesn&rsquo;t affect minimums, but what it did do starting in 23 was teams starting guaranteeing longer terms to 2nd rounders.</p>

<p>And we see the effects now, but it&rsquo;ll be drastic after next draft. Teams have 5 or 6 rookie contracts is significant</p>

<p>And there&rsquo;s no real buyout, so NBA has this new CBA and they&rsquo;ve given teams no flexibility really. With this CBA you&rsquo;re not eating a contract,  and teams have no roster spots.</p>

<p>And the result is that vets will be pushed out</p>

<p>Denver played Holiday as 6th man in a lot of huge playoff games. They didn&rsquo;t even think about bringing him back even though they have 0 shooting.</p>

<p>Because they have no roster spots.</p>

Not many roster spots, teams are butting up against the tax/aprons, and we&rsquo;ve been seeing this in recent years where teams would rather fill the end of their rosters with nonguaranteed old guys for locker room stability or rookie deals than a guaranteed minimums for vets like Lonnie and others like DSJ (not signed), Diallo (barely played last year), etc.</p>

<p>Guys like Lonnie are being hurt by how teams are operating around the league in recent years. Teams would rather go with a rookie deal and save $1-2M than someone like Lonnie. Very few teams have cap space in the next year or two either, so not likely to change much. Teams are paying their top 3-4 guys huge money&hellip;everyone else is losing out.</p>

      <label for="lkg725t" class="commentText"><p>That was kind of the point of all vet minimum contracts counting against the cap as if they were a 2-year vet minimum, so older vets aren&rsquo;t punished for having a higher minimum, but it does seem like they could go a little further. Honestly I think they should just make the supermax count against the cap as if it were a regular max, it incentivizes teams to develop and keep home-grown talent instead of trading star players because they don&rsquo;t want to pay them 30% of the cap</p>

<p>Besides, you&rsquo;re required to field 14 guys anyways. Make it 15 so that Boston and the Suns have to employ more players.</p>

I guess maybe this helps us load manage Jrue a little bit given his age, but we&rsquo;ve already got a bunch of guards who are gonna eat up minutes. Absolutely worth a camp flier though</p>

<p>(I wonder if this has to do with the KP injury, honestly. You&rsquo;d think that&rsquo;d mean we&rsquo;d want more big man depth, but no KP also means fewer two-big lineups, which could theoretically open up a crack of space in the guard rotation. I kind of figured we&rsquo;d fill that space with wing minutes from Hauser and Scheiermann, but who knows)</p>

      <label for="lkfhq7b" class="commentText"><p>Lonnie had a great year last season and what I&rsquo;m gonna guess is that he ends up being converted, but on a non-guaranteed deal. They want the flexibility for that 15th spot, but Lonnie&rsquo;s availability and the fact you can have someone like him at the end of your bench? You gotta take that chance. Celtics are already over the aprons. Why the hell not?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s teams like the Lakers (Reddish, Hayes, etc.), teams like the Clippers (Tucker, Hyland, etc.), that lose out. Suns are already over the aprons&hellip;why wouldn&rsquo;t they dump Little and Liddell? They&rsquo;re not scared of the tax line, like the Pelicans or Cavaliers. Teams are less willing to salary dump players because they wanna keep picks, so we&rsquo;re seeing more waiving and stretching. Some teams are acting in fear, and others are being decisive.</p>

<p>Vet mins and rookie deals have similar cap hits? Like Denver save very little on cap having jalen pickett instead of Monte Morris. I think like 200k?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s teams betting on like 5 or 6 rookie contracts per team right now, more about locking up the asset and trying to hit on them then being under apron I think.</p>

      <label for="lkkz9l3" class="commentText"><p>No he shot 34% after he came back from injury. He had a great start to the year, got injured and then came back, and was awful.</p>

<p>He couldn&rsquo;t even get minutes on a 30 win team.</p>

<p>This man is a fringe NBA player. Not sure why anyone is surprised about him just barely being signed.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s a low tier rotation player</p>

In 2019 I was watching a Rockets game against the Spurs and Lonnie came in and scored 28 points as a reserve.  He&rsquo;s got 30 games 20 points or above in the last couple of years and a high of 31.  I always look for him and the Boston Celtics made an astute move.</p>

Now, you can&rsquo;t even get a vet minimum and have to sign an E10 deal with the Celtics, just to stay in the league. Like serious who did you fuck or wronged to end up at this point lol.</p>
