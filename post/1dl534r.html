</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Hardy" target="_blank">Will Hardy</a> is the coach of the Utah Jazz. He’s a bright, successful guy. And that may be a problem. In fact, it’s hurt him in two specific ways.</p>

<p><strong>part one: climbing the ladder like Spider-Man</strong></p>

<p>Hardy rocketed up the charts as a rising star assistant, developed by Gregg Popovich and the San Antonio Spurs before spending a year as a top assistant in Boston. For him, it wasn’t a matter of “if” he’d get a head coaching job, it was a matter of “when.”</p>

<p>That happened when he was just 34 years old, tapped by Danny Ainge and the Utah Jazz to lead their new era.</p>

<p>The timing may have been poor from Hardy’s perspective though. Just a short time later, Boston head coach Ime Udoka’s personal issues blew up and led to his dismissal.</p>

<p>As alluded to on the NBA Finals broadcast, the interim job would have almost certainly been Hardy’s if he was still on staff. At the time, he was more experienced and highly-acclaimed than “second row” Joe Mazzulla.</p>

<p>If Hardy had taken the Boston job, there’s no telling how the team would have turned out. He may have won the title in his first year. He may NOT have won this year. Who knows. But there’s no doubt that he’d have had an opportunity to coach an excellent roster. In a sense, Hardy’s rapid ascent (and hire elsewhere) actually hurt him.</p>

<p>—-</p>

<p><strong>part two: the floor is lava</strong></p>

<p>Instead of coach a veteran team, Will Hardy took over a rebuilding Utah Jazz club.</p>

<p>At the time, the team was in full tear-down mode. They had just traded stars Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert, preparing for a long cold winter.</p>

<p>Vegas set their over/under at 23.5, among the lowest that season. Of course, there was a major silver lining there. If the team was truly that bad, they’d rack up a lot of lottery balls and have the chance to draft a generational talent in Victor Wembanyama.</p>

<p>That didn’t happen. Thanks to Will Hardy’s coaching and the better-than-expected play of Lauri Markkanen and others, the Jazz weren’t half bad. They even flirted with the playoffs before settling in at 37-45. Hardy got a lot of praise for his coaching acumen and his overachievement.</p>

<p>But then again, his success may have hurt him. Being 37-45 is essentially like being in NBA purgatory. You’re not good enough to make the playoffs, not BAD enough to draft a stud like Wemby (who would go to his mentor Pop’s team, oddly enough.)</p>

<p>Because Hardy’s team never bottomed out, they never had the chance to draft a cornerstone top 5 pick. As a result of that, the rebuild is going to be more difficult. And once again, the problem may be because Hardy was too good.</p>

<p>They are at the Isaiah Thomas Celtics part of the Ainge system, scrappy young team that overachieves</p>

<p>next up is drafting two stars, and then getting a Kyrie, and then a Gordon Hayward, and a Morris twin and a Terry Rozier</p>

      <label for="l9mc5z1" class="commentText"><p>Steve Kerr barely avoided that fate. He had already agreed to coach the Knicks after Phil Jackson was hired to run the front office. When the Warriors job opened up, Jackson kindly let him out of his agreement, and the rest is history.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s definitely luck involved in head coaching success. But the best coaches hang around.</p>

      <label for="l9mcoyi" class="commentText"><p>I look at it differently. He has the opportunity to build his own legacy in Utah. Utah can be Hardy&rsquo;s team, where he develops players from scratch, becoming a face of the franchise the same way that Jerry Sloan was in 90&rsquo;s and 00&rsquo;s, or that Pop is in San Antonio.</p>

<p>Boston is a tough, unforgiving team to coach and a tough place to build a legacy in. This Boston team is not Joe Mazzulla&rsquo;s team, it&rsquo;s Brad Stevens&rsquo; team and deservedly so. Moving away from Boston Hardy gave Hardy the opportunity to step out of the Boston&rsquo;s shadow and, for better or for worse, find his own path.</p>

      <label for="l9mcvwl" class="commentText"><p>They do have a lot of draft picks, it just depends on when they want to cash them in to be competitive again. They also have quite a bit of cap space to go after some players if they desire. They are kind of in a weird place, but they don&rsquo;t have to be.</p>

      <label for="l9mdtfu" class="commentText"><p>It’s tougher for them because players aren’t lining up to play in Utah. It’d be easier to build through the draft, but mid R1 picks aren’t that useful even as a bundle. I bet the Spurs would have turned down 20 mid firsts to keep Wemby.</p>

<p>The Nets/Boston situation was so good because the Celtics got 2 top 3 picks. The Jazz haven’t had any top 3 Picks, and none of the picks they got from the Cavs and Timberwolves are likely to be top 3 either.</p>
