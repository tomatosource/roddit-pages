      <p>So with the <sup>2024</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub> season starting soon my friends and I are prepping ahead, looking on certain odds websites which will not be named, and stacking our chips so to speak.</p>

<p>They all are going for higher seed teams, such as Boston and New York, where as my team of choice is the Chicago Bulls</p>

<p>Now I don’t think the bulls will win the championship at all, the odds are slim to none, but it raised a question:</p>

<p>Have teams expected to not make playoffs ever won it all?</p>

      <label for="lm1pqpn" class="commentText"><p>Close-ish:</p>

<p>Going into the 1975-76 season, the Suns were coming off a 32-50 year and had traded away their top scorer (<em>Charlie Scott, 24 ppg</em>) to Boston for a reserve guard (<em>OK, it was Paul Westphal, but he was only playing 19 mpg</em>). Phoenix improved to 42-40, went on a crazy run through the playoffs, and faced off with the Celtics in the Finals. Although Boston should have been vastly better, the Suns were tied 2-2 through four games. Game 5 is often called The Greatest Game Ever Played which went to 3OT. Boston won, but Phoenix was screwed badly TWICE in the final 5 seconds of regulation. The Suns should have been up 3-2 going into Game 6 which Boston pulled out in the 4th quarter, but maybe Phoenix wins it with the momentum from Game 5 if it was called properly. And no one thought they were going to make the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="lm1rpz5" class="commentText"><p>BTW, here&rsquo;s what happened in the last 8 seconds of regulation:</p>

<p>Havlieck hoisted and missed a shot with 8 seconds left, and the Suns secured the rebound with 5 seconds left and immediately called timeout, but the clock was allowed to run down to 3 seconds (<em>first of three &ldquo;incidents&rdquo; by the Boston time keeper</em>). With less time on the clock than they should have had, the Suns had to rush their inbounds play which was tipped away and grabbed by Boston, but Paul Silas attempted to call a timeout with 1 second left which they did not have. Referee Richie Powers clearly saw Silas but did not acknowledge it (<em>Silas and Powers were looking right at each other from about 7 feet apart</em>). If the ref granted the timeout, it would have been a technical foul, and the Suns would have shot a FT to win the game with 1 second left. Instead the game was tied 95-95 after regulation.</p>

<p>In a February 1978 game between the New Jersey Nets and Atlanta Hawks, Powers, to avoid being badgered, told coaches Kevin Loughery and Hubie Brown that they could play zone defenses. One sportswriter in the arena reported this to the league which resulted in Powers’ being suspended for three weeks and fined $2,500. In a November 8, 1978 game between the Nets and 76ers at the Spectrum, Powers hit both Kevin Loughery and then rookie Bernard King with their third technical fouls, over the “limit” of two prescribed by an unwritten rule, although Powers claims he was not reminded that each person was hit with a previous technical foul by the other officials working the game with him. This resulted in Powers’ being fined and suspended again, and the game being restarted from the point of the technicals after an upheld protest.</p>

<p>1976 Finals, Game 5 Outline</p>

<p><strong>MASSIVE SPOILERS</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s often called &ldquo;the greatest game ever played&rdquo;, and I suggest any fan watches it in its entirety, hopefully without knowing the full scale of its insanity before doing so.</p>

<p><strong>1st Quarter:</strong> Boston killed Phoenix, up 36-18 after 1. The Suns used 3 of their timeouts in the opening period.</p>

<p><strong>2nd Quarter:</strong> Boston kept it up. Their biggest lead was 42-20, and they led 61-45 at halftime.</p>

<p><strong>3rd Quarter:</strong> Phoenix made a furious comeback, winning the period 27-16. The Suns used a hyper aggressive defense to get a ton of steals and deflections in the 3rd, tying the game 68-68 with 3:58 left in the quarter, and stayed within striking distance as Boston hung onto a 77-72 lead into the 4th.</p>

<p><strong>4th Quarter:</strong> Phoenix kept up the pressure and the game tight.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Final Minute:</strong> Paul Westphal hit a phenomenal turn-around jumper with 52 seconds left in the game to pull Phoenix within 94-91, and after a quick steal by the Suns, Westphal got a crazy fast break layup to fall while getting fouled with 39 seconds left in regulation (<em>tumbling out of bounds</em>), and after burying the free throw the game was tied 94 all. Boston&rsquo;s Charlie Scott fouled out on that play. Phoenix then took a 95-94 lead on a FT with 22 seconds left (<em>Cowens push-off in the back of Garfield Heard for rebounding position</em>) that made the Boston Garden crowd go crazy; this was Phoenix&rsquo;s first lead of the game. The C&rsquo;s then tied it on a Havlicek FT with 19 seconds left (<em>Phoenix&rsquo;s ROTY center Alvan Adams fouled out on the play</em>), but they retained the ball on a long offensive rebound after he missed the second FT. The fans went wild.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Final 8 Seconds:</strong> Havlieck hoisted and missed a shot with 8 seconds left, and the Suns secured the rebound with 5 seconds left and immediately called timeout, but the clock was allowed to run down to 3 seconds (<em>first of three &ldquo;incidents&rdquo; by the Boston time keeper</em>). With less time on the clock than they should have had, the Suns had to rush their inbounds play which was tipped away and grabbed by Boston, but Paul Silas attempted to call a timeout with 1 second left which they did not have. Referee Richie Powers clearly saw Silas but did not acknowledge it (<em>Silas and Powers were looking right at each other from about 7 feet apart</em>). If the ref granted the timeout, it would have been a technical foul, and the Suns would have shot a FT to win the game with 1 second left. Instead the game was tied 95-95 after regulation. Phoenix was legitimately screwed twice in the final 5 seconds of regulation.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>1st OT:</strong> Boston scored the first basket, during which Cowens violently crashed into Westphal, knocking him to the ground and causing him to have to leave the game with a horrible limp. He re-entered a few minutes later (<em>so Westphal missed almost half of the first OT</em>), and Phoenix&rsquo;s steals and deflections kept them in it as Boston carried a 4-point lead for most of the OT. The Suns finally tied it up again at 101-101 with 45 seconds left. After a defensive rebound, Phoenix played for the final shot, but the Celtics stole it with 3 seconds left and called timeout to advance the ball to half-court. Havlicek missed the ensuing shot at the buzzer, but the clock appeared to not start until Havlicek had dribbled twice and began his pump-fake before the final shot (<em>TV announcer said &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you call a good time keeper at home.&rdquo;</em>). The game was tied 101-101 after 53 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>2nd OT:</strong> Tight OT period, and Dave Cowens fouled out on an offensive foul with 1:00 remaining, Boston leading 107-106. On the ensuing possession, Phoenix back-up center Dennis Awtrey fouled out while going for an offensive rebound.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Final 20 Seconds (Holy Shit!):</strong> Jo Jo White hit a driving lay-up with 19 seconds left to increase the lead to 109-106. Phoenix called a timeout, and Dick Van Arsdale hit a corner jumper with 16 seconds left (<em>Bos 109-108</em>). Westphal then caused a turnover on the inbounds pass, resulting in a high-arching Curtis Perry jumper (<em>from almost the exact same spot as Van Arsdale&rsquo;s shot</em>) for the Suns to go ahead 110-109 with 5 seconds left. Celtics use a timeout to advance the ball to half-court. They inbounded to Havlicek who drove left and hit a crazy, leaning bank shot with 1 second left. The clock ran to 0:00 with Boston up 111-110 (<em>it&rsquo;s that home team timekeeper again</em>), but the refs knew that time remained and indicated there was still a second to be played in the contest. The Boston crowd thought the game was over, however, so they went insane and stormed the court. The Celtics ran back to the locker room. In the court-storming, a fan assaulted ref Richie Powers, and fans turned over a scorers&rsquo; table. It took several minutes for order to be restored and for the Celtics to come back to the bench, during which Westphal called a timeout that the Suns didn&rsquo;t have. This was intentional and quite brilliant; the Suns would have had almost no chance to score with 1 second left from the far end of the court, but by calling the timeout, a technical foul was assessed against the Suns, Jo Jo hit the technical FT (<em>Boston up 112-110</em>), but this allowed the Suns to get the ball back at half-court. The refs and security then had to take another minute or so to push the fans back who were creeping onto the floor and disturbing the Suns&rsquo; huddle (<em>Phoenix players had to physically move fans away from their bench while the coach was drawing up the play</em>). What the coach drew up worked because with 1 second left, the inbounds pass went to Gar Heard at the top of the key, and he buried the turn-around jumper over Don Nelson as the horn blew; it&rsquo;s one of the most improbable and best clutch shots in NBA Finals history. The crowd was shocked, but the announcers went wild. Game tied 112-112 after 58 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3rd OT:</strong> Paul Silas fouled out with 3:23 left in the 3rd OT, game tied at 114. Phoenix had a 118-116 lead (<em>their largest lead of the game</em>) and the ball with 2:30 left, but from there it went: Boston steal, Jo Jo jumper (<em>118-118</em>), tie up and Boston wins the jump ball, Glenn McDonald lay-up (<em>Bos 120-118</em>), Phoenix missed shot, McDonald short jumper (<em>Bos 122-118</em>), Westphal great turn-around jumper (<em>Bos 122-120</em>), Jo Jo jumper to give him a game-high 33 points (<em>Bos 124-120</em>), Phoenix missed shot and then foul on the rebound attempt, McDonald hit 2 FT&rsquo;s while an exhausted Jo Jo sits on the far end of the court (<em>Bos 126-120, 0:36 left</em>), Phoenix timeout followed by Ricky Sobers lay-up (<em>Bos 126-122, 0:33</em>), Boston timeout and on ensuing inbounds pass Phoenix purposefully fouls back-up center Jim Ardt to make him shoot FT&rsquo;s, Ardt hits both (<em>Bos 128-122, 0:31</em>).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Final 30 seconds:</strong> Westphal flew down the floor and hit a completely insane 360 lay-up that was shown in highlight packages for decades (<em>Bos 128-124, 0:25</em>). Phoenix stole the ball with 0:17 left and threw a full-court pass to Westphal who made a lay-up (<em>Bos 128-126, 0:12</em>). As Boston cautiously advanced the ball with several passes in the backcourt while getting hounded, Westphal very nearly stole the ball near half-court with 7 seconds left, but it was <em>just beyond his grasp</em>, and Jo Jo dribbled out the clock for a 128-126 victory. The crowd stormed the court again.</li>

<p>Before the 2014-15 season the Warriors were given the 8th best odds (+2800) to win the Finals, but they were still predicted to make the playoffs. In 2013-14 the Warriors had won 51 games, and they were probably expected to perform about the same in 2014-15, despite replacing head coach Mark Jackson with head coach Steve Kerr. Instead they won 67 games and the championship.</p>

<p>I think the problem you run into is that over the course of the playoffs, a long shot team needs to expend so much energy just to make it to the Finals. By the time they get there, they’re worn down from the tough path and facing a stronger team that has probably been able to coast at least a little bit to stay fresh.</p>

      <label for="lm2d5gy" class="commentText"><p>2008 Lakers were close. +3000 odds preseason and lost in the Finals.</p>

<p>The reason for that was that the smart money was on Kobe being traded early in the year, probably to the Bulls, then the Lakers tanking after that. One of the first few games Kobe essentially mailed it in just running 3 point line to 3 point line and the gambling forums were saying that the deal was either getting done that night or at least in a week or so.</p>

<p>Long story short, the deal fell through for a variety of reasons, the main one being that the Bulls would have to give up too much and Kobe would be stuck in the same situation. Lakers had a hot start and Kobe decided to stick it out. Then Bynum gets hurt, the Gasol trade happens, etc etc.</p>

<p>Probably my favorite Lakers team of all time even though they lost the finals just because I honestly expected to have a nightmare season, and instead got a really fun team and a deep run out of nowhere.</p>

Could look at the Moses Malone Rockets they had a lacklustre record and weant to the finals in 81. Hell, I think they went up against a 41-41 Kings team in the WCF, so maybe both of those teams would be good case studies to research if you wanted to try and make a prediction for a rags to riches team.</p>

Also because of reffing style changes the playoffs is almost a different game than regular season and sometimes &ldquo;built for playoffs teams&rdquo; will squeeze into the playoffs and go on a run.
