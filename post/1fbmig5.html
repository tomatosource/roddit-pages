      <p>So with the <sup>2024</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub> season starting soon my friends and I are prepping ahead, looking on certain odds websites which will not be named, and stacking our chips so to speak.</p>

<p>They all are going for higher seed teams, such as Boston and New York, where as my team of choice is the Chicago Bulls</p>

<p>Now I don’t think the bulls will win the championship at all, the odds are slim to none, but it raised a question:</p>

<p>Have teams expected to not make playoffs ever won it all?</p>

      <label for="lm1pqpn" class="commentText"><p>Close-ish:</p>

<p>Going into the 1975-76 season, the Suns were coming off a 32-50 year and had traded away their top scorer (<em>Charlie Scott, 24 ppg</em>) to Boston for a reserve guard (<em>OK, it was Paul Westphal, but he was only playing 19 mpg</em>). Phoenix improved to 42-40, went on a crazy run through the playoffs, and faced off with the Celtics in the Finals. Although Boston should have been vastly better, the Suns were tied 2-2 through four games. Game 5 is often called The Greatest Game Ever Played which went to 3OT. Boston won, but Phoenix was screwed badly TWICE in the final 5 seconds of regulation. The Suns should have been up 3-2 going into Game 6 which Boston pulled out in the 4th quarter, but maybe Phoenix wins it with the momentum from Game 5 if it was called properly. And no one thought they were going to make the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="lm1rpz5" class="commentText"><p>BTW, here&rsquo;s what happened in the last 8 seconds of regulation:</p>

<p>Havlieck hoisted and missed a shot with 8 seconds left, and the Suns secured the rebound with 5 seconds left and immediately called timeout, but the clock was allowed to run down to 3 seconds (<em>first of three &ldquo;incidents&rdquo; by the Boston time keeper</em>). With less time on the clock than they should have had, the Suns had to rush their inbounds play which was tipped away and grabbed by Boston, but Paul Silas attempted to call a timeout with 1 second left which they did not have. Referee Richie Powers clearly saw Silas but did not acknowledge it (<em>Silas and Powers were looking right at each other from about 7 feet apart</em>). If the ref granted the timeout, it would have been a technical foul, and the Suns would have shot a FT to win the game with 1 second left. Instead the game was tied 95-95 after regulation.</p>

      <label for="lm1wjks" class="commentText"><blockquote>
<p>In a February 1978 game between the New Jersey Nets and Atlanta Hawks, Powers, to avoid being badgered, told coaches Kevin Loughery and Hubie Brown that they could play zone defenses. One sportswriter in the arena reported this to the league which resulted in Powers’ being suspended for three weeks and fined $2,500. In a November 8, 1978 game between the Nets and 76ers at the Spectrum, Powers hit both Kevin Loughery and then rookie Bernard King with their third technical fouls, over the “limit” of two prescribed by an unwritten rule, although Powers claims he was not reminded that each person was hit with a previous technical foul by the other officials working the game with him. This resulted in Powers’ being fined and suspended again, and the game being restarted from the point of the technicals after an upheld protest.</p>

<p>Before the 2014-15 season the Warriors were given the 8th best odds (+2800) to win the Finals, but they were still predicted to make the playoffs. In 2013-14 the Warriors had won 51 games, and they were probably expected to perform about the same in 2014-15, despite replacing head coach Mark Jackson with head coach Steve Kerr. Instead they won 67 games and the championship.</p>

      <label for="lm1ycah" class="commentText"><p>I feel like there are teams in the 70s and early 80s that may fit the bill. Could look at the Moses Malone Rockets they had a lacklustre record and weant to the finals in 81. Hell, I think they went up against a 41-41 Kings team in the WCF, so maybe both of those teams would be good case studies to research if you wanted to try and make a prediction for a rags to riches team.</p>
