<p>Honestly I don&rsquo;t think anybody is being too overrated currently. I guess my default pick would be Denver just because people kinda instalock them as contenders just for having Jokic and I think the West is too good for that.</p>

Back up PF is GG, he also bad rebounder. Starting undersized Bane at SF. Then have injury prone Smart and Ja in backcourt without a decent back-up PG. I feel like they or bottom 5 team in west.</p>

<p>It’s arguable Christian Braun is going to bring better defense and worse shooting to their starting lineup which could end up benefiting denver given they are a good shooting team.</p>

      <label for="lkne2eg" class="commentText"><p>I don’t see too many hyping up the spurs. And if you look at history, the really good all time players have typically taken a massive leap in scoring in their second seasons. Lebron, luka, Kevin Durant, and many more all took huge leaps in their second season.</p>

<p>I expect wemby to avg 27 ppg and his efficiency might still be a little below avg but 27 ppg and his defense means it’s hard not to see the spurs taking a leap if they put a semi decent supporting cast around him. At this point too, I’m not sure if cp3 is even much of an upgrade over tre jones. Tre is very solid even if he’s not starting material. I don’t think cp3 is starting material at his age. That’s not where the hype should be coming from. Wemby and Vassell seem primed to take big leaps offensively. Add in Harrison Barnes spacing effect and you get a very competent offense and 2 elite defenders in Sochan and wemby.</p>

      <label for="lkmierk" class="commentText"><p>Are the Magic underrated at this point? I feel like people are <em>really</em> high on them because of their strong young core and what Paolo did against the Cavs in the first round</p>

<p>Like unless you think they&rsquo;re gonna be a top three seed in the East, I&rsquo;m not sure how they&rsquo;re underrated at this point— at least not on r/nba, maybe casual fans aren&rsquo;t paying as much attention but I feel like Paolo specifically gets a lot of love</p>

<p>Also with the Grizzlies, I can&rsquo;t say they&rsquo;re underrated or overrated at this point because I can&rsquo;t tell how they&rsquo;re <em>rated</em> in the first place. There seems to be zero consensus on what they&rsquo;re going to be this season. Personally I think it&rsquo;s gonna be a tall task to jump right back into the top 3 in the West, but they should at least be pushing 50 wins unless Zach Edey <em>really</em> flops</p>

      <label for="lkmqg18" class="commentText"><p>My case for the Pacers being underrated: we are expected to be around 6-7 seed.  47.5 wins is fan duels line. We won 47 last year with only half a season of Pascal. We also got there while having an incredibly bad season vs non playoff teams.  We have an incredibly young team with a young superstar who should be finally healthy again going into this year. Another year experience for all of em.  I think you&rsquo;re looking at a 3-4 seed.</p>

<p>Overrated? I just think one of the three of 6ers, Bucks or Knicks will have big injuries either from age or history. Not really an over rate though.</p>

If Haliburton is healthy, a full season of Siakam and some growth from Mathurin/Nembhard they could be really exciting and have a lot of depth. Also agree the Bucks are overrated but not because of injuries. Unless you classify Doc Rivers as an injury which he is&hellip; a serious one.</p>

      <label for="lkmhevt" class="commentText"><p>Grizz underrated as they&rsquo;re so ridiculously deep.</p>

<p>Clippers also underrated given that they&rsquo;re probably going to be a <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> seed still. I think Ballmer is going to force Kawhi to play through small injuries because it&rsquo;s a new stadium. And also DJJ was an insane pickup. My whole take with the Clips is they&rsquo;re roughly equal to the Pre-harden years in terms of talent when it was just Kawhi + PG. In fact the fit between Harden and Kawhi is even better than PG and Kawhi. Yes they lose some defense but gain some much needed playmaking and DJJ can plug up the holes on defense that PG left (not fully but he can do a decent job).</p>

<p>Overrated is Mavs. Losing DJJ and getting Klay&hellip;&hellip; I don&rsquo;t trust Klay after the last few postseasons. He is a fine scorer in the regular season, but the defense is totally gone at this point and the offense is kinda gone in the postseason too.</p>

<p>Quietly underrated in the East is the Bucks. Delon Wright, GTJ, and Prince are all amazing minimum pickups. Their rotation is immediately upgraded as those are all legit rotation players in the NBA. I wonder who is going to be their 5th starter. I really like GTJ off the bench but I can&rsquo;t believe he signed for the minimum with the Bucks unless he was promised a starting spot.</p>

<p>Lowkey I think the Hornets are underrated in the East. They have real NBA quality players now in their rotation!</p>

      <label for="lkmm5zg" class="commentText"><p>Honestly think the Grizzlies are underrated if anything. I have them in the mix for 4/5/6 with Denver, Phoenix, NO, and the Kings. Edey and GG are fair question marks on a playoff team because of their youth and inexperience, but Ja, Bane, and JJJ is enough high level talent to win games. Smart, Aldama, Williams, Clarke, and Kennard is a really solid bench too.</p>

<p>Now a team I think that might actually be underrated is the Hornets. I think LaMelo, Miller, Bridges (fuck him though), and Williams can make a little noise and make a play in game</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think any team is necessarily overrated. The closest I&rsquo;ll say to that is that I could see the Nuggets disappointing because of their 2 spot. It&rsquo;s possible that Braun can only move the needle defensively but isn&rsquo;t a shooter and Strawther is a great shooter but a turnstile. But even then, there&rsquo;s enough of a world where Braun holds it down enough and Strawther is a sniper off the bench.</p>

      <label for="lknd872" class="commentText"><p>IMO they are overrated on nba Reddit and nba twitter. People are constantly talking up their young core like they are in the discussion for best young core in the league. It’s like your not even close houston. Also sengun gets jokic comparisons when really he’s a lot more like sabonis. In fact I have no clue where the jokic comps come from. He does not play like jokic. Then Jalen green has been a bust. Jabari smith just had his first above avg year. Before this last year Jabari was really struggling. Amen has his shooting deficiencies.</p>

<p>Again I really can’t understand the hype behind houston and their “young core”. They are a solid group of young guys mixed with vets but I mean it’s hard not to call it out how they seem to get overrated. The amount of sengun-jokic comparisons gets annoying.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So you&rsquo;re saying he struggled his rookie year? Or he was bad at Auburn? He took a big step last year, and I wouldn&rsquo;t write him off going into his third year. He does have some areas where he could improve obviously. Needs to hit the weight room. Needs to get to the foul line more. Shot ever so slightly above league average from three last year but could do way better than that (nobody complaining about his mechanics).</p>

<p>Like Memphis who could be a contender or a play-in team, it&rsquo;s hard to say how the Houston youngsters will perform this year. Our ceiling is a top five defensive team with enough athletes to run teams out of the gym on offense (high 40&rsquo;s wins, sneak into the 6 seed). Our floor is nobody improves much, guys are unhappy with their playing time, and we have to blow up the team (low 30&rsquo;s wins, don&rsquo;t sniff the play ins).</p>

<p>Overrated: basically everyone relying on old players. 6ers, Bucks, Lakers, Warriors, Clippers, Heat, etc. I feel like LeBron playing till he’s 40 is making people forget how much players tend to fall off, and it doesn’t always show up in the box score.

      <label for="lko78n6" class="commentText"><p>I disagree. He’s one of the best off the dribble shooters in the league and can score at all 3 levels while also being the best passer and 3 point shooter of the group. He also plays next to a great creator, so he doesn’t have to do it all on his own.</p>

<p>We literally didn’t have a PG for a lot of his games last year and he still managed to be efficient</p>

      <label for="lkmix2c" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, tbh, I think anyone&rsquo;s opinion on how the Grizzlies will do this season probably hinges a lot on how much they valued Steven Adams&rsquo; contributions, and whether they think Edey can replicate that stuff. Personally I think they really <em>need</em> Edey to hit, but I&rsquo;m not much of a draft guy so I&rsquo;m not gonna speculate on whether he&rsquo;ll <em>actually</em> be the player they need him to be right away</p>

      <label for="lkn55sn" class="commentText"><p>Memphis and overrated ? Maybe I&rsquo;m ignorant but that is just underrating them. They were top 10 defense for the majority of last season and that&rsquo;s with JJJ anchoring then and Marcus Smart being in and out due to injuries. Now add in a missing point (Zach Edey), a consistent 1st option (Ja Morant) and all the other important guys like Bane and Smart coming back.</p>

<p>The last time we faced the pacers I remember them struggling to beat a team led by “old washed” Middleton and Beverly. Then yall got took to 7 by Knicks missing half their roster.</p>

<p>There’s a reason why people aren’t saying the pacers are underrated.</p>
