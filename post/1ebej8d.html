      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ebej8d/dammarell_the_brooklyn_nets_utah_jazz_detroit/"><p>[Dammarell] The Brooklyn Nets, Utah Jazz, Detroit Pistons, and Los Angeles Clippers are teams interested in Cavaliers restricted free agent Isaac Okoro</p>
</a>
    </h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Right now, the belief across the league is that while Cleveland would like to keep Okoro, there’s a limit to how much they’re willing to commit to him financially. That means the idea of facilitating Okoro in a sign-and-trade, where Okoro is paid an amount he’s happy with from a different team while the Cavaliers receive compensation, comes into the mix.</p>

<p>Okoro’s annual salary last season was <span class="math inline">\(8.9 million. If he signs a deal that is more than \)</span>10.7 million annually, which is likely, then base-year compensation would come into play. If Okoro signs for over <span class="math inline">\(10.7 annually, the trade would depend on last season’s salary unless the new contract is at least \)</span>17.8 million per season. So, if he signs a deal that starts at or more than $17.8 million, the outgoing salary would count as half the money he signed for.</p>

<p>The most likely outcome is that his new salary would be below, meaning the Cavaliers would only send out $8.9 million in a trade. This is where the complications begin. In typical sign-and-trade scenarios, opposing teams who sign a player aren’t looking to give up much value. It’s why you saw Cleveland only trade Cedi Osman, Lamar Stevens, two fringe rotation players, and two second-round selections to acquire sharpshooter Max Strus in a sign-and-trade deal last year.</p>

<p>With that in mind, no team looking to sign Okoro is looking to give anything back of serious value. So, the pipe dream of the Cavaliers getting a player like Isaiah Stewart from the Detroit Pistons for Okoro is purely a fantasy. Instead, it’ll be a middling return, which would force Cleveland to get creative in any possible Okoro deal, and, thankfully, the Cavaliers have time on their side to make a multi-team deal happen.</p>

<p>But for the fans who send emails and messages to <em>Right Down Euclid</em> foaming at the mouth over the Cavaliers’ lack of offseason moves chasing a dragon that was dealt to them by Visual Concepts simply because they don’t have patience? <strong>Well, that may remain the case, although league sources have expressed to</strong> <strong><em>Right Down Euclid</em></strong> <strong>that the Brooklyn Nets, Utah Jazz, Pistons and the Los Angeles Clippers are all teams who could be slowly, albeit eventually, brought to the table to negotiate in good faith on an Okoro-focused deal.</strong></p>

      <label for="les9daw" class="commentText"><p>His defense is elite though. He can guard 1-4 effectively. And his scoring took a leap last year. Okoro being able to shoot 39% from 3 on 3 attempts from where he began is nothing to scoff at. I think cleveland should keep him as much as possible.</p>

      <label for="lesctnw" class="commentText"><p>3 attemps/36 minutes for your shooting guard/small forward is something to scoff at. And I think there was a stat that he gets the most wide open shots at his position because defenders really don&rsquo;t have to guard him. And he&rsquo;s a bit small to defend the modern day wings. Sure it&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s Westbrook or anything but he really doesn&rsquo;t do anything on offense except stand in the corner and not get guarded.</p>

      <label for="lesd63m" class="commentText"><p>Yeah it’s true he’s not guarded much on offense and defenses leave him open. But still he’s improved every year offensively which is all u can ask when he provides the defense he does.</p>

<p>I don’t think Okoro is undersized at all to the point it will limit him. If you watched the cavs these playoffs, you saw Okoro going at forwards like brown, Paolo, and franz. Okoro is a menace defensively. And he can switch onto guards and lock them up too.</p>

      <label for="lesdn7h" class="commentText"><p>I mean if you&rsquo;re a guard/wing you need to do something on offense. If he was so good, he&rsquo;d be a starter and the Cavs wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten Max Strus to start over him. Yes he&rsquo;s improving, but considering the Cavs want to win right now, he&rsquo;s probably only ever going to be a bench player. And he did start for 3 years and only showed slow progress. It&rsquo;s not like he wasnt given chances to succeed.</p>

      <label for="leseaaw" class="commentText"><p>This is true. I mean the cavs are a young team and have pretty much maxed out their cap roll with Mobley/Mitchell/darius/Allen. They are limited in how they can go about filling out the sf position. They of course could trade garland or Allen down the road. But it’s unfortunate if Okoro goes because Okoro really is a great wing to pair with a backcourt of garland/Mitchell.</p>

      <label for="les8jk2" class="commentText"><p>I think it means Okoro wants more than the Cavs are offering.  The Cavs want to keep and he’s restricted, so they aren’t going to facilitate a  sign and trade unless they’re getting whatever they think full value is. They’d likely match the full mle and no one has more money than that (the Jazz do) . So Okoro can either sign whatever the Cavs are offering of sign  the 1 year qualifying offer, but it makes sense for Okoro to wait it out until all the dominos have fell.</p>

      <label for="lesa7du" class="commentText"><p>I really mean they could sign him to a deal the Cavs will not match. They could do it after Lauri&rsquo;s extension too honestly. If they want him. An MLE will be enough to get Okoro. Any of these four teams really can just throw an MLE and that would be enough. Clippers used theirs on DJJ but they have the salaries to make a deal and they have second round picks. Maybe Coffey as an Okoro replacement, Diabete as a backup C. Don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d give up Kobe Brown but he could entice the Cavs too.</p>

<p>Okoro will be sitting for a bit but he will get a decent offer somewhere and I&rsquo;m gonna assume he will not be a Cavalier come the start of the season.</p>

      <label for="lesc9w8" class="commentText"><p>Doubt it, that would leave  them 4 million dollars under the tax with 2 roster spots left to fill with one of them probably going to a minimum center and last year, they just left one open all year. Okoro is far and away their best point of attack defender, he’s grown offensively every year, he’s still young and they don’t have a ton of assets.</p>

      <label for="lesaobe" class="commentText"><p>Lauri makes 18m for this year no matter if an extension is reached or not. That means utah has 30m in cap space to use for this off-season. So yes they can offer Okoro whatever the hell they want and get him. It’s up to them if they wanna do it.</p>
