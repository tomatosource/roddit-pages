      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1d964sg/oc_a_look_at_boston_and_dallas_playoff_efficiency/"><p>[OC] A look at Boston and Dallas Playoff Efficiency</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Generally speaking, the best metric as to how a team is performing is their efficiency. It looks at how effective a team is on offense and defense at the possession level. For example, a team that shoots average that dominates the offensive boards may actually be more effective on offense than a team that shoots well but can&rsquo;t extend possessions.</p>

<p>During the regular season, Boston dominated <em>net efficiency</em>, which is Offensive efficiency minus defensive efficiency. If we limit the Dallas season to a few days after the trade deadline, the Mavs also did well in efficiency, with a top 5 net efficiency result (#2 in defense).</p>

<p>Things obviously change in the playoffs, so I thought I&rsquo;d look at how each team did in each round compared to their regular season (post-May 4 for Dallas). One thing to note is that efficiency varies a lot game-to-game, so these are small data sets. That said, these are all the same teams playing each other each round, so the overall data has at least some relevance.</p>

<p><strong>Round One</strong></p>

<p>In round one, Boston played Miami, and the results looked like you would expect from just watching the series: Boston&rsquo;s defensive efficiency was way better than during the regular season, but their offense was significantly worse. In fact, round one was Boston&rsquo;s worst offensive round.</p>

<p>Dallas did slightly better on both ends of the ball. However, Boston&rsquo;s dominant defense is the real story.</p>

<p>In the tables below, the variance is vs. regular season (post May 4 for Dallas). <strong>For Offense, a positive number is better, while for Defense, a negative number is better.</strong> Net variance is a look at improvement over the regular season. A positive net variance is good and indicates a better performance vs. regular season averages. For example, Boston was worse on offense by 4.5 but better on defense by 9.9. So the net variance is 5.4.</p>

<p><strong>Round Two</strong></p>

<p>In round two, both teams faced bigger challenges and both teams did worse on offense and defense vs. the regular season. Again, this is expected! The teams in the playoffs are better than your average regular season team, so doing worse is expected. The goal is to do <em>less worse</em> than your opponent. :)</p>

<p>The data is interesting in that Oklahoma City pushed Dallas very hard, with Dallas&rsquo; offense and defense suffering vs. their regular season averages. Boston was also pushed, but not as hard as Dallas was. (Or Boston was just better this series).</p>

<td align="left">-6.3</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Conference Finals</strong></p>

<p>The finals are interesting. Indiana had the second best offense during the regular season, so Boston&rsquo;s big drop in defensive efficiency isn&rsquo;t unexpected. What is surprising is that Boston also did worse against Indiana&rsquo;s defense than they did during the regular season. Did Indiana scheme well against Boston? Because Indiana&rsquo;s defense was poor during the regular season. The Dallas/Minnesota series is also interesting in that Dallas&rsquo; offense improved on the regular season against Minnesota, even though Minnesota had the top-rated defense during the regular season. Interestingly, Dallas&rsquo; defense also did worse, but they did better than Boston did against Indiana, which again is reasonable considering Indiana&rsquo;s offense.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>In all six series, there were only 3 instances of an offense or defense improving on the regular season: Boston&rsquo;s defense against Miami, Dallas&rsquo; offense against the Clippers, and Dallas&rsquo; offense against Minneapolis. The best performances overall was Boston&rsquo;s defense against Miami and Dallas offense&rsquo; against Minnesota.</p>

<p>If we put it all together, as expected we see that both teams&rsquo; net efficiency decreased rather than increased vs. the regular season. In relative terms, Boston maintained their efficiency better than Dallas</p>

<p><strong>Further analysis:</strong></p>

<p>One area for further analysis would be looking at expected efficiency based on the competition and how that affects net efficiency. For example, Indiana has a regular season offensive efficiency of 120.5. Their offensive efficiency against Boston was 114.8. That&rsquo;s a positive for Boston of 5.7. Similarly, during the regular season, Indiana had a defensive efficiency of 117.6. That&rsquo;s a positive for Boston of 0.1 (their series offensive efficiency was 117.7).</p>

      <label for="l7b45pt" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think you can analyze playoff series like this.</p>

<p>The goalposts move from more of a general purpose trying to be as good as possible in the regular season to simply trying to win a 7 game series by any means possible.  It&rsquo;s all about matchups and what is required, so trying to compare the two ends up more in randomness/chaos than anything meaningful.</p>
