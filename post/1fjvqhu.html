<p>Yeah he really dropped off last year, going from 35/11/6 in the regular season to 33/11/6 in the postseason. And I&rsquo;m sure him being seriously injured has absolutely nothing to do with any dropoffs</p>

<p>But I think looking at the body of work over a couple seasons makes it less prone to simple variance. End of the day, Embiid only played 1 series. If he scores well in a second round/conference finals series, I’d be open to changing my opinion. There were also teams like the Thunder who constantly doubled Luka on ball.</p>

<p>I will say I have seen growth in his game throughout the season that makes me feel Embiid has turned a corner in his playoff performance though most of that is related to playmaking. We’ll see what he does next year with a team more prepared to make a deep run</p>

<p>Also, people memory hole when he doesn&rsquo;t drop off.</p>

<p>30.4 pgg against Atlanta in 2021, which was an increase from his regular season average. But because Ben sold him out averaging 9.9ppg, everyone just says Embiid choked.</p>

<p>but a lot of also is related to how good is your ball handling? how good of a passer are you so now teams can&rsquo;t double you and you can show off that talent more</p>

<p>i care less about the talent personally, and more about how unstoppable you are, so that includes ball handling and playmaking to open up your scoring</p>

<p>and for that, i&rsquo;d add Booker in there over Dame right now who i think given his age has to prove he&rsquo;s still that guy after the season he just had</p>

      <label for="lnr44gx" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I would just say Bucks fans, I think there&rsquo;s a very very real chance you get the old Dame back again this year.  Dude&rsquo;s family is everything to him, he moved his entire extended family to Portland and they all still live there together.  This was the first time he was away from his family+kids and then on top of that you had the divorce, new city, new role, two different new coaches, etc.</p>

<p>He was one year removed from averaging 32-7 on 65%TS and then he put up 31 on 64%TS in the playoffs last year.  I don&rsquo;t think he just fell off a cliff.</p>

      <label for="lnrc3lb" class="commentText"><p>I have no issues saying they’re the 11th and 12th best scorers in the league when they do other things really well that you can make a case for them to be top 10.</p>

<p>This list is essentially a consensus top 10 list but replace Lillard and Kyrie with Tatum and Booker because defense still matters. It’s not like you’re knocking both down that far, but they tend to be lower on lists because great scorers like Mitchell and Edwards are ascending while Lillard and Kyrie have sort of proven they can’t be a 1st option on a winning team. If you can score 32 PPG but your team wins 33 games, people tend to really not care that you can put the ball in the basket.</p>

<p>People tend to overrate potential anyway, Wemby’s rookie year was not all that different statistically from KAT’s and people are ready to prop Wemby up as a guy about to take over the league as the absolute best player in the league. We keep trying to prop people up as “the next LeBron” like when people were still hopeful about Ben Simmons getting a jump shot or keep discussing Kawhi “if he was healthy” and there’s just less question marks and variables around guys who have been in the league for a while (Lillard and Kyrie) or someone who has been at that forefront for a while. Tatum and Luka seen as less potential for growth and closer to their ceiling than someone like SGA despite being the same age as him (Luka is younger).</p>

<p>Overall if you want to say these are the 10 best scorers in the league, it’s a pretty solid list.</p>

      <label for="lnrg7od" class="commentText"><p>Replace 2 of the players on the TOP SCORING list because defense still matters? Um did you just not understand what the OP was asking? Bro you just wrote a whole essay on a bunch of shit that doesn’t pertain to the undeniable statistics of who the best scorers are. This isnt a best player discussion. Defense is not a factor on this list.</p>

<p>For example, guys like Tatum and Booker on higher scoring at slightly lower TS than Lillard or Irving is quite arguably better.</p>

<p>Or, if you&rsquo;re going to use TS, you can go the other way too.  Why is a 20 point guy on 65% TS not better than a 25 point guy on 60% TS?  What if we set a cutoff of 18 points and rank by TS%?</p>

      <label for="lnr2onv" class="commentText"><p>I think one challenge with this is that these are &ldquo;sprinter&rdquo; stats in a league that&rsquo;s a marathon and whose playoffs are a war of attrition. It&rsquo;s a league where it&rsquo;s often better to run farther than it is to run faster. Both are important, but you only highlight how fast these guys can run. Whereas, I think volume and totals are important, as well to show how far these guys have run.</p>

<p>If efficiency has to drop a little to include guys with a much higher volume, then I think that&rsquo;d be important to show.</p>
