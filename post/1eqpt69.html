It’s the main reason he was not getting minutes when Kerr tightened up his rotation. Brown should take this as a sign he needs to keep growing as a playmaker.</p>

If he cut back on some of his step backs maybe he&rsquo;d make a higher percentage but if he still shooting league average on those shots, I don&rsquo;t seeing him cutting them out.</p>

He obviously went ice cold for the playoffs and FIBA. But I don&rsquo;t think his 3 Ball is that much of a worry. I&rsquo;d imagine he is just on extremely tired legs right now to add on to a cold spell and it&rsquo;s been ugly. But I&rsquo;d take a larger sample size of success over a smaller sample of failure.</p>

      <label for="lhtcgo5" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s still a fairly small sample size how many 3s did he miss during all of FIBA something like 9. During the finals Luka Doncic missed 27 straight 3s. If Luka can miss around 3 times the amount and still be fine, I think Tatum can too. Obviously coldspells suck, and it&rsquo;s tough to see, but generally they are statical outliers that will correct themselves over a larger period of time. Maybe he has the yips, but I won&rsquo;t be worried about a guy with 1300 3s made on good efficiency until we see him with fresh legs and still struggling.</p>

<p>Edit: Seems Luka only missed 20 straight 3s not 27.</p>

<p>Thats the definition they have on their website. Tatums openness numbers have been crazy the last few years because of the amount of shooting over smaller guys with no airspace, sidestep, and stepback 3s he takes.</p>

<p>Curry is throwing that thing at the hoop in the 0.5 seconds a defender isn&rsquo;t in his jersey, and that&rsquo;s after running two laps around the court. Or he&rsquo;s pulling up from 28 feet out of a pick and roll with a much taller defender closing out on him.</p>

<p>Tatum just doesn&rsquo;t take more difficult threes. He literally can&rsquo;t because his shot is slow as hell.</p>

      <label for="lht8m51" class="commentText"><p>I’m really not that concerned about his shot, honestly. Tatum has had major shooting slumps every season since like 2020, just kind of par for the course for him. he’ll get his stroke back</p>

<p>what he does need to do is change his shot diet to reflect the changes in his body. he takes so many tough pull-up 3s and midrange jumpers and he’s frankly never really been insanely elite at it (especially not in the midrange), but he was definitely better before he became Giannis-lite.</p>

<p>his physical profile alone should make him one of the most unstoppable players in the league going to the rack and we saw a bit of that in the Finals. his game needs to be more centered around his ability to get to the paint, not around jumpshooting. and that will also likely improve his jumpshooting, bc defenders will give him more space if they’re more concerned about him trying to drive</p>

<p>as far as Brown, his playmaking took a big step this year and the level he’s now at is totally fine for a #2 option. asking Brown to pass more is just playing away from his strengths, doesn’t make any sense.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Just wanted to add, I did a deep dive on Tatum&rsquo;s shooting numbers the other day and found that he was an elite pull up 3 point shooter in 20 and 21, hitting around 40% on those. Since then, he&rsquo;s been at or sub 32% for 3 straight seasons. With his feet set and reasonably open, he&rsquo;s pretty much always been good.</p>

<p>But it is odd that he had two seasons of being great at pullups, and has tanked on those shots ever since.</p>

      <label for="lhtcgha" class="commentText"><p>prevailing thought among our fans is that it’s the wrist injury he sustained like two years ago and never got surgery on. seems like Jokic has also tanked on his 3-ball lately and he also has a wrist injury he’s nursing so maybe that’s it.</p>

<p>personally I’m not sure how much I buy that being the cause vs. him just naturally being a peak-and-valley guy with that shot</p>

      <label for="lhtbz8z" class="commentText"><p>Driving to the paint is a lot easier said than done. It takes a lot more energy than facing up and shooting. If it were so easy for players to turn it on and decide they want to get a bucket at the hole then everyone would do it instead of shooting jumpers.</p>

<p>Tatum likely just doesn&rsquo;t have a quick enough first step to make driving a more viable option. He&rsquo;s a good athlete for his size but not the Lebron/James Worthy kind where they can just blow past you before you can blink.</p>

      <label for="lhtd1op" class="commentText"><p>yeah, I’m not saying he should eliminate his jumper completely. even Giannis has to take them sometimes to conserve stamina</p>

<p>I just think he could very easily cut out 3-4 of those jumpers he takes every game, replace them with drives, and drastically improve his efficiency that way</p>

      <label for="lhtrfdv" class="commentText"><p>in his first couple seasons yes.</p>

<p>I think he’s gotten good enough as a driver and finisher over the last couple seasons that the algorithm needs to change for him.</p>

<p>86.4% of Tatum’s drives last year resulted in points, which was 3rd in the NBA among players driving at least 5 times a game, and he shot a 57.3 FG% when he drove. but he only drove 9.1 times per game. guys ahead of him on that list include KAT, KD, LeBron, Harden, Brown, Trae, Garland, DeRozan, Butler, McConnell, Maxey, Book, Dame, Mitchell, Herro, Kyrie, Murray, Siakam, Wagner, Kawhi - and that’s leaving out a lot more names.</p>

<p>there’s no planet on which Tatum should be driving less than any of those dudes at this stage of his career, honestly.</p>

<p>what Tatum does have that those dudes don’t have is the strength and stamina to get to the rim constantly, and he should use that more way more than he does currently.</p>

He’s a top 5 player in the game if you give him the keys but so are Lebron and KD so it didn’t make sense for him to play as much if he wasn’t going to be the focal point of the offense</p>

      <label for="lhtqh1y" class="commentText"><p>leading the league in assists doesn’t automatically make you the best playmaker in the league.</p>

<p>there are so many other factors than just assists.</p>

<p>even current day a lot of ppl will take lebron as the playmaking point forward over hali.</p>
