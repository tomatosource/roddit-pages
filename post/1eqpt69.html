It’s the main reason he was not getting minutes when Kerr tightened up his rotation. Brown should take this as a sign he needs to keep growing as a playmaker.</p>

<p>He tends to be weirdly hot or cold though. Like he&rsquo;ll either shoot 39% from the season or 30%</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s obviously not Giannis level and nobody implied that. But for his position, size, general skills etc, etc he&rsquo;s a bit below what you&rsquo;d expect from 3. Giannis is obviously not a 3 point shooter because he&rsquo;s a 7 foot Greek God that can run and dunk on anyone. Tatum is primarily a jumpshooter.</p>

      <label for="lhuoev4" class="commentText"><p>Everyone’s always hurt.  Look at Curry’s ankles they were all braced up.  Tatum has more excuses thrown his way to defend whatever is going on with his game. Ultimately he’s just a very streaky player who is in the middle of a long stretch of horrendous shooting.  Can’t always blame injuries or anything.  A few months ago everyone was saying he gets doubled more than anyone.  Then it was his wrist.  Or Kerr not playing him.  It never ends.</p>

Meaning he shooting tougher 3s than Curry, Dame, Trae, Luka etc&hellip; Shooting 36% with that shot diet isn&rsquo;t that bad for a guy who has multiple other ways to score. If he cut back on some of his step backs maybe he&rsquo;d make a higher percentage but if he still shooting league average on those shots, I don&rsquo;t seeing him cutting them out.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no reason he can&rsquo;t.  With his height and high-release point, he can shoot over most people.  He significantly improved his finishing the last couple years.  We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

      <label for="lhudh7z" class="commentText"><p>I feel like Tatum overthinks it too much. He passes up good shots for the hope of a better shot and very often there is no better shot before the play clock runs down.
To me he plays best in an up-tempo free flowing game which not only lets his quick, instinctive defense shine but also brings out the aggression and decisiveness which he sometimes lacks.</p>

      <label for="lhuosuh" class="commentText"><p>Agree completely.  I think playing fast also hides his somewhat subpar bball IQ.  Unfortunately he tends to get the ball and everything slows to molasses.  I’m sure Kerr doesn’t love that as he runs a motion offense with the Warriors.  Tatum specializes in a non-motion offense.  Imagine these other players like Curry and LeBron running around all over the place then Tatum gets the ball 2 feet behind the arc and suddenly the ball stops moving.</p>

<p>People still somehow underplaying Tatum&rsquo;s performance when he led his stacked team in points, rebounds, <em>and</em> assists is still wild to me. If that&rsquo;s bad for Tatum, he must be pretty damn good. As stacked as that team is, Tatum was their best player the entire season.</p>

<p>Beyond that, surely doing so well on such a talented team should make him one of the most appropriate players to play in a stacked team? He is perfectly fine operating without being the primary focus. And he&rsquo;s a great defender and rebounder.</p>

Celtics would always come back with brown doing work and make up for his slop. When the celtics have somewhat of a sizeable lead hed takeover, but its always when theyre already on a run. Sorry but this years tatums wasnt last years tatum or the years before where he could actually post up guys and shoot. Definitely something wrong with his mechanics because hes been bricking a lot, only good thing is when he drives but his pushoff is getting called less and less in his favor.</p>

      <label for="lhupb3t" class="commentText"><p>I just hopes he takes this and realizes the limitations in his game.  Turns out the step back three is a bad shot.  He needs a mid range game badly.  He drives and never pulls up.  He always goes straight to the hoop which is great.  But imagine if he had a short pull up game stopping at the key like KD.  As it is now his 2foot -10 foot game is really bad with no touch.</p>

It&rsquo;s a consistent pattern that he will take someone to the rim, get hacked several times in one drive and lose the ball out of bounds, and then start settling for 3s.</p>

<p>If the refs ain&rsquo;t gonna call it he&rsquo;s going to keep turning the ball over which hurts him individually and the team as a whole. Makes sense why he starts to settle if you notice that pattern.</p>

<p>He relies on his 3 so much because when he&rsquo;s hot, he&rsquo;s pretty much unstoppable by most teams.</p>

He obviously went ice cold for the playoffs and FIBA. But I don&rsquo;t think his 3 Ball is that much of a worry. I&rsquo;d imagine he is just on extremely tired legs right now to add on to a cold spell and it&rsquo;s been ugly. But I&rsquo;d take a larger sample size of success over a smaller sample of failure.</p>

<p>Curry is throwing that thing at the hoop in the 0.5 seconds a defender isn&rsquo;t in his jersey, and that&rsquo;s after running two laps around the court. Or he&rsquo;s pulling up from 28 feet out of a pick and roll with a much taller defender closing out on him.</p>

<p>Tatum just doesn&rsquo;t take more difficult threes. He literally can&rsquo;t because his shot is slow as hell.</p>

<p>Thats the definition they have on their website. Tatums openness numbers have been crazy the last few years because of the amount of shooting over smaller guys with no airspace, sidestep, and stepback 3s he takes.</p>

      <label for="lhtcgo5" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s still a fairly small sample size how many 3s did he miss during all of FIBA something like 9. During the finals Luka Doncic missed 27 straight 3s. If Luka can miss around 3 times the amount and still be fine, I think Tatum can too. Obviously coldspells suck, and it&rsquo;s tough to see, but generally they are statical outliers that will correct themselves over a larger period of time. Maybe he has the yips, but I won&rsquo;t be worried about a guy with 1300 3s made on good efficiency until we see him with fresh legs and still struggling.</p>

<p>Edit: Seems Luka only missed 20 straight 3s not 27.</p>

Anyone who watched Luka would tell he was shooting really poorly because of his injury. Tatum was missing corner 3s as a spot up guy with less attention against much worse teams.</p>

<p>Sample size is the whole playoffs too. It’s like 30 games — that’s a lot! Tbh I do just think he’s injured. Shouldn’t have come out for USA.</p>

If that’s what has ruined his game now…that he’s playing so much and exhausted for the fans…god bless him.  If that’s the reality and idiots like me are bitching why cant he shoot and the answer is he’s been playing his ass off for 3 years for the fans well damn!!!</p>

      <label for="lht8m51" class="commentText"><p>I’m really not that concerned about his shot, honestly. Tatum has had major shooting slumps every season since like 2020, just kind of par for the course for him. he’ll get his stroke back</p>

<p>what he does need to do is change his shot diet to reflect the changes in his body. he takes so many tough pull-up 3s and midrange jumpers and he’s frankly never really been insanely elite at it (especially not in the midrange), but he was definitely better before he became Giannis-lite.</p>

<p>his physical profile alone should make him one of the most unstoppable players in the league going to the rack and we saw a bit of that in the Finals. his game needs to be more centered around his ability to get to the paint, not around jumpshooting. and that will also likely improve his jumpshooting, bc defenders will give him more space if they’re more concerned about him trying to drive</p>

<p>as far as Brown, his playmaking took a big step this year and the level he’s now at is totally fine for a #2 option. asking Brown to pass more is just playing away from his strengths, doesn’t make any sense.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Just wanted to add, I did a deep dive on Tatum&rsquo;s shooting numbers the other day and found that he was an elite pull up 3 point shooter in 20 and 21, hitting around 40% on those. Since then, he&rsquo;s been at or sub 32% for 3 straight seasons. With his feet set and reasonably open, he&rsquo;s pretty much always been good.</p>

<p>But it is odd that he had two seasons of being great at pullups, and has tanked on those shots ever since.</p>

<p>personally I’m not sure how much I buy that being the cause vs. Tatum just naturally being a peak-and-valley guy with that shot</p>

If it were so easy for players to turn it on and decide they want to get a bucket at the hole then everyone would do it instead of shooting jumpers.</p>

<p>Tatum likely just doesn&rsquo;t have a quick enough first step to make driving a more viable option. He&rsquo;s a good athlete for his size but not the Lebron/James Worthy kind where they can just blow past you before you can blink.</p>

      <label for="lhtrfdv" class="commentText"><p>in his first couple seasons yes.</p>

<p>I think he’s gotten good enough as a driver and finisher and regressed enough as a shooter over the last couple seasons that the algorithm needs to change for him.</p>

<p>86.4% of Tatum’s drives last year resulted in points, which was 3rd in the NBA among players driving at least 5 times a game, and he shot a 57.3 FG% when he drove. but he only drove 9.1 times per game. guys ahead of him on that list include KAT, KD, LeBron, Harden, Brown, Trae, Garland, DeRozan, Butler, McConnell, Maxey, Book, Dame, Mitchell, Herro, Kyrie, Murray, Siakam, Wagner, Kawhi - and that’s leaving out a LOT more names.</p>

<p>there’s no planet on which Tatum should be driving less than any of those dudes at this stage of his career, honestly.</p>

<p>That added efficiency from 3pt plays and the ability to put the opponent in foul trouble are both advantages of driving which have been somewhat diminished with the way the game is being officiated lately. I&rsquo;d be chucking from the perimeter for sure.</p>

      <label for="lhuz4gs" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t know.  I don&rsquo;t think Tatum has the skills or the physical advantages as a slasher.  It doesn&rsquo;t feel like his first step is particularly fast and he&rsquo;s obviously not as strong or explosive as Giannis or LeBron.  I think in terms of explosiveness, Tatum is just good.  He&rsquo;s not great and definitely not elite.  It&rsquo;s mostly his height and wingspan that make his finishes seem better, but when you&rsquo;re matched against similar length, you lose that advantage.</p>

<p>Even in terms of the body control, skill, and finesses aspects, I just haven&rsquo;t seen Tatum commit a move to memory like Giannis does with his euro-step variations or LeBron does with his bump/roll.  Tatum feels really stiff and forced on a lot of his drives.  I think his handles are also a bit loose and rudimentary in terms of driving and geared much more at creating space for a jump shot.</p>

<p>He finishes well at the rim but I think that&rsquo;s partially the bi-product of selectivity.</p>

      <label for="lhtbrvn" class="commentText"><p>yeah, his midrange game just ain’t good. he doesn’t have much trouble getting a midrange shot off but he has a lot of trouble actually making them.</p>

<p>what Tatum does have that those dudes don’t have is the strength and stamina to get to the rim constantly, and he should use that more way more than he does currently.</p>

      <label for="lhtcsfn" class="commentText"><p>yeah true, I think relative to Kawhi it’s more about his superior stamina and length. Tatum doesn’t have to worry about his leg going dead on him every time he tries to explode to the rack and he can finish both around and through guys</p>

<p>Can’t quite put my finger on it but it’s looks to me like he tweaked his form and never got comfortable with the change.</p>

<p>He’s still the same great player that won a championship with his team a few months ago and he’ll very likely be a starter in the next Olympics. He’ll be just fine.</p>

<p>You can argue Curry was playing bad but it’s also Kerr his coach, you can understand if he thought he’d break out and he did, I’m sure if Ime were coaching he would’ve been playing Tatum expecting the same thing</p>

<p>At the end of the day Ty Lue, Spo and Kerr didn’t think Tatum was going to give them anything based on what they’d seen, and they won gold so who can really say they were wrong</p>

      <label for="lhta5zw" class="commentText"><p>He quite easily shot better this year from 3 than the last two seasons and that’s with him taking a good 2-3 threes a game that have no business (and usually don’t) going in. The guy has just played more competitive basketball than anyone else over the last 5ish years and needs a break. Also doesn’t help that he’d take 1 three a game then get benched immediately after. He’s a top 5 player in the game if you give him the keys but so are Lebron and KD so it didn’t make sense for him to play as much if he wasn’t going to be the focal point of the offense</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Luka, Jokic, Embiid, Shai, Giannis, Curry, Lebron, KD? Tatum isn’t a better offensive engine than any of these guys,</p>

<p>And guys like Booker and Brunson are at his level offensively as well. Scoring just as much, just as efficiently, with more playmaking duties, with worse surrounding rosters. Ant is probably in this category too if the playoffs weren’t a crazy fluke (I don’t think they were), he just needs a regular season that statistically matches JB/Book/Tatum before he’s definitively here.</p>

<p>Tatum is <em>arguably</em> a top 10 offensive engine (one could argue he’s not even top 10) but I don’t think he has a single argument for being a top 5 offensive engine in the league. The eye test nor stats say that he is.</p>

      <label for="lhu61fp" class="commentText"><p>You’re taking my comment too seriously. If you want me to actually argue, there’s about 15-20 players who you could in the top 5 argument I was making. It’s just a hyperbole and I use it because the Lebron/KD/Tatum debate was popular.</p>

<p>If I’m seriously debating, I’m not sure why Tatum constantly gets put down in stuff like this. He’s made <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> of the last conference finals and was a potential injury away from making 3 straight finals as the undeniable best offensive player on the team. In that the other best playmakers on the team were washed Kemba/Smart/Holiday/White/Brown which are all mediocre playmakers and they still were able to have deep playoff runs almost every year.</p>

<p>I just don’t understand the double standard of guys like Shai or Brunson or Ant having minimal success or guys like KD or Curry or Embiid having inconsistent success and still being put above Tatum. I get that he has a stacked supporting cast but he was also the engine of the best offense in the history of the league. Then you look back on previous seasons where his supporting cast was much weaker/more limited and they still had legit chances at winning titles due to Tatum’s strong play.</p>

You swap some of those guys out, and he&rsquo;s probably a lock as a starter! It&rsquo;s not that he didn&rsquo;t have anything to contribute.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s that his contributions overlapped and canalized from others! I&rsquo;ll use an example. In the last game, during Curry&rsquo;s little flurry - The ball swings to book in the corner with a wide open lane. He drives, and doesn&rsquo;t even fake an attack at the basket, he immediately throws it back up to Curry. Tatum wouldn&rsquo;t have done that - nor should he have! If he has an open lane - that&rsquo;s two points! But 3&amp;gt;2.</p>
