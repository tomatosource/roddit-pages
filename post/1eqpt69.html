<p>People still somehow underplaying Tatum&rsquo;s performance when he led his stacked team in points, rebounds, <em>and</em> assists is still wild to me. If that&rsquo;s bad for Tatum, he must be pretty damn good. As stacked as that team is, Tatum was their best player the entire season.</p>

<p>Beyond that, surely doing so well on such a talented team should make him one of the most appropriate players to play in a stacked team? He is perfectly fine operating without being the primary focus. And he&rsquo;s a great defender and rebounder.</p>

<p>TS% is irrelevant talking about shooting slumps… no one said he was bad from the free throw line. Use eFG if you want… 48% vs 55% during the season. Or by distance… 33% from 3-10 ft, 37% from 10-16, 28% from 3pt. He was good at the rim (74%) and in low volume from 16-3pt (45%)</p>

<p>Giannis isn&rsquo;t the best shooter, but he&rsquo;s still dominant. Bill Russell back in the day wasn&rsquo;t a great shooter, but he dominated in other ways. If we reduce the game to shooting percentages, we&rsquo;re missing the bigger picture.</p>

He doesn&rsquo;t do anything at a truly elite level.</p>

Sorry but this years tatums wasnt last years tatum or the years before where he could actually post up guys and shoot. Definitely something wrong with his mechanics because hes been bricking a lot, only good thing is when he drives but his pushoff is getting called less and less in his favor.</p>

Thered be multiple times in the first or second quarter where hed start bricking for 3 or 4 possessions straight trying to force getting into rhythm early, his team is behind, and he gets bailed out whenever brown starts a comeback. He was 28% from 3, and a lot of them he bricked wide open. Dude was definitely chucking it from deep when his shot was clearly off.</p>

      <label for="lhwmv3q" class="commentText"><p>Tatum&rsquo;s problem on offense is that he takes a lot of threes when he really doesn&rsquo;t need to. Tatum is not only a giant dude but he is also very athletic for his size. Someone with that type of build can be an elite rim runner and get to the line a lot. And I know he has the bag for it. On top of that he draws more attention from the defense than anyone else on the team which leads to more contested 3s when he doesn&rsquo;t need to be taking them. And when he does attack the rim it seems like he will shy away from contact and take an even tougher layup when he&rsquo;s much better attacking head on. But for whatever reason he loves taking that spot up 3 way too much. I feel like he also has a decent post game so I&rsquo;m not sure why he doesn&rsquo;t take it to smaller guys (pause) more often.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mean this in any disrespectful way, but Tatum is essentially the Michael Jordan of Tobias Harris&rsquo;. Tatum is the best possible version of what Tobias Harris was supposed to be, and that includes the offensive IQ at times.</p>

I saw someone post it recently, but dude just needs to drop his shoulder and move towards the rim. He either needs learn to take a 5-10ft bunny that doesn&rsquo;t involve a fade away after pushing towards the basket, or just take every mismatch straight to the rim with no bullshitting.</p>

      <label for="lhx0es8" class="commentText"><p>100% agree. And oddly enough if he were to put his shoulder down and attack the rim more his 3 point game would be highlighted even more. 1 because his efficiency would go up if he just started taking better looks and 2 because if he became more of a threat on the drive then defenders wouldn&rsquo;t play him so deep on the three point line.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s already a fantastic playmaker (underrated part of his game) and if you combine that with attacking the rim more often he really could cement himself as the most complete player in the game. Which as a Sixers fan I do not want to see, but it&rsquo;s the truth</p>

<p>Maybe this summer might be a good time to work on his shooting mechanics in general. That shot has worked so far, but I am sure he could be way more consistent if he wasn&rsquo;t shooting with a trebuchet from 3 lol</p>

To me he plays best in an up-tempo free flowing game which not only lets his quick, instinctive defense shine but also brings out the aggression and decisiveness which he sometimes lacks.</p>

      <label for="lhuosuh" class="commentText"><p>Agree completely.  I think playing fast also hides his somewhat subpar bball IQ.  Unfortunately he tends to get the ball and everything slows to molasses.  I’m sure Kerr doesn’t love that as he runs a motion offense with the Warriors.  Tatum specializes in a non-motion offense.  Imagine these other players like Curry and LeBron running around all over the place then Tatum gets the ball 2 feet behind the arc and suddenly the ball stops moving.</p>

He drives and never pulls up.  He always goes straight to the hoop which is great.  But imagine if he had a short pull up game stopping at the key like KD.  As it is now his 2foot -10 foot game is really bad with no touch.</p>

It&rsquo;s a consistent pattern that he will take someone to the rim, get hacked several times in one drive and lose the ball out of bounds, and then start settling for 3s.</p>

<p>If the refs ain&rsquo;t gonna call it he&rsquo;s going to keep turning the ball over which hurts him individually and the team as a whole. Makes sense why he starts to settle if you notice that pattern.</p>

      <label for="lhx2kti" class="commentText"><p>I wish he had a real jump shot. I can understand a floater being a little hard to pull off at his height because the arc of the ball would be like a line to the rim, but his jump shot always includes some weird fadeaway. If he learned to pull up straight like KD while also having the ability to muscle to the rim like Lebron we could be having serious MVP talks. Instead he just has step backs and fadeaways, and while his exceptional ability to do that has him in yearly top 5-10 talks, I think just having good fundamentals like a fuck you up and down jumpshot for mismatches and taking straight open 3s instead of dribble sidestep or stepbacks would have him in top 1-2 talks.</p>

He obviously went ice cold for the playoffs and FIBA. But I don&rsquo;t think his 3 Ball is that much of a worry. I&rsquo;d imagine he is just on extremely tired legs right now to add on to a cold spell and it&rsquo;s been ugly.

      <label for="lhtrc0a" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve watched Tatum play, and there&rsquo;s no way he&rsquo;s taking tougher threes than Curry. He&rsquo;s tall, so he can take forever to release the ball and still not have his shot bothered.</p>

<p>Curry is throwing that thing at the hoop in the 0.5 seconds a defender isn&rsquo;t in his jersey, and that&rsquo;s after running two laps around the court. Or he&rsquo;s pulling up from 28 feet out of a pick and roll with a much taller defender closing out on him.</p>

<p>Tatum just doesn&rsquo;t take more difficult threes. He literally can&rsquo;t because his shot is slow as hell.</p>

      <label for="lhyh7hn" class="commentText"><p>This is my biggest problem with Tatum. It&rsquo;s as if he pre-determines what he is going to do instead of reacting to the defense. There have been so many times where he fools his guy with a pump fake, but instead of continuing to drive and go to the rim or take a wide ass open 15 foot middy, he will step back and allow his defender to recover. And vice versa, he will make a bunch of stationary dribble moves, his defender won&rsquo;t react at all, and then Tatum just accelerates into the defender and it results in some awkward ass play that is either a defensive foul, offensive foul, or a turnover.</p>

<p>Thats the definition they have on their website. Tatums openness numbers have been crazy the last few years because of the amount of shooting over smaller guys with no airspace, sidestep, and stepback 3s he takes.</p>

      <label for="lhtcgo5" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s still a fairly small sample size how many 3s did he miss during all of FIBA something like 9. During the finals Luka Doncic missed 27 straight 3s. If Luka can miss around 3 times the amount and still be fine, I think Tatum can too. Obviously coldspells suck, and it&rsquo;s tough to see, but generally they are statical outliers that will correct themselves over a larger period of time. Maybe he has the yips, but I won&rsquo;t be worried about a guy with 1300 3s made on good efficiency until we see him with fresh legs and still struggling.</p>

<p>Edit: Seems Luka only missed 20 straight 3s not 27.</p>

      <label for="lht8m51" class="commentText"><p>I’m really not that concerned about his shot, honestly. Tatum has had major shooting slumps every season since like 2020, just kind of par for the course for him. he’ll get his stroke back</p>

<p>what he does need to do is change his shot diet to reflect the changes in his body. he takes so many tough pull-up 3s and midrange jumpers and he’s frankly never really been insanely elite at it (especially not in the midrange), but he was definitely better before he became Giannis-lite.</p>

<p>his physical profile alone should make him one of the most unstoppable players in the league going to the rack and we saw a bit of that in the Finals. his game needs to be more centered around his ability to get to the paint, not around jumpshooting. and that will also likely improve his jumpshooting, bc defenders will give him more space if they’re more concerned about him trying to drive</p>

<p>as far as Brown, his playmaking took a big step this year and the level he’s now at is totally fine for a #2 option. asking Brown to pass more is just playing away from his strengths, doesn’t make any sense.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Just wanted to add, I did a deep dive on Tatum&rsquo;s shooting numbers the other day and found that he was an elite pull up 3 point shooter in 20 and 21, hitting around 40% on those. Since then, he&rsquo;s been at or sub 32% for 3 straight seasons. With his feet set and reasonably open, he&rsquo;s pretty much always been good.</p>

<p>But it is odd that he had two seasons of being great at pullups, and has tanked on those shots ever since.</p>

<p>personally I’m not sure how much I buy that being the cause vs. Tatum just naturally being a peak-and-valley guy with that shot</p>

<p>Tatum likely just doesn&rsquo;t have a quick enough first step to make driving a more viable option. He&rsquo;s a good athlete for his size but not the Lebron/James Worthy kind where they can just blow past you before you can blink.</p>

      <label for="lhxher0" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s team dependent though, right?</p>

<p>Westbrook was incredibly valuable to OKC because he was an exceptional playmaker and put a ton of pressure on the rim. Take the same Westbrook and put him next to LeBron, and it makes a whole lot less sense. They have overlapping skill sets, and LeBron is just bigger and better. Shooting is more important to have around LeBron.</p>

<p>So in Tatum&rsquo;s case, he&rsquo;s fine in Boston because they have a ton of weapons. They legitimately had four good three point shooters around him at almost all times. Tatum didn&rsquo;t have to be a great shooter because the spacing was so good.</p>

<p>If you take away a few of those shooters, things change. Now, there&rsquo;s less room for him to drive. He may need to be able to shoot better to generate offense.</p>

<p>And, I recognize that Tatum is not a bad shooter. He&rsquo;s been in a prolonged slump, but he&rsquo;s always been generally decent. Not great, but decent. He also is a very good defender, which obviously adds value.</p>

<p>I just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible to make a blanket statement that Tatum is definitely better than Durant given just how incredibly efficient on offense Durant is. I think it depends on what the team needs.</p>

      <label for="lhyy2wk" class="commentText"><p>But didn&rsquo;t the Olympics disprove that?</p>

<p>Durant was far better than Tatum in the context of Team USA. Replacing Durant&rsquo;s minutes with Tatum would have made them worse. I view this as an apples to apples comparison because they essentially play the same position (wing scorer/playmaker).</p>

<p>The reason Tatum didn&rsquo;t play was that he was worse than LeBron and Durant, and he wasn&rsquo;t shooting as well as Edwards. Maybe the sample size was too small to judge, and he would have figured it out eventually. However, in the minutes he played, he was not good.</p>

<p>Switch Tatum and Durant on the Celtics, and I think the Celtics get worse. Durant doesn&rsquo;t do all the things that Tatum did for that team. He&rsquo;s a worse playmaker than Tatum, which means he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to collapse the defense and create all those open shots for all their shooters. He&rsquo;s also not as good of an all-around defender.</p>

<p>This demonstrates how roster construction is going to be the deciding factor between Tatum and Durant. Maybe you can make the argument that Tatum would be better in more situations, but I don&rsquo;t know if I believe that. I wouldn&rsquo;t really argue with you though.</p>

<p>You can argue Curry was playing bad but it’s also Kerr his coach, you can understand if he thought he’d break out and he did, I’m sure if Ime were coaching he would’ve been playing Tatum expecting the same thing</p>

<p>At the end of the day Ty Lue, Spo and Kerr didn’t think Tatum was going to give them anything based on what they’d seen, and they won gold so who can really say they were wrong</p>

      <label for="lhwxdke" class="commentText"><p>Can&rsquo;t believe I had to scroll down this far for this comment. I totally agree. Tatum has shot like 42%+ on catch and shoot 3&rsquo;s for his career. If he cuts out some of the bad shots off the dribble and maybe tightens up his form, I think he could be 39% shooter on similar volume.</p>

<p>But those short midrange jumpers are huge. I feel like he had that in his bag early in his career then was coached into being more of a 3&rsquo;s and drives guy. But all the best players and playoff performers in the league have the ability to hit from mid range - SGA, Luka, Jokic, Bron, Steph, KD, Kawhi, Jimmy. All those guys are very good in the playoffs and have different variations of a close range pull up.</p>

The guy has just played more competitive basketball than anyone else over the last 5ish years and needs a break. Also doesn’t help that he’d take 1 three a game then get benched immediately after. He’s a top 5 player in the game if you give him the keys but so are Lebron and KD so it didn’t make sense for him to play as much if he wasn’t going to be the focal point of the offense</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Luka, Jokic, Embiid, Shai, Giannis, Curry, Lebron, KD? Tatum isn’t a better offensive engine than any of these guys,</p>

<p>And guys like Booker and Brunson are at his level offensively as well. Scoring just as much, just as efficiently, with more playmaking duties, with worse surrounding rosters. Ant is probably in this category too if the playoffs weren’t a crazy fluke (I don’t think they were), he just needs a regular season that statistically matches JB/Book/Tatum before he’s definitively here.</p>

<p>Tatum is <em>arguably</em> a top 10 offensive engine (one could argue he’s not even top 10) but I don’t think he has a single argument for being a top 5 offensive engine in the league. The eye test nor stats say that he is.</p>

He obviously has the talent and the physical ability to be a top tier NBA player. It would be in his best interest to try and understand his shortcomings and work on them. He can do power drives to the basket and be close to unstoppable.
 He can drive and hit the open man. He has skills. It wouldn&rsquo;t hurt him to talk to coaches and ask how he can move to the next level - ask what are my weaknesses and how do I improve?</p>
