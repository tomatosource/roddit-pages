It’s the main reason he was not getting minutes when Kerr tightened up his rotation. Brown should take this as a sign he needs to keep growing as a playmaker.</p>

      <label for="lhtewgn" class="commentText"><p>In those 3 years he has statistically the toughest shot diet in the entire NBA according to BBall Index. Meaning he shooting tougher 3s than Curry, Dame, Trae, Luka etc&hellip; Shooting 36% with that shot diet isn&rsquo;t that bad for a guy who has multiple other ways to score. If he cut back on some of his step backs maybe he&rsquo;d make a higher percentage but if he still shooting league average on those shots, I don&rsquo;t seeing him cutting them out.</p>

      <label for="lhu1po0" class="commentText"><p>Honestly, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s an accident.  He shoots much better against loose defense.  That obviously happens to a lot of guys, but I think he has to work on consistency against tighter defense.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no reason he can&rsquo;t.  With his height and high-release point, he can shoot over most people.  He significantly improved his finishing the last couple years.  We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

      <label for="lhudh7z" class="commentText"><p>I feel like Tatum overthinks it too much. He passes up good shots for the hope of a better shot and very often there is no better shot before the play clock runs down.
To me he plays best in an up-tempo free flowing game which not only lets his quick, instinctive defense shine but also brings out the aggression and decisiveness which he sometimes lacks.</p>

      <label for="lhtadiq" class="commentText"><p>Tatum made the 8th most 3s in the entire NBA last year and shot above average efficiency while taking the toughest 3pt diet in the league according to BBall Index. He obviously went ice cold for the playoffs and FIBA. But I don&rsquo;t think his 3 Ball is that much of a worry. I&rsquo;d imagine he is just on extremely tired legs right now to add on to a cold spell and it&rsquo;s been ugly. But I&rsquo;d take a larger sample size of success over a smaller sample of failure.</p>

      <label for="lhtrc0a" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve watched Tatum play, and there&rsquo;s no way he&rsquo;s taking tougher threes than Curry. He&rsquo;s tall, so he can take forever to release the ball and still not have his shot bothered.</p>

<p>Curry is throwing that thing at the hoop in the 0.5 seconds a defender isn&rsquo;t in his jersey, and that&rsquo;s after running two laps around the court. Or he&rsquo;s pulling up from 28 feet out of a pick and roll with a much taller defender closing out on him.</p>

<p>Tatum just doesn&rsquo;t take more difficult threes. He literally can&rsquo;t because his shot is slow as hell.</p>

<p>Thats the definition they have on their website. Tatums openness numbers have been crazy the last few years because of the amount of shooting over smaller guys with no airspace, sidestep, and stepback 3s he takes.</p>

      <label for="lhtcgo5" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s still a fairly small sample size how many 3s did he miss during all of FIBA something like 9. During the finals Luka Doncic missed 27 straight 3s. If Luka can miss around 3 times the amount and still be fine, I think Tatum can too. Obviously coldspells suck, and it&rsquo;s tough to see, but generally they are statical outliers that will correct themselves over a larger period of time. Maybe he has the yips, but I won&rsquo;t be worried about a guy with 1300 3s made on good efficiency until we see him with fresh legs and still struggling.</p>

<p>Edit: Seems Luka only missed 20 straight 3s not 27.</p>

Anyone who watched Luka would tell he was shooting really poorly because of his injury. Tatum was missing corner 3s as a spot up guy with less attention against much worse teams.</p>

<p>Sample size is the whole playoffs too. It’s like 30 games — that’s a lot! Tbh I do just think he’s injured. Shouldn’t have come out for USA.</p>

<p>He relies on his 3 so much because when he&rsquo;s hot, he&rsquo;s pretty much unstoppable by most teams.</p>

<p>If a superstar plays substandard and their teams still win, a lot of people will take that to mean the player isn’t as good as everyone thinks. </p>

<p>I personally don’t think that about Tatum because he has shown over the years that he is definitely a superstar, but as far as superstars go he is on the less consistent side of the spectrum. </p>

      <label for="lht8m51" class="commentText"><p>I’m really not that concerned about his shot, honestly. Tatum has had major shooting slumps every season since like 2020, just kind of par for the course for him. he’ll get his stroke back</p>

<p>what he does need to do is change his shot diet to reflect the changes in his body. he takes so many tough pull-up 3s and midrange jumpers and he’s frankly never really been insanely elite at it (especially not in the midrange), but he was definitely better before he became Giannis-lite.</p>

<p>his physical profile alone should make him one of the most unstoppable players in the league going to the rack and we saw a bit of that in the Finals. his game needs to be more centered around his ability to get to the paint, not around jumpshooting. and that will also likely improve his jumpshooting, bc defenders will give him more space if they’re more concerned about him trying to drive</p>

<p>as far as Brown, his playmaking took a big step this year and the level he’s now at is totally fine for a #2 option. asking Brown to pass more is just playing away from his strengths, doesn’t make any sense.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Just wanted to add, I did a deep dive on Tatum&rsquo;s shooting numbers the other day and found that he was an elite pull up 3 point shooter in 20 and 21, hitting around 40% on those. Since then, he&rsquo;s been at or sub 32% for 3 straight seasons. With his feet set and reasonably open, he&rsquo;s pretty much always been good.</p>

<p>But it is odd that he had two seasons of being great at pullups, and has tanked on those shots ever since.</p>

<p>personally I’m not sure how much I buy that being the cause vs. Tatum just naturally being a peak-and-valley guy with that shot</p>

If it were so easy for players to turn it on and decide they want to get a bucket at the hole then everyone would do it instead of shooting jumpers.</p>

<p>Tatum likely just doesn&rsquo;t have a quick enough first step to make driving a more viable option. He&rsquo;s a good athlete for his size but not the Lebron/James Worthy kind where they can just blow past you before you can blink.</p>

      <label for="lhtrfdv" class="commentText"><p>in his first couple seasons yes.</p>

<p>I think he’s gotten good enough as a driver and finisher and regressed enough as a shooter over the last couple seasons that the algorithm needs to change for him.</p>

<p>86.4% of Tatum’s drives last year resulted in points, which was 3rd in the NBA among players driving at least 5 times a game, and he shot a 57.3 FG% when he drove. but he only drove 9.1 times per game. guys ahead of him on that list include KAT, KD, LeBron, Harden, Brown, Trae, Garland, DeRozan, Butler, McConnell, Maxey, Book, Dame, Mitchell, Herro, Kyrie, Murray, Siakam, Wagner, Kawhi - and that’s leaving out a LOT more names.</p>

<p>there’s no planet on which Tatum should be driving less than any of those dudes at this stage of his career, honestly.</p>

<p>That added efficiency from 3pt plays and the ability to put the opponent in foul trouble are both advantages of driving which have been somewhat diminished with the way the game is being officiated lately. I&rsquo;d be chucking from the perimeter for sure.</p>

The guy has just played more competitive basketball than anyone else over the last 5ish years and needs a break. Also doesn’t help that he’d take 1 three a game then get benched immediately after. He’s a top 5 player in the game if you give him the keys but so are Lebron and KD so it didn’t make sense for him to play as much if he wasn’t going to be the focal point of the offense</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Luka, Jokic, Embiid, Shai, Giannis, Curry, Lebron, KD? Tatum isn’t a better offensive engine than any of these guys,</p>

<p>And guys like Booker and Brunson are at his level offensively as well. Scoring just as much, just as efficiently, with more playmaking duties, with worse surrounding rosters. Ant is probably in this category too if the playoffs weren’t a crazy fluke (I don’t think they were), he just needs a regular season that statistically matches JB/Book/Tatum before he’s definitively here.</p>

<p>Tatum is <em>arguably</em> a top 10 offensive engine (one could argue he’s not even top 10) but I don’t think he has a single argument for being a top 5 offensive engine in the league. The eye test nor stats say that he is.</p>

      <label for="lhu61fp" class="commentText"><p>You’re taking my comment too seriously. If you want me to actually argue, there’s about 15-20 players who you could in the top 5 argument I was making. It’s just a hyperbole and I use it because the Lebron/KD/Tatum debate was popular.</p>

<p>If I’m seriously debating, I’m not sure why Tatum constantly gets put down in stuff like this. He’s made <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> of the last conference finals and was a potential injury away from making 3 straight finals as the undeniable best offensive player on the team. In that the other best playmakers on the team were washed Kemba/Smart/Holiday/White/Brown which are all mediocre playmakers and they still were able to have deep playoff runs almost every year.</p>

<p>I just don’t understand the double standard of guys like Shai or Brunson or Ant having minimal success or guys like KD or Curry or Embiid having inconsistent success and still being put above Tatum. I get that he has a stacked supporting cast but he was also the engine of the best offense in the history of the league. Then you look back on previous seasons where his supporting cast was much weaker/more limited and they still had legit chances at winning titles due to Tatum’s strong play.</p>

<p>But he has guard envy where he doesn’t want to play like that because it’s not as flashy as Kobe or Steph</p>

<p>there are so many other factors than just assists.</p>

<p>even current day a lot of ppl will take lebron as the playmaking point forward over hali.</p>

      <label for="lhtuwmj" class="commentText"><p>Tatum&rsquo;s form has looked broken for a while, I remember when he came into the league hes had one of the crispiest jumpers in the league and its just deteriorated for then. It&rsquo;s really stopped him from reaching his true potential as the top US player.</p>

<p>Idk if it&rsquo;s back issues or what, but his form looks all the way fucked.</p>

As a rookie, 93% of his 3PM were assisted. Last year, only 48% were assisted.  He&rsquo;s taking harder shots, because doing so helps the team.</p>
