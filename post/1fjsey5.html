</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>For Atlanta; they have a bit of a logjam of guys that are borderline starter level but not really going to put them in a direction other than average, they swap two starter level guys for a guy in MPJ who could potentially be a 20+ ppg scorer in a different scenario. By dropping two starter level guys they open up the roster to start Trae-Dyson-mpj-jalen-capela, which I think is actually a pretty fun roster which could rise, also opens up a lot of their bench minutes for the young guys, bufkin-rissacher-okongwu for example should all find minutes now</p>

<p>For Denver; they’re falling into the trap modern contenders can fall into where they pay all their proven starters big money and have little money left to bolster their roster. Alongside this issue, their front office appears unwilling to pay starters they see as expendable. I think this trade solves a lot of issues for them, porter is easily the most expendable of the Murray-Gordon-porter-jokic core, and in exchange for him they’re able to add two starter level guys to a thinned out roster. Hunter I believe would start, I think he couple be revamped on a jokic led roster and really boost his offensive game, will never be quite the shooter porter was but should be a defensive upgrade at least. And then bogdan they could either start too, or start Braun and bring bogdan off the bench which would do wonders for their bench adding a 6MOTY candidate.</p>

<p>I see this as a win win, what do y’all think</p>

      <label for="lnqakhf" class="commentText"><p>My kneejerk reaction is to dismiss it, but the more I think about the more I don&rsquo;t hate it. If I&rsquo;m the Nuggets, I&rsquo;m willing to add draft assets to that deal in order to move Hunter someplace else and get a different/better wing.</p>

<p>Turning MPJ + Nnaji into 2 cheaper rotation level players is solid. Hawks getting MPJ is good and I think Hunter&rsquo;s contract is worse than Nnaji&rsquo;s personally, especially for a team that isn&rsquo;t contending.</p>

<p>The downside is that I think the Hawks would want to continue to see what they can build Hunter into and for the Nuggets, I&rsquo;d want better talent than Hunter.</p>

      <label for="lnqbbjl" class="commentText"><p>It’s a fine trade but I don’t think either team would do it. For Atlanta, both Hunter and Bogdanovic can probably get you a first which you’d probably rather have than Porter who, is a more talented player, but also has the injury concerns and a big contract to boot. For Denver, I’m not sure if you’d want to trade away one of your cornerstones for two mediocre role players. Neither have particularly cheap contracts, Bogdanovic is already 32 and Hunter I think is a touch overrated. If the hawks added another rotational guy for a first round pick then I could see it a bit more but Hunter and Boggy are probably their two most tradable guys (except maybe Nance I guess)</p>
