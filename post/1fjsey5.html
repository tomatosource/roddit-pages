</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>For Atlanta; they have a bit of a logjam of guys that are borderline starter level but not really going to put them in a direction other than average, they swap two starter level guys for a guy in MPJ who could potentially be a 20+ ppg scorer in a different scenario. By dropping two starter level guys they open up the roster to start Trae-Dyson-mpj-jalen-capela, which I think is actually a pretty fun roster which could rise, also opens up a lot of their bench minutes for the young guys, bufkin-rissacher-okongwu for example should all find minutes now</p>

<p>For Denver; they’re falling into the trap modern contenders can fall into where they pay all their proven starters big money and have little money left to bolster their roster. Alongside this issue, their front office appears unwilling to pay starters they see as expendable. I think this trade solves a lot of issues for them, porter is easily the most expendable of the Murray-Gordon-porter-jokic core, and in exchange for him they’re able to add two starter level guys to a thinned out roster. Hunter I believe would start, I think he couple be revamped on a jokic led roster and really boost his offensive game, will never be quite the shooter porter was but should be a defensive upgrade at least. And then bogdan they could either start too, or start Braun and bring bogdan off the bench which would do wonders for their bench adding a 6MOTY candidate.</p>

<p>I see this as a win win, what do y’all think</p>

If I&rsquo;m the Nuggets, I&rsquo;m willing to add draft assets to that deal in order to move Hunter someplace else and get a different/better wing.</p>

<p>Turning MPJ + Nnaji into 2 cheaper rotation level players is solid. Hawks getting MPJ is good and I think Hunter&rsquo;s contract is worse than Nnaji&rsquo;s personally, especially for a team that isn&rsquo;t contending.</p>

<p>The downside is that I think the Hawks would want to continue to see what they can build Hunter into and for the Nuggets, I&rsquo;d want better talent than Hunter.</p>

      <label for="lnqkmsb" class="commentText"><p>The Nuggets won&rsquo;t get a better wing is the thing. You&rsquo;re trading MPJ to get someone who can replicate most of what MPJ does at a cheaper value and hoping that the bench piece you&rsquo;d also get would fill out the rotation.</p>

<p>Hunter is a distressed asset. Hawks fans hate him, but he probably provides scoring value similar to MPJ at a cheaper cost which is why the Nuggets would be interested.</p>

<p>The other trade I&rsquo;ve thought of in a similar fashion is MPJ + trade filler to the Nets for Cam Johnson and Dennis Schroeder. Cam Johnson is 75% of MPJ at 2/3s of the cost and Schroeder is a legit point guard. But Brooklyn has no guard depth period so I don&rsquo;t see them going for that (even if it means taking an upside bet on MPJ).</p>

      <label for="lnqbbjl" class="commentText"><p>It’s a fine trade but I don’t think either team would do it. For Atlanta, both Hunter and Bogdanovic can probably get you a first which you’d probably rather have than Porter who, is a more talented player, but also has the injury concerns and a big contract to boot. For Denver, I’m not sure if you’d want to trade away one of your cornerstones for two mediocre role players. Neither have particularly cheap contracts, Bogdanovic is already 32 and Hunter I think is a touch overrated. If the hawks added another rotational guy for a first round pick then I could see it a bit more but Hunter and Boggy are probably their two most tradable guys (except maybe Nance I guess)</p>

They&rsquo;re likely better holding on to him and up there&rsquo;s a bit more development with his consistency.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see either team going for this trade. Both Boggy and MPJ have been huge parts of their teams the last few years. I think both are in better positions to be successful with their current teams too.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Is it just me, or is that a crazy sentiment for a peak age wing (entering age 27 season) who just averaged 15+ PPG on a hair under 60% TS, and was efficient on both 2s and 3s.</p>

<p>I get that he doesn&rsquo;t really impact the game beyond able to finish plays as a scorer, and he&rsquo;s a &ldquo;theoretical&rdquo; player, but that type of player would fit really well alongside Jokic in Denver or Luka in Dallas etc.</p>

      <label for="lnqk2ip" class="commentText"><p>Agree. He&rsquo;s nothing special, but he&rsquo;s a serviceable starter. He&rsquo;s been miscast on defense guarding the other team&rsquo;s best player and trying to cover for the holes on his team&rsquo;s defense (there have been many). I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s the best fit on the Hawks now with the guys they&rsquo;ve brought in, but I would hate to see the team take on Nnaji&rsquo;s longer term bad salary just to dump Hunter&rsquo;s last 2 years. Not very interested in MPJ at that number either.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s not much difference in productivity between Bogdan and MPJ.  But MPJ is twice the price and twice the injury risk.</p>

<p>Nnaji is a fringe NBA player and will probably be out of the league soon.  Hunter has his own injury issues, but at least he&rsquo;s a competent starter and his contract is not outrageous.</p>

      <label for="lnqkdil" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t even think MPJ was that overpaid honestly - big scoring wings get paid at the end of the day. You can be mad that MPJ doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of shot creation skills for the amount of money he&rsquo;s getting, but you can say the same thing about OG Anunoby as well. If Denver didn&rsquo;t offer that bag, someone else would&rsquo;ve.</p>

<p>My big issue with any MPJ trade is that in most scenarios you&rsquo;re not getting another wing back, but this trade makes sense in theory if they want to buy low on DeAndre Hunter. I think Atlanta would only do that if they have faith in Jalen Johnson replacing Bogdan as a secondary ball-handler.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve appreciated the idea of Atlanta trying to surround Trae with as many 6&rsquo;8 wings as they possibly can - they only do that if they&rsquo;re super high on MPJ (nobody is really high on DeAndre Hunter at this point)</p>
