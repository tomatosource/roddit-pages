<p>But coaching must matter somewhat which is why you get a difference from Mark Jackson to Steve Kerr, and Phil Jackson for the Bulls and Lakers.</p>

<p>We had a few playoff disappointments, but the reaction from our players was wildly different between 2023 when Bud got fired and 2020 when he kept his job. They really just seemed to be over it, and if Bud couldn’t keep them motivated it was his time to go. He was a good coach for us, and will likely be good for Phoenix, but he wasn’t going to be good here going forward so we moved on.</p>

<p>i remember being shocked when Riley left the Lakers. he said he could feel he was loosing the locker room and his &ldquo;yelling&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t working.</p>

<p>Bird as a coach and exec had a 5 year (i think it was 5 year) window before that started happening.</p>

<p>not saying i agree.</p>

<p>also you’re not adding context:</p>

<p>When Lue was fired, the Cavs were beginning a rebuild which he probably wasn’t interested in. He got rehired in like 2 seasons</p>

<p>Nurse was fired due to differences with Masai over Toronto’s direction, and was immediately rehired by someone else</p>

<p>The Lakers made a terrible decision (Russ trade) and scapegoated Vogel for it, but Vogel also got another HC job</p>

<p>I forgot what happened with Milwaukee other than the round 1 loss but budenholzer also wasn’t particularly fired for his record. Yet again, he just got another job a year later</p>

<p>Pop still has his job, so does Spo. So over half the coaches in the last 12-13 years were not dismissed.</p>

<p>I think it just boils down to coaching matters, but if someone has lost the locker room, anyone can get fired, no matter how good they are. The reason Pop and Spo are still there are because the organization buys into them. The day the players start tuning them out and it’s hurting the team is the day they won’t be in San Antonio and Miami anymore. This is the same for any coach out there.</p>

      <label for="loh1mzd" class="commentText"><p>Exactly this.</p>

<p>The coaches relationship with his players is key. If they respect him and are willing to listen.</p>

<p>From what i hear, Mazzulla is a weird and craxy guy, but the Celtics respect the work he puts in to come up with plays. Maybe not at all times, but especially after the championship i think no Celtic has any complaints with him.</p>

<p>Malone has been with the Nuggets almost as long as Kerr has been with the Warriors. After that long, its hard to even get rid of him, especially if your teams franchise player has only had him as their main coach.</p>

<p>I doubt either Kerr or Malone can even get fired for as long as Jokic and Steph are still playing for the Nuggets/ Warriors.</p>

<p>And then Spo and Pop have just become untouchables. Spo is widely regarded as the best coach in the league and Pop is just a legend at this point. Even if Pops coaching has become quesrionable in recent years, nobody in the Spurs organisation would dare to actually fire him.</p>

      <label for="lofyy51" class="commentText"><p>If you look at the Heat &amp; Spurs, it&rsquo;s probably better to keep the HC with championship experience rather than dropping them after 2 or 3 &ldquo;disappointing&rdquo; seasons.</p>

<p>I put &ldquo;disappointing&rdquo; seasons in quotes because of teams like the Bucks &amp; Lakers.  Especially the Bucks dropping Budenholzer after:</p>

<ul>
<li>2021 - Winning the NBA Championship</li>
<li>2022 - Losing in the Conference Semi-Finals to the East Champs</li>
<li>2023 - Losing in the 1st Round to the East Champs; while Giannis was hurt</li>
</ul>

<p>I fully believe the Bucks killed their chance at winning another championship with Giannis by firing Budenholzer, and I think the front office &amp; Giannis finally realized that when they fired Griffin mid-season in his 1st year then doubled down on being mediocre by hiring Doc Rivers.</p>

      <label for="logt3tc" class="commentText"><p>There’s no way you watched the bucks over the years and thought Bud was a good coach, at least in the playoffs.</p>

<p>He refused to adjust, he saw for 3-4 years straight how leaving the 3 open hurt them and yet in a win or go home game he decides it’s okay to leave Grant open and didn’t do anything about it.</p>

<p>He saw James harden on one leg and didn’t have guys attacking him on every possession.</p>

<p>He refused to play Giannis big minutes in the playoffs until 2021 when his job was on the line.</p>

<p>He refused to put Giannis on teams best players aside from 2021 and he only did it with Butler. I mean you had Giannis in post game interviews saying he wanted to guard them but it never happened.</p>

<p>Your own team said they were wondering what the hell he was doing in that game 5 in 2023. He saw jimmy torching Jrue and had to ask the team what they thought he should do, although he may not of tried Giannis cause he was hurt.</p>

<p>They fired Griffin because he had 0 clue what to do, he had Lopez on the perimeter and wanted the bucks to trap more which wasn’t working. We were barely winning games against the pistons, hell Giannis was on the bench literally drawing up plays just to beat the pistons while Griffin watched.</p>

<p>It’s why under Griffin we were ranked 19-21st in defensive rating and under doc it was 14-15th ranked.</p>

<p>They were mediocre under Doc because they changed a lot of the coaching staff during the season, there’s not team that you can take and fire the coach/coaching staff mid season and they will improve, it’s never happened and will likely never happen.</p>

<p>Also, Bud was a top 5 coach when he was with you guys.  I would still argue he&rsquo;s at least top 8, and I feel we will see the Suns challenge for the 1-seed with him as HC.</p>

<li><p>Comes from the Pop coaching tree</p></li>

<li><p>Has missed the playoffs only once since becoming a HC (Hawks &amp; Bucks)</p></li>

<li><p>Led a Hawks team with no All-Stars to the playoffs 4 straight seasons, while also taking them to the Conference Finals &amp; had the 1-seed in 2015</p></li>

<li><p>Was 38-22 as the Bucks HC in the playoffs with a healthy Giannis (including the 1 ring)</p></li>

<li><p>Led the Bucks to win totals of 60, 56, 51, and 58 for the non-COVID years that he coached (COVID season was on pace for 53 wins.</p></li>

<li><p>Won Coach of the Year for both the Hawks &amp; Bucks</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The main criticism about Coach Bud was that he didn&rsquo;t make enough adjustments during his time as the Bucks HC, but when you have four players who are locked into playing most of the game (Jrue, Middleton, Giannis, Brook) then the only reason adjustments you make are really &ldquo;should we double x player&rdquo; or &ldquo;should we run a little more zone&rdquo; or &ldquo;should we run more pick n roll/pop&rdquo;.</p>

<p>But if you go back to his time on the Hawks, you see that he is a master for rotations and getting the absolute best out of mid-tier to fringe-all star level players.  I personally think that someone in the front office for the Bucks just wanted him fired (probably the GM who hired Griffin then Doc) and that guy is going to get fired after not producing a true title contender for Giannis to play on.</p>

<p>Also the east was incredibly weak during that hawks run.</p>

<p>Doc is top 5(or 10) in playoff wins does that mean he’s a great coach?</p>

<p>If he was a good coach he never would’ve got fired.  He had multiple chances and looked lost the second we faced a team with a decent coach. It happened every single year.</p>

<p>He also seemed like he didn’t even prepare for playoff series and rather just go with the flow cause the bucks usually sucked ass in the first 1-2 games of a series every year</p>

      <label for="loh1xd8" class="commentText"><p>Its been a long time since something like thats happened.</p>

<p>Coaches get fired because the team isnt doing well. But most of the time, the reason the team isnt doing well isnt the coach. Its jsut that the coach lost the locker room or someone needed to get blamed.</p>

<p>In reality its never a good idea to fire a coach that isnt visibly doing a bad job.</p>

      <label for="lofzpnv" class="commentText"><p>Fit is a lot more important to coaching than it is to playing, that&rsquo;s why its so easy to go from championship coach to unemployed. It&rsquo;s not about having the &ldquo;good&rdquo; coach, it&rsquo;s about having the right coach for the situation your team is in.</p>

      <label for="logvpd4" class="commentText"><p>Coaching absolutely matters. Who is on the floor, when they&rsquo;re on the floor, what they&rsquo;re doing on the floor, and how they&rsquo;re playing on the floor are just some of the many problems that need to be solved by someone and which can absolutely have a wrong answer. A great coach knows their roster, how to maximize it, and what adjustments to make for certain opponents and scenarios. That&rsquo;s also not taking into account that they also have to keep their players motivated over a long 82 game season and playoffs.</p>

<p>Of course, the better the roster is the less equations they will have to solve. But it&rsquo;s incredibly rare that you actually have a perfect roster (if such a thing even exists) so good coaching matters more than scenarios where it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>The average r/nba nephew thinks coaches do nothing but call timeouts and make substitutions so it makes sense why they would think it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>

      <label for="lohffj7" class="commentText"><p>I think coaches are scapegoats. I get a team all the way to the finals and lose and I get fired? The star players are under massive contracts, so when the team “fails” to win a chip the coach gets fired. Mark Jackson turned the Warriors around the next year, maybe he wins it all with them. But he was canned and Kerr wins it and got the credit. Carlisle was fired after turning a franchise around. It’s nuts. Coaches should get 3 years. The first year you are stuck with someone else’s roster. The next year you get some system players to fit your style of play. Then the 3rd year guys finally work well in the system. No matter how great you coach, sometimes teams are just better. Imagine coaching your team to overachieve and running into the 96 Bulls, or the Lakers 3peat or the Warriors run. Sometimes your best just isn’t enough and it’s not your fault</p>

<p>How many of those teams went on to success after firing their Finals winning coaches?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the answer to your question on how much coaching matters.</p>

<p>Larry Brown won in Detroit his first season with them in 2004. Ty Lue in Cleveland after replacing Blatt won his 1st year. Anyone else?</p>
