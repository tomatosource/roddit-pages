      <p>There are a lot of famous quotes about how players make the coach.</p>

<p>But coaching must matter somewhat which is why you get a difference from Mark Jackson to Steve Kerr, and Phil Jackson for the Bulls and Lakers.</p>

<p>So how much does coaching actually matter?</p>

<p>We had a few playoff disappointments, but the reaction from our players was wildly different between 2023 when Bud got fired and 2020 when he kept his job. They really just seemed to be over it, and if Bud couldn’t keep them motivated it was his time to go. He was a good coach for us, and will likely be good for Phoenix, but he wasn’t going to be good here going forward so we moved on.</p>

<p>i remember being shocked when Riley left the Lakers. he said he could feel he was loosing the locker room and his &ldquo;yelling&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t working.</p>

<p>Bird as a coach and exec had a 5 year (i think it was 5 year) window before that started happening.</p>

<p>not saying i agree.</p>

<p>also you’re not adding context:</p>

<p>When Lue was fired, the Cavs were beginning a rebuild which he probably wasn’t interested in. He got rehired in like 2 seasons</p>

<p>Nurse was fired due to differences with Masai over Toronto’s direction, and was immediately rehired by someone else</p>

<p>The Lakers made a terrible decision (Russ trade) and scapegoated Vogel for it, but Vogel also got another HC job</p>

<p>I forgot what happened with Milwaukee other than the round 1 loss but budenholzer also wasn’t particularly fired for his record. Yet again, he just got another job a year later</p>

      <label for="lofyy51" class="commentText"><p>If you look at the Heat &amp; Spurs, it&rsquo;s probably better to keep the HC with championship experience rather than dropping them after 2 or 3 &ldquo;disappointing&rdquo; seasons.</p>

<p>I put &ldquo;disappointing&rdquo; seasons in quotes because of teams like the Bucks &amp; Lakers.  Especially the Bucks dropping Budenholzer after:</p>

<ul>
<li>2021 - Winning the NBA Championship</li>
<li>2022 - Losing in the Conference Semi-Finals to the East Champs</li>
<li>2023 - Losing in the 1st Round to the East Champs; while Giannis was hurt</li>
</ul>

<p>I fully believe the Bucks killed their chance at winning another championship with Giannis by firing Budenholzer, and I think the front office &amp; Giannis finally realized that when they fired Griffin mid-season in his 1st year then doubled down on being mediocre by hiring Doc Rivers.</p>

      <label for="logt3tc" class="commentText"><p>There’s no way you watched the bucks over the years and thought Bud was a good coach, at least in the playoffs.</p>

<p>He refused to adjust, he saw for 3-4 years straight how leaving the 3 open hurt them and yet in a win or go home game he decides it’s okay to leave Grant open and didn’t do anything about it.</p>

<p>He saw James harden on one leg and didn’t have guys attacking him on every possession.</p>

<p>He refused to play Giannis big minutes in the playoffs until 2021 when his job was on the line.</p>

<p>He refused to put Giannis on teams best players aside from 2021 and he only did it with Butler. I mean you had Giannis in post game interviews saying he wanted to guard them but it never happened.</p>

<p>Your own team said they were wondering what the hell he was doing in that game 5 in 2023. He saw jimmy torching Jrue and had to ask the team what they thought he should do, although he may not of tried Giannis cause he was hurt.</p>

<p>They fired Griffin because he had 0 clue what to do, he had Lopez on the perimeter and wanted the bucks to trap more which wasn’t working. We were barely winning games against the pistons, hell Giannis was on the bench literally drawing up plays just to beat the pistons while Griffin watched.</p>

<p>It’s why under Griffin we were ranked 19-21st in defensive rating and under doc it was 14-15th ranked.</p>

<p>They were mediocre under Doc because they changed a lot of the coaching staff during the season, there’s not team that you can take and fire the coach/coaching staff mid season and they will improve, it’s never happened and will likely never happen.</p>

It&rsquo;s not about having the &ldquo;good&rdquo; coach, it&rsquo;s about having the right coach for the situation your team is in.</p>

      <label for="logevqv" class="commentText"><p>Mazzulla still in Boston, Malone still in Denver, Kerr still in GS. These are 6 of the last 10 championships, and a lot of heavy lifting is being done by the Warriors winning 4 to cherry pick 4 years.</p>

<p>Pop still has his job, so does Spo. So over half the coaches in the last 12-13 years were not dismissed.</p>

<p>I think it just boils down to coaching matters, but if someone has lost the locker room, anyone can get fired, no matter how good they are. The reason Pop and Spo are still there are because the organization buys into them. The day the players start tuning them out and it’s hurting the team is the day they won’t be in San Antonio and Miami anymore. This is the same for any coach out there.</p>

      <label for="logvpd4" class="commentText"><p>Coaching absolutely matters. Who is on the floor, when they&rsquo;re on the floor, what they&rsquo;re doing on the floor, and how they&rsquo;re playing on the floor are just some of the many problems that need to be solved by someone and which can absolutely have a wrong answer. A great coach knows their roster, how to maximize it, and what adjustments to make for certain opponents and scenarios. That&rsquo;s also not taking into account that they also have to keep their players motivated over a long 82 game season and playoffs.</p>

<p>Of course, the better the roster is the less equations they will have to solve. But it&rsquo;s incredibly rare that you actually have a perfect roster (if such a thing even exists) so good coaching matters more than scenarios where it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
