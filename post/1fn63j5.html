    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>There are a lot of famous quotes about how players make the coach.</p>

<p>But coaching must matter somewhat which is why you get a difference from Mark Jackson to Steve Kerr, and Phil Jackson for the Bulls and Lakers.</p>

<p>So how much does coaching actually matter?</p>

      <label for="lofx51z" class="commentText"><p>Having good rotations and matchups are huge in the NBA and without coaching that’s impossible</p>

<p>also you’re not adding context:</p>

<p>When Lue was fired, the Cavs were beginning a rebuild which he probably wasn’t interested in. He got rehired in like 2 seasons</p>

<p>Nurse was fired due to differences with Masai over Toronto’s direction, and was immediately rehired by someone else</p>

<p>The Lakers made a terrible decision (Russ trade) and scapegoated Vogel for it, but Vogel also got another HC job</p>

<p>I forgot what happened with Milwaukee other than the round 1 loss but budenholzer also wasn’t particularly fired for his record. Yet again, he just got another job a year later</p>

      <label for="lofygrz" class="commentText"><p>Coaches can lose locker rooms over time. Sometimes a guy is still a good coach, just not for that particular group of players.</p>

<p>We had a few playoff disappointments, but the reaction from our players was wildly different between 2023 when Bud got fired and 2020 when he kept his job. They really just seemed to be over it, and if Bud couldn’t keep them motivated it was his time to go. He was a good coach for us, and will likely be good for Phoenix, but he wasn’t going to be good here going forward so we moved on.</p>

      <label for="lofyi6e" class="commentText"><p>Coaching matters. The issue is when the coach has lost the locker room or the players aren’t responding in the same way</p>

<p>So you can replace the coach to have a new voice or significantly shake up a roster. Most GMs are going to change the coach first</p>

      <label for="lofyy51" class="commentText"><p>If you look at the Heat &amp; Spurs, it&rsquo;s probably better to keep the HC with championship experience rather than dropping them after 2 or 3 &ldquo;disappointing&rdquo; seasons.</p>

<p>I put &ldquo;disappointing&rdquo; seasons in quotes because of teams like the Bucks &amp; Lakers.  Especially the Bucks dropping Budenholzer after:</p>

<ul>
<li>2021 - Winning the NBA Championship</li>
<li>2022 - Losing in the Conference Semi-Finals to the East Champs</li>
<li>2023 - Losing in the 1st Round to the East Champs; while Giannis was hurt</li>
</ul>

<p>I fully believe the Bucks killed their chance at winning another championship with Giannis by firing Budenholzer, and I think the front office &amp; Giannis finally realized that when they fired Griffin mid-season in his 1st year then doubled down on being mediocre by hiring Doc Rivers.</p>

      <label for="lofzpnv" class="commentText"><p>Fit is a lot more important to coaching than it is to playing, that&rsquo;s why its so easy to go from championship coach to unemployed. It&rsquo;s not about having the &ldquo;good&rdquo; coach, it&rsquo;s about having the right coach for the situation your team is in.</p>
