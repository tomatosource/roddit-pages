    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>In baseball, hitting .400 is near impossible in today&rsquo;s day and age. It has not been done since 1943, 81+ years ago. However, it was fairly common before that period. What is the NBA equivalent feat of having a percentage this efficient that it&rsquo;s near impossible to accomplish in today&rsquo;s day and age? But it was doable back in the day?</p>

      <label for="lhgwv3d" class="commentText"><p>Well, all of these would be. Nobody has batted .400 since 1941 with Ted Williams or, now officially, 1943 with Josh Gibson. Nobody has ever scored 40 ppg or more other than Wilt, much less 50 ppg, a figure we might as well conclude as impossible to ever match.</p>

<p>But given all these decades-old marks that have yet to be matched since, for basketball I’d say a 20 rpg mark is among the likelier ones. Possibly more than even 40 ppg.</p>

      <label for="lhh0e6r" class="commentText"><p>I think 40 PPG is the closer of the two. Harden averaged 36.13 PPG in 2018-19 and Embiid averaged 34.7 last season until he was hurt. Drummond averaged 15.99 RPG in 2017-18 and no one has come close to that since. Harden just needed 10% more and Drummond still needed 20% more. I think a team <em>could</em> funnel rebounds to a player, but that doesn’t equate to winning. Whereas just letting a scoring phenom cook like Doncic or Embiid is already part of the game plan.</p>

      <label for="lhguj23" class="commentText"><p>You’re slow. I’m in no way against Wemby. I think he has potential to be the best player that has ever walked this earth. But what the fuck has he shown in the entirety of his life that would lead you to believe he has a chance at averaging 20 rebounds in the NBA.</p>

<p>It’s VERY easy to spot the mf who don’t hoop and don’t know ball. wtf. And you do understand that if someone of that caliber averages 20 boards, they win every single year.</p>

<p>But I want an answer. What has he done to lead you to believe that? Or is it just everyday run of the mill dick riding and vibez. “I think his hair is cool so he might average 20 boards”</p>

<p>Sabonis averaged 14 boards, but you don’t like his hair. Wemby is the real deal though 20 and 10 as a rookie is big time.</p>

<p>You just gotta stop being so biased “Wemby could average 20”. Keep sucking bro</p>

      <label for="lhgx8j2" class="commentText"><p>yea but he still did it a lot especially when hes gettin switched on defense on a guard, he just leak out to get early position and a mismatch on the fast break so they can just toss the ball to him straight inside the paint. and its just leak outs, thats easily <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> extra rebounds im not even talking about if he actually cared and went after every rebound which i dont think is a good idea cuz it takes a lot of energy but the question was &ldquo;if he wanted&rdquo; so yeah if he wanted to he could easily average 20 rebounds. especially if his minutes per game go up too, people seem to forget he played below 30minutes a game.</p>

      <label for="lhh1eiy" class="commentText"><p>yeah I don&rsquo;t think he wants to do it, and he&rsquo;s so much more threatening in transition, that when he&rsquo;ll automatically get a great pass it&rsquo;s a foul and/or basket it there&rsquo;s an advantage, and I prefer this way. rebounding is cool when you&rsquo;re tall but anyone can be a good rebounder it just takes practice and dedication, it should be other people than Victor in order to fully exploit his potential</p>

<p>Timmy D and Hakeem averaged 12 as rookies.</p>

<p>I want you to realize that those numbers are all bigger than 11(I don’t think he actually did average 11)</p>

<p>The list of guys who averaged over 10 boards and never went on to average 20 in a season is astronomically long.</p>

<p>This is a terrible take.</p>

<p>David Robinson averaged 12
Dikimbe Mutumbo
Blake griffin averaged 12</p>

<p>Wemby averaged 10.</p>

<p>I left out close to 30 guys. Averaging 10 rebounds your rookie year should tell you that player has a chance at averaging 20 rebounds 1 year.</p>

<p>All it tells you is he’s a good rebounder. It’s the same shit as saying “he averaged 25ppg as a rookie, he has a chance at averaging 50”. No he can’t, doesn’t matter who he is.</p>

<p>Shooting 50% from 3 is probably going to get MORE common, not less.</p>

<p>Averaging 20+ rebounds I think is the answer. Especially as shooting gets better across the board, it feels like rebounding will slightly go down</p>

      <label for="lhghhea" class="commentText"><p>Probably 50 ppg in a season as far as what’s actually been done.</p>

<p>40 ppg is insane enough as it is, that might be closer; Harden went for it a few years back and still didn’t really come close. And that took a lot of shots from everywhere - including free throws - on outstanding efficiency.</p>

<p>.400 batting average isn’t impossible, George Brett famously came close in 1980, and Tony Gwynn was always a threat, but the limitation both there and with <sup>40</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> ppg is a lot less skill and talent than a massive change in strategy.</p>

<p>It’s even rare these days for a player to hit over .300 because power hitting is viewed as (generally speaking) more valuable, just like teams for the most part spreading the ball around in the NBA. There’s just a lot less opportunity for players to hit those ridiculous marks even if they could.</p>

He doesn&rsquo;t throw the ball fast, he just puts it exactly where he wants to, every single time. He doesn&rsquo;t make mistakes, you&rsquo;re never getting a free walk to first base, even though he has a lot of late movement on his pitches. Oh, and if you try to lay down a bunt because hey, at least you know the pitch will be in the strike zone? Then he&rsquo;s an 18-time Gold Glove winner who&rsquo;s gonna make the putout.</p>

      <label for="lhgxrdz" class="commentText"><p>Efficiency looks great when you get so many foul calls. But if you look at the number of times his shot &ldquo;attempts&rdquo; actually even came close to going through the rim, Harden was not an efficient shooter AT ALL. His points per shot were &ldquo;efficient&rdquo; because he mind-fucked his team into giving him a massive usage rate, and then on every possession he mind-fucked the refs to give him the easiest shot in all of sports. I hate the &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; stat because it doesn&rsquo;t account for the context of the value of each shot, and that varies WILDLY from era to era.</p>

<p>Early era basketball was fast pace, tightly spaced and contested, and a lot more missed shots and rebounds. You pull up the list of highest rebounds per game in a season and it’s Wilt and Russell seasons averaging 23+ from the 60s followed by other centers from that era. There’s a couple Rodman seasons averaging 18+ from the 90s mixed in later, and then finally the first entry from this era is Drummond’s 15.9 from 2017-18. These RPG records are literally unbreakable unless the rules of the game are drastically changed. Even a 7’4” freak of nature like Wemby will come nowhere close to that, especially with more big men playing like guards.</p>

      <label for="lhgktqv" class="commentText"><p>Something to consider with the .400 batting average mark is defense.</p>

<p>Many baseball players of yesteryear were not the &ldquo;athletes&rdquo; we see today.  As an example, Babe Ruth played in the outfield (yes, he had also pitched).  Babe hit dingers, but wasn&rsquo;t known to be an athletic specimen. I doubt Babe was tracking and chasing down a lot of balls hit into the gaps or the foul line that today&rsquo;s athletes could keep up with.</p>

<p>To add more depth to the conversation, it can also be argued that integration has played a major role in the advancement towards more athletic players than prior to integration.  A deeper talent pool has help lead to an increase in the need to be more athletic as more players were competing for jobs.</p>

<p>More skilled athletes, better defense (better pitching as well) = less hits, lower batting averages.</p>

<p>Edit:  forgot this is r/NBA as I was thinking about the baseball reference &hellip;my bad.</p>

<p>Edit 2:  I guess the theory behind what I was referring to can also play a part in the NBA discussion.  Integration, deeper talent pool, better athletes (implies more parity in competitiveness), better defense ≠ harder to score points in the NBA.</p>

      <label for="lhgw2b0" class="commentText"><p>Going to go out on a limb. It’s not fundamentally the same as “batting .400”, but since you’re looking for things that were fairly common than no longer happen because of how the game is played, I’m going with steals.</p>

<p>Specifically, averaging 2.5 steals per game or higher for a season. It’s happened 88 times in NBA history, but only 3 of those seasons have happened since 2006. All 3 by Chris Paul (2.77, 2.71, 2.53) and not since 2012.</p>

<p>30 more were between 2.4-2.5, and out of those 2 were again Paul, and Ricky Rubio did it once. Again, not one season 2.4 or higher has happened in the last decade.</p>

<p>It was very frequent until around 2000, less frequent over the next decade or so, and basically impossible since then.</p>
