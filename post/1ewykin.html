      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ewykin/amen_thompson_was_one_of_the_worst_shooters_in/"><p>Amen Thompson was one of the worst shooters in NBA history. The Rockets need to play him more.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Did you collect stuff as a kid?</p>

<p>If you were anything like me, you had a bedroom filled with random knickknacks. I had a wooden carving of a Komodo dragon, a replica katana, a gold doubloon supposedly from a pirate ship (it was not), a cutout of Kobe Bryant’s 81-point box score from my local paper, Pokémon cards, and much more.</p>

<p>Individually, these were all incredibly cool (*<em>cut to my wife vigorously shaking her head</em>*). But taken together, they were overwhelming. No piece could shine; there wasn’t enough room. The dragon blocked the full view of the sword, the Pokemon cards were covering up the box score, and the doubloon, neglected and unshined, just looked like a big, rusty penny. The whole presentation was far less than the sum of its component parts, which, again, were awesome.</p>

<p>On a related note, here are the Houston players deserving rotation minutes next year: Fred VanVleet, Dillon Brooks, Alperen Şengün, Steven Adams, Jalen Green, Jabari Smith Jr., Amen Thompson, Tari Eason, Reed Sheppard, Cam Whitmore, Jae’Sean Tate. That is *11* players, excluding quality depth options like Aaron Holiday and Jeff Green.</p>

<p>That’s a lot of shiny talent. Most of those players are still on rookie contracts, too, meaning there’s plenty of room for improvement — but also an unspoken need to put up stats to justify significant contract extensions. Could the team’s fierce competition for minutes, desire for shooting around Şengün, and win-now mentality under coach Ime Udoka squeeze Amen Thompson, the flawed but exciting sophomore?</p>

<p>You know Thompson’s three-pointer was as broken as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1-WpWOUk8" target="_blank">lovelytheband song</a>, but it was even worse than you likely realized. For his entire rookie season, he shot just 8-for-58 from deep. By comparison, I counted 11 shots that missed the rim entirely. That’s not a good ratio for a sixth-grader, much less an NBA player. In the league&rsquo;s history, only five other players have <a href="https://stathead.com/basketball/player-season-finder.cgi?request=1&amp;ccomp%5B1%5D=lt&amp;cval%5B1%5D=.15&amp;cstat%5B1%5D=fg3_pct&amp;ccomp%5B2%5D=gt&amp;cval%5B2%5D=50&amp;cstat%5B2%5D=fg3a" target="_blank">attempted at least 50 threes and hit fewer than 15% of them</a>. (It’s probably not worth pointing out that Michael Jordan, Hall of Famer Dennis Johnson, and DeMar DeRozan are three of the other five, so I won’t.)</p>

<p>Teams stashed their center or absolute worst defender on him almost from the get-go. Nearly every three-pointer he took was a practice shot: <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1641708/shots-dash?SeasonType=Regular+Season&amp;dir=A&amp;PerMode=Totals" target="_blank">57 of his 58 attempts were considered “open” or “wide-open”</a> in the NBA’s tracking data. Yet even the shots that miraculously caught the rim didn’t have an alibi: [<a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/amen-thompson-and-fitting-star-shaped" target="_blank">click for video of a hideous miss</a>]</p>

<p>Hopefully, he’ll develop a better shot (it certainly can’t get worse), but it’s foolish to assume he’ll approach league average in the next couple of seasons. So why should Houston bother featuring him?</p>

<p>Thompson was *so good* at nearly every other part of basketball, particularly for a rookie who had seldom faced college or overseas competition before the season. He is one of the most unique players in the NBA and will only get better.</p>

<p>Despite his long-distance troubles, Thompson still hit nearly 60% on twos. His outrageous combination of physical tools propelled him to more favorable areas of the court: t<a href="https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/5216/lineups?off=3761#tab-four_factors" target="_blank">wo-thirds of his shots occurred at the rim</a>, more than most centers. Most rookies struggle with NBA shotblocking and athleticism when they get to the paint; per Cleaning the Glass, Thompson converted an excellent 67.4% at the hoop, better than Bam Adebayo, Jaylen Brown, or Zion Williamson (!!).</p>

<p>His athleticism stood out even in a league full of standout athletes, but unlike many rookies, he applied it correctly by pushing the ball in transition at every opportunity. According to Synergy, Thompson was in the 96th percentile for the proportion of possessions finished on the break. Defenses can’t sag off of him if he outraces them to the goal: [<a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/amen-thompson-and-fitting-star-shaped" target="_blank">click here for video</a>]</p>

<p>Thompson’s handle is a little raw, but he’s 21 years old. That’s one of the easiest things for young players to improve. It’s harder to improve passing instincts, and Thompson already possesses those in spades. He’s a quick reactor and excellent floor-mapper: [<a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/amen-thompson-and-fitting-star-shaped" target="_blank">click here for video</a>]</p>

<p>Plus, who doesn’t love 35-foot bounce passes? [<a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/amen-thompson-and-fitting-star-shaped" target="_blank">click here for video</a>]</p>

<p>Thompson is a savvy cutter for a player used to having the ball in his hands. He knows defenses are ignoring him. If his mark strays too far, he waits for the opportune time to cut backdoor and dunk things others would’ve laid up: [<a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/amen-thompson-and-fitting-star-shaped" target="_blank">click for video</a>]</p>

<p>Thompson also had the <a href="https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/players?stat_category=defense_rebounding" target="_blank">highest offensive rebounding rate of anyone under 6’8”</a> (min. 500 minutes). He was often stationed in the dunker spot, providing him with plenty of opportunity to chase misses, and he has as good a second leap as anyone in the league, letting him beat opposing bigs to an airborne ball. Thompson has a highlight reel full of nifty putback dunks, but this spinning tip off an airball is an even better illustration of his coordination: [<a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/amen-thompson-and-fitting-star-shaped" target="_blank">click for video</a>]</p>

<p>He has a nose for the ball, an F1 motor, and the rare ability to chase offensive rebounds without compromising transition defense (and he’s nearly as good a glass-cleaner on that end, too).</p>

<p>Speaking of defense, Thompson was one of the best perimeter rookie defenders we’ve ever seen. He was in the <a href="https://dunksandthrees.com/epm" target="_blank">95th percentile in Defensive EPM</a> (only Tari Eason ranked higher on the Rockets) and <a href="https://www.bball-index.com/leaderboards-tool/" target="_blank">led the team in D-LEBRON.</a> Thompson earned Udoka’s trust with his performances on big names, frequently matching up with the likes of Devin Booker, Tyrese Haliburton, Kevin Durant, and Jalen Williams. He posted excellent defensive playmaking numbers, averaging exactly two steals and a block per 36 minutes.</p>

<p>Thompson can guard the full length of the court, and he’s already one of the better screen navigators in the game. Even when he gets brushed, his length and lateral quickness get him right back into the action: [<a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/amen-thompson-and-fitting-star-shaped" target="_blank">video here</a>]</p>

<p>Despite the new positionless awards voting, in which bigs vacuum up most of the All-Defensive-Team slots, I’d be shocked if Thompson doesn’t get a nod in the next few seasons.</p>

<p>Although Thompson spent most of his life as an on-ball player, the Rockets used him in various ways, from traditional point guard to full-blown center. After Şengün went down with an injury late in the season, Thompson started setting more screens while using the short roll to his advantage. Houston often took advantage of his versatility by making him a hand-off hub at the top, usually with VanVleet and/or Green. He could pick out cutters, hit FVV or Green for open triples, or take the ball to the rack himself. Really, there’s nothing he can’t do!</p>

<p>Oh wait, he can’t shoot. Right.</p>

<p>So how does he fit? On a different team, he’d be treated like the good version of Ben Simmons: play on-ball more, push the team in transition as much as possible, attack the boards, and lock down the other team’s best ballhandler.</p>

<p>But on this crowded Houston roster, Thompson might be fourth in the pecking order behind steady VanVleet, thrilling Green, and post hub Şengün, competing for touches with Sheppard, Brooks, and Whitmore. His defense, rebounding, cutting, screen-setting, and off-ball activity make up for his spacing deficiencies, and he was a big part of Houston’s late-season push for the playoffs, but he’s undoubtedly an untraditional player whose two best roles are currently occupied by superior (for now) teammates. He’s a star-shaped peg trying to fit into a round hole.</p>

<p>Thompson needs more time to accentuate his strengths and mitigate his most glaring weakness, but the Rockets may not give him that. Udoka has vowed to make a playoff push, and two offseasons in a row, they’ve been linked to win-now moves (that never materialized).</p>

<p>Thompson isn’t going to fall out of the rotation, but there are reasons for Udoka not to give him top-six minutes. His current handle and shooting limit him as a point guard, and the Rockets already have Fred VanVleet running the show. The Rockets’ offense was generally worse with Thompson on the court than off, with one major exception: Jabari Smith at small-ball center lineups, which we saw a lot after Şengün’s late-season injury. <a href="https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/5216/lineups?C=5092&amp;on=5216#tab-four_factors" target="_blank">Those were reasonable offensively and excellent defensively</a>. In those groups, Thompson can act more like a center on offense by screening, rolling, and hovering in the dunker spot while Smith spaces from the three-point line. If he can’t be the point guard, being the sole paint presence is the next best thing.</p>

<p>But when healthy, Houston already has a borderline-All-Star big man in Şengün, so those minutes with Smith at center will be limited unless the Rockets make a move. Şengün’s name has floated in and out of trade rumors since Udoka took over, as the coach has traditionally preferred a more defensive-minded center. Those whispers quieted some after Şengün’s breakout performance last season, but with the Turkish youngster almost certain to ask for a rookie max extension, they’ll likely resurface again.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong: <a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-indecisive-flamingo-has-arrived" target="_blank">I’m also quite high on the indecisive flamingo</a>. In fact, I’m high on nearly every player on the Rockets, individually. But like my scattershot childhood collection, there’s just too much to look at. Houston has *so* many budding talents that featuring some will inevitably stunt the growth of others, like trees fighting for the same patches of sunlight in a forest. It’s a good problem to have, but it’s a problem nonetheless.</p>

<p>Truthfully, I’m not sure how it all shakes out. Outside of the championship contenders’ various trials and travails, the Rockets’ player development and rotation might be the most interesting storyline in the league next season. There are so many interesting configurations to try, and it’s up to Udoka to figure out how to maximize everyone.</p>

<p>But I do know this: the Rockets don’t have a player with a higher ceiling than Amen Thompson. One way or another, I hope Houston puts him in a position to reach it.</p>

      <label for="lj3nv8m" class="commentText"><p>Eh that may not be such a good idea.  Anything that is not a glowing endorsement of Sengun sets them off.  Anything that suggests other players could be worth keeping sets them off.  It&rsquo;s at the point where you can&rsquo;t even hype up other players because the Sengunstans see it as a threat.</p>

<p>As sad as it is I think /r/nba is actually the better place for a rational discussion involving the Rockets.</p>

There&rsquo;s 7 in the young core and we&rsquo;d need to move at most 2 of them to shore up compatibility.  But we&rsquo;d likely need to eventually move at least 2 of them anyways for cap reasons.</p>

<p>Reed, Jabari, Tari, and Cam are seamless fits in pretty much any line up.  The incompatibilities only arise between Sengun, Green, and Amen, and I suppose that&rsquo;s where the decision making will lie this coming offseason.</p>

      <label for="lj3h84c" class="commentText"><p>Yea its hard to say out loud about guys this young but I just don&rsquo;t see a future where Sengun and Amen are on the same team. Which sucks because those are your two best prospects imo</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say Jalen Green is an incompatible player though. He fits well with both of these two</p>

      <label for="lj3np9q" class="commentText"><p>Agreed with Jalen, but there was a lot of talk about how well he did when Sengun got injured.  While I do think it freed him up a bit, I don&rsquo;t buy that they aren&rsquo;t compatible &hellip; I mostly include him in there cuz reasonable minds could differ and I could just be wrong about their compatibility.  Also, Jalen might be gone regardless if he doesn&rsquo;t simply improve his consistency.</p>

<p>I think the solution re: Sengun/Amen is to do pretty much what we did last season but increase Amen&rsquo;s minutes off the bench and see what happens.  As long as both play very well, even if it is clear they aren&rsquo;t compatible we should get good value on one or the other.  But know knows, maybe Sengun develops a respectable three point shot.  I have virtually no confidence that Amen will even though he&rsquo;s my favorite player on the squad lol.</p>

      <label for="lj3ocuw" class="commentText"><p>Nah that streak happened due to Jalen being hot from 3 and playing bad teams. He fizzled out pretty hard in the end of the season</p>

<p>Sengun helps everyone on the floor around him as a passing hub and his scoring gravity. The concerns about that are dumb. Its just hard with Sengun and Amen due to both being non shooters</p>

      <label for="lj3j3sl" class="commentText"><p>Yeah this is my line of thinking as far as the fits are concerned. Theoretically it&rsquo;s Al-P and Amen that have compatibility issues since they both occupy the paint currently. I think the hope is that Al-P can stretch the floor soon to make it work, but it&rsquo;s not a guarantee.</p>

<p>JG fits but he&rsquo;s just not quite good enough to justify moving on from Sengun if the thought is that you cant pay them both.</p>

<p>Amen is such an amazing defender at 21 years old that it might just be worth shipping off other pieces to make him work. This year will be very enlightening for the Rockets and should inform the makeup of the roster moving forward. Sengun is sensational, but Ime wants to put together a bulletproof defense, and Amen would likely be the centerpiece of that.</p>

      <label for="lj3gyzz" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, the biggest fit problem on offense is Amen and Sengun.  Both amazing at what they do but it really kills our spacing and line up flexibility with both of them.  We&rsquo;re also going to be playing Adams as backup C this season so there&rsquo;s another non shooter conflicting with Amen.</p>

<p>When Sengun went down late in the season Amen really started to shine with Jalen.  Amen was a big part Jalen&rsquo;s crazy run.  Their two man game was great and it gave Jalen enough space in the paint to operate.  Amen was always there to get the bailout pass or go for the rebound.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s going to be hard to figure out who to keep next off season because it feels like Sengun vs Jalen and Amen.  After last season I&rsquo;d say Sengun is more important on his own but if Jalen and Amen can keep that energy going this season I&rsquo;d take them over Sengun.  Also shoutout to Jock who played really well late in the season and olympics as well.  Jock had enough range to not clog the paint while also being a solid defender.  Fit with Amen and Jalen perfectly.</p>

<p>If all it took were getting someone&rsquo;s mechanics and form better, most players would just work on that and be good 3-point shooters, that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the same with most things, technique will only get you so far, natural talent is the deciding factor</p>

All shooting issues ultimately comes back to mechanics, maybe it’s a subtle thing, maybe it’s drastic…but it’s all mechanics and muscle memory.</p>

<p>Compare it to golf, sure some people can be undisciplined and still crush a ball, but I’d argue virtually anyone could become solid at golf with enough focus on perfect technique and practice.</p>

<p>Think you’re way off here….guys like Brook Lopez reinventing themselves late in his career as a shooter perfectly proves the point.</p>

      <label for="lj2es90" class="commentText"><p>I wasn&rsquo;t talking about the look of a shot, I am talking about the fundamentals of what you are told by a coach is a good shot release etc. Most coaches have said Steps Shoot goes against everything they would teach, he doesn&rsquo;t square his body, and his release is very different, hence why most coaches say not to try and copy Steph, his talent is the reason it works. Amen has decent shot mechanics and fundamentals (while a little slow) he just isn&rsquo;t a good shooter, his aim is not good, and he doesn&rsquo;t have much feel for the shot.</p>

<p>Brook is a great example of what I&rsquo;m talking about, he started as a back-to-the-basket post player, but always had the talent for shooting, his mid-range fades, for example, were always good, he just didn&rsquo;t use it that often, and then when he went to Milwaukee he adopted a three-point shot, because he already had the form and the talent for shooting it came along and is now a premier shooting big.</p>

<p>For every player who develops an outside shot there are multiple others who never do. Things like balance, depth perception, hand eye coordination, etc aren&rsquo;t just easily fixed with mechanics. </p>

      <label for="lj2noj1" class="commentText"><p>I’m not talking about overall shooting coaching, not just literally what you’re defining as “mechanics”.</p>

<p>The only variable that can’t be accounted for is mental, but none of us can comment on how that factors into any given player and it’s lazy to use it in order to fill in the gaps.</p>

<p>Also one thing you’re overlooking is that you have to hardwire all this coaching with tons and tons of repetition, which is where most players aren’t willing to commit, even if they accept coaching and fix their mechanics.</p>

<p>But yes, with enough coaching and repetition, any player <strong>can</strong> become a solid shooter. But it’s the amount of coaching and practice, the quality of coaching and the willingness for the player to fully buy in and put up thousands of shots, are big variables to consider.</p>

      <label for="lj2a4xy" class="commentText"><p>This is an interesting and imo convincing perspective but it does wrinkle against my intuition. Not that shooting is genetic obviously, but I just intuitively feel that even with perfect mechanics someone can still be bad at shooting. But as you just pointed out that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense, whether the ball goes in or not is 100% a result of the mechanics of shooting</p>

      <label for="lj2czjs" class="commentText"><p>Enough practice and corrected mechanics would overwrite the “feel” you’re talking about. I think you might be conflating perfect mechanics with perfect visual mechanics…someone can have a pretty shot and still suck. But I can guarantee there are subtleties that a shooting coach could correct with enough time, that is causing that shot to be poor. Maybe it’s balance from the feet that can be improved, maybe it’s not focusing on the target or ball the right way, maybe the pressure of the guide hand needs to be tweaked etc…</p>

      <label for="lj3ng2n" class="commentText"><p>Yeah…that’s kind of the expectation when it comes to professional athletes trying to improve, targeted coaching and spending every day getting as many reps as possible.</p>

<p>You make it seem like it’s some linear trend, like they need X amount of hours to move up each percentage point. Simply working on mechanics and reinforcing them with practice can easily provide a jump to average shooting, the path to above average might be lofty, but who knows. Lonzo changed his entire shot in an offseason and it changed everything, it’s possible. With shots that broken, just resetting the form could move the needle a lot. Ausar will have access to the same coach that fixed Lonzo, and who is one of the best shooting guru’s in the league….I’m not saying it will definitely happen, but it’s silly to do confidently rule it out.</p>

<p>Also other guys have had crazy low percentages their rookie years and then made huge jumps as they got into their careers. KD, Bron and Dirk all shot in the high 20’s their rookie year…I realize the Thompson twins are in the teens, but point remains shooting can improve dramatically.</p>

      <label for="lj41st7" class="commentText"><p>My point is that the Thompson twins are way behind other ‘bad’ shooters who needed tons of practice and repetition to become acceptable shooters, and they’ll need a correspondingly greater amount of time to reach even below average. Lonzo, for example, was <em>way</em> ahead of the Thompson twins as a shooter when he entered the league. The Thompson twins need to improve dramatically just to be bad-but-promising as shooters.</p>

      <label for="lj47su7" class="commentText"><p>You don’t know that, you are just speaking generally and making assumptions. None of us are involved in professional nba player development…you know have any evidence to support the claim of “thousands and thousands of hours” being needed..neither of us actually know whether their shots are unfixable or how effective various development approaches could be.</p>

<p>Generally speaking though, if it’s possible to complete tear down someone’s form and create a completely new one in an off-season, anything is possible with the right guidance and enough practice.</p>

<p>Like I said, you’re oversimplifying things and acting like it has to be linear growth, they could overhaul their mechanics, or tap into certain cues that help them, or just have something click that makes a dramatic difference over one summer, strictly because it’s the first time being around professional programs…who knows, guys have made non-linear jumps before (Suggs went from 21% to 40% in two years) let’s just see what happens instead of making absolute stances.</p>

      <label for="lj49teh" class="commentText"><p>I don’t know why you’re fixated on their shots being ‘fixable’ or ‘unfixable’ (not just with me, up and down this thread). It’s not about whether their shots are fundamentally broken, it’s about the fact that becoming a good shooter requires <em>practice</em>. That’s basketball. Good shooting isn’t just something you stumble across.</p>

<p>Yes, you can tear down bad form and rebuild it in an offseason. But <em>that doesn’t automatically make you a good shooter</em>. Being a good shooter requires repetition to build muscle memory. I know that because I’ve played basketball my whole life. I’m skeptical that you’ve ever played organized ball.</p>

<p>In Jalen Suggs you invoke yet another player <em>who was way ahead of the Thompson twins</em> when he entered the league. His percentages were higher and his attempts were way higher.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not convinced they&rsquo;ll ever learn to shoot, to be honest, although certainly they can&rsquo;t be worse.

      <label for="lj2mod4" class="commentText"><p>Because it’s ridiculously hard to improve your jump shot. People here seem to think if you practice, you’ll improve but that’s not always the case. A lot of it is innate hand eye coordination. The Thompson twins works extremely hard and they tried improving their jump shot in OTE where that was their primary focus on improvement. Same now that they are in the league with their NBA teams. They clearly work hard but just like they were born with amazing athleticism, they were also born with below average shooting ability for an NBA player. You can improve it like Al Horford or Herb Jones but those are unlikely outcomes compared to the average outcome which is only a slight improvement. If they ever even get to average, it’s a huge win for them. </p>

He&rsquo;s good in transition but his lack of shooting and handles really hurts him in half court sets.  He was a turnover machine when he tried to initiate early in the season.  It&rsquo;s hard to do much when your defender can sag and dare you to shoot.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s decent enough as a 3rd/2nd option and for running in transition but in half court his job is to get the ball to Fred/Jalen/Sengun/Shep.</p>

      <label for="lj2rm8j" class="commentText"><p>Some people are just able to take a mental leap and discover a new way of thinking about shooting. Maybe it’s as simple as a tweak in the way they hold the ball, maybe it’s something more complicated. I think Kawhi was always a good shooter at heart he just needed confidence and a little jump</p>

</blockquote>

<p>If you want to look at him purely as a starter, which is 23 games and 31 minutes per game. He is averaging 14/10/4/2/1 on TS 61%, with positive +/- 2.8 and only USG% of 18%, and defense is already one of his best asset. In fact, of his 10 rebounds per game as a starter, <strong>4</strong> are offensive rebounds, which would put him in super elite category. If he was given the opportunity to focus on more defensive rebounds ala. Westbrook, he could easily have 14-15 rebounds per game.</p>

<p>All his advanced stats indicate he is one of the most productive players not just on the team, but in the entire league. He literally is in elite company when it comes to several stats already.</p>

<p>His one core weakness is shooting, and whilst it is a big limitation, he is good at practically everything else.</p>

      <label for="lj67jqb" class="commentText"><p>I think the point of this post (kind of) was that he is good in a vacuum, but his fit with the Rockets is questionable.  Worth noting that he got those starting minutes mostly due to injuries (particularly Sengun going down).  A common refrain in the NBA draft community which I think applies here, is that there are many archetypes of player that can be productive as the star of a team built around them, but the best role players tend to look a lot alike.  Amen is someone who might kind of have to be a &ldquo;star&rdquo; (i.e. have roster construction catered to him) to be a great player.</p>

      <label for="lj3ibjj" class="commentText"><p>I guess, but Amen is already a worse shooter than Gordon was when he came into the league and in an era that shoots much more than 10 years ago. I also don’t think he is big enough to really provide the rim protection and rebounding that Gordon gives.</p>

<p>It’s not impossible to build a team around Amen that could make him look good, but to that point lots of flawed players could in theory look better if you have a perfect fitting team around them. If playing Amen requires an elite-shooting big next to him for example, that limits your ability to build the best team available.</p>

      <label for="lj2tzwt" class="commentText"><p>I think the fit between him and Sengun still works as Al-P learns to stretch the floor a bit more and Udoka starts to use him as a ball handler/facilitator more so that Amen can roam that dunker spot and as a cutter with a clear paint.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m cautiously optimistic that Amen is just such a unique player that they have to prioritize finding a way to fit him in until his handle comes around enough to play him on-ball more as well. Vanvleet and Brooks wont be there long term so I think it&rsquo;s about Amen&rsquo;s fit with Reed Sheppard, JG, Jabari and Sengun. The shooting upside of that group as well as Whitmore and Eason is good enough to justify Amen being a perpetual non-shooter</p>

      <label for="lj2xfym" class="commentText"><p>I like this way of thinking, although a lot depends on Sengun being willing to launch 4 or 5 threes per game. Jokic figured it out, Sabonis never really did, so who knows.</p>

<p>But yes, it&rsquo;s hard to know about Sheppard right now, but theoretically I&rsquo;m on board with him and Amen as the backcourt. I&rsquo;m lower on Jabari than most, but having a legitimate shooting threat who can also defend the rim is such a luxury that he almost has to be in any core going forward. Who you put at the other two spots depends on if you keep Sengun, Green, both, or neither.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why the Rockets are so fun!</p>

<p>Outside of the championship contenders’ various trials and travails, the Rockets’ player development and rotation might be the most interesting storyline in the league next season.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought it was just me! Great write-up as usual.</p>

<p>People say Green and Sengun have not proven they can be on the court together, and while that may be true, your point about Sengun and Amen is the bigger problem. Besides an Amen miracle, it&rsquo;s still possible that Sengun will develop a three ball, which would also solve it, but I&rsquo;m not holding my breath for that one either.</p>

<p>It will be a crime if we don&rsquo;t roll out the small ball lineup with all of our athletes. Like everyone else, I love Adams, but I just don&rsquo;t see him getting regular minutes.</p>

<p>On a related note: here are the Houston players deserving rotation minutes next year: Fred VanVleet, Dillon Brooks, Alperen Şengün, Steven Adams, Jalen Green, Jabari Smith Jr., Amen Thompson, Tari Eason, Reed Sheppard, Cam Whitmore, Jae’Sean Tate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People really be making too much of this. FVV is on his last guaranteed year, we pass on his team option next year unless Reed or Amen really don&rsquo;t improve/look ready to take over starting PG. If he wants to return as a vet bench presence/locker room guy on a cheap contract, great. If he still wants a big contract we move on.</p>

<p>AlP is closest thing to untouchable we have right now. All the trade rumors are just that: rumors. Especially from other FO trying to poach him, NOT from our FO.</p>

<p>Green is in a make or break year. If he sucks for <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the season again like his first 3 years, we let him walk or match in RFA if teams lowball him and prob position him as 6th man and focus on developing Cam over him. If he&rsquo;s consistently good to great and can hit even 80% of his production from March last year for most of the year we max him.</p>

<p>We should get out from under Brooks&rsquo; contract ASAP, while the rest of the league still thinks he&rsquo;s a net positive player. After a hot start shooting last season he reverted to chucking us out of games way more than his defense helped win games. Again, hopefully Tari/Amen/Cam are ready to take over his minutes.</p>

<p>Landale or Adams, we choose whoever performs better. Landale looked good at the end of the season when Sengun went down and carried it into Team Australia at the Olympics. Adams is coming off injury and we don&rsquo;t know how well he will recover, but if he&rsquo;s healthy his screening could be huge for our guards.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve BEEN trying to get out from under Tate lol. Holiday is good as gone.</p>

<p>IMO our ideal future roster is</p>

<p>Sheppard/Green/Eason/Smith Jr/Sengun</p>

<p>Van Vleet/Whitmore/Thompson/Jeff Green/Adams or Landale</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a solid 9-10 man rotation with enough minutes for everyone to develop.</p>

<p>He really can finish at the rim at an elite level and has good court vision, so I’m not really worried about him being a non shooter in the playoffs. And his ability to legitimately guard 1-5 on defense is so valuable.</p>

<p>Rockets have really tricky decisions to make. I think I’m out on sengun. People are enamored with him because his game is similar to jokic’s but I don’t see him ever hitting that next level. He also destroys your lineup flexibility. I think my ideal starting 5 down the line is a sheppard / thompson back court with Cam Whitmore (I think Cam is a big time player), Jabari smith Jr. and an athletic center. That’s a championship level team that will probably lead the league in defense and be pretty good offensively, as well.</p>

      <label for="lj3fyxt" class="commentText"><p>For this year, Amen being the backup PG that can do wonders creating for Taxman and Whitmore and defending alongside Tari and whichever is healthier of Adams and Jock.</p>

<p>Leading the best bench unit in the NBA is good enough for this season. We’ll see how he develops from there. Next offseason is when GM Stone has to make the really tough decisions regarding the Core 7.</p>

      <label for="lj2udsm" class="commentText"><p>I did some research on mapping/predicting career 3pt percentage recently.  The <a href="https://hoopsandhoos.substack.com/p/nba-draft-prediction-of-nba-three" target="_blank">study</a> I&rsquo;m referencing looks at college 3pt%, 3pt volume, and free throw percentage and uses a linear regression to predict nba 3pt percentage of everyone drafted since 1994 who attempted at least 1 three a game in college and 1 three in the nba within around 5%.</p>

<p>If you plug Amen&rsquo;s Overtime Elite stats into this formula, you get him coming in around 30%, which puts him firmly in the territory of being likely <em>overrated</em> by the formula, as it starts messing up in the bottom 16% of shooters and gives them too much benefit of the doubt.  Many of the shooters predicted to do 30% shoot around 24-26%.  If he gets to league average (.366), he will have an argument for having the largest shooting percentage turnaround of any player drafted since these types of analytics have existed.</p>

<p>I would love to see him succeed, I think is game is incredibly interesting.  Overtime Elite stats are not NCAA stats, so the data is inherently flawed.  This was just for fun not bash him or anything, I just find it so interesting because when guys like this (Amen, Ausar, Ben Simmons, etc) come up, everyone is asking for &ldquo;Just a league average 3 ball&rdquo; like it&rsquo;s something super achievable when that is incredibly statistically unlikely.  People love to point out Derrick Rose, Mike Conley, Kawhi, etc, but those are outliers, and guys like Ben, Ausar, and Amen would be extreme outliers even amongst the group of outliers.</p>

      <label for="lj2y2gs" class="commentText"><p>Agreed. That&rsquo;s why in the beginning of this post I say that the team needs to start planning on how to incorporate Amen assuming he can&rsquo;t shoot. Unless you want to use someone like Brook Lopez as an example (and he&rsquo;s both rare and different), like you say, nobody has ever improved from this level to anything approaching average.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s far more likely that Thompson either becomes an Aaron Gordon-esque player or a really solid point guard than a mediocre shooter, if we&rsquo;re talking <em>most likely</em> paths to success. But I&rsquo;m dreaming even bigger for him, and I think he can be an All-Star guy even without a shot.</p>

      <label for="lj3hhdt" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m completely on board. I love his game.  He has the potential to be a multiple time DPOY while being a good facilitator and interior scorer.  I mostly just wanted to word vomit about the chances he&rsquo;ll become a mediocre shooter, I think he has a really good chance at being a great player as long as he&rsquo;s surrounded by shooters and has the right defensive system that funnels people at him all night.</p>

We had the chance to observe Lopez this summer during an open gym session at the LeBron James Skills Academy, where we were surprised to see that he can even shoot the ball with consistency out to the NBA three point line.
