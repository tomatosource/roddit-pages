      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1ewykin/amen_thompson_was_one_of_the_worst_shooters_in/"><p>Amen Thompson was one of the worst shooters in NBA history. The Rockets need to play him more.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Did you collect stuff as a kid?</p>

<p>If you were anything like me, you had a bedroom filled with random knickknacks. I had a wooden carving of a Komodo dragon, a replica katana, a gold doubloon supposedly from a pirate ship (it was not), a cutout of Kobe Bryant’s 81-point box score from my local paper, Pokémon cards, and much more.</p>

<p>Individually, these were all incredibly cool (*<em>cut to my wife vigorously shaking her head</em>*). But taken together, they were overwhelming. No piece could shine; there wasn’t enough room. The dragon blocked the full view of the sword, the Pokemon cards were covering up the box score, and the doubloon, neglected and unshined, just looked like a big, rusty penny. The whole presentation was far less than the sum of its component parts, which, again, were awesome.</p>

<p>On a related note: here are the Houston players deserving rotation minutes next year: Fred VanVleet, Dillon Brooks, Alperen Şengün, Steven Adams, Jalen Green, Jabari Smith Jr., Amen Thompson, Tari Eason, Reed Sheppard, Cam Whitmore, Jae’Sean Tate. That is *11* players, excluding quality depth options like Aaron Holiday and Jeff Green.</p>

<p>That’s a lot of shiny talent. Most of those players are still on rookie contracts, too, meaning there’s plenty of room for improvement — but also an unspoken need to put up stats to justify significant contract extensions. Could the team’s fierce competition for minutes, desire for shooting around Şengün, and win-now mentality under coach Ime Udoka squeeze Amen Thompson, the flawed but exciting sophomore?</p>

<p>You know Thompson’s three-pointer was as broken as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1-WpWOUk8" target="_blank">lovelytheband song</a>, but it was even worse than you likely realized. For his entire rookie season, he shot just 8-for-58 from deep. By comparison, I counted 11 shots that missed the rim entirely. That’s not a good ratio for a sixth-grader, much less an NBA player. In the league&rsquo;s history, only five other players have <a href="https://stathead.com/basketball/player-season-finder.cgi?request=1&amp;ccomp%5B1%5D=lt&amp;cval%5B1%5D=.15&amp;cstat%5B1%5D=fg3_pct&amp;ccomp%5B2%5D=gt&amp;cval%5B2%5D=50&amp;cstat%5B2%5D=fg3a" target="_blank">attempted at least 50 threes and hit fewer than 15% of them</a>. (It’s probably not worth pointing out that Michael Jordan, Hall of Famer Dennis Johnson, and DeMar DeRozan are three of the other five, so I won’t.)</p>

<p>Teams stashed their center or absolute worst defender on him almost from the get-go. Nearly every three-pointer he took was a practice shot: <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1641708/shots-dash?SeasonType=Regular+Season&amp;dir=A&amp;PerMode=Totals" target="_blank">57 of his 58 attempts were considered “open” or “wide-open”</a> in the NBA’s tracking data. Yet even the shots that miraculously caught the rim didn’t have an alibi: [<a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/amen-thompson-and-fitting-star-shaped" target="_blank">click for video of a hideous miss</a>]</p>

<p>Hopefully, he’ll develop a better shot (it certainly can’t get worse), but it’s foolish to assume he’ll approach league average in the next couple of seasons. So why should Houston bother featuring him?</p>

<p>Thompson was *so good* at nearly every other part of basketball, particularly for a rookie who had seldom faced college or overseas competition before the season. He is one of the most unique players in the NBA and will only get better.</p>

<p>Despite his long-distance troubles, Thompson still hit nearly 60% on twos. His outrageous combination of physical tools propelled him to more favorable areas of the court: t<a href="https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/5216/lineups?off=3761#tab-four_factors" target="_blank">wo-thirds of his shots occurred at the rim</a>, more than most centers. Most rookies struggle with NBA shotblocking and athleticism when they get to the paint; per Cleaning the Glass, Thompson converted an excellent 67.4% at the hoop, better than Bam Adebayo, Jaylen Brown, or Zion Williamson (!!).</p>

<p>His athleticism stood out even in a league full of standout athletes, but unlike many rookies, he applied it correctly by pushing the ball in transition at every opportunity. According to Synergy, Thompson was in the 96th percentile for the proportion of possessions finished on the break. Defenses can’t sag off of him if he outraces them to the goal: [<a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/amen-thompson-and-fitting-star-shaped" target="_blank">click here for video</a>]</p>

<p>Thompson’s handle is a little raw, but he’s 21 years old. That’s one of the easiest things for young players to improve. It’s harder to improve passing instincts, and Thompson already possesses those in spades. He’s a quick reactor and excellent floor-mapper: [<a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/amen-thompson-and-fitting-star-shaped" target="_blank">click here for video</a>]</p>

<p>Plus, who doesn’t love 35-foot bounce passes? [<a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/amen-thompson-and-fitting-star-shaped" target="_blank">click here for video</a>]</p>

<p>Thompson is a savvy cutter for a player used to having the ball in his hands. He knows defenses are ignoring him. If his mark strays too far, he waits for the opportune time to cut backdoor and dunk things others would’ve laid up: [<a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/amen-thompson-and-fitting-star-shaped" target="_blank">click for video</a>]</p>

<p>Thompson also had the <a href="https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/players?stat_category=defense_rebounding" target="_blank">highest offensive rebounding rate of anyone under 6’8”</a> (min. 500 minutes). He was often stationed in the dunker spot, providing him with plenty of opportunity to chase misses, and he has as good a second leap as anyone in the league, letting him beat opposing bigs to an airborne ball. Thompson has a highlight reel full of nifty putback dunks, but this spinning tip off an airball is an even better illustration of his coordination: [<a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/amen-thompson-and-fitting-star-shaped" target="_blank">click for video</a>]</p>

<p>He has a nose for the ball, an F1 motor, and the rare ability to chase offensive rebounds without compromising transition defense (and he’s nearly as good a glass-cleaner on that end, too).</p>

<p>Speaking of defense, Thompson was one of the best perimeter rookie defenders we’ve ever seen. He was in the <a href="https://dunksandthrees.com/epm" target="_blank">95th percentile in Defensive EPM</a> (only Tari Eason ranked higher on the Rockets) and <a href="https://www.bball-index.com/leaderboards-tool/" target="_blank">led the team in D-LEBRON.</a> Thompson earned Udoka’s trust with his performances on big names, frequently matching up with the likes of Devin Booker, Tyrese Haliburton, Kevin Durant, and Jalen Williams. He posted excellent defensive playmaking numbers, averaging exactly two steals and a block per 36 minutes.</p>

<p>Thompson can guard the full length of the court, and he’s already one of the better screen navigators in the game. Even when he gets brushed, his length and lateral quickness get him right back into the action: [<a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/amen-thompson-and-fitting-star-shaped" target="_blank">video here</a>]</p>

<p>Despite the new positionless awards voting, in which bigs vacuum up most of the All-Defensive-Team slots, I’d be shocked if Thompson doesn’t get a nod in the next few seasons.</p>

<p>Although Thompson spent most of his life as an on-ball player, the Rockets used him in various ways, from traditional point guard to full-blown center. After Şengün went down with an injury late in the season, Thompson started setting more screens while using the short roll to his advantage. Houston often took advantage of his versatility by making him a hand-off hub at the top, usually with VanVleet and/or Green. He could pick out cutters, hit FVV or Green for open triples, or take the ball to the rack himself. Really, there’s nothing he can’t do!</p>

<p>Oh wait, he can’t shoot. Right.</p>

<p>So how does he fit? On a different team, he’d be treated like the good version of Ben Simmons: play on-ball more, push the team in transition as much as possible, attack the boards, and lock down the other team’s best ballhandler.</p>

<p>But on this crowded Houston roster, Thompson might be fourth in the pecking order behind steady VanVleet, thrilling Green, and post hub Şengün, competing for touches with Sheppard, Brooks, and Whitmore. His defense, rebounding, cutting, screen-setting, and off-ball activity make up for his spacing deficiencies, and he was a big part of Houston’s late-season push for the playoffs, but he’s undoubtedly an untraditional player whose two best roles are currently occupied by superior (for now) teammates. He’s a star-shaped peg trying to fit into a round hole.</p>

<p>Thompson needs more time to accentuate his strengths and mitigate his most glaring weakness, but the Rockets may not give him that. Udoka has vowed to make a playoff push, and two offseasons in a row, they’ve been linked to win-now moves (that never materialized).</p>

<p>Thompson isn’t going to fall out of the rotation, but there are reasons for Udoka not to give him top-six minutes. His current handle and shooting limit him as a point guard, and the Rockets already have Fred VanVleet running the show. The Rockets’ offense was generally worse with Thompson on the court than off, with one major exception: Jabari Smith at small-ball center lineups, which we saw a lot after Şengün’s late-season injury. <a href="https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/5216/lineups?C=5092&amp;on=5216#tab-four_factors" target="_blank">Those were reasonable offensively and excellent defensively</a>. In those groups, Thompson can act more like a center on offense by screening, rolling, and hovering in the dunker spot while Smith spaces from the three-point line. If he can’t be the point guard, being the sole paint presence is the next best thing.</p>

<p>But when healthy, Houston already has a borderline-All-Star big man in Şengün, so those minutes with Smith at center will be limited unless the Rockets make a move. Şengün’s name has floated in and out of trade rumors since Udoka took over, as the coach has traditionally preferred a more defensive-minded center. Those whispers quieted some after Şengün’s breakout performance last season, but with the Turkish youngster almost certain to ask for a rookie max extension, they’ll likely resurface again.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong: <a href="https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-indecisive-flamingo-has-arrived" target="_blank">I’m also quite high on the indecisive flamingo</a>. In fact, I’m high on nearly every player on the Rockets, individually. But like my scattershot childhood collection, there’s just too much to look at. Houston has *so* many budding talents that featuring some will inevitably stunt the growth of others, like trees fighting for the same patches of sunlight in a forest. It’s a good problem to have, but it’s a problem nonetheless.</p>

<p>Truthfully, I’m not sure how it all shakes out. Outside of the championship contenders’ various trials and travails, the Rockets’ player development and rotation might be the most interesting storyline in the league next season. There are so many interesting configurations to try, and it’s up to Udoka to figure out how to maximize everyone.</p>

<p>But I do know this: the Rockets don’t have a player with a higher ceiling than Amen Thompson. One way or another, I hope Houston puts him in a position to reach it.</p>

He would be best on a team with 4 mobile shooters around him like the Rockets late in the year but thats not compatible with Sengun obviously</p>

I talk about it a little, but Jalen Green and Sengun&rsquo;s contract extensions will be fascinating. I bet the Rockets don&rsquo;t even know who they want to keep yet.</p>

      <label for="lj2a0sy" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t agree at all, shooting is a talent, hence why some guys with seemingly fine mechanics can still struggle to shoot the 3 e.g. Kyle Kuzma or Kelly Oubre, compared to guys who by most textbook standards have bad form but are good to great 3 point shooters e.g. Lamelo, Steph.</p>

<p>If all it took were getting someone&rsquo;s mechanics and form better, most players would just work on that and be good 3-point shooters, that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the same with most things, technique will only get you so far, natural talent is the deciding factor</p>

      <label for="lj2cdfv" class="commentText"><p>I never said anything about mechanics just looking better…if you think mechanics are just a visual thing, there’s your problem. All shooting issues ultimately comes back to mechanics, maybe it’s a subtle thing, maybe it’s drastic…but it’s all mechanics and muscle memory.</p>

<p>Compare it to golf, sure some people can be undisciplined and still crush a ball, but I’d argue virtually anyone could become solid at golf with enough focus on perfect technique and practice.</p>

<p>Think you’re way off here….guys like Brook Lopez reinventing themselves late in his career as a shooter perfectly proves the point.</p>

      <label for="lj2es90" class="commentText"><p>I wasn&rsquo;t talking about the look of a shot, I am talking about the fundamentals of what you are told by a coach is a good shot release etc. Most coaches have said Steps Shoot goes against everything they would teach, he doesn&rsquo;t square his body, and his release is very different, hence why most coaches say not to try and copy Steph, his talent is the reason it works. Amen has decent shot mechanics and fundamentals (while a little slow) he just isn&rsquo;t a good shooter, his aim is not good, and he doesn&rsquo;t have much feel for the shot.</p>

<p>Brook is a great example of what I&rsquo;m talking about, he started as a back-to-the-basket post player, but always had the talent for shooting, his mid-range fades, for example, were always good, he just didn&rsquo;t use it that often, and then when he went to Milwaukee he adopted a three-point shot, because he already had the form and the talent for shooting it came along and is now a premier shooting big.</p>

      <label for="lj2md3a" class="commentText"><p>I feel like saying it&rsquo;s all mechanics would be an amazing thing to say as a coach but not as a GM. You can&rsquo;t just say any player can become a serviceable shooter through mechanics changes or all anyone would draft is bad shooters and try and fix them. </p>

<p>For every player who develops an outside shot there are multiple others who never do. Things like balance, depth perception, hand eye coordination, etc aren&rsquo;t just easily fixed with mechanics. </p>

But as you just pointed out that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense, whether the ball goes in or not is 100% a result of the mechanics of shooting</p>

I think you might be conflating perfect mechanics with perfect visual mechanics…someone can have a pretty shot and still suck. But I can guarantee there are subtleties that a shooting coach could correct with enough time, that is causing that shot to be poor. Maybe it’s balance from the feet that can be improved, maybe it’s not focusing on the target or ball the right way, maybe the pressure of the guide hand needs to be tweaked etc…</p>

      <label for="lj2mod4" class="commentText"><p>Because it’s ridiculously hard to improve your jump shot. People here seem to think if you practice, you’ll improve but that’s not always the case. A lot of it is innate hand eye coordination. The Thompson twins works extremely hard and they tried improving their jump shot in OTE where that was their primary focus on improvement. Same now that they are in the league with their NBA teams. They clearly work hard but just like they were born with amazing athleticism, they were also born with below average shooting ability for an NBA player. </p>

<p>On a related note: here are the Houston players deserving rotation minutes next year: Fred VanVleet, Dillon Brooks, Alperen Şengün, Steven Adams, Jalen Green, Jabari Smith Jr., Amen Thompson, Tari Eason, Reed Sheppard, Cam Whitmore, Jae’Sean Tate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People really be making too much of this. FVV is on his last guaranteed year, we pass on his team option next year unless Reed or Amen really don&rsquo;t improve/look ready to take over starting PG. If he wants to return as a vet bench presence/locker room guy on a cheap contract, great. If he still wants a big contract we move on.</p>

<p>AlP is closest thing to untouchable we have right now. All the trade rumors are just that: rumors. Especially from other FO trying to poach him, NOT from our FO.</p>

<p>Green is in a make or break year. If he sucks for <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the season again like his first 3 years, we let him walk or match in RFA if teams lowball him and prob position him as 6th man and focus on developing Cam over him. If he&rsquo;s consistently good to great and can hit even 80% of his production from March last year for most of the year we max him.</p>

<p>We should get out from under Brooks&rsquo; contract ASAP, while the rest of the league still thinks he&rsquo;s a net positive player. After a hot start shooting last season he reverted to chucking us out of games way more than his defense helped win games. Again, hopefully Tari/Amen/Cam are ready to take over his minutes.</p>

<p>Landale or Adams, we choose whoever performs better. Landale looked good at the end of the season when Sengun went down and carried it into Team Australia at the Olympics. Adams is coming off injury and we don&rsquo;t know how well he will recover, but if he&rsquo;s healthy his screening could be huge for our guards.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve BEEN trying to get out from under Tate lol. Holiday is good as gone.</p>

<p>IMO our ideal future roster is</p>

<p>Sheppard/Green/Eason/Smith Jr/Sengun</p>

<p>Van Vleet/Whitmore/Thompson/Jeff Green/Adams or Landale</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a solid 9-10 man rotation with enough minutes for everyone to develop.</p>

      <label for="lj2kqyz" class="commentText"><p>I think he’s a very special player. He’s also the only player I’ve ever thought to myself “man, he’d be a serious problem if he could shoot 28% from 3”.</p>

<p>He really can finish at the rim at an elite level and has good court vision, so I’m not really worried about him being a non shooter in the playoffs. And his ability to legitimately guard 1-5 on defense is so valuable.</p>

<p>Rockets have really tricky decisions to make. I think I’m out on sengun. People are enamored with him because his game is similar to jokic’s but I don’t see him ever hitting that next level. He also destroys your lineup flexibility. I think my ideal starting 5 down the line is a sheppard / thompson back court with Cam Whitmore (I think Cam is a big time player), Jabari smith Jr. and an athletic center. That’s a championship level team that will probably lead the league in defense and be pretty good offensively, as well.</p>

      <label for="lj2ipvo" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;ve been loosely following the Thompson bros, and it seems they have very similar skill sets and deficiencies. It seems that Ausar has more of a chance to get minutes in a terrible Pistons team, and thus could develop faster or shine more than Amen.</p>
