      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fnjrjw/serious_why_defenders_didnt_foul_harder_to/"><p>[Serious] Why defenders didn&rsquo;t foul harder to prevent an And-1 situation when opponents foul bait?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I always think about one thing: A defender is facing a foul-baiting master like Luka and SGA, or even the highest average free throw attempts per game holder these past years: Joel Embiid, these kinds of players always find a way to let the refs blow the whistle and make a shooting motion, some of them also can create an And-1 chance when do foul baiting.</p>

<p>But if the foul is inevitable, why they didn&rsquo;t just hug those opponents like a young little girl holding her teddy bear? I mean if the defender didn&rsquo;t do any dangerous move like kick the sensitive area, 360-degree punch or headlock, it&rsquo;s ok to just hug your opponent harder when they foul bait to let them shoot 2 shots that have a chance to miss one, rather than give them a chance to get 3 or even 4 points right?</p>

<p>You want to avoid harming yourself by hugging a heavy player with momentum.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have the time or space to do much more than interrupt the shooting motion.</p>

      <label for="loit5ec" class="commentText"><p>And I think the strategy shouldn&rsquo;t be to foul harder, but to continue to play as long as the offensive player continues to play after the whistle. Warriors did this a lot. They wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily foul harder, but if a player was continuing their gather after a foul, they would continue to foul until the shot was altered enough to not go in. It doesn&rsquo;t even need to be continue to foul, but continue to try to stop the shot even if it means fouling.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s a smart thing to do, as long as you don&rsquo;t go overboard or goaltend.</p>

      <label for="loiutfp" class="commentText"><p>Totally agree here that it would be wrong for the NBA to punish defenders who continue to defend after the whistle because they allow offensive players to keep going after the whistle.</p>

<p>Letter of the law it&rsquo;s a dead ball foul technical if you rotated over to block the shot attempt after the whistle and ended up fouling the offensive player again, but they shouldn&rsquo;t enforce it.</p>

      <label for="loivfm5" class="commentText"><p>Oh, interesting. I actually did not know that and it changes things in terms of strategy. I just don&rsquo;t think the Warriors ever got called for a tech when they did it. I thought it was smart and didn&rsquo;t know it was against the rules. Maybe the strategy is to do it until you get called for a tech and then stop.</p>

<p>It’s not just easy to bear hug someone as big as Joel or Luka or someone as slippery as Shai.</p>

<p>On top of that, defenders aren’t thinking “the foul is inevitable.” They are thinking “defend without fouling.”</p>

<p>Theres also the fact people get away with non hard fouls on players like these all the time, and the fact that defenders don’t want to risk hurting people.</p>

<p>It’s a calculated risk and mostly hindsight bias to say hard foul everytime but over the course of a game players probably get away with fouls more often than giving up and-1s. The shooter also has to make the FT too which isn’t 100% guaranteed. </p>

      <label for="loiui6k" class="commentText"><p>To your point OP, I don&rsquo;t get why players don&rsquo;t commit a 2nd foul after the 1st.</p>

<p>If the offensive player is allowed to continue to play after the whistle, then I, as a defender, will absolutely be trying to defend thay offensive player still.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think the NBA can justify giving players a &ldquo;free&rdquo; run at the shot after the initial foul call by enforcing the technical dead ball foul on such a play. But we are living in the era where it&rsquo;s all about offense so maybe they would T you up.</p>

      <label for="lois0qo" class="commentText"><p>it’s not like these players get fouls called on every pump fake or foul baiting move, you just remember everytime they get fouled vs the times they throw up a horrible shot or pass out after their foul bait doesn’t work. So if you have players commit to a hard foul for every pump fake, then you are wasting fouls on plays that might’ve not been called a foul at all. The defender should only commit to a hard foul if they are intentionally fouling or they already know it will be called a foul. By the time the whistle is blown, the ball has already been shot and the defender can’t foul harder.</p>

Harder fouling can also possibly become a flagrant foul. You&rsquo;re right that soft ticky tack fouls are worse than at least prventing the FG but things in the court happen in hundredths of seconds</p>
