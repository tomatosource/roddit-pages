      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1fnjrjw/serious_why_defenders_didnt_foul_harder_to/"><p>[Serious] Why defenders didn&rsquo;t foul harder to prevent an And-1 situation when opponents foul bait?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>I always think about one thing: A defender is facing a foul-baiting master like Luka and SGA, or even the highest average free throw attempts per game holder these past years: Joel Embiid, these kinds of players always find a way to let the refs blow the whistle and make a shooting motion, some of them also can create an And-1 chance when do foul baiting.</p>

<p>But if the foul is inevitable, why they didn&rsquo;t just hug those opponents like a young little girl holding her teddy bear? I mean if the defender didn&rsquo;t do any dangerous move like kick the sensitive area, 360-degree punch or headlock, it&rsquo;s ok to just hug your opponent harder when they foul bait to let them shoot 2 shots that have a chance to miss one, rather than give them a chance to get 3 or even 4 points right?</p>

<p>You want to avoid harming yourself by hugging a heavy player with momentum.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have the time or space to do much more than interrupt the shooting motion.</p>

      <label for="loit5ec" class="commentText"><p>And I think the strategy shouldn&rsquo;t be to foul harder, but to continue to play as long as the offensive player continues to play after the whistle. Warriors did this a lot. They wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily foul harder, but if a player was continuing their gather after a foul, they would continue to foul until the shot was altered enough to not go in. It doesn&rsquo;t even need to be continue to foul, but continue to try to stop the shot even if it means fouling.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s a smart thing to do, as long as you don&rsquo;t go overboard or goaltend.</p>

      <label for="loiutfp" class="commentText"><p>Totally agree here that it would be wrong for the NBA to punish defenders who continue to defend after the whistle because they allow offensive players to keep going after the whistle.</p>

<p>Letter of the law it&rsquo;s a dead ball foul technical if you rotated over to block the shot attempt after the whistle and ended up fouling the offensive player again, but they shouldn&rsquo;t enforce it.</p>

I just don&rsquo;t think the Warriors ever got called for a tech when they did it. I thought it was smart and didn&rsquo;t know it was against the rules. Maybe the strategy is to do it until you get called for a tech and then stop.</p>

      <label for="lojnldt" class="commentText"><p>Also, avoiding a foul is rarely inevitable, and avoiding a foul is the best result possible. Harden, Young, and Embiid all shoot above 85% from the line, so even if you could guarantee they wouldn&rsquo;t make the shot, fouling them gives them about 1.7-1.8 expected points. Avoiding a foul probably pushes that below 1 expected point, since if they&rsquo;re trying to foul-bait they probably aren&rsquo;t using a normal shooting motion. And refs have been trying to avoid giving out fouls on moves like rip-throughs and shots where the offensive player leans through the defender.</p>

<p>There are a few situations where a foul really is inevitable, like if a defender gets sucked into the air by a pump fake. But even in those situations, it would demand a quick and precise reaction by the defender to intentionally foul hard, but not so hard as to get a flagrant foul.</p>

<p>It’s not just easy to bear hug someone as big as Joel or Luka or someone as slippery as Shai.</p>

<p>On top of that, defenders aren’t thinking “the foul is inevitable.” They are thinking “defend without fouling.”</p>

<p>Theres also the fact people get away with non hard fouls on players like these all the time, and the fact that defenders don’t want to risk hurting people.</p>

      <label for="lojfue2" class="commentText"><p>100%, and I also want to add that the game is so fast paced that it is very difficult to process everythign happening all at once. You have to think about the players off the ball, the defensive scheme, the time and score, etc. on top of having to think about whether or not you have the ability to make the split second decision to foul someone hard or not. Not to mention all the grabbing and pushing that happens away from the play that might put you in a compromised position where you can&rsquo;t just fully wrap someone up.</p>

<p>It’s a calculated risk and mostly hindsight bias to say hard foul everytime but over the course of a game players probably get away with fouls more often than giving up and-1s. The shooter also has to make the FT too which isn’t 100% guaranteed. </p>

      <label for="lokne33" class="commentText"><p>KG told me this story about the first time he played Shaq, his rookie year with the Wolves.</p>

<p>Before the game he was getting himself hyped up, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to show Shaq who I am! He&rsquo;s going to know Da Kid!&rdquo; - early possession Shaq is posting up Felton Spencer, catches an entry pass from Derek Fisher and spins on Spencer. KG thinks &ldquo;Ok, I&rsquo;m going to foul the shit out of this mother fucker, he&rsquo;s going to know me&rdquo; and KG comes across the lane, swings both arms down and grabs Shaq as hard as he can and yells &ldquo;AHHH&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shaq jumps up with KG on his wrist and forearm, DUNKS, pulls his knees up and shakes the basket, lands. Turns his head to KG (and KG is really good at doing voices, so you have to imagine him doing a pitch perfect Shaq) and says</p>

<p>&ldquo;Son. Don&rsquo;t do that again&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the offensive player is allowed to continue to play after the whistle, then I, as a defender, will absolutely be trying to defend thay offensive player still.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think the NBA can justify giving players a &ldquo;free&rdquo; run at the shot after the initial foul call by enforcing the technical dead ball foul on such a play. But we are living in the era where it&rsquo;s all about offense so maybe they would T you up.</p>

      <label for="lois0qo" class="commentText"><p>it’s not like these players get fouls called on every pump fake or foul baiting move, you just remember everytime they get fouled vs the times they throw up a horrible shot or pass out after their foul bait doesn’t work. So if you have players commit to a hard foul for every pump fake, then you are wasting fouls on plays that might’ve not been called a foul at all. The defender should only commit to a hard foul if they are intentionally fouling or they already know it will be called a foul. By the time the whistle is blown, the ball has already been shot and the defender can’t foul harder.</p>

      <label for="loj8u3b" class="commentText"><p>Well because half of the time (if not more) someone &ldquo;foul baits&rdquo; they&rsquo;re not even trying to make the shot anyway. They just want 2 free throws because 2 free throws is more efficient to most players than any shot other than an open layup. So if you&rsquo;re the defender, you&rsquo;re just hoping you don&rsquo;t get called, you&rsquo;re not trying risk getting called for a flagrant to prevent an and-1 if the offensive player isn&rsquo;t even trying to go for it, not that you really have enough time to react and make that decision anyway</p>

      <label for="lojjzwd" class="commentText"><p>I mean, players aren&rsquo;t typically <em>trying</em> to foul, they&rsquo;re usually trying to defend cleanly.  The whole foul baiting thing doesn&rsquo;t actually work every time, it&rsquo;s not inevitable.  So if you started aggressively fouling, you&rsquo;d not only be giving them the foul every time, but you&rsquo;d actually just encourage more and more foul baiting to the point that you&rsquo;d start having role players do it.</p>

      <label for="lojl3kj" class="commentText"><p>I think the best scenario to execute what you suggest is when a defender bites on a pump fake and jumps. When the defender is clearly going to land on the shooter or close enough to be called for a foul, instead they lean back while falling and try to pull their arms out of the way. At this point, I think I would just say fuck it and foul the shooter on their shooting arm/hand. Not hard necessarily but enough to alter their shot. You&rsquo;re already 100% fouling them, might as well foul them.</p>

      <label for="lojq3dt" class="commentText"><p>If you&rsquo;re in a position with the leverage to sumo someone away from the rim without doing a full takedown, you&rsquo;re in position to contest the shot without fouling or to take a charge.</p>

<p>Usually when you foul you are not in that position, they have already beaten your footwork and gotten position on you, and you&rsquo;re not going to have that leverage to stop them by grabbing them, so I wouldn&rsquo;t expect to be an easy thing to do without an obvious flagrant or injuring someone. You really don&rsquo;t want to go around horse-collaring the other team in basketball; it&rsquo;s not a choke-slam sport. For one, on a flagrant they get the shot and the ball, for another somebody&rsquo;s going to go to the hospital and you&rsquo;re going to be in a lot of trouble, as will your future earnings (the income lost from a suspension for technicals is greater than the maximum fine than the NBA generally levies against players, so it&rsquo;s a worse punishment than it looks to be suspended), and for a third if you were to really commit to it there would be a good chance you might also fall down while doing it and hurt yourself.</p>

<p>People still hard foul a fair amount but it&rsquo;s not really workable to do it all the time against big, strong people who are moving very fast and have already gotten past you, and you&rsquo;re playing on a hardwood floor and tackling is illegal.</p>

      <label for="lojt4wu" class="commentText"><p>To add, old-school physical play especially on much lower levels includes a lot of basically this - pushing and grabbing and almost wrestling to stop shots - and there are still plenty of opportunities to deal with it, with good players still able to score. The techniques generally used to dribble and shoot the ball already do a lot to protect the ball in physical play when properly executed - people can still power-dribble, and it&rsquo;s not like a person doing a Eurostep would be just totally shocked and laid out by anybody trying to grab them as if it&rsquo;s never happened before; the gather protects the ball in traffic, and if they&rsquo;re strong enough they just score anyway. But of course they would make sure it would still look that way to the refs to try to get the and 1.</p>

      <label for="lokaik9" class="commentText"><p>if they foul any harder it&rsquo;d be called a flagrant</p>

<p>Even just hugging dudes these days while they are going up for a layup is called a flagrant 1 if the hugged player falls to the ground. 2 if they are a star player.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why you can&rsquo;t touch those players, players don&rsquo;t want to get fined if they get a tech or flagrant.</p>

<p>Also fans will call the hard foul dirty and bombard their social media.</p>

<p>Just take a look at<a href="https://youtu.be/ufOiMggc6pw?si=2iqnFNfgCKYaajCW" target="_blank"> this</a> video and the reaction from the refs/fans/other players to the hard fouls you are proposing.</p>

      <label for="lokf7vr" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m seeing a lot of valid points here, and I think the disconnect is that it&rsquo;s situational. In some situations, players should&rsquo;ve fouled harder or removed the option to score, but in most there are other factors to worry about. Each of those situations depends on the person with the ball, the defender, and the game situation.</p>

<p>In the middle of the spectrum, there will be plays that you question either way, and as you move out towards &lsquo;obviously foul hard&rsquo; or &lsquo;don&rsquo;t foul at all&rsquo; the choice becomes obvious.</p>

<p>To say one way is better than the other, you also have to set limits for the outer boundaries. Within those limits, always doing one or the other instead of taking variables into consideration likely won&rsquo;t be as efficient. To my knowledge, a study like that has never been conducted, but I don&rsquo;t see how it could be done accurately, either</p>

<p>The bigs would always try and dodge him, he would flop, they would complain to the refs but still get the foul.</p>

<p>They are getting the foul anyway, why not make sure CP3 felt it?</p>
