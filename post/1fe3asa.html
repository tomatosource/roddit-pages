      <label for="lmmtdck" class="commentText"><p>Man if you actually watched the Spurs and Lakers back in the day then at this point there should be some level of mutual respect for our rivalry and both players. These all time lists are stupid and filled with opinions from people that didn&rsquo;t watch in the early 2000s let alone the 80s, who cares. We had an amazing rivalry and a lot of back and forths over the years, it&rsquo;s time to just appreciate that opposed to feeding into these stupid ass narratives others like to run with.</p>

      <label for="lmluid8" class="commentText"><p>Well seems unfair to compare the Spurs 2nd to the Lakers 3rd and onward. Firstly, the 2nd best player on the Spurs during this playoff run was indeed worse than Derek fisher, no matter who you pick between Stack and Bowen. Both shot like 40% or something from the field and took massive steps back in the playoffs. After that, the 4th-7th best players on the Spurs were probably better than the 4th-7th best players on the lakers. But the Lakers had Shaq and Kobe and a mediocre supporting cast. Duncan had himself and a mediocre (at best equal to the lakers) supporting cast.</p>

      <label for="lmmcne9" class="commentText"><p>In 2003&hellip; Admiral/Ginobili/Parker were shells of their prime. Kawhi&rsquo;s era, an amazing player in 2015 and 2016 (Duncan&rsquo;s 2 final years), was past Duncan&rsquo;s prime anyways, so not like it was going to massively improve his legacy. Bowen was an established All-Defensive player and 3-point specialist in the corner&hellip; I&rsquo;ll give you that. But ALL&hellip; teams are littered and filled with guys like that. No team in the history of sports ever won a title with one guy and nobody else could play&hellip;</p>

<p>So we can&rsquo;t even give Duncan a 3+D guy without someone detracking and taking away from his legacy when giving him props for knocking off Shaq+Kobe? I&rsquo;m sure Robert Horry/Derek Fisher were nice pieces outside of Shaq+Kobe too.</p>

      <label for="lmmfic4" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s not so much detracking and taking away from his legacy, but I&rsquo;m more so bothered by the fact reddit loves to detract from the impact his teammates have. Example being reddit LOVES to say it&rsquo;s a crime he never won DPOY. But I genuinely don&rsquo;t believe he was ever the best defensive player in his time in the league, much less the best defensive player on his team. Timmy&rsquo;s always had INSANE defenders with him throughout his career. Be it the Admiral, Bowen, Kawhi it&rsquo;s been insane. Admiral was a &ldquo;shell&rdquo; of his prime post back but even at 50-70% output he was insane on both ends of the court, with him being one of four? players to ever have a quadruple double.</p>

To say that Robinson/Ginobili/Parker were shells of their prime is pretty disrespectful to how good they still were. Yeah they were less efficient and not as good as their peak, but they were still DAMN good.</p>

<p>Duncan played terrible in Game 2 and got saved by Bowen, Parker, and Ginobili. Very close to being 3-1 Lakers.</p>

<p>Duncan got a lot of help in that pivotal Game 5 to build the big lead in the 1st half.</p>

<p>But I have to admit, Duncan had a tremendous Game 6.</p>

<p>This playoff run by him is the only thing keeping him in the top 15 all-time. The rest of his playoff career is very good, but not great.</p>

<p>Across these seasons, <strong>the Lakers were 23-25 without Shaq but with Kobe, with a MOV of +1.33. They were 31-10 without Kobe but with Shaq, with a MOV of +3.66.</strong> Without either, they were 2-6 with a MOV of -6.13.</p>

<p>With a simple linear regression for all games during these seasons. The coefficient for Shaq is +4.504, good for 51st out of 437 players with at least 18 MPG in a season over that span, while for Kobe, it is +1.522, good for 135th. Applying a ridge penalty (as is done in +/- data like RAPM), Shaq&rsquo;s value is +1.101, good for 32nd among 437 players, and Kobe&rsquo;s is +0.466, good for 104th among the 437 players.</p>

<p>Using +/- data is better for this as it offers a more complete picture.</p>

<p>This general signal of Shaq having a higher impact is carried through in On/Off splits as well.</p>

<p>2000:</p>

<p>Shaq +10.9 (+10.4 on, -0.5 off)<br>
Kobe +4.9 (+9.9 on, +5.0 off)</p>

<p>2001:</p>

<p>Shaq +15.6 (+8.0 on, -7.6 off)<br>
Kobe +8.8 (+6.4 on, -2.4 off)</p>

<p>2002:</p>

<p>Shaq +9.9 (+11.3 on, +1.4 off)<br>
Kobe -2.0 (+7.0 on, +9.0 off)</p>

<p>2003:</p>

<p>Shaq +12.8 (+7.0 on, -5.8 off)<br>
Kobe +10.0 (+3.8 on, -6.2 off)</p>

<p>2004:</p>

<p>Shaq +11.5 (+8.3 on, -3.2 off)<br>
Kobe +5.9 (+6.2 on, +0.3 off)</p>

<p>Of course, this is just raw data and is susceptible to the same thing as the raw game-based data. But if we look at RAPM, it tells the same story: <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ahmed.cheema8618/viz/FiveYearRAPMPeaks1997-2021/FiveYearRAPMPeaks1997-2021" target="_blank">https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ahmed.cheema8618/viz/FiveYearRAPMPeaks1997-2021/FiveYearRAPMPeaks1997-2021</a></p>

<p><strong>Kobe&rsquo;s RAPM from 2000-2004 was +2.76. Shaq&rsquo;s was +5.10.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Simply put, all available data supports the notion that Shaq was more impactful to the Lakers&rsquo; success from 2000-2004 than Kobe was. That doesn&rsquo;t mean they both weren&rsquo;t incredible players (they were).</strong></p>

      <label for="lmluzjx" class="commentText"><p>Actually both things can be true. For example, in 2017, the Cavs wouldn&rsquo;t beat the warriors if Kyrie had a bad game regardless of how well Lebron played. Of course the lakers would lose if Shaq had a bad game and Kobe had a good one but I feel like the premise here was that Shaq was almost certainly going to have a good game, but Kobe was the wild card. I could be wrong, but that&rsquo;s how I took u/FailedAwards comment.</p>
