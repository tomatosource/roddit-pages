      <label for="lmki706" class="commentText"><p>Kobe played so well to get the Lakers tied at 2-2 and back in the series.</p>

<p>Duncan played terrible in Game 2 and got saved by Bowen, Parker, and Ginobili. Very close to being 3-1 Lakers.</p>

<p>Duncan got a lot of help in that pivotal Game 5 to build the big lead in the 1st half.</p>

<p>But I have to admit, Duncan had a tremendous Game 6.</p>

<p>This playoff run by him is the only thing keeping him in the top 15 all-time. The rest of his playoff career is very good, but not great.</p>

<p>Across these seasons, <strong>the Lakers were 23-25 without Shaq but with Kobe, with a MOV of +1.33. They were 31-10 without Kobe but with Shaq, with a MOV of +3.66.</strong> Without either, they were 2-6 with a MOV of -6.13.</p>

<p>With a simple linear regression for all games during these seasons. The coefficient for Shaq is +4.504, good for 51st out of 437 players with at least 18 MPG in a season over that span, while for Kobe, it is +1.522, good for 135th. Applying a ridge penalty (as is done in +/- data like RAPM), Shaq&rsquo;s value is +1.101, good for 32nd among 437 players, and Kobe&rsquo;s is +0.466, good for 104th among the 437 players.</p>

<p>Using +/- data is better for this as it offers a more complete picture.</p>

<p>This general signal of Shaq having a higher impact is carried through in On/Off splits as well.</p>

<p>2000:</p>

<p>Shaq +10.9 (+10.4 on, -0.5 off)<br>
Kobe +4.9 (+9.9 on, +5.0 off)</p>

<p>2001:</p>

<p>Shaq +15.6 (+8.0 on, -7.6 off)<br>
Kobe +8.8 (+6.4 on, -2.4 off)</p>

<p>2002:</p>

<p>Shaq +9.9 (+11.3 on, +1.4 off)<br>
Kobe -2.0 (+7.0 on, +9.0 off)</p>

<p>2003:</p>

<p>Shaq +12.8 (+7.0 on, -5.8 off)<br>
Kobe +10.0 (+3.8 on, -6.2 off)</p>

<p>2004:</p>

<p>Shaq +11.5 (+8.3 on, -3.2 off)<br>
Kobe +5.9 (+6.2 on, +0.3 off)</p>

<p>Of course, this is just raw data and is susceptible to the same thing as the raw game-based data. But if we look at RAPM, it tells the same story: <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ahmed.cheema8618/viz/FiveYearRAPMPeaks1997-2021/FiveYearRAPMPeaks1997-2021" target="_blank">https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ahmed.cheema8618/viz/FiveYearRAPMPeaks1997-2021/FiveYearRAPMPeaks1997-2021</a></p>

<p><strong>Kobe&rsquo;s RAPM from 2000-2004 was +2.76. Shaq&rsquo;s was +5.10.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Simply put, all available data supports the notion that Shaq was more impactful to the Lakers&rsquo; success from 2000-2004 than Kobe was. That doesn&rsquo;t mean they both weren&rsquo;t incredible players (they were).</strong></p>
