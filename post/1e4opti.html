<p>As have been chronicled, we have been going after a couple different people. Big additions.</p>

<p>There are 3 ways to get better in this league: One is through the draft, another is free agency, and the final one is trades. Trades are the hardest. It’s very, very hard to pull off trades because all these GMs want to prove how smart they are. They want to impress their owners.</p>

<p>But here’s the problem: If there’s something I’d like to share with the fans, it’s that they don’t understand how hard it is — and how illogical some of the parties on the other side are sometimes — to pull these things off.</p>

<p>Ainge gets a lot of credit for doing the easy things. Accepting a grandfather offer for over the hill vets? Making top 3 selections? He for sure laid the groundwork for rebuilds but he’s far from flawless.</p>

<p>Right now he’s trying to get a grandfather offer for Lauri. But what’s the end game for him? His team is stuck in no man’s land, not good enough to compete but now he’s stuck with vets on decent sized contracts that no one’s going to overpay for him to get. Ainge has done the easy work of trading Gobert and Mitchell in an effort to jump start a rebuild, but now that Lauri is unexpectedly good, they are pretty directionless. None of the wolves or Cavs picks he got project to be anything good, and neither are the Jazz own picks. Now he’s testing his reputation by being a stickler on Lauri who is on an expiring and he kind of needs to trade if he wants to be able to get any relevant building blocks.</p>

<p>Lacob is egotistical but Ainge is far from free of criticism himself.</p>

<p>The fact that utah has lauri is a credit to ainge again. Looking back, ainge really won that Donovan Mitchell trade. You can say “oh he just traded a star vet and that’s the easy part” but how does ainge continually win these trades so one sided? To get lauri and all the picks they got for Mitchell was a massive W. Lauri statistically was not far off from what Donovan Mitchell did this regular season.</p>

<p>I don’t see how anyone could argue with the results ainge has gotten. And so to insinuate ainge is not making a trade because he feels the need to impress his owner is just embarrassing and stupid.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like Ainge forces anybody to take a deal.</p>

<p>Besides - now that stars don&rsquo;t hit free agency anymore, trade values have only increased.  Just look at what the Knicks gave up for a non All-Star - 5 firsts and a 6th swap. (5 of which are unprotected). Did Sean Marks just fleece the Knicks?  I don&rsquo;t think so - it&rsquo;s just market value, even if those later Knicks picks turn into gold.</p>

<p>Markkanen is an actual All-Star and probably a better player than Bridges. (A year younger as well)  The rumored asking price of 3 1sts, a couple of swaps, and Podz seems totally reasonable - it&rsquo;s less than Bridges which accounts for the one year remaining on the contract.</p>

I seriously doubt that will be looked at as a going rate by any other teams. Murray didn&rsquo;t fetch that price after. Anyway, Bridges was a core piece on a team that was a couple wins away from a chip and is a bonafide 2 way player, Markkanen has put up all star numbers on a middling team and has performed badly defensively for a 7 footer and is on an expiring deal. they are not the same</p>

      <label for="ldg4m9y" class="commentText"><p>Exactly. Reminds me of the illogical Warriors front office thinking they can trade a player who is an expiring rookie contract player, who can&rsquo;t even earn over 18 mpg with 3 picks for a 25 ppg All Star</p>

<p>A report yesterday morning said the Warriors best offer is Moody, and 3 picks for people who didn&rsquo;t see the report. The Jazz don&rsquo;t need Moody, and Bridges got 5 picks, so I don&rsquo;t see it as a problem the Jazz don&rsquo;t want the Warriors trash. If the Warriors don&rsquo;t want to trade a lot they&rsquo;d considered an &ldquo;overpay&rdquo;, and if the Jazz don&rsquo;t want the trash offer the Warriors are offering, then Ainge, and Mike can&rsquo;t agree on a trade, which means Lauri doesn&rsquo;t play for the Warriors. Trades need both parties to agree, and it just feels like Lacob is salty that he can&rsquo;t get an All Star for trash</p>

That trade is going to wind up with the Nets getting the 22nd to the 27th pick in the draft four times and that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>The Warriors are trying to trade their post Steph picks. The Jazz could own the Warriors draft slot from 2026-2031. What are the odds at least two of those picks are top 5?</p>

      <label for="ldgd0q4" class="commentText"><p>Calling Lauri All-Star is like calling Dlo All-Star. One made All-Star as a replacement on a weak East, another made it because AD/KAT/Kawhi were hurt. Very unlikely Lauri will be an All-Star again, not in the West. Also, no playoff games. I understand why Utah want a lot for him, and I understand the Warriors’ hesitancy to overpay. I think Markkanen is worth a little bit more than Siakam at the deadline if he does not want to re-sign this August. If he signs a new deal his value will certainly change.</p>

      <label for="ldgdp58" class="commentText"><p>Problem for the Warriors though is that JK and Moody aren&rsquo;t really <em>that</em> great, and they&rsquo;ve had enough runway in the league to see where they&rsquo;ll be at their best. And trying to fill out around them is still going to end up being low playoff seed/probably play in at best. And if they trade them for Lauri, Lauri is also not that level of player that would catapult the Warriors up to a top 4 seed. Maybe if it was the east, but the West at the top is too good</p>

      <label for="ldgbtws" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s pretty obvious why. Trades like the Rudy Gobert one, and just recently Mikal Bridges, those kinds of trades just absolutely destroy the fluidity of trades because some of these owners probably see this stuff and ask why they aren&rsquo;t getting the same or similar and then demand it. Add in this new CBA.. trading is going to be very different going forward. Unless your owner wants to almost literally set ablaze hundreds of millions of dollars like the Suns are doing with their absurd tax bill, you just won&rsquo;t see a lot of action. This currently free agency period has been almost completely dead.</p>
