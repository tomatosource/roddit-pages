      <label for="li7cqgb" class="commentText"><p>Giannis’s primary utility has always been his defence (which is insanely good) And his major question mark has always been how to build an offence around his scoring. If his overall offensive package is as potent as his pts/assists numbers suggest the Bucks don’t lose a game and Giannis is in GOAT debate by now.</p>

<p>There’s an enormous difference between a Lebron 27/7/7 offensively and a Giannis 27/7/7 offensively</p>

      <label for="li7gt1b" class="commentText"><p>Fair! I still think there is something missing with Embiid. The way he dominates individual matchups is unlike anything I&rsquo;ve ever seen. I guess injuries play a major part, but it just seems like he reads the game a step slower than other elite players.</p>

<p>I still think by skillset Embiid is one of the best we&rsquo;ve ever seen, he just can&rsquo;t quite tie it all down together.</p>

      <label for="li7hdy0" class="commentText"><p>I have seen an old Al Horford slow down Embiid way too much with single coverage too much for my liking in the playoffs. Embiid has all the talent in the world but in the highest stage he typically underpeforms. Embiid in the regular season is one of the greatest scorers of all time. His isolation scoring numbers are amazing and a he has that absolute unstoppable shot from the mid range. His weakness has always been when you send doubles can he make quick decisions and pass out. He has improved it but he is no Jokic. Theoretically even ignoring the foul baiting, there is no reason why his game should not be close to as lethal in the playoffs.</p>

      <label for="li7hmzi" class="commentText"><p>I think we got a glimpse this year of what he can when he put 50 on the Knicks in one of the most absurd shooting performances I&rsquo;ve seen from a big man. I think one aspect is that he relies on his jumper so much in the playoffs, and mathematically jumpshooters tend to be higher variance players. Take Jokic for example, I think Hakeem put it best, he never settles. He will never take a mid range jumper if he&rsquo;s got a short player on him, he&rsquo;ll try to leverage that situation into generating a better look for himself or his teammates.</p>

      <label for="li7ii4r" class="commentText"><p>Embiid can play both from the inside and the outside. He is a matchup problem for most teams simply because of his size. Alot of Embiid&rsquo;s issues would be fix if had quicker decision making. Look at how Jokic makes the right play 99% of the time.  Also Embiid settles too much sometimes. I can excuse some of his playoff runs like 2022 where he broke his face, thumb and finger all in the same playoff run. Embiid is a walking injury risk. One of those guys like Kawhi, PG and even Giannis the past two playoffs that can&rsquo;t seem to stay healthy.</p>

      <label for="li858y4" class="commentText"><p>Agree. If he could but together his absolute peak athleticism of a few years ago, his latest passing capability and his early FT percentage, he would be top 10 for sure. But we can’t forget that the Bucks won the title -probably not a coincidence- when Middleton was at his peak offensively, and the set half court offense was based on his PnR with Giannis, often in the “closer” role with tough long midrangers.</p>

<p>2019 he averaged 17 ppg 57% TS, no one is winning with that as their second option. That’s not even mentioning Bledsoe horrific numbers and efficiency.</p>

<p>2021 his efficiency was worse but he was scoring 7 more ppg. Whole Middleton was great that run and hit clutch shots, him and holiday are also a reason they struggled against the nets and took 7 games to beat them when it should’ve been over in 5-6</p>

<p>Their True Shooting percentages in the playoffs are very similar but one has a title and 2 MVPs and the other doesn&rsquo;t. Easy choice.</p>

<p>Also, Embiid has two scoring titles and was top 5 in scoring 4 times in the last 5 years.</p>

<p>Since 2019 every team has guard Giannis the same in the postseason and it has worked very well as long as the team has the personal to cover him.</p>

Over a 4 year stretch from 2016-17 to 2019-20 he averaged 32.4 points on 61.8 TS% with 8.8 assists. Luka is just getting close to those numbers over the last 2 seasons, however in an nba where efficiency and scoring are way up. Kd never scored at his volume and wasn’t ever half the playmaker that harden was. Slightly more efficient scorer but really more of an insane complimentary piece. Not really a guy you want to run your offense.</p>

<p>Also, you&rsquo;re comparing Luka&rsquo;s 3rd to 6th seasons in the league to Harden&rsquo;s 8th to 11th year&rsquo;s in the league.</p>

<p>You can make the argument after next season, Luka&rsquo;s 4th to 7th year&rsquo;s in the league would have surpassed Harden&rsquo;s 4 year peak.</p>

<p>Not to mention what Luka will be in his true prime years (probably year 7 to 10).</p>

<p>Though more recently he has been nothing but a beast untill just last year when he seemed to be starting to fall of a bit.</p>

<p>Jokic has had some bad games, but as a whole few probably are as consistently good in the playoffs.</p>

<p>That said this is also in part because Steph played a lot more games than Jokic in the playoffs and even bad Steph games are games where he can contribute a lot with his gravity.</p>

      <label for="li7cfxy" class="commentText"><p>I think if I were to put Jokic over Curry (and I might) it’s more the injury record. Jokic never gets injured and Steph is prone to picking up lots of niggles when guys get physical.</p>

<p>Jokic is undoubtedly a better passer by a long long way but I don’t think that itself reflects in a difference overall offensive potency because of Stephs all ball impact warping the defence. Think of it like Jokic needing cutters (Gordon, MPJ) to make the most of his passing (when you have capable shooters running to the line and capable cutters running to the basket and you know Jokic can make every pass you’re in trouble) while Steph needs a passer (Draymond, Iggy) to make the most of his movement (when your team loses curry when he makes a run you sell out to stop the shot and that opens up cuts to the rim.)</p>

<p>Which is also why they’d be perfect teammates</p>

      <label for="li7bnok" class="commentText"><p>I don’t think it’s based on a specific player. I think it’s based on how he interprets basketball and what he considers valuable within that.</p>

<p>He’s said multiple times he values “scalable traits” (aka what can be stockpiled on top of other traits to build a championship winning team”. So stuff like shooting, defence, playmaking, off ball ability gets ranked highly bc you can stack these traits (great shooters play well tgt, great defenders play well tgt, great passers play well tgt, players who don’t need the ball play well tgt) with other stars</p>

<p>while traits like volume isolation scoring he considers a good floor raiser but are in general not scalable because you can’t stack them per se (3 effective iso scorers will make your offence sturdy, but won’t take you to new heights because they’ll just take turns rather than build off each other)</p>

<p>From this interpretation players like Jokic, Curry come out on top (offensively)</p>

<p>He’s been very open about Steph Curry not actually being the most complete player, but that outlier shooting, outlier off ball ability, and above average on ball playmaking happens to make him a one of a kind package that can be “stacked” with basically any star.</p>

<p>In the same vein, players like Anthony Davis, Kevin Garnett, Bill Walton aren’t actually similar to Steph Curry at all, but are ranked highly because their traits also fit the mold of being highly scalable players (off ball, defence, above average playmaking)</p>

<p>Funnily enough Lebron doesn’t really fit the mold we listed above (he’s a relatively inflexible player with a high level of usage that needs very specific (albeit easily sourced) teammates to exert that mega value. It’s just that the floor he generates is just so high Ben believes it equates to an all time great offensive ceiling. And then his versatility on defence brings him to heights maybe no one else has reached.</p>
