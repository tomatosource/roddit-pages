<p>All I&rsquo;m suggesting is that Lebron doesn&rsquo;t throw his body into harms way to stop a play at the level of what Lively was doing this last series.  It&rsquo;s likely how he&rsquo;s survived this long of a career.  Defend when you can, and when you shouldn&rsquo;t, he probably hasn&rsquo;t.</p>

      <label for="l6sy6tp" class="commentText"><p>From 2007-2018 LeBron was THE physical dominant force in the league. He would dunk through contact from three defenders, guard the other teams best wing, and play elite team defense included steals, loose balls, blocks, all of it.  For over a decade.</p>

<p>I dont even like LeBron that much, I think he can force teammates into bad roles and is a diva. But saying a rookie is a better and more physical defender because he .. hustled for rebounds? a &ldquo;standard play&rdquo; by your logic, in one playoff series?</p>

<p>edit to add: You seem to be punishing LeBron just because he&rsquo;s so good that he doesnt need to fall down. He absolutely has put his body on the line. Sorry he stood up while doing so I guess</p>

<p>rofl, don&rsquo;t think anyone mentioned offense.  But since you want to.   Has Lebron ever shot 100% FG in a game?  I don&rsquo;t know that answer, maybe you do.  But Lively has, and I think for an entire playoff series.</p>

<p>Speaking of Lebrons, I couldn&rsquo;t help noticing most of the Mavs/Timber series that Gafford looks like a tall Lebron&rsquo;s son.  Sort of played like one too at least from Center.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not punishing him, I&rsquo;m not trying to detract from his greatness.  All you strange defenders of your god Lebron need to chill.   I do suggest Lebron is way too high on the BBIQ charts so he knows when to keep his nose out of it.  Where sometimes it isn&rsquo;t worth it, and that&rsquo;s one reason he&rsquo;s lasted so well this long.</p>

<p>Some of you act like this god has stopped every team infront of him.  He&rsquo;s lost his ass in some years too, where a little more defense might have gotten him further.   But sometimes it hasn&rsquo;t been worth it eh.  That dive into bodies, kneeling down amongst the trees to pick up that loose ball, begging for a knee to the head.  These are things a wise Lebron doesn&rsquo;t do that often.  Because he knows one possession, one game, one years isn&rsquo;t his career.   For Lively, as a rookie, all he knows is he&rsquo;s throwing it all in right now and it was amazing to watch if not just a wee bit on the foolish side.  Every play of every game that series for Lively was played like it was his last and he didn&rsquo;t care.  And that 100% extremism on defense broke the Timberwolves in half.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the master at work enough in 20 years.  I don&rsquo;t really need to see more.  What&rsquo;s wrong with that?    Maybe Bobcat fans turned to Lebron when they couldn&rsquo;t get good basketball near home.  That&rsquo;s ok.  But I&rsquo;m not trying to shit on your fantasy god.   The pure facts about my opinions are I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve ever seen Lebron put life and limb on the line for an entire series like I believe Lively did.  He stopped an alarming amount of possessions and did it with reckless abandon every game of that series he played.</p>

<p>If you want to speak about negative.  Try the joke about Lively already missing more playoff games than Lebron has in 20 years.  I know it&rsquo;s a joke.  But if you asshole redditor types want to be strict with words and decross all Ts, then I ask you what did Lively do to become the butt of your jokes?   He and Gafford just carried the Kyrie Luka duo to the finals pretty much on their own.   Luka and Kyrie don&rsquo;t get there without those two playing as insanely as they did on both defense and offense.  Yet the ratio of talk about Luka/Kyrie to Lively/Gafford is pretty much 10,000 to 1.   So pardon me if I want to give that kid his due respect for his actions.</p>

      <label for="l6qu5bn" class="commentText"><p>Counter point: LeBron was packing it in and ending seasons early when he realized the Lakers weren’t contenders. For example, he could have played in 2018 and dragged the team into the playoffs where he might have had to play hurt and possibly miss a game, but he was like, “Nah” and chilled.</p>
