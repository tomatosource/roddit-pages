      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1edv8qz/fill_in_the_blank_tyus_jones_bradley_beal_devin/"><p>Fill In The Blank: Tyus Jones, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Kevin Durant, Jusuf Nurkic is a __ out of 10 starting five. How much of a difference do you think Tyus Jones makes for Phoenix?</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p>Well, the big news today is that Tyus Jones turned down more money elsewhere to sign with Phoenix on a minimum to play with their big 3 and to hopefully have a big season for a contender (more darkhorse really) and re-enter free agency next season. Still not many teams with cap space next year, but more teams will have MLE money to play with.</p>

<p>We all know who Tyus Jones is as a player at this point&mdash;elite distributor as a classic table setter PG, good off ball shooter, fantastic transition PG, poor defense. How much of a difference do you think he makes to this Suns team and what grade do you give this starting 5?</p>

In big games Tyus Jones is not gonna be touching the ball much so you basically have him as a good spot up shooter who’s bad on defense.</p>

      <label for="lfa4w5j" class="commentText"><p>One of the problems Suns had last season was getting into timely offensive sets by having KD or Booker fight full court press. By 4th quarter, they were gassed out.  Later in the season they made Beal the guy to bring the ball up, allowing KD to post up on the elbow. Jones can burn that energy fighting defenders off and get Suns quicker into the offensive set.</p>

<p>The second problem was non-existing bench talent. Now they have some options, esp if Bud convinces Beal to be the 6th guy who plays with Allen and Monte Morris.</p>

<p>Suns should be better, but there&rsquo;s still some unanswered questions about overall chemistry.</p>

Tyus/Book backcourt isn&rsquo;t great defensively but Book at least has the size for it to be a playable lineup. The whole point of the suns is offense, anyways. Then you have Beal as the 6th man elite scorer, which in theory should work really well.</p>

He averaged 7.3 assists per game and the wizards played at the highest pace last year. He had a stretch of insane high assist games but just watch the highlights of his career high 17 assist game.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a bunch of solid passes that resulted in assists rather than elite playmaking. Great solid pg that almost never turns it over but if he was elite then he would&rsquo;ve gotten paid even in this cba</p>

      <label for="lf9r6pa" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s a great sign at that money, but what they needed was a bigger wing who can defend and catch and shoot.</p>

<p>Beal and Booker are both still shooting guards, and unfortunately no signing is going to change that. If they got a couple of starting caliber small forwards, they could move Beal to the second unit and then opponents would have 48 minutes of having to defend a high scoring SG.</p>

      <label for="lf9utye" class="commentText"><p>KD and O’Neale are wings I trust. Bol took a step last year so we’ll see on him. They need one of Dunn or Bridges to contribute this year. Probably Bridges since he has size and can shoot the cover off the ball. I personally would start Jones, Book, ONeale, KD and Nurk to start the year and have Beal and Allen come off the bench. That’s a lot of firepower off the bench.</p>

      <label for="lf9vk13" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;d give it a 7 out of 10.</p>

<p>The defense is going to be very bad but the offensive machine gets a lot more efficient. Having a distributor that can also shoot the 3 ball well is a hot commodity. He shot a career high 41% from deep last year and also had his best passing season of his career at 7.3 assists a game, 2.1 higher than his previous best. He is still good for a steal per game as well.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s better than Grayson Allen. All he can do is shoot for the most part but has steadily gotten better at doing other things. He finished with career highs in points, rebounds, assists and 3 point percentage last year and a lot of that could be attributed to playing with a much more balanced but elite scoring group compared to Milwaukee.</p>

<p>I think he definitely helps keep them in that Pacific division winner conversation. I had them pegged just barely behind Sacramento prior to this pickup but now I believe they can win the division by at least 3 games over them. I like the offensive capabilities especially if Beal can manage to recreate himself as a more elite off ball threat.</p>

<p>Do they win in the first round? Probably. 2nd round? Unlikely.</p>

<p>Wolves, Mavs and Thunder are all pretty damn good.</p>

<p>Might put the Suns in that Nuggets tier at least for the time being.</p>

Except Suns didnt win, isnt proven, made to finals 3 years ago. Then tear the winning formula of 2020s for aged KD and overpaid Beal, now people acting like a rookie or Tyus Jones will solve their major problems.</p>

      <label for="lfbpba6" class="commentText"><p>except we know the exact problems our team had last year and we fixed nearly all of them.</p>

<ul>
<li>turnover issues. fixed with tyus jones and monte morris</li>
</ul>

<p>-Securing defensive rebounds. Fixed by having Plumlee instead of Eubanks and bud playing Bol Bol more than frank did.</p>

<p>-Having drew Eubanks. Fixed by not having Eubanks</p>

<p>-Having no depth. Fixed by being very deep with 3 solid to high level rotation players brought in on vet mins.</p>

<p>The one one that is still shaky is our long wing elite point of attack defender can&rsquo;t shoot. So it&rsquo;s unlikely he will be able to stay on the floor.</p>

<p>But Ryan Dunn has the whole year to develop his shot and he will get a lot of minutes in G-league games while never having to leave the big team because the G-league team plays 20 minutes from the practice facility and 20 from the suns arena.</p>

Denver are proven team that can win in regular season, problem is they lost so many guys that won them playoff games. Suns become 6th seed thanks to heroics of KD/Book. Swept showing no character or fight. Lets not act like adding Tyus or non proven rookies will drastically change this teams MAJOR problems.
There is a quality difference between those teams and its clear. Im getting used to r/nba hating me then my take happens one way or another.</p>

<p>This Suns team looks like the previous Mavs teams we were deluding ourselves that will be successful.</p>

      <label for="lfa0fca" class="commentText"><p>people keep saying our defense is ass. But we were 13th in defensive rating last year and the defense on our team got better this summer.</p>

<p>if we are talking starting lineup specifically</p>

<p>Last year Beal Booker Allen KD Nurk</p>

<p>This year Tyus Beal Booker KD Nurk</p>

<p>Beal and Allen are both 6&rsquo;4 and worked just as hard defensively last year. Beal had a defensive rating of 113.2 while Allen was 113.9. So trading those guys out is kind of a push.</p>

<p>Tyus while undersized has shown himself to be a solid defender in his stints with the Wolves and the Grizzlies. He has a positive DBPM every year of his career except last year on a bad wizards team and his rookie year.</p>

<p>We see the kind of defense booker plays in the Olympics. Tyus and Monte morris taking playmaking duties off his plate will allow him to be more engaged on the defensive end more.</p>

<p>KD is an elite and underrated defender. it is a travesty he didn&rsquo;t make an all defensive team last year. and that can probably be said about almost every year of his career.</p>

<p>Nurk a decent is a drop coverage big. we all know what defensive issues that brings.</p>

<p>Not to mention it&rsquo;s so clear people who didn&rsquo;t watch the suns consistently last year don&rsquo;t realize how unbelievably ass drew eubanks was. Losing him alone makes our bench defense (and just in general) a 1000x better.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no reason this team can&rsquo;t float around the 10th best defense in the league and probably have a ceiling of the 7th or 8th best defense in the league.</p>

      <label for="lfarps5" class="commentText"><p>yep. The booker beal allen kd nurk lineup was the 8th best 5 man lineup in the league last year that played at least 200 minutes together. with an offensive rating of 124.5 and a defensive rating of 113.4. A net rating of 11.1</p>

<p>the 7th best 5 man lineup in the league that played at least 200 minutes together was booker, Eric Gordon, Allen, KD, Nurk. It had a 115.1 offensive rating and a 102.8 defensive rating. A net rating of 12.3</p>

<p>Putting Tyus Jones to run the offense is only going to help them cut down on turnovers and get the bucket getters the ball their spots quicker. And allow book to not have to playmake as much so he can lock in more on defense.</p>

<p>If beal were to come off the bench and play sixth man role I’d be more hyped but knowing beal I really don’t think he’d be ok with it. Either way though they don’t have the defense to make a run. It’s a very unbalanced roster.</p>

<p>Despite wanting to have the starting role, I feel like during the middle of season he is going to be the 6th man with a lot of minutes. They would stagger guards minutes between Book/Beal otherwise their defense are gonna be shit.</p>

<p>They need O’Neal in it to be able to have a reasonable defense. It’s pretty obvious, they will make an other move for a more balanced roster.</p>

      <label for="lfadexi" class="commentText"><p>Tbh I think it&rsquo;s really tough to tell. A lot depends 0n coaching. There are a lot of holes too. I know we just ran a 3 guard lineup but idk if I feel good about doing that again. It has a lot of holes, though the specific number depends on how you define the scale. If a 1 is an NBA caliber starting lineup, just a tanking team, and a 10 is Boston, I&rsquo;d prob say 5 or 6. They have a lot to prove. It&rsquo;s an improvement over last year but the issues don&rsquo;t fully go away. Will be interesting to ses.</p>

<p>It’s a tough sell to ask of Beal to be a bench player considering his salary and being a few years separated from avging 30+</p>

      <label for="lfbjzzs" class="commentText"><p>I think that starting lineup in the regular season is a 7.<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>. If healthy, they are good enough to once again be a top 6 seed. I just don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a good playoff starting lineup. The issue is going to be the same as last season, they are not good enough defensively in a 7 game series against the top teams in the west. The lineups with Booker, Beal, KD, and Nurkic on the floor had defensive rating of 122.2 in their 4 games. That is pretty damn awful and they would be adding a bad defender to that starting lineup? Their best bet at a long run is that Bud can cook up one of the greatest playoff offenses of all time.</p>

<p>Booker and KD are fantastic players individually. Obviously. Bradley Beal and Jones are good but who plays the 3 in this configuration? Somebody is gonna have to play a size up and that&rsquo;s never a good thing. Nurkic isn&rsquo;t a starting quality center.</p>

<p>The offense will definitely have plenty of punch but this defense is suspect to say the least. Who guards the other teams best player?</p>

<p>No defense.</p>

<p>Plus Bradley Beal is one of the worst players that has so much hype around him. Dude is straight ass of defense. Can’t fit in a system where he should be a third option.</p>

<p>He is good when he has the ball in his possession.</p>

<p>Jones is great because he is one of the best PG in the league. If you could trade Beal and get an elite defender. You have a 8 or a 9.</p>

<p>KD is that great. Book is elite inside the arch.</p>

      <label for="lfarfff" class="commentText"><p>Tyus is a capable back up and I think he will provide more value playmaking and creating shots with the second unit guys than he will with the starters. They already have 3 guys who can get their own shots and run pick and roll with Nurkic, adding Tyus as a playmaker to that group seems unimportant. I think they are better off starting Grayson Allen with that group as he provides excellent spacing and better defensive size.</p>

<li>I can’t go any lower because Booker and KD are stars, and the rest aren’t bad. But it’s a terrible fit, and won’t lead to success. Especially when the 6th man is Grayson Allen, another G. The biggest difference Tyus changes is they have a true PG, and could theoretically have Beal run the bench lineup when they need a scorer to beat up the opposing bench. It’s a great move by Phoenix to get a player of his talent at that price, but it doesn’t fix the problem they’ve made for themselves.</li>

      <label for="lf9pwoz" class="commentText"><p>Not much difference. KD and Booker are not off ball scorers. KD expressed how annoyed he was standing in the corner in Vogel’s system.</p>

<p>Now Budenhoizer is gonna come in and tell KD they’ll let Tyrus Jones run pick and rolls? At best it’s a good 6th man replacement for when the stars are sitting. Otherwise, he’ll be a Cam Payne roll standing in the corner himself while KD does his thing.</p>

      <label for="lfaodtt" class="commentText"><p>Maybe warriors KD, definitely not suns KD</p>

<p>Dude has no energy to cut anymore. He knows it himself. That’s why he didn’t like the system. Pass first PG ain’t gonna work well with him. This sub will see next year. Just like this sub said Beal, Nurkic, Yuta, KBD were gonna be great bench players last year. They don’t actually watch KD anymore, just highlights.</p>
