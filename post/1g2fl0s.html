Guards, forwards, big man. All preseason no one&rsquo;s been able to really figure out how to stay in front of him. He has such a herky-jerky unusual cadence to his game.</p>

      <label for="lrntwrn" class="commentText"><p>Yeah it&rsquo;s honestly unbelievably unique and the bits and pieces we&rsquo;ve seen since he put on the silver and black is not a flash in the pan. He was doing this whole stop and start herky jerky hard to predict routine in high school too. He just has a very unique way of seeing the game and knowing how he wants to manipulate Defenders.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re different players in many ways, but there&rsquo;s some very real validity to the SGA comparison that popped up from some Spurs fans recently with how they move and use opposing defenses against themselves to get to the rim. And the guys like that are just really hard to get a hold of</p>

      <label for="lrnuw67" class="commentText"><p>Yeah there&rsquo;s some real truth to that comparison. Very deliberate, very methodical, very calculated, and yet extremely difficult to predict defensively. Once the Spurs give him the keys to run a lot of pick and roll and playmake he&rsquo;s going to pop so much. I think he&rsquo;s just going to get to the rim constantly and his ability to pass with either hand is going to generate so many good looks for this team</p>

      <label for="lrpabxu" class="commentText"><p>It&rsquo;s the pace management and deceleration.</p>

<p>Which is one of the most underrated and misunderstood skills in the game (at least by fans).</p>

<p>A big factor that makes SGA and Luka so great offensively is their ability to decelerate with the ball at will, making them able to trump defenses, and make their shots or passes at the very last second, or at the most unpredictable time.</p>

<p>Like, you think they have to shoot it now, but no, they still find one last second of suspension, one last step, they stop their tracks and suspend time itself, to find a moment where the defender has already jumped, or gave space/got baited.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s super hard to predict.</p>

<p>That skill is hard to learn, master, let alone as a young player when the game goes fast.</p>

<p>Castle has been praised by every coach, scout and player out there for that, because it takes high Basketball IQ/feel for the game, to do that at 19.</p>

<p>Usually the game goes too fast, and you&rsquo;re always rushing when you&rsquo;re young. It takes a few years for the game to slow down.</p>

<p>Castle just does not care and is never in a rush, always plays at his own pace already.</p>

<p>Which in the streets, would make him the epitome of a &ldquo;baller/hooper&rdquo;.<br>
It just looks smooth, because it is.</p>

<p>It gives this impression that you&rsquo;re cool, cruising, and always in control.<br>
And usually, it&rsquo;s not an impression.</p>

<p>The way you use your body is often a reflection of your state of mind.</p>

      <label for="lrrd3h7" class="commentText"><p>If you watch Castle&rsquo;s high school highlights, he relied a lot on pull up mid range jumpers and fadeaways. Hurley coached that out of him at UConn because their offense is built on generating high value shots, which those often are not.</p>

<p>He could start taking those again, but its more important to add a consistent outside shot to his game, and its very difficult to be good at both.</p>

It&rsquo;s kind of how they move and how they use their size to get to their spots.</p>

      <label for="lrnx772" class="commentText"><p>The issue with Caslte was never about him attacking the basket.  It was complimenting it with a consistent outside shot.  Better spacing in the NBA certainly helps him keep attacking the basket though which should give him time to develop a shot.  Given the Spurs&rsquo; record for doing that with guys like Kawhi and DJM, Castle is in a good spot.</p>

There are a lot of people on the NBA draft subreddit who considered him a subpar athlete and questioned his ability to get to the rim. It was not an unusual sentiment. It was an incorrect sentiment but not unusual. At the end of the day. You&rsquo;re right. The difference between him being a good complementary role player/ low end starter, and potentially being a star is going to come down to his jumpshot</p>

      <label for="lrntn40" class="commentText"><p>As someone who&rsquo;s spent a lot of time in the NBA draft subreddit the last five plus years, I&rsquo;ve just gradually learned that most NBA fans have a very one-dimensional understanding of athleticism. If someone can jump really really high, or is clearly like a top 1% foot speed player, they&rsquo;re athletic.</p>

<p>Lot of fans get lost in the nuance of what it means to be a plus athlete.</p>

<p>I was going crazy seeing those takes all draft cycle because Castle is clearly a good athlete. But even more than that, he knows how to really access a lot of his athleticism, whether it&rsquo;s through understanding how to use his size and strength, or most importantly how to use his extremely unusual herky jerky movement and ball handling to catch guys off guard with his acceleration</p>

<p>Which I would argue is borderline elite</p>

<p>He got to the rim literally whenever he wanted today and he&rsquo;s been like that all preseason without needing much help at all. I think the league is going to have a hard time figuring out how to stay in front of this kid, and if he ends up with any semblance of a consistent jumpshot.. watch out</p>

<p>But I mean like the most obvious example&hellip; Have you never seen a dude with raw speed who can&rsquo;t dribble? You know&hellip; Kind I can&rsquo;t access a lot of that raw athleticism if you can&rsquo;t go more than 2 ft without it going off your foot lol I feel like maybe you didn&rsquo;t understand what I meant when I said access? just saying because the idea that some players have games where they fully have learned how to tap into and squeeze out all of their physical gifts, while other players leave a lot of meat on the bone is kind of common sense.</p>

<p>I doubted his ability to be a lead guard (and still do) because I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s ENOUGH of an athlete to be able to blow past guys when they give him the space he will get if his shot doesn&rsquo;t fall. The level of athlete you have to be to get away with being a piss-poor shooter at PG is extremely rare, and he doesn&rsquo;t have that kind of athletic gift.</p>

<p>If he can actually just make shots at a reasonable clip, then absolutely, he&rsquo;s athletic enough.</p>

      <label for="lrpyutv" class="commentText"><p>Yeah I think most of the questions about him were reasonable and still completely unanswered despite a few pre-season games.</p>

<p>Like you said, he needs to be extremely talented on-ball if he doesn&rsquo;t have a reliable jumper (which should be the assumption for now). If he shows he&rsquo;s a better shooter than he was in college, great, but we need to see that play out over the course of the season.</p>

<p>But any concerns about a projected secondary ball handler with a poor jumper are completely legitimate imo, that&rsquo;s an awkward fit on almost every team.</p>

<p>IF Castle is a PG and IF he can shoot, he&rsquo;s the OBVIOUS #1 pick.</p>

<p>This clip doesn&rsquo;t really show much athleticism. He literally crossed his man because the guy wasn&rsquo;t in a stance. He did a two footed leap from the charge circle for the dunk and barely cleared the rim.</p>

<p>I actually think he has better athleticism than is shown in the clip and I&rsquo;m STILL low on him lmao</p>

You even see on this play that he almost came to a jump stop to explode off two feet and still didn&rsquo;t have a ton of extra height on that dunk.   Compare that to Keldon&rsquo;s dunk off one foot, or Jeremy&rsquo;s and it&rsquo;s clear he&rsquo;s not quite at that level.</p>

      <label for="lrr2ili" class="commentText"><p>I&rsquo;m like 98% off the Scoot wagon at this point, and I didn&rsquo;t even really care about the being high at media day. He just has no NBA level skill. His only good trait of any kind is he can run fast in the open court, which is a nice but limited utility skill. That open court speed is also heavily nerfed by being the worst finisher in the league and a turnover machine.</p>

<p>Glad I&rsquo;m not the only one seeing this lol. What&rsquo;s with all the Spurs fans saying they like Scoot like they genuinely mean that shit? Of course you like getting the best prospect since Lebron while an in-conference opponent gets an overhyped turd lmao 😂</p>

I want to see him and Devin on the court standing side by side because I feel like he has to be a good chunk bigger both in height and mass. He&rsquo;s just a absolute physical beast for a combo guard, particularly for a 19-year-old who theoretically could still fill out even more.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know. You know my thoughts on him. I&rsquo;m irrationally High, I know you&rsquo;re still in a weight and see state in regards to his game but I just think he&rsquo;s going to be fantastic for us</p>

      <label for="lrnw5bo" class="commentText"><p>Castle has been great so far. What I find most interesting is not that he&rsquo;s been great - but for 19 yo I expect someone with high highs but with lots of mistakes. Castle has been extremely stable in all 3 games with no obvious blunder - yet. I am hyped.</p>

<p>If this kid continues to grow same way, then Wemby+Castle+Vassel+Sochan is an awesome 4.</p>

<p>Spurs this time are going to be more fun than Wemby&rsquo;s rookie year.</p>

<p>Even through all the negatives talked about leading into the draft, his poise was something often brought up. So that is fucking awesome because this stuff is not easy to learn. He&rsquo;s built with it. The other stuff is easier to learn and practice.</p>

<p>It was an extremely well coached and coachable team. Castle started the season with those types of mistakes, but he became real tight real fast by the end of the season.</p>

<p>The players just didn&rsquo;t really make mistakes, played a complicated offense, and blew pretty much everyone out of the water.</p>

And he&rsquo;s been doing that all preseason. His combination of size, strength, and body control seems to be giving Defenders a bit of a confusing time on how to stay in front of him, which for people who were super high on him entering the draft, was always the big selling point on his game translating to the next level</p>
