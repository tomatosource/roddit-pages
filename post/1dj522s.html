One of the most available stars of his generation. And he&rsquo;s about to get the next biggest contract in NBA history.</p>

<p>Like when is the bro not injured? It has been 10 years since he was drafted and he has been healthy in the playoffs exactly one time and that&rsquo;s when the NBA had a 4 month break before the bubble.</p>

<p>Dude is unequivocally a better basketball player than Jayson Tatum and yet I still wouldn&rsquo;t take him over JT because he&rsquo;s always hurt when it matters.</p>

      <label for="l99szmp" class="commentText"><p>He was taught how to fall for the instances in which he does fall and cannot stop that from happening - minimizing the impact to his joints for when he does hit the ground.</p>

<p>That is not the same, however, as falling down frequently and expecting minimal impact because you’ve “learned to fall”. He’s still somewhere between 265-300 lbs and is over 7 feet tall. A man of that size is not meant to fall frequently on any padded surface, much less on hardwood.</p>

<p>I’ve really grown tired of this “he’s taught to fall!” Nonsense being parroted as if it somehow reduces the literal effects of physics on a body when it goes from a quick drop to a sudden stop. This isn’t a complaint about you specifically, as it’s repeated here so often that it’s taken as gospel without even being thought about for more than 2 seconds, but when people compare him hitting the ground multiple times a game after relatively minor contact to Steph, who is a foot shorter and roughly 100 lbs lighter, falling to his ass after people get into his landing space, it makes me want to lose my mind. Embiid’s injuries are not exclusively his fault but his playing style and desire to shoot free throws and draw fouls at any unprecedented rate are doing him zero favors.</p>

      <label for="l99nzh6" class="commentText"><p>everyone has their two cents, so i’ll just say mine</p>

<p>embiid is one of the most massive human beings i have ever seen on the court. his natural weight has to be over 300, and the only reason why he isn’t was because he committed to his job and future like a pro and listened to the staff around him</p>

<p>anybody who is a barefoot 7’ weighing 300lb should always be a concern. it’s not even just a basketball thing, it’s a human physiological thing. knees, ankles, back, shoulders are all under a different type of stress at that load</p>

<p>the fact that he has played the way he has the last 3 years after starting off more injury prone than ad’s start is a testament to hard work (we don’t see on the court), and to me that justifies him taking mvp over jokic when jokic should have gotten it purely because of how he has dominated the league, but that’s a separate debate</p>

<p>I agree that Embiid deserved MVP. in the sense that, while I would&rsquo;ve voted for Jokic, Embiid was a worthy winner and the &lsquo;Jokic robbed&rsquo; crowd is toxic and unreasonable</p>

<p>but, the same things apply to Jokic. yes, Embiid has worked incredibly hard, but so has Jokic.</p>

      <label for="l99tncg" class="commentText"><p>Jokic has played a full season’s worth of games more than Embiid over the past three years when you factor in regular season and playoffs and you think Embiid should get MVP because he… overcame injuries?</p>

<p>Wild that Embiid gets credit somehow for being dominant when he’s injured and Jokic, who is the same size as him and yet is an iron man, somehow loses credit in your mind for <em>not</em> being injured and achieving significantly more success in a shorter timeframe.</p>

<p>Goddamn, I think Embiid deserves a ton of credit for the shit he has pushed through and how good he’s become despite his setbacks but some of these takes are just so blatantly absurd. MVP isn’t for “hardest road traveled”. It’s for the most valuable player. You don’t get bonus points for missing more games or being less reliable come game time.</p>

      <label for="l99rkav" class="commentText"><p>Joel Embiid from 22-24, when totally healthy is one of the greatest centers of all time. He’s dominant in his era on both sides of the ball.
He’s one of the 5 best mid range shooters in basketball, unstoppable under the basket,  draws a ton of fouls, hits 90% of his FT, has improved his passing every year in the league. Spread the floor now and hits threes. He’s one of the best rim protectors and a smart positional defender. Top level rebounder. All Time Great.</p>

<p>He does flop constantly and whine a lot, and he is huge so he gets dialed up on switches on the perimeter a lot by wings like Tatum who abuse him in space in the playoffs and send him home all the time, but it’s a team game.</p>

<p>Tatum is generally more valuable than people think but Embiid is still absolutely more valuable than Tatum.</p>

<p>off the top of my head, comfortably above him: Mikan, Russell, Wilt, Kareem, Walton, Hakeem, Shaq, Jokic, DRob. so if by &lsquo;one of the greatest centers ever&rsquo; you mean &lsquo;in the 10-20 range&rsquo;, I can agree with that</p>

      <label for="l99ucdq" class="commentText"><p>Worth noting that Tatum is not the age yet that Embiid was when the 22-24 stretch occurred for him (three years straight of MVP-quality play when healthy). I know it’s a common take that Tatum is a finished product, but it’s entirely possible and even likely that aspects of his game take another leap (even if not a huge one) over the next 2-4 years. A good portion of NBA players peak between 27-31.</p>

<p>Tatum now is where Embiid was in 2019-2020, and Tatum at <sup>25</sup>&frasl;<sub>26</sub> is better than Embiid was at 25 (and if his current history holds up, he’ll continue to be an iron man and play more than basically any of his peers). We’ll see what the next two years look like for him, since he’s already staked his claim as a future HOFer.</p>

He could be 50-40-85 with a better shot diet and average 30 with a .640-.650 TS% on this same team.</p>

<p>He plays like an MVP for stretches already.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s still just 26, even if he&rsquo;s not top 5 individual players right now, he still has a lot of time to improve. And with a monster squad like this and a partner as good as JB, the scary thing is they can keep getting better.</p>

<p>And he&rsquo;s not abusing his power to bring in trash ass brothers or cousins to get roster spots lol (true underrated quality for stars)</p>

The 20 years later when you go back and think about what you care about it when you&rsquo;re on a team, he&rsquo;s the guy you want.</p>

<p>Honestly I would even take to Duncan over someone like KG I don&rsquo;t guess that&rsquo;s not even remotely controversial given the fact that he has four titles. KG was amazing but don&rsquo;t get was the best power forward of the generation and maybe ever</p>

<p>in terms of results, there&rsquo;s no real argument over the PF position. if you want to say &lsquo;in a vacuum, ignoring actual results, who drove winning the most&rsquo;, almost everyone will still say Duncan, but there is a case that KG is on his level.</p>

<p>like /u/guywithoutahat said, Duncan vs KG was a roaring debate in their primes. &lsquo;Duncan is better&rsquo; became the consensus when he started amassing rings, but there&rsquo;s a reason the debate was fierce - Garnett at his peak was an absolute menace</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s always been a debate and won&rsquo;t be answered ever. But we can say in hindsight what we remember more is the guy winning titles.</p>

      <label for="l99n1jz" class="commentText"><p>Some people still put Kawhi over Tatum, and plenty of people put him over Tatum before he predictably got injured again. The better example is probably Embiid, who by all means has had higher peaks than Tatum, but idk how many times Tatum has to beat the guy and out perform him in the playoffs before people actually credits Tatum for being the better guy because Embiid can simply never survive a full season and a deep playoff run.</p>

<p>And I think it goes even deeper than just injury prone guys. The value of having a guy that plays high minutes and is available for the regular season and deep into the playoffs is also overlooked. Ant had an incredible first 2 rounds, by round 3 he already got absolutely gassed and was ass. People jump the gun too early on guys who perform well in early rounds but still lose so we don&rsquo;t get to see them against tougher competition, playing more games, and even higher minutes. Durability is even more overlooked than availability.</p>

      <label for="l99w3vb" class="commentText"><p>Kawhi Leonard in a 2K game where you can turn stamina and injuries off is better than Tatum. He is not a better player than Tatum in reality because he can&rsquo;t stay on the court.</p>

<p>Durability and stamina are skills, injuries suck but it&rsquo;s reality, you don&rsquo;t just get to ignore it when talking about who&rsquo;s better. Kawhi will have healthy stretches throughout a season where he reaches a level that&rsquo;s better than Tatum. But play out the entire season and everyone knows what will happen. Tatum will play majority of games at a high level, win his team a bunch of games and get a top seed, get 1st team All-NBA, then play every single playoff game at a high level and make a deep playoff run. Kawhi will miss a decent chunk of games, his team will be middle of the playoff pack in a good year and fighting for a spot on a bad year, then his availability is uncertain when it actually comes playoff time.</p>

<p>When those are the results, it&rsquo;s evident which guy is better. The guy that gives you far more production for the whole season.</p>

Same reason that guys like MJ had, that even on a random road game against a bad opponent, there might be some kids in the stadium with a Tatum jersey on, and they probably paid hard earned money for the tickets (that keep going higher&hellip;) &hellip;. and he never wants to disappoint them by load managing and sitting games.</p>

<p>If he&rsquo;s hurt, he&rsquo;s hurt.</p>

      <label for="l98zi8u" class="commentText"><p>I get injuries and stuff. But that what separates legends from the rest right? I think the issue here, is we think load management will eventually have every1 healthy by the playoffs (which we have seen it has not). I don&rsquo;t think NBA can fix this. It&rsquo;s AAU culture problem where they run down the kids bodies before they even get to the league.  You can&rsquo;t fix a 20 year old with like 10 years of intense basketball milage. The body can&rsquo;t keep up.</p>

<p>It wasnt just the legends. Every starter was playing more games. Its just that the players leveraged their power and fans chanting &ldquo;player empowerment&rdquo; into working less for more pay. Wont blame them cause i would do exactly the same if i could but i can complain about the lesser product. Back then if the bulls were on TV you bet your ass Jordan was on TV. Now you first have to look if the star was arsed to do his job today or not.</p>

I think its bad for the fans, organizations and ultimately the player&rsquo;s legacy in itself (beside&rsquo;s the health, brand) and what not. I feel like its more cons than pros. I get the overall message but Sports is Sports right? There&rsquo;s always gonna be physical contact, and injuries.  It&rsquo;s kinda fixing a problem that can&rsquo;t be fixed naturally or you have to attack the issue in the younger days than present players.</p>

<p>This is actually underselling MJ because he played 82 games in <strong>9</strong> out of 15 seasons (and this is including the year when he un-retired with only 17 games remaining) which is 60%, not 50%.</p>

<p>And of the 6 seasons he didn&rsquo;t play 82 games.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Three of those seasons he played 81, 80, and 78 games.</p></li>

<li><p>Second un-retirement season with the Wizards where he played 60 games at age 38.</p></li>

<li><p>The aforementioned season where he un-retired with only 17 games remaining.</p></li>

<li><p>2nd year in the league when he broke his foot and could only play in 18 games.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Absolute iron man who basically NEVER missed a game.  Truly unbelievable by today&rsquo;s standards.</p>

<p>Yeah I mean, I’d rather have what Tatum has on and off the court in terms of his media savvy during interviews and in the general public eye.</p>

<p>Ant has had some messy ass moments because he gets a bit too loose with his words. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/s/YQfXk4ACNT" target="_blank">Everyone forgets that story he posted last year from his car</a>, aimed at some guys with their shirts off, while calling them a very gross homophobic slur + laughing. Literally for no reason. Took him a bit to finally remove it and we all just moved on. To this day, we meme Ant’s texts with a gf clowning about her “getting an abortion lol” and that is wildly out of pocket to put in writing (funny as hell, but maybe tighten it up a bit with the phone or at least discuss sensitive stuff on a secure phone call)</p>

<p>I’m sure he won’t make that mistake again, but those things could have spun way out of control and been a distraction for his team. Glad he still entertains us by saying anything that comes to mind (so he should be extra careful for sure going forward) because he’s very very likable and I love his attitude overall.</p>

<p>So Tatum can do whatever corny shit he wants. As long as it doesn’t harm anyone or limit his performances/availability and he continues to spearhead the highest results to boot 🤷🏾‍♂️ the only distraction his name presents is the one the media and fans stir up to manufacture a wedge between him and Jaylen and his ranking among the top players…and this whole comment section about him being corny after remaining almost entirely silent through all of the background noise doubting him</p>

<p>Did you see the latest video at a party? This time he quoted Kanye&rsquo;s grammy acceptance line &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll never know&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tatum really spent the buildup to game 5 preparing quotes for post-championship interviews</p>

<p>It’s a really basic sentence and it’s not like it’s a particularly unique idea that Kanye somehow thought up. It’s not even in one of that dude’s songs or whatever, so why are you assuming he was copying him?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Because it&rsquo;s an iconic post-win quote at the Grammy&rsquo;s and one that&rsquo;s referenced a lot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so why are you assuming he was copying him?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and because it&rsquo;s obvious af and I&rsquo;m not an idiot</p>

      <label for="l99fpai" class="commentText"><p>I don’t even think that’s what it is, he just hasn’t been badly injured in his career so he hasn’t been in a situation where load management is something to be considered. I’m sure if he ever does end up in that spot, he’ll rest and load manage like everyone else.</p>

<p>I’ll never blame a player with injury history for load management. Risking permanent and/or career ending damage for immediate gain is dumb, especially just for the sake of machismo and “being tough”. You see all these old school players now with absolutely destroyed bodies hobbling around like old men when they’re only in their 40s-50s cause they all had the mentality that you should just play. You see a lot of players even just from the last generation who had short careers because they kept trying to play when they should have rested more.</p>

<p>I applaud the new generation for saying “No my long term health is worth more than that.” I applaud the organizations who realize this even more. Imagine Wemby is drafted in 2003, no doubt in my mind his career would be cut short because the Spurs would not be trying so hard to manage his health like they are today.</p>

He&rsquo;s chill, he&rsquo;s a good dude, and he <em>really</em> cares about the fans. He&rsquo;s said he owes it to the fans to get out here and play. That the fans paid money to see him, and taking days off to rest and shit is unfair. That&rsquo;s a very rare attitude to have in the modern NBA. He respects yall way more than your favorite player does and you hate him for it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also an interesting foil to the weird narrative people have crafted about their road to a championship being one of the easiest ever. They definitely had some favorable draws, but you still have to play the games.</p>

      <label for="l99t43l" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, it isn&rsquo;t exactly a surprise that the team with the most durable superstar was able to manage their injuries better than teams with more oft-injured players.</p>

<p>We also took steps to decrease our number of injury-prone players (Brogdon, Timelord, and Smart to &lsquo;just&rsquo; KP). Largely, those injury prone players have ended up significantly injured by the end of the playoffs as expected (Brogdon and Timelord last year, KP this year). That made a difference!</p>

Taller than that you have issue and shorter than that has a injuries.  Lebron is much stockier than Tatum, but similar height</p>

<p>Even old man LeBron had a higher PER (23.7) than Jayson Tatum (22.3) this season.</p>

<p>Is Tatum overrated and about to be hugely overpaid?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m already wondering if Tatum and JB will be satisfied with this ring and their fat contracts and perhaps not win again for a long time.  They both have career PERs of players that don&rsquo;t sustain success (20.1 and 16.8).</p>
