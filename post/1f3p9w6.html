      <label for="lkgcw10" class="commentText"><p>He made the NBA top 75, but the interesting thought experiment for me is whether he&rsquo;s closer to the top of that group than the bottom. Conventional wisdom might put him below a lot of guys who were &ldquo;more skilled&rdquo; like Melo, AI, Harden, Westbrook. I&rsquo;m not really sure a great scorer adds more value than someone who is generational at rebounding and defense though. Those extra possessions and stops add a lot of value to your expected final score.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no Rodman parallel in the NBA right now, but I remember how annoying it was for GS to play Tristan Thompson in the 2016 Finals when he was cleaning up the glass and creating a lot of extra possessions. He doesn&rsquo;t get much credit for it, but he was an important part of the Cavs winning the championship. Rodman was much better than Thompson, and much more successful. 5 rings.</p>

<p>Would it be insane to put him in the all-time best PF discussion? It&rsquo;s a hard argument when guys like KG and Duncan were also great at defense and so much more skilled at scoring, but I think if you&rsquo;re building out a dream 5, you at least consider sticking him in there to be the perfect ceiling raiser and defensive anchor next to all your shooters.</p>

      <label for="lkggn0t" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s on another planet as a rebounder. It&rsquo;s a bit like Steph with shooting. There have been lots of good shooters in the NBA, but Steph is an outlier among outliers. Rodman is like that when it comes to rebounding.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s one of the best defenders in that group, if not THE best. KG has a DPOY and a bunch of all-defense selections. Timmy has no DPOY, but a crazy number of all-defense selections. I&rsquo;m open to any opinion about which is the best defender from this trio, but Rodman is at least in the discussion.</p>

<p>That would be the argument. He&rsquo;s an elite defender who rebounds at an outlier level for his era.</p>

<p>I think I ultimately take KG for the 4 spot because he can do a lot of that stuff and also drop an easy 20 on your head, but Rodman is a considerably better rebounder. If your team already has Steph, Jordan, LeBron, and Shaq; you may not necessarily get a lot value from KG&rsquo;s offensive looks. They may actually be negative value compared to shots from your other options. In other words, even though KG was a good scorer, you still wouldn&rsquo;t want him taking shots when you have Steph, MJ, etc.</p>

<p>In that situation, Rodman being allergic to shooting almost works in your favor, as he can just focus on grabbing boards and recycling possessions while also playing all-timer defense on the other end. If you are picking players for an actual 5v5 game and not just based on their individual qualities, he&rsquo;s an interesting candidate.</p>

      <label for="lkghfwj" class="commentText"><p>Imo, KG and TD, but especially KG is several tiers above Rodman (who was an amazing defender) as a defender</p>

<p>Shotblocking in the 90s and 2000s is simply a preposterously overpowered quality to have. It’s why guys like Hakeem ruled the 90s and Shaq who would be near unplayable in a PNR was still a positive defender in the 2000s. And guys like KG have genuine 1-5 switchability, can chase around screens, and an ability to stay out of foul trouble?</p>

<p>Rodman was a great defender for his era but his primary utility still came from offensive rebounding (which as you say an outlier among outliers). TD is in that all time territory. And KG is a goat level defender. Fucking 7 foot Draymond it doesn’t even sound real.</p>

      <label for="lkgiper" class="commentText"><p>Rodman is a great complimentary piece on title teams, shirk that’s valuable let’s not make any mistakes here, that’s what they are, complementary. I know this because in the finals he’s only playing 28 minutes a game for his career because he’s such a 0 on offense, which eats into his defense because he’s not playing big minutes</p>

<p>There are many more Dennis Rodmans than Carmelo Anthony’s or most certainly James hardens. He’s probably bottom 5 on the top 75</p>

      <label for="lkgis22" class="commentText"><p>I feel you on all that, but your last argument muddies it up for me and borders on overrating in hindsight. The guy averaged like 4 pts. If he averages 10-12, then add in the rest of your argument; then we can start that conversation. But when I say he didn&rsquo;t score, he had ZERO scoring responsibility. Like, dude didn&rsquo;t even look at the basket. I watched him airball a FT once and just shrug his shoulders like it wasn&rsquo;t his problem. I love Rodman, but same as you wanted to account for his defense over a scorer like the ones you listed, I think oftentimes, scoring gets overlooked. Not somuch the fact that good scorers can score, cause they&rsquo;re indeed talented. But often times, because they&rsquo;re so talented we try to assign that as easiest, low effort thing for them to do, when these guys are targeted, scouted and expected to bring it every single night and pretty much do. So I can&rsquo;t put him on an alltime great list for PFs. You&rsquo;re talking about guys who can score 25 om great efficiency but miss the last shot and be cursed out here.</p>

      <label for="lkfiqry" class="commentText"><p>That’s interesting. I heard about home cooking for MJ but remember though that Rodman played on 3 different teams and was always a supreme rebounder, and then barely played in another 2 with the Lakers and Mavs but still rebounded his ass off there.</p>

<p>I’m not sure you can accuse home cooking across several different teams, and just watching him you can see how remarkable a rebounder he was.</p>

<p>As far as him focusing on rebounds over other things, Rodman was a generally poor and inefficient scorer but an outstanding defender and capable passer, especially his outlet passing. And Phil Jackson sings his praises about how well Rodman understood the triangle. I don’t think you could call him a one-trick pony if that’s what you were implying.</p>

      <label for="lkgd4fh" class="commentText"><p>Bill Russell played on stacked teams in an era when the NBA had 8-12 franchises. Making the Finals was easier than making WCF or ECF now. I don&rsquo;t know how good he was, but I know the context was totally different and the stats are going to be skewed by that.</p>

      <label for="lkfgzfk" class="commentText"><p>Wilt has more rebounding titles, however, in my opinion, it&rsquo;s Rodman, mostly because the pace of the game was much faster back in Wilt&rsquo;s day. If you look at Rodman&rsquo;s stats per 100 possessions, his averages are right up there with Wilt, and given that some of Wilt&rsquo;s teams played at pace of 120-130 possessions per game, I think that bears some significance. My guess is that, if you equalized the pace, Rodman would have a slim lead over Wilt in terms of rebounds per game and per possession.</p>

He also pursued rebounding as ferociously as other really talented, physically gifted players pursue scoring and he&rsquo;s really the only player ever to do that, so it makes sense.</p>

<p>Like yeah, maybe inch for inch he’s the best, but size is a pretty damn important part of it, and you can’t just wave that away. The ball doesn’t care if you’re 8 feet tall or 3 feet tall, it goes to who is better.</p>

<p>Wilt and Rodman are going for a rebound. Who gets it? That’s the best rebounder, fuck anything else</p>

      <label for="lkfqyci" class="commentText"><p>If a player like Moses or Hakeem just focused solely on rebounding, which Rodman did, they would probably put up similar if not better rebounding numbers. You can say he&rsquo;s the best, but that&rsquo;s because he only focused on rebounding and defense.</p>

Pace, bricks, etc don’t matter in that argument since it’s just whoever was better against their peers for that year.  Mad props to Rodman for doing it at 6’7, but if I needed someone to dominate on the rebounding only, wilt is my man.</p>

      <label for="lkgel4n" class="commentText"><p>Rodman is one of the most interesting “would he be great in this era?” Former players to consider.</p>

<p>You could argue he would be even more impactful on defense. He would have even more freedom to roam on D. He would be like Draymond on steroids.</p>

<p>But playing him would mean you are playing 4 on 5 on offense. Teams would have zero respect for him as a shooter. Other than boxing out no one would ever put a man on him. So as great as would be on D, I’m not sure you could play him in today’s era.</p>

      <label for="lkgfg52" class="commentText"><p>You could make a case that he&rsquo;d be a great pick in an all-time draft if you&rsquo;re looking at &ldquo;most likely team to win&rdquo; and not just &ldquo;5 best individuals&rdquo; - you don&rsquo;t need 5 elite scorers, you need a balance of slashing, shooting, creation, off-ball movement, wing defense, help defensive, rebounding, etc.</p>

<p>And there are so many great scorers and passers to pick at the top, you don&rsquo;t lose much if you have to pick a slightly worse guy. But if you get Rodman, then you get A+ rebounding and defensive versatility with a bigger gap to the next guy who has those traits.  The only problem would be the potential team chemistry and attitude issues, since you wouldn&rsquo;t be sure if the guy wasn&rsquo;t going to lose his cool and get suspended, or mess with the locker room with some sort of bizzarro antics.</p>

Had his main job been only to rebound he probably could&rsquo;ve averaged 20+ a game that series. Wilt also averaged 20 for quite a while while being the best scorer in the league so he probably could&rsquo;ve averaged 30+ had he not been scoring 30 ppg at least</p>

      <label for="lkfh2nv" class="commentText"><p>Sure but that was his role which is what I&rsquo;m saying a lot of the best rebounders averaged like 3 or more less rebounds than him but a lot of the best rebounders who weren&rsquo;t Rodman also were the best player on their team and the focal point of the offense, that&rsquo;s a heavy workload. I just used Duncan as an example that he could actually rebound very well but since he was the focus of every opposing teams defense he wasn&rsquo;t allowed to grab more than his usual 11 or 12</p>

Everything you said is just hypothetical.</p>

<p>If MJ focus on passing and don’t score he can average 15 APG, but nobody calls him the GOAT passer. Lol.</p>

      <label for="lkgbmf3" class="commentText"><p>That&rsquo;s entirely different from my argument, mj was never more than an above average passer yet when he was put in a role where he was the pg he averaged like 9 a game, my argument is that guys a tier below Rodman rn could&rsquo;ve been on his level if that was their role. Look at someone like Drummond he was breaking all kinds of records and lead the league in rebounding yet was never really as good of a rebounder as his contemporaries he just focused on getting rebounds more than anyone at the time and therefore put up monster rebounding statlines</p>

I think ur just assuming I&rsquo;m a homer cus of my flair. What&rsquo;s more impressive on a purely numbers basis averaging 15+ rebounds with like 5 ppg or averaging 20+ while also scoring 30+</p>

      <label for="lkgi5sn" class="commentText"><p>Similar situation but I&rsquo;m not tryna downplay any players skill which apparently a few people think I&rsquo;m doing. Rodman is definitely a top 5 or top 3 rebounder ever it&rsquo;s just hard to say he&rsquo;s the best without a doubt, kinda like Jokic he&rsquo;s one of the best passers ever but unless u actually watch him his passing stats won&rsquo;t standout like stockton for example but I think he&rsquo;s better imo</p>

      <label for="lkg9nkb" class="commentText"><p>Chuck was just as good of a rebounder as Rodman, which is why I hate when people just look at stats. </p>

<p>The reason Rodman got more rebounds was that was his role in his prime. Chuck had to also carry a huge offensive load, so he didn’t bother wasting his energy to grab those extra 2-3 rebounds. If it was just pure rebounding, those 2 are equal. </p>

<p>That’s why Rodman averaged fewer rebounds in his Pistons years when they won championships. He wasn’t a worse rebounder than in those years than his 15-17 rebound seasons (his offensive rebounding rate was actually the same). It’s because in those years, he had to focus more on wing defense so it made him get less counting stat rebounds. </p>

<p>That famous clip of him fighting Barkley 1 on 1 to the rebound and clinch it sums it up.</p>

      <label for="lkghxzt" class="commentText"><p>You know the irony of that clip. That was the Pistons Dennis Rodman who was only averaging 10 RPG and fewer than Barkley at that time. That’s why you can’t just look at that 15-17 RPG, which proves my first point. </p>

<p>Whether Rodman averaged 10 RPG or 15-17 RPG, he was the same level of rebounder. </p>

<p>If guarding 4s and 5s is more important than the 90s, Chicago ig would be his peak defensively, but what year do you think he was most versatile? Do you think his versatility outweighs the sheer impact of his interior defense in Chicago?</p>
