      <label for="lkgcw10" class="commentText"><p>He made the NBA top 75, but the interesting thought experiment for me is whether he&rsquo;s closer to the top of that group than the bottom. Conventional wisdom might put him below a lot of guys who were &ldquo;more skilled&rdquo; like Melo, AI, Harden, Westbrook. I&rsquo;m not really sure a great scorer adds more value than someone who is generational at rebounding and defense though. Those extra possessions and stops add a lot of value to your expected final score.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no Rodman parallel in the NBA right now, but I remember how annoying it was for GS to play Tristan Thompson in the 2016 Finals when he was cleaning up the glass and creating a lot of extra possessions. He doesn&rsquo;t get much credit for it, but he was an important part of the Cavs winning the championship. Rodman was much better than Thompson, and much more successful. 5 rings.</p>

<p>Would it be insane to put him in the all-time best PF discussion? It&rsquo;s a hard argument when guys like KG and Duncan were also great at defense and so much more skilled at scoring, but I think if you&rsquo;re building out a dream 5, you at least consider sticking him in there to be the perfect ceiling raiser and defensive anchor next to all your shooters.</p>

<p>I think you basically talked yourself into a hipster basketball take. Like it’s cool to think about insights that others might not see but Rodman’s rebounding and defense are not superhuman enough to put him over guys like Duncan or KG.</p>

      <label for="lkgkqpw" class="commentText"><p>I think his weakness on offense hampers the rest of the team a decent amount. If opposing teams can basically ignore him, it frees up a defender to cause havoc elsewhere.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much of an argument over someone like Duncan who is comparable on defense, also a good rebounder, and way way better on offense. And he&rsquo;s not ball dominant on offense, great at screens and passing, so he&rsquo;d slot right into a dream 5.</p>

He was never going to lead the league in scoring, but in Detroit he was at least passable and you couldn’t just completely ignore him. In Chicago it was better for Jordan to go 5:1 instead of hoping that Rodman could find a way to somehow both catch a pass and then put the ball in the basket.</p>

      <label for="lkgis22" class="commentText"><p>I feel you on all that, but your last argument muddies it up for me and borders on overrating in hindsight. The guy averaged like 4 pts. If he averages 10-12, then add in the rest of your argument; then we can start that conversation. But when I say he didn&rsquo;t score, he had ZERO scoring responsibility. Like, dude didn&rsquo;t even look at the basket. I watched him airball a FT once and just shrug his shoulders like it wasn&rsquo;t his problem. I love Rodman, but same as you wanted to account for his defense over a scorer like the ones you listed, I think oftentimes, scoring gets overlooked. Not somuch the fact that good scorers can score, cause they&rsquo;re indeed talented. But often times, because they&rsquo;re so talented we try to assign that as easiest, low effort thing for them to do, when these guys are targeted, scouted and expected to bring it every single night and pretty much do. So I can&rsquo;t put him on an alltime great list for PFs. You&rsquo;re talking about guys who can score 25 om great efficiency but miss the last shot and be cursed out here.</p>

      <label for="lkj31qa" class="commentText"><p>I hope by now you’ve read the skeptical sports link. It really is a classic. Anyway, one point from it is that it is clear that while Rodman didn’t score, his team did score when he was on the floor such that he was an offensive force that raised the offensive output of championship level teams. I don’t put him over KG and TD, but I’ve no problem with Rodman being a top ten PF of all time because team offense is ultimately all that matters (on offenese) and he was good at making his team’s offense better.</p>

<p>A clear rebounding advantage and good defense are so uplifting for your team and so crushing for the opponent. They would need a scorer who is way and beyond everyone else on the court to outdo that, and even then, often, it wouldn&rsquo;t be enough.</p>

      <label for="lkggn0t" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s on another planet as a rebounder. It&rsquo;s a bit like Steph with shooting. There have been lots of good shooters in the NBA, but Steph is an outlier among outliers. Rodman is like that when it comes to rebounding.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s one of the best defenders in that group, if not THE best. KG has a DPOY and a bunch of all-defense selections. Timmy has no DPOY, but a crazy number of all-defense selections. I&rsquo;m open to any opinion about which is the best defender from this trio, but Rodman is at least in the discussion.</p>

<p>That would be the argument. He&rsquo;s an elite defender who rebounds at an outlier level for his era.</p>

<p>I think I ultimately take KG for the 4 spot because he can do a lot of that stuff and also drop an easy 20 on your head, but Rodman is a considerably better rebounder. If your team already has Steph, Jordan, LeBron, and Shaq; you may not necessarily get a lot value from KG&rsquo;s offensive looks. They may actually be negative value compared to shots from your other options. In other words, even though KG was a good scorer, you still wouldn&rsquo;t want him taking shots when you have Steph, MJ, etc.</p>

<p>In that situation, Rodman being allergic to shooting almost works in your favor, as he can just focus on grabbing boards and recycling possessions while also playing all-timer defense on the other end. If you are picking players for an actual 5v5 game and not just based on their individual qualities, he&rsquo;s an interesting candidate.</p>

      <label for="lkghfwj" class="commentText"><p>Imo, KG and TD, but especially KG is several tiers above Rodman (who was an amazing defender) as a defender</p>

<p>Shotblocking in the 90s and 2000s is simply a preposterously overpowered quality to have. It’s why guys like Hakeem ruled the 90s and Shaq who would be near unplayable in a PNR was still a positive defender in the 2000s. And guys like KG have genuine 1-5 switchability, can chase around screens, and an ability to stay out of foul trouble?</p>

<p>Rodman was a great defender for his era but his primary utility still came from offensive rebounding (which as you say an outlier among outliers). TD is in that all time territory. And KG is a goat level defender. Fucking 7 foot Draymond it doesn’t even sound real.</p>

      <label for="lkgohe5" class="commentText"><p>It is interesting you are referencing KG as a versatile 1-5 defender because I think Rodman might be the best 1-5 defender of all time. Maybe I am misremembering but I mainly think of KG as a hyper athletic interior defender who could switch onto guards and hold his own. Similar to Giannis in 2024. But he wasn&rsquo;t primarily guarding Kobe or anything like that.</p>

<p>Rodman was on a different level. He could straight up defend the best player on the other team the whole game regardless of position. He guarded Karl Malone, Shaq, Michael Jordan, you name it, and he gave them all absolute hell. In a modern switch defense Rodman at his apex would be a terror.</p>

<p>The three big differences are KG was a 20 PPG guy, a legit rim protector, and KG was dependable and consistent.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s one of the best defenders in that group, if not THE best. KG has a DPOY and a bunch of all-defense selections. Timmy has no DPOY, but a crazy number of all-defense selections. I&rsquo;m open to any opinion about which is the best defender from this trio, but Rodman is at least in the discussion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both KG and Tim are better than Rodman. Rim protection is the most valuable form of defence by far.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That would be the argument. He&rsquo;s an elite defender who rebounds at an outlier level for his era.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&rsquo;s also straight-up garbage on offence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but Rodman is a considerably better rebounder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really. I&rsquo;m sure that if KG put the same effort into rebounding that he would put up similar numbers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you may not necessarily get a lot value from KG&rsquo;s offensive looks. They may actually be negative value compared to shots from your other options.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s not how that works whatsoever. Offense is about creating open shots and mismatches. Having a player that just provides absolutely 0 on offence makes that extremely difficult. You clearly have no idea about how an offense works.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If your team already has Steph, Jordan, LeBron, and Shaq;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You would probably want KD for spacing, and somebody like Klay or Kawhi as a 6th man for, guess what, even more spacing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In that situation, Rodman being allergic to shooting almost works in your favor, as he can just focus on grabbing boards and recycling possessions while also playing all-timer defense on the other end. If you are picking players for an actual 5v5 game and not just based on their individual qualities,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except it doesn&rsquo;t because he would severely limit that offence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>he&rsquo;s an interesting candidate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No he isn&rsquo;t, you just don&rsquo;t know ball.</p>

      <label for="lkhy14v" class="commentText"><p>If Rodman was just a great defender, no, but what puts him in the conversation or above them is the rebounding. Basketball is about creating chances or being extremely efficient. He would remove the other team&rsquo;s opportunity at a 2nd try while giving his team another.</p>

<p>Say for example that a team misses 4 shots in a row, Rodman being there means you don&rsquo;t get a second chance and your team has a potential 12 pt run if they made all 3s, just as a perfect example. Then, he allows your offense to not be as efficient because out of those 4 possessions, he grabs a couple of offensive boards giving you 6 shots vs 4 for your opponent. Add this up in a whole game with all of the possessions he&rsquo;s involved in and his value shoots up. You can have a worse, less efficient team and he will still create more chances for you, while still forcing the other team to be more efficient than normal to beat him. Add to that that he takes on the other team&rsquo;s best player and takes him out of the game through whatever means necessary and he just makes the other teams dramatically worse.</p>

<p>That is the best way to sum him up. He made the other teams worse just by being there and the players in your examples don&rsquo;t have that effect, they make their teams better offensively and through defense the other teams a little worse, but Rodman&rsquo;s effect tipped it in his direction because of how much worse he made the other teams play.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so hard to evaluate him, but brilliant coaches took him on and he was an incredibly important piece for teams who won 5 championships in 9 years.</p>

Phil Jackson praised how well he understood the triangle offense and ran his spots well on plays. Could he create his own shot? No, but he wasn&rsquo;t out there chucking the ball at the basket or turning over the ball hurting the offense.</p>

      <label for="lkfgzfk" class="commentText"><p>Wilt has more rebounding titles, however, in my opinion, it&rsquo;s Rodman, mostly because the pace of the game was much faster back in Wilt&rsquo;s day. If you look at Rodman&rsquo;s stats per 100 possessions, his averages are right up there with Wilt, and given that some of Wilt&rsquo;s teams played at pace of 120-130 possessions per game, I think that bears some significance. My guess is that, if you equalized the pace, Rodman would have a slim lead over Wilt in terms of rebounds per game and per possession.</p>

      <label for="lkggf1j" class="commentText"><p>I think Rodman is the best of all time and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that close. He also pursued rebounding as ferociously as other really talented, physically gifted players pursue scoring and he&rsquo;s really the only player ever to do that, so it makes sense.</p>

<p>Kevin Willis had just 2 seasons in the top 200. He’s 47th in career rebound %.</p>

      <label for="lkgmkr9" class="commentText"><p>I wish I could find the video but someone made a case that Drummond’s numbers are a little overrated—still very good, but not quite all-time—because he seemed to get a lot of rebounds that otherwise would’ve gone to his teammates.</p>

<p>Over a big sample size his team was only marginally better at rebounding when he was on the floor than off, which suggests that he wasn’t adding a <em>ton</em> of rebounding value even thought his individual numbers were good.</p>

<p>A guy I think they used as a contrast was Reggie Evans, who had good individual numbers but his teams did <em>way</em> better at rebounding when he was on the floor (probably because he was drawing a lot of box out attention and such).</p>

I’ll go one step further and say that if we were doing an all-time fantasy draft and I’m not picking top 5, I’m taking Dennis in the first round. He was that valuable to the team.

<p>Like yeah, maybe inch for inch he’s the best, but size is a pretty damn important part of it, and you can’t just wave that away. The ball doesn’t care if you’re 8 feet tall or 3 feet tall, it goes to who is better.</p>

<p>Wilt and Rodman are going for a rebound. Who gets it? That’s the best rebounder, fuck anything else</p>

      <label for="lkgel4n" class="commentText"><p>Rodman is one of the most interesting “would he be great in this era?” Former players to consider.</p>

<p>You could argue he would be even more impactful on defense. He would have even more freedom to roam on D. He would be like Draymond on steroids.</p>

<p>But playing him would mean you are playing 4 on 5 on offense. Teams would have zero respect for him as a shooter. Other than boxing out no one would ever put a man on him. So as great as would be on D, I’m not sure you could play him in today’s era.</p>

      <label for="lkgk6iu" class="commentText"><p>Pistons Dennis Rodman is who you want. Not the older Spurs and Bulls Rodman. </p>

<p>Pistons Dennis Rodman led the league in FG and eFG percentage while also defending all 5 positions and being just as good of a rebounder as older Dennis Rodman (but just didn’t stand next to the basket so it doesn’t show in raw counting rebounds - just shows up in offensive rebounding percentage). </p>

<p>That young Pistons Dennis Rodman would be like a better Ausar Thompson today, who clearly is playable. A better version of that would be a starter on every team. He would cut to the rim and finish in transition with dunks, which is how he led the entire league in FG percentage, even better than centers. </p>

      <label for="lkgs3hs" class="commentText"><p>That interesting. Putting him in the dunker spot might work. He didn&rsquo;t have to have a jump shot back then but teams still had to put a man him or it would be illegal defense. Today&rsquo;s game you don&rsquo;t have to put a man on everyone but maybe in this era he would develop a shot to get playing time.</p>

<p>The other possibility is he would feast on so many offensive rebounds that you&rsquo;d have to put a man on him to box him out.</p>

<p>A big part of the reason his FG% was so high is because he took so few shots. He never averaged more than 12 points a game. His career avg was only 7. He basically only shot open dunks, layups, and putbacks. Which was perfect for his era. A PF that rebounds and plays high level defense and doesn&rsquo;t take shots away from Jordan, Pippen, Thomas, or Dumars. Sign him up!</p>

<p>Aussar Thompson is playable on a bad team. Would he get playing time on a good team in the playoffs without a jump shot? In the playoffs teams will exploit any weakness.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to argue Rodman would be bad or great in this era. I just saying it would be interesting. He has such great strengths and was such a unique athlete but he never developed a great offensive game because he never had to. In today&rsquo;s game it&rsquo;s tough to have non-shooters out there. My guess would be great athletes would find a way to adjust.</p>

      <label for="lkg97na" class="commentText"><p>After playing the immaculate grid for a while now, its amazing how many teams have like only a couple 10+ rebounders in their entire history. Even though my Twolves historically are bad, we always had a 20 10 guy on our team. So it came as a surprise how many teams lack a dominant rebounder.</p>

      <label for="lkgfg52" class="commentText"><p>You could make a case that he&rsquo;d be a great pick in an all-time draft if you&rsquo;re looking at &ldquo;most likely team to win&rdquo; and not just &ldquo;5 best individuals&rdquo; - you don&rsquo;t need 5 elite scorers, you need a balance of slashing, shooting, creation, off-ball movement, wing defense, help defensive, rebounding, etc.</p>

<p>And there are so many great scorers and passers to pick at the top, you don&rsquo;t lose much if you have to pick a slightly worse guy. But if you get Rodman, then you get A+ rebounding and defensive versatility with a bigger gap to the next guy who has those traits.  The only problem would be the potential team chemistry and attitude issues, since you wouldn&rsquo;t be sure if the guy wasn&rsquo;t going to lose his cool and get suspended, or mess with the locker room with some sort of bizzarro antics.</p>

      <label for="lkgs495" class="commentText"><p>Nope, i get that looking at his numbers some can come out with this idea, and he definitely was a good rebounder, but at a certain point he made this his whole career and began to statpadding them.</p>

<p>Just looking at some Bulls games you will see he will get multiple rebounds per game where he take the ball off some teammate hands or he just jump into the stand to take a ball that would have been team ball anyway or lost anyway.</p>

<p>But as said he was a great rebounder to begin with, and can still be in the convo imho, but he is not the greatest ever. I would easily say that in his years Shaq and Olajuwon were better, also because had to fight multiple people in general to get them.</p>

Check out Ben Morris&rsquo; <a href="https://skepticalsports.com/the-case-for-dennis-rodman-guide/" target="_blank">https://skepticalsports.com/the-case-for-dennis-rodman-guide/</a></p>

<p>The thing people miss when bringing up Wilt / Russell etc is not adjusting for available rebounds, since obviously you can only grab rebounds that were available, so you should use rebound percentage.</p>

<p>Quoting Ben&rsquo;s analysis, which is based on rebound percentage:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rather than asking how abstractly probable or improbable Rodman’s accomplishments were, it may be easier to get a sense of his rebounding skill by comparing this result to results of the same process for other statistics.  To start with, note that weighting the offensive rebounding more heavily cuts both ways for Rodman: after the adjustment, he only holds the top 6 spots in NBA history, rather than the top 7.  On the other hand, he led the league in this category 10 times instead of 8, which is perfect for comparing him to another NBA player who led a major statistical category 10 times — Michael Jordan.</p>

<p>As you can see, the data suggests that Rodman was a better rebounder than Jordan was a scorer.  Of course, points per game isn’t a rate stat, and probably isn’t as reliable as rebounding %, but that cuts in Rodman’s favor.  Points per game should be more susceptible to varying circumstances that lead to extreme values.</p>

<p>Actually, it is hard to find any significant stat where someone has dominated as thoroughly as Rodman.  One of the closest I could find is John Stockton and the extremely obscure “Assist %” stat. Stockton amazingly led the league in this category 15 times, though he didn’t dominate individual seasons to the extent that Rodman did.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bit more on the math for those of you who like this kind of thing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If these outcomes were normally distributed, a 6 standard deviation event like Rodman’s 1994-1995 season would theoretically happen only about once every billion seasons.  But because each data point on this chart actually represents a maximum of a large sample of (mostly) normally distributed seasonal rebounding rates, they should instead be governed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumbel_distribution" target="_blank">Gumbel distribution for extreme values</a>: this leads to a much more manageable expected frequency of approximately once every 400 years (of course, that pertains to the odds of someone like Rodman coming along in the first place; now that we’ve had Rodman, the odds of another one showing up are substantially higher).  In reality, there are so many variables at play from era to era, season to season, or even team to team, that a probability model probably doesn’t tell us as much as we would like (also, though standard deviations converge fairly quickly, the sample size is relatively modest).</p>

      <label for="lkh6myp" class="commentText"><p>As others have said and posted links to someone who actually broke it down, and figured out that Dennis actually is the greatest rebounder ever.</p>

<p>One of the main issues he had is that he started way late, and he couldn’t control the demons of his early life in the later stages of his career.
Had Rodman been in a good state of mind, I don’t doubt he could’ve played well into his 40s. Dude had a motor like no one else.
Another thing to look at to grasp a basic understanding here, is that Wilt, Bill, and Kareem have A LOT more minutes played than Dennis.</p>

      <label for="lkinqo1" class="commentText"><p>Dennis was still a great rebounder even during his tenure with Lakers and Dallas.  In fact, he was leading the league in rpg but didn&rsquo;t clock enough games to clock the minimum total to qualify.</p>

<p>If his personality wasn&rsquo;t so abrasive and eccentric, I&rsquo;m sure there would be teams willing to give him a go and he could well continue being a rebounding beast.</p>
