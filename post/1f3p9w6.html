      <label for="lkgcw10" class="commentText"><p>He made the NBA top 75, but the interesting thought experiment for me is whether he&rsquo;s closer to the top of that group than the bottom. Conventional wisdom might put him below a lot of guys who were &ldquo;more skilled&rdquo; like Melo, AI, Harden, Westbrook. I&rsquo;m not really sure a great scorer adds more value than someone who is generational at rebounding and defense though. Those extra possessions and stops add a lot of value to your expected final score.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no Rodman parallel in the NBA right now, but I remember how annoying it was for GS to play Tristan Thompson in the 2016 Finals when he was cleaning up the glass and creating a lot of extra possessions. He doesn&rsquo;t get much credit for it, but he was an important part of the Cavs winning the championship. Rodman was much better than Thompson, and much more successful. 5 rings.</p>

<p>Would it be insane to put him in the all-time best PF discussion? It&rsquo;s a hard argument when guys like KG and Duncan were also great at defense and so much more skilled at scoring, but I think if you&rsquo;re building out a dream 5, you at least consider sticking him in there to be the perfect ceiling raiser and defensive anchor next to all your shooters.</p>

<p>I think you basically talked yourself into a hipster basketball take. Like it’s cool to think about insights that others might not see but Rodman’s rebounding and defense are not superhuman enough to put him over guys like Duncan or KG.</p>

      <label for="lkgis22" class="commentText"><p>I feel you on all that, but your last argument muddies it up for me and borders on overrating in hindsight. The guy averaged like 4 pts. If he averages 10-12, then add in the rest of your argument; then we can start that conversation. But when I say he didn&rsquo;t score, he had ZERO scoring responsibility. Like, dude didn&rsquo;t even look at the basket. I watched him airball a FT once and just shrug his shoulders like it wasn&rsquo;t his problem. I love Rodman, but same as you wanted to account for his defense over a scorer like the ones you listed, I think oftentimes, scoring gets overlooked. Not somuch the fact that good scorers can score, cause they&rsquo;re indeed talented. But often times, because they&rsquo;re so talented we try to assign that as easiest, low effort thing for them to do, when these guys are targeted, scouted and expected to bring it every single night and pretty much do. So I can&rsquo;t put him on an alltime great list for PFs. You&rsquo;re talking about guys who can score 25 om great efficiency but miss the last shot and be cursed out here.</p>

      <label for="lkgl2sh" class="commentText"><p>There&rsquo;s numerous old Rodman games where once his team was actually down a significant number of points he actually would start putting effort into his baskets and scoring.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s another one of those many elements that gets lost with the hyper-focus on stats when analyzing the old guard, but he did it pretty consistently.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a famous game where he hits like 3 3-pointers in a row in like the span of 2 minutes when his team was down.</p>

<p>Rodman always sunk his shots when they mattered.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much of an argument over someone like Duncan who is comparable on defense, also a good rebounder, and way way better on offense. And he&rsquo;s not ball dominant on offense, great at screens and passing, so he&rsquo;d slot right into a dream 5.</p>

He was never going to lead the league in scoring, but in Detroit he was at least passable and you couldn’t just completely ignore him. In Chicago it was better for Jordan to go 5:1 instead of hoping that Rodman could find a way to somehow both catch a pass and then put the ball in the basket.</p>

      <label for="lkggn0t" class="commentText"><p>He&rsquo;s on another planet as a rebounder. It&rsquo;s a bit like Steph with shooting. There have been lots of good shooters in the NBA, but Steph is an outlier among outliers. Rodman is like that when it comes to rebounding.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s one of the best defenders in that group, if not THE best. KG has a DPOY and a bunch of all-defense selections. Timmy has no DPOY, but a crazy number of all-defense selections. I&rsquo;m open to any opinion about which is the best defender from this trio, but Rodman is at least in the discussion.</p>

<p>That would be the argument. He&rsquo;s an elite defender who rebounds at an outlier level for his era.</p>

<p>I think I ultimately take KG for the 4 spot because he can do a lot of that stuff and also drop an easy 20 on your head, but Rodman is a considerably better rebounder. If your team already has Steph, Jordan, LeBron, and Shaq; you may not necessarily get a lot value from KG&rsquo;s offensive looks. They may actually be negative value compared to shots from your other options. In other words, even though KG was a good scorer, you still wouldn&rsquo;t want him taking shots when you have Steph, MJ, etc.</p>

<p>In that situation, Rodman being allergic to shooting almost works in your favor, as he can just focus on grabbing boards and recycling possessions while also playing all-timer defense on the other end. If you are picking players for an actual 5v5 game and not just based on their individual qualities, he&rsquo;s an interesting candidate.</p>

      <label for="lkghfwj" class="commentText"><p>Imo, KG and TD, but especially KG is several tiers above Rodman (who was an amazing defender) as a defender</p>

<p>Shotblocking in the 90s and 2000s is simply a preposterously overpowered quality to have. It’s why guys like Hakeem ruled the 90s and Shaq who would be near unplayable in a PNR was still a positive defender in the 2000s. And guys like KG have genuine 1-5 switchability, can chase around screens, and an ability to stay out of foul trouble?</p>

<p>Rodman was a great defender for his era but his primary utility still came from offensive rebounding (which as you say an outlier among outliers). TD is in that all time territory. And KG is a goat level defender. Fucking 7 foot Draymond it doesn’t even sound real.</p>

      <label for="lkgohe5" class="commentText"><p>It is interesting you are referencing KG as a versatile 1-5 defender because I think Rodman might be the best 1-5 defender of all time. Maybe I am misremembering but I mainly think of KG as a hyper athletic interior defender who could switch onto guards and hold his own. Similar to Giannis in 2024. But he wasn&rsquo;t primarily guarding Kobe or anything like that.</p>

<p>Rodman was on a different level. He could straight up defend the best player on the other team the whole game regardless of position. He guarded Karl Malone, Shaq, Michael Jordan, you name it, and he gave them all absolute hell. In a modern switch defense Rodman at his apex would be a terror.</p>

<p>100% agree. But Stephs shooting is vastly more valuable.</p>

<p>Both KG and Tim are better than Rodman. Rim protection is the most valuable form of defence by far.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That would be the argument. He&rsquo;s an elite defender who rebounds at an outlier level for his era.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&rsquo;s also straight-up garbage on offence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but Rodman is a considerably better rebounder.</p>

<p>Not really. I&rsquo;m sure that if KG put the same effort into rebounding that he would put up similar numbers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you may not necessarily get a lot value from KG&rsquo;s offensive looks. They may actually be negative value compared to shots from your other options.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s not how that works whatsoever. Offense is about creating open shots and mismatches. Having a player that just provides absolutely 0 on offence makes that extremely difficult. You clearly have no idea about how an offense works.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If your team already has Steph, Jordan, LeBron, and Shaq;</p>

<p>You would probably want KD for spacing, and somebody like Klay or Kawhi as a 6th man for, guess what, even more spacing.</p>

      <label for="lkhy14v" class="commentText"><p>If Rodman was just a great defender, no, but what puts him in the conversation or above them is the rebounding. Basketball is about creating chances or being extremely efficient. He would remove the other team&rsquo;s opportunity at a 2nd try while giving his team another.</p>

<p>Say for example that a team misses 4 shots in a row, Rodman being there means you don&rsquo;t get a second chance and your team has a potential 12 pt run if they made all 3s, just as a perfect example. Then, he allows your offense to not be as efficient because out of those 4 possessions, he grabs a couple of offensive boards giving you 6 shots vs 4 for your opponent. Add this up in a whole game with all of the possessions he&rsquo;s involved in and his value shoots up. You can have a worse, less efficient team and he will still create more chances for you, while still forcing the other team to be less efficient. Add to that that he take s on the other team&rsquo;s best player and takes him out of the game through whatever means necessary and he just makes the other teams worse.</p>

<p>That is the best way to sum him up. He made the other teams worse just by being there and the players in your examples don&rsquo;t have that effect, they make their teams better offensively and through defense the other teams a little worse, but Rodman&rsquo;s effect tipped it in his direction because of how much worse he made the other teams play.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so hard to evaluate him, but brilliant coaches took him on and he was an incredibly important piece for teams who won 5 championships in 9 years.</p>

      <label for="lkh4zt5" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think this is too complicated. I personally would almost always want to pick the rebounder/defender over the scorer.</p>

<p>A clear rebounding advantage and good defense are so uplifting for your team and so crushing for the opponent. They would need a scorer who is way and beyond everyone else on the court to outdo that, and even then, often, it wouldn&rsquo;t be enough.</p>

      <label for="lkgiper" class="commentText"><p>Rodman is a great complimentary piece on title teams, shirk that’s valuable let’s not make any mistakes here, that’s what they are, complementary. I know this because in the finals he’s only playing 28 minutes a game for his career because he’s such a 0 on offense, which eats into his defense because he’s not playing big minutes</p>

<p>There are many more Dennis Rodmans than Carmelo Anthony’s or most certainly James hardens. He’s probably bottom 5 on the top 75</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I was sort of with you until that line. There&rsquo;s currently nobody in the league with his rebounding ability and interior defending.</p>

<p>The league is full of guys who can score. Ask yourself why Harden, Melo, AI, Luka, etc haven&rsquo;t won titles if their offense is that valuable. Trae, Booker, Luka, Mitchell, and Fox aren&rsquo;t winning anything.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a team game and you need contributions in other categories. Players who can do that at a high level win hardware like Draymond, Rodman, Jrue, and Bowen. Bam has made the Finals more times than AI, Harden, or Melo. Part of that is Jimmy, but Jimmy without Bam is not getting anywhere. You can&rsquo;t necessarily say one thing is more important than the other.</p>

      <label for="lkgtcd6" class="commentText"><p>What a ridiculous take. The reason these guys you mentioned didn&rsquo;t win championships is because they weren&rsquo;t on the same team with fucking MJ, Pippen and Kukoc or the Pistons superteams with IT, Dumars, Dantley, Aguirre etc.
You mentioned Luka twice, when he took a team of scrubs to the WCF and a team with Kyrie and a bunch of role players to the NBA finals. Swap Luka with Rodman and these teams wouldn&rsquo;t even sniff the playoffs.</p>

If you look at Rodman&rsquo;s stats per 100 possessions, his averages are right up there with Wilt, and given that some of Wilt&rsquo;s teams played at pace of 120-130 possessions per game, I think that bears some significance. My guess is that, if you equalized the pace, Rodman would have a slim lead over Wilt in terms of rebounds per game and per possession.</p>

<p>Kevin Willis had just 2 seasons in the top 200. He’s 47th in career rebound %.</p>

<p>You’re ridiculously underselling Drummond on the glass. That’s basically the equivalent is saying Mark Eaton blocks shots at the rate of Elton Brand.</p>

      <label for="lkgmkr9" class="commentText"><p>I wish I could find the video but someone made a case that Drummond’s numbers are a little overrated—still very good, but not quite all-time—because he seemed to get a lot of rebounds that otherwise would’ve gone to his teammates.</p>

<p>Over a big sample size his team was only marginally better at rebounding when he was on the floor than off, which suggests that he wasn’t adding a <em>ton</em> of rebounding value even thought his individual numbers were good.</p>

<p>A guy I think they used as a contrast was Reggie Evans, who had good individual numbers but his teams did <em>way</em> better at rebounding when he was on the floor (probably because he was drawing a lot of box out attention and such).</p>

<p>Like yeah, maybe inch for inch he’s the best, but size is a pretty damn important part of it, and you can’t just wave that away. The ball doesn’t care if you’re 8 feet tall or 3 feet tall, it goes to who is better.</p>

<p>Wilt and Rodman are going for a rebound. Who gets it? That’s the best rebounder, fuck anything else</p>

<p>You could argue he would be even more impactful on defense. He would have even more freedom to roam on D. He would be like Draymond on steroids.</p>

<p>But playing him would mean you are playing 4 on 5 on offense. Teams would have zero respect for him as a shooter. Other than boxing out no one would ever put a man on him. So as great as would be on D, I’m not sure you could play him in today’s era.</p>

<p>Pistons Dennis Rodman led the league in FG and eFG percentage while also defending all 5 positions and being just as good of a rebounder as older Dennis Rodman (but just didn’t stand next to the basket so it doesn’t show in raw counting rebounds - just shows up in offensive rebounding percentage). </p>

<p>That young Pistons Dennis Rodman would be like a better Ausar Thompson today, who clearly is playable. A better version of that would be a starter on every team. He would cut to the rim and finish in transition with dunks, which is how he led the entire league in FG percentage, even better than centers. </p>

      <label for="lkgs3hs" class="commentText"><p>That interesting. Putting him in the dunker spot might work. He didn&rsquo;t have to have a jump shot back then but teams still had to put a man him or it would be illegal defense. Today&rsquo;s game you don&rsquo;t have to put a man on everyone but maybe in this era he would develop a shot to get playing time.</p>

<p>The other possibility is he would feast on so many offensive rebounds that you&rsquo;d have to put a man on him to box him out.</p>

<p>A big part of the reason his FG% was so high is because he took so few shots. He never averaged more than 12 points a game. His career avg was only 7. He basically only shot open dunks, layups, and putbacks. Which was perfect for his era. A PF that rebounds and plays high level defense and doesn&rsquo;t take shots away from Jordan, Pippen, Thomas, or Dumars. Sign him up!</p>

<p>Aussar Thompson is playable on a bad team. Would he get playing time on a good team in the playoffs without a jump shot? In the playoffs teams will exploit any weakness.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to argue Rodman would be bad or great in this era. I just saying it would be interesting. He has such great strengths and was such a unique athlete but he never developed a great offensive game because he never had to. In today&rsquo;s game it&rsquo;s tough to have non-shooters out there. My guess would be great athletes would find a way to adjust.</p>

      <label for="lkgfg52" class="commentText"><p>You could make a case that he&rsquo;d be a great pick in an all-time draft if you&rsquo;re looking at &ldquo;most likely team to win&rdquo; and not just &ldquo;5 best individuals&rdquo; - you don&rsquo;t need 5 elite scorers, you need a balance of slashing, shooting, creation, off-ball movement, wing defense, help defensive, rebounding, etc.</p>

<p>And there are so many great scorers and passers to pick at the top, you don&rsquo;t lose much if you have to pick a slightly worse guy. But if you get Rodman, then you get A+ rebounding and defensive versatility with a bigger gap to the next guy who has those traits.  The only problem would be the potential team chemistry and attitude issues, since you wouldn&rsquo;t be sure if the guy wasn&rsquo;t going to lose his cool and get suspended, or mess with the locker room with some sort of bizzarro antics.</p>

      <label for="lkgfk2x" class="commentText"><p>For the modern era, I would say yes I know pound for pound is usually boxing thing, but yes Dennis rodman is pound for pound the greatest rebounder of all time, and obviously you look at some of those numbers in the 60s, it was a different game but Mr Chamberlain and Mr Russell are the only two players with over 20,000 rebounds so we had to give the due respect there</p>

      <label for="lkgtbte" class="commentText"><p>Rodman&rsquo;s the greatest rebounder of all time, and it&rsquo;s not close. Check out Ben Morris&rsquo; <a href="https://skepticalsports.com/the-case-for-dennis-rodman-guide/" target="_blank">https://skepticalsports.com/the-case-for-dennis-rodman-guide/</a></p>

<p>The thing people miss when bringing up Wilt / Russell etc is not adjusting for available rebounds, since obviously you can only grab rebounds that were available, so you should use rebound percentage.</p>

<p>Quoting Ben&rsquo;s analysis, which is based on rebound percentage:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rather than asking how abstractly probable or improbable Rodman’s accomplishments were, it may be easier to get a sense of his rebounding skill by comparing this result to results of the same process for other statistics.  To start with, note that weighting the offensive rebounding more heavily cuts both ways for Rodman: after the adjustment, he only holds the top 6 spots in NBA history, rather than the top 7.  On the other hand, he led the league in this category 10 times instead of 8, which is perfect for comparing him to another NBA player who led a major statistical category 10 times — Michael Jordan.</p>

<p>As you can see, the data suggests that Rodman was a better rebounder than Jordan was a scorer.  Of course, points per game isn’t a rate stat, and probably isn’t as reliable as rebounding %, but that cuts in Rodman’s favor.  Points per game should be more susceptible to varying circumstances that lead to extreme values.</p>

<p>Actually, it is hard to find any significant stat where someone has dominated as thoroughly as Rodman.  One of the closest I could find is John Stockton and the extremely obscure “Assist %” stat. Stockton amazingly led the league in this category 15 times, though he didn’t dominate individual seasons to the extent that Rodman did.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bit more on the math for those of you who like this kind of thing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If these outcomes were normally distributed, a 6 standard deviation event like Rodman’s 1994-1995 season would theoretically happen only about once every billion seasons.  But because each data point on this chart actually represents a maximum of a large sample of (mostly) normally distributed seasonal rebounding rates, they should instead be governed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumbel_distribution" target="_blank">Gumbel distribution for extreme values</a>: this leads to a much more manageable expected frequency of approximately once every 400 years (of course, that pertains to the odds of someone like Rodman coming along in the first place; now that we’ve had Rodman, the odds of another one showing up are substantially higher).  In reality, there are so many variables at play from era to era, season to season, or even team to team, that a probability model probably doesn’t tell us as much as we would like (also, though standard deviations converge fairly quickly, the sample size is relatively modest).</p>

<p>Just looking at some Bulls games you will see he will get multiple rebounds per game where he take the ball off some teammate hands or he just jump into the stand to take a ball that would have been team ball anyway or lost anyway.</p>

<p>But as said he was a great rebounder to begin with, and can still be in the convo imho, but he is not the greatest ever. I would easily say that in his years Shaq and Olajuwon were better, also because had to fight multiple people in general to get them.</p>

      <label for="lkh6myp" class="commentText"><p>As others have said and posted links to someone who actually broke it down, and figured out that Dennis actually is the greatest rebounder ever.</p>

<p>One of the main issues he had is that he started way late, and he couldn’t control the demons of his early life in the later stages of his career.
Had Rodman been in a good state of mind, I don’t doubt he could’ve played well into his 40s. Dude had a motor like no one else.
Another thing to look at to grasp a basic understanding here, is that Wilt, Bill, and Kareem have A LOT more minutes played than Dennis.</p>

Had his main job been only to rebound he probably could&rsquo;ve averaged 20+ a game that series. Wilt also averaged 20 for quite a while while being the best scorer in the league so he probably could&rsquo;ve averaged 30+ had he not been scoring 30 ppg at least</p>

I just used Duncan as an example that he could actually rebound very well but since he was the focus of every opposing teams defense he wasn&rsquo;t allowed to grab more than his usual 11 or 12</p>

Look at someone like Drummond he was breaking all kinds of records and lead the league in rebounding yet was never really as good of a rebounder as his contemporaries he just focused on getting rebounds more than anyone at the time and therefore put up monster rebounding statlines</p>

Rodman is definitely a top 5 or top 3 rebounder ever it&rsquo;s just hard to say he&rsquo;s the best without a doubt, kinda like Jokic he&rsquo;s one of the best passers ever but unless u actually watch him his passing stats won&rsquo;t standout like stockton for example but I think he&rsquo;s better imo</p>

      <label for="lkg9nkb" class="commentText"><p>Chuck was just as good of a rebounder as Rodman, which is why I hate when people just look at stats. </p>

<p>The reason Rodman got more rebounds was that was his role in his prime. Chuck had to also carry a huge offensive load, so he didn’t bother wasting his energy to grab those extra 2-3 rebounds. If it was just pure rebounding, those 2 are equal. </p>

<p>That’s why Rodman averaged fewer rebounds in his Pistons years when they won championships. He wasn’t a worse rebounder than in those years than his 15-17 rebound seasons (his offensive rebounding rate was actually the same). It’s because in those years, he had to focus more on wing defense so it made him get less counting stat rebounds. </p>

      <label for="lkfkbrs" class="commentText"><p>What year do you think Rodman was at his best defensively? When I watch him, it seems he was much better guarding 1-3/perimeter defense in Detroit, but by Chicago, he was at his best guarding 4-5.</p>

<p>If guarding 4s and 5s is more important than the 90s, Chicago ig would be his peak defensively, but what year do you think he was most versatile? Do you think his versatility outweighs the sheer impact of his interior defense in Chicago?</p>
