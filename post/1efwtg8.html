      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1efwtg8/collier_lavine_has_also_felt_singled_out_during/"><p>[Collier] LaVine has also felt singled out during film sessions and feels like he has taken too much blame for the team&rsquo;s losing during his tenure &ndash; which has produced one playoff appearance in seven years &ndash; despite other roster failings, sources told ESPN.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>There&rsquo;s no appetite in our building to go young and just blow it all up,&rdquo; Eversley said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gone young. We&rsquo;ve got players who are experienced and give us a greater opportunity to have a longer runway for sustainability to winning meaningful games for a longer time.</strong></p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to, a year from now, [be] winning 15 games and focusing on the lottery. We have an opportunity here to roll out younger players who give us an opportunity to turn this thing around, maybe not quicker, but in a more pragmatic approach than just looking at the future and building through the draft.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>By acquiring Giddey, the Bulls had marked a new direction. Re-signing restricted free agent Williams, the No. 4 overall pick in the 2020 draft, became a priority because he was the same age as the rest of the core and management still believes in his upside.</p>

<p>THE TENSION BETWEEN LaVine and the organization has been growing over the past year.</p>

<p>When the team got off to a rough start at the beginning of the season, LaVine expressed his frustration with the constant losing. LaVine knew the Bulls had engaged in trade conversations last summer, so through his representation at Klutch Sports, he let the organization know he was open to the two sides working together to find a new destination. It was short of a full trade request, but it still irked Karnisovas, sources told ESPN, a slight perceived as LaVine not being committed to sticking with the team.</p>

<p>LaVine also annoyed the organization with his decision to have season-ending surgery in February &ndash; a decision they were sure to note in a press release was a route chosen by LaVine and his agent, Rich Paul, instead of rehabbing with hopes to play the rest of the season.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never want to have surgery,&rdquo; LaVine said in March, a month after his surgery, while noting he was already ahead of schedule. &ldquo;But I got to a conclusion, especially with what the doctor was telling me, your pain level, this thing isn&rsquo;t going to heal on its own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>LaVine has also clashed in recent years with coach Billy Donovan. The two have remained mostly cordial about their relationship in public, but they have not been on the same page in recent seasons. The most public incident occurred in Nov. 2022, when Donovan benched LaVine during a fourth quarter comeback that ultimately fell short against the Orlando Magic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You play a guy like me down the stretch,&rdquo; LaVine said after the game that night.</p>

<p><strong>LaVine has also felt singled out during film sessions and feels like he has taken too much blame for the team&rsquo;s losing during his tenure &ndash; which has produced one playoff appearance in seven years &ndash; despite other roster failings, sources told ESPN. Donovan, meanwhile, believes he&rsquo;s been trying to get LaVine to buy in to a more team-friendly playing style, according to sources, emphasizing the way the Bulls competed in LaVine&rsquo;s absence last year as evidence for the team&rsquo;s potential if LaVine fits within the system.</strong></p>

<p>Donovan flew to Los Angeles for a few days in July to spend time with LaVine and continue to invest in their relationship, the feedback from which was positive, per sources.</p>

<p>Despite LaVine&rsquo;s name sitting at the center of trade speculation for months, the Bulls are preparing to welcome him back to training camp this fall.</p>

<p>A trade market never developed fully for LaVine throughout the season in part because of his contract &ndash; he still has three-years, $138 million remaining on the maximum contract he signed in 2022 &ndash; but also because of injuries that slowed his 2023-24 season (he only played in 25 games before having right foot surgery in February). LaVine has fully recovered from the injury and will be ready to start the season on time. He has been in communication with the Bulls, who also had team trainers in Los Angeles this summer to visit him for a workout.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most unfortunate situation for Zach last year was that he got hurt,&rdquo; Eversley said. &ldquo;Coming out of camp, he wasn&rsquo;t right. Him going down early in the season proved that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When he came back, he was pretty good and the team was pretty good. Small sample size, but we can build off that. Simply put, we&rsquo;re looking forward to having him come back to training camp and joining the team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It remains to be seen if LaVine&rsquo;s presence will work toward the team&rsquo;s primary goal. A two-time All-Star and one of the league&rsquo;s most explosive offensive players, LaVine returning to form could help rebuild his value across the league for a potential trade. If Chicago is fully committed to developing its young players, however, having the ball in their hands will be critical. That makes LaVine, who has averaged 18.1 field goals in 34.5 minutes per game in his Bulls career, an awkward fit.</p>

<p>If the seven-year relationship between LaVine and the Bulls could be described as a marriage, it&rsquo;s one where both sides are in agreement that a separation is needed. Both parties have remained professional for now, but the only question is when, not if, the partnership will end and whether it can do so before things get messy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s never won, he&rsquo;s done it his way the whole way and never won,&rdquo; a team source told ESPN. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s interested in winning, he&rsquo;ll do what&rsquo;s asked of him. And if he&rsquo;s motivated to not be here, one way is to come, be compliant and be who he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Bulls owe their 2025 first-round draft pick to the Spurs, but it&rsquo;s top-10 protected. But they haven&rsquo;t shown any interest in falling to the bottom of the standings to keep the pick either.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve promised change and we think we&rsquo;ve executed that,&rdquo; Eversley said. &ldquo;I think the changes being made at all levels of the organization are positive ones. Now it&rsquo;s time to put in the work and see if some of those changes are going to be fruitful or not.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lfo18ix" class="commentText"><p>Zach&rsquo;s main fault in his career is having any faith in this organization. He should&rsquo;ve asked to be traded ages ago. Generally, he&rsquo;s been way too professional over how terrible this team is. He wanted to win here when the best point guard he&rsquo;s ever played with has been 41 games of Lonzo, and Caruso, who comes off the bench. Behind that it&rsquo;s Coby White before his MIP year and Tomas Satoranski.</p>

<p>Not surprised now that we&rsquo;re past the point of no return, he&rsquo;d be framed differently despite years of professional. It doesn&rsquo;t get you anything, sometimes guys gotta just be KD.</p>

      <label for="lfo2lfz" class="commentText"><p>They gave dude an unfavorable Max contract against the organization’s interest and he didn’t play to that worth. I think Lavine is talented. He’s definitely overhated. But dude didn’t play his part to the best of his ability. Now he’s mad that no teams want him.</p>

      <label for="lfo2lm1" class="commentText"><p>Zach and Billy are gonna be what we need to watch. I think Zach in a vacuum will be a good trooper and play like someone who has a lot to prove and will relish being the #1 option again in Chicago but that still may not be in a way that&rsquo;s conducive to team success, although it is VERY overstated how he&rsquo;s somehow a negative player, when the data does not back that up. That being said, I don&rsquo;t know if Zach and Billy and their relationship is reparable.</p>

<p>DeMar/Zach/Vooch didn&rsquo;t work, but Zach independently is not a negative player and his shotmaking is something any team could use.</p>

<p>As far as the front office&rsquo;s brainstorming/plans are concerned the Giddey deal kinda signaled they weren&rsquo;t interested in a complete tank job. I&rsquo;m sure even with Caruso&rsquo;s value being a bit lower than it otherwise would&rsquo;ve been in-season that they could&rsquo;ve gotten a different deal elsewhere and they went with the Thunder because of Giddey. They clearly must believe strongly in Giddey&rsquo;s abilities outside of OKC and really being handed playmaking keys.</p>

<p>The Bulls have been reluctant to go the full tear down route even after it has become clear the last few years that their ceiling with the past core was play-in. Yet they&rsquo;ve also been unwilling to really go all-in on competitiveness (ie. unwilling to pay luxury tax) so the direction is a bit head scratching.</p>

<p><strong>LaVine knew the Bulls had engaged in trade conversations last summer</strong>, so through his representation at Klutch Sports, he let the organization know he was open to the two sides working together to find a new destination. <strong>It was short of a full trade request, but it still irked Karnisovas, sources told ESPN, a slight perceived as LaVine not being committed to sticking with the team.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But… <em>you were already trying to trade him.</em></p>

<p>It sounds like Zach was the one that was trying to keep it professional and the Bulls front office is trying to put their own failures solely on him.</p>

      <label for="lfo7561" class="commentText"><p>This is such a bizarre situation. He was one of the most highly regarded SG’s a few years ago and now he’s a negative asset. He’s been in the league 10 years and been on 1 over .500 team. Chicago is the most incompetent FO in the sport, or this guy just doesn’t know how to win. Either way, that team needs to clean house with their staff either from a roster building or player development standpoint, it’s obviously not working.</p>
