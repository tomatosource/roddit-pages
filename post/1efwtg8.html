      <a class="postTitle" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1efwtg8/collier_lavine_has_also_felt_singled_out_during/"><p>[Collier] LaVine has also felt singled out during film sessions and feels like he has taken too much blame for the team&rsquo;s losing during his tenure &ndash; which has produced one playoff appearance in seven years &ndash; despite other roster failings, sources told ESPN.</p>
</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>There&rsquo;s no appetite in our building to go young and just blow it all up,&rdquo; Eversley said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gone young. We&rsquo;ve got players who are experienced and give us a greater opportunity to have a longer runway for sustainability to winning meaningful games for a longer time.</strong></p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to, a year from now, [be] winning 15 games and focusing on the lottery. We have an opportunity here to roll out younger players who give us an opportunity to turn this thing around, maybe not quicker, but in a more pragmatic approach than just looking at the future and building through the draft.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>By acquiring Giddey, the Bulls had marked a new direction. Re-signing restricted free agent Williams, the No. 4 overall pick in the 2020 draft, became a priority because he was the same age as the rest of the core and management still believes in his upside.</p>

<p>THE TENSION BETWEEN LaVine and the organization has been growing over the past year.</p>

<p>When the team got off to a rough start at the beginning of the season, LaVine expressed his frustration with the constant losing. LaVine knew the Bulls had engaged in trade conversations last summer, so through his representation at Klutch Sports, he let the organization know he was open to the two sides working together to find a new destination. It was short of a full trade request, but it still irked Karnisovas, sources told ESPN, a slight perceived as LaVine not being committed to sticking with the team.</p>

<p>LaVine also annoyed the organization with his decision to have season-ending surgery in February &ndash; a decision they were sure to note in a press release was a route chosen by LaVine and his agent, Rich Paul, instead of rehabbing with hopes to play the rest of the season.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never want to have surgery,&rdquo; LaVine said in March, a month after his surgery, while noting he was already ahead of schedule. &ldquo;But I got to a conclusion, especially with what the doctor was telling me, your pain level, this thing isn&rsquo;t going to heal on its own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>LaVine has also clashed in recent years with coach Billy Donovan. The two have remained mostly cordial about their relationship in public, but they have not been on the same page in recent seasons. The most public incident occurred in Nov. 2022, when Donovan benched LaVine during a fourth quarter comeback that ultimately fell short against the Orlando Magic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You play a guy like me down the stretch,&rdquo; LaVine said after the game that night.</p>

<p><strong>LaVine has also felt singled out during film sessions and feels like he has taken too much blame for the team&rsquo;s losing during his tenure &ndash; which has produced one playoff appearance in seven years &ndash; despite other roster failings, sources told ESPN. Donovan, meanwhile, believes he&rsquo;s been trying to get LaVine to buy in to a more team-friendly playing style, according to sources, emphasizing the way the Bulls competed in LaVine&rsquo;s absence last year as evidence for the team&rsquo;s potential if LaVine fits within the system.</strong></p>

<p>Donovan flew to Los Angeles for a few days in July to spend time with LaVine and continue to invest in their relationship, the feedback from which was positive, per sources.</p>

<p>Despite LaVine&rsquo;s name sitting at the center of trade speculation for months, the Bulls are preparing to welcome him back to training camp this fall.</p>

<p>A trade market never developed fully for LaVine throughout the season in part because of his contract &ndash; he still has three-years, $138 million remaining on the maximum contract he signed in 2022 &ndash; but also because of injuries that slowed his 2023-24 season (he only played in 25 games before having right foot surgery in February). LaVine has fully recovered from the injury and will be ready to start the season on time. He has been in communication with the Bulls, who also had team trainers in Los Angeles this summer to visit him for a workout.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most unfortunate situation for Zach last year was that he got hurt,&rdquo; Eversley said. &ldquo;Coming out of camp, he wasn&rsquo;t right. Him going down early in the season proved that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When he came back, he was pretty good and the team was pretty good. Small sample size, but we can build off that. Simply put, we&rsquo;re looking forward to having him come back to training camp and joining the team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It remains to be seen if LaVine&rsquo;s presence will work toward the team&rsquo;s primary goal. A two-time All-Star and one of the league&rsquo;s most explosive offensive players, LaVine returning to form could help rebuild his value across the league for a potential trade. If Chicago is fully committed to developing its young players, however, having the ball in their hands will be critical. That makes LaVine, who has averaged 18.1 field goals in 34.5 minutes per game in his Bulls career, an awkward fit.</p>

<p>If the seven-year relationship between LaVine and the Bulls could be described as a marriage, it&rsquo;s one where both sides are in agreement that a separation is needed. Both parties have remained professional for now, but the only question is when, not if, the partnership will end and whether it can do so before things get messy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s never won, he&rsquo;s done it his way the whole way and never won,&rdquo; a team source told ESPN. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s interested in winning, he&rsquo;ll do what&rsquo;s asked of him. And if he&rsquo;s motivated to not be here, one way is to come, be compliant and be who he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Bulls owe their 2025 first-round draft pick to the Spurs, but it&rsquo;s top-10 protected. But they haven&rsquo;t shown any interest in falling to the bottom of the standings to keep the pick either.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve promised change and we think we&rsquo;ve executed that,&rdquo; Eversley said. &ldquo;I think the changes being made at all levels of the organization are positive ones. Now it&rsquo;s time to put in the work and see if some of those changes are going to be fruitful or not.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lfpp1we" class="commentText"><p>Super off topic, but if you ever get the chance to watch an eclipse, do it. A total eclipse was in my area in April, and seeing it in real life is entirely different to seeing pictures of it.</p>

<p>Pictures don’t capture the way the daytime air feels in the dark, or quite how amazing it is to see a black circle in the sky where the sun should be. We were able to look straight at it for about a minute and a half, and it was one of the coolest things I’ve ever seen.</p>

      <label for="lfp80uj" class="commentText"><p>His biggest thing is he changes the way they play. Theh went from a open court fast break team because they had two guards who could turn teams over and a good overall defense so they got a lot of fast breaks. Lonzo was one of the best fast break players in the game and lavine and demar were athletic wings playing off him with vooch trailing. Losing lonzo killed their defense which led to much less fast breaks a slower pace and havign to become a half court team without a playmaker.</p>

I think Vuc&rsquo;s defense would have been too much to overcome in a playoff, but who knows what would have happened if there was a proof of concept run where that was made apparent? They could have made moves instead of being in limbo, and maybe pushed themselves up a notch.</p>

That first stretch of the season is what kept them out of the play-in in 2022 (ended up falling to the 6 seed) but not having him in the lineup at any point in the past two years is why they were firmly play-in fodder during that time.</p>

      <label for="lfp7mq0" class="commentText"><p>Sure but they were highly unlikely to maintain that pace even with him. You need stars to meaningfully compete. The Bulls had two fringe all stars. That isn’t close to good enough. So I don’t care if we should’ve been racking up 5 or 6 seeds with Lonzo the premise this core was built around was fundamentally flawed and management seems uninterested in finding an actual star now</p>

      <label for="lfp99o3" class="commentText"><p>The people to blame are the Reisndorfs, GarPax, and AKME.</p>

<p>Ineptitude set this organization back. Focusing on ticket sales rather than building a good team.</p>

<p>We gave Lauri away for DJJ and a pick that won&rsquo;t convert.</p>

<p>We traded for Vooch and gave up two first round picks and a young player in WCJ. And we decided to extend the best brick player in Chicago rather than trade him, because he played all 82 games in a sunk cost value frustrating move.</p>

<p>We gave up a first and some seconds to get DeMar. DeMar has been nothing but a pro and a good locker room presence but his playstyle isn&rsquo;t conducive to winning in the playoffs in the current NBA. He&rsquo;ll raise the floor of a team no doubt. I hope he does well in Sac Town, but we were limited with him on both sides of the ball.</p>

<p>We gave Billy a secret extension, we gave ME a secret extension, we gave AK an extension for what? Making the fucking play in and winning <strong>ONE GAME</strong> in the playoffs all these years.</p>

<p>Billy has been a serviceable coach and deferred too often to DeMar and Vooch. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s the kind of coach that&rsquo;ll bring you great playoff success. He&rsquo;s been a solid defensive coach with 3 limited defensive players. Yet it feels like he hasn&rsquo;t gotten the best out of the roster at various times. Not that many would do better, I just tire of his rotation and decision making often.</p>

<p>We kept signing bargain bin players, letting good young players go for every little, not trading valuable vets soon enough, and we still maintain  <strong>C O N T I N U I T Y.</strong></p>

<p>Zach is flawed but it isn&rsquo;t his fault. Him, DeMar, and Vooch didn&rsquo;t mesh well on offense and especially on defense. All those times we saw Zach look like an All Star we know what he can do. Yeah he&rsquo;s been hurt, but he&rsquo;s played through injuries, he&rsquo;s been the go to guy on a team devoid of talent.</p>

<p>Lonzo made this thing work, but there&rsquo;s a saying if one player that isn&rsquo;t a star goes down and your team sucks, your team sucked to begin with.</p>

<p>As a Bulls fan I&rsquo;m frustrated for Zach I&rsquo;m hoping he balls out and we trade him for something of value. The new CBA is not going to make it easy. Wherever he goes next I hope he shuts the critics up en masse.</p>

<p><strong>LaVine knew the Bulls had engaged in trade conversations last summer</strong>, so through his representation at Klutch Sports, he let the organization know he was open to the two sides working together to find a new destination. <strong>It was short of a full trade request, but it still irked Karnisovas, sources told ESPN, a slight perceived as LaVine not being committed to sticking with the team.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But… <em>you were already trying to trade him.</em></p>

<p>It sounds like Zach was the one that was trying to keep it professional and the Bulls front office is trying to, after the fact, put their own failures on him.</p>

Ever since Krause left the Bulls have been truly a terribly run org. It all falls on ownership, Reinsdorf has allowed cancerous tumors to pop up on every single team he owns. He just doesn&rsquo;t care anymore. They need a complete fire bombing of anything in the Bulls FO. I&rsquo;d burn down the house to the hinges, if not more. I don&rsquo;t think anyone knows for sure how to build a winning team, all I know is that the Bulls never will be one as they are currently run.</p>

<p>The Bulls are obviously not a good team, but if there are a lot of teams worse then they aren&rsquo;t a bad team either. To me, the Bulls are still a play-in team until Zach is gone which means we risk losing the pick</p>

If we don’t keep it that means we’re not that bad and have something to build on because like I said 80% of our rotation will be under 25 vs 30+ like last last year</p>

But the way the lottery works &amp; how bottom of the barrel a handful of NBA teams are, it’ll be kind of hard for the Bulls to be absolute dogshit, when they have such a deep bench. I think they’ll start being liberal with their trades come January, unless they’re in the top 4(highly unlikely, but crazy things happen sometimes.)</p>

<p>LaVine knew the Bulls had engaged in trade conversations last summer, so through his representation at Klutch Sports, he let the organization know he was open to the two sides working together to find a new destination. It was short of a full trade request, but it still irked Karnisovas, sources told ESPN, a slight perceived as LaVine not being committed to sticking with the team.</p>

      <label for="lfo18ix" class="commentText"><p>Zach&rsquo;s main fault in his career is having any faith in this organization. He should&rsquo;ve asked to be traded ages ago. Generally, he&rsquo;s been way too professional over how terrible this team is. He wanted to win here when the best point guard he&rsquo;s ever played with has been 41 games of Lonzo, and Caruso, who comes off the bench. Behind that it&rsquo;s Coby White before his MIP year and Tomas Satoranski.</p>

<p>Not surprised now that we&rsquo;re past the point of no return, he&rsquo;d be framed differently despite years of professional. It doesn&rsquo;t get you anything, sometimes guys gotta just be KD.</p>

      <label for="lfo9vn5" class="commentText"><p>3 years on a max is too much for any team to trade for unless super desperate. 2 years on a max (or 2.5 at the trade deadline) is only doable if Zach is healthy and producing at a borderline All-Star level. Otherwise he will likely have no trade interest until 1-1.5 years left on his contract assuming he&rsquo;s still somewhat productive.</p>

The suns went from a team hoping to win a title to a team that got swept in the 1st round with all of their stars playing. &amp; since he also has a no trade clause, they also can&rsquo;t get rid of him. Their stars aren&rsquo;t capable of carrying the team to success &amp; they don&rsquo;t have enough money left over to sign better role players.</p>

<p>LaVine knew the Bulls had engaged in trade conversations last summer, so through his representation at Klutch Sports, he let the organization know he was open to the two sides working together to find a new destination. It was short of a full trade request, but it still irked Karnisovas, sources told ESPN, a slight perceived as LaVine not being committed to sticking with the team.</p>

<p>That framing sounds like it&rsquo;s probably misleading, but without more knowledge it makes AK look terrible. You&rsquo;re mad the player you tried to trade is open to a trade?</p>

      <label for="lfq68y0" class="commentText"><p>Zach has his faults, but he’s actually a super hard-working player who overcame an ACL tear and built himself from a slasher into one of the better offensive SG’s in the league. He maxed out most of his potential and was underpaid for years vs his actual output. As a player, he did what he had to do, and has been a professional about it the whole time. The two things that have held him back are injuries and a poorly run org, neither of which are something he can control.</p>

      <label for="lfo2lm1" class="commentText"><p>Zach and Billy are gonna be what we need to watch. I think Zach in a vacuum will be a good trooper and play like someone who has a lot to prove and will relish being the #1 option again in Chicago but that still may not be in a way that&rsquo;s conducive to team success, although it is VERY overstated how he&rsquo;s somehow a negative player, when the data does not back that up. That being said, I don&rsquo;t know if Zach and Billy and their relationship is reparable.</p>

<p>DeMar/Zach/Vooch didn&rsquo;t work, but Zach independently is not a negative player and his shotmaking is something any team could use.</p>

<p>As far as the front office&rsquo;s brainstorming/plans are concerned the Giddey deal kinda signaled they weren&rsquo;t interested in a complete tank job. I&rsquo;m sure even with Caruso&rsquo;s value being a bit lower than it otherwise would&rsquo;ve been in-season that they could&rsquo;ve gotten a different deal elsewhere and they went with the Thunder because of Giddey. They clearly must believe strongly in Giddey&rsquo;s abilities outside of OKC and really being handed playmaking keys.</p>

<p>The Bulls have been reluctant to go the full tear down route even after it has become clear the last few years that their ceiling with the past core was play-in. Yet they&rsquo;ve also been unwilling to really go all-in on competitiveness (ie. unwilling to pay luxury tax) so the direction is a bit head scratching.</p>
