      <label for="lkefrsu" class="commentText"><p>It also seems that Shaq is straight up lying about Terry Catledge being traded, I cannot find anywhere that he was traded.</p>

<p>His role was significantly reduced in Shaq&rsquo;s rookie season, but no mention of trade.</p>

<p>Not on <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/catlete01.html" target="_blank">BBref</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Catledge" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>He continued playing abroad.</p>

<p>The Magic wanted to trade him, but they couldn&rsquo;t. He got bougthout at the end.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tampabay.com/archive/1993/10/15/magic-seeks-buyout-of-forward-catledge/" target="_blank">Here</a> is an article from 1993 (Tampa Bay Times) - the beginning of it - October 15th, 1993 - after Shaq&rsquo;s rookie season, and was updated in 2005:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Terry Catledge once was deemed the cornerstone of the Orlando Magic.</p>

<p>Now, just when the team appears poised to turn the corner, the Magic is working on a deal to buy out the remainder of the forward&rsquo;s multiyear, multimillion-dollar contract and release him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not done yet; we&rsquo;re working on it, and we&rsquo;ll see what tomorrow brings,&rdquo; Magic general manager Pat Williams said Thursday. &ldquo;Terry has not been happy. He wants to start fresh somewhere if he can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Williams said he was unable to trade Catledge, who was to make <span class="math inline">\(1.3-million this season, the fourth year of a six-year contract. He reportedly would accept a \)</span>4-million buyout.</p>

<p>Williams said he had hoped Catledge, 30, could recapture his past form and help the Magic to its first playoff appearance.</p>

      <label for="lkfob2n" class="commentText"><p>No I think he was just doing a very poor job of explaining himself. From him bringing up how bad it must feel for Kenny to fill up with <span class="math inline">\(80 every week, I THINK he’s trying to say that it’s less painful to fill up \)</span>20 four times than <span class="math inline">\(80 1 time. Of course everyone lets the \)</span>20 go on for longer than it should but that’s just a small mental math not thinking error. The second someone mentions that it would be <span class="math inline">\(40 for half he doesn’t say \)</span>20 for half again. Then he says “If the tank is half full and you put $20 what would it be at?” And for some reason Kenny says 1/4th (not understanding the question presumably) while Shaq says it’s 3/4ths. It seems he understands perfectly fine he just can’t explain his point if his life was on the line. That’s why Shaq wasn’t a good leader. Hilarious clip though.</p>

<p>Also plenty of people talk the way Shaq does about other players around the league. I feel like people just think because he’s a legend talking down on other people means it packs more of a punch but he doesn’t affect these players careers or livelihood more than Max Kellerman. Kenny has bad takes on a bunch of players but people just say “shut up Kenny you weren’t half as good” and call it a day. Because people can’t say Shaq wasn’t half as good they think it’s bullying. But the solution there is “shut up Shaq that’s stupid”</p>

<p>Most NBA players have an ego, usually a huge one, that’s a problem in most franchises. I don’t see how Shaq is worse than say, Michael “I took that personally” Jordan? Lies, the way Scottie was treated during the run?</p>

<p>Of course I’m not insinuating that if Shaq is Trump-Lite then Jordan is Trump original. I’m saying, these are basketball player, and opinion-havers, not racist bigots that are running for leadership positions in our government in an effort to secure power while destroying our judicial system and trying to destroy our democracy. I just think it’s a little intense of a descriptor.</p>

<p>If you wanna say Shaq is rude and mean go for it but stick to reality please.</p>

<p>LOL</p>

<p>I understand that Shaq mentions the psychological side of things. But Shaq also very literally thinks he is saving Kenny money overall.</p>

<hr>

<p>The opening lines establish that the tank is <span class="math inline">\(80 and Shaq says that once Kenny is at half, then \)</span>20 <strong>&ldquo;brings it up to full</strong>.&rdquo; Kenny pushes back that all this does is make him stop more often for fuel and he still ends up spending the same. Shaq says &ldquo;no you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Smith: Cuz I told how I didn&rsquo;t want to get a certain vehicle because of the gas I would have to spend. It <strong>would cost $80 to fill it up</strong> and he said&hellip;</p>

<p>Shaq: When it gets to half, then you put $20. <strong>You bring it back to full</strong>.</p>

<p>Smith: <strong>But I would have to stop more often and still spend $80</strong>.</p>

<p>Shaq: <strong>No you wouldn’t</strong>, no you wouldn’t.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>And another quote at 1:13 in this video, THIS IS EVEN MORE CLEAR that Shaq very literally thinks that less money <strong>overall</strong> is being spent if you use his strategy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shaq: If you let it get to zero Monday through Friday, then you have to pay <span class="math inline">\(80 to fill it back up. But if you let it get to **half by Wednesday**, then **you pay \)</span>20 and it goes back to full**.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smith: But Wednesday it will be <span class="math inline">\(40 and by Friday it will be \)</span>40 again.</p>

<p>Shaq: Not <span class="math inline">\(40, \)</span>20.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shaq thinks that someone who goes through a full tank of gas between Monday and Friday (therefore spending <span class="math inline">\(80 every Friday) can simply fill up with \)</span>20 each Wednesday &amp; Friday with an end result of spending less money than the first strategy.</p>

<p>He then obfuscates the whole thing by going off on a tangent about Kenny not needing to put gas often anyway.</p>

<p>It also seems that Shaq is straight up lying about Terry Catledge being traded, I cannot find anywhere that he was traded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, but from Shaq&rsquo;s perspective I really don&rsquo;t think it makes any difference if he was actually traded vs. being bought out/waived. (Especially as a rookie player.) Calling it a &ldquo;lie&rdquo; seems like a stretch.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see a trade but Terry did disappear in the middle of Shaq&rsquo;s rookie year and stopped playing for the team right before the All-Star break/trade deadline.</p>

<p>So maybe Shaq is right but instead of a trade it was a cut?</p>

      <label for="lke827m" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, everyone knows that was his reasoning.  He is well known for having been excessive in that regard even outside the 2004 debacle.  Jalen Rose has gone on at least one legendary and very personal rant about it.</p>

<p>In truth, bron was definitely not the Christian Laettner of that team.  First, the 2004 roster was not even remotely close to a dream team level roster.  Second, Bron had just finished his rookie season, so he was essentially a second year player at that point whereas Laettner hadn&rsquo;t played a single minute in the NBA as of the 92 games.   Bron&rsquo;s rookie season was also more than enough proof that he was a different level of player capable of facilitating an offensive scheme and defending at a high level with very little help in his rookie season compared to RJ the glorified 3rd year role player benefiting from kidd running the offense.  Don&rsquo;t forget dwade and melo were also on that team.  If you wanna pick a Laettner, it&rsquo;s one or both of those guys.  It can&rsquo;t be all three.  The writing was on the wall, and Brown chose not to adapt so team USA lost.</p>

      <label for="lkeofet" class="commentText"><p>Yeah, I agree.  To me, having such a young team overall in 2004 made it feel like they were seeing how far they could dial it back towards the pre-92 style amateur teams while hoping to remain dominant with minimal veteran talent invested.  I think it could have worked, and looking back, it definitely seems like an organizational problem.  Reporting on how it was addressed by USA basketball after the 2004 games supports that.</p>

      <label for="lkda2h6" class="commentText"><p>Skiles wore 4 pretty much his whole career and Shaq wore 33 at LSU. Not sure if the story about getting him released is true but he probably just mixed up who had 33. Especially if he told the Skiles version with that detail about being traded since Skiles played 2 seasons with Shaq</p>
