      <label for="lcvzzsj" class="commentText"><p>The average height of NBA players doesn&rsquo;t suggest any smallball, well there is a decline lately (with an overall arc over the last 50 years let&rsquo;s say, 1987 being peak) but it&rsquo;s really a fraction of an inch at most over a career, which doesn&rsquo;t have that kind of an effect.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s more about the league getting skillier than getting smaller.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take Jokić as example. He definitely had a strikingly different role as a rookie than now. It&rsquo;s just not how people define &ldquo;positions&rdquo; in the ever fixated on words and tradition NBA culture so he was center and is center, all the same. But thanks to that Denver can afford to play a 6-10 tall, 9 feet standing reach &ldquo;small forward&rdquo; who is mostly good at shooting and not really at the &ldquo;big man&rdquo; things. But if you defined positions differently, you could say a lot of players changed their positions in other ways.</p>

This is just Reddit commenters becoming too bored with another word and just deciding that they are too smart not to have their own meaning. Small ball generally means&hellip; smaller. It&rsquo;s just not really becoming some NBA standard, it&rsquo;s a variant of a team&rsquo;s play that they can use more or less frequently.</p>

      <label for="lcw54pr" class="commentText"><p>There’s no set definition of smallball, it’s a trend towards a new way of playing lmao</p>

<p>As 3s become more emphasized, teams have been putting players who shoot them well in lineups together more frequently. Those players have just historically been smaller. But increasingly recently, smallball means more that players of all sizes are becoming more perimeter-focused, stretch 5s and outside-shooting wings are becoming more desirable, and game plans have become more focused on 3s</p>

<p>None of that means the overall roster has or will get significantly smaller. It’ll get bigger if anything because bigger, switchable players who can shoot at every position become more valuable as 3s get more emphasized, but average NBA height has remained in roughly the same area since the early 80s</p>

      <label for="lcw8t7b" class="commentText"><p>Larry Johnson sort of, given that he was always a kind of tweener. But he was definitely used as a PF earlier in his career next to centers and small forwards. He became an SF when he went to the Knicks, who had a larger, beefier lineup. He is listed as a PF toward the end of his career, but he was still starting a significant portion of the time next to a C and Kurt Thomas, who was also listed as a PF (and definitely not a SF). He started out being strong enough to take on PFs and quick enough to beat them. But injuries forced him to rely on shooting, so he was used on the wing more.</p>

      <label for="lcw54m2" class="commentText"><p>Dragić was never really a shooting guard in his career.
