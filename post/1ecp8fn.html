</a>
    </h2>

    
    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/40591644/how-nba-got-business-african-dictator" target="_blank">Source: https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/40591644/how-nba-got-business-african-dictator</a></p>

<p>Highly recommend reading the entire article, as there are some <em>really</em> damning things mentioned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ESPN examined the partnership for more than a year, interviewing NBA executives and coaches, Rwandan officials and opposition figures, U.S. government sources, human rights experts and investors in the NBA&rsquo;s Africa business &ndash; valued at nearly $1 billion as of 2021. ESPN also reviewed U.S. and international human rights reports and traveled twice to Rwanda.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Paul Kagame</strong>, a former rebel general credited with stopping one of the worst atrocities in modern history but who for years had been assailed as a dictator who smothers opposition through arrests, disappearances and killings, was looking to forge a partnership that would boost Rwanda&rsquo;s economy and, critics say, distract the world from his human rights record.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to host an NBA game here someday,&rdquo; Kagame mused, describing to Silver his ideas for renovating Rwanda&rsquo;s Petit Stade, the &ldquo;Little Stadium.&rdquo; Silver&rsquo;s deputy, Mark Tatum, was there, too, as was Toronto Raptors president Masai Ujiri, who counted Kagame as a &ldquo;dear friend.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>Just one year later, as only a leader with total control of his country can do, Kagame christened a $104 million arena down the road from Petit Stade. The project was central to launching the now 4-year-old Basketball Africa League, and it cemented a dissonant international partnership that requires Silver and his league to look past injustices far worse than those they actively oppose at home, while helping Kagame burnish his image around the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>The examination reveals the tensions navigated by the NBA and other sports organizations that align with authoritarian governments such as Kagame&rsquo;s: The leagues find a streamlined path to global expansion, but one littered with ongoing human rights abuses &ndash; and the risks of appearing to help obscure them.</p>

<p>The U.S. State Department repeatedly has cited credible reports that Kagame&rsquo;s government is responsible for human rights violations ranging from the imprisonment, torture and murder of political opponents to the funding of child soldiers in the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is, and has been for decades, a Putin-style dictator,&rdquo; Elizabeth Shackelford, a former U.S. diplomat who spent more than a decade in Africa, tells ESPN. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like for the NBA to explain to us why it&rsquo;s OK partnering with someone who individually created this kind of suffering, both in his country and beyond.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Clare Akamanzi</strong>, chief executive of the Rwanda Development Board when ESPN interviewed her in Kigali last year, calls Kagame a &ldquo;get-things-done kind of leader.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think what has been very clear for Rwanda&rsquo;s story is that leadership matters,&rdquo; Akamanzi says. &ldquo;He always has a plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The development board, which played a critical role in the creation of the arena, is one of the most powerful entities in Rwanda, after Kagame himself. Before Akamanzi ran it, she was Kagame&rsquo;s top strategist.</p>

<p>But several months after she spoke with ESPN, Akamanzi landed a new job: CEO of NBA Africa, the formal enterprise that oversees all NBA interests on the continent.</p>

<p>In announcing Akamanzi&rsquo;s hiring, Tatum called her &ldquo;the ideal executive to lead our business in Africa.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Victoire Ingabire</strong> sits on her couch in the living room of her Kigali home, legs crossed and hands in her lap. She&rsquo;s calmly explaining the ways in which she has become a nonperson.</p>

<p>Ingabire&rsquo;s children and her husband of 35 years live in Europe, but she can&rsquo;t visit them. She is barred by the Kagame government from leaving Rwanda. She hasn&rsquo;t seen her husband in the Netherlands in nearly 15 years, and he has been, she says, &ldquo;very sick&rdquo; for the past several. She hasn&rsquo;t seen her middle child, Remy, now married with two kids and living in Sweden, since 2010. He was 15 then. Ingabire, 55, says she asked for government permission to attend his wedding in Sweden two years ago, but after receiving no response, she was left to watch the vows on her laptop.</p>

<p>Ingabire is an opposition leader in a country with very little opposition. She was banned from running against Kagame in the recent presidential election; she can&rsquo;t even hold a political meeting.</p>

<p>In 2010, Ingabire was living in the Netherlands and leading a political party in exile when she decided to return home and run for president against Kagame. She told her youngest son, Rist, that she&rsquo;d return to the Netherlands in time for his 8th birthday. She hasn&rsquo;t been back since.</p>

<p>Ingabire was arrested before the 2010 election, then released but forbidden from campaigning. She was arrested again after Kagame&rsquo;s victory and ultimately was sentenced to 15 years in prison for minimizing the 1994 Rwandan genocide, inciting people to revolt and organizing armed groups against the government. She denied the allegations, and human rights organizations condemned her case as politically motivated. In 2018, Kagame pardoned Ingabire after eight years in prison. Five of those, she says, were served in solitary confinement.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>But Ingabire says the NBA should leverage its influence by working with the U.S. government to &ldquo;push the Rwanda government to open up political space and to respect the rule of law and to let the opposition work in Rwanda, as everywhere else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When asked whether she fears what the government might do to her for continuing to speak out, <strong>Ingabire begins to methodically list a number of colleagues she says have been arrested, killed or disappeared since 2016:</strong></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s Boniface Twagirimana, her former deputy and a father of two, arrested then disappeared while being transferred between prisons. And Anselme Mutuyimana, her 30-year-old assistant, kidnapped from a bus station, his body found the next day. And Eugene Ndereyimana, a 29-year-old father of two with another on the way, missing since 2019. And Iragena Illumine, a nurse in her early 30s and mother of four, missing since she vanished on her way to work. And Syldio Dusabumuremyi, national party coordinator and father of two, stabbed to death. And Venant Abayisenga, a 30-year-old aide, missing since he left home one day in 2020.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they will arrest me, they will arrest me,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I will go there.&rdquo; She almost laughs expectantly at the thought of returning to prison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they will assassinate me, I will be assassinated. But I have to go ahead with my struggle.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>IN LATE AUGUST 2020, <strong>Paul Rusesabagina</strong> boarded a private plane in Dubai, believing he was headed for a speaking engagement in Burundi, a small country about the same size as Rwanda which borders it to the south. Rusesabagina had once been a heroic figure in his native Rwanda, lauded for helping save more than 1,000 potential genocide victims by sheltering them in the Kigali hotel he managed in 1994. President George W. Bush awarded him the Medal of Freedom in 2005, the year after Don Cheadle made Rusesabagina famous by portraying him in the Oscar-nominated film &ldquo;Hotel Rwanda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But by 2020, Rusesabagina was a wanted man in Rwanda. He had become a leading Kagame critic in exile and, concerned for the safety of his children, had moved to the United States and settled in San Antonio. When he boarded the plane in Dubai, he had no plans to return to his homeland. But as the private jet began its descent, Rusesabagina realized he had been tricked. He was being brought to Kigali and dropped into Kagame&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>Rusesabagina was arrested and accused of terrorism for his alleged support of an armed opposition group. He would later say in court that although he helped form the group to assist refugees, he didn&rsquo;t advocate violence and was focused on diplomacy. Human rights organizations called the arrest politically motivated and demanded his release.</p>

<p>Two and a half weeks after Rusesabagina was taken, <strong>San Antonio Spurs executive R.C. Buford</strong> received an email from a Rusesabagina family lawyer, asking whether the NBA might help. The lawyer had heard Kagame was a big NBA fan and wondered if Buford could explore whether &ldquo;Adam Silver and [Raptors president] Masai Ujiri may feel compelled to assist&rdquo; in a &ldquo;deepening humanitarian issue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About 90 minutes later, Buford responded: &ldquo;President Kagame and <strong>Masai Ujuri</strong> [sic] are very close. If this is a state-led initiative, then Masai will be aligned with Kagame. He&rsquo;s probably not going to lobby against Kagame and Adam Silver only knows Kagame through Masai. I don&rsquo;t know this will be [an] effective connection.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>In September 2021, Rusesabagina was found guilty and sentenced to 25 years in prison for what a government spokesperson described as &ldquo;the terrorist activities&rdquo; of a group led by Rusesabagina. The spokesperson added, &ldquo;The people of Rwanda will feel safer now justice has been delivered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Human rights groups and Rusesabagina&rsquo;s family continued to press the U.S. government to get involved. Cheadle joined a public campaign calling for Rusesabagina&rsquo;s release and recruited his golfing buddy, Milwaukee Bucks coach Doc Rivers. Rivers, then coaching the 76ers, posted on Instagram with a picture of himself wearing a &ldquo;FREE RUSESABAGINA&rdquo; T-shirt and wrote that Rusesabagina was &ldquo;kidnapped, given a sham trial, and is now unlawfully jailed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rivers also contacted the league office to see whether the NBA would take a position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We heard from Doc,&rdquo; Tatum says. &ldquo;We said that it&rsquo;s the role of the U.S. government and the State Department to have those negotiations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were in a tough spot,&rdquo; Rivers tells ESPN, adding that he appreciated the league giving players and coaches the freedom to speak out.</p>

<p>In May 2022, the U.S. State Department designated Rusesabagina &ldquo;wrongfully detained,&rdquo; the same designation it gave WNBA star Brittney Griner after her 2022 arrest in Russia. After negotiations between the two governments, Rusesabagina was freed in March 2023. He had spent more than 30 months in prison. In &ldquo;Forbidden Stories - Rwanda Classified,&rdquo; he said he had been tortured daily and held in solitary confinement.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>Ujiri, meanwhile, says he recalled some discussions about what impact it might have on the BAL if the league took a position on Rusesabagina&rsquo;s arrest and imprisonment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what ended up happening,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;For me, honestly, I feel these things are separate from sports. &hellip; My focus was to get the BAL off the ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ujiri likes to say he will measure his life&rsquo;s success not through NBA titles but through his efforts to help Africa. During a nearly 90-minute interview in his office at the Raptors&rsquo; practice facility, Ujiri repeats several times a phrase that sounds like a mantra: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m selfish for the continent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the 2016 All-Star Game in Toronto, he knew Kagame well and invited the Rwandan president to be his guest. Kagame watched the game from a VIP suite.</p>

<p>Three years later, and one year after Silver&rsquo;s visit to Kigali, Rwanda&rsquo;s new arena opened. It came with plans to add a sports and entertainment complex that happened to align with one of Ujiri&rsquo;s other business interests &ndash; a development company focused on Africa.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2021, soon after the BAL hosted its first games in Kigali, Kagame signed a presidential order granting Ujiri 6 acres adjacent to the arena. The property was worth an estimated $5 million.</p>

<p>Ujiri&rsquo;s company would oversee a development project that includes an 80-room hotel, restaurants, a rooftop lounge, a gym, a podcast studio, and a multipurpose field for events and open markets &ndash; the type of sports and entertainment complex he, Silver and Tatum discussed with Kagame in 2018.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I fear no one. I&rsquo;ve done nothing wrong. Zero, zero, zero. In everything I&rsquo;ve done, I&rsquo;ve done no bad business in this world, so I can walk anywhere in the world with my head high.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Last August, Ujiri and Kagame were together for a groundbreaking ceremony for the new entertainment complex in Kigali, to be named Zaria Court, after Ujiri&rsquo;s hometown in Nigeria.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to commend you, Your Excellency, for how people do business here,&rdquo; Ujiri told Kagame during the event. &ldquo;It is first class. &hellip; It&rsquo;s always, &lsquo;How do we solve the problem?&rsquo; which is how things are supposed to be done in this world.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>During an event at BK Arena last year, Ujiri culminated an emotional speech by introducing Kagame as a &ldquo;dear friend, a mentor, an inspiration, an incredible leader in Africa, an example, an example that this continent needs! &hellip; I love you, President Kagame! You are a friend. You are unbelievable!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>KAGAME HAS BEEN Rwanda&rsquo;s president since 2000, but he has been its leader since 1994, when, as the Tutsi commander of the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front, he was credited with ending a genocide unleashed by Hutu militias. In a country the size of Maryland, some 800,000 people were killed. Neighbors killed neighbors. Friends killed friends. Family members killed family members. Many victims were hacked to death with machetes.</p>

<p>As news of the horrors spilled beyond Rwanda, the West largely failed to respond. The result, experts say, has been a dynamic that Kagame has seized on for decades.</p>

<p>Since 2000, Kagame has run for reelection four times, each time receiving more than 93% of the vote. Earlier this month, he captured 99% of votes cast. By comparison, in an election deemed a sham, Vladimir Putin was reelected Russia&rsquo;s president in March with 87% of the vote.</p>

<p>A 2015 constitutional referendum, which passed with 98% support, allowed Kagame to extend his rule beyond two terms. With his recent reelection, he could stay in power until 2034 &ndash; putting him in control of the country for essentially 40 years.</p>

<p>In addition to election manipulation, allegations of human rights abuses have piled up as Kagame&rsquo;s grip on the country has tightened. Freedom House produces annual reports that define countries as &ldquo;Free,&rdquo; &ldquo;Partly Free&rdquo; and &ldquo;Not Free.&rdquo; For each of the 24 years of Kagame&rsquo;s presidency, Rwanda has been designated &ldquo;Not Free.&rdquo; The organization also cites Rwanda as one of the world&rsquo;s most prolific perpetrators of transnational repression &ndash; a term used to describe governments that kill, injure or intimidate across borders to stifle dissent.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>The report published two months before the NBA&rsquo;s new Africa league tipped off in Kigali in 2021 began: &ldquo;Significant human rights issues included: unlawful or arbitrary killings by the government; forced disappearance by the government; torture by the government; harsh and life-threatening conditions in some detention facilities; arbitrary detention; political prisoners or detainees; politically motivated reprisal against individuals located outside the country; arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; serious restrictions on free expression, press, and the internet, including threats of violence against journalists, censorship, and website blocking; substantial interference with the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of association, such as overly restrictive nongovernmental organization laws; and restrictions on political participation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>IN MAY 2021, one week after the BAL had launched, Silver held a Zoom news conference during which he proclaimed: &ldquo;We today value this new Africa entity at nearly $1 billion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day, a letter addressed to the commissioner arrived at the NBA offices in New York. It was from the Human Rights Foundation, expressing &ldquo;grave concern&rdquo; about the league&rsquo;s budding relationship with Kagame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Given your stated values, we believe that you have the responsibility not to be in league with Kagame and his government,&rdquo; wrote HRF president Thor Halvorssen. He called on the NBA to &ldquo;host future BAL seasons in countries not ruled by murderous warlords&rdquo; and to &ldquo;reevaluate the NBA&rsquo;s relationship with Kagame.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>More recently, using artificial intelligence tools, Kagame supporters employed &ldquo;a vast network of pro-government social media accounts&rdquo; to promote the state, harass journalists and stimulate discussion about events like the BAL, according to a study by Clemson University&rsquo;s Media Forensics Hub. In a report titled, &ldquo;Old Despots, New Tricks,&rdquo; researchers identified 464 accounts on X that produced hundreds of thousands of AI-generated messages in a &ldquo;coordinated and centralized&rdquo; effort to attack the &ldquo;Rwanda Classified&rdquo; investigative report and redirect the conversation to more positive material, such as the BAL.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A number of these [accounts] used the Basketball in Africa League, which was happening around the same time as the [&ldquo;Rwanda Classified&rdquo;] report was released, as sort of a distraction, flooding any mentions of Rwanda, of Kagame with pictures of basketball players playing in Kigali, discussion of the teams,&rdquo; said assistant research professor Morgan Wack, a co-author of the report. &ldquo;And a lot of these are short statements that were fed through ChatGPT.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Schwartz, the Freedom House consultant, says the NBA Africa deal &ldquo;does that PR whitewashing that Rwanda is looking for in the international community.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>The NBA is not new to the reality that going global in some places means partnering with governments that flout the types of issues players and the league often have championed at home. In 2019, a mere tweet from then-Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey in support of Hong Kong independence sparked a TV and advertising boycott in China that cost the NBA hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

<p>Later, ESPN reported that Chinese coaches at NBA training academies had been physically abusing young players, prompting the NBA to reevaluate its program and shutter an academy in western China, where the government was accused of committing human rights abuses against more than 1 million Uyghur Muslims.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>BACK AT THE HOME of Victoire Ingabire, the Rwandan opposition figure reiterates that she understands and even supports the idea of the BAL. Still, she&rsquo;s concerned that fans and the media won&rsquo;t really get it; that basketball will wash away the government&rsquo;s human rights abuses and people will think, as Tatum says, &ldquo;Rwanda works.&rdquo; Visitors to Rwanda largely see two things: its sparkling, efficient capital and the country&rsquo;s famous mountain gorillas, which attract the bulk of tourism dollars.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>She says if the NBA truly wants to make a difference in her country, it would pressure Kagame &ldquo;about the lack of the democracy, the problem of the people who are in prison for nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Shackelford, the former U.S. diplomat who&rsquo;s now a foreign policy analyst, says such pressure would never work.</p>

<p>If the NBA tried to speak with Kagame about human rights abuses, &ldquo;I think [he would] just kick them out,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I imagine that the NBA is high-enough profile that they probably wouldn&rsquo;t disappear somebody from a hotel room. But he wouldn&rsquo;t tolerate it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>Shackelford says the league&rsquo;s position that it is helping Rwandans is misguided. If she had an audience with Silver, she says, &ldquo;I would tell him any organization that is aware, as he must be, that President Kagame ruthlessly represses any opposition, any civil society movements that want better for their country &hellip; anyone who tries to burnish that image and participates in a project that helps him look good is, in some ways, complicit in the harms that that does to the Rwandan people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So if it&rsquo;s just about money and a shiny stadium, I get it. But he&rsquo;s kidding himself if he doesn&rsquo;t think that they are part of something that is more nefarious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the NBA offices in New York, Tatum is read Shackelford&rsquo;s comments and doesn&rsquo;t hesitate in his response.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s entitled to her opinion,&rdquo; he says, reiterating the encouragement the NBA has received from the State Department.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know that we are positively impacting those Rwandans&rsquo; lives,&rdquo; Tatum says. &ldquo;And we know that by engaging in that market that those people are better off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the end of May, the BAL championships were played for the fourth time in Kagame&rsquo;s BK Arena, and they will be held there two more times in the next four years.</p>

<p>Just a month earlier, on April 22, the U.S. State Department issued its latest report on Rwanda&rsquo;s human rights abuses. It began, as it has for more than a decade:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were no significant changes in the human rights situation in Rwanda during the year.&rdquo;</p>

They’re normally grouped on the right side of the page with like six other stories but every now and then it will be the cover story. I honestly can’t remember the last time I clicked one like this and felt like it was a waste of time.</p>

<p>I understand why stuff like this doesn’t usually float to the top here, but it’s also the reason Grantland tried to do these types of articles for free and ended up folding despite constant claims that people want more of that type of content instead of what we actually share and discuss.</p>

      <label for="lf1vutn" class="commentText"><p>Still a fairly sensationist headline.  Yes they are 100% correct that Rwanda is run dictator who perpetuates human rights abuses. The exact same can be said of Burundi and Uganda, both just next door. Rwanda has actually gotten material results from it though, as fucked up as it is. I&rsquo;ve lived and worked in every country in east Africa and Rwanda is so far ahead of the others it is hard to overstate how well Kagame has done.  So yes, call a spade a spade, but let&rsquo;s not forget the wider context this is happening in (a tiny, agricultural, landlocked nation merely 20 years out of a genocide that is desperate to rebuild government functions and diversify their economy) </p>

      <label for="lf1k0ml" class="commentText"><p>Shackelford is right, IMO. The answer then is whether or not these companies continue to do business in these countries and look the other way on abuses while claiming to be pro-human rights. And the answer is yes&hellip;.consistently. They do business and look the other way consistently.</p>

<p>It is a bit of a tricky situation because I do think there is something to argue to modernization of these nations with backwards laws and not just freezing them out entirely from the modern world. There&rsquo;s something to argue that the presence of the NBA is a net positive. Basketball Africa being a net positive.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really not as easy as just boycotting Africa and the Middle East. I do think your average citizen should. The bigger issue is that they don&rsquo;t give a fuck about the sustenance of these regions, they just want the untapped cash. Adam Silver is no different than the rest in that regard&hellip;he doesn&rsquo;t care about the right thing, he cares about money. Masai is pretty clearly a power hungry guy&hellip;their motivations are not pure, and that&rsquo;s true of 90% of suits.</p>

      <label for="lf1xut6" class="commentText"><p>Not to be a shill for the NBA, but working in Africa likely means working alongside a dictator… it’s just really a fact there. This document on page 20 (<a href="https://planetrulers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/freedom-in-the-world-2022-report-freedom-house.pdf" target="_blank">https://planetrulers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/freedom-in-the-world-2022-report-freedom-house.pdf</a>) shows the majority of Africa as “not free” meaning ruled by a dictator with only ~3 countries noted as “free.”</p>

<p>Sure they certainly could have not done this, but if the nba wants to be in Africa you’re going to have to work with not so great leaders. At that point do you focus on trying to grow your brand and potentially help those people there or just say no to them because their leaders are awful?</p>
