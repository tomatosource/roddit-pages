</a>

    <div class="selfPostContainer">
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/40591644/how-nba-got-business-african-dictator" target="_blank">Source: https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/40591644/how-nba-got-business-african-dictator</a></p>

<p>Highly recommend reading the entire article, as there are some <em>really</em> damning things mentioned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ESPN examined the partnership for more than a year, interviewing NBA executives and coaches, Rwandan officials and opposition figures, U.S. government sources, human rights experts and investors in the NBA&rsquo;s Africa business &ndash; valued at nearly $1 billion as of 2021. ESPN also reviewed U.S. and international human rights reports and traveled twice to Rwanda.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Paul Kagame</strong>, a former rebel general credited with stopping one of the worst atrocities in modern history but who for years had been assailed as a dictator who smothers opposition through arrests, disappearances and killings, was looking to forge a partnership that would boost Rwanda&rsquo;s economy and, critics say, distract the world from his human rights record.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to host an NBA game here someday,&rdquo; Kagame mused, describing to Silver his ideas for renovating Rwanda&rsquo;s Petit Stade, the &ldquo;Little Stadium.&rdquo; Silver&rsquo;s deputy, Mark Tatum, was there, too, as was Toronto Raptors president Masai Ujiri, who counted Kagame as a &ldquo;dear friend.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>Just one year later, as only a leader with total control of his country can do, Kagame christened a $104 million arena down the road from Petit Stade. The project was central to launching the now 4-year-old Basketball Africa League, and it cemented a dissonant international partnership that requires Silver and his league to look past injustices far worse than those they actively oppose at home, while helping Kagame burnish his image around the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>The examination reveals the tensions navigated by the NBA and other sports organizations that align with authoritarian governments such as Kagame&rsquo;s: The leagues find a streamlined path to global expansion, but one littered with ongoing human rights abuses &ndash; and the risks of appearing to help obscure them.</p>

<p>The U.S. State Department repeatedly has cited credible reports that Kagame&rsquo;s government is responsible for human rights violations ranging from the imprisonment, torture and murder of political opponents to the funding of child soldiers in the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is, and has been for decades, a Putin-style dictator,&rdquo; Elizabeth Shackelford, a former U.S. diplomat who spent more than a decade in Africa, tells ESPN. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like for the NBA to explain to us why it&rsquo;s OK partnering with someone who individually created this kind of suffering, both in his country and beyond.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Clare Akamanzi</strong>, chief executive of the Rwanda Development Board when ESPN interviewed her in Kigali last year, calls Kagame a &ldquo;get-things-done kind of leader.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think what has been very clear for Rwanda&rsquo;s story is that leadership matters,&rdquo; Akamanzi says. &ldquo;He always has a plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The development board, which played a critical role in the creation of the arena, is one of the most powerful entities in Rwanda, after Kagame himself. Before Akamanzi ran it, she was Kagame&rsquo;s top strategist.</p>

<p>But several months after she spoke with ESPN, Akamanzi landed a new job: CEO of NBA Africa, the formal enterprise that oversees all NBA interests on the continent.</p>

<p>In announcing Akamanzi&rsquo;s hiring, Tatum called her &ldquo;the ideal executive to lead our business in Africa.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Victoire Ingabire</strong> sits on her couch in the living room of her Kigali home, legs crossed and hands in her lap. She&rsquo;s calmly explaining the ways in which she has become a nonperson.</p>

<p>Ingabire&rsquo;s children and her husband of 35 years live in Europe, but she can&rsquo;t visit them. She is barred by the Kagame government from leaving Rwanda. She hasn&rsquo;t seen her husband in the Netherlands in nearly 15 years, and he has been, she says, &ldquo;very sick&rdquo; for the past several. She hasn&rsquo;t seen her middle child, Remy, now married with two kids and living in Sweden, since 2010. He was 15 then. Ingabire, 55, says she asked for government permission to attend his wedding in Sweden two years ago, but after receiving no response, she was left to watch the vows on her laptop.</p>

<p>Ingabire is an opposition leader in a country with very little opposition. She was banned from running against Kagame in the recent presidential election; she can&rsquo;t even hold a political meeting.</p>

<p>In 2010, Ingabire was living in the Netherlands and leading a political party in exile when she decided to return home and run for president against Kagame. She told her youngest son, Rist, that she&rsquo;d return to the Netherlands in time for his 8th birthday. She hasn&rsquo;t been back since.</p>

<p>Ingabire was arrested before the 2010 election, then released but forbidden from campaigning. She was arrested again after Kagame&rsquo;s victory and ultimately was sentenced to 15 years in prison for minimizing the 1994 Rwandan genocide, inciting people to revolt and organizing armed groups against the government. She denied the allegations, and human rights organizations condemned her case as politically motivated. In 2018, Kagame pardoned Ingabire after eight years in prison. Five of those, she says, were served in solitary confinement.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>But Ingabire says the NBA should leverage its influence by working with the U.S. government to &ldquo;push the Rwanda government to open up political space and to respect the rule of law and to let the opposition work in Rwanda, as everywhere else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When asked whether she fears what the government might do to her for continuing to speak out, <strong>Ingabire begins to methodically list a number of colleagues she says have been arrested, killed or disappeared since 2016:</strong></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s Boniface Twagirimana, her former deputy and a father of two, arrested then disappeared while being transferred between prisons. And Anselme Mutuyimana, her 30-year-old assistant, kidnapped from a bus station, his body found the next day. And Eugene Ndereyimana, a 29-year-old father of two with another on the way, missing since 2019. And Iragena Illumine, a nurse in her early 30s and mother of four, missing since she vanished on her way to work. And Syldio Dusabumuremyi, national party coordinator and father of two, stabbed to death. And Venant Abayisenga, a 30-year-old aide, missing since he left home one day in 2020.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they will arrest me, they will arrest me,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I will go there.&rdquo; She almost laughs expectantly at the thought of returning to prison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they will assassinate me, I will be assassinated. But I have to go ahead with my struggle.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>IN LATE AUGUST 2020, <strong>Paul Rusesabagina</strong> boarded a private plane in Dubai, believing he was headed for a speaking engagement in Burundi, a small country about the same size as Rwanda which borders it to the south. Rusesabagina had once been a heroic figure in his native Rwanda, lauded for helping save more than 1,000 potential genocide victims by sheltering them in the Kigali hotel he managed in 1994. President George W. Bush awarded him the Medal of Freedom in 2005, the year after Don Cheadle made Rusesabagina famous by portraying him in the Oscar-nominated film &ldquo;Hotel Rwanda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But by 2020, Rusesabagina was a wanted man in Rwanda. He had become a leading Kagame critic in exile and, concerned for the safety of his children, had moved to the United States and settled in San Antonio. When he boarded the plane in Dubai, he had no plans to return to his homeland. But as the private jet began its descent, Rusesabagina realized he had been tricked. He was being brought to Kigali and dropped into Kagame&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>Rusesabagina was arrested and accused of terrorism for his alleged support of an armed opposition group. He would later say in court that although he helped form the group to assist refugees, he didn&rsquo;t advocate violence and was focused on diplomacy. Human rights organizations called the arrest politically motivated and demanded his release.</p>

<p>Two and a half weeks after Rusesabagina was taken, <strong>San Antonio Spurs executive R.C. Buford</strong> received an email from a Rusesabagina family lawyer, asking whether the NBA might help. The lawyer had heard Kagame was a big NBA fan and wondered if Buford could explore whether &ldquo;Adam Silver and [Raptors president] Masai Ujiri may feel compelled to assist&rdquo; in a &ldquo;deepening humanitarian issue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About 90 minutes later, Buford responded: &ldquo;President Kagame and <strong>Masai Ujuri</strong> [sic] are very close. If this is a state-led initiative, then Masai will be aligned with Kagame. He&rsquo;s probably not going to lobby against Kagame and Adam Silver only knows Kagame through Masai. I don&rsquo;t know this will be [an] effective connection.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>In September 2021, Rusesabagina was found guilty and sentenced to 25 years in prison for what a government spokesperson described as &ldquo;the terrorist activities&rdquo; of a group led by Rusesabagina. The spokesperson added, &ldquo;The people of Rwanda will feel safer now justice has been delivered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Human rights groups and Rusesabagina&rsquo;s family continued to press the U.S. government to get involved. Cheadle joined a public campaign calling for Rusesabagina&rsquo;s release and recruited his golfing buddy, Milwaukee Bucks coach Doc Rivers. Rivers, then coaching the 76ers, posted on Instagram with a picture of himself wearing a &ldquo;FREE RUSESABAGINA&rdquo; T-shirt and wrote that Rusesabagina was &ldquo;kidnapped, given a sham trial, and is now unlawfully jailed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rivers also contacted the league office to see whether the NBA would take a position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We heard from Doc,&rdquo; Tatum says. &ldquo;We said that it&rsquo;s the role of the U.S. government and the State Department to have those negotiations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were in a tough spot,&rdquo; Rivers tells ESPN, adding that he appreciated the league giving players and coaches the freedom to speak out.</p>

<p>In May 2022, the U.S. State Department designated Rusesabagina &ldquo;wrongfully detained,&rdquo; the same designation it gave WNBA star Brittney Griner after her 2022 arrest in Russia. After negotiations between the two governments, Rusesabagina was freed in March 2023. He had spent more than 30 months in prison. In &ldquo;Forbidden Stories - Rwanda Classified,&rdquo; he said he had been tortured daily and held in solitary confinement.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>Ujiri, meanwhile, says he recalled some discussions about what impact it might have on the BAL if the league took a position on Rusesabagina&rsquo;s arrest and imprisonment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what ended up happening,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;For me, honestly, I feel these things are separate from sports. &hellip; My focus was to get the BAL off the ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ujiri likes to say he will measure his life&rsquo;s success not through NBA titles but through his efforts to help Africa. During a nearly 90-minute interview in his office at the Raptors&rsquo; practice facility, Ujiri repeats several times a phrase that sounds like a mantra: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m selfish for the continent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the 2016 All-Star Game in Toronto, he knew Kagame well and invited the Rwandan president to be his guest. Kagame watched the game from a VIP suite.</p>

<p>Three years later, and one year after Silver&rsquo;s visit to Kigali, Rwanda&rsquo;s new arena opened. It came with plans to add a sports and entertainment complex that happened to align with one of Ujiri&rsquo;s other business interests &ndash; a development company focused on Africa.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2021, soon after the BAL hosted its first games in Kigali, Kagame signed a presidential order granting Ujiri 6 acres adjacent to the arena. The property was worth an estimated $5 million.</p>

<p>Ujiri&rsquo;s company would oversee a development project that includes an 80-room hotel, restaurants, a rooftop lounge, a gym, a podcast studio, and a multipurpose field for events and open markets &ndash; the type of sports and entertainment complex he, Silver and Tatum discussed with Kagame in 2018.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I fear no one. I&rsquo;ve done nothing wrong. Zero, zero, zero. In everything I&rsquo;ve done, I&rsquo;ve done no bad business in this world, so I can walk anywhere in the world with my head high.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Last August, Ujiri and Kagame were together for a groundbreaking ceremony for the new entertainment complex in Kigali, to be named Zaria Court, after Ujiri&rsquo;s hometown in Nigeria.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to commend you, Your Excellency, for how people do business here,&rdquo; Ujiri told Kagame during the event. &ldquo;It is first class. &hellip; It&rsquo;s always, &lsquo;How do we solve the problem?&rsquo; which is how things are supposed to be done in this world.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>During an event at BK Arena last year, Ujiri culminated an emotional speech by introducing Kagame as a &ldquo;dear friend, a mentor, an inspiration, an incredible leader in Africa, an example, an example that this continent needs! &hellip; I love you, President Kagame! You are a friend. You are unbelievable!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>KAGAME HAS BEEN Rwanda&rsquo;s president since 2000, but he has been its leader since 1994, when, as the Tutsi commander of the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front, he was credited with ending a genocide unleashed by Hutu militias. In a country the size of Maryland, some 800,000 people were killed. Neighbors killed neighbors. Friends killed friends. Family members killed family members. Many victims were hacked to death with machetes.</p>

<p>As news of the horrors spilled beyond Rwanda, the West largely failed to respond. The result, experts say, has been a dynamic that Kagame has seized on for decades.</p>

<p>Since 2000, Kagame has run for reelection four times, each time receiving more than 93% of the vote. Earlier this month, he captured 99% of votes cast. By comparison, in an election deemed a sham, Vladimir Putin was reelected Russia&rsquo;s president in March with 87% of the vote.</p>

<p>A 2015 constitutional referendum, which passed with 98% support, allowed Kagame to extend his rule beyond two terms. With his recent reelection, he could stay in power until 2034 &ndash; putting him in control of the country for essentially 40 years.</p>

<p>In addition to election manipulation, allegations of human rights abuses have piled up as Kagame&rsquo;s grip on the country has tightened. Freedom House produces annual reports that define countries as &ldquo;Free,&rdquo; &ldquo;Partly Free&rdquo; and &ldquo;Not Free.&rdquo; For each of the 24 years of Kagame&rsquo;s presidency, Rwanda has been designated &ldquo;Not Free.&rdquo; The organization also cites Rwanda as one of the world&rsquo;s most prolific perpetrators of transnational repression &ndash; a term used to describe governments that kill, injure or intimidate across borders to stifle dissent.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>The report published two months before the NBA&rsquo;s new Africa league tipped off in Kigali in 2021 began: &ldquo;Significant human rights issues included: unlawful or arbitrary killings by the government; forced disappearance by the government; torture by the government; harsh and life-threatening conditions in some detention facilities; arbitrary detention; political prisoners or detainees; politically motivated reprisal against individuals located outside the country; arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; serious restrictions on free expression, press, and the internet, including threats of violence against journalists, censorship, and website blocking; substantial interference with the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of association, such as overly restrictive nongovernmental organization laws; and restrictions on political participation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>IN MAY 2021, one week after the BAL had launched, Silver held a Zoom news conference during which he proclaimed: &ldquo;We today value this new Africa entity at nearly $1 billion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day, a letter addressed to the commissioner arrived at the NBA offices in New York. It was from the Human Rights Foundation, expressing &ldquo;grave concern&rdquo; about the league&rsquo;s budding relationship with Kagame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Given your stated values, we believe that you have the responsibility not to be in league with Kagame and his government,&rdquo; wrote HRF president Thor Halvorssen. He called on the NBA to &ldquo;host future BAL seasons in countries not ruled by murderous warlords&rdquo; and to &ldquo;reevaluate the NBA&rsquo;s relationship with Kagame.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>More recently, using artificial intelligence tools, Kagame supporters employed &ldquo;a vast network of pro-government social media accounts&rdquo; to promote the state, harass journalists and stimulate discussion about events like the BAL, according to a study by Clemson University&rsquo;s Media Forensics Hub. In a report titled, &ldquo;Old Despots, New Tricks,&rdquo; researchers identified 464 accounts on X that produced hundreds of thousands of AI-generated messages in a &ldquo;coordinated and centralized&rdquo; effort to attack the &ldquo;Rwanda Classified&rdquo; investigative report and redirect the conversation to more positive material, such as the BAL.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A number of these [accounts] used the Basketball in Africa League, which was happening around the same time as the [&ldquo;Rwanda Classified&rdquo;] report was released, as sort of a distraction, flooding any mentions of Rwanda, of Kagame with pictures of basketball players playing in Kigali, discussion of the teams,&rdquo; said assistant research professor Morgan Wack, a co-author of the report. &ldquo;And a lot of these are short statements that were fed through ChatGPT.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Schwartz, the Freedom House consultant, says the NBA Africa deal &ldquo;does that PR whitewashing that Rwanda is looking for in the international community.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>The NBA is not new to the reality that going global in some places means partnering with governments that flout the types of issues players and the league often have championed at home. In 2019, a mere tweet from then-Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey in support of Hong Kong independence sparked a TV and advertising boycott in China that cost the NBA hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

<p>Later, ESPN reported that Chinese coaches at NBA training academies had been physically abusing young players, prompting the NBA to reevaluate its program and shutter an academy in western China, where the government was accused of committing human rights abuses against more than 1 million Uyghur Muslims.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>BACK AT THE HOME of Victoire Ingabire, the Rwandan opposition figure reiterates that she understands and even supports the idea of the BAL. Still, she&rsquo;s concerned that fans and the media won&rsquo;t really get it; that basketball will wash away the government&rsquo;s human rights abuses and people will think, as Tatum says, &ldquo;Rwanda works.&rdquo; Visitors to Rwanda largely see two things: its sparkling, efficient capital and the country&rsquo;s famous mountain gorillas, which attract the bulk of tourism dollars.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>She says if the NBA truly wants to make a difference in her country, it would pressure Kagame &ldquo;about the lack of the democracy, the problem of the people who are in prison for nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Shackelford, the former U.S. diplomat who&rsquo;s now a foreign policy analyst, says such pressure would never work.</p>

<p>If the NBA tried to speak with Kagame about human rights abuses, &ldquo;I think [he would] just kick them out,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I imagine that the NBA is high-enough profile that they probably wouldn&rsquo;t disappear somebody from a hotel room. But he wouldn&rsquo;t tolerate it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>Shackelford says the league&rsquo;s position that it is helping Rwandans is misguided. If she had an audience with Silver, she says, &ldquo;I would tell him any organization that is aware, as he must be, that President Kagame ruthlessly represses any opposition, any civil society movements that want better for their country &hellip; anyone who tries to burnish that image and participates in a project that helps him look good is, in some ways, complicit in the harms that that does to the Rwandan people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So if it&rsquo;s just about money and a shiny stadium, I get it. But he&rsquo;s kidding himself if he doesn&rsquo;t think that they are part of something that is more nefarious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the NBA offices in New York, Tatum is read Shackelford&rsquo;s comments and doesn&rsquo;t hesitate in his response.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s entitled to her opinion,&rdquo; he says, reiterating the encouragement the NBA has received from the State Department.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know that we are positively impacting those Rwandans&rsquo; lives,&rdquo; Tatum says. &ldquo;And we know that by engaging in that market that those people are better off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the end of May, the BAL championships were played for the fourth time in Kagame&rsquo;s BK Arena, and they will be held there two more times in the next four years.</p>

<p>Just a month earlier, on April 22, the U.S. State Department issued its latest report on Rwanda&rsquo;s human rights abuses. It began, as it has for more than a decade:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were no significant changes in the human rights situation in Rwanda during the year.&rdquo;</p>

      <label for="lf1srg7" class="commentText"><p>ESPN the magazine/Cover Story/whatever it’s called now still has really good long form stuff they just rarely feature it on the website. They’re normally grouped on the right side of the page with like six other stories but every now and then it will be the cover story. I honestly can’t remember the last time I clicked one like this and felt like it was a waste of time.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/10781144/no-one-walks-island-los-angeles-dodgers-yasiel-puig-journey-cuba" target="_blank">This one is my favorite - a story on how Yasiel Puig got to America</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/12280555/how-billy-walters-became-sports-most-successful-controversial-bettor" target="_blank">here’s a one about a handicapper I remember enjoying</a>.</p>

<p>I understand why stuff like this doesn’t usually float to the top here, but it’s also the reason Grantland tried to do these types of articles for free and ended up folding. Everybody claims to want better analysis or more in depth reporting but it’s easier to react to 15 seconds clips.</p>

      <label for="lf24q0s" class="commentText"><p>There was a period near a decade ago between my last years of high school and first years of university where paywalls hadn’t quite yet been so prevalent or at least were easily bypass-able and one could just read as many long form articles as they wanted to their hearts content… You’d load up an article at home and spend 20 mins on the bus completely immersed in a different world.</p>

<p>I get that traditional media hasn’t been profitable for a while now and journalists need to make a living and also one kinda gets what they pay for (you pay nothing, you get a nothing burger) but gosh… I do really miss those days, every morning was a chance to get educated on something interesting and different.</p>

      <label for="lf2jinr" class="commentText"><p>I don’t even think it’s really about money. It’s just easier to circle jerk about how stupid talking heads are than it is to read something that is well written and try and contribute to the conversation. If it were just a money thing for people Grantland would still be around.</p>

<p>I typically don’t like using the term “revealed preferences” because it can ignore that people are limited by what they can afford but I do think it’s a case of that. The internet just moves too fast for stuff like this to routinely be the center of attention - whether it be on this subreddit or elsewhere. Plus if we are being honest a lot of Redditors like arguing and articles like this aren’t a good spring board for that unless they’re politically focused.</p>

The exact same can be said of Burundi and Uganda, both just next door. Rwanda has actually gotten material results from it though, as fucked up as it is. I&rsquo;ve lived and worked in every country in east Africa and Rwanda is so far ahead of the others it is hard to overstate how well Kagame has done.  So yes, call a spade a spade, but let&rsquo;s not forget the wider context this is happening in (a tiny, agricultural, landlocked nation merely 20 years out of a genocide that is desperate to rebuild government functions and diversify their economy) </p>

Unfortunately, he has a saviour complex where he thinks that he&rsquo;s the only one who can lead Rwanda without another genocide. He deserves all the praise for what he did in the 1990s, but since then he&rsquo;s been desperate to hang onto power.</p>

<p>At least that&rsquo;s my observation from trying to stay on top of what happens there after I took a trip there in 2008. It&rsquo;s a beautiful country with a horrible past and a leader that seems to think he&rsquo;s the only one who can keep the country from repeating the horrors of the past.</p>

Go to the Genocide Museum in Kigali if you want to be impacted for life. Visiting the museum was a life altering experience for me. I still think about it weekly 16 years later. The Rwandan Genocide was truly horrific, brutal, and carnally violent. 800,000 people hacked to death with machetes by their neighbours and friends. That doesn&rsquo;t even begin to describe horrific it was. I remember almost having to disassociate while at the Museum, I was on the verge of a breakdown while there. I&rsquo;m still not sure how I made it out of there without having a breakdown. Words can&rsquo;t describe the horrors that were committed.</p>

      <label for="lf350aa" class="commentText"><p>Yeah.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also not like Kigame is living a super opulent life, sure he lives well, but not like a lot of other African dictators. When I was there, I got a real sense that the government was focused on prosperity for everyone, so as to not create the kind of divisions that led to the genocide. I don&rsquo;t know if that was actually true, or still is true, but I had many people tell me that the government was trying to do that. I was in some poor areas, working with poor people, and that was their perspective.</p>

<p>Obviously, that doesn&rsquo;t excuse the bad that Kigame does and he has really tightened his grip on power since 2008. Giving people a voice in government and allowing dissenting voices is very important for democracy to flourish and for countries to reach their potential.</p>

<p>Again, this is just the perspective of one western white guy who spent time there and has always had an interest in the country. One of my early memories of news from other countries was about the genocide, I saw a news segment about it that my parents were watching when I was young. I fully understand that I don&rsquo;t know the intricacies of the country, I could be wrong. Rwanda is a beautiful country with wonderful people. I want nothing but the best for them and I hope to see the country flourish as a democracy in my lifetime.</p>

Because historically, they have sided with far-right and fascist blocs in order to achieve their goals instead of taking a more humane approach. So many Americans glaze up what El Salvador is doing without ever thinking about all the innocent people that get caught in the mix and what comes after. It&rsquo;s why there were people that gave someone with an impending ICC arrest warrant a standing ovation, and arrested people en masse that were protesting his appearance.</p>

<p>And weirdly when they did that in other countries like Korea, the dictators always seem to purge and kill leftists who naturally are more opposed to far right ideology.</p>

      <label for="lf25w8d" class="commentText"><p>actually espn.com has been S tier. not the layout but content, most are paywalled but can be accessed easily.  as for silver i think its clear hes unfit to lead the nba. for many reasons but the act of being leaders in social issues or whatever is kinda boring. everyone know its just an act to cater to the players when you take such strong stances for black rights its honestly cringe and somehow more divisive. especially when your funding projects for this dictator. uriji and rc and everyone associated all need to go. if were forcing owners that said the N word while retelling events where that word was used by another person to sell team and get canceled. i dont see how this is even allowed. this the social justice league right? or we gunna just keep scapegoating lol. who else can we punish to keep the news cycle busy til ppl forget this time? should we let thr public know about the mavs stuff? maybe ja again? can we get dillon for something? .. </p>

Rubber mines in particular are notoriously bad. They source materials and products from places like china, Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, the Philippines, etc… they don’t have social compliance audits or pre sourcing audits for most of these. they  are open and upfront about it, while at the same time saying they are doing everything they can. I didn’t feel like going much further down the road. But there is reason those countries are used and no audits</p>

      <label for="lf1k0ml" class="commentText"><p>Shackelford is right, IMO. The answer then is whether or not these companies continue to do business in these countries and look the other way on abuses while claiming to be pro-human rights. And the answer is yes&hellip;.consistently. They do business and look the other way consistently.</p>

<p>It is a bit of a tricky situation because I do think there is something to argue to modernization of these nations with backwards laws and not just freezing them out entirely from the modern world. There&rsquo;s something to argue that the presence of the NBA is a net positive. Basketball Africa being a net positive.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really not as easy as just boycotting Africa and the Middle East. I do think your average citizen should. The bigger issue is that they don&rsquo;t give a fuck about the sustenance of these regions, they just want the untapped cash. Adam Silver is no different than the rest in that regard&hellip;he doesn&rsquo;t care about the right thing, he cares about money. Masai is pretty clearly a power hungry guy&hellip;their motivations are not pure, and that&rsquo;s true of 90% of suits.</p>

<p>The guy has repeatedly turned down ownership stakes in organizations to stay with the Raptors because he knows that building that particular team is broadening the NBA global presence and specifically growing the sport in Canada, to the point where it&rsquo;s as popular as hockey.</p>

<p>He started Giants of Africa, not just for future professional players, but for it&rsquo;s participants in Africa who&rsquo;ll never make a professional league but will gain important life skills, set goals and become productive members in their society.  It&rsquo;s one of the main tenets they preach at clinics, &lsquo;work hard and do good in your neighbourhood&rsquo;.  He&rsquo;s one of the most authentic sports personalities out there.</p>

<p>Are you basing your opinion on 1 news article?</p>

<p>Africa has a few nations with less than ideal government and if you want access to the population, to build infrastructure and roads for those people to get out of hardship&hellip;then you have to develop some type of business relationship with those unsavory officials.</p>

<p>IDK what the controversial over the 5 acre land parcel.  Those properties are 100 yr leases, 2nd, Masai&rsquo;s is not gonna risk his career over some little parcel of land, he makes over $15M/yr, has still a long career ahead of him as a relatively young executive.</p>

<p>Logistically it makes sense for him to take control of the development since that&rsquo;s what he excels at and has been during his tenure w the Raptors.  He&rsquo;s developed a state of the art facility that accomodates the 905, the Raptors and Team Canada activities.  The ownership stake in Ruwanda allows him to have full control of the development of the supporting facilities without gov&rsquo;t cronies getting in the way.</p>

<p>Masai&rsquo;s seen every level of development during his time in Africa, and I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s well aware and wary of insincere ownership groups that develop infrastructure with management &amp; kickbacks in mind over what&rsquo;s best for the players and fans.</p>

<p>The fact that BAL has teams from 12 nations and only 4 facilities to play at speaks volumes about how hard it is to build that type of infrastructure in Africa.</p>

<p>My opinion is that Masai is focusing on the sport aspect, using it to uplift people through proximity.  He can&rsquo;t displace a dictator, but what he can do is bring basketball to a place that otherwise would have no contact to it.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s seen how the Raptors franchise being in Ontario, CA has made it one of the worlds hotbeds of basketball talent just by having the game nearby and in the community.</p>

<p>If having that infrastructure there allows him to run his basketball clinics in Ruwanda, inspire some kids to some other route in life, make relationships w each other and players from other coutries and put the guns down for a little while to pick up a basketball, then the good guys are starting to get some significant wins in an otherwise hopeless situation.</p>

      <label for="lf2xcis" class="commentText"><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t describe Masai as power hungry because that seems derogatory, but him staying in Toronto is not really evidence against him being power hungry.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s leveraged his awesome resume to garner more and more authority over (and money from) the organization, and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. He&rsquo;s long been interested in international and diplomatic affairs, which was part of one team&rsquo;s pitch (per rumor).</p>

<p>The guy&rsquo;s a star, and if he wants more of a role he should seek it. Dude has a ton of potential in this country and globally.</p>

<p>It’s generally accepted you need a dictator to stop a dictator, democracy starts usually when a dictator gives up power.</p>

<p>In this case I don’t think they would be anyone who can take over and not be biased by the civil war. Paul has been focused on developing Rwanda and removing the dictatorship in Congo. He could hand over power and start a civil war tomorrow</p>

      <label for="lf1xut6" class="commentText"><p>Not to be a shill for the NBA, but working in Africa likely means working alongside a dictator… it’s just really a fact there. This document on page 20 (<a href="https://planetrulers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/freedom-in-the-world-2022-report-freedom-house.pdf" target="_blank">https://planetrulers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/freedom-in-the-world-2022-report-freedom-house.pdf</a>) shows the majority of Africa as “not free” meaning ruled by a dictator with only ~3 countries noted as “free.”</p>

<p>Sure they certainly could have not done this, but if the nba wants to be in Africa you’re going to have to work with not so great leaders. At that point do you focus on trying to grow your brand and potentially help those people there or just say no to them because their leaders are awful?</p>

His &ldquo;brutality&rdquo; is more due to Rwanda (and Uganda) funding rebels in eastern Congo.</p>

      <label for="lf2epw3" class="commentText"><p>First, Africa has been under the boot of western colonialism for hundreds of years. Second, Africa desperately needs economic infrastructure and BAL is a piece of that infrastructure. Third, if you want to build a multi nation sports league in Africa you will have to work with “dictators” to accomplish this. Fourth, this league is lifting average people where it operates. People in poverty need opportunity, this provides it.</p>

<p>It’s easy for people who live in first world countries to look down and judge organizations who are actually trying to bring change and opportunity to people in challenging situations. This quote from Masai Ujiri I think is the most important to understanding, he says” I actually don’t care what anybody really thinks here. My focus is developing AFRICA and the growth”. That building of systems of growth is what is imperative to Africa to fix wounds that run hundreds of years deep. We can poke holes in any country or organization, maybe we should judge them as a whole. The world is shades of grey not black and white. Americans are the first who shouldn’t throw stones.</p>

      <label for="lf2ewc9" class="commentText"><p>I spent a couple weeks in Kigali this summer and went to one of the Basketball Africa League tournament games while I was there. The games that Kigame attended were packed, the games he didn&rsquo;t way less so. The whole area around the arena is under development with a new football stadium opening soon next to it, and yet some clear poverty exists in Kigali, nevermind the surrounding villages.</p>

<p>Kigame is a darling of the west because of the way he&rsquo;s been able to cultivate and use foreign aid, but pry a little beneath the surface and it&rsquo;s all and mirrors and shifting narratives. Rwanda has so much potential, is so beautiful, and so bizarre to be in.</p>

<p>He likely saw an opportunity in making friends with a more powerful person - so far, it seems to have paid off handsomely. I would imagine Masai has a &lsquo;break a few eggs to make an omelette&rsquo;, &lsquo;accomplish the mission at all costs&rsquo; kind of attitude about this.</p>

<p>I can see both sides. The circumstance is definitely not ideal (to say the least), but I can understand how Masai is so motivated for his cause that he&rsquo;d throw optics to the wind if it means he can achieve his goals faster and more easily.</p>

      <label for="lf39o3i" class="commentText"><p>A lot of people here are missing the point.</p>

<p>It isn’t about “boycotting” or whatever. It’s about how a couple top executives in the league got in a relationship with a dictator with a track record of human rights abuses. You don’t have to “boycott” anything, <em>just don’t fucking get into business with them in the first place</em>. This isn’t Nike, which has had a decades long relationship with the league, long before accusations of child labor began.</p>

<p><strong>This is Masai Ujiri exploiting his NBA influence and connections to scratch the back of his friend, who is a dictator.</strong></p>

<p>Ujiri and Silver and this Tatum cunt are shit. They know exactly what they’re doing. They want the money, they don’t give a shit about the game or the people.</p>

<p>They never had to get into this relationship. They could have invested somewhere else, but no, Ujiri needed to help his buddy out.</p>

<p>So yeah, stop talking about “well uh they can’t boycott Africa” or “well uh if they didn’t do this they’d be hypocrites ‘cuz Nike child labor durdur”. They never had do to this shit in the first place. Greedy cunts.</p>

<p>They also talk about how he kills across borders to stifle dissent without going into the context that most people Rwanda targets are former perpetrators of the genocide from the Interahamwe who fled into Congo.</p>

<p>There are many legitimate criticisms of Kagame but this article clearly is trying to make a scoop with a controversial statement about the NBA more than it is trying to present a real account of life in this African nation.</p>

      <label for="lf43ch4" class="commentText"><p>you are saying nothing of substance. The NBA profits off the USA who support literal dictators. Where is your outrage? Its always selective. Always.</p>

<p>You are aware Stern lead the way to expanding to the Chinese audience right? Would you like to condemn that? That was in 1987. Do you recall what happened in 1989? That didnt stop Stern from &ldquo;growing the game&rdquo;</p>

<p>As always a purely american centric view, with no care to actually look at that view.</p>

      <label for="lf4nglr" class="commentText"><p>You know what, you’re right, where are you from? I always love the ideology of those outside the us as they shit on us while at the same time almost completely dependent upon on</p>

<p>So go ahead, why doesn’t your country take charge since the 1940s? I mean for real let’s get into it</p>

<p>Let me know when you have an argument as to why your government doesn’t do anything but point finger at the us lol please go ahead and take the lead</p>

<p>We would truly appreciate it lol but instead you’ll just complain while we take charge</p>

<p>Go ahead and say we are wrong, but I don’t see any other government doing shit against China either</p>

<p>What does most of your items say at the bottom? Oh made in China?</p>

<p>Well well lol I guess your not in charge  of your government like I am also not lol</p>

<p>So let me know what your government has done, I just love this holier than others bs, while your government sits on the sidelines and does nothing at all</p>

<p>Yup, we profit while trying to spread democracy, sorry it’s closer to oligarchy than you or I may want, but it’s not a dictatorship either like many</p>

<p>I wish we didn’t do as much for profit or for the billionaires, but please tell me how your system is better?</p>

<p>I’m truly hoping you respond with some unheard of country that can do what the US has done in the last 80 years</p>

<p>Go ahead, tell me what your country is doing in comparison</p>

<p>Can’t wait to wake up tomorrow to read what you respond with.  Even the greatest European nations have major gaps, and I truly hope your not about to say any other nation</p>

<p>But I don’t know whom that could be, considering the us has been in charge since fucking Ww2 lol</p>

<p>Why did you attempt to call out Silver and say Stern was all good? They are both literally &ldquo;growing the game&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s quite frankly amazing you are still saying nothing of substance.</p>

      <label for="lf4p1hj" class="commentText"><p>Buddy you are moving the goal posts. The discussion here is framed around you selectively choosing what you want to be outraged about. Specifically when comparing to Stern and Silver</p>

<p>Again an American centric view. You see what is in front of you right now but everything else can be forgotten about.</p>

<p>Reminder this is your initial comment</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I always knew Adam silver wasn’t near as good as David stern….but this is way worse than I ever expected</p>

<p>I just thought he was a pushover for players</p>

<p>But this is morally wrong of him to do, I wonder if anyone will ask him directly about it on camera</p>

<p>Im not the one making a moral claim, and you arent even consistent in that moral framing.</p>

<p>Or, shut the f up lol straight up, say your country and its track record or shut up</p>

<p>Incredibly sleight of hand or words here. What is Kagame doing currently that is “worse” than actively sponsoring the extermination of a group of people? But because the nba doesn’t <strong>actively</strong> oppose it lol, it technically doesn’t count. Typical rag that passes as journalism on ESPN and is touted by people who like to pretend every once in a while that they really care about human rights. Please, let’s just agree to focus on the game and stop the occasional hypocritical sanctimonious posturing.</p>
