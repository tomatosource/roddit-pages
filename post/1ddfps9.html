Like no top-end talent (yes legends but well past their prime except Parker and a young Klaw), but holy shit were they a basketball <em>machine</em>. Their ball movement was unbelievable and not replicated since.</p>

<p>I legitimately think they’d go toe-to-toe with any NBA team in history.</p>

      <label for="l86ba7q" class="commentText"><p>I loved the 2018 Rockets and was rooting for them in that series. And yes they pushed them to 7.</p>

<p>But it just seemed like the games that Golden State won in that series they were winning by 15-25 points. Where as when Houston was winning games, they were usually close. It seemed like Houston had to play a near perfect game to win while simultaneously getting an off night from Warriors.</p>

<p>I think the 2014 Spurs team had that extra gear to match the Warriors.</p>

      <label for="l87a3dy" class="commentText"><p>The 2014 Spurs are perhaps the deepest team we&rsquo;ve ever seen. They had 9 guys who played significant minutes and averaged at or near 10 ppg during the regular season. They were also probably the most intelligent roster we&rsquo;ve ever seen. They had 3 great wing defenders in Kawhi, Danny Green, and Manu. These are guys who would at the very least make things difficult for Klay and KD. Nobody is completely shutting KD down, but I&rsquo;d put a 2014 Kawhi who was at his athletic peak and didn&rsquo;t have to carry the load offensively on a short list of guys who could at least slow him down.</p>

<p>The KD Warriors are probably the most talented team we&rsquo;ve ever seen in the modern era. The only team that really comes close is the 1995-96 Bulls. The Warriors were incredibly intelligent in their own right. But they also had to play their top guys lots of minutes during the playoffs.</p>

<p>When you have such a deep roster like the 2014 Spurs, guys can play harder because they are only playing 20-30 minutes a game.</p>

<p>They also were full of guys who had been there and done that before and wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of the moment. Duncan, Manu, Parker, Kawhi, Diaw, and Green aren&rsquo;t suddenly playing tight because Golden State just hit a big shot or made a run. And they had a great coach.</p>

<p>Nobody knows how it would play out, but I&rsquo;m putting that 2014 Spurs team on the top of my list in terms of teams that actually would have had a chance at beating the KD Warriors in recent history.</p>

      <label for="l87i1p1" class="commentText"><p>Problem is GSW is also filled with quality defenders here in Green, Klay, Iggy, and KD while just also having far greater firepower. KD doesn’t have to carry when Curry and Klay are also on the court. Kawhi would do better than most, but he really isn’t slowing KD down much on that GSW team.</p>

<p>I don’t really think the minutes aspect is as severe as you’re saying. Nobody in that GSW team played over 36mpg during those playoffs. This was also before 2018 and 2019 when their depth clearly took a hit.</p>

<p>I don’t really see that is mattering too much against a collection of players who’ve have all faced their fair share of adversity as well by 2017. I don’t see GSW destroying the ‘14 Spurs but I don’t have any doubt in my mind they’d beat them.</p>

      <label for="l87mpve" class="commentText"><p>The KD Warriors are the real-life Monstars. They are going to be the heavy favorite in any hypothetical this all-time great team vs. that all-time great team discussion.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m saying that within the last 15 years, the 2014 Spurs, in my mind, are one of the only teams that had a shot at beating them.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll never know, so we&rsquo;re arguing about something that will never happen. But the depth, basketball IQ, team defense, team cohesion, and championship pedigree of that team makes me think they could compete with the KD Warrior teams.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, the 2014 Spurs shot 46% from three in the finals.</p>

<p>But 2014 spurs passing was only matched by prime golden state this past decade. I never seen that type of ball movement ever actually but I’m too young to remember the 80s showtime Lakers</p>

      <label for="l84g5e4" class="commentText"><p>I don&rsquo;t think the 2014 Spurs are a good comparison. In fact, I actually think the Pacers offense is the closest thing we have to the 2014 Spurs offense. If you want beautiful ball movement and player movement, as well as great decision-making, it&rsquo;s the Pacers. Their brand of offense is probably the most beautiful thing out there and I still think they are very underrated.</p>

<p>Celtics offense is different. It&rsquo;s more simple and straight forward&hellip;and maybe more effective. Where is the mismatch? Attack it. Who cares where the mismatch is, they are just going to exploit it again and again.</p>

<p>Spurs/Pacers create their advantages, Celtics just attack the advantage they inevitably have in front of them.</p>

<p>Edit: I&rsquo;m not saying that the C&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t move the ball. I guess it&rsquo;s more the player movement than the ball movement I should be talking about. The cuts are simpler and a player standing around somewhere is by design. The offense can appear more stagnant for a larger portion of the shot clock, but that&rsquo;s ok because the threat is still there. 2014 Spurs and the Pacers to a lesser extent are constantly moving.</p>

<p>Spurs still had a lot of inside -&amp;gt; out with Timmy but the Celtics are 5 out a lot and just tear you up with drives. They get you in rotation until you make a mistake or close out too slowly. Both beautiful to watch when the balls humming around the court.</p>

<p>Like you said, this Cs team creates chaos by mismatching and getting a physical/talent advantage, which opens up the passing lanes or gets a guy open. That Spurs team was creating chaos just by constantly moving on and off ball, screening, and moving the ball in unexpected ways</p>

<p>Surprising to see that post from a Celtics fan. I dont disagree the Pacers played fanatastic team ball as well.</p>

<p>Celtics team ball passing is also a work of art</p>

<p>You barely see Tatum or Brown these days&hellip; go 1 on 1 and try to score it themselves.</p>

<p>They drive and kick/spray passes around.</p>

<p>Even a semi open Celtic on the corner. If it looks like a tough shot&hellip; will fake like he will shoot,  get past his man&hellip; and make a pass on the baseline&hellip; then out to a 3 pt shooter.  Etc.</p>

<p>Its awesome basketball</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure the similarity between Boston and the Spurs is quite there although Boston is arguably the best in the league at both ball movement and shooting.</p>

One thing is to have a team that relies on everyone scoring, but Celtics don&rsquo;t rely on that for every single night - they rely on that on multi-game scale. Every game they try different things and whoever has the hot hand or in other words wherever the opposing team has a weakness on a given night - they exploit that. 1st game was KP, 2nd game was Jrue. It&rsquo;s even bettan than everyone scoring the same amount of points.</p>

Instead of the passing and synergy seen in those spurs teams, this Celtics teams find the mismatches they can hunt, since 1-5 they nearly always have an advantage.</p>

      <label for="l84jacy" class="commentText"><p>I feel like that&rsquo;s a terrible comparison.</p>

<p>2014 Spurs played maybe the best offensive series I&rsquo;ve ever seen, even better than the prime warriors. They were on a mission to put the Heat down. They moved the ball like crazy and made them pay everywhere.</p>

<p>The Celtics are just a very good all around team. They don&rsquo;t have those crazy &lsquo;top 5 superstar&rsquo; talent on either end, but they&rsquo;re bonafide all stars on both ends and the Jay&rsquo;s are easily fringe superstars in that top 10 and they both play two way.</p>

<p>I feel like a good comparison for them is kind of like the ying to Denver from last years yang. Denver is better offensively but Boston is better defensively.</p>

<p>Tatum and Brown can go cold on offense and that&rsquo;s usually their biggest weakness but they&rsquo;ll usually always show up on defense. Honestly with some good roster management as long as the Jay&rsquo;s can improve offensively they&rsquo;ll be annoying for years. The only thing keeping Tatum and Brown from being bonafide top 5 guys is their inconsistent offense.</p>

<p>If anything they kind of remind me of the PG Pacer&rsquo;s team that kept getting close with the Heat, just a better version of it cause they have two PG like two way all stars. Them and Denver are just outliers because they&rsquo;re just.. all around good teams. The Warriors still had some weaknesses. Not to say they&rsquo;re better than the prime Warriors, just that they&rsquo;re just.. all around teams.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re that team that&rsquo;s like 85 85 overall when most of the top teams are like 90 80.</p>
