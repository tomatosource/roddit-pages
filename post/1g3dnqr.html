      <p>Vince Carter announced that he&rsquo;d be retiring as a raptor and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier about that. Being from a city close to Toronto, growing up he was my favorite player. He has played for a few teams and had a pretty good career. With that being said, there have been some other players who played for multiple teams. If you had to chose what team jersey they wore for their retirement which one are you picking?</p>

<ol>
<li>Chris paul</li>
<li>Ray Allen.
3 Kevin Durant.</li>

      <label for="lrv29gm" class="commentText"><p>This is a great question! At first I wanted to say they would go with the team they had the most success with. But would Kawhi turn up in a Raptors jersey? And we all know Durant didn&rsquo;t feel included in Golden State, so that would make OKC a more logical choice. But given he basically &ldquo;betrayed&rdquo; them (had he informed them earlier they could have traded him/get something back), I feel both are options with an asterix. Let&rsquo;s give it a try:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Chris Paul: LA Clippers. Paul didn&rsquo;t want to sign an extension in New Orleans so this is an easy choice. I feel his Suns run was too short to qualify (he played 13 more playoff games for the clippers).</p></li>

<li><p>Ray Allen: Boston Celtics. He played more Playoff games for Boston than all his other teams combined.</p></li>

<li><p>Kevin Durant: Seattle SuperSonics! :) This one is really tough, but if Carter can get his jersey retired in Toronto I feel Durant will make up with OKC</p></li>

<li><p>LeBron: Easy one: Cleveland ofcourse</p></li>

<li><p>Charles Barkley: MVP + Finals run, has to be the Suns.</p></li>

<p>Kevin Durant had an elite front office &amp; has some really freaking great pieces around him that he got caught shit talking on social media &amp; later went on to be a diva in MULTIPLE teams.</p>

<p>Watch what happens when Kyle Lowery’s number is called. Then you will see the fanbase rise up. Until then, enjoy the polite clapping.</p>

      <label for="lrvd88t" class="commentText"><p>I understand that KD going to the Warriors was a weak move and hated it as a basketball fan but I honestly don’t understand fans hating on a player for going into free agency.</p>

<p>IMO there’s nothing wrong with a player not telling management whether they want to stay or not, because honestly they probably don’t even know themselves. If OKC won in 2016 then KD probably would’ve stayed in OKC, and they had a pretty damn good chance at winning it all that year.</p>

<p>Cavs were better in 2017 despite their record, Warriors are still the Warriors, and the Spurs were a powerhouse if Kawhi doesn’t get hurt.</p>

<p>With that said they might’ve gotten Horford if KD committed so they would’ve been stacked as well.</p>

      <label for="lrvjasd" class="commentText"><p>Chris Paul - New Orleans and Clippers are neck and neck. His absolute prime is probably on the Clippers. But I&rsquo;d say he picks New Orleans because from his point of view, probably, retiring into HOF as a Clipper doesn&rsquo;t have that worthy a prestige and he&rsquo;d rather pick the team that drafted him.</p>

<p>Ray Allen - Celtics for sure. His prime is in Seattle, but it doesn&rsquo;t exist right now + it was a rather short stint and he got the championship as a Celtic + appease to the Celtics fans and KG for his move to Miami.</p>

<p>LeBron - Cavs no question. Even if he likes Miami the city more, the NBA world would absolutely destroy him if he doesn&rsquo;t pick the Cavs, so thats the only answer.</p>

<p>KD - Another good one. It should really be OKC, but Warriors have a chance because he got his championships there and he is hated in OKC. But I dont think his relationship with the warriors is that perfect either, so he&rsquo;d rather get the chance to appease the OKC fans since thats where he started and got his MVP anyway. Not to mention if he had pick the warriors it&rsquo;d be double downing on the OKC hate. Theres an outside chance of Seattle since thats where he was as a rookie, he can appease the Seattle fans and also avoid the dilemma of OKC vs warriors.</p>

<p>Barkley - I think he likes PHX more so I&rsquo;d say PHX. The only good thing he admitted to in Philly is that his true prime is there, he just got his MVP in PHX, but based on how he talks about PHX more I&rsquo;d say he likes it there better and they gave him the chance at the chip.</p>

      <label for="lrv7tzo" class="commentText"><p>I think Chris Paul&rsquo;s Los Angeles Clippers jersey would be the best choice for his retirement. Although he played for various teams, he made a big impact and was really popular with fans during his time with the Clippers. It&rsquo;s a tough decision because he had great moments with other teams too. In the end, it often depends on personal feelings, how much a player loves a team, and how much they helped that team succeed.</p>

He played twice as many seasons in a Sixers jersey. They were good seasons too, getting MVP votes, although he went further with the Suns in the playoffs and won the MVP.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s close, should be both.</p>
